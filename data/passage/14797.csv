passage
"Timmy Tiptoes sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and chuckled--""Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store for winter and spring."" Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch--""The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter."" ""Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in spring-time,"" replied prudent Timothy.The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail. He began to dig, and he could not remember. And then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight. And other squirrels began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion!The squirrels followed and listened. The first little bird flew into the bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and it sang--""Who's-bin digging-up _my_ nuts? Who's been digging-up _my_-nuts?""But when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts. The innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a fright!They caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the little round hole, and they pushed him in. The hole was much too small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure. They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they did not break his ribs. ""We will leave him here till he confesses,"" said Silvertail Squirrel, and he shouted into the hole--In the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses. He found himself tucked up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it seemed to be under ground. Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him. There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better?The Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree--""Besides, I found a few buried!"" It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story. While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to eat quantities--""But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin myself? My wife will be anxious!"" ""Just another nut--or two nuts; let me crack them for you,"" said the Chipmunk. Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and fatter!Now Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself. She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again. She hid them under a tree root; they rattled down, down, down. Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry."
