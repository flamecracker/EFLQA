"Enclosed in this envelope is the cord and the needle with which to bind this book. Start in from the outside as shown on the diagram here. Pass the needle and thread through the center of the book, leaving an end extend outside, then through to the outside, about 2 inches from the center; then from the outside to inside 2 inches from the center at the other end of the book, bringing the thread finally again through the center, and tie the two ends in a knot, one each side of the cord on the outside. This book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN BOOK OF GREAT MUSICIANS, written by Thomas Tapper, author of ""Pictures from the Lives of the Great Composers for Children,"" ""Music Talks with Children,"" ""First Studies in Music Biography,"" and others.After this play-work is completed there will be found at the back of the book blank pages upon which the child is to write his own story of the great musician, based upon the facts and questions found on the previous pages.This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and interesting task for the children, but will teach them the main facts with regard to the life of each of the great musicians--an educational feature worth while.

In Germany where Handel was born his name was Georg Friedrich Händel (pronounced Gay-org Freed-riesh Hayn-del). But the great composer spent so much of his life in England that people now use the English form of his name.The father was a surgeon and barber, a queer combination. We know that he did not like music, and that he was unwilling for his son to study it. Of the mother we know little. But we do know that she loved her little George Frederick, and helped him as far as she could.""Here,"" said Mother Handel, ""my little boy can play the harpsichord to his heart's content and no one will be the wiser."" You can imagine the surprise when the stern barber-surgeon stalked into the attic, followed by the family, holding high the lantern.After that it may have been agreed that the boy should practice a little; not, however, that he might become a musician. ""No, indeed,"" we may imagine Father Handel exclaiming, ""my son shall be a famous lawyer.""One day when little George was seven years old his father set out by coach to visit another son, who was in the service of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. The little boy begged his father to let him go on the journey. ""No,"" he replied, ""you are too young to go so far.""He kept on trudging along as fast as his little feet would go. Every one hoped he would get tired and go back, but finally the father had to order the coach to stop and take him in. Thus did he show that determination which helped him all his life.All were delighted with his talent. One day the Duke himself heard him play. He, too, was astonished that one so young should show so much skill. Calling the father into his presence, he pointed out how wrong it was to deny the boy the right to study music. ""The world,"" he said, ""should have the good of your son's great ability.""At the Cathedral in Handel's home city, Halle, there was a famous organist named Zachau. He became the boy's teacher. They must have had a busy time together, for he had lessons from Zachau not only in organ playing, but in harmony, counterpoint, canon, and fugue; and in hautbois, violin, and harpsichord playing."
If you will look at this picture of the harpsichord on which Handel played, you will see that it is unlike the grand piano of our day. How does it differ? And yet for this simple instrument Handel wrote beautiful music. Some day you will play his Little Fugues and some of the dances from the Suites.When Handel was twelve years old his father died. From that time on he worked hard to perfect himself in his profession. He became organist at Halle, but soon left there for Hamburg, which at that time was renowned for its music.Here Handel began to work his way, making many friends, one of whom was the famous Johann Mattheson. One day Handel and Mattheson went by coach to Lubeck, where, at one of the churches, an organist was wanted. Mattheson wished to try for the position, but when he learned he would have to marry the daughter of the old organist he and Handel came back to Hamburg heart free. This is a fine old picture of Handel's friend, Johann Mattheson.After his residence in Italy Handel went back to Germany, where he met the Elector of Hanover, who induced him to accept the post of Capellmeister. Handel agreed to do this on condition that he might first visit England.But to his surprise and confusion it happened while he was in London that the very Elector of Hanover became George I, King of England. Handel expected he would fare badly with the king for not having returned as Capellmeister to Germany. But a friend arranged the matter so that Handel should compose some music for the king's coronation, hoping thereby to please his majesty.He composed twenty-five pieces, called _Water Music_. A boat containing the players followed that in which the king sat. When the music was performed the king asked who composed it. This led to Handel's being invited into the royal boat, where he again won the king's favor.Handel greatly wished to give opera in London and devote his time to it as composer. For many years the writing and staging of operas took all of Handel's time and thought, but he was not destined to make it a true success. Handel was a very fine performer at the keyboard.Once again Handel visited his native land. On returning to England, which was to be his home for the future, he was asked by a wealthy gentleman, the Duke of Chandos, to become composer at the ducal residence. Handel accepted this offer and composed much beautiful music, which some day we shall hear.He had tried hard to please the English public as an opera composer, and the disappointment of his failure caused him a severe illness from which he suffered greatly. He lived to write some of the most lovely music the world possesses.Perhaps the most famous of all his oratorios is the _Messiah_. When this was sung for the first time in London the king and all present rose at the words--_For the Lord God Omnipotent Reigneth_. Thus came the custom of rising at the singing of the _Hallelujah Chorus_.
