passage
"""I'm glad you like it,"" said Cora Kimball, the camp hostess. ""I felt that you would, but one can never be sure--especially of Belle. Jack said she would fall a prey to that clump of white birches over there, and would want to paint pictures on the bark. But I fancied she would take more surely to the pines; they are so strong--and, like the big boys--always to be depended on. But not a word about camp now. Something more important is on. My new motor boat has just arrived!""""And truly,"" finished Cora with a smile. ""Yes, it has, and there is not a boy on the premises to show me how to run it. Jack expected to be here, but he isn't. So now I'm going to try it alone. I never could wait until evening to start my new boat. And isn't it lovely that you have arrived in time to take the initial run? I remember you both took the first spin with me in my auto, the Whirlwind, and now here you are all ready for the trial performance of the motor boat. Now Belle, don't refuse. There is absolutely no danger.""""We can all swim,"" put in her sister, ""and you promised, Belle, not to be nervous this trip. Yes, Cora, I'm all ready. I saw the craft as we came up. Wasn't it the boat with the new light oak deck and mahogany gunwale? I am sure it was,""""Let us hope it will not be a man; we can't let Cora get married, whatever else she may do,"" put in Bess, as she shook the dust from her motor coat, and prepared to follow Cora, who was already leaving the camp. Belle, too, started, but one could see that she, though a motor girl, did not exactly fancy experimenting on the water. It was but a short distance to the lake's edge, for the camp had been chosen especially on account of the water advantage.""There she is! See how she stands out in the clear sunshiny water! I tell you it is the very prettiest boat on Cedar Lake, and that is saying something,"" exclaimed Cora, the proud possessor of the new motor craft.""Why, I have been studying marine motors in general, and have been shown about this one in particular,"" replied Cora. ""The man who ran it up from the freight depot for me gave me a few 'pointers,' as he called them.""""You take the seat in the stern, Belle, and Bess, you may sit here near me,"" said Cora, ""as I suppose you will be interested in seeing how it works. Oh! There is the steamer from the train. Hurry! Perhaps there are folks aboard we know. Let us act at home, and pretend we have been running motor boats all our lives."""
"""You see this is the little pipe that feeds the 'gas' from the tank to the carburetor,"" she explained. ""Now, I just throw in the switch: that makes the electrical connection: then I have to give this fly wheel--it's stiff--but I have to swing it around so! There!"" and the wheel ""flew"" around twice slowly and then began to revolve very rapidly. ""Now we are ready,"" and the engine started its regular chug chug.Bess took up her place at the steering wheel and turned it so that the boat started on a clear course. Everything seemed to work beautifully, and presently Bess was so interested in the gentle swerving of the craft, as the rudder responded to her slightest touch, that she, too, thought it very much simpler than motoring on land.""They are the motor girls!"" Cora heard some one on the steamer shout, and while this much has been told it may be well to acquaint the reader with further details of the situation. The Motor Girls were friends whom we have met in the four previous volumes of this series entitled respectively: ""The Motor Girls,"" ""The Motor Girls on a Tour,"" ""The Motor Girls at Lookout Beach,"" and ""The Motor Girls Through New England."" In each of these volumes we have met Cora Kimball, the handsome, dashing girl who conquers everything within reason, but who, herself, is occasionally conquered, both in the field of sports and in the field of human endeavors. It was she who had the first automobile, her Whirlwind and while out in it she had some very trying experiences.In the first volume she managed to unravel the mystery of the road. Bess and Bell, the Robinson twins, were with her, as they were again in the second volume, the story of a strange promise. This promise, odd as it was, all three girls kept, to the delight and happiness of little Wren, the crippled child. Next the girls went to Lookout Beach, where they had plenty of good fun, as well as time enough to find the runaways, two very interesting young girls, who had decamped from the ""Strawberry patch."" It was like a game of hide and seek, but in the end the motor girls did capture the runaways. Then in the story ""Through New England,"" it was Cora who was hidden away by the gypsies, and what she endured, and how she escaped were assuredly wonderful. There were brothers and friends of course, Jack Kimball being the most important person of the first variety, while Walter Pennington and Ed Foster were friends in need and friends indeed.And now we find these same girls undertaking a new role--that of running a motor boat, the gift of Mrs. Kimball to her daughter, for that mother, in her days of widowhood, had learned how safe it was to repose confidence in her two children, Cora and Jack.The camp at Cedar Lake had been taken by Cora and her friends for a summer vacation on the water, and now, after a day's run from Chelton, the home town, in their auto, the Flyaway, the Robinson girls had again joined Cora who had come up the day previous, with a maid to get the camp to rights. For some seconds no one seemed to know just what had happened. The steamer was clear, and the motor boat was running safely. Three very wet girls were thanking their good fortune that the water was their only damage--and water in the shape of a shower of spray is not much of a matter to complain of, after you escape a collision.""I jerked the wheel just enough to get a little to one side, and then the steamer had a chance to turn away,"" replied Cora. ""I tell you we had a close shave, but that makes our first trip all the more interesting. Bess, can I trust you now to take my place while I look at that wheel? The rope may have slipped?""""Whirlpooled?"" finished Jack. ""Better make her the Petrel, Cora, for two reasons. We bought it from Mr. Peters, and she can walk on the water like the old original sea-fowl. Just see how she does saunter along."""
"""That's the hole in the hill, isn't it?"" asked Walter. ""Well, I'm glad they have come up--the Benny Blakeses. I like a lot of folks around here. It is apt to have a depressing effect upon me if company is scarce and fishing shy.""""Or weather wet,"" put in Ed. ""But say, Cora, I'd like to try the Pet."" He remembered he was in a blue bathing suit, ever the most appropriate costume for a canoe. ""But I'll wait until later, though I hate to. We have, as a matter of fact, an engagement at Far Island. Have you heard?""""Oh, yes indeed,"" said Cora in spite of the protest that was trembling on Belle's lips. ""We started out, and we will get back all right. Wish you luck in whatever you are after,"" and she winked at Bess, who was now beside her at the engine, as Cora had concluded to guide the boat by the auxiliary steering wheel.""I wonder what they are up to?"" asked Cora. ""As soon as we can do so, without being noticed, I think we will follow them. There must have been something important on, when Jack did not wait to take me out.""""Then suppose we take you in? Nettie is at the camp, and then Bess and I can go out to the island. There was really nothing the matter with the boat, the mistake was all due to our own nervousness.""""Good for you, Bess,"" said Cora. ""There is nothing like courage, unless it be gasoline,"" and after starting the engine, she turned the boat toward the shore. ""There are the boys heading for the other island!"" she exclaimed a moment later.""Oh, don't you worry about us,"" replied Cora confidently. ""I feel as if this boat was a top in my hands. It is so much easier to handle than an auto. No gears, differentials or things like that. Good bye, Belle. Have supper ready when we return,"" and she sounded the small whistle that told of the start again."
"""Yes, there is one island over there,"" answered Cora, pointing to the extreme eastern shore of the water, ""and since I have seen it I am just dying to explore it. They call it Fern Island, and the store man tells the most wonderful tales about it. But we will have to wait until we all assemble. When did Hazel say she would come?""""Hazel will make her mark some day, if she does not spoil it all by having someone make it for her--on a flat stone. But honestly Bess, I do hope she will come up before the others. Next to you and Belle I count more on Hazel Hastings than on anyone else in our party.""""And not a little on her brother Paul?"" and Bess laughed in her teasing way. ""Now Cora, Paul Hastings is acknowledged to be the most useful boy in all the Chelton set. He can fix an auto, fix an electric bell, fix an alarm clock--""""Well, perhaps he is taking it to the dock,"" and Cora allowed her boat to touch the island shore. ""At any rate if we are to find the boys we had better be at it, for I want to start back before that throng of boats gets in my way. I feel sure enough, but I like room.""""Come on, Cora dear,"" begged Bess, so that Cora was obliged to agree. ""See, all the boats have gone the other way. And if anything happened we might just as well be on this desert island as on that desert water.""""Oh,"" sighed Bess, ""I felt as if something dreadful was going to happen. Ever since those gypsies took you, Cora, I am actually afraid of everything in the country. It did seem safe on the water, but in those woods--""""Now, Bess dear, you are to forget all about the gypsies. I have almost done so--that is, I have forgotten all the unpleasant part. Of course, I occasionally hear from Helka. Do you want to steer, Bess?""But the motor boat, girls headed straight for shore--the sun seemed falling into the lake as they reached the camp to be welcomed by Belle. The story of the trip to the island and the disappearance of the boys was quickly told.""All of them?"" and Cora could not repress a smile. ""It would take a very large sized whale to gobble them all at once, and surely they could not all have been seized with swimming cramps at the same moment. No, Belle, I have no such fear. But I am going right out to investigate. I know Jack would never stay away if he could get here, especially when he knew this would be your first evening at the lake. Why, the boys were just wild to try my boat,"" and she threw her motor cape over her shoulders. ""Come on girls, down to the steamer landing. There may have been some accident."""
"Belle and Bess were ready instantly. Indeed the twins seemed more alarmed than did Cora, but then they were not used to brothers, and did not realize how many things may happen and may not happen, to detain young men on a summer day or even a summer night.""Oh dear!"" sighed Belle, ""I have always dreaded the water. I did promise mamma and Bess to conquer my nervousness and not make folks miserable, but now just see how things happen to upset me,"" and she was almost in tears.""Nothing has happened yet, Belle dear,"" said Cora kindly, ""and we hope nothing will happen. You see your great mistake comes from what Jack calls the 'sympathy bug.' You worry about people before you know they are in trouble. I feel certain the boys will be found safe and sound, but at the same time I would not be so foolhardy as to trust to dumb luck.""""Well it is sensible not to fuss, Bess, so we will grant your point,"" finished Cora as they stepped on the boardwalk that led to the boat landing. ""Why, I didn't suppose they would light up with that moon,"" she said. ""That's the old watchman over there.""""Well, if they're on Fern Island at night I pity them. There ain't never been anyone who put up there after dark who wasn't ready to die of fright, 'ceptin' Jim Peters. And the old boy hisself couldn't scare Jim. Guess he's too chununy with him,"" and the waterman chuckled at his joke.""There! Didn't I tell you not to take any stock in Jim's news! I knowed he was fibbin'. But--say miss. There's this about Jim. He don't ever take the trouble to make up a yam unless he has a motive. Now I'll bet Jim knows something about them lads.""""How could we get to his place? Do you think he is at the shanty now?"" went on Cora, determined to find out something of the man, for she had reason to believe that the dock-hand knew what he was talking about.""Bless you, child! It ain't no place for young girls like you to go to any time, much less at night. But I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll jest take a look around myself. I sort of like a girl who knows how to talk to old Ben without being sassy."""
"""Wall, there's Constable Hannon. He is all right to trace a thing when you tell him where it is, but Tom Hannon hates to think."" Ben raised the lantern above his head and then, as if satisfied that the signaling was all finished, he placed the lantern on a hook that hung over the edge of the dock.""One thing seems certain,"" she said to all who were listening, ""they could not all have been drowned. They were all expert swimmers. Nor would they go to any merry-go-'round and leave us waiting for them. The question now is, what could have detained them?""A man came slouching along the dock. He had the way of seeming much younger than he pretended to be--that is he walked with his head down although his shoulders were straight and broad as those of any well trained athlete. The three girls instantly decided that this man had some strange motive in his manner. He was shamming, they thought.""Not much tide on this here lake,"" replied Ben sharply. ""Never knowed much about them tides, as I've lived at this hole most all my born days. But how was business to-day? That was quite a fleet. How'd you make out?""Now Cora saw that this was the man who had come down the lake with the canoe trailing behind his rowboat. He stepped into the lantern's light, and both Bess and Belle must also have recognized him, for they shot a meaning glance at Cora.""Have you a motor boat? Good! Where is it? Here, I'll call Dan. He kin run faster than a deer. Dan! Dan! Dan!"" shouted the old man, and from a nearby rowboat, where, evidently, some boys were having some sort of a harmless game, Dan appeared. He was a tall youth, the sort that seems to grow near the water. ""Hey Dan, I want you to go where this girl tells you, and fetch her boat,"" said Ben. ""Quick now, we've got something to do."""
"""Better let me run her,"" said the man, ""as I know all the spots in this here lake. Besides,"" and he touched the engine almost fondly, ""there ain't nothin' I like better than a boat, unless it's a fish line.""Belle and Bess sat in the stem and Cora went forward. It was a delightful evening and, but for the urgency of their quest, the first night sail of the Petrel on Cedar Lake would have been a perfect success.Belle and Bess were both too nervous to talk. It seemed like some pirate story, that they should be following a strange fisherman to a wild island in the night, in hopes of finding the boys--possibly captured boys!""But he was mad,"" said Ben, and in this the old fisherman made no mistake, for the voices of the boys, in angry protest, could be heard, as they argued with some one, who succeeded in keeping his part of the conversation silent from the anxious listeners.""Hush! 'Taint no use to fight with Jim. He'd get the best of you sure, and besides, then he would be your enemy. Just make a joke of it, and I'll tell you more later,"" and Ben prepared to start as soon as the boys, who were climbing into the motor boat, were ready.""If you hadn't taken us off that old sieve,"" put in Ed, ""I think we would soon have had to swim back to the island. We never could have made the shore in that thing, neither could we swim that distance.""The boys were too busy talking to the girls, and the latter were too busy asking questions, to go further into the matter of the leaking boat, but Cora did not fail to notice that the craft must have ""leaked to order."" ""What could that man have intended doing? Did he want to sink the boat?"" she was wondering.""Well, if we haven't had a pretty time of it,"" said Ed. ""First, we had to go up trees to get out of the way of something--we are not yet sure whether it was man or beast. Then when we crawled down, and made for the shore the canoe was gone clear out of sight.""Cora gave Bess the signal to keep still about having seen a canoe at the back of Jim Peter's rowboat that afternoon. Cora was convinced that Ben knew what he was talking about when he warned her to be careful of Jim Peters.""Just pinch me,"" said Ed laughing, ""and if I don't give our war whoop you may be sure this is not me--I am still on the Robinson ranch--there, that was an unpremeditated pun; I mean the old Robinson Crusoe and I forgot that he was great-grandfather to the present Robinson twins.""""It's all right on such a night,"" replied Ed, ""but houseboats, I believe, cost money, and our camp is rented to us for the season. Oh fickle Wallie! To fall in love with a motor boat, just because her name is Pet.""""No use talking, sis,"" said Jack, ""this sail was worth being stranded for. If you are in no hurry, Ben, suppose we prolong it. Take us some place where we haven't been. You know the rounds of Cedar Lake."""
"""Now I'll tell you,"" offered Ben obligingly. ""There's a lot of strange things likely to happen to you young 'uns while you're at this here lake. So take my advice an' go slow. Every one here goes slow, and it's the best way. If you suspicion a feller don't go at him. Just wait and he will walk right into your hands,"" and Ben sounded a warning whistle as he turned a point.""He'll eat out of my hands if I get training him,"" prophesied Jack. ""But all the same, Ben, I think that's first-rate advice. It saves us much trouble and that's the most important consideration. It takes time even to polish off such a specimen.""""And when you're done, you've got dirty hands,"" went on Ben in rough philosophy. ""All the same, there is them that can't be otherwise dealt with, and when the time's ripe I'd--help myself. I know a man or two I'd like first-rate to get at, and stay at till I'd finished.""Whether Jim Peters had taken leave of his senses or was simply unreasonably angry, folks were never able to say with certainty. At any rate, now, on this evening, the man seemed furious about something. No sooner had the motor boat come up to the dock to allow Ben to land, than Peters turned upon the young fellows he had been arguing with at the island, and in unmeasured terms spoke against all gasoline water craft. He said he couldn't see why the law allowed them to use the lake, for they made such a racket, filled the air with vile odors, and scared all the fish.""You all ought to be arrested and deported!"" he stormed. ""The idea of peaceful folks being bothered with such nuisances! I'm not going to stand it if there's a law in the land! Why the idea! It's not right! I'll--"" He stopped for breath.""Now look here, Jim, you just quit!"" said Ben quietly, as the fellow started off on another tirade, using still stronger language, and almost boiling over with rage. ""Go easy,"" advised Ben. ""There's that friend of yours, Tony Jones, comin'. Take a jab at him for a change.""""It's all right now,"" spoke Cora in a low voice, and with an easier air. ""Let's go."" With pleasant words for Ben and Dan she and her friends prepared to start off again. Walter gave the flywheel a few vigorous turns, but there was only a sort of apologetic sigh from the motor."
"""We'll have to have a regular schedule--gasoline, switch, ground-wire, pet-cocks primed--oil cups up, and all that sort of thing,"" murmured Cora as they glided swiftly onward. ""I'll print it on a card and hang it near the engine.""""My word!"" exclaimed Walter a bit dubiously, ""our togs are likely locked up in the safe, and here we are, forty miles from the pile of ready-to wear habiliments that hide behind Jack's trunk! Eh, what?"" When the engine had been carefully covered, on arrival at the camp dock, and the boat securely tied up for the night, the party were all literally shaking hands in gratitude for the rescue. It was only a short distance along the shore path to where the lads ""bunked,"" but the young men shivered during the trip. The girls thought of their own coats and promptly offered them, for Walter, Ed and Jack were really suffering in their bathing suits.""Well, if you insist,"" replied Jack, ""but it seems to me we have had more than our share of bad luck for one day. First our boat is stolen, then our clothes are locked up. Who would think that that old boathouse man would go to bed so early.""""He's a picture girl,"" declared Cora laughing. ""Well, it is a good thing that we girls all wore coats when we went on the rescuing expedition. But say boys, what do you think was the trouble at the wharf? Ben seemed quite excited.""""Then let me tell you,"" and Ed slipped his arm within hers as they walked along toward Cora's camp. ""There was once a boatman and at the same time there was a philosopher. The former took the latter to sea, or to cross a small body of water, it doesn't really matter. All the way as they sailed the philosopher would say: 'Did you ever study astronomy?' The ferryman had not. 'Then half your life is gone,' said the philosopher. 'Did you ever study philosophy? No? Then another quarter of your life is gone.' And so on he went, Belle dear,"" continued Ed, ""until suddenly the boatman interrupted him with: 'Say, did you ever study swimming?' And the philosopher admitted that he had not. 'Then,' said the boatman, 'the whole of your life is gone for this boat is sinking!' So you see, Belle, our boatman might have given us that little fairy story and charged accordingly.""Then she stopped. She had no idea of telling the boys that they had followed Jim Peters with the hope of finding the missing ones whither he would lead them. Bess and Belle also had taken pains not to betray their story to the boys, for, as Cora said, Jim Peters was not a man to quarrel with, and the stolen boat was not a matter to joke about."
"The boys really did look funny in the girls' long coats, but it all added to the merry-making. Paul Hastings was waiting outside the bungalow. He stood where the porch light fell upon him, and the girls all secretly agreed that he had grown handsomer since they had last seen him. Hazel, too, looked very attractive in her plain blue dress, with its turn-over collar and Windsor tie.By this time Hazel and Paul saw the queer attire of the three young men. Then a part of the situation was explained. The bungalow was one of those roomy affairs, built with a clear idea of affording every summer comfort. Cora was to be the hostess, and with her was the trusted maid, Nettie. There the girls were to visit as they chose, while the boys had taken a camp for themselves near the fishing grounds of the big lake.""Who tried to do you?"" answered Ed, in no pleasant tones. ""See here, Peters! This is not our camp, and we don't carry money in our bathing suits as we told you before. If you can't wait until to-morrow for the seventy-five cents you know what you can do.""She went into her room and got her purse. It was a pretty little affair, too frail to have been brought to camp, and too good to have left in the locked-up Chelton house. As she went back to Ed she held out the purse. ""Here,"" she said, ""take it and help yourself. My coffee will boil over.""At this Ed stepped to the door to ask for a box, while Peters hurried down the steps to look for the missing trinket. When Ed came back with a light Peters was looking industriously for the purse, but declared he had not seen it.""Now see here, Peters,"" cried Ed angrily. ""You have picked up that purse, and I want you to hand it right over here,"" and Ed dropped the cloak from his shoulders. ""If you don't I'll teach you a lesson.""Jim Peters was fairly roaring now. He was strong, but this young giant was a surprise to him, and after the way of the cowardly class, as soon as he found out he would be bested he ""quit,"" and begged off.""My ring,"" cried Cora. ""I had my ring--oh no. I forgot--that was not the purse,"" and Cora went in doors, presently returning with some small coins. ""Here, Ed,"" she said, her voice trembling. ""Do pay that man, and let him go. I--I am so frightened!"""
"""Hush,"" cautioned the other girl. ""Let us try to make things brighter. Since that man sailed down the lake to-day with our boys' canoe we have had nothing but mishaps. Now let him go. I'll manage to reckon with him without endangering the life of anyone. He's too desperate a character to deal with in the ordinary way. Remember what Ben told us."" There had been three delightful days at Camp Cozy. Cora managed most of the delight, with the able assistance of Belle and Bess, while Hazel did much toward discovering things that she declared all the girls ought to know, for Hazel's happiness was ever in obtaining knowledge.The boys had almost lost hope of getting back their canoe. They had searched the lake from shore to shore, offered rewards and had gone through the rest of the lost formula, but the boat was not returned.Passing Center Landing, Cora called a pleasant good morning to Ben, who sat on the end string piece, his feet aiming at the water and his broad brimmed hat caught on halo fashion at the back of his neck.""Well a hour ago he went up the lake. He goes up there every mornin' regular. Like as if he had some important business on the island. When I asked him about it he said there was a fellow who had some dangerous disease, and was campin' out there, and Jim allowed that he had to fetch him things.""""It's quite a trip down the lake. Then you come to a point. Go to the left of the point, and when you come to a place where the willows dip into the lake, get off there. The shack is straight back in the deepest clump of buttonball trees.""""All right Ben, and thank you,"" said Cora as she started up the motor. ""I feel like exploring this morning, and your directions sound interesting. I will come back this way to show you that I am safe and sound,"" and with that she sheered off.Under a big willow, in a sort of natural basket seat, formed by the uncovered roots of the big trees, a man sat, and as the boat grazed the shore, he looked up from some papers he held in his hands. Cora could see that he was very dark, and had that almost uncomfortable manner of affecting extreme politeness peculiar to foreigners of certain classes, for, as she spoke to him, he arose, slid the paper into his pocket, and bowed most profusely.""Mr. Jones?"" he repeated. ""Well, that name will do as well as any other. But allow me to tie your boat. Then I will take pleasure in showing you one of the prettiest strips of land this side of Naples."""
"""But you will only hurt your feet miss,"" objected the man. ""Allow me to show you the island,"" and he bowed again. ""Such wild swamp flowers I have never seen. It is the everglades, and well worth the short journey.""There was something about his insistent civility that betokened a set purpose, and since Ben (what a wonder Ben was) had told Cora that a man named Jones ""hung out"" with Jim Peters, Cora instantly guessed that this was the man, and that he was determined to keep her away from the shack. The situation gave zest to her purpose. Bess was fairly quaking as Cora could see, but what danger could there be in insisting upon finding that shack?""I have only a short time to be out,"" objected Cora, ""and perhaps some other time I will come to see your everglade. Come, Bess, I see a path this way, and I fancy if we follow it we will find an end to the path,"" she concluded.They hurried away from the dark-browed man. He took his hand out of his pocket and upon the smallest finger his eyes rested. He sneered as he looked at a diamond ring that glittered on that slim brown finger.""I thought so myself, Bess. But we do not have to plant his family tree. Now don't be a baby, girlie,"" and Cora squeezed the plump hand that hung so close to her own. ""Let us get to the shack, and see if the boys' boat is about there. I am determined to run down Jim Peters.""""Yes and the boat belongs to Peters. There! He is surely the one who helps Jim out in all his affairs. Now we may seek the shack in safety,"" said Cora, as she watched the man at the water's edge push off. ""I know the shack is over there, for I smell smoke in that direction. But we will turn the other way until he has cleared off,"" finished Cora as she and Bess stepped lightly over the dainty ferns that nestled in the damp earth.""Yes, he must have been brought up near the water,"" replied Cora. ""They say such skill as that is not accomplished on dry land. Jack always declared he could tell a fellow at college who had ever been near the water when a lad. They take to it like a duck.""""All right, dear,"" replied Cora, in a voice for Bess alone. ""But, Mrs. Peters, can you tell me when your husband will be about here? I have some work to do on a boat and I understand he does that sort of thing."""
"""He's Jim's side partner. Say, girl, I'll just tell you. I came up here a few weeks ago from a newspaper advertisement. I never knowed Jim Peters before, but if them two fellers think I'm goin' to cook in that hut and never go no place off this dock they're foolin' themselves. They don't know all about Kate Simpson.""""You are quite right,"" she said. ""This is no place for a lone woman, and some day when I have my brother along I will fetch my boat, and show you the big islands about here. It would do you good to get out in the clear--away from these dense woods.""""Well, to tell the truth my mother and Jim's was cousins, but I never knowed him to be such a poor character as he is, or I'd never have come up here. But I don't have to stay all summer,""' she finished significantly.""She is queer, but I think she knows a lot about things of interest to us. What did you think of her remark about Fern Island? To that pretty little spot we will make our next voyage,"" declared Cora, pulling on her thick gloves and taking her place in front of the motor. ""Turn out into the open lake,"" she told Bess as they started off. ""We will make a quick run and get back to the bungalow before the others have done the marketing. I am glad it is not our turn to get the lunch for I want to make a trip to Fern Island directly after we have had a bite. Seems to me,"" and she increased the speed of the engine a little, ""it takes more time to get a meal at camp than it does at home. The simple life certainly has its own peculiar complications."" The four motor girls started out in the Petrel. Never had the lake seemed so beautiful, nor had the sky appeared a deeper, truer blue. The pretty Placid lake was dotted all over with summer craft, the sound of the motor boat being almost constant in its echoing, ""cut-a-cuta"" against the wonderful green hills that banked shore and, island.Hazel was steering, and of course Cora was running the engine. The pennant waved gaily from the bow of the boat, and of the many colors afloat it seemed that those chosen by the motor girls shone out most brilliantly on the glistening, silvery waters.""Yes,"" said Cora, ""the water has a peculiar fascination when one is accustomed to it, and I am sure Belle will want to live on a houseboat before we break camp. There go the boys! What a fine motor boat!""""Yes,"" said Hazel, ""that's one from Paul's garage. Paul promised Jack he would speak to Mr. Breslin, the owner, about letting it out for the summer, as the Breslin family is not coming out here until later. It's the Peter-Pan, and the fastest boat on the lake.""""No, it was over there, but I guess we will put in at the front of the island, as there is no telling how deep the cove is,"" said Cora. ""But see that girl go! Why she's actually gone! Where can she have disappeared to?"""
"""Maybe that is the 'Haunt Girl of Fern Island,'"" ventured Cora with a laugh. ""I got a pretty good look at her, and I am willing to say she looked neither like a summer girl nor a winter girl--that is, one who might live here the year around. But just what sort of girl she might be I shouldn't like to speculate. Her hair got loose as she hurried, and she reminded me of some wild water bird.""All were ashore but Bess, and as such things often happen when they are looked for, the Petrel did careen from the waves of a passing launch, and just as Bess grasped an overhead willow branch, the boat swung out and she sprang in. Everybody laughed, but Bess lost her breath, a condition she disliked because it always added to the deep color of her plump cheeks.""Isn't this perfectly delightful!"" exclaimed Hazel, running over the soft earth where ferns were matted, and wild flowers grew tangled in their efforts for freedom. ""I never saw such dainty little flowers! Oh! they are sabatial I have seen them in Massachusetts,"" and she fell to gathering the small pink blooms that rival the wild rose in shade and perfume.He had stopped just long enough to look in the direction of Cora. She saw him distinctly. Oh! if he should run toward Bess or Belle! Hazel would not be so easily alarmed but surely this was a wild man if ever there was such a creature.""Oh, I think we had best not this time,"" said Cora quickly. ""I really want to get to the post office landing before the mail goes out. We can come another time when I have something to kill spiders with. I never saw such huge black fellows as there are around here."" This was no shading of the truth, for indeed the spiders around Cedar Lake did grow like 'turtles', Jack had declared.""Oh, all right,"" agreed Belle. ""But this is the most delightful island and I am coming out here again. I hope the boys will come along, for there are such great bushes of huckleberries over there that we simply couldn't climb to them alone.""'""We will invite them next time,"" said Cora, and when she turned over the fly wheel of her boat her hands that had held the ferns were still trembling. She looked uneasily at the shore as they darted off.""He might like to try a motor, I said,"" replied Cora. ""They say that Jim Peters tries everything on Cedar Lake, even to running a shooting gallery. But see! He is reading a letter! Where ever did he get a letter on this barren island?"""
"""Yes, but I feel sure of finding it. Now, Jackie dear, please don't cross question me. I shouldn't have taken it off, but I did, so and that is how I came to lose it. But I want to tell you something while we are alone. I saw the ghost of Fern Island to-day.""""Well I want to tell you. We were on the island-the girls and I--and I got a little away from them when suddenly the wildest looking man rushed across the path. He had a beard like Rip Van Winkle and looked a lot like him too.""""Rip might be summering out this way, though I rather thought he had taken a trip in an airship,"" said Jack. ""But honestly, Cora, what was the man like? Paul had a story of that sort. He declares he, too, saw this famous ghost.""""Do you suppose he might have taken the canoe? The wild man I mean. We saw a strange looking girl in a canoe and somehow she vanished. We could see her boat and then we couldn't, although we could not make out where she went to. It was the queerest thing. There must be some strange curves on those islands.""""Well, everyone around here declares that is land is haunted, but fisher-folk are always so superstitious. Yet we must hunt it up. I will go out with you the next time you go. Did the other girls see him?"" went on the brother.""No, and I decided not to tell them. You know how timid Bess and Belle are, and if they thought there was such a creature about the island I would never get them to put foot on shore there again, and I do so want to investigate that matter. I believe Jim Peters has something to do with it for I saw him coming away from there with a letter. Now what would he be doing with a letter out on a barren island?""""Yes, we had planned to go. That is why I am dressed up. Hazel may have to go to town to-morrow, and I want her to see something before she goes,"" replied Cora, just as the girls, and Walter, Ed and Paul strode up to the bungalow."
"""I promised--crossed my heart not to tell,"" said Walter. ""But all the same the folks at the landing are talking about the pretty girl who went all the way up the cove, and stopped at the place where Peters and his pal land. I would advise you to be careful. They say that tribe is not of the best social standing,"" went on Walter quite seriously.""Let me tell it,"" Belle exclaimed. ""We were just standing by the boathouse, watching some men fish, when Jim Peters, came along. He stopped and took a paper out of his pocket. The wind suddenly blew up--""""Angry! He fairly fell upon poor Dan,"" put in Walter, ""and when Ben saw him--I tell you Ben may stand a lot of trouble on his own account, but, when it comes to anyone trying to do Dan, Ben is right there to fight for him. Didn't he almost put Jim over the rail?""""Jim took his old letter and slunk off,"" finished Belle. ""And Dan said he couldn't have read even the name on the out side if he had tried. He said it must have been written in Greek,"" and Belle laughed at the idea of the classics getting mixed up in any such small affair.""And the Blake girls are going to sing,"" announced Jack. ""Then I shall have a chance to clap my hands at pretty Mabel,"" and he went, through one of those inimitable boys' pranks, neither funny nor tragic, but just descriptive.They started off for the path that led to the public pavilion on the lake shore. Cora was with Ed, Walter had Belle on one side and Bess on the other, because he declared that the twins should always go together to ""balance"" him. Jack and Hazel led the way.At the pavilion the seats were almost all occupied, for campers from all sides of the lake flocked there on the entertainment evenings. A band was dreaming over some tune, each musician evidently being his own leader.The elder Miss Blake, Jeannette, who sat on an end seat, arose as they entered and made room for the Chelton folks to sit beside her, meanwhile gushing over the prospect of the evening's good time, and the good luck of ""meeting girls from home.""""Oh I--"" then she stopped. Something in Walter's voice told her that it was not the window draft he was referring to. She glanced across the room, and her eyes fell upon the man she had met at Jim Peter's landing place.""I will stay here with Hazel, while you and Wallie go over there with the girls,"" suggested Jack. ""And say Wallie,"" he whispered, ""if I catch you fanning that young lady in the row ahead I'll--duck you on the way home.""Walter apologized profusely for leaving Miss Blake. She evidently was sorry that the window had been open for she was ""so enjoying talking of dear old Chelton."" The place had only been thus mentioned by herself."
"The curtain rising interrupted the speculation. A man cushioned like a cozy corner laughed at himself while waiting for his audience to do so. Then he gave a yell and started to sing a ridiculous song about the milkmaid and the summer boarder. When he had finished one verse he took another ""fit"" of laughter, but somehow the audience did not see it his way, and when he tried it again, he broke off with an explanation. He felt sure that the people did not quite understand the joke, and he tried to tell them how very funny it was. To relieve the situation another person came on. One side of the figure was draped in the evening garb of a lady, while the other wore the full dress suit of a gentleman. The illusion was not at all bad, especially when the ""person"" waltzed with himself, with his arms around the other side of the evening dress the effect was really funny.Applause instantly greeted Mabel, and Jack was not the one who first tired of clapping his hands. This pleased Miss Jeannette immensely, and she did not fail to express her pleasure to those about her.The dark man in the seat across the aisle glanced first at the stage and then at the seat where the elderly lady sat. Jack was watching him, and noted his peculiar glances. Presently Mabel started to sing. Her voice was sweet, and her stage manners attractive.Just as he said that, a boy appeared on the platform and announced that owing to an important message Miss Blake was obliged to leave the hall and could not accommodate with her second number, but that some one else would try to fill her place. Cora, healthy though she was, did not sleep well that night. Jack did not return to the hall, and had left word with the doorkeeper that he could not get back in time to see his sister but would run up from his bungalow early the next morning. It was early now, and next morning, but Jack had not kept his word.""It was so strange, the way that man acted,"" said Hazel to Cora, as the two made their way to the spring for fresh water. ""First he watched you, then when Mabel Blake appeared he kept his eye on her. And such eyes! I believe he could hypnotize any one.""""Nothing could be more satisfactory,"" declared Cora, ""unless it would be having a sister besides. I have often wondered what I should have done if I had not had such splendid girl friends. Do you feel as if a sister would have made your life more complete?""""It's better than the shack I've been living in,"" murmured the woman. ""I'm done with that. Here,"" and she slipped her hand in her dress, carefully taking from a patched place in her skirt a small article. ""This is yours--I know it!""""Well I'll tell you this much, miss,"" and Kate Simpson glanced furtively around her, to make sure that no one might be approaching. ""If there ever was two bigger villains than Jim Peters and Tony whatever-his-other-name-is-if-he's-got one, then I never heard tell of them. They're up to some new trick every day and another new one every night. But the worst--"""
"""I heard them say so, and now that the other girl is gone I'll tell you this much. Never you go over to that shack again,"" and the woman raised a warning finger. ""It was a good thing you met me instead of Jim Peters the day you did go over. They'll be like tigers when they find I've got the ring. It was last night that gave me the chance. They had been out very late, and Tony didn't have any letters to copy so he fell asleep and--and I slipped away with it. I slept a bit under a tree, but indeed I was glad to see daylight.""""And you have been out all night? You must not think of taking a journey without first having something to eat. If you are afraid to come up to camp I'll have something put in the boat for you,"" declared Cora. ""But let me ask you, did you overhear anything about a girl named Miss Blake? I saw Jones leave a hall where she was singing last night, and I suspect he met her as she went out. My brother followed, but I have not seen him since. He stops at the boys' camp,"" Cora explained.The truth flashed into Cora's mind. That man somehow knew the Blakes. He was pretending to place little vain Mabel with some theatrical company. When he left the Casino it was to show her the bogus message. And Jack must have been somewhere around within hearing distance. Surely things were getting complicated and mysterious in the summer colony. But Cora had her ring back, and for the rest she felt certain that the ""ghost"" of Fern Island, also the wild looking girl of whom they had gotten a glimpse, were in some way being wronged by Jim Peters and his associate, the handwriting expert.""No, indeed. That would be a dangerous thing to do, for I now have every part clear. I have put on a bigger oil cup, have had the water circulation increased so the engine can not heat so, I have had a throttle control put up at the steering wheel so that I can slow down from there, and I tell you, Jackie, I have worked out the secrets of that engine until there are no more.""""I should say you had, sis. I never knew there were so many attachments. Well, I know I can depend upon you to keep up the honor of the Kimball family. Come along fellows. Let's see that the Peter Pan is not done by the 'Peter Petrel.' I noticed she was puffing out a lot of oil this morning as we came over."""
"""Come now, no more nonsense,"" ordered Cora. ""If we are to race we have to get ready."" A few hours later Cedar Lake was alive with craft. The rowboats and canoes were lined up first and our friends from Chelton, the girls in the Petrel and the boys in the Peter Pan, kept a sharp look out for the lost canoe. Of course they knew it would be repainted, but the lines being different from those of other boats they hoped to be able to distinguish it, should it appear for the races.The judges had taken their places. The platform at the Point was gaily decorated for the occasion, and all sorts of banners were flying. The course was to cover one mile, and it ran clear out into the open lake so that the delightful view was unobstructed.There were many green boats, all having Indian names, and there were those of wood in the natural color. Girls vied with boys in point of numbers, and had it all their own way in point of attractiveness.For some moments no one spoke. All attention was riveted on the graceful canoes that so motionlessly covered the deep blue lake. The dip of the paddles was the only sign of movement although the dainty boats were making good time in covering the courses. Suddenly when all others had left and were off a light canoe shot out from some place, and a girl with her hair flying, and dressed most peculiarly, started off after them all.In a few seconds those who had so mysteriously entered, the race were far up in the line with those who had first started. The girl was wonderfully graceful, and the man showed marked skill at the paddle. He was trying to keep close to her, that was evident, but at a cheer from the shore and from the outlying boats the girl shot ahead and was soon out of hearing of the man, who evidently was her companion.A red canoe was alongside the girl in the light one. For a few moments it seemed she would be outdone. Then, with a clever light dip of her paddle, that scarcely seemed to touch the water, the Fern Island girl was again ahead.Then there was an exchange of words understandable only to those expressing them, and to those for whom they were expressed, but any one might have guessed that the boys in the Peter Pan were asking the girls in the Petrel to let them ""meet"" the wild bird of the light canoe.For one brief second the wild-looking girl turned in the direction from which the voices had come. Hats were waved to her, handkerchiefs flaunted and then she paddled--paddled straight ahead and came into the finish first!But he did not. The girl in the light canoe turned from the spectators as if she had been deaf and dumb. And it was the dark man--the fellow called Tony Jones--who went up to the judges to get their verdict. ""We have no time now,"" Jack told Cora, ""but as soon as the races are over I will ask what that fellow told the judges. Certainly he must have said that he had a right to, the girl's prize, or they would not have given it to him.""""But how the poor thing hurried off! Why, she hardly had a chance to know that she won,"" replied the sister. ""I think it a shame that the creature should be treated like something really wild,"" and she turned to watch the foamy wake that the little canoe was tracing, as the girl from Fern Island hurried to hide herself again where ever she might go. The signal precluded the possibility of further interest just then in the strange case, but indeed Cora's mind was not so readily shifted. She wanted to know about that girl."
"The speed boats were next to be tried out. What a splendid showing! Who would have dreamed that such handsome craft were on the waters of Cedar Lake? Of course they were all private boats, and their flags flaunted proudly before the spellbound spectators.The Peter Pan was among the very finest. In this were our boy friends from Chelton, and as they lined up the admiration expressed was unstinted. The Sprint was another splendid speed boat, built with torpedo stern and a queer spray hood at the bow. This was being run by a girl--a young lady noted for her skill at any sort of motor.""They have a good chance,"" argued Cora. ""Of course so many things may happen that there is absolutely no surety of any machinery on the water."" She looked to see that the oil cup levers of the Petrel were down to prevent the lubricant flowing before it was needed and also gave a critical survey of the little wire that connected on the cylinder. It emitted a clear ""fat"" spark as she touched it to the metal, and this seemed to satisfy her.He was standing over the engine evidently making sure that even at the start he should not loose a single atom of the power that twirled the propeller. Ed was at the steering wheel. Walter was at the side, and with him was Paul Hastings.""He wouldn't want any other to beat the Peter Pan,"" explained Hazel, ""and at the same time he would not take the glory of it from the boys who have it for the season. That's Paul,"" she finished proudly.The first ""leg"" of the course had been covered, and the three best boats, the Peter Pan, the Sprint, and the Lady B. were all in line. A dozen others were trailing, and while they showed less speed it was not safe to say that they could not catch up with the three stars. From buoy to buoy over the triangular course the boats fairly shot, and a beautiful sight they made on the green-hilled basin of Cedar Lake.The course was covered once and then the second round was started by the boats that had qualified. These were only five in number, one of them being a very queer looking craft, built high on the sides like a huge box and showing at the bow a double point, like a pair of slippers. This of course attracted considerable attention, and it shot past the Sprint, which was run by the young lady who had hoped to meet with no rival such as a home-made boat, to say the least.During the second and third trials all interest was centered on the Peter Pan, the Hague, (the home-made boat), and the Sprint. Now this would be ahead, and now that, until it seemed that there could be but little difference in the merits of any of the three. Of course most of the sympathy was with the Sprint, because a girl was striving to outdo the boys. At the same time, the Hague, being such an oddity, and the lake folks knowing that this had been built by the boys who were running it, came in for its share of applause.The Peter Pan shot out bravely and safely. The Sprint made a splendid second! Then the Hague! Something seemed wrong. It was ""missing."" That could plainly be heard from the girl's boat. Away they flew, yard after yard being made in wonderfully short time. The Sprint was doing well with the Peter Pan. The Hague suddenly shot forward, passed every thing--passed the Sprint--passed the Peter Pan and won!"
"So keen was the disappointment of the girls in the Petrel that they seem to have lost heart for their own race, which came next. But when Ed and Jack called out to them, and Paul waved his cap in his own quiet way, the encouragement dispelled their lost of interest.Cora spun the flywheel, and the boat took its place. She looked every inch a girl to win, while Hazel kept close to the steering wheel and the twins did their part in just looking pretty. The motor girls' boat was the cynosure of every eye, as it happened to be the only boat in that class run by girls.He should hardly have done this, but his boyish love for the girls and their boat could not be restrained. Then they waved, and the maroon and white flag stood out tense and defiant like some animate thing.""Look out!"" called Hazel suddenly and a boat crossed their path so closely that Cora was obliged to throttle down, and Hazel had to run straight for a buoy to avoid a collision, and the craft hit the course marker. Then the Petrel stopped short! It simply wouldn't move!""Short circuited!"" she exclaimed. ""That happened when we struck the buoy. It jarred the battery wires together,"" and the next instant she had adjusted the difficulty and the engine, glad to be off again, seemed to try to make up for the lost seconds.""We will make up for it,"" declared Cora, throwing on full speed and directing Hazel as to the best way to hold the wheel exactly straight and in doing so to get all possible distance out of each explosion of the engine.Two more courses were to finish the race, unless there was another tie. The girls scarcely noticed the frantic efforts of the boys in the Peter Pan who were encouraging and directing at the top of their lungs. The young men in the Mischief were anxious. They could never stand it to be beaten by a couple of country girls! But, on the second trial Cora's boat won, and then came the final test.""Plucky girls,"" said another of the men at the stand. ""Whatever happened when they stopped they must have been well able to handle, from the way they caught up again. I thought they were out of it that time!""The Mischief was close alongside. Cora was clinging to the side of the boat from which the child had dropped, while the almost fainting mother was recovering her little one. The others assisted Cora in, and forgot all about her race.The Mischief had gained in the time that Cora swung overboard, and now was just abreast of the Petrel. The slight change of course also told in the last few yards, but now Hazel and Bess forgot everything but the call of Cora to win, and their boat, like a flash, sprang up to its opponent and passed it by the closest record made in any of the races. ""Wasn't it exciting!"" Belle was saying to the little party that had gathered around Cora as she received their praise and congratulations after it was all over. ""I never dreamed that boat races could furnish so many kinds of excitement."""
"""I don't call it all delightful,"" objected Bess putting her arms around the still wet form of the girl who had made the rescue, ""and I don't want to see Cora jump overboard that way again. I shall never forget it.""""Your cup is a beauty though, sis,"" said Jack, who was examining the trophy. ""I think it's prettier than the one we lost. Paul is not satisfied that we lost fairly though, and he's up there now disputing it.""""Not until I charged them with it,"" replied Paul. ""I knew there was something up when they got ahead on that jump. Then I asked if I might take a look at that freak engine, and they allowed me to do so. I smelled camphor the minute I stepped aboard. They even had not sense enough to hide the bottle, and it's against the present racing rules on this lake to doctor gas. So I taxed them with it, and they finally admitted it and we went together to the judges. They were pretty decent chaps and did not seem to mind, very much, relinquishing the prize. You know what it is, don't you?""""It's a wonder the mother of that little girl didn't want to adopt you, Cora,"" said Jack, as the boys started off with Paul. ""I thought from the way she hung on to you she had intentions. Well, so long. We will give you first ride in our new canoe, and let us hope we will have better luck with this one than we had with the other,"" and then the boys went off for the prize.""Well, now we have a double interest on Fern Island,"" Cora answered. ""If there is really such an unfortunate creature hid or hiding there she ought to be rescued. I cannot understand, either, how that foreigner can be her guardian.""""They are almost dry now,"" Cora replied. ""Yet if you could wait five minutes I could easily change in that time. Here we are. Home again. And there! Nettie has heard all about our victories; haven't you Nettie?""""The--that--man!"" she stammered. ""But I must go back to Jeannette. I am afraid she is losing her mind. Of course, you could not go with me, Cora. It would be too much after your hard afternoon. But Jeannette got your letter."""
"""There you are. One woman who might put him in jail flies off to New York. You could at least accuse him of fraud and you refuse. I myself know of one wrong doing that affected me and I prefer to keep quiet--for the present at least. You see what cowards we all are where our pride is concerned. The interview with Miss Jeannette Blake was not altogether satisfactory, but Cora was too careful of the sick one's feelings to ask deliberate questions. She could not really find out how far the Blakes had gone with Tony Jones in the matter of paying him for the alleged placement of Mabel with a theatrical company, but she guessed they had either actually paid a large sum, or had given a note that might be equally compelling.It was the day after the races, and Cora sat with her brother on the porch of their bungalow. She had told him of Mabel's plight and was asking him to help her clear up some of the shades and shadows.""Tell me, Jack,"" she asked, ""what happened the night you followed Mabel out of the pavilion--the night that man gave her the false message?"" Jack thrust his hands deep into his pockets, and looked very serious--for him. ""To tell the truth, Cora,"" he began, ""I had to make love to Mabel to get her out of his clutches.""""But didn't you ask me to? Didn't you say to watch Mabel that time you whispered as I was leaving? You are the funny one. It was you that put the wicked plot in my fair young head,"" and he sighed in mock sincerity.""Jack, don't be silly! I want you to wire the editor of the Chelton paper that, owing to the sudden illness of Miss Jeannette Blake, her niece, Miss Mabel Blake, has been compelled to stop her musical studies, and postpone her debut as a singer. That is all true and if the other notice does appear you can arrange to have this given as the latest.""""Foxy!"" declared jack. ""'Not a word of fib and not a grain of truth. Well, you would beat Jones if you went at his game, but I do think it a good idea to wire Nat Phillips. I'll go and do so at once,"" he added, feeling in his pocket to make sure he had with him change enough to pay for the message.""And Jack,"" Cora went on, ""since you have been so good, don't you think it would be lovely for you to sort of keep track of Mabel for a day or two? That man, I am afraid, has her under some sort of influence, and there is no telling what he might not try to do to get some Blake money.""""I really cannot explain it all, Jack,"" said Cora gravely, ""but the man has frightened more than Mabel. The woman who kept house for him and Peters was so afraid that he would find out she was leaving, that I could scarcely persuade her to wait while I changed the batteries in my boat. She kept saying she wanted to get out of his power. And now Mabel declares he had her hypnotized. Then that sort of queer girl who won the canoe race--surely he has her somehow in his power, as they express it."""
"Cora sat there silent for a few moments. There was no one about the camp but herself, and she would soon go down to the lake for a run in her boat. She was thinking that of all the peculiar cases of other people's troubles in which she felt she had a right to interfere that of the girl who was said to be deaf and dumb and who was probably hidden somewhere on Fern Island was the case most urgent. If only she could really find her, and find that poor demented old man who had so strangely crossed her path. Cora had not the least fear of either of them and suddenly she resolved to go alone to Fern Island and try to find them.Her heart beat quickly as she throttled down her engine, stopped it, and finally stepped ashore. Her landing was made on a different side of the island than before and she saw instantly that feet had been treading down the ferns from shore to inland. This path served to guide her along. Then she noticed particles of food. ""He's gone!"" Cora murmured, as creeping out from her hiding place, she could see that the rowboat had left the shore. ""Well, I am safe again, for I have not the slightest fear of any one who may be on this island--now.""She listened. Yes, that was a sob and in a girl's weak voice. Cora quickened her steps, and forgetting now to watch the path she was covering, forgetting all except that a human creature must be in pain, and that she could probably help that person. Cora Kimball almost ran until she reached the hill, where she saw a sort of screen made from the broken branches of trees.As Cora pushed her way into the queer cave, the girl turned, and seeing her, screamed--such a scream as one might expect from the insane. At the same moment the brush was again pushed from the door and there stood the wild man! His white hair and his white beard showed Cora that he was the same person who had so strangely crossed her path in the woods the day she was fern-gathering.""Help?"" whispered the man, and his voice was as gentle and soft as a woman's. ""They have killed my girl,"" and he knelt down beside the prostrate figure. He kissed her passionately. Then she opened her eyes.What could she do? What should she do? This girl was neither deaf nor dumb, and for that Cora was grateful, but if that dangerous man, who had said she was both, should return, and find Cora with her!Then Cora saw that she was becoming unconscious. Feeling about the half-dark cave place Cora came upon a pail of water. Beside it was a tin cup and this she filled and carried to the sick girl's lips."
"""Yes, a friend,"" Cora assured her, ""and I am going to prove it to you. I saw you one day as we--some girls and myself came to this island. Then I saw you win that splendid race, and since then I have been determined to find you.""""No matter,"" she said calmly. ""I feel so much better with a girl to speak to, that if you will put up with my strange life for a night, perhaps it will be all right in the morning. There,"" as Cora showed by her change of color that she felt it would be a risk, ""lots of people think sleeping, out of doors is the very best sort of life. Don't you want to try it?""' and her arm stole around Cora's waist.""When I refused to go with him, he said I might die here,"" replied Laurel. ""That was to get more money from father. Oh, you cannot know how I have wished to speak with some one!"" and her big, brown eyes filled with tears.""Perhaps in the morning we may be able to go,"" Laurel said. ""Now that I have made up my mind I feel it will be better for father as well as for me, for if anything happened to me I fear he would die.""Cora felt the other's frail body trembling as she put her own strong arms around the shrinking girl. Then Cora peered from the door of the hut. Still that stealthy footstep till the approach of that unknown. Cora felt as if she must scream, yet she held her fears in check--not so much for her own sake as for the other.""There are no bears on this island,"" replied her companion with a wan smile--""no animals bigger than coons, and they couldn't make so much a noise. Besides, I heard him grunt, or moan, as he fell. So it must have been a man.""""Well, he's gone,"" rejoined Cora, ""and, now that he's left us alone I'm going to hope that he didn't hurt himself. He interrupted our supper and now it's time we finished it,"" and in the dim light of the lantern they ate the coarse food and waited--waited for what would happen next. ""I know something has happened to Cora,"" Hazel was lamenting, ""and I am afraid we have lost good time in not going with the boys. Let us get ready at once. Here Bess and Belle, you take these lanterns, Nettie carry matches--and take a strong mountain stick, and--""""To make our way with,"" replied the practical Hazel. ""It is not easy to get about in woods on a dark night like this,"" and she gave a look at the lights to make sure they were all right. ""The boys were to send word here, or to leave word with Ben if they found her. Now let's hurry."""
"It was a sad little party that started off from Camp Cozy. When, that evening, according to the note Cora had left on the hanging lamp, she did not appear, for some little time, there was scarcely any anxiety. Cora was so reliable, and of course they could conjecture a dozen things that might have detained her. But when an hour passed, and she then was not to be found, Jack jumped up, Ed and Walter followed, and as they hurried off, left the word that through Ben, or by message to camp, they would report to the girls.The thought of the man Jones flashed through Hazel's mind. And he had threatened Cora. She had interfered in taking away Kate, the house keeper, she had found out about the man and girl on Fern Island, and she had saved little Mabel Blake! Now all that--There were many small boats dotted about the water, and the girls looked keenly for the flag of the Petrel which they could have distinguished even in the darkness for the white head-light always showed up its maroon and white, but old Ben took no heed of the craft in the lower end of the cove. He headed straight for either Far or Fern Island--the twin spots of land far away.Ben did not reply. He had recognized the other craft as that belonging to Jim Peters, and guessed that the man might be up to some trick. When he had almost stopped his motor he jumped up and peered into the rowboat.""The best way to find her is to make sure that he does not find her first,"" said Ben. ""She's all right so long as we keep her away from her enemies,"" and he turned the boat down the lake toward the landing. From the finding of Cora's boat to the landing at Fern Island the boys lost little time. Somehow Jack felt the night's work had to do with the hermit and his daughter; also he feared that the man Jones might know of it, so that he lost no time in hurrying to the far end of the lake in hope of there finding his sister.Few words were spoken by the three boys as they landed, took the lanterns from the motor boat, and after detaching the batteries, to make sure no one would run off with the craft, they sought a path in the wilderness.""It's--er--"" Jack paused suddenly. On the envelope he had caught, in the light of a slanting ray from a lantern a girl's name--""Laurel."" He had been on the point of taking the missive from its cover, but the glimpse of that name prevented him. Somehow he felt that it might have to do with the disappearance of Cora--she was always getting mixed up with girls, he reflected. And it might not be just the best thing to publish broadcast what this was Jack dissimulated.""I guess it's some shooting license a hunter has dropped,"" he completed his half-finished sentence. ""I'll just stick it in my pocket until we get to a place where I can look at it better. I might lose something from the envelope in the woods. Come on, boys.""Together they dashed through the bushes, trampling the underbrush beneath their feet. The lanterns they carried gave but poor light and more than once they crashed into trees. But they kept on, stopping now and then to call again and listen for the answer."
"""Come on!"" shouted Ed, and they changed their course. Five minutes more of difficult going, for they had gotten off the path, brought them to the pine hut. In the doorway stood two girls with their arms about each other.""Oh, I almost forgot,"" she replied. ""Boys, this is Laurel--Wild Laurel if you like. Laurel, these are the boys, including my brother. You can easily tell who he is,"" she added dryly. ""More formal introductions can wait.""""Tell us what happened,"" demanded Jack, and then Cora briefly related what had taken place since she came to the island, how she had discovered the loss of her boat and had found Laurel and the old hermit. She told of their parting from Laurel's father and how she and her companion had returned to the hut.""And then--then some one came toward the hut after we got here,"" she finished. ""And, oh, how frightened we were! But whoever it was went away again and didn't bother us. Then we ate something and--and well, you know the rest.""""It's all right,"" Ed soothed, realizing that both girls had been terribly frightened. ""We just came from the lake by your path. It's splendid to find you Cora,"" and he went over to press her hand. ""And I am sure you and your friend are glad to be found.""And then Jack, seeing a good chance, slipped into Laurel's hand the envelope he had picked up in the woods. The girl started, stared at him for a moment, and then hid the missive from sight. She did not speak, but looked her thanks to Jack.So happy were the girls to get away and to be in such safe company, that the shock and exhaustion following it were almost forgotten. Cora felt much stronger, and so did Laurel. They looked like two very much tossed and tousled girls, but the boys were not thinking of their looks just then.""But the water is just as friendly as ever,"" declared Jack. ""Now let us try it."" He untied the boat, and the party stepped in. Cora pressed Laurel's hand in silent encouragement for she saw her turning her eyes toward Fern Island.""Well, that's what some say. I don't rightly know. Guess it didn't amount to much. Anyhow they've got Peters over there in his boat. They're bringing him to a doctor. It seems Tony whacked him with a boat hook, and then, thinking he'd done serious damage, he leaped overboard and swam for it. They can't find him."""
"""And I don't believe they ever will,"" put in another voice, and as a second boat came up Cora recognized old Ben. ""Ah, it's Miss Kimball and her friends,"" he added as he saw Cora and those in the Petrel. ""Now here's a chance for you to use your brains, Miss Cora. Can't you find Tony for us?""He rowed over toward where the other boats were congregated and the Petrel with the slow progress of which he had been keeping pace, swung on to the dock. Cora and the others could see the return of the little flotilla about the boat in which was Jim Peters. It takes but a small happening to furnish excitement for a small place, and the fact that Jim and Tony had quarreled, and that near the landing, created quite a buzz. Of course, much disliked as Jim was, he was one of the regular fishermen, while Tony was a comparative stranger. This caused the latter to disappear when he saw that he had knocked Jim down and had perhaps seriously injured him.Laurel had taken Jack's advice and was resting on an old beam that lay alongside the dock. She was very pale, as one could see even in the uncertain light. Yet her sudden restoration to something like strength might be accounted for by the fact that she had eaten some food in the hut, the previous fast having weakened her greatly. Or was it the letter Jack gave her?The crowd had now scattered, so that the girls might make their way along to camp without brushing through the throng. They had left their boat at the landing, in order to see the girls, who, Jack declared, were waiting there. They could now go aboard again and finish the journey.Seeing the canoe girl, the others drew up to her. Whispered remarks were politely passed, but Jack kept winking and making queer signs toward Walter. Cora joined in the mirth as well as she could but was still nervous. As Cora's boat was setting out, Ben leaned over and whispered:""Don't listen to word from any one, and what's more, if you know anything about the cause for this fight keep it close-to yourself. I told your brother the rest,"" and he covered her small white hand with his own brown rough palm.There all attention was bestowed upon Laurel. The girl had gone from shock to shock until she was really in need of rest and nourishment. Of course Cora made light of her own predicament. She admitted she had been frightened when she found the boat gone, and Laurel sick, but tried to laugh and call it just one more experience, that would add to her general knowledge. But her face was white, and even Belle and Bess who had risen from prostration to over-joy could not be deceived.""It's about that man Peters,"" Bess whispered to Belle. ""You know she had some interest in him because she felt he knew about the hermit and the girl. But the girl is here now,"" she finished, unable further to explain Cora's agitation."
"""Oh, but we did come. We found you much sooner than we thought we would, and I must say you weren't half so frightened as you had a right to be under the circumstances. You are one of the bravest girls I ever saw--that's right and so is that Wild Laurel.""""Oh, I just love her Jack,"" said Cora warmly, ""and if only this other thing about her father comes right, I shall not in the least regret the experience that brought us together. It is a great story, Jack. You know we have still to rescue her father.""""Yes, an outcast, for some mysterious reason. But we shall soon clear that up when Laurel is strong enough to be questioned. I feel so much better,"" and she kissed him as if he and she were just the babies they felt themselves to be on such occasions.""We have no reason to think he was hurt at all,"" said Jack decidedly. ""It's only rumor, and if you don't mind my dictation, I should suggest that this be a forbidden subject. It is about the worst thing either of you can think of.""""Right brother, always right!"" said Cora. ""Now let us go in and try to make the girls happy with a little part of our story. You can trust me, Laurel,"" she said aside. ""I know just what they want to know.""""No, I see more kinds of trouble ahead,"" and of course she looked at the irresistible and irrisisting Walter. ""Don't they match?"" aside to Belle, whose ideas of color schemes and whose regard for the beautiful were blamed for the inflection of nerves.""And you not jealous? Belle I think, after all, I shall have to return to my first love,"" and he slipped his arm all the way back of her steamer chair, for Jack dearly loved to tease either Bess or Belle, declaring what happened to one twin would react on the other.The tall, dark boy, Paul Hastings, Hazel's brother, had just entered the door. Instantly he was overcome with the welcome, for while the boys fell to kissing him and smoothing his hair in the most approved lover-like way, the girls crowded around and offered him empty plates and glasses of flowers, to say nothing of Bess, with the Japanese parasol, who stood over his chair while Cora fanned him.Laurel looked on like one who enjoys a play. There seemed in her eyes something to indicate that such a scene was not entirely new to her, but was for some time forgotten. Presently Cora remembered that Laurel had not met Paul before, and so introduced them. She merely said Laurel in mentioning names, but the omission of anything so unimportant as a last title would never be noticed among these young folks.This was a signal for every boy to pretend to write a love letter to every girl. Jack could get nothing better than a feather from the Indian headpiece that hung on the wall. This he dipped in Belle's shoe dressing, and wrote a note on the back of Cora's best piece of sheet music. Walter sat on the floor poking his whittled stick into the dead embers in the fire-place, and managed to scratch something on a fan--it belonged to Bess. Paul did not much care for nonsense, but appropriately made Indian characters on the wooden bowl with his pen knife. The whole turned out more fun than was expected."
"The merry making that followed this little farce was of too varied a character to describe. Some of the boys insisted on standing on their heads while others took up a low mournful dirge that might have done credit to the days of the red men and wigwams.""Ben told Paul to say to you that under no circumstances were you to go down to the landing to-morrow. I know he has some good reason for the warning. The row between Peters and Brentano may not have ended there,"" and he kissed her good night. ""We have had a jolly time and to-morrow when I come you must let me see the mysterious love letter.""When you receive this I shall be too far away to further meet your daring, baffling challenge of my plans. What I intend to do I can not even tell myself, for everything seemed so easy of evil until you crossed my path. So easy was it that there was even no victory in the spoils. But first you came boldly to the den of poor Peters. Then you deliberately took from us that simple-minded, harmless old woman, Kate; next you did not call out when she gave you back your ring--not call out against us. All this to me was incomprehensible. Why should a young girl not fear us? Why should she not denounce us? Then you saved that little doll, Mabel Blake, until finally I began to wonder why I, a talented high-born Italian, should pretend to love crime when a mere girl could be a noble defender?The difference made me feel like a coward, and I decided finally to go away. Before I left I had trouble with Peters. This hurried me and I have not time to write more now. I know you got back from the island--boys of your kin do not wait long to find their sisters. By to-morrow noon, if all goes well with me on the journey, I shall be able to write that to poor little Laurel which will release her from her bondage. I will send the letter care of you. Thank the boys for use of their canoe.And her conduct had influenced him to turn away from his evil ways. She had done nothing more than others, except perhaps she had more courage, born of better and more complete experience. She sighed a sigh of satisfaction as she again hid the paper in her gown. Then with one great heart-beat of prayerful thanksgiving, she, too, sought ""tired nature's sweet restorer.""Cora had been dreaming very heavily, and her sleep seemed but a reflection of the previous day's troubles. Now she was awake and instantly she remembered it all about Ben telling her not to go near the landing; then about the letter.Then she told of the first discovery of the man on Fern Island, following with the account of her second and third visits there, and finally of how she found poor Laurel in such distress the night of her own exile. The loss of her boat they all knew about, and that part was a certain kind of clear mystery."
"""Well, we will have her back again,"" promised Cora. ""I am positive she will keep her word. I think her a splendid girl. All she needs is the chance to get over the state of chronic fright she has been living in. Then she will be just as normal as any of us.""""They are beautiful, Belle,"" said Cora, looking with admiration at the dainty green vines with their freshly-blown, colored bells that trailed from the glass bowl in the center of the table. ""Nothing could be more artistic, and we enjoy them even if Laurel has missed them,"" Cora finished.""But the boys were going out in the canoe and now it's gone,"" Belle reminded them. ""They were going to take the prize canoe, and the red one, and we would all then have a chance to float out together. Now, of course, we won't be able to go.""""We can go in our own boat,"" Cora said, ""and really the lake is quite rough for canoeing this morning. When Laurel comes back she will likely bring her own boat and then we will have three in our fleet."" ""It is strange Laurel does not come back,"" remarked Bess, as the girls sat on the porch after a most unsuccessful fishing trip (as far as fish were concerned), ""Somehow I feel she would if she could.""""That's it exactly,"" Cora corroborated. ""If she could get back here this afternoon, we would have seen her. But then her father may have been too lonely without her, or any of many other things may have detained her.""Cora jumped up suddenly, and skipped down the path to where her motor boat was fastened. She would look over the engine. The wire connections had slipped, and she would tighten them, and make some other minor adjustments.Cora found more to do on her boat than she had expected. The boys had had the craft out latest and had neglected to put down the oil cup levers. This caused the cylinder to be flooded with lubricant, and if there was one thing Cora disliked more than another it was to run an oil puffing boat, and ""inhale the fumes.""Ben looked at the oil cups. ""There isn't any thing meaner than running a boat that throws out soft coal smoke,"" he admitted. ""Those boys left the plungers up. But I say, girl, where's your new friend?""""Yes. I have suspected for a long time that the little runs that Peters makes up there must have paid him pretty well. Now that he has fallen out with Tony, likely it'll all come to Jim. Best thing we can do, miss, is to keep a sharp look out for the girl. If you can get her to come to camp with you I fancy all the rest will soon straighten itself."""
"Cora wondered just how much Ben knew of the mystery of that island. She felt obliged to withhold Laurel's secret, yet she felt, too, that Ben would do everything to help her get the girl and the hermit away from their place of exile.""I'll tell you, Ben,"" she said finally. ""I'll come to you for advice just as soon as I find it is time to act. Depend upon it we are not going to leave Cedar Lake until the mystery of Fern Island is cleared up.""""All right, little girl,"" he said, ""if you want me before I come again, just let me know. Ben will be only too glad to stick by you and all the rest of them,"" meaning the campers at Camp Cozy and those who bungalowed at the Bungle.""Dear old Ben,"" Cora mused, ""everything seems worth while when it takes 'everything' to make such a friend as you can be."" Then she went back to her engine. She must tighten the wires, and leave the craft in readiness for a quick run.""Oh, I am. Think what it would mean if the boys had knocked my engine out. And it did seem for a time that there was no 'if' in it."" Cora jumped lightly out of the boat and was ready to greet the other girls. Soon a discussion of color and its causes was in progress, Cora maintaining that her cause of anxiety had been that awful engine and its troubles.""I say,"" began Ed, ""where do we, go to look for the wild Olive or was it the mountain Laurel? Jack is in a fit, and Walter can't be held. What do you say if we all start out in a searching party? No one has been lost for twenty-four hours, and this state of affairs is getting monotonous.""""Seems to me you found her last time,"" objected Walter who was looking particularly well to-night, for his suit of Khaki and his brown skin seemed all of a piece. ""You nearly knocked me down in your haste to find the hut first.""""But,"" Cora said seriously, ""Laurel may not want you boys to find her. She may not even want me to do so. I am just taking chances. Suppose you allow Bess and me or Hazel or any two of us to go up to the hut first? Please do be reasonable, and not silly,"" Cora finished in a voice she seldom assumed.The boat was running beautifully. The cleaning out that Cora gave the base, and the regulating of the oil cups together with adjusting the wires, helped to make the mechanism run more smoothly, and she glided along without ""missing,"" which means, of course that every explosion was in perfect rhythm to every other explosion. There was a ""hot fat"" spark as Cora explained.Cora swung so that the red light of the Petrel showed she was going to the right. The steamer gave two whistles indicating a left course. Cora answered with one blast which meant right. The steamer insisted on left and gave one more signal."
"No sooner had he said this than the big boat came so close to the smaller craft that a huge wave swept over the small forward deck and instantly the colored lights went out, being drenched. For a moment every one seemed stunned! The shock to the Petrel was as if she had been suddenly dipped into the depths of the lake. But as quickly as it happened just as quickly was it righted, and the offending boat steamed off majestically, as if it had merely bowed to an old acquaintance.""I don't know as I do,"" replied Jack in the same voice, ""but if you will just explain what you want us to do we will give you no further trouble."" Jack knew one thing--to refuse to comply with the request of an officer is about the last thing to do if one values either money or liberty.""If it were only one night in jail, I'd take it just to fool the man who wants the money, but I am afraid it might be ten days and that would be inconvenient,"" Jack remarked, as the police boat steamed off with the Petrel trailing. ""They call this law. It may be the law but not its intention. We were almost landed, and just about to light up. I tell you they just need the money.""When they reached the bungalow, where judge Brown held his court, the three young men entered with the inspector, and when the judge had satisfied himself that he could not ask more than five dollars and costs for this ""first offence"" the fine was paid and the matter settled. Belle and Bess were greatly relieved when the culprits came back to the Petrel. They had a hidden fear that something else disgraceful might happen; perhaps the judge would detain the boys, or perhaps the girls would have to go in to testify. Cora's mind was pre-occupied however, and when the Petrel started off, and Jack asked her where to, she said back to Fern Island. It was too late now for Cora to think of making her way to the pine hut without the boys, too dark, too late and too uncertain, so she agreed to allow Ed and Jack to go with her while Walter and the girls followed at some distance.Hurrying before her brother, Cora reached the thatched doorway. She pushed back the screen and saw Laurel leaning over the bed on the floor. As she entered Laurel motioned her not to speak. Then Cora saw that the girl was bending over her father.""He fell and struck his head on a rock,"" answered Laurel. ""It was that night we were in the hut. It was he who came walking along in the darkness, and we thought it was some one else. He came to look for me after I signaled that time. It was my father!""""No, hardly at all. It was only a slight cut on his head, but the shock of it brought him to him self--restored his reason that was tottering. When he got up and staggered off his mind was nearly clear, but he did not dare come to the hut where we were for fear it might contain some of his enemies. He went looking for me, but I had gone with you.""Since then he has talked of matters he has not mentioned in years and years. But he is not altogether better. Oh, Cora, if his mind would only become strong again, so he could clear up all the mystery!"""
"Cora went over to the pallet and looked down at the man who lay there. Yes, he was noble looking in spite of the growth of his hair and beard, and Cora could see wherein his daughter resembled him. There seemed something like a benediction in that hut, and as the thought stole over her, Cora breathed a prayer that it should not come in the shape of death.Bess and Belle clung together. They had a fear of ""the wild man"" and it had not yet been dispelled. Hazel tried to induce Laurel to go back to camp and allow her and Cora to care for the father, but of course such an appeal was useless. Laurel would not think of leaving the sick man. It was finally arranged that Cora and Jack should remain, and then reluctantly the others started off with the promise of returning very early the next morning.""At any rate I think the poor man will be able to be moved in the morning,"" she finished, as they made their way up the hill. ""It will be a wonderful thing if, after all, it comes out all right; that he is a free man, and that his slight injury may restore his scattered faculties.""Cora added her entreaties to those of her brother, and Laurel finally agreed to throw herself down on the straw bed in the far corner of the hut. Cora found room at the other end of the same bed, and presently their young natures gave in to the urgent demands of rest. Jack sat alone watching the white faced man who tossed and turned, muttering incoherent words.Jack realized that this remark about the millionaire might mean a sudden return of memory, and he resolved to test it further, even at the risk of giving the aching head more pain. For if the memory lapsed again it might never be awakened.""Say, you're quite high and mighty for a young fellow,"" sneered the short man. ""Who be you, anyhow, a lawyer? Because if you are you ought to have sense enough to know that we're detectives, after information, and if we can't get it peaceable we'll get it otherwise. How about that?""""It doesn't worry me a particle,"" declared Jack easily. ""Now, Cora, leave this to me,"" for he saw that his sister was much affected. ""I'm her brother,"" he went on, turning to the men, ""and not a lawyer, but I guess I can do just as well in this case. Now, what do you want?""""Well, it's this way,"" began the tall one. ""We heard that Miss Kimball might know something about the quarrel between Peters and Tony, or whatever his name was, and she might be able to put us on his track. Peters is hurt worse than we thought he was at first, and we want Tony. Does she know where he is?""""Well, we have a tip about her and another girl being in a hut on Fern Island and being scared by a man,"" persisted the tall man. ""No offense you know, only we thought she could help us out. The man who scared her and her friend may have been Tony."""
"""Wait a minute,"" cried Jack. ""Before she answers I want to know if you really have a right to the information. How do I know but you may be some one seeking to get evidence for a civil suit for Peters or Tony, and will drag us in as witnesses?""""Here's my court-house badge,"" and he displayed it. ""This has nothing to do with a lawsuit. We just want to find Tony. If that wasn't him on the island who scared the girls, who was it? Surely she can't object to telling; it can't hurt her. Who was it?""Then, without at all going into the details of the mystery of the hermit, which information Cora felt the detectives had no right to possess, she told how she and Laurel had been in the hut and how the unknown man who so frightened, them had turned out to be Laurel's father, and that even now he was under care because of the injury he received.""For his health I guess,"" said Jack sharply. ""That doesn't concern your case against Tony, or whatever his name was, and this Peters. You've found out that my sister doesn't know anything to help you in your hunt, and you might as well skip out. This is private ground, you know.""""He may have to testify whether he wants to or not!"" called the short officer back to Jack who was still watching them. ""The law gets what it wants you know. This isn't the only case against Tony. He is an old offender.""""All right, have your own way about it,"" responded Jack easily, and he noted that the occupants of the Petrel seemed rather alarmed. Then they hastened to disembark as the police boat chugged away, and Jack ran down to meet them.""Poor Belle,"" Jack murmured. ""Now, Bess, just step up here and make sure for yourself that Cora is just as intact as when you last saw her. I am here to speak for myself. If anything she is better for a night's rest in the open. We expect to start a camp on this plan. It can't be beat.""Ed was silent, for the girls were returning. Hazel had her brown arms around Cora while Bess looked at Laurel as if she expected every moment her chum might evaporate. Walter towed on behind the little party."
"This was finally agreed upon, although Jack did not like the arrangements. He called Ed aside and warned him not to let Cora leave the boat, not to let her speak to anyone, and not to let any one intercept her. ""You can tell about those lawyer fellows,"" he finished. ""They might think it their legal duty to interview her, for they know she has been let into the hermit's secret.""Ed readily promised all Jack said, punctuating his remarks with a display of arm muscle which meant that anyone would have to pass pretty close to it to reach Cora while she was in his company. Then they left.Jack sat down on the ledge near the water. He was not given to the ""glooms"" but surely he had had more than his share of serious business lately. How it would end was his cause for anxiety. So he was pondering when Laurel touched his arm.""Young man,"" he began, ""something has happened to clear my brain. A shock some fifteen years ago, if I have not lost all track of time, almost, if not altogether, deprived me of my reason."" He paused and put his hand to his brown forehead, in a motion that seemed more a matter of habit than of necessity. ""Then I came here, or he brought me here. I was all alone. Little Laurel must have been a baby, when one morning I found her at my side. Dear, sweet little cherub. He told me since that her mother had died!""""Well, listen and try to be calm, or Laurel will not let me talk further to you,"" Jack cautioned. ""Last night you mentioned the name of a wealthy banker, for whom my best friend works. This friend is a mechanical genius and he runs a racer boat for Brendon Breslin, the banker!""""Well, Mr. Starr, you have relieved my mind greatly, and I hope I have not taxed your brain too strongly. But the fact is the detectives are trying to find out about those men and every bit of information helps. The police, you know, like to clear things up to suit themselves,"" Jack said.At the word ""police,"" the man winced. Jack noticed the change of manner, and at once turned the subject to that of the health of his listener. He urged him to get up enough strength to leave the island, for Laurel's sake, as well as for his own.""Exactly. But you are not going to have any more solitude. You see we have invaded your camp, and when my sister Cora makes a discovery she always insists upon developing it. I never did see the beat of Cora for finding things out,"" and the pride in Jack's voice matched the toss of his handsome head."
"""And my little girl will have a friend,"" mused the elder man. ""Well, in moments when I could think, that torturing thought of my dragging her down with me was too much. It drove me back always to the old, old despair."" The look of terror, that Jack noticed before came back into the haggard face. It was as if he feared to hope.Laurel was at the door. Her face was a picture of happiness as she stood there gazing at her father. Her skin was as dark as the leaves that outlined the entrance to the hut; her eyes lighted up the rude archway: and her lithe figure completed the bronze statuette.""None could be more pleasant than your own, my dear,"" he answered, ""but now I want to go and see my birds. And I must feed that cripple rabbit. He was shot,"" to Jack, ""but the leg is mending nicely. I missed him so, for he knew us so well and would eat from our hands. You see we established a little kingdom here. Laurel was queen and we, the birds and other life creatures, were all her subjects."" Cora brought back with her the letter promised by Brentano in his note of mystery. This time she confided in Laurel her scheme for unraveling the tangled skein in the web of dishonor that had been woven about the strange girl's father.And then she stopped suddenly. If Ben did not know of the visit of the detectives she was not going to tell him. She had had a faint suspicion that Ben might have sent them to her. But he evidently had not.Walter had rambled off with Hazel and Bess. The day was now one of those so wonderful in August, when nature seems tired of her anxieties, and rests in a perfect ocean of content. The haze had cleared from the water, the hills were shimmering in the rival honors of sunlight and shadows, and Cedar Lake from far and near was glorious. Not a breeze broke the spell:This line prompted Cora. Somehow the joy of relief was the one thing that had ever overcome her, and now, although nothing in all, the strange things that had happened around her, or had warped the life of Laurel and her father seemed really cleared away, still there was that odd look on old Ben's face, there was a new light in Laurel's eyes, and something like vigor in the voice of Mr. Starr. Oh, if he could and would only tell about that note! Then everything else might await time for adjustment.""And this is to-day's letter."" She opened the bulky envelope. ""He says so much about a girl's power of influence,"" Cora explained, as if not wanting to read that part of the letter. Then he says this:"
"""'I have some excuse for my folly. When I was a very little child my mother died. My farther was an expert mathematician employed by the Mexican government. From a tiny lad I watched him make those fascinating rows of figures, and I always wanted to know what they meant. He told me money, riches, gold, and I got to believe that the way to acquire money was to make figures, and do wonderful things with pen and ink. When I was twelve years old my father died, and I was left, with considerable money, in the care of an old nurse who idolized me. Poor old Maximina! She meant no wrong, but who was to guide me? Then the money was gone and the nurse was also gone. I had to follow some occupation, and a friend coming to America brought me with him. At fifteen I was a bank runner. It was there I met Mr. Starr, the respected first clerk of the bank. He liked me, talked to me and was my friend. Then I got in with a set of so called scientific cranks. I knew something about the ways of hypnotism, and when I wanted money the temptation came.""Cora read: ""I have kept proofs of everything, but if the authorities refuse to accept these proofs I am willing to come back to America and give myself up. You will find the papers marked 'bank records' in a chest in the back kitchen of Peters shack. They are sealed in a big tin can marked 'red paint.' What are they saying about Peters? That must be a hard nut for the Lake people to crack, but since they know so much, or they think they know, it might be a good thing to let them find out how little they really do know. I am sorry for poor Peters. He got ugly, however, and it was his own fault?""As Cora read these last few words her, eyes left the paper. What did he mean? Why did he not say more? He knew Peters' shack held the needed proofs of that forgery case. It would take many days to write to and hear from Mexico. All this was dashing before Cora's confused mind.""It was evidently not a question of age,"" said Jack, ""when one is hypnotized into the belief that he has committed a crime it would take scientific treatment to restore him to his correct view of the case. To remove you from the possibility of this, I suppose, is the very reason that Brentano brought you here."""
"""Why, father,"" and Laurel folded her arms around him, ""don't you think it would be dreadful to disappoint our friends when they have waited the whole night? And they must want to get back to their comfortable quarters.""""It must be hard,"" Cora agreed, ""and if you want to come back we could arrange to build you a real camp out here, one in which Laurel might have some comforts. But first you must get strong. Just think of beef tea-broth--can't you smell it?""From that time until the Petrel landed at the lower end of Cedar Lake Mr. Starr, the hermit, felt that he was in a dream. At the same time he allowed himself to be guided and managed with the simplicity of a child, for his awakened memory seemed stunned by this new turn of affairs. He was weak, of course, but with all the hands that now crowded around him his every need was well looked after.Dr. Rand came at once. He diagnosed the case as one of mental shock, and called the patient convalescent. A nurse however was called in to hurry the recovery, and this necessitated the renting of another bungalow for the boys.There had never been more excitement around the wood camp. The boys ran this way and that, each anxious to outdo the other in the accomplishment of something important. Finally Cora suggested that they all go away to make sure that Mr. Starr would have real quiet.Once more the Petrel sailed up the lake, this time toward the Everglades. Cora thought of that day when she and Bess dared take the same journey, when the strange man sat at the willowed shore ostensibly making sketches. She thought now that his work then must have been the forging of a letter to hand the poor demented hermit of Fern Island. Seeing their precious papers, or the receptacle that was said to contain them, in the hands of the detective, Cora and Laurel both drew back. They could not now demand them, was the thought that flashed to the mind of each, and yet to leave them in possession of the officers, was the very worst thing that could have happened, for there was always the danger of the old story coming up and then the risk to Mr. Starr, after all his years of evading the law!""Yes,"" said the other man. ""You are right. Those two fellows were up to most anything. We will get Mulligan. He could smell dynamite,"" and with that they turned, took a new path toward the shore, and were soon sailing off in their boat.""But the law is queer on such points,"" Jack argued. ""I have known men to be put in jail for what they call interfering with an officer when the officer could not do just what he wanted to with some spunky citizen. I should not like to touch the can of red paint.""""Perhaps they did not want to,"" said Jack. ""You can never tell what they want or mean. They have a system even the country fellows, and it covers a multitude of failures."" He shook the can, put it to his ear, rolled it a few feet, picked it up again and laughed. ""Mr. Mulligan won't find this can,"" he said, ""Somehow it is attractive, and I am anxious as you girls to see what is in it. If we get in trouble for taking it--well, we'll see,"" and he led the way down to the Petrel."
"They were soon at their dock. The Peter Pan was tied, there, and that meant that Paul Hastings was at the bungalow. Jack thought instantly of Paul's employer, the banker, whose name Mr. Starr had mentioned. It did seem now that things were shaping themselves to tell all the story.The nurse was fetching the beef tea, Paul took the cup from her hand. Jack made a wry face at Laurel, indicating that they would have to watch Paul and the pretty new nurse. Then he took the chair nearest Mr. Starr. The can of ""red paint"" had been safely hidden in a locker of the Petrel.""He thinks this the prettiest end of the lake,"" Paul replied. ""But if you ever knew him and he was your friend I am sure he would be only too glad to make a special trip to see you, for he boasts he never forgets an old friend,"" Paul said.Paul was leaving. Cora and Jack walked to the dock with him. He assured them both that Mr. Breslin would call very soon, and also promised to be on hand on the following Wednesday evening when the girls and boys were planning to have a celebration.""Oh, of course,"" and Cora looked rebuked. ""I had no idea of reading anything, but I thought we should make sure of what was in the can before we got Laurel excited over it,"" and she slipped around the side of the bungalow to beckon to Laurel.Laurel had insisted upon her father reclining in the hammock, and she was now fussing with his pillows, that he might nestle deeper in their softness. It was he who was speaking. On the porch sat Brendon Breslin, looking into Peter Starr's face like one enchanted. There was Cora moving a big fan so that apparently without her doing it, the breeze reached the man in the hammock. Jack was there and Ed was inside the bungalow teasing Walter who had ""discovered"" the new nurse. Hazel, Bess and Belle were busy--there was to be ""something doing.""A day had passed since the opening of the can of ""red paint."" In fact it was the evening following that eventful performance. Paul had only to say ""Peter Starr""' to Mr. Breslin, and the latter was ready to be at the bungaloafers' camp. So the story was unwinding.""And she asks me to be careful!"" He actually seized Cora in his trembling arms. ""She! Why she risked her life for us. It was she who found my Laurel! She who came to us at night to be sure we would not repel her! She who followed up that--"""
"There was surprise on the officers' faces when they saw Mr. Breslin, their superior officer, the mayor of Cedar Lake, sitting on the porch. Greetings were exchanged and finally they ventured to make known their mission.""Wait,"" he said good naturedly, ""I have my boat here. Take a ride with me. It's better than walking the dusty roads. Good evening,"" he said. ""Mr. Fennelly,"" (to Mr. Starr,) ""I hope you will regain your health by the time your son has to return to college!""""Laurel,"" Cora said wearily, ""let us go for a little walk. My nerves are all snarled up, and only a walk will unravel them. We will have time to go as far as the hemlocks before those girls and boys make up their minds to disband.""They talked of many things, as girls will, and Laurel told much of her half-wild life, on Fern Island, while Cora related some of her own experiences. Then they returned to the house, where they found the others assembled.""All right!"" exclaimed the nurse, entering into the spirit of the fun, ""here's where you swim!"" and she poured a glass of water down Jack's back. He accepted the challenge and made exaggerated motions as if he were struggling in deep water. There was a gale of laughter, and that was the beginning of a gay time. The troubles of the past seemed all forgotten.Through the efforts of Mr. Breslin everything regarding the former hermit was cleared up, and his name was once more restored to its untarnished honor. There was absolutely no charge against him, and on learning this, his health took a big change for the better. As for Laurel, she was happier than she had been in many years.The injury to Jim Peters did not amount to as much as had been feared at first and he gradually recovered. There was no trace of ""Tony,"" as everyone called Brentano. The search for him was given up, but the officers who had been fooled by the can of ""red paint"" had a hard time living down the joke against them. Cora destroyed all the correspondence she had received. It was like a bad dream, all but that part about helping Laurel and her father, and she wanted to forget it. Laurel also destroyed the letter Jack had picked up the night of the search. It was one from Brentano, and she, too, wanted no remembrance of him. This epistle had a slight connection with the mystery.Old Ben proved a good friend and Cora was sorry for the momentary feeling she had had against him. He showed the boys many woodland haunts and took them to secret fishin' ""holes"" unknown to the general public. The lads voted him a ""brick."""
