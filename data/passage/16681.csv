passage
"Hop, hop, hop! In it came at the window, the dearest little yellow canary, not a bit afraid; chirping, turning its pretty head this way and that, and asking its little bird questions which nobody could understand.George, and Winifred, and little Bruce were all filled with delight and amazement at the small visitor. Wise George flew to shut the window, kind Winny ran for cake, and solemn Bruce took his finger out of his mouth and stared.But still they had a feeling that the little visitor was a sort of emigrant, who must be led to settle at Fairleigh Cottage; and Winny ran to ask her mother for the half-crown out of her money-box to buy him a cage. One little black duck, One little gray, Six little white ducks Running out to play. One white lady-duck, motherly and trim, Eight little baby-ducks bound for a swim. One little white duck Running from the water, One very fat duck-- Pretty little daughter; One very grave duck, swimming off alone, One little white duck, standing on a stone. One little white duck Holding up its wings, One little bobbing duck Making water-rings; One little black duck, turning round its head, One big black duck--see, he's gone to bed. One little lady-duck, motherly and trim, Eight little baby-ducks bound for a swim. One lazy black duck, taking quite a nap, One precious duck, here on mother's lap. Now, Fido, I have dressed you up In cap, and coat, and cape; No, no, indeed my little friend, You cannot yet escape! Papa has seen a foreign dog Dressed up like you in France, And says that little poodle pup Was quickly taught to dance. Come, Fido, now you must be good, I will not hurt you there; Now stand upon your hinder-legs And lift them in the air. Listen--I will hum the tune And you must dance with me; I want both paws, sir, if you please. Come, Fido--one, two, three! ""Good doggie! as I've taught you that-- Oh dear! he's run away. The naughty dog! he sees a cat. Come here, sir! Fido, stay! There now, he's off and won't come back; We'll dance no more to-day; And Fido's got my dress and cape-- Oh! what _will_ mother say?""The children are fond of a merry tune, so they have given the organ-boy a penny to play. The babies stare at the organ, as though they thought it a very funny box to make such a noise. One little child, with a doll in her arms, is giving a piece of bread to the monkey, but he looks as if he suspected it was a trick. The boy has a cloth over his organ, to protect it when it rains. I do not like to see monkeys led about in this way. I think it is cruel, and must cause them much suffering, especially if they have a cruel master. But I think this little boy will be kind to his little companion, and not twist and throw it about as some of the men do. Monkeys are very amusing, after they go through a short training, and will do all manner of tricks for their master."
"Only a boy, with his noise and fun, The veriest mystery under the sun; As brimful of mischief, and wit, and glee, As ever human frame can be; And as hard to manage, as--ah!--ah, me! 'Tis hard to tell, Yet we love him well.Only, a boy, with his fearful tread, Who cannot be driven, but must be led; Who troubles the neighbors' dogs and cats, And who tears more clothes and spoils more hats, Loses more tops, and kites, and bats, Than would stock a store, For a year or more.Only a boy, who will be a man, If nature goes on with her first great plan; If water, or fire, or some fatal snare Conspire not to rob us of this, our heir. Our blessing, our trouble, our rest, our care; Our torment, our joy-- ""Only, a boy."" Johnny. I want to go to school, And he won't let me pass. I think that a toad Ought to keep to the grass. I don't want to cry, But I'm afraid I'm going to; Oh, dear me! What am I to do? Toad. Here's a dreadful thing! A boy in the way; I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say. I can't see the reason Such monsters should be loose; I'm trembling all over, But that is of no use. Johnny. I Must go to school, The bell is going to stop; That terrible old toad, If only he would hop. Toad. I Must cross the path, I can hear my children croak; I hope that dreadful boy Will not give me a poke. A hop, and a start, a flutter, and a rush, Johnny is at school, and the toad in his bush. Wanton droll, whose harmless play Beguiles the rustic's closing day, When drawn the evening fire about, Sit aged crone and thoughtless lout; Come, show thy tricks and sportive graces, Thus circled round with merry faces. Backward coiled, and crouching low, With glaring eyeballs watch thy foe. The house wife's, spindle whirling round, Or thread, or straw, that on the ground Its shadow throws, by urchin sly, Held out to lure thy roving eye. Then, onward stealing, fiercely spring Upon the futile, faithless thing. Now, wheeling round with bootless skill, Thy bo-peep tail provokes thee still, As oft beyond thy curving side Its jetty tip is seen to glide. Whence hast thou, then, thou witless puss, The magic power to charm us thus? Is it that in thy glaring eye, And rapid movements we descry-- While we at ease, secure from ill, The chimney corner snugly fill.The name of the bear is _Jack_. I fetched him from the West India Import Dock on the 5th of November, 1870. He was running about with another bear on board ship, but the job was to catch him. After many attempts we at last put a strong collar round his neck, to which was attached a long chain, and then we got him into a large barrel and fastened the head on with hoop-iron, lowered him over the side of the vessel into a boat, and then pulled to the quay, and hauled him up into a cart. For a time the little fellow was quiet enough, but he got very inquisitive when being driven towards the city, and wanted to have a look round. I managed to quiet him by giving him pieces of lump-sugar. He arrived safely at the Crystal Palace, and has lived in an aviary till the beginning of last month, when he was put into his new bear-pit. The little fellow has grown twice the size he was when he first came. He is very playful, but sometimes he shows his teeth when he is teased."
"The lessons are learned, and now we all join hands, and march to the play-ground. And a nice play-ground we have, and every day when it is fine we enjoy ourselves very much. Some like to swing round the great pole, others join hands and form a large ring, and then we try to see which side of the ring can pull the hardest. Others like to run a race, and try who will run three times round the play-ground first. When it is wet we march round our large school-room, keeping time with our feet. And then we have such splendid fun playing ""Tag,"" first one, and then the other, racing round over benches, and under and around the desks, until we are fairly tired out. Then we hear the bell ring, and we march in, two by two, to commence our lessons again.Topsy had four kittens, but as it was settled that we could not keep more than one, and little Milly Knight wanting one, the other two had to be drowned. So Milly came one day and selected a nice little black and white one. We were very sorry when Tom took the little creatures and put them in the pond at the bottom of the garden. As they were very young and could not feel much, we thought Topsy would soon forget them. Well, on the evening that they were drowned, while the cook was in her pantry, with the window open, she saw something come rushing along, and, in another minute, Topsy leaped through the window, carrying in her mouth one of the kittens, dripping wet, which she laid on the mat and began to lick with all her might. And how she licked it! Over and over, and over again, till, as the cook said, she ""licked it into life."" The little kitten got well, and became, owing to its narrow escape, and the love displayed, a great pet ever afterward. Rat-tat at the door! Rat-tat at the door! Here are valentines one, two, three; There is one for Harry, and one for Will, And a big one for girlie, see! Wildly she flies o'er the nursery floor, Never was girlie so happy before, As she shouts in her baby glee-- ""Oh! I've got a valentine, all come, look! As big as the sheet of a picture book! Now, don't you wish you all, like me, Had a great big heart painted red, you see?""All day long--now in, now out-- Now up, now down--she wanders about Showing her treasure; 'tis fast getting torn, But paper, we all know, is very soon worn. ""Who do you think can love me the most To buy this, and send it alone by the post? Do look again, you must like to see, 'Tis a great big heart, and it 'longs to me, And please to read me the written line That says, 'God bless your sweet valentine!'""A very interesting story is told by Mr. Youatt: ""I wanted, one day, to go through a tall iron gate, from one part of my premises to another, but just within it lay a poor lame puppy, and I could not get in without perhaps seriously injuring him. I stood for a while hesitating, and at length determined to go round through another gate, when a fine Newfoundland dog, who had been waiting patiently for his wonted caresses, and wondering why I did not come in, looked accidently down at the invalid. He comprehended the whole business in a moment. He put down his great paw, and, as quickly and as gently as possible, rolled the invalid out of the way, and then drew himself back in order to leave room for the opening of the gate.""""Oh, papa! will you please buy me a donkey?"" said little Ella Clark to her father, as she ran to meet him. ""Well,"" said her father, ""if you will promise to be a very good girl, and give your sister May a share of the rides, I will get one in the city and send it home."" So, in a few days the donkey came, with a new bridle and saddle. The next thing to do was to give him a name; so, after trying a great many they agreed to call him ""Jack."" The next day Ella and May were up early and went to the barn, where they found Henry, and asked him to saddle ""Jack."" Henry brushed down ""Jack's"" thick coat of hair, and made him look quite trim, and he then placed Ella on ""Jack's"" back, and walked him up and down, holding on to Ella, and in a short time she could ride alone, and felt as proud as a queen when her father saw her sitting up on ""Jack's"" back. She then gave May a ride, and at last got so bold as to take ""Jack"" down the lane alone, and had a splendid time riding up and down."
"Little Elsie and Gertie live in the country. They do not see the gay shops full of pretty things that amuse children in New York, and they have never been to a bazaar, or to the Zoological Gardens, but they have sweet flowers to smell and look at, and live creatures about them at home. They find amusements at all seasons of the year, and are very merry. You see them now in the field where the grass has been cut and is drying into hay that the horses and cows will eat. The children have had fine fun in the hay; they have spread and tossed it, and Gertie has pretended to feed her toy goat with it, and now she wants Elsie to hide her in it that she may jump out and surprise James their brother, who is coming in at the gate.Mary is a good little girl, but is meddlesome. She has a good Grandmother, called Mrs. Mason, and she sometimes goes to her house. One day Mary got into mischief. Seeing her Grandmother's spectacles on the table, she put them on her nose, and said, ""I'm Grandmother."" Mary began to march about the room in a very grand way. Presently the spectacles fell off, and the glasses were broken. Poor Mary cried bitterly, and at first did not know what to do; but when Mrs. Mason came in, she told her all, and promised never to play ""Grandmother"" again. Mrs. Mason told her not to cry, and she might play ""Grandmother"" as much as she liked, but she was to be very careful not to take her spectacles, and she would get her papa to get a pair of tin ones, with holes in them, so that she could see as well, and look all the funnier.""Ponto,"" the dog, who was longing for a run with nurse and baby, came up into the nursery to see if they were nearly ready for their walk. Nurse had gone out of the room, leaving baby fastened into her chair with a saucer of milk on the ledge in front of her. Ponto would not have taken the milk without leave--he knew better how to behave than that; but he wanted baby to give him some, and did not know how easily the saucer would be upset: one great paw put on the little shelf sent it over, broke it, and spilt the milk. You see the baby is not at all afraid of the dog, and she is too good-tempered to cry about the milk being spilt; but she holds her spoon out of Ponto's way and says, ""Naughty, naughty!""One evening, nurse had put baby to bed, and tucked her in quite snug and warm. Having to do some shopping, nurse went out, and, in going along the street she felt something pulling her skirt, and on looking down discovered Tray with her skirt in his mouth. Nurse thought he was only playing, and tried to shake him off, but he began to bark and whine, and seemed to say, in his doggish way: ""Please _do_ attend to me; _do_ come back with me!"" that at last, just to see if he would leave off, she began to walk home. And oh, how delighted Tray was! When they reached the house Tray ran up-stairs, and nurse discovered baby sitting up in bed, and screaming sadly. The little thing had awoke, and finding herself alone, began to cry; and the faithful dog had heard her, and set off directly to find nurse.When I was a very little girl, one of my best friends was Washington Henry. He was one of our servants, who made himself useful inside of the house, and was as black as night, as you may see by the picture. He liked nothing better than to meet me outside the house and have a romp, and he would take me all round the barn and show me the ducks, and hens, and the nice little chickens, and wheel me round in the baby-carriage, while he capered and danced about like a high-mettled steed. I can tell you we had plenty of fun, and father often used to wonder how it was I liked Washington so much, but it was only because he was more kind and considerate than any of the other servants. His old mother lived in a little cottage with his younger brother and sister, and he used to take me round there sometimes, and they had always something new to show me. A little Monkey chanced to find A walnut in its outward rind; He snatched the prize with eager haste, And bit it, but its bitter taste Soon made him throw the fruit away. ""I've heard,"" he cried, ""my mother say (But she was wrong), the fruit was good; Preserve me from such bitter food!"" A monkey by experience taught, The falling prize with pleasure caught; Took off the husk and broke the shell, The kernel peeled, and liked it well. ""Walnuts,"" said he, ""are good and sweet, But must be opened ere you eat."" And thus in life you'll always find Labor comes first,--reward behind."
