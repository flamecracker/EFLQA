passage
"""Yes, you have, I know,"" declared Polly, in her most positive fashion; ""now tell me what it is, and right straight off, Joel. Begin."" She kept her hands still folded in her lap. ""What were you going to do?""At that Joel gave a loud howl, nearly upsetting Polly from her stone; then, digging his two fists into his eyes, he plunged forward and thrust his black head on the folded hands in her lap. ""I ain't naughty,"" he screamed. ""I ain't, and Mamsie won't care. O dear--ooh--ooh!""""Joel Pepper!"" cried Polly, in a tone that brought him bolt upright, his round face streaked with tears that his dirty little hands had tried to wipe off, the rest of them trailing over his round nose. ""O dear me! Now you must go into the 'provision room' and stay. Don't you remember Mamsie said you'd have to go there the next time you wouldn't tell what you'd done?"" And Polly looked as if she were going to cry at once.Thereupon Joel gave a terrible howl. Little Davie, in distress, clapped his hands to his ears. ""Oh, Polly, don't make him,"" he was saying, when heavy steps came around the corner of the house. ""Any ra-ags to sell?"" sang out the voice of a very big man.""Worse'n stomach-ache,"" said Mr. Biggs, in astonishment, and slapping his big hands together; ""then I can't take him with me. But t'other one might go, if you say so, marm."" He always called Polly marm, and she liked it very much. He now pointed to David.""That's it,"" cried Mr. Biggs, delighted at being understood. ""This boy knows."" He laid his hand heavily on Joel's shoulder. ""Well, he seems to be better now, so I'll take him and t'other one along of me, marm, if you say so. Ye see, Mis' Pettingill told me to come up there sometime, 'cause she's got a lot o' rags--ben a-makin' quilts, she said, all winter, and I laid out to go to-day, so here I be, on my way.""""I don't want to go if Joel can't,"" said Davie, slowly, and turning his back to the red rag-wagon waiting out in the road. He twisted his fingers hard, and kept saying, ""No, I don't want to go, Polly, if Joel can't."""
"Davie shook his head again, and twisted his fingers worse than ever. ""I don't want to go if Joel can't,"" he said, while Joel roared harder still, if that were possible. So Polly had to run down the grassy slope to overtake Mr. Biggs, who was now getting up into his red cart, in front of the dangling tin dishes, brooms, and pails with which it was filled.""Sho now! that's too bad,"" said the rag-man, his foot still on the shaft, and his big face wrinkled perplexedly. ""Beats all, how suddint they're took. Now you better give 'em a dose o' pep'mint, marm, both on 'em.""But Polly shook her head as she ran back up the grassy slope again. So Mr. Biggs had nothing to do but to drive off, which he did, staring hard at them; and every little while he turned back, to gaze in astonishment over his shoulder, until the big red wagon went round the slope of the hill and was lost to view.To sit down on the old wooden stool in the middle of the provision room, with the door shut, was one of the worst punishments that Mrs. Pepper inflicted; and Polly's cheek got quite white. Little Davie, on seeing this, untwisted his fingers and went up to her. ""Don't cry, Polly,"" he said suddenly, as he saw her face, and laid his hand in hers.""O dear me,"" said little Davie, hiding his face in Polly's gown, as Joel went slowly off. They could hear the provision room door shut. Then Polly turned. ""Oh, Davie,"" she cried. Then she stopped, at the sight of his face.""And you and I ought to get right at it this very minute,"" declared Polly, all her energy returning to her after that one dreadful pause, ""so come on."" And presently the two had the old table against the wall pulled out into the middle of the kitchen floor, and Polly ran and got the big piece of foolscap paper laid away carefully in the upper bureau drawer in the bedroom. Across the top ran the letters set there by the minister in obedience to Mrs. Pepper's request.""I'll get the brown paper--let me, Polly,"" cried David, quite in his usual spirits now. And he clambered up, and got out a carefully folded piece laid away after it had come home wrapped around one of the parcels of coats and sacks Mrs. Pepper had taken to sew.""Oh, that will be a long time, Davie,"" she said, gazing in an awe-struck way at the array of wonderful letters Parson Henderson had made for them. ""Mamsie won't ever let us try until we can make 'em good and straight. O dear me, I don't s'pose I'll ever get a chance."" She sighed; for writing bothered Polly dreadfully. ""The old pen twists all up whenever I get it in my hand, and everything goes crooked.""""Oh, Polly, you're going to write real nice, by and by,"" said little Davie, setting down the brown paper, and smoothing out the creases. ""Now where's the ink-bottle? Let me get it, Polly, do,"" he begged, running over to the corner cupboard."
"""I won't spill it, Polly""--but Polly was already on her tiptoes, and lifting down the old black ink-horn that had been Father Pepper's. ""Isn't it nice that Mrs. Henderson filled it up for us so good?"" she said, carrying it over carefully to set on the table. ""You can get the pen, Davie.""""Yes, indeed,"" said Polly, drawing up the inkstand into the best place, and sighing. ""Well, dear me, I'd ever so much rather hold her hand while she writes, than to do it myself."" And she gave a long stretch.""No,"" said Polly, with a little laugh, ""I s'pose I shouldn't, Davie."" O dear me, she thought, I ought not to laugh when Joel's in there all alone in the provision room. ""Well, now we're all ready. I'm just going to peek and see if he's all right. You stay here, Davie.""""Why--where--"" she started back and rubbed her eyes, and stared again. ""Oh! Davie,"" she screamed. Then she clapped her hands over her mouth. ""It never'd do to scare him,"" she said. And she opened the provision room door and rushed in. The old stool stood in the middle of the floor, but there was no Joel to be seen.Polly ran here and there. ""Joel--_Joel_!"" she cried, peering into every corner, and looking into the potato bag and behind some boxes that the storekeeper had given the boys to make things out of, and that were kept as great treasures. ""O dear me, what shall I do? I must tell Davie now, so he can help me find him--"" when she heard a funny noise, and rushing outside, she heard Joel say, ""Don't come, Polly, he's 'most dead.""""Let me see him,"" cried Polly. ""Turn around, Joel. I'll help you. O dear me!"" as Joel whirled back, the long body of the snake flopping from one side to the other. ""If he'd keep still, I could cut off his tail high up. I'll go and get the hatchet--"" and she ran off."
"""Don't scare him, Joel,"" she cried. ""O goodness me! What a big one, and a gray adder, too. Oh, Joel, are you sure he didn't bite you anywhere? Do throw him down and let me see,"" she begged anxiously. But Joel swung the snake back and forth. ""Hoh, I guess not!"" he said scornfully, ""not a single snip, Polly. Ain't he big! I killed him all alone by myself.""""Oh, don't, Joe!"" begged Polly, running over to put her arms around David, who burrowed into them as far as he could. ""Do put him down, and come and tell us how you killed him. There, let's all sit down on the doorstep. Come, boys.""""You can't have that snake here, Joel,"" announced Polly, in her most determined tone. ""Put him off on the grass in the orchard,"" as the one scraggy apple tree was called. ""Now hurry, like a good boy, and then come and tell us how you killed him.""""Well, he looked at me, and I looked at him,"" said Joel, ""and then I said 'Squish!' and he bobbed down his head, just a minute, and I jumped and I grabbed him by the neck, and that's all, Polly."" And Joel gave a long stretch.Joel's black stubby head popped up, and he peered into the darkness. ""Now, I've got to wait ever'n ever so long,"" he grumbled softly to himself. ""No, there he goes!"" he added joyfully, as Ben breathed hard. ""Now, Dave,"" he rolled over and ducked under the blanket-end, ""if you scream again, I'll snip, and snip, and snip you, most dreadful.""""Hoh--no, I ain't afraid!"" declared Joel. ""He's been dead a hundred years, I guess. An' beside, I could knock him flat, yes, sir-ree!"" He doubled up his little brown fist, and bounced up in the middle of the old shake-down."
"""Dear me, I think Ben might stay asleep a minute,"" he muttered in an injured voice. ""Now, don't you speak a single word and I'll tell you all about it,"" after a long pause, in which they heard nothing but a rat nibbling away in the corner.""Well, old Bandy Legs won't let you get any, if you don't stop,"" said Joel, crossly, ""so there now!"" and he rolled off to the edge of the old straw bed, and in two minutes was fast asleep, leaving little Davie peering up at the rafters to watch for the first streak of light, determined to get as many green flowers as he possibly could for Polly's garden.""I'll twist up a birch-bark basket, to bring 'em down in,"" he decided. And the first thing either of them knew, there was Polly shaking their arms and laughing. ""You lazy little things, you--get up! I've been calling and calling and calling you to breakfast.""""Why, you see I can't do the dishes, all of 'em, till the boys get through their breakfast,"" said Polly, with a sober face, looking at the old clock, as she thought of the seams on the sacks she was going to fly at as soon as the work was done in the kitchen. How nice it was that Mamsie had promised she might try this very morning while Mrs. Pepper was down at the parsonage, mending the minister's study carpet. ""Now I guess the money'll begin to come in, and Mamsie won't have to work so hard,"" thought Polly over and over, and her heart beat merrily, and the color flew over her cheek.""Well, now, Pet, there's a snarl of thread in the work-basket. Don't you remember, the spool rolled under the table, and nobody saw it go, and the boys kicked it up and made it into a mess, an' Mamsie put it into the little bag, an' I was to pick it out when I got time? If you only could do that, Phronsie, just think how it would help.""""I'm going to do it all,"" said Phronsie, shaking her yellow head determinedly. So she got her little wooden chair from against the wall, and set it in the middle of the kitchen floor, and then brought the little cotton bag out of the old work-basket. ""I shall do it all this very one minute,"" she declared softly, as she sat down and drew out the snarl of thread.""Now, boys,"" called Polly, as she took one look at her, and just stopped to drop a kiss on the yellow hair, ""you must just come downstairs this very minute. If you don't, you can't have any breakfast.""""An' I'm working,"" said Phronsie, twitching at the end of the thread with an important air. ""I'm going to pick out the whole of this, I am, for Mamsie. See, Joey!"" She held up the snarl, and away the spool raced, as if glad to get off once more.""I didn't make her cry,"" denied Joel, stoutly, his face working badly. ""I'll get the spool--I'll get the spool. See, Polly, here 'tis,"" and he dived under the table, and came up bright and shining with it in his hand.""There now, Phronsie; see, Joel's got it for you,"" said Polly, beaming at him. ""Now, Pet, I'll tell you what, let's put Mamsie's basket on the floor, and old Mr. Spool in it. There, Joey, drop him in, then he can't run away again. Now, then!"""
"""Mr. Spool can't run away again,"" smiled Phronsie through her tears, and leaning out of her little wooden chair to see Joel drop the spool in. ""That's nice, Polly, isn't it? Now he can't run away again,"" she hummed.""I must go up and see what is the matter with David,"" said Polly, preparing to run up the stairs. Just at this moment he appeared coming slowly down. ""Oh, here you are!"" cried Polly, brightly, running over to the old stove to dish out his bowl of mush. ""Now, Davie, fly at your breakfast, 'cause I've got to sew all the morning just as hard as ever I can.""""I didn't say all day; but of course you can,"" replied Polly, with a fine scorn, ""if you don't _want_ to help, Joel. I'm sure the little brown house can get along without a boy who isn't glad to make it as nice as he possibly can.""""Dear me!"" cried Polly, merrily, ""the very idea of a boy trying to help who hasn't finished his breakfast. Go back and eat every bit of that mush and molasses, Davie dear; then, says I, we'll see what you can do.""""So you are,"" said Polly, glancing approvingly at the bare bowl. ""Well now, I'll tell you, Davie, what you can do. You know that pile of old nails that Deacon Brown said Ben might have? Well, 'tisn't nice, you know, to play all day, so you may pick over some of 'em, and get the good ones out. Ben will be so surprised, even if you don't get but a few ready.""""No, I don't want you to work but a little while,"" said Polly, decisively, and picking up the breakfast dishes to wash. ""You can have most all to-day to play in. And then some other day, when there isn't any other work to do, you can pick over some more; and pretty soon, before you know it, they'll all be done, and Ben'll be so surprised, for they'll be ready when he wants to mend the woodshed.""""I don't make you,"" said Polly, pouring the hot water into the dish-pan and dashing in the soap, ""but I shouldn't think it was nice to go out to play right after breakfast. You might work an hour, and then you'd enjoy the play all the better.""""A whole hour,"" shouted Joel. But Polly kept a cold shoulder toward him, running up and down in a merry song till a little bird outside the window trilled away as hard as he could, to keep her company.""Chee--chee--chee,"" called the little bird, and away Polly sang, splashing the dishes up and down in the hot soap-suds, till the old kitchen seemed full of merry bustle. Joel regarded her closely for two or three minutes, and then went slowly out.But Joel kicked his feet on the woodshed floor. So little David gave another pull at the box, wavered, and clutched wildly at the air, and before Joel could speak, came tumbling down, and after him, the heavy box, spilling the nails as it fell. He lay quite still, and Joel only stopped to take one look.Polly stopped her song in mid-air, and turned quite white. ""Oh, no, I guess not,"" she said with a gasp, as she saw his face. Then she remembered Phronsie. ""Come out here, Joe,"" and she gently pushed him out into the little entry."
"""O dear me! What shall I do!"" Polly turned. ""Phronsie dear, you mustn't come now."" Joel had sunk down and covered his face with his hands, trying not to scream. ""Go right back to your chair, Polly says so. Be a good girl, Pet."" She looked straight into the blue eyes wide with astonishment at being sent back.When Polly and Joel reached little David, Joel was beyond words, and he fell down and flung his arms around the little figure. Davie stirred and moaned. ""Help me lift him up, Joe,"" cried Polly, hoarsely.""I'll pick 'em up,"" cried Joel, delighted to find something to do, and he sprang up and went scrambling around and sweeping them into a pile with his fingers, while the big tears trailed down his round cheeks.""Run as fast as you can, Joe,"" said Polly, ""and ask Grandma Bascom to come over."" Then she lifted Davie and struggled with him to a pile of grain bags in the corner. ""I can't get him into the bedroom till Joel helps me, and besides, I must get Phronsie out of the kitchen first,"" she thought. ""Oh, God! _please_ don't let Davie die,"" she cried deep in her heart.Joel flew on the wings of the wind, his heart beating like a trip-hammer, over down across the lane to Grandma Bascom's little cottage. Grandma, with a tin pan full of wet corn meal, was just going out to feed her hens, when he dashed up behind her. ""Please come!"" he shouted, his trembling mouth close to her cap-border. ""Polly wants you!""""Polly's here, now that's nice!"" said Grandma, well pleased. ""You just wait a minute, and I'll be ready to see her. Come, Biddy-Biddy,"" she called, and waddling off, she gathered up a handful of the wet corn meal.""Oh, come now!"" roared Joe, and seizing her hand, he pulled her back toward the kitchen. ""Dear Grandma Bascom, please come; Dave's killed, I guess,"" and before she knew it, she was halfway to the little brown house, and in a minute or two more there she was before Davie lying on the pile of grain bags, and Polly holding his hand, and fanning him with an old newspaper.""He fell,"" said Polly. She could say no more, but pointed up to the beam. Then she found her voice. ""The box of nails--I didn't know 'twas up there, see!"" and she pointed to them, where Joel had tried to gather them up."
"No need to tell Joel that. Over the fields and across lots he ran like a deer, scaling stone walls in a flash, only to reach the doctor's house to be told that he was away twenty miles into the country. Then Joel sat down on the grass by the roadside, and burying his face in his hands, cried as if his heart would break.""Come on."" It was a kind face that was over him, and in a minute Joel felt himself lifted by a pair of strong arms that presently tossed him into the carriage, in amongst the occupants, while the owner of the arms jumped in beside him. ""Do you know the way home?"" he asked.""See here, my lad, look at me."" Joel rolled his eyes up at the man, the rest of the people keeping quite still to listen. ""You are a brave boy, I know. Now I'm a doctor, and if you'll just take me to your house, I'll have a look at that Dave of yours. Which way?""Joel sat bolt upright as well as he could, being crammed in between a big fat man and his kind friend, and directed this way and that way, his tears all gone, and before any one could hardly think twice, the pair of black horses and the jingling harness and big carriage had stopped before the little brown house, and the doctor was springing over the stepping-stones in such a lively fashion that Joel had to run to keep up with him, until there they were, with Grandma Bascom waddling around in search of some herbs that were drying in the corner of the woodshed, and Polly still holding David's hand as he lay on the pile of grain bags. And in five minutes the new doctor had all the examination made, and Davie was sitting up, his head on Polly's shoulder; and no bones were broken, and all the trouble was the fright produced by the shock of the fall. And the color flew back into Polly's cheek, and Grandma Bascom kept saying, ""Praise the Lord--and who be ye, anyway?"" bobbing her cap-border at the new doctor. And he laughed and didn't tell her.But he did tell some funny stories. And little Davie laughed; and when they saw that, they all laughed, and the people out in the carriage said, ""Just like Dr. Herman,"" and one tall girl, with her hat all covered with red roses, said, ""Uncle John is always doing such queer things. I do wish he would hurry and come. It is too bad to have our driving tour interrupted like that."" And pretty soon down the stepping-stones he came, as light and quick as could be, Grandma Bascom lifting both hands and calling after him, ""Well, you're an angel of the Lord, anyway,"" and the new doctor was laughing. But he had stopped to look into Polly's brown eyes. ""Don't worry, little girl, he's all right,"" he said.The doctor put one hand on Joel's stubby black hair, and turned his grimy face up. ""You've got to be a man,"" he said; ""now look out for it while you're a boy. I guess you'll do."" He jumped into the carriage and drove the black pair of horses off at a smart gait down the road, while Joel stood on the roadside grass to see him go. So when the time came that was to bring Mamsie home that night, tired, but happy to fold her baby to her heart, for Phronsie always climbed into her lap to untie her bonnet-strings, there was David, running around brisk as a bee, his cheeks pink as a rose, and Joel, who had stuck to the old box of nails all day, despite Polly's pleadings to stop and rest, gave a shout that the last was done, and stretched his tired legs. Then he gave a hop and skip and jump around and around the grass before the little brown house."
"""Joel wanted to do 'em, Davie dear,"" said Polly, coming to the door, on hearing that, and giving him a loving little pat. ""I know all about it, why he wanted to do it""--for Joel had told her the whole story--""and Mamsie'll be glad he did it. How I wish she'd come!"" peering down the dusty road.""Dear me,"" cried Polly, whirling around, ""are you there, Pet? Well, Mamsie's coming pretty soon. I think I see--No, 'tisn't,"" as David started to scamper over the stepping-stones--""it's a man turning the road. Anyway, she'll be here before we hardly know it, I guess. Now let's play something, and that'll make the time go faster.""""Oh, hooray!"" cried little Davie, and, ""Hooray!"" piped Phronsie. ""_Joel--Joel!_"" screamed David; and Phronsie clapped her hands and screamed too, and Polly laughed and called as hard as she could, for Joel, imagining himself a gay trotting horse, was slapping his legs with a switch, and careering around the back of the little brown house in a great state of excitement. Now hearing the calls, he came whooping around, making all the noise he possibly could, so there was a perfectly dreadful din, and no wonder that the man Polly had seen turning the road came nearer without any one noticing him.He thought it was so convenient for him that all the children in the house should be out in the front yard, that perhaps he had better hop over the stone wall and go quietly in at the back door; for really he was very hungry, and there must be as much as a piece of bread, although the little brown house didn't look as if it held much meat and pie and cake. So over the wall he went, and slunk in through the tall grass, just as Polly was marshalling her forces on the greensward in front and saying, ""Now, children, what shall we play?""""Muffin--Man--Muffin--Man,"" echoed Phronsie, beating her small hands. ""Oh, Polly, please do let us have the Muffin Man,"" she cried, her yellow hair flying over her flushed face as she hopped up and down. ""Please, Polly!""Polly shot him a beaming glance. ""Now that's nice,"" and she took Phronsie's hand, who was so overcome with delight she could not stand still, but was engaged in making a cheese, and tumbling over in a heap on the grass. ""Come on, Pet,"" and Polly pulled her up, ""don't you see the Muffin Man is waiting for us?"" for there was David standing off at the end of the grass-plot, as stiff as a stick, and most dignified, all ready to receive his visitors.It was after the merry line was dancing back into place that Joel happened to glance up at the window of the kitchen. And as quick as a shot he dropped Polly's hand and skipped off on the tips of his toes over the grass and around the back of the house.Meantime, Joel rushed in over the back doorstep and into the kitchen before the man he had seen through the kitchen window could hear him and turn away from the old cupboard. When he did, he said something that wouldn't have sounded nice had Joel stopped to hear it. As it was, he bounded in. ""What are you doing in our house?"" he cried, doubling up his fists. ""Hey?"" said the man. He wasn't very nice to look at either, and he peered over and around Joel's sturdy figure, to see if more of the children were coming after. When he saw that Joel was alone, and could hear the gay voices out on the grass-plot, he looked perfectly wicked, and he laughed as he pointed a long and dirty hand at him."
"""I ain't a-goin' to scream,"" declared Joel, scornfully, ""an' I'm goin' to drive you out of our house."" With that he dashed at the man with both small brown fists well doubled up, pommelling right and left, and butting his stubby black head into the stranger's waistcoat. And the next minute he was caught in the long hands and tossed with a thump to the old kitchen floor, and the wicked eyes were over him as he lay there panting.Meantime, Joel was tied up tight and fast with the clothes-line to the table leg, and in order that he should not use his tongue, Seraphina's clothes, where Phronsie had thrown her on the floor, were torn off and crammed into his mouth.""Now I guess you'll keep still,"" said the man, turning back to the cupboard with a grin; ""and as long as those youngsters are at their noise out there, I'm safe enough,"" and he pulled out Polly's bread she had just baked that day, done up in a clean old towel.""Humph!"" as he thrust his tousled head into the cupboard, and searched for butter, and ran his dirty hands all over the clean, bare shelves--""well, this will keep me from starving."" So he rolled the towel as tightly as he could over the bread, and slouched off, shaking his fist at Joel with a parting scowl.""Joel--Joel--"" they all cried, and just then Mamsie was coming down the road--oh! so tired, as she had had to stay later than usual, for the Conference was to meet at the minister's house next day, and besides the study carpet to be put down, there were ever and ever so many things to be done. But she had an extra quarter of a dollar in her pocket, and Polly was to run over after the Conference dinner and get a basket of the eatables. ""If they leave any,"" Miss Jerusha, the minister's sister, had said grimly, ""which isn't very likely. I've heard 'em preach often enough of starved souls. La! 'tisn't a circumstance to the starved bodies they bring along to Conference."" So Mrs. Pepper was turning in at the dooryard of the little brown house in a happy frame of mind, when she heard a babel of voices, and Phronsie's little shrill voice above them all.""Goodness me, the house must be afire!"" she exclaimed, hurrying over the grass and in at the door. There was Joel, tied hand and foot, his black eyes blazing, while he was talking as fast as he could rattle, and Polly was untying the clothes-line, little Davie getting in the way, with trembling fingers, while Phronsie stood still and screamed.""Phooh!"" said Joel, ""he didn't hurt me any,"" just as Polly got the last knot out that tied his arms. Then he set to work to help her get his legs free. And in a trice he jumped to his feet and ran to the window.Mrs. Pepper shivered again, but smiled at Phronsie, who clutched her tightly with her little arms around the neck. ""Well, I declare!"" she said with a cheery laugh, ""aren't you going to untie Mother's bonnet-strings, Baby?""""Yes, Phronsie,"" said Polly, with another little laugh, ""so you ought to. I declare, we're all so excited we don't know what to do. I'm going to make your tea, Mamsie,"" and she spun off to the old stove.""Remember one thing. You stay with Polly, and do just as she says. And now, children, hurry along. And if you see the man, you call me."" And Mrs. Pepper went to the door, and, with Phronsie in her arms, watched them scramble down the lane, and up to Grandma's little cottage."
"And so Joel finally went to the cave alone. But not before a good many weeks, for the two boys didn't get play-day again in a long while. There was work to do picking rocks for the neighboring farmers; and then came potato-planting time when they could help Ben as he worked for Deacon Brown, who always paid them well in potatoes that kept them through the winter. And, dear me, there was always wood to pick up and split, Ben doing the heaviest part of the chopping; and errands down to the store for Indian meal and molasses and flour, and to fetch and carry back the coats and sacks that Mamsie was always sewing up. So at it they kept all the pleasant days. And, of course, on the rainy days no one could think of getting off to the woods. So presently Joel almost forgot about wanting to go, until one day when Polly broke out, ""Now, boys, you can play a good while to-day; your work's all done up.""Joel's gun was an old willow branch out of which he had knocked the pith; then he would put in round pebbles, when he wanted to use it, and punch them out suddenly with another stick, screaming out at the same time, ""Look out, my gun's going off. _Bang!_""""You can get some bread in the tin pail in the provision room, Joe,"" she said, without looking up. She was trying to sew up a long seam in one of the coats Mother Pepper was making for Mr. Atkins, and it bothered her dreadfully, for it wouldn't look like Mamsie's, try as she would. And she had picked it out three times, and was just threading her needle to begin again, when Joel rushed in.""How I wish 'twas gingerbread!"" cried Joel, tumbling over the rickety steps in a trice. ""Polly, why don't we ever have any?"" he called back, twitching off the cover of the pail. It fell to the floor and rattled off, making a great noise.""Stop banging that pail, Joe,"" called Polly, in a sharp little voice, and twisting the end of the thread tighter. ""Dear me, this hateful thing won't go in that eye. Go in, you!"" with a push that sent the thread way beyond the needle.Polly tried again, without avail, to thread her needle, and at last, as he ran out with a good whoop, she laid it down and put her head back against Mamsie's big chair in which she was sitting. ""O dear,"" she sighed, ""how I wish I could go off to-day and play just once! How good it must be in the woods!""""O dear me, yes,"" said Polly, twitching up her head again, and picking up the needle and thread. ""And I'm a bad, naughty girl, Phronsie, to fret,"" she added, her ill-humor flying. ""There, now you've concluded to go in, have you?"" this to the eye of the needle.""Well, I need it,"" said Polly, shaking her brown head, while the needle flew in and out merrily. Suddenly she laid it down. ""I must go out and tell Joel I'm sorry. I was cross to him. I'll be back in a minute,"" and she sped off."
"""They've gone down to the brook, I suppose,"" glancing at the clock. ""Well, I'll tell Joe just as soon as he gets home,"" and slipping into the big chair again, she set to work, and presently the old kitchen was very quiet, except for the little song that Phronsie was crooning to Seraphina. At last this stopped, and Polly, looking off from her work, saw that Phronsie had fallen over on the floor, and was fast asleep.""Now I do believe I'll have time to finish these two seams, if I fly at 'em,"" she said joyfully. ""Then, says I, this old coat's done, and Mamsie can send the bundle back to-night when she gets home""--for Mrs. Pepper was away helping one of the village housekeepers to make her supply of soft soap. Many and many such an odd job did Mother Pepper get, for which she was thankful enough, as it helped her to eke out her scanty pittance.Joel and David trotted on as fast as possible, by many a short cut through the woods, till they reached the foot of ""Bandy Leg Mountain,"" so called because the hermit who had lived and died there had short crooked legs. And at last they began to climb up its face, David peering on every side for any chance at spying out the wonderful flowers.""Where are you, Joel?"" cried Davie. He was now too frightened to move, and he was sure he heard a lion roar, though it was only his heart beating and thumping; so he sat down on the moss and pine needles, and waited. Joel would surely come back. Meantime a little bird came up and perched on the branch above his head, and sang to him, so he felt less lonely.""I guess he's just back there,"" and Joel ran on, for there was the big hole in the rocks, and perhaps he'd really see a bear! and, O dear! he must have his gun ready. And Joel soon stopped thinking about David, but bounded ahead as fast as he could, and squirmed in through the narrow slit, and wriggled along down toward the end of the cave.Suddenly a very funny noise struck his ear; it wasn't a bit like a bear, nor even a wood-chuck, for they couldn't talk. And there surely were a number of voices. Joel stopped squirming, and stared with wide eyes into the darkness. It smelt dreadfully in there, so close and hot, and before he could stop it he gave an awful sneeze.""I guess there's lots in there,"" said Joel, ""an' I better go,"" so he wriggled back out into the light. And he hadn't been there but a minute when something came squirming down along after him. Joel flew into the bushes and peered out between the branches.""Why, it's the man who stole Polly's bread!"" he almost screamed. The man went past the bush, so near that his long dirty fingers could have picked him out in a minute, and then went down the other way, looking around carefully, and whistling away softly to himself, and presently returned to the cave. And as soon as he had gone in again, Joel hopped out of his bush, and ran at a lively pace down the mountain-side, thinking only of meeting David, and then to get Ben and Deacon Brown and a lot of men, ""and won't we come back and catch every single one of 'em, then!""There was David fast asleep under his tree, and the little bird singing to him. ""Dave--Dave!"" shouted Joel, shaking him hastily, ""wake up! The man that stole our bread's up there. The cave's full of 'em. I'm goin' to get Ben, an' catch 'em!"""
"""I'm goin'--to--get--the--flowers,"" said little Davie, sitting up straight and blinking. Joel seized his hand and spun him along as fast as he could around the rocks and boulders that now stood in the way.""Now that boy,"" said Mr. Blodgett, shifting his quid of tobacco into the other cheek, ""bein's he's a Pepper, knows what he's a-talkin' of. I'm of th' opinion pretty strong that I'm a-goin' up Bandy Leg.""""Bein's I've lost more hens and chickens the last two weeks than I ever have in my life before, and only yest'day wife had a hull pan o' doughnuts took off from the back steps where she'd set 'em to cool, why I'm of the opinion pretty strong that Bandy Leg Mountain will bear lookin' into. So I'll call Peter an' Jed, an' we'll hoof it up there right away.""""Well, I can't let you,"" declared Ben, decidedly, ""without she says so; and if we wait here much longer, all those fellows will be slipping off, maybe. They can hear you up there, for all I know, you make such a noise.""""See here,"" cried Deacon Blodgett, sternly, ""Joe Pepper, you stop that noise! Ain't you 'shamed, bein' Mrs. Pepper's boy, to take on so? Now I'll tell you what I'll do. You've done a good thing a-drummin' up those scamps, an' I don't wonder you want to go an' see 'em ketched.""""I think a boy who can act as bravely as you have, Joe,"" she said at last, slowly, ""ought to go and see the job finished. Mother can trust you. Run along,"" and Joel's feet twinkled so fast that Peter could hardly see them go. The robbers were caught, and were lodged in the county jail, and all the farmers who had hen-roosts robbed, and the farmers' wives who had their doughnuts stolen, kept coming over to the little brown house or stopping Mrs. Pepper after church on Sunday to thank her for what her boy had done, until it got so that when Joel saw a bonnet coming along the dusty road, or a wagon stop in front, he would run and hide.""I won't have 'em put their hands on my head and call me good boy,"" he cried, shaking his black hair viciously. ""I'll kick 'em--so there!"" So one day, when he caught sight of a wagon just about to stop, he ran, as usual, as fast as he could, off over to Grandma Bascom's.""Bless her heart!"" exclaimed the visitor, looking at Phronsie. ""No, I can't set; I've got to keep an eye on that horse."" As Mr. Beebe, who ran the little shoe shop up in the town, owned a horse that nothing but a whip could make go, this seemed unnecessary. However, Mrs. Pepper only smiled hospitably, while the woman went on.""No more'n they hain't,"" said the visitor, leaning composedly against the door jamb and keeping her eye on the horse; ""but as you may say, Ab'm's their grandson, for my husband's mother was sister to Mis' Beebe, an' she's dead, so you see it's next o' kin, an' it comes in handy to call her Grandma.""""Well, an' so Mis' Beebe's goin' to give Ab'm a party. La! she's been a-bakin' doughnuts all this mornin', got up at four o'clock an' begun 'em. I never see such sugary ones. They're sights, I tell you."""
"""Well, Mis' Beebe said I was to bring him most partic'ler; she'd rather see him than any of the rest o' you. She said, 'Marinthy, be sure to bring that boy who was so brave about them robbers. Tell him I've made some doughnuts special for him.'""""You must not wait any longer,"" said Mrs. Pepper, remembering how, the day before, Joel, had run down to the brook, and been gone for hours, following along its course, never coming home till dinner-time. ""Get Phronsie ready, and Davie and yourself. But I'm sorry for Joey to lose the treat,"" she said sadly.""You can't help it, Polly,"" replied her mother, ""and it won't do to keep Abram's mother waiting. So go on, and take care of the children, and see that they behave nicely. And don't let Phronsie eat more than one doughnut. And be careful to tie the shawl over her when she comes home.""""I'll remember, Mamsie,"" said Polly, and wishing there wasn't such a thing in the world as a party, she put Phronsie into the wagon, and climbed up beside her. Davie, with a very sober face at thought of leaving Joel behind, craned his neck and watched for him as long as the little brown house was in sight.""You see,"" said Abram's mother, twitching the reins, when at last the old horse decided to start, ""I had to hurry away an' get in. I sh'd a-liked to a' set an' passed the time o' day longer with your Ma, but I didn't darst to. It's dretful to have a horse run. I couldn't never a-catched him in all this world, stout as I be. Land! I hain't run a step for ten years, 'cept last spring I was to Sister Jane's, an' her cow took after me, an' I had to.""""No; sho there, easy, you!"" cried Abram's mother, holding the old leather reins as tightly as possible, and bracing back; ""I guess he won't run, bein's I'm so strong in my hands. Well, you see Jane she hollered out o' th' window, 'Throw away your shawl, M'rinthy, he'll kill you.'""""No; why here I be,"" said Abram's mother, with a hearty laugh. ""Well, how could I throw off my shawl an' me a-runnin' so, an' 'twas all pinned across me, an' my brother'd brought it from over seas. So I had to run.""""An' that cow--'twas a bull, I forgot to tell you, Jane's husban' told me afterwards--he kept right on over my head, couldn't stop, you know, an' he went bang up against a tree on t'other side, an' it knocked him flat.""""I s'pose so,"" said Abram's mother, ""for he didn't know nothin', an' th' men folks came who'd seen me runnin' an' heard Jane hollerin' an' took him off before he came to, which he did after a spell, as lively as a cricket. An' they dragged me up, more dead'n alive, an' I hain't run a step since.""""An' I might as well have flung off that red shawl,"" she went on, ignoring his request, ""if I could a' got out that pin, for it was all smutched up, fallin' in that mess, an' I couldn't put it on my back. It beats all how you never know what's best to do; but then, says I, you've no call to worry afterwards, if you decide in a hurry. Sho now, go easy, you!"" And at last they drew up at Mrs. Beebe's door."
"There she stood in the doorway, in a cap with new pink ribbons, and old Mr. Beebe just a little back, smiling and rubbing his hands, and in the little window where the shoes and rubbers and slippers were hanging was a big round face plastered up against the small panes of glass.""There's Ab'm, now,"" exclaimed his mother, proudly. ""I guess when you see him you'll say there never was sech a boy. Well, I'm glad we're here safe an' sound, an' this horse hain't run nor nothin'. Now, hop out,""--which injunction was not needed.Good Mrs. Beebe ran her eye over the little bunch of Peppers as they jumped down over the wheel. ""Why, where's Joel?"" she cried. ""In the bottom o' th' wagon, I s'pose,"" she added, laughing and shaking her fat sides.""Sho, now, that's too bad!"" ejaculated Mr. Beebe, dreadfully disappointed. Mrs. Beebe already had Phronsie in her arms, and was whispering to her some of the delights to come. ""Well, well, well, come right in, all of you, and make yourselves to home. I'll take care of the horse, Marinthy; go in an' set down.""""I'm sure I'm glad to,"" said Marinthy, getting over the little steps quickly after the Pepper children, and nearly knocking down David, who came last. ""Ab'm, come here an' make your manners,"" she called. Ab'm got down from the pile of boxes where he had been looking out of the window, and slouched forward, his finger in his mouth.""O dear me,"" thought Polly, ""whatever shall I do! It will make dear Mr. and Mrs. Beebe feel so badly if I don't stop her. Phronsie,"" and she drew her off one side of the shop, old Mrs. Beebe having gone into the inner room, ""you know Mamsie told us all to be good.""So Polly kissed her, and pretty soon Mrs. Beebe bustled in, her round face quite red with the exertions she had been making, and Mr. Beebe having seen to his horse, came in rubbing his hands worse than ever, saying, ""Now, if we only had Joel, we'd be all right.""""No'm,"" said Polly, ""but we will now, thank you, Mrs. Beebe,"" and she untied Phronsie's sun-bonnet and took off the shawl, David putting his cap down on the counter, keeping a sharp, disapproving eye on Ab'm every minute.Phronsie thrust out her little foot. ""See,"" she cried gleefully, forgetting for a moment the big woman and the boy, ""dear, nice Mr. Beebe, they're all here."" Then she poked out the other foot. ""I buttoned 'em up all myself.""It was perfectly dreadful, and Polly had all she could do to keep from bursting out crying. And what they would have done, no one knows, if Mrs. Beebe hadn't said, ""Won't you all walk out into the parlor an' set down to the table? Come, Pa, you lead with Phronsie.""""Well, you go first then, Marinthy,"" said old Mr. Beebe, dryly, ""with him, an' Phronsie an' I'll foller on. Now then, my dear."" He set her on the floor, and bent his old white head down to smile into her face reassuringly, while her trembling fingers held his hand fast."
"Oh, the table! There were doughnuts, sure enough, as Mrs. Marinthy had said, ""The biggest I ever see, and the sugariest."" No wonder good Mrs. Beebe got up at four o'clock to make them! And a great dish of pink and white sticks and cunning little biscuits with real butter on them, and a cake, with little round candies sprinkled all over the top. Was there ever such a beautiful birthday party!Phronsie, clinging to good Mr. Beebe's hand, thought not, and her glances wandered all up and down in delight, to bring her eyes at last up to Polly's brown ones, when her little face broke into a happy smile. Ab'm was so intent on choosing which of the pink and white sticks he should pick for, that he could think of nothing else, so Mrs. Beebe got them all seated without any further trouble. Old Mr. Beebe was just saying, ""Now, if Joel was only here, we'd be all right,"" when the shop door opened suddenly, and into the little parlor ran Joel, very red in the face.""Now that's nice enough,"" cried Mrs. Beebe, getting out of her chair, her pink cap-ribbons all in a flutter, while old Mr. Beebe exclaimed, with a beaming face, ""Well, I declare! ef I ain't glad to see you. Set right down by me.""""I walked,"" said Joel, who couldn't for his life keep his eyes from the doughnuts, ""'cept when I met a man with a load of hay. An' he was so slow I got down again, for I was afraid I'd miss the party.""Joel dropped his doughnut to his plate as if it had been a hot cake, and leaned over to fasten his black eyes on her big face. ""Well, pass the biscuits, do, then,"" said old Mr. Beebe, good-naturedly; ""let's get somethin' a-goin', Ma."" So the little biscuits were passed, but Joel did not take one; he still sat regarding Ab'm's mother.""Joel,"" commanded Polly, ""do you stop, this very minute,"" and, ""Oh, sir!"" looking up at Mr. Beebe, and, ""Oh, marm!"" and her brown eyes were fixed imploringly on Mrs. Beebe's round countenance, ""I do feel so ashamed, and Mamsie will be so sorry. But please will you let us go home?"" And poor Polly could say no more.""An' I sh'd think you'd better go home,"" said Ab'm's mother, with asperity; ""a-comin' to a birthday party and abusin' the boy it's give for. I never see th' like. An' to think how I driv' you clear over here, an' that horse most runnin' away all the time.""Polly got out of her chair and sorrowfully went up to Joel. ""We'll sit out in the shop, if you please, dear Mr. and Mrs. Beebe, till you get through the party. And then, if you please, we'd like to go home."" Joel's head dropped, and his little brown fists fell down. ""I'm sorry,"" he mumbled.Mrs. Beebe picked off the biggest pink stick from the pile on the dish and slid it on Joel's plate. ""Eat that,"" she whispered. ""Ab'm's goin' home in a week, an' then, says I, you shall come over an' visit with me."" And Mr. Beebe looked over at him and nodded his white head, and Joel was quite sure he winked pleasantly at him. But the pink stick and doughnut lay quite untouched on his plate, and after a time, Polly having crept back to her seat, the biscuits had been passed around again, and the grand cake with the candies on top had been cut, the pink and white sticks were divided, and the doughnuts went up and down the table, and lo and behold! the party was over."
"""Now there's a paper bag up on that shelf,"" said Mrs. Beebe. ""You can climb up and git it; that's right. Now, says I."" She waddled back to the supper table. ""Come here, Joel, my boy, and hold it open there and there."" In went the biggest doughnuts that were left, some little biscuits, several pieces of the fine cake, and last of all, three or four pink and white sticks.""An' I guess Pa's got the horse around all right,"" said Mrs. Beebe, going out into the shop, ""so I s'pose you all must go, though sorry I be to have you."" She gave Polly a motherly little pat on the shoulder, and fairly cried over Phronsie. ""Well, you've got to go, I s'pose,"" she said again, ""'cause Pa's a-waitin'; yes, Pa,"" she called, ""they're a-comin'."" And presently the little Peppers, except Phronsie, all clambered over the wheel; then Polly and Joel lifted her up, and away they went, Mrs. Beebe watching them off till a turn of the narrow street hid them from view.""That Ab'm,"" said Mr. Beebe, after they had gone quite a piece, and glancing back over his shoulder, ""well, he ain't reelly no kin to us, thank the Lord, an' they're a-goin' next week. I can tell you one thing, Polly, he an' his Ma don't git inside our house agin."" Joel sat on the back doorstep and kicked his heels disconsolately. Davie was lying down on Mamsie's bed, fast asleep. He was tired out picking rocks all the forenoon, and Polly had shut the door and said he mustn't be waked up. So there he lay, his arm thrown up over his flushed cheeks; and the long hot summer afternoon ahead of Joel, and he must spend it alone.""All the birds have lots of themselves to play with,"" grumbled Joel, idly slinging a stone at a pack of chattering young ones who could not contain their pride at being able to fly so finely, but kept screaming every minute, ""Look at me. Chee-chee-chee. See-me-chee-chee-chee!""Now they cocked their little heads and stared down with their black beady eyes at Joel; when they saw it was he, they chirped and twittered worse than ever. ""See me. Chee-chee-chee! Look-at-me-chee-chee-chee!""""Stop it!"" cried Joel, crossly, looking up at them; ""Davie's abed, an' I haven't any one to play with, an' you have, lots an' lots."" Then a smile broke out and ran all over his chubby face, and he flung another stone he had picked off as far as he could into the grass.""I'm going fishing down to Cherry Brook,"" said Joel, left alone with not a bird in sight. Even the squirrels seemed to have business at a distance that afternoon; so he hopped off from his stone and ran to get his old tin pail and the remnant of an iron spoon that Polly had given the boys to dig worms with; and very soon he had a good quantity wriggling and squirming away, and he came shouting, flushed and happy, by the window where she sat sewing.""My legs are dreadful strong, Polly,"" said Joel, well pleased at Polly's words. And he set down his pail of angleworms, and the pole carefully beside it. ""See, Polly,"" and he flopped over suddenly, turning two or three somersaults, to stand still on his head."
"""You'd know, I guess,"" answered Polly. ""Don't, Joel, you make me feel as if I sh'd fly to even think of it, and here I ought to be sewing every single minute."" Just then the bedroom door opened, and out walked David, dewy-eyed, and with very pink cheeks. ""Did you call, Polly?"" he asked; ""I heard you say something.""""Goody!"" screamed Joel, ""now you will let him go fishing, won't you?"" And he jumped to his feet and ran to the window to thrust his stubby head over the sill. ""Dave, Dave, come out an' see the lot o' worms I've dug.""It was always Joel's ambition to catch a fish big enough to cook, but as the brook, a little tumbling stream over a few ragged rocks, on the edge of Deacon Brown's meadow lot, only held minnows, with an occasional turtle and frog, this had never as yet happened.Phronsie laid down the bit of calico she was puckering up by drawing through it a needle to which a coarse thread was tied, and looked gravely at Joel. ""You must not say so of my Polly,"" she said gravely, shaking her head.Joel's black hair ducked beneath the window. ""I didn't mean--"" he mumbled. ""Polly, I didn't, truly."" Then he flung himself on the grass and burst into tears, kicking over the pail. The angleworms wriggled along till they got to the edge, then quietly took themselves off.""Dear me, Phronsie,"" cried Polly, in despair. ""Now, if you'd go in and lie down by his side and hold his hand, maybe he'd go to sleep. He's half sick, and I don't want Mamsie to come home and find him so.""""I've got to sew, Polly,"" said Phronsie, with an important air, and holding up her mangy bit of calico, where all but one corner was in a pucker, ""so I must stay right here and finish it. Truly, I must, Polly.""Phronsie drew a long breath and set another crooked stitch. ""I'll go, Polly,"" at last she said, with a long sigh, putting the puckered calico bit, with the needle hanging, carefully on the floor by her side. Then she got slowly out of her little wooden chair.""No in-_deed_!"" cried Polly, warmly. ""There, take Davie's hand, and both of you go into the bedroom like good children, and shut the door and go to sleep. That's nice!"" and she smiled approvingly at them as they disappeared."
"Joel cried on and on, his tears trailing off into the grass, till at last, as Polly took no notice of him, he raised his head to look in at the window at her. She didn't seem to see him, but sewed on and on quite composedly, as if Joel were not there. So he finally jumped up, and seeing his tin pail overturned on its side, he hurried to investigate.""Joel Pepper!"" cried Polly, a little red spot coming in either cheek as she flung down her work on the floor by Phronsie's calico bit, ""that's twice you've made a most awful noise; now you'll wake Davie up again, you bad, naughty boy,"" and without stopping to think, she dashed out doors, and before Joel could hardly breathe, she seized his shoulders and shook him smartly.""You shook me!"" cried Joel, his black eyes sparkling in anger. ""Now I'll beat you, Polly Pepper,"" and he raised the old broken iron spoon. There they were--two little Peppers--oh, dreadful, to tell it--and Mamsie away!""You may, Joe,"" said Polly, brokenly, and rocking back and forth, while the big tears dripped down between her fingers, ""for I've been bad to you, and Mamsie away."" She could hardly speak for her sobs. ""How could I! Oh, Joey, I'm so sorry. O dear--dear--dear!""She went off now into such a gust of crying, that Joel forgot all about his anger. He threw away the spoon, and kneeling beside her, he put his arms about her neck. ""Don't cry, Polly,"" he begged, ""please don't.""""Oh, no, you mustn't, Joe,"" cried Polly, bringing a very red face suddenly to view, the tears running in little rivers down her nose and cheeks. ""There, see! I'm not going to cry any more. Come back, Joe,"" for he was starting off at a lively pace.""Yes, I won't cry any more,"" cried poor Polly, swallowing very hard--""there, see, Joey dear,"" and she wiped off the last tear. ""Now I'll help you dig some more worms,"" she said, racking her brains to think of something by which to make up to Joel for the shaking.So Polly dug and dug away, being careful to select long, fat worms. And presently there was a good number all wriggling away in the bottom of the pail. And at last Joel hopped up and peered in. ""Oh, Polly, what a lot! An' they're juicy ones, and a great deal better'n mine. Now I guess I'll catch some fish, an' you shall fry 'em for supper."" He seized the pail, and slung the pole over his shoulder again, and trudged off."
"But Polly went into the little brown house with a very sober face. And it wasn't till all the children, Ben and all, were abed that night, and she crept into Mamsie's arms and sobbed it all out on her breast, that she felt better and like being Polly again.Joel rushed through the undergrowth and tangle of berry bushes, breaking through the wild grape vines that slapped him in the face and caught his pole; and, creeping and ducking under them, at last he struck the little path to the Cherry Brook, that gurgled its way along Farmer Brown's meadow. Underneath the cool trees it was dank and mossy, and he flung himself down to rest, first carefully setting his precious pail up against a big stone.""I'm just goin' to catch the biggest fish you ever saw, Joel Pepper,"" he exclaimed to himself, for want of company. ""Yes sir-_ree_,"" untwisting the string which, for want of a fishing line, he had tied to his pole. ""Then I guess, when Polly sees it, she'll be glad. Now I'll get the very juiciest worm in the pail."" So he went to the pail, and was just leaning over to investigate its depths, when he heard voices.Joel knew in a minute whose they were, and he tried to scrabble his things together and run and hide them in the thick bushes, when the boys to whom the voices belonged broke through the undergrowth on the other side of the brook.""Hold on,"" called one of the boys, the biggest and dirtiest, and he jumped across the brook. Joel went steadily along as well as he could for the vines and stubby trees, determined not to turn back for anybody's call, at any rate that dirty Jim Belden.""I won't; they're my worms,"" screamed Joel, hanging on for dear life; ""so there, now! you go right away. Polly dug 'em, Polly dug 'em,"" he kept saying. But the scuffle was short, as the other boy raced up, and pulled too, so that pretty soon Joel was tumbled heels over head, into the brook, and the pail was in the hands of the biggest boy, who cried out joyfully, ""Oh, see what a lot! now we'll go up to th' 'Pool.'"" This was a deep spot a half mile or so away, where the stream widened. Mrs. Pepper never allowed the two boys to go there, unless Ben could go too, which was seldom indeed, and only looked upon as a very great treat.Joel burst out in a great passion, as soon as he could scramble out of the brook, ""Give me back my pail!"" and he looked so very fierce, although he was so small, that without another word the other two ran away as fast as they could. Joel plunged after them, angrier every minute, and instead of turning off to the ""Pool,"" Jim and the other boy ran straight across Deacon Brown's field.But when he got to the spot where they stood rooted to the ground, there were no worms in the pail, they having been jiggled out in the chase. So Joel had to go back, and pick up his pole with the string hanging to it, and carry that home and his empty pail. ""But that Jim Belden didn't have the worms, anyway,"" he said, with great satisfaction. Ben came in and hung his cap up on its peg behind the door. Polly didn't see his face, for she was tying on Phronsie's eating apron, and Mother Pepper was in the pantry, else some one would have discovered that he was strangely excited.""No, we better sit down,"" said Mrs. Pepper, coming out with a plate in her hand. ""I'm sorry they're late, for I've got a surprise for you all to-night."" She set the plate on the table, and her black eyes sparkled. ""Now, then, see that!"""
"""Ooh!"" cried Polly, her brown eyes very wide, while Phronsie stopped climbing into her chair to precipitate herself into the midst of the group. ""See, Ben! See!"" exclaimed Polly, ""it's white cake with real frosting on top. Oh, Mammy, where did you get it?""Ben looked at the six big slices lying across the plate, but he didn't seem to see them. However, Polly didn't notice, for she was dancing around the table with Phronsie, to see which side the cake looked the best.""No, guess again,"" said Mrs. Pepper, cheerily. Then she looked at Ben steadily out of her black eyes. ""I was going past Miss Barber's, and she knocked on the window, and when I stopped she ran out, and gave it to me all done up. 'I've been watching for you,' she said, 'for I knew you were helping at Deacon Brown's to-day. We had comp'ny last night, and I want you to have some of sister's cake. She's had real good luck.' So that's all the story about the cake, Polly."" Mother Pepper still looked at Ben, though she spoke as cheerily as ever.""I forgot it,"" said Ben, looking down at them. Then he got out of his chair and went out into the woodshed, where a tin basin and a towel and soap were always ready, for Mother Pepper said they might be poor, and that they couldn't help, but they could keep clean and nice.Polly nibbled at her dry bread, but she couldn't keep her eyes off the cake, and Phronsie bit little pieces all around the edge of her slice. Then she laid it down. ""Now I'm ready for the cake,"" she said, holding out both hands again. ""Please give it to me, Mammy.""""See, Phronsie, mine's going fast,"" cried Polly, with another bite that rapidly diminished her slice. ""Oh, you can't think how soon it will be gone, if you begin to eat."" And Polly munched away determinedly, but she kept looking at the cake. Ben came in, and slid into his chair, and took a piece of bread.Polly dropped her bread-slice in astonishment, and Mrs. Pepper sat quite straight in her chair. Phronsie had just concluded to try again and do like Polly, so she sat quite still and stared, with her bread halfway to her mouth. Ben's head drooped over his plate, and he pushed his bread in rapidly, nearly choking himself.Polly turned a deaf ear, and kept on, ""Oh, Mamsie, we've never seen one, 'cept the pictures. We must go!"" On hearing this from Polly, Joel and David made as much worse clamor as was possible, drowning Phronsie's voice."
"When Mamsie spoke like that, the five little Peppers always knew that she meant to be obeyed, so they drew off from her and tumbled into their chairs; all but Phronsie. ""I'll take you into my lap,"" said Mother Pepper, so Phronsie snuggled, well-contented, in her usual nest, and folded her small hands.""Tisn't all,"" declared Polly, defiantly, with very red cheeks; ""we must go! We've never seen a circus, and now it's goin' to be in Hillsbury, we _must_ go!"" She seemed unable to stop herself. Ben stared at her in amazement.""Be quiet, Joel and David,"" said Mrs. Pepper, turning her black eyes on them. ""No, children, if I could let you go at all, I should trust you with such a boy as Ben, and such a girl as Polly, to look after you."" Polly raised her head, that had drooped at her mother's reproof, and Ben sat quite straight in his chair. ""But I don't see as it's right for me to let you go."" There was a sign of another outbreak, but something in Mamsie's eyes stopped it halfway.""Sit down, Joel; well, Davie couldn't. I shouldn't be willing for him to try, and walk clear back. And Phronsie--"" Mrs. Pepper looked down at Phronsie's yellow head, and smiled. It wasn't necessary for her to say a word. ""Mr. Tisbett'll be goin' over,"" said little Davie, hopefully, ""an' he can take us.""""And ever so many people going in them,"" added Mrs. Pepper. ""No, my children shan't ever be a burden to other folks,"" and she lifted her head proudly. ""Polly, run into the bedroom and get the stocking-leg."" The stocking-leg, in the upper drawer of the big bureau that belonged to Father Pepper's mother, always held the stray quarters and half dollars laid up for a nest-egg against a rainy day. Polly jumped out of her chair, glad to have something to do, and ran into the bedroom.""I sh'd have screamed if I'd sat there another minute longer,"" she said, leaning up against the bureau. ""O dear me! We _must_--I mean, what shall we do if we can't go? I guess Mamsie will let us go."" And she pulled open the upper drawer, took out the stocking-leg, and ran back to put it in Mrs. Pepper's hand.Mrs. Pepper slowly untied the red flannel string and shook out the contents on the table, the eyes of all five little Peppers riveted on them. There were six silver quarters, three halves, two ten-cent pieces, and eight pennies.""Three dollars and twenty-eight cents,"" said Mrs. Pepper, slowly, as she set the pieces in a row. No one dared to speak, except Joel. ""What a lot!"" he cried joyfully; ""now we can go, Mammy, can't we? Oh, whickets!"" and he clapped David on the back."
"""Children,"" said Mrs. Pepper, and her eyes swept the whole circle around the table, but they rested on Polly's face, ""there won't anything pay very well, circus or anything else, if we go when we hadn't ought to. We haven't got a debt, thank the Lord, but that money--"" she pointed to the row--""is all that keeps us from it.""It was impossible for Joel not to see by Polly's and Ben's faces, more than by what Mrs. Pepper had said, that they were not really to go, and he flung himself out of the chair and face downward on the floor, breaking into heartrending sobs, little Davie at once joining him. Polly got out of her seat and hurried over to them on unsteady feet. ""Boys,"" she said in a broken little voice, ""don't cry so. You make Mamsie feel badly. Look at her face."" But they didn't hear her.""Boys,""--she got down close to them and put her mouth to Joel's ear,--""you are making Mamsie sick,"" she said; ""just look at her face."" At the word ""sick,"" Joel stopped screaming, and bobbed up his head to take a good look at Mrs. Pepper. ""Mamsie, don't be sick,"" he screamed, now thoroughly frightened. And jumping up, he ran to throw his arms around her, and hug her tightly.""Hoh! he isn't either,"" contradicted Joel, turning his round face, all tear-stained and streaky. ""Now just look here, Ben,"" and he sprang out from Mother Pepper's arms and rushed up to David's side. ""There, sir!""""I'm not either,"" cried Joel, flatly; ""hear my heels."" And he slapped them down on the floor smartly. ""Children, don't quarrel,"" said Polly, finding her voice, ""and come to supper. I don't b'lieve you know what we've got.""When Joel saw Polly handing out cake with white frosting on top, his black eyes stuck out, and he rushed without delay for his seat, teasing for a piece at once. But on Polly's assuring him that the bread must be eaten first, he began at once on the slice she cut for him. And being really very hungry, now that they had time to think about it, the two boys soon had their portions eaten, nobody discovering, in the excitement, that the little hands were grimy, until Phronsie spoke. ""See Joey's hands, Polly,"" and then everybody looked.""Well, it's bigger now,"" said Joel, bringing the basin to set it on the wood bench and thrust his face in. Then he splashed his hands, and gave them a hasty wipe on the long brown towel hanging from the rack. ""Anyway, it's bigger now. There, I'm done, and you ought to give me a bite of yours.""""Joel, what are you doing, biting Davie's cake!"" exclaimed Polly, a minute afterward, and looking across the table while she snipped off a little piece of the white frosting from her slice, wishing the whole world was made of cake with white on top, and wondering how long she could make hers last."
"""Dave said I might,"" said Joel, with a very red face, and one cheek very much puffed out, while he turned David's slice over so that it didn't show where the big bite had been taken off. But his face grew quite red, and he didn't look in her brown eyes.David, unable to bear it any longer, slipped out of his chair, and crept under the table to comfort Joel. But it wasn't till Polly said, ""Come, Joey,"" that he would show his face. Then he twisted his knuckles into his eyes, and hung his head.Mother Pepper said never a word, only held out her arms, and Joel walked straight into them, bursting into the loud sob he had held back so long; and then she took his hand and led him into the bedroom, and the rest of the children sat still and very uncomfortable, and Davie wouldn't look at his cake. When they came out again, Joel marched straight to David, and said, ""You may have my knife.""""Not so much as he does to grow up a good boy,"" said Mother Pepper, proudly, as Joel came running in and laid the knife on the table in front of David. ""It's yours, and I'm sorry I et your cake,"" he said in one burst.""Oh, Ben,"" cried Polly, after the last scrap of the wonderful cake had disappeared, the dishes were cleared away, and Phronsie put to bed, and everything was spick-span once more, ""I've just thought of something perfectly splendid!""""No, I shan't--and yes, I will,"" said Polly, all in the same breath. ""It's this, Mamsie. Mayn't we have a little play out in the orchard next Wednesday, and can't Joel and David sit up a little longer to-night to talk it over? I've just thought of something splendid to act.""""We've had a cake to-night, and now Mamsie's going to let you two boys sit up. I think nobody ever had such a perfectly beautiful time,"" declared Polly, as they dragged their chairs around the table again, and Mamsie got out her big mending basket, ""did you, Ben Pepper?""""I'm so tired making plays with bears in 'em,"" said Polly, pushing off the little rings of brown hair with an impatient hand. Then she caught her mother's eye. ""Never mind, Joey,"" she said with a gay little laugh, ""I'll make the bear.""""Oh, I don't care,"" laughed Polly. ""Well, now here's the play. You see, we want something quite fine and extra,"" and she looked at Ben meaningly. He nodded, so she rushed ahead, well pleased. ""Well, the name is Mr. Primrose and his Cat.""So then Joel and his bear being settled, Polly launched forth on the wonderful play, and Mother Pepper glanced up now and then from her mending, and a smile began to come on the face that had been soberly bent on her work. All that week Mother Pepper kept Joel and David away from the Store, and Polly or Ben had to go, whenever the errands made it necessary. Polly, when it was her turn, did not trust herself to look at the flaming yellow sheets of paper with the big staring letters across them, stuck up in the dirty store windows, or hung from the beams in among the kitchen utensils, or breadths of calico and gingham, wherever they would attract the most attention.One, in particular, was nailed up just inside the door. It was pretty hard to avoid this, but Polly turned her head away, and tried not to think of it, but keep her mind on what Mamsie said just before starting. ""Don't keep looking at what you want and can't have, but keep busy over what you can have;"" so she set her brain hard to work over the play, trying to decide whether she would have Mr. Primrose, who was to be Ben, rescue from the bear the white cat, who was to be Phronsie, in the remains of the old white fuzzy mat that Mrs. Henderson had given them to play with, or whether she (Polly), who was to be the fairy, should change her back into the small damsel she was at first, or whether--"
"He was a jolly good-tempered man, and very kind to Mrs. Pepper, sometimes giving her sacks and coats to make when he really didn't need them just then; and though he never waited for his money but once, and that was when the children had the measles, and Joel nearly died, he used to give large measures of things, and sometimes he'd slip in an apple or two, and once a whole fine orange went into the bag of Indian meal, so as to be a surprise when it was opened at home. So Polly liked Mr. Atkins very much.Now she blushed rosy red. ""Oh, I didn't mean--"" she began, and was just going to say, ""Please, I'd like three pounds rye flour, Mr. Atkins,"" when he broke out, ""I s'pose you're athinkin' about the circus--don't wonder--I got my mind some on it myself.""""I s'pose, now, your Ma don't approve of 'em,"" he said, looking quite solemn all at once; ""well there, I s'pose they ain't quite 'xactly the thing, but they look pretty nice on paper. See that fellow, now, Polly, a-flyin' through that ring. Beats all how they do it. Makes my head spin to look at him. See there!"" and Mr. Atkins pointed a stubby forefinger, shaking with excitement, to the big poster hanging by the counter.""Oh, I can't look, Mr. Atkins,"" she said hastily. ""Please do hurry and give me the flour."" And then she got so very miserable, for fear she had been rude, that she stood quite still, and the color flew out of her cheek.""I s'pose your Ma don't approve,"" observed Mr. Atkins again, not being able to tear his gaze off from the splendid evolutions of the man flying through the ring, and others of a like nature; ""well-well-well, I d'no's 'tis 'xactly the thing, but then--an' then them horses. Why, Polly, this man is a-ridin' five great strong prancing ones all to once, dancing like ginger."" Polly gave a great gasp. ""Oh, if Joel could only see those horses once! It was too bad--it was cruel."" Her heart seemed to jump into her throat, and to choke her. ""We _must_ go!"" It seemed to her as if she screamed it, as she started suddenly and ran out of the store on wild little feet.But Mr. Atkins, and the men and boys and women and girls left behind, were all staring open-mouthed at the pictures, and spelling out the no less wonderful descriptions of the staring yellow posters with the big flaring letters, so no one noticed her particularly, until the storekeeper tore his gaze away from the man flying through the paper rings, and the other one riding five prancing horses, and remarked, ""I declare, I don't b'lieve I put up that rye flour for Polly Pepper, after all. Well, she'll come back for it, most likely, so I'll get it ready. Three pounds, she said."" So he weighed it out, and tied it up, and set it to one side, saying to the frowsy-haired boy who helped him, ""Jim, that's Mrs. Pepper's little girl's bundle, now remember.""Polly ran across the road, and into Mr. Slimmen's meadow opposite, and to the further end, where she flung herself down on the stone wall, and pushed off the brown hair from her hot forehead. ""O dear me, how could I!"" she cried, twisting her hands tightly together. ""What would Mamsie say! Now she never'll trust me to go to the store again. Oh, I shall cry! O dear, dear!"""
"""_Moo!_"" said Mr. Slimmen's cow, as if she quite understood the matter, and no one need explain. And Polly felt quite comforted, although the dreadful thought of going back into the store nearly overcame her. But remembering that Mamsie would be waiting for her, and worry if she did not soon come back, Polly made a desperate effort and hopped off the stone wall.She had her bundle tucked under her arm, glad that no one had spoken to her; for Jim just pointed to it, when she laid the money down on the counter, and then turned back to study the poster again, and was skipping over the ground, when she met Joel coming at a lively pace down the road.""N-no--not exactly,"" said Joel, digging his bare toes into the sand; ""but I might--might--p'r'aps get a letter, Polly,"" he added, as a bright idea struck him. Mr. Atkins, besides being the storekeeper, was also postmaster.""_Joel_!"" she called, running after him. But as well try to stop the north wind. Joel raced up over the steps and disappeared within the store. Polly, endeavoring to reach him before he saw the yellow and red posters again, put forth all her effort, but stubbed her toe against a big stone, and fell flat. Away flew her bundle of flour--thud went the paper bag, and off came the string, and there it was all spilled on the ground.Joel didn't ask about the letter for Mamsie, but the minute his black eyes fell on those horses careering and prancing and dancing, he was nearly beside himself. And pushing in between the men and boys of the largest group, he stared, spellbound, and lost to everything else.""Now that's too bad!"" said a voice that Polly loved dearly to hear, and some one lifted her up out of the sandy road. The dust was all in her eyes, so she couldn't see for a minute, but she knew 'twas Parson Henderson. ""Well, Polly, I don't believe you are much hurt,"" he said kindly. ""A tumble in the dirt isn't the worst thing in the world, is it?""Polly looked around for her bundle, anxiously. All the while she was saying, ""Oh, thank you, sir. I'm not hurt a bit."" But all the money for the rye flour gone! She could get no more, for Mamsie never had things charged, although Mr. Atkins was quite willing to do so. ""'Tisn't safe,"" Mrs. Pepper always said; ""if I do it once, I may again, so I'll pay as I go.""Parson Henderson looked off the road over his spectacles and saw the rye flour all sprinkled on every side, just where it had flown. ""Now that's too bad!"" he said. ""Well, Polly, they say it's no use to cry over spilt milk, and I suppose spilt flour is just as bad,"" and he took her hand. ""Let us see if Mr. Atkins hasn't some more."" But Polly hung back; still, she must go into the store and get Joel. So she started forward again, and said impulsively, ""I won't get any more flour, please, Mr. Henderson, but Joel's there, and he must come home with me."""
"""I'm intending to get some flour to send to Mrs. Pepper,"" said Parson Henderson, ""and you don't have anything to do about it, but to carry the bundle, Polly,"" he added lightly. So they were presently in the centre of the store. When Mr. Atkins saw the minister, he got away from the red and yellow poster as soon as he could, and came forward, rubbing his hands. So Mr. Henderson, not saying a word about Polly's accident, bought some rye flour, and several other things for the parsonage, chatting pleasantly all the time. But the storekeeper didn't say a word about the circus.""Gee-wheezes!"" exclaimed Joel, his cheeks red as fire, and his black eyes sticking out. ""See, Polly, I can ride as good as that man,"" pointing to the one who had so roused Mr. Atkins' admiration, ""if I had five horses. Yes, sir-_ree_!""""Look at that white horse, Polly!"" cried Joel, quite gone with excitement. ""See him dance, like this, Polly,"" and he slapped his sturdy leg, and kicked out suddenly. Everybody laughed, the farmers guffawing in delight; and one small girl on the edge of the group who burst out, ""Tehe-ee!"" couldn't stop. Joel suddenly turned and saw them all; and he doubled up his little brown fists, and squared his shoulders. ""Stop laughing at me!"" he cried, throwing back his head defiantly, his black eyes sparkling in anger.""Joel!"" commanded Polly, in great distress. Then a hand reached over between them and touched him on the shoulder. ""Come here, my boy,"" said Parson Henderson, and before Joel knew it, there he was marching off out of the store.Parson Henderson said not a word, only, ""Run back, Polly, and get the bundle of rye flour for me. Tell Mr. Atkins I'll step in for the other things."" And Polly, doing as she was bidden, and catching up with them as they walked slowly down the dusty road, heard the minister say, ""Well now, Joel, I should like to go fishing with you some day.""""I haven't been a bad, wicked boy,"" contradicted Joel, in a loud, vehement tone, and stamping with his bare heel in the dust that flew up in their faces in a little cloud, ""so there now, Polly Pepper!"" Polly cried herself to sleep that night, although Mother Pepper had comforted and cuddled her when the whole story had come out on their return; how in a minute the passion had died down when the two children thought of Mamsie as they stood there in the road. ""Joel was the first to be sorry,"" Polly had said generously, when confessing it all.The two children, not having a word to say to this, stood very mournfully in front of her. The bedroom door was shut fast, and Ben was doing his best out in the kitchen to keep the other two children amused, in this unwonted state of affairs.""I've never punished you children since you were big enough to know better,"" said Mother Pepper, slowly, ""and I don't believe I can begin now. And it seems to me it's the best way for you to punish yourselves. So I'll leave you to think over it,"" and she went out and closed the door on them."
"How long they sat there, Polly didn't know, and as for Joel, he was in such a state of mind, he couldn't tell anything, only that Polly and he finally crept out in the gathering dusk of the long afternoon. No one but Mother Pepper ever knew the reason for the many unwelcome little tasks that Joey did after that, and, strange to relate, without a single grumble, while as Polly couldn't very well do more work than she did at present, and as there were no luxuries to give up in the way of eatables, the Peppers having butter and other nice things only when people were good enough to send them some, it is hard to think what she could do to punish herself. But that was Mother Pepper's and Joel's and her secret. And then Mamsie cuddled them and comforted them. Only Polly, when she went to bed that night, felt the tears drop quite fast on her pillow, and that was the last thing she remembered before she dropped to sleep.""But that wouldn't be a very good way: to make other people suffer for your faults,"" Mrs. Pepper had replied. So the work over the little play went on, as if nothing sad had happened. But Polly carried a sorry little face about, until Phronsie would look at her wonderingly, or Davie would forget to smile; on such occasions Mrs. Pepper would look at her and raise her finger warningly, and Polly would exclaim, ""Oh, I forgot,"" and then she would toss them a merry little bit of nonsense that made them happy at once. But down in her heart Polly had many sad thoughts. At last it was the great day. Nobody said ""circus,"" but all the five little Peppers shouted it was the Play Day! And it really didn't rain, and the sky was as blue as could be, and Mamsie stayed home that day, and oh! Polly was quite sure she smelt something very nice, when she raced into the kitchen in the middle of the morning. Mother Pepper had sent them all out to rehearse the play in the orchard, and in the midst of it Polly cried out that she had forgotten the wings she was to put on as fairy godmother, when she appeared in time to rescue the little white cat, and to change her into a small girl again. She had made them, with the greatest trouble, out of thin paper and some old wire, and for fear they would get broken in the woodshed, Mamsie had said she might put them in the lower drawer of the big bureau in the bedroom, where Phronsie's red-topped shoes were always kept wrapped up. So now Polly dashed suddenly into the kitchen to run after them.Mother Pepper was stooping over the oven door, which was open. She closed it quickly, and stood straight. ""Polly,"" she said, and there was a little laugh in her eyes, although her firm lips were closed, ""you are not to say anything what you think to the other children.""""No, Mamsie, I won't,"" promised Polly, with a wild thought at her heart, ""Could Mamsie possibly be making a cake?"" as she rushed into the bedroom, got the wings, and raced out again. And all through the rehearsing she kept thinking how good it smelt when that little whiff from the oven flew out.And Mother Pepper smiled away to herself, and the voices from the orchard, with its one scraggy apple tree, came pealing in through the open window, as the rehearsal for the grand play was in progress. And then the whole bunch of little Peppers hurried off to get some wild flowers, ""for it won't be much,"" Polly had said, ""without some posies to put on the table"" (the big stone Ben had tugged home from Deacon Brown's meadow).When the children came back from roaming the fields and woods, with the blossoms and green vines gathered in their aprons and arms, and they were all nicely set in the cracked teacup with the handle gone that Mamsie had given them some time before, and some other dishes that Mrs. Pepper had handed out with strict charges to be careful of 'em, they all stood off in a row from the stone table, in delighted admiration.""Oh, Joey!"" cried Polly, reproachfully. But her heart jumped at the recollection of the lovely smell that came from the oven, and Mamsie's face. ""Now, children,"" she said, ""we've got everything all done,"" with a quick glance around, ""and Phronsie must have her nap, so's to be a nice little wide-awake white cat. Oh, Ben, leave the fur rug and the other things out under the table,"" as Ben began piling them up to carry back to the woodshed."
"""Oh, you--"" began Polly, passionately, when she turned and saw what was done. In a minute she dashed over to Joel and threw her arms around him. ""You couldn't help it,"" she finished, ""and I can paste a piece of paper over it, and it will be most as good as new,"" while the children stood aghast at the mischief, and Ben exclaimed, ""How could you, Joe! Why didn't you let it alone?""Joel came out of his sobs and looked up to the blue sky, and smiled through his tears, and when David and Phronsie saw Polly so merry, they smiled too, and Ben caught Polly's eye and didn't say any more. So they all marched into the house, and Phronsie was tucked up on Mamsie's bed, for her nap, and Polly sat down to mend her broken wing.Mrs. Pepper, going on with her work, sent her a smile and loving look, that said just as plainly as words could speak it, ""You're trying hard, Polly, my girl, and Mother knows it."" So Polly began to hum at her task, and presently the kitchen became the very cheeriest place possible. What they would have done if any of them had happened to spy out what was on the upper shelf of the cupboard, covered carefully with a clean old towel, cannot possibly be told.At last it came to be three o'clock, the hour of the grand play. Mrs. Pepper, as audience, was seated in her big rocking chair that Ben had brought out from the kitchen and placed in the best spot on the grass to see it all, and Polly and Ben and Joel and David and Phronsie were in the depths of excitement, and flitting here and there, Polly, as chief director, having a perfectly awful time to get them into their parts, particularly as Phronsie would keep rushing up, the old white fur rug nearly tripping her up every step, to lay her soft face against Mother Pepper's, and cry out, ""I'm to be a white cat, Mamsie. I truly am!"" And Joel would insist on roaring like a bear, and prancing and waving his arms, around which Polly had tied a lot of black hair that Mamsie had let her take out of her cushion.Once more Mother Pepper sent her a swift approving smile, and Polly's heart was so warm that a little sunbeam seemed suddenly to have hopped right down there. And the little play went on from first to last perfectly splendidly, and Mrs. Pepper, feeling very strange indeed to be sitting there in the middle of the afternoon with nothing in her hands to work over, clapped them together and applauded enough for a big audience. And there never was such a good time in all this world--no, not even under the big white circus tent over in Hillsbury!""I don't ever want to go in,"" declared Joel, positively, and rolling over on the grass to wave his legs in the air, while little Davie lay quite still. ""It was good to be in the play, Polly,"" he said, ""but it's nice to rest here.""But Joel gave his sturdy legs another wave. ""I wish we could stay out here longer,"" he said. So it happened that he was last in the procession filing into the little brown house, instead of first, as was usually the case.There was the table drawn out in the middle of the kitchen and spread with a clean white cloth. And on it stood a cake, yes, a big one, and there was--yes, there actually was white on top! When Polly saw that, she sat right down in the first chair. As for Ben, he was just as much astonished, and couldn't stop the children from reaching out to pick at the cake.""I took some of your flowers, Polly, to trim it with,"" said Mother Pepper, pointing to the wreath running around the big cake. ""Now, children, all of you sit down, and Polly shall cut it, for she made the play."" She handed Polly the big knife, sharpened up till it shone as bright as could be.""Go on, Polly, Joel's right,"" said Mrs. Pepper, in satisfaction. So the slices were cut very slowly, Polly breathing hard with anxiety. But the white frosting didn't fall off a bit, and each piece was soon laid on a plate by Mother Pepper, and passed, first to Ben and then to the others, and to Phronsie last of all, of course, because she was the youngest."
"Little David said nothing, and turned his gaze downward, and a big green worm, that had somehow lost his way in the tall grass, meandered past him, trying to get home. So he put forth a gentle finger, bending down the biggest spears accommodatingly, and was so absorbed in the matter that he forgot Joel, until he heard a voice, ""Hi, there; look, Dave, look!""""Pooh! I can bend way out. See, Dave! See!"" cried Joel, twisting his legs around the branch on which he sat, almost at the very tip of the apple tree, and he swung both arms exultingly. There was a crack, a swish, and something came tumbling through the air, and before David could utter a sound, there lay Joel on the grass at his feet. Ben picked him up, as Mother Pepper and the others hurried out, on hearing David scream. Joel lay so still and white in Ben's arms that Polly turned quite faint. But when she saw Mamsie's face, she bent over to Phronsie. ""Come here, Pet,"" she tried to say, as she drew her off that she might not see.""Oh, Phronsie, please come,"" begged Polly, still holding her arm. ""See, if you don't, I shall cry."" Which was the truth as the tears were beginning to come in Polly's brown eyes. Seeing this, Phronsie yielded, and pattered along by Polly's side obediently, and allowed her little face to be scrubbed and wiped quite dry, Polly's heart all the while going like a triphammer, and her ears pricked up for any word that might tell her of Joel. At last she could bear it no longer.""Never mind,"" said Polly, with an awful feeling at her heart, it was so still out in the kitchen and bedroom. ""Now, you must do just as I tell you, and not ask me any questions. Polly wants you to do it, to go and sit down on that bench,"" pointing to a little low one in the corner, ""and not stir till I call you.""Polly dropped a hasty kiss on the yellow hair, then fled on unsteady feet through the kitchen and into the bedroom. Mother Pepper was bending over Joel. Ben was holding the bowl of water, and Davie was crying and wringing his hands at the foot of the bed, with his eyes on Joel's face.It seemed an hour. It was really but ten minutes, when a step bounded out in the kitchen. Mrs. Pepper looked at Polly, who stole silently out, and with a gasp almost tumbled into the arms of a little man with very big spectacles. ""Oh, Dr. Fisher!"" she cried, ""I'm _so_ glad!""""And I'm glad, too,"" said little Dr. Fisher, beaming at her. ""Why, what's the matter, Polly, my girl?"" as Polly seemed to be almost tumbling over. ""You see, I've come to take Phronsie to ride. I haven't been able to a good while back,"" he mourned, ""but perhaps you'd better go,"" setting his spectacles to take a keen look at her."
"Little Davie threw himself flat on the floor and cried as hard as he could. Polly ran over to him, ""Why, Davie,"" she cried, getting down on the floor by his side, ""don't you understand? Joel's all well. Dr. Fisher says so.""And then the door opened suddenly, and Ben hurried in with a white, disappointed face. ""He isn't home, and they don't know when--Why!"" for there sat little Dr. Fisher laughing and peering at him over his big spectacles.""Do give him something to eat, Mrs. Pepper,"" said Dr. Fisher, laughing heartily, ""then we'll be off. And Polly, you and I will have a ride next time,"" he said, darting off before Mrs. Pepper had a chance to pay him, or even to thank him.Joel was already in the gig, peeping out at them, and teasing Dr. Fisher to hurry. They had driven off, and been gone some time, when suddenly Polly started in dismay as she was setting the table for supper.But notwithstanding all the wonderful things that happened that day, Joel didn't quite forget the circus, and he whispered to David that night, after they had hopped into bed, and pulled the sheet over their heads, ""I'm goin' to have a circus of my own, so there!""Little David was all worn out with the exciting events of the day, and he didn't hear him, as he fell asleep almost as soon as his head touched the pillow. So Joel, not finding it very much fun to talk when there was no one to listen, closed his eyes, and before he knew it, he was asleep too. Ben, looking across at the two little faces, as he came up into the loft to go to bed, said to himself, ""Well, I'm thankful that Joe's asleep."" And he gave a sigh of relief.The next days were full of work. ""Play can't come all the time,"" Mrs. Pepper observed wisely. She sent Polly down with the money for the doctor's visit, pinned up carefully in a paper, which the little doctor promptly returned the next day, Polly having left it, as he was away on his rounds. So Mrs. Pepper could do nothing but tie it into the old stocking-leg again, in the bureau drawer. ""Children,"" she said, drawing them all up around her, ""we must never forget to do something for Dr. Fisher, and may the Lord give us a chance soon. He's been so good to us.""""Well, I think if Mamsie should come in now,"" warned Polly, for Mrs. Pepper had gone over to Grandma Bascom's--the old lady having been sick for a day or two--and been caught there by the sudden shower, ""and should see you, you'd feel badly, Joey.""At the mention of Mamsie, Joel's grasp on Davie's arm dropped, and he slunk back. Then Ben pulled him into a place next to him, quiet was restored, and Polly was soon launched on one of her wonderful stories, ""Mr. Kangaroo and the silly little Duck,"" and presently they were all so absorbed that no one noticed the sun was shining brightly, until they heard a voice, ""Well, I declare, sitting down in the day-time to tell stories!""""Ugh!"" cried Joel, taking one look at their visitor. ""I should think,"" said Miss Jerusha, the minister's sister, in a very tart voice, and raising her black mitts very high, ""that children as old as you are could find some work to do, without sitting down to fold your hands and tell good-for-nothing stories.""""Our mother's just right,"" said Ben, slowly getting to his feet. There was a light in his pale blue eyes as he bent them on Miss Jerusha, that made her look away a minute, but she soon returned to the charge. ""_I_ never was allowed to sit idle in the day-time,"" she said, ""when I was a little girl."""
"""I am very glad I came,"" said Miss Jerusha, sitting up stiff and tall, ""for you children need some instruction, I can plainly see. Poor things! well, it's not to be wondered at, when we consider you've had no bringing up.""""We have had bringing up, Miss Jerusha,"" said Ben. ""Children, you go into the bedroom, and shut the door, and stay there,"" he said to the three little ones. And never having seen him so before, the two boys went off wonderingly, without a word, and holding Phronsie by the hands. ""Our mother is our mother,"" went on Ben, proudly, ""the very best mother in all the world, and she's brought us up, oh, how she has worked to bring us up! and if we're naughty, it's all our own fault!"" It was a long speech for Ben to make, and Polly stared at him in an amazement mingled with pride, while her breast heaved, and she clasped her hands tightly together, so afraid she should speak a word and spoil it all, for Miss Jerusha was really uncomfortable, that they could both see.""Ugh!"" they could hear Joel exclaim, as he jumped clear of the window sill to the grass beneath; but they didn't know that the old cracked pane of glass had given away under his hand, nor that a little stream of blood was trickling down his wrist, as he raced over through the lane, and rushed into Grandma Bascom's little cottage. ""The land sakes!"" exclaimed Grandma Bascom, seeing him first. She was propped up in bed, and Mrs. Pepper was heating some gruel on the stove out in the shed. ""What's the matter?"" as Joel held his arm out, and the blood was dripping down his little blouse.""I can't come,"" said Mrs. Pepper, not turning around, ""till I fix Grandma comfortable. And for shame, Joel, to speak so of Miss Jerusha! Remember how good Parson Henderson is to us; and his wife, too.""""Why--Joel. Hain't you seen it?"" screamed Grandma, who, like a great many deaf people, always spoke her loudest, especially when she was excited. ""The blood was all runnin' like everything down his arm. I guess he's most cut it off,"" she added with a groan, for Grandma always had a warm spot in her heart for Joel.Mrs. Pepper's face grew very pale, and she set the cup of gruel down hastily on the little stand by the bed-head, where Grandma could reach it. Then she hurried to the door. ""_Joel_!"" she called, prepared to run over home if he didn't answer.It wasn't a moment, then, before Mother Pepper had him in the kitchen and the blood washed off, and as well as she could see, for the little stream that flowed again, she found out where the trouble was, in the long zigzag cut down the fleshy part of Joel's little brown hand.""Oh, it often comes on when they're old,"" answered Mrs. Pepper, who had been searching all this time in all the cracked bowls and cups for the scraps of court plaster. ""It will be such a piece of work to get her to tell me where it is,"" she said to herself."
"""O dear me!"" exclaimed Mrs. Pepper, seeing the bandage of old cloth, which was quite red and damp. ""Go and sit down and hold your hand still. I must ask Grandma where that court plaster is. I know she has some, because when Polly cut her finger, you know, Grandma gave her a piece.""So she put her ear close to Grandma's cap-border, and after a great deal of explaining on Mother Pepper's part, and as many interruptings on Grandma Bascom's, who wanted everything said over again, at last it was known that the court plaster lay between the leaves of the big Bible, on the stand under the old looking-glass between the windows.""Don't do that, Joey,"" commanded Mother Pepper, quickly, ""you'll make it bleed worse'n ever. Dear me! I should think it was wet!"" suppressing a shiver, as she rapidly unwound the old cloth, now very red. ""Come here, over the basin."" And presently the poor hand was washed off again with warm water, the long cut closed, and the strip of black court plaster stuck firmly over the wound.""You can go and let her see it, Joey, now that it's all done up nicely. There's no use in trying to tell her,"" said Mother Pepper, clearing away the traces of the accident. So Joel hopped up on the big bed again and displayed his wounded hand, and Grandma oh-ed and dear me-ed over it, and then she reached over to the little drawer in the stand at the head of the bed.Joel's black eyes stuck out as he saw the big peppermint drops, pink ones and white ones, rolling round in the drawer the minute it was pulled open. ""Can I have as many as I want, Grandma?"" he screamed, hopping off from the bed to hang over the drawer.""I'm glad I hurt it!"" exclaimed Joel. ""O my! what a lot, Grandma!"" which Grandma didn't hear, only she knew he was pleased by the sight of his chubby face; so she smiled, too. Mrs. Pepper found them so when she came up to the bed.""Take care, Joey, you don't take too many,"" said Mrs. Pepper. ""Grandma's good to you, so you must be good to her, and come right home from here. You may stay half an hour,"" pointing to the old clock. ""Miss Jerusha will be gone by that time,"" she said to herself with a grim smile.""I guess you'd find out if you had it,"" said Mrs. Pepper, grimly. ""Why, you can't open your jaws. Let go of my gown, Joel. I must hurry home."" And with visions of Miss Jerusha in the little brown house, she hurried off as fast as she could down the lane."
"""Huh!"" exclaimed Joel, left quite alone staring after her. ""I guess I ain't going to have any old lockjaw. And I could open my jaws, too."" Thereupon wide apart flew his two sets of white teeth, at such a distance that he seemed to be all mouth. Then he snapped them together again so quickly that it made him wink violently; repeating this operation till he was quite convinced that nothing should ever be the matter with his jaws. ""And if they ever do get locked up, I'm goin' to keep the key myself."" Then he ran back to his peppermint drops again, quite satisfied. Grandma Bascom was sound asleep.Joel softly moved two pink peppermint drops over to one side of the drawer, and set two white ones next to them. ""They're awful small,"" he said to himself, and changed the pink ones for two others of the same color. Then the same thought occurring to him in regard to the white ones, those had to go back and two different white ones take their places. Then he drew back, and gazed at them admiringly.""I don't s'pose Mamsie'd care if I took one more, if 'twas a little one,"" he presently thought. But the difficulty was, should it be a pink one or a white one? It took Joel so long to decide this, that at last he put one of each over in his collection at the side of the drawer, then hastily pushed the rest of Grandma's into a pile at one end. ""There, she's got a lot,"" he exclaimed. And as he looked at them, the pile seemed to grow bigger yet; so he picked off one, a great pink drop, from the very top.""Now I must get a white one to match it,"" he said, fumbling over the pile till he had flattened it quite out. They looked so many more when this was done, that Joel felt quite right in extracting the last two. ""It might a' made her sick. P'r'aps she's been eating too many."" And as this thought struck him, he pulled out two more, picked up the ones he had set to one side, slammed to the drawer, by this time realizing that Grandma could not hear, and ran out of the bedroom to the ""laylock"" bushes, where he sat down to enjoy the peppermint drops.He had demolished the third one, eating as slowly as possible, in a way Phronsie had of nibbling around the edges to make it last as long as possible; and then, with his cut hand, there wasn't anything he could do; when suddenly Mamsie's words, ""Be good to Grandma,"" swept through his mind, with an awful twinge. Joel stopped eating and looked at the heap of pink and white peppermint drops he had laid down on the grass by his side; then turned his back to them, and began his nibbling again. ""She's got enough,"" he said, munching on. ""She said, take as many's I wanted. So there now!""But in a minute he had hopped to his feet, and snatched up the pink and white pile, raced through the kitchen and into the bedroom, and twitching open the drawer to the little stand, he dumped his fistful in, all except one. Then, without trusting himself to look at them, he slammed the drawer quite tight, and leaning over Grandma, he put his mouth close to her cap-border where she lay snoring away. ""I put 'em all back, Grandma,"" he whispered, ""except four."""
"Something made him glance up at the old clock. It was five minutes past the half hour, and Joel, with a dreadful feeling at his heart, for disobedience was a thing Mamsie never overlooked, fled over to the little brown house. ""I declare, that's fine!"" said Ben, the next day. It was dull and cloudy, and he squinted up at the sky. ""There isn't a bit of wind. Now Mr. Blodgett'll have that bonfire, I guess; that'll suit you, Joe, as you can't have much fun with that hand.""""Ben never let's me do anything,"" howled Joel, twisting his face up into a dreadful knot, and wishing there was something he could do with his left hand, for the other was all tied up in a sling, Mother Pepper wisely concluding that to be the only way to keep it still. ""If I tie it up, Joel, you can't use it,"" she had said, fastening the broad strip of white cloth firmly over his shoulder. And Joel, knowing there was no use in protesting, had borne it as well as he could, making Davie wait on him, and driving Polly almost to despair in her efforts to amuse him, while she did up the morning work, Mother Pepper being away. ""Why don't you play stage-coach, Joel?"" proposed Polly now, as Joel couldn't vent his disappointment loudly enough.""So I can,"" cried Joel, bounding away from the window, ""so I can, Polly Pepper. I'll have it right now, and it's to be a perfectly awful one. Come on, Dave, let's fix up the coach, and you get inside, and I'll upset you, and most smash everything to death."" And Joel ran hither and thither, dragging the chairs, and Phronsie's little cricket, and everything movable into place as well as he could with one hand.""I'm goin' to have 'em do both,"" decided Joel. ""Dave, pull this up, will you?"" So little David ran and gave a lift on the other side of the big rocking chair, to haul it into place. ""We'll run into somethin' an' th' horse'll shy, and that'll make the old stage-coach roll down hill. Gee-whickets!"" he brought up, in huge delight.Joel was clambering up into Mr. Tisbett's seat on the box, but he ducked his head at Polly's rebuke. ""Get in, Dave,"" he shouted, recovering himself. ""Hurry up. You're the passenger that wants to go to Boxford. You're awful slow. I'll drive off without you if you don't make haste,"" he threatened, gathering up in his left hand the bits of string that were fastened to a nail in the corner of the shelf.Little David, feeling it a dreadful calamity to be left behind when he wanted to go to Boxford, hopped nimbly into the opening in the pile of chairs that represented the stage-coach, and off they drove.""I can't hold my whip,"" cried Joel in distress, after a minute or so of bowling along on the road to Boxford, accompanied with much shouting to Mr. Tisbett's pair of black horses, and excitement generally as the stage-driver tried to get out of the way of the great number of teams on the turnpike. ""O dear, it ain't any fun without the whip!"" and the whole establishment came to a dead stop."
"""Goody, oh, so she might!"" cried Joel, ""and Seraphina too. And that'll make more upset. Then you may come up here, Dave,"" he promised. But when Polly was made acquainted with this fine plan, she refused to allow Phronsie to enter into such a noisy play. And Joel's face dropped so dismally that she was at her wits' end to know how to straighten out the trouble. Just then one of the Henderson boys came up to the door with a little pat of butter in a dish for Mrs. Pepper.""He might be the passenger,"" said Joel, thinking busily, as Polly ran to the door to let the Henderson boy in. ""We'll play he's the minister goin' over to preach in Boxford, and we'll upset him just before he gets there. Jump out, Dave, and get up here.""""I don't know as we ought to upset him if he's the minister,"" objected David, doubtfully, as he clambered up to Joel's side. Still, a perfect thrill of delight seized him at his promotion to the seat of honor, and his little hands trembled as Joel laid the precious whip within them.""No, I guess I'd rather you had the reins,"" decided Joel, twitching away the whip to lay the bits of string in David's little brown hands. ""You can drive first, 'cause I want to crack the whip awful loud as we start. And then I'll take 'em again.""David, who would much rather have cracked the whip, said nothing, feeling it bliss enough to be up there on the box and doing something, as Peletiah, a light-haired, serious boy, walked slowly into the kitchen.Peletiah considered so long over this that Joel, drumming with his heels on the dashboard, got tired out, and shouted, ""Hurry up and get in--th' stage-coach's goin'!"" which had the desired effect, to make the passenger skip in much livelier than he intended.""He said he didn't want to go to Boxford,"" put in little David, trembling all over at the vast responsibility of holding in Mr. Tisbett's black horses, and the passenger's being taken where he didn't want to go.Davie held his breath, and clutched the lines tighter yet, and Joel screamed shrilly, ""Look out!"" and gave an awful kick with his heels to the back of the top chair, and before anybody could say a word, over it came, knocking Davie with it, and before the passenger could get out, Mr. Tisbett and his assistant and the best part of the whole establishment seemed to be on top of him.Polly heard the noise and came rushing out. ""Oh, boys--boys!"" she cried in a fright, ""are you hurt?"" for everything seemed to be in a heap together, with some small legs kicking wildly about, trying to extricate the persons to whom they belonged.Joel looked down quickly at the big white bundle in the sling. ""There ain't nothin'--"" He was going to say, ""the matter with my hand, Polly,"" when he saw some very red spots spreading quickly along its surface.""Oh, I'll fix it, Joe,"" she exclaimed in haste, though how she managed to get the words out she never knew. ""Let me see, Mamsie would untie it if she were here, and put on court plaster. Now, David, you run over to Grandma's and ask her to give us some more. She told us to come if we wanted it, and I'll put on a fresh piece just as tight, oh, you can't think!"" Polly kept talking all the time, feeling that she should drop if she didn't, and little David, forgetting all about the lump on his forehead, that now was most as big as an egg, ran off as fast as he could, and presently returned with the court plaster, waving it over his head."
"""This afternoon,"" said Polly. ""Ben's over there, and Joel's goin', and David."" All the while she was dabbing off the blood running out of the side where the court plaster slipped when the stage went over. Then she cut off another bit from the piece Grandma sent over, and quickly pasted it over the edge of the old piece. ""There now, Joey,"" she cried, ""that's as nice as can be! Now I'll get you a fresh piece of cloth to tie it up in.""""Oh, you must have 'em tied up,"" cried Polly, decisively, running back with the cloth. ""Hold your hand still, Joe; there now, says I, that's all done!"" She gave a great sigh of relief, when at last Joel's arm was once more in its sling.""I guess I'll go to that bonfire,"" observed Peletiah. At the sound of his voice, Polly came to herself with a little gasp. ""Oh, I forgot all about you, Peletiah, and David's head. I'll see your shin first, 'cause you're company.""When Peletiah's small trouser leg was pulled up, Polly saw with dismay a black and blue spot rapidly spreading. ""O dear me,"" she cried, down on her knees, ""what will dear Mrs. Henderson say? and she's so good to us!""""Well, David, you must just run back and ask Grandma if we may have a little wormwood,"" said Polly. ""I'd go, but I don't like to leave you children alone,"" in distress as she saw Davie's lump on his forehead, and his hot, tired face. ""I'm sorry, for you've just been over.""""She said--Grandma did--pound it up and tie it on with a rag, if you haven't got time to steep it,"" said Davie, relinquishing the bundle into Polly's hand, ""and to put some on my head, too,"" he added, feeling this to be a calamity as much worse as could be imagined than to have on the brown paper bits.This operation was somewhat delayed by all three of the boys hanging over her and getting in the way. And Phronsie, who had been busy with Seraphina in the bedroom, now running out to add herself to the number, it was a little time before Peletiah's small leg had the wet rag tied on. But that afternoon it began to rain smartly, so nobody went to the bonfire after all. ""P'r'aps,"" Polly had kept saying to herself, ""all Mr. Atkins' sacks will be sewed up by the next time Mr. Blodgett tries to burn up his rubbish, and then I can go,"" but she didn't speak a word to her mother, for then Mrs. Pepper would find out how dreadfully disappointed Polly had been at the thought of not seeing the grand spectacle. So she worked on busily, expecting every day to hear Ben say, ""Now we're goin' to set it off to-day,"" for he was at work pretty steadily now, for Farmer Blodgett. But he never did.At last one day, Ben came home very late to supper, so late that Polly ran to the window ever so many times, exclaiming, ""Bensie never was so late before."" Phronsie had long been in bed, and the boys were anxiously looking up at the clock to see if it were anywhere near half-past seven, when Ben came in.""Well, I don't care,"" said Polly, recklessly, ""it was perfectly awfully mean, Mamsie, to go and have that bonfire without telling us a single thing about it. Now we can't one of us ever see it,"" she mourned."
"""So I have,"" cried Ben, with a dreadful feeling at his heart that his comrade Polly blamed him. ""Mr. Blodgett told me I mustn't run home and tell you, though I begged him as hard as I could to let me.""""And he's been bothered to death to get the right time to work on that old bonfire, and today the men said the rubbish ought to be got off, 'cause two of 'em can come only a day more, and they want to get the ground ready for planting. So all of a sudden Mr. Blodgett comes over to the south meadow and calls out, 'Come, boys, we're going to set to on that bonfire!' And then I begged him to let me just run home and tell you all, and he couldn't, and that's all,"" said Ben, calmly finishing the account.So no one saw the wonderful Blodgett bonfire, after all, except Peletiah Henderson, who was going past that farm when the excitement was at its height. But Ben comforted them all, and Polly helped out wonderfully, by repeating everything he said. ""Now, children, I'll watch; there'll be other bonfires, I expect. Maybe before long; so I shouldn't wonder if we got another chance to see a big fire."" It came sooner than they expected, but it wasn't a bonfire.It was one night about a week after. The little brown house was as still as a mouse, everybody abed and asleep. Suddenly Phronsie woke up with a fretful little cry. ""I want a drink of water,"" she wailed, sitting straight in the trundle bed.Phronsie's little lips quivered. In the darkness Polly couldn't see the small face and its sorrowful eyes, so she turned over again on her pillow. ""Go to sleep, like a good girl,"" she said, almost asleep.""I can't, Polly,"" said Phronsie, almost ready to cry out, ""and I am truly thirsty. Please, Polly, a drink of water."" She put out her little hand to feel for Polly's, but in a minute the regular breathing told her that Polly had fallen asleep. So Phronsie sat still in the middle of the trundle bed, and choked back the tears.""I won't wake poor Polly up,"" she said; ""I can get it myself,"" and she crawled out of the trundle bed, having some difficulty in getting over the side, and made her way out into the kitchen. It was very bright there, at which Phronsie stared wonderingly, as there was no candle lighted, so she easily found her way to the pail of water which Ben always got the last thing at night and set on the bench by the window.""I can reach the dipper,"" said Phronsie, standing on tiptoes, and seizing it, she thrust it into the pail. How it happened, she didn't know, and there was no one else there to see, but over with a great clatter came the pail and the dipper to the floor.Polly started up in bed. Mamsie, who was very tired, still slept on. ""Phronsie,"" cried Polly, remembering in a flash about the drink of water, ""I'll get it for you,"" and she put out her hand to pat the little figure in the trundle bed. There was no Phronsie there!Polly hopped wildly out into the kitchen, to hear Phronsie gurgling out her distress, as she stood in her little white nightie, her hands stuck straight out, and the water dripping from her every pore. The pail and dipper were rolling away at their own sweet wills across the old kitchen floor. And over all shone a great light as bright as day, only it was tinged with red."
"""Phronsie Pepper!"" exclaimed Polly, and ""What's this light?"" all in the same breath. And huddling Phronsie up in her arms, Polly raced along to the window. A great burst of light, red and glaring, shot across the sky, and lighted up the whole heavens.She could hear Ben spring out of bed, and Mrs. Pepper was in the kitchen in a minute, and Joel and David were tumbling downstairs at Ben's heels, and they all threw on their clothes and rushed out of doors. But it wasn't Grandma Bascom's. Her little cottage stood peaceful and quiet, with only the dreadful red light playing over it.""I can't think where it is,"" said Ben. ""It seems so near, and we know it isn't, 'cause Grandma's is the only house for more'n half a mile."" Meanwhile, the smoke was pouring into the sky, and when it cleared there was that dreadful red light glare again. ""Oh, Ben!"" exclaimed Polly, with clasped hands, as they all stood in front of the little brown house, breathlessly watching, ""it must be Parson Henderson's.""He was afraid to cry, lest she should send him in the house, so he ran out into the road and watched impatiently to see if anybody was coming along to go to the fire. Presently they all heard wagon wheels.""No,"" said Mrs. Pepper, ""it's no use to ask it, Joel,"" and he knew it wasn't. ""It's hard enough to let Ben go, though that's his duty. You can ask the people in the wagon if they know where the fire is."" And Joel, delighted that there was some part in the excitement for him, tore madly down to the roadside and demanded this of the people in the team.""Polly,"" said Mrs. Pepper, her face looking ghastly in the red light, ""this is perfectly dreadful for poor Mrs. Blodgett and the good deacon. Oh, if we could only help them!"" She looked off at the clouds of smoke now obscuring the red glare, and her hands usually so quiet were wringing each other.""Polly,"" said Phronsie, suddenly raising her head where she had hidden it on Polly's arm, ""do you suppose Mr. Blodgett's nice mooly cow is going to burn up?"" She clasped her fat hands as she brought out the question fearfully.""No, I hope not, Pet,"" said Polly, soothingly. ""Don't let's think of it,"" but her heart ached, nevertheless. How good Mrs. Blodgett had been to send down that sweet, rich milk, once in a while, for Phronsie.""No,"" said Mrs. Pepper, ""I don't b'lieve God had anything to do with it, Davie. Like enough it's some man been in there with a pipe, but we'll hope the fire'll be put out. And don't you be troubled; God wouldn't let any one be hurt, least of all a good man like Deacon Blodgett."""
"And when Ben came home in the early dawn--Mamsie and the rest of the bunch of the little Peppers sitting up for him, for Phronsie wouldn't go to bed, so Polly held her in her arms--they found this was just the case.""Oh, Ben,"" cried Joel, ""you're as black as you can be! How I wish I could 'a' gone!"" he added, feeling it the highest state of bliss to come home looking like that from working in a fire. ""Well, I feel black,"" said Ben, and down went his head lower yet in his hands. Joel was walking along the road very slowly, swinging on his arm the tin pail that was to bring home the molasses. ""I wish some one would come along who'd give me a ride,"" he thought, feeling hot, and wishing he were home, to lie on the cool grass in the orchard, after he had first drunk all he wanted to at the well.Mr. Peters slackened up as he passed Joel, but he didn't offer to let him ride. And Joel didn't want to, anyway. After a grumpy look at the Pepper boy, the old man in the wagon put the well-worn leather reins between his knees and took out a battered pocket-book, scowling above its contents as he went over a business transaction just completed at Badgertown. Then he slapped it together and stuck it into his pocket, and seizing the reins, he doubled them up, cutting the horse across the thin flanks.Joel stepped back into the middle of the road, and began to trudge along in the wake of the wagon. Suddenly he stopped, and stared at something shining in the road. It was little and round, but it sent up a bright gleam that found an answering one in Joel's black eyes.""I don't care,"" said Joel, defiantly, to himself, ""he left it in the road. It's mine, now, for I picked it up."" And he clutched it tightly in his warm little palm, and dug his heels into the hot sand, glad enough he had had to go to the store after that molasses, for otherwise he wouldn't have found that cent.""It doesn't belong to you."" It seemed as if Mamsie was walking there beside him, and had said the words, and involuntarily Joel glanced on either side. ""I don't know as he dropped it,"" he said to himself, walking very fast, and trying to shake off the unwelcome thoughts; ""I didn't see him.""Mr. Peters looked back and shook his whip at him. ""I ain't a-goin' to give you a ride,"" he said, ""an' you needn't think you can catch on behind."" So he gave the horse another cut, that made him amble along at his best speed.Joel chased as long as he was able to, the perspiration streaming from his red face, screaming when he could find breath, ""Stop, Mr. Peters, a minute,"" till Mr. Peters shook his fist at him as well as his whip. At last Joel dropped from sheer exhaustion on the roadside grass.""That Pepper boy--th' one they call Joel--is a perfect nuisance,"" snarled Mr. Peters, after putting his horse up in the barn, and going into the house. ""I passed him on the road, and he looked as if he 'xpected me to give him a lift.""""S'pose he was,"" said Mr. Peters, going into the keeping room to sit down over the weekly paper. ""I warn't a-goin' to take him up; and then the imperdent little chap started to run after me, a-yellin' all the way. I'd a horsewhipped him if I c'd 'a' reached him."""
"""Well, I ain't a-goin' to have 'em round me,"" snarled Mr. Peters. ""An' there ain't no call for you to say any more about's fur's I know, Marindy,"" and he jerked open the newspaper, put his feet on the round of another chair, got his spectacles out of their case and on his nose, and prepared to be comfortable. He never knew when his paper slid to the floor, and his bald head was bobbing over his empty hands. Mrs. Marinda Peters was upstairs sorting rags to give the rag-man when next he came by, the only way she could earn a little money for her own use, and the daughter was away; so Joel Pepper walked in without any one's knowing it. He had knocked and knocked at the kitchen door until his knuckles were sore, and tired of waiting, concluded to walk in by himself; for go home he would not, with Mr. Peters' cent in his pocket. So he marched in and stood by the old man's chair.""Your cent,"" said Joel, holding it out. ""A cent? I hain't any money to give ye,"" snarled old Mr. Peters, now fully aroused, ""And d'ye git out of this house soon's ye can, or I'll give ye suthin' to git for."" His spectacles slipped to the end of his nose as he started to get out of the chair.""What's the matter?"" asked Mrs. Peters, at the sound of the voices; and, leaving the rag-bag suddenly, she hurried over the stairs. Old Mr. Peters, hearing her coming, picked up the cent, and, not stopping to put it in the old leather pocket-book, slipped it into his vest pocket, and seizing the newspaper, fell to reading.But Mrs. Peters was as persistent in her way as her husband, and she soon had the whole story laid bare. When that was done, she took Joel into the buttery and gave him a big wedge of custard pie. ""You better go t'other way, and not past the keepin' room window,"" she said, ""and eat it.""Joel, with enthusiasm considerably abated as he examined his pie in the shadow of the big seringa bushes, concluded he didn't want it very much. But feeling very hungry, which was his usual condition, he finished it to the last crumb. ""There warn't any sugar in, for one thing,"" he said critically. ""I wonder why folks can bake pies who don't know how, and Mamsie never can have any.""""Well, I sh'd think anybody who'd got a heart in their bosom 'ud feel sorry for them five little Pepperses. I don't s'pose they see a cent to spend from one year's end to another."" And she made up her mind to bake a whole custard pie, sometime, and smuggle it down to Mrs. Pepper.""But 'twas horrid,"" cried Joe. ""I can't help it, Mamsie. There wasn't any sugar in it, and it was black and smutty and thin. Why don't we ever have any pie in the little brown house, Mamsie?"" he asked suddenly.""It isn't going to fly--it isn't,"" he declared, quite relieved. Polly humming away some merry nonsense to Mamsie, neither of them heard him. So he came close to their chairs and repeated it: ""Say, the little brown house can't fly away--there ain't any wings."""
"""You take care you don't say anything discontented about not having pie and other things,"" said Mother Pepper with a smile, looking off from her work for a minute to let her eyes rest on his face, ""and I guess the wings won't grow, Joey.""""A real boy?"" persisted David. ""Yes, of course,"" answered Mother Pepper, moving her chair to get a little more of the waning light. ""But I don't know what kind of a boy,"" she added. ""I don't think he was a very nice boy, Mamsie,"" declared David. ""Not a real, very splendid one."" ""Children,"" said Mrs. Pepper, and how her eyes shone! ""I've got something very nice to tell you--that is, for Joel and David. Your turn will come sometime, Polly,"" and Mother Pepper smiled encouragingly at her.""Polly's turn never comes,"" said Ben, gloomily, who felt dreadfully fretted to think he couldn't earn money enough to do something nice for her. ""We eat it all up as fast as we get paid,"" he had once said to his mother.""Thank you, Ben,"" she said, going up to his chair to lay her hand on his shoulder. ""Mother doesn't know what she'd do if her big boy failed her. Well now, children, I must hurry and tell you the good news about Joel and David. Mr. Tisbett has invited them to go on the stage to-morrow to Strawberry Hill.""Once a week Mr. Tisbett ran the stage down to Strawberry Hill, returning by the East District. It was quite the prettiest ride out of Badgertown, following now and then the course of Cherry brook, and past fertile fields and forests, by a winding, rambling thoroughfare. And when once the settlement of Strawberry Hill was reached, there were Green's Tavern and the stop for dinner!Joel and David could hardly sleep that night for thinking of the splendid treat of the morrow. Oh, if it should rain! They trembled as they rolled over on their backs and listened for any chance pattering on the roof.""Mamsie said we were to be good boys,"" said David, after a pause, in which Joel was lost in the wildest imaginings of sometime driving Mr. Tisbett's black horses. ""Don't you know she did, Joey?"" twitching his arm.""I guess I'll hold 'em in two hands,"" he said at last, ""'cause most likely he won't let me take the whip at the same time. Ain't I glad I haven't cut the right one any more!"" He held it up and squinted at it as well as he could for the darkness. There wasn't even a scar to be seen, thanks to Mother Pepper's good care.""Boys--boys, go to sleep,"" called Polly's voice over the stairs. ""They're so excited,"" she said, going back to her mother, ""about tomorrow. Mamsie, isn't it good that they're going?"" she cried, with shining eyes."
"""That's only every day,"" said Polly, who dearly loved to fix up with extra preparations on important occasions. ""And this--why, Joel Pepper, you've never been away on a journey before. Just think, you're going on a stage-coach clear over to Strawberry Hill!""""Oh, Polly,"" cried Joel, viewing her soapy cloth in alarm, ""you've done it enough. Mamsie,"" he howled, ""Polly's a-washing me just dreadful."" But Mother Pepper did not seem to hear, so Polly finished, and then began on Joel's hair.""Well, he's done now,"" said Polly, pushing back the damp rings of hair from her own brow, while she pulled Joel's jacket straight with the other hand. ""Now, Joe, if you go and sit down and don't move, you'll be all nice when Mr. Tisbett comes; and I'll take Davie.""To little David the whole task of washing and combing his hair, and arranging him in his neatly mended best clothes, was one long, tremulous delight. He wouldn't have had it omitted for the world. At last he was patted and brushed, and pronounced ""just perfect,"" Polly sealing her approval by a kiss that she meant for his forehead, but it fell on the tip of his nose instead.""Mr. Tisbett's come! Mr. Tisbett's come!"" roared Joel, as if everybody couldn't see and hear the stage-driver's hearty tones, to say nothing about the stamping of the horses and the rumble of the wheels. And darting out, he flew over the grass. ""Let me sit up there with you, Mr. Tisbett,"" he screamed, trying to get up on the wheel.""Sho, there! So you may. Give us your hand, Joe, my boy,"" said Mr. Tisbett, brimming over with good humor, and a warm feeling at heart at making the Peppers so happy, and he put out his brawny hand, gave a jerk, and in a minute there was Joel smiling and shouting and waving his hat to David and the others escorting him down to the roadside.""I'm a-goin' to have you up top here, along of me,"" said Mr. Tisbett, ""so's I can look out for you. And I'm a-goin' to tell where you'll set, too, Joel. Now, you just hist over there, and let Davie in betweenst us; he's littler. There you be,"" as Joel promptly obeyed and took the outside seat.""Crack-snap!"" went Mr. Tisbett's whip. Off pranced the two black horses, and round went the wheels. He never made such a fine start in his life, Mr. Tisbett decided, when suddenly, ""Stop! oh, stop!"" screamed Joel, and the stage-driver, looking around at him, saw his face convulsed with the effort not to cry, as he yelled again, flinging out his hands frantically, ""Stop!""""Sho!"" cried Mr. Tisbett, ""so you shall. There. Now then!"" Joel, in some way, was lifted up and swung clear of the wheel, when he set out for a run to the little brown house. Mrs. Pepper and Polly and Ben were standing still in the front yard and watching them, while Phronsie was making cheeses, holding out her little pink calico frock to sink slowly in a puff on the grass."
"""I know you will, Joel,"" said Mrs. Pepper, drawing him close to her, while she kissed and fondled him to his heart's content. Then he rushed back again. Mr. Tisbett leaned down and gave him his brawny hand once more, and up he flew. ""Crack! snap!"" went the whip--off pranced the horses--round went the wheels--and away they all went!Joel hung to the railing of the seat against which he leaned, with a blissful feeling that he was rushing through the air, and he saw nothing but those black horses below him. As for little Davie, he didn't dare to breathe, but peered out from his place between Mr. Tisbett's long, square figure and Joel, seeing nothing, only conscious that everything was perfectly beautiful.Mr. Tisbett slackened up after about a mile of this sort of driving. He always liked to give a good impression in going through the town. Folks invariably rushed to the windows, and said, ""The stage is going by,"" and they never seemed to be tired of such amusement. So Mr. Tisbett always gratified them to the fullest extent. To-day, as he hadn't many passengers till he came to the Four Corners, he let the horses go at their utmost speed, occasionally glancing at the rapt faces of the Pepper boys, when he would roll his quid from one cheek to the other, and smile in great satisfaction.""And you've said it about right,"" declared Mr. Tisbett, the smile dropping away from his jolly face, but the satisfaction remaining. ""And I love them two horses's if they was folks. Fact!"" And Mr. Tisbett slapped the toe of his big boot with his whip. ""Now Jerry's a trifle the smartest, and--""""Hey--sho, now!"" exclaimed Mr. Tisbett, relaxing his tight grip on the reins. ""You've waked up, have ye? Well, you set back and hang on to that there railing, or you'll break your neck. Then what would your Ma say to me? and I shouldn't never take you again.""""They're both good; good as gold,"" Mr. Tisbett here made haste to say. ""An' sometimes I think one's better'n t'other, an' then again I don't know. So, boys, the only way to fix it up straight is to like 'em both best. Well, we're comin' to my first passenger,"" and the stage-driver chirked up the horses. ""Now step lively there."" And presently the turn of the road brought them to a white house with green blinds and a big piazza across one end."
"David glanced up in terror at Mr. Tisbett's shaggy head under the big straw hat, and then at the tall woman who was to take it off. ""Joel,"" he whispered, ""we mustn't let her."" But Joel had no ears for anything that Davie might say, but was occupied in seeing the stage-driver flourish up to meet the passenger.""'Twould 'a' been a sight easier to 'a' waited in th' house,"" observed Mr. Tisbett, composedly, proceeding to pack the array of boxes and bags in the coach, ""bein's I warn't schedooled to reach here till quarter past seven. And it's just three minutes to that time now, Marm."" He stopped to pull out an immense silver watch, the only thing that could draw Joel's attention from the black horses. Now he stared at it until it disappeared again in Mr. Tisbett's waistcoat pocket.""Well, you needn't waste the time now,"" said Mrs. Beaseley, in asperity. ""I'm sure there's little enough left. Put that carpet bag in careful, Mr. Tisbett; it's got some cups and sassers in I'm a-takin' to my daughter in Strawberry Hill.""""All right, Marm,"" said Mr. Tisbett, setting the carpet bag, that seemed in danger of bursting, so full was it packed, on one of the seats. ""I hain't never broke any o' my passengers' belongings yet, and I'm too old to begin to-day."" To which Mrs. Beaseley deigned no reply, only to say, ""You put 'em all in, and I'll get in last.""""I shan't set foot in that stage till all my things is in, and packed to suit me,"" declared Mrs. Beaseley, positively. ""You gimme the bird;"" with that she seized the bird-cage, and holding it well before her, she stepped up the first step. The next minute she was precipitated on the floor of the stage, with the birdcage under her. When she was helped up, and the bird-cage was set on the seat opposite, Mr. Tisbett slammed to the stage door quickly, and hopped nimbly to the box, leaving her straightening her bonnet. All the while she was giving vent to a torrent of abuse because the stage-coach steps were too high, the bird screaming and fluttering wildly in fright.""Hey?"" exclaimed Mr. Tisbett, staring at him. ""What's the boy mean? Oh,--my soul an'--body!"" And he slapped his thigh with his brawny hand, and burst out into a hearty laugh that seemed to echo on every side, as the stage-coach spun along.""I sh'd think you'd laugh,"" exclaimed Mrs. Beaseley, in withering scorn, inside the vehicle, ""when I've smashed my best bonnet, and shook that bird to death--like enough he'll die--and tromped all up the front breadth to my dress."" But as there was no one to hear her, and Mr. Tisbett still laughed on, seeming unable to stop himself, the stage-coach contributed a very merry spectacle to those privileged to see it, as they bowled along to the next passenger for Strawberry Hill.The next passenger was a thin, wiry little man, who seemed to beg pardon constantly for being in somebody's way. And after Mr. Tisbett had slung his hair trunk on the rack, Mr. Filbert stepped gently into the stage-coach. ""Excuse me, Marm,"" he said to the woman. ""Did I step on your toes?""The little wiry man sank into the furthest corner and pulled out from his pocket a newspaper, which he tried to read. But Mrs. Beaseley, beginning on the statement of what she had suffered waiting for Mr. Tisbett, and every minute since the journey was begun, Mr. Filbert never got more than ten lines down the first page."
"At last, after picking up a little girl, and a boy who spent his time in thrusting out his head from the swinging vehicle to stare enviously up at Joel, the stage-coach rattled in fine fashion, bringing everybody to the doors and windows, into Strawberry Hill, and pulled up at the tavern. Here all the passengers got down; Mrs. Beaseley insisting that she ought to pay but half price, considering all things, and with very black looks, when Mr. Tisbett coolly waited till every cent was in his palm. The little thin man skipped nimbly out of the coach, and, with a backward alarmed look at her, hurried to get into a wagon waiting a little distance off, in which Mr. Tisbett deposited the hair trunk.""Say, how'd you get up there?"" asked the boy, tumbling out of the coach to stare up at Joel. The small girl, who was going to spend Sunday at her grandmother's, got out with dignity, carrying her best clothes in a bundle. She stopped a minute to hear what Joel said.""Now, says I, we'll hop down,"" cried Mr. Tisbett, which Joel proceeded to do in a trice, glad enough to stretch his legs. ""Here, David, give us your hand."" And the stage-driver soon had little David on the ground. ""Now, Bill and Jerry, it's your turn."" And very soon Mr. Tisbett was busy in unbuckling straps and tackling, to release the big horses, Joel in a wild delight getting dreadfully in the way, and being, as he thought, an immense help. Little David stood off and watched the proceeding, longing to help too, but too timid to say so. The other boy rushed up. ""Oh, let me help!"" he cried, thrusting a tousled head in between the two busy with the harness.The stage-driver shot him a keen look. ""It will be time enough for you to help in this ere job, Jim,"" he said, ""when I ask you."" So Jim slunk off, to stare at a distance again. And at last the horses were led off to the big barn to get their dinner of oats and hay, and then Mr. Tisbett drew Joel and David away.But this was a hard task, for Joel hung over Bill and Jerry in delight, watching every mouthful. ""Can't I climb up on his back and sit there while he eats?"" he begged, pointing at Bill, while even little David much preferred the old barn with its sweet odor, and the big haymows, to any other place.""No, you can't,"" said Mr. Tisbett, answering Joel. ""And you ain't a-goin' to be in this barn. I can't leave you here alone. Your Ma wouldn't like it. And besides, you've got to have somethin' to eat. I always get my dinner here. So come along; you're my company to-day, an' I told Mrs. Pepper not to put you up anything to eat."""
"Strangely enough, at the mention of dinner, Joel still clung to the hope of remaining with the horses. Seeing which, the stage-driver wasted no more words, but picked an end of his jacket in his fingers and bore him off. Once within the cosey little dining room, with the green paper shades flapping in the summer breeze, and seated at the table with the tavern-keeper's wife bustling around to lay on the hot dishes, Joel thought differently, and had a hard time to keep his tongue still. Little Davie watched everything silently, with wide-open blue eyes.""All right,"" said the tavern-keeper's wife, with a smile for the jolly stage-driver who always made it pleasant for them all when he took his dinner there once a week. ""Now, what's these boys goin' to have?""""As good a dinner as you've got in the house, Mrs. Green,"" said Mr. Tisbett, heartily; ""these are the little Pepperses, and they live over to Badgertown, Marm."" He said this with an air much as he might have announced, ""This is the Lord Mayor of London,"" if he had been called upon to introduce that functionary.""Yes sir-_ree_!"" cried Joel, smacking his lips; ""we don't have anything but potatoes and salt for our dinner. Oh, David!"" he seized little Davie's arm tightly, ""raspberry shortcake, she said; that's what Polly was telling about she hoped we could have sometime."" ""Now, then,"" exclaimed Mr. Tisbett, when dinner was over, and the little Peppers declared they couldn't eat any more, ""I'm a-goin' to set out on th' porch a minute or two. I allers let Bill an' Jerry rest a full hour,"" pulling out the big silver watch again.""Eh? Oh, so I have!"" cried Mr. Tisbett. ""Well, p'r'aps we'll let Joe have 'em both, then; that is, if he's a good boy. Well, can't either on you eat any more? What a pity, an' Mrs. Green has such good things.""The tavern-keeper's wife cried out that some way her raspb'ry shortcake wasn't quite so light as what she had day before yest'day. ""La, Mr. Tisbett!"" she exclaimed, smoothing her apron delightedly, ""if you'd only happened along then, 'twould 'a' melted in your mouth.""The little Peppers promising they would be as good as could be, Mr. Tisbett slouched off to the big arm-chair, where he always took his accustomed rest at Strawberry Hill while the horses were put up in the barn. Joel ran back to tell Mrs. Green, ""I like you,--I do; you make awful nice things,"" and David echoed the same, as they both scampered out of the house.""I declare, they're as pretty-behaved children's I ever see,"" confided the tavern-keeper's wife to the rest of the family who were at home, the tavern-keeper himself being away for the day. ""Poor things, although they were so hungry, an' they don't get much to eat at home, they didn't grab an' pick at things."" And she made up her mind to put up a little bundle of her sugar cookies for them to eat on the way back.""Well, we couldn't,"" said Joel, with a qualm of conscience because he hadn't thought of it before; ""Mamsie's told us it isn't nice to speak of taking things home. Hurry up, Dave,"" as they raced on. ""I know it,"" said little Davie. But he sighed, nevertheless."
"""I know it,"" said Joel, twitching away. ""I said peek, Dave. Mr. Tisbett didn't say not to do that."" So both boys got as far as they could on the threshold of the big sweet-smelling barn, without stepping over the sill, and craned their necks to get a sight of the two black horses.""Come here, Dave,"" called Joel, in glee, being careful not to go beyond the big post, ""you can see 'em just as good's can be. Bill's got his mouth full of hay, an' he's bobbing his head, and the wisps are tickling Jerry, an' he don't like it,"" and Joel laughed heartily.Joel said nothing as to this family history, but continued to gaze at the horses. David picked himself up from the barn floor, and hurrying out over the sill, began to dust his clothes, glad that Joel had not seen him tumble in.""You knocked him over!"" cried Joel, boiling with wrath, and, deserting the big post, he squared off toward the Strawberry Hill boy, and doubled up his little brown fists. ""Then you've got to fight me.""""You ain't a-goin' to lick me,"" cried Joel, sturdily, ""I'm goin' to lick you,"" while little David, sick with terror, screamed out that he wasn't hurt; that he didn't care if Jim did push him over, and for Joel to come back--come back! But Joel and Jim were already halfway to the cow-pasture, and Davie, wild with fright, stumbled over across the barnyard, and off to the house to find Mr. Tisbett.""He's just gone into th' house,"" said one of the farmers who always took this hour, on the occasion of the stage-driver's weekly visit, to come to the tavern porch and get the news. ""He'll be out in a minute or two. Sit down, sonny; you're dreadful hot.""But David wrung his hands, and rushed into the tavern. The dining room was dark and cool, all the dinner things being carried out, except the pickle dish and the sugar bowl; and the crumbs swept off from the table, and the green blinds pulled to. He could hear the rattle of the dish-washing and the clearing-up generally out in the kitchen, and he plunged in. ""Where--where's Mr. Tisbett?"" he cried, his breath most gone, from fright, and his little face aflame.""Goodness me, how you scart me!"" exclaimed the tavern-keeper's wife, who, with another woman, was flying around to get the work done up. ""Oh, it's one of the Pepper boys. What's the matter, dear?"" with a glance at David's hot face. ""What you ben a-runnin' so for?""""Joel."" It was all David could say, as he pointed off where he thought the cow-pasture was. ""Somethin's happened to that other boy. Didn't you say his name was--Joel?"" said the other woman, fastening very small but sharp eyes on David."
"""Mercy me! you don't think it!"" exclaimed the tavern-keeper's wife, her ruddy face taking a scared expression. ""Dear me! I must call Mr. Tisbett. Mr. Tisbett!"" she screamed, running, if the speed she now exercised could be called by that name, for it was more like waddling, out to the porch.""I don't know no more'n the dead where he is, child,"" said Mrs. Green, turning a perplexed face to David, after the old farmer had said the same thing over again. ""Mr. Tisbett's got the run o' the place, an' likely as not, he's stepped to one o' the neighbors,"" pointing to a small cluster of houses a quarter of a mile away.But the tavern-keeper's wife had her own reasons for believing differently. And without wasting her breath on words, except to ask David, ""Where?"" she flung her dish-towel, which she had been carrying in her hand, across her arm, and picking up her skirts, she made remarkably good time across the barnyard by a shorter cut, which she was familiar with, to the cow-pasture.Jim saw her coming first, and much as he disliked on ordinary occasions to see his ""a'nt,"" he now hailed her approach with secret delight, for the Badgertown boy was giving him all he could do to protect himself. So he now shouted out, ""My a'nt's comin'. Stop!""""I don't care,"" cried Joel, pommelling away. So Jim struck back as well as he could, longing to hear Mrs. Green scream out, ""Stop!"" which she did as soon as she had breath enough, and shaking her dish-towel at them. ""You wait there, Jim,"" she commanded, on top of her call, as she came panting on; and Jim, looking all ways for escape, saw there was no use in attempting it. When she did reach him, she seized him and shook him till his head seemed to wobble on his shoulders. Then, with a resounding box on the ear, that seemed like a clap of thunder, she paused to take breath.""Now you come along of me,"" said Mrs. Green. ""Goodness land alive! I'm all shook to pieces,"" and she started for the tavern. ""I'll wash your face,"" to Joel; ""then I guess you ain't hurt much,"" yet she regarded him anxiously.""But I don't want him to,"" declared Joel, loudly, not moving. ""He mustn't! Stop his father from whipping him! He shan't."" And before Mrs. Green could recover from her astonishment, he plunged her deeper yet, by bursting into tears."
"""And I shall just run and tell his father not to,"" blubbered Joel, realizing if Jim was to be saved from that awful whipping, he must be the one to do it. ""Where does he live?"" he cried, emerging from his tears at the chance of action.""Over there,"" answered the tavern-keeper's wife. ""Well, if I ever!"" pointing to a yellow house. She kept ejaculating this over and over, as she pursued her way to the house, thoughtfully swinging her dish-towel.Long before they reached it, they could hear squeals that were not pleasant to hear, and that made them quicken their pace, to run around the house-place, and plunge almost into the face of an untidy woman who hurried to the door.The squeals were now so much worse that Joel gave a plunge that carried him to the woodshed door, and little David, his heart in his mouth at thought of Jim's father, followed as best he could. Joel dashed in. ""Oh, do stop!"" he screamed.Jim's father turned; he had a big stick in his hand. When little David saw it he shuddered and sat down helplessly on the woodshed floor, in among all the clutter and dirt. Jim, with his knuckles twisted into his streaming eyes, whirled around from under the big hand grasping his collar. When he saw Joel, he screamed worse than ever. ""Don't let him kill me, Pa,"" he roared, huddling up to him.Joel sprang up to a tall, big-shouldered man with a bearded face. ""Oh, sir,"" he cried, ""please don't whip Jim any more--p'r'aps he didn't mean to push David over, I don't b'lieve. Don't whip him."" He put out his little brown hand, and boldly seized the stick.The big man grinned all over his bearded face. ""I don't see but what I've got to, you ask me so pretty,"" he said, showing nearly every tooth in his head. ""Well, Jim, you're let off for this time. I hadn't only just begun,"" he added to Joel, as he hung up the stick on a beam.""Joel Pepper,"" he answered, ""and this is my brother David. Say how do you do, Dave,"" he whispered, pulling his sleeve. But little Davie was too far gone in distress to speak, only to smile faintly. ""And we live over in Badgertown in a little brown house,"" continued Joel, feeling that he ought to make up for David's silence.Mr. Tisbett was standing on the porch, just starting for them, when the two boys ran up. And in front of him was the tavern-keeper's wife, telling the whole story as far as she knew it, the old farmer hitching forward his chair to catch every word. When the stage-driver saw them, he hemmed loudly, and made a sign for Mrs. Green to stop."
"Joel gave a skip of delight and released Davie's jacket. ""Oh, whickety--yes!"" he cried. Little David did not answer, but smiled his pleasure, and the tavern-keeper's wife went into the house to get her bundle of cookies ready.""I can't say that ye warn't naughty, Joel,"" said the stage-driver, slowly, ""'cause ye were. But I'm a-goin' to let ye in, and besides, I need ye to help me with them horses,"" and Mr. Tisbett began to look very worried at once.Joel sat very straight. ""Oh, I'll help you, Mr. Tisbett,"" he cried joyfully. And in a minute they were all three in the big stall, and Joel was in the very midst of things, and even David forgot his fright enough to lend a helping hand, and to feel his importance, and presently the big black horses were led out of the barn, and harnessed into the stage-coach.""Now, hop up!"" cried Mr. Tisbett, when he had gone carefully around and around the big coach, to see that every strap and buckle was in place, and had got down on his knees to be quite sure the springs were all right. Then he gave David a lift up to the box, Joel clambering up on the other side. ""We'll drive up to th' door,"" he said, ""an' get th' passenger,"" for there was one woman going over to Badgertown.But Mr. Tisbett sat down and gathered up the reins and drove round with such a flourish that it never had been surpassed, it seemed to the people on the tavern porch. And the one woman got in with her basket, and the tavern-keeper's wife ran down the steps and stood on her tiptoes and handed up to Joel the bundle of cookies, begging them to come again. And the old farmer said ""Good day,"" and the woman with little sharp eyes, who had been washing the dishes, hurried out, pulling down her sleeves, to see them off. And away they rattled, with faces turned toward home and Mamsie.They had proceeded about a quarter of a mile, when Mr. Tisbett suddenly asked, ""Want to drive, Joel? Come along over here,"" and he reached past David and took his hand. ""Now, then, I'm goin' to set in the middle a little spell,"" and before Joel could recover from his astonishment, he found the old leather reins in his brown hands. He was driving Mr. Tisbett's black horses! The delights of that day at Strawberry Hill never died out of remembrance, as Joel and David went over it constantly, so that the whole Pepper family soon felt that they had been of the company in the stage-coach along with Mr. Tisbett. Only when once the story was told of the trouble with Jim, as it was by David, Mrs. Pepper decided that that should never be referred to again. But her black eyes glowed when little David proudly related how Joel had stopped the beating that Jim's father was giving him, although the account was much delayed, Davie was in such a tremble.""Maybe,"" said Mrs. Pepper, not looking into the brown eyes, but keeping her own bent on her work; ""but I wouldn't think of it, Polly, if I were you. Things don't happen if you sit down and fold your hands and watch for 'em.""""Yes,"" said Polly, ""those were nice, children. Well, p'r'aps we'll get a really and truly chicken pie sometime. And if the old stove would behave, and not have these dreadful holes coming all the time, where the putty tumbles out, it would be perfectly splendid. Now,"" cried Polly, running up to the stove, and shaking her brown head at it, ""you've got to do your very best. If you don't, I'm sure I shall just give up!"""
"""It mustn't let the putty tumble out,"" said Phronsie. Then she ran up to the stove, and laid her little face up against its cold, black surface, for on summer afternoons there was never any fire in it. ""You mustn't be naughty, old stove,"" she said, ""for then Polly will cry.""""No, you'll only spread it more, for you don't know how, Polly,"" answered Mother Pepper. So Polly, feeling as if there were a great many things she must grow up and learn, hurried off with Phronsie into the bedroom.""Now you see, Polly,"" said Mrs. Pepper, putting aside her work and drawing Joel on her lap, ""what mischief a few words can do. There, there, Joel, don't cry,"" and she patted his black hair. ""Mother's glad to work for her children, and she gets rested when they're good."" But Joel sobbed on, and she had to repeat it many times before he would wipe his tears, and be comforted. Little Davie drew near silently, to hear what she said.""Oh, Mamsie!"" cried Polly, running over to her, to get within the good arms, though she couldn't sit on her lap, of course, as there were three little Peppers there already; ""I'm sorry I spoke, but I didn't think.""""Didn't think makes most all of the trouble in this world,"" said Mrs. Pepper, gravely; ""so see to it that next time you don't have to make that excuse, Polly child,"" and she dropped a kiss on Polly's red cheek.""It's just this way, children,"" she went on, smiling on all the bunch; ""Mother is really glad to work, and every stitch she puts in, she keeps thinking, now that's for Ben and Polly and Joel and David and Phronsie."" Mother Pepper's black eyes went lovingly around on all the faces so near her own. ""And I keep looking ahead, too, to the time when the little brown house people are going out into the world and--""""Forever'n ever,"" echoed Phronsie, folding her hands tightly together; while the two boys vociferously protested that nothing should ever drive them out of the little brown house. ""No, not even to live over in Strawberry Hill with nice Mrs. Green.""""Well, anyway, we must all live and grow up so that the little brown house won't be ashamed of us,"" said Mrs. Pepper, ""and that's what Mother is working for; so don't let me hear any more crying about it. Now remember, all of you."" With that she opened her arms wide again. ""Now scamper off,"" she said, with a bright smile, and she picked up her sewing and sent her needle cheerily in and out once more.That evening, after the supper things were all cleared away, Joel began by drawing Davie off in a corner to whisper mysteriously. ""Let him alone, Polly,"" said Ben, in a low voice. ""Joe'll tell of his own accord, pretty soon.""And sure enough, it wasn't ten minutes. Mother Pepper had gone into the bedroom to tuck Phronsie away for the night, when Joel said triumphantly, ""We know something, Dave and me, and we won't tell what 'tis.""""I wish you would, Bensie,"" said Polly, well pleased, for Polly dearly loved everything kept mended up, and ""shipshape,"" as Mrs. Pepper used to say. ""I'll spread the paper down so you don't get any mess on the floor."" So she ran to the pile of old weekly newspapers her mother always saved, when any of the Badgertown people sent her a copy, as they did once in a while, and flapping one open, she soon had a ""paper carpet,"" as she said merrily, on the floor. And Ben, coming out from the woodshed, with the washboard in his hand, together with the hammer and nails, the kitchen began to hum with the noise."
"""Go on, Joel,"" said Polly, with a cold shoulder for Ben. ""Now I know your circus is going to be perfectly elegant,"" she cried enthusiastically, running over to their corner. ""Do tell us about it, Joel.""Joel, vastly complimented that Polly took such an interest in his plan, now began lustily to set it forth, and little Davie piped in whenever there was a chance for a word, which wasn't often. And finally Ben said, ""I guess I'll move my washboard and the 'paper carpet' up there with you all,"" and Polly said, ""Oh, do, Ben.""And presently they were all so very jolly, Ben deciding not to say anything more of Polly's rhododendron, that none of them knew when Mother Pepper said above their heads, ""I thought you didn't know 'twas five minutes past your bedtime, Joel and David,"" pointing to the clock. Joel practised the part of so many animals in the next week that the little brown house people became quite accustomed to any strange grunting or roaring they might chance to hear, as if a whole menagerie were let loose. Only Mamsie forbade that such noise should be allowed within doors. And every once in a while Joel would rush into the kitchen, with ""Polly, how does an elephant scream?"" and ""Tell me, Polly, does a kangaroo cry this way?"" until Polly was quite worn out.""Hush!"" warned Polly, looking around to see if Phronsie heard. Luckily, she was in the bedroom, sitting down by the lower bureau drawer, which was open, and trying on her red-topped shoes, getting every button into the wrong button-hole. ""Oh, Ben,"" Polly rushed up to whisper in his ear, ""I do think that was too dreadful for anything.""And Ben sighed too. Because, as he had been working at Deacon Blodgett's pretty steadily the last few weeks since the fire, he had noticed how the neighbors and friends had been sending in things to show how sorry they were for the Blodgett family, and it grieved him dreadfully that the Peppers seemed to be about the only ones left out. So now he preserved a gloomy silence.""Well, come, dear me,"" cried Polly, when she saw this, and, remembering her mother's advice, to think first before she spoke the words that might work mischief, she brightened up. ""P'r'aps some chance will come to us to show dear Mrs. Blodgett that we are sorry for 'em, if we can't send 'em things.""""Whom are you going to invite to see your circus, Joel?"" asked Polly, a few nights later, when, as usual, after supper, Joel was haranguing loudly on the great show to take place, and even little David was wound up to such a pitch of enthusiasm that Mrs. Pepper, on seeing his red cheeks, felt a dozen times inclined to send him to bed ahead of the time. But his happy little face appealed to her strongly, and she argued to herself, ""I don't know but what 'twould hurt him quite as much to disappoint him, as to let him sit up half an hour longer. Thank fortune, it's seven o'clock now!"" So David was saved being sent off to bed, until it was time for Joel to go too.""O dear me!"" cried Polly, whispering back, ""we never have anything! It's perfectly dreadful, Ben; and we must help Joe. And you know yourself there aren't any pins hardly in the house, and Mamsie couldn't give us one of those.""Polly put her head into her two hands, while Joel was vociferating, ""Oh, tickets! Goody! Polly's going to make 'em! Polly's going to make 'em!"" in a way to fill her with dismay, while she racked her brains to think what would satisfy Joel as entrance money to his circus."
"""Now, children,"" she said briskly, lifting her head, her hands falling to her lap, ""Ben says we can't manage the tickets very well, because we haven't any paper."" She hurried on, ""Be still, Joe!"" as she saw signs of a howl. ""But I'll tell you something else you might have, Joel, and we've got plenty of 'em, and they're round, and oh, so nice!"" By this time her voice had such a confident ring, and she laughed so gayly, that little Davie cried out, ""I know it's nice, Polly,"" and even Joel looked enthusiastic.""It's cheeses,"" said Polly; ""don't you know, Joe, out in the yard?"" They were the little, round, green things, so called by the children, that grew on a little plant in the grass, and they used to pick and eat them.""You may come in for ten, then,"" said Joel, coming down with a long jump, very much alarmed lest Ben should not be able to get in. And as for having the circus without him--why, that would be dreadful!So Davie got up from the ring on the floor, and ran over to his mother, and climbed in her lap. ""I don't see what 'tis,"" she said, looking him over keenly. Then she made him open his mouth, and she got a spoon and looked down his throat. ""It isn't red,"" she declared, ""and I don't believe it's sore.""""I don't want you to,"" said Polly, still with a cold little manner, ""unless you want to go yourself, Joel. But I should think you would want to, when you think of poor little Davie going up there alone. You know you don't like to do it, and you're such a big boy.""But the next morning David didn't seem to be bright and wide awake as a cricket, and although there was nothing the matter with him, except he still had his red cheeks and complained when any one asked him if he felt sick, that he was tired, that that was all, Mother Pepper kept him in bed. And that night he came down to sleep in Mamsie's big bed, and Polly had a little shake-down on the floor.""Now, Joel,"" said Mrs. Pepper, the morning after that, ""I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you can't have your circus awhile yet, till Davie gets real strong. So you must rest your animals,"" she said with a smile, ""and they'll be all the better when the right time comes.""Joel, swallowing his disappointment as best he could, went out and sat on the back steps to think about it. He sat so very still, that Polly ran out after a while to look at him. ""Oh, Joe, you aren't crying!"" she said in dismay.""No,"" said Joe, lifting his head; ""but, Polly, I'm afraid my animals will all run away if I don't have the circus pretty soon. Don't you s'pose Mamsie'll let me have it in the bedroom Dave could sit up in the bed and see it.""""Dear me, no,"" cried Polly. ""The very idea!"" Whenever Polly said, ""The very idea!"" the children knew it was perfectly useless to urge anything. So now Joel sank back on the doorstep and resigned himself to despair."
"""I tell you what I'd do if I were you, Joey,"" said Polly, kindly, and running down to sit beside him. ""I'd think up all sorts of different things, and get all ready, every speck. There's really a great deal to do. And then I'd pick cheeses all the spare time I had. Oh, I'd pick lots and lots!"" Polly swept out her arms as if enclosing untold numbers. ""And--""""I know it,"" said Polly; ""but if you pick a good many cheeses, you can give away some tickets, you know--comple--comple--well, I don't just know what they call 'em. But they let folks in without paying.""""It's just this way, Joel,"" said Polly, trying to explain. ""Folks that give a show always send some tickets to their friends, so they don't have to pay. I should think you'd want to; why, just think,"" she jumped off from the step and stood before him in great excitement, ""I never thought of it before,"" and the color rose high on her cheek. ""You can ask dear Mrs. Beebe, and Mr. Beebe, and--"" ""You tell Joel,"" said Mrs. Beebe, standing in the doorway of the little shop, ""that I've got some animals I'm goin' to send down to his circus this afternoon, if so be I can't come myself and bring 'em.""""Whatever can they be?"" she cried to herself, racing home on the wings of the wind. ""Dear me, won't Joe have the most splendid time! and dear little Davie, it's good he's rested and well,"" and Polly's mind was flying as busily as her feet, as she set all her wits to work to think up everything that could possibly be achieved to help out the great event.""No--no,"" cried Joel, quite gone in distress, and twisting his chubby fingers to keep from crying; ""and Mrs. Brown doesn't know either. She says that cat never ran away before in all her life, and I'd just got her tamed to carry Seraphina. O dear, dear!""""Well now, Joel,"" said Polly, ""I wouldn't care, if I were you; and oh,"" she cried suddenly, with delight at the comfort she could give him, ""Mrs. Beebe says she's going to send you some animals, if she can't come and bring 'em herself. Think of that, Joe!""""Oh--oh!"" screamed Joel, in an ecstasy. ""Now I don't care if that old cat has run away. She bit me awfully yesterday,"" and he held up his thumb; ""and she's a mean old thing, and she wasn't a very good tiger, anyway.""""No, indeed, not unless they want to,"" said Polly. ""But why don't you be the kangaroo, then, Joe, and let Davie be something else? Give him the snake, then he won't have to jump, and it's easier to wriggle."""
"""Well, something else that's as easy as the snake, then,"" said Polly, laughing. ""You mustn't tire him all out, Joel, for then Mamsie will have to stop the circus, and _that_ would be perfectly dreadful, you know.""This made Joel decide at once that he would change his animals round a bit; so he said, ""I'll be the kangaroo myself, Dave. See here,"" and he executed such a remarkable series of leaps and hops, and long and short steps, that his audience of two were quite overcome with admiration.""No,"" said Joel, coming up bright and shining, as he finished his last hop, ""you couldn't, Davie. Now you must take some of the others then, if you aren't to be the kangaroo."" And he threw himself on the grass at Polly's feet, as she and David now sat on the step.""Well, this is going to have a menag--menag--"" said Polly, who sometimes found it hard to manage all the big words she wanted to use. ""Anyway, what Ben called it the other night. He heard 'em talking of it at the Blodgetts'.""""And then when you've got through showing him off, David must sing a little song to show he is a bird. This way,"" and Polly threw back her head and twittered twee-dee-ed, and chee-chee-ed, and trilled in a way she had, till the boys looked up in the branches of the old scraggy apple tree to see if there really was any little bird there.""Dear me, Joe!"" exclaimed Polly, in consternation. Yet she felt quite flattered. ""We haven't any table out here, except the stone one,"" glancing at it, ""and my fingers won't make any noise on that. So I don't see how we can have the band."" Polly always made her fingers fly up and down on the kitchen table while she sang, pretending it was a piano and she was a great musician, for it was the dearest wish of her heart to learn to play on a piano.""Ben can get us a board, I know,"" cried Joel, confidently; so he ran off to find him in the woodshed, for Ben was home to-day, chopping wood. And pretty soon Joel came running back, proclaiming that Ben had said yes, if Polly would play, that the board should be all ready.""But I can put on Ben's coat, and you can tell 'em I'm Mr. Tisbett, same's you introduce all the animals,"" persuasively said Polly, feeling as if nothing could be quite as nice as to be Mr. Tisbett and manage those black horses.""Yes, indeed,"" said Polly, who had a terrible time in making them, Joel being the most critical of individuals, ""as safe as can be, in the bedroom cupboard;"" and she ran off to get them, but not so fast as Joel, who rushed eagerly past her.""Take care, Joe, you mustn't get 'em,"" warned Polly, dashing into the bedroom at his heels. But too late! Joel's hands were on the paper rings, and he clutched them so tightly that, lo and behold, one little brown fist went clear through one of them, to come out on the other side!""Well, it's your own fault!"" Polly was just going to say, knowing that she would have to make a new one, and where should she get the paper! Then her brow cleared, and she gave a sunny smile. ""Never mind, Joey!"" she cried. ""There, p'r'aps it isn't much hurt,"" and she took the broken one, and began to smooth it out."
"""Um!--"" said Polly, busily considering. Then she sat down and rested her elbows on her knees, first setting up the poor bursted ring against the bureau; and, with her chin in her hands, looked at it steadily. ""I tell you, Joel, what we'll do,"" at last she cried; ""those edges where it is torn can be pasted together, and--""""But it'll be a hole!"" shouted Joel, who had stopped crying while Polly was thinking, knowing that she would get over the trouble some way. Now he cried worse than ever. ""There wasn't goin' to be any hole, till I made one. O dear me!"" and he flung himself flat on the floor, to cry as if his heart would break.""Joe, Joe,"" cried Polly, running over to him to shake his arm, ""you must stop crying this very minute. If you don't, I shall not do anything for your circus. I won't be one of the animals, nor I won't play any music, nor anything.""""Well, now, you must stop at once,"" said Polly, firmly, seeing the advantage she had gained. ""So sit up, Joe, that's a good boy,"" as he very unwillingly brought himself up. ""Now, then, I'll tell you what I'm going to do,"" and Polly seized the poor ring, and, tossing back her brown hair, began to pat and to pull the crooked edges together.""Oh, now that's goin' to be better than the other one,"" declared Joel, in huge delight, his round face wreathed in smiles. ""And I'm going to break and smash the other one,"" and he doubled up his brown fist and dashed toward it.""No, you won't, Joe,"" cried Polly, in alarm. ""I've only red paper enough to go on the broken one, so if anything happens to the other one, deary me! I don't know whatever in the world we could do. Now run and get the cup of paste in the woodshed, and in the shake of a lobster's whisker I'll have it all done,"" sang Polly, gayly.""Oh, yes, they do,"" contradicted Polly; ""those long thin things that stick out under their eyes. But never mind, anyway, and don't talk about them, for I've got to put all my mind on this dreadful ring.""""Polly, I wish I'd had a lobster in my circus,"" said Joel, after a minute's panic, in which Polly pinched and snipped and pasted and trimmed with red paper all around the hole, till any one looking on would have said this was going to be the most splendid circus ring in the whole world.""Oh, Polly!"" screamed Joel, his black eyes sparkling with delight, ""that's perfectly splendid! and I'll come right smash through that red ring. Yes, sir-_ree!_"" and he danced around the bedroom, bumping into every object, as he was stretching his neck to look at the ring Polly was whirling so merrily.""Well, now that's done,"" said Polly, with a sigh of relief; ""and I'm thankful, Joey Pepper. Yes, it does look nice, doesn't it?"" and she surveyed the red border with pride. ""Wasn't it good that Mamsie gave me those strips of paper? Whatever should we have done without them! Well, now, says I, you've got to hurry to get all ready. Three o'clock comes pretty soon after dinner, and there's ever and ever so much yet to do before you can have your circus, Joey Pepper."""
"Joel dropped the wooden box that was to be the tiger's den, if Deacon Brown's cat should come back, and ran on the wings of the wind to the big green wagon standing out in the road. His black eyes roved anxiously over all the various things with which good Mrs. Beebe had loaded the vehicle, as she had many errands on her mind, and his heart beat fast at the sight of two or three boxes that stuck up above the rest, and an old canvas bag on top of them.""Dear me, child,"" exclaimed Mrs. Beebe, grasping the old leather reins in one hand, while she leaned back over the seat, ""there they be,"" pointing to a paper bag laid nicely in between the two boxes, so it couldn't fall out.""Yes, an' I guess you'll like 'em."" Mrs. Beebe nodded and winked at him, and smiled all over her round face. ""Now you take 'em and git out, that's a good boy, an' be quick, 'cause I've got some more arrants to do, an' I'm a-goin' to try to come to your show, Joel, seein' you've invited me so pretty."" And with another bob of her big bonnet she twitched the reins smartly, and the old horse fell into a jog-trot, while Joel did as he was bidden, and with his paper bag in his hand, sat down on the grass, trying very hard not to cry.Joel clutched his bag and stared gloomily. It didn't matter what it held; Mrs. Beebe had said ""animals,"" and to find that she hadn't spoken the truth, made him feel so dreadfully that he longed to scream out after her, and tell her he didn't like her any more. He wouldn't ever like anybody who told a lie; and Mamsie wouldn't ever let him go to see her, and Polly's brown eyes would fill with scorn. Oh, he could feel just exactly how Polly would look, and he shivered.""No--that is, I guess so,"" answered Joel, dragging out a whole handful of sugar cooky animals, and spinning them on the grass in various directions. ""I guess there's a snake there. She _said_ animals, and they _are_ animals, Dave,"" and a smile broke all over his chubby face.David took one look at the sugar cooky animals flying over his head. ""Oh, Joe, and they've got currant eyes!"" he screamed, and clapped his hands. ""See, there's a el'phant! Oh, and a goose, and a monkey!"" with a dive at the last.""Um!"" Suddenly Joel took it out of David's little palm, and popped one end of it into his mouth. ""Oh, goody!"" was all he said. ""Have some, Dave?"" and he shook the bag with the rest of its contents at him. But David was sprawling over the grass, picking up the scattered ones. Suddenly he stopped, with one halfway to his mouth. ""Don't you s'pose Mrs. Beebe wants you to keep 'em for the circus, and give the folks some of them?""""An' we'll pick up those on the grass,"" said Joel, suiting the action to the word, ""an' save the rest for th' folks."" And he soon had the remainder safe in the bag, when both the boys rushed into the house to display Mrs. Beebe's gift."
"After this, it was all commotion; so much so that Mrs. Pepper said she didn't know as she should ever let another circus come into the orchard. But her black eyes twinkled, and she patted Joel's head when she said it, and the anxious look ran away from Joel's face; and then the dinner of potatoes and brown bread was soon finished, and Polly somehow or other got the dishes all washed up, and the kitchen as clean as a new pin, ever so much quicker than on other days, and pretty soon Joel and all his animals and the musician were out in the orchard in a perfectly dreadful state of hurry and confusion.But at last the show was in full progress; on the seats of honor were Mother Pepper and Mrs. Beebe, who got in at the last minute, just before they were to begin. And Grandma Bascom, who was delighted to be able to hear for once, as she now could, all the roars of the various animals, while Sally Brown and the Henderson boys made up the rest of the audience. And everybody clapped their hands, and said, ""Oh, isn't that good!"" and, ""I think that is fine!"" And Grandma said, ""La me!"" and lifted her black mitts, which she had put on to do honor to the occasion, ""and who would have thought it!"" And Sally Brown and the Henderson boys stared with envy, and wished they were some of the animals and having such a good time. And Peletiah solemnly determined within himself to get up a circus the very next week. And the excited animals thrilled with delight when it came the monkey's time to perform and jump through the big paper rings.Joel bobbed out from behind the bushes, and told the audience what was coming; then he bobbed in again, and Polly and Ben got him into the monkey skin,--an old brown flannel petticoat that Grandma Bascom had given the children to play with, ""'Cause it's so et up with moths, 'tain't fit to set a needle into to fix up,"" as she said. And Ben made a long, flapping tail out of an old, frayed rope, and Polly had sewed a little tuft of hair, that came out of Mamsie's cushion, on top of the monkey's head, pulling it all around the face for some whiskers; so, when Joel was really inside of it, he was perfectly awful. Particularly as he showed all his teeth, and rolled and blinked his black eyes every minute, so that Phronsie, who sat on the grass at Mamsie's feet, when she wasn't an animal and needed to perform, shivered, and clung close to Mrs. Pepper.So Phronsie sat up very straight in Mrs. Pepper's lap, and the wonderful act began, Polly being the musician, and singing her merriest, while she drummed with her fingers on the board that Ben had fixed across the stone table, running up and down with so many little quirks and quavers it was really very remarkable to hear.""Go on,"" commanded Ben, ""or I won't hold it at all,"" and Polly bobbed her head at him as she drummed away. ""Hurry up,"" she seemed to say. So Joel sprang off from the lower branch of the apple tree and went zip-tear-bang, at the paper ring. But instead of going through, he knocked it out of Ben's hand, and went with it, rolling over and over on the ground. When he got up to his feet, the big paper ring was all in tags, and the hair on the monkey's head was all over his eyes, and covering his red face.So Joel took a flying leap, keeping his black eyes fixed on the red border, and came through the ring so splendidly that everybody hopped up to their feet, and shouted and clapped their hands, Grandma exclaiming, ""La--for the land's sake!"" while Phronsie slid out of Mrs. Pepper's lap and gave a squeal of delight.""Hoh! that's nothing!"" declared Joel, and before Ben could say anything he ran and jumped up on the lower limb of the apple tree, and winding his sturdy legs around the trunk, and then springing from one branch to another, there he was, before any one knew it, on the topmost bough!""O mercy me--he'll be killed!"" screamed Grandma, who saw it first. Mother Pepper turned swiftly. ""Joel!"" she was going to exclaim. But in a minute she knew it would be the worst thing in the world to do. So she tried to smile and to say, ""Come down, Joey, and be careful."""
"Polly's face turned very white. ""Oh, Ben, he'll be killed!"" she exclaimed. ""He won't look at us, and we can't make him hear,"" for by that time everybody was shouting at him to come down, and Phronsie was crying as if her heart would break.""I'm goin' to hang by my tail,"" screamed Joel at them, and before any of them could realize what he was doing, he had swung the long rope over a branch and twisted it up in a knot, then he swung himself out, and let his feet free from the bough.Mrs. Pepper seized Ben's arm and said hoarsely, ""Go up after him."" Ben was halfway up the trunk as fast as he could go, which wasn't very good speed, as he was always slower at such things than the other little Peppers. When Joel, head downward, saw him coming up, he screamed, ""Ha! I'm a monkey, and you can't catch me,"" and he swung farther out than ever. The knot he had thought so safe untwisted, and down, down, he went, the long rope curling through the air to wind around his legs.It was all done in one dreadful moment, and when they ran to pick him up, everything seemed to turn black around Polly's eyes. She never knew how it happened, but there was Mother Pepper sitting on the grass with Joel's head in her lap, and Mrs. Beebe hurrying into the kitchen for water and cloths to wash the blood away, and Grandma waddling down the lane to get things from the cottage. And Ben sliding down the tree, the rest of the little Peppers crouching up in misery around Mamsie and her boy.Polly's white lips only formed the words, ""Dr. Fisher--I'll go--you stay here and help Mamsie,"" and she was off in a flash. For Polly could run the swiftest of any of them, her feet hardly touching the ground.Somebody called her name as she spun along the dusty ground, but she didn't stop--only sped on. But by laying the whip smartly over the back of his horse, the man in the wagon came up by her side and yelled at her, and then she saw that it was Mr. Tisbett.""Now you just git in here,"" commanded Mr. Tisbett, getting down to the ground; and without waiting for Polly to obey, he picked her up and set her on the seat. ""I take it you're goin' after th' doctor. Now he ain't to home, for this is his day for Hillsbury, ye know. But I tell you,"" he added briskly, as he saw Polly's face, ""I'm a master hand at doctorin', an' I'm goin' to take a look at Joel."" All this time he was getting over the wheel and into his seat, and turning down the road toward the little brown house.""Yes, yes,"" said Mr. Tisbett, obligingly, and applying the whip again to the horse's flanks. ""Now it's lucky enough my stage-coach got a mite broke this morning, an' I had to wait over a trip, and so I've met you. We'll soon be there, Polly, don't you worry a mossel. I fell out o' apple trees time after time when I was a boy, and it hain't hurt me none. Git ap, Bill! An' at any rate, I'll fix Joel up. I used to be a doctor 'fore I was a stage-driver. Ye hain't never known that, hev ye, Polly?"" and he smiled down on her."
"""Fact,"" said Mr. Tisbett, rolling the tobacco quid into his other cheek. ""I was what ye might call a nat'ral doctor, bone-setter, and all that; never took a diplomy--but land sakes alive, I donno's it's necessary, when ye got to make a bone into shape, to set an' pint to a piece o' paper to tell where ye was eddicated. Git up an' set th' bone, I say, an' if ye can do it all right, I guess it's a good enough job to the feller what owns the bone. Git ap, Bill!"" and they drew up in front of the little brown house.Mr. Tisbett never waited to ask questions, although Mrs. Pepper looked at him inquiringly, but just took hold of the job he had come to do, and Polly explained to Mamsie. And presently everybody was obeying the stage-driver just as soon as he spoke a word. And his big hands were just as gentle and light, and his fingers, that always seemed so clumsy holding the old leather reins, were a great deal softer in their touch than Mother Pepper's own, as they wandered all over Joel's body. Mr. Tisbett was right. And before he left, Joel was sitting on his knee, and hearing various accounts of Black Bill; how he ran away once when he was a colt, and Mr. Tisbett never caught him till he'd chased him over into Hillsbury; and how once, when the pole broke going down a hill, Black Bill had held Jerry from kicking and plunging loose, and brought 'em all down in safety to the bottom.""I tell you, sir,"" declared Mr. Tisbett, bringing his big fist down on his knee, ""that's a horse for you, ef ever there was one. And you shall go along of me sometime, Joe, and have a ride in th' stage-coach again, if your Ma'll let you.""""Take my advice,"" said the stage-driver, ""an don't try to get two horses exactly alike, 'cause you're bound to be disappointed. Now there's Jerry; ain't a mite like Black Bill, but he's awful good to run along with him.""""Then I shall have one like Jerry, instead,"" decided Joel, folding his hands in great satisfaction, since Mr. Tisbett advised it so. ""Now I'm going to finish my circus, and be monkey."" And he began to get down from the stage-driver's knee.""You hold on there,"" said Mr. Tisbett, firmly; ""you've been monkey long enough, and scart your Ma and all on us nigh almost to death. Don't you go up that tree again, Joel Pepper! If you do, I won't take you on no more stage rides with me. You hear me, now.""Yes, Joel did hear, so although he whimpered and teased, and declared he hadn't played monkey more than a half a minute, and he'd lost most all his circus, Mr. Tisbett sat up stiff and straight, holding him tightly, and said, ""If I hear of you goin' up that ere tree again, you don't go with me."" So Joel promised he would be very good, and then he hopped down and got into Mamsie's lap, and let himself be cuddled to his heart's content.""My land!"" exploded Mrs. Beebe, when quiet was restored. ""I declare, I'm all beat out. You could knock me down with a feather,"" she confided to Polly. ""Well, well, well, that boy's saved for something. Now, Joel, why don't you have the animals now? Did you like 'em?"" and she settled her glasses to get a good look at him, and assure herself that he was really uninjured. ""It's a miracle,"" she kept saying to Grandma, who bobbed her cap all the while, as if she heard every word."
"""So you shall have 'em, Joel,"" cried Polly, glad to think there was something she could do, and she ran and brought the little sugar cooky animals where she had fixed them in some large leaves ready for Joel to pass them around among the company at the close of the performance.""Joel,"" said Polly, quickly, ""Mrs. Beebe hasn't any animal. Why don't you give her a--let me see,"" and she considered deeply. ""I'd give her a bird, Joel, here's a lovely one,"" and she pounced on a most remarkable specimen in the bird line one would wish to see. ""Mrs. Beebe, wouldn't you like that?"" she asked.""Yes, indeed I had. I always set dreadfully by birds,"" said Mrs. Beebe. So Joel gave her the bird, then he leaned over and picked out a horse, very much baked on one side, and with one leg shorter than the other ""That's for you, Mr. Tisbett,"" he said.""That suits me,"" said Mr. Tisbett, heartily. ""Well, now I never! Seems to me I can't eat it, 'twould be almost like chewing up a critter, but I'll keep it to remember you by,"" and he slipped it into his big pocket. Then he got up and shook himself. ""And now I must be a-goin'. Don't you be a mite worried, Mrs. Pepper, take my advice; that boy'll scare you more times than you can count. So you might as well get used to it. Now look sharp, Joe, and remember what you promised.""""Hush, Joey,"" said Polly, and her face turned rosy red, remembering Mrs. Beebe. But old Mrs. Beebe only laughed, and said she knew the pig wasn't baked good, he would whirl over on one side in the pan. And sometime she would bake Joel a good nice one. But Phronsie kept on pleading for this particular pig. ""Do, Joel, please,"" she begged, ""give me the dear, sweet piggie."" So Joel put it in her hand, when she cuddled it lovingly up against her fat little neck, not thinking of such a thing as eating it.And then David must pick out the one he wanted, and then Ben. And then all over again, around and around, till there wasn't another cooky animal left. And when he saw that, Joel hopped down from Mamsie's lap and marched up to Mrs. Beebe. ""Your animals were better'n mine,"" he said.""They don't tumble out of trees,"" said Mrs. Beebe, laughing. And then everybody got very merry, and Polly said, Could they play a game? and Mrs. Pepper looked at Joel hopping about, and she said, Yes, with a glad thrill that her boy was safe. ""It will help him to forget his accident,"" she said to Polly. So after all, the circus wound up with a fine ending."
"And in the midst of it Mrs. Brown came panting over, having run nearly every step of the way. When she saw Joel spinning around in The Barberry Bush, she leaned against the side of the little brown house, and said, ""O my!""Mrs. Pepper hurried over to her. ""Sally ran home and said Joel had tumbled from a tree, so I brought these over as soon's I could,"" panted Mrs. Brown, opening her apron, and there were ever so many bottles of medicine.And she hadn't been gone but a moment or two, carrying her apron full of medicines with her, before Mrs. Henderson came hurrying along down the dusty road. Her face was flushed, and she looked anxious enough. Mrs. Pepper said, ""Run, Polly, and meet her, and tell her Joel is all right. Bless her! She is a parson's wife!""""Thank you, Polly,"" said Mrs. Henderson, smiling down into the flushed face. ""And I am so glad to know it, for Peletiah came home very frightened. Well, take your mother this. Stay, I better go and see her, I guess."" So she went up to the little group back in the orchard, and heard all about Joel's accident from himself, as he wanted to tell it all, up to the time when they picked him up.""Ben can't go, of course,"" said Mrs. Pepper, ""and Polly can't, either,"" and her face grew sober, ""for Mr. Atkins says I may get some more coats to-morrow morning, and she's getting so she helps me a good deal.""So the next afternoon Joel, with many injunctions to be good, escorted the other two children to Parson Henderson's, Mrs. Pepper and Polly watching them from the door stone as they trudged off down the road, Phronsie clinging to Joel's hand, and David on the other side.""She's a parson's wife, now!"" said Mrs. Pepper for the fiftieth time, as the children turned the bend in the road, and wiping her eyes she went back into the house to pick up her sewing and go to work. ""Well, Polly, you and I will have a fine time to fly at this now.""""Polly,"" said Mother Pepper, suddenly, and she laid down her work a moment, although time was precious enough, ""Mother's sorry you couldn't go, too. But a nice time will come for you sometime, I hope,"" though she sighed.""But I can't help minding, Polly,"" said Mrs. Pepper, sadly, ""when I think how few nice times you have. But I'll try all the harder."" And she picked up her work again, and made the needle fly faster than ever.""And it's so very nice that Joel can go and see those new chickens,"" said Polly, suppressing a sigh, ""after he fell yesterday, and Phronsie, oh, you can't think, Mamsie! how she runs on about the chickens she saw there once.""Meantime Joel was in a state of supreme delight. Kneeling down in front of the coop, with his face pressed close to the bars, he was watching every movement of the fluffy little things, counting them over and over, and speculating what he would do if they were his, Phronsie crouching down by one side, while David was as close on the other, and all three children speechless with delight.Phronsie didn't hear him, her whole attention being absorbed by the wonderful chickens. So Joel cautiously pulled up one slat of the coop a very little way. ""There, you see,"" he cried in exultation, ""I can do it just as easy as not;"" when a bee, humming its way along, stung him smartly on the arm, and Joel twitched so suddenly that up went the slat quite high, and before he could stop them, out walked the old mother hen, and two of her children."
"""Oh, Joe, Joe! they're out!"" screamed David. Phronsie rolled over on the grass in a little ball, as Joel knocked against her, and nobody thought for a moment of shutting the bar down. So three more chickens stepped out and hopped away over the grass.""I can't,"" mourned Davie, tugging bravely at it. So Joel stopped chasing the hen and the chickens, and rushed up to slam down the bar, and two more chickens having hopped out in the meantime, there they were--seven downy little balls, hurrying about in a great state of excitement to reach mother, who was clucking noisily for them to hurry and come under her wing.""Oh, Joe! see what you've done,"" cried Davie, in distress, trying to help in every direction, but only succeeding in getting in the way. ""O dear me! You can't ever get 'em back in the coop, in all this world."" Phronsie, meanwhile, picked herself up, and eagerly entered into the chase, gurgling in delight as she pattered first after one little fluffy ball, and then another.But after about five minutes of this sort of work, Joel found that he couldn't do it very well, for as fast as he got one chicken headed for David, the others all scattered in every direction, while Mistress Biddy scampered and waddled and clacked to her children, till the parsonage garden seemed full of hens and chickens. At last Joel stopped and wiped his hot face, David looking at him from a distance in despair.""You stay there, Dave, I'm going to tell 'em,"" and Joel marched off with an awful feeling at his heart. But he didn't dare to stop to think about it, but mounted the steps of the parsonage and went down the wide hall. There was nobody to be seen, and Joel was just going to run out to the kitchen, if, perhaps, Mrs. Henderson could be found there. Suddenly the study door opened, and there stood the minister himself in the doorway.""Yes, sir,"" said Joel, twisting his brown hands together tightly. If he should cry now, before his story was told, maybe the minister would never get those chickens into the coop. He must make him understand. ""They're all running everywhere in the grass,"" he added miserably.""Do you mean Mrs. Henderson's new chickens?"" asked the minister, starting a bit. Then he added composedly, ""Oh, no, Joel, they're quite safe. She is very particular about looking after the coop herself.""""Mehitable's chickens are out!"" screamed Miss Jerusha, now appearing at the top of the stairs. She was in a short gown and petticoat, and had been doing up her hair, having just taken the ends of the side wisps out of her mouth, where she had conveyed them for the easier combing of the back locks.""See here,"" Parson Henderson stopped a minute, ""if you're going to help me, Joel, you can't cry, that's very certain. Why, I expect you and I will have every one of those chickens safe and sound in that coop in--well, in next to no time."""
"""Softly--softly there, Joel, my boy,"" said the minister. ""If we're going to get those chickens into that coop, we mustn't scare them to begin with. Now, you run into the barn, and get a little corn in the quart measure.""""That's well,"" said Parson Henderson, approvingly. ""Now then, the first thing to do is to make the mother go back into the coop. Here, Mrs. Biddy, take a bit of this nice corn."" He flung out a kernel or two to the hen, whose feathers that had started up in a ruffle and fluff, at sight of Joel, now drooped, and her excited clacking stopped.All this time, Phronsie and David, at sight of Parson Henderson's approach, had stood as if frozen to the ground, never taking their eyes from his face, except to look at Joel. The parson then went along a few steps nearer to the coop, scattering one or two kernels as he went. Mistress Biddy eyed them all wistfully. ""Come on,"" said the minister, gently.""Cluck--cluck,"" said the mother hen, sociably, and she waddled slowly, and picked up the first kernels. These were so good that she came readily after the next, and so followed the parson, as he let fall two more. The little fluffy balls, when they saw their mother so employed, all scampered like mad after her, to surround her. At last, she was so busily employed, that she didn't notice that she was running into an angle formed by the coop and the end of the barn. There was a rush. A sudden squawk, and the parson emerged from this corner, with Mistress Biddy in his hands.""Now, Joel, you can help me so much,"" he said cheerily. ""Run and push up the bar to the coop. Be careful not to let any more chickens out. There, that's right!"" In went Mistress Biddy, who gave an indignant fluff to her gray feathers, and then cackled crossly, and the bar flew down into place.""That's fine!"" exclaimed the minister in great satisfaction, getting up straight again. ""Now, Joel, it won't be such a task to catch the little chickens. Come away from the coop, and they'll run up when they hear her call,"" which was indeed the fact. They soon began to scamper as hard as they could from all directions as Mistress Biddy set up a smart ""cluck, cluck,"" until all of the seven were swarming over each other to get into the coop to mother.It was surprising, then, to see the minister's hands; they seemed to be here, there, and everywhere, and to pounce upon those little fluffy balls with unerring aim, and presently, there they were, Joel lifting the bar when bidden, in the coop, ""peeping"" away and huddling up to the dear gray feathery nest. The chickens who hadn't run out came up, as if wanting to hear the story, and what it was like to be out in the world.""It's nice to go blackberrying,"" hummed Phronsie, holding fast to a little tin cup the rag-man had presented her on his last visit. ""I'm going to pick ever and ever so many, to carry home to my Mamsie."""
"""I don't,"" said Polly, merrily, swinging her tin pail. ""I'd rather be down here and going blackberrying with you children. Well, come on, we ought to hurry, 'cause we want to take home as many as we can.""""Now, children,"" said Polly, when they reached the place where the bars were to be taken down, ""we must keep together, and not straggle off. Remember, Joe; then when we're ready to go home, it won't be such a piece of work to get started.""At this, such a dreadful distress seized the whole bunch of little Peppers, that they one and all scuttled as fast as they could through the long grass, Phronsie not looking back once to pick a single blossom; and Polly presently had her company all marshalled up in good order in a perfect thicket of blackberry bushes, where the berries hung as thick and ripe as could be.For a few minutes no one spoke; the big blackberries tumbling into the tin pails making the only noise, though Phronsie dropped hers into the grass as often as she put one in her little cup. And they worked so fast, that no one noticed that Polly's blue sky was getting overcast by white patches of puffy clouds that looked as if they were chasing each other. At last Joel said, ""Ow!"" and began to complain that he was all scratched up by the prickly bushes, and when Phronsie heard that, she set down her tin cup and held up her fat little arms. ""See, Polly,"" she said gravely.""O dear me, now that's too bad, Pet!"" So Polly had to come out from her nice little clump where she was picking fast, and kiss the little red marks on Phronsie's arms. ""Now don't lean in the bushes again; I'll show you a place. There,"" and Polly pointed to some low branches that stood out; and the blackberries on them were thick and ripe.Rumble--rumble! ""Oh, boys!"" gasped Polly, ""there can't be a thunder-storm coming!"" and she poked her head out from her clump, and stared up at the sky in dismay. ""There surely is! Now we must run home like everything."" She skipped out and seized Phronsie's arm. ""Come, Pet,"" and not stopping to look, she set out upon a run. Phronsie began to wail, and then pulled back. ""I've left my cup, Polly,"" she said.""Didn't you bring it?"" cried Polly, pausing a minute. ""Boys,"" as she saw that they hadn't started, ""come this minute, and bring Phronsie's cup,"" she screamed. ""Now come on, child; they run so much faster they will soon overtake us.""Phronsie, with her mind at rest about her cup, kept up as well as she could by Polly's side. ""I guess I shall have to carry you,"" at last said Polly, as the boys came rushing up in high glee over their dash across the meadow."
"""What--the berries? Oh, never mind, Pet, you shall have some of mine,"" said Polly, whose only thought was how to get home as quickly as possible. ""Goodness me, child!"" as a raindrop splashed on her nose. ""I really shall have to carry you,"" and Polly picked her up, and tried to hurry over the ground.""Well, the boys spilled 'em, I s'pose,"" said Polly, staggering on, her own tin pail swinging from her arms, while Phronsie grew heavier and heavier every minute, and the clouds blacker and blacker. ""Dear me, I didn't think it was so far across this meadow!"" when suddenly Joel screamed out, ""Oh, Polly, he's coming!"" and there, from the further corner of the field, was walking quite smartly a bull, and he was looking straight at her and Phronsie.""I mustn't run,"" said Polly; ""Mamsie said once, I remember, I must look straight at any cross animal, and not let 'em see that I was afraid."" So she set Phronsie down on the ground. ""Now, Pet, don't run, but walk to Joel as fast as you can,"" for Joel and David were over the bars, which they hadn't taken the trouble to take down for themselves, intending to do it for Polly and Phronsie when they should come up.""Don't run, Joe,"" called Polly, in a warning voice; ""just take her over the bars."" Then she slowly went backward, keeping her brown eyes fastened on the bull, who still walked toward her, with his eyes fixed on her face.Joel got Phronsie safely over the bars, David, with trembling fingers, pulling her from the other side, and all was going on well when Polly stepped backward into a little gully, and over she went in a heap. In a minute, the bull tossed his head and quickened his pace, and by the time she was up on her feet, he was coming on toward her at a trot, and with an angry light in his eyes.All of a sudden, Joel shot past her. ""I'll stop him, Polly,"" he said cheerily, and he dashed in between her and the bull, who, not liking this interference, now shook his head angrily. Joel then turned off, and the animal went after him.""Joel, you'll be killed!"" cried Polly, rushing after him, to make the bull turn from the chase. But it was useless; for both were now well across the field, Joel running like wildfire, and the bull snorting and kicking up the ground in his rage after him. And Polly, straining her eyes, pretty soon saw Joel turn swiftly and duck, and the bull run with full force against a tree, before he could stop himself. And there was Joel clambering over a high stone wall. Then she started and rushed for the high bars, climbed them in a flash, and when the disappointed bull came running back, there she was, with the other two, huddled up in a place of safety. And in a minute Joel scrambled around from his stone wall. So there they were, all together, safe and sound!""Joey,"" said Polly, when they paused a moment to take breath, ""you must give Phronsie some of your berries when we get home; that's a good boy, for I promised her some of mine. Hers got spilt, and now I haven't any.""""Children, I've got such a surprise for you,"" said Mother Pepper, as soon as she could take off the wet clothes from Phronsie, and get her into something dry. ""Now, you all better get your things off, and hang 'em to dry by the stove, and get on some clean clothes."""
"""But oh, Mamsie, you can't think how splendid Joe was!"" cried Polly, with shining eyes; ""he couldn't have done better if he'd had a sword and gun."" Then she told it all over--his part--dilating at great length upon it, until Joel got down on the floor and rolled and kicked in dismay, because he couldn't stop her.So Polly, glad enough to tell the story, went over it all, bit by bit. When she came to Joel's part, Ben seized him from off the floor. ""See here, I'll give you a ride, Joe, in honor of it,"" and setting him on his shoulder, Ben pranced around and around the old kitchen, till Joel screamed with delight.""I'll go,"" said Joel, flying off with alacrity. So Phronsie and David came running in, well pleased to be once more in the midst of things; and then it was time for supper, and all the while she was laying the cloth and getting out the dishes, Polly was looking at Joel, and her brown head went up proudly, and every once in a while she would run over and drop a kiss on his stubby hair.But Davie was spared that tribulation, for when the next day came, Mrs. Pepper had so much work for them all to do, that the chase dropped entirely out of Joel's mind, even if he had a moment in which to accomplish it. The great surprise that Mrs. Pepper had told them of, now came out, everybody being so full of the adventure with the bull, that it completely crowded out everything else.""You know that too, Joe,"" said Polly, with a cold shoulder for him. ""Do let me be, I want to guess Mamsie's surprise. O dear me! whatever can it be?"" She wrinkled up her brows, and lost herself in a brown study.""No."" Mrs. Pepper laughed outright to see their faces. ""You can't guess,"" she said again, ""so I'll tell you. Mrs. Brown is sick, and I'm to make her blackberry jell over here; and she's given me some sugar, besides the pay she'll give me, so now we can have our pie.""There was a perfect babel at this, the five little Peppers having always before them the hope of some day hearing their mother say they should have a blackberry pie--to make up for not being able to accomplish the chicken pie that Polly and all the others had so longed for--and which was quite beyond their expectations. Now the blackberry pie was really coming!""And I can't do it just after breakfast, either,"" said Mrs. Pepper, ""for I must begin as soon as I can on the jell, and you must all help me. There is ever so much you can all be useful in, about making jell. All but Ben, he's got to go to work, you know.""""Just as soon as ever this jell is done and out of the way,"" said Mother Pepper, in her cheeriest tones. ""So, Polly, fly at getting the breakfast ready, and when that's eaten, we'll all, except Ben, tackle the jell.""""The preserve-kettle,"" answered Mrs. Pepper. ""She'll tell you where 'tis. I told her I'd send you over for it. And be real still, Joe, and don't ask her questions, 'cause she's miserable, and is in for a long sick spell if she doesn't look out."""
"""No, I don't suppose he could really hurt it any,"" said Mrs. Pepper, ""but he oughtn't to drag it along and bump it. Things that don't belong to us should be handled extra carefully. Well now, Joe, set down the kettle, and go and wash your hands, you and Davie, and then come back and pick over these blackberries, and Polly'll take hold as soon as she gets through with the work."" ""Now,"" said Polly, to the old stove, ""just remember how you acted that day when Mamsie made Mrs. Brown's jelly!"" She was standing in front of it, and she drew herself up very straight. ""You ought to be ashamed, you naughty thing, you! to make such trouble. Now I've stuffed you up all good and nice in the holes, and when I come home I'll build a fresh fire, and then, says I, you've got to bake a whole batch of bread just as nice!"" and Polly shook her brown head very decidedly, and whirled off to the bedroom door. ""Come, Phronsie,"" she called, ""hurry up, Pet. O dear me!"" Phronsie still sat on the floor by the big bureau, with one red-topped shoe in her hand, and patting it.""Deary me, that's no matter,"" exclaimed Polly. ""We'll have that all right in a twinkling."" So she sat down on the floor, and took Phronsie's foot in her lap, and unbuttoned and buttoned up the shoe. ""There now, that's done as spick-span as can be.""""See here now, Pet,"" cried Polly, decidedly, ""if you don't pull on that shoe quickly, I shall have to do it, for we must start--"" which had the effect to make the little red-topped shoe slip on to Phronsie's fat foot in a trice.""Now you and Davie must look after the little brown house,"" said Polly, feeling very grown up and important, ""and be good boys while we're gone down to the store after the bundle of sacks Mr. Atkins has got for Mamsie.""""Well, you better come right down and play in the kitchen,"" said Polly, ""then you can look after things;"" and she helped Phronsie downstairs and took her hand, and they walked down the path and off on to the road in a very dignified way, for Polly loved to be fine, and it was always a gala occasion when she could dress Phronsie up neat and nice, for a walk to the store.""I very much wish we had a parasol,"" sighed Polly, who never could get over the longing for one, ever since she saw Miss Pettingill's green sunshade, with waving fringe, that she carried to church; ""but then, I don't suppose I'll ever get one,"" and she sighed again.Meanwhile, Joel turned to Davie up in the loft. ""We'll keep the crickets in the box,"" he said, ""till by'n by, an' go down, 'cause Polly said so. And I'm goin' to help her; you'll see."" With these mysterious words he shoved a tin box half full of hopping black crickets under the bed, saying, ""There, the cover's on. Come on, Dave,"" and scrambled down the stairs to the kitchen.Little David went down more slowly, as if something were on his mind. When he reached the kitchen, Joel was standing in front of the stove, a pile of paper was down on the floor at his feet, and he had a match in his hand. Davie stared at him in amazement.""Of course I am,"" declared Joel, boldly. ""I heard Polly talking to the old stove just before she went away, and she's got to bake bread when she gets home, an' it's all right, an' she'll be so glad to see it ready for her."" All the time he was talking he was stuffing the paper into the stove; then he ran into the woodshed, bringing out some kindlings. ""We've got to fill the wood box, Dave,"" he said, to make talk and divert David's mind; and he crammed the wood in after the paper, till there wasn't much room left."
"""I'm big enough,"" declared Joel, strutting around and pulling at the things that Polly said were dampers--though why they should be damp, when there was a fire in the stove every day, he never could see. ""And when Polly sees that I can make it as good's she can, she'll let me do it every day. Yes, sir-_ree!_"" With that he drew the match, and held it to an end of the paper, sticking up. And forgetting to put back the cover, he raced off to the wood, shed again for another armful of kindling.""Why didn't you put the cover on?"" cried he, terribly frightened, for he began to think, after all, perhaps it would be quite as well to let Polly make the fire. ""It'll be all right, I'll have it on in a minute,"" suiting the action to the word, as he stuck the lifter into the cover and advanced to the stove.When Davie said that he couldn't do it, Joel made up his mind that he would. Besides, the very thought of the little brown house taking fire turned him desperate with fright; so he made a second dash, and somehow, he never could tell what made it, the cover slid on, and the flames muttered away to themselves inside, in a smothered kind of way, and there they were, shut up as tight as could be.David was beyond caring whether or no he was called a 'fraid-cat, being stiff with fright, so Joel strutted away to his heart's content. ""Now I must put in more wood,"" he declared, and, twitching off the cover, he crammed the stove as full as it would hold, on top of the blazing mass. Then he wiggled the dampers again, to suit him, paying particular attention to the little one in the pipe, then wiped his grimy hands, in great satisfaction, on his trousers.""You see 'tisn't anything to make a fire,"" he observed to David; ""an I'm goin' to build it every single day, after this. Polly'll be so s'prised. Now come on, Dave, let's go an' play,"" and Joel gave a long and restful stretch.Little David, seeing the stove behaving so well, gave a sigh of relief, and coming slowly out of his fright, clattered after Joel, and soon they were down back of the house, where they had scooped out the ground, and filling it with water, had made what they called a pond. Here they now began to sail boats made out of bits of paper.""Hi--there--you!"" shouted a harsh voice. Joel and David, absorbed in getting their boats across the pond without running into each other, didn't hear. ""_Hi!_"" yelled the voice again, ""your house is afire!""Joel lifted his black head and stared. ""Come here, you!"" screamed a man, jumping out of a wagon in the middle of the road, in front of the little brown house. He was big and redheaded, and he held a whip in his hand.Sure enough. Great volumes of smoke came pouring out of the chimney, which wasn't any too good, and once in a while a tongue of flame would sweep out, licking the sides of the bricks, as much as to say, ""You can't shut me up entirely, you see."" Oh, how merrily they danced! ""Get a bucket. Step lively, if you want to save your house!"" roared the man at Joel, who took one good look at the chimney, then sprang for Mamsie's pail. ""Get something, Dave,"" he screamed, ""and bring some water."""
"Now that the fire had really come, David, strange to say, felt all his fright dropping from him. It was as if Mamsie said, ""Save the little brown house, dears,"" and he rushed on the wings of the wind over down across the lane, and helped himself to Grandma Bascom's big bucket, always standing on a bench beside her kitchen door. And, with it almost full of water, he soon stood by the big red-headed man's side.""You're a likely-headed pair o' chaps,"" said the man, as Joel dashed up with his pail, which he hadn't been able to find at once, as Mamsie had put some cloth she was going to bleach into it, and set it in the woodshed. ""Now, then, I must climb the roof, an' you two boys must keep a-handin' up th' water as smart as you can.""""Do ye think ye kin?"" asked the man. But Joel was already halfway up. And presently the first pail of water was handed up, and splash it went on the flames, by this time coming out very lively at the chimney-top. But it didn't seem to do any good, only to sizzle and siss, for just as soon as a pailful of water was dashed on, out they popped again, as bright as ever. A boy, coming whistling down the road, stopped suddenly, took one look, and ran like lightning over across the fields on a short cut. ""Fire--_fire!_"" he screamed, and pretty soon, by dint of jumping stone walls and fences, he got into the street, at the end of which stood Mr. Atkins' grocery store. ""Fire--_fire!_"" he bawled every step of the way. ""Where--where?"" cried the people at the store, rushing to the door and craning their necks, as he flew by, intent on getting to the fire-engine house, so as to run back with the men who dragged the machine by the ropes.""Now, Polly,"" Mr. Atkins was just saying, when the boy's scream was heard, ""you tell your Ma she needn't hurry about these coats. I guess that paper'll cover 'em, if I put another knot in th' string. My land! what's that!--""""Come, Phronsie,"" said Polly, hoarsely, seizing the little fat hand. Phronsie, who was regarding some very pink and white sticks in a big candy jar on the shelf, tore her gaze away, and followed obediently as Polly pulled her along to the door.""Here, I'll take you,"" cried an old farmer with a long beard that looked like a bunch of hay, and he seized Phronsie and set her in his big wagon. Polly hopped in beside. ""Don't be scart. We'll all go down and help,"" screamed a half dozen voices after her. Rattle--rattle--clang came the fire-engine, the boy who had brought the news having secured one of the most important places at one of the long ropes. And away they went, the procession gaining in length and strength at each step, till it seemed as if all Badgertown were on the road and bound for the little brown house.The big red-headed man had dashed up to the roof by the side of Joel. ""You better go down and hand water,"" he said, ""an' bring the axe, we may have to cut away th' ruf."" Joel, knowing it was worse than useless to disobey, slid down, and got the axe first, to have it ready--oh, dreadful thought!--to cut the little brown house with; and then the two buckets, as full as they could be lifted, went up, and came down empty. Up and down. Up and down."
"None too soon! A little fork of flame was just beginning to pop its head out between the shingles close to the chimney, as if to say, ""You really needn't think you are going to keep us shut up."" Up clattered the fire-engine with a dreadful noise into the back yard, which suddenly seemed to be full of people of all sizes. Joel, when he saw the firemen on hand, sprang for the roof again. This time he staggered up with his bucket of water.""Oh, Joel!"" He looked down and saw, as well as he could, for something seemed to be the matter with his eyes, Polly's face. Now that the danger was all over, for of course the fire-engine and all those people would save the little brown house, Polly was the last person whom Joel really wanted to see. And he busied himself in helping to haul up the water-buckets, that now came up pretty lively as the boys filled them and handed them to the firemen.""Let him alone,"" said the big red-headed man, ""he'll work as smart as any two of ye men. If it hadn't 'a' been for him and that one there,"" pointing with a grimy thumb to David on the ground, still patiently getting water and handing up his bucket, ""we'd 'a' been all burnt up, by this time.""""Oh, Joel,"" screamed Polly from the ground, looking at him piteously, ""do come down, dear!"" But he really didn't hear now. It seemed to him if he didn't work to the very last, he could never look Mamsie in the face again, so he was now on the other side of the chimney, where the fire was the hottest.""Then we've got to cut just that spot,"" said the big red-headed man, who, by reason of being on hand first, was considered to be the leader, and he swung his axe over his head. ""Crash!"" went the little brown roof. At the sound, Polly dragged Phronsie over to David's side.""Now, then, in with the water lively, boys, and splash her out,"" cried the big red-headed man, who very much liked being a leader. And thereupon he stopped working, and set the others at it in such a brisk fashion that the water ran down in perfect rivers all over the roof, one or two of the streams soaking through, to drop into Ben's and Joel's and David's bedroom in the loft.""Look behind you!"" screamed the boy who had first discovered the fire. He seemed to have eyes in the back of his head, and the firemen, whirling around, saw a little tongue of flame shooting determinedly up. It had run along underneath the shingles and hopped at the first chance it could get. So the buckets of water had to keep on flying up, to come down and be filled. Up and down, up and down, till Polly sank on the grass, unable to bear it another bit longer. ""Oh, if I weren't a girl,"" she moaned passionately, ""then I could be up there, and I know I'd save the little brown house. Oh, Mamsie! Mamsie!""""Don't fret, Polly,"" said a good woman living in the village,--for by this time a long procession of men, women, and children had hurried in, crowding and jamming into the yard,--""ef it burns down, you shall all come to our house an' stay a spell, till you get another one."""
"""Don't,"" cried Polly, passionately, and shrinking off; ""we can't live, if the little brown house goes. Oh, Mamsie! Mamsie!"" and she sobbed as if her heart would break, and covered her face with her hands.""Don't cry, Polly,"" and Phronsie's little hand crept softly up to her neck. But Polly couldn't stop. If there had been anything for her to do, she would have kept up, but to sit there and see the little brown house burn up, and know because she was a girl there was no place for her on the roof--why, there she was, sobbing as if her heart would break, and Phronsie clinging piteously to her neck.A ringing shout struck upon her ear. ""It's coming!"" shivered Polly; ""the roof's tumbling in!"" and she hid her face lower yet. Wouldn't God stop the dreadful fire ever yet. He must, for Mamsie said He loved to help all His children. And--But Polly didn't understand, and they laid her back on the grass, and one woman said, ""Get a pamleaf fan,"" and another cried, ""Get th' water in that pail there,"" pointing to one not used, on the grass. And everybody got in everybody else's way, and crowded around her, and the water was dashed over her face till she was in a little pool of it, and still she didn't open her eyes. And Phronsie wailed and clung to her, getting as wet, so a thin woman remarked, ""as a drownded rat,"" and David was on the other side, nearly as bad. As for Joel, he rushed up and down, completely gone with fright. After all his brave fight, to have Polly give out was something so very dreadful he couldn't think of it.""Here comes Mrs. Pepper,"" said somebody, and, ""Thank the Lord,"" said another, and down the road in the doctor's gig, the little doctor driving like mad, came Mamsie. They helped her out, and she was in the yard, never looking at the little brown house; for her black eyes were searching among the crowd, and her white lips tried to frame some words.""Polly ain't just well,"" spoke up somebody, sympathetically, and in a minute Mamsie was down on the grass, with Polly's head in her lap, the other children swarming around her, and Dr. Fisher in the midst.""I'll find him,"" said little Dr. Fisher, who had his own views about Joel, after closely regarding his singed eyebrows and black face; ""lucky enough if he doesn't need considerable patching up,"" he muttered to himself, as he strode off to reconnoitre.""There's no use in your hiding,"" he said aloud, as if talking to some one. ""So you might as well come out at once, and let me know where you're hurt, Joe, and I'll fix you before your mother sees you.""""Oh, you are not?"" said the little doctor, opening the bushes to peer within, his spectacles setting well down on the end of his nose, so that he looked over them. ""That's good,"" and he soon had Joel out. ""Now then, I'll fix you up as good as ever,"" and he rummaged his ample pockets for the things he had thrust into them for this very work.""Stand still, Joe,"" said the little doctor, coolly, ""for I'm going to patch you up, so that you're decent to see your mother. Aren't you ashamed to get this way when Polly, poor brave girl, has been so sick? Why, what's the matter with you!"" suddenly giving Joel a whirl, so that he could look in his face."
"""I wanted--to--to--help Polly,"" gasped Joel. ""O dear me!"" He was a sight to behold, as the tears washed their way down the grimy face, which was still working fearfully, as he tried to hold in his sobs.""She stuck the putty in the holes,"" said Joel, very distinctly; ""don't you understand? Polly's stove is very old, and it's cracked, and she says the air comes in and then the fire goes down, so she has to stuff up all the mean old cracks. O dear me, I wanted to help her,"" and off Joel went in another gust of tears.""Yes, she does,"" declared Joel, shaking his stubby head decidedly. ""She cries dreadfully when Mamsie isn't looking. And she didn't know that I saw her, either, only I peeked behind the pantry door. And I wanted to--to--help her."" He began to cry afresh at the recollection.""Well, when you've got such a mother as you have, Joel,"" continued Dr. Fisher, ""you better treat her as well as you know how. So run along, and be quick with you,"" and Dr. Fisher gave him a resounding clap on the shoulder, that sent Joe flying off like a shot from a gun, while the little doctor stole off the back way, and got into his gig, and drove off as fast as he could, and thus escaped being thanked.And the Badgertown folks got together and held a meeting in Mr. Atkins' store that very evening, and said that it was a pity that Mrs. Pepper, who was struggling so to bring up all those five children, should have such a hard time. So each man put his hand in his pocket and fished out some money; and the carpenters came next day and mended up all the holes where the axe had cut through the roof; and the whole house was cleaned and dried where the water had run down, and then there was one dollar and forty-five cents left over, for people had been so very generous.""Just keep it, Mrs. Pepper,"" said the spokesman, ""'twill come in handy, most likely;"" and Mrs. Pepper couldn't speak, she was so taken aback. But they didn't seem to feel as if they hadn't been thanked enough, as they all went back again into the village.Ben had been working in a distant wood-lot for Deacon Blodgett, and so hadn't heard a word of the fire until he got into the village, on his way home. Then he said he wouldn't believe it, unless he should see for himself. So he ran every step of the way home, and rushed in all out of breath. ""What's happened?"" he demanded of the first person he met. This happened to be Polly.And Ben continued to blink every now and then up at the ceiling, varied by hurrying out to gaze at the roof, when he would rub his eyes. ""Dear me, Polly!"" he would exclaim, ""it seems just like an awful dream.""But the next day, when the Badgertown people came with their gift, then the five little Peppers changed about to the very happiest children in the world! And as soon as the visitors had gone, the whole bunch of Peppers just took hold of hands, and danced like wild little things around the table where the pile of silver quarters and ten cent pieces lay.That night, when the little brown house was as still as a mouse, Polly heard a loud scream come pealing down from the room in the loft. Mrs. Pepper, strange to say, didn't hear it at all; poor woman, she was very tired with her work, from which she had been hurried so unceremoniously when the alarm of fire reached her, and she had lain awake all the first part of the night with a heart burdened with anxious care."
"""Joel's dreaming all about the fire, most likely,"" said Polly to herself. So she slipped on Mamsie's old wrapper, picking it up so that she would not trip and tumble on her nose, as she sped softly over the stairs.""'Tisn't me,"" said Joel, in high dudgeon; ""I ain't a 'fraid-cat."" And Polly stared to see David sitting on the edge of the bed he shared with Joel, and tucking up his feet well under him, while he shook with terror as he cried shrilly, ""They're running all up my legs!""Polly hopped off the bed in her liveliest fashion, while from under Mamsie's wrapper scuttled a black object over the bedquilt in the opposite direction. ""What is it?"" she cried, beginning to shake violently herself; ""O dear me! are there any more of them?""""Yes,"" said Davie, ""there are lots and lots, Polly. O dear me!"" He couldn't twist himself into a smaller knot than he was, so there he sat, as miserable as possible, with the tears rolling down his face.""No,"" said Polly, firmly, ""I shan't, Joey Pepper. What are those black things that Davie--O dear me, there is another one!"" and Polly hopped back upon the bed, for there was a second black creature steering straight for her in the dim light.""See here, now,"" cried Ben, roused by all this, ""you just sit up in bed, Mister Joel, and tell Polly all you know about this business. Do you hear?"" And suddenly over came Ben's pillow flying through the air, to tumble over Joel's chubby nose.""Never mind,"" said Polly, quite reassured, ""they're nothing but dear, nice little crickets. I don't care, now; but it's dreadful to see black things in the middle of the night, when you don't know what they are.""""Shake your clothes,"" called Polly, in a smothered voice, fearful lest Mamsie and Phronsie should wake up. Thereupon she began to shake the old wrapper violently. ""We mustn't carry any of 'em downstairs,"" she said, while Joel set up a howl.The next morning, as soon as it was light enough to see them, Joel picked up all his crickets. It was no easy matter, for they made him an awful piece of work, hopping and jumping into all the corners; and, just as soon as his thumb and fingers were on them--away they were off again. But Ben had said every one must go. So at it Joel kept, until the perspiration just rolled from his tired, hot face.""You'd find if you took it there'd be quite enough sore throat for two,"" answered Mrs. Pepper. ""Well, run along, Joe, you wouldn't understand, and 'tisn't necessary that you should; only you are to do as I say, that's all.""So Joel ran off, waving a good-by to David; and since he was not allowed to kiss him, he gave a rousing ""Hooray,"" which delighted little Davie greatly, as he stood, his face pressed to the window, to see him go.Once within Mrs. Beebe's home, it was enchantment enough. It was a good afternoon for the shoe business, Mr. Beebe having two customers. One of them was a very fussy woman who had a small boy in charge. Joel was in high glee at being called upon to help lift down ever so many boxes, until pretty near every shoe in the stock was tried on. Mrs. Beebe kept coming out of the little parlor at the back of the shop, and saying, ""Ain't you through with Joel yet, Pa?"" all of which made Joel feel very important, indeed, and almost decided him to keep a shoe shop, when he grew up, instead of being a stage-coach driver."
"So Joel, who wished he could be there every day in the year, and that that woman would all the time bring in boys who wanted different shoes from any that Mr. Beebe had, climbed up like a squirrel and brought the box to Mr. Beebe.""Yes, pretty soon, Ma,"" replied her husband, quite worn out. ""Well, I'm sure I'm sorry I can't suit you, Marm,"" turning to the woman, ""but I honestly can't, for I've shown you every shoe in my shop. Here, Joel, we'll begin and pack 'em up again,"" he said, sorting the pairs out from the pile on the counter that ran across the side of the shop, and slinging them by the string that tied them together, over his arm.""All right, Marm,"" said Mr. Beebe, most obligingly. So he knelt down before Johnny again, and pulled on the shoes, and Johnny's mother told the boy to stand up and stamp in 'em, all of which was performed, and old Mr. Beebe got up and pulled out his bandanna and wiped his hot face.""Now that's somethin' like,"" said the woman, with a bob of her head, while her little eyes twinkled. ""I guess I know the right shoe, as well as the next one. Why didn't you show 'em to me before?"" she snapped.""Now, Joel,"" said old Mr. Beebe, when the little green door with its jangling bell had really closed on her and on Johnny, ""as soon as we get these shoes back again in the boxes, you better run into th' parler, 'cause Ma's been a-waitin' considerable.""Joel, much divided in his mind whether he would rather stay in the shop altogether, with the delightful shoes, or go out and spend half of the time with Mrs. Beebe and the doughnuts and pink and white sticks he felt almost sure were waiting for him, came to the conclusion that he really couldn't decide which was the more delightful; and then the shop-door bell jangled again, and there was another customer.""Nor I hain't seen you,"" declared the little man, just as well pleased, and sitting down gladly. ""I'm most beat out, a-gittin' here, so I want some new shoes, Jotham, and I cal'late I'll get 'em about as nice as they make 'em here.""""I cal'late so, too, Obadiah,"" said old Mr. Beebe, rubbing his hands together in a pleased way. ""Now, Joel, we'll get down all the shoes on this side,"" and he ambled across the shop, ""an' you can put up the boys' sizes, afterwards, if you want to.""""Pa, ain't you most through with Joel? Oh, why, here's Mr. Andrews!"" exclaimed Mrs. Beebe. Then she came into the little shop and sat down, while Mr. Beebe and Joel got out the shoes that were to be tried on. ""It's so nice that I can pass the time o' day with you, meanwhilst,"" she observed.""So do,"" cried old Mr. Beebe, delightedly, counting out the change. ""Now, Joel, you can pile all them shoes back, and then finish the boys' sizes, if you want to; and after that, Ma, he can go into the parlor, and be company to you.""""O dear me!"" exclaimed old Mrs. Beebe, quite aghast, as she glanced at the clock. ""Well, you must obey your Ma, and the only thing I see out of it is, you must come again."" So she stuffed into a paper bag all the pink and white sticks and doughnuts that were piled so nicely, in a company fashion, on a blue plate. ""There,"" she said, smothering her disappointment as best she could, ""take these home with you, and tell your Ma I expect you again, some day. We can't help it, 'cause Pa's been so busy,"" as Joel ran off."
"""I've sold shoes all the afternoon,"" he screamed, rushing into the little brown house, and for a moment forgetting the paper bag and its precious contents. Then it came ever him in a burst. ""Look at this!"" swinging it over Polly's brown head. She bobbed it up suddenly. ""Look out!"" screamed Joel, but too late; Polly's brown head bumped into the bag, and away it spun, and the doughnuts and pink and white sticks went flying all over the kitchen floor.""Ain't it!"" said Joel, his mouth watering to begin on them. ""Here's one more,"" spying a pink stick behind Mamsie's chair. ""Here 'tis. I've got it!"" emerging in triumph, and holding it fast. ""Where's Phronsie and Dave?""""I guess you'll laugh more yet, Grandma,"" declared Joel, untwisting the top of his bag, and bringing a pair of bright black eyes very close to it to peer within. ""It's perfectly splendid!"" he cried, holding his hands so no one else could see.""I guess it's doughnuts,"" said little Davie, ""'cause you've been to Mrs. Beebe's, and besides, I smell 'em."" Grandma smiled all the time, just as happily as if she had heard everything that had been said.""O dear me! I can't speak so's she'll hear,"" said Joel, in despair, to the others. So he shook the bag again, when the bottom of it came out, and away the doughnuts and pink and white sticks flew, and rolled all over the patched bed-quilt.But Joel was in the woodshed, hauling out the precious sled that Ben had made for the boys out of some boards and old sleigh runners that had been given him. He was dragging it out with a dreadful noise from the corner where it had stayed all summer, when Polly came running out.""Well, I'll help you,"" said Polly, taking hold of one end. ""Dear me, I do think this is the most splendid sled in all the world,"" she exclaimed enthusiastically. ""I don't see how Ben could make it so nice.""David now came running downstairs, and Phronsie, hearing that the sled was to be drawn out, pattered into the woodshed, too. ""Oh, Polly,"" she cried in rapture, ""now I'm going out to ride on it this very minute,"" and she danced round and round, clapping her hands in glee.At this dreadful suggestion, every one of the little Peppers in the woodshed rushed to the window, and Joel flung wide the door, so that a cold blast, carrying a feathery cloud of little flakes, swept in."
"""Oh, Joel!"" exclaimed Polly, ""shut the door, Phronsie'll catch cold."" Joel was already out in the house-place, dancing about, declaring it was going to be awful deep, and they could make a snow man soon, he guessed; so little Davie ran and pushed to the door, shutting off all chance of hearing the rest of what he was saying. He was gone some time, and the others ran into the kitchen, for Polly declared they would get no breakfast that day if she did not hurry up, and David and Phronsie thought it much nicer to watch the snowstorm from those windows than from the little tucked-up window in the woodshed. The consequence was that Joel ran in just as they had begun breakfast, in a fine glow, his cheeks very red, and his chubby nose as well. ""Why didn't you come?"" he demanded, with sparkling eyes.""What?"" asked Polly, quickly. ""You keep saying it's fine, and don't tell us what you've been doing. That isn't polite,"" she added, for Polly was quite particular as to her manners, and liked to be very genteel before the other children.""Oh, I've been riding in Miss Parrott's coach,"" said Joel, trying to appear as if this were an everyday occurrence, and eating on as if nothing had happened. Miss Parrott lived in an old ancestral house, about two miles from Badgertown. She was very rich, but kept entirely to herself, and drove about in an ancient coach, the envy of all the villagers. ""And I called you all to come, and you wouldn't.""""Oh, Joel Pepper!"" cried Polly, greatly shocked to think of the splendid chance they all had missed, and dropping the big spoon with which she was serving the mush, ""you never called us one single bit!""""O dear me!"" cried Polly, passionately, sitting back in her chair, ""I'd rather have gone in that coach than have done anything else, and now you've been, and we never'll get a chance again. Never in all this world!""So Joel hopped out of his chair and got a clean spoon for Polly, and then dived under the table and came back with the other spoon. ""Now begin and tell us all about it,"" said his mother. ""No, Polly, you needn't help him the mush till he's told.""So Joel, seeing he wasn't to get the mush until the whole story how he got his ride in the Parrott coach was related, began at once, and rattled it off as fast as he could. ""The--man--that-- drives--it--stopped--an'--I--was--in--th'--yard--an'--he--said-- don't--you--wanter--all--hands--o'--you children--to drive-- I've--got--to drive a--piece--down th'--road--an' I--called-- and--called--you--an'--we--went--an'--that's all. Now give me some mush!""""Out in the yard, Mamsie,"" answered Joel. ""Polly, do give me some mush,"" for Polly was so absorbed waiting to hear if Miss Parrott's coach was really lined with green satin, that she had forgotten all about Joe and his breakfast. So now she hastily dipped out the mush into the bowl that was waiting for it. ""Is it really lined with green satin, Joel?"" she cried breathlessly."
"""Why didn't you come back for us?"" asked David, suddenly. He hadn't eaten anything since Joel had rushed in with the wonderful story, and between Polly's disappointment and his own, was in a great state of distress.""Oh, jolly! look at the snow!"" screamed Joel, flying out of his chair. And sure enough, while they had been so engrossed, there it had been coming down faster and faster, until it was a powdery veil, almost too thick to see through.So somewhere in the middle of the morning, Joel and David started off with their sled, drawing on their mittens with the greatest satisfaction, and bobbing good-by to the others watching them from the windows.All went well, until Joe proposed that they should go to Simon's Hill, a long steep thoroughfare some two miles distant, that swung at the bottom very abruptly into the turnpike. And trudging off there, they climbed it with despatch, and began to coast down.""Oh, whickets!"" cried Joel, who was steering, little Davie hanging on behind, more than three-quarters afraid, though he wouldn't let Joel see it for all the world. ""Gee-haw-gee-haw-whee-dimp-dump,"" as they flew over the rises, bumping and twisting from side to side.""Well, you are going down again, eleven, no, I guess sixty times,"" declared Joel, ""after this. Gee-whiz-bump-bump-bang!"" This last was brought out of him by a sudden slewing to the side, where the slope ran off to the evergreen, scrub oak thicket; but Joel missed the edge by about an inch, so he screamed with delight, and whizzed safely down the rest of the hill.""Hi!"" screamed Joel, whizzing along. ""See us come down,"" but Farmer Seeley neither saw nor heard, and just then he concluded to steer his team up as near as possible to the hill-road. Joel saw this, and yelled, but he might as well have screamed to the hill. It was all done in a moment. Down flew the clumsy home-made sled, that couldn't be turned in a second; Joel frantically steering to get past the big awkward team, that was blocking up the way, David clinging to him in a dumb helpless terror. Z-z-rr-thud! and the first thing that old Farmer Seeley knew, four small arms and legs were waving frantically in the air, and thrown suddenly, with a mixture of boards and runners, against the ox-team of wood, with an awful crash; and then all was still.""Land o' Goshen!"" ejaculated Farmer Seeley, at the crash. ""What's that 'ere? O my gracious Peters!"" as he saw what it was as well as he was able, for his poor eyes. And getting off from the team he went to the spot, shaking so in every limb, that he could hardly walk."
"There was no sound beneath the upturned sled, where it lay just as it had been thrown against the wood-pung, and for one dreadful moment Farmer Seeley thought the two boys to whom the small legs and arms belonged were dead, and he shook so his false teeth rattled in his head, and he sat right down in the snow. ""Polly,"" said Mrs. Pepper, ""don't worry any more about the boys not coming home; just keep the potatoes hot in the oven."" For Polly had run to the window about a dozen times, wondering where they could be, and why they didn't come back for dinner.""They are having a nice time, somewhere, bless their hearts,"" said Mrs. Pepper, with a smile. ""I'm so glad the snow has come early, for they've been longing for it so much."" She hadn't felt so happy and contented for a good while, for besides rejoicing in her boys' pleasure, Mr. Atkins had given her this very morning an order to knit as many mittens as she could, and she even caught herself humming a little tune.""No, dear, I shouldn't."" Mrs. Pepper stopped her work long enough to lay her hand caressingly on Polly's brown hair. ""Why, it wouldn't seem like the little brown house at all, Polly, and I don't know what we should any of us do, if you stopped it.""""Yes,"" said Mrs. Pepper; ""for it's good for you to know how. But I shan't be willing to have you help me any more than you do now. I wish you didn't have to work so hard, child,"" and an anxious cloud overspread the brightness on Mother Pepper's face.""Oh, I'm not going to work too hard,"" cried Polly, with happy throbs at her mother's words. And she dashed off to her interrupted work, and Mrs. Pepper smiled, as presently Polly began to sing so merrily that Phronsie set up a little song, till the old kitchen was the cosiest place possible. At last, in a lull, Mother Pepper called, ""Polly, what is this stopping at the gate? Tell him we don't want any,"" as she saw it was a load of wood.Polly ran to the door, and was beginning to say, ""We don't want any wood,"" when her face turned very white, and she ran over the snow on unsteady feet. ""Oh, Joel, what is it?"" throwing her arms around him. But before he could answer, there was Mrs. Pepper close behind her.They lifted Davie down from the pile of wood, where they had made him as comfortable as possible, Farmer Seeley and Joel; the old man tried to tell that ""'Twarn't none o' my fault. Th' boys ran into me,"" but Joel, for the first time in his life, was without words.The old farmer, not hearing this, or indeed much of the talk, kept saying at intervals, ""'Twarn't my fault. I ain't to blame,"" till Mrs. Pepper carried David into the little brown house, and the others, following mournfully enough, the door was shut.David was laid up with a sprained ankle, that was all, after the upset. But Joel found it dismal enough to play out in the snow alone, and he kept pretty close to the window, so that he could look up and sing out once in a while to Dave seated by it in Mamsie's big rocking chair. And pretty soon, one day, Ben brought Davie out, all bundled up, and set him carefully on the big sled.""There you are!"" cried Ben, depositing his burden, ""as fine as can be,"" all the rest of the family flocking around to tuck David in tighter, and to pull his tippet closer, and to be sure that he had his mittens on.""Hooray!"" screamed the voice again, and Joel, staring as hard as he could, saw two boys pop up from behind a stone wall, and come rushing down toward him, each with a large snowball in his hand. And the next thing, the snowballs flew through the air, and one hit David in the neck, and burst all over his tippet. Joel didn't care that the other one gave him a whack on the head."
"At this Joel looked all around in despair for a moment to see if any one was coming who would help. ""Davie's ankle. O dear me!"" he thought. So he got between the sled and the biggest boy. ""You let him alone!"" he cried sturdily, setting his teeth tight together.Suddenly both boys made a rush at David, meaning to make him eat snow and have one ball thrust down his back at one and the same time, but Joel was too quick for them, and the first thing they knew, as David gave a scream at their approach, two hard little fists were pommelling them to right and left.""Stop it!"" they cried. But Joel didn't know how to stop; he pounded away so much and so fast, and they didn't exactly seem to know where he was going to strike next, that in a few minutes both boys were crying as hard as they could.""Joel Pepper!"" exclaimed a voice, suddenly, that made all the boys skip, while little Davie shook in much worse apprehension than he did before. ""Fighting in the public road! Well, I never heard anything so dreadful!""""And it's bad enough to fight, without telling a lie about it,"" said Miss Jerusha, holding up her black gloves in horror. ""I ain't fighting. And I didn't tell a lie,"" declared Joel. ""And you mustn't say so,"" he added, advancing on her with blazing eyes.""I'm sure I don't know nor care whether he did or not,"" retorted Miss Jerusha, shrilly. ""And you're very pert, Polly Pepper, to set yourself up against your elders. When I was a little girl I never contradicted folks. Never in all the world! What is your mother thinking of, to bring you up in this way?"" And she held up her black gloves again.""Yes,"" said Polly, hoarsely. ""Joel, come home with me this minute; don't say another word, Mamsie wouldn't like it,"" she commanded. She seized the rope, and Joel, removing his eyes with the greatest difficulty from Miss Jerusha's face, grasped it, too, and the little Peppers went as swiftly as they could go, back home to Mamsie, leaving the other three in the middle of the road.In front of the little brown house stood a big comfortable sleigh of the old-fashioned pattern. Although it had once been very handsome, it was now faded and ancient. A man who almost looked as if he had gone into service along with the sleigh and the other belongings of his mistress, sat primly upon the front seat. He expressed as much pleasure at seeing the little Peppers coming, as his stoical countenance would allow, but he didn't move a muscle of face or figure. At any other time Joel would have howled with delight at seeing Miss Parrott's man sitting there before the house, and in a sleigh. And it wouldn't have been a minute before he would have been in that sleigh, and on that front seat, besieging that stiff figure to let him drive. But now Joel flew by, dropping the rope, and rushed into the house, and Polly was left to drag David to the door, and call to Mamsie to help lift him off. But she stopped to say to Miss Parrott's man, ""I must stop to speak to Mamsie, first, if you please."""
"Miss Parrott's man so far forgot the ancient usage of his years that he rubbed his eyes as Polly turned away, and then he turned and continued to gaze at her as long as she was to be seen. For he really could not believe that it was the same little girl who had danced down the road, with sparkling eyes and rosy cheeks, and he even glanced nervously around, the more he thought about it.""Mamsie!"" cried Joel, hoarsely, flinging himself into Mother Pepper's arms, as she came to the door to meet him, her face beaming with happiness at the realization that Miss Parrott's sleigh actually was waiting at the door to take her little ones for a sleigh-ride, ""Mamsie! Miss Jerusha says I told a lie. Did I, Mammy?"" and Joel clutched her and broke into a torrent of tears.""Now, Polly,"" said Mrs. Pepper, when there was no more to tell, and the children gazed at her in amazement to see her so cheerful, ""you just get yourself ready, as soon as ever you can. Wash your face good, and your eyes, and I'll spring to, and help Joey and Davie. Phronsie's all ready."" Indeed, she was, and sitting patiently on her little cricket all this time, her small mittened hands folded in her lap. To Phronsie, every bit of the fuss of getting ready for a trip was always as much of a delight as the expedition itself, and was enjoyed with grave pleasure.""And, dear me!"" continued Mother Pepper, in her briskest fashion, all the while she was washing and patting and pulling the two boys into just the right condition for such a grand occasion as this, ""there is Miss Parrott's man waiting out there all this time! Now see how good you can stand still, Joey, and then we'll be as quick as we can be."" And pretty soon they were all ready, and Joel's swollen nose and red eyes didn't look so very much as if he had been crying, and Polly's face showed very little trace, after all, that she had been crying, too. So they all went down to the gate, Mother Pepper and Polly and Joel carrying David, and Phronsie walking gravely behind.""I am very sorry,"" said Mother Pepper to Miss Parrott's man, still immovably staring at them, ""to keep you waiting. It is not my children's fault, I should say that."" Then she helped them in, and tucked the big fur robes all nicely around the three on the back seat. Joel, of course, was by this time snugly settled on the front seat.""Now, children,"" said Mrs. Pepper, regarding them for a moment, and standing quite still by the roadside, ""you are to have the very nicest time you ever had in all your lives. Remember!"" and she smiled at them, and all the sunbeams that ever shone seemed to hop right down into their hearts. Miss Parrott's man solemnly gathered up the reins tighter in his hands, and touched the horses with the whip with the same dignity, and off they went.Mrs. Pepper watched the big sleigh till she couldn't see a speck of it; then she turned and went into the house, took down her Sunday bonnet and shawl, for this was to be a call of importance, and soon she had left the little brown house, and was walking rapidly over the snowy road to the minister's house.It wasn't two minutes before Joel was laughing gayly, and bobbing around with an important air on that front seat to the others on the back seat, and Polly found herself tossing scraps of nonsense back at him and the two others, and little Davie smiled happily. As for Phronsie, she sat wedged in between the other two, her little mittens folded in her lap, in grave satisfaction. Miss Parrott's man drew a long breath when all this was accomplished, and the only word he said for the first two miles was, ""I guess you're all right _now_.""Where they went, no one of the four little Peppers could have told. It all seemed like Fairyland, a great enchanted space of winding snowy roads, dazzling in the morning sunlight of a perfect winter day; every little crystal sparkling away on a pine tree, where it had to melt away, seemed to come out and wink at them, as the stately horses bore them along. All the fields sleeping under their soft, white blankets, were new to the Peppers gliding by. That surely was not Deacon Brown's field, where they used to race across lots, on a summer day! And as for that being Mr. Blodgett's meadow--why! no one need ever tell them so; it was enchanted ground, and they were princes and princesses whirling by in their chariots."
