passage
"Alice was the youngest of the Parlin family. When Grandma Read called the children into the kitchen, and told them about their new little sister, Susy danced for joy; and Prudy, in her delight, opened the cellar door, and fell down the whole length of the stairs. However, she rolled as softly as a pincushion, and was not seriously hurt.It seemed to Susy that this was the happiest day of her life. She stole up to her mother and kissed her. ""O, mamma,"" said she, ""wasn't God good to send this little sister?--Why, I'm crying,"" added Susy, greatly surprised: ""what do you suppose makes me cry, when I'm happy all over--clear to the ends of my fingers?""The nurse who was a smiling woman, with a wart on her nose, began to frown a little, and grandma Read, patting Prudy's head, whispered to her that if she did not stop crying she must leave the room, as the noise she made disturbed her mother.""O, fie, Miss Prudy,"" said the nurse, biting her lips; ""now you'll certainly have to leave the room. It's not safe for you to come near this tiny bit of a baby. Nobody ever knows what you are likely to do next.""Both children cast a lingering look at the bewitching little figure, so daintily wrapped in a fleecy blanket. Prudy felt tempted to snatch her up and give her a good hugging, but stood in mortal fear of the nurse. There was something awful about Mrs. Fling: Prudy presumed it was the wart on her nose.""You see,"" argued Susy, ""it's boys that fires all the popguns, and whistle in your ears, and frighten you. Why, if this was a brother, we couldn't but just live! What made you cry for a brother, Prudy?""""'Twill be as mother says about giving her your dress, Prudy; but we shall be glad to see you kind to the new sister,"" said Susy, who was fond of giving small lectures to Prudy. ""We ought to be kind to her, for God sent her down on purpose. Of course it will be ME that will take the most care of her; but maybe they'll let you watch her sometimes when she's asleep. Don't blow open her eyes any more, Prudy; that's very naughty. If we do just as we ought to, and are kind to her, she'll be a comfort, and grow up a lady!""The new baby was very wonderful indeed. The first thing she did was to cry; the next was to sneeze. Prudy wished ""all the people down street, and all the ladies that lived in the whole o' the houses, could see the new sister."" Her heart swelled with pride when admiring ladies took the unconscious little creature in their arms, saying, ""Really, it is a remarkably pretty child. What starry eyes! What graceful little fingers! Isn't her mouth shaped like Prudy's?""Mrs. Parlin did not approve of cradles, and the nurse had a fashion of rolling the baby in a blanket and laying her down in all sorts of places. One day little Prudy flung herself into the big rocking chair, not noticing the small bundle which lay there, under a silk handkerchief."
"It was feared at first that the baby was crushed to death; but when she was heard to cry, Mrs. Parlin said, ""We have great cause for thankfulness. So far as I can judge, it is only her _nose_ that is broken!""Prudy ran to look in the glass, but could not see anything the matter with her nose, or anything that looked like ""a joint."" But after this she was as careful as a child of her heedless age can be, not to injure her tender sister. She never again saw a silk handkerchief without shaking it to make sure there was not a baby under it.She grew to be a fair, fat baby; and while her teeth were pricking through, like little pointed pearls, Susy's front teeth were dropping out. Then she grew to be a toddling child; and while she was learning to walk, Prudy was beginning to sew patchwork. For time does not stand still; it passed, minute by minute, over the heads of Susy, Prudy, and Alice, as well as all the rest of the world. And soon it brought an end to Alice's babyhood. In spite of all Mr. Parlin had said against it, his little daughter was called by various pet names,--such as Midge, and Ladybird, and Forget-me-not. Very few were the people who seemed to remember that her name was Alice.And because of these tiny whirl pools, the child was usually called Dotty Dimple. From the time she could stand on her own little feet, she was a queen of a baby, and carried her small head very high. If she chanced to fall over a chair she seldom shed a tear, but thought the chair had treated her shamefully, and ought to be shut up in the closet. She never liked to have any one kiss her little bruises and pity her. It gave great offence if any one said, ""Poor Alice!"" She seemed to grow half a head taller in a minute, and looked as if she would say, ""Needn't make a baby o' _me_!""Not that she really said so. Talking was a thing she did not often attempt, though she sang a great deal, with a voice as clear as a flute. Prudy mourned because her tongue ""did not grow fast enough."" But where was the need of speech? If she fancied she would like to be tossed to the ""sky of the room,"" she had only to pat her father's arm, and point upward, and the next minute she was flying to the ceiling, in high glee, and catching her breath. If she wished to go walking, it was enough to point to the door, and then to her hat. Her little forefinger was as good as most people's tongues, and served as a tolerably good guide-post, for it pointed the way she meant to go herself, and the way she wished others to go.One day, while Mrs. Parlin was making currant jelly, she allowed Prudy to stay in the kitchen, and see her strain the beautiful crimson juice. But as for Alice, she had been found pounding eggs in a mortar, and must be taken away. She was placed in care of Susy, who led her out upon the piazza, where she could watch the people passing by. ""_Pedadder!_"" cried Alice, showing her dimples. ""Yes, _piazza_; so it is,"" said careless Susy, beginning to read a fairy story, and soon forgetting her quiet little charge.Susy ran out upon the pavement, and looked up and down the street. Which way to go she could not tell, but started down street at full speed. ""O, I'm sure I ought to be going _up street_,"" gasped she; ""and if I was, I shouldn't think _that_ was right either. Wish I knew which way I should _expect_ Dotty to go, and then I'd know she'd gone just the other way."""
"After flitting hither and thither for some time, Susy ran home to give the alarm. Without stopping to remove the jelly from the stove, Mrs. Parlin, Norah, and Prudy ran out of doors, and taking different directions, started in search of the missing child.""O, her name is Alice Wheelbarrow Parlin, sir,"" whispered Prudy, in reply; ""and she had on a pink dress, and her hair curls down her neck, and she has the brightest eyes, and two years and a half of age, sir. O, where _do_ you s'pose she's gone to?""Prudy wondered why the man still kept whispering, but presumed there was some reason why the loss of Dotty aught to be kept secret. She looked at the long lumber-wagon, partly filled with barrels, and was on the point of replying, ""No, thank you, sir,"" when a bright idea occurred to her.""Well, can't say as to that, my dear,"" whispered the soap-man, shoving a barrel to one side, ""seeing as I don't know where your sister's to be found; but there's one thing certain--you'll get over the ground a good deal quicker riding than you would on your feet. I'm going to Pearl Street before I stop.""""It's my heart,"" whispered Prudy, faintly; ""it _whisks_ just like the eggs Norah beats in a bowl. But it's no matter, sir; I don't think I'm afraid,--or only a little speck,"" added she, in a lower whisper; for, though anxious to be polite, she did not mean to tell anything but the ""white truth.""""Why, Mr.--, why, _sir_, don't you know?"" replied the child, struck with a sudden fear that her strange companion was a crazy man. ""O, my stars! don't you know what you took me up for? Didn't you hear? My little sister ran off the piazza."" Then Prudy repeated the words aloud, slowly and on a high key, anxious this time to make her meaning very clear. ""She--ran--off--the--piazza, with a pink dress on, sir, and not a speck--of--a--hat. And I was stirring jelly on the stove, and never knew it till she was lost and gone. And we're all hunting,--me, and--mother, and--all. I thought you knew, sir; but if you didn't I guess I'd better get out!""The good-natured soap-man shook with laughter. ""Excuse me, little miss,"" said he, ""but the fact is, I understood you to say your sister's name was Alice Wheelbarrow Parlin, and that's why I was puzzled to know who you meant by Dotty.--But here we are at Pearl Street. Here, in this house, lives one of my best customers. Now, if you like, I'll lift you out, and you can go with me and inquire for your little sister. Then you can ride again, for I'm going as far as Munjoy.""So saying, the man took Prudy out in his arms. She knew it was rather odd for a little girl like her to be going around to people's back doors with a stranger in a blue blouse; but it was all for Dotty's sake.These whispered words fell on Prudy's ears with terrible force. A vague terror seized her. ""_I've come for your bones!_"" What could he mean? Was he an ogre, right out of a fairy-book? What did he want of that poor woman's bones?"
"The first thing she saw, as she entered her own door, was the fluttering of Dotty's pink dress. The runaway was safe and sound. She had only toddled off after a man with a basket of images, calling out, ""baa, baa,"" ""moo, moo,"" ""bow-wow."" The end of it was, that the image man had given her a toy lamb, for which she had said, ""How do,"" instead of thank you; and Florence Eastman had led her home.""Ah,"" said Mrs. Parlin, with a meaning smile; ""the trouble is, Susy, you've made up your mind that your memory is good for nothing: you _expect_ to forget! I _shall_ trust you again, and you must fully resolve to do better."" By the time Alice Parlin was three years old she could prattle like a bobolink, and thought herself quite as old and wise as either of her sisters. Every Sunday morning it made her very wretched to see Susy and Prudy set out, with bright faces, for Sabbath school!""You mustn't _contraspute_,"" cried Dotty, shaking her elbows. ""I _is_ goin' to Sabber school."" Then suddenly showing her dimples, she added with a bright smile, ""'Cause I's your comfort, you know, Prudy, your darlin', precious little comfort; isn't I, Prudy?""""Dear me,"" thought tender Prudy, ""the poor little thing always has to stay at home. I'll ask mother to let her go with me next time. It is right for me to ask, for I'm sure I don't _want_ her to go; so it isn't selfish!""Mrs. Parlin had a great many doubts as to Dotty's good behavior, but at last consented. She felt pretty safe to trust her with Prudy, who was very patient, and had even now a memory longer than Susy's.Before the time came to start for Sabbath school, Dotty stood a long while before the mirror, looking up at her gay hat and down at her cunning gaiters. She liked nice clothes, and it pleased her to see herself so prettily dressed.But Prudy had suddenly turned about, and gone back to the house, saying she had forgotten something. She had left home without kissing her mother good by, and nothing could console Prudy for the loss of one of her mother's caresses.""Why, you see,"" answered Susy, ""it says, 'God scattereth the snow like wool, and his hoar-frost like the shining pearls.' And my Sabbath school teacher tells us that after a while the sun draws it back, and makes clouds of it, as 'twas before. So, you see, the snow and the rain keep sprinkling down, and then rising up to the sky again.""""Please don't talk any more,"" returned Susy, suddenly lowering her voice; ""we must be very quiet on the street, for it's Sunday. You don't mean any harm, Prudy, but you say so much that I'm afraid I shall forget my lesson. I keep saying it over to myself, you know.""Susy and Prudy belonged in different classes. Susy recited from a question book, and Prudy learned verses from the Bible. Dotty Dimple went with Prudy into Miss Carlisle's class, where eight or ten little girls were already seated.Smiling, Miss Carlisle was very willing to ""excuse"" Dotty for her sweet sister's sake. But Prudy felt rather nervous. She made a place beside herself for Dotty, who folded her small hands and sat as still as a marble cherub; but what odd thing she might take it into her busy brain to do, no one could tell."
"Dotty listened to this, and Miss Carlisle's remarks upon it, with the most solemn earnestness, hoping to learn why it was that people should sit with a lamp shining on their feet. She thought she could now see why Prudy loved to go to ""Sabber school;"" it was because she heard so many funny things.Soon all the little girls had repeated their texts; but, to her great surprise, Dotty had not been called upon to say or do a single thing. It was a marked slight. She hardly knew whether to be angry or not. ""I guess the lady didn't see me,"" thought Dotty. So she cleared her throat with a loud noise, which echoed across the room. Then Miss Carlisle looked at her and smiled. She was off the seat, standing on her tiptoes, Prudy tried to draw her back; but so much the more Dotty persisted. She shook off her sister's hand.Dotty was not allowed to attend Sabbath school again that year; but it was a long time before she forgot some of the things she had heard Miss Carlisle say. Many of the strange words rang in her ears for weeks after wards, though she said nothing about them.One day she rushed into the nursery out of breath. Prudy was kneeling before her little trunk, putting in order the paper dolls, which Dotty had scattered over the floor. They were a sad sight. Some of them had lost their heads, and some had lost their fine clothes, which are worth as much as heads any day--to dolls.Without a word she seated herself on the floor, behind her sister, and drew off her shoes and stockings. She looked for a moment at her little pink toes, then rubbed the whole bunch of matches on the carpet, saying to herself, ""A lamp to my feet.""But, somehow, the lamp would not light itself. Dotty did not know how to turn back the chimney, and, though there was certainly blaze enough in the matches, it did not catch the wick. It leaped forward and caught the skirt of Prudy's dress.""You're burnin' afire! You're burnin' afire!"" shouted Dotty, dancing around her sister. Prudy now felt the heat, and screamed too, bringing her mother and Norah to the spot at once. The flames were soon smothered in a rug, and so Prudy's life was mercifully saved.""It's queer how things always happen just right,"" said Prudy, still trembling from her fright. ""You said, if I'd been wearing my calico, mother, I'd have been scorched. And you know it was only the littlest while ago I put on this blue delaine, to go to auntie's in!""All this time Mrs. Parlin and the two older children were having a fine walk. It was a bright June day. Prudy said she had to sing to herself for all the things she saw looked as happy as if they were alive. As Prudy talked, she flew from flower to flower, like a honey-bee."
"Mrs. Parlin suggested that Susy should keep on, and tell her aunt Eastman they were coming. Then she allowed Prudy to walk as ""zigzag"" as she pleased; for Mrs. Parlin had long patience with her children.Soon she saw something which caused her to forget her terror. Peeping in among the branches of a small tree, she espied what she called a ""live bird's nest."" Never having seen any young birds before, she wondered at first ""who had picked off their feathers."" The wee things seemed to be left to themselves while their mother was away providing supper.Before long Dotty Dimple arrived, in great triumph. She threw her chubby arms about her mother's neck, saying, ""Is I your little comfort, mamma? I camed in the hoss and carriage. S'an't give Prudy no supper--will you? 'Cause Prudy runned away!""Dotty looked as if she could easily forgive her cousin Percy. But there was one thing that made her nice supper taste like ""spoiled nectar,"" and that was the sight of Prudy enjoying her strawberries and cream.If she had runned away, as Dotty insisted upon believing, why was she not shut up in the closet? Strange to say, dearly as Dotty loved this kind sister, she enjoyed seeing her punished. She was vexed because Prudy was allowed, after all, to sit at the table with the rest of the family. The little creature was very tired, for she had driven ducks all the long summer day. She was also a little sleepy; and, more than all, it was one of her ""temper days,"" when everything went wrong.Without a word she walked off proudly to the kitchen, and came back with a handful of cold ashes, which she freely sifted into Johnny's flaxen hair. Mrs. Parlin saw that it was high time to take her youngest daughter home.""My dear child, I am her _mother_, and she could hardly do anything so naughty that I should cast her out of my heart. When she has these freaks of temper, I think, 'God bears with me, and I will try to bear with my little one. I will wait. One of these days, when her reason grows, she will be a real blessing to us all.'""Mrs. Parlin proceeded to put on Dotty's outer wrappings, saying she must be taken home. The child struggled and screamed, and declared she ""_would_ be good, she _would_ be a comfort;"" but her mother was firm, though her sweet temper never for a moment forsook her. Susy and Prudy looked on, and learned a lesson in patience which was worth twenty lectures.""Yes,"" said Prudy, her face radiant with a glow of love, warm from her heart; ""how good our mother always is, and always was, before ever our _reasons_ grew! Think what we'd do this night, Susy Parlin, if there wasn't any _mother_ to our house!""Little did innocent Prudy dream of the queer thoughts which were chasing one another in her little sister's brain. After she and Susy had gone, and the house was quite still, Dotty stood at the window, looking down street. It was a lovely day; the clouds were ""softer than sleep."""
"Then Dotty looked out of the window again. ""What a good little girl I am,"" thought she, ""not to be a cryin'! Prudy'd cry! There goes the blacksmif's shop."" Dotty meant the blacksmith. ""His mother lets him go everywhere. Everybody's mother lets 'em go everywhere.""""How do you do, little girl?"" whispered Dotty, in a voice so low that even the cat did not hear. ""O, what a booful hat you've got! Would your mamma make you wear a _rainy_ dress, like mine? No, she wouldn't. Your mamma lets you go to parties all the days only Sundays. My mamma has sticked me into the nursery, and nothin' but a dar'needle to sew with! O, hum! And I haven't runned away since forever'n ever! They don't 'low me to run away. Wish Fanny Harlow'd asked me to her party. I know why she never! 'Cause she forgot I was born.""However, by dint of much hard work she succeeded in squeezing her round little figure into the red merino, and fastening two of the buttons. ""O, hum!"" sighed she; ""this dress is so tight I shan't grow to-day!""Dotty had a great admiration for her mother's purple breakfast shawl, which she now threw over her little shoulders with tremulous delight. Nono's Sunday bonnet she next laid her naughty hands upon. Very charming was this bonnet in Dotty's eyes, as it was made of claret-colored silk, and was all on fire inside with scorching red and yellow flames. It was so huge and so deep that Dotty's small face under it looked as if it had got lost in Mammoth Cave.""Now I've got every single clo'es on me. Guess there won't anybody think I'm a boy this time,"" mused she, giving a last glance at the mirror; ""there won't anybody laugh, and say, 'How d'ye do, my fine little fellow?'""""Where _is_ the-girl-that-has-the-party's house?"" thought she, under her bonnet. ""Well, it's by the stone lions, 'most up to the North Pole. Now, Zippy, if we keep a-goin' we shall get there, and we'll see some girls out by the door."""
"The little figure now approached very slowly, its head bent down, its fingers in its mouth; though the girls saw nothing but a big, drooping bonnet, a purple shawl, and a pair of tiny feet peeping out from a red dress.Susy's face fell. If the little piece of obstinacy would stay, she _would_; and Mrs. Harlow politely declared they should all be delighted. But how would she behave at the table? Her manners were as yet unformed; she needed line upon line and precept upon precept. It was dreadful to think of her taking supper at one of the nicest houses in the city, in that dress, and without her watchful mother too! It was a severe trial to Susy. Prudy was also distressed, but her ""sky-like spirit"" brightened again speedily.The little girls all crowded about Dotty, begging her to join in their games; but she said it would ""hurt her big bonnet,"" which she could not be persuaded to take off, because she fancied it added something to her importance.Dotty looked at her sister with a withering glance, and, in her eagerness to prove that she knew how to handle books, suddenly tore one of the leaves. She was surprised and mortified; but her self-esteem was not easily crushed.Mrs. Harlow hastened supper, fearing that Mrs. Parlin might be anxious about her little daughter. Dotty was placed between her two sisters. Susy pinned a napkin about the child's neck, and in a whisper begged to be allowed to spread her bread and butter for her. Dotty had worn the air of a princess royal all the afternoon; but now, seated in a high chair, and surrounded by a group of admiring little girls, she felt like a crowned queen. Taking her bread in both hands, she crumbed it into her goblet of milk, and began to dip it out with the handle of her fork. The girls looked on and smiled, and Dotty gave a little purr of satisfaction.The little princess, from her throne in the high chair, did very rude things; such as coughing and blowing crumbs into her plate, drumming with her feet, and beating time with her fork and spoon. When bread was offered, she said,--""I've been thinking it all over,"" replied Susy, ""and I've made up my mind that God allows her to mortify you and me. You know we must have some kind of a trial, or we shouldn't grow gentle and sweet tempered."" At last Dotty's ""reasons"" did begin to grow. Her mother was too wise and kind to allow her to have her own naughty way; and by the time she was four years old she had very few ""temper days,"" and seemed to be growing quite lovely.But her sisters were troubled because she had not yet learned to read. Prudy remembered how ashamed she herself had felt when she first set out in earnest to go to school. For some time after her lameness she was so delicate that no pains had been taken to teach her to read.""Why, Dotty Dimple, you oughtn't to do so. You must answer when a question is asked. Wouldn't you like to learn your letters, like a goody girl, so you can read the nice books? Now be polite, and speak."""
"Prudy was obliged to smile but hid her face in the sofa-pillow, and hoped Dotty did not see her. She found she must hit upon some other plan. Dotty could not be made to feel the terrors of growing up a dunce.""Now we'll begin,"" said Prudy, no less delighted, pouring the blocks out of the box upon the floor. ""I'll ring the little tea-bell, and call the school to order. The school means _you_, and you must walk in and take your seat.""""O, take the rocking-chair!"" replied Prudy quickly. ""I'll sit on the ottoman; it's just as good. Glad you spoke of it, Dotty; 'twouldn't be proper for the teacher to rock. Hark! now I tingle the bell. School's begun!""""A nape!"" echoed Dotty, pointing at it, and laughing. ""O, my! you don' know nothin' at all but just--do you, Prudy Parlin? Funny gell to keep school! Didn't you never see a monkey? I've seen 'em dancing tummy-tum-tum, and a man making music with a little mite of a churn.""""No, he couldn't bark the way Zip did at the lecture, but he chattered, as we do when our teeth are cold. When he'd been doing mischief he'd run round the floor of the ship, wagging his head the way I do now, as if he was as innocent as a whole lot of kittens. Why, he acted as you did, Dotty, when you was a little girl, and picked the inside out of that custard pie.""When Dotty had learned A so well that she knew it at a glance, her teacher proceeded to the next letter, which stood on the block for a bat. Dotty said the picture looked ""like Zip with an umbrella over him.""The young sister sighed over her sister's light-minded behavior. When they came to C, which stood for cat, Dotty seized her kitty and tried to feed her with lozenges. But Pusheen turned away her head with a gesture which signified,--""Ah, well!"" thought the gentle teacher, with a sigh; ""I'll try again, some other day. I'll not give it up. Grandma says, 'Time and patience make the mulberry leaf into satin.' I don't know what that means, only it's something about _perseverance_."""
"The little school was not resumed for some time. Not that Prudy had forgotten it, by any means; but the next Saturday she had visitors, and the following Wednesday an exciting event occurred. It concerned Susy's pony. Percy Eastman said he was called Wings ""because he hadn't any feet."" Susy was vexed at this remark, and Prudy, taking her part, said, ""Percy is such a _pert_ boy;"" adding next moment, ""What _is_ pert?""Now it happened that Mr. Parlin, being too busy to go himself, sent Eddy Johnson and Charley Piper with Wings to the blacksmith's shop. It seemed to Susy that the boys were gone a long while, for it was Wednesday afternoon, and she was impatient for a ride. She sat down to practise a little, but her mind was out of doors, and the unwilling piano seemed crying out to be let alone.So saying, she produced from the depths of her pocket the fragments of the gilt-edged toy. They were past the healing power even of Spalding's glue, that was certain. At the painful sight, poor Susy's patience flew into as many pieces as the teapot.And, as it turned out, Dotty really did not deserve to be punished for wrong stories. She and Prudy had each assisted in breaking the teapot; one had knocked it off the bureau, and the other had stepped on it. But Dotty, who gloried in ""a fuss,"" had begged to be the one to tell Susy the startling news. She wished to see her eyes flash, and hear her expressions of surprise. She knew that, however angry Susy might be, there was one magical sentence which would always her to terms: ""Dotty'll go out doors, 'out her hat, get cold, have the _coop_, and DIE!""""O, Dotty Dimple, run into the house this very minute, please to,"" exclaimed Susy, ""and ask mother--if she's combing her hair, or _anything_--to come right out here as quick as she can run, and not wait! O, dear, dear, dear! Why, Dotty Dimple Parlin! you haven't started yet! Quick! quick! quick!""Dotty, who had only waited to be spoken to the second time, now ran in such haste that she stumbled on the piazza steps; but, nothing daunted, jumped up and went on, delighted to know that this time something had probably happened. She startled her mother, and called her away from her toilet, with the sudden cry that the boys and pony were 'most killed.At the same time she had the pleasure of throwing Prudy into a panic,--dear little Prudy, who had been for the last five minutes searching her treasures in the hope of finding some toy which would replace Susy's teapot.""_You_ tell,"" said Eddy to Charley; ""I _dassn't_. The blacksmith's man may be mad if I do. But he's abused this hoss, though,"" continued Eddy, not waiting to let Charley speak for him; ""he's abused him awfully! It's right up and down mean; and three of us boys seen him!"""
"""With his _boot_, sir,"" persisted Eddy, with increasing eloquence. ""Didn't I see him, me and Dan Murphy? Didn't we stand there by the coal-bin, sir? He booted him well, Mis' Parlin. I'll tell you where he did it; here on the left side, ma'am. Look where the hair sticks up! Pooty well mauled--ain't he, ma'am? Pete swore at him, too. Never heard such talk--did you, Charley?""""It is a most abusive thing--if it is so,"" said she, with much feeling; for if anything could move her gentle heart to anger, it was cruelty to animals. ""What made Mr. Grimes behave so strangely, boys? Was the pony restless?""It was well for Susy that her over-strained feelings now found vent in words and tears. ""There is no grief like the grief which does not speak."" Her dumb agony gave way, and she wept and raved like a little wild thing.Mrs. Parlin ordered the boys to lead the pony around to the back door, and there she washed out his wounds, trying all the while to soothe Susy, whose heart was beating a quick-step, and who trembled in every limb.""Old Grimes is dead, that good old man!"" repeated Prudy, with angry emphasis; ""but it wasn't _his_ father. No, indeed; with the old blue buttons down the back! Why, Peter is an awful man! I saw him once, and his face looked as if he'd been rubbing it on a pen-wiper! There, Susy, don't you cry,"" she added, applying a moral lesson to her sister's wounded feelings, like a healing plaster; ""he's dreadful wicked, and one of these days he'll get hurt his own self; a horse'll strike _him_!""""Mr. Grimes ought to be 'dited, and sent to the Reform School or State's Prison this very night,"" said she, in her wrath. Prudy thought precisely the same; also Miss Dimple, who looked upon the whole affair as a joke, intended for her amusement.When Mr. Parlin came home to tea, and heard the story, he did not blame Susy in the least for her indignation, but started off for the blacksmith's with the limping pony, saying he meant to ""inquire into the business.""Mr. Fox, and two or three other men, declared very positively that they had seen little Wings beating himself against the coal-box; and one of them pointed out to Mr. Parlin the blood-stain on the edge of the wood.""You can't trust much to what boys say, especially such harum-scarum fellows as Ed Johnson,"" added Mr. Fox. ""I shouldn't wonder, now, Grimes, if he and that Piper boy got their tempers up, and tried to spite you, for ordering them out of the shop. They were troublesome, and he had to speak sharp,"" added Mr. Fox, addressing Mr. Parlin again.""That's so!"" exclaimed Mr. Grimes. ""You take three little chaps, and have 'em meddling with your nails, and sticking scraps of iron into the coals, and it makes a man cross--or it frets _me_, and I told 'em to quit."""
"It was nearly time for vacation. As the children were to start on the next Monday for Willow-brook, their mother allowed them to spend their last Wednesday afternoon with their cousin Florence. It fell to Prudy's lot to dress her little sister.""O, I forgot all about that"" replied the little teacher, uneasily. ""Susy 'll be done practising in half an hour, and I thought I'd just have time to make my doll's boots,--finish them, I mean. Can't you wait till Saturday, Dotty?""""Now,"" said she, calling her school to order, ""you've learned as far as S, which I think is doing finely, all alone, with nobody to help us. This next letter stands, you see, for a _top_. What is it we drink out of cups?""Dotty eyed the letter sharply. ""Why, mamma drinks coffee sometimes, and it has grounds; but they don't look like that thing, the grounds don't! Why, that thing looks like a spade, with the teeth out, wrong side up.""These words from her beloved mother were most precious to Prudy. Dotty, though she did not know what was meant by patience and perseverance, presumed it was something fine, and laughed and danced in great glee.Nothing remarkable happened during the visit to Florence Eastman, except that Miss Dimple and Johnny were found running off the track of the upper railroad just one second after the engine started. Everybody was very much frightened when it was all safely over. But Dotty said,--The next Monday Mrs. Parlin and the three children started for Willow-brook. Dotty wished to take her sweet Pusheen and her darling Zip; but it was decided that Pusheen must stay at home, and help keep house.""No,"" said she, holding him firmly by both ears; ""Dotty'd be glad to let you get down, but she doesn't think it's best. You is only a doggie, and you'd get runned over and die. So now, Zippy, you'll have to give up, and it's no use to bark.""When Dotty was called to supper, she was found beside Pincher's green grave, telling her ""brother Zip"" the story of that dog's death, and trying to impress upon his mind the importance of keeping his paws out of fox-traps.It was delightful to be at grandma Parlin's once more. The summer-house, the seat in the tree, and the swing, were all in their old places, and had been waiting a whole year for the children. A few things had been added: a hennery,--called by Dotty ""a henpeckery""--and a graceful white boat, named the Water-Kelpie. This boat was kept chained to a stake on the bank, and no one could have a sail in it without first obtaining the key, which hung over the bird-cage, in the back parlor.Susy was charmed with the boat. It was lighter and nicer than the old canoe, which had so long been used by the family. She and Lonnie Adams, her aunt Martha's nephew, took daily lessons in rowing; but Susy, who had for years been accustomed to the water, knew how to manage a boat far better than did Master Lonnie. The boy strained every nerve, to very little purpose, while Susy would lightly dip in the paddle, and turn it with perfect ease."
"Not long after this praise from Abner, aunt Martha said that she and Master Lonnie were going over the river, after some wild-flower roots, and would be glad to have the boat sent for them at five o'clock.""I'll tell you how it is,"" said Susy, thoughtfully. ""That queer old Abner's nowhere to be seen. I suppose he's in the cornfield, or the meadow, or the barn. It's after five; and what will aunt Martha think? I could row across the river well enough by myself, if you'd only run home; you're _such_ a bother!""""Why, where's the paddles?"" said Susy. ""The men must have hid them. Dear me, I can't stop to hunt; and here it is five o'clock long ago! O, I'll take this good smooth shingle, I declare! I guess it washed ashore on purpose; it's almost equal to a paddle.--Now we'll go, all so nice,"" continued Susy, fearlessly dipping the chance-found shingle into the water.""Of course we're going!"" said Susy, proudly. ""What did you expect? I can do five times as well with a shingle as Lonnie can with a paddle. What do you suppose aunt Martha'll say? 'Bravo! those are smart children, to be rowing all alone, by themselves'!""""I see them,"" said Susy, steadily plying her shingle; ""but why don't you sit still? You'll tip us both over, as sure as this world; and if we get drowned I guess grandma'll scold! I shall be the one to have all the blame.""Dotty obeyed at once, and sat up quite straight, looking very sweet, and at the same time slightly acid, like a stick of lemon-candy. The Water Kelpie, now that Dotty was quiet, floated on, safely and surely, towards the opposite shore.It was a pretty picture--the white boat, the graceful children, and the still, blue water. Susy's fair arms were bared to the elbows, and her face was deeply flushed. Dotty's beautiful eyes danced, but she herself was motionless and demure.When they landed, Susy called aloud for her aunt Martha to come and secure the boat. Her voice echoed from afar, waking ""the sleep of the hills,"" but no aunt Martha appeared. The children clambered out at last, and Susy chained the boat to a stick, which she drove into the sand. But the sand was light, and the boat was heavy, and the current strong; so before the children had walked a dozen rods, the Water-Kelpie was floating down stream of its own free will."
"Thus it happened that although aunt Martha was certainly surprised, she did not seem very much pleased. She did not say, ""Bravo! my two nieces are smart children, to be rowing all alone by themselves."" Nothing of the sort. She reproved Susy for her rash conduct, and sent her and Lonnie around two miles, by the bridge, to ask Abner to come for them with the canoe.The runaway Water-Kelpie was caught a little way below the bridge, and Abner slyly laid by the dripping shingle, and afterwards showed it to everybody, as a proof that ""our Sue was an amazin' smart little water man."" There was to be a remarkable supper at grandma Parlin's, in honor of Colonel Augustus Allen, who was expected in the cars. There had been a grand excursion to welcome the soldiers, and the stage would probably be very late. Susy and Prudy had the promise of sitting up till it got in, if Dotty Dimple was only willing. But Dotty said,--""You shall have some to-morrow,"" said she, pausing to kiss Dotty, her favorite niece. Then she led the two little girls into the dining-room, where the long table was already spread for Company. Dotty could hardly keep her hands off the nice things.""There,"" said aunt Louise, giving each of the children an orange, ""now you may go. Abby, be sure to take good care of Dotty. Don't trust her out of your sight one minute.--Hark! there's the door-bell. You may go out of the house by the back-door.""Then Miss Louise hastened from the dining-room, without looking back to see whether the children obeyed her or not. Dotty was, in general, prompt to do as she was bidden by older people; but just now both the children found it hard to leave that tempting table. They dared not taste the dainties, but Abby thought it could surely do no harm just to touch them. But when they had gone as far as that, Abby, who was a sly, half-taught child, grew bolder, and a sudden impulse seized her to pocket a few sweetmeats, if she could only do so without being seen by Dotty's keen eyes.Then Abby's heart beat fast. She heard voices in the parlor, and knew that at any moment some one might enter the dining-room, and discover her. So making a hasty choice of two large pieces of jelly-cake, and half a dozen tarts, she swept out of the room just in time to escape meeting grandma Parlin.As Dotty's hair was now in fine order, the two children set out on their walk. They had gone but a few steps when Zip came trotting along, with all speed, looking up in their faces as if to say, ""What have I done, that I can't go too?""It was a long way to aunt Martha's, and Abby, besides feeling guilty, and ashamed of herself, was also very anxious to eat the goodies which made such a bunch in her pocket. Zip seemed to know there was cake somewhere, and sniffed about in a way which made her rather nervous.""But you must. You know, Dot Parling,"" said Abby, more gently, ""your grandma expects you to do just what I tell you. I'm afraid, dear, you won't get any of that bubbled cream if you don't mind, nor any tarts."""
"Dotty, too proud to cry, too angry to look back, wandered till she came to the edge of the Parlin woods. Here was a little creek, tumbling over some small gray rocks; the same ""creek"" where Horace had sometimes gone fishing.At first it seemed as if Abby were answering her; but the sound proved to be only the echo of Dotty's own voice. O, she might scream all the afternoon, and Abby wouldn't try to hear! O, dear; before anybody would come, a bear, or a wolf, or a whale might rush right out of the woods and eat her up! Then how Abby would cry! Abby's mother would whip her with a big stick, and say, ""there, now; what made you go behind the trees, and let that little Parlin girl lose herself, and get ate up! I don't think you're very polite, you naughty girl!""--O, how everybody would cry!But what was that little funny thing on the water? Forgetting her sudden fear of bears and whales, a fear which Abby herself had put into her little head, Dotty gazed at the ""funny thing."" Could it be a little truly sailboat? Yes, it certainly was. How it got into the creek Dotty never stopped to think; the question was, how could she get it out?She blew it with her breath, but it only floated farther away. She waited, hoping it would turn about, and come towards her. She threw sticks at it, but in vain. The boys, who had set it sailing had gone into the woods for raspberries, would have laughed to see her efforts. Presently she took off her hat, held it by one string, and flung it in, as if it had been a fishing-net. It was all of no use; the boat acted as if it were alive, and did not choose to be caught.When Dotty had made up her mind, she never stopped for trifles. She drew off her stockings and gaiters, and stepped into the creek. Boys waded in the water, why couldn't she? There was nothing to bite her! She wasn't afraid!She had supposed the water would only cover her feet, but she found herself sadly mistaken. The creek was remarkably deep, and, more than that, the bottom was so soft that she sank down, down, at every step.But there were no human ears near enough to hear her piteous cries. She must have drowned--there is no doubt of it--if Zip had not been close at hand. The moment he saw her sinking, he gave a low bark and swam after her."
"But the day ended gloriously for Dotty. She was handed about to be kissed by everybody, and was, after all, allowed to sit up till nine o'clock, and actually ate a ""bubbled cream,"" sitting as close as she could beside Colonel Allen's elbow. The next day Dotty had a severe cold, and her mother, fearing the croup, did not allow her to go out of doors. This was hard for the child. She felt very restless, because she had to give up ""housekeeping"" with Prudy, a very fascinating game, which could only be played on the river-bank. She looked out of the kitchen window, and saw some carpenters shingling the barn.She did not cry, for she had learned very young that crying is of no use; and it may be, too, that she had only a small fountain of tears back of her eyes. Prudy, entering the nursery in eager haste, for her ""bean-bags,"" was touched at sight of her sister's sad face.""There, now, I'll put back my bean-bags, and try to make her happy,"" said Prudy to herself. ""That will be following the Golden Rule; for it's doing unto Dotty as I want Susy to do unto me, when _I'm_ sick.""She went quietly up to Dotty, who still stood leaning gloomily against the lounge. The child turned around with a sudden smile. It cheered her to see Prudy's sweet face, which was always sunny with a halo of happy thoughts.""Yes, I are,"" replied Dotty, well pleased to be asked such a question. ""I got 'most drowned, you know. O, I wish you'd stayed out in the rain the other day, and got cold; then you'd have been sick, too.""Prudy smiled, for she knew that her little sister really had no such unkind wish at heart. She was only trying, with her limited stock of words, to say that she longed to have a little sympathy. It was not often that Dotty was willing to be pitied.Dotty's face beamed with joyous dimples. It was so pleasant to be generous, and at the same time keep the candy! In her short life Dotty Dimple had not quite learned that ""the half is better than the whole.""""You must say _doctor_, when you speak to me. Now, my dear patient, it's best for you to lie on the lounge, and take medicine in the chest. Poor young lady, we shall be so glad when you get your health all well!--Do you want me to extricate a tooth? Have you any headache, miss?""Prudy's voice was low and sympathetic. ""Yes, Dr. Prudy,"" replied the patient, with a stifled groan; ""I've truly got the ache in my head; it pricks through my hair."" ""I'll tell you the cause of that, my dear patient; I suspect your pillow's made of pin-feathers. Let me feel your pulse on the back of your hand--your wrist, I mean. Terrible,"" moaned the young doctor, gazing mournfully at the ceiling; ""it's stopped beating. Can't expect your life now. O, no!"""
"""If my memory preserves me right,"" continued the young doctor, pacing the floor, ""you've got the--ahem!--pluribus unum."" Here Dr. Prudy ran her fingers through her hair. ""But it goes light this year--with care, ma'am, you know. So I'll go and stir you up some pills in my marble mortar.""Prudy, with her grandmother's consent, carried in a pretty salver, on which were a little Wedgewood teapot with hot water, a tiny sugar-bowl and creamer, a plate, and cup and saucer, some slices of toast, and a glass of jelly.Dotty thought ""and so forth"" meant ""cups and saucers."" She had heard Norah tell Prudy, when she wished to set the table, that she might put on ""the knives and forks, and so forth,"" and Dotty had noticed that it was always cups and saucers after the knives and forks.Next sounded a furious peal of the bell, and a series of loud screams from the little sick girl. She had been dreadfully stung by a bee, which had buzzed its way out from the fireboard. Strange to tell, there was a swarm of bees in the chimney, instead of ""a spin-wheel.""""O, Dotty Parlin!"" cried Prudy, much distressed. ""Nobody ever talked to the dust-pan, in all the days of their lives! I always thought you were a good girl, Dotty, but now I am afraid you tell false fibs!""But about midnight there was a sudden alarm. Lights glanced here and there over the house, and Susy and Prudy were wakened from a deep sleep by the sound of voices. Dotty had a violent attack of croup.""Now just listen to me,"" returned Susy, pacing the floor of the green chamber, in her night-dress, while Prudy sat on the edge of the bed. ""God loves us all; but that's no sign we can't die! Little children, no older than Dotty, have their breath snatched right away, and are covered up in the ground, with gravestones at their heads and feet. O, you haven't the least idea, Prudy. You never think anything can happen!""""Sit still, Prudy, just as you are. The moon is shining into the window, on your tears, and it seems as if I could almost see a rainbow in your eyes!--There, it's gone now. What makes you talk so queer about God, Prudy? as if you knew a great deal more than I do?""""I don't know half as much as you do,"" replied Prudy; ""but I used to lie and think about the Saviour when I had the lameness.--Hark! Is that Dotty laughing? Let's go in and see if she isn't 'most well.""The child was indeed better; but for the next three nights she suffered from severe attacks of the croup. Her sisters had not known how they loved her till she showed her frail side, and they saw how slender was the thread which bound her to earth. When she was strong, and roguish, and wilful, they forgot that she was only a tender flower after all, and might be nipped from the stem any time."
"When she was well again, Prudy said to her mother, in confidence, ""It didn't kill her, the croup didn't, but it might have killed her; and I'm going to love her all the time as if she was really dead, and gone to heaven.""The entrance to the little palace was through a swinging door, of white cloth, and from the roof fluttered a small flag. There were four rooms in the house, all of them on the ground floor. The parlor was elegantly furnished with a braided carpet, of striped grass, a piano, whose black and white keys were put on with coal and chalk, not to mention other articles of luxury. The table was spread with acorn-cups and poppy teapots, the little housekeepers being advised not to make use of their china dishes for this establishment.There was a very black stove in the kitchen, but the most of the cooking was done out of doors, farther down the bank, in ovens shaped like swallows' nests. Here were baked delicious mud cakes, tempting currant tarts, and dainty custards.""He sent his _respects_ to mother, if that's what you mean; and in the same letter he said, 'Give oceans of love to Prudy.' As if it wasn't bad enough to break my heart, without trying to drown me,"" murmured Prudy, with dripping eyes.""Nobody, Dotty, as long as I live! I shall stay at home with my mother, and she'll be sitting in the rocking-chair, knitting, and father'll be sitting by the window, reading the paper.--But there,"" added she, ""aunt Madge might be married three or four times, and I wouldn't care. It's her going to New York that makes my heart ache so.""""The only trouble with lawyers, Dotty, is, that they can't write so you can read it. My father told me so. He said their writing was like turkey's tracks. He said it looked as if a fly had got into the inkstand, and crawled over the paper.""""But,"" continued he, very gravely, ""it may be his mother might object to my giving him away. I don't know why it is, but she seems to value him very highly. She would expect some money for him, I think. How much are you willing to pay?""Dotty reflected. She possessed several dollies, a new tea-set, a box of picture-books, and a red morocco ball. But what would Dr. Gray care for these, or her various other toys? All her money was contained in her portemonnaie, the money which she had meant should put a stop to her aunt Madge's dreadful marriage. Should she save her auntie, and give up the baby? Or should she buy the baby, and leave her auntie to her fate?Unfortunately there was a fireplace in the room, and Dotty's keen eyes at once espied the tongs, leaning against a brass rester. As quick as a thought she seized them, and laid them in the cradle beside the baby. They were half an inch shorter than Phil--even the doctor was obliged to confess it.For three days the expectant child was kept in suspense by mirthful Dr. Gray, who pretended that he should bring the baby to her some time when she did not expect it. She often rushed into the parlor, saying, ""O, I thought I heard somethin' cryin';"" and almost cried herself because there was no baby there. ""I wish I could stop expecting my brother,"" said Dotty, sorrowfully, ""for then he might come."""
"""I don't know,"" replied the older sister, hesitating. ""Dr. Gray is a real good man. I don't believe he meant to cheat. Father wears paper collars sometimes, and makes believe they are linen; but then, you know, _father_ wouldn't cheat! Dr. Gray was only joking. The trouble is, Dotty is too little to understand jokes. Dr. Gray didn't mean to break his word.""""Possibly the minister may have,"" said Colonel Allen, laughing. ""You wait till this evening, and very likely he may be here. Then you can go up to him and say, 'Please, Mr. Hayden, will you sell me an uncle?'""Something was going on which was called _a wedding_; though what a wedding might be, Miss Dimple had no idea, having never attended one in all her life. But it was something remarkable, no doubt, for the parlors ware glowing with flowers, and everybody was in a flutter. The three children, dressed in their very best, were allowed to sit up for the whole evening, or, at any rate, as long as they pleased.""Do look at that great moon dripping down the juniper tree,"" cried Prudy, growing poetical as she gazed. ""Let me tell you, Susy, when the moon is young and little, it makes me think of a smile, and when it's a grown-up, full moon, it makes me think of a laugh.""Just as Dotty was beginning to wonder whether she felt sleepy or not, the door-bell rang; and after that it kept ringing every few minutes for an hour. By that time the fragrant parlors were almost filled with guests. Everybody had a few kind words for the children, and Prudy listened and answered with timid blushes: but Dotty Dimple was, as usual, very fearless, and perfectly at ease.Mr. Hayden said he certainly had, and laughed when he spoke, though Dotty could not imagine why. Dr. Gray took her up in his arms, and declared he would like to carry her home in his pocket. Such an idea! And Dr. Gray was the man who had cheated her! When he set her down again she stood on her dignity, and carried her head like a queen.She had hardly crossed the room, and taken her station beside Prudy, when a hush fell upon the company. Dotty was inclined to think people had paused in conversation to watch _her_. Colonel Allen and aunt Madge were standing together, and Mr. Hayden in front of them. The guests were looking at _them_, not at Miss Dotty Dimple!Mr. Hayden began to talk very solemnly--almost like preaching. No one else spoke; no one smiled. Before Dotty could ask what they were doing, Mr. Hayden was praying; and after the prayer, which was so hearty and simple that Dotty could almost understand it, the whole room was in motion again. Everybody seemed suddenly bent on kissing aunt Madge, though what that young lady had been doing which was better than usual Dotty could not exactly make out. But this, she concluded, was in some way connected with the entertainment called _a wedding_."
