passage
"A lit-tle girl Read in her book, How a wick-ed boy A wild bird took From out its nest In the green-wood tree A cap-tive now 'Tis forced to be, And flutters its poor wings all day long, And beats the bars of its cage so strong. ""Poor lit-tle bird!"" She soft-ly cried; Then on her head Her hood she tied, Took down the cage Of her own bird, Opened the door, With joy-ous word. ""Fly, lit-tle bird, a-way,"" quoth she, Back to your home in the green-wood tree. A-way, a-way, The glad bird flew, Far out of sight, In heav-ens blue. The wee girl watched With won-der-ing eye, Till it had fad-ed In the sky, Then sat her down, and cried, ""Boo-hoo! My bird is gone! What shall I do?"" Her pin-a-fore With tears was wet: ""My bird a-gain, I'll nev-er get."" At last she raised Her weep-ing eye, And there at hand, What should she spy But bird-ie hop-ping in his door, Tired of his free-dom, back once more. One day, all in the sweet spring weather, Two lit-tle folk went out to-geth-er. Oh the bright May-day! Sun was shining, birds were sing-ing, Flow-ers bloom-ing, May-bells ring-ing! Oh the glad May-day! So they two went forth a May-ing, Laugh-ing, dan-cing, sing-ing, say-ing ""Oh the bright May-day! What care we for moth-er's warn-ing? Who would bide at home this morn-ing? Oh the glad May-day!"" ""Oh, dear! On, dear! 'Tis al-most nine. The birds all sing, The sun does shine. Poor Doll and I To school must go: I don't see why, We hate it so. I hate those let-ters. They twist and turn. There's no use try-ing: I'll nev-er learn. ""Hur-rah! hur-rah! At last it's two! I am so glad! What shall we do? Come, Doll, let's run. I'll nev-er go, When I get big, To school, I know; But ev-er-y min-ute of the day I'll spend just as I like, in play."""
