passage
"It was about the middle of November. There had been a long rain storm, ending in sleet and snow, and now the sun was shining brightly on a landscape sheeted with ice: walks and roads were slippery with it, every tree and shrub was encased in it, and glittering and sparkling as if loaded with diamonds, as its branches swayed and tossed in the wind. At Ion Mrs. Elsie Travilla stood at the window of her dressing-room gazing with delighted eyes upon the lovely scene.At that very time Capt. Raymond and Violet in her boudoir at Woodburn, were also discussing the state of the roads and the advisability of dispensing with school duties for the day that all the family might enjoy the rather rare treat of a sleigh-ride.""We will go,"" he said, smiling fondly upon her, ""I can not bear to have you miss the pleasure; nor the children either for that matter, though I am a little afraid I might justly be deemed weakly indulgent in according them a holiday again so soon: it is against my principles to allow lessons to be set aside for other than very weighty reasons; it is a matter of so great importance that they be trained to put duties first, giving pleasure a secondary place.""""And they have been so closely confined to the house of late, by the inclemency of the weather,"" he added. ""Yes: they shall go; for it will do them a great deal of good physically, I think, and health is, after all, of more consequence for them than rapid advancement in their studies.""""It is a trifle odd that the same idea had just occurred to me,"" he remarked pleasantly. ""I will telephone at once to the town, and if I can engage a suitable sleigh, will call to Ion and give our invitation.""""I think I could, papa, if--if you'd only let me try. But oh don't look troubled, for indeed, indeed, I'm not going to be naughty about it, though I have been shut up in the house for so long, except just riding in the close carriage to church yesterday.""""And that must not be; we will all go, and I trust will have a very pleasant time,"" the captain said, rising and taking a hand of each to lead them down to the breakfast-room, for the bell was ringing.At Ion the family were gathering about the table to partake of their morning meal. Walter waited rather impatiently till the blessing had been asked, then, with an entreating look at his mother, said, ""Mamma, you know what you promised?""""Something that Walter will be glad to hear, I make no doubt,"" remarked Mr. Dinsmore, giving the child a kindly look and smile. ""Capt. Raymond and I have had a little chat through the telephone this morning. He invites us all to join the Woodburn family in a sleigh-ride, he is coming for us in an omnibus sleigh; and I accepted for each and every one of you.""""Surely, papa, the gentlemen also should have a voice in that,"" his daughter said, sending him a bright, affectionate look from behind the coffee-urn, ""you at least, in case the question is put to vote.""""I think it will prove fine on all the roads,"" remarked Edward, ""and I presume everybody, would enjoy driving over to Fairview, the Laurels and the Oaks to call on our nearest relatives; perhaps to the Pines and Roselands also, to see the cousins there.""Everybody was interested, and presently all were gathered about the telephone, while Edward, acting as spokesman of the party, called to first one and then another of the households nearly related to themselves.The answers came promptly, and it was soon evident that all were intending to avail themselves of the somewhat rare opportunity offered by the snow and ice covered roads, none planning to stay at home to receive calls. They would all visit Ion if the ladies there were likely to be in.The Woodburn party arrived in high spirits, a sleigh, containing the Fairview family, driving up at the same time. They had room for one more and wanted ""mamma"" to occupy it; but the captain and Violet would not resign their claim, and Evelyn and Lulu showed a strong desire to be together; so the former was transferred to the Woodburn sleigh, and Zoe and Edward took the vacant seats in that from Fairview.The two vehicles kept near together, their occupants, the children especially, were very gay and lively. They talked of last year's holiday sports, and indulged in pleasing anticipations in regard to what might be in store for them in those now drawing near.""It is Rosie's turn this year,"" remarked Grandma Elsie; ""Rosie's and Walter's and mine. I want all the young people of the connection--and as many of the older ones as we can make room for--to come to Ion for the Christmas holidays, or at least the greater part of them; we will settle particulars as to the time of coming and going, later on. Captain, I want you and Violet and all your children for the whole time."""
"""I am glad you are all pleased with the idea,"" she said. ""We will try to provide as great a variety of amusements as possible, and shall be glad of any hints or suggestions from old or young in regard to anything new in that line.""""The Oaks, and the Roselands folks,"" answered Max, and as he spoke two large sleighs came swiftly up in the rear of their own, their occupants calling out merry greetings, and receiving a return in kind.The wind had fallen, the cold was not intense, and they were so well protected against it by coats and robes of fur, that they scarcely felt it, and found the ride so thoroughly enjoyable that they kept it up through the whole morning, managing their return so that Ion was reached only a few minutes before the dinner hour.Ion was a sort of headquarters for the entire connection, and everybody seemed to feel perfectly at home. Grandma Elsie was a most hospitable hostess, and it was a very cheerful, jovial party that surrounded her well-spread table that day.The girls were together in a small reception-room, chatting about such matters as particularly interested them--their studies, sports, plans for the purchase or making of Christmas gifts, and what they hoped or desired to receive. ""I want jewelry,"" said Sidney Dinsmore. ""I'd rather have that than anything else. But it must be handsome: a diamond pin or ring, or ear-rings.""Lulu looked much surprised. ""Papa never talks of how much money he has,"" she said, ""and I never supposed it was more than about enough to keep us comfortable; but millions means a great deal doesn't it?""""I join in both wishes,"" said Evelyn Leland, ""and hope everyone of you will receive a Christmas gift quite to her mind: but, oh girls, don't you think it would be nice to give a good time to the poor people about us?""""I mean both the whites and the blacks,"" explained Evelyn. ""There are those Jones children that live not far from Woodburn, for instance: their mother's dead and the father gets drunk and beats and abuses them, and altogether I'm sure they are very, very forlorn.""""Oh yes,"" cried Lulu, ""it would be just splendid to give them a good time!--nice things to eat and to wear, and toys too. I'll talk to papa about it, and he'll tell us what to give them and how to give it.""""And there are a number of other families in the neighborhood probably quite as poor and forlorn,"" said Lora Howard. ""Oh I think it would be delightful to get them all together somewhere and surprise them with a Christmas tree loaded with nice things! Lets do it, girls. We all have some pocket money, and we can get our fathers and mothers to tell us how to use it to the best advantage, and how to manage the giving.""""It's nice, and right too, I think, to give tokens of love to our dear ones,"" Evelyn said, ""but we need not make them very expensive in order to give pleasure;--often they would prefer some simple little thing that is the work of our own hands--and so we would have something left for the poor and needy, whom the Bible teaches us we should care for and relieve to the best of our ability."" In the parlor the older people were conversing on somewhat similar topics: first discussing plans for the entertainment and gratification of their children and other young relatives, during the approaching holidays, then of the needs of the poor of the neighborhood, and how to supply them; after that they talked of the claims of Home and Foreign Missions; the perils threatening their country from illiteracy, anarchy, heathenism, Mormonism, Popery, Infidelity, etc., not omitting the danger from vast wealth accumulating in the hands of individuals and corporations; also they spoke of the heavy responsibility entailed by its possession.They were patriots and Christians; anxious first of all for the advancement of Christ's kingdom upon earth, secondly for the welfare and prosperity of the dear land of their birth--the glorious old Union transmitted to us by our revolutionary fathers.They acknowledged themselves stewards of God's bounty, and as such desired to be found faithful; neglecting neither the work nearest at hand nor that in far distant lands where the people sit in great darkness and the region and shadow of death, that on them the ""Sun of righteousness might arise with healing in his wings.""It had been expected that the guests would stay at Ion till bedtime, but a thaw had set in and ice and snow were fast disappearing from the roads; therefore all departed for their homes directly after an early tea.An excellent opportunity for a private chat with him was afforded her shortly after their arrival at home. The little ones were fretful and Violet went to the nursery with them; Max hastened to his own room to finish a composition he was expected to hand to his father the next morning, Gracie, weary with the excitement of the day, and the long morning drive, went directly to her bed, and having seen her in it, and left her there with a loving good night, the captain and Lulu presently found themselves the only occupants of the library.""Yes,"" he said gravely, ""it has been something of a loss to you in one way, but I trust a decided gain in another. Well to change the subject, are you pleased with the prospect of spending the holidays at Ion?"""
"""Rich?"" he repeated, coming suddenly out of his reverie and looking smilingly down into her eyes, ""yes; I have a sound constitution, excellent health, a delightful home, a wife and five children, each one of whom I esteem worth at least a million to me; I live in a Christian land,"" he went on in a graver tone, ""I have the Bible with all its great and precious promises, the hope of a blessed eternity at God's right hand, and that all my dear ones are traveling heavenward with me; yes, I am a very rich man!""""Papa, I'm almost ashamed to tell you,"" she said, blushing and hanging her head; ""but if I do, and you can't afford it, won't you please say so and not feel sorry about it? because I wouldn't ever want you to spend money on me that you need for yourself or some of the others.""""I am glad you are thoughtful for others as well as yourself, daughter,"" he said kindly; ""but don't hesitate to tell me all that is in your heart. Nothing pleases me better than to have you, and all my dear children do so.""""Thank you, my dear, dear papa. I don't mean ever to hide anything from you,"" she returned, giving him another hug and kiss, while her eyes sparkled and her cheek flushed with pleasure. ""It's a diamond ring I'd like to have.""""Wear it, papa. Maud Dinsmore has such beautiful one, that a rich aunt sent her the other day,"" she went on eagerly; ""there's a large diamond in the middle and little ones all round it, and it sparkles so, and looks just lovely on her hand! We all admired it ever so much, and I said I'd be wild with delight if I had such an one; then Sydney said, 'Why not give your father a hint that you'd like one for Christmas?' and I said I was afraid you couldn't afford to give me anything that would cost so much; but Maud said I needn't be, for you were worth millions of money. Can you really afford to give it to me, papa? I'd like it better than anything else if you can, but if you can't I don't want it,"" she concluded with a sigh, and creeping closer into his embrace.""If I thought it would really be for my little girl's welfare and happiness in the end,"" he said, ""I should not hesitate for a moment to gratify her in this wish of hers, but, daughter, the ornament you covet would be extremely unsuitable for one of your years, and I fear its possession would foster a love of finery that I do not wish to cultivate in you, because it is not right, and would hinder you in the race I trust you are running for the prize of eternal life.""'If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.' God has entrusted me with a good deal of money, but I hold it as his steward, and 'it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.'""""That I must use the Lord's money to do his work, daughter; a great deal of money is needed to help on the advancement of his cause and kingdom in the hearts of individuals, and in the world at large. There are millions of poor creatures in heathen lands who have never so much as heard of Jesus and his dying love; and even in our own favored country there are thousands who are sunk in poverty, ignorance and wretchedness. Money is needed to feed and clothe them, to send them teachers and preachers, and to build churches, schools, and colleges, where they can be educated and fitted for happiness and usefulness.""Suppose I had a thousand, or five thousand dollars, to spare after supplying my family with all that is necessary for health, comfort and happiness; could my dear eldest daughter be so selfish as to wish me to put it into a diamond ring for her at the expense of leaving some poor creature in want and misery? some poor heathen to die without the knowledge of Christ? some soul to be lost that Jesus died to save?""""I will,"" he said; ""I have some thousands to divide among the various religious and benevolent objects, and shall give a certain sum--perhaps as much as a thousand dollars--in the name of each of my three children who are old enough to understand these things, letting each of you select the cause, or causes, to which his or her share is to go.""""There are Home and Foreign Missions, the work among the freedmen, and for the destitute in our own neighborhood, beside very many others. We will read about these various objects and talk the matter over together, and finally decide how many we can help, and how much shall be given to each. Perhaps you may choose to support a little Indian girl in one of the Mission schools, or some child in heathen lands; or a missionary who will go and teach them the way to heaven.""""Oh I should love to do that!"" she exclaimed, ""it will be better than having a ring. Papa, how good you are to me! I am so glad God gave me such a father; one who tries always to teach me how to serve Him and to help me to be the right kind of a Christian."""
"Just then Max came into the room, and his father called him to take a seat by his side, saying, ""I am glad you have come, my son, for I was about to speak to Lulu on a subject that concerns you quite as nearly.""The captain went on. ""The Bible tells us, 'If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.' If we are like Jesus in spirit, we will love others and be ready to deny ourselves to do them good; especially to save their souls; for to that end he denied himself even to the shameful and painful death of the cross.""That is we cannot be his disciples without doing something to bring sinners to him that they may be saved; something that will cost us self-denial; it may be of our own ease, or of something we would like to do or have.""You have some money of your own every week; you can give what you will of that to held spread abroad the glad tidings of salvation; you can pray for others, and when a favorable opportunity offers, speak a word to lead them to Christ. Ask God to show you opportunities and give you grace and wisdom to use them. Try also, so to live, and act, and speak, that all who see and know you will, take knowledge of you that you have been with Jesus and learned of him.""""But you will understand, children,"" the captain said, ""that this involves your gaining a great deal of information on the subject of missions, and other schemes of benevolence, and in order to help you in that, we will spend a short time each evening, when not prevented by company or some more important engagement, in reading and conversing on this topic.""""And I have another offer to make you both,"" said the captain; ""for every day that I find you obedient, pleasant-tempered and industrious I will give each of you twenty-five cents for benevolent purposes.""""Certainly, my son; your pocket money is your own, to use for your pleasure or profit, except what you feel that you ought, or desire to give of it; but the quarter is expressly, and only for benevolent purposes.""""I hope it will be cold enough at Christmas time to make ice and snow for sleighing and sledding,"" Max remarked; ""for we boys have planned to have a good deal of fun for ourselves and the girls too, if it is.""""My dear, you seem to me a very wise and kind father,"" Violet remarked to her husband when they found themselves alone together, after Max and Lulu had gone to their beds. ""I very highly approve of the plans you have just proposed for them. Though, of course the approval of a silly young thing, such as I, must be a matter of small consequence,"" she added, with a merry, laughing look up into his face.""Young, but not silly,"" he returned, with a very lover-like look and smile. ""I consider my wife's judgment worth a great deal, and am highly gratified with her approval. I am extremely desirous,"" he went on more gravely, ""to train my darlings to systematic benevolence, a willingness to deny themselves for the cause of Christ, and to take an interest in every branch of the work of the church."" Lulu's first thought on awaking the next morning, was of the talk of the previous evening, with her father. He had said she might have the pleasure of telling Gracie the good news in regard to the money to be earned by good conduct, and that which was to be given by him in the name of each of his older children; also the privilege he would accord them of selecting the particular cause, or causes, to which the money should go.Eager to avail herself of the permission, and see Gracie's delight, she sprang from her bed, ran to the door of communication between their sleeping rooms, which generally stood open--always at night--and peeped cautiously in.Gracie's head was still on her pillow, but at that instant she stirred, opened her eyes, and called out in a pleased tone, ""O Lu, so you are up first!"" speaking softly though, for fear of disturbing their father and Violet, in the room beyond, the door there being open also.Lulu hurried to it and closed it gently, then turning toward her sister, ""Yes,"" she said, ""but it's early, and you needn't get up just yet. I'm coming to creep in with you for a few minutes while I tell you something that I'm sure will please you.""She crept into Grace's bed as she spoke, and they lay for a while clasped in each other's arms, Lulu talking very fast, Grace listening and now and then putting in a word or two. She was quite as much pleased with what Lulu had to tell, as the latter had anticipated.""Oh won't it be just lovely to have so much money to do good with!"" she exclaimed when all had been told. ""Haven't we got the very best and dearest father in the world? I don't believe, Lu, there's another one half so dear and kind and nice. We ought to be ever such good children!"""
"""You are; at any rate you're a great deal better than I am,"" asserted Lulu with warmth. ""You never disobey papa, or get into a passion; and I don't think you love finery as I do. Gracie, I want that ring yet; oh I should like to have it ever so much! and I oughtn't to want it; it's very selfish, because to buy it would use up money that ought to go to send missionaries to the heathen, or do good to some poor miserable creature; and it's wrong for me to want it, because papa says it wouldn't be good for me; and if I were as good as I ought to be I'd never want anything he doesn't think best for me to have. But, oh dear, how can I help it when I'm so fond of pretty things!""""Lu,"" said Grace, softly, ""I do believe that if you ask the Lord Jesus to help you to quit wanting it, he will. But if you didn't care for it, it wouldn't be denying yourself to do without it for the sake of the heathen.""With that Lulu slipped from the bed, ran back to her room, and kneeling down there, gave thanks for the sleep of the past night, for health and strength, a good home, her dear, kind father to take care of, and provide for her, and love her, and all her many, many comforts and blessings; and confessing her sins, she asked to be forgiven for Jesus' sake, and to have strength given her to do all her duty that day,--to be patient, obedient, industrious, kind and helpful to others and willing to deny herself, especially in the matter of the ring she had been wishing for so ardently.""Yes, indeed!"" said Grace, ""and I'm ever so glad of what Lu's been telling me 'bout the money you are going to give us if we're good, and the choosing 'bout where the other shall go that you're going to give to help send missionaries to the heathen. Thank you for both, dear papa; but don't you think we ought to be good without being paid for it?""""Yes, I certainly do, my dear little girl; but at the same time I want my children to have the luxury of being able to give something which they have, in some sense, earned for that purpose. I want you to learn in your own experience the truth of the words of the Lord Jesus, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'""Now while you are so young, not capable of earning much in any other way, your proper business the task of gaining knowledge and skill to fit you for future usefulness, I see no more fitting way than this for you to be furnished with money for religious and benevolent purposes.""""I do not think it my business to judge in such matters for everybody,"" he answered, caressing her and smiling down tenderly into her eyes; ""but I must judge for myself--applying the rules the Bible gives me--and to a great extent for my children also while they are so young.""""She has a great deal of beautiful jewelry,"" remarked Lulu with an involuntary sigh, ""and Grandma Elsie has still more. Rosie asked her once to show it to us children, and she did. Oh she has just the loveliest rings and whole sets of jewelry--pins and ear-rings to match--and chains and bracelets! I'm sure they must be worth a great deal of money; Rosie said they were, and I'm sure Grandma Elsie is a real true Christian--a very, very good one and that Mamma Vi is too.""""And I agree with you in that,"" was the emphatic reply. ""But my daughter and I have nothing to do with deciding their duty for them in regard to this or other things. God does not require that of us; indeed forbids it; 'Judge not, that ye be not judged,' Jesus said.""But I see plainly that my duty is as I explained it to you last evening, and I thought then you were convinced that it would be selfish and wrong for you and me to spend a large sum for useless ornament that might otherwise be used for the good of our fellow creatures, and the advancement of Christ's kingdom.""""A good plan will be to fill your thoughts with other things,"" he went on; ""your lessons while in the school-room, after that you may find it pleasant to begin planning for Christmas gifts to be made or bought for those you love, and others whom you would like to help. I shall give each of you--including Max--as much extra spending money as I did last year.""""Yes; what I provide you with for benevolence, is something aside from your spending money, which you are at liberty to do with as you please, within certain bounds,"" he said rising and taking a hand of each as the breakfast bell sounded out its summons to the morning meal.Misconduct and poor recitations were alike very rare in the school-room at Woodburn; neither found a place there to-day, so that the captain had only commendations to bestow, and they were heartily and gladly given.The ice and snow had entirely disappeared, and the roads were muddy; too muddy, it was thought, to make travel over them particularly agreeable; but the children obtained sufficient exercise in romping over the wide porches and trotting round the grounds on their ponies.But in spite of the bad condition of the roads, the Ion carriage drove over early in the afternoon, and Grandma Elsie, Mrs. Elsie Leland--her namesake daughter--Rosie and Evelyn alighted from it. Everybody was delighted to see them, and to hear that they would stay to tea."
"""I think it's nice, too,"" Rosie said, ""and I'd like mamma or grandpa to do the same by me. But I'd want my pearls too,"" she added, laughing. ""Mamma's rich enough to give me them, and do all she need do for missions and the poor beside.""""I've read in some of the religious papers, that if every church member would give but a small sum yearly, there would be enough,"" said Rosie; ""and mamma gives hundreds and thousands of dollars; and grandpa gives a great deal too. So I don't see that I ought to do without the set of pearls I've set my heart on. It isn't mamma's place to do other people's duty for them--in the way of giving, any more than in other things.""""Thank you, mamma; I am always glad to hear what they write; their letters are never dull or uninteresting,"" Violet replied, her sister Elsie adding, ""They are always worth hearing, Lester and I think. What dear boys they are!""""They are a great blessing and comfort to their mother,"" Grandma Elsie remarked, ""as indeed all my children are--their letters always a source of pleasure, but these even more so than most; for they show that my college boys are greatly stirred up on the subject of missions at home and abroad; full of renewed zeal for the advancement of the Master's cause and kingdom.""They were working as teachers in a mission Sunday school, as Bible readers and tract distributors among the poor and degraded of the city where they were sojourning; doing good to bodies as well as souls--their mother supplying them with means for that purpose in addition to what she allowed them for pocket-money;--also exerting an influence for good among their fellow students.They told of interesting meetings held for prayer and conference upon the things concerning the kingdom; of renewed and higher consecration on the part of many who were already numbered among the Master's followers, and the conversion of others who had hitherto cared for none of these things.The reading of the letters was followed by an earnest talk between the mother and her daughters, in which Violet told of her husband's plans for giving through his children, in addition to what he would give in other ways.""I want you to have the pleasure,"" her mother answered, ""and I am reserving much the larger part of what I have to give, for objects of my own selection; for it has pleased the Lord to trust me with the stewardship of a good deal of the gold and silver which are his.""At that moment the little girls entered the room, and Rosie, hurrying up to her mother, asked, ""Mamma, have you heard, has Vi told you what the captain intends doing? how he is going to reward his children for good behavior?""""And I intend to follow the captain's lead in another matter,"" Grandma Elsie went on, smiling pleasantly upon her young daughter; ""That is in allowing each of my sons and daughters to select some good object for me to give to.""""That's nice too,"" commented Rosie: ""I like to be trusted in such things--as well as others,"" she added laughing, ""and I hope you'll trust me with quite a sum of money to give or spend just as I please!""""Ah, my darling, you must not forget that your mother is only a steward,"" was the sweet toned response, given between a smile and a sigh; for Grandma Elsie was not free from anxiety about this youngest daughter, who had some serious faults, and had not yet entered the service of the Lord Jesus Christ.Evelyn flushed with pleasure; but more because of the loving look than the promise of reward. ""Dear Grandma Elsie, how very kind and good you always are to me!"" she exclaimed feelingly, her eyes filling with tears of love and gratitude.""Dear child, whatever I have done for you has always been both a duty and a pleasure,"" Mrs. Travilla returned, taking the hand of the little girl, who was standing by her side, and pressing; it affectionately in her own.""I certainly should be astonished, Eva,"" laughed her Aunt Elsie. ""I am quite sure it would be only under great provocation that you would be guilty of very bad behavior; and equally certain that you will never find that at Ion.""""And you are so sweet-tempered that you would never fly into a passion if you were treated ever so badly,"" remarked Lulu, with an admiring, appreciative look at her friend, accompanied by a regretful sigh over her own infirmity of temper.""Perhaps my faults lie in another direction; and how much credit do people deserve for refraining from doing what they feel no temptation to do?"" said Evelyn, with an arch look and smile directed toward Lulu.""And those that tease quick tempered people, and make them angry, deserve at least half the blame,"" Rosie said softly in Lulu's ear, putting an arm affectionately about her as she spoke. ""I don't mean to do so ever again, Lu, dear.""They clustered about him, Grace on his knee, Lulu on one side, Max on the other, while their tongues ran fast on whatever subject happened to be uppermost in their thoughts, the captain encouraging them to talk freely; for he was most desirous to have their entire confidence in order that he might be the better able to correct wrong ideas and impressions, inculcate right views and motives, and lead them to tread the paths of rectitude, living noble, unselfish lives, serving God and doing good to their fellow creatures."
"Sensible questions were sure to be patiently answered, requests carefully considered, and granted if reasonable and within his power; and instruction was given in a way to make it interesting and agreeable; reproof, if called for, administered in a kind, fatherly manner that robbed it of its sting.They talked of their sports, their pets, the books they were reading, the coming holidays, the enjoyment they were looking forward to at that time, and their plans for helping to make it a happy time to others.""Perhaps I can help you with your plans,"" said their father. ""I think it would be well to make out a list of those to whom you wish to give, and then decide what amount to devote to each, and what sort of thing would be likely to prove acceptable, yet not cost more than you have set apart for its purchase.""That part of the work required no little consultation between the three children; papa's advice was asked in every instance, and almost always decided the question; but, glancing over the lists when completed, ""I think, my dears, you have laid out too much work for yourselves,"" he said.""Don't you know that's what fathers are for?"" he said, smiling down on her. ""My children were given me to be taken care of, provided for, loved and trained up aright. A precious charge!"" he added, looking from one to another with glistening eyes.""Oh may it?"" she exclaimed. ""I'm glad of that! Papa, I--haven't liked Dick very much since he chopped up the cradle I'd carved for Gracie's dolls, but I believe I want to give him a Christmas present; it will help me to forgive him and like him better. But I don't know what would please him best.""""A book with bright pictures and short stories told very simply in words of one or two syllables. Dick is going to school and learning to read, and I think such a gift would be both enjoyable and useful to him.""""And so have I,"" said Lulu, hanging her head and blushing, ""only sometimes I've forgotten it for a while. But I hope I won't any more, dear papa,"" she added softly, with a penitent, beseeching look up into his face.""I intend to do so,"" his father said. ""Judging from the length of your lists, I think we will have to take several trips to accomplish it all. So we will make a beginning before long, when the weather has become settled; perhaps the first pleasant day of next week, if you have all been good and industrious about your lessons."" The parlor at Ion, full of light and warmth, looked very pleasant and inviting this evening. The whole family--not so large now as it had been before Capt. Raymond took his wife and children to a home of their own--were gathered there;--Mr. Dinsmore and his wife--generally called Grandma Rose by the children--Grandma Elsie, her son Edward and his wife, Zoe, and the two younger children;--Rosie and Walter.""You know mamma always gives thousands of dollars every year to home and foreign missions, and other good causes, and she says that this time she will let each of us choose a cause for her to give a thousand to.""""I like that!"" exclaimed Zoe. ""Many thanks, mamma, for my share of the privilege. I shall choose to have my thousand go to help the mission schools in Utah. I feel so sorry for those poor Mormon women. The idea of having to share your husband with another woman, or maybe half a dozen or more! It's simply awful!"""
"""Yes; and that is only a small part of the wickedness Mormonism is responsible for,"" remarked Grandma Rose. ""Think of the tyranny of their priesthood; interfering with the liberty of the people in every possible way--claiming the right to dictate as to what they shall read, where they shall send their children to school, with whom they shall trade, where they shall live, or ordering them to break up their homes, make a forced sale of their property, and move into another state or territory at their own cost, or go on a mission.""""And the bitter hatred they inculcate toward the people and government of these United States,"" added Zoe. ""Oh I am sure both love of country and desire for the advancement of Christ's cause and kingdom, should lead us to do all we can to rescue Utah from Mormonism. Do you not think so, mamma?""""And there is another race to whom we owe reparation,"" remarked Mr. Dinsmore, leaning back in his chair, and regarding the chess-board with a half rueful look. ""There, Ned, my boy, I think you wouldn't have come off victor if my attention had not been called from the game by the talk of the ladies.""""You all know, of course, that I refer to the negroes, who were forcibly torn from their own land and enslaved in this. We must educate and evangelize them: as a debt we owe them, and also for the salvation of our country, whose liberties will be greatly imperilled by their presence and possession of the elective franchise, if they are left to ignorance and vice.""""And besides,"" said Rosie, ""mamma is going to give us young ones a chance to earn money for benevolence by paying us for good behavior. I know we ought to be good without other reward than that of a good conscience, but I'm quite delighted with the plan for all that.""""Yes, sir; and not original. I learned at Woodburn to-day, that the captain was going to try the plan with his children. I trust it meets your approval? I might better have consulted with you before announcing my intention to adopt it.""""Talking of helping the blacks, and thinking of the advice so often given, 'Do the work nearest at hand,' it strikes me it would be well for us to begin with those in our own house and on the plantation,"" remarked Edward.""I think they have never been neglected, Edward,"" said his grandfather; ""a school-house was provided for them years ago, your mother pays a teacher to instruct them, visits the school frequently, often gives religious instruction herself to the pupils there, and to their parents in visiting them in their cabins; sees that they are taken care of in sickness too, and that they do not suffer for the necessaries of life at any time.""""Yes, sir, that is all true,"" returned Edward, ""but I was only thinking of giving them some extra care, instruction and gifts during the approaching holidays; says a Christmas tree loaded with, not the substantials of life only, but some of the things that will give pleasure merely--finery for the women and girls, toys for the children and so forth.""""O mamma, let us do it!"" cried Rosie with enthusiasm; ""let's have a fine big tree in their school-room, and have them come there and get their gifts before we have ours here. We should get Vi and the captain to join us in it as the colored children from Woodburn attend school there too.""""I am well pleased with the idea,"" replied her mother, ""and have little doubt that the captain and Vi will be also. But let us have your opinion, my dear father,"" she added, turning upon him a look of mingled love and reverence.""It coincides with yours, daughter,"" Mr. Dinsmore answered. ""And I move that Ned' and Zoe be appointed a committee to find out the needs of the proposed recipients of our bounty; others being permitted to assist if they like.""""Thanks, a thousand thanks, my fair kinswoman, my bonny leddy, my sweet Cousin Elsie,"" returned the old gentleman, taking the offered hands in his and imprinting a kiss upon the still round and blooming cheek. ""I have ventured to come without previous announcement o' my intention, or query about the inconvenience I might cause in your household arrangements, or--""""No fear of that, sir,"" Mr. Dinsmore interrupted, offering his hand in return. ""I know that you are, and always will be, a most welcome guest in my daughter's house. You have given us a very pleasant surprise, and the fault will not be ours if we do not keep you all winter."""
"Then he went on to account for his sudden appearance. He had been sojourning some hundreds of miles farther north, had not been well, and his physician advising an immediate change to a more southerly climate, he had set out at once for Ion, without waiting to let them know of his intentions; feeling sure of just such a welcome as he had received.The conversation broken in upon by Mr. Lilburn's arrival, was not renewed that evening, but the subject was introduced again the next morning at the breakfast table, and some questions in regard to it were decided. All could not be, however, without consultation with the captain and Violet, and with Lester and Elsie Leland.Both families were speedily informed, through the telephone, of the arrival of Mr. Lilburn, and that afternoon saw them all gathered at Ion again to do him honor, and to complete their arrangements for the holiday festivities.During the intervening weeks there was a great deal of traveling back and forth between the three houses, and to and from the city; for their plans involved a good deal of shopping on the part of both the older people and the children.The latter were so full of pleasureable excitement that at times they found no little difficulty in giving proper attention to their studies. Such was especially the case with Rosie and Lulu, but both Grandma Elsie and Capt. Raymond were quite firm, though in a kind and gentle way, in requiring tasks to be well learned before permission was given to lay them aside for more congenial employment.""I think it is a little hard, mamma,"" pouted Rosie; ""I'm almost grown up and it's so pleasant in the parlor where you are all talking together--especially now that Cousin Ronald is here--that it does seem too bad to have to run away from it all an hour before you older folks separate for the night. I'd feel it hard even if I wasn't wanting more time for my fancy work for Christmas.""""If you had overheard Lulu addressing the remarks to her father that you have just made to me, would you have taken them as evidence of her confidence in his wisdom and love for her?"" asked her mother; and Rosie was obliged to acknowledge that she would not.At the same hour Max and Lulu were in their work-room at home, busily carving. Since their dismissal from that morning's tasks, they had spent every moment of time at that work, except what had necessarily been given to the eating of their dinner.""No, daughter, not another minute; these winter days are short; the sun will Boon set, and outdoor exercise will not do you half so much good after sundown as before. Put on your hats and coats and we will have a brisk walk together. The roads are quite dry now and I think we will find it enjoyable.""Both she and Max obeyed the order with cheerful alacrity, and presently the three sallied forth together to return in time for tea, in good spirits and with fine appetites for their meal; the children rosy and merry.Violet was teaching Lulu to crochet, and the little girl had become much interested in her work. When the hour for bedtime came she did not want to give it up, and like Rosie begged for permission to stay up for another hour.He returned it. ""I think to-morrow is likely to be a pleasant day,"" he said, ""and if so I hope to take my wife and children to the city for some more of the shopping you all seem to find so necessary and delightful just now. Your Aunt Elsie and Evelyn are going too, so that you can probably have your friend's help in selecting the articles you wish to buy.""""Yes, indeed, Mamma Vi, and I hope papa will take me several times. I want to select my gift for Rosie to-morrow, with Eva to help me; and I'd like Rosie to go with me another time to help me choose one for Evelyn.""""I think I shall be able to gratify you in that; and to give you more time for Christmas work, I will release you from the task of taking care of your own rooms, till after the holidays, and have them attended to by one of the servants,"" said the captain. ""But now bid good night and go to your bed.""The weather next day was favorable, and the shopping a decided success. The ladies and little girls returned somewhat weary with their exertions, but in fine spirits, Lulu feeling particularly happy over a present for Rosie, which every one thought was sure to be acceptable."
"Indeed in the afternoon of every pleasant day, from that to the one before Christmas, the Woodburn carriage might have been seen driving to and from the city; and on almost every occasion Lulu was one of its occupants.But on the twenty third she preferred to stay behind--so much that she wanted a share in was going on at, or near home; first the trimmings with evergreens of several rooms in the mansion, then of the school-house for the poor whites of the neighborhood, which Capt. Raymond had caused to be built on a corner of his estate--paying a teacher that the children might be instructed without cost to their parents.The colored people employed on the Fairview estate attended there also, and were to have a share in the entertainment provided for those of Woodburn and Ion; so the children of the three families united in the work of ornamenting first one building, then the other, finding it great sport, and flattering themselves that they were of great assistance, though the older people who were overseeing matters, and the servants acting under their direction, were perhaps of a different opinion. Yet the sight of the enjoyment of the little folks more than atoned for the slight inconvenience of having them about.It had been decided at Woodburn that they would not go to Ion till Christmas morning, as they all preferred to celebrate Christmas eve at home. The children were going to hang up their stockings, but had not been told that they would have a tree or any gifts. They thought, and had said to each other, that perhaps papa might think the money he had given them to spend and to give, and the privilege of selecting objects for his benevolence, was enough from him, but the friends at Ion and Fairview always had remembered them, and most likely would do so again.""Still they may not,"" Lulu added with a slight sigh when she talked the matter over with Max and Grace that morning, for the last time; ""for they are all giving more than usual to missions and disabled ministers, and poor folks, and I don't know what else; but it's real fun to give to the poor round here; I mean it will be to help put things on the trees and then see how pleased they'll all be when they get 'em: at least I do suppose they will. Don't you, May?""""I shall be very much surprised if they're not,"" he assented, ""though I begin to find out that 'it is more blessed to give than to receive.' And yet for all that if I get some nice presents to-night or to-morrow I--sha'n't be at all sorry,"" he added with a laugh.""No, not a word; and as he tells me almost always what he intends to have done about the place,"" the boy went on with a look of pride in the confidence reposed in him, ""I'm afraid it's pretty good evidence that we're not to have one.""For a moment Grace looked sorely disappointed; then brightening, ""But I'm most sure,"" she said, ""that papa and mamma won't let us go without any presents at all. They love us a great deal, and will be sure to remember us with a little bit of something."" Grandma Elsie's college boys, Harold and Herbert Travilla, had come home for the holidays, arriving the latter part of the previous week. This morning they had come over to Woodburn, very soon after breakfast, ""to have a chat with Vi while they could catch her alone,"" they said, ""for with all the company that was to be entertained at Ion they might not have so good a chance again.""They stood with her at the window watching the carriage as it drove away with the captain and his children. It had hardly reached the gate leading into the high road when Harold turned to his sister with the remark,""They will have a goodly supply of those,"" Violet said, with a pleased look, glancing in the direction of a table heaped with packages of various sizes and shapes. ""Do you know, boys, when Christmas times come round I always feel glad I married a man with children; it's such a dear delight to lay plans for their enjoyment and to carry them out.""""It's very good in you boys to come here and help me instead of joining in the fun they are doubtless having at the school-house,"" remarked Violet, as she handed a glittering fairy to Harold who was mounted upon a step-ladder alongside of the tree. ""There, I think that will look well perched on that topmost bough.""""Yes, I think Herbie and I are entitled to any amount of gratitude on your part, for the great self-denial we are practicing, and the wonderful exertions we shall put forth in carrying out your wishes and directions in regard to this difficult and irksome business.""""Of course they must not be forgotten in the reckoning up of your causes for gratitude. Ah, Vi, how my heart goes out in pity and sympathy for you when I reflect that you not only never have shared in the inestimable privileges and delights of college boy life, but are, in the very nature of things, forever debarred from participation in them!""""I entirely appreciate your feelings on the subject,"" she said, with mock gravity, ""but would advise that for the present you forget them, and give your undivided attention to the business in hand. That second fairy does not maintain a very graceful attitude.""""Herbert, when Mrs. Raymond and I have reached your venerable age you may expect to find us as sedate and industrious as you are now,"" remarked Harold, proceeding to hang upon the tree various ornaments, as Herbert handed them to him.""Yes,"" replied Violet; ""but he thought his duty called him to the other places; and I think my good husband never fails to go where duty calls. We talked it over and concluded that the best plan we could hit upon was for me to stay at home and see to this work, while he should take his children and assist at the decoration of the school-houses."""
"Their work was finished, its results surveyed with satisfaction, and the door of the room closed and locked upon it, before the return of the carriage bringing Capt. Raymond and his merry, happy little flock.Dinner filled up the greater part of the interval between their home-coming and return to the school-house on the corner of the estate, to witness the distribution of gifts to the poor whites of the neighborhood; and by a little management on the part of their father, Violet and her brothers, they were kept from the vicinity of the room where the Christmas tree stood, and got no hint of its existence.Their thoughts were full of the doings of the morning and the coming events of the afternoon, and their tongues ran fast on the two subjects. Their father had to remind them once or twice that older people must be allowed a chance to talk as well as themselves; but his tone was not stern, and the slight reproof, though sufficient to produce the desired effect, threw no damper upon their youthful spirits.They were in the carriage again soon after leaving the table, Violet with them this time, Harold and Herbert riding on horseback alongside of the vehicle, for they desired a share in witnessing the bestowal of the gifts.The captain offered a short prayer, and made a little address appropriate to the occasion; teacher and scholars sang a hymn, a Christmas carol; then the tree was unveiled amid murmurs of admiration and delight, and the distribution of the gifts began.The tree was hung with rosy-cheeked apples, oranges, bananas, bunches of grapes and strings of popcorn. There were bright tinsel ornaments too, and a goodly array of gaily dressed paper dolls, mostly Gracie's contribution.""I've had such good times myself, playing with them and dressing them, that I do believe the poor children, that don't have half the pleasures I do, will enjoy them too, and I can do very well without,"" she said to Lulu on deciding to make the sacrifice.From the Woodburn school-house our friends all repaired to the one at Ion, and a similar scene was enacted there. The exercises and the gifts to the children were very nearly the same, but there were older people--house servants and laborers on the estates--to whom were given more substantial gifts in money and provisions for the support of their families.And now the children began to think of the home celebration of Christmas eve, and to renew their wonderings as to what arrangements might have been made for their own enjoyment of its return. Still they asked no question on the subject, but they sobered down and were very quiet during the short drive.""Howdy do? Where you been?"" called out a rather harsh voice, and sending a surprised, inquiring glance about in search of the speaker, the children presently spied a cage with a parrot in it; an African parrot; grey, with a scarlet tail.""Yes, if you want it, though I fear she may prove a rather troublesome pet. Here is Gracie's gift from papa,"" he added, pointing to a beautiful Maltese kitten curled upon the rug before the fire. ""We mustn't let Max's big gift swallow your little one. I trust that in time we can teach them to be friends.""""I s'pose they have feelings as well as other folks, papa,"" she said, smiling up affectionately into his face. ""I mean to be very kind to this pretty pussy; and oh I'm ever so much obliged to you for her!""""No; certainly not. But take care of your fingers, daughter; she may snap at them and give you a bite that you will remember for a long while. Now go and get yourselves ready for tea. It is almost time for the bell to ring.""""How pleased they are!"" she said with a joyous look up into her husband's face. ""It's a perfect treat to witness their delight on such occasions. I can hardly wait to show them the tree with all its treasures."""
"The faces that surrounded the tea table that evening were very bright, though the children had no expectation of the treat in store for them; each had had a present from papa, and that was almost more than they had ventured to hope for.But on reaching the hall, instead of going into the library they turned toward the parlor on the other side of it, in which, as the children well remembered, last year's Christmas tree had been set up.""Oh! oh! what a beauty! what a splendid tree!"" cried the children, dancing about and clapping their hands in delight. ""And we didn't know we were to have any at all. Mamma Vi you must have had it set up, and trimmed it while we were gone this morning. Didn't you? Oh thank you ever so much!""""You shall have it; it was put there on purpose for papa's baby girl,"" he said, taking it up carefully and putting it into her arms. ""Now let us see what we can find for mamma and your brother and sisters.""His gift to Violet was some beautiful lace selected with the help of her mother. He had contrived to add it to the adornments of the tree without her knowledge. She was greatly pleased when he detached and handed it to her.Max was delighted to receive a Magic lantern and a Sleight of Hand outfit, Lulu a game of Lawn and Parlor Ring Toss, and a handsome Toilet Case. Grace had the same and beside a brass bedstead for her dolls, with mattress and pillows, and a large and complete assortment of everything needed for making and dressing paper dolls. That last was from Lulu.""And I mine,"" said Lulu, twining her arms about her father's neck and looking up lovingly into his face, ""for I know he's nice, and generous, and good as gold, though he isn't old or the sort of person to be called a fellow.""""Indeed! one might infer that you were quite well acquainted with him,"" laughed the captain, giving her a hug and kiss. ""Yes, hang it up. And, Max, if you don't feel it beneath the dignity of a lad of your size, there will be no harm in your trying the same experiment.""""Now all three of you get to bed and to sleep as soon as you can, in order to give the old fellow a chance to pay his visit,"" said the captain; ""for I have always understood that he never does so till all the children in the house are asleep. I'll go in to kiss my little girls good-night after they are snug in bed, but we will reserve our talk till morning.""At Ion too, there was a beautiful Christmas tree, bearing fruit not very dissimilar to that of the one at Woodburn. It had been the occasion of much mirth and rejoicing on the part of the children, and pleasure to the older people: the gifts had been apportioned, those of the servants bestowed and carried away, but most of those belonging to the family, and all the ornaments, were left upon it that the guests of to-morrow might be treated to the spectacle of its beauty.""Indeed; you seem to have a high opinion of her courage! You need never, either of you, be afraid or ashamed of anything but sin, my darlings,"" he added, more gravely. ""If you are God's children, nothing can harm you. He will watch over us through the dark and silent night while we are wrapped in slumber. 'Behold he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber or sleep.'"""
"""I'm so glad the Bible tells us that, papa,"" she said; ""but I'm glad, too, that you sleep in the next room, and have the door open always at night, so that if I should want you, you could easily hear me call, and come to me.""""Why we never thought of that!"" exclaimed Lulu, laughing. ""But mine's a little the largest, and it's red and Gracie's is blue. Don't you suppose, papa, that he'll be smart enough to guess which is which?""Day was faintly dawning when Lulu awoke. ""Merry Christmas, Gracie!"" she whispered in her sister's ear. ""I'm going to get our stockings and see if there is anything in 'em,"" and with a bound she was out on the floor and stealing across it to the fireplace, with care to make no noise.""Yes, yes, indeed! they're just as full as they can be! I've brought 'em; here's yours,"" putting it into Gracie's hands and getting into bed again. ""Let's pull the things out and feel what they are, though we can't see much till it gets lighter.""""There! little Elsie has found her stocking, I do believe,"" said Lulu, starting up to a sitting posture that she might look through the open door into the next room. As she did so a tiny toddling figure clothed in a white night dress, and with a well filled stocking in its arms emerged from the nursery door and ran across the room to the bedside, crying gleefully, ""See mamma, papa, Elsie got.""Baby Elsie was a merry, demonstrative little thing, and it was great fun for them all to watch her and hear her shouts of delight as she came upon one treasure after another;--tiny, gaily dressed dolls of both sexes, and other toys suited to her years.It did not take her very long to empty the stocking, and then the captain said to the older ones, ""Now you may close the door, my dears, and get yourselves dressed and ready for the duties and pleasures of the day. I shall be in presently for our usual chat before breakfast.""""I was just wondering why it's right for me to have so many other things, and would be wrong for me to have that ring I wanted so badly. But please, papa,"" she added quickly and with a vivid blush, ""don't think I mean to be naughty about it, or want you to spend any more money on me.""""No, dear child, I could not think so ill of you. I did not think it right or wise to buy you the ring, because it would have been spending a great deal for something quite useless, and very unsuitable for my little girl. The things I have given you I considered it right to buy because they will all be useful to you in one way or another.""""Yes, daughter; people--and especially little folks like Max and Lulu and you--need amusement as a change and rest from work; we can do all the more work in the end if we take time for needed rest and recreation.""Breakfast and family worship were over, such of their effects as they would be likely to need during the few days of their expected stay at Ion, had been packed and sent, the family carriage was at the door, and every body nearly ready to get into it, when there was an arrival.""Don't think for a moment that we have come to prevent you from accepting your invitation to Ion as promptly as possible,"" said Herbert gaily; ""we've come after you, and are glad to perceive, in your attire, signs of readiness to depart.""""And we've a proposal to make,"" said Harold; ""namely that you all accompany us to the Oaks for a short call on Uncle Horace and the rest--and their Christmas tree of course--before going over to Ion. The air is delightfully bracing, the roads are good, and if we find there is time, perhaps we might as well extend our ride to the Laurels, and give Aunt Rose a call, in case we reach there before the family have left home for Ion. What do you say captain? and you Vi?"""
"That was granted, the callers were all taken in to see the tree, dog, bird and pussy were exhibited, the pretty things found in the stockings also, and when all had been duly admired they set out upon their jaunt.Both calls were made, only a short time spent at each place--hardly more than enough for an exchange of greetings and a hasty examination, of the Christmas trees and gifts--then they drove on to Ion, and the holiday festivities so long looked forward to by the young people with such eager expectation and delight, began.Rosie and Evelyn had declined to tell what they were until they could show them, even refusing to answer Lulu's eager query, put while they were driving to the Oaks, ""O Rosie, did your mamma give you the set of pearls you wanted so badly?""""Wait till we get to Ion and I'll show you all my presents; I received a good many and ought not to fret if I did not get everything I wanted,"" was what Rosie said in reply, and Lulu, understanding it to mean that there was some disappointment, concluded that the pearls had not been given.The guests, all relatives or connections, arrived within a few minutes of each other and for a little while were all gathered together in the tree room--as the children called it for the time--and a very merry, lively set they were.The Raymonds were given the same apartments that had been appropriated to them when living at Ion; Gracie sharing Lulu's room, which communicated directly with the one where the captain and Violet would sleep.""Yes, they're lovely,"" said Rosie; ""your papa does dress you beautifully. I, too, am dressed for the day, and I'd like you both to come to my room for a while. Eva is there taking off her things; she's to share my room while the house is so full. I thought you would want Eva for your bedfellow, but mamma said your father would want his two little girls close beside him.""""Yes, and that's where we like to be,"" Lulu answered quickly and in a very pleasant tone. ""It seems like home here in this room, too. Now we're ready to go with you, Rosie; we've got our things off and seen that our hair is all right.""Rosie hastily threw off her coat and hat, then opening a bureau drawer, took from it a jewel case saying with a look of exultation, ""I have something to show you, girls, mamma's Christmas gift to me;"" and raising the lid she displayed a beautiful pearl necklace and bracelets.""Mamma didn't buy them,"" explained Rosie; ""they are a set grandpa gave her when she was a little girl; and I think they are as handsome as any she could have found any where. She said she valued them very highly as his gift, but would never wear them again, and as I am her own little girl, she was willing to give them to me.""""Yes; in my fifteenth year; almost a woman, as grandpa tells me sometimes--when he wants to make me ashamed of not being wiser and better I suppose,"" returned Rosie with a laugh, closing the casket and returning it to the drawer, just as Betty, the little maid, showed her black face and woolly head at the half open door with the announcement, ""Dinnah's ready, Miss Rosie; an' all de folks gwine into de dinnin' room.""""Very well; we're not sorry to hear it, are we girls? Let us pair off and go down at once to secure our fair share,"" said Rosie gaily. ""There's just an even number of us--Maud and Lora, Lulu and Eva, Grace and Rosie Lacey, Sydney and I. We're to have a table to ourselves; I asked mamma if we might, and she gave consent.""""I like that,"" remarked Sydney with satisfaction; ""we can have our own fun and eat what we please without anybody to trouble us with suggestions that perhaps such and such articles of food may not agree with us.""After tea they had romping games, but at nine o'clock were called together for family worship; then the younger ones, including Lulu and Grace, went to their beds; very willingly too, for the day--begun so early because of their eagerness to examine their stockings--had been an unusually long and exciting one; so that they felt ready for rest.""I'm glad too,"" he said. ""Yes, we have a great deal to be thankful for--you and I. Most of all for God's unspeakable gift--the dear Saviour whose birth and life and death have bought all our other blessings for us.""My child, try to keep in mind always, even when engaged in your sports, that you are his and must so act and speak as to bring no disgrace upon his cause; make it your constant endeavor to honor him in all your words and ways.""""I know it, my darling; I find it so too; but we must watch and pray, asking God earnestly night and morning, on our knees, to keep us from temptation and from sin, and often sending up a swift, silent petition from our hearts at other times when we feel that we need help to overcome.""I want you, my little daughter, to be particularly on the watch against your besetting sin--an inclination to sudden outbursts of passion. It is not to be expected that everything will move on as smoothly, with so many children and young people together, every day, as they have to-day, and I fear you will be strongly tempted at times to give way to your naturally quick temper."""
"""Oh I am afraid so too papa; and it would be perfectly dreadful if I should!"" she said with a half shudder, twining her arm round his neck and hiding her face on his shoulder. ""Oh won't you ask God to help me to keep from it?"" It had been growing colder all the afternoon, and continued to do so very rapidly through the night. The next morning at the breakfast table some of the lads announced, with great glee that the lakelet was frozen over; the ice so thick and solid that it was perfectly safe for skating in every part.The captain asked how many knew how to use skates, and from the replies it seemed that all the lads had been more or less accustomed to their use, some of the girls also. Zoe had had quite a good deal of practice before her marriage, a little since.The winters were usually too mild in this part of the country to give much opportunity for that kind of exercise. She was therefore the more eager to avail herself of this one; for she was very fond of the sport.But that difficulty could be easily remedied; their homes were not far off, nor was the village, with its stores where such things could be bought. It was decided to despatch messengers for the needed supplies.He turned to her with an indulgent smile. ""Would you? then you shall; I will send for the skates and give you a lesson in the art myself. I used to be reckoned a good skater in my boyhood. Would my little Grace like to learn too?""Upon leaving the breakfast table they all repaired to the parlor for family worship, as was their custom morning and evening. Then those who had skates, and some who wanted the walk and a near view of the skating, Lulu among them, got themselves ready and went to the lakelet, while the others waited for the return of the messengers; most of them meanwhile gathered about the windows overlooking the lakelet, to watch the movements of the skaters--Edward, Zoe, Harold, Herbert, Rosie, Evelyn and Max; presently joined by Capt. Raymond and Violet, a pair of skates having been found to fit each of them.When all were fairly started the scene became very animated and pretty. The two married couples skated well, but Harold, and especially Herbert, far exceeded them, the swift, easy movement with which they glided over the glassy surface of the lake, the exact balancing of their bodies, and the graceful curves they executed called forth many an admiring and delighted exclamation from the onlookers, both near at hand and farther away at the windows of the mansion.""Bravo!"" cried the two old gentlemen simultaneously, as Herbert performed a feat in which he seemed to fairly outdo himself. Mr. Lilburn adding, ""I feel the old ardor for the sport stir within me at sight o' the lad's adroit movements. At his age I might have ventured to compete with as expert a skater as he. What say you, Cousin Horace, to a match atween the two auld chaps o' us down there the noo?""At that moment Lulu came running in. ""The skates have come, Grandma Elsie,"" she said, ""just as I have got back to the house. Papa sent me in because it was too cold, he said, for me to be standing still out there. He'll come for me when Mamma Vi is tired and wants to come in."""
"The ladies were nothing loath, everybody seemed to catch the spirit of the hour, the skates were quickly distributed, and all hurried away to the lake, but Lulu and Grace who were to stay within doors, by their father's orders, till he came, or sent for them.""Not so very; the wind doesn't blow; but when you've been standing still a while your feet feel right cold. I hardly thought about it though, I was so taken up with watching the skating, till papa called to me that it was too cold for me to stand there, and I must come in.""""Wasn't he good to send for these for me?"" she went on, holding up her new skates and regarding them with much satisfaction. ""They're nice ones, and it'll be nice to have him teach me how to use them. I've heard of people getting hard falls learning how to skate, but I think I'll be pretty safe not to fall with papa to attend to me.""""Waiting patiently, my darlings?"" he said, with an affectionate smile. ""I know it is rather hard sometimes for little folks to wait. But you may bundle up now, and I will take you out to enjoy the sport with the rest. It will be a nice walk for you, Gracie, and when you get there you will have a pleasant time I think.""A pretty boat house stood at the water's edge--on the hither side, under the trees, and now close beside it, on the ice, the children spied a small, light sleigh well supplied with robes of wolf and bear skins.""Here we are, Cousin Harold,"" called a childish voice, and Rose Lacey came running up almost out of breath with haste and excitement, two other little girl cousins following at her heels; ""here we are. Can you take us now?""In another minute the four were in the sleigh with the robes well tucked around them. Then, Harold, taking hold of the back of the vehicle, gave it a vigorous shove away from the shore, and keeping a tight grip on it, propelled it quite rapidly around the lake.It required a good deal of exertion, but Herbert and others came to his assistance and the sleigh made the circuit many times, its young occupants laughing, chatting and singing right merrily: the gayest of the gay.Meanwhile the others enjoyed the skating, perhaps quite as much. The older ladies and the two old gentlemen seemed to have renewed their youth, and kept up the sport a good deal longer than they had intended in the beginning; while the younger ones, and especially the children, were full of mirth and jollity, challenging each other to trials of speed and skill, laughing good-naturedly at little mishaps, and exchanging jests and good humored banter.And Cousin Ronald added to the fun by causing them to hear again and again sounds as of jingling sleighbells and prancing horses in their rear. So distinct and natural were these sounds that they could not help springing aside out of the track of the supposed steeds, and turning their heads to see how near they were.But for that she would have fallen several times, for it seemed almost impossible to keep her balance; however she gained skill and confidence; and at length asked to be allowed to try it for a little unaided.She succeeded very well and after a time he ceased to watch her constantly, remaining near her, but taking his eyes off her now and then to see what others were doing; noting with fatherly pride in his son, how Max was emulating the older skaters, and returning a joyous look and smile given him by Gracie, as she swept past in the sleigh.She had thrown out her hands in falling, and he felt a thrill of horror as he perceived that one of them lay directly in the path of a skater, Chester Dinsmore, who was moving with such velocity that he would not be able to check his speed in time to avoid running over her.But even while he perceived her peril the captain had, with an almost lightning like movement, stooped over his child and dragged her backward. Barely in time; Chester's skate just grazed her fingers, cutting off the tip of her mitten. There were drops of blood on the ice, and for a moment her father thought her fingers were off.""I'm not hurt, papa; at least only a very little,"" she hastened to say, while the others crowded about them with agitated, anxious questioning. ""Is Lulu hurt?"" ""Did Chess run over her!"" ""Did the fall hurt her?"""
"""My fingers are bleeding a little, but they don't hurt very much,"" she answered. ""I think his skate went over my mitten, and I suppose my fingers would have been cut off if papa hadn't jerked me back out of the way.""Chester had just joined the group. ""I can never be sufficiently thankful for the escape,"" he said with a slight tremble in his tones, ""I could never have forgiven myself if I had maimed that pretty hand; though it was utterly impossible for me to stop myself in time, at the headlong rate of speed with which I was moving.""""Your thankfulness can hardly equal her father's,"" the captain said with emotion almost too big for utterance, as he gently drew off the mitten, and bound up the wounded fingers with his handkerchief. ""That will do till I get you to the house. Shall I carry you, daughter?""""Allow me to take off your skates for you,"" Chester said, kneeling down on the ice at their feet, and beginning to undo the straps as he spoke. ""And I will gladly carry you up to the house, too, if you and your father are willing.""Violet was quite startled and alarmed to see the child brought in with her hand bound up; but when the blood had been washed away the wounds were found to be little more than skin deep; the bleeding soon ceased, and some court-plaster was all that was needed to cover up the cuts.""There, my dear child, you have had a very narrow escape,"" he said when he had finished, drawing her into his arms and caressing her with great tenderness; ""what a heartbreaking thing it would have been for us both had this little hand,"" taking it tenderly in his, ""been robbed of its fingers; far worse to me than to have lost my own.""""And you have saved them for me, you dear father,"" she said, clinging about his neck and laying her cheek to his, her eyes full of tears, a slight tremble in her voice. ""But they are yours, because I am,"" she added, laughing a little hysterically. ""Oh I'm every bit yours; from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet.""""Yes, so you are; one of my choice treasures, my darling,"" he said with emotion; ""and my heart is full of thankfulness to God our heavenly Father for enabling me to save you from being so sadly maimed.""""I'll not let you try it in any other way for some time to come,"" he said, stroking her hair; ""you must become a good deal more proficient in the use of skates before I can again trust you to go alone; especially where there are so many other and more skilful skaters.""""Come in, Rosie,"" said the captain. ""Mother is very kind, and I am glad to be able to report to her that Lulu is only very slightly hurt; so slightly that doubtless she will be ready to join her mates in any sport that may be going on this afternoon.""""O Lu, I'm so glad they weren't!"" said Rosie. ""Eva has been crying fit to break her heart because she was sure that at least the tips of your fingers had been taken off; and in fact I couldn't help crying myself,"" she added, turning away to wipe her eyes.""How good in you both!"" exclaimed Lulu, lifting her head and showing flushed cheeks and shining eyes. ""Papa, shan't I go and find Eva and comfort her by letting her see how little I am hurt, after all?""""No, you poor dear; you've been breaking your heart about almost nothing. I hurt my knees a little in falling, and Chester's skate took a tiny slice out of my middle finger, and scratched the one each side of it, but that's all. See, they don't even need to be wrapped up.""""Oh, I'm so glad!"" exclaimed Eva with a sigh of relief, and smiling through tears; then with a shudder and hugging Lulu close, ""It would have been too horrible if they'd been cut off! I think skating is dangerous, and I'm not sorry the snow has come to spoil it; for us girls, I mean; the older folks and the boys can take care of themselves, I suppose."""
"""I always did like boys' sports,"" remarked Lulu, laughing. ""Aunt Beulah used to call me a tom-boy, and even Max would sometimes say he believed I was half boy; I was always so glad of a chance to slip off to the woods with him where I could run and jump and climb without any body by to scold me and tell me I'd tear my clothes. I don't have to do those things without leave now, for papa lets me; he say it's good for my health, and that that's of far more importance than my clothes. Oh, we all do have such good times now, at home in our father's house, with him to take care of us!""""Yes, I'm sure you do, and I'm so glad for you. How happy you all seem! and how brave you are about bearing pain, dear Lu! You are so bright and cheerful, though I'm sure your fingers must ache. Don't they?""Some of the younger ones, who had particularly enjoyed the skating, felt a good deal disappointed that the storm had come to put a stop to it, and were in consequence quite sober and subdued in their demeanor as they took their seats at the table.A moment of complete silence followed the asking of the blessing, then, as Edward took up a carving-knife, and stuck the fork into a roast duck in front of him, there was a loud ""Quack, quack,"" that startled everybody for an instant, followed by merry peals of laughter from old and young.""Perhaps, laddie; but there may be some other amusement provided, and in that case the tales will keep. It strikes me I heard some o' the leddies laying plans for the afternoon and evening?"" he added, turning inquiringly in Zoe's direction.""How are the fingers, dear child? have they been giving you much pain?"" the captain asked when he came to her room for the usual good-night talk, sitting down as he spoke, drawing her to a seat upon his knee, and taking the wounded hand tenderly in his.""Only a twinge once in a while, papa,"" she said, putting the other arm round his neck and smiling into his eyes. ""It's been a very nice day for me in spite of my accident; everybody has been so good and kind. I think they tried to give me a pleasant part in as many of the tableaux as they could to comfort me, and really after all it was only a little bit of a hurt.""""But narrowly escaped being a very serious one. Ah my heart is full of thankfulness to God for you, my darling, and for myself, that the injury was no greater. You might have lost your fingers or your hand; you might even have been killed by falling in such a way as to strike your head very hard upon the ice.""""I'm sure you might feel that it was all my own fault, papa,"" she said tightening her clasp of his neck and kissing him with ardent affection; ""every bit my own fault because I begged you to let me try it alone.""""No, that could not have excused me; because it is a father's duty to take every care of his child, whether she wishes it or not; and it is my settled purpose to do so henceforward,"" he said, returning her caress with great tenderness. The storm continued through the night but had ceased before the guests at Ion were astir; the ground was thickly carpeted with snow and clouds still obscured the sun, but there was no wind and the cold was not severe.""Just the day for a snow fight,"" remarked Frank Dinsmore, as he and the other lads of the company stood grouped together on the veranda shortly after breakfast; ""plenty of snow and in prime condition for making into balls.""The boys waited, employing the time in preparing piles of snowballs, and presently the girls came rushing back bringing the musical instruments mentioned by Walter, and a jews-harp and accordeon beside.Max picked himself up, ran round to the other side of the fort, and finding Harold and the other large boys among the defenders, each engaged in a hand to hand scuffle with a besieger, so that only little Walter was left to oppose him, again leaped over the barrier, seized the flag, leaped back and sped away toward the house waving it in triumph and shouting, ""Hurrah! victory is ours!"""
"""Not so fast young man!"" shouted back Herbert, bounding over the breast works and giving chase, all the rest following, some to aid him in recovering the lost standard, the others to help Max to keep out of his reach.Herbert was agile and fleet of foot, but so was Max. Back and forth, up and down he ran, now dodging his pursuers behind trees and shrubs, now taking a flying leap over some low obstacle, and speeding on, waving the flag above his head and shouting back derisively at those who were trying to catch him.The next instant Harold and the rest of his command regained and reoccupied the fort, the attacking party following close at their heels, and the battle with the snowballs recommenced with redoubled fury.All this was witnessed with intense interest by the spectators at the windows and on the veranda; at the beginning of the chase the band forgot to play and dropping their instruments employed themselves in encouraging pursuers or pursued with clapping of hands and shouts of exultation over their exploits.The contest was kept up for a long time, the flag taken and retaken again and again till the fort was quite demolished by the repeated assaults, and the snow well trodden down all about the spot where it had stood.Some quiet games filled up the remainder of the morning and the afternoon. In the evening they were ready for another romp in which the girls might have a share; so Stage Coach, Blind-man's Buff, and similar games were in vogue.They had been very merry and entirely harmonious, but at length a slight dispute arose, and Capt. Raymond, sitting in an adjoining room conversing with the older guests and members of the family, yet not inattentive to what was going on among the young folks--heard Lulu's voice raised to a higher than its ordinary key.""Why, yes, indeed, you dear papa!"" she exclaimed with a sudden change of tone, putting her arms about his neck and looking up into his face with eyes full of ardent filial affection. ""How nice in you to love me well enough to want to leave the company in the parlors to give a little time to petting me!""""I love you full well enough for that, my darling,"" he said, repeating his caresses, ""but my call to you was because a tone in my little girl's voice told me she needed her father just at that moment.""She looked up inquiringly, then with sudden comprehension, ""Oh! you thought I was in danger of getting into a passion, and I'm afraid I was. Papa, you are my good guardian angel, always on the watch to help me in my hard fight with my dreadful temper. Thank you very, very much!""""You are entirely welcome, daughter,"" he said, softly smoothing her hair; ""it could hardly be a sadder thing to you than to me, should that enemy of yours succeed in overcoming you again. Try, dear child, to be constantly on the watch against it.""I know it, dear child, but I can only encourage you to continue the fight with your evil nature, looking ever unto Jesus for help. Press forward in the heavenly way, and if you fall, get up again and go on with redoubled energy and determination; and you will win the victory at last; for 'in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.'""You are quite excusable,"" returned Lulu pleasantly. ""Papa had something to say to me, that was all,"" and she glanced up at him with such a loving look, as at that instant he entered the room, that no one could suspect the talk between them had been other than most pleasant.""There is no one here,"" he said, then burst into a laugh as, turning round once more, he perceived Mr. Lilburn quietly seated near the open door into the adjoining parlor where the older people were. ""Cousin Ronald, may I ask what you know of that gypsy and the stolen child?""Harold at once stepped to the window, drew back the curtains, raised the sash and threw open the shutters, giving a full view of all the grounds on that side of the house;--for the clouds had cleared away and the moon was shining down on snowladen trees and shrubs and paths and parterres carpeted with the same; but no living creature was to be seen.Grace holding fast to her father's hand, ventured close to the window and sent searching glances from side to side, then with a sigh of relief, said, ""Yes, I do believe it was only Cousin Ronald; and I'm ever so glad the woman and her baby are not freezing.""""Never mind, darling,"" he said soothingly, passing an arm affectionately about her and softly smoothing her curls with his other hand, ""it is good natured amusement; we all know what you meant and love you all the better for your tenderness of heart toward the poor and suffering."""
"At that instant the tap on the window was repeated, then the voice spoke again, but in cheerful tones. ""Dinna fret ye, bit bonny lassie, I was but crackin' me jokes. I'm neither cauld nor hungry, and my bairns grew to be men and women lang syne.""""Thanks, laddies,"" he said, ""but I'm no' so infirm that I canna cross the room wi'out the help o' your strong young arms, and being particularly comfortable in the chair I now occupy, I shall bide here, by your leave.""""The refreshments are ready and waiting in the dining room, and you are all invited to walk out there and partake of them,"" said Grandma Elsie, as the servants drew back the sliding doors, showing a table glittering with china, cut-glass and silver, loaded with fruits, nuts, cakes, confectionery and ices, and adorned with a profusion of flowers from the conservatories and hothouses.""Yes--no; I'm very willing to take whatever papa chooses to give me,"" returned Lulu. ""You see,"" she added laughing at Rosie's look of mingled surprise and incredulity, ""there have been several times he has let me have my own way and I didn't find it at all nice; so now I've really grown willing to be directed and controlled by him.""""Ah good night, my son,"" returned the captain, pausing in his walk, taking the hand Max held out to him and clasping it affectionately in his. ""You had a fine, exciting game this morning out there on the lawn. I was glad to hear my boy avow his attachment to the glorious old flag his father has sailed under for so many years. I trust he will always be ready to do so when such an avowal is called for, as long as he lives.""It was the winding up of their Christmas festivities at Ion, and all were in the mood for making it as gay and mirthful as possible. Some--the Raymonds among others--would leave shortly after tea, the rest by or before bedtime.Zoe was patching an old coat, Lulu an apron, Gracie a doll's dress; Eva and Rosie each had a worn stocking drawn over her hand, and was busily engaged in darning it; the other girls were mending gloves, the boys old shoes; and as they worked they talked among themselves.With that the actors withdrew, and presently Chester Dinsmore returned alone, marching in and around the room with head erect and pompous air. His clothes were of fine material and fashionable cut, he wore handsome jewelry, sported a gold headed cane, and strutted to and fro, gazing about him with an air of lofty disdain as of one who felt himself superior to all upon whom his glances fell.Harold presently followed him into the room. He was dressed as a country swain, came in with modest, diffident air, and for a while stood watching Chester curiously from the opposite side of the apartment, then crossing over, he stood before him, hat in hand, and bowing low.""I, sir?"" cried Chester, drawing himself up to his full height, and swelling with importance. ""I? I am the greatest man in America; the greatest man of the age; I am Mr. Smith, sir, the inventor of the most delicious ices and confectionery ever eaten.""""We have here an elegant lace veil worth perhaps a hundred dollars; it is to be sold now to the highest bidder. Somebody give us a bid for this beautiful piece of costly lace, likely to go for a tithe of its real value.""""Ten dollars, ten dollars! This elegant and costly piece of lace going at ten dollars!"" cried the auctioneer, holding it higher still and waving it to and fro. ""Who bids higher? It is worth ten times that paltry sum; would be dirt cheap at twenty. Somebody bid twenty; don't let such a chance escape you; you can't expect to have another such. Who bids? Who bids?"""
"""Fifteen, fifteen! this lace veil, worth every cent of a hundred dollars, going at fifteen? Who bids higher? Now's your chance; you can't have it much longer. Going, going at fifteen dollars--this elegant veil, worth a cool hundred. Who bids higher? Going, going at fifteen dollars, not a quarter of its value. Will nobody bid higher? Going, going, gone!""They shortly returned, all dressed in shabby clothing, some with wallets on their backs, some with old baskets on their arms, an unmistakable troop of beggars, passing round among the spectators with whining petitions for cold victuals and pennies.""That auld dog o' mine always barks at sic a troop o' mendicants,"" remarked Cousin Ronald quietly. ""I ken mendicant's the word, lads and lasses, and ye hae acted it out wi' commendable ingenuity and success.""Then Edward came in, walked up to the fire and stood leaning against the mantelpiece in seemingly thoughtful mood; but as the lady travelers again appeared at the door, he started and went forward to receive them.""Not at all,"" she said with her own sweet smile. ""I know of nothing that would afford me greater satisfaction than one of the oldtime motherly talks with my dear college boys; so come in, my dears, and let us have it.""""Quite,"" she returned, giving a hand to each as they placed themselves beside her. ""Now remember that your mother will be glad of your confidence in everything that concerns you, great or small; nothing that interests you or affects your happiness in the very least, can fail to have an interest for her.""""Yes,"" assented Herbert, lifting her hand to his lips, ""and it is that which makes a private chat with our mother so great a delight; that and our mutual love. Mamma, dear, I can not believe I shall ever meet another woman who will seem to me at all comparable to my dearly loved and honored mother.""""Such words from the lips of my son are very sweet to my ear,"" she responded, a tender light shining in her eyes, ""and yet for your own sake I hope you are mistaken; I would have all my children know the happiness to be found in married life where mutual admiration, esteem and love are so great that the two are as one.""""I don't think either of us has begun on that thus far, mamma,"" said Harold. ""At present we are more solicitous to decide the important question, what shall our principal life work be? and in that we desire the help of our mother's counsel, and to follow her wishes.""""It is a question of very great importance,"" she said, ""for your success and usefulness in life will depend very largely upon your finding the work your heavenly Father intends you to do, and for which you are best fitted by the talents He has given you.""So we thought mamma, but recently our hearts have been so moved at thought of the millions perishing for lack of a saving knowledge of Christ, that it has become a momentous question with each of us whether he is called to preach the gospel, especially in the mission-field, at home or abroad.""Her eyes shone through glad tears. ""My dear boy,"" she said with emotion, ""to have sons in the ministry I should esteem the greatest honor that could be put upon me; for there can be no higher calling than that of an ambassador for Christ, no grander work than that of winning souls.""""Yes, oh yes! you are more His than mine; I dedicated you to his service even before you were born, and many times afterward. I would not dare stand in your way, nor would I wish to; for dearly as I love you both, sweet as your presence is to me, I am more than willing to deny myself the joy of having you near me for the sake of the Master's cause, and that you may win the reward of those to whom He will say at the last, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of the Lord.' Are you particularly drawn to the foreign field?"""
"""No, mamma,"" answered Harold, ""the cause is one--'the field is the world'--but while we are deeply interested in foreign missions and desirous to do all we can to help there, we feel that their prosperity depends upon the success of the work at home, and that the cause of home missions is the cause of our country also; for that cause we would labor and give as both patriots and Christians.""Look at the dangers threatening our dear native land--and the cause of Christ also--from vice and illiteracy, Popery and Mormonism, all ever on the increase from the rapid influx of undesirable immigrants--paupers, insane, anarchists, criminals. Ah how surely and speedily they will sweep away our liberties, both civil and religious, unless we rouse ourselves and put forth every energy to prevent it! Never a truer saying than that 'eternal vigilance is the price of liberty!' and nothing can secure it to us but the instruction and evangelization of these dangerous classes. Is it not so, mamma?""""Yes,"" she assented; ""I am satisfied that the gospel of Christ is the only remedy for those threatening evils, the only safeguard of our liberties, as well as the only salvation for a lost and ruined world.""And, my dear boys, if you devote yourselves to that work it shall be your mother's part, your mother's joy, to provide the means for your support. I can not go into the work myself, so the sending of my sons and supporting them while they labor, must be my contribution to the cause.""But I see no reason why you should give up the idea of studying medicine, since so many medical missionaries are needed. My plan would be to prepare you for both preaching and practising, if you have talent for both.""""Yes,"" she said ""it is both a responsibility and a privilege to be entrusted with so much of my Lord's money; pray for your mother, my dear boys, that she may have grace and wisdom to dispense it aright.""""We will, mamma, we do; and oh how often we rejoice in having a mother to whom we can confidently apply in behalf of a good object! You have many times given us the joy of relieving misery and providing instruction for the ignorant and depraved.""""It has been my endeavor to be a faithful steward,"" she sighed, ""and yet I might have given more than I have. I have been giving only of my income; I could give some of the principal; and I have a good many valuable jewels that might be turned into money for the Lord's treasury.""I have thought a good deal about that of late and have talked with my daughters in regard to the matter; I thought it but right to consult with them, because the jewels would be a part of their inheritance, and I wish you two to have some say about it also, as fellow heirs with them.""""No; you and your future wives should have a share also,"" she replied smilingly; ""that is if I retained them all. And that being understood, are you willing to have most of them disposed of and the proceeds used in aid of home and foreign missions?""""A few of my jewels, dear to me as mementoes of the past, I shall retain; also a few others which would not sell for nearly what they are really worth to us; but the rest I intend to have sold and the money used for the spread of the gospel in our own and heathen lands.""""Yes, you are right,"" she returned, ""it is an investment; one that can not possibly fail to give a grand return: for does He not say, 'He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth to the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again?'""And you do like the security, mamma; you prefer it to any other, I am quite sure,"" said Herbert. ""But what a fine specimen of a charity sermon that was! both powerful and brief. Doubtless many of the hearers were greatly relieved that they had not to listen to a long, dull harangue on the subject, and all the more disposed to give liberally on that account.""""And let us not forget the lesson of the text when the appeal comes to us,"" added their mother. ""Oh my dear boys, what a privilege it is to be permitted to make such investments! and to be sowers of the good seed whether by personal effort or in providing the means for sending out others as laborers. Let us endeavor to be of the number of those who sow largely in both ways; for 'He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.'""And the harvest is sure; at the end of the world; if not sooner. And whether we give in one way or the other, let us not do it 'grudgingly or of necessity,' but joyfully and with all our hearts, for God loveth a cheerful giver."""
"""I'd be a queer girl, papa, if I didn't appreciate such a home as this is,"" she returned with warmth, and smiling up into his face. ""Don't you say so, Max?"" catching sight of her brother who, riding his pony, had arrived some minutes ahead of the carriage and was now petting and fondling his dog at the farther end of the hall.""And I too,"" said Violet; ""he is a very acceptable addition to the family. My dear, home does look exceedingly attractive to me, as well as to the children. But little Elsie's eyes are closing; mamma must see her babies to bed.""Outside the night was cold, but within the house the atmosphere was that of summer; doors stood open, and in the halls, and the rooms used by the family, lights were burning; also the air was sweet and fragrant with a faint odor of roses, heliotrope and mignonette, coming from the conservatory and from vases of cut flowers placed here and there; all the result of Capt. Raymond's kind forethought for the comfort and pleasure of wife and children, and the careful carrying out of his orders by the faithful housekeeper Christine.""Oh! and there is my pussy lying on the rug all curled up like a soft round ball!"" added Grace. ""You are having a nice nap, pretty kitty, and I don't mean to wake you, but I must pet you just a little bit,"" dropping down beside her, and gently stroking the soft fur.Then seating herself on a hassock, ""Now put your head in my lap and stretch yourself out on the rug. You can rest nicely that way and we'll have a good talk. Such a nice, big, soft rug as this is! I should think it must have taken several big sheep skins to make it, and it was so good in papa to have it put here for us.""""Yes, O Gracie, if I were only good like you and didn't ever do and say naughty things that make him feel sad!"" sighed Lulu. ""Oh do you know we are going to have a party on New Years? All the folks that were at Ion are to come; the grown up ones to be papa's and Mamma Vi's company, and the young ones your's and Maxie's and mine.""He was smiling on his darlings, thinking what a pretty picture they made--the little slender figure on the rug with the kitten closely cuddled in its arms, the golden head lying in Lulu's lap, while her blooming face bent tenderly over it, one hand toying with its soft ringlets.He closed his book as they entered, rose and wheeled an easy chair nearer the fire for his father, who took it with a pleasant ""Thank you, my son,"" and drew Lulu to a seat upon his knee. ""What were you reading, Max?"" he asked.""If I were quite sure you were called of God to the work, I should rather see you a preacher of the gospel, an ambassador for Christ, than anything else. Yet if you lack the talent, or consecration, you would better be out of the ministry than in it.""For some moments no one spoke again, then Lulu remarked thoughtfully, ""This is the last Saturday, and to-morrow will be the last Sunday of the old year. Papa, do you remember the talk we had together a year ago?""""On the last Sunday of that year? yes, daughter, quite well. And now it is time for another retrospect, and fresh resolutions to try to live better, by the help of Him who is the Strength of His people, their Shield and Helper."""
"""Yet an improvement upon the one before it, I think,"" remarked her father in a tone of encouragement. ""You have not, so far as I know, indulged, even once, in a fit of violent anger--and knowing my little girl as most truthful and very open with me--I certainly believe that if she had been in a passion she would have come to me with an honest confession of her fault.""""No; I haven't been in a passion, papa, and I hope if I had, I wouldn't have been deceitful enough to try to hide it from you. But oh I've been very, very naughty two or three times in other ways, you know; and you were so good to forgive me and keep on loving me in spite of it all.""""It is a shell-fish of which there are numerous species exhibiting great variety of form and color. The common limpet is most abundant on the rocky coasts of Britain. They live on the rocks between low and high tide marks.""They move about when the water covers them, but when the tide is out, remain firmly fixed to one spot; so firmly that unless surprised by a sudden seizure, it is almost impossible to drag or tear them from the rock without breaking the shell.""""Yes, they have mouths and they live on seaweed, eating it by means of a long ribbon-like tongue covered with rows of hard teeth; the common limpet--which, as I have told you, lives on the British coast--has no fewer than one hundred and sixty rows, twelve teeth in a row. How many does that make, Max?""""Those of some of the limpets of warmer climates are very beautiful,"" he answered; ""large too. I have seen them on the western coast of South America, a foot wide; so large that they are often used as basins.""""God is often spoken of in the Scriptures as his people's rock, because he is their strength, their refuge, their asylum, as the rocks were in those places whither the children of Israel retired in case of an unexpected attack from their foes.""Jesus is the rock on which we must build our hope of salvation; any other foundation will be as the sand upon which the foolish man built his house; 'and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell; and great was the fall of it.'""The limpet is wiser; it never trusts to the shifting sand, but holds firmly to the immovable rock. Be like it in resisting all attempts whether of human or spiritual foes, to drag you from your Rock.""""Papa,"" said Max, slowly and with some hesitation. ""I wish to do so--I think it is my settled purpose--but I--I feel afraid that sometime I may let go. I'm a careless, heedless fellow you know, and--and I'm afraid I may forget to hold fast to Jesus, and be overcome by some sudden and great temptation.""""There is danger of that, my boy,"" the captain returned with feeling, ""yet I should have greater fear for you if I heard you talk in a self-confident and boasting spirit. Trusting in ourselves we are not safe, but trusting in Jesus we are. We are safe only while we cling to our sure foundation, the Rock Christ Jesus; but our greatest security is in the joyful fact that he holds us fast and will never let us go; if we have indeed given ourselves to him.""Yes, words that have been an untold comfort and support to many of God's dear children on their way Zionward. The sword of the Spirit with which they have fought Satan's lying assertion that they might yet be lost in spite of having fled for refuge to Him who died on Calvary.""""Not those alone, but _all_ the word of God. And in order to be prepared to wield that sword we must store our memories with the word, we must hide it in our hearts. David says, 'Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.'""Christ is our pattern; we must strive to follow his example in all things; and it was with the sword of the Spirit he repelled every temptation of the devil there in the wilderness--beginning each reply to the evil suggestions with 'It is written.'""""And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.""""I do,"" he replied, ""and I want my children to follow my example in that. In the eleventh chapter of the same book the command is repeated and these words are added, 'That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.'"
"""To our great content,"" added her husband, gently putting Lulu off his knee and rising to give his wife a seat, while Max sprang up and gallantly placed a chair for her; selecting the most comfortable and placing it close beside his father's.""Papa,"" she said, nestling close in his arms. ""I have been thinking more about the kind of year this has been to me, and oh I think I must always remember it as a good one because in it I have learned to love Jesus! I know I have done some very wrong things even since I begun to try to be his servant,"" she went on, hanging her head in shame and contrition, ""but O papa I do love him and want to serve him all my life! How glad I am that he is so loving and forgiving, and that he says he will never let any one pluck me out of his hand!""""Remember that we are to be good soldiers of Jesus Christ, and that we have a great battle to fight with the evil that is in our own hearts, the snares of the world, and the powers of darkness;--Satan and his hosts of wicked spirits whose great desire and aim is to ruin our souls and drag us down to the dreadful place prepared for them.""""'I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord!'""She had enjoyed having her friends about her and seeing the hilarity of the children and youth. She was still youthful in her feelings and full of an ever ready sympathy with the young, none of whom could know without loving her, while to all who could claim kin with her--especially her children and grandchildren, she was an object of devoted affection; affection fully reciprocated by her.Yet there were times when her spirit craved exclusive companionship with her nearest and dearest; other seasons when she would be alone with Him whom her ""soul desired above all earthly joy and earthly love.""An hour had been spent in secret communion with Him ere Rosie and Walter came for the half hour of Bible study and prayer in mamma's dressing room, before breakfast, to which they had been accustomed since their earliest recollection.And not they only but their older brothers and sisters before them, every one of whom had very tender memories connected with that short service; memories that had been a safeguard to them in times of temptation, a comfort and support in the dark hours that sooner or later come to all the sons and daughters of Adam, and made them feel it even yet a privilege to participate, when circumstances would permit.Sometimes Edward and Zoe joined the little circle, and Harold and Herbert seldom failed to do so when at home. They all did so this morning and with an enjoyment that made the allotted time seem far too short.The afternoon and evening were given to reading, conversation and music suited to the sacredness of the day; then all retired to peaceful slumbers, from which they rose in the morning rested and refreshed in body and mind, and ready to enter with zest upon the labors and pleasures of the new week.According to the arrangements made the previous week the whole Ion family, and all who had been guests there at that time, repaired to Fairview at an early hour, where they spent the day together in social festivities similar to those with which they had enlivened their stay with Grandma Elsie.Harold and Herbert gave a magic lantern exhibition, some charades were acted, and Cousin Ronald contrived to add not a little to the fun by timely efforts in his own peculiar line; the very little ones were delighted to hear their toy dogs bark, roosters crow, hens and geese cackle, ducks quack, horses neigh and donkeys bray.They could hardly believe that the sounds which seemed to come from the mouths of the toy animals were really made by Cousin Ronald, and when assured that such was the case, thought him a most wonderful man.I could not tell you how much they enjoyed their share of the planning and arranging, and the consultations together and with the older people, or how kindly indulgent the captain was to their wishes and fancies, never saying them nay when it was within his power to grant their request.Evelyn Leland loved to watch Lulu and Grace as they hung affectionately about their father, giving and receiving caresses and endearments; yet the sight often brought tears to her eyes--calling up tender memories of the past. She had not forgotten--she never could forget the dear parent who had been won't to lavish such caresses and endearments upon her, and at times her young heart ached with its longing to hear again the sound of his voice and feel the clasp of his arm, and his kisses upon cheek and lip and brow.""You are coming out in a new character, Eva--that of an adroit flatterer,"" returned Grandma Elsie, with a look of amusement; ""but I am not at all displeased, my dear child, because I credit it entirely to your affection, which I prize very highly,"" she hastened to add, seeing that her words had called up a blush of painful embarrassment on Eva's usually placid face.""Yes, of course,"" said Violet. ""Oh we'll make a group with mamma, grandpa, Sister Elsie and her little Ned, and call it a picture of four generations. If dear old grandpa were with us still we could make it five.""""The first Christmas and New Years of which I retain a vivid remembrance, were those of the first winter after I had made the acquaintance of my dear father; for, as I believe you all know, I never saw him till I was eight years old.""And you hadn't at all a nice New Year's that time, mamma,"" said Rosie, softly stroking and patting the hand she held, then lifting it to her lips; for she was sitting on a stool at her mother's feet, while the others had grouped themselves around her, ""suffering so with that sprained ankle.""""Ah there you are mistaken, my child,"" Grandma Elsie answered with her own sweet smile, ""for I had a most enjoyable day in spite of the injury that kept me a prisoner in my room; my father brought me a beautiful doll-baby, quite as large as some live ones that I have seen, and a quantity of pretty things to be used in its adornment. My little friends and I had a merry, happy time cutting out garments and making them up.""My Christmas gifts were beautiful; from papa books and a pearl necklace and bracelets--now the property of my daughter Rosie""--smiling down at Rosie as she spoke--""and a ring to match from him who was afterward my beloved husband; also books from his mother and my Aunt Adelaide. They were our guests at dinner that day."
"""Between breakfast and dinner I had the pleasure of distributing gifts among the house servants and the negroes at the quarter; then a ride with papa; and the evening, till my early bedtime, was spent sitting on his knee.""""My dear, indulgent father would have done so, had I been able to bear the fatigue,"" Grandma Elsie replied, ""but at that time I was quite feeble from a severe illness. He did not think me strong enough to visit the stores, but ordered goods sent out to the Oaks for me to select from, which gave me nearly as much enjoyment us I could have found in going to the city in search of them.""""But when New Year's morning came and the presents had not been sent, I began to feel decidedly uneasy, and papa evidently perceived it; though neither of us said a word on the subject that was uppermost in my mind.""Papa had some beautiful books and pictures for me which he gave me before breakfast, saying he hoped they would help me pass the day pleasantly; he would be glad to make it the happiest New Year I had known yet.""He smiled tenderly upon me as he said it, then held me close in his arms and kissed me over and over again; and I returned his kisses, putting my arms about his neck and hugging him as tight as I could.""As we were about starting I ventured to ask, 'Papa, haven't you forgotten to send my presents to Pinegrove?' He smiled and said, 'No, my darling,' in a very pleasant tone, but that was all, and when we came back I noticed that the presents were still in a closet in my dressing room where they had lain ever since they were bought.""Mammy arranged my hair and dress, and I went back to the parlor where papa was sitting reading. He laid aside his book as soon as I entered the room, took me on his knee, and began telling me funny stories that kept me laughing till a carriage drove up to the door.""Yes, very; they had all come to spend the day; I had the pleasure of presenting my gifts in person and of seeing that they were fully appreciated; we played quiet games and papa told us lovely stories. There was no fretting or quarrelling, everybody was in high good humor, and when the time came to separate, my guests all bade good bye, saying, 'they had never had a more enjoyable day.'""""I am thinking of those little friends of mine,"" sighed their mother; ""asking myself 'Where are they now?' Ah what changes life brings! how short and hasty it is, and how soon it will be over! I mean the life in this world.""It is likened in the Bible to a pilgrimage, a tale that is told, a flower that soon withers or is cut down by the mower's scythe, a dream, a sleep, a vapor, a shadow, a handbreadth; a thread cut by the weaver.""""Yes,"" returned her mother, furtively wiping away a tear, ""and calling to mind the dreadful scenes of the war that followed some years later, and the sore trials that resulted in the Carrington family--I feel that he was taken away from the evil to come.""Of the others forming that little company Flora Arnott too died young. Mary Leslie married and moved away, and I have lost sight of her for many years. Carrie Howard lived to become a wife and mother, but was called away from earth years ago. The same words would tell Isabel Carleton's story.""Lucy Carrington and I are the only ones left, and she, like myself, has children and grandchildren. I hear from her now and then, and we meet occasionally when I go North or she pays a visit to the old home at Ashlands.""""No, my son; my father--your grandpa--and I were living alone together at that time. The next summer we went North, and while there visited at Elmgrove, Mr. Allison's country seat, which gave papa and Miss Rose an opportunity to become quite well acquainted.""Yes,"" she answered; ""it was a particularly enjoyable time, for we had our cousins--Mildred and Annis Keith--with us. Mildred, though, had become Mrs. Landreth, and had her husband and baby boy with her.""Annis was a dear, lovable little girl just about my own age. They spent the winter at the Oaks, Annis sharing both my studies and my sports. We had a Christmas party, our guests remaining through the rest of the week."""
"""Oh mamma, do please go on and tell the whole story of that Christmas, and all the good times you had that winter,"" pleaded Rosie. ""I have always enjoyed it so much, and I'm sure Eva and Lulu and Gracie will.""But as my young readers have already had the story in Mildred's Married Life, I shall not repeat it here. Suffice it to say it seemed to greatly interest all her listeners, and Lulu gathered from it a far different impression of Mr. Dinsmore, as a father, from that she had derived from tales told her by some of the old servants in the family connection.They had given her the idea that he was exceedingly stern and tyrannical, but his daughter painted him as a most loving and indulgent parent. Mayhap the truth lay somewhere between the two pictures, for as he himself had often said, Elsie was ever won't to look upon him through rose colored glasses.""You did have a very nice time, Grandma Elsie! I could almost wish I'd been in your place,"" exclaimed Lulu, when the tale had come to an end. ""But no I don't, either, for then I couldn't be my father's child,"" putting her arm round the captain's neck and laying her cheek to his, ""and to belong to him is better than anything else!""""Or any other of your children, papa,"" added Grace from her seat on his knee, affectionately stroking his face with her small white hand as she spoke. ""Grandma Elsie, won't you please go on and tell about other Christmases that you remember?""""I think, my dear, I have done my full share of story telling for one evening,"" replied Mrs. Travilla pleasantly. ""It is your father's turn now, as the next in age. Captain, will you not favor us with some of your reminiscences of former holiday experiences? or of something else if you prefer. I know you are a famous story teller.""""Hardly,"" his father answered with a slight smile; ""You are all too young to be allowed to lose so large a portion of your night's rest. To do so would spoil all the anticipated pleasure of to-morrow.""""Lulu, shall I say good night to you first?"" he asked, smiling down at his eldest daughter, standing by his side; ""as you have Eva with you, you will perhaps not care for the usual bit of good night chat with your father?""""I knew you wouldn't want me to,"" said Lulu; ""you are always so kind and thoughtful for others; and though papa sometimes gives me a quarter of an hour or more, when we have a great deal to say to each other, I think he won't stay more than a minute or two to-night! so that it won't keep me long away from you.""""Oh please don't hurry for my sake,"" said Eva, adding softly, ""You know I, too, shall be glad of a few minutes alone with my best Friend. So if you like, I will go into the little tower room while your papa is with you.""""Yes,"" returned Lulu, her face lighting up with pleasure, ""I think it so myself. Our dear father is constantly adding pretty things here and there to our room, and doing oh so much to make his children happy! Yet, would you believe it, Eva? I am sometimes both ill-tempered and disobedient to him.""""Yes,"" Lulu replied in a low, remorseful tone, her eyes downcast, her face flushing painfully; ""only last month, one day Max was teasing me and I was in very bad humor, so answered him very crossly. Papa happened to be in the next room and overheard it all, and called to us both to come to him. His voice sounded stern, and I felt angry and rebellious. Max, never does feel so, I believe, anyway he's always obedient, and he went at once, but I waited to be called a second time, and--O Eva, I'm dreadfully, dreadfully ashamed! but I feel as if I must tell you because I can't bear to have you think me so much better than I am."""
"""Dear Lu, don't tell it if it hurts you so. I'm sure if you were not a good girl you wouldn't feel so very sorry and ashamed,"" Evelyn interrupted, putting both arms round her friend and kissing her with warmth of affection.""No, indeed, I'm not!"" said Lulu; ""and I'll tell it, if only to punish myself for my badness. Papa has never punished me for it, though I really did wish he would and asked him to over and over again.""""I did,"" acknowledged Lulu, her head hanging still lower and her cheek flushing more hotly. ""You see when I lived with Aunt Beulah I got into the way of being very saucy to her, and I suppose that's how I came to speak so to papa. Oh don't you think I ought to be dreadfully ashamed, and that papa should have punished me very severely?""""I suppose he is the best judge of that,"" Eva answered, doubtfully. ""But what did he do? Surely he didn't pass it over as of no consequence? I think he couldn't feel it right to allow his own child to refuse obedience to his commands.""""No; of course not. The minute I'd said the words I could have bitten my tongue off for it. I hoped papa hadn't heard, but he had, and he rose from his chair and came toward me (very quietly; not at all as if he was in a passion), and I jumped up, saying 'I will, papa; I'm coming.'""""Then he said in a tone as if he were grieved and astonished that his own little girl could talk so to him--'Tardy obedience following upon a most insolent refusal to obey,' and took my hand and led me to the side of his chair.""He said he must punish me, but he would try a new way, and for four days I shouldn't be his child at all--at least not be treated like it, but just as if I were only a little girl visitor; he wouldn't give me any orders, or advice, or direction, or instruction; and I mustn't take any liberty with him that I wouldn't feel free to take with a stranger gentleman.""He didn't give me one cross word or even look, but he didn't invite me to sit on his knee, and I didn't dare do so; he didn't call me pet names and hug me up in his arms, as he so often does when I haven't been naughty, and I couldn't wait on him as I always love to do; he wouldn't let me do the least thing for him. I just felt as if I wasn't one of the family at all, and would ten times rather have had the hardest of whippings; at least so far as the pain was concerned.""""Yes, of course; it wouldn't have been half so hard to bear. At least I can imagine that to be made to feel yourself only a stranger in your father's house would be a great deal worse than having to endure quite severe bodily pain. So I think you may feel that you have been punished.""""Not so severely as I deserve,"" returned Lulu, shaking her head and sighing; ""no not half. There, I can hear Gracie calling me to say good-night. Excuse me while I run into her room for a few minutes.""""That was right,"" he replied, sitting down and drawing her to his knee; ""one could hardly end the old year, or begin the new, in a better way than by the study of God's word. Well, has my little daughter anything particular to say to her father to-night?""""Only that I wish I'd been a better daughter to you, papa, and that I hope I shall be this--no next year: the year that's to begin in a few hours. I do hope that when its last night comes you can say, 'My daughter Lulu hasn't been once disobedient or in a passion for a whole year.'""""It will be a very happy thing for me--for us both--if I can,"" he said, ""and I am not without hope that it may be so. But my dear child, you will need constant watchfulness lest your besetting sins overcome you when you least expect it."""
"""I am very glad of that! and that God gave me such a good Christian father to help me in my hard fight! And, papa, I must tell you again that I am very, very sorry and ashamed because of my naughtiness last month.""""Dear child, my dear humble penitent little girl!"" he said tenderly, ""it was all long since fully and freely forgiven. Now good night, my darling; and good bye till next year,"" he added in playful tone, kissing her fondly over and over again, ""unless something unforeseen should make you want your father before morning. In that case you will not have far to run to find him.""""Oh no; and it makes me glad always at night to remember that you are so near, and the doors all open between our rooms, so that you could hear me if I should call out to you, papa. I know you wouldn't be displeased at being wakened if I were in trouble and needed you.""""But let your greatest rejoicing be in the thought that you and I and all of us are under the care of Him who neither slumbers nor sleeps. 'It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.'""""And you are going to be satisfied with one?"" her mother asked letting the book fall into her lap, while she laid one hand gently on her young daughter's head and gazed tenderly down into the blooming face; with a somewhat sad expression too, Rosie thought.""I say, no to that, mamma,"" she returned, laying her head in her mother's lap and taking into her own the hand that had been resting on it, to press it again and again to her lips with ardent affection, ""for I shall not be satisfied with less than half a dozen.""""Mamma!"" she exclaimed in concerned surprise, ""you are crying! What can be the matter? have I said or done anything to grieve you, dear heart?"" reaching up an arm to clasp her mother's neck, while she scanned the loved features with earnest, tender scrutiny.For a minute or more there was no reply. Then Elsie said, in moved tones, softly smoothing the hair back from Rosie's temples as she spoke, and gazing tenderly down into her eyes, ""My heart is sad for you, my darling, because, while another year is rapidly drawing to a close, I have yet no reason to hope that you have sought a refuge within the fold of the good Shepherd who gives to his sheep eternal life; the dear Saviour who has been all these years inviting you to come to him and be saved.""""Old enough to have become a disciple of Jesus years ago,"" her mother said in sorrowful tones. ""O my darling, give him the best years of your life; the whole of your life, whether it be long or short. Is he not worthy of it?""""Yes, mamma; surely there can be only one answer to that and I do mean to--to try to turn over a new leaf with the coming of the new year. But, mamma, I know of a number of good Christians who didn't begin to be such till they were many years older than I am. There is grandpa for one.""""Yes, my child,"" sighed her mother, ""but he has always deeply regretted having so long delayed beginning the Christian course--entering the service of the dear Master whom now he loves better than wife or child or any created being. There are many reasons, my darling, why delay is both dangerous and unwise as well as basely ungrateful.""""Yes, and of the continuance of health and reason. How many have been suddenly overtaken by fatal illness that at once robbed them of the power to think, so that if preparation for the solemn realities of another world had not been already made, the opportunity for so doing was forever lost!"
"""While it is a precious truth that all who finally repent and accept of Christ as their only Saviour, will inherit eternal life--a life of holiness and unspeakable happiness at God's right hand,"" answered her mother, ""yet there will be a difference in the portions of those who have spent many years in the faithful service of the Master--using their time and talents for the advancement of his cause and kingdom, and striving to win others to know and serve him, and themselves to grow in grace and conformity to his likeness and his will--and that of others who have been saved only at the last and so as by fire. All will be perfectly happy but some will have a greater capacity for happiness than others.""'Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?... Riches and honor are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver!""Rosie, my darling, it is the dearest wish of my heart to see you engaged in that work; but you cannot teach others what you do not know yourself; you must first give your heart to God and learn for yourself the sweetness of his love. Will you not do it now? at once? Oh listen to his gracious invitation, 'Give me thine heart.'""For some moments a deep and solemn hush seemed to fill the room, Rosie still kneeling there with her head pillowed on her mother's breast, Elsie's heart going up in an almost agonizing petition for her child.""Mamma,"" she said in low tremulous tones, ""I have tried to do it; I have asked the Lord to forgive all my sins, to cleanse me from mine iniquities, and to take me for his very own; and I think he has heard and granted my petition.""You know when the leper came to him saying, 'Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean,' Jesus at once put forth his hand and touched him saying, 'I will; be thou clean'; and immediately the leprosy departed from him. Mamma, I have been praying the leper's prayer, and I think the dear Lord Jesus has said the same words to me.""""I am sure of it,"" Elsie said with emotion, ""for he is the unchangeable God; 'Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever'; as ready to be moved with compassion for a sin-sick soul to-day, as he was for the leper when on earth. And he has said, 'Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.'""""Oh just hear her!"" cried Lulu in delight. ""Papa must have been teaching her that, or having somebody else do it, while we were away. I think she's going to make a great deal of fun for us all. Happy New Year to you, Eva dear,"" giving her friend a hug, as they lay side by side in the bed.""The same to you, dear Lu,"" returned Eva. ""How nice it is to be here with you lying on this easy couch with this down cover and these soft blankets over us. I never lay on a more delightful bed. Everything about it is beautiful and luxurious too.""""Papa was very particular to get the very best of springs and mattresses for all our beds,"" replied Lulu. ""Oh but he is a dear, good father, always careful for the comfort and happiness of all his children!""""Oh yes indeed! I'm quite sure no man could take better care of his wife, or be more loving and kind to her, than papa is to Mamma Vi. And I'm pretty sure he was just the same to my mother; he says he loved her very dearly and loves his children--I mean Max and Gracie and me--because they were hers as well as because they are his very own."""
"""I'll light the gas in the sitting-room, and give her a cracker to stop her screaming,"" said Lulu, getting out of bed and feeling about for her warm slippers and dressing gown. ""Then I'll run and catch papa and Gracie.""""Sleeping in my bed as I have a right to, Miss Saucebox,"" returned Lulu, laughing as she opened a cupboard door and brought out a paper of crackers. ""There, take that and see if you can hold your tongue till folks are ready to get up.""The bird took the offered cracker and began eating it, standing on one foot, on its perch, and holding the food in the claws of the other, while it bit off a little at a time, Lulu looking on with interest.She did so, saying to herself, ""I just know it's no use, for I was never wider awake in my life,"" but to her great astonishment the next thing she knew it was broad daylight and Eva up and brushing out her hair before the mirror over the bureau.""Oh, you've had a nice nap and will feel the better for it all day, I'm sure,"" returned Eva laughing in a kindly way; ""and that is your reward for trying to do as your papa probably wished you to. But need you hurry so? isn't it a good while to breakfast time?""""Yes,"" sighed Lulu, ""but papa says if she should hear angry, passionate, or willful words from my lips she may learn and repeat them to my shame and sorrow. But oh I hope I never shall let her hear such!""""I don't believe you ever will say such words any more, dear Lu,"" Eva said with an affectionate look into her friend's face. ""I don't believe you have ever been in a passion since--since the time that little Elsie had that sad fall.""""No, I have not been in a rage, but I have said some angry words a few times, and oh--as you must remember that I told you--some very rebellious and insolent ones to my dear papa--not so long ago. Oh dear, I'm afraid my tongue can never be tamed!""Papa made me learn that third chapter of James that says 'the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity and that no man can tame it.' Then he talked to me so nicely and kindly about learning to rule my tongue and make it always speak as it ought--wise, kind, pleasant words. And he told me the only way to do it was by getting my heart right--by God's help--because, as the Bible tells us in another place, it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaketh.""""Yes, yes, indeed!"" returned Lulu, with warmth; ""all his children, but especially me, I think, because I'm the naughtiest and have the hardest work trying to be good. I'm often surprised at papa's patience with me and the trouble he takes to help me in my hard fight with my passionate, wilful temper.""""Why, yes, sir?"" opening it. ""Oh, oh, it isn't empty!"" she laughed, beginning to take out the contents--two clean, crisp one dollar notes, and a handful of bright new quarters, dimes and five cent pieces. ""Papa, how kind and generous you are to me!""Grace had her purse open by this time and found it lined in like manner with Lulu's. ""Dear papa, thank you ever so much,"" she said, looking up into his face with eyes full of love and gratitude. ""It's a great deal for me to have beside all the rest you gave me.""""Eva, my dear,"" turning to her, ""you will find the same in yours, and I hope will accept it from me as though you were one of my daughters. Do me the kindness to let me be in some respects, a father to you; since your own is absent in the happy home to which I trust we are all traveling."""
"She was standing near, the present he had given her in her hand. She had been looking from it to Lulu and Grace, thinking the while how good it was in the captain to treat her so much like one of his own, and now at these kind words spoken in tender fatherly tones, both heart and eyes grew full to overflowing.He saw that she could not speak for emotion, and taking her hand, drew her to his knee and kissed her, saying, ""Don't try to thank me in words, my dear; your speaking countenance tells me all you would say.""Each had a gift to show, for all had been remembered in that way by either the captain or Violet, some by both, and each one had received or did now receive, something from Grandma Elsie--a book, toy or game.Shortly after breakfast--almost before the children had done with comparing and talking about their presents--the other guests began to arrive, and by ten o'clock everybody who had been invited was there.The picture suggested by Violet was taken first. In it Grandma Elsie was seated between her father on one side, and her namesake daughter on the other, Mrs. Leland having her babe in her arms, while little Ned leaned confidingly against his great-grandfather's knee.The captain and Violet, with their two little ones, made another pretty picture. Then the captain was taken again with his older three grouped about him. Then Grandma Elsie again with her son Edward and his Zoe, standing behind her, Rosie and Walter one on each side.It was then proposed that the other members of the company should be taken in turn--singly or in groups;--but all declined, expressing a decided preference for spending the time in a more amusing manner, such as forming tableaux and acting charades.""Oh it's a spelling school--all of girls!"" remarked Grace in a low aside to her little friend Rosie Lacey; they two having chosen a place among the spectators rather than with the actors on this occasion.""Ah, ha! ah ha! um h'm! mis-con,"" murmured Cousin Ronald, half-aloud; ""vara weel done, lads and lasses. What's the next syllable? strue? Ah ha, um h'm! we shall see presently,"" as the books were closed and the young actors vanished through the door into the hall.They were all laughing as at something very amusing, and after entering the room did nothing but sit or stand about laughing all the time; fairly shaking with laughter, laughing, laughing till the tears came into their eyes, and the older people joined in without in the least knowing the exciting cause of so much mirth.Maud, dressed as a huckster, had a basket filled with apples, oranges, nuts and candies. Sydney, wearing an old cloak and straw hat, had a basket on her arm in which were needles, tapes, buttons, pins, and other small wares such as are often hawked about the streets.Some of the girls now joined the spectators, while Harold drew out a little stand, and he, Chester, and Herbert seated themselves about it with paper and pencils before them, assuming a very business-like air.""Yes, sir; I heered tell ye was wantin' a superior kind o' male man to take the school fer the winter, and bein' as I was out o' a job, I thought I mout as well try my hand at that as enny thin' else.""""My name, sir, is Peter Bones, and I come from the town o' Hardtack in the next county; jest beyant the hill yander. I've a good eddication o' me own, too, though I never rubbed my back agin a college,"" remarked the applicant, sitting down and tilting his chair back on its hind legs, retaining his balance by holding on to the one occupied by Herbert. ""I kin spell the spellin' book right straight through, sir, from kiver to kiver.""""Wall now, I don't jist remember,"" returned the applicant, thrusting both hands deep into his pockets and gazing down meditatively at the carpet, ""somewheres 'bout 1860, wuzn't it? no, come to think, I guess 'twas '63."""
"""Ah, ah! ah, ah! um h'm, um h'm! so I should say,"" soliloquized Mr. Lilburn, leaning on his goldheaded cane and watching the four lads as they scattered and left the room; ""and so this is the end of act the first, I suppose. Miss, miss, miss, ah that's the syllable that begins the new word.""Evelyn now came in with an umbrella in her hand, Grace and Rose Lacey walking a little in her rear. Evelyn raised the umbrella and turning to the little girls, said pleasantly, ""Come under, children, I can't keep the rain off you unless you are under the umbrella."" They accepted the invitation and the three moved slowly back and forth across the room several times.A storm of applause, and cries of ""Well done, little ones! Very prettily done indeed!"" and Gracie, rosy with blushes, came out from her retreat and ran to hide her face on her father's shoulder, while he held her close with one arm, softly smoothing her curls with the other hand.""Why you should feel proud and happy, Gracie,"" said Zoe, drawing near. ""We are going to have that tableau now in which you are to be a little flower girl. So come, won't you? and let me help you dress.""After dinner Harold and Herbert gave an exhibition of tricks of legerdemain, which even the older people found interesting and amusing. The little ones were particularly delighted with a marvellous shower of candy that ended the performance.But at an early hour the whole company, led by Grandpa Dinsmore, united in a short service of prayer, praise, and the reading of the scriptures, and at its close the guests bade good-bye and scattered to their homes.""And we have good times all the time since we have a home of our own with our dear father in it,"" remarked Grace, taking his hand and carrying it to her lips, while her sweet azure eyes looked up lovingly into his face.An emphatic endorsement of that sentiment from both Max and Lulu. Then the captain, smiling tenderly upon them, said, ""I dearly love to give you pleasure, my darlings, my heart's desire is for my children's happiness in this world and the next; but life can not be all play; so lessons must be taken up again to-morrow morning, and I hope to find you all in an industrious and tractable mood.""""These are my father's grounds,"" said Max, drawing himself up with a determined air, ""and we don't allow tramps and loafers here; so if you don't let go of that bridle and be off I'll set my dog on you. Here, Prince, Prince!""At the sound of the call, answered by a loud bark, and the sight of Prince's huge form making rapid bounds in his direction, the tramp released Fairy's bridle, and growling out an oath, turned and made his way with all celerity toward the public road, leaping the fence that separated it from Capt. Raymond's grounds, barely in time to escape Prince's teeth, as he made a dash to seize him by the leg.""Yes, papa,"" said Max; ""I'm afraid we went a little farther than we ought; at any rate it took us longer than we expected to reach home again; and we were detained a minute or two just now, out here in the grove, by a tramp that caught hold of Fairy's bridle and wouldn't let go till I called Prince and he showed his teeth.""""What! can it be possible?"" cried the captain closing his fingers more firmly over the hand Lulu had slipped into his, and gazing down into her face with a look of mingled concern and relief. ""It is well indeed that Lulu was not alone, and that Prince was at hand. Come into the library and tell me all about it."""
"Capt. Raymond sat down and drew Lulu to his side, putting an arm protectingly around her, while Max, standing near, went on to give the particulars of their encounter with the tramp, Lulu now and then putting in a word.""Yes; I am very glad I selected him as a Christmas gift to you,"" said his father. ""But now I must warn you both to say nothing to, or before Gracie, about this occurrence; for timid as she is, it would be apt to cause her much suffering from apprehension.""""That is right,"" he said. ""I think I can trust you not to forget or disobey. I know you would be loath to have your little sister tortured with nervous terrors. Now go and get yourselves ready for tea.""Lulu was full of excitement over her adventure, and through the evening found it difficult to refrain from speaking of it before Grace; but equally desirous to obey her father and to save her little sister from needless suffering, she resolutely put a curb upon her tongue till she found herself alone with him at bedtime.""I think it most probable he has walked on till he is miles away from here by this time,"" the captain answered. ""But even did we know him to be prowling round outside, we might rest and sleep in peace and security, assured that nothing can harm us without the will of our heavenly Father who loves us more than any earthly parent loves his child.""""Yes, papa, it makes me feel very safe to remember that, thinking how dearly you love me; so that I know you would never let anything harm me if you could help it,"" she returned, putting an arm round his neck and hugging him tight. ""Oh I am so glad that the Bible tells us that about God's love to us!""""'Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.' That is not a promise that God's faithful followers shall be rich in this world's goods, but faith in God's loving care makes life happy even in the midst of poverty and pain. Riches have not the power to make us happy, but the love of God has.""And those who begin to serve God in the morning of life and press onward and upward all their days, keeping near to Jesus and growing more and more like him, will be happier in heaven--because of their greater capacity for the enjoyment of God and holiness--than the saved ones who sought him late in life, or were less earnest in their endeavors to live in constant communion with him, and to bear more and more resemblance to him.""Papa,"" said Lulu earnestly, ""I want to be one of those; I want to live near to Jesus and grow every day more like him. (Oh I am so little like him now; sometimes I fear not at all). Won't you help me all you can?""""I will, my darling,"" he replied, speaking with emotion. ""Every day I ask wisdom from on high for that very work;--the work of helping you and all my dear children to be earnest, faithful servants of God.""She sat up in the bed and listened. She thought she heard a faint sound coming from the room below, and slipping from the bed she stole softly across the floor to the chimney, where there was a hot air flue beside the open fireplace.The chimney ran up between her bedroom and the little tower room opening into it; the library was under her bedroom, and opening from it was the ground floor room of the tower, which was very strongly built, had only the one door and very narrow slits of windows set high up in the thick stone walls.With that she crept into the tower room, softly opened the register there, and applied her ear to it. The sound of the file seemed a trifle louder and presently she was sure she heard gruff voices, though she could not distinguish the words.Her first impulse was to hurry to her father and tell him of her discovery; the second thought, ""If I do, papa will go down there and maybe they'll kill him; and that would be a great, great deal worse than if they should carry off everything in the house. I wish I could catch them myself and lock them in there before I wake papa. Why couldn't I?"" starting to her feet in extreme excitement; ""they're in the strong room, the bolt's on the library side of the door, and probably they've left the key there, too, in the lock. If I'm going to try to do it, the sooner the better. I'll ask God to show me how and help me."""
"She could gain the library by a door opening into a back hall and very near that into the strong room, whose door, if open, would be in a position to conceal her approach from the burglars till she could step behind it; so that her scheme seemed not impracticable.Her heart beat very fast as the thought occurred to her that there might be an accomplice in the library or hall, or that the door from the one into the other might creak and bring the miscreants rushing out upon her before she could accomplish the task she had set herself.""Well what if they should, Lulu Raymond?"" she asked, shutting her teeth hard together, ""'twouldn't be half so bad as if they should harm your father. You could be very well spared, but he couldn't; Mamma Vi, Max and Gracie would break their hearts if anything dreadful happened to him, and so would you too; I'll try, trusting to God to take care of me.""With swift, noiseless steps she passed out of her room, down a back stairway into the hall just spoken of, and gained the library door, finding it, to her great joy, wide enough open for her to slip in without touching it.She could see nothing there; the room was quite dark; but the sounds she had heard were still going in the strong room, seeming a little louder now. The men must be in there at work on the safe; with the door ajar, for a streak of light at the back between it and the jamb, told her it was not quite shut.She crept to it and peeping in at that crack, saw a man down on his knees working at the lock of the safe, while another stood close beside him, holding a dark lantern, open, so that the rays of light fell full and strongly upon the lock his confederate was trying to break.Lulu could not see the face of the latter, his back being toward her, but as the other bent forward for a moment, to watch the progress of the work, the light fell on his face, and she instantly recognized him as the tramp who had seized Fairy's bridle in the wood.Trembling like a leaf she put up her hand and cautiously felt for the bolt; holding tight to it and exerting all her strength, she suddenly slammed the door to and shot it into its socket. She heard the villains drop their tools, spring toward and try the door with muttered oaths and curses; but she waited to feel for the key and turn it in the lock; even to pull it out and thrust it into the pocket of her gown, as a swift thought came to her, that there might be an accomplice lurking about who would release them if she left it there.""No, papa, not a bit; I've locked them in there and here's the key,"" putting it into his hand. ""I slammed the door to on them. I shot the bolt too, and I don't think they can get out. But what will we do? Papa, can you get somebody to help you take them to jail?""""I can not wait at this moment to explain matters my love,"" the captain said hastily picking up Lulu and putting her in the place in the bed which he had just vacated. ""I must act, leaving Lulu to tell you her story.""""Hello!"" the captain called: then in another moment, ""Capt. Raymond of Woodburn, wants the sheriff,"" they heard him say. ""Ah are you there Mr. Wright? Burglars in the house. Burglars here. We have them fast, locked into the room with the safe they were trying to break open. Send a constable and several men to help him, as promptly as you can.""""Do not be alarmed, my dear,"" he said, as he hastily threw on his clothes: ""I really think there is no cause for apprehension, but I must hurry down to admit the servants (whether the burglars have left a door open or not, I do not know), see in what condition things are in the lower rooms, and keep guard over my prisoners till the sheriff or constable and his men arrive.""Violet sprang from the bed and went with swift, noiseless steps into the nursery. All was quiet there, children and nurse soundly sleeping. She retraced her steps and went on into Grace's room, where the two little girls were lying together in the bed, locked in each other's arms. Grace trembling with fear, Lulu bravely struggling with her own excitement and trying to calm and soothe her little sister."
"""O Mamma Vi, I'm so glad you've come!"" she exclaimed, as Violet drew near, then seated herself on the side of the bed, and bent down to kiss first the one and then the other, ""for Gracie is so frightened.""""Something waked me, Mamma Vi, and I heard them, and by listening a little I made sure where they were. At first I thought I'd run and call papa; but then I thought there are two of them if not more and papa is only one, so he would hardly have a chance in trying to fight them; but if I should slip quietly down and slam the door to and lock them in, it would save risking papa's life; and if they should catch me and kill me it wouldn't be half so bad as if they hurt papa.""The door into the back hall was far enough open to let me slip in without touching it, so that I did so without making any noise to attract their attention; then seeing by the light coming from the crack at the back of the strong room door, that they were in there, I crept close up and peeped in, and there they were; one down on his knees working at the lock of the safe, the other holding a lantern to give him light.""When I had watched them for a minute, I asked God again to help me; then I felt for the bolt and kept my hand on it while I, all of a sudden, pushed against the door with all my might and slammed it to, and shot the bolt in.""I'd hardly done it when I heard the men drop their tools and run to the door and try to get it open; saying dreadful words too, that frightened me. So I only waited to lock the door also before I started to run upstairs and on through the rooms till I got to papa.""And it was you who locked the burglars in?"" exclaimed Violet in astonishment. ""I've heard before now of women doing such things, but never of a little girl like you attempting it. You dear, brave, unselfish child! I am very, very proud of you!"" and she bent down again and kissed Lulu several times.The burglars, quite aware that their presence in the house was known, were making desperate efforts to escape, trying to force the lock or break down the door, at the same time cursing, and swearing in tones of concentrated fury.""Men,"" he said sternly, ""you are caught in a trap you have laid for yourselves, and escape is impossible; both lock and door are strong enough to resist your utmost efforts; therefore you may as well take matters quietly.""Finding their threats disregarded, they tried persuasion, appeals to his compassion--asserting that it was their first attempt to rob, and that they were driven to it by necessity--they and their families being in sore straits from extreme poverty--and promises to lead honest lives in future.""Ajax,"" he said sternly, ""you are lying to me! I know that your family are not in distress, and that you can make an honest living if you choose to be industrious and faithful to your employers. You were well paid here but lost your situation by inexcusable cruelty to dumb animals.""Since discharging you I have more than once supplied the wants of your wife and children; and this is your grateful return;--coming to rob me, bringing with you another, and perhaps more desperate villain than yourself.""""She undoubtedly did it,"" returned the captain, smiling at the man's evident amazement. ""She heard them at work with their tools, on the safe door, came softly down into this room, peeped at them through the crack behind the door there, and before they were aware of her vicinity, slammed it to and bolted and locked it on them.""At this moment Max appeared at the door opening from the library into the front hall; only half dressed and asking in much excitement, what was the matter? what was the meaning of the lights and the noises that had waked him?The door was then unfastened and the burglars stepped out only to be immediately handcuffed and carried away to prison, sullenly submitting to their arrest because they saw that resistance was useless.But before being taken from the house they were searched and the captain's watch found upon Ajax. He had evidently visited the dressing-room of his late master to obtain the key to the strong room door, and appropriated the watch at the same time.Max was greatly excited. ""Papa,"" he said, when the sheriff had departed with his prisoners, and doors and windows were again secured, ""we have had a narrow escape from serious loss; perhaps worse than that; for who knows but those fellows meant to murder us in our beds?"""
"""I think not, my son,"" replied the captain. ""I presume their only object was plunder, and that if they had succeeded in rifling the safe without discovery, they would have gone quietly away with their booty.""Yes,"" replied his father, placing a chair for Violet. ""I presume it will be a relief to you all to talk the matter over together with your mamma and me, and you will perhaps be more inclined for sleep afterward.""""I will,"" he said, doing as she requested. Then catching a longing look in Lulu's eyes, ""You may come too, daughter,"" he said. ""Slip on your dressing-gown and stand here by my side. I have an arm for you as well as one for Gracie.""""Oh yes, Max, I'm sure you would have done just the same,"" she returned, blushing with pleasure. ""And you see I preferred to do it, because I thought they might kill papa, and that would have been oh so much worse than being killed myself!"" clinging lovingly to her father, and hiding her face on his shoulder as she spoke.""I didn't have time to think about that, papa. I know you love me very much, and would be sorry to lose me--naughty as I often am--but you have other children, and I have only one father; so of course it would be a great deal worse for me to lose you, and all the rest to lose you too.""""Well,"" said the captain cheerfully, hugging both at once, ""we have escaped all the evils we have been talking of; our heavenly Father has taken care of us and has not suffered us to even lose our worldly goods, much less our lives; and we may well trust Him for the future and not fear what man can do unto us.""""Ajax! There, I was sure I heard Ajax's voice in the hall while the sheriff was here,"" cried Lulu. ""He must have been the one who was down on his knees trying to break the safe lock when I peeped in at the crack. I didn't see his face; but the other was a white man.""Then they all knelt while the captain asked in a few simple, earnest words that He who neither slumbers nor sleeps would be their shield, defending them from all evil, and that trusting in His protecting care they might be able to banish every fear and lay them down in peace and sleep.""Yes,"" he said, ""I wish you, children, to sleep on as long as you can, and if possible make up all you have lost by the visit of the burglars; it will not matter if you take your breakfast later than usual by even so much as an hour or two.""""I allowed myself the same privilege,"" he said pleasantly. ""We will have no school to-day, I have already been notified that there will be a preliminary examination of the prisoners, before the magistrate this morning, and that you, Lulu, and Max and I must attend as witnesses.""""My child, it is not I, but the law that insists,"" he said; ""but you need not feel disturbed over the matter; you have only to tell a straightforward story of what you heard and saw and did in connection with the attempted robbery.Taking up her Bible and opening it at the twenty-fourth psalm, he read, ""He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully, he shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.""Closing the book and laying it aside, ""My dear children,"" he said earnestly and with grave tenderness, ""you see how God hates lying and deceit; how sorely he will punish them if not repented of and forsaken. Speak the truth always though at the risk of torture and death; never tell a lie though it should be no more than to assert that two and two do not make four.""Papa,"" said Grace, sighing and hiding her blushing face on his shoulder, ""you know I did once say what was not true; but I'm very, very sorry. I've asked God many times to forgive me for Jesus' sake and I believe he has.""""No, it is not that I am better than you,"" was Lulu's emphatic dissent from that. ""It's only that I am not timid like you; if I had been, it's very likely I'd have told many an untruth to hide my faults and keep from being punished."""
"It was replied that several of them would do so shortly; Grandma Elsie among them, and that she would spend the day, keeping Violet company during her husband's absence at Union, if, as she supposed, Vi's preference should be for remaining at home.""Everything is in usual order, I see,"" Violet remarked, glancing about the hall, and in at the library door as they passed it; ""really the events of last night seem more like an unpleasant dream than actual occurrences.""""Captain, I am greatly interested in this affair,"" said Harold, shaking hands with his brother-in-law; ""indeed we all are for that matter, and Herbert and I propose going over to Union to be present at the examination of the prisoners.She shrank a little from the thought of facing the two desperados and testifying against them, but kept up her courage by thinking that both her heavenly Father and her earthly one would be with her to protect and help her; also by the remembrance of her papa's assurance that she need not feel disturbed; that all she had to do was to tell a plain straightforward, story:--""the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.""""I can do that,"" she said to herself; ""it will be quite easy; for I remember perfectly all about it. Those wicked men threatened papa that if he had them sent to jail they'd kill him some day when they are let out again, and I suppose they'll want to kill me too, for telling about it in court; but I know they can't do us any harm while God takes care of us. That must be the meaning of that verse in Proverbs I learned the other day.""I congratulate you, captain, upon being the father of a little girl who can show such unselfish courage,"" Grandma Elsie said with enthusiasm, her eyes shining with pleasure, ""I am proud of her myself; the dear, brave child!""""And so am I,"" said Violet; ""but of course,"" with a mischievous laughing glance into her husband's face, ""her father is not, but considers her a very ordinary specimen of childhood. Is not that so, my dear?""But at that moment the carriage was announced. Lulu came running down ready for her trip, her father handed her in, then seated himself and put his arm round her looking down into her face with a tenderly affectionate smile.""I'd a great deal rather have papa along, of course; anybody would want his intimate friend with him on such an occasion, and papa is my most intimate friend,"" replied the lad with a laughing, but most affectionate look into his father's face.""You are mine, too, papa; my best and dearest earthly friend,"" Lulu said, lifting to his, eyes shining with filial love. ""Papa, aren't you afraid those bad men will try to harm you some day, if they ever get out of prison?""""We are always safe in the path of duty,"" he replied, ""and it is a duty we owe the community to bring such lawless men to justice, for the protection of those they would prey upon. No, I do not fear them, because I am under the protection of Him 'in whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.'Arrived at their destination they found a little crowd of idlers gathered about the door of the magistrate's office whither the two prisoners had been taken a few moments before. As the Woodburn carriage drove up, and the captain and his children alighted from it, the crowd parted to let them pass in, several of the men lifting their hats with a respectful, ""Good morning, sir,"" to the captain. ""Good morning, Master Max.""The children behaved very well indeed, showing by their manner when taking the oath to tell ""the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth,"" that they were duly impressed with the solemnity of the act, and the responsibility they were assuming.Lulu was of course the principal witness, and her modest, self possessed bearing, equally free from boldness and forwardness on the one hand, and bashfulness and timidity on the other, pleased her father extremely and won the admiration of all present; as did also her simple, straightforward way of telling her story.""Take me to the nursery, Vi,"" Grandma Elsie said, when the departure of the party destined for the magistrate's office, had left them alone together. ""I feel that an hour with my little grandchildren will be quite refreshing. The darlings are scarcely less dear to me than were their mother and her brothers and sisters in their infancy.""Grandma kindly complied, telling the old story of the fall in simple language suited to the infant comprehension of the baby girl, who listened with as deep an interest as though it were a new tale to her, instead of an oft repeated one.""Yes, darling, I will. It is a beautiful place; with streets of gold, a beautiful river, and trees with delicious fruits; it is never dark, for there is no night there; because Jesus our dear Saviour is there and is the light thereof, so that they do not need the sun or moon.""Nobody is ever sick, or sorry, hungry, or in pain. Nobody is ever naughty; they all love God and one another. There is very sweet music there. They wear white robes and have crowns of gold on their heads and golden harps in their hands."""
"""Yes, she has an inquiring mind, and I would not discourage her desire to learn by asking questions,"" Grandma Elsie said, adding with a smile, ""I can remember that her mother used to ask me some very puzzling ones twenty years ago.""""And I never received a rebuff, but was always answered to the best of your ability, dear mamma. I think of that now when tempted to impatience with my little girl's sometimes wearisome questioning, and resolve to try to be as good a mother to her as you were to me; and still are,"" she added with a loving smile. ""And now that she has gone back to her play and baby Ned is sleeping, I want a quiet chat with you.""""Mamma, I have not heretofore been timid about burglars,"" Violet said, when they were seated in the boudoir, each busied with a bit of needlework, ""but I fear that I shall be in future; for only think, mamma, how near they were to my husband and myself while we lay sleeping soundly in our own room! How easily they might have murdered us both before we were even aware of their presence in the house.""""O mamma, yes! 'Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world,' and 'He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep'; and yet--haven't even Christians sometimes been murdered by burglars?""""I can not assert that they have not,"" replied her mother. ""'According to your faith be it unto you,' and even true Christians are sometimes lacking in faith--putting their trust in their own defences, or some earthly helper, instead of the Keeper of Israel; or they are fearful and doubtful, refusing to take God at his word and rest in his protecting care.""I do not see that we have anything to do with the question you propounded just now; we have only to take God's promises, believe them fully and be without carefulness in regard to that, as well as other things. I am perfectly sure he will suffer no real evil to befall any who thus trust in him.""My dear Vi, I think one who can claim all the promises of God to his children, should be utterly free from the fear that hath torment; should be afraid of nothing whatever but displeasing and dishonoring God.""Violet looked up brightly. ""I trust we shall, mamma; we both earnestly desire to be, and I think his three all give good evidence that they have already begun to walk in the straight and narrow way; and no wonder, considering what a faithful, loving, Christian father he is--so constant in prayer and effort on their behalf.""""Ah,"" as the sound of wheels was heard on the driveway, ""they have returned; and now we shall have a report of all that was done in the magistrate's office. It must have been quite an ordeal to Max and Lulu.""""Certainly, we will be very happy to gratify your very excusable curiosity,"" returned her husband laughingly, as she came to his side, and he stooped his tall form to give her the kiss with which he never failed to greet her after even a brief separation.""It isn't like other swearing,"" remarked Max, who was moving on up the stairs, somewhat ahead of his sisters. ""There must be a right kind, because in the psalms, where David is describing a good man, he says of him, 'He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.'""""There were a good many people there; the room was quite full; but I felt that that did not make much difference, when I thought about God hearing every word I said and knowing if it was really the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.""Papa stopped and spoke to her before we got into the carriage to come home. He said he was very sorry for her, but if she continued to be honest and industrious, he would see that she did not want; and he hoped her husband would some day come out of prison a better man.""""I'll put my hat and coat in their proper places and smooth my hair, so I'll be neat for dinner, and we'll go and talk to papa about it at once. He's sure to approve, and I don't want to give myself any chance to change my mind and give the thing up.""""Oh yes: perhaps we can form ourselves into a Dorcas society. That's what they call societies that make garments for the poor you know, because of Dorcas in the Bible who made coats and garments for the poor where she lived.""On leaving the table all repaired to the parlor and Lulu and Grace, seizing the first opportunity offered them by a pause in the talk of their elders, told of their plan, and asked permission to carry it out.""I have no doubt that Rosie and Evelyn will be glad to join you in forming a Dorcas society,"" said Grandma Elsie, ""and if you like I shall be happy to cut out garments for you to work upon, and to teach you how to do it for yourselves.""""We have come in a body, as you see, to learn all about the strange occurrences of last night and the consequent doings in the magistrate's office this morning,"" Grandpa Dinsmore remarked, as he shook hands with the captain and kissed Violet, first on one cheek, then on the other."
"""O Lu, do tell us all about it!"" cried Rosie. ""I never did hear of such a brave girl as you! Why I'd have been scared to death, and never have thought of such a thing as going down where the burglars were.""""Oh I think you would if you'd been in my place,"" returned Lulu modestly. ""You see I was afraid if I waited to tell papa about them, they might come out and see him ready to fight them, and kill him; but I thought if I could get the door shut and fastened on them before they knew anybody was there, nobody would be hurt.""And greetings were scarcely exchanged with these when the families from Ashlands and the Laurels joined the circle; so that quite a large surprise party had gathered there unexpectedly to themselves as well as to their hosts. The same desire--to learn the full particulars of what had reached them as little more than a vague report--had brought them all.But when it had been decided to organize a society on the spot, and the business of electing officers was taken up, they roused themselves to a new interest, and Maud was evidently gratified when Evelyn nominated her for the secretaryship.Zoe had already been made president; Lora was chosen treasurer. These were all the officers considered necessary, but Sydney, Evelyn and Lulu were appointed a committee to visit the poor families in the neighborhood and learn what articles of clothing were most needed by them.It was decided that the society should meet once a fortnight at one or the other of the homes of its members, taking them in turn; that at these meetings reports should be given in as to the state of the finances, work done, and articles needed; finished garments would also be brought in, examined and pronounced upon as well or ill done; the members would busy themselves in cutting and basting new garments while together, and each carry home with her one or more to be made in the interval between that and the next meeting.""Now I think that is all,"" said Grandma Elsie; ""you are fully organized and I invite you to hold your first meeting at Ion, next Wednesday afternoon. That will give time for ascertaining the needs of some of those we wish to assist, and the purchase of materials.""""By a tax on the members, and contributions from their friends, which will be thankfully accepted,"" she said with a pleased smile as he took out his pocket-book and handed her a five dollar bill. ""We are very much obliged, sir.""After that the captain said he had a suggestion to make; namely that it would be well for the little girls to be accompanied by an older person when making their visits to their proposed beneficiaries.""It will require some wisdom and tact to make the necessary investigations without wounding the feelings of those they desire to benefit, or injuring their commendable pride of independence,"" he said in conclusion.""Are we boys to be shut out of all this?"" asked Max. ""I don't see why we shouldn't take hold of such work as well as the girls. I'm conceited enough to think I could wield a pair of shears and cut out garments, by a pattern or under instruction; and I know I can run a sewing machine, for I've tried it.""""But with your studies and other duties to attend to, you have hardly time for such a multiplication of societies, and as the work is one, the field the world, I propose that you form only one more society, which shall be for both home and foreign missions.""""And the same objection applies to all of us except Max and little Walter,"" added Chester Dinsmore. ""We older lads can only pay our dues and perhaps meet with you occasionally when at home on a vacation.""Eva was chosen president, Rosie treasurer, and they would have made Lulu secretary but that she strenuously declined, insisting that she was not ready enough with her pen to find time for that in addition to all the sewing and other things she was undertaking.They then settled the amount of their yearly subscription to each cause and the time of meeting, deciding that it should be on the same day and hour as the meeting of the other society, but on the alternate week.He was rejoiced to perceive that the interest of these new enterprises was taking his children's thoughts from the unpleasant occurrences of the previous night. Almost all their talk with him that evening when the guests had gone and the babies were being put to bed, was of the work they hoped to do in connection with their missionary and Dorcas societies.""Liza must feel lonesome to-night, thinking about Ajax in jail,"" remarked Grace thoughtfully; ""but I'm glad he's there so that he can't be trying to break into anybody's house. Papa, could he get out and come here again?"""
"""It is hardly possible,"" answered her father, looking tenderly down into her face, and smoothing her curls with caressing hand; ""and he would not want to hurt you if he could come into the house. I don't see how any one could wish to harm my gentle, kindhearted little Grace.""""'Liza and her children? Well, not so very; because papa has been seeing to them for quite a while. They had a good fire ('Liza was ironing for somebody) and pretty good clothes; but the children are growing too big for some of their things and have torn or worn holes in others. So papa says he thinks we should make them some new ones. I'm going to ask Grandma Elsie to buy some flannel with some of my money, and let me make a skirt for the baby.""""I don't believe he was much help anyhow,"" said Lulu, with a scornful little toss of her head; ""she says he didn't work half the time and was always getting drunk and beating her and the children. I should think she'd want him kept in jail as long as he lives.""The captain's motive for visiting the jail that day was certainly most kind and Christian; a desire to reason with the two prisoners on the sin and folly of their evil courses, and persuade them to repentance and reformation.He did not approach them in a self-righteous spirit, for the thought in his heart was, ""It is only the grace of God that maketh us to differ; and with the same heredity, and like surroundings and influences I might have been even a greater criminal than they;"" but he found them sullen and defiant and by no means grateful for his kindly interest in their welfare.Lulu looked forward to the trial with some apprehension, dreading to be placed on the witness-stand before the judges, jurymen, lawyers, and the crowd of spectators likely to be present on the occasion.""It'll be a great, great deal worse than that time in the magistrate's office,"" she said to herself again and again. But by her father's advice she tried to put away the thought of it and give her mind to other things.She was interested in her studies, amusements, in the books and periodicals furnished for the profit and entertainment of herself and brother and sister, and in the young people's societies just started in the connection.Under Grandma Elsie's wise and kindly instruction several of the older members soon became quite expert in preparing work for themselves and the others; also in gathering up information on the subject of missions, and in regard to the needy of their own vicinity.That was a more congenial task to Grace than to Lulu, but the latter--partly from pride, partly from a real desire to be useful--insisted each time on carrying home at least as much work as Gracie did.And for some weeks she was very faithful with her self-imposed task; but after that her interest in that particular work began to flag and she delayed doing it, giving her time and thoughts to other matters, till at last Gracie reminded her that there was but a day left in which to do it, if the garment were to be ready for handing in at the next meeting of the society.""But how can you? You have that composition to write, and two lessons to learn to recite to papa in the morning. I should think they would take all your afternoon except what has to be given to exercise; and it's dinner time now.""At the table the captain said to his wife that business called him to the city, he must start directly the meal was over, and would not be able to get home till late, long after the usual bedtime; but he did not want any one to sit up for him, as he could let himself in with his latch key.""Papa, I wish you didn't ever have to go away,"" sighed Grace; ""we shall miss so much the fun with the babies, and the nice talk with you while they are being put to bed, and then the reading afterwards.""""I have not said anything about taking the babies with me, and really have no thought of doing so; as they would not be likely to prove of assistance in transacting my business,"" returned her father gravely.""Of course we will,"" said Violet, ""but though your papa is unquestionably the finest reader among us, the rest of us can read intelligibly, and some of us can read aloud to the others; perhaps we may take turns.""Both replied with a promise not to forget or neglect his requirements, and immediately upon bidding her father good-bye and seeing him out of sight, Lulu went to her room and applied herself to the study of her lessons first, then to the writing of her composition.She did her work hurriedly, however, with the thought of the sewing for which she now had so little time, ever present with her; consequently the lessons took small hold upon her memory and the remaining task was very indifferently performed.On their return Lulu, hardly waiting to remove her out door garments and make herself presentable for the evening, went at the sewing with all the activity and determination of her very energetic nature.""But Grandma Elsie is particular about the stitches,"" said Grace; ""don't you remember she told us she was, for our own sakes more than the poor folks'; because it would be a sad thing for us to fall into slovenly habits of working?""Lulu carried her sewing there directly after leaving the table, and Violet more than once spoke admiringly of the diligence and energy she displayed in working steadily on till it was time for them to separate for the night."
"""That is well,"" he said, ""I am glad to see you willing to use some of your leisure time in working for the poor, but your education--which is to fit you for greater usefulness in the future--must not be neglected for that or anything else.""Lulu blushed with a sudden half conviction that her tasks had not been so faithfully attended to as they should have been. But it was now too late to remedy the failure, as the school hour would come very soon after breakfast and family worship.She wished she had learned her lessons more thoroughly and spent more time and pains upon her composition, but hoped she might be able to acquit her herself better, on being called to recite, than she feared.However, it proved a vain hope; she hesitated and gave incorrect answers several times in the first recitation, and when it came to the second showed herself almost entirely unacquainted with the lesson.Then taking up her composition, which he had found lying on his desk and had already examined, ""And this, I am sorry to have to say, is a piece of work that does no credit to my daughter; the writing is slovenly, the sentences are badly constructed, and the spelling is very faulty. It must be re-written this afternoon, and both lessons learned so that you can recite them creditably to me before I can allow you any recreation.""""Then you must undertake less of it, or none at all; for as I have said before, your lessons are of much more importance. I can pay some one to work for the poor, but my little girl's stock of knowledge must be increased, and her mind improved by her own efforts.""""I am glad to hear it; but you must be willing to undertake less if you can not do so much without neglecting other, and more important duties. Did you bring home an extra quantity of work from the last meeting of your society?""""No, sir,"" and she blushed again as she spoke, ""but I--I kept putting off doing it because there was always something else I wanted to do--a story to read, or a game to play, or a bit of carving, or something pleasanter than sewing--till Grace reminded me there was only one day left, and then I hurried over my lessons and composition and worked as hard and fast as I could at the sewing.""""Ah,"" he said, ""it is an old and very true saying that 'Procrastination is the thief of time.' The only way to accomplish much in this world is to have a time for each duty, and always attend to it at that set time.""If you want to go on with this Dorcas work you must set apart some particular time for it, when it will not interfere with other duties, and resolve not to allow yourself to use that time for anything else.""""Yes, sir; I have my ciphering to do now. But, papa, must I learn the lessons over and rewrite the composition this afternoon? If you say I must, I'll have to miss the meeting of our society. I'd be very sorry for that and ashamed to have to tell why I wasn't there. Please, papa, won't you let me go, and do my work over after I get back? There'll be an hour, or more before tea and then all the evening.""""As I well may be, considering how far beyond my deserts are my blessings,"" he said with a tender smile and another kiss. ""Yes, daughter, you may attend the meeting and I shall hope to hear some excellent recitations from you before you go to your bed to-night.""The society met at Ion that day. The captain and Violet drove over with the children, and leaving them there while they went on some miles farther, called for them again on their return at the close of the hour appropriated to its exercises.Grandma Elsie's face hardly expressed approval as she examined Lulu's work, but she let it pass, only saying in a low aside to the little girl, ""It is not quite so well done as the last garment you brought in, my child, but I will overlook the partial failure, hoping the next bit of work will be an improvement upon both.""On arriving at home she set immediately to work at her tasks, nor left off till the tea bell rang. The time had been too short for her to make much progress, and it was quite a trial to have to spend the whole evening in her own room while the others were enjoying the usual pleasant hours of relaxation together;--the sport with the babies, the familiar chat, and interesting reading; but that too she bore with patience.""Ah, that is well,"" he said, laying a hand tenderly on her head and smiling affectionately down into the eyes upraised to his. ""I will go with you presently to hear the lessons and examine your little essay."""
"When he had done so, ""I am very glad indeed, daughter,"" he said, ""to be able to bestow hearty praise on you this time; you have greatly improved your composition, and your recitations were quite perfect.""""I missed my eldest daughter, from the family circle this evening,"" he went on smoothing her hair caressingly; ""indeed I think we all missed her. I hope we will not be deprived of her company in the same way again.""""I hope not, papa; I do mean to be more faithful in preparing my lessons. I'm sure I ought when I have such a kind, kind teacher,"" she added looking lovingly into his eyes. ""Dear papa,"" putting her arm round his neck and laying her cheek to his, ""I do love you so, _so_ much!""""My darling,"" he responded, ""your love is very precious to me, and I don't think it can be greater than mine for you. My daughter's worth to her fond father--could not be computed in dollars and cents,"" he added with a happy laugh.""No, papa, I don't mean to; I didn't bring home quite so much this time, though some of the girls did look as if they thought I was growing lazy--and it was dreadfully mortifying to have them think so--and I'm going to try Eva's plan. She says she divides her work into as many portions as there are days to do it in, and won't let herself miss doing at least one portion each day. She says she gets it done quite easily in that way, often finished before the day when it is to be handed in.""""No, sir; and I don't mean to any more. I'll put that sewing first after what you say are more important duties, and not let myself have any play till it's done. I think I can 'most always do it before breakfast, now that you don't require me to sweep or dust my own rooms. I'm very much obliged to you, papa, for saying I needn't do those things any more while I have so many lessons.""""I want my daughters to understand all kinds of housework so that they may be competent to direct servants, if they have them, or be independent of them if they have not,"" he said; ""but now that you have learned how to sweep and dust, I do not think it necessary for you to make use of that knowledge while your time can be better employed, and I am able to pay a servant for doing the work.""""In about half an hour after breakfast,"" he answered. ""That will take us to the town for the opening of to-day's session of the court. We may not be called on for our testimony for hours, but must be at hand in case we are wanted.""Lulu wasted no more breath in vain wishes or objections, but her usual flow of spirits had deserted her. As they drove toward the town her father noticed that she was very quiet and that her face wore a look of patient resignation and fortitude as if she had made up her mind to go courageously through a difficult and trying ordeal.""And not only I, dear, but a nearer, dearer, more powerful Friend. Jesus says, 'Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the World.' He says it to every one of his disciples, and that always must include this time that you are dreading.""He will be close beside you and you can ask him at any instant for the help you need to know exactly what to say and do; the help to be calm and collected, and to answer clearly and perfectly truthfully every question put to you.""""Papa, it's so nice to think of that!"" she exclaimed, looking up brightly and with glad tears shinning in her eyes; ""thank you so very much for reminding me of it. Now I shall not be at all afraid, even if the lawyers do ask me hard, puzzling questions, as I've read in the papers, that they do to witnesses, sometimes.""""No, you need not be afraid; I am not afraid for you; for I am sure you will be helped to say just what you ought; and if--as I believe will happen--you are enabled to acquit yourself well, remember, when people commend you for it, that having done so by help from on high, the honor is not fairly due to you, and you have no reason to be conceited and vain in consequence.""""I hope I'll be kept from being that, papa,"" she returned. ""I don't think that for anybody with as good a memory as mine, having told a straightforward truthful story is anything to be puffed up about."""
