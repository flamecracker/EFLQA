passage
"""Oranges and lemons and pineapples,"" answered the little girl, who was playing with her brother at sailing boats in the brook that ran back of the house. ""And maybe I'll have gold and diamonds and chocolate cake on my ship, Teddy,"" went on Janet Martin.Teddy Martin jumped up so suddenly from the bank of the brook, where he was loading his ship with what he called ""swords, guns and gunpowder,"" that he tipped the vessel over and the whole cargo was spilled into the water.This would be easy enough, it seemed, as the children were only pretending that stones, pebbles and bits of sticks were the cargoes of their toy ships, and, as Teddy had said, he could easily get more stones. The brook was filled with them.""I--I don't guess I want you to be a pirate,"" said Janet slowly, as she looked at her ship, on which the pebbles, stones and bits of wood were neatly arranged in piles. ""I'm not going to play that game! I don't want you to be a pirate, Ted! It's too scary!""But her brother was beyond the reach of her voice now, hurrying toward the house after his ""black pirate flag."" Janet shoved her ship out from the shore--her ship laden with diamonds, gold and chocolate cakes. Of course it was not a real ship. The Curlytops would not have had half as much fun with real ships as they were having with the pieces of boards which they were making believe were steamers and sailing vessels.""I'll sail my ship away down to the end of the brook before Ted gets back to be a pirate,"" said Janet to herself, as, with a long stick, she directed the flat board which was piled high with brook-pebbles. ""Then when he comes back he can't sink it.""Janet pushed her ship slowly at first, and then a little faster, moving it along by means of the stick while she stood on the bank. Then, hearing a noise in the bushes behind her, she thrust harder on the stick.With a splash the stones, pebbles and bits of wood went into the brook. The whole cargo was sunk and lost as surely as if Ted's pirate vessel had captured that of his sister. That is, everything sank but the ship itself and the cargo of little sticks, some of which Janet was pretending were chocolate cakes. Even at that, I suppose, the chocolate cakes would be wet and soggy. And soggy chocolate cake isn't good to eat. The best thing you can do with it is to make it into a pudding.""Yep! Me is here!"" announced Trouble. Sometimes he talked more correctly than this, and his mother had told Janet and Teddy to try to cure him of his baby talk and the wrong use of words. But Ted and Jan thought it was ""cute"" to hear Trouble say queer things, so they did not mend his talk as often as they might.""There wasn't any chocolate cake--really, dear,"" explained the little girl, as she ruffled up her curly hair. ""Ted and I were just pretending. He is going to have a pirate ship. I didn't want him to get mine, so I was shoving it hard down the brook, but I made it go too fast and it upset. Now I've got to load my ship all over again."""
"""Well, Indians and pirates are 'most the same,"" declared Teddy. ""Wait till you see my ship, with swords and guns and powder! It will blow your ship out of the water, and I'll have a black flag on it and everything! Whoop!""Teddy, who was cutting a flagstaff with his knife, stopped to look at her. If Janet was going to act this way, and not send out her ship, there was no use in being a pirate. What fun could even a make-believe pirate have if there were no ships to sink?""All right, Jan, I won't be a pirate if you don't want me to. But I'll have a black flag, anyhow, and maybe I'll be a pirate some other time. Let's have a race with our ships--see which one gets to the water-wheel first.""At the lower end of the brook she and Teddy had built a little dam, and where the water flowed over the top, like a tiny Niagara Falls, Teddy had fastened a wooden paddle wheel which turned as the water flowed on it.""Hu! I want bigger s'ip 'n' _him_!"" declared Trouble, with a grunt. Then he arose and toddled off through the bushes. Teddy and Janet were so busy getting their own vessels ready for the coming race that they paid no more attention to their small brother. And Trouble was going to get into trouble--you may be sure of that.""Hu!"" grunted Ted, as he placed the pebbles carefully on the middle of his ship, so it would not turn over. ""Stones are heavy, whether you make believe they're feathers or not. Don't put too many on, I'm telling you!""The boy and the girl went on with their game, and they were almost ready to start their ships off on the race when there was a racket in the bushes back of them. It was a bumping, banging sound that Ted and Janet heard, then followed the bark of a dog.They were both right. A moment later there burst through the bushes the little boy and the dog. The dog was Skyrocket, and he was made fast to a box which he was dragging along by a rope tied around his neck. Trouble was holding to the rear of the box, and in his eagerness to pull it along Skyrocket was also dragging Trouble, ""spillin'"" him, in fact--that is, pulling Trouble off his feet every now and then.""Don't want wagon--dis my s'ip!"" announced the little fellow, as he began to loosen the rope from the dog's neck. But as soon as Trouble started to do this, Skyrocket, who loved the children, began to lick William's face with a red tongue."
"""Yes, Skyrocket is a good dog,"" said Ted. ""Hi there! Don't wag your tail so near my ship, or you'll upset her before I beat Jan in the race!"" shouted Teddy, as the dog, in his joy at being with the Curlytops, nearly spoiled their plans for having fun. Mrs. Martin dropped the letter from Uncle Toby. It fluttered to the ground as she hastened down the bank of the brook in which Trouble was sailing away, aboard the small box he had brought to play with as his ""s'ip.""Poor William would have been glad enough to do this, but he could not. He had stepped into the box, shoved it out from shore with a pole as he had seen Janet poling her tiny ship along, and then the current of the stream had carried poor Trouble away. He was floating down the brook, which was quite deep in some places.""I'll get him myself!"" called Ted, and, not thinking that he had on his shoes and stockings, into the water he dashed, following after the floating box in which Trouble was riding. As for the little fellow himself, he had been overjoyed, at first, when he found that he was afloat. But as the water came leaking through the cracks in the box Trouble became frightened.""Mother's coming!"" called Mrs. Martin, as she caught up a long stick and, running along the edge of the brook, tried to reach out and hook it over the side of the box-ship in which William was sailing away.And while the mother, brother and sister of the little chap are going to his rescue, I will take just a moment or two and tell you something about the Martin children, and why they are called the ""Curlytops.""The reason for the odd, pretty name is not hard to find. It was in their hair--they had the cutest, curliest curly hair that ever grew on the heads of any children anywhere in the world. So it is no wonder they were called ""Curlytops.""After that they had more adventures on ""Star Island,"" where they went camping with Grandpa. The fun on the island was wonderful, even more wonderful were their adventures when they were ""Snowed In"" and when the Curlytops went to Uncle Frank's ranch, and rode on ponyback. Ted, Janet and Trouble thought they had never seen such good times in all their lives. They helped solve a strange mystery, too.The book just before this one that you are reading is named ""The Curlytops at Silver Lake,"" and in that you may learn what Ted, Janet and Trouble did when they went on the water with Uncle Ben, and how they helped capture some bad men.Mr. Richard Martin was the father of the Curlytops. He was a storekeeper in the city of Cresco, in one of our eastern states. There were just three of the Curlytops, Theodore Baradale, Janet and William Anthony Martin. But Theodore was nearly always called Ted or Teddy, Janet's name was shortened to Jan and William answered to the call of Trouble as often as to any other.In addition to the children there was Skyrocket, the dog, and Turnover, the cat. The cat was called that name because she had a trick of lying down and rolling over when she wanted something to eat. There had also been Nicknack, a goat, and Clipclap, a pony, but these had been sent away for a time, and the dog and cat were the only pets the children had at present. But they were soon going to have more, as I will tell you presently."
"It was a warm, pleasant, sunny day when Ted and Jan went down to the brook to play that pieces of boards were their ""ships."" Then Trouble had joined them, and, just after the mail carrier left the strange letter from Uncle Toby, Trouble had, as usual, gotten into trouble.Janet and Teddy were not quite certain who Uncle Toby might be. They had heard of him, once or twice, as a distant relative of their father or their mother, but they had not seen him in a number of years. They only dimly remembered him as an old man who lived in a city about fifty miles from Cresco, but they had not visited him in some time.""Oh, he'll be drowned!"" screamed Janet, who was following her mother along the bank of the brook, while Trouble was out in the middle in his leaking, packing-box ship that Skyrocket had pulled to the stream for him. The dog, who had found the stick which Teddy threw, had rushed back, and was now barking as loudly as he could.""Det me out! Det me out! I is all wet--I is!"" cried Trouble. ""My hoots is all wet!"" Sometimes the letter ""f"" bothered him, and he put an ""h"" in its place, as saying ""hoots"" for ""foots."" Of course neither word was right, but who minded a thing like that when poor Trouble was in such a plight?""I'll get him!"" cried Teddy, as he caught his breath. Then he wiped some of the water from his face, and dashed on down the brook. But by this time the packing box, in which Trouble was taking more of a ride than he had counted on, was some distance down the brook. However, Mrs. Martin was keeping alongside of it, though it was beyond even the reach of her long stick.""Oh, I must get over on the other side--but the brook is deep here!"" said Mrs. Martin. She was going to forget that, however, and splash in, when the box, by some twist of the current, suddenly floated near the bank along which she was running.""You poor little fellow! Was mother's Trouble frightened to pieces?"" murmured Mrs. Martin as she lifted her youngest out of the box, and, never minding his wet feet, hugged him tightly. The packing box drifted off downstream, Skyrocket racing after it and barking as though it was the best joke in the world. ""Were you frightened, William?"" murmured his mother.And when Trouble, smiling and happy, with a picture book in his hands and dry shoes and stockings on his feet, was safe in a chair, and when Janet and Teddy sat near her, Mrs. Martin read the letter again."
"""It is from Uncle Toby Bardeen of Pocono,"" said the mother of the Curlytops. ""At least he is your father's uncle, but that doesn't matter. He is an old bachelor, and lives with a distant relative, a Mrs. Watson, in an old, rambling house.""""No, Uncle Toby doesn't say that,"" went on Mother Martin, as she glanced over the pages of the letter. ""What he wants is for your father to go and take charge of everything that is in the old house--everything, that is, except the housekeeper, Mrs. Watson. She is going off by herself, Uncle Toby says.""""No, Uncle Toby isn't dead, I'm glad to say,"" remarked Mrs. Martin. ""But he is going away on a long voyage for his health, he writes, and he wants daddy to come and take charge of everything in the old mansion.""""Hush, children!"" their mother warned them. ""I haven't the least idea what is in Uncle Toby's house, that he should be so mysterious about it, and be in such a hurry for your father to come and take charge.""""I think it's as queer as he is,"" said the father of the Curlytops, smiling. ""Uncle Toby is a dear old man, but very queer. So he wants me to come and take charge of his 'collection,' does he? It's strange that he doesn't say what his collection is.""""That would be very fine!"" laughed her father. ""But though Uncle Toby is well off, I hardly think he has a collection of money lying around his old mansion. However, I suppose I must go and see what it is the queer fellow wants me to take charge of for him.""Accordingly, the next day, Mr. Martin left his manager in charge of the store, and, in the comfortable family automobile, the Curlytops and their father, mother and Trouble--not forgetting Skyrocket, the dog--started off. For a little while it seemed as though something serious had happened in the automobile which was taking the Curlytops to Uncle Toby's house. Mr. Martin had all he could do to slow up the machine, bringing it to a stop beside the road, and under a tree. If a tire had burst or been punctured Daddy Martin wanted to be in the shade to fix it.Mother Martin, holding tightly to the side of the seat when the banging noise sounded, turned to look behind her to see if the three children were all right. She saw Trouble sitting between Ted and Janet, and William was looking at something in his chubby hand.""So am I,"" said Mother Martin. ""It is too hot to have to change a tire to-day. Besides, I'm in a hurry to get to Uncle Toby's and see what it is he wants us to take charge of while he is away. I hope he doesn't go until we get there.""""You never can tell what Uncle Toby is going to do,"" said Mr. Martin, smiling, now that he knew he had no tire to change. ""And so you burst your toy balloon, did you, Trouble? Well, I'll have to get you another, but not while we're on this auto ride. I don't want to be frightened again, and I might be if you blew up another balloon and it burst."""
"Along rolled the automobile, taking the Curlytops nearer and nearer to the city of Pocono, where Uncle Toby lived with his housekeeper, Mrs. Watson. But it was rather a long ride, and, about half way, the party stopped in a little village for lunch.A little later the Curlytops were having a fine meal, and when I say the Curlytops I mean also Daddy and Mother Martin, and Trouble. The hair of Mr. and Mrs. Martin did not curl, though it must have done so when they were younger; or else how would Ted and Janet have had such beautiful ringlets? Nor did Trouble's hair curl, though when he was smaller his mother used to wind little ringlets around her finger, hoping he would have locks as pretty as those of Janet and Ted. But, really, the older boy and girl were the only ones who could, truly, be called Curlytops, though I sometimes speak of the ""Curlytop family.""So you know, when I say that the ""Curlytops"" were eating lunch, that all five of them were enjoying their meal. There were several things that Janet, Teddy and Trouble liked to eat, and toward the end of the meal there was a piece of pie for each of them. And it was toward the end of the meal that something happened, and Trouble, as usual, was the cause of it.Just before the waiter had brought the pie there had sounded, out in the street, the music of a hand organ. No sooner had he heard this than Trouble slipped from his chair (where he had been sitting on a hassock to make him higher) and ran to the window.""No monkey!"" called out the little fellow, after he had stood for a moment with his nose pressed against the pane of glass, making his ""smeller,"" as he sometimes called it, quite flat. ""Hand-organ grinder got no monkey!""Trouble was disappointed. He had hoped to see a little monkey scrambling around to gather pennies in his cap. But this hand-organ player did not have any. And there was nothing much for Trouble to see. So the little fellow came back to the table, but not before he had stopped at the big water-cooler in one corner of the dining room. Trouble paused to watch a waiter turn the shiny little faucet and draw a glass of water for a customer.""But my feet are damp,"" went on Mrs. Martin. Then she raised the cloth, which hung down rather low on each side of the table, and glanced at the floor. ""There's a big puddle of water under our table!"" she cried.""Oh, not quite so much,"" said her mother gently. ""Though there is enough to have wet through the soles of my shoes. I was wondering why my feet felt so damp and cold. And did Trouble turn on the water? Oh, Trouble!""That was just what he had done. Seeing the waiter draw a glass of water from the cooler had given Trouble the idea that he soon afterward carried out. When he saw no monkey with the hand organ, the little fellow had gone back to his seat and, on the way, opened the faucet so that the water ran out in a little stream. Soon the drip-pan was full and then the water began trickling over the floor. No one noticed it until it had made a little puddle under the table, just at the point where Mrs. Martin's feet were."
"Once again Trouble, Ted and Janet sat in the rear seat, while their father and mother rode in front. And this time Trouble had no red balloon which he could blow up, making it burst with a noise like a punctured tire. The children talked among themselves, wondering over and over again what it could be that Uncle Toby wanted their father to come and take charge of.""What would be fun?"" asked his mother from the front seat, where she had heard the talk of the children. She often asked a question like this, as it sometimes stopped a bit of mischief that, otherwise, might happen. ""What fun are you talking about?"" asked Mrs. Martin.On and on they rode in the automobile, until, after a while, they reached the small city of Pocono and, a little later, they pulled up in front of Uncle Toby's house. It was a rambling, old mansion that once had looked very nice, but now it was rather shabby and needed painting.""Wait! Don't go in! Don't go in!"" cried the queer old lady, holding up her hand like a traffic policeman stopping a fast automobile. ""Don't go in! They're having a terrible time! Oh, that Mr. Bardeen ever should have gone away and left me to look after 'em! Oh, the trouble I have had! Such trouble! Don't go in! Listen to 'em!"" ""Listen to that noise!"" called Teddy, pausing with his hand on the gate that led into Uncle Toby's yard. ""It's two boys having fun. I guess Uncle Toby left two fellows that you can take home and I can have fun with,"" Teddy added laughingly to his father.""Listen to 'em! I can't do a thing with 'em since Uncle Toby went away. I'm so glad you came to take charge of 'em as he asked you to. You did come for that, didn't you?"" she asked eagerly. ""You got Uncle Toby's letter, asking you to come and take charge of the collection he left, didn't you?"""
"""They're worse than babies!"" declared Mrs. Watson. ""I don't mind children and babies. But these things make so much noise I can't hear myself think. That's why I came out on the steps to sit down and be quiet! Oh, I'm so glad you've come to take charge of 'em!""""Only when they're hungry,"" said the queer old lady. ""And I expect they're hungry now. I just hate to go in to feed them, they make such a fuss, and I'm afraid some of 'em will bite me. Not on purpose you know,"" she quickly added, ""but just because they're so playful and full of fun.""""Uncle Toby's pets,"" was the answer. ""Uncle Toby said he was going to leave them to you when he went away on a long trip. He may be gone for several years, and he said he might live the rest of his life in South America, where he is going. So he told me to give you his pets to take charge of. You are to take them, and do as you please with them, though I guess Uncle Toby would like to have you keep them and be kind to them.""""Is there a dog?"" asked Teddy, his eyes shining in delight. ""Won't Skyrocket be glad? Do you hear that, old fellow?"" went on Teddy, leaning down to pet the dog that had jumped from the automobile and was looking as if in wonder at the house whence came such strange noises. ""You're going to have another dog to play with. Uncle Toby did leave a dog, didn't he?"" Teddy asked of Mrs. Watson. ""I hear a dog barking in the house.""""Two dogs and a cat!"" exclaimed Mr. Martin. ""My dear Mrs. Watson,"" he went on, as he sat down on the top step of the porch rather limply, ""will you please tell us, as fast as you can, just how many and what pets Uncle Toby has left us? We may as well hear the worst at once,"" he said to his wife. ""I never imagined Uncle Toby cared for animal pets.""""Oh, indeed he did,"" replied Mrs. Watson. ""Of late years he grew very fond of animals. All his pets are animals, and he'd have gotten more only I said I wouldn't stay and keep house for him if he brought in what he spoke of last."""
"""_Snakes_!"" declared the little old lady. ""I don't mind monkeys and parrots so much, but I can't bear _snakes_! They give me the shivers, though Uncle Toby said some snakes do a lot of good in this world, by catching rats and mice. But he didn't bring in any snakes!""""Stop! Wait a moment!"" begged Mrs. Martin. She took a seat beside her husband on the top step. ""I just wanted to sit down before I fainted when I heard the worst,"" she went on. ""Now go ahead, Mrs. Watson. Tell me the rest. I'll have something to lean against in case she tells me there's an elephant.""""That's what he said,"" replied the father of the Curlytops. ""But I don't know whether to take him at his word or not. But we may as well go in and look at the--the menagerie!"" he said to his wife, with a smile.""They'll need feeding--the animals will,"" said Mrs. Watson. ""I'm glad you're here to help me. I was staying only until you came. Uncle Toby said you'd be over in a day or two. I'm leaving to-night, now you're here.""""Oh, they're real kind and gentle--every one, even the little alligator,"" Uncle Toby's housekeeper made haste to say. ""And as long as you have children the pets will be just the things for the Curlytops. Only I can't stay much longer. I was just waiting for you. I went outside as it was quieter,"" she concluded, as, once again, the pet animals set up a screeching, barking and mewing.""I don't know whether we are or not,"" remarked Mrs. Martin. ""I suppose, though,"" she said to her husband in a low voice, as they prepared to enter the house, ""we can sell them. We don't have to keep them."""
"""Yes they do!"" said Janet, eagerly. ""I read it in my natural history book. They make a noise like a grunt. At least it's either alligators or crocodiles, I've forgotten which. But one kind bellows like a bull.""""They're all in one big room--a sort of addition to the house. It opens off the dining room,"" explained Mrs. Watson. ""Uncle Toby liked to eat when his pets did, that's why he had 'em so near him in the dining room. I'll show 'em to you.""""No, Uncle Toby kept them in the barn,"" the housekeeper replied. ""If you don't want the pigeons, Uncle Toby told me to tell you there's a boy in this same street who will take them. But Uncle Toby said he wished you'd take charge of all the other pets.""By this time Mrs. Watson had opened the door leading into the extra room that Uncle Toby had built to house his pets. No sooner was the door opened than the noise sounded louder than ever, and several things happened.""Oh, look at the lovely cat!"" cried Janet, as one with very fluffy fur walked forward as though to meet the Curlytops. ""It's a Persian, I guess. Oh, I just love a Persian! Turnover is very nice, but I love this one a lot,"" and she reached down to stroke the beautiful cat that seemed very friendly.""Bow wow!"" barked the poodle. And then, as if this might be a signal, there suddenly came from the end of the room another white poodle, so nearly like the first that it was difficult to tell them apart.""'Top! 'Top it!"" shouted William. ""Make han'-ordan monkey let my cap alone!"" he wailed. And then, with a flutter and a screech, a green and red parrot flew from its perch and landed on Mrs. Martin's shoulder. The pets of the Curlytops were having a lively time!"
"With the barking of the trick dogs, in which Skyrocket joined, and with the mewing of the Persian cat, the shrieking of the parrot, and the chattering of the monkey, for a time there was so much noise in Uncle Toby's ""menagerie,"" as it was called, that the voices of Mr. and Mrs. Martin could scarcely be heard. But you could hear the voice of Trouble above everything.""Take him off! Make him 'top!"" cried the little fellow. For by this time the monkey, having hung down by his tail from the chandelier, and having taken off Trouble's cap, was now trying to pull the little boy's hair.""I'll attend to him! I know how to manage Jack if I don't any of the other animals. I found a way to make him behave. Here!"" she suddenly cried, catching up a feather-duster and shaking it at the long-tailed creature. ""Get back to your cubby-hole, Jack!""With a shrill chatter the monkey dropped Trouble's cap, which he was trying to make stick on his own head, and a moment later he jumped down from the chandelier and scampered into a box at the side of the room.""That's where he belongs!"" said Mrs. Watson. ""He's always afraid of that feather-duster. Maybe he thinks it's a big eagle coming to bite his tail. Anyhow, show him the feather-duster whenever you want to quiet him.""""That's a good thing to know,"" said Mr. Martin, when it was a little quieter in the room, because Jack, the monkey, had stopped chattering. ""But what shall we do about the parrot on my wife's shoulder?""""Oh, Mr. Nip is all right. He's very gentle,"" said the housekeeper. ""Uncle Toby named him Mr. Nip because he used to nip and bite when he first came. But Uncle Toby soon cured him of that. Mr. Nip is a nice polly.""""I'm a crack! I'm a crack! I'm a crack-crack-cracker!"" shrieked the parrot, and then he flew from Mrs. Martin's shoulder to the regular perch, near the little cage of the monkey--the ""cubby-hole,"" as Mrs. Watson called it.""I 'ike 'em all,"" remarked Trouble, while Janet was rubbing the big Persian cat and Ted was playing with the two dogs. ""Uncle Toby nice man to have all nanimals 'ike dis!"" and he looked around the room. Surely there were quite a number of animal pets there."
"""I'll tell you about it after we've fed them,"" said Mrs. Watson. ""They'll be quieter after they're fed, and you might as well start in now to give them something to eat. If you're going to take 'em with you and keep 'em you'll have to feed 'em.""With the help of Ted and Janet, who set out food to the dogs and cat, Uncle Toby's animals were soon all being given things to eat, and this made them quiet. Then, while the children stood and watched the animals eat, Mrs. Watson took Daddy and Mother Martin into the next room and told them about Uncle Toby and the pets.""He wasn't, when I first came here to keep house for him,"" explained Mrs. Watson. ""But he made friends, once, with a sailor, who had the parrot. When the sailor started off on his next sea voyage, and didn't want to take Mr. Nip, the parrot, with him, Uncle Toby said the bird could stay here. I didn't much mind that, as it was rather lonesome when Uncle Toby--as I always call him--went out. So I got to liking Mr. Nip.""Then, after a while, another sailor gave Uncle Toby Jack, the monkey. The house was more lively after that, for the monkey and parrot used to fight, though they don't any more. I thought this would be about all the pets Uncle Toby would get; but lo and behold! about a month after that another sailor, hearing that Uncle Toby had a monkey and a parrot, came and asked us if we wouldn't take Slider.""""The circus man had made friends with the sailor who gave Uncle Toby the alligator,"" explained the housekeeper, ""and the circus man decided to become a sailor, too. He said he didn't want to keep the dogs on a ship, so he gave them to Uncle Toby.""""That's how it started,"" said Mrs. Watson. ""There were times when I thought it would never end. That was when a lady, who was going to travel for her health, asked Uncle Toby to keep Snuff, her Persian cat.""""Yes,"" answered Mrs. Watson. ""It is just the color of snuff, you see, a sort of yellowish brown. Many Persian cats have that color, I'm told. Anyhow this lady--I've forgotten her name--said she saw that Uncle Toby loved animals, as he had so many of them, so she asked him to keep her cat.""""Uncle Toby surely did!"" declared the housekeeper. ""It seemed he couldn't say 'no' where animals were concerned. By this time the house began to be rather overrun with pets, so he built this room out of the dining room, with special cages--cubby-holes I call 'em--for the pets. I did think Snuff would be the last one, but after that came the white mice and rats.""""Yes,"" agreed the housekeeper. ""Snuff, the cat, and the white mice--I don't know their names--are great friends. The mice and rats belonged to a boy down the street. His family moved to another state last summer, and his folks made him get rid of the mice. He brought them to Uncle Toby, and of course Uncle Toby couldn't say no, so he kept them. It was then I first threatened to leave. The house was too full of animals."""
"""No, I stayed on, because Uncle Toby begged me to, and he said he wouldn't add to his collection. But then came the pigeons. They were brought by another boy, whose folks moved away and he couldn't keep 'em any more. I didn't so much mind the pigeons, as they stay out in the barn. But we certainly had a houseful of pets! After a while I got rather to liking them, and Uncle Toby was very fond of 'em, and taught 'em many tricks.""""But finally, as you know from the letter he wrote you, he decided to take a long trip, and perhaps he may never come back, if he finds he likes it in South America. So he decided to ask you to take charge of his collection, and I said I'd stay until you arrived, as Uncle Toby had to leave in a hurry, to catch a ship that was sailing for South America.""""I think it was because he heard that monkeys and parrots come from there,"" the housekeeper answered. ""He seemed to like those animals better than any others, though Tip and Top, the two dogs, are more valuable, because they can do circus tricks.""""I am going away,"" answered the housekeeper. ""My plans are all made. I am going to live with my sister. All she keeps is a cat, and she puts that outside and winds the clock every night before she goes to bed. I'm going to her house. I told Uncle Toby I'd stay until the Curlytops came to take charge of the pets, and, now that you are here, I'll be going.""""But I don't want them! That is, we can't keep so many!"" protested Daddy Martin. ""Two dogs, a cat, a monkey, a parrot, an alligator and some white rats and mice, to say nothing of the pigeons! And we have a dog and cat now, and we just got rid of a goat and a pony! Oh, I say, my dear Mrs. Watson! This is too much!""""Can't help it!"" said the housekeeper as she fastened on her hat. ""Uncle Toby said you were to take charge of his collection of pets. That's all I know. If he never comes back--and I don't believe he ever will--the pets are yours to keep. I'd keep them if I were you--all except the pigeons. There's a boy down the street who will take them and be glad to get 'em. The pets are valuable--especially Tip and Top, the dogs. They do tricks separately, but they do more tricks together--a sort of team, you know. Those dogs are very valuable for a show."""
"In another moment--just as if they had been waiting for their father to say this--there came a storm of objections from Ted and Janet. In they ran from the room where they had been playing with the animals.Daddy Martin looked at his wife. And then, as if they had been waiting for something like this, Tip and Top did one of their best tricks. Tip began turning somersaults again and Top walked around on his hind legs. Then the two dogs barked, and, without anyone saying a word to them, they did another trick.""Yes, I hear 'em,"" answered the queer little old lady. ""I 'spect it's the boy after the pigeons. I told him to call as soon as he saw the Curlytops arrive, and he's probably been watching for you. I'll let him in as soon as I finish putting on my hat so I can go.""""Can I have the pigeons?"" asked the new boy, taking off his cap and making a little bow to Mrs. Martin, Mrs. Watson and Daddy Martin. ""Uncle Toby said I could have 'em if you folks didn't want 'em, and I've been waiting for you to come. I just saw you get here.""""Dear me! We'll end up by keeping them all, I see!"" laughed the father of the Curlytops. ""That is, all but the pigeons,"" he added quickly, as he saw a look of disappointment on the face of the new boy. ""You may have them, since Uncle Toby promised them to you.""""The pigeons are all I want,"" said the boy, whose name was Bob Nelson. ""My mother won't let me have any of the other pets. And, anyhow, I have a dog and a cat. Could I get the pigeons now? I've got a basket and they are so tame I can pick 'em up. They know me. I used to help Uncle Toby feed 'em.""""Oh, I wouldn't, for the world, have anything happen to them, as he was so fond of them and kind to them,"" said the mother of the Curlytops. ""But we could sell them to some animal store, and, as my husband says, give the money to a home for children. Uncle Toby would like that.""""Yes, he was very fond of children and animals,"" said the housekeeper, as she seemed about to leave. ""It's a pity he never had any of his own--any children, I mean,"" she quickly added. ""He did have enough animals. You'd better keep 'em, your children seem fond of 'em,"" she added."
"""You'd better keep all of Uncle Toby's pets,"" she concluded. ""I'm going now. Just pull the door shut after you and it will lock. The water is turned off and the house is all cleaned out. There isn't any food to spoil, except what the animals need, and you can take that with you. Uncle Toby said I was to go as soon as you arrived to have charge of his collection, and, as you are here, I'm going. Uncle Toby has hired a man to look after the house so it will be all right. Go and get your pigeons, Bob,"" she added. ""Good-bye, everybody,"" and away she went.""You're a fire-cracker--at least your feathers are red enough for that,"" laughed Mrs. Martin. ""Well, we seem to have the pets whether we want them or not,"" she told her husband. ""We can't go away and leave them here. We can't stay in this house, and try to sell them, if the water is turned off and there is nothing to eat. I guess we'll have to take the pets home with us, Dick.""""We'll see,"" his father answered, and from the tone of his voice Ted and his sister were almost sure they would be allowed to have all the animals for their very own. Of course Trouble could hardly expect a hand-organ to go with Jack, the monkey, but that was not much of a loss.""Goodness knows we'll need it,"" said Mrs. Martin, and then she had to laugh. The whole affair seemed to her to be so very funny. Neither she nor her husband had imagined that Uncle Toby's ""collection"" could be anything like this--dogs, a parrot, a monkey, a Persian cat and a little alligator, not forgetting the white rats and mice.""Well, we'd better stay here for the night,"" finally decided Daddy Martin. ""It is warm, and Uncle Toby had quite a number of beds. The house is in good order. I'll turn on the water, and you and the children might go to the store and get things for supper,"" he added. ""It will soon be night.""""There's circus enough here,"" his father said, with a smile. ""But trot along, Curlytops, if you are going to get something for us to eat. The animals have been fed and now it is time for us. I'm getting hungry.""As the children walked down the street with their mother to look for the nearest delicatessen store, they saw the boy Bob carefully wheeling his basket of pigeons toward his own home. He had gotten the birds out of Uncle Toby's barn."
"When Mrs. Martin and the Curlytops, with Trouble, of course, came back to Uncle Toby's house, they found Daddy Martin sitting in front of the kitchen stove in which he had kindled a fire. In his lap was the Persian cat, purring contentedly, and Mr. Martin was rubbing the long, soft silky fur of Snuff.In front of the father of the Curlytops were Skyrocket, Tip, and Top, the three dogs. They were lying asleep near the fire. In the other room were the mice, the rats, the alligator, the monkey, and the parrot, all the animals quiet, for a wonder, as Mrs. Martin said.It did not take long to get up a little supper. Daddy Martin ran the automobile into the side yard of Uncle Toby's house, and the Curlytop family, as I sometimes call them, prepared to stay all night. There were plenty of beds, and in the morning they could turn off the water again, take the pets away, close the house, and everything would be as Uncle Toby wished it.You can easily guess that neither of the Curlytops, nor Trouble, for that matter, wanted to go to bed early that night. The children were thinking too much of the pets. And, indeed, the pets seemed to like the children. Mr. Nip, the parrot, let Jan scratch his head, a form of caress of which he seemed very fond. Jack, the monkey, no longer snatched off Trouble's cap. But perhaps that was because baby William did not wear it near the lively chap. Snuff, the Persian cat, seemed to have taken a great liking to Mr. Martin, and as for the dogs, Tip and Top, they were hardly out of the sight of Jan and Ted. Nor was Skyrocket neglected or jealous. He entered into the fun of playing around on the lawn and porch with the white poodles after supper.""Oh, no! I don't want to wake up Mr. Nip. He has a cloth over his cage to keep him quiet,"" and Mrs. Martin carried Trouble over to where the parrot's cage had been covered with a table-cover for the night.A little later Ted and Janet also went to their rooms, having given farewell pats and rubs to the dogs and cat. Mr. Martin went about, seeing that the house was locked up, and then he and his wife sat downstairs, talking while the children were asleep.""I don't see what else we can do,"" her husband replied. ""The children will be disappointed if we don't. And I don't really want to sell them. Uncle Toby might not like it. I think I'll take them home with us, and write to him, if I can get his address. He must have left it, even if he is going to live in South America.""And, surely enough, it was the police, though how the red and green bird knew it is more than I can say. A passing policeman, seeing the light in Uncle Toby's house, and having been told by Mrs. Watson, the housekeeper, on her way to her sister's, that the place was to be closed, had stopped to inquire."
"After the policeman had gone, the house became quiet again, and nothing more happened until morning. After breakfast the water was turned off, and the home of Uncle Toby was made ready for closing up until the old gentleman should return.The parrot's cage, the box for the monkey, the little tank of water and pebbles in which Slider lived, and the wire cage of the white mice and rats--all these were taken out to the automobile. It was a large one, and there was plenty of room for the Curlytops and their new pets.""As ready as we ever shall be,"" his wife answered. ""My, what a queer load!"" she said, with a laugh, as she looked back at the collection and the children. ""People will think we're a traveling menagerie!""This, however, did not worry the Curlytops. They liked it, and, a little later, they were on their way back toward Cresco. The Curlytops liked their new pets, and they also loved those they had had for a longer time--Skyrocket and Turnover.They stopped for lunch at a little restaurant, and the children were afraid lest some of their pets might escape while the meal was being served. But Mr. Martin saw a young man, sitting in front of a barber shop next to the restaurant, and said to him:So long as he was on guard the Curlytops were satisfied. But when they came out they made a sad discovery. Ted jumped up on the running-board and looked down into the automobile to make sure all the pets were safe. The alligator, the parrot, the white mice and rats, the cat, the monkey, and two dogs were there. But there was no sign of Tip, the white poodle with a black spot on the end of his tail.He seemed to be a nice, good-natured young man, and appeared to be as much surprised as Teddy and Janet were over the loss of Tip. As for Trouble, he was not worrying much. He had climbed into the front seat of the automobile, and was playing with Snuff, the yellow Persian cat. As long as Trouble had some animal near him he did not worry much about anything else.""Have you been right here all the while, young man?"" asked Mr. Martin of the youth who had been left on guard. ""You didn't go away, did you, and give someone a chance to come up and take one of the dogs?""""Oh, no, sir! I stayed right here all the while. I sat down on the running-board and waited. The only thing that happened was that the alligator tried to crawl out, but I put him back. I was sitting here, thinking how funny it was that anybody should have so many pets, when, all of a sudden, I felt something rough on my neck."""
"""It was the little alligator, with his rough tail,"" explained the young man, who said he was called ""Shorty"" by his chums. He was very tall, and perhaps that was why he was called ""Shorty,"" in fun you know. ""It was the little alligator that was crawling up my shoulder and scratching my neck,"" he explained. ""I put him back in his cage, or tank, or whatever you call it, though I was afraid he'd bite me.""""The dog must have jumped out on the opposite side of the car from where you were sitting,"" said Mr. Martin to Shorty. ""Though if that had happened I should have thought you would have heard him,"" and the father of the Curlytops looked rather sharply at Shorty.""I mean someone may have stepped up softly, when this young man had his back turned, and, reaching over, may have lifted Tip up and taken him away. I wish you had sat in the auto, Shorty, instead of outside on the step.""""Yes'm, I wish so myself,"" agreed the young man. ""But there were so many animals in there I thought I'd better be on the outside so I could chase 'em quicker in case any got away. And one did get away and I never saw him! I'm terribly sorry! I'll go down the street and see if I can find him.""""I wish you would,"" remarked Mr. Martin. ""Just take a look, and ask everyone you meet if he saw a white poodle with a black tip on the end of his tail. If you find him I'll give you a dollar besides the fifty cents for watching the auto.""""I'll do my best,"" promised the young man. ""It was my fault, in a way, that he got a chance to go away. I should have been looking on both sides of the auto at once, but I didn't. I'll see if I can't find him.""""I can't be sure,"" answered the father of the Curlytops. ""He looks like an honest young man, but if he knew what a valuable dog Tip was he might have let some friend of his step up and take away the pet animal.""""Maybe there wasn't time to take but the one,"" her husband explained. ""And perhaps I am wrong, and Shorty is right. Tip may have seen some other dog on the far side of the street, and have jumped out of the car to go up to him. It's too bad, but maybe we'll get him back.""""I think they'll not go far,"" said her husband. ""Oh, no, you don't!"" he suddenly exclaimed. ""Come back here! We don't want to chase _you_!"" and he made a hasty grab for Slider, the pet alligator, who seemed to want to get out of his glass-sided tank. ""I'll be glad when we get Uncle Toby's menagerie safely home,"" said Mr. Martin."
"""Oh, I suppose we shall get to like them all,"" agreed Mr. Martin. ""We'll have to let Ted and Janet make places for them in the barn. It is warm weather now, and even the tropical animals, like the monkey, can stay out there.""""Hello, Polly!"" answered Mr. Nip. ""I'm a crack-crack-cracker!"" he shouted at the top of his voice, and several persons, passing along the street, turned to smile at the Martins with their automobile load of pets. Then Mr. Nip began to whistle, so very much like a boy, that Skyrocket, Ted's dog, imagined his master was whistling to him, and barked in answer. Then Top, the remaining pet poodle, also began to bark, and Jack, the monkey, chattered in his own queer way.""I wish we were at home!"" exclaimed Mrs. Martin, who did not like so many strange persons staring at her and her husband and Trouble. But Trouble, who was trying to smooth down the fluffy fur of the Persian cat, did not seem to mind.""Oh, I'm not going to give a parade,"" answered the father of the Curlytops. ""We are just waiting to see if we can find one of our pets, a trick dog that ran away--or that was taken away,"" and he explained what had happened.Ted and Janet sadly shook their heads. They had looked up and down several streets, they explained, but Tip was nowhere in sight. Nor had they seen Shorty since he, also, started to look for the missing animal.""Well, we can't stay here much longer,"" decided Mr. Martin. ""If we do, some more of Uncle Toby's pets may run away. We'd better get home. I'll leave you my name and address,"" said the father of the Curlytops to the policeman. ""And if you hear anything of the missing dog please let me know.""Mr. Martin waited a little longer, and when the young man did not come back, and when there was no sign of the missing Tip, it was thought best to start for Cresco. So, with one of Uncle Toby's pets missing, the trip was resumed.""Yes,"" Teddy answered. ""We'll give a show and make money. We can ask real money to see all the animals we have,"" and he looked down at the parrot's cage, the box of Jack, the monkey, the cage of the white mice and rats, and the tank of the alligator.They could not be sure whether the pet dog had run away himself, or whether someone had reached in over the side of the car and lifted him out. Someone may have done that while Shorty turned his back, saying nothing and not trying to stop him.""I am sorry, but I think Shorty had something to do with Tip getting away,"" said Mr. Martin. ""If that young man had been honest he would have come back and told us he couldn't find the dog. I should not have allowed Shorty to watch our auto. But it is too late, now, to be sorry."""
"The Curlytops reached their home just before supper, and there was so much to do, making places in the barn for Uncle Toby's pets, seeing that they were comfortable, and that they could not get out during the night, that, for a time, Ted and Janet forgot about the loss of Tip. If he had been the only pet, of course they would have missed him very much. But they had so many now that they were kept busy. Still, they wished, very much, that Tip could be found.In due time the pets were put away for the night. The barn was a good place for them, and after they had been fed and given fresh water, which all pets need as much as they do food, the children left the animals to themselves.How long they had been asleep neither Ted nor Janet knew, but they were suddenly awakened in the night by hearing screams. The screams came from the open window of the house next door, where Mrs. Blake, a very nice lady, lived with her two servants. Her husband was dead, and her children had married and gone away. Mrs. Blake's bedroom was opposite the adjoining sleeping rooms of Ted and Janet, and often the Curlytops would call ""good morning"" across to Mrs. Blake. Teddy and Janet, sleeping in their rooms on the side of their house nearest to the home of Mrs. Blake, were the first to be awakened by the screams of the frightened lady. For that Mrs. Blake was frightened anyone could tell who heard her cry.By this time Teddy had jumped out of his bed and had run to his window. At the same time Janet, in the next room, had jumped out of her bed and had run to her window. Both children looked across the yard to the home of Mrs. Blake. They could see her, in the moonlight, standing at her window.""What's the matter, Curlytops?"" called their mother, across the hall. She had been awakened, not so much by the cries of Mrs. Blake as by the movements of Ted and Janet. ""What's the matter?"" asked Mrs. Martin.By this time Mr. Martin, who had gotten up, had been told by his wife that something was wrong in Mrs. Blake's house. He put on some clothes and hurried downstairs, carrying a flashlight in one hand and his revolver in the other.Mr. Martin ran across the lawn to the front porch of Mrs. Blake's house. By this time several other neighbors had been awakened be the lady's screams, and some of the men came out, partly dressed, to see what was going on.""But there _is_ a burglar here!"" said Mrs. Blake from the head of the stairs, where she now stood. ""I was awakened by a noise in my room, and when I looked at the window, I saw in the moonlight, sitting on the sill, a fuzzy little old man. He's a burglar, I'm sure of it, and I wish the police would come!""""I think there are enough of us here now, Mrs. Blake, to look after two or three burglars without the police,"" said Mr. Martin, as he glanced at several neighbors who had come in. ""Let's have a look around,"" he went on. ""I fancy, if there was a burglar, that he has gotten away by this time."""
"""I'll show you,"" answered Mr. Martin, as he thrust his arm under the chair. ""Come out of there, Jack!"" he went on, and out from beneath the chair he pulled--Jack, Uncle Toby's pet monkey! Poor Jack was as much frightened as Mrs. Blake had been, but he cowered down in Mr. Martin's arms and looked up into the face of the father of the Curlytops as if saying:""Yes, it must have been him that I saw perched on my window,"" said Mrs. Blake. ""In my alarm, it did look like a fuzzy, little old man, and of course I thought it was a burglar. I was foolish. It was a very small burglar. I didn't know you kept monkeys, Mr. Martin.""""I only keep one,"" he said, ""and I don't exactly keep that, myself. It's one of the children's pets. It used to belong to my Uncle Toby, and we just brought Jack home this afternoon. We put him in the barn with the white mice and the alligator----""""We didn't have until to-day--or rather, yesterday, for it is now past midnight,"" Mr. Martin explained. ""My Uncle Toby left me his collection of animals when he went away suddenly, and Ted and Janet say they are going to have a circus.""""Now, Curlytops,"" said Mr. Martin, at breakfast the next morning when the excitement of the night was being talked over, ""if you are to keep Uncle Toby's pets here, we must be careful that they do not bother the neighbors. Your own dog and cat are very good, and make no trouble. But with a monkey, a parrot, another dog and cat, to say nothing of the alligator and the white mice, we may cause a lot of trouble to our good neighbors. And we wouldn't want to do that.""""We must make cages that can be locked at night, or else we must make sure that the barn is tightly closed,"" said his father. ""I don't suppose, during the day, that there will be much trouble. It is at night we must be careful. No one likes to be awakened by seeing a monkey on the window sill.""""Well, ladies like Mrs. Blake don't care for such thrills,"" returned Mr. Martin, with a laugh. ""So we must be sure that all the members of our menagerie are safely caged each night. I shall depend on you Curlytops for that.""""Well, then I will leave the pets to you Curlytops,"" said their father. ""It is on your account that your mother and I are keeping them instead of selling them, and while they will be some care, we do not mind if you do your share.""""Yes,"" agreed her brother. ""But maybe I can make Skyrocket let Top ride on his back, and teach 'em some other tricks. Come here, Top!"" he called to the white poodle with the black spot on top of his head. ""Let's see you walk on your hind legs."""
"Top was very willing to do this, and while Ted and Janet sat on boxes in the barn, with their other pets around them, Uncle Toby's poodle went through his performance. When he had walked on his hind legs in a little circle he suddenly sneezed.""Oh, he knows two tricks, besides the one he does with Tip,"" Teddy said in delight. ""Maybe he does a lot more. I wish Uncle Toby had written them down, so we'd know what the dogs can do for our circus.""The cage of the little pet alligator was a sort of tank, in the bottom of which was some water, and in this were little pebbles, like those in some goldfish bowls. The tank stood near a window in the barn where the sun shone in, for Mr. Martin had told the Curlytops that their pets who lived in warm, or tropical, countries must be kept where it was warm and sunny. That was what they were used to in their native lands.As it happened, there was a long, smooth board resting on the upper edge of this box and extending down to the barn floor. Teddy had laid the board slanting fashion on the box when he was making room for the cage of Jack, the monkey.And then, just as if he had made up his mind to do that very thing, Slider wiggled along until he was only holding to the edge of the slanting board by his two hind feet, while his long tail was only partly on the box. A moment later, giving himself a hitch like a boy getting his sled over the top of the hill, Slider went sliding down the smooth, slanting board.""See it? I should say I did!"" cried Teddy. ""Slider slid all right! That's going to be his trick! I'll make a longer board slide, and I'll put the lower end in a pan of water, so when Slider slides down he'll make a splash! That will be a fine trick for the circus! Come on, Slider, slide again!""""I'll go see,"" offered Teddy. He had been among animals so long, and was so kind to them, and he liked them so much, that he was not afraid to try to help even a sick one. And a cat that has a fit is ill, and needs medicine. Sometimes Turnover became ill, and had to be doctored, and more than once Skyrocket, the dog, was in need of some simple home remedy.""No, you must stay with sister,"" said the little girl, as pleasantly as she could. ""Look, I'll show you a new trick that Slider, our pet alligator, can do. Trouble like to see Slider do a trick?"" she asked. ""Come on, Trouble! See Slider do his sliding trick!"""
"Baby William was not proof against this attraction. He ceased trying to pull away from Janet and let her lead him back to the alligator's tank. There Janet took up the scaly, long-tailed creature, which was idly crawling around, and put him on top of the slanting board, as Teddy had been about to do when Trouble told about Snuff. Janet did not mind picking up Slider.The Curlytops were not afraid of animals that many girls and boys do not like to handle. Janet and Teddy knew a great deal about snakes, and they knew that only two kinds that lived in their State were harmful. These were the rattlesnake and the copperhead. All other kinds, such as black snakes, milk snakes and garter snakes can never harm a person. Teddy and Janet knew this, and they had been taught by their father that these harmless snakes did a great deal of good by eating rats and mice that, otherwise, would spoil the farmers' grain.So it was that Janet had learned to pick up even large black snakes, knowing they would not harm her, and once she and her brother had even tamed a good-sized black snake, so that it would let the children pick it up, and it would lie, coiled, in their lap.Snakes can not be tamed, or made to do tricks like other animals, and the stories of ""snake charmers"" are mostly untrue. Some snakes may rise and sway when music is played, and the snakes that circus performers handle are just as harmless as the garden snakes you see. Some of the larger ones, however, are very powerful, and can twist themselves around a person or an animal strongly enough to kill. But the performers know how to handle snakes, using slow and gentle movements, so the reptiles do not mind it.I am not saying that Slider would have done this trick himself, even after much practice. It was mostly an accident, I believe, his coasting down the board when he got to the slanting edge. The alligator just naturally crawled around and, reaching the edge, he fell over, and coasted down. Janet and Trouble put him close to the edge on purpose, so he would go down, knowing that it did not hurt the alligator in the least. I suppose a mud turtle would have done the same ""trick.""Reptiles have a very small brain, and can not be taught to do tricks as can dogs, horses and cats, and the alligator, the turtle and the snake belong to the class known as reptiles. So though the children called what Slider did a ""trick,"" it was more like an accident, though it was not a harmful one.Trouble and Janet were enjoying themselves in this fashion, and Janet was wondering what Teddy was doing, when that young member of the Curlytop family stuck his head in through the open barn door and called:Snuff was on top of a large leather ball, and it was rolling around the yard, with him on top of it, just as a clown in the circus stands upright on a large, painted ball, and rolls himself around the ring. This ball was a football that Teddy had owned for some time. The outside was leather, and inside was a rubber bladder that could be blown up. It was a round ball, of the kind used in ""Association"" games, and not for ""Rugby,"" which most of the football elevens play in this country. The ""Rugby"" ball is shaped like a watermelon, but the other is more like a muskmelon, and it was on this latter kind of a ball that Snuff was rolling around the yard, just like a circus clown.""Maybe Uncle Toby or the lady who owned him first taught Snuff to roll on top of a football,"" Ted answered, while the yellowish brown cat kept on stepping lightly this way and that, making the ball turn over and over. ""I guess Trouble left the ball out here in the yard. He was playing with it last. Then Snuff must have come out, and when he saw the ball he remembered that he knew how to do a trick on it. And he got up and did it without anyone telling him."""
"""We can soon see,"" Teddy said. ""Here, Snuff!"" he called to the big, friendly cat. ""Come over here,"" and Teddy whistled as he did for Turnover. Snuff came as he was called, almost as a dog might do, and Turnover, also hearing the whistle by which Teddy summoned him to meals, came running around the corner of the barn.""We'll put it down in front of Snuff and see if he gets up on it,"" suggested Teddy. And when this was done the big cat from Uncle Toby's jumped out of Ted's arms, and leaped on top of the football, rolling it over and over just like a clown in a circus.Teddy and Janet were so busy talking about the circus they were to get up with their animals that, for a time, they did not watch Trouble. That little chap wandered back to the barn, for he had been much interested in watching the alligator do his trick.""Me make Slider slide some more,"" said Trouble, talking to himself, as he had a habit of doing. Into the barn he toddled. The alligator was swimming around in his small tank of water, but, being a tame and pet reptile, he came out when Trouble stood near the cage.""Oh, my baby! My baby!"" cried Mrs. Johnson, as she ran down off the porch toward a mosquito-netting covered carriage in the front yard. ""A big snake is going to sting my baby! Oh, Trouble! what shall I do?"" Forgetting in the excitement, all about teaching Skyrocket and Top to do some tricks together, as Tip and Top did before Tip was lost, Teddy and Janet ran across the street toward Mrs. Johnson, who was standing beside the carriage in which was her baby. Near her was Trouble, but the little fellow did not seem to be as excited as was Mrs. Johnson.""Trouble,"" cried Janet, as she took hold of her little brother's arm, ""did you tease Ruth?"" Ruth was the name of Mrs. Johnson's baby, and though Trouble was, usually, a good little chap, he might have done something to make a baby cry, Janet realized.""Oh, no, Trouble is all right!"" said Mrs. Johnson. ""It's a big, black snake that has crawled into my baby's carriage. I put Ruth out here to have her sleep, and I looked from the window every once in a while to see that she was all right.""""And she was, for quite a while. But a moment ago, when I looked, I saw Trouble near the carriage, and then I saw a big, ugly snake crawling over Ruth's robe. Oh, where is it? Where's the snake, darling? Did the snake bite you?"" and Mrs. Johnson caught Ruth up from the carriage in her arms."
"""There it is! Look!"" cried Mrs. Johnson, pointing with one hand, while she held Ruth close to her in her other arm. The baby had been rather rudely awakened from her sleep, and she was just getting ready to cry. Her lips were puckering up, and in another moment she would let out a yell. Janet and Teddy knew this, for they had, often enough, watched Trouble do the same thing when he was smaller.""What does he mean?"" asked Mrs. Johnson, crooning to ""Ruff,"" as Trouble called the baby, and making the little one quiet. For William was using some of his ""baby talk,"" which he often did when he was excited.""Yes, we didn't know Trouble was going to do anything like this,"" said Janet, apologizing for her little brother's misdeed. ""But Ted and I were talking about what tricks we'd get Skyrocket and Top to do, now that Tip is gone. And we'd just got through watching Snuff do a new trick on top of a football, so we didn't watch Trouble very much.""Daddy Martin was told, that evening after supper, all that had happened during the day, from the discovery that Slider and Snuff could do tricks, to the finding of the pet alligator in baby Ruth's carriage.The next few days were spent by the Curlytops in getting better acquainted with the animals that had been brought from Uncle Toby's. They liked their new pets more and more the more they saw of them. Of course they wished they could get Tip back, but that trick dog seemed to have vanished.Daddy Martin put an advertisement in the paper, and offered a reward to whoever would bring Tip back, but there were no answers--at least none that amounted to anything. It is true that several men and boys came with strange dogs they thought answered the description of the missing Tip, but none of the animals was the pet so much wanted.Nor was anything heard of the missing youth ""Shorty."" He seemed to have disappeared with the poodle, and the police said they believed Shorty knew where Tip was, and had, perhaps, taken him away in order to sell him.But alas for the hopes of Mr. Martin that his neighbors would not again be troubled by the pets of the Curlytops. It was about a week after the animals had been brought from Uncle Toby's house that, as Mr. Martin was coming home from the store rather early one afternoon, he saw a crowd in front of the bakeshop of Mr. Capper, just around the corner from the home of the Curlytops.He hastened on, and as he came within view of the bakery window he uttered an exclamation of surprise. For there, among the buns, eating them and playing among the other cakes, were several large white rats and mice.""Look at that one big one stand up on his hind legs and nibble a bun just like a squirrel!"" said a man watching the antics of the white rats and mice among Mr. Capper's buns. If this man had only known it, squirrels and rats belong to the same family, that called ""rodents,"" only a squirrel has a much larger tail than a rat or a mouse.""I wonder what in the world Mr. Capper lets those white rats stay in his bakeshop window for?"" thought Mr. Martin, as he ran up. ""They are not harmful, of course, but people will not like to eat bakery stuff after rats and mice, even if they are white, have run around them. It's a poor advertisement."""
"At that moment the baker himself, who had been out in his oven-room, came running into the shop. He gave one look at his window, saw the white rats and mice playing around in and nibbling his choice buns, and then the baker cried:""Whose mice are they? Whose white rats are they? I ask you that!"" cried the baker, who was much excited. ""A little while ago two boys come in to buy cookies. I wait on them, and I go back to my oven. Then the next I know I see a crowd and I come out to find--these!""""Two boys,"" replied the baker. ""They have a box with them--Ha! here is the box now. It is the cage that the mice got out of!"" he cried, pointing to a box with a wire front on the floor of the store, in a corner.""I'm afraid I do,"" said the father of the Curlytops. ""My children got some new pets from an uncle of mine--Uncle Toby. Among the pets were white mice and rats. That is the box we brought them in from Pocono. But how did the box get here?""""I do not know--I forgot to look I was in such a hurry, for my bread was almost burning in my oven. I run to the store quick, as I am all alone now; I wait on the boys, they want cookies; and I run back to my oven. Now I come--the rats--the mice!"" and Mr. Capper, who was a Frenchman, raised his hands in the air over his head in despair. Mr. Martin, the father of the Curlytops, Mr. Capper, the baker, and the crowd of persons in the shop looked at Teddy and his friend, Jimmy Norton, as the two boys hurried into the place. Nearly everyone guessed what had happened, but Mr. Martin wanted to make sure, so he asked:""Well, it was an accident,"" the little Curlytop boy answered. ""Jimmy and I were taking the cage down to the store to have some new wire put on. There's a place where the wire is broken, and it needed fixing so the rats couldn't get out. So Jimmy and I took the cage, and the rats and mice in it, down to the hardware store.""""'Cause there wasn't anything I could leave 'em in,"" Teddy replied. ""I was afraid they'd get out, and maybe go over in Mrs. Johnson's baby carriage, just as Slider did. So I thought if we took the rats and mice right in the cage the man at the store could put some new wire netting over the old, and they couldn't get out."""
"""Well, why didn't you boys take the cage of rats and mice with you when you went out?"" asked Mr. Martin. ""If you hadn't left them here they wouldn't have gotten loose and gone into Mr. Capper's show window to eat or spoil all his buns. Why did you leave the cage here?""""Well, after we'd bought the cookies, and were going to take up the cage of mice and go out,"" Jimmy explained, ""the fire engine came past, and Ted and I ran out to see it and we went to the fire, but it wasn't a big one, and we forgot about the mice; didn't we, Teddy?""""Oh, don't do that!"" begged the little Curlytop boy. ""I'll put the rats and mice back in the cage and I'll fasten the door so they can't get out again. Don't send Uncle Toby's animals away, Daddy! We want to have a circus with them!""""Can we take away the buns and cookies the mice didn't eat?"" asked the little Curlytop chap, as he and his chum began picking up the pets and putting them back in the cage. The animals were tame and did not mind being handled.""Take away all the buns in the window! They are of no more use to me!"" exclaimed the baker. ""But, Mr. Martin, I will not charge you full price for the things--only what it cost to make them. For, as you say, it was an advertisement. And I know the boys did not mean it.""""Indeed we didn't!"" cried Teddy. ""We can take the broken buns and feed them to Skyrocket and Top, and Mr. Nip and Jack will eat them, too,"" he said to his father. ""It will be just as good as buying stale bread for the monkey and the parrot, Daddy. I guess they'll like buns better.""""I shouldn't be surprised if they did,"" laughed Mr. Martin. ""Well, as you say, Teddy, it will save buying stale bread."" Some of the pets were fed on this, and now the broken buns would take its place for a few meals.""I'm a crack-crack-cracker!"" cried the green, red and yellow parrot, as the boys entered. The talkative bird whistled, at which sound Skyrocket and Top, who were asleep in one corner of the barn, awakened and began to bark loudly."
"""Yes, he does,"" admitted the Curlytop chap. ""I have been trying to think what tricks we could make him do in the circus. But the trouble is he doesn't always talk or whistle when you want him to. And when you don't want him to he nearly always does it.""""Well, if you're a crack-crack-cracker, here's a bun-bun-bunner for you,"" laughed Teddy, and out of the bag Mr. Martin had carried from the bakeshop Teddy took several of the broken pieces and fed them to the parrot.Soon such of Uncle Toby's pets as liked this form of food were having all the buns they wanted. Mr. Nip, the parrot, tore his pieces of the buns apart to get at the currants. But Jack, Top and Skyrocket ate theirs down, currants and all, as if they liked every crumb.Cats, dogs and other pets should not be fed too much, though of course they should not be allowed to go hungry very long. When animals can run around as they please, or when they live wild in the jungle or forest, they never eat too much. They know when to stop. But often persons, wishing to be kind, will give their dogs and cats too much meat, or other rich food. And as these pets do not run around and exercise very much, they cannot digest all they eat, so they often become ill. Teddy did not want this to happen to any of his pets.Another thing he was careful about was always to see that they had plenty of fresh water. Nothing is more important than this. It is cruel to have any pet suffer for water to drink, especially in summer. So if you keep pets of any kind, don't feed them too much, but give them plenty of water. They never can take too much of this.And the next day Teddy, Janet and Jimmy began to teach the pets some new tricks. I will tell you about them when the time comes. It was not easy work, and more than once the Curlytops and their friend were discouraged. For just when they thought they had Top and Skyrocket so they would do a trick together, one or the other of the dogs would run away, wagging his tail, however, in friendly fashion, to show there were no hard feelings.The cats were the hardest to teach. Snuff did very well with his ball rolling trick and one or two others, and Turnover would turn in a sort of side-somersault whenever told to do so by Janet. But to teach the two cats to do tricks together was much harder.""We'd like it very much, if you please,"" said Janet, and she was extra polite, to make up for the rather boisterous manner in which Teddy spoke. But the boys meant to be polite and, after all, that is what counts.Soon the Curlytops and their friend were out on the side porch, drinking the cool, rich milk and eating the fresh molasses cookies. It was while they were thus sitting, talking about the circus they were going to give, that into the yard came running Top, Uncle Toby's trick dog. Together the two Curlytops and their friend Jimmy Norton ran out of Jimmy's yard and down the street, following Top, the trick dog. For as soon as Top had seen that Teddy was following after him, which, evidently, was just what Top wanted, the dog raced on, barking wildly."
"As the children were racing down the street, with Top running in front of them, looking back every now and then to make sure the Curlytops and Jimmy were following, a man stopped the children and said:""As if we'd tie a tin can to the tail of our nice Top!"" exclaimed Janet. ""We _never_ tie cans to dogs' tails!"" she added. ""And we're running after Top because he wants us to. He came to get us because something has happened at our house.""The strange man turned and hurried off down the street, and after looking toward him for a few seconds the Curlytops and their chum again hastened along, following Top, who grew more excited all the while.Into the yard of the Martin house dashed Top, closely followed by the children. But the dog did not stop at the house, nor did he run toward the barn where the other pets were kept. When Ted, Janet and Jimmy went over to Jimmy's house they had left the two dogs and the two cats playing outside the barn. Now there was no sight of Snuff and Turnover, nor of Skyrocket, the other dog.""Yes, unless his head under,"" agreed Teddy. ""But I don't believe it's Trouble. If it was anything like that, Top wouldn't come all the way to your house after us, Jimmy. He'd have barked and have gotten someone around here to come to the rescue.""Barking and still wagging his tail, to show how glad he was that the children were coming where he wanted them, Top led the way down along the brook. The Curlytops passed the place where they had played ships the day Trouble was sent afloat in the box--the day Uncle Toby's letter came, telling about the pets he was leaving.A bark was the dog's answer. But a moment later, as the children turned a bend in the stream, they heard a howl coming from a bunch of tall cat-tail plants growing on the edge of a swamp not far from the brook. It was the mournful howl of a dog in pain.Teddy pointed to where, half hidden in the mud, water, and grass, was a spring trap. It was fast to a chain, and the chain was attached to a wooden stake, driven into the ground. But, worst of all, the steel jaws of the trap had snapped shut on the lower part of Skyrocket's left hind leg. The poor dog tried to stand up, but could not, as whenever he attempted to move the chain held him back.So while Top looked on, whining in sympathy with his injured dog friend, and while Janet softly rubbed the head of Skyrocket, the two boys opened the trap. While Jimmy held it steady Teddy stepped on the strong spring with his foot. This was the only way to open it.In another moment the trap was gently pulled loose from the leg of Skyrocket, and the poor dog, with a whine of thanks, managed to stand up. He tried to step on the injured leg, but quickly drew it up with a howl of pain."
"""A dog can get well with a broken leg, but a horse can't,"" said Jimmy. ""At least a horse never does, because he is so big he can't be kept off his leg until it heals. A horse can't go on three legs like a dog.""""There goes Skyrocket on three legs!"" called Teddy, for his pet hobbled along a little way, to a drier part of the swamp, and then lay down and began licking with his red tongue the leg that had been caught in a trap.""It's a smooth-jawed trap, not the kind with the teeth like a saw,"" said Jimmy, looking at the trap which had been allowed to spring shut after Skyrocket's leg was drawn out. ""They use big traps, with terrible sharp teeth and jaws, to catch bears,"" said the little boy.""It's an old one, and rusty,"" went on Jimmy, looking at the trap, while Teddy got some water from the swamp in the top of his cap, and poured it over the bruised place where Skyrocket's leg seemed to hurt most. The water appeared to ease the pain a little, and the dog whined gratefully. Top, now that his work of bringing someone to the rescue was over, stretched out in a cool place and rested, breathing with his mouth open and his tongue hanging out. This is the way dogs always cool themselves.""Yes, it's an old, rusty trap,"" agreed Teddy, coming up to look at the thing that had caught Skyrocket. ""I guess some muskrat hunter left it here, all set and ready to catch some animal that came along, ever since last winter. Maybe the spring was rusty, and not so strong, and that's why it didn't break Skyrocket's leg.""""Oh, it isn't far, and he can go on three legs,"" said Teddy. ""Come on, old fellow,"" he called, and Skyrocket managed to hobble along the brook path and up to the house. Top walked along beside him, every now and then putting out his tongue and gently licking his companion.""Why, children! what is the matter? Has anything happened, Curlytops?"" asked Mrs. Martin, who had reached home with Trouble by the time the two boys and Janet made their way up the back path to the house.""I guess you'd better have the man from the bird store come up to see your parrot,"" said Mr. Martin, when he went out to the barn at the children's request to look at Mr. Nip. ""Your mother will call the bird man on the telephone.""And when the bird man--that is to say the man who kept the bird and fish store--came to see Mr. Nip, he said the parrot should be kept in the kitchen and fed special food with a little medicine in it for a few days. The Curlytops cuddled down in their beds. Janet said afterward that she pulled the clothes over her ears. Teddy did the same at first, and then he began to think. And his first thought was that someone besides those who had a right to be there, were in his mother's kitchen. And of course the next thought that came to Teddy was:""They're burglars trying to get our parrot!"" quickly thought Teddy. ""I'm not going to let them have Mr. Nip. If they take him away he can't be in our circus. Course he can't do tricks like Skyrocket and Top, but he's nice to look at. The burglars shan't get Mr. Nip!"""
"Teddy slipped out of bed and went, as softly as he could, to the room where his father and mother slept. They were sound in slumber, which is the reason neither of them heard the parrot talking and screeching. Besides, the rooms of Teddy and Janet were nearer the kitchen.""What is it? What's the matter?"" suddenly asked Mrs. Martin. In another instant she had pulled the cord attached to an electric light over her bed, and the room was bright in a moment. Then Mr. Martin awakened, and both parents looked at the little Curlytop boy.Mr. Martin did both. He went to the window and fired a shot from his revolver up into the air. My! what a loud noise it made, and it set Skyrocket and Top to barking out in the barn. Perhaps the monkey chattered also, but he could not be heard. However, Mr. Nip's shrill shrieking seemed to resound all over the neighborhood.""Janet, you come in and stay with Trouble,"" called Mrs. Martin ""I'll get dressed, and then, when the police come, we must see what the burglars have taken! Oh, what a dreadful night! I hope they haven't stolen much!""By this time Janet had gone in to Trouble, comforting him, stopping his frightened sobs, and telling him a little story. And then several neighbors, roused by Mr. Martin's shooting, came in, and a little later the police arrived.An examination was made in the kitchen, and it was found that the burglars had broken open a window and had thus come into the house. But no sooner had they entered than Mr. Nip roused up and began to talk. And it was his talk and his loud voice that had awakened Janet and Teddy.The burglars, fearing the parrot would awaken someone, had tried to silence him by throwing something over the cage. But the bird, who was always more excited when strangers were around, kept on screeching and yelling. Then one of the burglars, in his anger, must have thrown something at the parrot's cage, knocking it over, and this was one of the crashes heard upstairs.And there is no question but what Mr. Nip had done that. Bringing the sick parrot into the kitchen had been the means of scaring away the burglars. No thieves will stay in a house at night if they hear someone moving around, or hear voices, and these bad men may have thought at first that Mr. Nip was some real person, calling for the police.""He'll sure be in our circus now,"" said Teddy, as he made ready to go back to bed again, the neighbors and police having left. ""Everybody will want to see a parrot that drove away two burglars, won't they, Daddy?"""
"In fact, Mr. Nip became quite celebrated. For there was an account in the newspaper of the attempted burglary at the Martin house, and the part the parrot had played was well told, so that all over Cresco Mr. Nip was talked about.""What are you going to do with the money you get from your circus--if you get any?"" asked Mrs. Martin of the Curlytops one day about a week after the burglars had gotten in. By this time Mr. Nip was quite well again, and could go back to the barn to be with the monkey, the alligator and the white mice and the rats.As the days passed the Curlytops and their friends worked with Uncle Toby's animals, teaching them several new tricks. More than once Teddy and Janet wished they had Tip, the missing dog, as he had performed so well with Top. But no word had come about him, and it was felt he was gone forever.That last trick was a new one, and really had not been intended for Snuff. One day Teddy and Janet were getting some paper-covered hoops ready for Skyrocket or Top to jump through, as the dogs seemed to like that trick. Snuff and Turnover were playing together near by, and when Turnover chased Snuff, the Persian cat leaped right through a paper hoop.But now the Curlytops planned to teach Jack, their monkey, some tricks in addition to a few that he had learned from Uncle Toby or the sailor. So Jack was brought out from his cage and given a banana, fruit of which he was very fond.""I think a jumping trick would be good,"" Teddy answered. ""I'll go and get some boxes, and we'll make a high thing, like a tower, of them. We'll get Jack up on top, and have him jump down. That will be great, won't it?""The Curlytops left their monkey sitting on a bench in the yard while they went back into the barn after the boxes. Jack was peacefully eating his banana when Teddy and Janet left him. But when the children came out with the boxes, it having taken longer to find them than they had thought, Jack was not to be seen.But there was no chattering answer, and the monkey was not to be found. He had not gone back into the barn, where the other pets were, and Trouble, who was playing in the back yard, said Jack had not passed him. Perhaps it would have been better for the Curlytops to have run into the house and have told their mother about the missing monkey. But neither Janet nor Teddy thought of this, because they were so excited over the news that Mrs. Johnson gave them--the news that Jack had been taken away by a hand-organ man.""Come on!"" called Ted, and out of the yard he ran, followed by Janet. The Curlytops took one look to make sure that Trouble was safe before going away and leaving him. The little fellow was playing with Turnover and Skyrocket. He would do that for a long time.""Yes, right down that street,"" answered the mother of Baby Ruth. ""But you had better not chase after him. He might not give Jack back to you, and he might be cross, and maybe it wasn't your monkey he had at all, Curlytops!"""
"But Teddy and Janet did not stay to hear all this. They hurried on, Teddy a little ahead of his sister, because, being a boy and a year older, he could go faster. But every now and then he stopped to wait for her. They turned the corner of a street, and Teddy, being in the lead, had the first glimpse down it.""Then you'd better get up here in the wagon with me,"" went on the grocery man, ""and I'll drive you down the street. It will be quicker than walking, and, as I've delivered all the orders, I'm in no hurry to get back to the store. Hop up, Curlytops!""He helped Janet and Teddy to the seat beside him, and drove off. It was not the first time the children had ridden with Mr. Anderson, for he often took them with him when he had occasion to stop at their house.""We don't know,"" answered Teddy. ""We didn't see him. We were in the barn, getting some boxes so Jack--that's the monkey--could do some tricks. We left him eating a banana, and when we came out he was gone. But Mrs. Johnson said she saw a hand-organ man come out of our yard and he had a monkey.""""Oh, now I know we'll get him back!"" exclaimed Janet, and there was a smile on her face where, before, there had been a sad look, which always came just before she cried. ""I'm glad we met you, Mr. Anderson,"" she said.""Maybe it isn't your monkey,"" said the grocer. ""All monkeys look alike to me. I couldn't tell one from the other, but maybe you can. Giddap, Molasses!"" he called again to his horse, and down the street clattered the Curlytops.""Here! Hold on a minute!"" called the grocer, getting down off the seat, and then helping Teddy and Janet down. ""If you have a monkey belonging to these children you must give it back, or I'll call a policeman!""He would have been off down the street and around the corner in another few seconds, but Teddy, rushing after him, looked and made sure it really was Jack that the organ player had with him. There was a queer little tuft of white hair on the end of Jack's tail, and this monkey had the same mark.But just then Jack acted for himself. With a shrill chatter he broke loose from the string that was tied to the collar about his neck. There had been no cord on him when he was eating a banana in the yard of the Curlytops, and the hand-organ man must have tied it there after he took the children's pet. Once free, Jack made one leap and landed safe in Teddy's arms."
"Now, Jack was rather a large monkey, and, jumping from a distance, as Jack did, he knocked Teddy over. Flat down on the sidewalk sat Teddy, the monkey clinging with its hairy arms about the little boy's neck.Jack chattered, clung tighter to his master, and then the crowd that had gathered also laughed. For it looked so odd to see Teddy sitting on the sidewalk, with a monkey, quite a large one, clinging to his neck.But with a half-smothered cry of anger, the Italian started to run down the street, his hand-organ swaying from side to side on his back. He had no wish to meet Policeman Cassidy and be arrested for having taken Jack.And that is just what the Italian had done. He had sneaked into the yard and, seeing the monkey unfastened and eating a banana, had picked up the pet and hurried off with him. The Italian must have known how to talk to and handle monkeys, for Jack made no outcry, but went peaceably with his captor. Perhaps the monkey was afraid of being beaten. And, so that Jack could not get away, the Italian had tied a string to the collar.But, thanks to Mr. Anderson and the grocery wagon, the Curlytops had gotten back their pet. The Italian had not played his organ very near the home of Teddy and Janet for fear of their hearing it, I suppose. But when he thought he was far enough away he started, and Sam White had heard him.""Perhaps,"" agreed the grocer, as the crowd began to melt away, seeing there was to be no more excitement. ""And now if you Curlytops, and your monkey, will get into the wagon, I'll drive you back home.""""No, thank you, I guess not,"" answered Teddy, as he rubbed Jack's fuzzy head. ""We got our monkey back, and now we can start to teach him some tricks for the circus. We'll send you a free ticket to the show, Mr. Anderson, 'cause you helped us get Jack back.""""I guess he won't come,"" said Teddy. Then he and his sister climbed up on the seat beside Mr. Anderson and were driven back to their home. It was time, too, for their mother was out at the gate, holding Trouble by the hand, and looking up and down the street.""He's been singing that Mother Goose verse, 'Barber, barber! shave a pig. How many hairs will make a wig? Four and twenty, that's enough, give the barber a pinch of snuff.' I suppose Trouble thought maybe Snuff, the cat, had something to do with a barber, and he got Jack mixed up in it somehow. But I am glad you Curlytops are home again. I was getting worried about you. What are you going to do now?"""
"""Oh, you'll be more bother than you will help,"" replied Janet. ""You'll be knocking the tower over all the while, or trying to climb up on it. You go and play with Skyrocket and Turnover,"" she advised, as the dog and cat came around the path.Having made sure that Jack was comfortable and had not been harmed by the Italian who took him away, the Curlytops set about building, of old packing boxes, the tower off which they hoped their monkey would leap, thus doing a new trick for the pet circus. Teddy and Janet were so busy they paid no attention to Trouble, except to notice, now and then, that he was playing at the end of the yard with Skyrocket and Turnover, or ""Sky"" and ""Turn"", as he shortened the pets' names.""No,"" agreed Janet, ""we don't. He might hurt himself, or he might get scared, and then he wouldn't want to be in the circus. But we ought to have some sort of net for him to jump into, didn't we ought, Teddy?""""Oh, no, I don't s'pose so,"" answered Teddy. ""It won't hurt the curtain. Jack isn't so big that he'll tear it, and if it gets dirty, an' maybe it will a little, we can wash it again. You get Jack now, and I'll get the curtain. Then we'll make Jack climb up to the top of the box tower and jump off.""""I'll put a piece of banana up there on the top box,"" Teddy answered. The pile of boxes, nailed together, was higher than his head, but he had brought out the stepladder so he could reach up with that.But just then both Teddy and Janet saw a sight that made them cry out in surprise. And the sight was that of Trouble, coming around the corner of the barn, driving before him Turnover and Skyrocket, the first cat and dog pets the Curlytops had ever owned. But Turnover and Skyrocket had never looked so funny as they did now, with Trouble urging them on and crying:For that is what baby William had done. With bits of string, straps and strips torn from some pieces of cloth he had found in the barn, he had made a crazy jumble of a harness for the dog and the cat. They were tied and fastened together.But this was not all. Besides harnessing the dog and cat together, like a team made up of a big horse and a little pony, Trouble had made the two pets fast to a small express wagon that he claimed as his very own, though it had once belonged to Teddy.In her earlier days Janet had a large rag doll, which had been named Miss Muffin, just why no one knew. But as she grew older and had other dolls, and finally had come to play more with her brother and the pets than with such toys, Janet had forgotten all about Miss Muffin. So the rag doll had been tossed here and there, sometimes in one corner and sometimes in another, getting more ragged, torn and dirty as the weeks went by.But Baby William had found this old doll and had tied it to the little seat in his express wagon. And there sat Miss Muffin, one eye partly scratched off her painted cloth face, and the other eye, by some accident, skewed around until it was standing up and down, and did not lie sideways as most eyes do.""Sure you may be in the circus,"" said Janet. ""It will be one of the best acts. And we can tie ribbons on the necks of Sky and Turn, as Trouble calls them, to make it look prettier. Go on, Trouble,"" she said to her little brother, ""let's see you drive 'em around the yard. Maybe they'll break away, or get all tangled up, and then it wouldn't be a good act for our show,"" she said to Teddy."
"It was time to see if they could get the monkey to do what was wanted of him. The tower of boxes had been built, and Teddy had two bananas, one to get Jack to climb up on top of the pile, and another yellow fruit to induce the monkey to leap down. The lace curtain net had also been provided.With another chatter, Jack scrambled out of Teddy's arms, and with the usual quickness of monkeys, was soon on top of the pile of boxes--the ""tower"" as Ted and Jan called it. When they gave their circus they planned to cover the pile of boxes with green boughs and pretend it was a big tree in the jungle.""Yes, and if he does the last part as well it will be fine!"" declared the little Curlytop boy. ""But the last is the hardest part. Jack may want to climb down instead of jumping. But first we'll let him eat the banana, and get hungry for the second one.""So the three children stood on the ground, and watched Jack, up on the tower, eating his banana. The monkey looked down, making funny faces, which he seemed to be doing most of the time, and Trouble laughed.Mrs. Martin had not seen the Curlytops take her lace curtain off the line to use for a circus net. If she had, she would, of course, have stopped them. But Teddy and Janet did not think they were doing anything very wrong. As for Trouble, he never bothered his head about it. Whatever Ted or Janet did was all right to him.This was done, and when the curtain was held stretched as tightly as Janet and Teddy could pull it, as they had once seen the Cresco firemen stretch out a life-net in a practice drill, the banana was placed in the center.With a chatter of delight at the good things he was getting to eat, Jack came down, but not exactly in the way Janet and Teddy wanted him to. For the pet _climbed_ down the boxes, which were of different sizes, making many places where he could hold on by his hands and tail. He didn't jump at all!With a chatter and a scramble, Jack reached the ground, ran around the net to where Trouble stood, and then just reached up, plucked the fruit from the little chap's hand and began to eat it. And it was all done so quickly that Ted and Janet hardly had time to say a word.Teddy took the fruit away from his fuzzy pet, and Jack jabbered and chattered at the top of his voice, for he did not like this at all. To have a banana taken away when he was just half finished with it! That didn't seem fair!""He's learning to go up fine!"" declared Teddy, as he got down and moved the ladder away, so Jack would not use that in his descent. ""If we can only make him jump now. Get ready, Trouble, to hold up the banana again."""
"Anxiously the Curlytops and their little brother watched Jack perched rather high on the tower of boxes. The monkey made short work of the small piece of banana that had been put on his high perch. Then he looked down for more.""Never mind, dear,"" consoled Janet. ""If Jack doesn't jump this time we'll let you go. We can put a stick in the ground near the edge of the net, and tie the banana to that if Trouble is tired,"" she said to Teddy. Mrs. Martin ran as fast as she could from the back door of the house to that part of the yard where the Curlytops and Trouble were planning and practicing the new circus trick. Ted and Janet heard their mother's cry, and, for the first time, realized that perhaps they had done wrong in taking the lace curtain for a net.In another instant, after landing lightly on the ground, Jack sprang up, grabbed the banana away from Trouble, and then made a flying leap for the nearest tree, trailing the lace curtain after him, dragging it on the ground, catching it on the branches of the tree and tearing it worse than ever.So suddenly did Jack snatch the piece of banana away from Baby William that the little fellow was knocked down, just as Jack, leaping away from the Italian hand-organ man, had knocked Teddy to the sidewalk.""Oh, you Curlytops!"" cried Mrs. Martin, trying not to laugh, for it was all rather funny in spite of the fact that one of her curtains was ruined. ""However, it can't be helped,"" she went on. ""Only, next time, come and ask me when you want a circus net.""""Oh, no! He likes the circus! Or he will when we get it started,"" declared Teddy. ""We've got lots to do yet, but I guess we can have it in about two weeks. We'll get Jack to practice his jump some more.""It was two or three days after this, during which time the Curlytops had taught their pets several new little tricks, that their mother called Janet and Teddy to her one afternoon. Mrs. Martin held a letter in her hand, the postman having just left it for her.""No, indeed,"" answered her mother, with a laugh. ""We haven't heard from Uncle Toby since he left for South America. I suppose, by this time, he is sitting in the jungle, watching hundreds of parrots and monkeys.""""Yes,"" said Janet. ""It's to be five cents for big boys and girls, and three cents for little ones like Trouble. Of course Trouble won't have to pay, 'cause he's going to be part of the show. But what is your letter about, Mother?""""It's about your circus,"" was the answer. ""At least now that I know you are really going on with the performance this letter will have something to do with it. This is a note from some ladies who, like me, belong to a charitable society,"" said Mrs. Martin. ""The secretary has just written me, asking if I can not think up some plan to raise money so some poor orphan children may be sent to the country to board for a few weeks this summer."""
"""Just what I was going to say,"" went on his mother. ""You may take in quite a few dollars giving your animal show, and I can think of no better way of spending it than to give it to the orphans. Besides, if it is known that the circus is for charity, many more people will come than would otherwise. So do you Curlytops want to help the orphans?""""Oh, you're going to help all right!"" laughed Janet. ""You're going to drive Turnover and Skyrocket with my old rag doll, Miss Muffin, in the express wagon, and I'm sure you'll be so darling and funny that everyone will laugh.""""And I hope Jack does his jumping trick,"" said Teddy. ""It would be great if we had Tip and Top to perform together. We could charge twenty-five cents for big people to come in if we had the two trick dogs.""It was early evening, and light enough to see in the barn. Top and Skyrocket barked a welcome, Snuff and Turnover mewed their delight at seeing the children, and while Mr. Nip shrieked away about being a ""crack-crack-cracker"" Jack chattered. About the only quiet ones were the white rats and mice, and Slider, the alligator.But in the morning there was bad news for the Curlytops. Their mother, who had gone out to the barn to open the door for the animals, came hurrying back to the house as Teddy and Janet descended for their breakfast. Teddy and Janet looked at each other in sorrow and dismay. It seemed that the worst had happened--Top missing just when they were getting ready for the show! First Tip was gone, and now Top! Could it be true?Teddy started for the barn on the run, and so did Janet. Their mother followed more slowly. She felt very sorry for her Curlytops, as she knew they would be very sad over the loss of their second pet dog.""Yes, I locked it after me when I came out,"" his mother said. ""I wanted to make sure that none of the other pets would get away. But the door was locked when I first went in this morning. It was locked just as you left it last night.""His mother turned the key in the padlock on the outside of the barn door. As the door opened and the Curlytops went in, they were greeted by barks of welcome from Skyrocket, by mews from Snuff and Turnover, the cats, by chattering from Mr. Jack, the monkey, and by shrill cries from Mr. Nip, the parrot, who called as loudly as he could:It was Teddy who finally discovered the open window by which it was thought someone had entered the barn and taken Top out. The window was near the stalls used by the horses before Mr. Martin bought an automobile. In a corner, at the left of the stalls and too high from the floor of the barn for Top to have reached, even in his best jump, was a swinging window. This was open, as Teddy found, and when his mother and Janet came at his call, Mrs. Martin saw that the bolt had been broken."
"""That is how it happened,"" she said. ""Someone opened that window from the outside last night, crawled in, and took Top away. The dog himself could not have gotten out of that high window. Someone must have taken him.""""Top was too friendly to bite anyone unless they harmed him,"" said her mother. ""And I have no doubt but that this man--it must have been a man or a big boy--knew how to be nice to Top. Maybe they gave him a little piece of meat to chew on while they took him away.""""I'll call your father, and ask him what to do,"" remarked Mrs. Martin. ""This is getting serious! Two of Uncle Toby's best pets gone! If he comes back he will think we did not take very good care of his animals.""Mr. Martin came quickly when he heard what had happened. He went to the barn to look, and he agreed with his wife that, during the night, someone had broken open the barn window, had crawled in, and had taken out Top.""Maybe they didn't have time, or perhaps they were frightened away, or they may have wanted only Top,"" said Mr. Martin. ""I think that last is the real reason. A trick poodle, like Top, is valuable. And if he could be placed in a show with his chum Tip, the two would earn a lot of money for whoever had them.""""Well, not so very,"" answered Teddy, trying to make the best of it. ""But if we don't get Top back we still have some pets left. The only thing is that Skyrocket has learned to do some tricks with Top, and if Top doesn't come back Sky can't do those tricks. Oh dear, I wish I knew who had our two trick poodles!""Mr. Martin called up the Cresco police and told them of the theft. Word was also sent to the town where the Curlytops had stopped for lunch the day they had brought home Uncle Toby's pets, when ""Shorty"" had been left on guard.After that there was nothing to do but wait, though Ted and Jan wanted to go around among their friends, asking if, by chance, any of them had seen Top. And after breakfast their mother allowed them to do this.To house after house of their friends and neighbors went the two Curlytops, telling the story of the theft of Top, and asking if anyone had seen him. But it was a hopeless search, as Mrs. Martin knew it would be. For whoever had taken Top, she felt sure, would hide him away, and not let him be seen in or about Cresco, where the pet animal was well known.""What's the matter, Curlytops?"" asked Policeman Cassidy, as he saw Teddy and Janet going along the street one day, having called at several houses, without getting any word about Top. ""What's the matter? Can't you have the circus you were counting on?"""
"""You aren't looking in the right places,"" said the policeman. ""You won't find him at the houses of any of your friends. If he was there he'd run back to you as soon as he got outside. Where you want to look is in some dog show.""""Yes,"" went on Mr. Cassidy. ""I've heard about stolen dogs before. They are taken by men who want to make money. And since Top was a trick dog, as well as Tip, I'm sure someone has them who would put them in a show. So look for a dog show, and when you find it go in and look at the dogs. That's where you'll find Top, and maybe Tip, too. It's in a dog show you should be looking!""The Curlytops thanked him again, and walked off down the street together, filled with a new idea. Eagerly they scanned the walls and fences, seeking for some poster that would tell of a show. And it was not long before they saw just what they were looking for.The advertisement told of ""Professor Montelli's"" wonderful collection of trained and trick dogs. A show would be given every afternoon and evening, the bill said, and, as Teddy had remarked, it was over in the neighboring town of Canfield. Once they were in the trolley, going to Canfield, the two Curlytops felt quite happy. They were happy for one reason, because they were having a ride. Teddy and Janet always liked to be doing things and going somewhere, and this was one of those times.""Oh, that show!"" exclaimed the conductor, with a laugh. ""Why, that's only a little side-show in a tent near where this car runs. I'll let you get off there if you want to, but it isn't much of a show. It isn't a circus, you know,"" he said, as he started the car again, after a very fat lady had gotten off. ""If you're looking for a circus this isn't it. The dog show is only a little side one--the kind they used to charge ten cents to go in and see after or before the regular circus. I hope you Curlytops aren't running away to see a circus,"" he added doubtfully.""Oh, no, sir!"" exclaimed Janet. ""We're looking for our lost dog, and we thought maybe it was with this show. Two dogs we had, Tip and Top,"" she went on. ""They were white poodles and they belonged to Uncle Toby and they could do tricks. But one was stolen when we were bringing them home, and the other night Top was taken from our barn. It's our dogs we're looking for, not a circus."""
"""Well, this Professor Montelli, as he calls himself, has a dog show near the end of my trolley line,"" said the conductor. ""I don't know much about it, as it only came there yesterday. It's in a little tent--a regular side show. I'll put you off near it. But do you think it will be safe for you to go there alone and ask for your lost dogs?""""Oh, we won't go right in and ask for them,"" explained Teddy. He and his sister had talked it over, and they had made up their minds what they would do. ""We'll just go into the show--'cause we have money to pay for our tickets,"" the Curlytop boy explained. ""Then if we see Tip and Top there we'll take 'em right away.""They saw the tent--a small one with a few flags on it--almost as soon as they alighted from the trolley car. It was about three o'clock, and a crowd about the tent showed that the performance was going on, or would soon start.Professor Montelli's name was painted on a strip of canvas over the entrance to the tent, and on either side were painted pictures of dogs doing all sorts of queer tricks. One picture was that of a dog jumping off a high platform into a tank of water.""Maybe we can,"" he whispered back, as they walked up to the tent. ""But monkeys don't like water, I guess. We might get Skyrocket to do the jump. We'll try. But now let's see if Tip or Top are here in this show.""""Pay your dime and step right up. You'll see the world-famed aggregation of canine cut-ups! The funniest dogs you ever saw doing the funniest tricks! There are hound dogs, bulldogs, setter dogs, fox terriers, big dogs, little dogs, all good dogs, and some poodle dogs!""He stepped up to the booth, bought two tickets, and he and Janet went into the tent. At one end was a raised platform, hung about with red cloth. On the platform were some chairs, a table, some pedestals, some paper-covered hoops and other things used in the dog tricks. There were also some board benches, like circus seats, in the tent.Out on the platform came a man with a very black moustache and a little whip. The moustache was under his nose and the whip in his hands. He looked around at the audience, and then in a sing-song voice said:A moment later about ten dogs rushed up on the platform, barking and wagging their tails. Every one of the dogs looked anxiously at the black-eyed and black-moustached man, as if afraid he would hit them with the whip he carried. Each dog seemed to know his or her place, and went to chair, box, or platform, until all were arranged in a half circle back of the man."
"""First Lulu, the highest jumper in the world, will perform some tricks,"" said Professor Montelli. ""Here, Lulu,"" he called, and a long, thin greyhound leaped from a chair and stood ready. This dog jumped over a pile of high baskets, and through some of them, there being no bottoms to them. Then the greyhound leaped over a high pile of chairs.In turn the other dogs did tricks, some of which the Curlytops had seen before, and some of which were new. They quite enjoyed the show, or they would have done so had they not been worrying about getting their own dogs back. They looked anxiously at the dogs on the platform. None of them was Tip or Top.I shall not tell you all about the tricks the dogs in this show did, for I want to tell you about the circus the Curlytops had. Enough to say that Professor Montelli seemed to know a great deal about dogs, though I can not say the trick animals loved him. They seemed more afraid than anything else.""This ends our regular performance, ladies an' gen'men, but I have two more dogs to show you. I have not finished training them yet, an' they can do only a few tricks, but I want you to be satisfied, an' think that you got your money's worth, so you will recommend my show to your friends. I will now show you two more trick dogs. Bring on the poodles, Jack,"" he called to his assistant.""No,"" answered Ted, in disappointed tones, ""Tip and Top were white--not black, except for little spots. These dogs are black all over. We might as well go home. Maybe Policeman Cassidy knows of another dog show.""""Come on now, King! Turn a somersault!"" suddenly cried the dark-moustached man. Instantly one of the black poodles--the one called ""King,"" began turning somersault after somersault. Right out to the end of the platform he turned them, and then he stood there, wagging his tail and waiting for the applause, which he seemed to expect.""I did not mean to hurt him,"" explained Professor Montelli, smiling, but his smile was not a kind one. He seemed to be a cruel man, but he seemed to know that he must not be cruel to his dogs in public. ""Come, Emperor!"" he called more gently. ""Walk on your hind legs!""And then a strange thing happened. All at once the two poodles put their noses together, as though talking, which they may have been doing in dog language. And then the one the man had called Emperor suddenly jumped on top of the back of the dog called King, and King began walking around the stage, giving the other a ride!"
"Something else happening on the platform of the dog show tent. The black poodle called King began walking around in a little circle in the middle of the stage. And, while thus moving, the other poodle began to jump over its companion's back. First this way and then that one poodle jumped over the other poodle's back.Both dogs knew the children, though of course Top, having been with them longer, knew them best. Tip had been taken away soon after being removed from Uncle Toby's house, but when Tip saw that Top was friendly with the children, Tip was joyful also.No sooner did Ted and Janet call the black poodles to them than Professor Montelli grew very angry indeed. He jumped down off the platform, and, going to where the Curlytops stood at their seats, with the dogs frisking around them, the trainer cried:""There! What did I tell you?"" cried the Professor. ""Their poodles were _white_ and mine are _black_! They can't be the same! Here, King and Emperor!"" he cried, and, stooping down he made a grab for the little dogs that were staying near Ted and Janet.With barks and growls the poodles sprang away from the angry man. And, as it happened, the one the man had called ""King"" ran against a pail of water that was near the bottom of the platform. The pail was upset and some of the water splashed over the black dog.Then a queer change took place. Instead of being pure black, the poodle became streaked black and white! The black color began running out of its hair, and formed a little inky pool on the ground beneath the animal.""They're ours!"" insisted Ted. ""Shorty was watching our auto when Tip was stolen,"" he went on, ""and he knew where we were taking Top. I guess Shorty broke into our barn the other night, and took Top and colored him black. These are our poodles, and we're going to have them!""""Oh, well, if you're sure they are your dogs, take 'em!"" growled the showman. ""I didn't know they were stolen. A young fellow sold me one some time ago, and I bought the other of him day before yesterday. I did color the dogs black,"" he admitted, ""because they don't get so dirty as white ones. The dye will wash off,"" he said. ""If you are sure these are your poodles, take 'em along!"" he said to Ted and Janet."
"""The show's over!"" growled the black-moustached man. ""And if I get hold of that Shorty I'll have him arrested for selling me stolen dogs. They were valuable, too--as good trick dogs as I ever saw. Do you want to sell them to me?"" he asked the Curlytops. Hurrying along, as if afraid that Professor Montelli might run after them and take Tip and Top away again, Teddy and Janet went to the corner where they had left the trolley car. Some boys and girls who had been in the dog show followed the Curlytops, and men and women smiled at the children.""I didn't think I'd have you back with me so soon,"" he said. ""But I'm glad to see you. It's sort of against the rules to bring dogs on trolley cars, but I guess yours will be all right, as long as they're trick circus dogs.""""Thank you,"" replied the conductor. ""I shall be glad to come. You can take my name and mail the ticket to me at the car house. I like animals,"" and he patted the heads of Tip and Top. ""But what makes one black, and the other streaked black and white?"" he asked.And the poodles were, coming from the tub as white as snow. Later it was learned that the young man known as Shorty had not really taken Tip from the automobile. But he had gotten a chum of his to do it, and afterward the two had sold the dog. They sold him to Professor Montelli, who used to have a side show with a circus, but who, after a quarrel, started out for himself, traveling around the country giving exhibitions.Shorty, having heard the talk of the Martin family while he was acting as guard of the automobile load of pets, knew where Top was being taken, to Cresco. And it was he who broke into the barn and took away the poodle. For, as I have told you, while one dog was valuable for the tricks he could do, the two, doing tricks together, were worth much more.Professor Montelli may not have known the poodles were stolen, and he may, as he said, have dyed them with harmless black color to keep their white coats from getting dirty. But the police said they thought the dog trainer had a hand, with Shorty, in the thefts, and this may have been so. At any rate the Curlytops had their pet poodles back, and they heard nothing more of Shorty or the showman.It did not take long to make arrangements for the show. Jimmy Norton's father secured a large tent for the Curlytops and their friends, and the tent was set up in a lot not far from the Martin house. Several boys and girls helped make the arrangements, and Mr. Martin sent up from the store a pile of boxes and boards which some of his men made into seats."
"Mrs. Martin told the ladies who had asked her to help raise money for the orphans that the Curlytops were going to give all they took in at the circus to help the poor children. And when this became known many grown folk, as well as boys and girls, bought tickets for the performance.It was to be given one afternoon, and you can imagine all the work that had to be done to get ready. But some of the fathers and mothers of the chums of the Curlytops helped, leaving to Ted and Janet the work of getting the animals ready to do their tricks. Jack Turton was to be a fat little clown, riding on a pony his father had bought for him. Harry Kent and some other boys were to help Teddy, and some of Jan's girl friends offered to help her.And we must not forget Trouble. As arranged, he was to come into the tent at a certain time, driving Skyrocket, the dog, and Turnover, the cat, hitched to his little express wagon, with funny Miss Muffin on the seat.At last the day of the circus came. Into the tent were moved the cages of the white mice and the white rats, the tank containing Slider, the pet alligator, the cage of Mr. Nip, the parrot, and the box of Jack, the monkey. Snuff, Skyrocket and Turnover were on hand. Tip and Top were all ready to perform their tricks.""Yes, I wish Uncle Toby could be here,"" said her brother. ""It's queer about him. He never answered any of daddy's letters. South America must be a good way off, for Uncle Toby hasn't gotten there yet.""And a little while after that the audience began to enter the tent. Boys and girls, of course, were the first, but there were a number of men and women, too, and it was not long before every seat was taken. Mr. and Mrs. Martin just had to be there--they couldn't stay away when the Curlytops were giving a show. Besides, Mother Martin had to help Trouble dress for his act.""Ladies and gentlemen,"" began Teddy, ""and boys and girls. We're glad you came to our circus, and we hope you will like our pets and what they do. And my little brother, Trouble, is going to do an act by himself. He----""The first act was a tableau with Ted, Janet and their boy and girl helpers, not forgetting Trouble, of course, posing on the stage with their pets. Gathered about the children were the dogs, the cats, Mr. Nip, the parrot, Jack the monkey, the white mice and the white rats in cages, and Slider, the pet alligator. Down in the audience Harry Weldon played the mouth organ. He was the ""orchestra.""One after another the animals did their tricks, Ted, Janet and the other boys and girls helping. Mr. Nip, the parrot, after he had been quieted down, walked up and down a little ladder, that was balanced like a see-saw over a tiny board. Mr. Nip would walk to one end of the ladder, and it would go down with him. Then he would walk to the other end, which would then sway downward. And when he had finished this trick Mr. Nip cried:"
"Snuff and Turnover did their tricks, some separately and some together. One of the tricks they did together was to run and jump through a paper hoop, and when Turnover had landed on the other side, through the hoop, he lay down and rolled over and over--one of the first tricks the Curlytops had taught their pet.Again the audience clapped and laughed. But there was more to come. Tip and Top did the tricks for which they were famous, separately and together, one dog walking on his hind legs, and the other turning somersaults. Then one dog got on the other's back, the two going around the stage together. And as a climax they did the trick by which Ted and Janet had recognized their pets in Professor Montelli's tent, one dog leaping over the other's back, while moving along.This went off very well. Janet fixed the slanting board for Slider to coast ""down hill,"" and when the alligator had done this the audience laughed its hardest. Then some of the rats and mice did simple tricks, two of the larger rats pulling a little toy wagon in which rode two mice.Jack, the fat little clown, made a big ""hit."" He was really very funny, and when, toward the end of his act, he got too near the edge of the stage and fell into the lap of big Oscar North, the audience thought it was all part of the show, and not an accident, and clapped most loudly. However, Jack was not hurt, and only laughed at the mishap.""Up, Jack! Up!"" called Ted, climbing up the stepladder and placing the banana on top of the tower. Then Ted had to hurry the ladder away, after Jack had climbed up to the top, for fear the monkey would climb down that same way instead of jumping as he was wanted to do.Ted and Harry Kent held the net at the foot of the tower. This time the net was not a lace curtain, but some old bags sewed together. Janet held up the bit of banana, and, after he had eaten the piece on top of his perch, the monkey looked down at the other bit of fruit.After that Jack did a number of other simple tricks, and then it was time for Trouble to come on in his act. Only a few knew what the little fellow was to do. But when the curtains on the stage were pulled apart by Mrs. Martin and the little fellow walked out, dressed like the pictures of Cupid on valentines, driving the dog and cat harnessed to the wagon, with queer Miss Muffin on the seat, you should have heard the people laugh and clap!And then came the last scene of all, where Ted, Janet, Trouble and their boy and girl helpers, with all the pets, except the parrot, alligator and rats and mice, marched around the stage, while the mouth organ was loudly played.""Yes, Uncle Toby!"" laughed the man. ""I got here a little too late for the show, but you can give it over again for me, and I'll put as much again in the collection box as you have there. How are all my pets?"" and he laughed again and looked at the Curlytops as well as at the animals.""Well, not right away,"" answered Uncle Toby. ""You may keep them as long as you like. I wish I had been here for the show, but here's the ninety-nine cents I promised, and if you give the show for me later on I'll give a hundred dollars for the orphans."""
It was, however, a little too late in the day for that. But, a week later, Uncle Toby did see all the pets put through their tricks and he gave another hundred to the orphan fund, so that many of the poor children had a fine vacation time in the country. =12.
