Tea is over. Mrs. Brown has put the little sitting room in order. The fire burns brightly. One lamp gives light enough for all. On the stool is a basket of fine apples. They seem to say, ""Won't you have one?""New York, Dec. 10, 1878. Dear Santa Claus: Papa is going to give me a Christmas tree, and he says that you will put nice things on it if I ask you. I would like a gun that will shoot, and a rubber ball that I can throw hard, and that will not break Mamma's windows or the big glass in the parlor. Now, please don't forget to come. I live on Fourth St., number ten. I will go to bed at eight o'clock, and shut my eyes tight. I will not look, indeed I won't. Your little boy, Willie. ]6. The name of James's Scotch terrier is Dodger. He is called Dodger because he jumps about so friskily. He is up on a chair, under the table, behind the door, down cellar, and out in the yard,--all in a minute.Beautiful faces are they that wear The light of a pleasant spirit there; Beautiful hands are they that do Deeds that are noble good and true; Beautiful feet are they that go Swiftly to lighten another's woe. ]1. Baby Bye, Here's a fly; We will watch him, you and I. How he crawls Up the walls, Yet he never falls! I believe with six such legs You and I could walk on eggs. There he goes On his toes, Tickling Baby's nose.2. Spots of red Dot his head; Rainbows on his back are spread; That small speck Is his neck; See him nod and beck! I can show you, if you choose, Where to look to find his shoes, Three small pairs, Made of hairs; These he always wears."
"3. Flies can see More than we; So how bright their eyes must be! Little fly, Ope your eye; Spiders are near by. For a secret I can tell, Spiders never use flies well; Then away, Do not stay. Little fly, good day.1. ""If I were a sunbeam, I know what I'd do; I would seek white lilies, Roaming woodlands through. I would steal among them, Softest light I'd shed, Until every lily Raised its drooping head.2. ""If I were a sunbeam, I know where I'd go; Into lowly hovels, Dark with want and woe: Till sad hearts looked upward, I would shine and shine; Then they'd think of heaven, Their sweet home and mine.""3. Are you not a sunbeam, Child, whose life is glad With an inner brightness Sunshine never had? Oh, as God has blessed you, Scatter light divine! For there is no sunbeam But must die or shine.7. When he gave her the money, she said, as she dropped a tear of joy, ""You are a dear, good boy, Henry. I did not know how I could earn enough to buy bread with, but now I think we can manage to get along quite well,"" 1. ""What are you good for, my brave little man? Answer that question for me, if you can,-- You, with your fingers as white as a nun,-- You, with your ringlets as bright as the sun. All the day long, with your busy contriving, Into all mischief and fun you are driving; See if your wise little noddle can tell What you are good for. Now ponder it well."" 2. Over the carpet the dear little feet Came with a patter to climb on my seat; Two merry eyes, full of frolic and glee, Under their lashes looked up unto me; Two little hands pressing soft on my face, Drew me down close in a loving embrace; Two rosy lips gave the answer so true, ""Good to love you, mamma, good to love you.""2. In days that are sunny He's getting his honey; In days that are cloudy He's making his wax: On pinks and on lilies, And gay daffodillies, And columbine blossoms, He levies a tax!3. Buzz! buzz! buzz! The sweet-smelling clover, He, humming, hangs over; The scent of the roses Makes fragrant his wings: He never gets lazy; From thistle and daisy, And weeds of the meadow, Some treasure he brings."
"4. Buzz! buzz! buzz! From morning's first light Till the coming of night, He's singing and toiling The summer day through. Oh! we may get weary, And think work is dreary; 'Tis harder by far To have nothing to do. Marian Douglas.11. ""Then you must not blame the dog, Mary, for he does not know it is wrong for him to play with your doll. I hope this will be a lesson to you hereafter, to put your things away when you are through playing."" 1. ""Clouds that wander through the sky, Sometimes low and sometimes high; In the darkness of the night, In the sunshine warm and bright. Ah! I wonder much if you Have any useful work to do."" 2. ""Yes, we're busy night and day, As o'er the earth we take our way. We are bearers of the rain To the grasses, and flowers, and grain; We guard you from the sun's bright rays, In the sultry summer days.""1. Run, run, thou tiny rill; Run, and turn the village mill; Run, and fill the deep, clear pool In the woodland's shade so cool, Where the sheep love best to stray In the sultry summer day; Where the wild birds bathe and drink, And the wild flowers fringe the brink.2. Run, run, thou tiny rill, Round the rocks, and down the hill; Sing to every child like me; The birds will join you, full of glee: And we will listen to the song You sing, your rippling course along. Forest Hill, June 25, 1878 My Dear Fanny: This morning while out rowing, we all came near being drowned. Brother Ed, in trying to take a stick from Tom Reed, tripped and fell out of the boat. Papa and Mamma caught at him to save him, and before we knew it we were all in the water. The boat upset and how we were all saved I can hardly tell. A man in another boat which was near, picked us up. Had it not been for this, you would to-day have no cousin. Mary Rose.1. Wake up, little darling, the birdies are out, And here you are still in your nest! The laziest birdie is hopping about; You ought to be up with the rest. Wake up, little darling, wake up!"
"2. Oh, see what you miss when you slumber so long-- The dewdrops, the beautiful sky! I can not sing half what you lose in my song; And yet, not a word in reply. Wake up, little darling, wake up!3. I've sung myself quite out of patience with you, While mother bends o'er your dear head; Now birdie has done all that birdie can do: Her kisses will wake you instead! Wake up, little darling, wake up! George Cooper.13. Herbert worked away until he had made the beam and the post. Then he made a hole in the middle of the block, and put the post in. Next, he put the beam into a little groove at the top of the post, so that it would balance nicely.5. So the leaf stopped sighing, and went on singing and rustling. It grew all the summer long till October. And when the bright days of autumn came, the leaf saw all the leaves around growing very beautiful.3. She was a merry little girl, indeed; but she felt sad this morning because her mother had said, ""The children will all have Christmas presents, but I don't expect any for myself. We are too poor this year.""10. So they set her in the basket, and put green branches all around her. It was a jolly ride. They set her down on the doorstep, and went in and said, ""There's a Christmas present out there for you, mamma.""Frosty is the morning; But the sun is bright, Flooding all the landscape With its golden light. Hark the sounds of laughter And the voices shrill! See the happy children Coasting down the hill.There are Tom and Charley, And their sister Nell; There are John and Willie, Kate and Isabel,-- Eyes with pleasure beaming, Cheeks with health aglow; Bless the merry children, Trudging through the snow!3. Soon another branch came drifting down among them, and again they took flight from the river; but when they found the branch had drifted by and done them no harm, they flew down to the water as before.5. The man who had been watching all this, now began to wonder who had set these branches adrift. He looked up the stream, and spied a fox slyly watching the ducks. ""What will he do next?"" thought the man."
"6. When the fox saw that the ducks were no longer afraid of the branches, he took a much larger branch than any he had yet used, and stretched himself upon it so as to be almost hidden. Then he set it afloat as he had the others.1. The spider wears a plain brown dress, And she is a steady spinner; To see her, quiet as a mouse, Going about her silver house, You would never, never, never guess The way she gets her dinner.2. She looks as if no thought of ill In all her life had stirred her; But while she moves with careful tread, And while she spins her silken thread, She is planning, planning, planning still The way to do some murder.3. My child, who reads this simple lay, With eyes down-dropt and tender, Remember the old proverb says That pretty is which pretty does, And that worth does not go nor stay For poverty nor splendor.4. 'Tis not the house, and not the dress, That makes the saint or sinner. To see the spider sit and spin, Shut with her walls of silver in, You would never, never, never guess The way she gets her dinner. Alice Cary.9. ""We have just found out a funny thing about his way of eating. He breaks the bones of a mouse, and then swallows it whole. After an hour or two, he throws up the bones and fur rolled up in a little ball.""5. In winter, as they were too poor to buy much wood or coal, they had little fire; so they used to sit close together to keep warm. Mary would sit on one of the old man's knees, and Jane on the other.7. He would often talk to them of their father, who had gone to sea, or of their good, kind mother, who was in her grave. Every night he prayed God to bless them, and to bring back their father in safety.Sarah. Our life does not depend upon it, but our comfort does, surely. How much more time will it take to put a thing in its place, than to hunt for it or to borrow whenever you want to use it ?10. At last he said, ""It was wrong to break the window, though I did not mean to do it. I will go and pay for it, if it takes all my money, I will try not to be sorry. I do not think the man will hurt me if I pay for the mischief I have done."""
"2. He rang the doorbell. When the man came out, George said, ""Sir, I threw a snowball through your window. But I did not intend to do it. I am very sorry, and wish to pay you. Here is the dollar my father gave me as a New- year gift.""6. His mother said, ""An hourglass is made in the shape of the figure 8. The sand is put in at one end, and runs through a small hole in the middle. As much sand is put into the glass as will run through in an hour.""8. ""Oh yes, it will, my son,"" said his mother, ""The sand moves by little and little, but it moves all the time. 9. ""When you look at the hands of the clock, you think they go very slowly, and so they do; but they never stop.5. ""Fanny,"" said the mother. ""It is such a beautiful morning, I meant to drive down to the village, get some groceries, then call for your Aunt Ann, have a nice ride up the river road, and bring her home to dinner.11. ""Fanny! O Fanny!"" called Jenny, and the beautiful creature turned her head. That gentle tone she well knew, and, glad to see her friend, she carne directly to the fence, and rubbed her head on the girl's shoulder. As soon as the gate was opened, she followed Jenny to the barn.12. The men had treated her roughly, and she remembered it. But she knew and loved the voice that was always kind, and the hand that often fed and caressed her. She gave love for love, and willing service for kindness.15. ""Right in these woods, and in the fields,"" said his teacher. "" Here are lovely blue violets, down by the brook are white ones, and among the rocks are ferns and mosses. Bring them all to my house, and I will help you arrange them."""
"16. So, day after day, Davy hunted the woods for the prettiest flowers, and the most dainty ferns and mosses. After his teacher had helped to arrange them, he took them to the city that was near, and sold them. ALICE'S SUPPER. 1. Far down in the valley the wheat grows deep, And the reapers are making the cradles sweep; And this is the song that I hear them sing, While cheery and loud their voices ring: ""'Tis the finest wheat that ever did grow! And it is for Alice's supper--ho! ho!"" 2. Far down by the river the old mill stands, And the miller is rubbing his dusty hands; And these are the words of the miller's lay, As he watches the millstones grinding away: ""'Tis the finest flour that money can buy, And it is for Alice's supper--hi! hi!"" 3. Downstairs in the kitchen the fire doth glow, And cook is a-kneading the soft, white dough; And this is the song she is singing to-day, As merry and busy she's working away: ""'Tis the finest dough, whether near or afar, And it is for Alice's supper--ha! ha!"" 4. To the nursery now comes mother, at last, And what in her hand is she bringing so fast? 'Tis a plateful of something, all yellow and white, And she sings as she comes, with her smile so bright: ""'Tis the best bread and butter I ever did see, And it is for Alice's supper--he! he!""1. One day, Bessie thought how nice it would be to have a garden with only wild flowers in it. So into the house she ran to find her Aunt Annie, and ask her leave to go over on the shady hillside, across the brook, where the wild flowers grew thickest.4. Her aunt laughed, and said, ""A basket will be better, I think."" So they looked in the closets and the attic, everywhere; but some of the baskets were full, and some broken; not one could they find that would do.5. Then Aunt Annie turned out the spools and the bags from a nice large workbasket, and gave that to Bessie. ""You may have this for your own,"" she said, ""to fill with earth, or flowers, or anything you like.""6. ""Oh I thank you,"" said Bessie, and she danced away through the garden. She slipped through the gate, out into the field all starred with dandelions, down in the hollow by the brook, then up on the hillside out of sight among the shady trees."
