passage
"""The facsimile of 'Goody Two-Shoes,' which Mr Welsh has edited, and Messrs Griffith and Farran published, might be classed among the Christmas books of the season, but it deserves more extended notice, as reproducing a volume which, if hardly known to the present generation, ranks among English Classics. Mr Welsh deserves hearty thanks for the trouble he has taken in producing this neat little volume.""--_Athenæum._ ""Notwithstanding the difficulties of type, the cramped pages that will not keep open, and the hideous woodcuts so faithfully reproduced, we have seen more than one child reject the latest picture book of Mr Caldecott or Kate Greenaway, with its purple and gold, for the hodden grey of 'Goody Two-Shoes.'""--_Pall Mall Gazette._ GRIFFITH & FARRAN _Successors to Newbery & Harris_ WEST CORNER OF ST PAUL'S CHURCHYARD, LONDON FIELD & TUER, YE LEADENHALLE PRESSE, E.C. Early in the present century John Harris--one of the successors to the business of ""Honest John Newbery,"" now carried on by Messrs Griffith & Farran at the old corner of St. Paul's Churchyard--began the publication of a series of little books, which for many years were probably among the most famous of the productions of the House. Now, however, according to the fate which usually overtakes books for children, nearly all of them are forgotten or unknown.The first book in this series which was known as _Harris's Cabinet_ was ""The Butterfly's Ball,"" and was published in January 1807. This was followed in the same year by ""The Peacock at Home"" (a sequel to ""The Butterfly's Ball""), ""The Elephant's Ball,"" and ""The Lion's Masquerade;"" and then (prompted no doubt by the success of these, for we learn on the publisher's authority that of the two first 40,000 copies were sold within twelve months) Mr Harris brought out a torrent of little books of a like kind, of which the titles were: ""The Lioness's Ball,"" ""The Lobster's Voyage to the Brazils,"" ""The Cat's Concert,"" ""The Fishes' Grand Gala,"" ""Madame Grimalkin's Party,"" ""The Jackdaw's Home,"" ""The Lion's Parliament,"" ""The Water King's Levée;"" and in 1809, by which time, naturally enough, the idea seems to have become quite threshed out and exhausted, the last of the Series was published; this was entitled, ""The Three Wishes, or Think before you Speak.""Of this long list of books a few of the titles are still familiar, and one of them, ""The Butterfly's Ball,"" may certainly claim to have become a Nursery Classic. It is still in regular demand; the edition now in sale being illustrated by Harrison Weir; it has been published in various forms, and has figured in most of the collections of prose and verse for the young that have been issued during this century. Probably to the minds of hundreds of people past middle age few lines are more familiar than the opening couplet--""The Butterfly's Ball"" first appeared in the November number of the _Gentleman's Magazine_, where it is said to have been written by William Roscoe--M.P. for Liverpool, the author of ""The Life of Leo X.,"" and well known in the literary circles of his day--for the use of his children, and set to music by order of their Majesties for the Princess Mary. When the verses were subsequently published in book form, the text and pictures were engraved together on copperplates. An edition, with pictures on separate pages, appeared early in the next year, which is the one here reproduced.In this edition there are many variations from the previous one. The allusions to ""little Robert""--evidently William Roscoe's son--do not occur in the former, and many slight improvements, tending to make the verses more rhythmical and flowing, are introduced. The whole passage, ""Then close on his haunches"" (p. 7) to ""Chirp his own praises the rest of the night,"" &c. (p. 10), is an interpolation in this later edition. It is, I believe, certain that the verses were written by Roscoe for his children on the occasion of the birthday of his son Robert, who was nearly the youngest of his seven sons. No doubt when they were copied out for setting to music the allusions to his own family were omitted by the author. A correspondent of _Notes and Queries_--who is, I believe, a niece of the late Sir George Smart--says, in reference to the question of the setting of the verses to music, that-- ""The MS., in Roscoe's own handwriting, as sent to Sir G. Smart for setting to music, is in a valuable collection of autographs bequeathed by the musician to his daughter. The glee was written for the three princesses--Elizabeth, Augusta, and Mary--daughters of George III, and pupils of Sir George, and was performed by them during one of their usual visits to Weymouth."" ""The Peacock at Home"" and ""The Lion's Masquerade"" were, as the title-page puts it, written ""by a Lady,"" and we should most likely have remained in ignorance as to who the lady was if there had not been published in 1816 another little book of a somewhat similar character, entitled ""The Peacock and Parrot on their Tour to discover the Author of 'The Peacock at Home,'"" which, the Preface tells us, was written immediately after the appearance of ""The Peacock at Home,"" but from various circumstances was laid aside. ""In the opinion of the publishers,"" the Preface goes on to say, ""it is so nearly allied in point of merit to that celebrated trifle that it is introduced at this late period."" ""A path strewed with flowers they gaily pursued, And in fancy their long-sought Incognita viewed. Till all their cares over in Dorset they found her, And plucking a wreath of green bay-leaves they crowned her.""Mrs Dorset, according to a note by Mr Dyce which appears on the fly-leaf of a copy of ""The Peacock at Home,"" in the Dyce and Forster Collection at South Kensington, was sister to Charlotte Smith. Their maiden name was Turner."
