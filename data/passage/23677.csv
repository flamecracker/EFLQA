passage
"""Well, Blake, it doesn't seem possible that we have succeeded; does it?"" and the lad who asked the question threw one leg over the saddle of his pony, to ride side fashion for a while, as a rest and change.""No, Joe, it doesn't,"" answered another youth. ""But we sure have got some dandy films in those boxes!"" and he looked back on some laden burros that were following the cow ponies across a stretch of Arizona desert.""Work hard? I should say I have,"" answered Hank Selby. ""Why, the time those Indians charged our cave, and Joe and I, and Munson and his crowd were getting ready to fire point-blank at them, there you stood, with bullets whizzing near you more than once, grinding away at the handle of your moving picture camera as hard as you could. Hard work--huh!""""Why, you're going to look for your father; aren't you, Joe--your father whom you haven't seen since you were a little chap--whom you can't even remember?"" and Blake looked sharply at his chum and partner, Joe Duncan.The two moving picture boys, I might explain briefly, were on their way to Flagstaff, Arizona, after having gone out into the wilds, with a cowboy guide, Hank Selby, to make moving picture films of some Moqui Indians who had broken away from their reservation, to indulge in some of their weird dances and ceremonies.While making these films, the boys and their companion, who were hidden in a cave where the Indians could not see them, saw the redmen about to torture, as they thought, four white prisoners. Joe and Blake recognized these men as their business rivals, who were also trying to get some moving picture films of the Indians, to secure a prize of a thousand dollars, offered by a New York geographical and ethnological society.The white captives, unexpectedly freed, came rushing toward the shelter, with the savages after them, and it looked as if there would be a fierce fight. In spite of this Blake held his ground, taking picture after picture.Unexpectedly in the company was a Sergeant Duncan who proved to be a half-uncle of Joe Duncan, and the sergeant was able to tell the lad where his long-lost father was last heard from, since Joe had only lately learned that his parent was living.But Flagstaff was the real temporary headquarters of the lads, since there was located a theatrical company, engaged in doing some moving picture dramas based on Western life, and Joe and Blake had been hired to ""film"" those plays.They had been given a little time off to make an attempt to get views of the Indians at their ceremonies, and they expected to resume, for a time, making films of more peaceful scenes among their theatrical friends.""Same here,"" came from Hank. ""But say, if it's all the same to you boys, I think we might as well camp here and have grub. This looks like good water and there's enough grazing for the critters to-night. Then we can push on early in the morning, and in a couple of days more we ought to make Big B ranch.""""It seems to take us longer coming back than it did going,"" remarked Blake, as he slid from his pony, and pulled the reins over the animal's head as a signal for it not to wander. ""I thought we'd sure come in sight of the ranch to-day.""""Oh, it's farther than that,"" said Hank, as he looked about for wood with which to make a fire. ""I guess you were so anxious to get on the trail of the Indians on your way out that you didn't notice how much ground you covered. And it was quite a few miles, believe me!""The lads busied themselves, and soon a cheerful little blaze was going, while the tired horses and burros, relieved of the burden of saddles and packs, were rolling luxuriously around at the length of their tether ropes.""Well, yes. You know that society offered a prize of a thousand dollars for the best reel of ceremonial dances, but there were smaller prizes for ordinary pictures of Indians in various activities. I thought maybe we could get some of those."""
"""I'm afraid not--not on this trip, at least,"" spoke Blake. ""I don't believe there is ten feet of unexposed film left, and that wouldn't make much of a reel. We used up all we brought with us making those cowboy pictures, the forest fire and the time the bear chased Hank, besides the Indian views. Nothing more doing in the camera line until we get back to Flagstaff.""However, Blake was too much occupied in getting supper just then to pay much attention to his chum, for the lad was hungry--as, indeed, his companions also seemed to be, for they attacked the simple provender with eagerness when Hank announced that it was ready.The evening was setting in when they had finished, and, bringing up a pail of fresh water, in case they should get thirsty during the hours of darkness, and placing the saddles and packs in a compact mass, the three proceeded to spend the night in the open.And yet not exactly without shelter, either, for they had with them small dog-tents, as they are called, that afford considerable protection against the night winds and dew. And, with a fire glowing at their feet, the travelers were far from being uncomfortable.A pile of wood had been collected near the blaze, and while nothing was said about standing watch, it was understood that if any of them roused in the night he was to pile fuel on the embers, not only to keep up the genial heat, but to drive off any prowling beasts that might try to raid their stock of provisions.And yet, in his heart, each lad was aware of something that he hesitated to put into words. Presently Hank came back, and as the firelight shone on his face his expression betrayed no anxiety--in fact, no emotion of any kind.""Oh, pshaw!"" exclaimed the lad. ""I'm foolish to worry about nothing; I'm going to sleep!"" and he turned over, and closed his eyes. But, somehow, sleep would not come at once. Even with his eyes closed he could fancy the figure of the cowboy guide sitting by the fire.""It really doesn't seem possible--that I'm going to have folks at last,"" murmured Joe. ""And maybe not only a father, but brothers and sisters--Uncle Bill Duncan said he didn't know. I may have more than Blake, if I keep on,"" and then, with more pleasurable thoughts than worrying about an indefinable something, the lad finally lost himself in slumber.The camp was still. Even Hank had crawled into his little tent, after a final pipe. He did not get to sleep soon, and had either of the boys been awake they would have seen him come out several times before midnight, and stalk about, peering off into the darkness.Then, after looking to the tether ropes of the animals, he would go back to the small shelters, throw some embers on the fire, and drop off into a doze. For the cowboy was a light sleeper, and the least sound awakened him.""I guess there'll be nothing doing,"" he whispered to himself after one of these little observations. ""I thought I saw some signs just about dusk, but maybe it was some slinking coyote, or a big jack rabbit. Anyhow, if--if anything does happen it won't come during darkness; that is, unless it's some of them half-breed or Mexican rustlers, and I don't believe they've been around these diggings lately. I'm going to snooze.""Soon his heavy breathing told that he slept, and several hours passed before he again awoke. If he had made one other observation, probably he would have seen that which would have aroused his suspicions, for, about an hour after midnight, there was an uneasy movement among the animals."
"And in the starlight, which in a measure made the night less black, several shadowy, slinking forms might have been observed creeping toward the camp and the pile of provisions and supplies, among the latter of which were the boxes containing the valuable films of the moving pictures.Joe and Blake questioned thus by turn as they leaped to Hank's side. They were in darkness now, for the cowboy had ceased shooting, and those who had come to attack had likewise allowed their weapons to become silent. As a matter of fact, Hank Selby had only fired in the air, if possible to frighten off the Indians, and it seemed that the redmen had done the same, since there was no whine of bullets over the head of the guide.""Indians,"" replied Hank, in a low voice. ""It's probably some band of Moquis or Navajos, who escaped being rounded up as the others were. Probably they were chased so hard, or were so surprised at one of their camps, that they had to leave without their ponies. And they do hate to walk. They saw our animals and tried to get 'em, but I was suspicious all along.""""The beggars dropped down, and are hiding,"" said the cowboy. ""They didn't like the quick way I fired on 'em, I guess; though, land knows! I don't want to hurt any of 'em if I can help it. They don't know just what to do, and they're biding their time.""""So I believe they are,"" replied Hank. ""But I fancy my shooting drove 'em back a bit, even though I did fire in the air, or so high over their heads that they couldn't be harmed. So I guess we can make a move out there without getting hurt. Anyhow, it's got to be done, and, as I know more about such business than you boys, having been at it longer, I'll just attend to that. You'd better make the best sort of breastworks you can. For, though I don't believe these beggars will actually shoot to hurt, still it's best to be on the safe side. Be cautious, now.""And, while Hank is thus preparing to secure the pack and saddle animals, and the boys to gather the boxes and bales into a compact mass, I will take just a few moments to tell you more about the moving picture lads than I have yet done.In the first book of this series, entitled ""The Moving Picture Boys; Or, The Perils of a Great City Depicted,"" I introduced to you Joe Duncan and Blake Stewart. At that time they lived in the village of Fayetteburg, in the central part of New York State. Blake worked on the farm of his uncle, Jonathan Haverstraw, while Joe was hired boy for Zachariah Bradley. And it happened that they both lost their places at the same time.Blake's uncle decided to retire to a Home for the Aged, and Mr. Bradley said he could no longer afford to pay Joe any wages. The boys did not know what to do until they made the acquaintance of Mr. Calvert Hadley, a moving picture photographer. The latter had come to Fayetteburg with a theatrical company to get some views in a country drama that was being enacted, some of the scenes being laid in the nearby city of Syracuse.Blake and Joe watched a mimic rescue scene in the creek, thinking it real, and later Mr. Hadley offered them work as his assistants in New York. He was employed by the Film Theatrical Company, to make its moving pictures."
"The boys jumped at the chance. Before the little country drama was over, however, an accident occurred, in full view of the moving picture camera. Mrs. Betty Randolph, a wealthy Southern lady, was run into, while riding in her carriage, by a reckless autoist. Mrs. Randolph offered a reward for the arrest of this man, who escaped in the confusion, and urged the two boys to try to effect his capture.Eventually, while making scenes at a thrilling balloon ascension, Joe and Blake discovered the reckless autoist and gave chase in a car. They caught him, too, and got the reward, with which they purchased some moving picture cameras, and went into business on their own account. They made films to order, and were often employed by Mr. Hadley or by Mr. Ringold, head of the Film Theatrical Company.Among them was Henry Robertson, who did ""juvenile leads""; Harris Levinberg, the ""villain""; Miss Nellie Shay, the leading lady, and Miss Birdie Lee, who did girls' parts. Last, but not least, was Christopher Cutler Piper--known variously as ""C. C."" or ""Gloomy."" He preferred to be called just C. C., not liking his two first names, but he was so often looking on the dark side of life, and predicting direful happenings that never came to pass, that he was often dubbed ""Gloomy."" However, he was the comedian of the troupe, and could utter the most unhappy expressions while doing the most comical acting.After having helped Mr. Hadley make a success of his moving picture newspaper, by means of which current happenings, and accidents, were nightly thrown on a screen in various theatres, Joe and Blake, as I said, went into business for themselves.Mr. Ringold decided to take his theatrical troupe to Arizona, there to make films for a number of Western dramas. He asked the boys if they would like to join Mr. Hadley in doing this work. At the same time a New York scientific society, engaged in preserving records, pictures and photographic reproductions of the Indians, made a prize offer for the best film showing the redmen in their ceremonial dances. The time was particularly ripe for this, as a band of the Moquis, as well as several tribes of Navajos, had broken from the government reservations to indulge in their strange rites.Just before they left, however, Joe received a strange letter. It was from a man signing himself Sam Houston Reed, who stated that he had met a man who was looking for a Joe Duncan. Joe, who had known there was some mystery about his early life, was overjoyed at the prospect of finding some ""folks,"" and wished very much to meet Mr. Reed. But the latter had neglected to date, or put any heading on his letter. All there was to go by was part of a postmark, which showed it came from Arizona, and Mr. Reed also mentioned Big B ranch.How they got to Flagstaff, made many views there, and then how Joe and Blake started to find the place where the runaway Indians were hidden away, doing their mysterious dances--all this is told in the second volume.Eventually they reached Big B ranch, only to find that Mr. Reed, like a rolling stone, had gone. However, some of the cowboys remembered him, and had heard him talk of having met a certain Bill Duncan, whose half-brother, Nate, was looking for a lost son. It was supposed that this Nate Duncan was Joe's father.They had many adventures before getting on the track of the Indians, and when they found them in a secret valley, and, concealed in a cave, began taking moving pictures, they discovered, as I have said, four white men in danger of torture.How they rescued them, how the troopers came, and how one turned out to be Bill Duncan, Joe's half-uncle, I have mentioned in this book as well as in the second volume. And, on their way back to Big B ranch and to Flagstaff, the night attack had taken place.As he spoke, the cowboy appeared, leading by their long tether ropes the riding ponies and the pack animals. The steeds showed signs of their recent excitement. Had it not been for the alarm they gave they might have been stolen without our friends being any the wiser."
"This was hardly finished, and they had scarcely collected a pile of brush to make a bright fire, if necessary, when there arose all around fierce shouts. At the same time there was a fusillade of shots; but, as far as could be seen, all the Indians were firing in the air.But nothing could be done against such numbers. The camp was overwhelmed in a daring raid, and though the boys and Hank did all they could, firing wildly in the air, they could not stand off the attack. Strangely enough, no effort was made to mistreat the boys or their companion. The Indians simply rushed over them and made for the pile of goods in the rear of the tents. They did not even seem to be after the horses. Blazing up brightly, after Joe had thrown some light sticks on the embers, the fire revealed a much disordered camp. The Indians had rushed over it as a squad of football players might tear through a rival eleven, leaving devastation in their wake. The only consolation was that Hank had managed to prevent the animals from stampeding, and the possession of their ponies, in a country where foot travel is almost out of the question, was a big factor.""But why they didn't try harder to make off with the horses is what I can't understand,"" spoke Blake, as he continued to make an examination of the damage done. ""I thought that was what they were after.""""They were,"" declared Hank; ""but I guess they realized that taking horses is a pretty serious crime out here. They knew that all sorts of efforts would be made to recapture 'em, and by men who would not be as gentle with 'em as Uncle Sam's soldiers. So I guess they decided to pass up the horses and only take some grub. That isn't so serious, especially as the poor beggars are probably well-nigh starving, having been away from their regular rations so long. Well, it might be worse, I suppose. They will hardly come back to-night, and I guess we can get a little rest when I picket these animals out again. We got off pretty lucky, I take it, for there was sure a big bunch of them.""""But what could the Indians want with them?"" asked Joe. ""They don't know how to develop 'em, and, even if they did, they would be of no use. They can't know what they are, but if the least ray of light gets into the boxes it means that the films are ruined!""""They probably didn't know they were taking your films, boys,"" spoke Hank, who had finished making fast the horses. ""They very likely thought the boxes held some new kind of food, and they just grabbed up anything they could get their hands on. I reckon the beggars are nearly starving, and that's what made 'em so bold. You'll notice they didn't once fire at us--only up in the air. They just wanted to scare us.""""Chase after 'em and get our stuff back!"" exclaimed Blake, quickly. ""I'm not going to stand that loss. They can have the grub if they want it, but I'm going to get back those films that we went to such trouble, and so much danger, to snap."""
"""But they'll be too far away then,"" objected Blake. ""And, while it might do little harm if they opened those film boxes in the darkness, it sure would spoil every picture we took to have them exposed in daylight. Let's go now!"" and he started toward the animals.""No,"" and Hank shook his head. ""I don't think you need worry about not catching those fellers in daylight,"" he went on. ""They won't go far before stopping to eat the stuff they took from us. Then they'll have a sleep and start on the trail by daylight. We can do the same, and I think we can catch up with them. It would be risky to start out at night in a country we know so little about. We'll have to wait.""Blake sighed, but there was no help for it. The upset camp was put in some kind of shape, the horses were again looked to, and the fire once more replenished. The travelers carried an unusually large supply of provisions, and though most of these had been taken, there was still enough food left for a day or two. In that time they might be able to get more, if they could not recapture their own from the Indians.""We'll start the first thing in the morning, as soon as it is light enough to see,"" decided Hank. ""And now, if it's all the same to you boys, I'm going to have a bite to eat. That excitement made me hungry.""""No, the beggars keep well ahead of us,"" agreed Blake, shading his eyes with his hand and gazing off across the hot, sunlit stretch that lay before them. ""Oh, if they have opened those film boxes!"" he exclaimed hopelessly.""They have ponies, and that's more than I calculated on,"" remarked Hank. ""I thought when they raided our camp that they were after our animals, and when they didn't take 'em I thought it was because they were afraid of being chased as horse-thieves by a sheriff's posse. Now I see they didn't want our mounts, as they had plenty of their own. It was grub they were after, and they got it.""Hank did pick up the trail of the raiders soon after starting out. The Indians had left their horses tethered some distance from the camp, and had crept up afoot, probably having spied Blake, Joe and Hank from afar the previous evening. And though the moccasined feet of the savages left little trace on the hard and sun-baked earth, there was enough ""sign"" for so experienced a trailer as was Hank to pick up.""There are about twenty-five in this band, as near as I can make out,"" said Hank, ""and every one of 'em has a horse of some sort. Pretty good travelers, too, I take it, since our animals were fresh and we haven't been able to come up to 'em yet, though we've kept up a pretty fair gait. But we'll get 'em yet."""
"""Another little rest will do the horses good,"" said the cowboy guide. ""Then we can push on so much the faster. Our horses are our best friends, and we've got to treat 'em right if we want the best service out of them. Another half-hour and we'll push on.""""They will as long as their horses hold out, for they must know that this ghost-dance business is about over and that most of their friends are back on the reservations. But when we come up to them----"" and the cowboy paused and significantly examined his revolver.""Well, I hardly think it will be what you might call regular and up-to-date fighting,"" replied Hank. ""They may fire their guns and revolvers at us to try and frighten us back, but I don't actually believe that they'll make trouble. They know the punishment would be too serious. And I believe a lot of those Indians have only blank cartridges that they had when they were in some Wild West show. I know there was mighty little whining of bullets, for all the shooting they did last night. But, at the same time,"" he went on, ""it's best to be prepared for emergencies.""Here they could see where a rest was made, and again where some animal went out of the beaten path. Bits of the Indians' finery, too, were noted every once in a while--a bit of gaudy bead trimming, a discarded moccasin or some dyed feathers.""I do hope we come up with them before dark,"" said Joe. ""If we have to stay out on the trail all night, and part of next day, we may find nothing left of our things and the pack burros when we reach camp again.""In order to make better time our friends had left behind, at the place where the Indians had raided them, the pack animals, their cameras, a few films not taken by the Indians, and as much of their provisions as they thought would not be needed on the trail.The horses were urged to greater speed, and they responded gamely. They seemed to realize the necessity for haste, and took advantage of the momentary betterment in the surface over which they were traveling.The sun was sinking lower and lower in the west and the shadows were lengthening. Eagerly the boys and the cowboy scout peered ahead, straining their eyes for a glimpse of those whom they were pursuing. Then there came a bit of rough ground, and the pace was slower. Next followed a little rise, and, as this was topped, Blake, who had taken the lead for a short distance, uttered a cry and pointed forward with eager hand.Riding to his side, the others saw a sharp descent, then a level plain stretching away for many miles. And moving slowly over this plain was a band of about twenty-five Indians, mounted on ponies that seemed scarcely able to move.His trained eye had shown him that the Indians were using quirts and their heels to spur the tired animals to a last burst of speed. True, the ponies did leap ahead for a few minutes; but not even the wild shouting of the redmen, the frantic beating of their steeds, and the firing of their guns could make the wearied muscles of the ponies respond for long.The spurt lasted only a few seconds, and then came a noticeable slowing down. On the contrary, the horses of our friends, though they had traveled far and hard, were in better condition and much fresher.Whether his talk was understood, or not, was not known; but others of the Indians began tossing away either boxes of film or other things--aside from food--which they had taken from the camp. They never stopped their horses, though, but ever urged on the tired beasts."
"And it did seem so. The Indians never paused, but continued to toss away article after article. They seemed afraid of the consequences should they be caught with anything belonging to the whites in their possession. They may have taken Hank and the boys for the advance-guard of a sheriff's posse, and, knowing they had been doing wrong, were afraid. At any rate they made no stand.The horses of the pursuers were pulled down to a walk. The Indians noticed this at once, and, seeming to realize that the chase was over, they halted, and, turning, gazed in a body at the moving picture boys and their cowboy guide.""Had enough, I reckon,"" murmured Hank. ""I guess you can't go on much farther. Well, we'll turn back a ways and put some miles between us, so you won't try any of your tricks again, and then we'll go into camp ourselves. Got everything, Blake?""They turned back, and as they did so the Indians gave a last shout of defiance and began to make camp for themselves. It was as if a lot of schoolboys, playing truant, had been rounded up, and as a last indication of defiance had given their class yell.Collecting the things the Indians had thrown away, our friends rode on until dark, and then, out of sight of the roving redmen, they made a simple camp. They stood guard by turns, but there was no night alarm. The next day they reached the place where they had picketed the pack animals. Nothing had been disturbed.They traveled on for another day, finding good water and plenty of grazing for the steeds. Their provisions ran a bit low, for the Indians had helped themselves liberally, but they managed to shoot some small game.""Pleased to meet you,"" said Sam Reed. ""I never cal'lated when I writ that there letter that I'd ever see you in flesh and blood. I've got your pictures, though,"" and he showed those that had appeared in a magazine, giving an account of the work of Joe and Blake.As might have been expected, Sam knew nothing of Joe's father. The best the cowboy had hoped to do was to put the boy on the track of Mr. William Duncan, and, considering that Joe's uncle, as I shall call him--though he was really only a half-uncle--had enlisted in the army, Mr. Reed would probably have had hard work to carry out his plans.But the boys at the ranch would not hear of their starting for a few days, and so Joe and Blake stayed on, being royally entertained. They witnessed a round-up and the branding of cattle, but could get no pictures, as their films were all used up. However, the subjects had often been filmed before, so there was no great regret.Then came a time when they had to say farewell, and they turned their horses' heads toward Flagstaff. The cowboys gave them a parting salute of cheers and blank cartridges, riding madly around meanwhile.The ride to Flagstaff from Big B ranch was without incident. It was through a fairly well settled part of the country, as settlements go in Arizona, and they made it in good time. Joe often talked about the strange fate that had put him on the track of his father."
"""Oh, stop it, Gloomy!"" called Miss Shay. ""What do you want to spoil their welcome for, just as we have a little spread arranged for them?"" for she had gotten one up on the spur of the moment, on sighting the boys.""A spread, eh? Humph, I know I'll get indigestion if I eat any of it. Oh, life isn't worth living, anyhow!"" and he sighed heavily and proceeded to practice making new comical faces at himself in a looking-glass.""Well, I'm glad you boys are back,"" said Mr. Ringold a little later at the impromptu feast, at which C. C. ate as much as anyone and with seemingly as good an appetite. ""Yes,"" went on the theatrical manager, ""I shall need you and Mr. Hadley right along, now. I am going to produce a new kind of drama.""""Somewhere on the Southern California coast. In a lighthouse--just where I can't say. But I am going there, and so you will have to get some one else, Mr. Ringold, to take my place. Blake can stay here, of course, and make moving pictures, but I----""""Well, say, this just fits in all right. There's no need for any of us to be separated, for I intend taking my whole company to the coast to get a new series of sea dramas. The Southern California coast will suit me as well as any. The announcement of Mr. Ringold was followed by a silence, during which Joe and Blake looked at each other. It seemed like too much good fortune to learn that they would still have the company of their friends in this new quest.""And if, at the same time, I can locate my father,"" went on Joe, ""so much the better, though I don't imagine I will have any trouble finding him, once I can communicate with the government lighthouse board, and learn where he is stationed. They have a list of all employees, I imagine.""""Yes, I think so,"" spoke Mr. Hadley. ""As you say, it will be easy to locate him. And, boys, I'm very glad you're going to be with us again. I wouldn't like to break in two new lads, and we will certainly need three photographers to take all the scenes in the sea dramas that are planned.""""Will we have to go very far to sea?"" asked Macaroni, who was among those who had greeted the moving picture boys. The lads' thin assistant had been kept busy assisting Mr. Hadley while they were after the Indians. ""Because if it's very far out on the ocean wave I don't believe I want to go; I'm very easily made seasick."""
"""He may be drowned, even near shore,"" put in C. C., with his most gloomy voice; though he was, at the same time, practicing some new facial contortions that were sending the women members of the troupe into spasms of laughter.""Oh, there you go, Gloomy!"" exclaimed Mr. Hadley. ""First we know you'll be saying we'll all be smashed in a train wreck going to the coast; or, if not, that we'll be carried off by a tidal wave as soon as we get there.""""Then it's all settled,"" went on Mr. Ringold. ""It is understood, Joe, that you can have considerable time, if you need it, to locate your father. The dramas I intend to film will extend over a considerable time, and they can be made whenever it is most convenient. After all, I think it is a good thing that we are going to the Southern California coast. The climate there will be just what we want, and the sunlight will be almost constant.""""I'm sure I'm much obliged to you,"" said Joe. ""This trip after the Indian films cost us more than we counted on, and we'll be glad of a chance to make more money. We're down pretty low; aren't we, Blake?""""That's so,"" put in Mr. Hadley. ""You had better have those films developed, and send them to the geographical society. I wouldn't ship them undeveloped, for they might be light-struck. You were lucky the Indians didn't spoil them.""The boys decided to do this, and during the next few days the reels of moving pictures were developed, and some positives printed from them. While the lads had been after the Indians Mr. Ringold had sent for a complete, though small, moving picture outfit, and with this some of the pictures were thrown on a screen.""They're the finest I've ever seen!"" declared Mr. Hadley, after inspecting them critically. ""That charge of the soldiers can't be beaten, and as for the Indian dances, they are as plain as if we were right on the ground. You'll get the prize, I'm sure; especially since you're the only ones who got any views, as I understand it.""The films were excellent, it was stated, and just what were needed. One other concern, aside from Mr. Munson's, and the one the latter mentioned, which had gone to Indian land, had succeeded in getting a few views of the Indians in another part of the State, but they were nowhere near as good as those Blake and Joe had secured after such trouble and risk. The attempt to get phonographic records had been a failure, the officers of the society wrote, though another attempt would be made if ever the Indians again broke from their reservations.""Me, either,"" decided Joe. ""I've had enough. Now the sooner we can get to the coast the better I'll like it. Just think, my father must be as anxious to see me as I am to find him; but as near as I can understand it, he doesn't even know that I am alive. Think of that!"""
"""And after this, nearly all our work will have to do with the sea,"" said the theatrical man. ""I want to depict it in all its phases; showing it calm, and during a storm, the delights of it, as well as the perils of the deep.""Before leaving Flagstaff it was decided to give a few exhibitions of some of the moving pictures, so that the residents there, and a number of the cowboys and Indians who had taken part in the plays, might see how they looked on the screen. A suitable building was obtained, and it was crowded at every performance.The Indians were at first frightened, thinking it was some new and powerful kind of ""medicine"" that might have a bad effect on them. With one accord, when the film the boys had taken, showing the charge of the soldiers on the Moquis, was put on, the redmen rushed from the building. And it was some time before they could be induced to return.""Say, there's my uncle, as plain as anything!"" exclaimed Joe, when the excitement had calmed down, and the reel was run over again. ""There's Sergeant Duncan, close to Captain Marsh!"" and he indicated where the trooper was riding beside the commander of the cavalry.There were busy days ahead of them all now, and there was much work to be done in transporting all the ""properties"" to the coast, and arranging to move the picture outfit, the cameras and the entire company. The boys had little leisure, but Joe managed to get a letter off to the government lighthouse board, asking for news of his father, Nathaniel Duncan.The day came to bid farewell to Flagstaff, which had been the stopping place of the theatrical troupe for several months. They had made many friends, and the Indians had become so used to taking their parts in the dramas, and in getting good pay for it, that they were very sorry to see the ""palefaces"" leave. So, too, were the cowboys, many of whom had become very friendly with our heroes and the theatrical people.""Indeed, if we didn't leave soon,"" said Joe, ""I'd be tempted to start off by myself. I've sent a letter to my dad, telling him all about how strangely I found him, and I'm just aching to see him. I guess he'll be pretty well surprised to get it.""But no one was, in spite of the direful predictions, and soon the cowboys drew off, with final shots from their revolvers, discharging them in the air. The Indians, too, had their share in the farewell, though they were not so demonstrative as were their companions.""And my dad,"" added Joe, and there was a trace of tears in his eyes, which he did not attempt to conceal. Blake knew just how his chum felt, and he found himself wishing that he, too, was going to find some relative. But he knew the only one he had was his aged uncle.Little of incident occurred on the trip to San Diego, which had been decided on as headquarters until a suitable location, away from any town, could be selected directly on the ocean beach. I say little of moment, but C. C. was continually predicting that something would happen, from a real hold-up to a train wreck.""And there's the old Pacific!"" exclaimed Joe, as he and Blake went down to the shore of the bay on which San Diego stands. ""It isn't very rough, however, and Mr. Ringold said he wanted tumbling waves as a background.""""It gets rough at times, though,"" remarked a fisherman. ""Of course, if you want to see big waves you'll have to go beyond this bay. It's pretty well land-locked. Oh, yes, the old Pacific isn't always as peaceful as her name."""
"""The Rockypoint light?"" repeated the fisherman, in response to Joe's inquiry. ""Why yes, I know it well. It's only a few miles from here. You can see her flash on a clear night, but you can't make out the house itself, even on a clear day, because she's down behind that spur of coast. From the ocean, though, she's seen easily enough.""""Well, you sure have spun a queer yarn,"" said the old fisherman, ""and I wish you all sorts of luck. You'll soon be at the light if you go right down the beach. I'd row you down in my dory, only I've just come in from taking up my nets and I'm sort of tired.""""Some day I'll take you out fishing,"" promised the man. ""And so you're here to get moving pictures; eh? Well, I don't know much about 'em, but you couldn't come to a nicer place than this spot on the coast. And you only have to go a little way to get right where the real surf comes smashing up on the beach. Of course, as I said, we're so land-locked just here that we don't see much of it, even in a storm. Moving pictures; eh? I'd like to see some.""""Me in moving pictures!"" cried the old man. ""Ho! Ho! I wonder what my wife'd say to that. I've been in lots of queer situations. I've been knocked overboard by a whale, I've been wrecked, and half drowned, and almost starved, but I've never been in a picture, except I once had a tintype taken--that was when I was married,"" and he chuckled at the remembrance. ""These movin' pictures aren't like tintypes; are they?""""Not much,"" laughed Joe, as he and Blake moved off in the direction of the lighthouse, calling a good-bye to their new friend. They had told Mr. Hadley, in starting out that morning, that they might not be back until late, for Joe had a half notion that he would try to find the lighthouse that day.The walk was longer than they had thought, and when noon came they still had some distance to go. As they were hungry they sought out a fisherman's cottage, where, for a small sum, they had a fine meal. Starting out again, they turned an intervening point of land about three o'clock, and then came in view of a lighthouse, located on a pile of rocks, not far from the high-water mark.""Look here, Joe!"" exclaimed his chum. ""I guess you're too excited over this. You let me make some inquiries for you. Suppose he has gone? We may be able to trace him. Men in the lighthouse service get transferred from one place to another just as soldiers do, I imagine. Now you sit down here and look at the sad sea waves, as C. C. would say if he were here, and I'll go tackle that lighthouse keeper. You were too flustered to get any clues, I expect."""
"""Ha! Another boy!"" exclaimed Mr. Stanton, as Blake approached. ""I didn't know this was going to be visiting day, or I might have put on my other suit,"" and he laughed genially. ""Are you another son of Mr. Duncan?"" he asked.""No,"" replied Blake. ""I'm Joe's chum. We're in the moving picture business together. But he says his father has left, and, as he naturally feels badly, I thought I'd make some inquiries for him, so we can locate him. Do you know where Mr. Duncan went?""""That I will, lad, and maybe you can figure a way out of the puzzle. I'm an old man, and not as smart as I was, so my brain doesn't work quickly. Maybe you can find a way out. Come inside where we can talk so he won't hear us,"" and he nodded toward the quiet figure of Joe on the beach.""You see I'm pretty old, and I have to have an assistant at this light. I expect soon I'll have to give up altogether. But I'm going to hang on as long as I can. I've had three assistants in the last year, and one of 'em, as you know now, was Nathaniel Duncan, Joe's father. Before him I had a likely young fellow named--ah, well, I've forgotten, and the name doesn't matter much anyhow. But when he left the board sent me this Duncan, and I must say I liked him right well.""""A nice sort of man. He was about middle aged, tall, well built, and strong as a horse. He looked as if he had had trouble, though, and gradually he told me his story. His wife had died when his boy and girl were young----""""As I said, Nate Duncan seemed to have had lots of sorrow, and he told me how, after his wife died, he had placed the boy and girl in charge of some people, and gone off to the California mines to make some money. When he come back, rich, the children had disappeared, and so had the people he left 'em with. He never could locate 'em, though he tried hard, and so did his half-brother, Bill. But Bill was different from Nate, so I understand. Bill was a reckless sort of chap, while Joe's father was quite steady."""
"""Trouble with wreckers, lad. The meanest and most wicked kind of trouble there can be on a seacoast. A band of bad men got together and by means of false lights lured small vessels out of their course so they went on the rocks. Then they got what they could when the cargo was washed ashore.""""No, lad. I don't accuse anybody; I'm too old a man to do anything like that. But ugly stories began to be circulated. Government inspectors began to call more often than they used to, inspecting my light--my light, that I've tended nigh onto twenty-five years now. I began to hear rumors that my assistant wasn't altogether straight. He was said to be seen consorting with the wreckers, though it was hard to get proof that the men were wreckers, for they pretended to be fishermen.""Then come a day when, with my own eyes, I saw Nate Duncan walking along the beach with one of the men who was said to be at the head of the wrecking gang. I could see that they were quarreling, and then Nate knocked the man down. He didn't get up right away, for, as I said, Nate was strong. I knew something would come of that, and I wasn't much surprised when that day Nate disappeared.""""Went off completely, and left me alone at the light. I tended it all night, same as I had done before, many a time, and the next day I reported matters, and I had a new assistant--the same one I have now.""""Not a trace, lad--folks most generally doesn't when the detectives are after 'em. Hold on, though, I won't say Nate was guilty on my own hook. I'm only telling you what happened. I'd hate to believe he was a wrecker, misusing this light to draw vessels on the dangerous rocks; but it looks black, it looks black.""""Well, they as much as did. They said some of the wreckers had been arrested, and had incriminated the assistant light-keeper. But Duncan was smart enough--provided he was guilty--to skip out. As I told Joe, his father left just before the letter from Flagstaff came, so he doesn't know his son is alive. Poor man, I'm sorry for him. He told me how he had searched all over for his children, and at last, becoming tired and discouraged, he took this job just to have something to do, for he's well enough off not to have to work.""""Well, maybe not; but for himself. There are heavy penalties for wrecking, and it's well he wasn't caught, though, as I say, I don't accuse him. Only it looks black, it looks black. If he was innocent why didn't he stay and fight it out? Yes, lad, it looks black."""
"""You mustn't!"" exclaimed the old man. ""That's just it. You must not tell him. I'd hate to destroy his faith in his father. It would be cruel. That's why I asked if you could keep a secret. You won't tell him; will you?""""Wait a minute until I think, lad,"" said the old man. ""It may be that we can find a clue, after all. Nate Duncan left some papers behind. I haven't looked at 'em, not wishing to make trouble, but there may be a clue there. I'll get 'em.""""Well, we hope to find him,"" said Blake, with an assurance he did not feel. ""Look here, Joe, your father went away rather suddenly, it seems, but you mustn't think anything about that. He's been traveling all over, you know, looking for you and your sister----""""It's this way,"" went on Blake, and he told as much of the lighthouse keeper's story as was wise, keeping from Joe all information about the wreckers. ""Now, your father may have heard of some new clue about you,"" continued Joe's chum, ""and he may have gone to hunt that up,"" which was true enough, for with the warning that he was likely to be arrested as a criminal, there may have come to Mr. Duncan some information about his missing children.Together he and Blake looked over the documents. As the keeper had said, there was not much. Some memoranda, evidently made as different clues came to him; paid bills, some business letters, a few notes, and that was all.""What's this?"" exclaimed Blake, as he read one letter. ""It seems to be from some shipping agent in San Francisco, saying he can place--why, Joe, it's to your father, and it says he can have a place as mate any time he wants it. Was he a sailor?"" he asked, eagerly, turning to the keeper.""Then this is the very thing we're looking for!"" cried Blake. ""Look, it is dated only a short time before he left. I see now,"" and he gave the lighthouse keeper a peculiar look, when Joe was not glancing in his direction. ""Mr. Duncan got word that he could ship as a mate, and he left in a hurry."""
"There was nothing more to be learned at the lighthouse. The boys left, after thanking the keeper, and promising to come and see him again. As they went out Mr. Stanton gave Blake a little sign, warning him not to disclose the secret.""That's right. Well, I wish you luck,"" and Blake wondered if Joe would be glad he had found his father, after all. ""Wrecking is a black business,"" mused the lad. ""But, like Mr. Stanton, I'm not going to think Joe's father guilty until I have to. I wonder, though, if the story is known about San Diego? If it is I'll have trouble keeping it from Joe.""But Joe's chum found he had little to fear on this score, for, on getting back to the quarters of the theatrical troupe, the boys were told that the next day they would all take up their residence in a small seacoast settlement, out on the main ocean beach, away from the land-locked bay and where bigger waves could be pictured.""To-morrow,"" said Mr. Ringold, while Blake and Joe told Mr. Hadley of their poor success in finding Mr. Duncan. The photographer, as did the other members of the company, sympathized with the lad. Mr. Ringold said that as soon as they got settled the boys could go to San Francisco to look up the shipping agent.""And now for some rehearsals,"" said Mr. Ringold, one morning. ""One of the scenes calls for a shipwrecked man coming ashore in a small boat. Now, C. C., I guess you'll have to be the man this time, as I need the others for shore parts. Get the cameras ready.""The preparations were made, it being customary to rehearse the scenes and acts before ""filming"" them to secure good results. A boat was launched, after some trouble on account of the surf, and with the aid of some fishermen, ""C. C. was finally sent to sea,"" which was a joke, as Blake remarked.C. C. Piper obeyed orders--too literally, in fact. He leaned so far over that, a moment later, when there came a particularly large wave, the craft slewed sideways, got into the trough, and an instant later capsized. For a moment there was excitement, and then the trained men of the sea got into action. Nearby there were several fishing boats, operated by gasoline motors. There were planks at hand, and rollers on which the craft could be launched in the surf, being eased along the slope by releasing a cable rigged to a post some distance away.It did not take long for the fishermen to launch one of these motor boats, and while C. C. Piper was struggling in the surf, endeavoring as best he could to climb into his overturned boat, they put out to rescue him.""Say,"" began C. C., earnestly, as, dripping wet as he was, he strode up to the theatrical man, ""I can't swim, and I don't like the water. I told you that the time you took me up in the country, where we found these boys,"" and he motioned to Blake and Joe, who were looking interestedly on, ready to work the cameras as soon as required.""And yet,"" went on Mr. Piper, ""you insisted that I jump overboard then and rescue Miss Shay. Now you want me to drift in as a shipwrecked sailor. It's too much, I tell you. There is entirely too much water and tank drama in this business. I know I'll get my death of cold, if I don't drown."""
"""Not for mine!"" exclaimed C. C., firmly, and it took some persuasion on the part of the theatrical manager, accompanied by a promise of an increase of salary every time he had to go into the water, to induce C. C. to try the shipwreck scene over again.This time a larger boat was used, and, though it came near to capsizing, it did not quite go over, though considerable water was shipped. C. C. managed to stay aboard, and the cameras, rapidly clicking, registered each movement of the actor and those who later took part in the drama.The next two days were busy ones, as a number of elaborate acts had to be filmed, and the boys were kept on the jump from morning to night. Mr. Hadley, also, had all he could do with the camera. There were fishing views to get, scenes on the beach, where a number of children were induced to play at games in the sand, building castles and tunnels, boating incidents and the like.""Maybe we'd better speak to Mr. Ringold,"" suggested Blake, and they did, with the result that the theatrical man informed them that the end of the week would be free, as he had to wait for some costumes to arrive before he could produce any more dramas.""Oh you're only _supposed_ to be starving and thirsty,"" explained Mr. Ringold. ""If you want, you can take some sandwiches and cold coffee with you, and have lunch--but don't do it when the cameras are working. It wouldn't look well in the moving pictures to have a note on the screen saying that the shipwrecked persons were starving, and then show you chewing away; would it, now?""""Well, if he left the lighthouse in a hurry, intending to call on a shipping agent, naturally he wouldn't stay in port long,"" said Blake. ""Besides----"" He stopped suddenly, being on the verge of saying something that would give Joe a hint of the truth.The boys reported to their superiors, and learned that a smuggling scene, to fit in one of the sea dramas, was to be attempted. By means of powerful flash and electric lights, the current coming over cables from San Diego, it was planned to make views at night.As this was an unexpected turn to affairs, they had to postpone their trip to San Francisco for a few days. The night pictures came out well, however, and the first of the following week saw Joe and Blake start on their way to the city of the Golden Gate.""Good!"" exclaimed Mr. Ringold. ""Try that, if you don't mind. Get some scenes down in the financial district, and others in the residential section. Then, as long as you have to go to the shipping offices, get some there.""This camera worked by compressed air. There was a small motor inside, operated by a cylinder of air that could be filled by an ordinary bicycle pump. Otherwise it was just like the other moving picture cameras.There was the upper box, in which was wound the unexposed reel of film. From this it went over a roller, and the cog wheel, which engaged in the perforations, thence down by means of the ""gate,"" behind the lens and shutter. There two claws reached up and grasped the film as the motor operated, pulling down three-quarters of an inch each time, to be exposed as the shutter was automatically opened in front of the lens.After the film has been exposed, three-quarters of an inch at a time, it goes below into another light-tight box of the camera, whence it is removed to be developed and printed. The movement of the film, the operation of the claws and the opening and closing of the shutter, making it possible to take sixteen pictures a second, was, in this camera, all controlled by the air motor."
"Joe and Blake found much to amuse them in San Francisco, which they had never before visited. They were a bit ""green,"" but after their experiences in New York they had no trouble in finding their way around.They found so much to interest them in the streets of San Francisco that they did not go back to the hotel as soon as they had intended. When they did reach the street on which it stood they saw a crowd gathered.""Go off!"" cried the clerk, while Joe and Blake were vainly endeavoring to get in a word that would explain matters. ""If it's dynamite, and goes off here, it will blow up the hotel. Get it away! Porter, go up and get that infernal machine, and dump it in a pail of water.""""'Scuse me!"" exclaimed the colored porter, as he made a break for the door. ""I--I guess as how it's time fo' me to sweep off de sidewalk. It hain't been swept dish yeah day, as yit. I'se gwine outside.""""But we've got to get rid of that infernal machine!"" insisted the clerk. ""It's been clicking away now for some time, and there's no telling when it may go off. Get it, somebody--throw it out of the window.""""There's no danger--not the slightest,"" cried Blake, while the crowd in the hotel lobby pressed around him. ""That's only an automatic moving picture camera, that we set this morning, and pointed out of the window to take street scenes. It works by compressed air, and the clicking you hear is the motor. Come, I'll show you,"" and he started toward his room, followed by Joe.This was logic that could not be refuted, and they followed the boys to the room. There, just where they had left it, was the camera, the motor clicking away industriously. It worked intermittently, running for five minutes, and then ceasing for half an hour, so as not to use up the reel of film too quickly. Also, it made a diversity of street scenes, an automatic arrangement swinging the lens slightly after each series of views, so as to get the new ones at a different angle.""Now we'll show you,"" said Blake, as, having noted that all the film was run out, and was in the light-tight exposed box, he opened the camera and showed the harmless mechanism. Several of the hotel employees crowded into the room, once they learned there was no danger.""Yes,"" said the clerk. ""A chambermaid called my attention to the clicking sound when she was making up the room. I investigated, and when I heard it, and saw the queer box, and remembered that we had had dynamiting here, I sent for the police."""
"""Not at all,"" went on his chum. ""But what I mean by a hoodoo is that something always seems to happen when we start out anywhere. We've been on the jump, you might say, ever since we lost our places on the farms and got into this moving picture business.""""Yes. But if things are going to keep on happening to us I wish they'd take a turn and help me find my father,"" went on Joe. ""You don't know how it feels, Blake, to know you've got a parent somewhere and not be able to locate him. It's--why, it's almost as bad as if--as if he were dead,"" and Joe spoke the words with an obvious effort.""That's right,"" agreed Blake, and then there came to him the memory of what the lighthouse keeper had said about Mr. Duncan being implicated in the wrecking. If this was true, it might be better for Joe not to find his father.""Well, I'm glad of it. If there is, and you need help, don't forget to come to me. Remember we're pards, and chums, not only in the moving picture business, but in everything else, Blake. Anything I've got is yours for the asking.""""That's good of you, Joe, and if you can help me I'll let you know. I didn't realize that I was acting any way strange. I must brighten up a bit. I guess we've both been working too hard. We need some amusement. Let's go to a moving picture show to-night, and see how they run things here, and what sort of films they have. We may even see one of our own.""""All right. I'll go you. We can't see that shipping agent until to-morrow. A moving picture show for ours to-night, then. Though, being in the business, as we are, it's rather like a fireman going around to the engine-house on his day off, and staying there--a queer sort of a day's vacation.""But, nevertheless, they thoroughly enjoyed the moving picture play, interspersed, as it was, with vaudeville acts. Among the films were several that Mr. Ringold's company had posed for, and several that the boys themselves had taken. The reels were good ones, too, the pictures standing out clear and bright as evidence of good work on the part of the boys and Mr. Hadley.""Yes, I think I do,"" and Blake linked his arm in that of Joe, wondering the while, as they tramped on, how he should ever break the news to his chum, in case Joe himself did not find it out. ""The only hope is that he isn't guilty,"" mused Blake, ""and yet running away just before the accusation was made public looks bad, just as Mr. Stanton said. However, I'm not going to think about it."" As long as it had gone thus far without any outsider giving away the secret to Joe, his chum began to feel that there was little danger."
"""Well, you haven't any more infernal machines; have you, boys?"" the hotel clerk asked them when they came in to get their keys. ""Because, if you have, just keep quiet about 'em. I don't want to be awakened in the middle of the night with some one from the bureau of combustibles coming down here,"" and he laughed.""Oh, yes, now I know. But why are you asking?"" and the agent turned a rather suspicious look on Joe. ""Is there anything wrong--is Mr. Duncan wanted for anything? I always try to protect my clients, you know, and I must find out why you are asking. Has he committed any crime, or is he wanted by anyone?"" ""Sorry I can't do any more for you,"" went on the agent, after a pause, during which he gazed sympathetically at Joe. ""I can give you the name of the vessel your father is on, and you can write to Hong Kong, but it will be some time before she arrives. She's a sailing ship, you know, one of the few left in the trade.""""His daughter, too,"" continued the agent. ""He said he felt sure he'd never locate her, though he'd spent lots of money in hunting. And he felt pretty bad, too, over the thought that he might never see his children again.""""I can't rightly say,"" spoke the shipping master. ""You had one, but whether she's alive now or not no one seems to know. There's one satisfaction, though, you can find your father in time, and as soon as he hears from you, when his ship reaches Hong Kong, he won't lose any time taking the fastest steamer back. I know Nate Duncan well enough for that.""""Will he, though?"" thought Blake. ""Will he come back when he knows of the wrecking charge that may be made against him? Even the prospect of seeing Joe may not overbalance that. Yet, I suppose he could send for Joe. They couldn't make any charge against him over in China. But it's a bad business.""""Well, there's no use staying in 'Frisco much longer,"" said Joe, as they finished their business. ""We'll get what other moving pictures of street scenes we want, and as I can't find Dad here, we'll leave. We'll get back to San Diego, and out to the beach colony to film some more dramas."""
"A return trip to their hotel, a visit to various localities for films, then to pack their belongings--and the automatic camera did not take them long--and they were soon journeying down the coast again. They were welcomed warmly by the members of the theatrical colony.As I have said, for the purpose of being unhampered in their work of taking films, Mr. Ringold had moved his company from San Diego proper to a small fishing settlement, directly on the beach. This place was called Chester, after the man who owned the fishery there. He had a fleet, consisting of several motor boats, in which the fishermen went out twice each day to pull up the nets that were fast to long poles, sunk into the sand of the ocean bed in water about forty feet deep.The fish were brought to the main building, and packed in ice for transportation. Numbers of local dealers called each day with wagons to get a load to peddle about. There were only a few houses in the place, and a store or two.Once some millionaire had built an elaborate cottage on the beach, but gave it up for some whim. It was in this cottage, which in size was almost a mansion, that the moving picture boys and their friends had their abode. A boarding mistress was installed, and thus the actors and actresses lived right at the scene of their work, with almost as much comfort as they would have had in a hotel. The place was not far from San Diego, and it had the advantage of a heavy surf on the beach, the big waves making just the background Mr. Ringold wanted. Of course, not all the scenes were on the water-front, some taking place in front of, or within, some of the cottages, which were hired for the short time needed. The fishermen could not seem to understand why a man should pay them good money for the use of their humble dwellings for a short time.""It just seems plumb foolishness,"" declared one grizzled salt. ""I don't see why folks want to make so many pictures of men and women walkin' in and out of my cottage and sayin' such outlandish things like: 'Gal, you shall give me them papers!' or, 'Meet me on yonder cliff at midnight!' I give up!""""I'm going to have a novelty in one of the plays,"" said the manager. ""It's going to be a fire scene. We'll buy one of these cottages, or else have one built that will do well enough for picture purposes, and set it ablaze. Then, when C. C. comes running out, carrying Miss Shay--or maybe Miss Lee, for she's lighter--we'll----""""Then I serve notice here and now that I resign. I'm tired of being an actor. I'm going into the coal business,"" and he stopped making odd faces in the glass, practicing some facial contortions for a new clown act, and began to dress as though to go out.""No. Listen. You go in before the building is afire. The blaze is started from the outside by your enemy, and with some red fire, which makes a lot of smoke, we can show on the screen some pictures that will look like a real fire. Then out you rush, before the flames have had a chance to spread, and after you and the lady are safe, the fire gains great headway, and the cottage burns to the ground. But the pictures are being taken all the while, and it will show up great! There's not a bit of danger."""
"Mr. Ringold succeeded in purchasing, for a moderate sum, one of the older cottages, and it was put in shape for its share in the moving picture story, some changes being necessary. The fisherman and his family moved out, glad of the chance to better themselves.""We won't say anything about planning to fire the shack,"" declared Mr. Ringold to the boys and the members of his company. ""If we do it will attract a crowd, and that's just what we don't want. The fewer the better. Now we'll go over to the shack, and have a rehearsal.""All went well until it came time to set the fire. Then, whether the building was older and more tinder-like than was supposed, or whether Mr. Levinberg, the ""villain"" who fired the shack, used too much red fire and kerosene, was not explained.""That's what I'll do!"" cried the comedian, appearing in the doorway, carrying Miss Lee. There was little danger now, as long as he was in the open, unless some tongue of fire should catch the girl's dress.And then something entirely unexpected, and not down on the bill, happened. A number of fishermen, who had seen the blaze from down the beach, came running up, all excited, thinking the fire was an accident.""Want it to burn?"" was shouted at him, by the fisherman who had proposed the pump. ""Be you plumb crazy? Come on, boys, form that bucket brigade. Some of you run that hand-pump over here where we can pour water in the tank. Stretch the hose!""Joe and Blake, not having orders to the contrary, and not knowing but what this was all part of the play, continued to grind away at their cameras, two reels of this play being taken, as an additional one was needed.""Here she comes!"" cried the fisherman, as some of his companions came rushing from a shed with an ancient style of hand fire-engine, consisting of a tank, on wheels, with a force-pump arrangement, worked by long handles. Water was poured in the tank by means of buckets, and forced out on the blaze through a hose.""Bring her up as clost as ye kin!"" directed the self-appointed chief of the amateur fire department; ""'cause our hose ain't very long. Form lines now, and dip water up from the ocean. Salt water is good for fires!""""I don't know!"" cried Mr. Ringold. ""The whole play is spoiled by those fellows butting in. Hi, there!"" he called to Blake and Joe, as he saw them operating the cameras. ""Stop the reel! We don't want any of this!"""
"Meanwhile, the hand engine was placed in position. It was learned, later, that the fish concern kept it for use in cases of emergency. There had been some small blazes, in which the old engine had proved its worth.The fishermen knew how to operate it to advantage, too, and soon a double line of them, extending from the surf to the tank, began passing the filled buckets up one side and the empty ones down the other. As the tank filled, other men worked the handles and a stream of water was soon spurting on the fire.He rushed forward, but at that moment the hose got from the control of the two men holding it. The nozzle swung around, and the stream came full force over Christopher Cutler Piper, drenching him in an instant.""I say there--hold on--shut that water off! I--I'm being drowned!"" he spluttered. And then, as the men again got the nozzle under control, the comedian, dripping water at every point, walked away, saying:""There!"" cried Abe Haskill, the old fisherman-chief. ""We saved your building for ye, Mr. Ringold. Ain't no use in buyin' a shack an' then havin' it burn down--no matter if it ain't wuth much. We saved her for you, though at one time it looked pretty dubious. This is the first fire we've had in some time, an' I reckon we got a bit rusty.""I might add,"" he went on, ""that it's customary, in cases where a volunteer department saves a buildin' from destruction--it's customary, I say, for the owner to donate a leetle suthin' to the department. In this case, seein' as how Jim Belton sold his shack to you--why, you're the owner. And, as I say, we saved her for you!"" he concluded, proudly.""Well, you meant all right, anyhow,"" went on Mr. Ringold, with cheerful philosophy; ""and I'll make the department a donation. But next time, please don't interfere. I'll set another shack on fire as soon as I can arrange to buy one,"" he said to his company. ""Meanwhile we'll go on with another drama. Save whatever you can of the films,"" he added to Blake and Joe. ""Up to the time the firemen broke in they'll be all right. Next time I'll be more explicit.""""Meanwhile,"" said Mr. Ringold to Joe and Blake, ""you may have a little time off. I tell you what you might do. We could use a fishing scene, I believe. Suppose you go out in one of the small boats here and get a series of views when they lift their nets."""
"The craft, as I have explained, were ""eased down"" the sloping beach, by means of rollers and planks, until the stern was just at the edge of the surf. The motor was then started, the boat being still held fast by a rope. This rope was fastened in a peculiar knot, so that one man, standing near it, could loosen it with one pull when the word was given to ""cut loose.""The men watched the rollers with practiced eyes, for if the surf was heavy the boat might get into the trough, on being launched, and capsize. Often fishermen are drowned in this way, being struck by the heavy boat, or getting under it.With the engine racing, the men got into the boat. One remained on the beach, holding the restraining rope. Another took his place at the stern, with a long steering oar that was to be used to get her bow on to the waves.The man at the rope yanked the knot loose. The boat slid into the water and the next instant was being tossed about in the breakers, the man with the oar forcing her head around, aided by the powerful gasoline engine that turned the propeller. The craft came near to capsizing, but kept upright, and a little later was beyond the surf, into deep water, speeding out to the nets two miles away.Blake and Joe, working by turns, got some fine views of the launching. Then, getting into another of the fishing boats with their cameras, and with Macaroni to aid them, they prepared to go out to the fishing grounds, where the nets were.And they found that they did not, though there was some motion, as there was quite a swell on. They reached the nets safely, and while the meshes were hauled up, bringing a good catch of fish, the moving picture boys took many views. It was interesting as well as instructive.A man had indeed slipped into the sea. The moving picture boys were ready, however, and trained one of the cameras on the fisherman, who, laughing at his mishap, soon swam to the boat again, and was pulled in.""A pesky swordfish. He's ramming us, and he may poke a hole in us! If I can get a chance I'll jab him!"" and the man leaned over the side. As he did so there came another attack on the craft, so fierce that it heeled over, and the man with the pole, giving a cry, was flung overboard.One of the fishermen picked up the iron-shod pole the unfortunate man had dropped as he went overboard, and stood ready to cast it at the big fish, which could be seen swirling along in the water, near the swimmer.""It's loaded with slugs,"" he called to the boys, who were even now taking moving pictures of the strange scene. ""I carry it for sharks, but it'll do as well against a swordfish, though they don't commonly attack men.""The boat was soon under way again, and offers of aid from sister craft that circled around were declined. A bundle of rags served to stop the inrush of most of the water, and a little later the craft, with its load of fish, was hauled up on the beach by means of a tackle and fall, horses being the motive power. Joe and Blake got pictures of the other boats making a similar landing, theirs being the first in.For the next week the boys had little time to themselves. The drama with the burning shack was enacted over again, this time with success, the volunteer firemen not throwing any water on the blaze. Other sea dramas were also made, and then came a period of rest, in which Blake and Joe had hardly anything to do."
"They strolled along the shore, making excursions here and there as something attracted them. Going through a little group of scrub oak, somewhat back from the shore, and climbing a slight elevation to get a view of the Pacific, the boys were startled, as they were about to emerge into a little open glade, to hear voices.Cautiously they advanced until they stood behind a little screen of trees, and were gazing into the open place. They saw several men at work erecting some sort of tower, or pile of rocks, and on top of it was mounted a large lantern.""Maybe,"" assented the man who had started to make the search. ""But I thought some one was spying on us, and if they were----"" He did not finish, but glared angrily around. He was so close to the boys that they could hear his rapid breathing, but the leafy screen effectively hid them from view. ""If I catch any one,"" he went on, ""he'll wish he never ran across Hemp Danforth!"" and he shook a big fist.""Oh, come on!"" called some of his companions. ""There's lots to be done yet before we get this lantern finished. And if we want any rich pickings we'll have to hustle for 'em. The weather looks like it was going to break, and that will be just what we want. Come on, Hemp.""""Don't talk that way,"" spoke a tall, thin man. ""It isn't altogether cheerful--especially with what work we have on hand. Come on, now; let's make this pillar a little higher, and the light will show better.""""But they know my father, Blake,"" went on Joe, using more caution, however, in his tones. ""I must speak to them. Maybe they were associated with him in lighthouse work, and this may be some new patent lantern they're trying. Maybe my father hasn't gone to China at all, and these men can tell where he is.""""Then I'm going!"" declared Joe, half fiercely. ""Blake, I'm sure you're keeping something from me. I've suspected it for some time, for you've looked at me in a queer fashion when I spoke of my father. Now what is it?""""Boys, you can't fool me! There is some one here, and they're spying on us. I'll make 'em sorry for it! I hear whispering, and I've felt right along as though unseen eyes were looking at me. Now I'm going to find out who it is!"""
"""Come on, Joe. We've got to run for it!"" exclaimed Blake, and, not caring now how much noise they made--being under the necessity of betraying their presence--they dashed back in the direction they had come. Blake Stewart was at a loss. He did not know what to do, and, though he had been expecting to hear this request at almost any time, he was no more prepared for it now than he would have been had it been made directly after Blake learned of Mr. Duncan's flight.""Oh, I'm sure you have,"" declared Joe, ""and you might as well tell me now as any time, for I'm bound to find it out. I don't believe there's any more danger now,"" and he paused to look back along the almost hidden path they had followed. ""I can't see anything of that man,"" he added. ""We gave him the slip, all right.""Now go ahead, Blake, and end my suspense. I've seen for some time that you've been keeping something back from me. I don't know what it is, but it's something about my father. And I appreciate why you're doing it. You want to spare my feelings.""""That's it!"" cried Blake, eagerly, glad of any chance to put off what he regarded as a most unpleasant duty. ""It is for your sake, Joe, that I have been keeping silent, and I wish you would go on letting me do so. Believe me, if I thought it well for you to know I'd tell you.""""Is it--is it that he isn't my father, after all?"" faltered the lad, following a silence in which all sound of pursuit had died away. The boys felt that they were safe now. ""Do you mean to say, Blake, that this man whom I've traced after such hard work, isn't any relation to me--haven't I any folks, after all?""""No, I've got to hear it right away. If it's any disgrace--and it must be, or you'd be willing to tell me--if it's any disgrace, it's my duty to stand up for my father when he isn't here. I'm his son, and I have a right to know about it, and protect his name as much as I can. Tell me, Blake.""The other hesitated a moment. If he told, it would be, he felt, breaking his promise made to the lighthouse keeper, but then the promise was not so sacred that it could not be broken. It was given under a sort of discretion, and Blake knew that he would be allowed to reveal what had been said if he felt that it was best to do so. The time now seemed to have come to do this. He took a sudden resolve."
"""All right, Joe,"" he said, ""I'll tell you. There is a secret about your father. I suppose you know what sort of men those were that we just got away from?"" and he nodded in the direction of the hill down which they had raced.""I presume you pretty well know what is coming,"" said Blake, slowly, ""now you have heard what those men said. The whole amount of it is, Joe, that your father is suspected of having been in league with those wreckers--that he helped to lure vessels on these same rocks.""""The lighthouse keeper said,"" began Blake, ""that your father left because he feared to be arrested. And the day after he went away an officer did come for him,"" and he proceeded to relate what Mr. Stanton had said.""But it's mighty strange what those men said about him,"" went on Joe. ""To think that we would stumble on the wreckers right at work. We can lead the police to the very place where they have set up their false light.""""Well, they as much as said that your father had refused to give them the information they wanted, and this spoiled their scheme. That might go to show that they made offers to him to have him help them in their wicked plans, and he refused. That made them turn against him, and----""""That's it, Joe. Of course, it's all guess work on our part, so far, and I think the best thing we can do is to go to the lighthouse and tell Mr. Stanton all we've seen and heard. He may be able to advise us, even if he is an old man. At any rate, he'll know what police or government officers to go to, so we can catch these wreckers.""""So that's how the scoundrels are planning to work; are they?"" cried the old man. ""Going to duplicate my light, and fool the poor sailors! But we'll put a spoke in their wheel, boys. We'll spike their guns for 'em, and have 'em behind the bars, if there's any law in this land.""Putting up a false light right opposite those rocks--the most dangerous on the coast! No punishment would be too bad for 'em. Did you happen to hear, boys, when they expected to play that wicked game?""""They didn't mention any special night,"" replied Blake; ""it seemed that they counted on getting some information which failed them--Joe's father,"" he added, thinking it well to let Mr. Stanton know that Joe had been informed of the secret.""That's the way to talk!"" cried the old man. ""Boys, I'll help you. We'll get right after these miscreants. Maybe I was wrong, after all, in thinking Nate Duncan guilty. He was a good man, and it made me feel bad even to suspect him."""
"""That's right,"" declared Mr. Stanton. ""We must act at once. My assistant is here now, and I'll have him go with you. I'm a little too old for such work. Besides, one of us will have to stay here to guard the light. No telling but what the scoundrels might try to wreck it. But if they come, I'll be ready for 'em!"" he cried, as he took down an old-fashioned musket from the wall. ""I'll stand by to repel boarders!"" he exclaimed, holding the weapon above his head, and then sighting it at an imaginary enemy.""I'll call my assistant,"" he went on. ""Tom Cardiff is as sturdy a lad as you'd wish to see. He can get one of the men from the life saving station, and with a couple of the government secret service officers you ought to be able to get those wreckers, don't you think?""""Now you boys had better go back to your place,"" said Mr. Stanton; ""and arrange to come back to-night. That's the only time to get after these fellows. They probably have finished their work, from what you told me, and they'll lay low until it's dark. Then we'll get after 'em!""""That's so,"" spoke the theatrical man. ""I guess it's out of the question. But you have done such wonderful work so far, that I'd like you to keep it up. A film of the capture of wreckers would make an audience sit up and take notice.""""It's going to be a dark night,"" remarked Blake, a little later, as he and Joe were on their way to the lighthouse. It was early evening, but the sky was clouding over and a wind was coming up that sent the big billows bounding up on the sand with a booming noise like the discharge of distant cannon.""That's hard to tell, Blake. And yet they might; for, though they saw us, they may think we were only a couple of lads out for a stroll, who accidentally stumbled on their hiding place. In that case they wouldn't think we'd give any alarm, and they'd go on with their plans.""""Yes, it's quite a tramp,"" said Tom Cardiff, ""and the wreckers may be there now. Several small trading vessels are expected up the coast this week, and some may be due to-night. Though seeing that a storm is coming up, they may keep so far out from shore that they won't see the false lights, in case the wreckers try to work them.""This is about as wicked a piece of work as could well be done, trying to wreck vessels this way. A sailor has to depend absolutely on the lights, under certain conditions, and if they're wrong, it's like leading a blind man into danger. So let's get after 'em and stop their work!"""
"""When you see that you are close to the place,"" said Tom Cardiff, ""you boys go ahead, and we'll trail along after you. And keep mighty quiet, too. If we can catch these fellows actually in the act of showing a false light, so much better for the chances of convicting them.""""He's right on the job,"" remarked Tom Cardiff. ""Even if he's an old man he'll stay up all night to attend to that light, to see that it's trimmed properly, that the machinery is working, that there's oil in the reservoir, and that the lenses are clean. That light is just like a son or daughter to him. He can't bear to have anything happen to it and the very idea of any scoundrels trying to wreck vessels by means of a false beacon riles him up considerable.""""I should think it would,"" agreed Mr. Wilton. ""Well, if we can catch these fellows we'll put 'em where they can't do any more harm. And I hope we'll get back in time, so Mr. Stanton won't have to stay up all night.""But the night was black all around them. Not a gleam could they make out. Once more they advanced until Joe and Blake recognized the place where they had been hiding, and whence they had looked into the open place where the wreckers had been putting up their false light.Blake leaned forward, cautiously parted the bushes and looked toward the open space. He had heard nothing, and seen nothing, and yet he knew that the men might be hidden about, and that the lantern might not yet be lighted.""Look at how this stone pile, which they intended to use as a base for their lantern, is disturbed, and pulled apart,"" went on the assistant lighthouse keeper, as he flashed his torch on it. ""I'll wager, boys, that when you saw it, with that contrivance atop by which they hoped to fool some vessels, this stone pile was well built up; wasn't it?""""Because,"" went on Tom Cardiff, ""it would have to be so to make their light steady, to give the impression that it was one of the regular government lights. They were going to work a shutter, you boys say, to give the impression of a revolving light, and that would make it necessary to have a firm foundation.""I mean that they've gone somewhere else!"" exclaimed the assistant keeper. ""They've made tracks away from here, but they've gone to some other place to set up their light, and try the same thing they were going to try here. It's our duty to keep after 'em, and break up the gang!""""That's right!"" cried Mr. Wilton. ""There's no telling what damage they might do, if left alone. Why, they might even get to some place where large passenger steamers pass, and wreck one of them, though mostly they aim to pick out a spot where small cargo boats would be lured on the rocks. We've got to keep after 'em!""""Then come on!"" cried Joe. He was fired with enthusiasm, not only to capture the wreckers for the purpose of protecting human life and property, but he was also eager to have the scoundrels safe in confinement so that he might question them, and learn the source of the suspicion against his father."
"""No, not to-night,"" advised Mr. Boundley. ""It wouldn't be practical, in the first place; and if it was, it wouldn't be safe. We don't know this locality very well. There may be hidden dangers and pitfalls that would injure some of us. Then, too, we don't want to stumble on a nest of wreckers without knowing something of the lay of the ground.""""Do nothing to-night,"" advised the government man. ""To-morrow we can take up the trail, and by daylight we may be able to pick up something that will give us a clue. I think they won't try any of their tricks to-night, so it will be safe for us to go back.""The others agreed with this view, and, after looking about the place a little more, and trying, but unsuccessfully, to find clues in the darkness, partly illuminated by the electric torches, they gave it up and started back to the lighthouse.""What's the matter with getting on the trail after these fellows the first thing in the morning. No use waiting any longer, and we can't tell how prompt those government men may be. Of course they're interested, in a general way, in making the capture; but aside from that, you and I have a personal motive; for I'll admit I'm as interested as you are in proving that your father is innocent.""So what's the matter with getting back up on the cliff as soon as we can, and seeing if we can trace those fellows. You know we've had some experience after taking films of those Indians, and can follow signs pretty well.""""Go ahead, boys,"" he said. ""Mr. Hadley and your lad, Macaroni, can take what films we want to-day. And I would like to see you get those wreckers. There's no meaner criminal alive. All we'll do for the next couple of days is to get ready for our big drama--I've planned a new one--and I sure will want you boys to help film it for me.""""It sure will, and I don't just know how to manage it. I could buy some old tub, and wreck it, I suppose, but I want it to look natural. While I don't wish anyone bad luck, I do wish, if a wreck had to happen, that it would come about here, so we could get moving pictures of it. But I don't suppose I'll have any such good luck.The boys were soon at the scene of the disappointment the night before. Daylight revealed more clearly the haste with which the wreckers had removed their false lantern. Stones were scattered about, as were bits of broken wood, wire, rope and other accessories.They looked about, using the knowledge they had gained from being with the cowboy the time they filmed the pictures of the Moqui Indians. For some time their efforts were without success. They cast about in all directions, looking for some lead that would tell them in which direction the wreckers had gone.""I should think they'd go farther down the coast,"" suggested Joe. ""They certainly wouldn't come toward the lighthouse, and they wouldn't go inland, for to work their plan they need to be near the shore."""
"Joe Duncan leaped to his chum's side. Eagerly he looked at the bit of cloth which, caught on a thorn bush, had ripped from some man's garment. The cloth was not weather-beaten, which, to the boys, showed that it had not long been hanging there.""Blake, I believe you're right,"" assented his chum. ""They went this way, and they must have done it for a blind, or else to get to some path that goes farther down the beach a different way,"" for the cloth was caught on a bush toward the landward side of the little clearing.They pushed into the bushes. There was no semblance of a path, but this did not discourage the boys. They realized that the wreckers would want to cover up their trail, and would take a way that would not seem to lead anywhere.""There's no telling. It's best to be on the safe side. Keep quiet. Hello! here's something else!"" and Blake, moving cautiously, so as not to make any more noise than possible, picked up a bit of metal.""Part of their lantern,"" answered his chum. ""It was made of black sheet iron, you remember. This piece may have fallen off when they dragged it through the bushes. We're on the right trail, all right.""It was a narrow path, leading along in both directions from where they came out on it, and following the coast line, but some distance inland. There were evidences that men had passed in both directions, and that at no distant time, for footprints turned to both the left and right, as the boys emerged from the blind trail in the brush.""Don't you?"" asked Blake. ""Look here, and remember some of the things our cowboy guide told us when we were after the Indians. Now you see footprints going off to the left and right from this point; don't you?""""Because they wanted to fool us. Naturally a person, not looking carefully, would see both lines of footprints, and would reason that the men might have divided, or that there might have been two separate parties. He wouldn't know which trail to take. He might pick out the right one, and, again, he might select the wrong one.""""Why, naturally they wouldn't go to the left, as that eventually leads to the lighthouse. They want to keep some distance from that. Of course they'd go to the right. And here's where we go after 'em. Come on!"""
"""Yes, and they're putting up the same lantern on a rock pile,"" remarked Joe. Both lads recognized the apparatus they had seen before. The men were busily engaged in setting it in place, evidently working fast to make up for lost time.""It's the same gang,"" observed Blake; ""and they must know of some vessel that is to pass here soon, or they wouldn't be in such a hurry. Probably they count on the steersman mistaking this light for the one at Rockypoint, and standing in close here. Up at Rockypoint there is deep water close in shore, but it shoals very fast both ways, up or down the beach. So if a vessel saw a false light, and stood close in to get her bearings, she'd be on the rocks in no time.""""Well, we can't capture 'em by ourselves; that's sure,"" went on Blake, each lad speaking in a cautious whisper. ""The best thing for us to do is to go back, I think, and tell Tom Cardiff. He'll know what to do.""For a few minutes longer the eager boys looked on, unseen by the men whom they had trailed. The wreckers were busy putting up their lantern, and were making as much noise, talking and hammering on the apparatus, as though they were far removed from possible discovery.""Well, we'd better be going,"" suggested Blake, after a bit; and they made their departure without causing any suspicious sounds, so that the wreckers had no idea, as far as our heroes could ascertain, that they were being spied upon.In order to save time, as soon as they got to the nearest small settlement, Joe and Blake hired a carriage, and drove to the lighthouse. As may well be imagined their report caused considerable excitement.""We'll get right after 'em!"" cried Tom Cardiff. ""I just got a telephone message from the secret service men that they are on their way here. They'll arrive in about an hour. We were counting on getting on the trail ourselves to-day, but you boys got ahead of us. So in about an hour we'll start. I guess they'll be there then; won't they, lads.""""Don't be late!"" advised Tom Cardiff, as they ran toward the ancient carriage they had hired. ""We don't want any slip-up this time. I'm glad we're going to try for the capture by daylight, though, instead of darkness; it gives us a better chance.""""This is a rare chance to get a film,"" said Mr. Hadley, ""and we don't want to miss it. I'll go along with you, taking a regular moving picture camera, and while you capture the wreckers I'll make a film of it.""This suited the boys as well, and a little later, with the chief photographer, they started back for the lighthouse. They found the secret service men and Tom Cardiff waiting for them, and, well armed, in addition to the clubs they carried, and with ropes to bind the wreckers, they started off."
"""That's a great idea,"" declared one of the government men. ""Taking their photographs in moving pictures! There'll be no chance for them to deny they were present when they were captured,"" and he chuckled grimly. Fortune played into the hands of our friends in two ways as they sought to capture the wreckers. Otherwise the desperate men might have gotten away, so quickly did they dash out of the clearing at the first alarm.But, as he ran along, big Hemp Danforth, the leader of the criminals, stumbled and fell. Right behind him was sturdy Tom Cardiff, and the assistant lighthouse keeper was quick to take advantage of the chance thus put in his way.There was a struggle, none the less desperate because the wrecker was underneath. The two rolled on the ground until Tom got a grip on his opponent. Then, by putting forth his enormous strength, Tom quickly subdued the man.Meanwhile the others had been busy. The secret service men had each tackled a man, and had him secure by now, while Joe and Blake, by mutual agreement picking out another member of the party had, after a struggle, succeeded in tying him, too.But the wreckers outnumbered our friends two to one, and some, if not all, of the desperate characters might have escaped had not reinforcements appeared. These were in the shape of four sturdy fishermen from the little colony where the moving picture boys lived.""Oh, if we could only capture the others!"" cried Tom Cardiff, when he had finished with his man, and saw some of the wreckers struggling to make their way through the thick bush. ""Come on, boys!"" he yelled to his friends. ""When you finish with those fellows keep after the rest of the gang, though I'm afraid they'll give us the slip.""""No, they won't!"" cried a new voice, and then appeared the husky toilers of the sea, armed with stout clubs. At the sight of them the wreckers not yet captured gave up in despair. Counting those tied up, the forces were now equal, and as Mr. Hadley had taken all the moving pictures possible, owing to the struggle taking place out of range of his camera, he left the apparatus, and joined his friends.""Well, we got 'em!"" cried Tom Cardiff, as he surveyed the line of prisoners, fastened together with ropes. ""Every one of 'em, I guess. You're a nice crowd!"" he sneered at big Hemp Danforth. ""A nice lot of men to be let loose!""""Old Stanton telephoned over from the lighthouse,"" was the answer. ""He said you were on your way here, and that the gang might be too much for you. So I got a couple of my friends, and over we came--just in time, too, I take it."""
"""That's right!"" exclaimed Blake, trying to staunch the flow of blood from a cut on his face, received in the fight he and Joe had with their prisoner. Joe himself was somewhat bruised. ""A little later and we'd had only half of 'em,"" went on Blake.""Fishermen! Why, you men never did an honest day's fishing in your lives!"" cried Abe Haskill. ""Fishing! When you haven't been smuggling you've been wrecking, or robbing other honest men's nets. You're a bunch of scoundrels, and it's the best day's work we've done in many a year to get you!""""Yes, overheard by these two lads, whom you chased but couldn't catch. I guess when Blake Stewart and Joe Duncan go into court, and testify about hearing you talk of wrecking vessels by your false lantern, the jury'll convict you, all right!""""This, and it's a good one, too. You think to convict us on the testimony of Nate Duncan's son. Why, Nate is one of us! His son's evidence wouldn't be any good. Besides, a son wouldn't help to convict his father. That's a good one. Nate Duncan is one of us!""""Well, if you're through talking I guess we'll move along,"" suggested Tom at this point. ""There are a few empty cells in the jail at San Diego, I understand, and they'll just about accommodate you chaps.""""You'll keep still--that's what you'll do!"" snapped Hemp. ""I'll fix you if you don't!"" and he glared at the youth in such a way that the latter said no more. ""I'll manage this thing,"" went on Hemp. ""You keep still and they can't do a thing to us. Now go ahead; take us to jail if you want to.""""That's what we will,"" declared Tom, and a little later the prisoners were on their way to San Diego, where they were locked up. Some suspected wreckers had been taken into custody when Mr. Duncan was accused, but nothing had been proved against them."
"""Well, that was a good day's work!"" declared Mr. Hadley late that afternoon, when he and the moving picture boys were back at their quarters. ""We not only got the wreckers, but a fine film of the capture besides.""""Well then, you just stop thinking about it. Before you know it your father may arrive in Hong Kong, get your letter, and send back an answer. Then everything will be cleared up. Meanwhile, we've got to get busy; there are a lot of films to make, I understand.""""Indeed there are,"" declared Mr. Ringold. ""I have my sea drama all ready for the films now. I don't know what to do about a wreck, though. I'm afraid I can't make it realistic enough. I must make other plans about that scene. But get your cameras in good shape, boys, for there is plenty of work ahead.""No members of the gang had escaped, as far as could be learned, and the renewed work of getting evidence to be used at the trial was in the hands of the government men. The false lantern, which had first given the boys the clue, was taken down, and proved to be a most ingenious piece of apparatus. Had it been used it would undoubtedly have lured some ships on the rocks.The work of making the preliminary scenes of the sea drama were under way. It took the best part of three weeks to get what was needed, for Mr. Ringold was very particular, and insisted on many rehearsals, these taking longer than the actual making of the films.""And when it does come,"" added Joe, ""it's going to be a bad one, so old Abe, the fisherman, says. They're putting storm signals up all along the coast, and all leaves of absence for the life guards have been cancelled for the next week. A storm sometimes lasts that long, Abe says.""""A storm; eh?"" remarked Mr. Ringold, absentmindedly. ""Well, that will interfere with our plans for to-morrow. I had intended to have some peaceful scenes on the beach; but I'll postpone them. I wish I could work out this wreck problem,"" he added, as he pored over the manuscript of the sea drama.One did not need to go outdoors that morning to appreciate the fury of the storm. The gale had come in the night, and the force of the wind had steadily increased until its violence was terrific. There was no rain, as yet, but the sky was obscured by hurrying black clouds.""A wreck--a big sailing vessel is coming ashore! Her masts are gone, and she can't get off! She'll strike soon. I want all the men I can get to help us with the breeches buoy. We can't launch our boat--too heavy surf!"""
"""Maybe she's drifted far enough up by now,"" went on the coast guard, as he looked intently in the direction he had pointed. ""Yes,"" he cried a moment later, ""I can catch glimpses of her at times, when the waves go down a bit. See! There she is now!""Looking in the direction the guard pointed, Blake and Joe caught a glimpse of a distant black object rising and falling at the mercy of the wind and waves. It was the hull of a vessel, and when Blake used the glass the guard handed him a moment later, he could see the jagged stumps of broken masts.""Good!"" shouted the man. ""It'll take some time to get the apparatus in shape, and we'll have to drag it up the beach from the station, to about the place where she'll come on the rocks. Go ahead, give the alarm, and I'll go back. Whew! But this is a fierce storm!""""That's it!"" yelled Blake. ""You've struck it. Go on and tell Mr. Ringold, Mr. Hadley and the others, and I'll get the fishermen. Then we'll go down the beach until we meet the life savers. It's a great chance, Joe!""Blake found Mr. Hadley and his chum, with the theatrical manager and the male members of the company, ready to set out. Joe had his own camera, while Mr. Hadley was getting the largest one in readiness.""And just when anyone else would,"" added Blake. ""For it sure is going to be hard work to save anyone from a vessel that comes ashore in such a storm as this,"" and he looked toward the tumbling billows in view from the windows.""There she is!"" cried old Abe, as he pointed out to sea. ""There she is, blowing and drifting in fast. And right toward the Dolphin Rocks, too--the worst place on the beach!"" They all gazed toward the doomed vessel, that was now much nearer shore. Blake even thought he could descry figures on deck, clinging to the stumps of masts.""Right about here,"" directed the captain of the life saving crew, when the cart containing the gun, ""shears"" and other parts of the breeches buoy had been dragged farther along. ""She'll strike about here, I fancy."""
"The doomed vessel was now much nearer shore, and on her wave-washed decks could be seen the sailors, some of them lashed to the stumps of masts, others to whatever of the standing rigging offered a hold against the grasp of the sea.""Because then she'll be stationary, and we can keep our main line taut. If she keeps drifting inshore while we're hauling the buoy back and forth it means that we'll have to keep tightening up all the while.""""There, she's struck!"" suddenly called one of the life savers. All gazed out to sea, where, amid a smother of foam, the craft could be seen. Her change in position was evident. Her decks sloped more, and instead of drifting she remained in one position.""That's right, Blake,"" and the two lads got their apparatus in shape to operate, Mr. Hadley doing the same. The machines were set up on some sand hills, far enough back to be out of the spray, which was like a fog close to the surface of the water.While some of the life savers and their volunteer assistants were burying in the sand the heavy anchor that was to hold one end of the rope on which the breeches buoy would travel, others were getting ready to fire the gun.In brief, the breeches buoy is operated as follows: A small mortar, or cannon, is used, and an elongated projectile is placed in it. Attached to the projectile is a thin and strong line. It is coiled in a box and placed on the sand near the mortar. The coils are laid around pegs in a peculiar manner to prevent tangling. The pegs are then pulled out, and the coils lie one upon the other so that the line may be paid out rapidly.When the projectile is fired toward the ship, the aim is to make it shoot over her deck, carrying the cord with it. This is called ""getting a line aboard."" Once this is done the crew on the vessel can, by means of the small cord, pull aboard a heavy cable. This is made fast to the highest point possible.There is now a cable extending from the shore to the ship, the shore end being made fast to the anchor in the sand. The cable is raised as high as possible on a pair of wooden ""shears,"" to keep it above the waves.Running on pulley wheels, on this stout, tight rope, is the ""breeches buoy."" This is literally a pair of canvas breeches, into which the person to be saved places himself, getting into the apparatus from the deck of the sinking ship. There is a line fast to the buoy, one end being on shore. When the signal is given those on the beach pull, the buoy and the person in it are pulled along the tight rope by means of the pulleys to the beach and saved, though often they are well drenched in the process. Those remaining on the ship now pull the empty buoy back, and other persons come ashore until all are saved.The projectile was hauled back through the waves, and attached to another line, coiled in readiness, while some of the life savers busied themselves recoiling the first rope, in case the second shot failed too.On board the wrecked ship could be observed a scene of activity. The sailors began hauling on the line, and presently the big cable began paying out from shore. Soon it reached the side of the ship, to be hauled up, and made fast to the stump of one of the masts."
"The men made redoubled efforts, and Blake and Joe, leaving their automatic camera working, while Mr. Hadley turned the operation of his over to Macaroni, the three moving picture experts aided in the work of rescue.""It's two of 'em--two of 'em, clinging to the buoy!"" cried Blake, who was watching through a glass. ""I guess the ship must be going to pieces too fast to allow for another trip. You've got to save two at once.""Hardy and intrepid as were the life-savers and the volunteers who had assembled to help them, they paused a moment now. It seemed impossible that the two in the buoy could be pulled ashore in time to be saved.Over them broke great seas, the waves hissing and foaming as though angry at being cheated of their prey. The storm-swept waters seemed to seize on the rope, as though to pull it beneath the billows. The anchor that held the rope which passed over the ""shears"" seemed to be pulling out of the sand packed around it.""She can't go until we git 'em ashore!"" yelled the captain of the life-savers. ""I won't let her! Here, Jim Black, you mosey back there and pile more sand around that anchor. Now then, men, pull as though you meant it. What! You're not going to have it said that you let a little cat's paw of wind like this beat you; are you?""Something of the captain's courage seemed to infuse itself into his men. They had been half-hearted before, but they were brave now. Once more they ranged themselves on the rope that was used to haul the buoy from the ship to shore. It was as though the waves had tried to intimidate them, and had been bidden defiance.The weight of the two persons in the buoy was almost too much. The waves had a doubly large surface against which to break, and well the captain knew that there was a limit to the strain to which the tackle could be subjected. Once the main rope leading from the anchor to the ship, on which cable the buoy ran, parted, and nothing could save those last two lives. No wonder the captain wanted haste.""Don't you talk about it!"" snapped the captain. ""I'll take all the responsibility of that rope. It'll hold all right. I looked at it the other day. All you've got to do is pull! Do you hear me? Pull as you never pulled before!"""
"Once more the backs of the men bent to the strain. The moving picture boys, watching and waiting; filled with anxiety even as they filmed the wreck, saw that the rise and fall of the waves had a good deal to do with the rescue.""Yes, there's less resistance,"" agreed Joe. ""Oh, there comes a big one!"" and, as he spoke, an immense comber buried from sight the two whom the life-savers were endeavoring to pull from the grip of the sea.""Then I'll have some one help you!"" cried the captain. ""Here, Si Watson! You git back there and help Jim pile sand on that anchor. It mustn't be allowed to pull out--do you understand? It mustn't pull out if--if you have to--sit on it!""""Now, friends,"" said Mr. Ringold, bustling up; ""those of you who are wet through had better let us take care of you. We have room for you all, and I'll send word to any of your friends if you'll give me the addresses. Your wreck, in a way, has been a great thing for me, for I have obtained some wonderful moving pictures of it and this rescue. It will make a great drama. So I want to help you all I can.""By this time the captain of the vessel had been revived and with his wife and crew was taken to the theatrical boarding place, where the women busied themselves getting warm drinks and food, and the men changed into dry garments loaned by the fishermen and the others. Soon after the last one came ashore the wreck broke up and sank.""Well, of all the wonderful things I ever experienced, this is the most marvelous,"" declared Mr. Duncan, as he sat with his son's hand in his. ""I am wrecked twice, and come back to the same place I ran away from, to find Joe waiting for me.""""Would you mind telling me why you left so suddenly?"" asked the lighthouse keeper, solemnly. ""Of course it's none of my affair; but I might say it concerns you mightily, Nate Duncan. Can you prove your innocence?""""But not the way you think, son,"" went on the former lighthouse worker quickly. ""Hemp Danforth and I had a quarrel. It was over some business matters that he and I were mixed up in before I learned that he and his gang were wreckers.""We quarreled, because he tried to defraud me of my rights, and I had to give him a severe beating. Perhaps I was wrong, but I acted on impulse. Then I heard that Hemp, to get even, had accused me of being a wrecker, and he had his men ready to swear to false testimony about me; even that I let the light go out, which I never did."
"""I knew I could not refute it, especially at that time, and as something came up that made it necessary for me to leave for China at once, I decided to go away. I realize now that it must have looked bad, especially after the charge against me. But now I am ready to stay and face it. I can prove that I had nothing to do with the wrecking, and that as soon as I learned that Hemp and his gang were concerned in it I left them. If we can get hold of Hemp I can easily make him acknowledge this.""""Most unexpectedly, after years of searching, I got word that she had been brought up in a minister's family, and that lately she had gone as a missionary's helper to China. I had long planned to take a sea voyage, and when I got this news I decided to go at once, and bring her back. Then I was to renew my search for you.""An agent in San Francisco told me of a vessel about to sail for Hong Kong, and I deserted my post at the lighthouse and sailed. I admit I did wrong in leaving so suddenly, but it seemed to be the best thing to do. I did not want to be arrested as a wrecker even though I was innocent.""And then began a long series of explanations, Mr. Duncan listening with interest to Joe's story, and, in turn, telling how his vessel was wrecked, and how he and the others were picked up, only to be wrecked again, nearer home.""Now I think you have talked enough, Mr. Duncan,"" said one of the women, coming up. ""You had a much harder time of it than we did, and you must quiet down. You must have swallowed a lot of salt water.""""No indeed, Dad. I've had enough trouble finding you to lose you now. But you get a good rest. Blake and I have a lot to do yet. I want to get these latest films in shape to send off for development. I hope they came out good.""The nonsensical talk served to raise the spirits of those who had been rather plunged in gloom ever since the wreck. Mr. Duncan was given a room to himself where he could be quiet and recover from the shock of having been so near death.The moving picture boys found plenty to do. In addition to getting off to the developing studio the films they had taken that day, they had to prepare for a hard day's work to follow, for, now that he had the wreck scene, Mr. Ringold declared that he needed some others to go with it to round out the drama of the sea that he had in mind when coming to the coast.It may seem that it would not pay to go to such big expense to make a single films play, or even one or two, but I assure my readers that it is not uncommon for a concern to spend ten thousand dollars in making a single play, and some elaborate productions, such as Shakespearian plays, and historical dramas, will cost over fifty thousand dollars to get ready to be filmed.Months are spent in preparation, rehearsals go on day after day, and finally the play itself is given, often not lasting more than an hour or half hour on the screen, yet representing many weary weeks of work, and the expenditure of large sums of money. Such is the moving picture business to-day.The boys were kept busy nearly all the rest of that week, and then came a period of calm. Joe sought out his father, who had steadily gained in strength after his sensational rescue, and began to question him as to his experiences, for Mr. Duncan had only given a mere outline of his experiences up to this time."
"""Well, I'm glad I've got my boy, anyhow,"" went on the former lighthouse worker, with a fond glance at Joe. ""Nothing is worse than to have folks, and not know where to find 'em. I hungered and longed for Joe for days and nights, and now I have him. And I'm not going to lose him again, either, if I can help it,"" and he clasped his son's hand warmly in his palm, while tears dimmed his eyes. Joe, too, was much affected.And what did, and how the two lads went on their new quest, will be related in the next volume of this series, to be entitled ""The Moving Picture Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Times Among the Wild Animals."" In it will be told of their adventures and you may learn whether or not they found Joe's sister.Preparations for taking the theatrical company back East were made; but Joe, Blake and Mr. Duncan were uncertain about accompanying them. While Joe and his father were talking over their plans, Blake went to San Francisco on a vacation for a week.But it was not much of a rest for him. While there he learned of a prize offered for the best moving picture of the fire department in action, and, though many operators tried, Blake's film was regarded as the best. He ""scooped"" the others easily, and beat some of the most skillful men in the business.THE ROVER BOYS IN THE AIR Or From College Campus to the Clouds THE ROVER BOYS DOWN EAST Or The Struggle for the Stanhope Fortune THE ROVER BOYS AT COLLEGE Or The Right Road and the Wrong THE ROVER BOYS ON TREASURE ISLE Or The Strange Cruise of the Steam Yacht THE ROVER BOYS ON THE FARM Or The Last Days at Putnam Hall THE ROVER BOYS IN SOUTHERN WATERS Or The Deserted Steam Yacht THE ROVER BOYS ON THE PLAINS Or The Mystery of Red Rock Ranch THE ROVER BOYS ON THE RIVER Or The Search for the Missing Houseboat THE ROVER BOYS IN CAMP Or The Rivals of Pine Island THE ROVER BOYS ON LAND AND SEA Or The Crusoes of Seven Islands THE ROVER BOYS IN THE MOUNTAINS Or A Hunt for Fame and Fortune THE ROVER BOYS ON THE GREAT LAKES Or The Secret of the Island Cave THE ROVER BOYS OUT WEST Or The Search for a Lost Mine THE ROVER BOYS IN THE JUNGLE Or Stirring Adventures in Africa THE ROVER BOYS ON THE OCEAN Or A Chase for a Fortune THE ROVER BOYS AT SCHOOL Or The Cadets of Putnam HallThe cadets are lively, flesh-and-blood fellows, bound to make friends from the start.
