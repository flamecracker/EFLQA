Oh, my! what a pie that shall be!"" exclaimed the cook, shutting up one eye to look through the other in a spasm of delight at an imaginary pie; ""so it's for Miss Mary, is it?""""Yes,"" said Phronsie, ""it is. Oh, Jefferson, I'm so glad you like to have me make one,"" she clasped her hands in silent rapture, and sat down on the lowest stair to think it over a bit, Jefferson looking at her, forgetful that the under cook was fuming in the deserted domains over his delay to return. At last he said, bowing respectfully, ""If you please, Miss, it's about time to begin. Such a pie ain't done without a deal of care, and we'd best have it a-baking as soon as may be.""""Yes,"" said Phronsie, getting off from her stair, and surrendering her hand to his big black palm, ""we ought to go right this very minute. But I must get my apron on;"" she stopped and looked down at her red dress.""Oh! you can take one of my aprons,"" said the cook, ""they're as fine, and big, and white, and I'll just put you in one of 'em and tie you up as snug; you'll come out as clean and sweet when we're through, as you are now, Miss.""""Well, Miss, I ain't just fit for a lily to touch and that's the truth,"" looking down at his palm that the small white hand grasped closely. ""It's clean, Miss,"" he added with pardonable pride, ""but it's awful black.""This important declaration over, the two set forth on their way toward the kitchen, Phronsie clinging to his hand, and chatting merrily over the particular pie in prospect, with varied remarks on pies in general, that by and by would be ventured upon if this present one were a success--and very soon tied up in one of the cook's whitest aprons she was seated with due solemnity at the end of the baking table, the proper utensils and materials in delightful confusion before her, and the lower order of kitchen satellites revolving around her, and Jefferson the lesser sphere.So Jefferson followed the under cook, the scullery boy went back to cleaning the knives, Susan, the parlor maid who was going through the kitchen with her dustpan and broom, hurried off with a backward glance or two, and Phronsie was left quite alone to hum her way along in her blissful culinary attempt.""Bless me!"" exclaimed a voice close to her small ear, as she was attempting for the fifth time to roll out the paste quite as thin as she had seen Jefferson do, ""what is this? Bless my soul! it's Phronsie!""""And see,"" said Phronsie, turning back to her efforts, while one hand grasped the old gentleman's palm, ""I've almost got it to look like Jefferson's. Almost, haven't I?"" she asked, regarding it anxiously.""Then some day I'll come down here again, Jefferson,"" cried Phronsie in a transport, ""and bake one for my dear Grandpapa. That is, if this one is good. Oh! you do suppose it will be good, don't you?"" appealingly at him."
"""It shall,"" said Jefferson stoutly, and seizing the rolling-pin with extreme determination. ""You want a bit more butter worked in, here,"" a dab with skillful fingers, and a little manipulation with the flour, a roll now and then most deftly, and the paste was laid out before Phronsie. ""Now, Miss, you can put it in the dish.""""Leave your fingers off from it, can't you?"" cried Mr. King sharply. ""Goodness! this pie isn't to have a professional touch about it. Get some more flour and stuff, whatever it is you make a pie of, and let her begin again. There, I'll sit down and watch you; then there'll be some chance of having things straight."" So he drew up a chair to the side of the table, first calling off Pete, the scullery boy, from his knives to come and wipe it off for him, and Mrs. Tucker who was in kitchen dialect ""Tucker,"" to see that the boy did his work well.""I don't want any observations from you,"" said the old gentleman, depositing himself in the chair. ""There, you can go back to your work, Mrs. Tucker, and you too, Pete. Now I'll see that this pie is to your liking, Phronsie.""""Grandpapa,"" she said at last slowly, ""I think I'd rather have the first pie, I really would, Grandpapa, may I?"" She brought her yellow head forward by a sudden movement, and looked deep into his keen eyes.""I think I'd rather do part of it,"" said Phronsie with great deliberateness, ""then Polly'll like it, and eat it, and I'll do yours, Grandpapa dear, just as Jefferson fixed mine, all alone. Please let me."" She held him fast with her eyes, and waited for his answer.""Here 'tis, Miss,"" said the cook, all his tremor over the blunder he had made, disappearing, since, after all, things were quite satisfactory. And the little plate forthcoming, Phronsie tucked away the paste lovingly in its depths, and began the important work of concocting the mixture with which the pie was to be filled, Mr. King sitting by with the gravity of a statue, even to the deliberate placing of each plum.""Oh! she's coming, Polly is!"" cried Phronsie, deserting a plum thrust in endwise in the middle of the pie, to throw her little sticky fingers around Jefferson's neck; ""oh! do take off my apron; and let me go. She'll see my pie!""""Stop!"" cried Mr. King, getting up somewhat stiffly to his feet, ""I'll take off the apron myself. There, Phronsie, there you are. Whew! how hot you keep your kitchen, Jefferson,"" and he wiped his face."
"""Now we'll run,"" said Phronsie softly, ""and not make a bit of noise, Grandpapa dear, and, Jefferson, please put on my top to the pie, and don't let it burn, and I'll come down very, very soon again, and bake one all alone by myself for Grandpapa.""""Don't feel badly, Polly dear,"" said Mrs. Whitney, over in the dim light, where the divan was drawn up in the east window, and she held out her hand and smiled; the other lady whose tete-a-tete was thus summarily disturbed was elderly and very tall and angular. She put up her eyeglass at the intrusion and murmured ""Ah?""""One of the children that your kindness received in this house?"" said the tall lady, making good use of the eyeglass. The color mounted steadily on Polly's already rosy cheek, at the scrutiny now going on with the greatest freedom.""Ah? I see. You are extremely good to put it in that way."" A low, well-bred laugh followed this speech. Its sound irritated the young girl's ear unspeakably, and the brown eyes flashed, and though there was really no occasion to feel what was not addressed to her, Polly was quite sure she utterly disliked the lady before her.""My dear Mrs. Chatterton,"" said Mrs. Whitney in the gentlest of accents, ""you do not comprehend; it is not possible for you to understand how very happy we all are here. The house is quite another place, I assure you, from the abode you saw last before you went abroad.""""Polly dear,"" said Mrs. Whitney with a smile, ""say good-morning to Mrs. Chatterton, and then run away. I will hear your wonderful plan by and by. I shall be glad to, child,"" she was guilty of whispering in the small ear.""Mrs. Chatterton. And she looked at me--oh! I can't tell you how she looked; as if I were a bug, or a hateful worm beneath her,"" cried Polly, quite as much aghast at herself. ""It makes me feel horridly, Jasper--you can't think. Oh! that old""--He stopped, pulling himself up with quite an effort. ""Has she come back--what brought her, pray tell, so soon?""""Oh! she always sticks up that thing in her eye,"" said Jasper coolly, ""and she's everlastingly ventilating that laugh on everybody. She thinks it high-bred and elegant, but it makes people want to kill her for it."" He looked and spoke annoyed. ""To think you fell into her clutches!"" he added.""She's been abroad for a good half-dozen years, and why she doesn't stay there when everybody supposed she was going to, astonishes me,"" said Jasper, after a moment. ""Well, it will not be for long, I presume, that we shall have the honor; she'll be easily tired of America, and take herself off again."""
"""Home? Yes, an estate down in Bedford County?-Dunraven Lodge; but it's all shut up, and in the hands of agents who have been trying for the half-dozen years she was abroad, to sell it for her. She may have come back to settle down there again, there's no telling what she will do. In the meantime, I fancy she'll make her headquarters here,"" he said gloomily.""I don't see what can,"" said Jasper, prolonging the gloom to feel the comfort it brought. ""You see she has nobody who wants her, to step in and relieve us. She has two nephews, but oh! you ought to see them fight!""""It is greatly to your discredit, Marian,"" said Mrs. Chatterton in a high, cold voice, ""that you didn't stop all this nonsense on your father's part, before the thing got to such a pass as to install them in this house.""""You may pause just where you are, Mrs. Chatterton,"" said Marian, still with the gentlest of accents, but with a determination that made the other look down at her in astonishment, ""not another word shall you utter in that strain, nor will I listen to it."" And with fine temper undisturbed in her blue eyes, she regarded her relative.Mrs. Chatterton drew out a vinaigrette, then a fan from a silken bag, with clasps that she was always glad to reflect were heirlooms. ""It's trying, I must confess,"" she declared, alternately applying the invigorating salts and waving the combination of gauze and sandalwood, ""to come home to such a reception. But,"" and a heavy sigh, ""I must bear it.""""Oh! I don't know that I care about seeing Cousin Horatio yet,"" said Mrs. Chatterton carelessly. ""He will probably fall into one of his rages, and my nerves have been upset quite enough by you. I think I'll go directly to my apartments."" She rose also.""You have well said,"" observed Mr. King, seating himself with the utmost deliberateness, and drawing Phronsie to her accustomed place on his knee, where she nestled, regardless of his immaculate linen and fine waistcoat, ""Phronsie Pepper is indeed a fine child; a very fine child, Madam.""""Phronsie Pepper's hands are never dirty, Madam,"" said the old gentleman gravely. ""Sit still, child,"" as Phronsie in a state of alarm struggled to slip down from his lap, thrusting the two members thus referred to, well out before her.Mrs. Chatterton burst into a loud laugh. ""To think I have come to see Horatio King in such a state! Jasper Horatio King!"" she repeated scornfully. ""I heard about it through the Bascombs' letters, but I wouldn't believe it till I used my eyes. It's positively dreadful!""Mr. King put back his head and laughed also; so heartily, that Phronsie ceased to struggle, and turned to regard him in silent astonishment; and Mrs. Whitney, charmed that the rage usually produced by conversation with Cousin Algernon's wife was not forthcoming, began to laugh, too, so that the amusement of the tall lady was quenched in the general hilarity.""And that you can talk with that chit, ignoring me, your cousin's wife, is insufferable."" Mrs. Chatterton now arose speedily from the divan, and shook out a flounce or two with great venom. ""I had intended to make you a visit. Now it is quite impossible."""
"""As you like,"" said the old gentleman, also rising, and placing Phronsie on her feet, observing ostentatious care to keep her hand. ""My house is open to you, Eunice,"" with a wave of his disengaged hand in old-time hospitality, ""but of course you must suit yourself.""""It's rather hard upon a person of sensibility, to come home after a six years' absence,"" said Cousin Eunice with a pathetic sniff, and once more seeking her vinaigrette in the depths of the silken bag, ""to meet only coldness and derision. In fact, it is very hard.""""No doubt, no doubt,"" said the old gentleman hastily, ""I can imagine such a case, but it has nothing to do with you. Now, if you are going to stay, Eunice, say so at once, and proceed to your room. If not, why you must go, and understand it is no one's fault but your own.""""Yes, I do,"" said Phronsie decidedly, ""I do, Grandpapa. Now I know she hasn't any little girls--if she had little girls, she wouldn't say such very unnice things; I want the poor lady to stay with me.""""Come, Marian,"" said Mrs. Chatterton, holding out her hand to Mrs. Whitney. ""You may help me to my apartments if you like. I am quite unstrung by all this,"" and she swept out without a backward glance.""Well, now then, you've a piece of work on your hands about the biggest you ever did yet, Polly Pepper!"" cried Jasper, ""to make things comfortable in this house. I shall be just as cross as can be imagined, to begin with.""So the ceremony of sealing the compact having been observed with great gravity, Phronsie drew a long breath, and now felt that the ""poor lady"" might come down at any time to find all things prepared for her.""So you are intending to honor me, are you?"" cried his father, vastly pleased to find himself as ever, the central figure in their plans. ""Well, well, I dare say it will all be as fine as can be to welcome these young scapegraces home. What next, Polly?""""It must be kept a perfect surprise,"" cried Polly, clasping her hands while the color flew over her face. ""No one must even whisper it to each other, the day before Christmas when the boys get here, for Joel is so very dreadful whenever there is a secret.""""Nonsense! What of it--you are the baby of this household."" But he set her on her feet nevertheless, one hand still patting the soft yellow waves over her brow. ""Go on, Polly, do, and lay the whole magnificence before father. He will be quite overcome.""""Jasper is to be one of the dragons,"" announced Polly, quite in her element, ""that is, the head dragon; Ben is to be another, and we haven't quite decided whether to ask Archy Hurd or Clare to take the third one.""""Oh, now! you are not going to frighten my little girl,"" cried Mr. King. ""I protest against the whole thing if you do,"" and he put out his hand. ""Come, Phronsie,"" when, as of old, she hurried to his side obediently."
"""Oh! we are going to show her the boys, and how we dress them up just like dragons,"" cried Polly, ""and while they are prancing around and slashing their tails at rehearsal, I'm going to keep saying, 'That's nothing but Jasper and Ben and Clare, you know, Phronsie,' till I get her accustomed to them. You won't be frightened, will you, pet, at those dear, sweet old dragons?"" she ended, and getting on her knees, she looked imploringly into Phronsie's brown eyes.""They really will be,"" cried Polly, enchanted at her success, ""Jasper and Ben and Clare; and they will give you a ride, and show you a cave, oh! and perfect quantities of things; you can't think how many!"" ""Now, Phronsie,"" said Polly, on her knees before the Princess, who was slowly evolving into ""a thing of beauty,"" ""do hold still just a minute, dear. There,"" as she thrust in another pin, then turned her head critically to view her work, ""I do hope that is right.""""To be sure you may,"" said Polly, looking into the flushed little face; ""I'll tell you, you may walk over to the window and back, once; that'll rest you and give me a chance to see what is the matter with that back drapery.""So Phronsie, well pleased, gathered up the embyro robe of the Princess and moved off, a bewildering tangle of silver spangles and floating lace, drawn over the skirt of one of Mrs. Whitney's white satin gowns.""There ought to be a dash of royal purple somewhere,"" said Polly, sitting on the floor to see her go, and resting her tired hands on her knees. ""Now where shall I get it, and where shall I put it when I do have it?"" She wrinkled up her eyebrows a moment, lost in thought over the momentous problem. ""Oh! I know,"" and she sprang up exultingly. ""Phronsie, won't this be perfectly lovely? we can take that piece of tissue paper Auntie gave you, and I can cut out little knots and sashes. It is so soft, that in the gaslight they will look like silk. How fine!""""Why, yes, you can be, of course,"" said Polly, ""but you can't be as good a one as if you had a dash of royal purple about you. What's a bit of tissue paper to the glory of being a Princess?"" she cried, with sparkling eyes. ""Dear me, I wish I could be one.""""I think there won't be much left of it when the play is over,"" cried Polly with a laugh; ""why, the dragons are going to carry you off to their cave, you know, and you are to be rescued by the knight, just think, Phronsie! You can't expect to have such perfectly delightful times, and come out with a quantity of tissue paper all safe. Something has to be scarified to royalty, child.""""When you get your little silver cap on with one of Auntie's diamond rings sewed in it, why, you'll be too magnificent for anything,"" said Polly, now pulling and patting with fresh enthusiasm, since the ""purple dash"" was forthcoming.""Of course not; they have diamonds by the bushel, and don't need to sew rings in their caps to make them sparkle,"" said Polly, plaiting and pinning rapidly, ""but in dressing up for a play, we have to take a poetic license. There, turn just one bit to the right, Phronsie dear.""""Now this left side,"" said Polly, twisting her head to obtain a good view of the point in question, ""is just right; I couldn't do it any better if I were to try a thousand times. Why won't this other one behave, and fall into a pretty curve, I wonder?"""
"""I shall gather it up anyway, so,"" and Polly crushed the refractory folds recklessly in one hand; ""that's the way Mary Gibbs's hat trimmings look, and I'm sure they're a complete success. Oh! that's lovely,"" cried Polly, at the effect. ""Now, that's the treatment the whole drapery needs,"" she added in the tone of an art connoisseur. ""Oh!""""It's quarter-past four,"" said Jasper, laughing and pulling out his watch; ""we gave you an extra fifteen minutes, as you had such a lot to do. Dear me! but you are fine, Phronsie. I make my obeisance to Princess Clotilde!"" and he bowed low to the little silver and white figure, as did the other two boys, and then drew off to witness the final touches.""You'll think it is even much nicer when it is done,"" said Polly, vastly relieved that Jasper had given such a kind verdict. ""It's to have a dash of royal purple on that right side, and in one of the shoulder knots, and to catch up her train.""""Well, it's a perfect relief,"" said Polly, ""to have you boys come in. I've been working so over it that I was ready to say it was horrid. It's too bad, isn't it, that Dick can't be here to-day to rehearse his part?""""Thank you for a hint,"" cried Jasper, pulling out his pencil. ""I didn't say 'fair'; that's better than 'gentle.' I wish critics would always be so useful as to give one good idea. Heigho! here goes again: ""'Fair ladies and brave sirs, The player's art is to amuse, Instruct, or to confuse By too much good advice, But poorly given: That no one follows, because, forsooth, 'Tis thrown at him, neck and heels. The drama, pure and simple, is forgot In tugging in the moral'""?""Oh! I am so glad,"" exclaimed Polly in glee, and dancing around the room. ""And you won't be sorry, I know, Bensie; the audience will applaud that very thing I'm almost sure,"" which made Jasper sternly resolve something on the spot.""Do let her sleep through this piece of stupidity,"" said Jasper, bundling up another satin skirt that Mrs. Whitney had loaned for Polly to make a choice from. ""There,"" putting it under the yellow head, ""we'll call her when the dragons come on.""""Beg pardon,"" said Jasper, relinquishing it speedily. ""Here's the sofa pillow, after all,"" dragging it from its temporary retirement under the theatrical debris. ""Now let's get back to work; time is going fast."" In a lowered voice:"
"""'We have a princess, to be sure, A sweet and gracious Clotilde, And a knight who does her homage, But the rest of us Are fishy, scaly, Horny and altogether horrid, And of very low degree Who scarce know why we are upon the boards, Except for your amusement, So prithee'""? ""'So prithee, be amused; We're undone, if you are not, And all our labor lost. Pray laugh, and shake your sides, And say ""'tis good; I' faith, 'tis very good."" And we shall say ""Your intellects do you credit."" And so we bid you a fond adieu, And haste away to unshackle the dragons, Who even now do roar without.'""""Just a lot of dreadful words,"" said Clare over in the corner, pulling at a heap of costumes on the floor. ""Never mind; the horrible spell is broken; come on, you fellows, and tumble into your dragon skins!""""Now, Phronsie,"" said Jasper, coming back, half-within his dragon skin and gesticulating, ""you see that it's only I in this thing. Look, dear! here goes in my head,"" and he pulled on the scaly covering, observing great care to smile reassuringly the last thing before his countenance was obscured.""You run along, daughter,"" said the old gentleman, ""and get what I tell you. This is my affair; it's a musicale and something else combined. I don't just know myself."" And he laughed at the sight of her face.""Whether the other chaps have done well, I don't know. Davie may have kept at it, but I suspect the rest of the boys haven't killed themselves with hard study. But they shall have a good home-coming, at any rate.""""Now I'm going to send out these invitations""--he pushed the list toward her--""I shall have the drawing-room and music-room floors covered, and all extra seats arranged, give Turner carte blanche as to flowers, if he can't furnish enough out of our own conservatories--and the evening will end with a handsome 'spread,' as Jasper calls it. In short, I shall recognize their attempt to make it pleasant for the boys' holiday, by helping them out on the affair all I can."" The old gentleman now leaned back in his big chair and studied his daughter's face.""Don't I know it?"" cried Mr. King, getting out of his chair hastily to pace the floor. ""Goodness me! they repay me already. They're fine young things, every one of them--Whitneys, Peppers and my boy--as fine as they are made. And whoever says they're not, doesn't know a good piece of work when it's before his eyes. Bless me!"" pulling out his handkerchief to mop his face violently, ""I don't want to see any finer.""""If you can only keep HER out of the way,"" exclaimed Mr. King, pointing irascibly in the direction of Mrs. Chatterton's apartments, ""all will be well. But I doubt if you can; her meddlesome ears and tongue will be at work as usual,"" he added in extreme vexation."
"""The private boxes trouble me, I must confess,"" said Polly, drumming absently on the keys, while Jasper spread the sheet of music on the rack. ""You know there must be two; one for dear Mr. King and one for the boys as guests of honor. Now how shall we manage them?""""It's pretty hard to get them up, that's a fact,"" said Jasper truthfully, ""but then, you know, Polly, we've always found that when a thing had to be done, it was done. You know the little brown house taught us that.""""I suppose so too,"" said Mrs. Pepper, passing the door, as usual with her mending basket, ""and when two people start to play a duet, I think they much better put their minds on that, and not waste precious time on all sorts of questions that will take care of themselves when the time comes.""The twenty-first of December came all too soon for Polly and Jasper, whose school duties had engrossed them till two days before, but after hard work getting up the stage properties, and the many rehearsals, everything was at last pronounced ready, the drawing-room and music-room locked, the keys given to Mrs. Whitney who promised faithfully to see that no one peeped in who should not, and Polly hurried into her hat and jacket, to go to the station with Jasper to meet the boys.""Go along, do, then,"" he cried; ""I don't want to, I'm sure; I'd much rather stay with Polly. How d'ye do, Thomas?"" he called carelessly to the coachman on his box, who was continually touching his hat and indulging in broad smiles of content.Polly was tiptoeing in very delight, holding Davie's hand closely while her eyes roved from one to the other of the boys, and her tongue ran fast indeed. A group of girls, who had also come down to the station to meet friends, stopped a bit as they came laughing and chatting by.""You are--you are,"" cried Joel, capering up and down the platform, his black eyes shining with delight. ""Now I know for certain, and it's at our house, too, for you asked Polly if you might bring some other girl, Elsie somebody or other, so! Oh! I'll soon know.""Van opened his lips to tell where Jasper had gone, but remembering Percy's delight in such an expedition, he closed them quickly, and added himself to the company in the carriage. Davie followed, and closed the door quickly.""Oh!"" and Percy, thinking that Joel had stolen a march on them on his good strong legs, now cried lustily, ""Go on, Thomas; get ahead as fast as you can,"" and presently he was lost in the babel of laughter and chatter going on in the coach.""You keep still,"" cried Van, flaming up, and whirling away from his window. ""You didn't take any, either. Polly, his head was under water all the time, unless some of the boys tugged him along every day. We hardly got him home at all.""""I don't want any one to help me, who speaks so to his brother,"" said Polly in a low voice, and with her most superb air stepping down alone, she ran up the steps to leave them staring in each other's faces.""Mamsie!"" cried Polly, breaking away from the mirror where she was pulling into place the bright brown waves over her forehead, ""how lovely! you've put on your black silk; and your hair is just beautiful!""""Yes, I have good hair,"" said Mrs. Pepper, ""and I'm thankful for it. No one looks dressed up, in my opinion, with a ragged head. The finer the gown, the worse it makes careless hair look. No, Polly, I wouldn't wear the brown dress to-night."""
"""Why, Mamsie!"" exclaimed Polly in surprise, ""I thought you'd say it was just the thing when only the girls and Jappy's friends are coming to the play. Besides, I don't want to look too dressed up; the Princess ought to be the only one in a white gown.""""I don't want any part,"" cried Polly; ""they all play better than I do. Somebody must see that everything goes off well behind the scenes; that's my place, Mamsie. Besides, you forget I am to play my sonata.""""All right,"" cried Polly, merrily dashing across the room to Felicie, ""put it over my head, do. Well, I'm glad you think it is right to wear it, Mamsie,"" as the soft folds fell around her. ""I just love this dress. Oh, Auntie! how perfectly exquisite!""""Well, I am worrying,"" confessed Polly, quite in a tremble; ""I must see to one corner of the private box for the boys. You know the last India shawl you lent me wasn't pinned up straight and I couldn't fix it, for Van wanted me just then, and I couldn't get away without his suspecting something. Oh, Auntie! if you would see to that.""""And you don't need to go into the drawing-room at all,"" said Mrs. Whitney, going to the door. ""Just keep behind the scenes, and get your actors and Phronsie ready, and your mother and I will receive your friends. Come, Mrs. Pepper.""""Oh! a few girls and boys make just about as much confusion as a good many,"" observed Polly. ""Jasper, wouldn't you like to see Joel's eyes when Aunt Whitney leads him into the private box?"" she allowed herself time to exclaim. ""Yes,"" laughed Jasper, pulling out his watch from beneath his dragon-skin; ""well, we have only five minutes more, Polly. We must have the curtain up sharp.""""O dear, dear!"" cried Polly, flying here and there to bestow last touches on the different members of her cast. ""Now, Clare, you must remember not to give such a shriek when you go on, mustn't he, Jappy? Just a dull, sullen roar, your part is.""""Very well,"" said Polly, ""I don't know but it's as well, after all, that you are cross; you'll be more effective,"" she added coolly. ""Let me see--oh! the door of the cave wants a bit more of gray moss; it looks thin where it hangs over. You get it, will you, Hannah?"" to one of the maids who was helping."
"""And just one thing more,"" scanning hastily the stage setting, ""another Chinese lantern is needed right here,"" going toward the front of the stage, ""and that green bush is tumbling over; do set it straight, somebody; there now, I believe everything is all ready. Now let us peep out of the curtain, and get one good look at the audience. Come, Phronsie, here's a fine place; come, boys!""""What, what?"" cried Polly, gazing into the sea of faces, and the dragons nearly knocked the Princess over as Mr. King gave the signal for the band stationed in the wide hall, to send out their merriest strains. It was all over. Phronsie had been swept off, a vision of loveliness, to the cave; the dragons had roared their loudest, and the gallant knight had covered himself with glory in the brilliant rescue of the Princess; the little page had won the hearts of all the ladies; Mr. King had applauded himself hoarse, especially during the delivery of the prologue, when ""I cry you mercy, sirs, and ladies fair,"" rang out; the musical efforts of Polly and Jasper in the ""Wait"" between the two acts were over, and the crowded house, in every way possible, had expressed itself delighted with all things from beginning to end.""Thank you,"" she said, bowing gravely to the sea of faces, as her hands were filled with roses, ""but I shall give these to Polly, because we couldn't any of us have done it without her."" And so she brought them back to put into dismayed Polly's lap.So the chief dragon led up blushing Polly to the front of the stage, to hear a neat little speech from Mr. Alstyne, thanking them for the pleasure of the evening and congratulating them on its success; and the band played again, the camp chairs were folded up and removed, the green-room and stage were deserted, and actors and audience mingled in a gay, confusing throng.Phronsie, in her little silver and white gown and gleaming cap, began to wander among the guests, unconscious that she had not on the red cashmere dress she had worn all day. Groups stopped their conversation to take her into their midst, passing her on at last as one might hand over a precious parcel to the next waiting hands. Polly, seeing that she was well cared for, gave herself up to the enjoyment of the evening.""Well enough,"" said Joel, ""but why didn't you make more of it? You could have crawled up on top of the cave, and slashed around there; and you old dragons were just three muffs in the last act. I'd rather have had Polly in the play; she's twice the go in her.Polly's feet twitched nervously under her white gown, and she longed more than ever after the excitement she had passed through, to lose herself in the witching music, and the mazy dance. She hesitated a bit, but just then glancing across the room, ""Come,"" she said, ""I want you to dance with Ray Simmons. You can't refuse,"" using his own words; and before he was conscious how it was done, he was by Ray's side, and asking for the pleasure of the dance.Polly stood quite still and saw them go away and take the last places in the set, and a sorry little droop fell upon the curves of the laughing mouth. She was very tired, and the elation that had possessed her over the success of the evening was fast dropping out, now that everybody was enjoying themselves in their own way, leaving her alone. She felt left out in the cold; and though she fought against it, a faint feeling of regret stole over her for what she had done. She almost wished she was standing there by the side of Pickering Dodge, one of the bright group on whom the eyes of the older people were all turned, as they waited for the first figure to begin.""Yes, indeed,"" said Mr. Alstyne, his keen eyes searching her face. ""Well, now, Polly, your dragons, although not exactly like any living ones extant, made me think of some I saw at the Zoo, in London. Do you want me to tell you how?""""But some one else ought to interfere,"" cried Alexia, with a little pout, provoked at his indifference; ""that's just the way she does in school all the time. Oh! I'm vexed at her, I can tell you. She's so silly--dear me, it's our turn again."""
"""It was a perfectly splendid play!"" cried Alexia, ""and much too good for a lot of boys. Goodness, Joey, I wouldn't celebrate if you four were coming home from school to our house. I'd have the jollification the night before you went back.""""I much prefer waiting upon Miss Polly Pepper to any other lady in the room,"" said Mr. Alstyne, with another bow, courtlier than the first, ""since Mrs. Alstyne is provided for. See, Polly, Mr. King is taking her out. And your mother has her cavalier, in Mr. Cabot; and Mrs. Whitney has already gone out with Mr. Fairfax. So if you don't accept my services, I shall be entirely left out in the cold."" He stood offering his arm, and Polly, laughing merrily, put her hand within it.""I'm afraid if you had trusted to Joel's tender mercies, you would have fared hardly,"" said Mr. Alstyne, laughing. ""Look, Polly, over yonder in the corner."" They were just passing into the supper room, and now caught sight of Joel chatting away to a very pretty little creature, in blue and white, as busily and unconcernedly as if he had done that sort of thing for years.""Yes, thank you,"" said Polly absently, not being able to take her eyes from Joel and his friend. At last, by the force of attraction, he turned and looked at her. But instead of showing self-consciousness, his round eyes surveyed her coolly, while he went on talking and laughing with the little blue-and-white thing.""On the other hand,"" said Alexia, sending swift, bird-like glances around the supper room, ""there are Van and Percy moping off by themselves as if they hadn't a friend in the world. What a pity; they used to be so lively at parties.""Polly wrenched her gaze away from the astonishing sight on which it had been fixed, and following Alexia's glance, took a keen look over at the young Whitneys. ""Oh! oh! I must go to them,"" she cried remorsefully. ""Tell Mr. Alstyne, please, when he comes back, where I am,"" and without another word she dashed back of some gaily dressed ladies just entering the supper room, and was out of the door.""If I ever did!"" cried Alexia irritably to herself, ""see anything so queer! Now she thinks she must race after those boys. I wish I'd kept still. Jasper, she's just as funny as ever,"" as he came up with a plate of salad, and some oysters. ""Who?"" said the boy; ""is this right, Alexia?"" offering the plate."
"""Why, Polly,"" said Alexia; ""yes, that's lovely,"" with a comforted glance at the plate and its contents. ""Oh! she's gone off, Mr. Alstyne,"" to that gentleman, approaching with Polly's ice. ""You can't expect her to stay for the goodies,"" beginning to nibble at her own.""We didn't mean anything,"" said Percy, pushing one foot back and forth in an embarrassed way, and looking as if he did not know what to do with his hands, which confused him more than anything else, as he had been quite sure of them on all previous occasions.""Now, boys,"" said Polly, turning back to them and whispering busily, ""I know you won't ever say such perfectly dreadful things to each other again. And so I'm going to ask you both to get me something to eat, will you?""""Because I shall then have nothing whatever to eat,"" said Polly merrily, ""for of course I can't take a bit from anybody else after refusing Mr. Alstyne's kindness. Don't you see? Oh, Percy! you wouldn't quite do that?""""Splendid,"" said Polly, shaking herself free from the white gown and beginning to braid her hair for the night. ""Percy and Van were perfectly lovely, and Mr. Alstyne was so good to me. And oh! Mamsie, isn't dear Mr. King just the dearest dear, to give all this to the boys? We haven't thanked him half enough.""""She was right back of you,"" said Polly. ""She wanted to take off her things herself. Did you ever see such a sweet""--she began, but Mrs. Pepper did not stop to hear, hurrying out to the adjoining room, shared by the mother and her baby.""Oh, yes! he is quite really and truly all well,"" declared Phronsie, breaking into another glad little laugh. ""He said he never had such a beautiful time in his life, and he is just as well as he can be. Oh, Polly!"" as she picked up her Princess gown and prepared to ascend the stairs, ""how funny you look sitting there!"" They were all sitting around the library fire; Polly under the pretext of holding Phronsie's head in her lap, was sitting on the rug beside her, the boys on either hand; old Mr. King was marching up and down the long room, and looking at them. The merriest of stories had been told, Polly urging on all the school records of jolly times, and those not so enjoyable; songs had been sung, and all sorts of nonsense aired. At last Joel sprang up and ran over to pace by the old gentleman's side.""It's winter,"" observed the old gentleman, and stepping to the window he put aside the draperies, to peer out into the black evening. ""Yes, it really is winter,"" he added with a shiver, to the boy who was close behind, and as if no longer in doubt about it, he added most emphatically, ""it really is winter, Joel.""""Well, but you never saw anything like it, how magnificent winter is in Badgertown,"" cried Joel in an excited whisper. ""Such hills to coast down; the snow is always crisp there, sir, not like this dirty town mud. And the air is as dry as punk,"" he added artfully. ""Oh! 'twould be such a lark;"" he actually clasped his hands."
"""Ugh-ow!"" squealed Joel, utterly forgetful of his caution of secrecy, ""we can, we can; we can open the little brown house, and build great fires there, and""--But he got no further. Into the midst of Van's liveliest sally, came the words ""little brown house,"" bringing all the young people to their feet, Phronsie running to the old gentleman's side, with, ""What is it, Grandpapa? He said the little brown house.""""Get away!"" cried Joel crossly to the besiegers, each and all wildly clamoring. ""What is it? What are you talking about? It's my secret,"" he cried, ""and his,"" pointing with a dismayed finger to Mr. King.""Well, it isn't a secret any longer,"" cried Polly, flushing with excitement. ""You said 'little brown house,' we heard you just as plainly; and you re getting up something, I know you are."" ""People don't usually select a roomful of listeners, and then shout out their secrets,"" said Jasper. ""You are in for it now, Joe, and no mistake. Go ahead, old fellow, and give us the rest of it.""So Joel, thus set upon, allowed the whole beautiful plan to be wrung from him, by slow and torturing installments; how they all were to go to Badgertown, open the little brown house, and stay there--here he glanced at Mr. King--""perhaps a week,"" he brought out suddenly, filling the time with all sorts of frolics, and playing they were there again, and really and truly living in the old home.""Oh! I forgot,"" exclaimed Polly, when at last they gathered in the wide hall, disposing themselves on the chairs and along the stairs, all tired out. ""She has gone to evening meeting with Auntie. How stupid of me not to remember that.""""Well, I declare!"" cried a voice above them, and looking up they met the cold blue eyes of Mrs. Chatterton regarding them over the railing. ""Cousin Horatio, do you keep a menagerie, or a well-ordered house, I beg to inquire?""""Hum; I understand. I'm not so dull as you think. Well, you've changed, let me tell you, vastly, and not for the better either, in the last six years. Who would ever suppose I see before me fastidious Horatio King!"" she exclaimed, lifting her long thin hands to show him their horror-stricken palms.But when Mother Pepper and Mrs. Whitney did come home from the meeting, oh! what a time there was. They all fell upon her, as soon as the door opened, and the whole air was filled with ""little brown house."" ""May we--may we?"" ""A whole week."" ""Two days, Mamsie, do say yes,"" and Phronsie's glad little chirp ""Grandpapa wants to go, he does!"" ending every other exclamation."
"Phronsie was not too big to jump into the comfortable lap, and while her fingers played with the bonnet strings, she laid the whole delightful plan open, the others hanging over them in ill-suppressed excitement.""Dear Grandpapa,"" proceeded Phronsie, turning her yellow head to look at him, her hand yet among the bonnet strings, ""is going to take us all, every single one, to see the little brown house, and just touch it once, and be sure it's there, and peek in the doors and windows and""--""That's so,"" cried old Mr. King, ""and whoever finds it out early in life, is the lucky one. Now, children, off with you and talk it over,"" he cried, dismissing them as if they were all below their teens. ""I want to talk with Mrs. Pepper now.""And in two days they were ready to go. Mrs. Chatterton with nose high in the air, and plentiful expressions of disgust at such a mid-winter expedition, taking herself off to make a visit of corresponding length to some distant relatives.""I hope and pray this may not get into a society paper,"" she cried at the last, as she was seated in the carriage, ""but of course it will; outre things always do. And we shall be disgraced for life. One comfort remains to me, I am not in it.""Mother Pepper and the five little Peppers were going back to the little brown house. ""Really and truly we are,"" as Phronsie kept saying over and over again with every revolution of the car-wheels, in a crooning fashion, and making it impossible for Mr. King to shiver in apprehension at the step he was taking. Were not two cases of blankets and household comforts safely packed away in the luggage car? ""It's not such a dreadful risk,"" said the old gentleman gruffly to himself, ""it's quite a common occurrence nowadays to take a winter outing in the country. We're all right,"" and he re-enforced himself further by frequent glances at Mrs. Pepper's black bonnet, two seats off.It was to be a three-days' frolic, after all. Not that the whole party were to stay in the little brown house. O dear, no! how could they? It was only big enough for the Peppers. So Mrs. Whitney and her three boys, with Mr. King, and Jasper, who concealed many disappointed feelings, planned to settle down in the old hotel at Hingham.""Did you get my letter?"" exclaimed Mother Pepper to Mrs. Henderson, who was pressing up to grasp her hand, and preparing to fall on the young folks separately. The parson stood just back, biding his time with a smile.""Oh! you are so good and thoughtful, dear Mrs. Henderson,"" cried Mrs. Pepper with delight at the thought of the homelike warmth of the parsonage life awaiting the old gentleman, for whom she was dreading the dreary hotel.Jasper gave a shout when the new arrangement was declared, as it presently was by Percy and Van, who flung themselves after him as he was seeing to the luggage with Ben, and his face glowed with the greatest satisfaction.""That is jolly,"" he exclaimed, ""and that's a fact! Now, Ben, we're but a stone's throw apart. Rather different, isn't it, old fellow, from the time when I used to race over from Hingham with Prince at my heels?"""
"""I couldn't get here before,"" he cried, his eyes glowing behind his spectacles. ""I've left a very sick patient. This is good,"" he took them all in with a loving glance, but his hand held to Polly. ""Now I'm going to drive you down in my gig,"" he said to her at last. ""Will you come?""""Yes, indeed,"" cried Polly in delight, as her mother smiled approval, and she ran off to let him help her in. ""It's only yesterday since you took me to drive, Dr. Fisher, and you gave me my stove--is it?"" And so she rambled on, the little doctor quite charmed to hear it all.But Mr. Tisbett had a truly dreadful time placing his party in the old stage, as the townsfolk, fearful that so good a chance for seeing the Peppers would not happen during the three days' stay, insisted on crowding up close to the ancient vehicle, and getting in everybody's way, thereby calling forth some exclamations from Mr. King that could not be regarded as exactly complimentary. And quite sure that he was a frightful tyrant, they fell back with many a pitying glance at the Pepper family whom he was endeavoring to assist into their places.At last it was all accomplished in some way, and Mr. Tisbett cracked his whip, Mrs. Pepper and Phronsie leaned out of the window to bow right and left into smiling faces, Ben and Davie did the same over their heads. ""Don't let me look--oh! don't let me look,"" cried Polly in the old gig, and twisting around, she hid her face against the faded green cloth side. ""I ought not to see the little brown house before Mamsie and the others do.""""I'll turn down the lane,"" said the little doctor, ""so""; and suiting the action to the word, Polly could feel that they were winding down the narrow little road over toward Grandma Bascom's. She could almost smell the violets and anemones under the carpet of snow, and could scarcely restrain herself from jumping out for a riotous run.""Don't go too far away,"" she cried in sudden alarm. ""We must be there by the time the stage does."" And she applied her eye to the little circular glass in the back of the gig. ""Will it never come--oh! here it is, here it is, dear Dr. Fisher."" And with a quick flourish around of the old horse, they were soon before the little brown house, and helping out the inmates of the stage, who with more speed than grace were hurrying over the steps.""It's really here!"" cried Phronsie with wide eyes, standing quite still on a hummock of frozen snow, with her eyes riveted on the house. ""It really is!"" Polly had raced up the winding path, and over the flat stone to drop a kiss on the little old door.""Hum! I think, Jasper, you and I will let them alone for a few moments,"" said Mr. King, who was still within the stage. ""Here, my good fellow,"" to Mr. Tisbett, ""you say it's all comfortable in there for them?"""
"""Yes, yes, sir,"" said Mr. Tisbett heartily. ""Good land! Mis' Henderson had her boys come down airly this mornin' and make the fires; and there's a mighty sight of things to eat."" The stage-driver put one foot on the hind wheel to facilitate conversation, and smacked his lips.""Get up and drive us on, I say,"" commanded the old gentleman, ""and cease your talking,"" which had the effect to send honest Mr. Tisbett clambering expeditiously up to the box, where he presently revenged himself by driving furiously over all the hard frozen ruts he could quickly select, determined not to stop till he was obliged to.""The road is well enough,"" said Jasper, who couldn't bear to have a word uttered against Badgertown, ""it's the fellow's driving that makes it rough. Here, can't you be a little more careful to keep the road?"" he called, thrusting his head out of the window. But he only narrowly escaped losing his brown traveling cap for his pains, as the stage gave a worse lurch than before, to introduce a series of creakings and joltings hitherto unparalleled.""I cannot endure this much longer,"" said old Mr. King, growing white around the mouth, and wishing he had strength for one-half the exclamations he felt inwardly capable of. Outside, honest Mr. Tisbett was taking solid comfort in the reflection that he was teaching a rich city man that he could not approach with anything less than respect a citizen of Badgertown.""Ain't I as good as he?"" cried Mr. Tisbett to himself, with an extra cut to the off horse, as he spied a sharp ragged edge of ice along the cart track in front of him. ""Now that's good; that'll shake him,"" he added cheerfully. ""Land! but I hain't been spoke to so since I was sassed at school by Jim Bently, and then I licked him enough to pay twice over. G'lang there--easy!""""The matter is,"" said Jasper, putting his face out, ""that as I could not possibly make you hear my calls, I chose to break the window. Have the goodness to let my father and me at once out of this vehicle.""""Here is the money for your window,"" said Jasper, putting a bill into the fur mitten, covering Mr. Tisbett's brawny right hand. ""Kindly bring our traps to the little brown house; here, father, take my arm,"" and he ran after the tall figure, picking its way along the frozen road.He stood staring at the bill in stupid perplexity till the uneasy movements of his horses warned him that his position was not exactly the proper one for a stage-driver who was on his box from morning till night, so he clambered over the wheel, full of vexed thoughts, and carefully tucked the bill under the old cushion before he took his seat.But the stern faces of the old gentleman and the tall boy smote him with a chill, long before he passed them, and he drove by silently, well knowing it would not do to broach the subject by so much as a look.Not daring to go near the little brown house without the occupants of the stage who had driven down the road with him, Mr. Tisbett drew up miserably to a convenient angle, and waited till the two came up. Then without trusting himself to think, he sprang to the ground, and with shame written all over his honest face, called out, ""See here, you young chap, I want to speak to you, when you've got him in the house.""""I've made an awful mess for 'em all, and they just come home,"" groaned Mr. Tisbett; drawing his fur mitten across his eyes, and leading his horses, he followed at a funeral pace, careful not to stop at the gate until the door was closed, when he began furiously to unload.A footstep crunching the snow, broke into the noise he was making. ""Hoh! well,"" he exclaimed, pausing with a trunk half-off the rack, ""it's a mighty awkward thing for a man to say he's sorry, but you bet I be, as cert'in as my name's John Tisbett."" His face became so very red that Jasper hastened to put his young shoulder under the trunk, a movement that only added to the stage-driver's distress."
"""I think we shall be good friends, Mr. Tisbett,"" said Jasper cordially, as he turned to wave his hand toward the little brown house; simultaneously the door opened, and all the young Peppers and Whitneys rushed out to help in the delightful unloading.It was well along in the afternoon. The dusk of the December twilight shut down speedily, around the little brown house and its happy occupants, but no one wanted the candles lighted till the last moment.""Some silly ones, and a good many wise ones,"" observed Mother Pepper, over in her little old rocker in the west window, where she used to sit sewing up coats and sacks for the village storekeeper. ""You kept us together many a time, Polly, when nothing else could.""""Polly was just lovely in those days,"" said Davie, coming across the room to lay a cool cheek against her rosy one. ""I liked the rainy days best when we all could stay in the house, and hear her sing and tell stories while she was working.""""And not over good in these,"" cried old Mr. King, ensconced in the snuggest corner in the seat of honor, the high-backed rocker that comforted Phronsie after her little toe was hurt. ""There, now, my boy, how's that?"" with a grim smile.""Oh! that was before we knew you,"" said Joel, ready in advance of any one else with the explanation; ""it wasn't this stove. Dr. Fisher gave Polly this one after she had the measles; but it was a lumbering old affair that was full of holes that had to be stopped up with anything we could get. And leather was the best; and Davie saved all the old boot-heels and tops he could find, you know.""""He is as good as gold,"" assented Mrs. Pepper heartily. ""You've done something, I'm sure, Polly. The medical books you bought out of your pocket money, and sent him, pleased him more than anything you could give him.""""You kept staring at the cupboard door all the evening, Joe, you know you did,"" cried Ben; ""you were just within a hair's breadth of letting the whole thing out ever so many times. Polly and I had to drag you away. We were glad enough when you went to bed, I can tell you.""""And those two,"" Joel went on, pointing to Polly and Ben, ""used to go whispering around a lot of old secrets, that they wouldn't tell us. Oh! it was perfectly awful, wasn't it, Dave?"" bestowing a small pinch on that individual's shoulder.""No, no, you're not going to talk yet,"" seeing Percy and Van beginning violent efforts to join in the conversation. ""Let the Peppers have a chance to talk over old times first. See how good Jasper is to wait.""""I would much prefer to hear the Peppers talk forever,"" said Jasper, smiling down on the two Whitneys, ""than to have the gates opened for a general flood. Go on, do, Polly and Ben, and the rest of you.""""Oh! there is so much,"" said Polly despairingly, clasping her hands, ""we shouldn't get through if we talked ten years, should we, Ben? Mamsie,"" and she rushed over to her, ""can we have a baking time to-morrow, just as we used to in the old days? Oh! do say yes."""
"""Well, when it comes to hearing a proposal for a baking frolic, my principles are thrown to the wind,"" said Jasper recklessly. ""Why, boys, that's the first thing I remember about the little brown house. Do say yes, Mrs. Pepper!""""Come in,"" cried Mr. King sociably. His night over at the parsonage had been a most fortunate experiment. ""I haven't slept so finely in ten years,"" he confided to Mrs. Whitney as they met at breakfast at the minister's table. So now, his face wreathed with smiles, he repeated his invitation. ""Come in, do, Mrs. Bascom; we're glad to see you.""Jasper, attired in one of Mrs. Pepper's long aprons, which was fastened in the style of the old days, by the strings around his neck, was busily engaged in rolling out under Polly's direction, a thin paste, expected presently under the genial warmth of the waiting stove, to evolve into most toothsome cakes. Ben was similarly attired, and similarly employed; while Joel and David were in a sticky state, preparing their dough after their own receipt, over at the corner table, their movements closely followed by the three Whitneys.Grandma Bascom was still reiterating ""I never,"" and going slowly from one group to another to inspect operations. When she came to Phronsie, she stopped short, raising her hands in surprise. ""Seems as ef 'twas only yesterday when the Peppers went away, though land knows I've missed 'em all most dretfully, 'an there sets that blessed child baking, as big as any of 'em. I never!""""I'll go over and get 'em,"" said Grandma; ""you come along with me,"" looking admiringly up at the tall boy; so the two, Joel laughing and hopping by her side as if he were five years younger, disappeared, well-pleased with each other.""Softly there, Dicky,"" said Mrs. Whitney, over in the window-seat with her fancy work; ""if Van gives up, you should thank him; I think he is very good to do it."" And the bigger boy's heart warmed with the radiant smile she sent him.Dick gave several vicious thrusts to his dough, and looked up at last to say very much against his will, ""Thank you,"" and adding brightly, ""but you know I'm getting big, sir, and you'd better give up.""""Put some more flour on the board,"" said Polly, running over to him. ""There, now see, Percy, if that doesn't roll smooth."" ""It does with you,"" said Percy, taking the rolling-pin again, to send it violently over the long-suffering dough, ""and--I declare, it's going to do with me,"" he cried, in delight at the large flat cake staring up at him from the board. ""Now, says I, I'll beat you, Jappy!"" And presently the whole kitchen resounded with a merry din, as the several cakes and biscuits were declared almost ready for their respective pans.""Not quite, Grandpapa,"" said Phronsie; ""this eye won't stay in just like the other. It doesn't look the same way, don't you see?"" pointing to the currant that certainly showed no inclination to do its duty, as any well-bred eye should. ""Wait just a moment, please; I'll pull it out and stick it in again.""Phronsie placed the boy within the pan, and gave it many a loving pat. ""Grandpapa sat here, and looked at it, and smiled,"" she said, turning her eyes gravely on Dick, ""and that helped ever so much. I couldn't ever have made it so nice alone. Good-by; now bake like a good boy. Let me put it in the oven all by myself, do, Polly,"" she begged."
"So Phronsie, the old gentleman escorting her in mortal dread that she would be burned, safely tucked her long pan into the warmest corner, shut the door, and gravely consulted the clock. ""If I look at it in twenty-one minutes, I think it will be done,"" she said, ""quite brown.""In twenty-one minutes the whole kitchen was as far removed from being the scene of a baking exploit as was possible. Everything was cleared away, and set up primly in its place, leaving only a row of fine little biscuits and cookies, with Phronsie's gingerbread boy in the midst, to tell the tale of what had been going on. Outside there was a great commotion.Deacon Brown's old wagon stood at the gate, for the Peppers and their friends; and, oh! joy, not the old horse between the shafts, but a newer and much livelier beast. And on the straw laid in the bottom of the wagon, the seats being removed, disported all the merry group, Mr. King alone having the dignity of a chair.Deacon Brown, delighted with his scheme of bringing the wagon over as a surprise for the Peppers to take a drive in, was on the side of the narrow foot-path, chuckling and rubbing his hands together. ""You won't have to drive so easy as you used to, Ben,"" he called out, ""this fellow's chirk; give him his head. Sho! what you goin' that way for?"" as Ben turned off down the lane.""He wanted to see Mr. Beebe,"" she managed to say, ""and dear Mrs. Beebe. Oh! don't go without him."" So Mr. King made them hand her up to him, and at the risk of their both rolling out, he held her in his lap until the wagon, stopping at the door of Grandma Bascom's cottage, brought Joel bounding out with a whoop.""Hurrah!"" screamed Joel. ""Good-by, Grandma,"" to the old lady, whose cap-frills were framed in the small window. ""I've had a fine time in there,"" he condescended to say, but nothing further as to the details could they extract from him; and so at last they gave it up, and lent their attention to the various things to be seen as the wagon spun along. And so over and through the town, and to the very door of the little shoe-shop, and there, to be sure, was Mr. Beebe the same as ever, to welcome them; and Joel found to his immense satisfaction that the stone pot was as full of sugary doughnuts as in the old days; and Phronsie had her pink and white sticks, and Mrs. Beebe ""Oh-ed"" and ""Ah-ed"" over them all, and couldn't bear to let them go when at last it was time to say ""good-by."" And at last they all climbed into the old wagon, and were off again on their round of visits.""Do you remember how you would carry the red-topped shoes home with you, Phronsie?"" cried Polly, and then away they rushed again into ""Oh, don't you remember this, and you haven't forgotten that?"" Jasper as wildly reminiscent now as the others, for hadn't he almost as good as lived at the little brown house, pray tell? So the Whitneys looked curiously on, without a chance to be heard in all the merry chatter; and then they drew up at the gate of the parsonage, where they were all to have supper.""O--oh!"" screamed Phronsie, her brown eyes flying wide open, ""do give me my shoes and stockings, Polly, do! I'll be dressed in just one--minute,"" and thereupon ensued a merry scramble as she tumbled out of the big bed, and commenced operations, Polly running out to help Mamsie get the breakfast."
"""No, you mustn't,"" cried Dick, bounding in in time to catch the last words. ""Mamma said no one was to have anything different, if we came to breakfast, from what the Peppers are going to eat. I like the yellow stuff; give me some, do,"" and he slid into a chair and passed his plate to Mrs. Pepper.""No, I'm not,"" said Dick, obstinately. ""The minister's wife said it was, and she asked me if I wouldn't have some, and I said I was going over to the Peppers to breakfast; I'd rather have some of theirs. And Grandpapa said it was good--the ham and fried eggs was--and he took it twice; he did, Mrs. Pepper.""""Hurry up, Percy,"" called Joel across the table, ""and don't dawdle so. We're going to make a double ripper, four yards long, to go down that hill there."" He laid down his spoon to point out the window at a distant snow-covered slope.""Oh! baked potatoes,"" cried Ben, rolling one around in his hand before he took off its crackling skin. ""Weren't they good, though, with a little salt. I tell you, they helped us to chop wood in the old times!"" ""Mamsie,"" cried Polly, suddenly, and resting her hands on her knees as she sat on the floor before the stove, ""do you suppose there is any one poor enough in Badgertown to need the little brown house when we lock it up to-morrow?"" ""Not a soul,"" replied Mrs. Pepper, quickly; ""no more than there was when we first locked it up five years ago, Polly. I've been all over that with the parson last evening; and he says there isn't a new family in the place, and all the old ones have their homes, the same as ever. So we can turn the key and leave it with a clear conscience.""""It's so perfectly lovely, Mamsie,"" she broke out at length, ""to see the dear old things, and to know that they are waiting here for us to come back whenever we want to. And to think it isn't wicked not to have them used, because everybody has all they need; oh! it's so delicious to think they can be left to themselves.""""That's it,"" said Polly, with a corresponding shake of her brown head, ""of course we couldn't live without Grandpapa; and just as 'of course' he couldn't leave his own dear home. He never would be happy, Phronsie, to do that.""Phronsie took a step or two into the sunshine lying on the middle of the old kitchen floor. ""Then I'd rather not come, Polly,"" she said. But she sighed and Polly was just about saying, ""We'll run down now and then perhaps, Phronsie, as we have done now,"" when the door was thrown open suddenly, and Joel burst in, his face as white as a sheet, and working fearfully.In the parsonage ""best room"" sat Mrs. Whitney. Her rocking-chair was none of the easiest, being a hair-cloth affair, its cushion very much elevated in the world just where it should have been depressed, so that one was in constant danger of slipping off its surface; moreover, the arms and back of the chair were covered with indescribable arrangements made and presented by loving parishioners and demanding unceasing attention from the occupant. But the chair was drawn up in the sunshine pouring into the window, and Mrs. Whitney's thoughts were sunny, too; for she smiled now and then as she drew her needle busily in and out through the bright wools.""How restful it all is here, and so quaint and simple."" She glanced up now to the high-backed mantel with its wealth of daguerreotypes, and surprising collection of dried leaves in tall china vases; and over the walls, adorned with pine-cone framed pictures, to the center table loaded with ""Annuals,"" and one or two volumes of English poetry, and then her gaze took in the little paths the winter sunshine was making for itself along the red and green ingrain carpet. ""I am so glad father thought to bring us all. Dear father, it is making a new man of him, this winter frolic. Why""--"
"She was looking out of the window now, and her hands fell to her lap as Polly Pepper came running breathlessly down the village street, her hood untied, and the coat grasped with one hand and held together across her breast. But it was the face that terrified Mrs. Whitney, and hurrying out of her chair, she ran out to the veranda as the girl rushed through the gateway.""Oh!"" at last, ""don't hate us for--bringing you to the--little--brown house. Why did we come!"" And convulsively she threw her young arms around the kind neck. ""Oh, Auntie! Dicky is hurt--but we don't know how much--his legs, Joel says, but it may not be as bad as we think; dear Auntie.""Mrs. Whitney trembled so that she could scarcely stand. Around them streamed the same winter sunshine that had been so bright a moment since. How long ago it seemed. And out of gathering clouds in her heart she was saying, ""Polly dear, God is good. We will trust him."" She did not know her own voice, nor realize when Polly led her mercifully within, as a farmer's wagon came slowly down the street, to stop at the parsonage gate; nor even when Dick was brought in, white and still, could she think of him as her boy. It was some other little figure, and she must go and help them care for him. Her boy would come bounding in presently, happy and ruddy, with a kiss for mamma, and a world of happy nonsense, just as usual. It was only when Mrs. Henderson came in, and took her hand to lead her into the next room, that it all came to her.And then came Dr. Fisher, and the truth was known. One of Dick's legs was broken below the knee; the other badly bruised. Only Jasper and the mother remained in the room while the little doctor set the limb; and after what seemed an age to the watchers, the boy came out.""Now I should like to know how all this happened,"" demanded Mr. King. The old gentleman had remained at the parsonage to get a good morning nap while the snow frolic was in progress. And he had been awakened by the unusual bustle below stairs in time to hear the welcome news that Dicky was all right since Dr. Fisher was taking care of him. He now presented himself in his dressing-gown, with his sleeping cap awry, over a face in which anger, distress and impatience strove for the mastery. ""Speak up, my boy,"" to Jasper, ""and tell us what you know about it.""""Indeed it was not,"" declared Ben stoutly; ""there was an ugly little gully that we hadn't seen under the snow. We'd been down four or five times all right, but only missed it by a hair-breadth; this time the ripper struck into it; I suppose Dick felt it bump, as it was on his side, and sang out, and as quick as lightning we were against that tree. It was as much my fault as any one's, and more, because I ought to have known that old hill thoroughly.""When Van was next seen he was with old Mr. King, and wearing all signs of having received his full share of comfort. Phronsie, just tying on her little hood, to go down to the parsonage to ask after Dicky, looked out of the window to exclaim in pleased surprise, ""Why, here comes dear Grandpapa,"" and then she rushed out to meet him."
"Phronsie shivered. ""But then, that's nothing,"" Mr. King hastened to add; ""I broke my own when I was a small shaver no bigger than Dick, and I was none the worse for it. Boys always have some such trifling mishaps, Phronsie.""""Yes, he did,"" said Phronsie, quite relieved to think that this trial could take the place of the usual leg-breaking episode in a boy's career. ""And so did Joel, and Davie--all of them, Grandpapa dear.""""But Jasper and Percy and Van don't have to work hard; oh! I don't want them to break their legs,"" said Phronsie, in a worried tone. ""You don't think they will, Grandpapa dear, do you? Please say they won't.""""I don't think there is the least danger of it,"" said Mr. King, ""especially as I shall put an end to this double-ripper business, though not because this upset was anybody's fault; remember that, Phronsie."" Van's head which had dropped a bit at the last words, came up proudly. ""Van, here, has acted nobly""--he put his hand on the boy's shoulder--""and would have saved Dicky if he could. It was a pure accident that nobody could help except by keeping off from the abominable thing. Well, here we are at the little brown house; and there's your mother, Phronsie, waiting for us in the doorway.""""That remains to be seen,"" said Mr. King slowly, and he took a long look at the winter sky, and the distant landscape before he ventured more. ""It very much looks as if we all should remain for a few days, to see how Dick is to get on, all but the four boys; they must pack off to school to-morrow, and then probably Mrs. Whitney will stay over with the boy till he can be moved. Dr. Fisher will do the right thing by him. Oh! everything is all right, Mrs. Pepper."" ""Good-by to the little brown house!"" Joel and David, Percy and Van sang out in doleful chorus, from the old stage coach; two of the boys on the seat shared by John Tisbett, the other two within as companions to Mrs. Pepper and Jasper, who were going home to start the quartette off to school.""Ben and I will take good care of everything, Mamsie,"" said Polly for the fiftieth time, and climbing up on the steps to tuck the traveling shawl closer. Thereupon Phronsie climbed up too, to do the same thing. ""Don't you worry; we'll take care of things,"" she echoed.""I shan't worry,"" said Mrs. Pepper in a bright assured way. ""Mother knows you'll both do just right. And Phronsie'll be a good girl too,"" with a long look into the bright eyes peering over the window casing of the old coach.""If that child wants to kiss her ma agen, she shall do it,"" declared Mr. Tisbett; and throwing down the reins, he sprang to the ground, seized Phronsie, and swung her lightly over the window edge. ""There you be--went through just like a bird."" And there she was, sure enough, in Mrs. Pepper's lap."
"""Oh, no, Phronsie!"" Mrs. Pepper made haste to whisper back. ""You must stay with Polly. Why, what would she ever do without you? Be mother's good girl, Phronsie; you're all coming home, except Auntie and Dick, in a few days.""""When I meet a man who can do such a kind thing, it is worth my while to say that I trust no words of mine gave offense. Bless you, man!"" added the old gentleman, abruptly changing the tone of his address as well as its form, ""it's my way; that's all.""""Get up, do!"" cried Joel, who had seized the reins, ""or I'll drive off without you, Mr. Tisbett,"" which had the effect to carry honest John briskly up to his place. When there, he took off his fur cap without a word, and bowed to Mr. King, cracked his whip and they were off, leaving the four on the little foot-path gazing after them, till the coach was only a speck in the distance.""It hasn't been long at all,"" said Dick promptly, and burrowing deeper into the chair-back; ""it's just flown, mamma. I like Polly and Phronsie; but I'd rather have you than any girl I know; I had really, mamma.""""Next week,"" said mamma, with happy eyes, ""he sails in the Servia. Next week, Dicky, my boy, we will see papa. And here is the best part of the secret. Listen; it has all been arranged that Mr. Duyckink shall live in Liverpool, so that papa will not have to go across any more, but he can stay at home with us. Oh, Dicky!""""Mr. Duyckink might not have felt as your father does, Dicky dear, about having his children educated at home; and Mrs. Duyckink wants to go to England; she hasn't any father, as I have, Dicky dear, who clings to the old home.""Mrs. Whitney ran to the old-fashioned looking-glass hanging in its pine-stained frame, between the low windows, and peered in. ""Do I look just as I did when papa went away six months ago, Dicky?"" she asked, anxiously.""Here's Dr. Fisher!"" shouted Dick suddenly. ""Now, you old fellow, you,"" and shaking his small fist at his lame leg, ""you've got to get well, I tell you. I won't wait much longer, sir!"" And as the doctor came in, ""I've a secret.""Her face gave no sign, but he sank back in his chair, feeling disgraced for life, and ready to keep quiet forever. And he was so good while Dr. Fisher was attending to his leg that when he was through, the little doctor turned to him approvingly: ""Well, sir, I think that I can promise that you can go home Saturday. You've improved beyond my expectation."""
"""I'm glad,"" mumbled Dick, in a forlorn little voice, and till after the door closed on the retreating form of the doctor, it was all that could be gotten out of him. Then he turned and put out both arms to his mother.""Mamma feels quite sure of that,"" said Mrs. Whitney gently. ""You are right, Dicky, in feeling sorry and ashamed, because anything given to you to keep is not your own but belongs to another; but, my boy, the next duty is to keep back those tears--all this is hurting your leg.""Dick struggled manfully, but still the tears rolled down his cheeks. At last he said, raising his head, ""You would much better let me have my cry out, mamma; it's half-way, and it hurts to send it back.""""Well, I don't think so,"" said Mrs. Whitney, with a laugh. ""I've often wanted to have a cry out, as you call it. But that's weak, Dicky, and should be stopped, for the more one cries, the more one wants to.""""You've often wanted to have a cry out?"" repeated Dick, in such amazement that every tear just getting ready to show itself immediately rushed back again. ""Why, you haven't anything to cry for, mamma.""But although there were three letters from home, none of them carried the news of what was going on there. None of them breathed a syllable that Cousin Eunice Chatterton was ill with a low fever, aggravated by nervous prostration; and that Mrs. Pepper and Polly were having a pretty hard time of it. On the contrary, every bit of news was of the cheeriest nature; Jasper tucked on a postscript to his father's letter, in which he gave the latest bulletin of his school life. And Polly did the same thing to Ben's letter. Even Phronsie went into a long detail concerning the new developments of a wonderful kitten she had left at home, to take her visit to Badgertown, so the two recipients never missed the lack of information in regard to the household life, from which they were shut out.Only once Mrs. Whitney said thoughtfully, as she folded her letter and slipped it back into its envelope, ""They don't speak of Mrs. Chatterton. I presume she has changed her plans, and is going to remain longer at her nephew's.""""I am so faint I do not know that I can take any,"" said Mrs. Chatterton. Whether it was her white cashmere dressing-robe, and her delicate lace cap that made her face against the pillows seem wan and white, Polly did not know. But it struck her that she looked more ill than usual, and she said earnestly, ""I am so sorry I wasn't quicker.""And indeed Polly knew that it would be small use to summon one of them, as Martha, the most obliging, had airily tossed her head when asked to do some little service for the sick woman that very morning, declaring, ""I will never lift another finger for that Madame Chatterton.""For one long instant, Polly hesitated; then she turned to rush from the room, a flood of angry, bitter feelings surging through her heart, more at the insufferable tone and manner, than at what she was bidden to do. Only turned; and she was back by the side of the bed, and looking down into the fretful, dictatorial old face.Polly's eyes flashed, and the hand holding the sponge trembled. Nothing but the fear of troubling Mamsie, and dear old Mr. King whose forbearance was worn to the finest of threads, kept her at her post.Without a word Polly returned, and bringing the right vial set about its use as directed, in a rapidly growing dismay at the evil feelings surging through her, warning her it would not be safe to stay in the room much longer.""Do you understand,"" presently began Mrs. Chatterton, fastening her cold blue eyes upon her, ""what your position is in this house? Everybody else appears to be blind and idiotic to the last degree; you seem to have a little quickness to catch an idea."""
"""DEAR Mr. King!"" echoed Mrs. Chatterton, in shrill disdain. ""Stuff and nonsense,"" and she put her head back for an unpleasant cackle; it could hardly be called a laugh. ""What an idiot the man is to have the wool pulled over his eyes in this fashion. I'll tell you, Polly""--and she raised herself up on her elbow, the soft lace falling away from the white, and yet shapely arm. This member had been one of her strongest claims to beauty, and even in her rage, Mrs. Chatterton paused a second to glance complacently at it in its new position--""you are, when all is said about your dear Mr. King, and your absurd assumption of equality with refined people who frequent this house, exactly the same underbred country girl as you were in your old brown house, goodness knows wherever that is.""""I'm glad I am,"" declared Polly. And she actually laughed merrily, while she squared her sturdy shoulders. Nothing could be sweeter than to hear it said she was worthy of the dear little old brown house, and didn't disgrace Mamsie's bringing up.The laugh was the last feather that overthrew Mrs. Chatterton's restraint. She was actually furious now that she, widow of Algernon Chatterton, who was own cousin to Jasper Horatio King, should be faced by such presumption, and her words put aside with girlish amusement.Polly Pepper, the girlish gladness gone from heart and face, waited for no more. ""OUR MOTHER!"" she cried stormily, unable to utter another word--""oh--oh!"" Her breath came in quick, short gasps, the hot indignant blood mounting to the brown waves of hair on her brow, while she clasped her hands so tightly together, the pain at any other time would have made her scream.Mrs. Chatterton, aghast at the effect of her words, leaned back once more against her pillows. ""Don't try to work up a scene,"" she endeavored to say carelessly. But she might as well have remonstrated with the north wind. The little country maiden had a temper as well as her own, and all the more for its long restraint, now on breaking bounds, it rushed at the one who had provoked it, utterly regardless that it was the great Mrs. Algernon Chatterton.For two minutes, so breathlessly did Polly hurl the stinging sentences at the figure on the bed, Cousin Eunice was obliged to let her have her own way. Then as suddenly, the torrent ceased. Polly grew quite white. ""What have I done--oh! what have I done?"" she cried, and rushed out of the room.""Polly--Polly!"" called Jasper's voice below. She knew he wanted her to try a new duet he had gone down town to purchase; but how could she play with such a storm in her heart? and, worse than all else, was the consciousness that she had spoken to one whose gray hairs should have made her forget the provocation received, words that now plunged her into a hot shame to recall."
"She flew over the stairs--up, away from every one's sight, to a long, dark lumber room, partially filled with trunks, and a few articles of furniture, prized as heirlooms, but no longer admissible in the family apartments. Polly closed the door behind her, and sank down in the shadow of a packing box half filled with old pictures, in a distress that would not even let her think. She covered her face with her hands, too angry with herself to cry; too aghast at the mischief she had done, to even remember the dreadful words Mrs. Chatterton had said to her.""For of course, now she will complain to Mamsie, and I'm really afraid Mr. King will find it out; and it only needs a little thing to make him send her off. He said yesterday Dr. Valentine told him there was nothing really the matter with her--and--dear! I don't know what will happen.""To poor Polly, crouching there on the floor in the dim and dusty corner, it seemed as if her wretchedness held no hope. Turn whichever way she might, the dreadful words she had uttered rang through her heart. They could not be unsaid; they were never to be forgotten but must always stay and rankle there.""Oh--oh!"" she moaned, clasping her knees with distressed little palms, and swaying back and forth, ""why didn't I remember what Mamsie has always told us--that no insult can do us harm if only we do not say or do anything in return. Why--why couldn't I have remembered it?""How long she stayed there she never knew. But at last, realizing that every moment there was only making matters worse, she dragged herself up from the little heap on the floor, and trying to put a bit of cheerfulness into a face she knew must frighten Mamsie, she went slowly out, and down the stairs.But no one looked long enough at her face to notice its change of expression. Polly, the moment she turned towards the household life again, could feel that the air was charged with some intense excitement. Hortense met her on the lower stairs; the maid was startled out of her usual nonchalance, and was actually in a hurry.Polly clung to the stair-railing, her face whitening, and her gaze fastened upon Mrs. Chatterton's door, where Hortense was now disappearing. Inside, was a sound of voices, and that subdued stir that gives token of a sick room.""I have killed her!"" cried Polly's heart. For one wild moment she was impelled to flight; anywhere, she did not care where, to shake off by motion in the free air this paralysis of fear. But the next she started and, rushing down the stairs and into Mr. King's room, cried out, ""Oh! dear Grandpapa, will Mrs. Chatterton die?""""Bless me! where have you been, Polly Pepper,"" said Mr. King, settling his eyeglass to regard her closely, ""not to hear the uproar in this house? Yes, Mrs. Chatterton received a telegram a half-hour since that her nephew, the only one that she was very fond of among her relatives, was drowned at sea, and she has been perfectly prostrated by it, till she really is quite ill.""""Where have you been, Polly?"" cried Jasper, coming out of a side passage in time to catch a dissolving view of her flying figure. ""Polly--Polly!"" and he took three steps to her one, and gained her side."
"""Who--Mrs. Chatterton?"" said the boy, opening his dark eyes; ""why, you couldn't have said cruel things to her, Polly. Don't be foolish, child."" He spoke as he would to Phronsie's terror, and smiled into her face. But it did not reassure Polly.""There are ever so many people up there now,"" said Jasper. ""Your mother, and Hortense, and two or three maids. What in the world could you do, Polly? Come down into the library, and tell us all about it.""Mrs. Pepper was busy with the doctor in the further part of the room, and Polly stood quite still for a moment, wishing she were one of the maids, to whom a bit of active service was given. She could not longer endure her thoughts in silence, and gently going up to her mother's side, with a timorous glance at the bed, as she passed it, she begged, ""Mamsie, can't I do something for her?""Polly seized the bit of paper from Dr. Valentine's hand, and hurried out. Again she glanced fearfully at the bed, but the curtain on that side was drawn so that only the outline of the figure could be seen. She was soon out on the street, the movement through the fresh air bringing back a little color to her cheek and courage to her heart. Things did not seem quite so bad if she only might do something for the poor sick woman that could atone for the wretched work she had done; at least it would be some comfort if the invalid could be helped by her service.""You little idiot!"" cried Alexia, thoroughly out of temper. But as this produced no effect on Polly, she began to wheedle and coax. ""Now, Polly, do be reasonable. You know we can't go without you; you wouldn't spoil the whole thing; you know you wouldn't. I shall just tell the Cornwalls that you are coming,"" and she turned off to the corner of the avenue.So Polly had nothing to do but to sit out in the hall, and listen and watch all the movements in the sick room, every one of which but increased her terror. At least she could bear it no longer, and as Dr. Valentine came out, putting on his gloves, she rushed after him.""Die? no indeed, I hope not,"" said Dr. Valentine. ""She has had a severe shock to her nerves and her age is against her, but she is coming around all right, I trust. Why, Polly, I thought better things of you, my girl."" He glanced down into the distressed face with professional disfavor.""It will be tiresome work,"" said Dr. Valentine, ""but it will be a piece of real charity, and perhaps, Polly, it's as well for you to begin now as to wait till you can belong to forty charity clubs, and spend your time going to committee meetings."" And he laughed not altogether pleasantly. How was Polly to know that Mrs. Valentine was immersed up to her ears in a philanthropic sea with the smallest possible thought for the doctor's home? ""Now that maid,"" said the physician, dropping his tone to a confidential one, ""is as well as the average, but she's not the one who is to amuse the old lady. It's that she needs more than medicine, Polly. She actually requires diversion."""
"""She is suffering for the companionship of some bright young nature,"" Dr. Valentine proceeded, attributing the dismay written all over the girl's face to natural unwillingness to do the service. ""After she gets over this attack she needs to be read to for one thing; to be told the news; to be made to forget herself. But of course, Polly,"" he said hastily, buttoning his top coat, and opening the outer door, ""it's too much to ask of you; so think no more about it, child."" It was Saturday morning, and Polly ran upstairs with a bright face, the morning Journal in her hand. ""I'm going to stay with Mrs. Chatterton, Hortense,"" she announced to that functionary in the dressing-room.""And a comfairte may it gif to you,"" said Hortense, with a vicious shake of the silk wrapper in her hand, before hanging it in its place. ""Madame has the tres diablerie, cross as de two steeks, what you call it, dis morning.""Polly went softly into the room, closing the door gently after her. In the shadow of one corner of the large apartment, sat Mrs. Chatterton under many wrappings in the depths of an invalid's chair. Polly went up to her side.Mrs. Chatterton turned her head and looked at her. ""No,"" she was about to say shortly, just as she had repulsed many little offers of Polly's for the past few days; but somehow this morning the crackling of the fresh sheet in the girl's hand, suggestive of crisp bits of gossip, was too much for her to hear indifferently, especially as she was in a worse state of mind than usual over Hortense and her bad temper.""You may sit down and read a little, if you like,"" she said ungraciously. So Polly, happy as a queen at the permission, slipped into a convenient chair, and began at once. She happened fortunately on just the right things for the hungry ears; a description of a large church wedding, the day before; two or three bits about society people that Mrs. Chatterton had lost sight of, and a few other items just as acceptable.""What is it?"" asked Phronsie, from the depths of a big arm-chair, and looking up from her book. Then she saw as soon as she had asked the question that Polly was in trouble, so she laid down her book, and slid out of the chair. ""What is it, Polly? Let me help you, do.""""Why, the Town Talk--that hateful old society thing,"" said Polly, throwing the papers to right and left. ""You know, Phronsie; it has a picture of a bottle of ink, and a big quill for a heading. O dear! do help me, child, for she will get nervous if I am gone long.""""He said it was big, and he asked Grandpapa if he might have it, and Grandpapa said, Yes. I don't know what he wanted it for,"" said Phronsie. ""And he took other newspapers, too, Polly; oh! ever so many.""""Oh! I am so glad you are here,"" she exclaimed as ""Come in!"" greeted her, and both Phronsie and she precipitated themselves with no show of ceremony, in front of his study table. ""O Jasper! could you get me a copy of ""Town Talk?"" Jack Rutherford has gone off with ours."""
"Polly went out, and sat down in one of the big oaken chairs in the hall to seize it as it came, and Phronsie deposited herself in an opposite chair, and watched Polly. And presently in came Jasper, waving the desired journal. Polly, with a beaming face, grasped it and rushed off upstairs.""Polly,"" called the boy, looking after her, ""it isn't too late now for you to go with them. Lucy Bennett met me at the corner and she said they will take the twelve o'clock train, instead of the eleven, and she wanted me to beg you to come.""""No, no,"" tossed back Polly, rushing on, ""I am quite determined to stay at home."" Then she went into Mrs. Chatterton's room, and closed the door. But she couldn't so easily shut out the longings that would rise in her heart for the Saturday outing that the other girls were to have. How lovely it would be! the run out to Silvia Horne's charming house some ten miles distant; the elegant luncheon they would have, followed by games, and a dance in the ball-room upstairs, that Silvia's older sisters used for their beautiful parties. Then the merry return before dusk, of the twelve girls, all capital friends at school! Oh--oh!Polly sat down, and resolutely plunged into the column where the news items promised the most plentiful yield but in between the lines ran the doings of the girls: how they were all assembling by this time at Lucy Bennett's; how they were hurrying off to the train, and all the other delightful movements of the ""outing"" flashed before her eyes, as she finished item after item of her dreary task. But how Mrs. Chatterton gloated over it!At last Polly, feeling as if she could not endure another five minutes of it, glanced up to see the old lady's eyes actually sparkling; her mouth had fallen into contented curves, and the jeweled hand resting on the chair-arm was playing with the fringe, while she leaned forward that she might not lose a word.""Read that again, Polly,"" she said, ""the list of presents exhibited at Arabella Granger's wedding. I didn't hear any mention of the Archibalds. It can't be that they have fallen out; and read more slowly.""So Polly began once more the long lists of gifts that ushered in the matrimonial happiness of Mrs. John Westover nee Miss Arabella Granger; this time, however, stimulated by the pleasure she was giving, to find it an endurable task.It seemed to Polly as if Mrs. John Westover had everything on earth given to her that could possibly be presented at a wedding; nevertheless the list was gone through again bravely, Polly retracing her steps two or three times to read the items over for her listener's slow digestion.""The Archibalds are not mentioned, either as being there or sending a gift, nor the Harlands, nor the Smythes, so I am very glad I didn't remember her,"" said Mrs. Chatterton, drawing herself up with a relieved sigh. ""Those presents sound fine on paper, but it isn't as well as she might have done if she had made a different match. Now something else, Polly,"" and she dismissed Mrs. Westover with a careless wave of her hand. Polly flew off into the fashion hints, and was immediately lost in the whirl of coming toilets. No one noticed when the door opened, so of course no one saw Mrs. Whitney standing smiling behind the old lady's big chair.""Dear child,"" said Mrs. Whitney, as much a girl for the moment as Polly herself. And pressing kisses on the red lips, while she folded her close--""Yes, Dick is at home. There, go and find him; he is in Mrs. Pepper's room.""""Oh, yes, Marian; I am better,"" said Mrs. Chatterton, looking around for Polly, then down at the delicious Town Talk carelessly thrown on the floor. ""Will you send her back as soon as possible?"" she asked with her old imperativeness."
"""You don't know what has been read,"" said Mrs. Chatterton as Mrs. Whitney drew up a chair and sat down, running her eye in a practiced way over the front page. ""Dear me, it makes me quite nervous, Marian, to see you prowling around all over the sheet that way.""""Oh! I shall find something interesting quite soon, I fancy,"" said Mrs. Whitney cheerfully, her heart on her boy and the jolly home-coming he was having. ""Here is the Washington news; I mean all about the receptions and teas.""""I don't care about that,"" said Mrs. Chatterton quickly, ""and besides, quite likely there'll be a complete revolution before spring really sets in, and gray stuffs will go out. Find some description of tea gowns, can't you? I must have one or two more.""""I'm sure I never noticed,"" said Mrs. Chatterton indifferently. ""Hortense always arranges my hair better without lace. If you can't find what I ask you, Marian,"" raising her voice to a higher key, ""you needn't trouble to read at all.""Fortunately the description of the gown worn by Lady Hartly Cavendish at a London high tea, stood out in bold relief, as Mrs. Whitney's eyes nervously ran over the columns again, and she seized upon it.""You did."" Marian's tone did not lose a note of its ordinary gentleness. ""But I shall ask her if she is willing to do it as a favor, Mrs. Chatterton; you quite understand that, of course?"" She, too, leaned forward in her chair, and gazed into the cold, hard face.Mrs. Whitney bit her pretty lips and slipped out of her chair, just pausing a moment to lay her hand on the young shoulder as she passed, and a world of comfort fell upon Polly, shut in once more to her dreary task.""How perfectly splendid that I didn't go to Silvia Home's luncheon party now!"" cried Polly's heart over and over between the lines. ""If I had, I should have missed dear Auntie's home-coming, and Dicky's."" She glanced up with luminous eyes as she whirled the sheet. Mrs. Chatterton, astonishing as it may seem, was actually smiling.Outside, Dick was holding high revel as every one revolved around him, the hero of the coasting accident, till the boy ran considerable danger from all the attention he was receiving. But one glance and a smile from Mrs. Whitney brought him back to himself.""Really, Marian,"" said her father, whose hand had scarcely ceased patting Dick's brown head since the boy's home-coming, ""you've grown young in Badgertown. I never saw you look so well as you do to-day.""A shout of joy greeted her announcement. Polly, off in her prison, could hear the merry sounds, and her happy heart echoed them. The misery of the past week, when she had been bearing an unatoned fault, seemed to drop away from her as she listened, and to say, ""Life holds sunshine yet.""""I must say, Polly Pepper,"" cried Mrs. Chatterton with rising anger, ""you are the most disagreeable girl that I ever had the misfortune to meet. I, for one, will not put up with your constant ebullitions of temper. Go out of this room!"""
"Polly rose slowly and drew herself up with something so new in face and manner that the old lady instinctively put up her eyeglass and gazed curiously through it, as one would look at a strange animal.""Pretty doings these!"" Mr. King, by a dexterous movement, succeeded in slipping back of the portiere folds into the little writing-room, as Polly rushed out through the other doorway into the hall. ""A fortunate thing it was that I left Dick, to see what had become of Polly. Now, Cousin Eunice, you move from my house!"" and descending the stairs, he called determinedly, ""Polly, Polly, child!""""Now, I should just like to inquire,"" began Mr. King, taking her by her two young shoulders and looking down into the flushed face, ""what she has been saying to you."" ""Oh, Grandpapa!"" down went Polly's brown head, ""don't make me tell. Please don't, Grandpapa.""""Oh, Grandpapa!"" exclaimed Polly, in great distress, and raising the brown eyes--he was dismayed to find them filling with tears--""don't, don't send her away! It is all my fault; indeed it is, Grandpapa!""""Mother Pepper? No, indeed; the last person in the world I wish to see,"" cried her father irritably. ""The bunch of Pepper children, I want, and at once; see that they all report to me directly."" With that he redoubled his efforts and was soon at the top of the long oaken steps.""Yes, yes,"" said Mr. King nervously, and turning away from some papers he was fumbling to occupy the waiting moments. ""Well, do sit down, all of you. I sent for you to have a talk about something that you--that you--well, do sit down.""""If it's good news,"" he said abruptly, ""please let us have it right this minute. But if it's bad, why,"" a gathering alarm stole over his chubby countenance, as he scanned the face before him, ""I'm going out-doors.""""It's good or bad news according as you take it,"" said the old gentleman. ""It ought to be good. But there,"" pushing back his chair to look at the row of anxious figures the other side of the table, ""do sit down with the rest, Joe, and stop staring me out of countenance.""""Hum! well, children, now you are all remarkably sensible boys and girls. Remarkably sensible. I've always said so, and I see no reason to change my opinion of you now. And so, although at first my news may not be quite to your liking, why, you'll quickly make it so, and be very happy about it in the end. Hem! well, did you ever think that--that your mother might possibly marry again?"""
"The last words were brought out so abruptly, that to the five pairs of ears strained to catch their import, it seemed as if the news had shot by harmlessly. But after a breathing space the dreadful ""marry,"" and ""your mother,"" came back to them, bringing the several owners of the ears out of their chairs at one bound.Phronsie clasped her hands in silent terror, and raised big eyes to his face. David began to walk helplessly down the apartment. ""See here!"" said Joel, turning to the others, ""wait a minute, and hold on. Perhaps it's you, sir,"" whirling back to question, with piercing eyes, the old gentleman, ""who's going to marry our mother. Then it's all right!""""Don't--oh! don't,"" they cried, and a common trouble overwhelming them, they rushed around the table, seized his hands, and patted his shoulders and hair. ""Oh! this is very dreadful,"" gasped Polly, ""but don't you feel badly, dear, dear Grandpapa.""""I should think it was,"" said Mr. King. ""Phronsie, here, child, get into my lap. I'll come to myself then. There, now, that's something like,"" as Phronsie, with a low cry, hopped into her usual nest. ""Now perhaps I can communicate the rest of my news, when I get my breath.""The Peppers held theirs, and he began once more. ""Now, children, it isn't in the course of nature for such a fine bright woman as your mother to remain single the rest of her life; somebody would be sure to come and carry her off. I'm glad it's to be in my lifetime, for now I can be easy in my mind, and feel that you have a protector when I am gone. There, there, we won't talk about that,"" as the young faces turned dark with sudden pain, while Joel rushed convulsively to the window, ""you can see how I feel about it.""""Yes, I am,"" said the old gentleman, ""and it won't alter the existing state of things, for he will live here with us, and things will be just the same, if only you children will take it rightly. But I've no doubt you will in the end; no doubt at all,"" he added, brightening up, ""for you are very sensible young people. I've always said so.""""Who is he?"" The dreadful question trembled on all the lips; but no one asked it. Seeing this, Mr. King broke out, ""Well, now of course you want to know who is going to marry your mother, that is, if you are willing. For she won't have him unless you are to be happy about it. Would you like Dr. Fisher for a father?""""Why didn't you tell us before that it was he?"" sobbed Polly, with joyful tears running over her face. Davie, coming out of his gloomy walk, turned a happy face towards the old man's chair, while Ben said something to himself that sounded like ""Thank God!"""
"""Listen, Phronsie,"" and Mr. King took both her hands in his, ""and I'll tell you about it so that you will understand. Dr. Fisher loves your mother; he has loved her for many years--all those years when she was struggling on in the little brown house. But he couldn't tell her so, because he had others depending on him for support. They don't need him now, and as soon as he is free, he comes and tells your mother and me, like a noble good man as he is, all about it. He's a gentleman, children,"" he declared, turning to the others, ""and you will be glad to call him father.""""O dear, dear! get a glass of water, Polly,"" cried Mr. King. ""One of you run and open the window. Phronsie, Phronsie--there, child, look up and let me tell you."" But Phronsie burrowed yet deeper in the protecting nest, regardless of his spotless linen.""Bless your heart, you'll have Mamsie more than ever,"" cried Mr. King heartily. ""Here, you children, tell her. Polly, we don't want the water now, she's come to,"" as Polly came rushing in with a glassful. ""Make her understand; I can't.""""Really and truly I am so glad I don't know what to do,"" said Polly, kneeling down by the chair-side. ""Don't you see we are so much the richer, Phronsie? We have lost nothing, and we gain Dr. Fisher. Dear splendid Dr. Fisher!""""And for your new eyes,"" sang Phronsie in a pleased way. ""Oh, Polly!"" She jumped out of the old gentleman's lap, and began to dance around the room, softly clapping her hands and exclaiming, ""Oh, Polly!""""Well, now, children,"" said Mr. King, as the excitement ran low, ""you just run and tell your mother, every one of you, how happy she will make you by bringing Dr. Fisher here as your father. Scamper, now!""No need to urge them. On the wings of the wind ran the five Peppers up into Mamsie's own room. Mrs. Pepper for once turning aside from the claim of her pressing duties, was standing by the work table. Here stood the mending basket before her, piled to the brim with the weekly installment of stockings big and little, clamoring for attention. But the usually busy needle lay idle, and the busier hands were folded, as the mother-heart went over the words she knew were being rehearsed downstairs by the kind friend who had made a home for them. He was pleading her cause with her children."
"""Bless your dear heart!"" cried Mother Pepper, clasping her tightly, ""and you children, all of you,"" and she drew them all within her arms. ""Now I want you to understand, once for all, that it isn't to be unless you all wish it. You are sure Mr. King hasn't persuaded you to like it?""""Whew!"" cried Jasper, ""that is a piece of news all in one breath. Well, Mrs. Pepper, I'm glad of it, too. I congratulate you."" With that, he marched up to her, Phronsie hanging to his arm, and shook her hand heartily.""I suppose not,"" said Pickering carelessly, and striding after, ""so I'll whisper my gentle congratulations in your ear 'on the wing.' But I'm awfully sorry for you, Ben,"" he added, as he came up to him.Pickering laughed. ""I'm caught in the very act. Now, Ben, remember I'm your friend when you get into trouble with your dear pa. Good-by, Uncle,"" with a bright nod, and a lazy shake of his long figure. ""Trade always demoralizes me. I'll get back to my books,"" and he vanished as quickly as he came.""Back to your books,"" said his uncle grimly, ""hum, I wish you would. See here, Ben,"" he put a controlling hand on the boy's shoulder, ""one word with you,"" marching him into the private office of the firm. ""Don't you follow Pickering too closely, my boy,"" he said abruptly; ""he's a good lad in the main, but if he is my nephew, I must give you warning. He's losing ground.""""It's a fact. Master Nelson says he could be first scholar in the grammar, but for the last six months he's failed steadily. There's no particular reason, only ambition's gone. And when you say that, you mean there's a general collapse of all my hopes concerning him.""""It isn't a pull now and then that gets a man up hill,"" observed Mr. Cabot, leaning back in his revolving chair to look into the blue eyes, ""that you know as well as I. Now, Ben, I'm not going to see you throw away your prospects, too. Don't let him influence you in the wrong way. He's bright and attractive, but don't pay attention to his ridicule of good things.""""You'll do, then,"" said Mr. Cabot, bringing his palm down on a pile of unread letters awaiting him. ""Go ahead. I don't promise anything, but I will say this. If you work on as you have done these two years since you came in here as errand boy, Ben, I'll make you a power in the house. Understand I don't expect you to do brilliant things; that isn't in your line. You will be a success only as a steady, faithful worker. But keep at it, and hang on to Cabot & Van Meter, and we'll hang on to you."""
"The little man peered at her anxiously through his big glasses, and he looked so exactly as he did on that morning so long ago when Polly's eyes were at their worst, that she could do nothing but gaze speechlessly into his face.She threw her young arms around him. ""Papa Fisher--for you are almost my father now--I am the very, very happiest girl because you are going to live here, and now I can show you just how much I really and truly love you.""The little man beamed at her. Then he took off his spectacles, wiped them, and clapped them into place again. ""You see, Polly,"" he said deliberately, ""it was impossible to see your mother and not love her. She has had--well, there, child, I cannot bear to talk about it,"" and he walked to the window, blew his nose violently on an immense pocket-handkerchief, leaving the words poised in mid-air.""It was the greatest trial of my life that I couldn't show her then when she was struggling so bravely to keep the wolf from the door, how I felt. But my hands were tied, child,"" he added, coming back, his usual self again. ""Now I can make her, she says, happy, that is, if you children like it. Just think, Polly, she said happy! It's stupendous, but she said so, Polly, she really did!""""Oh! that's not many,"" said Polly; ""sixty-five is the very smallest number that we could manage. We've been over the list ever so many times, and struck out quantities of names. You see, everybody loves Mamsie, and they'll want to see her married.""But they went on merrily nevertheless. All over the old stone mansion there were hints of the on-coming festivities; and though all signs of it were tucked away from the little doctor on his occasional visits, the smothered excitement flamed afresh immediately his departure became an assured thing. Everybody had the wildest plans for the occasion; it appearing impossible to do enough for the one who had stood at the helm for five long years, and who was to be reigning housekeeper for as much longer as her services were needed.""It will be much better to have everything plain,"" said Polly, communing with herself, as she turned on her pillow. ""Mamsie has always been without show, of any kind, and so,"" but here Polly's heart stood still. Dearly she loved the bright, conspicuous accompaniments to the wedding whereby Mr. King was determined to show his respect for the family under his care. And her soul secretly longed for the five hundred guests named on a list of the old gentleman's drawing up. And the feast and the lights, and the pretty dresses, and the dancing party for the young people to follow. For Mr. King had announced himself as about to usher in the brightest of days for the young Peppers to remember.""Nonsense! our happiness doesn't depend upon a lot of people coming together to help it along. Mamsie's face, whenever Grandpapa plans all this magnificence, is enough to make me feel wretched at the thought of it. Dear Mamsie! she's afraid of ingratitude if she doesn't try to like it. She shall have the little morning wedding with a few people around, and the gray silk gown instead of the lavender one Grandpapa wants her to wear, for Mamsie always knows just what is right."""
"""No doubt Mrs. Pepper finds it a little hard to adjust her ideas to the large affair,"" said the old gentleman, considerably disturbed, and by no means relinquishing the bell-cord, ""but it is due to you children to have a bright time, and I must see that you all have it. That is my affair,"" and this time the cord was pulled, and the bell rang a loud, insistent message.""Stuff and nonsense!"" exclaimed Mr. King sharply, for his surprise was too great to allow of composure, ""who has been putting this idea into your head? Your mother couldn't have done it, for she promised it should all be as you young people wanted.""""Mamsie never said a word,"" cried Polly, recovering herself as she saw a chance to make things right for Mother Pepper; ""it all came to me, Grandpapa, all alone by myself. Oh! I hate the big display!"" she declared with sudden vehemence, astonishing herself with the repulsion that now seized her.""Grandpapa,"" cried Polly, with a sudden rush of tears, ""forgive me, do; I did not mean to be so naughty. I did not, dear Grandpapa."" She looked like Phronsie now, and the old gentleman's heart melted. ""But I am quite sure that none of us children would be a bit happy not to have it as Mamsie would like.""""But how about Joel and Phronsie?"" interrupted Mr. King, utterly ignoring Davie's claims to be heard. ""Ah! Polly, my dear, until you tell me that they will prefer to give up the fine party, you mustn't expect me to pay any attention to what you say. It's due to Phronsie that your mother's wedding is a thing worthy to remember as a fine affair.""""All right if they do,"" said Mr. King easily, ""but unless you come and tell me it is their own choice, why, I shall just go on with my plans as mapped out,"" he added obstinately. ""Thomas,"" as that functionary appeared in the doorway, ""take the letters to the post at once; you will find them on my writing table.""""What's up?"" cried Joel with curiosity; ""some more mysteries? There's nothing but whisperings, and secrets, and no end of jolly understandings, ever since Mamsie commenced to marry Dr. Fisher. Go ahead, I'll come.""""What in the world are you firing at?"" demanded the boy, visions of certain pranks at school unpleasantly before him. ""Don't shoot over my head, Polly, but keep somewhere near your mark,"" he advised irritably.""I don't want to dance,"" said Phronsie, standing quite still in the middle of the room. The morning sun shone across her yellow hair, but no light came into the large eyes. ""Polly wants something, first; what is it, Joel?"""
"""Now that's what I call mean,"" cried Joel in a loud, vindictive tone back of Polly, ""to work on Phronsie's feelings. You can't make me say I don't want Mamsie to have a wedding splurge, so there, Polly Pepper!""""Mamsie doesn't want any of us to give up anything unless we do it as if we were glad to,"" said Polly. For her life, she couldn't conceal a little scornful note in her voice, and Joel winced miserably.""Oh! oh! oh!"" cried Polly, and seizing his arm, she led off in a dance, so much surpassing his efforts, that Phronsie screamed with delight to see them go. When they could dance no more, Polly, flushed and panting, ran out of the room, leaving the two to find out as best they might, the cause of the strange demeanor.Mamsie's wedding-day! At last it came! Was any other ever so bright and beautiful? Phronsie thought not, and thereupon she impeded the preparations by running up to kiss her mother every few moments, until such time as Felicie carried her off to induct her into a white muslin gown. Polly, here, there, and everywhere, was in such a rapture that she seemed to float on wings, while the boys of the household, with the exception of Jasper, lost their heads early in the day, and helplessly succumbed to all demands upon them.Every flower had to be put in place by the young people. Old Turner for once stood one side. And Polly must put the white satin boxes filled with wedding cake on the little table where one of the waiters would hand them to departing guests. And Phronsie must fasten Mamsie's pearl broach--the gift of the five little Peppers--in her lace collar the very last thing. And Jasper collected the rice and set the basket holding it safely away from Joel's eager fingers till such time as they could shower the bride's carriage. And all the boys were ushers, even little Dick coming up grandly to offer his arm to the tallest guest as it happened.And old Mr. King gave the bride away! And Dr. Fisher at the last forgot all the one hundred and thirty eyes, and his ""I will,"" rang out like a man's who has secured what he has long wanted. And ever so many of the guests said ""What a good father he will make the children,"" and several attempted to tell the Peppers so. ""As if we didn't know it before,"" said Joel indignantly.And Alexia and all the other girls of Polly's set were there, and Joel's little blue and white creature came, to his great satisfaction, with her aunt, who was quite intimate in the family; and Pickering Dodge was there of course, and the Alstynes, and hosts of others.And Mother Pepper in her silver-gray gown and bonnet, by the side of her husband, with Phronsie clinging to one hand, heard nothing but heart-felt wishes for her happiness and that of the five little Peppers.And there was not so much as the shadow of a skeleton at the wedding breakfast. And Cousin Mason Whitney took charge of the toasts--and everybody felt that just the right things had been said. And then there was a flutter of departure of the bridal party, and in the rattle of the wheels Phronsie piped out bravely as she threw the slipper after the departing coach: ""Polly is learning to play beautifully,"" mused Phronsie, nursing one foot contemplatively, as she curled up on the floor. ""And Ben is to be a capital business man, so Papa Fisher says, and Joel is going to buy up this whole town sometime, and Davie knows ever so many books from beginning to end, but what can I do?"""
"""Tweet--tweet--ch-r-r-r""--Cherry in his cage over her head, chirped vigorously by way of consolation, but Phronsie did not lift her head. Cherry seeing all his efforts in vain, stopped his song and rolled one black eye down at her in astonishment, and soon became quite still.Presently the rustle of a stiff black satin gown became the chief intruder upon the silence. It was so asserting that Phronsie lifted her head to look into the face of Mrs. Chatterton, standing before her, playing with the rings on her long white hands, and regarding her as if she would soon require an explanation of such strange conduct.""Thinking,"" said Phronsie; and she laid her chin in her hand, and slowly turned her gaze upon the thin, disagreeable face before her, but not as if in the slightest degree given up to a study of its lines and expression.""Because I do not think you would understand them,"" said Phronsie. And now she looked at the face she had before overlooked, with a deliberate scrutiny as if she would not need to repeat the attention.""Very old!"" cried Mrs. Chatterton, her chin in the air. ""Indeed! well, I am not, I would have you know, Miss Phronsie,"" and she played with the silk cord of her satin wrapper. ""I hate a child that is made a prig!"" she added explosively under her breath.""Now, Phronsie,"" said Mrs. Chatterton, suddenly drawing herself out of her angry fit, and clearing her brow, ""I want you to give your attention to me a moment, for I have something I must say to you. That's why I came in here, to find you alone. Come, look at me, child. It isn't polite to be staring at the carpet all the time.""""You see, Phronsie,"" she proceeded, not caring that the brown eyes were slowly adding to their astonishment an expression that augured ill for any plans she might be hoping to carry out toward propitiation. ""It is necessary to be careful not to be overheard, for what I am going to say to you must be kept quite secret.""""And a very creditable one she will be, from all acounts I can gather,"" contributed Mrs. Chatterton carelessly. ""Well, Ben is doing well in Cabot & Van Meter's, so he's no trouble to your mother. As for the two boys, I know nothing about them, one way or the other. But you, as you are a girl, and the only one not provided for, why, I shall show a little kindness in your direction. It's wholly disinterested and quixotic, I know,"" added Mrs. Chatterton, with a sweeping gaze at the walls and ceilings, ""for me to give myself a thought about you or your future. And I shall never receive so much as a thank you for it. But I've passed all my life in thinking of others, Phronsie,"" here she brought down her attention to the absorbed little countenance, ""and I cannot change now,"" she finished pensively.A silence fell upon them, so great that Mrs. Chatterton broke it nervously. ""Goodness me, Phronsie, you are not like a child; you are too uncanny for anything. Why don't you ask questions about my secret?""""Oh! now I am dear Mrs. Chatterton,"" cried that lady, with a hard, ill-favored smile. But she lowered her tone to a gentler one, and extending one jeweled hand, took the little folded ones in her clasp."
"""I will be a good friend to you, and show you how you can learn to do something so that when you grow up, you can take care of yourself, just as Polly will. Just think, Phronsie, just as Polly will,"" cried Mrs. Chatterton artfully.""Well, I have been looking for one for a long time. I want one who will be a daughter to me; who will grow up under my direction, and who will appreciate what I sacrifice in taking her. She must be nice-looking, for I couldn't stand an ill-favored child. I have found several who were much better looking than you, Phronsie; in fact, they were beauties; but I don't like the attitude of their families. The poor things actually thought they were doing me a favor by accepting my proposition for the children.""""Now, although you haven't as much to recommend you as many other children that I have fancied, I hope to make you serve my purpose. I am going to try you, at least. Every day, Phronsie, you can come to my room. It's lucky that you don't go to school, but do pretty much as you like in this house, so no questions will be asked.""""Of course. I know that; a very silly thing it is too. There's no use in trying to break it up now, I suppose, or I'd put my hand to the attempt. But you can come to me after you've got through toadying Mr. King.""""Never mind; that hasn't anything to do with the business in hand,"" replied Mrs. Chatterton impatiently. ""Now if you come to me every day, and give me as much time as you can, why, I'll show you what I want of you, and teach you many things. Then after a while, Phronsie, when you learn to appreciate it, I shall tell you what I am going to do. The adoption will be an easy matter, I fancy, when the child is interested,"" she added, taking the precaution to mutter it.""You must do everything as I tell you,"" Mrs. Chatterton leaned forward, and said with great deliberateness, ""else you will lose this chance to help your mother. And you will never have another like it, but will grow up to be a good-for-nothing little thing when Polly and all the rest are earning money for your Mamsie, as you call her.""""Never!"" Mrs. Chatterton brought her foot, incased in its black satin slipper, down with force on the carpet. ""You will never earn a cent of money in all this world, unless you do exactly as I say; for you are a child who hasn't it in her to learn anything. But you can help me, and I shall teach you many things, and do well by you.""""When I grow a big girl, will anybody want me to do those things that you are going to teach me?"" asked Phronsie, drawing near to lay her hand on the stiff black gown, and speaking earnestly. ""Then if they will, I'll try to do them just exactly as you tell me.""""I shall give it all to Mamsie,"" interrupted Phronsie, her brown eyes dilating quickly, ""every single twenty-five cents you give me. Then I guess she will be glad, don't you?"" she cried, clasping her hands in sudden rapture, while she began to dance up and down."
"""I shall give you so many twenty-five cents,"" cried Mrs. Chatterton, beginning to feel her old heart beat with more enthusiasm than she had known for many a day, ""that you will be very rich, Phronsie.""""But you must do exactly as I tell you."" Mrs. Chatterton leaned forward suddenly, and seized the little hands, now so still in their delight. ""Remember, it is only when you follow my commands in every single thing that you will have any chance of earning all this money for your mother, and helping her just at Polly is going to do. Remember now, Phronsie!""""Very good. We will begin now then."" Mrs. Chatterton threw herself back in her chair, and drew a long breath. ""Lucky I found the child alone, and so tractable. It's singularly good fortune,"" she muttered. ""Well,"" aloud, with a light laugh, ""now, Phronsie, if you are going to be your mother's helper, why, this is your first duty. Let us see how well you perform it. Run upstairs to the closet out of the lumber-room, and open the little black box on the shelf in front of the door--the box isn't locked--and bring me the roll of black velvet ribbon you will find there.""Phronsie was about to ask, ""Why does not Hortense go up for it?"" but Mrs. Chatterton forestalled the question by saying with a frown, ""Hortense has gone down to the dressmaker's. No child who calls me to account for anything I ask of her can be helped by me. Do as you like, Phronsie. No one will compel you to learn how to do things so that you can be a comfort to your mother. Only remember, if you don't obey me, you will lose your only chance."" After this speech, Mrs. Chatterton sat back and played with her rings, looking with oblique glances of cold consideration at the child.""I do really believe I can bend one of those dreadful Pepper children to my will,"" thought Mrs. Chatterton exultingly. ""She is my only hope. Polly does better than she did, but she is too old to be tractable, and she has a shrewd head on her practical body, and the others are just horrible!"" She gave a shiver. ""But Phronsie will grow up to fit my purpose, I think. Three purposes, I may say--to get the Peppers gradually out from under Horatio King's influence, and to train up a girl to wait on me so that I can get away from these French villains of maids, and to spite Alexander's daughter by finally adopting this Phronsie if she suits me. But I must move carefully. The first thing is to get the child fastened to me by her own will.""Phronsie, ascending the stairs to the lumber-room, with careful deliberateness, found no hint of joy at the prospect before her, reaching into the dim distance to that enchanted time when she should be grown up. But there was a strangely new sense of responsibility, born in an hour; and an acceptance of life's burdens, that made her feel very old and wise."
"But the shadowy corner only gave back the renewed efforts of the sharp little teeth; so at last, Phronsie, plucking up courage, stepped in. The door swung to after her, giving out a little click, unnoticed in her trepidation as she picked her way carefully along, holding her red gown away from any chance nibbles. It was a low narrow closet, unlighted save by a narrow latticed window, in the ceiling, for the most part filled with two lines of shelves running along the side and one end. Phronsie caught her breath as she went in, the air was so confined; and stumbling over in the dim light, put her hand on the box desired, a small black affair, easily found, as it was the only one there.""It sticks, I suppose, because no one comes up here only once in a great while,"" she said in a puzzled way. ""I ought to be able to pull it open, I'm sure, for I am so big and strong."" She exerted all her strength till her face was like a rose. The door was fast. Phronsie turned a despairing look upon the shadowy corner.""Please don't bite me,"" she said, the large tears gathering in her brown eyes. ""I am locked in here in your house; but I didn't want to come, and I won't do anything to hurt you if you'll let me sit down and wait till somebody comes to let me out.""""What utter nonsense! Yet I suppose I must go, or the silly creature will have it ruined. Take off this gown, Hortense, and bring my walking suit, then ring and say I'd like to have Thomas take me down there at once,"" and throwing off her bracelets, and the various buckles and pins that confined her laces, she rapidly disrobed and was expeditiously inducted by Hortense into her walking apparel, and, a parlor maid announcing that Thomas with the coupe was at the door, she hurried downstairs, with no thought for anything beyond a hasty last charge to her maid.""Good work tells generally,"" said her mother, pausing on her way to the closet for a closer inspection of her and her head; ""you haven't taken as much pains, Polly, lately with your hair; that is the trouble.""""O dear, I suppose so,"" sighed Polly, left to her own reflections and brushing away. ""Well, that's the best I can make it look now, for I can't do the braid over. Where is Phronsie, I wonder! Mamsie,"" she threw down the brush and ran over to put her head in the closet, ""where did she go?""""I told her she might run over to Helen Fargo's, right after breakfast,"" said Mrs. Fisher, her head over a trunk, from which she was taking summer dresses. ""Polly, I think you'll get one more season's wear out of this pink cambric.""""Oh! I am so glad,"" cried Polly, ""for I had such splendidly good times in it,"" with a fond glance at the pink folds and ruffles. ""Well, if Phronsie is over at Helen's, there's no use in asking her to go down town with us.""""You would better let her stay where she is,"" advised Mother Fisher; ""she hasn't been over to Helen's for quite a while, so it's a pity to call her away,"" and she turned to her unpacking again, while Polly ran off on the wings of the wind, in a tremor at having kept Jasper waiting so long.""Candace"" was the widow of an old colored servant of Mr. King's; she called herself a ""relict;"" that, and the pride in her little shop, made her hold her turbaned head high in the air, while a perennial smile enwreathed her round face.The shop was on Temple Place, a narrow extension thrown out from one of the city's thoroughfares. She was known for a few specialties; such as big sugary doughnuts that appealed alike to old and young. They were always fresh and sweet, with just the proper amount of spice to make them toothsome; and she made holders of various descriptions, with the most elaborate patterns wrought always in yellow worsted; with several other things that the ladies protested could never be found elsewhere. Jasper had been accustomed to run down to Candace's little shop, since pinafore days, when he had been taken there by his nurse, and set upon a high stool before the small counter, and plied with dainties by the delighted Candace."
"And after the ""pinafore days"" were over, Candace was the boy's helper in all his sports where a woman's needle could stitch him out of any difficulty. She it was who made the sails to his boats, and marvelous skate bags. She embroidered the most intricate of straps for his school-books, and once she horrified him completely by working in red cotton, large ""J's"" on two handkerchiefs. He stifled the horror when he saw her delight in presenting the gift, and afterwards was careful to remember to carry a handkerchief occasionally when on an errand to the shop.Latterly Candace was occupied in preparing pins for Jasper's cabinet, out of old needles that had lost their eyes. She cleverly put on red and black sealing wax heads, turning them out as round as the skillful manipulation of deft fingers could make them. In this new employment, the boy kept her well occupied, many half-dollars thereby finding their way into her little till.""I wish Phronsie had come,"" said Polly, as she and Jasper sorted the pins in the little wooden tray Candace kept for the purpose. ""How many red ones you will have, Jasper--see--fifteen; well, they're prettier than the others.""""She's a perfec' beauty!"" repeated Candace in satisfaction, ""an' I done made her all myself fer de little Miss,"" and she dodged behind the curtain again, this time bringing out a large rag doll with surprising black bead eyes, a generous crop of wool on its head, and a red worsted mouth.""Ain't it?"" said Candace, her black face aglow with delight. ""Ole Miss gimme dat yeller satin long ago, w'en I belonged to her befo' de war. An' dat yere apun was a piece of ole Miss's night-cap. She used to have sights of 'em, and dey was all ruffled like to kill, an' made o' tambour work.""""You go 'long!"" exclaimed Candace, in delight, and bestowing a gentle pat of deprecation on his shoulder, ""'tain't like what I could do; but la! well, you send de bressed chile along, and mabbe she'll like it.""""Jasper, we'll stop at Helen's now,"" said Polly as the two hurried by the tall iron fence, that, lined with its thick hedge, shut out the Fargo estate from vulgar eyes, ""and get Phronsie; she'll be ready to come home now; it's nearly luncheon time.""""Is Phronsie ready to come home?"" asked Polly of the maid. ""Tell her to hurry and get her things on; we'll wait here. Oh, Jasper!"" turning to him, ""why couldn't we have the club next week, Wednesday night?""""No, she isn't, Miss Mary,"" said Hannah. ""I've been sweeping the nursery this morning; just got through."" She pointed to her broom and dustpan that she had set in a convenient corner, as proof of her statement.""Oh, Jasper! do you suppose she will?"" cried Polly, unable to stifle an undefinable dread. She was running now on frightened feet, Jasper having hard work to keep up with her, and the two dashed through the little gate in the hedge where Phronsie was accustomed to let herself through on the only walk she was ever allowed to take alone, and into the house where Polly cried to the first person she met, ""Where's Phronsie?"" to be met with what she dreaded, ""Gone over to Helen Fargo's."""
"And now there was indeed alarm through the big house. Not knowing where to look, each fell in the other's way, quite as much concerned for Mr. King's well-being; for the old gentleman was reduced to such a state by the fright that the entire household had all they could do to keep him in bounds.""Madame is not to come home to luncheon,"" announced Hortense to Mrs. Whitney in the midst of the excitement. ""She told me to tell you that de Mees Taylor met her at de modiste, and took her home with her.""""Do you go at once,"" commanded Mrs. Whitney, with a light in her blue eyes that the maid never remembered seeing. She was even guilty of stamping her pretty foot in the exigency, and Hortense slowly gathered herself up.""Humph! yes."" Mrs. Chatterton's still shapely shoulders allowed themselves a shrug intended to reveal volumes. ""What Jasper Horatio King believes, the rest of the household accept as law and gospel. But it's no less infatuation.""""I'll not hear one word involving those dear Peppers,"" cried Madame Dyce. ""If I could, I'd have them in my house. And it's a most unrighteous piece of work, in my opinion, to endeavor to arouse prejudice against them. It goes quite to my heart to remember their struggles all those years.""Mrs. Chatterton turned on her with venom. Was all the world arrayed against her, to take up with those hateful interlopers in her cousin's home? She made another effort. ""I should have credited you with more penetration into motives than to allow yourself to be deceived by such a woman as Mrs. Pepper.""""Do give her the name that belongs to her. I believe she's Mrs. Dr. Fisher, isn't she?"" drawled Livingston Bayley, a budding youth, with a moustache that occasioned him much thought, and a solitary eyeglass.""Stuff and nonsense! Yes, what an absurd thing that wedding was. Did anybody ever hear or see the like!"" Mrs. Chatterton lifted her long jeweled hands in derision, but as no one joined in the laugh, she dropped them slowly into her lap.""I can't sit down,"" he said, as the company made way for him to join them. ""I came home for some important papers. I suppose you have heard the trouble at the Kings? I happened to drop in there. Well, Dyce,"" laying his hand on that gentleman's chair, ""I scarcely expected to see you here to-day. Why aren't you at the club spread?"""
"""How easily a scene is gotten up,"" said Mrs. Chatterton, ""over a naughty little runaway. I wish some of the poor people in this town could have a tithe of the attention that is wasted on these Peppers,"" she added virtuously.""Of course she has,"" asserted Mrs. Chatterton, in that positive way that made everybody hate her to begin with. ""She was all right this morning when I left home. Where else is she, if she hasn't run away, pray tell?""Driving home a half-hour later, in a cab summoned for that purpose, Mrs. Chatterton threw off her things, angry not to find Hortense at her post in the dressing-room, where she had been told to finish a piece of sewing, and not caring to encounter any of the family in their present excitement, she determined to take herself off upstairs, where ""I can kill two birds with one stone; get rid of everybody, and find my box myself, because of course that child ran away before she got it.""So she mounted the stairs laboriously, counting herself lucky indeed in finding the upper part of the house quite deserted, and shutting the lumber-room door when she was well within it, she proceeded to open the door of the closet.""Hortense didn't tell me there was a spring lock on this door,"" she exclaimed, with an impatient pull. ""Oh! good heavens."" She had nearly stumbled over Phronsie Pepper's little body, lying just where it fell when hope was lost.""I have had nothing to do with it,"" repeated Mrs. Chatterton to herself, following Mr. King and Jasper as they bore Phronsie downstairs, her yellow hair floating from the pallid little face. ""Goodness! I haven't had such a shock in years. My heart is going quite wildly. The child probably went up there for something else; I am not supposed to know anything about it.""""You would better let us carry her; well put her in your bed. Only get the doctor."" Mr. King was almost harsh as he endeavored to pass her. But before the words were over his lips, the mother held her baby.Dr. Fisher met them at the door. Polly never forgot the long, slow terror that clutched at her heart as she scanned his face while he took the child out of the arms that now yielded up their burden. And everything turned dark before her eyes--Was Phronsie dead?""Clearly I have had nothing to do with it,"" said Mrs. Chatterton to herself, stumbling into a room at the other end of the hall. But her face was gray, and she found herself picking nervously at the folds of lace at her throat. ""The child went up there, as all children will, to explore. I shall say nothing about it--nothing whatever. Oh! how is she?"" grasping blindly at Jasper as he rushed by the door."
"""Stuff and--oh! well,"" muttering on. ""She'll probably come to. Children can bear a little confinement; an hour or two doesn't matter with them--Hortense!"" aloud, ""bring me my sal volatile. Dear me! this is telling on my nerves."" She caught sight of her face in the long mirror opposite, and shivered to see how ghastly it was. ""Where is the girl? Hortense, I say, come here this instant!""""Give me air,"" said Madame Chatterton, her fingers relaxing, and making a great effort not to fall. ""Help me over to the window, and open it, girl""--and leaning heavily on the slight figure, she managed to get across the room.Would no one ever come near her but this detestable maid, with her still more detestable news? Mrs. Chatterton clutched the window casing in her extremity, not feeling the soft springy air as she gasped for breath. The maid, too frightened to leave her, crept into a corner where she watched and cried softly.There was a stir in the household that they might have heard, betokening the arrival of two other doctors, but no word came. And darkness settled upon the room. Still the figure in the window niche held to its support, and still the maid cried at her post.Obey? When had Mr. King heard that word addressed to himself. He drew a long breath, looked full into the spectacled eyes, then said, ""All right, Fisher; I suppose you know best,"" and went back to his arm-chair.""Are you, Pet? Well, now, I'll tell you what we'll do. Let us both go to sleep. There, Phronsie, now you put your arms down, so""--Polly gave them a swift little tuck under the bed-clothes--""and I'll get up beside you, so""--and she crept on to the bed--""and we'll both go right to 'nid-nid-nodland,' don't you know?""""Oh! better, is she?"" Mrs. Chatterton looked up quickly to see Mrs. Whitney's pale face. ""Well, I supposed she would be. I thought I'd sit here and wait to know, since you were all so frightened. But I knew it wouldn't amount to much. Now, girl,"" nodding over to the maid still in the corner, ""you may get me to bed."" And she stretched her stiff limbs, and held out her hand imperatively."
"""That will be very nice,"" breathed Phronsie slowly. ""And I want my little tea-set--just the two cups and saucers--and my own little pot and sugar-bowl. Do let me, Mamsie, and you shall have a cup of milk with me,"" she cried, a little pink color stealing into either cheek.""Yes, yes, child,"" said Mother Fisher. ""There, you mustn't try to lean forward. I'll bring the little table Grandpapa bought, so;"" she hurried over across the room and wheeled it into place. ""Now isn't that fine, Phronsie?"" as the long wing swung over the bed. ""Did you ever see such a tea-party as you and I'll have?""""Bless honey's heart!"" ejaculated Sarah, her black face shining with delight. ""Ain't he a beauty, though?"" setting down on the table-wing a pink plate in the midst of which reposed an apple whose crackling skin disclosed a toothsome interior. ""I bring a pink sasser so's to match his insides. But ain't he rich, though!""""Give me a waltz now, Polly,"" begged Philena. ""Dear me, I haven't had a sight of you hardly, for so long, I am positively starved for you. I don't care for you other girls now,"" she cried, as the two went whirling down the long room together.""I feel as if I could dance forever,"" cried Polly, when Amy Garrett turned away from the piano and declared she would play no more--and she still pirouetted on one foot, to come up red as a rose to the group.""Thank you,"" said Cathie, a tall girl, with such light hair and sallow face that she looked ten years older than her fourteen summers. ""I sometimes know quite as much as a few other people of my acquaintance,"" she said pointedly.""Now I know the doctor makes you take perfectly terrible things, and won't let you eat anything. And macaroons are the only things I can make. It's a shame!"" and down sat Cathie in despair on an ottoman.To be called a goose by two persons in the course of an hour was too much for Cathie's endurance, and flinging off the girl's arm, she cried out passionately, ""I won't stay; I'm going home!"" and rushed out the door.Dr. Fisher set his spectacles straight, and looked at Alexia, but he did not even smile, as she hoped he would do. ""I can't help it,"" she said, tracing the pattern of the carpet with the toe of her boot, ""she makes us all so uncomfortable, oh! you can't think. And I wish she'd stay home forever."""
"""O dear, dear!"" cried Alexia, when they had all looked at each other a breathing space. ""Why didn't he speak? I'd much rather he'd scold like everything than to look like that. Polly, why don't you say something?""""To think of that Cathie Harrison making such a breeze,"" cried Alexia angrily; ""a girl who's just come among us, as it were, and we only let her in our set because Miss Salisbury asked us to make things pleasant for her. If it had been any one else who raised such a fuss!""Meantime Dr. Fisher strode out to the west porch, intending to walk down to his office, and buttoning up his coat as he went along. As he turned the angle in the drive, he came suddenly upon a girl who had thrown herself down on a rustic seat under a tree, and whose shoulders were shaking so violently that he knew she was sobbing, though he heard no sound.""Polly Pepper!"" exclaimed Alexia, as a turn in the drive brought the two figures in view of the music-room windows, ""did you ever see such a sight in your life? Cathie is walking off with Dr. Fisher! There isn't anything her tongue won't say!""""But she ought to know it just as soon as it's talked of,"" said Jasper, fidgeting at a case of little vials on the table. ""Oh! beg pardon again. I'm afraid I've smashed that chap,"" as one rolled off to the floor. ""I'm no end sorry,"" picking up the bits ruefully.""Don't I know it?"" exclaimed Jasper, in an astonished tone. ""Dear me, Dr. Fisher, I've watched Polly for years now. And she's always done so."" He stopped whirling the articles on the office table, and bestowed a half-offended look on the little physician.""Softly, softly, Jasper,"" said Dr. Fisher composedly. ""Of course you've used your eyes. Now don't spoil things by saying anything, but let Polly 'go her own gait,' I beg of you."" Then he turned to his powders once more.""Now when I come up home for dinner, you and I will find Polly, and tell her the good news. If she's with a lot of those silly girls, I'll--I'll tear her off this time."" Dr. Fisher glared so fiercely as he declared this determination that Jasper laughed outright."
"""Yes, yes,"" he muttered, walking to the window, ""it will be a good thing for Polly, now I tell you, Adoniram."" He always preferred to address himself by his first name; then he was sure of a listener. ""A vastly good thing. It's quite time that some of the intimacies with these silly creatures are broken up a bit, while the child gains immensely in other ways."" He rubbed his palms gleefully. ""Oh! good-morning, good-morning!""""I pity you, then,"" said Dr. Fisher, with the air of having been a family man for years. ""Well, besides owning the Peppers, I'm going off with them to""--there he stopped, for before he knew it, the secret was well-nigh out.""I'll do what I can to help,"" said the little doctor between his teeth, and taking a long draught of the coffee his wife put by his plate. ""I suppose there's no objection to that. Now, that's good,"" smacking his lips in a pleased way.""Of course not, if you help in the right way,"" said old Mr. King stoutly, ""but I'll wager anything that you're picking up all sorts of odd jobs among the poor, that belong to the young doctors. Your place is considerably higher, where you can pick and choose your patients.""""I don't agree with you,"" the little doctor drew off his attention from his plate. ""You see she has regained her strength remarkably. Now the quicker she is in the family life again, the better for her.""""Not so fast, Polly."" The little doctor beamed at her in a way surprising to see after the morning's affair. ""Phronsie won't be ready for any celebration before next week. Then I think you may venture.""""Can't we have some of those boys up from the Orphan Asylum?"" asked Polly, after a minute in which everybody had done a bit of hard thinking. ""Phronsie loves to hear them sing when she goes there. Oh! they are so cunning.""""No, she never gives away one of the dolls you've given her, father,"" said Mrs. Whitney slowly, ""not a single one. I tried her one day, asking her to give me one to bestow on a poor child, and she quite reproached me by the look in her brown eyes. I haven't asked her since.""""'I can't, Auntie; dear Grandpapa gave them to me himself.' Then she ran for her savings bank, and poured out the money in my lap. 'Let's go out and buy the poor child a doll,' she begged, and I really had to do it. And there must be at least two hundred dolls in this house."""
"""I just hate dolls,"" exploded Dick. ""Faugh! how can girls play with them; they're so silly. And Phronsie always has something to do for hers, so she can't come when I want her to. I wish they were burned up,"" he added vindictively.The next morning Phronsie was waiting for Grandpapa King, who insisted that no one else should carry her downstairs, the remainder of the household in various stages of delight and expectation, revolving around her, and curbing their impatience as best they might, in hall and on staircase.""Yes, yes,"" said the old gentleman with great abruptness, ""to be sure one must, Phronsie. To be sure. So now if any one has promised you anything, do you make him stick to it. It's mean enough to break your word, child.""""Remember what I say, Phronsie,"" laughed Mr. King, his mind more intent on the delightful fact that he was carrying down the longed-for burden to the family life, than on what he was saying, ""and if any one has promised you anything, keep him up sharp to pay you. I verily believe it is that scamp Dick. Here goes!"" and reaching the door he threw it wide. ""Forward, march!""""Good morning, Cousin Eunice,"" cried Mr. King gaily. He could be merry with any one this day. ""Come on, this is a festal occasion, you see; Phronsie's going downstairs for the first time. Fall into line!""""I certainly am losing ground,"" she muttered, ""every little thing affects me so. I'll step into Bartram's office next time I go down town and set that little matter straight, since I've made up my mind to do it. It never would do to let him come to the house. Horatio would suspect something to see my lawyer here, and the whole household imagine I was going to die right off. No, no; I must go there, that's clear. Then if it's attended to, I'll live all the longer, with nothing on my mind.""Phronsie, meanwhile, was going around from room to room in a pleased way, and touching different objects gently ""Everything's new, isn't it, Polly,"" she said at last, ""when you stay upstairs? Oh! there's my kittens in the basket,"" pointing to a bisque vase on the table.Phronsie smothered a sigh, and turned slowly away from the kittens waiting in their basket for Alexia's flowers. ""Come on!"" shouted Dick, seizing her hand. ""You never can guess what it is, in all this world."""
"This episode taking the family life to the rear of the house, no one noticed that soft footsteps were passing through the open front door, that Jane, who was sweeping the vestibule, had left ajar to run and tell Dick that she had not let the bird out of the dining-room. So the uninvited guest to the household let himself up easily to the scene of his hopes--the location of the ladies' jewel-boxes. Mrs. Chatterton, standing by her toilet table, carefully examining her wealth of gray hair to note the changes in its tint, was suddenly surprised in the very act of picking out an obnoxious white hair, by a slight noise in the further corner of the apartment. And dropping her fingers quickly and turning away from the glass, she exclaimed, ""How dare you, Hortense, come in without knocking?""""If you make a noise I'll kill you,"" declared a man, standing in the shadow of a portiere and watching her underneath a slouched black hat. There was a slight click that caused the listener's nerves to thrill. But her varied life had brought her nothing if not self-control, and she coolly answered, ""If you want my money, say so.""""Not exactly money, ma'am,"" said the man, ""for I don't suppose you have much here. But I'll thank you to hand over that there box of diamonds."" He extended the other hand with its dingy fingers toward a large ebony jewel-case elaborate with its brass hinges, and suggestive of double locks, on a corner of the table.""If you are determined to take it, I suppose I must give it to you,"" said Mrs. Chatterton, with evident reluctance handing the box designated, very glad to think she had but a few days before changed the jewels to another repository to escape Hortense's prying eyes. In making the movement she gave a sweeping glance out the window. Should she dare to scream? Michael was busy on the lawn, she knew; she could hear his voice talking to one of the under gardeners.""See here, old lady,"" warned the man, ""you keep your eyes in the room. Now then,"" his greedy glance fastened on the glittering gems on her fingers, ""I'll thank you to rip them things off."" Dick, racing along the further end of the hall after his bird with a ""Whoop, la--I've almost caught you,"" startling him, he proceeded to perform the service for himself.""There he goes!"" cried Dick, ""in her room. Bother! Well, I must catch him."" So without the preamble of knocking, the boy dashed into the dressing-room. The bird whizzing ahead of him, flashed between the drawn folds of the portiere.The bird flying over his head, and the appearance of the boy, disconcerted the robber for one instant. He held the long white hand in his, tearing off the rings. There was no chance for her to escape, she knew, but she could save Dick.Dick, clutching and tearing blindly at whatever in the line of hair or ragged garment he could lay hold of, was waging an unequal warfare. But what he did was accomplished finely. And the bird, rushing blindly into the midst of the contention, with whirrings and flappings indescribable, helped more than an army of servants, to confuse the man. Notwithstanding, it was soon over, but not before Mrs. Chatterton had wrenched her fingers free, and grasped the pistol from its loose hold in his other hand. The box under his arm fell to the floor, and Dick was just being tossed to the other side of the room; she could hear him strike the cheval-glass with a dull thud."
"Jasper had seized a table-spread, and as Michael and the undergardeners advanced, he went back of the robber, and cleverly threw it over his head. It was easy to secure and bind him then. Polly rushed over to Dick.""Turn the creature over and let us see how he looks,"" said Mr. King, hurrying in as the last knot of the rope was made fast. The old slouched hat had fallen off in the struggle, and the man's features came plainly to view. ""He's no beauty, and that's a fact.""""I've seen that fellow round here for many a day,"" said Michael, giving the recumbent legs a small kick. ""Oncet he axed me ef we wanted ony wourk done. I mind yees, yer see,"" with another attention from his gardening boot.""I want to tie one rope,"" cried a voice. Dick opened his eyes, rubbed them, and felt of his head. ""I'm all right, Polly. I saw stars, but I've got over it, I guess. Let me give him the last knot."" He staggered blindly to his feet.With that Mrs. Chatterton's spirit returned. She sprang from her chair, and rushed around from bureau to closet to see the extent of her maid's dishonesty. But beyond a few minor deficiencies of her wardrobe, there was no robbery to speak of. Evidently Hortense had considered it unwise to be burdened with much impedimenta. So the robber was hauled off to justice, and Phronsie, coming wonderingly up the stairs, came softly in upon them, in time to see Dick rush up to Mrs. Chatterton with a ""You're a brick!"" before them all.After that, there was no more hope of keeping things quiet in the house for Phronsie's sake. Meanwhile the bird, who had played no mean part in the engagement, now asserted himself, and blindly rushed into capture.And at the end of that exciting day, the secret came out, after all, in rather a tame fashion. Dr. Fisher and Jasper met Polly in an angle of the hall, as she was running upstairs after dinner for her schoolbooks.""Why, Jasper Elyot King!"" cried Polly, slipping out from under the doctor's palms, and seizing the two hands extended, she began to spin around as in the olden days, ""did you ever, ever hear of anything so perfectly magnificent! But Ben and Joel and Davie!"" and she paused on the edge of another pirouette.""How can we ever leave the boys! Oh! I don't see,"" cried Polly, a bit reproachfully, her hair blown over her rosy cheeks. As they danced lightly down the long hall, Dr. Fisher leaned against a pillar, and watched them."
"""All right,"" said Dr. Fisher bravely. So Jasper took the deserted post by the pillar, and whistled a Strauss waltz. Thereupon a most extraordinary hopping up and down the hall was commenced, the two figures bobbing like a pair of corks on a quivering water-surface.""I couldn't help it,"" said the little doctor, coming up red and animated, and wiping his forehead. His spectacles had fallen off long since, and he had let them go. ""It looked so nice to see Jasper and Polly, I thought I'd try it. I didn't suppose I'd get on so well; I really believe I can dance.""""Do you like it, Polly?"" asked Mr. King, holding out his hand. ""Say, my girl?"" And then before she could answer, he went on, ""You see, we can't do anything without a doctor on our travels. Now Providence has given us one, though rather an obstinate specimen,"" he pointed to Father Fisher. ""And he wants to see the hospitals, and you want to study a bit of music, and your mother wants rest, and Jasper and Phronsie and I want fun, so we're going, that's all.""""I didn't say anything what you could or couldn't do. I said you weren't here, and you weren't. That's enough,"" and Percy turned his back on him, thrust his hands in the pockets of his morning jacket and stalked to the window.Van opened his mouth to speak, then thought better of it, and gave a low whistle. Joel, finding no enthusiasm for tales of his fighting prowess, ran off to interview Dick on the old topic of the burglary and to obtain another close account of its details.""Oh! you come along,"" cried Van, laying hold of his jacket. ""See here,"" dropping his voice cautiously, as he towed him successfully out, ""let's give Joe a chance to see a burglar; he wants to so terribly.""""I forgot it, too,"" declared Van, quieting down, and thrusting out his brown palm to meet his brother's. ""Well, I don't care what you say if you'll only go halves in this lark,"" he finished, brightening up.""All right,"" said Jencks, taking it. ""That's the sixth box for Miss Phronsie that I've took in this morning,"" he soliloquized, going down the hall and reading the address carefully. ""And all the same size.""""Ding-a-ling,"" Jencks laid the parcel quickly on one of the oaken chairs in the hall, and hurried to the door, to be met by another parcel for ""Miss Phronsie Pepper: not to be given to her till to-morrow.""And Polly would turn her back on a certain cloud of white muslin and floating lace, and flying off to Alexia to give the necessary criticism, with a pull here and a pat there, would set matters straight, presently running back to her own work again.""You see,"" she said, ""everything must be just right, for next to Mamsie's wedding, this is to be the most important occasion, Alexia Rhys, that we've ever known. We can't have anything too nice for Phronsie's getting-well party."""
"""That's so,"" said Alexia, twitching a pink satin bow on the handle of a flower-basket. ""O dear me! this bow looks like everything! I've tried six different times to make it hang down quite careless and refined. And just to provoke me, it pokes up like a stiff old thing in my face. Do come and tie it, Polly.""""I suppose so,"" said Polly. ""Grandpapa said I would better, but O dear me, I don't believe I can ever get through with it in all this world,"" and Polly hid her face behind a cloud of muslin that was slowly coming into shape as a dress for one of Phronsie's biggest dolls.""It will be dreadful,"" said Alexia, with a pathetic little sniff, and beginning on a second pink bow, ""but then, you know, it's your duty to go off nicely, and I'm sure you can't do it, Polly, without a farewell party.""""Oh! well, you'll only peg away at it when you've a mind,"" said Alexia carelessly, and setting lazy stitches. ""Most of the time you'll be jaunting around, seeing things, and having fun generally. Oh! don't I wish I was going with you.""""Alexia Rhys!"" cried Polly in astonishment, and casting her needle from her, she deserted the muslin cloud summarily. ""Only peg away when I have the mind?"" she repeated indignantly. ""Well, I shall have the mind most of the time, I can tell you. Why, that's what I am going abroad for, to study music. How can I ever teach it, if I don't go, pray tell?"" she demanded, and now her eyes flashed, and her hands worked nervously.""Oh! nonsense,"" cried Alexia, not looking at the face before her, and going on recklessly, ""as if that meant anything, all that talk about your being a music-teacher, Polly,"" and she gave a little incredulous laugh.Polly got out of her chair somehow, and stood very close to the fussing fingers over the pink satin bow. ""Do you never dare say that to me again,"" she commanded; ""it's the whole of my life to be a music-teacher--the very whole.""""Oh, Polly!"" down went the satin bow dragging with it Alexia's spool of silk and the dainty scissors. ""Don't--don't--I didn't mean anything; but you really know that Mr. King will never let you be a music-teacher in all this world. Never; you know it, Polly. Oh! don't look like that; please don't."""
"""Well, he'll get out of it somehow,"" said Alexia, her evil genius urging her on, ""for you know, Polly, it would be too queer for any of his family, and--and a girl of our set, to turn out a music-teacher. You know, Polly, that it would.""""If any of the girls in our set,"" said Polly grandly, and stepping off from Alexia, ""wish to draw away from me, they can do so now. I am to be a music-teacher; I'm perfectly happy to be one, I want you all to understand. Just as happy as I can possibly be in all this world. Why, it's what I've been studying and working for, and how else do you suppose I can ever repay dear Grandpapa for helping me?"" Her voice broke, and she stopped a minute, clasping her hands tightly to keep back the rush of words.""Polly, if you don't stop, you'll--you'll kill me,"" gasped Alexia. ""Oh, Polly! I don't care what you are. You may teach all day if you want to, and I'll help get you scholars. I'll do anything, and so will all the girls; I know they will. Polly, do let me be your friend just as I was. O, dear, dear! I wish I hadn't said anything--I wish I had bitten my tongue off; I didn't think you'd mind it so much,"" and now Alexia broke down, and sobbed outright.""Don't ask me. You know I won't,"" promised Alexia, her spirits rising. So Polly went over to her and set a kiss on her wet cheek, comforting her as only Polly could, and before long the pink satin bow, with the spool of silk hanging to it, and the scissors were found under the table, and Polly attacked the muslin cloud with redoubled vigor, and the girls' voices carried merry laughter and scraps of happy talk, and Mrs. Chatterton stole out of the little reading-room next to them and shut herself up in her own apartment.""Four--no, five,"" said Polly, rapidly counting; ""for the one that Grandpapa gave her Christmas before last, Celestine, you know, does need a new waist. I forgot her. But that doesn't count the new sashes, and the hair ribbons and the lace ruffles around the necks; I guess there are almost fifty of them. Dear me, I must hurry,"" and she began to sew faster yet.And then Jencks walked in with his seven boxes exactly alike as to size, and deposited them solemnly in a row on the blue and white lounge. ""For Miss Phronsie Pepper, and not to be opened till to-morrow, Miss Mary.""""It's perfectly horrid to get such a scrap of an outing,"" said Joel that night, sprawling on the rug before the library fire, ""only four days! Why couldn't Mr. Marks be sick longer than that, if he was going to be sick at all, pray?""With a firm step she went into her own room, and turned up the gas. The flash revealed Joel, face downward on the broad, comfortable sofa. Mrs. Fisher went over and closed the door, then came to his side.""Now, that is silly, Joey,"" said Mother Fisher, ""tell me at once what all this trouble is about,"" passing her firm hands over his hot forehead, and trying to look in his face. But he struggled to turn it away from her."
"""Hate school?"" cried Mother Fisher. ""Oh, Joey! think how Ben wanted more schooling, only he wouldn't take the chance when Mr. King offered it to him because he felt that he must be earning money as soon as possible. Oh, Joey!""""No, I don't. The fellows are always twitting me, and every one gets ahead of me, and I'm everlastingly staying in from ballgames to make up lessons, and I'd like to fire the books, I would,"" cried Joel with venom.""I shall go directly downstairs and tell Mr. King that Father Fisher and I, Polly and Phronsie, will not go abroad with him,"" repeated his mother slowly and distinctly while she looked him fully in the face.""The idea, Mamsie, of your staying at home to take care of me,"" said Joel excitedly. ""Why, feel of that."" He bared his arm, and coming up, thrust it out for inspection. ""Isn't that splendid? I do verily believe I could whip any fellow in school, I do,"" he cried, regarding his muscles affectionately. ""If you don't believe it, just pinch them hard. You don't mean it really, Mamsie, what you said, of course. The idea of staying at home to take care of me,"" and he began to prance again.""And before I'd give up, a boy of thirteen, and beg to be taken away from school because the lessons were hard, and I didn't like to study, I'd work myself to skin and bone but I'd go through creditably."" Mrs. Fisher sat straight now as an arrow in her corner of the sofa. ""I've said my say, Joel,"" she finished after a pause, ""and now I shall go down and tell Mr. King.""""Oh! Mamsie is taking care of him, and he'll soon be all right,"" broke in Polly cheerily. ""Do go with Jasper, Phronsie, do, dear."" She took hold of the clasped hands, and smiled up into the drooping face.""If Grandpapa should come in and find her so 'twould be very dreadful!"" exclaimed Polly, looking over at the five boys, who in this sudden emergency were knocked speechless. ""Do let us all play some game. Can't some one think of one?""So Polly began on the never tiresome recital, how Phronsie fell down the stairs leading from the kitchen to the ""provision room"" in the little brown house, with the bread-knife in her hand; and how, because she cut her thumb so that it bled dreadfully, mother decided that she could at last have a pair of shoes bought especially for her very own self; and how Deacon Brown's old horse and wagon were procured, and they all set forth, except mother, and how they rode to town, and how the Beebes were just as good as gold, and how the red-topped shoes fitted as if they were made for Phronsie's feet, and how they all went home, and how Phronsie danced around the kitchen till she was all tired out, and then went to bed carrying the new shoes with her, and how she fell asleep with--""Don't you believe we'd better put it off till some other night?"" whispered Percy to Van on the way upstairs to bed, the library party having broken up early. ""A fellow doesn't want to see a burglar on top of the time Joel has had."""
"""No, no,"" said Van; ""it'll be good for him, and knock the other thing out of his head, don't you see, Percy? I should want something else to think of if I were Joel. You can't back out; you promised, you know.""""It's no use trying to sleep,"" declared Joel, in the middle of the night, and kicking the bed-clothes for the dozenth time into a roll at the foot, ""as long as I can see Mamsie's eyes. I'll just get up and tackle that Latin grammar now. Whew! haven't I got to work, though! Might as well begin at it,"" and he jumped out of bed.Stepping softly over to the door that led into David's little room, he closed it carefully, and with a sigh, lighted the gas. Then he went over to the table where his schoolbooks ought to have been. But instead, the space was piled with a great variety of things--one or two balls, a tennis racket, and a confusion of fishing tackle, while in front, the last thing that had occupied him that day, lay a book of artificial flies.Joel set his teeth together hard, and looked at them. ""Suppose I shan't get much of this sort of thing this summer,"" he muttered. ""Here goes!"" and without trusting himself to take another look, he swept them all off down to the floor and into a corner.""I must cover up the things, or else I know I'll be at them,"" he said, and hurrying over to the bed, he dragged off the cover-lid. ""Now,"" and he threw it over the fascinating mass, ""I've GOT to study. Dear me, where are my books?""For the next five minutes Joel had enough to do to collect his working instruments, and when at last he unearthed them from the corner of his closet where he had thrown them under a pile of boots, he was tired enough to sit down.""I don't know which to go at first,"" he groaned, whirling the leaves of the upper book. ""It ought to be Latin--but then it ought to be algebra just as much, and as for history--well there--here goes, I'll take them as they come.""With a very red face Joel plunged into the first one under his hand. It proved to be the Latin grammar, and with a grimace, he found the page, and resting his elbows on the table, he seized each side of his stubby head with his hands. ""I'll hang on to my hair,"" he said, and plunged into his task.And now there was no sound in the room but his hard breathing, and the noise he made turning the leaves, for he very soon found he was obliged to go back many lessons to understand how to approach the one before him; and with cheeks growing every instant more scarlet with shame and confusion, the drops of perspiration ran down his forehead and fell on his book.""Whew!"" he exclaimed, ""it's horribly hot,"" and pushing back his book, he tiptoed over to the other window and softly raised it. The cool air blew into his face, and leaning far out into the dark night, he drew in deep breaths.""I've skinned through and saved my neck a thousand times,"" he reflected, ""and now I've got to dig like sixty to make up. There's Dave now, sleeping in there like a cat; he doesn't have anything to do, but to run ahead of the class like lightning--just because he""--"
"""Pshaw! well, here goes,"" he exclaimed again, throwing himself into his chair. ""She said, 'I'd work myself to skin and bone but I'd get through creditably.'"" Joel bared his brown arm and regarded it critically. ""I wonder how 'twould look all skin and bone,"" and he gave a short laugh.Outside, a bright blue eye applied to the keyhole, gave place to a bright brown one, till such time as the persons to whom the eyes belonged, were satisfied as to the condition of the interior they were surveying.""A burglar--a burglar!"" flashed through his mind. He held his breath hard and his knees knocked together. But Mamsie's eyes seemed to look with scorn on him again. Joel straightened up, clenched his fist, and every minute expecting to be knocked on the head, he crept like a cat to the further corner, even in this extremity, grumbling inwardly because Mr. King would not allow firearms. ""If I only had them now!"" he thought. ""Well, I must get my club.""Getting down on all-fours, holding his breath, yet with never a thought of danger to himself, he crept along toward the door leading into the hall, then stopped and rested under cover of the heavy window drapery. But as quick as a flash, two dark figures, that now, his eyes becoming more accustomed to the darkness, he could dimly distinguish, reached there before him, and the key clicking in the lock, Joel knew that all hope from escape by that quarter was gone.Like a cat, he sprang to his feet, swung the drapery out suddenly toward the figures, and in the next second hurled himself over the window-sill, hanging to the edge, grasping the blind, crawling to the next window, and so on and over, and down, down, by any friendly thing he could grasp, to the ground.This made Van furious, and pushing Percy with all his might, he wriggled out first as the door flew open, and not forgetting to tiptoe down the hall, he hurried along, Percy behind him, to hear the noise of men's feet coming over the stairs.Van tried to rush forward shouting, ""Thomas, it's we boys--Percy and Van."" Instead, he only succeeded in the darkness, in stumbling over a chair, and falling flat with it amid a frightful racket that drowned his voice.Old Mr. King who had been awakened by the previous noise, and had rung his burglar alarm that connected with Thomas's and Jencks's rooms in the stable, now cried out from his doorway. ""Make quick work, Thomas,"" and Percy saw the gleam of a pistol held high in Thomas's hand.Thomas, whose blood was up, determined once for all to put an end to the profession of burglary as far as his master's house was concerned, now drew nearer, steadying his pistol and trying to sight the nearest fellow. This proved to be Van, now struggling to his feet.""Don't make such a fuss,"" he said crossly. One hand had gripped the sleeve of his night-dress, trying to hold it up in a little wad on the shoulder, the blood pouring down the arm. At sight of this, Van collapsed and slid to the floor.""Don't frighten Mamsie,"" said Joel, his head drooping, despite his efforts to hold it up. ""I'm all right; nothing but a scratch. Ugh! let me be, will you?"" to Mr. Whitney and Jasper, who were trying to support him."
"All this occupied but an instant, and Joel was laid on his bed, and the wound which proved to be only a flesh one, the ball cutting a little furrow as it grazed the shoulder, was dressed, and everybody drew a long breath. ""Tell Van that I'm all right,"" Joel kept saying all the time.""Take off this dreadful thing,"" said Polly with a shiver, and kneeling down, she seized the strings that tied the mask. ""O dear! it's all in a knot. Wait, I'll get the scissors,"" and she found her feet, and ran off to her room.""Don't you see,"" said Polly, sitting down on the floor and cuddling up his head in her lap, ""that Joel is really all right now? Suppose we hadn't a Father Fisher who was a doctor, what should we do then?"" and she even managed a faint laugh.""Oh!"" cried Polly, when this new alarm sprang up, and everybody was running hither and thither to comfort him by the assurance that Joel was not much hurt, ""do, Uncle Mason and Jasper, let me go with you.""Polly, longing to fly to the window to watch, at least, the lantern's twinkling light across the lawn, hurried off to comfort Aunt Whitney, who at this new stage in the affairs, was walking her room, biting her lips to keep from screaming the terror that clutched at her heart.""Oh, Polly!"" she cried, ""I'm so glad you've come. I should die if left alone here much longer;"" her soft hair floated down the white robe, and the blue eyes were filled with tears. ""Do tell me, don't you think they will find Percy?""""Mrs. Chatterton,"" said Mrs. Whitney, raising her head and looking at the new-comer with as much anger as her gentle face could contain, ""I really cannot see you in my room to-night. Excuse me, but I am unstrung by all that has occurred. Will you please not come in""--""I thought I might sit with you,"" said Mrs. Chatterton. In the brief interval since the arousing of the household, she had contrived to make a perfect breakfast toilet, and she folded her hands over her handsome gown. ""Polly might then be with her mother. But if you don't wish me to remain, I will go.""""Polly, you needn't say anything about it,"" exclaimed Mrs. Whitney, like many other gentle creatures, when roused, becoming unreasonably prejudiced; ""I cannot bear the sight of that woman. She has been here so long, and is so intensely disagreeable to us all.""""And you don't act like my mother at all,"" said Dick, standing quite stiffly on his sturdy legs, and gazing at her with disapprobation. ""Didn't Mrs. Chatterton save my life,"" he exploded, ""when the real burglar was going for me? Say, didn't she?"" he cried.""Dick, I want you to go to Mrs. Chatterton's room, and say that I am sorry I refused her offer to help, and that I would like to have her sit with me. Remember, say I am sorry I refused her offer to help, Dicky."" She leaned forward and kissed her boy, her long, soft hair falling like a veil around the two faces."
"""She looks just as she did the night she took her new shoes to bed,"" thought Polly; ""one hand is over her head, exactly as it was then. Oh, Phronsie! to think that you're to have no party to-morrow,"" and she turned off with a sigh, went out, and closed the door.""Nonsense. No, Polly!"" cried Jasper, with a quick hand detaining her, ""it's nothing but a mere scratch, I tell you, but I suppose it looks terribly. I'll go and wash it off. Run and tell his mother that Percy is found.""""Well, he was so frightened, of course he didn't know what to say,"" replied Jasper. ""And ashamed, too. He didn't care to show his head at home. I don't know as I blame him, Polly. Well, it's too bad about Phronsie's party, isn't it?"" added Jasper, mopping up his face as the two went down the hall.But Joel flatly declared that the first one that even so much as hinted that a single item of the arrangements for Phronsie's getting-well party should be changed, he'd make it disagreeable as only he knew how, for that one when he got up from his bed. ""Yes, sir!"" and he scolded, and fretted, and fussed, and laid down the law so generally to all, not excepting the doctor, that at last it was decided to let the party go on. Then he lay back against the pillows quite exhausted, but with a beatific face.""What's the use of being sick,"" said Joel reflectively, turning on his pillow, ""if you can't make people stand around, I'd like to know. Now that point's settled about Phronsie's party, won't you all go out? I'd like to speak to Father Fisher a moment.""""Well, see here, will you,"" said Joel, pointing to the table, the schoolbooks scattered as he had left them, ""pack those things all away in the closet on the shelf, you know, and put the rubbish on the floor there, back on the table?""And in the morning, no one told Phronsie what had happened the night before. She only knew that Joel was not very well, and was going to keep his room; all her pleadings to do something for him being set one side by Grandpapa's demands upon her instant attention whenever the idea suggested itself to her. And so the time wore along till the party began.""I didn't bring macaroons,"" said Cathie, ""as I really think that they wouldn't be good for Phronsie. Besides, I've forgotten how to make them, and our cook was cross and said I shouldn't come into her kitchen. But I bought a doll for Phronsie; my mother said it would be a great deal more sensible present,"" and she hugged the long box under her arm with great satisfaction.But afflictions like this were small to Polly now, and although for the next hour it rained dolls into Phronsie's puzzled hands, Polly helped her to thank the givers and to dispose them safely on neighboring chairs and tables and sofas.""My gift to my little granddaughter,"" taking especial care to emphasize the relationship, ""has always been a doll, I suppose you knew that, Cousin Eunice; and to try to procure one exactly like the one I have purchased, is very presuming in you, to say the least."""
"""Now, Phronsie,"" turning to her, ""you are to take that doll,"" pointing to a gorgeous affair reposing on the sofa, with Mrs. Algernon Chatterton's card attached to it, ""and go over to Mrs. Chatterton, and say, very distinctly, 'I cannot accept this gift;' mind you say it distinctly, Phronsie, that there may be no mistake in the future.""""You'll know it's for the best,"" Mr. King was repeating as he led the child to Mrs. Chatterton standing cold and silent at the end of the room, ""sometime, child, and then you'll thank me that I saved you from further annoyance of this sort. There, Cousin Eunice, is your gift,"" taking the doll from Phronsie's hand, and placing it in the long, jeweled one. ""My little granddaughter receives presents only from those who love her. All others are unwarranted, and must be returned.""""O my goodness me!"" exclaimed Alexia, tumbling back after the first and only glance, and nearly overturning Cathie who was looking over her shoulder. ""Polly Pepper, O dear me!"" Then she sat down on the floor and laughed till she cried.But Alexia was beyond stopping herself. And in between Candace's delighted recital how she combed ""de ha'r to take de curl out,"" and how ""ole Missus' ruffles was made into de clothes,"" came the peals of laughter that finally made every one in the room stop and look at the girls.""It's no use to lecture me,"" said Alexia, sitting straight as Candace's feet shuffled down the hall, and wiping her face exhaustedly. ""I know it was dreadful--O dear me! Don't anybody speak to me, or I shall disgrace myself again!""""Well, now, my dear, you've had Punch and Judy, and these nice children,"" waving his hand to indicate the delegation from the orphan asylum, ""have sung beautifully for you. Now what comes next, Phronsie?""""When gifts become burdensome they no longer are kindnesses,"" said Mr. King. ""Now, Phronsie, I have found out--never mind how; little birds, you now, sometimes fly around telling people things they ought to know. Well, I have discovered in some way that my little girl has too many children to care for.""""And when there are too many children in the nest, Phronsie, why, they have to go out into the world to try their fortunes and make other homes. Now there are so many poor little girls who haven't any children, Phronsie. Think of that, dear; and you have so many.""""I really do. You are going abroad to be gone--well, we'll say a year. And your dolls would be so lonely without anything to do but to sit all day and think of their little mother. And there are so many children who would love them and make them happy."" Now Mr. King's white hair was very near the yellow waves floating over his shoulder, so that none but Phronsie's ears caught the next words. ""It's right, Phronsie dear; I'd do it if I were you,"" he said in a low voice.""Come, then."" Old Mr. King set her on her feet. ""Clear the way there, good people; we are going to find some poor children who are waiting for dolls,"" and he threw wide the door into a back passage, and there, presided over by Jencks, and crowding for the first entrance, was a score of children with outstretched hands."
"""Well, now, Phronsie,"" exclaimed Mr. King, getting away from the support of the cabinet, ""I think it's time that we should make some of these children happy. Don't you want to take them up to the playroom and distribute the dolls?""""No, no,"" protested Phronsie suddenly. ""I must go up and tell my children. They will understand it better then, Grandpapa. I'll be back in a very few minutes,"" and going out she went quickly upstairs, and after a while returned with both arms full.""This doll is for you,"" she said gravely, putting a doll attired in a wonderful pink satin costume into Jane's arms. ""I've told her about your dog, and she's a little frightened, so please be careful.""So persuaded, the two boys stole out into the hall in time to see Phronsie go down the stairs with her armful, and carefully using their ears they soon rushed back with ""Phronsie's giving away her dolls!""""He's the very one that proposed it,"" said Mrs. Fisher. ""There, Joey, don't get excited, for I don't know what the doctor will say,"" as Joel sank back on his pillow, overcome by this last piece of news.""Grandpapa, dear,"" she said confidingly as they went up the stairs together, ""do you know I really think more of this doll, now that the others are gone? Really I do, Grandpapa, and I can take better care of her, because I shall have more time.""""I think my children will be happy,"" said Phronsie with a small sigh, ""because you see it's so nice to make good times for their new mothers. And, Grandpapa, I couldn't play with each one more than once a week. I used to try to, but I couldn't, Grandpapa.""""Ah, but,"" said Phronsie, slowly shaking her head, ""I didn't want to give them away before; only just now, Grandpapa, and I think they will be happy. And now I'm going to take this newest one to bed, just as I used to take things to bed years ago, when I was a little girl.""And after all, there was an extension of time for the three boys' vacation, Dr. Marks not getting up from his sudden attack of fever as quickly as was expected. But there came a day at last, when Percy, Van and David bade Joel ""good-by.""""Keep still, will you?"" cried Van, his irritation getting beyond bounds. ""What's the use of talking about a thing till it's done,"" which had the effect to make Percy remember his promise to Polly and close his mouth.But Joel's wound healed quicker than any one supposed it possibly could, and Percy and Van, who both hated to write letters, gave up much time on the playground to indite daily bulletins, so that he declared that it was almost as good as being there on the spot. And Mother Fisher and her army of servants cleaned the great stone house from top to bottom, and sorted, and packed away, and made things tidy for the new housekeeper who was to care for them in her absence, till Dr. Fisher raised his eyebrows and hands in astonishment.And Polly set herself at all her studies, especially French, with redoubled vigor, notwithstanding that she was hampered with the faithful attentions of the schoolgirls who fought among themselves for her company, and showered her with pathetic ""O--dear--me--ow--I--shall--miss--you,"" and with tears when they got over it. And Jasper buried himself in his den, only bursting forth at meal times, and Mrs. Whitney bemoaned all preparations for the travelers' departure, and wished a thousand times that she had not given her promise to keep the house and look after the boys. And everybody who had the slightest claim to a calling acquaintance, now dropped in upon the Kings, and Polly had her ""good-by party,"" and it was pronounced perfectly elegant by Alexia and her set, and the three boys came home for the long vacation--and in two days the party would sail.""NO!"" thundered Mr. King. ""Oh! how stupid people can be when they want to. Two persons are to meet us in New York to-morrow. I didn't tell you till I was sure; I had no desire that you should be disappointed. Now guess again."""
"""How any one can desire to cross the ocean,"" remarked Mr. Whitney, folding his hands back of his head and regarding meditatively the glowing fire, ""is more than I can see. That I never shall do it again unless whipped over, I'm morally certain.""""The other is a woman,"" said Mr. King. ""Well, what are their names? Isn't anybody smart enough to guess them? Dear me, I've always said that the Peppers were remarkably bright, and the rest of you children are not behind other young people. Go on, try again. Now who are they?""""They were kind to Dicky and to you,"" said her father; ""and besides, Marian, Mr. Henderson is a man who doesn't preach at you only once a week, and Mrs. Henderson is a fine woman. So it's a pity not to ease up things for them now and then. Well, how do you like the plan?"" He spoke to Dr. Fisher, but his gaze took them all in.""Immensely,"" said the little doctor; which being again echoed heartily by all the rest, old Mr. King began to feel very much elated at his part in the proceedings, and in a quarter of an hour it seemed as if the expedition had been especially planned for the benefit of the Hendersons, so naturally had it all come about.And Alexia Rhys persuaded her aunt to do her semi-annual shopping at this time, and to take her too; and Mr. Alstyne also had business that necessitated his going, and Mr. Cabot and Mary Taylor, and her father found they must go along too; and Hamilton Dyce was there, and Pickering Dodge, of course, went to be company for Ben on the way back. And at the last moment who should jump on the train but Livingston Bayley.And Cousin Eunice Chatterton went; for, at the last minute, she had suddenly discovered that she had visited at the gray stone mansion as long as she cared to, and notified the family accordingly. And Mr. King had so far made up for his part in the late unpleasantness as to ask her to go with the party, on her way to her nephew's in the city. So there she was with the others, bidding them good-by on the steamer.""Phronsie,"" she said slowly, under cover of the babel of tongues, ""you are a good child, and I've done well by you. This little bit of paper,"" putting it into her hands, ""contains a message to Mr. King, which you are to give him after you have started.""""No, no,"" said Mrs. Chatterton sharply, ""do as I say. Remember, on no account to let any one see it till after you have started. You are a good child, Phronsie. Now, remember to do as you are bidden. And now, will you kiss me, child?""""And one thing more,"" said Mrs. Whitney in a low voice, ""when you feel badly,"" looking steadily at Polly and the three boys, ""remember what Dr. Fisher said; that if your mother didn't stop working, and rest, she would break down.""Young Mr. Bayley smiled indulgently as he could not help reading the card thrust into the flowers. ""She will receive my flowers at intervals all the way over, if the steward doesn't fail me,"" he reflected with satisfaction, ""while this boy's will fade in an hour.""""I believe you are Miss Mary Pepper,"" said young Bayley. ""Pretty, aren't they?"" fingering the roses, and glad to think that there were orchids among the flowers to which his card was attached, and just placed under the steward's care."
