A Crazy Christmas 124 IX. Milly visiting 139 X. Blackdrop 155 XI. Flaxie a Comfort 167 XII. Brave Preston Gray 178Auntie Prim looked as if one kiss would be more than she could bear. She was standing by the pantry window that opened upon the garden, rolling out pie-crust, and didn't like to be disturbed. She was a very good woman, but she _never_ liked to be disturbed.""Yes, and her grammy said--"" Little Milly got as far as this and then stopped. Flaxie was her darling ""twin cousin,"" and she wanted to help her; but that tall lady with the rolling-pin was just dreadful.""Oh, now I remember,"" said Mrs. Prim, paring off the dough around the edge of a pie. ""Your mother did say, if you were a good girl all the week, you might have a few children here to tea. But _have_ you been a good girl, Mary Gray?"" added she, with a look through her spectacles that pierced her little niece to the soul.""That child can't be trusted to do the smallest errand correctly,"" thought Auntie Prim, taking down the cook-book, with a sigh, and looking at the recipes for cake. Her husband was in Canada, and she had kindly offered to spend a month or so at Dr. Gray's while his wife went away for her health. This would have been very pleasant, only Julia went with her mother, and little Flaxie was always troublesome without Julia.Mrs. Prim had said that morning to Dora that she would go into the pantry and make three apple-pies, for she knew how to make them better than Dora; and then she must finish writing her lecture on Ancient History. And now Flaxie Frizzle had come and asked for a party! Mrs. Prim was called a ""superior woman,"" and knew more than almost anybody else in town except the minister; but she did think children very trying, and their parties ""perfectly absurd."" Besides, Flaxie wasn't her own niece.Then Auntie Prim made out a list of ten little girls, for the table would seat twelve, and she wanted the party large enough to please Flaxie. She thought she would make some of her own delicious tarts and a nice sponge roll, and Dora might mix White Mountain cake and boil a tongue. Mrs. Prim meant to be very kind, though she was sure, if she had had any little girls of her own, they would never have had any parties!But wasn't it gay times for the twin cousins, who had all the fun and none of the worry! I wish I were a little girl, just going to have a party, don't you? They didn't stop to look at the beautiful trees, with their bright October leaves, or at the sky, with its soft white clouds; they hopped along, their arms around each other's waist, keeping time to the happy thoughts in their hearts."
"The first house was General Townsend's; and when Mrs. Townsend came to the door, Milly hid behind a lilac-bush; but Flaxie, who was never afraid of anybody, looked up with her laughing blue eyes, and said, without stopping for 'How d'ye do?'--It was surprising how fast Flaxie said it over: ""I'm goin' to have a party six years old,"" &c., without skipping a word; and though Milly had her doubts about the politeness of Mrs. Prim's being so ""thankful,"" she did think Flaxie Frizzle was a wonderful girl; and indeed Flaxie thought so too.""I said,"" replied Miss Frizzle, proud to have made no mistakes this time, ""I said, 'I'm goin' to have a party six years old, and Auntie Prim says for the children to come early,--at ha' pas' two,--and she'll be _thankful_ when it's over.'""""Mary Gray,"" said she, pressing her hands together quite sticky with dough, ""I didn't mean you to repeat the last part of that speech; I didn't even know you had heard it. It does seem to me you are old enough to have a _little_ sense of propriety. What can those ladies think of me? What can they think of _you_? I shouldn't blame them if they didn't let their children come, after such an invitation as that!""Flaxie hung her head. What had _she_ done so very wrong? She could never bear to be blamed; and I must relate that she was rude enough to slip out of the house while her aunt was still speaking, followed by Milly.""Hope they won't!"" said Flaxie, stamping her foot so hard that a ""hop-toad"" thought there was an earthquake, and hurried out of the way. ""Hope they won't, any of 'em! I'm not agoin' to go to it myself,--so there!""""You think I don't dare,"" said Flaxie; ""but I do dare! I'm agoin' right off in the woods, and stay there! And I _thought_ you's agoin' with me. You're my twin cousin, and it's your party as much as 'tis mine.""Milly knew this was very wrong, and ought to have said so to Flaxie. If they had already done one foolish thing, it would make it no better to do another foolish thing, as _you_ can see in a moment. But Milly wanted to please Flaxie, so she said stoutly:Silly children! Flaxie pretended she was running away from her party, but she didn't mean to _stay_ away. Oh, no! She wouldn't have missed the party for anything. Even now she was beginning to wonder what Dora was baking.""No, it hasn't. But we ought to brought a imbreller; it's goin' to rain,"" replied Flaxie, holding out her hand to catch a drop. ""I didn't spect you'd be so 'fraid, Milly Allen; but if you _are_ afraid, we'll go right home this minute."""
"They turned, but the wrong way, and instead of going home, only struck deeper into the woods. They didn't see the sky at all, and all the light seemed to come from the gay leaves and the gold of Flaxie's hair; for I am sorry to say she had lost her hat.""Well, then, what made you hide behind the lilac-bush, and not invite the folks, Milly Allen?"" exclaimed Flaxie, feeling obliged to scold _somebody_; and then she too began to scream, though nobody heard, for they were three or four miles from the village.Thoroughly tired at last and discouraged, the poor babes in the wood lay down and fell asleep in each other's arms. I know it was a pretty sight,--the black head and the golden head so close together, and the beautiful bright trees bending over to say, ""Good night.""He and half a dozen other lads had been out all the afternoon in search of the little wanderers, and here it was five o'clock. They carried them home on their backs, taking turns, and Flaxie looked up only once to ask sleepily:But Mrs. Prim was a just woman, and she thought poor little Flaxie's punishment had been hard enough. Her party was over long ago; the guests hadn't stayed to supper, and had gone home saying they ""didn't think Flaxie was very polite,"" and they ""wouldn't go to her parties any more."" And here she was, tired and wretched, and scratched all over by blackberry bushes. No, Auntie Prim didn't even scold. She merely looked through her spectacles at grandma, and said, ""Children are so absurd!""Dear little Milly heard this, and remembered it, and repeated it to her mother the next week when she went home to Hilltop. She thought _she_ had suffered so much that she should never be ""absurd"" again, even to please her beloved Flaxie Frizzle.You would have thought she had enough left to make her happy. Dr. Gray's house stood on a hill facing the river, with a green yard in front, and a stable and two gardens behind it. It was all beautiful, and Flaxie enjoyed the stable as well as the fruit and flower gardens, for she was very fond of the horses, Whiz and Hiawatha, and the cows and the hens. You needn't tell anybody, but I do pity children who never hunted for hens' nests: it is such capital fun! And then there was the handsome dog, Tantra-Bogus, one of Flaxie's best friends.In the house she had her ""splendid Dr. Papa;"" her dear brother Preston, who could whittle all sorts of things with a penknife; her darling Grandma Gray, an old lady with white hair, white cap, and white ribbons; and last, but not least, she had the ""beautifullest baby"" Philip, who could stand on his head ""just as cunning,"" and ""hug grizzly""--that is, like a grizzly bear. Flaxie loved him with her whole heart, but there were moments when she felt half ashamed of him, for he was eighteen months old, and hadn't a sign of a tooth; wasn't it awful?""No,"" replied Mrs. Prim, who sat by the window, with her little ebony work-box on a stand beside her. ""Your brother Preston says very absurd things merely in sport; but you must not be so foolish as to believe them.""Mrs. Prim looked surprised. She did not know that Flaxie really _had_ believed in those gold teeth, and had been comforted by thinking how Phil would outshine everybody by-and-by! And now the poor little girl was crying because it was all a mistake, and because Mrs. Prim had said she was ""foolish.""""Good pussy, pretty pussy,"" said grandma, stroking the cat, who almost purred her heart out for joy. Not a mouse did she ever catch but she brought it to grandma or mamma to show it; but she never brought one to Mrs. Prim. I wonder why not."
"""Should you?"" said Grandma Gray, hesitating, and patting her white curls. ""Her mother said there were some naughty children about here, and she might be led into mischief at school, while Julia is away.""""Oh, auntie,"" said Flaxie, shaking her flying hair, ""I saw a little girl down under the hill, and says I, 'What's your name?' and says she, 'Patty C. Proudfit.' And I thought you'd want me to go down and play with her, and I did.""This was the first Mrs. Prim had ever heard of ""Patty C. Proudfit,"" and grandma knew nothing about her either; but Preston said the Proudfit family had just moved into town, ""a whole army of 'em, and lived in that black house under the hill.""Next day, as Mrs. Prim was looking out of the window, she saw Flaxie and Miss Patty playing dolls under the trees. Patty was two years older than Flaxie, but her red hair had not been combed lately, her dress was torn, and her shoes were out at the toes.Flaxie knew why. It was because she ought to help amuse the baby. Dora had been making peach preserves all day, and it was too hard for Grandma Gray to take care of Phil alone. But Flaxie asked all the same, ""May I go?"" and grandma never could say ""no"" when little folks teased, so she answered, ""Yes, and stay till half-past four; no longer.""""Very well,"" said Patty's mother, when they went into the smoky kitchen, where she was holding the baby that had four teeth. ""Very well, you may both run out to play, and when it is time to call you in, I'll ring the bell.""There wasn't much to play with, except sand right in the middle of the road; but Flaxie had never been allowed as much dirt as she wanted, and this seemed very pleasant for a change. It would have been pleasanter still if her conscience had felt easy. She was only six years old, but she knew perfectly well when her actions were right and when they were wrong.""I never saw such a splendid visit,"" said she, when Mr. Proudfit kindly allowed her and Patty to feed the pigs. ""But _don't_ they have the awfullest-looking smell?"" added she, gazing thoughtfully into the pen, which was dirty, like everything else about the place. Her own nice frock was already soiled, but she tried not to see it, and not to think how Auntie Prim would stare at it through her spectacles.So Flaxie went back and stayed another hour, and _then_ it wasn't tea-time. She could see some blue and white dishes spread on a round table covered with an oil-cloth, and she could smell gingerbread baking in the oven, which made her very hungry; and just as Mrs. Proudfit was opening a can of preserves, with at least six children clinging to her skirts, who should come but Preston, to say it was half-past five and Flaxie was wanted at home.Nothing seemed half as nice as it had seemed an hour ago; and when supper was ready, that gingerbread was burnt, and, as true as you live, the preserves were sour! There was nothing in the little covered dish but cheese, which Flaxie ""despised;"" and she wished she hadn't stayed to tea, for it was a very poor tea indeed.When she got home there was mamma, looking grieved and surprised,--the dear mamma she hadn't seen for three weeks. And there was ""Ninny,"" her sweet sister Julia, who had come and found out about her actions, and brought her a new doll."
"Flaxie came down to breakfast next morning feeling rather humble, but nobody noticed her, for they were all talking about the cat. The cellar-door had been left unfastened, and Kitty Gray had come up about midnight bringing a nice fat mouse. She mewed a long time, hoping her mistress would get out of bed and stroke her, and say, ""Good pussy, pretty pussy!"" But as Mrs. Gray would not rise, what do you think Kitty Gray did, for this is a true story?Of course when Mrs. Gray saw such a droll morsel lying on her napkin she laughed, sent for Kitty Gray, stroked her, and called her ""Good pussy, pretty pussy; and the brightest pussy too that I ever saw!""""One, two, three, four, five,"" said Flaxie to herself, counting the rosebuds in the carpet. Strange her mamma should suppose she wanted to talk about it! Why, there wasn't a subject in the world so disagreeable as her own naughtiness!""Mary,"" said Mrs. Gray,--she thought her little daughter was old enough now to be called by her true name, so she never used the baby name of Flaxie Frizzle,--""Mary, I do not wish you to play any more with this little girl till I have seen her.""""I don' know. Well, yes. Well, I--I--I am so sorry I ran away from my party, mamma. Ever so long ago. I s'pect Auntie Prim told of that too?"" said Flaxie, twisting herself into odd shapes, for the thought of that unfortunate affair filled her with shame.""Well, I felt so sorry, mamma. And Milly 'n' I, we didn't get but one tart and one piece o' cake; for auntie had a party with 'em her own self. Do you think 'twas right when she made 'em for Milly and me?""""Oh dear, I don't like to! I s'pect you think I don't try to be good; but, mamma, I do! I try real hard. But,"" said the little girl, patting her chest and her side, ""there's something in me that's naughty clear through.""The tears had come now and were dropping over the little fat hands, for in spite of her queer way of talking, Flaxie felt really unhappy about her bad conduct; though perhaps nobody but her mother would have believed it.After this, Flaxie was one of the most charming little girls you ever saw for two whole months. She said it was because Mrs. Prim was gone; but of course it was simply because she tried harder to be good; that was all. Toward the last of the winter, Uncle Ben Allen, Milly's father, passed through Laurel Grove on business, and spent the night at Dr. Gray's.Now he knew very well which he wanted, but it wouldn't have been polite to say so; he wanted Julia. He had always admired her gentle ways, and her sweet patience with her trying sister Flaxie, and had often told his wife that he loved Julia because she was ""like a little candle."" Perhaps you will know what he meant, for I dare say you have learned these lines at Sabbath school:Uncle Ben tried to look delighted when he heard Flaxie was going; but it was not till her valise had been packed and she stood by the window prepared for the journey, that he happened to remember it wasn't a good time to take her to Hilltop, for Milly was gone!"
"""That is,"" said Uncle Ben, ""perhaps she is gone. When I left home, a week ago, her mother was talking of sending her to Troy, to her Aunt Sarah's: but I declare I had forgotten all about it till this minute.""Mr. Allen was a man of business, and very forgetful, or he could not have made such a blunder as this. And there was Flaxie's new and elegant doll, Christie Gretchen, all packed in cotton, in a box by itself, on purpose to show Cousin Milly.When they reached Hilltop, Milly _was_ gone. Aunt Charlotte was looking for Uncle Ben, but when he alighted from the carriage there was a glimmer of blue and gold, and Flaxie Frizzle appeared, borne aloft in his arms. Aunt Charlotte ran to the door very much surprised.""I don't care a speck if Milly _is_ gone. I've brought a new dolly to show you,"" cried Flaxie, whirling Aunt Charlotte's head around as if it had been a revolving globe, and kissing her under the left ear.""Well, we'll have nice times here,"" returned Aunt Charlotte; but her tone was doubtful. She knew how suddenly Flaxie sometimes changed from one mood to another; and what could she do with such a wayward little guest, when Milly was gone?She had been here two or three times before, and knew her way all over the house: it was a double-house, with another family in the other part. She remembered Aunt Charlotte's pictures, and vases, and ship-thermometer, and the tidy with a donkey on it drinking from a trough. She had spoiled two of the albums when she was a _little_ girl, and broken ever so much china; so you see she had reason to feel quite at home at Aunt Charlotte's. Ah, but she had never been there before without her mother!The afternoon did seem rather long, but Aunt Charlotte told funny stories, and after a great while the boys came home from school, and there was a jolly game of romps. Flaxie thought she was very happy.""We are doing better with her than I expected,"" said Aunt Charlotte to her husband next morning, when the bright face beamed on them at breakfast. ""I'm so glad you brought her, for I do miss my little Milly.""Flaxie, too, missed Milly, but was resolved to be a little woman, and said to Christie Gretchen privately, ""_We_ won't cry."" After breakfast she spent two hours in the kitchen with patient Nancy, spatting out little ginger cakes, and picking dirt from the cracks of the floor with a pin. Then she danced off to the sitting-room to play with the baby, telling him ""if he'd be goody, he'd grow up a doctor, like my papa."" She had promised the same thing to every boy baby at Laurel Grove, for doctors were the best people in the world, she thought, and best of all was Dr. Papa.She was as happy as ever, and singing merrily in the front yard, when the boys came home at noon. The moment she saw them she felt perfectly forlorn, and it suddenly seemed to her as if she couldn't live any longer without Milly. That wasn't the worst of it; she _knew_ she couldn't live any longer without her mother.It was a terrible feeling that swept all at once over little Flaxie. I wonder if _you_ ever had it? If not, you can't understand it: it was _homesickness_. There is no ache or pain like it in the whole world, and it seemed to tingle all through Flaxie, from her head to her feet. She ran into the sitting-room, ready to scream. ""Oh, auntie, I feel so bad; I feel bad all over!"""
"Then Aunt Charlotte was full of sympathy, for she knew the dreadful suffering Flaxie spoke of was homesickness. It seemed strange that it should have seized her so suddenly,--but Flaxie was sudden about everything.""Why, my precious one,"" said Mrs. Allen, taking the unhappy child in her lap, ""you know Milly is coming home next week, and in one week more Dr. Papa will send for you to go home. Two weeks won't be long.""""I think Flaxie and I will take a ride in the cars to-morrow,"" said she. ""I think we'll go to Chicopee to see Mrs. Adams, who has some gold-fishes, and a parrot, and a canary. How would you like that, Flaxie?""""Oh, it _is_ Saturday, Freddy Allen! Don't I know what day I came here? I came Friday. Didn't I hear Ninny and mamma talk about it, and don't I _know_?"" screamed the wretched child, hopping up and down, then falling, face downward, on the rug. ""Oh, I can't bear it; I _can't_ bear it! There, don't anybody in this town know what day it is! Nobody knows it but me!""This was funny enough to Freddy, but very painful to his mother, who knew the deep trouble at the little girl's heart. Of course Flaxie didn't care a bit what day of the week it was; she only felt so very unhappy that she could not endure the slightest contradiction.Before another word had been spoken, she sprang up and flew out of the room. About two minutes afterward the front door slammed, and Freddy saw her dashing down street with her hat and cloak on, swinging her valise in one hand and her umbrella in the other.""Why, certainly,"" said the man, winking to Johnny and Freddy, who had reached the platform and stood there panting. ""_To_ be sure! We let little girls go to their mothers. But you didn't think of starting on ahead of the cars, did you?""""The cars won't be here till two o'clock,"" said the baggage-man. ""Now I'd advise a nice little lady like you to eat your dinner before starting on a journey. Or would you like it any better to have me lock you up in the ladies'-room till two o'clock? But I should think you'd get rather hungry.""Johnny spoke with such a show of indifference that Flaxie was struck by it. He was ten years old, just the age of her brother Preston, and had had some experience in managing children younger than himself. As he was walking off with Freddy, she trudged after, exclaiming:"
"""Hush, Freddy,"" said mamma, for Flaxie's lips were quivering, ""we'll have our dinner now, and then I am going to Chicopee to see Mrs. Adams, who has the gold-fishes and parrot and canary. Flaxie may go with me if she likes.""Flaxie brightened a little at this, and thought she wouldn't go home to see her mother to-day; she would wait till to-morrow. Still her heart ached now and then just as hard as ever, and when she was riding in the cars that afternoon to Chicopee with her aunt beside her and her second-best dolly in her arms, she did look the picture of woe.""How do you do, Mrs. Chase?"" said Aunt Charlotte, making room for the mother and baby by taking Flaxie in her lap; then turning over the seat just in front of them for the two little girls. ""I think it will be a good thing for my niece, Flaxie Frizzle, to see your children, Mrs. Chase.""Hattie was a bright child of six, just her own age; but the lame girl of ten, what a white face she had! What very light, straw-colored hair! Her manners were odd, Flaxie thought, for as soon as she saw the doll Peppermint Drop, she snatched at her and would have pulled off her blue satin sash if Flaxie had not drawn it away.Then Lucy leaned forward again, and fingered the buttons on Aunt Charlotte's dress, and stroked her fur cloak, with a smile. That was a queer thing for such a large girl to do, but Aunt Charlotte did not seem to mind it, and only said, ""I fancy Lucy wants a lozenge,"" and popped one into her mouth as if she had been a baby. Flaxie stared, and the mother said, with a sad smile:""Oh dear, why doesn't she?"" said Flaxie, forgetting her own trouble in gazing at the strange little girl, who was now stroking Aunt Charlotte's cloak again, as if she did not hear a word that was said. ""Why doesn't she know but little?""""Oh, it isn't Sunday, and I _didn't_ come Friday, and I _can_ wait two weeks to see my mamma. You see I didn't know there was a little girl I could make mittens for, or I shouldn't have cried,"" said Flaxie, stopping a moment to kiss the baby.The mittens were lovely. Aunt Charlotte finished them off at the wrists with a tufted border. Lucy couldn't say ""thank you,"" but her poor mother was delighted, and fastened them to the child's cloak by a string, so they wouldn't be lost.She was such a restless, impatient little girl that it wasn't best to let her know till the last minute what a beautiful thing had happened at home. But the next morning, when her hat and cloak were on, Aunt Jane told her she had a dear, new little baby sister, three days old!""Oh, good-bye, Uncle Ben, good-bye! I don't know what her name is, but there's a little sister at home, and I must go right off in the cars. I _wish_ I had some _seven-legged_ boots! Good-bye, Uncle Ben.""It was all beautiful, only Flaxie wanted to have a ""talk"" with mamma, but nurse said, ""You'd better go down-stairs to play;"" and then, not long after supper, she said again, ""And now you'd better go to bed!"""
"""I didn't tell anybody--much,"" returned Flaxie. ""I thought 'twasn't polite. And then auntie bought me some red worsteds, and I made some mittens for a sick girl named Lucy, that can't wipe her mouth, or go to school, or talk; and it made me just as happy!""""No, mamma. When I said I'd go there to school with Milly I didn't know about my baby sister. I ought to stay and take care of her, and never go away any more as long as I live,--not till I die, and go to heaven.""But three months passed, and Flaxie had forgotten all this. She was always fond of the baby, whose name was Ethel Gray; but sometimes she thought Ethel needn't cry quite so much, and ought to cut a tooth, and ought to have more hair.The world looked dark to Flaxie, for she was sick that spring, and a long while getting well. It was a queer sort of illness too. First it made her look yellow and then pea-green, and Julia had to sing and smile a great deal in order to keep her at all comfortable.""Oh, mamma, do lemme go to Aunt Charlotte's, and go to school with Milly; she has such a dear teacher! And Milly's my twin cousin, born just the same month. And I won't be cross if they _don't_ give me enough to eat; and I'll take a whole bushel o' pills!""""You see Uncle Ben will be there to meet me when we get to Hilltop,"" said Miss Frizzle, fluttering her darling umbrella against the captain's spectacles; ""and won't he laugh when he sees me coming all alone, with a check in my pocket?""""Oh, it's where Uncle Ben lives and Aunt Charlotte,"" replied the little traveller, who had a vague idea that the house was in the middle of a snow-drift, with roses in the front yard and strawberries behind it. ""Their name is Allen.""Flaxie smiled and looked at her check. She felt the whole care of the journey, but it didn't trouble her at all, for the captain would tell her when to stop. She ""'membered"" all about Hilltop just as well as could be, but she didn't _'xactly_ know where it was!It was a pleasant ride on that beautiful spring day, and the captain would have been very agreeable, only he seemed to have a perfect horror of ""pinnuts,"" the very things Flaxie had dreamed about and expected to eat all the way. He shook his head at the peanut boys, and told her he ""wished they would keep away with their trash!"" If he had only gone into a smoking-car and left her, she might have bought some, for she had her red portemonnaie with her; but then he never thought of leaving her, for he really had no idea she was travelling alone.She had said Uncle Ben would laugh at meeting her; and so he did. He threw up both hands and cried, ""Bless me! what's all this?"" for it is not every day one sees a little girl of just that color; but he looked sober the next minute.Then Flaxie drove off with her uncle in the nice easy carriage, and found Aunt Charlotte and all her cousins delighted to see her, as she had known they would be. She had told the captain they were ""elegant cousins;"" but when Johnny exclaimed, ""Hullo! Miss Frizzle, you look like a pickled lime,"" she blushed a sort of pinkish-green blush, and thought he had grown very disagreeable."
"""Well, I shan't have to make mittens or anything this time, 'cause you're at home, Milly. I like to be with my twin cousin in a twin house,"" said Flaxie, twisting her neck to look at Mrs. Hunter's door-stone. It was just like Aunt Charlotte's, only there were flower-pots on it.There was no doubt about it. I really suppose Miss Pike was one of the ugliest women in the whole state. Her eyes were small and half shut; her mouth was large and half open; her nose was enormous, and turned up at the end,--and, to crown the whole, it was red!Milly, who had always known her, did not mind her looks. Indeed, so little can children judge of the beauty of those they love, that I dare say she might have thought her dear teacher quite handsome if she had not heard everybody speak of her as ""that homely Miss Pike.""""I can't help it if you don't,"" returned Milly, slipping her cousin off her lap with much indignation. ""God made her so, and my mamma says you mustn't notice how anybody looks when they have a beautiful soul.""Flaxie kept her word, and Milly went off next morning half crying; but little Freddy confided to his mother that _he_ was ""glad Flaxie wouldn't go to school, for the scholars would laugh at her, true as you live.""It was rather dull, all alone with Aunt Charlotte and little Ken, who was cutting his teeth and cried a great deal; but Flaxie held out for a whole week. This was fortunate, as it gave time for the greenish color to fade out of her face, and her own natural pink and white to come back again as beautiful as ever.""I guess I _will_ go to school with you, Milly, if you want me to so much,"" said she at last one morning, when her cousins had all stopped teasing her. ""I just despise Miss Pike, but I like the one that has the dropsies, and I want to hear her sing.""The schoolhouse was white, with green blinds, and stood on the bank of the river, shaded by trees. Burdocks, milkweed, rushes, dandelions, and buttercups, were sprinkled around, while close down by the river was a narrow strip of clay bank, very nice to cut into with penknives,--as you would think if you had seen the pretty images some of the children made and spread out on boards in the sun.Inside the schoolhouse it was nice and cool, with a large entry and recitation-room, and flowers on the desks and tables. The teacher, ""that homely Miss Pike,"" moved about softly, and spoke in low, sweet tones, smiling, and showing even white teeth.Somehow there was a happy feeling all over the schoolroom because Miss Pike was in it, and Flaxie's thoughts grew pleasant, she could not have told why. But one thing she did know, she wanted to be a good girl,--not pretty good, but the very best in the world,--that that sweet woman might love her.Milly and Flaxie were the best scholars, so Miss Pike told Aunt Charlotte. But they did not study all the time. Oh, no. Miss Pike understood children, and didn't _expect_ them to study all the time. She often drew pictures on the blackboard for them to copy on the slate, and if they wanted to bring their dinners and play at noon she was perfectly willing; only they were not to scream too loud, or go near the desks, for fear of spilling the ink. She noticed that the little girls were more noisy after Flaxie Frizzle came; but this was not strange, for Flaxie knew a great many games that the Hilltop children had never heard of before.""See there, Milly,"" said she, pointing to a high pile of boards behind the schoolhouse, under one of the windows. ""A man has gone and put those down there, and now let's make a house of 'em, and live in it!""Milly hugged Flaxie, it was such a bright idea. Make a house? Of course they would! They had made cupboards out of shingles and stones, and put clay dishes on the shelves; they had dug ovens all along the bank like swallows' nests; but a real live house, what could be so charming as that?"
"But when you came to think of it, it wasn't what you might call easy work, for the boards were very heavy; and with all their tugging the little girls could only drag them a little way across the ground.She knew they couldn't coax Freddy quite as well as they could Johnny. The little girls never once thought of asking who owned the boards, but I will tell you; it was Esquire Blake, and he was intending to use them to repair his office, which stood not far from the schoolhouse.Johnny thought it all nonsense, but consented to undertake the business. He drove four stakes into the ground, near a beautiful maple-tree, and then nailed boards on the stakes all around, making a pen about three feet high. Everybody looked on deeply interested. After that he and Freddy went fishing. The little girls felt very impatient.Next day it rained; but the day after, as Johnny could get no peace of his life, he nailed on more boards, till the pen was so high you couldn't see over it, unless you stood on tiptoe. That was high enough; but where was the roof?That amused good-natured Johnny, and he called together some of the boys, to help him put on a sloping roof. Then he sawed a door in the side next the river; and when all was done the building looked so much like a ""truly house"" that the little girls screamed for joy, and Johnny felt rather proud of his work.The girls were charmed, and wanted a fireplace immediately. Why not? That wasn't much to make, and they made it themselves with the loose pieces of brick they picked out of the old hearth in the recitation-room.Squire Blake knew nothing of this; neither did the teacher. The new and elegant building was located on the bank behind the schoolhouse, and as the windows that way let in the sun, the blinds were kept closed, and Miss Pike did not look out. If she had only looked out! But then perhaps she wouldn't have thought much about it; for who would dream of little daughters of respectable parents bringing matches to school?It might be very funny to light a fire on one's own little hearth, and bake one's own little biscuits for tea; but then it was certainly wrong. If it hadn't been wrong, why didn't the little girls tell of it at home? What made Flaxie seize a bunch of matches from the kitchen-shelf and hide them in her pocket? What made Milly snatch that piece of dough when Nancy's back was turned, and run away with it so fast? Children are never sly, you know, when they are doing right.If these biscuits turned out well, they were to bake some more to-morrow, and have what Johnny called a ""house-warming,"" and Freddy had partly promised some fish. But this was only the very first day of housekeeping, and they had invited nobody but Ada Blake to tea,--Ada and her dolls.It seemed as if recess would never come that afternoon, and when it came it wasn't ""any longer than your little finger."" The fire was kindled the very first minute, the thimble-biscuits rolled out, and then the three children sat on the grass around their hearth to watch the baking. Seven dolls sat there too, with their party-dresses on, waiting very politely. There was a dictionary in the middle of the room for a table, with a pocket-handkerchief spread on it for a table-cloth, and Milly had set out all her best dishes there at noon, with a dot of butter, a pinch of sugar, and some bits of cake."
"There was wisdom in Ada's voice, and wisdom in her superior smile. Flaxie raised her eyes, but that smile was too much for her, and she dropped them again. If there was one thing Flaxie could not bear, it was to be laughed at by a girl of her own age, who knew more than she did.Miss Pike was a most sensible young lady, and knew better than to scream; but I assure you she never felt more like screaming in her life. The ""house that Jack built"" was all ablaze from top to bottom, and had already set fire to the schoolhouse!She had to think fast. There were sixty children to be got out, and no time to lose. If they should know the house was on fire they would be crazed with fright and run hither and thither like wild creatures; it would never do to let them know it.Miss Sarah was at the farther end of the room setting copies slowly, very slowly. She did not look up, and Miss Pike had no time to go and speak to her; the only thing she could do was to walk quietly up to the desk and ring the bell. That meant, ""Put up your books."" A strange order while a class was reciting; but it was obeyed instantly.""Star-spangled Banner,"" said Miss Pike, calmly. She could see the little tongues of flame running along the ceiling now, but she looked as if she was thinking of nothing but music and waiting for Miss Sarah to pitch the tune. Miss Sarah dropped her pen and did it of course, wondering why; and all the sixty voices joined in it, clear and loud, as they had often done before; while in time to the music the whole sixty children marched in orderly file out of the room.She had a pail of water in her hand. The children rushed through the streets screaming; the bells began to ring; the Hilltop fire-engine came out; and all the people and horses and dogs in the village. But Miss Pike was the first to pour water on the flames, and everybody said it was she who saved the schoolhouse.There was a black hole in the wall, and another in the roof; the books were, many of them, soaked and ruined; the floor an inch deep with water, and it would take a whole week to set things to rights. But the schoolhouse was saved.""We've got something _orful_ to tell you,"" said she, her voice trembling; ""we baked our biscuits, and Johnny built a house out there with a stove-pipe in, and we oughtn't to taken any matches. You better believe we cried!""""Oh, Flaxie, _do_ you s'pose we've suffered enough?"" asked little Milly that night after they had said their prayers and were lying in bed looking at the pure soft moonlight which shone on the far-away hills.""I don't either,"" said Milly, sitting up in bed and speaking very earnestly. ""But don't you 'member what Auntie Prim said that time we ran away from the party? She said children ought to suffer for their naughtiness; it's the only way they can learn to behave better.""Two days after this Flaxie went home, and her little frizzled head was not seen at Hilltop any more till the next December. Then her dear Grandma Gray had rheumatic fever, and though Flaxie pitied her all she could, she made too much noise in the house, and had to be sent away. But I will tell you about that in the next chapter."
"""My dear Red Riding Hood, your grandmother is too sick to eat butter. Shut the door, walk very softly, and bring me my writing-desk. I'm going to write Aunt Charlotte, and ask her if she wants you at Hilltop.""""Oh, mamma, how elegant! Is it 'cause grandma's sick?"" cried Flaxie, dropping her wee, wee basket, butter and all. She ought to have been ashamed to find she was so noisy that she had to be sent away from home; but she never thought about that. She did try to keep still, but as she had said to Julia that very morning, ""there wasn't any still in her!"" ""Dear Twin Little Cousin: My Mamma is going to let me go to your House and go to school to your Dear teacher, becaus I make too much noise, and Grammy is sick with Something in her back and Ime glad but not unless your Mamma is willing. Wont you please to write and say so. My lines are unstraight, and its real too bad Good by FLAXIE FRIZZLE.""""Oh, I know better than that,"" explained Flaxie, blushing: ""we're not twins a bit, and couldn't be if we should try, and we've known it for quite a long time; but you see, mamma, we're _make-believing_, just for fun.""She always packed it, if there was the least thing said about going away. She didn't mind the trouble, it was such a pretty valise,--made of brown canvas, with leather straps like a trunk. And she knew Aunt Charlotte would want her at Hilltop,--people always do want little girls, and can't have too many of them,--and it was best to be ready in season.So she looked up her little umbrella, with F. F. painted on it in white letters, her school-books that she had been playing school with all over the house, and a half bushel or so of her best dolls. But as she did not go for a week, she had time to lose these things over and over, and some of them were never found any more.""Now, darling,"" said mamma, when Flaxie had bidden good-bye to papa and Preston, and Ninny and the baby, and was just entering the car behind her friend Mrs. Prim. ""Now, darling, don't be troublesome to dear Aunt Charlotte, and if you'll learn to be good and orderly and sweet like your Cousin Milly, I shall be so glad.""""Troublesome. Oh, my! 's if _I_ ever troubled anybody! 'Cept Grandma Gray; and that's 'cause she's got something in her back. But mamma _always_ thinks Milly is nicer than me! Queer what makes mammas _never_ like their own little girls!--I mean, not much. Now Aunt Charlotte thinks I'm the nicest. She scolds to Milly sometimes, but she don't scold to ME!""Hilltop had been green when Flaxie left it, but now it was white, and seemed lovelier than ever, for Johnny had a new sled, and was ""_such_ a kind-hearted boy!"" That is, he was always ready to draw the twin cousins on the ice till they were half frozen and begged him to stop, and I hardly see how he _could_ have been kinder than that!Then the school was ""perfickly elegant,"" taught by that same dear teacher, Miss Pike. What if her nose _was_ red, and her mouth so large that little Betty Chase called her ""the lady that can't shut her face""? She was just lovely for all that, and Flaxie and Milly couldn't forget that she had saved the schoolhouse when it was set on fire by mistake. After that she hadn't looked homely a minute,--only ""a beautiful homely,"" that is ever and ever so much better than handsome;--and the little girls fairly adored her."
"Now Flaxie was quick to learn, but as a general thing she didn't study very hard, I am obliged to confess. When she couldn't spell her lessons she said to Milly, ""It's 'cause you don't have the same kind of books we have where I live. The words look so queer in your books!""If Flaxie was noisy at Laurel Grove, what was she at Hilltop? Sometimes in the evening, when she played the piano and sang, Aunt Charlotte was really afraid she would disturb Mrs. Hunter, who lived in the other half of the house.But by and by there wasn't so much time for music and play. The busy season had begun, when everybody was making ready for Christmas; and the twin cousins had as much as they could do in talking over what they were _going_ to do, as they sat in each other's lap and looked at their work-baskets.Flaxie wanted to make a marvellous silk bedquilt for her dear mamma out of pieces as big as a dollar; but, finding there wouldn't be time for that, concluded to buy her a paper of needles, ""if it didn't cost too much.""Probably there wouldn't have been anything done but talking if Aunt Charlotte hadn't brought out some worsteds and canvas and set the helpless little ones at work upon a holder called the ""Country Cousin."" They had a hard time over this young lady, and almost wished sometimes that she had never been born; but she turned out very brilliant at last, in a yellow skirt, red waist, and blue bonnet, with a green parasol over her head. After this they had courage to make some worsted balls for the babies, some cologne mats for their brothers who never used cologne, and some court-plaster cases for somebody else, with the motto, ""I stick to you when others cut you.""Before Aunt Charlotte heard of the sad condition of her throat, she had said she might go with Milly and Johnny and some of the older children in the village, to see the ladies trim the church. But when Flaxie came into the parlor with her teeth chattering, Aunt Charlotte began to fear she ought not to go out.""Yes 'm, I am,"" replied Flaxie, with a doleful look around the corners of her mouth. ""This house isn't heated by steam like my house where I live, and I'm drefful easy to freeze!"" And her teeth chattered again.""I'm sorry, Flaxie, but there's a chill in the air like snow, and if your throat is sore it is much wiser for you to stay at home,"" said Aunt Charlotte, gently but firmly, like a good mother who is accustomed to be obeyed by her children.And poor Flaxie was obliged to submit, though it cut her to the heart when Milly gave her a light kiss and skipped away; and she did think it was cruel in Aunt Charlotte to advise her to go into the nursery and stay with Nancy and the baby. She wished she had never said a word about her throat.""It don't feel any worse'n a mosquito-bite,"" thought she, watching the gay party from the window,--half a dozen ladies and as many children; ""it don't hurt me to swallow either,""--swallowing her tears.""Hilltop's such a queer place! Not the least speck of steam in the houses! If they had steam, you could go anywhere, if your throat _was_ sore! And I never saw anybody trim a church; and oh, Milly says they'll have _beau_-tiful flowers, and crosses, and things! _I_ never saw anybody trim _anything_--'cept a loaf of cake and flowers on a bonnet.""Foolish Flaxie, to stand there winking tears into her eyes! _You_ would have known better; you would have gone into the nursery to play with that lovely baby; but there were times, I am sorry to say, when Flaxie really enjoyed being unhappy. So now she stood still, rolling her little trouble over and over, as boys roll a snowball, making it larger and larger, till presently it was as big as a mountain.""Auntie _said_ I might go, and then she wouldn't lemme! Made me stay at home to play with that ole baby! He's squirmy and wigglesome; what do I want to play with _him_ for, when she _said_ I might go? I like good aunties; I don't like the kind that tell lies."
"When she came at last, her face was a sight to behold--all purple, and spotted, and striped; for a fit of crying always gave her the appearance of measles. She consented to take a seat at table, but ate little, said nothing, and gazed mournfully at her plate.""Dr. Papa keeps _tittlish_ powders in blue and white papers, and one of the papers _buzzes_. I guess he'd give me that, but I don't know,"" added Flaxie, crying again harder than ever, though the tears fell like fire on her poor, sore cheeks. ""You dear little thing,"" said Aunt Charlotte, coming into the room with Ken in her arms, but putting him down and taking up her naughty niece. ""You've been getting homesick all by yourself this long afternoon. Where did you stay?""Then auntie understood it all,--how this child, who was old enough to know better, had been rolling a little bit of a trouble over and over, till it had grown into a mountain and almost crushed her. And the mother-heart in Aunt Charlotte's bosom ached for poor foolish Flaxie.Flaxie smiled faintly as she saw the dried burdock-leaves soaking in vinegar, for she liked to have a suitable parade made over her when she was sick. Besides, she had often thought she should enjoy sleeping in the ""down-stairs room,"" and was glad now that Uncle Ben happened to be gone; that is, as glad as she could be of anything. It was a miserable, forlorn world all of a sudden to Flaxie, and she had never known such ""a mean old night,"" even if it was ""the night before Christmas.""It was a ""mean old night"" to the whole house; and when I say the _whole_ house, I mean both halves of it. About midnight, as Mrs. Hunter was sleeping sweetly, her door-bell rang a furious peal. Nobody likes to hear such a sound at dead of night, and Mrs. Hunter trembled a little, for she was all alone with her children; but she rose and dressed as fast as possible, and went down-stairs with a lamp.""I don't know. She's going to scald me to death, and I s'pose you know I'm sick,"" whined Flaxie, sinking down on the doormat, where the light of the lamp shone full upon her, and Mrs. Hunter saw--what she might have seen before, if she had not been so nervous--that the little girl wore a checked flannel nightie, and her feet were done up in poultices.All this while everybody in the Allen half of the house was up and hunting for the lost child. Milly was crying bitterly; Johnny had come in from the barn, where he had pulled the hay all over; and Uncle Ben, who had just returned from his journey, was starting out on the street with a lantern.Then there was such a commotion that Flaxie was more bewildered than ever, and at sight of Uncle Ben she screamed wildly. It was his coming home about ten minutes before that had frightened her, in the first place, by waking her from a bad dream; and she had slipped out of bed, and out of the open front door, before any one missed her.""Well, never mind it, dear; you didn't mean to,"" said Aunt Charlotte, smiling in spite of her heavy heart. Then she turned to Uncle Ben, who stood by, looking puzzled, and asked him in a whisper if he ""didn't think he ought to go for the doctor""?He had hurried home in the night train, on purpose to spend Christmas day with his family, and was really too tired to take a ride of two miles in a snow-storm. But he was not thinking of that; he was thinking how dreadful it was to have his dear little niece sick away from home; and how her papa didn't like the Hilltop doctor,--and perhaps it was best to go three miles farther to the next town after Dr. Pulsifer.""Do bring the rat-trap!"" said she, plunging about in a fright. ""Oh, you don't hear, do you? There's a woman out in the other room eating peas,--eating, and eating, and eating. Why don't you stop her? Oh, you don't hear! Johnny Allen, run for a sponge and vinegar, and put it in auntie's ears, so she can hear!"""
"""I'm so disappointed,"" said Aunt Charlotte, looking pale and ill enough herself to be in bed. ""But the poor little thing is asleep now, and perhaps she isn't so very sick after all. Do tell me if you think there's any danger of brain-fever?""""Well, I think this,"" replied Uncle Ben, leaning over the bed and taking a long look at the little patient; ""_I_ don't know what ails her! It may be diphtheria, and then again it may be common sore throat; but if she isn't better in the morning, we'll telegraph to her father, for a child that can turn yellow and pea-green, as she did last spring, is capable of almost anything.""""That is true,"" said Aunt Charlotte; ""one never knows what she is going to do next."" And then she looked at Flaxie, and sighed. It was wonderful what a power she had of keeping her friends in a worry, this little pink and white slip of a girl! Once she had fallen into a brook, and once into a well, beside falling sick times without number. Uncle Ben and Aunt Charlotte knew all this, but they did not happen to know that it was a very common thing for Flaxie to be crazy! It was just so with her brother Preston and her sister Ninny; they seldom had any little ailment like a bad cold without ""going out of their heads,"" and nobody in the family minded it at all.If Flaxie's mother had been at Hilltop, she would have sent Uncle Ben and Aunt Charlotte to bed; but as she was not there, and they didn't know any better, they sat up all night watching their queer little niece.Rather a sorry ""Christmas eve"" all around the house,--but a beautiful Christmas morning, and not a cloud in the sky. Flaxie woke as gay as a bird, without the least recollection of the horrors she had suffered in the night from tigers and tea-kettles.""Well, is this the little girl they thought was so sick,"" said Dr. Pulsifer, when he arrived at noon, and found her and Milly lying on the rug, with a pair of twin dolls between them dressed just alike, and each with a fur cap on its head.""But my cold isn't good at all, now honest; and my throat's a little sore--I guess,"" said Flaxie, drawing a long face, and feeling rather ashamed not to be sick now, when the doctor had been sent for on purpose!""Never mind! If you don't need me, your aunt does. What do you think of yourself, you little piece of mischief, running away in the night, and frightening people so that they are sick abed Christmas day?""""Oh, I'm so sorry! I do love you dearly,"" cried penitent Flaxie, climbing upon the bed and cuddling close to the white auntie. ""_Did_ I make you sick? I didn't mean to; and I don't 'member anything about the tea-kettle.""""I oughtn't to stayed up-stairs yesterday in the cold,"" went on Flaxie, determined to free her mind. ""That was the wickedest thing! But you were just as good as you could be, if you _did_ trim the church; and I'll never do so again!""""'Cause I'm willing to be a little homely,--now truly--if I can have a nice so-o-ul,"" added the child, with a true and deep feeling of her own naughtiness that I am sure the angels must have been glad to see. Winter passed, spring came, and April was half over before the twin cousins met again. Then it was Milly's turn to go to Laurel Grove to see Flaxie. She had written a postal-card slowly, and with great pains, to say ""she should be there to-morrow if it was pleasant."""
"But how it did rain! It had rained for two days as if the sky meant to pour itself away in tears; but on Wednesday the sun came rushing through the clouds, his face all aglow with smiles, and put an end to such dismal business. The rain ceased, the clouds scampered away and hid themselves, and the sky cleared up as bright as if nothing had ever been the matter.She didn't own a pretty valise of brown canvas with leather straps like Flaxie's. All in the world she had was an old bandbox trunk that belonged to her mother, and she took no care of that, for Milly never ""travelled alone.""""Well, little sobersides,"" said her father, putting the check in his pocket, the ticket in his hat, and opening a car-window before he sat down beside Milly. ""Well, little sobersides, are you glad you're going visiting?""The dear little girl had not been at Laurel Grove for a long while, but all the people in town seemed to remember her,--Mr. Lane the minister, Mr. Snow the postmaster, and everybody they met in the street. Her father noticed how they smiled upon her, as if they loved her, and it made his heart glad.Preston drove his uncle and cousin home from the depot, but he almost ran into a lumber-wagon, and Mr. Allen thought he was too young a boy to be trusted with such a fiery horse as Whiz. Flaxie sat with him on the front seat of the carriage, dancing up and down, and turning around to say to Milly:""Oh, I'm so happy I can't keep still."" She looked like a bluebird, in her blue dress and sash, with a white chip bonnet, blue ribbon and blue feather, and Milly thought there was not another such girl in the world.It was a charming place at Dr. Gray's, and the house was full of beautiful things, such as Milly did not see at her own home; but that never made her discontented or unhappy. If God gave Flaxie prettier things than He gave her, it was because He thought best to do so, and that was enough for Milly.That afternoon she and Flaxie were in the stable, feeding Whiz with lumps of sugar, while the dog, Tantra Bogus, capered about them, giving their cheeks a ""thou-sand"" kisses with his long, loving tongue.""Oh, no, not a party, it's a _reception_,"" corrected Flaxie; ""that's what Fanny Townsend says they call 'em in Washington. My biggest dolly, Christie Gretchen, is going to receive. Oh, you don't know how beautifully she's dressed! And all the other dollies are coming to call on her, with the cunningest little cards in their pockets.""But there was no time for more poetry, even if Preston had been able to make it, for they were standing now at the door. It was an old, tumble-down house. The children called it black, and in fact it was a sort of slate-color, though it had never been painted at all, except by the sun, wind, and rain. In the road before it three dirty children were poking sand, and they looked so shabby that Milly whispered:Mrs. Proudfit was changing Sammy's pillow-cases when she heard the children knock, and came to the door with a pillow between her teeth. She was ""proper glad of the jelly,"" as Preston thought she ought to be.There was a smell of hot gingerbread in the air, which reminded Flaxie of the time ever so long ago, when she had taken supper in that house without leave; and there was Patty at the window this minute making faces. It is strange how things change to you as you grow older! Flaxie never cared to visit at that house now, for Patty wasn't a nice little girl at all; she not only teased away your playthings, but told wrong stories."
"The twin cousins and their little friends had a gay time that afternoon on the bank, and Christie Gretchen ""received"" with great dignity; but I have no time to talk of that now, I want to tell you something about Preston.Now Preston Gray was remarkably handsome, and one of the dearest boys that ever lived, but not a great scholar. He could whittle chairs and sofas and churns for Flaxie with a jackknife, and I don't know how many ships and steam-engines he had made; but he did not learn his lessons very well.""Preston, my fine little fellow,"" said he, kindly, ""I can't bear to scold a boy I love so dearly; but I've been afraid for some time that you don't study this term as hard as usual; what's the matter?""""Ah, Preston, Preston, I am not joking with you at all. If you were a small child like your sister Flaxie it would not matter so much whether you studied or not, but your father expects a great deal of his oldest son, and it grieves me to have to say to him--""""There, there, never mind it,"" said soft-hearted Mr. Garland, moved by the boy's distress, ""if you really mean to do better--Why, look out, child, you'd have fallen over that stump if I hadn't pulled you back. Where in the world were your eyes?""But Mr. Garland was not admiring their beauty or their gentle expression. He saw something else in Preston's eyes which startled him and gave him a pang. Not tears, for those had been dashed away, but a sort of thin mist lay over them, like that which veils the sun in cloudy weather.""It's been,"" replied Preston, choking, ""it's been a long while. The sun isn't so bright somehow as it was; and oh, Mr. Garland, the print in my books isn't so black as it used to be! But I didn't want to make a fuss about it, and have father know it.""Preston smiled. He did not know what made his dear teacher say this, and place his hand on his shoulder so tenderly; but he was glad of it, very glad; for now it was certain that Mr. Garland would not blame him any more; and he ran home with a light heart.But Mrs. Gray did not listen either. She too was looking at Preston. Mr. Garland had just been at the house talking with them about the dear child's eyes, and she and Dr. Papa were heavy at heart. Flaxie did not know of this, but she felt vaguely that something was wrong.Preston himself understood the case a little better, and was saying to himself: ""I guess there's something awful the matter with my eyes, or father wouldn't have told Mr. Garland he should take me to New York.""There were cold turkey, and pop-overs, and honey for supper, but it wasn't a pleasant meal; there was no chatting and laughing; and Dr. Papa hurried away from the table as soon as possible to go to see a sick lady up town.It was some time before the children were told the dreadful news that Preston was losing his sight. They wondered the next week why he should be allowed to stay out of school and play, and why his father, who was always kind to him, should be so very gentle now, almost as gentle as he was to little Phil.""But after he is blind, we can help him,"" said Dr. A., stroking the boy's white forehead. ""When that dreadful veil, which is stealing over his eyes, has grown thick enough, then we can take it off, and he can see. But it is not thick enough yet. He must go home and wait.""Dr. Gray was not at all surprised by this. He had known all the while that Preston's eyes must grow worse before they could be made better. But how long the boy must wait, the oculist could not say; some months, at any rate, and perhaps a year."
"It was a sorrowful time for the whole family when Dr. Gray took Preston home with him that night and told the story. Julia put her arms around her dear brother as if she wanted to hold him safe from this trial. Loving Julia! if darkness was coming upon him, _she_ would surely be, as Uncle Ben had said:How they all loved him for that! And he did bear it nobly and patiently, and the whole family helped him. That is one comfort of having a father and mother, and brothers and sisters; they always do help you bear your troubles.""Let's read to him,"" said Milly to Flaxie. So they read,--first one of them, and then the other,--whenever he wished. This would have been very pleasant if he had liked ""nice books"" such as little girls enjoy; but no, he chose stories of lion-tamers, and sea-serpents, and wild, dreadful Indians.One day the twin cousins were in the shade of the apple-blossoms, in what was called the ""orchard garden,"" driving a carriage full of dolls to a ""wedding picnic."" Flaxie's dolls led a very gay life, and perhaps that was one reason they all faded so young.Just as ""Christie Gretchen"" was alighting from the carriage, assisted by her young husband, ""Dr. Preston Smith,"" and just as Milly had sweetened the lemonade exactly to the bride's taste, and was cutting the cake, there was a quick call from Preston.Before they reached it, however, they had forgotten all about the picnic, for right in the stable-door stood a shaggy mustang pony, harnessed to a basket-phaeton; and in the phaeton sat Preston holding the reins, while Dr. Papa, mamma, and Julia stood looking on and smiling.The way that gentle little beast walked out of the yard, the way he trotted after he turned into the road! I really cannot give a proper account of it myself; it needs a little girl about Flaxie's age to describe a pony.""Oh, he's a darling, a beauty, the sweetest little thing, not half as big as Whiz! Why, Preston, aren't you just as happy? Is it your carriage? Where's the whip? Oh, the silver reins! Didn't they cost a _thou_-sand dollars? What do you call the pony? May I drive?""Flaxie had reached out for the reins, but Milly pinched her,--one of those sly pinches that both the cousins understood,--and she folded her little hands to keep them still. She did want to drive this very minute, but she wouldn't plague Preston.I wish Blackdrop could have known how happy he made the whole family. Milly didn't say much, but her eyes shone as she patted his neck, Julia sang every time she saw him, Phil ""hugged him grizzly,"" and Grandma Gray who was very timid about horses, said she wasn't any more afraid of him than if he had been a Newfoundland dog.It was the funniest thing, but really and truly, before many days that dear old lady used to step into the pony carriage and let little Flaxie drive her all around the town! Everybody nodded and smiled as the couple passed by, and said it was ""the cunningest sight,"" for grandma wasn't so very much bigger than Flaxie, and they looked like two little girls riding out, only grandma's hair was silver-white, and Flaxie's spun gold."
"Through the whole summer Preston's eyes grew worse and worse. It was all twilight to him now, or, as somebody calls it, ""the edge of the dark."" He still took care of Blackdrop, by the help of Henry, but he could not ride out unless somebody else held the reins. The days went on, and still Preston's eyes were not ""ready."" Winter came, then spring, and Milly paid another visit to Laurel Grove. She was one of those quiet, happy little girls, who make hardly any more noise than a sunbeam; but everybody likes to see a sunbeam, and everybody was glad to see Milly.There were four grown people left in the house, and five children beside Milly; still it seemed lonesome, for everybody was thinking about Preston, and wondering if the doctor would hurt him very much.""Well, but you can't help it, though. So you'd better not go round the house, moping in this way and worrying your mother,"" returned Dora, making a quick plunge with her flatiron into the folds of a calico dress.This was very true, but you mustn't suppose that Flaxie didn't also try to make other people happy. She did whenever she could think of it. She was really learning lessons in unselfishness every day; and how could she help it when everybody in the house set her such a good example?She and Milly went back to the parlor now, and talked to grandma about their western cousins, Pollio and Posy Pitcher; and then they made little Phil eat apples like a squirrel,--a very funny performance. After that they told him to go into the middle of the room, make a bow, and ""speak his piece."" That was funny too, and Ethel joined in on a high key:Mrs. Gray and grandma did not know this exhibition was called for on purpose to amuse them, but they laughed heartily, and felt the better for it; and so did Flaxie and Milly. Wasn't it much better than sitting in silence and thinking about Preston, when they couldn't help him at all?""Smile up your face, Dr. Papa,"" said he, playfully. This was what Flaxie used to say in her baby days, when they didn't call her Flaxie Frizzle, but Pinky Pearly. ""Smile up your face, Dr. Papa, and see what Preston Gray can do.""But when Preston left that chair, the trouble was not all over. He could not bear any light yet, so he had to go home a few days afterwards with a bandage over his eyes, and stay in a dark room for many weeks.Of course Julia was good to the young prisoner; you would have expected that. Flaxie was good too. She seemed at this time to have forgotten all her little fretful, troublesome ways, and was always willing to stay in Preston's chamber, and tell him everything that happened in the house or out of it; just how the pony looked and acted, and how he coughed a little dot of a mouse out of his nose, supposed to have run up his nostril when he was eating his ""granary."" Flaxie could be very interesting when she chose, and Preston's face began to light up at the sound of her little feet on the stairs.She had never loved her brother so well as she did now that she had become useful to him, and it made her very happy to hear Preston tell his mother that ""Flaxie grew better and better; she was almost as good now as Julia.""Milly had gone home, but she came back again in June. You see that the twin cousins were not very particular about taking turns in their visits, but went and came just as their two mothers found it most convenient.By this time Preston could venture out of doors on a dark day or in the evening; but I am sorry to say he was obliged to wear spectacles. This amused the little ones, Phil and Ethel, but Flaxie was very sorry."
"After a while, the little girls, and indeed all Preston's friends, became so accustomed to seeing him in glasses that they did not mind it all. He could see perfectly well, and was as happy as ever; so it didn't seem worth while to ""pity his spectacles."" ""Never saw such folks for jelly; they eat it by the quart. Wish I could be sick once in a while, and get some myself,"" muttered Preston, as he settled his school-book under his arm, and took the cup his mother had brought to the door.It was Jimmy Proudfit who was sick now, and Mrs. Gray was in the habit of sending him little dainties by Preston, who often grumbled about it, and said he was ""tired of the whole Proudfit family."" Mrs. Gray never took any notice of these unfeeling remarks, knowing they meant nothing, for Preston was an extremely kind-hearted boy. He had a few faults, of course, and one of them was a strong dislike for doing errands. He was on his way now to recite a Latin lesson to his kind teacher, Mr. Garland; and, as usual, the twin cousins were close at his heels, skipping and dancing, for they never could walk when they felt truly gay.""Going up on the bank to play 'Uncle Tom.' Blanche Jones and Fanny Townsend and everybody else is going, and 'twill be just splendid,"" replied Flaxie, as Preston walked up to Mrs. Proudfit's door to deliver the jelly.There were four children playing in the sand this time, and one of them was Patty. The twin cousins thought they would go by them without turning their heads, but Patty called out, ""Where are you running to in such a hurry?""Preston marched on in front, looking very much amused; but Flaxie's face was quite red. She pinched Milly's arm, and then Milly pinched hers. It was a strange way to go to a party--_the_ party of the season; and Flaxie had a great mind to run home; only her mother had charged her again and again not to be rude; so she said in a very calm, polite manner:Oh, it was all very well for Preston to whistle! It didn't trouble _him_, of course, for _he_ wasn't going to the party! He stopped in a few minutes at Mr. Garland's beautiful brown house with the green vines around it, and made a low bow as he said ""Good-bye.""Flaxie scowled. What would Fanny Townsend and Blanche Jones and all the other nice girls say to see her bringing along such a train of dirty gypsies? She and Milly kept close together, never turning their heads till they came to the place ""on the bank up there somewhere,"" where they were to have the party.Fanny and Blanche, and nearly everybody else, had arrived already, in clean frocks, with faces just washed; and, dear! dear! who wanted those Proudfits? But the little girls in Laurel Grove were for the most part very well-bred, so they said, ""How do you do, Patty?"" and ""How do you do, Gretty?"" and ""How do you do, Baby?"" just as if they had expected the whole family; though it was really a picnic party, and nobody had a right to come to it without an invitation. Patty kept close beside Flaxie; but Bubby, the fourteen months' old baby, made himself generally disagreeable by wiping the candy and sand off his hands upon the little girls' skirts.It was a beautiful place to play. There were trees for hide-and-seek, flat spots for croquet, and little hills and hollows for everything else. The village children used this for a sort of park, and the river seemed to look on and laugh to see them so gay. It was a very sober, steady river above and below, but right here it went leaping and tumbling over some rocks, making a merry cascade,--just for fun, you would think. The children liked to skip stones and see them spin up and down in the foam; but they had been warned not to go too near the bank. Nobody had ever fallen in yet, but it wasn't a safe place for very little folks, certainly not for roly-poly babies like Bubby Proudfit. He was very clumsy, falling down, rolling over, and picking himself up again every five minutes. Patty meant to watch him, but he was not very interesting, and the little girls quite bewitched her with their kind smiles and pretty ways."
"Flaxie Frizzle was one of the youngest, but led off in most of the games. She was little Eva, and died on a bed of grass ""elegantly,"" while everybody else groaned and howled, especially poor Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom was Milly, in a black mask of Preston's, which had been played with till it was cracked in fifty places, and made Uncle Tom look about two hundred years old.""Oh, if _I_ could wear red stockings, with flowers on them, like Flaxie! If _I_ could be a doctor's little girl, and live in a house with blinds and trees and flowers, and have a cousin come to see _me_!""It wasn't strange that Patty should feel like this, and want to cover up her bare feet in the grass; but in admiring Flaxie she forgot entirely to watch Bubby, and that was a great mistake. _He_ didn't care, he never liked to be watched; it was fine fun to see the whole world before him and go just where he chose. Didn't the trees and grass and flowers all belong to him! To be sure they did, and he meant to carry some of them home. But while he was trudging about, and making up his little mind where he would begin to pull, he espied the river sparkling in the sun, and that was finest of all. ""Pitty, pitty!"" cried he, and thought he would carry the river home too. How nice it would be to splash in! He fairly shouted at the idea, for having never seen a bath-tub, he hadn't learned to be afraid of soap and water. ""Pitty, pitty!"" said he, toddling down with outstretched hands toward the dashing, dancing, merry, white cascade; while the children, running away from the terrible old woman, and trying to see which could scream loudest, never saw or heard him at all.Ah, baby, foolish baby, do you think you can seize that bright river and carry it home? No, it is the bright river that is going to seize _you_, unless somebody stops your little feet before they get to the brink!About this time Preston Gray had finished reciting his lesson. It was not a very good one, though his teacher found no fault whatever; and now instead of going home, Preston strolled along toward the ""Children's Park,"" thinking how strange it was that little girls should scream so much louder than boys at their games.""Flaxie is a gay one,"" said he, as he saw her chasing her children with a white birch switch; but at that moment he saw something else that made his heart stand still. The Proudfit baby was scrambling down the bank, just above the falls!Preston called out, but it was of no use; there was not a man to be seen, and if there had been twenty men they could have heard nothing, while the little girls were making such a noise. He ran with all his might, but by the time he reached the bank, the baby had tumbled headlong into the river!What was to be done? Preston was only a little boy himself, let me tell you, and though he had learned to swim, the current was strong right here, and there was great danger of his being carried over the falls.Bubby was in deep water already, and his struggles were carrying him down stream. Preston seized him by his calico frock, and tried to drag him toward the bank; but that dreadful baby had always had a habit of nipping at everything like a snapping-turtle, and now he caught Preston's throat between his thumb and forefinger, half strangling him. And, oh, the current was so swift!That wasn't the end of it. There was another procession in the evening, and this one stopped at Dr. Gray's gate. It was the Brass Band, out in uniform; but Preston hadn't the least idea what for, till the men paused at the end of a tune, swung their caps, and gave ""Three cheers for Master Preston Gray!"""
"And then he raised the noble boy in his arms, so the men could see him, for that was what they wanted. But still Preston hid his face. His heart was full, and he _couldn't_ look up when those people were praising him so.By this time there were lamps lighted in every window of Dr. Gray's house, and even in the trees; and though the moon was shining her best, Major Patten, with the wonderful fur cap, asked Preston to stand beside him and hold a lamp, that he might see to read his music.Preston stood there with the light shining on his pure, good face; and then the men played, ""See the Conquering Hero comes,"" the ""Marsellaise,"" and a dozen other tunes, while their uniforms made such a dazzle of red and gold that Flaxie could not help dancing about like a wild thing for joy.""I'm glad Preston was so good,"" thought she; ""perhaps he wouldn't have been so very good if he hadn't had those blind eyes and spectacles. How God must love him! Papa says Julia is like a little candle, and I'm sure Preston is like a candle too. Why, where _is_ Flaxie going now?""Flaxie was flying down the hill after Henry, the stable-boy. She had heard her papa tell him to go to Mr. Springer's for some ice-cream, and she wanted to say: ""Get it pink, Henry; get the pinkest ice-cream you can find!""Then when the men were seated all about the yard and on the piazza, eating their pink ice-cream, somebody threw up a rocket; and that was the end of the gayest, brightest evening our little friend Flaxie Frizzle had ever known in her life.""The authoress of The Little Prudy Stories would be elected Aunty-laureate if the children had an opportunity, for the wonderful books she writes for their amusement. She is the Dickens of the nursery, and we do not hesitate to say develops the rarest sort of genius in the specialty of depicting smart little children.""--Hartford Post.""The children will not be left without healthful entertainment and kindly instruction so long as Sophie May (Miss Rebecca S. Clarke) lives and wields her graceful pen in their behalf, Miss Clarke has made a close and loving study of childhood, and she is almost idolized by the crowd of 'nephews and nieces' who claim her as aunt. Nothing to us can ever be quite so delightfully charming as were the 'Dotty Dimple' and the 'Little Prudy' books to our youthful imagination, but we have no doubt the little folks of to-day will find the story of 'Flaxie Frizzle' and her young friends just as fascinating. There is a sprightliness about all of Miss Clarke's books that attracts the young, and their purity, their absolute cleanliness, renders them invaluable in the eyes of parents and all who are interested in the welfare of children.""-- Morning Star.""Genius comes in with 'Little Prudy.' Compared with her, all other book-children are cold creations of literature; she alone is the real thing. All the quaintness of children, its originality, its tenderness and its teasing, its infinite uncommon drollery, the serious earnestness of its fun, the fun of its seriousness, the naturalness of its plays, and the delicious oddity of its progress, all these united for dear Little Prudy to embody them.""--North American Review.""I have been wanting to say a word about a book for children, perfect of its kind--I mean Little Prudy. It seems to me the greatest book of the season for children. The authoress has a genius for story-telling. Prudy's letter to Mr. 'Gustus Somebody must be genuine; if an invention, it shows a genius akin to that of the great masters. It is a positive kindness to the little ones to remind their parents that there is such a book as Little Prudy.""--Springfield Republican.""Every little girl and boy who has made the acquaintance of that funny 'Little Prudy' will be eager to read this book, in which she figures quite as largely as her bigger sister, though the joys and troubles of poor Susie make a very interesting story.""--Portland Transcript."
"""These are such as none but Sophie May can write, and we know not where to look for two more choice and beautiful volumes--Susie for girls and Horace for boys. They are not only amusing and wonderfully entertaining, but teach most effective lessons of patience, kindness, and truthfulness. Our readers will find a good deal in them about Prudy, for so many things are always happening to her that the author finds it impossible to keep her out.""""This story book is a great favorite with the little folks, for it contains just such stories as they like to hear their aunt and older sister tell; and learn them by heart and tell them over to one another as they set out the best infant tea-set, or piece a baby-quilt, or dress dolls, or roll marbles. A book to put on the book-shelf in the playroom where Susie and Prudy, Captain Horace, Cousin Grace, and all the rest of the 'Little Prudy' folks are kept.""--Vermont Record.""An exquisite picture of little-girl life at school and at home, and gives an entertaining account of a secret society which originated in the fertile brain of Grace, passed some comical resolutions at first, but was finally converted into a Soldier's Aid Society. Full of life, and fire, and good advice; the latter sugar-coated, of course, to suit the taste of little folks.""--Press.""Dotty Dimple is the plague of Prudy's life, and yet she loves her dearly. Both are rare articles in juvenile literature, as real as Eva and Topsy of 'Uncle Tom' fame. Witty and wise, full of sport and study, sometimes mixing the two in a confusing way, they ran bubbling through many volumes, and make everybody wish they could never grow up or change, they are so bright and cute.""""You wide-awake little boys, who make whistles of willow, and go fishing and training,--Horace is very much like you, I suppose. He is by no means perfect, but he is brave and kind, and scorns a lie. I hope you and he will shake hands and be friends.""""'Please stop,' said Dotty faintly, and the boy came to her, elbowing. 'I want some of that pop-corn so much! I could buy it if you'd hold this baby till I put my hand in my pocket.' The youth laughed, but for the sake of 'making a trade' set down his basket and took the 'enfant terrible.' There was an instant attack upon his hair, which was so long and straggling as to prove an easy prey to the enemy.""""Sophie May's excellent pen has perhaps never written anything more pleasing to children, especially little girls, than Dotty Dimple. If the little reader who follows Dotty through these dozen chapters,--from her visit to her grandmother to the swing under the trees,--he or she will say: 'It has been a treat to read about Dotty Dimple, she's so cunning.'""--Herald of Gospel Liberty.""Dotty's trip was jolly. In the cars where she saw so many people that she thought there'd be nobody left in any of the houses, she offers to hold somebody's baby, and when it begins to cry she stuffs pop-corn into its mouth, nearly choking it to death. Afterwards, in pulling a man's hair, she is horrified at seeing his wig come off, and gasps out 'O dear, dear, dear, I didn't know your hair was so tender.' Altogether, she is the cunningist chick that ever lived.""--Oxford Press.""This little book is as full of spice as any of its predecessors, and well sustains the author's reputation as the very cleverest of all writers of this species of children's books. Were there any doubt on this point, the matter might be easily tested by inquiry in half the households in the city, where the book is being revelled over.""--Boston Home Journal."
