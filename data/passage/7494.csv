passage
"""Oh, don't bother me,"" snapped the one addressed as Mollie. She was black-haired and black-eyed, was Mollie Billette, with a little touch of French blood in her veins that accounted for her restless vivacity and sometimes peppery temper. ""You've made me drop a stitch, Amy Blackford, and if anybody else speaks to me for the next five minutes, I'll eat 'em.""""Well, as long as you don't eat any more of my chocolates, I don't care,"" remarked Grace Ford, lazily helping herself to one of the threatened candies. ""I had a full box this morning, and now look at them.""""Haven't time to look at anything,"" returned Mollie crossly, fishing in vain for the lost stitch. ""If the poor soldiers depended upon the sweaters you made, Grace, I'd feel sorry for them, I would indeed!""""What is the matter?"" she repeated as they moved up to make room for her on the veranda steps. ""I'm more afraid than ever to leave you alone these days when every dropped stitch means a quarrel. Give it to me, Mollie, I'll pick it up for you.""""There you are,"" she announced triumphantly, after an interval during which the girls had watched with eager eyes and bated breath. ""That was a mean one. Thought it was going to make me rip out the whole row--but I showed it! Now, please, don't anybody drop any more. I must finish that pair of socks to-day.""""Goodness, that sounds doleful,"" chuckled Betty, stretching her arms above her head and reveling in the brilliant sunshine. ""What particular thing seems to be the matter now, Amy? Has Will been misbehaving?""""How could he be when he's been in town for over a week?"" she retorted with unusual spirit. ""It's just that nobody will read the paper, and I'm just dying to hear the news. I want to keep up with the times.""""Of course,"" said Grace, dryly, while Betty deftly grabbed the paper. ""It's the most beautiful and most curious thing I ever laid eyes on. It isn't as though,"" she added, with biting sarcasm, ""I had seen hundreds just like it within the last month or two--""""Oh, do stop chattering,"" Mollie interrupted heartlessly. ""Who cares what kind of noses we've got? Go ahead, Betty, you'd better get started before Grace gets to quarreling on the subject of eyelashes or something.""""My, isn't she conceited!"" chuckled Betty. ""Now I'm going to read,"" she added, letting her eyes rest upon the glaring headlines of the first page. ""If you want to listen, all right; and if you want to talk about sweaters and eyelashes--"""
"She flung down the paper, but Mollie snatched it almost before it reached the step. Then with eyebrows drawn together, and twin spots of red flaming in either cheek, she read the account of the disaster from beginning to end.""There,"" she said at last, flinging down the paper and glaring about her as though the girls themselves were at fault. ""Now you see what we're knitting sweaters for, and--and--everything! Oh, if I could just put on a uniform, and take up a gun and--and--go after those--those awful Huns!""""I wonder,"" said Betty thoughtfully, her eyes on the far-off horizon, ""what the boys are going to do. They've seemed so mysterious lately, and the minute you begin to question them about enlisting, they change the subject.""""Yes, and it's made me desperate,"" cried Mollie, the tempestuous, flinging down the unfortunate sweater once more. ""I know what I'd do if I were a man, and Betty and all the rest of us girls! But either they didn't know or they wouldn't tell. Do you suppose--""""I guess we needn't worry about that,"" said Betty, although there was a little worried line between her brows that belied her words. ""Allen wouldn't--"" here she stammered, stopped and flushed, while the girls turned laughing eyes upon her.""Oh, Betty, have you come to the heel?"" cried Mollie, running over to the Little Captain, and regarding the flying needles with a sort of awe. ""Please show me how. They say the Red Cross needs socks for the boys more than they need anything else. And I know I'll never learn to do them.""They formed a pretty picture, this group of outdoor girls, with the morning sunlight falling upon graceful figures and bent heads, ardent little patriots, every one of them, whole-heartedly eager to give their all for the service of their country.Grace Ford was tall and slender, and a charming conception of young womanhood. She had a brother, Will, who at times was rather hasty, and occasionally this would get him into trouble, much to the annoyance of his sister. Grace herself had one failing, if such it could be called. She was exceedingly fond of chocolates, and was never without some of this confection in her possession.Some years before there had been a mystery concerning Amy Blackford. She had then been known by the name of Stonington, but the mystery had been unraveled by the finding of her long lost brother, Henry Blackford. Amy was of a quiet disposition, and more timid than any of the others.In our first volume, entitled ""The Outdoor Girls of Deepdale,"" the particulars were given of the organization of a camping and tramp club by the girls, and of how they went on a tour, which brought them many adventures.After this first tour the Outdoor Girls went to Rainbow Lake, and then took another tour, this time in a motor car. After that, they had some glorious days on skates and iceboats while at a winter camp, and then journeyed to Florida, where they took a trip into the wilds of the interior, and participated in many unusual happenings.Returning from the land of orange groves, the girls next took a trip to Ocean View. Here they had a glorious time bathing, and otherwise enjoying themselves, and also solved the mystery surrounding a box that was found in the sand."
"During those strenuous days the girls had made many friends, including Allen Washburn, who was now a young lawyer of Deepdale. Allen had become a particular friend of Betty's, and this friendship seemed to be thoroughly reciprocal.Deepdale was a picturesque city of about fifteen thousand people, located on the Argono river, which, some miles below, emptied into Rainbow Lake. Back of Deepdale was a rich farming country, which tended to make the town a prosperous one.Returning from Ocean View, the girls started on a new outing, as related in the volume before this, entitled ""The Outdoor Girls on Pine Island."" The girls occupied a bungalow, which had been turned over for their use by an aunt of Mollie Billette. The boys were in a camp near by.Quite by accident both girls and boys had stumbled upon a gypsy cave, cleverly hidden in the underbrush, and had afterward succeeded in rounding up the entire gypsy band, incidentally regaining some property which had been stolen from the girls.Now, at the time our story opens, the Outdoor Girls were again at Pine Island, in the cottage lent them by ""Aunt Elvira""; but times had changed, and they were no longer solely upon pleasure bent. The grumbling, menacing unrest of war seemed in the very air they breathed, and from dawn to evening they thought of very little else.""Gee, he's not the only one,"" cried a big, strapping lad, Frank Haley, by name, throwing himself upon the steps, and looking up at the girls triumphantly. ""Just because he can run faster than we can, he gets all the credit.""""What's the matter with Will?"" asked Grace a little anxiously, for the young fellow coming slowly toward them with downcast eyes and bent head was her brother. ""He looks as if he'd lost his last friend.""""Oh, for Pete's sake, say something!"" he burst forth at last, looking up at the silent group defiantly. ""You were making enough noise before, but the minute I come along, you just stop short and stare. I didn't know I was so fascinating.""""Well, we didn't,"" said Roy, nibbling a piece of grass for want of something better. ""And you ought to take it as a proof of our devotion, that we didn't stop for any. We were too anxious to get here to tell you our news.""""Oh, for goodness' sake stop talking,"" entreated Betty, with her hands to her ears. ""If the boys want biscuits they shall have them--if I have to stay up all night to cook some for them. They can have anything in the house, as far as I'm concerned.""""Oh,"" gasped Betty, her eyes falling before the young lawyer's ardent gaze, while the rich color flooded her face. ""I said anything--not anybody. Allen, please don't be foolish. They're all looking at us.""""My, don't we hate ourselves!"" said Betty, dimpling again. ""But go ahead and tell us your adventures,"" she added, glad to change a subject which was becoming too personal. ""No story--no supper, you know."""
"""Thank you,"" said Allen courteously. ""Well, as you know, we four husky braves meandered from the island one bright morning in the early part of the week to seek our fortune, as it were, in the city of promise.""""Well, I don't know,"" said Allen, scratching his head reflectively, ""that that part was so exciting, but wait till you hear what happened afterward. After we found where the recruiting office was, we went to the hotel we were stopping at, and punished a mighty big breakfast. You see, we figured out that we were going to put our necks into the noose, as it were, and we wanted something good and big to stand up on.""""Next?"" queried Allen, stretching his long legs and squinting up at the sun. ""Let me see. Oh yes! Having put down a breakfast that must have added four pounds to our weight, we sauntered forth once more to meet our doom. By that time we were so nervous, we almost mistook a café on the corner for the recruiting station--""""Hey, speak for yourself, won't you?"" queried Roy, adding, as he turned to the girls with a grin, ""We had to show Allen a performing monkey on the street, and get his mind off, before we succeeded in engineering him to the right place.""""When we had at last tremblingly ascended the stairs, we found ourselves in a large room, with all the windows open and half a dozen wise-looking men, whom we took to be doctors, presiding. There were three or four other fellows in the room, come like ourselves, to be examined. Then we were shoved behind a huge screen with half a dozen other huskies--they looked like prize fighters to me--and told to take our clothes off. Then--we were examined.""""Yes, he went with us,"" Allen agreed reluctantly. ""But after we reached the hotel, and were making our plans for enlisting, he refused to go with us, saying he had business of his own to attend to. What that business was none of us know, for we were getting ready to catch the train for here when he rejoined us. However,"" he added loyally, ""I'd bet my bottom dollar that Will has good reasons for everything he does, and when he gets ready he'll tell us about them. In the meantime, how about some biscuits, Betty?""""Goodness, you haven't done anything,"" said Grace loftily, as the Little Captain vanished within the house, followed by black-eyed Mollie. ""You just sit around and let all the others do the work and then take the credit to yourself.""""That's all right if you can get away with it,"" grinned Allen. ""Besides,"" he added, with a humorous glance at Grace's languid figure, ""you don't look the soul of energy yourself this morning, Miss Ford.""""I'm sorry,"" he said then, so gravely that she looked up in surprise, and even Grace stopped knitting. ""I didn't mean that we fellows don't appreciate what you girls are doing for us. We do--and there'll come a time when we'll appreciate it still more. When we're in the trenches up to our knees in mud and water, when the wind finds the chinks in our clothing, and freezes us to the bone, when--"""
"""Yet those are some of the things we've got to think about,"" said Roy, still with that unusual gravity. ""It's because you girls have thought of those things, that you're giving your time and energy to preparing for them, and warding them off. Please don't ever again think that we're ungrateful.""""I think we're missing something,"" came Betty's voice from the doorway, where she stood with her arm intertwined in Mollie's. ""The biscuits are in the oven now, and we're going to talk to you while they're baking.""""What were you talking about so earnestly when we came out?"" queried Betty. ""Roy looked solemn, Grace looked surprised, Amy looked exalted, and Allen was thoughtful, while Frank looked as though--well, as though he were seeing visions.""""Oh, hush, hush,"" protested Betty, showing all her dimples--Allen was watching, so we have his authority for it. ""You boys can never get to the point, unless we happen to be talking of something to eat. Allen, what were they talking about?""""We were talking about some of the things we may be up against, when we find ourselves in the trenches, face to face with the enemy,"" he said. ""Also we were saying that these sweaters, and mufflers and socks you are knitting, will come in mighty handy over there.""""'The enemy attacked in force our lines south of Cambrai,'"" she read, with puckered brow. ""'The enemy succeeded in gaining a foothold in our first line trenches, but were later driven back. The fighting on both sides was sanguinary, and heavy losses were sustained!'""""Of course it's cruel,"" said Allen grimly. ""But so were the Huns cruel, centuries ago. The German people have simply never advanced beyond that state. They're still in the first stages of civilization.""""Yes, and the worst part of this kind of warfare,"" said Frank, his eyes fixed thoughtfully upon the horizon, ""is that each man in the army is simply a unit in a great machine. In the old days, when they had cavalry charges and hand-to-hand fighting there was some romance, some adventure, some chance for personal bravery.""""And yet,"" said Betty thoughtfully, ""I should think that kind of fighting would take more courage than the other. To stand day after day in those horrible trenches waiting for orders. And then when they do finally make a charge, nothing much seems to be gained by it.""""You said it,"" agreed Frank heartily. ""He's been through some of the heaviest fighting, and to hear him tell some of his experiences is better than a dozen lectures. I wish we could have brought him along so you girls could have heard him.""""Well,"" began Allen with aggravating deliberation, ""he was a tall, lean, rangy fellow with sandy hair and twinkling eyes. Seems he had been wounded several times, and the last shot had cost him his right arm."""
"""Bomb exploding close to him shot it all to pieces,"" explained Allen cryptically. ""Of course it had to be amputated, permanently disabling him. That's why he was sent across to America--to stimulate recruiting.""""Of course not,"" agreed Allen. ""Just the same, it's almost impossible for us over here, with the broad Atlantic separating us from the scene of conflict, actually to realize what we're up against. That's why it's good to have a fellow like this Englishman, who has really been right in the thick of it, relate his own experiences. While he was talking you could almost hear the thunder of cannon and the bursting of shells. I tell you, we fellows felt like shouldering our guns, and marching over right away.""""Well, that's a lot,"" said Frank soberly. ""Just to feel that you girls are backing us up, and that there's somebody who cares whether we give a good account of ourselves or not, makes all the difference in the world.""""Nobody seems to be eager or anything like that,"" remarked Frank, strolling out on the veranda, and regarding the enthusiastic group with a smile on his lips. ""Why didn't you suggest something they might agree to, Allen?""""May we, Mrs. Irving?"" queried Betty, smiling up at their chaperon, who was the same who had shared their adventures, during that other eventful summer on Pine Island. ""You know you love canoeing as much as the rest of us.""""Well, it's about time you realized you were with us,"" Mollie remarked as Betty, breathless with the run and the beating of her heart, joined them. ""We began to think you had eloped for fair this time.""""I'm sure I don't know where we'd elope to,"" she remarked, stepping one dainty foot exactly in the center of the unstable craft. ""We'd either have to swim or wait for the ferry, and I don't exactly know which would be the more uncomfortable.""""I'd prefer the swim,"" said Roy, arranging the pillows carefully behind Mollie's straight little back. To quote the latter: She would much rather do things for herself--boys were so clumsy--but they always looked so funny and downhearted when she told them about it, that, just in the interest of ordinary kindness, she had to humor them!""That's sensible, isn't it?"" retorted the latter, favoring the offender with a look of cold disdain. ""Since we don't happen to be any more than sixty miles from Harlem or Jersey City, I'm sure Allen appreciated your suggestion.""""Yes, we haven't even been touched by it yet,"" said Allen, his mood sobering. ""The Englishman to-day was telling us that nobody in England began to realize they were at war, until the boys began to come back wounded and disabled.""""Oh, I can't bear to think of it,"" cried Amy, who, in the canoe with Will, still silent and aloof, had scarcely spoken a word till now. ""It seems as if there ought to be some other way of settling disputes these days.""""That's what every nation thinks, except Germany and her allies,"" returned Frank. ""As it is, we've got to fight her as we'd fight a mad dog--wipe the whole German nation off the map, or at least, bring it to its knees."""
"""That reminds me of something one of the recruiting officers told me the other day,"" put in Allen, with a whimsical smile. ""He said he had talked to hundreds of American enlisted men, and the great majority of them were eager to learn German.""""It isn't your remote German ancestor that's giving you flesh, Amy,"" said Grace condescendingly. ""It's eating three hearty meals a day, and the sitting still knitting from morning to night. We girls are used to being on the go all the time.""So Allen and Frank paddled hard toward the bend in the lake, the other two canoes, which had fallen somewhat behind, quickening the stroke to catch up with them, sensing that something unusual was afoot.As the canoes in the lead rounded the bend, those in them saw that indeed the old mill had been renovated, but that the flame they had seen had come, not from the old mill, but from a small bonfire started farther in the woods.And that was not all. What made them catch their breath and signal for silence, was the figure of a man bent close to the flickering fire, intent upon deciphering the writing on a long piece of paper, that looked suspiciously like an official document.So silent had been their approach that the man had not even changed his position. Luckily the canoes were screened by heavy, overhanging branches of trees, so that the occupants could observe without being observed.Since the war had begun, the country had been overrun with them, that they knew; but out here on this remote island... Yet there was something about the very posture of the man, his hunched-up figure, the nervous twitching of the fingers that held the document, that branded him.As they watched, he started to fold up the paper, glancing stealthily about meanwhile; then, as though satisfied that no one was watching, he picked up the heavy bag that lay beside him, evidently preparing for flight.""I'll tell you what we'll do,"" Allen was saying, and they had to lean close to catch the words, which were barely above a whisper. ""There must be a guard around this mill somewhere. We'll get him, and head that fellow off.""Without another word, he turned and led the way, careful of the betraying snap of twigs, along the shore, toward the mill. Even in that moment of tense excitement, the girls and boys looked at his suddenly stiffened back in surprise. It was the first time since he had come ashore that morning, that his comrades had been able to discover anything of the old Will.As they neared the mill, Will motioned to them to stay where they were, and ran ahead to intercept a guard. A moment later he returned with the latter, and the whole party made its way hurriedly and stealthily in a roundabout direction, which would almost certainly intercept the spy--if spy he were.Without another word the Little Captain turned and, with Mollie at her side, made off in the direction the boys had taken. Amy and Grace, arms entwined about each other, followed a little lingeringly in the rear of their bolder companions.""Nothing at all,"" said Allen, laughing a little unsteadily, as Mrs. Irving and the girls and boys gathered about him anxiously. ""A little thing will bleed like a shambles sometimes. It's nothing--Betty--""""Oh, Allen, Allen!"" she was murmuring over and over in a way that sent the blood pounding madly to Allen Washburn's head, and made the wound a blessing. ""Why didn't you tell me? Oh, your poor shoulder! Some one get some water, quick,"" she ordered imperiously, turning to the anxious group. ""I don't think it's serious, but we must stop this bleeding. Please hurry."""
"Then the boys produced some spotless white handkerchiefs, which served as a makeshift bandage, till they could reach the cottage. The bullet, as Betty had said, had not much more than grazed the shoulder, yet the wound had bled profusely, and Allen was beginning to feel a little sick and dizzy, from the loss of blood.""Never mind,"" said Allen, in an attempt to lift the general depression, as they neared the cottage. ""We found the letter anyway, which may be of considerable help to the government. And what's one shoulder more or less in the cause?"" The moon made a rippling path of silver upon the water, a soft wind whispered drowsily through the trees, and far off in the depths of the woodland, an owl hooted plaintively. Ordinarily, the romantic paddle back to the island would have been filled with delight for the Outdoor Girls and their four boy friends, but tonight the profuse beauty all about them passed unnoticed.""How do you suppose we know?"" responded Will, exasperated. ""We can't very well read it until we get home; and then perhaps there won't be anything important in it. Gee, if we'd only gotten that fellow!""""Ooh!"" squealed Amy, giving a sudden splash with her paddle, that sent a geyser of spray all about her, causing several loud protests. ""I wish you'd stop talking about such things. I'd like to stop shivering for about five minutes.""""For heaven's sake!"" cried Allen, raising himself suddenly in the canoe, ""put on more steam, you fellows! We've got to get the girls out of this. What do you say, Mrs. Irving?"" turning to their chaperon, who had been a silent spectator until the moment.So they all paddled hard while the girls' eyes remained fixed in half-fearful, half-hopeful expectation upon the shadowy shore. For these girls were outdoor girls, and adventure was the breath of life to them.""Now for a light and the contents of that letter,"" cried Will, his eyes gleaming with anticipation. ""We'll soon find out whether Mr. Adolph Hensler was a regular, honest-to-goodness spy, or just an impostor. How about it, Allen?"" he went on, as the latter stumbled over a stone, and Will hooked an arm through his. ""Feeling pretty much all in, are you?""""It wasn't such a little scratch, old man,"" said Will soberly. ""If it had hit you more directly, you'd have been in for a pretty long siege. As it is, I'm afraid you'll have to lie low for a week or so. Here we are. Now, just a couple of steps, old fellow--"""
"Allen was, in truth, weaker than he thought, for each step seemed mountains high, and Frank had to grasp his other arm, before they finally made the floor of the porch, and succeeded in getting him across the threshold.""I know,"" said Betty, a little catch in her breath. ""It isn't so bad now, but I was just thinking what it would be like, if he were wounded on the battlefield, with no one to look after him--and--and--""""I know,"" said Betty, straightening up with a pathetic little attempt at a smile. ""We'll all have to say like the little boy that fell down and hurt himself, 'I'm not cryin'; I'm laughin'.' Yes, we're coming."" This last was interpolated by way of encouragement to Frank, who had been sent back to look for them.""I don't want you to go out of my sight,"" he whispered, while the others thoughtfully looked the other way. ""My shoulder doesn't ache when you're around,"" he added whimsically, knowing how clearly Betty saw through him; ""but when you go away, the ache in it is--fiendish!""""While your shoulder hurts,"" she added quickly, while the color, which did not come from the fire, flooded her face. ""I--I hate to be cross with you when you're not feeling well,"" she added, trying to be severe, ""but if you don't stop--looking at me--Allen... See, they're waiting to read the letter!""""Does that mean I have to stop looking at you?"" queried Allen, with a smile. ""Oh, well, I'll not complain, if you'll only keep on holding my hand, Betty. I'd have a chronic bullet wound all the rest of my life--""""Well, when the invalid and hero of the occasion is ready,"" Will broke in, his patience at an end, ""we should be pleased to read a document, which probably will seem dull and uninteresting to him beside what he has to say--""""Much good that does us,"" said Will, morosely folding the paper and stuffing it carefully into his pocket. ""Of course, it's better than nothing, and we'll get it into official hands just as soon as we can; but we certainly ought to have caught that rascal.""""Say!"" exclaimed Roy suddenly, his eyes gleaming with the light of adventure, ""maybe it isn't too late yet. Unless Adolph, the spy, had a boat or swam to the nearest island, which is more than a mile away, he's still on this island somewhere. We've got our good old trusties over in the big tent, and there's a bare chance we might be able to round him up.""""No, you don't!"" said Grace decidedly, while all the girls looked startled. ""You're going to use your guns to keep that man away from here. Do you suppose we're going to lie awake all night listening for shots?""Despite the quiet beauty and peace of the night, the girls found it almost impossible to sleep. They tossed and dozed, and waked and dozed again until, toward daylight, they fell into a restless, uneasy sleep.""Well, you needn't rub it in,"" retorted Roy, turning upon him savagely, while the girls looked from one to the other uncomprehendingly. ""You ought to know I'm sore enough without having you find fault."""
"""Well, you see it was like this,"" began Will, still in a bad temper. ""We fellows decided that our friend, Adolph Hensler, might have some mistaken longings for the code letter he dropped, and might follow us and try to steal it back. So we thought we'd set a trap for him by keeping watch, turn and turn about, in such a position that he couldn't possibly see us.""""Well, it is, almost,"" said Frank, waving his hand toward the east where a dim grey veil was replacing the blackness of night. ""Adolph must have been hanging around for some time, before he got the chance he wanted.""""Well,"" said Mrs. Irving, coming out of a brown study, and speaking decidedly. ""There's nothing to be gained by standing here. Probably none of us will be able to sleep any more to-night, but we can at least get dressed. Come, girls, we don't want to add sickness to our problems.""Slowly the girls reentered their room, and were relieved to find that the long night with all its weird suggestions and imaginings, was really over. Beds and dressers were distinctly visible in the faint grey light that filtered into the room. Soon the sun would be up.""Oh, I'm so tired,"" sighed Mollie, sinking down on the edge of her bed and gazing about her disconsolately. ""I feel as if I ought to be tremendously excited, but I'm too sleepy to care much about anything.""""Wait till the sun comes up,"" said Betty, recovering a little of her old cheeriness. ""That makes everything look different. I wonder,"" she added, as if the thought had not been in her mind all the time, ""how Allen is. The noise didn't even seem to disturb him. I think I'll ask Mrs. Irving if I can go--and--see----""""Why, of course you can,"" said Mrs. Irving, who happened to be passing the door at that particular minute, and looking in at her smilingly. ""I was just going to visit the patient myself; so if you hurry and get dressed, we can go together.""It is safe to say that Betty was fully dressed, to the last little pattings and fluffings of her blue morning dress, before ten minutes was up, and, with Mrs. Irving, was walking with rapidly beating heart down the hall toward Allen's room.""All right,"" said Mrs. Irving sunnily, pushing the door open and advancing toward the patient, while Betty lingered a little in the background. ""You're not the only one. How are you feeling this morning?""""All right--fine,"" he amended, as his eager eye caught sight of Betty. ""Never was feeling better in my life. Decidedly grateful for being allowed to live at all--when there are so many beautiful things to look at,"" this with so direct and ardent a gaze upon Betty, that she turned and looked out of the window, unwilling to let him see what her face must reveal.""Don't make a fuss and get excited, please,"" Mrs. Irving cautioned him gently, while her eyes dwelt with humorous sympathy upon Betty's back. ""I'm going down to prepare some breakfast, and perhaps Betty can persuade you about the doctor."""
"""What have I done?"" he queried pathetically. ""It's one of the prettiest backs I ever saw, but that's no reason why I should have to look at it all the time. Besides, you seem to forget that I have a sore shoulder.""""I haven't,"" he denied stoutly, feeling for her hand, which, however, persisted in evading his. ""I've never said anything to you, Betty Nelson, that wasn't true. If you'll give me your hand, my shoulder will stop aching."" Betty opened her eyes slowly, and blinked at the sunlight that flooded the room. She had a vague sort of idea that something unusual was going to happen, but was too lazy and comfortable to realize just what that something was.Then suddenly it came to her, and she sat up in bed with a start. They were going home! That was the big event; and somehow, she did not feel as sorry as she usually did at the end of a vacation. In fact, she was almost eager to leave this island, with its powder mills and spies that shot boys you liked, and robbed you in the bargain--quite eager to drop play, and do her bit for the country she loved.""Not guilty,"" laughed Betty merrily. ""If you'll look a little closer, you'll see there is not a bit of candy in that box! No, don't glare at me like that, Gracie, dear. The only way you could frighten me, would be by getting up early. Then I'd know there was something wrong.""""Well, you can stay there all day if you want to,"" said Betty, inserting two determined little feet into two pretty bedroom slippers, and running across to the open window, ""but I wouldn't if I were you. It's too wonderful a day in the first place, and in the second, I can imagine pleasanter things than staying alone on this island over night.""""How awful,"" mocked Mollie, who had been watching them for some time from the bed in the alcove. ""It's an outrage, having to get up in the morning. I think we should have been made so we could sleep all the time.""""Why, of course. Haven't you?"" asked the Little Captain, slipping on the skirt to her pretty traveling suit and fastening it deftly. ""I'm going to make dozens and dozens of scarfs, sweaters and socks. The boys are giving up everything for us, and I'm sure the least we can do is, keep them warm.""""Oh, I don't know,"" defended Betty, putting an arm about Grace, and starting for the door. ""Grace believes in quality more than quantity. She may not knit as much as the rest of us, but she does it twice as well."""
"They flew around to prepare breakfast, and the smell of sizzling bacon and baking biscuits sent their spirits soaring to the skies. The boys, who had finished their own breakfast, and scoured up the pans, heard the sounds of merriment, and came to inquire the cause.""We'd ask you to breakfast,"" she said, ""only this is the last biscuit, and I wouldn't give it up to my best friend. Why don't you come in?"" she continued, as they lingered on the threshold. ""I never knew you to be bashful before.""""We're not bashful,"" denied Allen, as they distributed themselves about the room in various and characteristic attitudes, grinning happily at the girls. ""We were so hypnotized by the charming picture you made for us we couldn't move, that's all.""""Not yet,"" replied Allen, who, although it was scarcely a week since the accident, had almost completely recovered from his wound. ""The doctor said he'd be around early this morning, and if it looked all right, would take it off.""""I know what you mean,"" said Allen, coming to his rescue. ""You're thinking that we're likely to be called almost any time now, and it gives you stage fright to think about it. It's a great big task we've taken hold of, and we can't quite grasp it yet, that's all.""""Th-that's the way I feel,"" said Betty, her eyes shining and her cheeks flushed, stammering in her eagerness. ""I feel somehow as if we were acting in a great big play, where there are all actors and no audience, and everybody's sort of flustered and excited and not sure just where they belong but terribly anxious to get into it somewhere.""""Well, we're all in it,"" cried Frank, his eyes fired with enthusiasm. ""Thank heaven, there's not one among us we can call a slacker. We've all enlisted without waiting to be hauled into it by the scruff of the neck--we--we----,"" his eyes happened to fall upon Will as he sat regarding him steadily from a chair near the window, and as though at a signal, his enthusiasm died and he stammered incoherently.""Bully!"" cried Roy admiringly. ""I heard a fellow saying the other day that it was wonderful the way the American women have come up to the scratch--pardon the slang, ladies, but that's what he said. He said the Red Cross was turning out bushels of woolen wear, and that at this rate there wouldn't be a man in the United States army or navy, that wouldn't be kept warm and comfortable during the big fight. I tell you it makes you feel good, to think that mothers and sisters and sweet girl friends are backing you up like that. It takes away old Fritz's last shadow of a chance.""""Oh, it's wonderful to hear you talk like that,"" said Mollie, eyes bright and cheeks glowing. ""Ever since war was declared I've been dying to put on a uniform and get into the thick of it myself. But if we can't, it's the next best thing to be able to encourage our boys, and make them as comfortable and happy as we can. Oh, I think they're wonderful--and I love them all, every one of them!""""I call upon the others to witness,"" said Roy, jumping to his feet and bringing his fist down upon the table, with a force that made them jump. ""Mollie has consented to be exclusive when the war's over, and you all know what that means."""
"""So am I,"" cried Betty, getting up energetically and beginning to clear away the dishes. ""And the first thing to do is to get back to town where we can really start something. Goodness, I wish these dishes were washed.""Two hours later the campers were standing on the deck of the ridiculous little ferryboat, that still plied between Pine Island and the mainland, looking with mingled emotions toward the spot where they had spent so many pleasant hours.""We're glad because we're going to do our share in the biggest thing that ever happened to this world,"" said Betty tensely. ""We're glad because we've got the greatest country in the world, and are going to do our best to keep it the greatest country in the world. We're glad, most of all, because--we're Americans!""The four girls were seated on the porch of Betty's house in Deepdale, busy as always, with their knitting. Mollie and Betty were swaying gently in the big porch swing, while Grace and Amy were curled up comfortably in roomy wicker armchairs.The weather was perfect--a typical fall day, with the brilliant sunshine peeping in under the edge of the awning, creeping up almost to the feet of the girls, while vagrant breezes, spicy and pungent with the smell of burning leaves, fanned their faces, and stirred them to a new restlessness, a new desire for action.""Betty, have you a plan?"" asked Amy, gazing hopefully toward the Little Captain. ""I've thought of all sorts of things, from taking a course in stenography to taking in washing, but nothing seems to be just right, somehow.""""Goodness, I should think not,"" said Grace, while Betty and Mollie giggled happily. ""I can't imagine you in the role of chief washerwoman to Deepdale, Amy; and as for stenography--think how much you would have to spend before you began to earn any money.""""My idea's very much simpler than either of those,"" said Betty demurely. ""I thought--though of course it may not be possible, at all--that we might give a lawn fête and charge fifty cents admission, a person. We know pretty nearly everybody in Deepdale, and if only a third of them came we'd raise quite a big sum.""""Betty, that's splendid,"" cried Mollie, clapping her hands excitedly, forgetful of the needles she still held. ""We can have fortune-telling booths and tableaux, and perhaps a sketch of some kind. Oh, won't it be fun?""""Well, we will earn it,"" said Betty earnestly. ""We have, as Doctor Morely says, 'a good deal of local talent' that we ought to be able to win over to our side, and if we really go into the thing to make it a success, it will be one. And a successful lawn party is no end of fun.""""If you don't stop poking me with those needles, you will start something,"" threatened Betty, moving to the opposite corner of the swing, and as far from danger as possible. ""You wouldn't need a bayonet in the trenches, Mollie dear. The whole German army would drop dead, if they saw you moving down upon them with a knitting needle. Stop it, I tell you, or I shall be forced to take them away from you.""""Oh, look who's going to take them away,"" mocked Mollie, continuing her wild dabs and dashes. ""There isn't a man, much less a woman, on this earth could take these knitting needles away from me, against my will."""
"""Looks as if I'd have to start a little war of my own,"" remarked Betty ruefully, carefully putting away her own knitting and preparing for action. ""I never yet let a challenge like that pass me by--Oh, Allen, you startled me!""""Sorry,"" said Allen, making his usual, though undignified, entrance over the railing of the porch, and seating himself with a sigh of content in one of the big chairs. ""Say, what was all the row about?"" he added, looking with interest at Mollie's still threatening needles, and Betty's general air of preparation for attack. ""About a mile away I heard the noise, and thought I'd drop in to see who was getting killed.""""Oh, about the needles,"" said Allen, stretching out his long legs, and locking his fingers behind his head. ""I just happened to remark that while we were killing each other off with bayonets in the trenches, the women and girls would be knitting themselves to death at home, so there would probably be an equal number of both sexes when the war was over.""""It's for the Red Cross,"" Betty explained, ""I'm afraid that stitch is too far down to get back, Amy dear. You'll have to rip out a little. You see we want to raise a lot of money,"" she went on, raising her pretty head and speaking quickly. ""When we decided to join the Red Cross, as you know we have, we didn't mean to go into it half way. It didn't seem to us enough, just to give our time and labor--we wanted to raise actual cash. And this seemed the best way to do it.""""I think it's a mighty fine idea,"" said Allen heartily. ""And as I don't think there's a more patriotic town on the map than little old Deepdale, I should think you ought to be able to raise quite a considerable pile. I'll help all I can.""""There's no reason in the world why we can't,"" cried Betty, putting away her knitting definitely, and beginning to pace up and down the porch as she always did when thinking things out. ""Allen, do you think you can round up the boys, and do you think they'll all be willing to help us?""""Good! Then there's Gladys Alden who plays the violin beautifully, and Jean Ratcliffe who can recite like a professional and--oh, dear, there's no end to the talent. And we'll----"" she paused dramatically and surveyed them with dancing eyes. ""We'll--give a play!""""Oh, but don't you remember that play we were going to give one time?"" Mollie broke in eagerly. ""And then somebody's relative was taken sick, and broke the whole thing up? That was a good little sketch, and I don't think it would take us very long to brush it up again.""""Do you know what would make a hit?"" suggested Allen, catching the general spirit of enthusiasm. ""If this is going to be an outdoor affair, we ought to have a big tent with a stage at one end, for this concert and sketch business. We could make it mighty picturesque, with Japanese lanterns, and we fellows might be able to rig up some batteries and electric lights for footlights."""
"""That would be wonderful,"" cried Grace, shaken out of her usual calm. ""That would be the big attraction. Then we could have little booths for fortune-telling, and such things, scattered about the place.""It was seven o'clock and Betty had started to dress. Mechanically, with fingers that shook a little from excitement, she went through the early stages of the process, until it was time to slip into the pretty filmy lace dress she was to wear for the first part of the evening.Then her eyes met the reflected ones in the mirror, and she stopped short, wondering ""if this were really I."" She was very sure that that very pretty girl in the mirror, with the flushed cheeks and brilliant eyes, could never be the Betty Nelson she had grown up with--it could not be! And yet she thrilled with a strange new happiness. It was so good to be pretty.""Betty Nelson,"" she scolded, slipping the pretty dress over her head, and keeping her eyes severely away from the mirror, ""you'll be getting conceited next; and if there's anything I hate, it's a conceited person.""At a quarter of eight there came a ring at the door bell, and Betty's heart missed a beat. It proved to be only Allen, however--but, strange as it may seem, that fact did not seem to improve the behavior of her heart in the least.""Oh, Allen, I'm _so_ glad it was only you,"" she said, holding out her hands to him--which he seemed by no means reluctant to take. ""I was so hoping you'd get here before the rest. There are one or two things I want to talk over with you.""""Betty,"" he whispered, his voice sounding strange, even to himself, ""you're so pretty, I can't think of anything else, or look at anything else, while you're around. I always did have trouble that way, but to-night----""""Good evening, Allen."" It was Mrs. Nelson's voice as she came unsuspectingly upon them from the dining-room. ""I didn't even know you were here. Betty and I were hoping you would get here early. The footlights don't work just as they should----"" and Allen's golden hour was gone, for the moment, at least.He gazed pleadingly toward Betty, but she had put an arm about her mother--Allen noticed with joy that it trembled a little--and was leading the way toward the rear of the house, and out upon the lawn, where the big tent had been erected.It took Allen, who, besides being a very able and rising young lawyer, was also something of an electrician, about two minutes to find the flaw in the wiring and remedy it. Soon after that the first guests began to arrive.The rest of the evening was one brilliant panorama, that the girls never forgot. Until nine o'clock, the time set for the concert and sketch in the big tent, the guests, about two hundred in number, wandered happily about the lawn, watching ""Denton's trained animals,"" which consisted of a little French poodle, an aristocratic yellow cat, and a gifted parrot, with an immense and varied vocabulary, perform.The animals were the undisputed property of this young Denton, who had grown up in Deepdale, and who, being a lover of animals, had untiringly trained his pets, until their fame had spread all over the town. He had a booth all to himself, and was having more fun than the spectators--and that was saying a good deal, judging from the merry laughter and jests issuing from the tent.There were several other attractions, the favorite, after ""Denton's trained animals,"" being the fortune-telling booth. This was presided over by Jessie Johnson--one of the jolliest and wittiest of the Deepdale girls. She was made up to resemble an old crone, and her fortune-telling kept her victims in gales of laughter."
"""Mollie,"" returned Betty, and there was a strange new thrill in her voice, that made her friend look at her quickly, ""I'm happy, happy, happy! I thought I knew what it was to be happy before, but I never did. I just feel like shouting aloud and hugging everybody I see. Oh, I never dreamed we'd make such a success of it!""""Well, then you deserve to lose it,"" said Betty, knowing very well how best to handle Mollie. ""You'll do just whatever you think you're going to do, and if you think you're going to fail, you'll fail!""The girls had worried a little for fear the big tent would not be able to accommodate all the guests, so great had been their response to the call of patriotism, but it was found to their intense relief that, although a few had to stand at the back, all could be admitted.The first part of the program consisted of music, recitations and some very cleverly arranged tableaux. Everything was remarkably good, as the hearty applause testified, and behind the scenes everywhere, was jubilation.""We will,"" said Betty confidently. ""Jean, you did wonderfully,"" she added, to the girl who had been the elocutionist of the evening. ""I thought it was wonderful at the last rehearsal, but you outdid yourself to-night. And you, too, Larry. Oh, it's such a success!""""Oh, I'm so frightened, I can hardly stand up,"" chattered Amy as she and Betty stood together, waiting for the endless last minute to drag past. ""Betty, if this is stage fright, it's a lot worse than I thought. I can't think of a line I have to say.""Local talent had even produced an orchestra for the sketch, and although once in a while, the cornetist forgot to toot, or the first violin became excited and left the rest of his flock behind to follow him as best it might, still the music was pretty good and added considerably to the general effect.And the play was the crowning glory of the evening! The stage fright which had threatened to overwhelm the actors, magically disappeared when they found themselves put upon their mettle, and they frolicked through the play, with an ease and naive enjoyment that delighted their audience and brought storms of applause.The play was called, ""A Day in Court."" It was a professional production which had been almost completely rewritten by Allen and Betty. The judge was a woman, and the various characters brought before her, were all more or less funny. One character had originally been a German servant girl, suing her mistress for wages, but this character, on account of the war, was changed to Irish, and was impersonated by Amy with marked success.Mollie impersonated a French flower girl, who had failed to receive pay for bouquets sold to a local dude, a part played by Roy Anderson, and it developed during the court scene, that the dude was engaged to two girls at once, impersonated by Grace and another girl.There was an irate uncle of one of the girls, none other than Frank Haley, and Allen as the brother of the other girl, who also demanded satisfaction, and the mix-up in the courtroom was most realistic.""But I guess that never happens to anybody,"" she said, trying to speak lightly. ""And I don't know that just having good times is a very big ambition. No--I--didn't mean that, Allen,"" she added quickly, seeing she had hurt him. ""You've always been altogether too good to me. I--I guess I don't deserve it."""
"Two weeks went by after the great night, two weeks of ceaseless activity. The fame of Betty's lawn party had spread all over Deepdale, and countless smaller affairs on the same order had been given. As imitation is always the sincerest flattery, the girls were delighted.""What's that?"" queried Grace, interested. It was just like Betty to have things entirely thought out before she said anything about them. ""I never saw anybody with so many plans as you, Betty. You make my head swim.""""Goodness,"" said Amy. ""I wish we'd thought about it sooner. The boys are sure they're going to be called every day, and if we took time to get up anything like the entertainment we had before, we couldn't have them in it.""""Oh, we couldn't give an affair like that without the boys,"" said Mollie decidedly, a fact which she would never have admitted in the hearing of the young men themselves. ""And I'd hate to give anything tame, after the big success we had with the other one.""""Did you say you bought that box of candy for me?"" asked Grace bitterly, eying the alluring box, where it lay in Mollie's lap. ""Every time I want one I have to look extra sweet and go down on my knees.""""Goodness, my family's been prophesying that thing ever since I can remember,"" Grace retorted, putting aside her knitting, and drawing nearer to the candy box. ""If I had listened to them I'd have worried myself into all sorts of things by this time.""""Oh, yes! Well, she suggested that we give the same performance over again. Everybody liked it, and any number of people had spoken to her about it, saying they'd like to see it over again. Of course we'd have to leave out the booths and things; they would take too much time to get ready, but we might give the sketch.""""Goodness, that's a regular compliment,"" gurgled Mollie, knitting furiously. ""Instead of--as Roy would say--'getting the hook,' they ask us to do it all over again. I wouldn't have thought any audience would stand for it.""""Well,"" continued Betty, ""I told Mrs. Ross I'd talk it over with you folks, and if we did it at all, it would be for the benefit of the Y.W.C.A. Of course, we don't know how the boys will feel about it.""""I don't know how to thank you,"" she had said to Betty and Grace, who had been appointed by the others to take the money to her. ""You girls have waked Deepdale up with a vengeance. We were always intensely patriotic, but we hardly knew how to go about showing it, until you came and pointed the way."""
"""I believe,"" said Betty, as the two girls left her and started for home, ""I'd like to join the Y.W.C.A. also if only to be near Mrs. Barton Ross. When I've talked with her for a little while, I always feel as if I'd been to church, or something like that.""""It's all very well to knit in the day time,"" Roy complained one stormy evening, when the four couples of young folks had congregated in Mollie's cheerful living-room; ""but I don't see why you have to keep it up all evening too. It gets me dizzy just to watch the needles.""""Well, why don't you get busy and learn to knit yourselves?"" asked Mollie with a twinkle. ""Percy Falconer was telling me that in one place several men had gotten together, and formed a knitting club. Of course, they're too old to join the army or the navy, so they thought they'd do their bit that way.""""I imagine that's just the sort of club dear Percy would like to join,"" remarked Allen, smiling. ""It's easier to imagine him in a corner by the fireside knitting socks for soldiers, than in any other role.""""Goodness,"" said Betty, with a little shiver. ""I should think it would take lots more courage to hurt yourself than to take a chance on getting shot in the trenches. I don't see how anybody can do it.""""But isn't Congress going to pass some sort of law,"" asked Betty earnestly--Allen reflected how very pretty she was when in earnest--""that will make that kind of man serve first? It seems to me I read something about it in the paper.""""Why, he was spending the week-end at a house party when his folks telegraphed him that his orders had come, and he was to report for duty the next morning. Well, the poor old chap didn't even have time to get home and say goodbye--had to rush off the next morning and was sent down South. His mother came over to see mine, and, the way she went on about it, you'd have thought Herb was going to be shot at sunrise!""""Herb ought to answer like the old negro my uncle had on his plantation,"" remarked Allen with a smile. ""'Marse,' he said, 'dar ain't no chaince o' my bein' shot at sunrise--no, sah. I don' never git up dat early.'""""You know, as far as I'm concerned I rather envy Herb,"" said Frank, while the girls stared at him in surprise. ""Not for being called away without having time to say good-bye to his folks, of course, but for receiving his orders. Waiting and expecting them every day is mighty hard on your nerves, I can tell you.""What was the matter with him? they wondered. Will, who had always been the life of a party before, and so intensely patriotic and thoroughly American! Yet he was the only one among them who was not shouldering his share of the nation's responsibility.""I don't know,"" said Allen, shoving his hands deep into his pockets as he always did when anything was, as he expressed it, ""too deep for him."" ""I can't make him out at all, Betty. We'll just have to hope for the best."""
"""Yes, yes, this is Betty.--Oh, Allen!--When?--To-morrow morning! Oh, isn't that terribly short notice?--Oh, I can't, I can't believe it!--Roy and Frank, too?--No, I didn't hear about it--Listen, Allen.--No, I'm _not_ crying.--What's that?--Well, I'm trying not to!--Please listen to me.--Bring the boys around here to-night, will you? I'll get the girls and we'll have a p-party.--No, I'm _not_ crying.--G-good-bye!""With a little jerk Betty hung up the receiver, and sat staring out of the window with the tears streaming down her cheeks. She brushed them away impatiently and felt feverishly for her pocket handkerchief.""Oh, I h-hate the old Kaiser, and I hate the old war, and I h-hate everything!"" she wailed, rolling the handkerchief up into a miserable little ball. ""Wh-what will we do when the b-boys are gone and we haven't anything to do, but just think of the time they'll be sent over to France to get k-killed? Oh, Betty, don't act so f-foolish,"" she scolded, putting away the handkerchief with an air of decision. ""You know you wouldn't have had them do anything else anyway----""That probably wouldn't do any good, either,"" objected Betty, ""as far as being with the boys is concerned, because we'd probably be sent to another part of the field entirely, and probably wouldn't see them from the beginning of the war to the end of it. No, I guess we'll just have to keep on knitting for them.""""I imagine we'll have all we want to do just to keep up our correspondence with the boys we know,"" said Betty, knitting steadily. ""I think it's wonderful the way practically all of Deepdale has volunteered. It makes you proud to live here.""""It's terrible,"" said Amy, with another sigh. ""I can't walk along the street and see those flags in the houses of people we've grown up with, without having a funny lump rise in my throat, and I have to hurry past to keep myself from acting foolishly.""""I guess none of us really knew we were at war until all the boys we know began to be called away,"" said Grace seriously. ""And I know you girls must all think it's strange--"" she paused for a moment as if uncertain just how to proceed, and the girls looked at her in surprise.""I--I'm so worried about Will,"" Grace continued, not raising her eyes from her knitting. ""He hasn't been himself for a month--you girls must have noticed that--and he won't give me any satisfaction at all when I ask him what's the matter. We--he and I--used to be such good friends----"" her voice broke and the girls' hearts ached for her, ""and now he acts just like a stranger--only asks to be left alone. And he's so moody and queer and silent----"" Her voice trailed off and for a long time no one spoke.""I wouldn't worry too much, Gracie, dear,"" said Betty, at last, going over and sitting down beside her friend. ""Will has some problem that he's trying to work out all by himself. We know that he's true blue all the way through, and when he's ready to confide in us, he'll do it. Until then, we've just got to trust him, that's all, and help him all we can by our good faith.""That was more than the girls could stand, for they remembered how gallantly Grace had striven to hide her trouble during all these weeks, and they gathered around her, whispering little words of endearment and comfort, till she started to laugh and cry together, calling herself an ""old goose"" and clinging to them desperately.""Telephone your brother that you're staying here,"" said the Little Captain decidedly. ""The boys are coming to-night, you know, and you can all help me with the spread. No, you needn't waste time arguing--you're going to stay."""
"""Say, did you hear the latest news?"" asked Roy eagerly, before the greetings were half over. ""Another American ship has been sunk by those beastly Huns, and quite a number of passengers are reported missing. Gee, I wish instead of going to a training camp we were going right across. It seems a crime to be wasting time on this side when we might be getting at them.""""Another ship!"" cried Betty, while the boys eagerly poured forth the details. ""Oh, if I were only a man,"" she added, clenching her hands as the recital finished, ""I'd fight until there wasn't one German left on the face of the earth.""""You just leave that to us,"" said Frank, his eyes gleaming. ""We may not be able to exterminate the whole German nation, but we'll drag the old Kaiser to his knees and make him kiss the Stars and Stripes before we get through. Gee, but I'm aching to get right into the thick of it all!""""Music,"" explained Allen, who had not taken his eyes from her face since he had come upon the porch. ""A reporter I know handed them to me. They're all the popular war songs, and I thought perhaps we might run them over tonight.""""Betty, I don't feel like myself at all,"" said Grace, after a silence during which they had both been plunged in thought. She flourished a shoe in the air and regarded Betty as though it were her fault. ""I feel all quivery and shaky and trembly inside, and I don't think I could smile if you paid me for it.""""Goodness, I know I couldn't!"" said Betty, and then added as she pinned on the bunch of carnations Allen had brought her the night before: ""We've just got to smile, though, whether we feel like it or not. We don't want the boys to remember us in tears.""""We were all to meet at Mollie's, weren't we?"" asked Grace, as they made their way down the sun-flooded street. ""Oh, Betty, I'm afraid to meet anybody, I'm so sure I'm going to make a goose of myself. Will you hold my hand all the time?""""Gee, it won't do any good to cry about it,"" retorted Roy philosophically, looking around upon the three pretty girls with an appreciative eye. ""I call it a great lark, and if only you girls were coming along my happiness would be complete.""""Oh, we were so afraid you'd be late,"" gasped Betty, as Allen caught her on the wing, as it were, and drew her to his side. ""And if you weren't there on time, you might be tried for desertion, mightn't you?"" she added, looking so adorable in her concern that Allen failed to reassure her right away.""Will you write every day?"" pleaded Allen, leaning close, and for the moment these two were absolutely alone. ""Letters are the next best thing to having you with me, Betty. And if you stop writing, I give you fair warning I'll come straight home on the next train, furlough or no furlough, to see what the matter is; and if I get shot at sunrise, so much the better. Betty, will you promise me?"" He said it pleadingly."
"""Goodness, why don't you tell us something we don't know?"" snapped Mollie. ""Please forgive me, Amy,"" she added the next moment, as Amy's eyes filled with tears. ""I know I'm a beast, but I can't seem to help it this morning.""""Didn't the boys say Camp Liberty was only a couple of hundred miles from here?"" asked Betty thoughtfully. Camp Liberty was the cantonment in which the boys were to receive their initial military training.""I only wish I felt as sure,"" said Betty, still thinking how foolish she had been not to speak to Mrs. Ross about it herself before she had proposed it to the girls. Now she had got them all excited--and it was such a wild idea.""It would be lots of fun,"" Grace went on, her eyes shining at the mere thought. ""We've heard so much about these Hostess Houses that I've just been crazy to see one. But to live right there at the camp----""""We could help to see that the friends and mothers and sweethearts of the boys were made comfortable,"" cried Mollie enthusiastically. ""And if there were too many to be entertained at the Hostess House we could get families outside to entertain them. Oh, it would be no end of fun.""""I don't know why it would be your fault,"" said Grace, slipping a loyal arm about her friend. ""You've chased the gloom away for one morning at least, and if nothing comes of this idea, we'll at least have had the delights of anticipation.""And they did run, with the result that a moment later Mrs. Barton Ross was surrounded by four very much excited, gesticulating and pretty girls, all talking at once and all clamoring for her attention.""One at a time,"" she begged. ""I can play a different air with each hand on the piano, but I'm not gifted enough to understand four people all talking at once. Now, if you'll just say it all over again.""""There's no 'just perhaps' about it,"" said Mrs. Ross decidedly, and the girls wondered if they could believe the evidence of their ears. ""In fact,"" she continued, ""I was going to speak to you girls about that very thing this morning. You have been so successful in rousing the general spirit here, that I thought you would be just the ones to make a Hostess House at Camp Liberty a success. Why, yes, I think it can very easily be arranged.""Then the girls forgot dignity and decorum and everything else and just celebrated. In the exuberance of their joy they hugged Mrs. Ross until she gasped for breath, then they danced off down the street on feet that scarcely touched the ground.""If it weren't for getting back our stolen things,"" said Grace with a little shiver, ""I'd be only too glad not to lay eyes on his beauteous countenance again. Goodness, I know I'll dream of him to-night.""""Do you know, girls,"" she said, ""I may be foolish--probably I am, but I have a strong conviction that some time we're going to meet that spy again--and the third time he isn't going to get away from us!"""
"The next few weeks were filled with such excitement, that the girls even forgot to miss the boys. In the letters they received from the latter--and they were many--they never failed to find comments upon this strange fact. The boys seemed to feel a little aggrieved that the girls did not weep a few more tears in the absence of their devoted swains.""Of course I want you to be happy, Betty,"" Allen had written once upon this theme, ""but I'd like to feel that you missed me, a little anyway. It makes a fellow feel as though it wouldn't make any difference if he disappeared off the face of the earth. If you missed me one-tenth as much as I miss you--"" etc., etc., until Betty's laugh bubbled over and she patted the letter consolingly.""Never mind, Allen, dear,"" she said, putting the letter away carefully in the rapidly increasing pile, tied with the blue ribbon. ""If you only knew what I know, you wouldn't have time to miss me so much either. But I am glad,"" she added, all to herself, flushed of face and shy-eyed, ""oh, so very glad, Allen, to have you miss me!""About a week before the great day, they gave another of the affairs which had grown so rapidly in popularity. This time it was to raise funds for the Hostess House, and the girls gave heart and soul and all their time to make it a success.It spoke well for the patriotism of the young men of Deepdale that there were very few within the age of enlistment, who had not already gone to the various training camps, scattered all over the country. So there were very few at the dance, giving, as Betty's father jokingly said, a chance for the ""young old men"" to show their accomplishments.And the ""young old men,"" did so well that there had never, in all the history of Deepdale, been a merrier party. Being an age when everybody danced, up to the grandfathers of ninety, the girls had no lack of partners, and were oftentimes amazed at the skill and dexterity and lightness shown by men who were old enough to be their fathers twice over.""Oh, I never had such a good time,"" cried Mollie, sinking down beside Betty on one of the roughly improvised benches, weak from laughing. ""I was just dancing with old Doctor Riley, and he kept me in stitches. Half the time he had almost to carry me around, I was laughing so.""""You're taking a chance, Miss Betty,"" he said, the corners of his eyes crinkling into a million wrinkles as he laughed down at her. ""I used to be considered a fairly good dancer in the old days, but I haven't danced in the last ten years. I watched the young folks so much, though, I thought I'd take a chance if you were willing. If I step on your toes too much we can go over and get some ice cream and cake.""""You're doing wonderfully,"" said Betty heartily, amazed to find how much she was really enjoying the dance. ""I'm going to write to the boys, and say we don't need them any more,"" she added whimsically. ""I'll tell them we're just beginning to appreciate their fathers!""When it was over, their proceeds amounted to over a hundred dollars; and that was not counting an uproarious good time, that none of the young or middle-aged folk of Deepdale would ever stop talking about.Then at last came the dawning of the great day--the day the girls had looked forward to for weeks. They woke with a strange, thrilly sensation running up and down their spines, and hearts that refused to beat normally.""Oh, there is oceans of time,"" Mrs. Ross assured them, who seemed, for some unaccountable reason, bent on delaying them. ""The train isn't due for ten minutes yet, and then it's more than likely to be late. Besides, there are a few last words I'd like to say to you girls that can be said better here than on the station platform."""
"Then she started to give them some minute instructions, to which they tried hard to listen respectfully, although the mere effort to sit still was torture, and Mollie afterward said she ""wanted to scream.""However, the harangue lasted at the most, two minutes--although it seemed to the girls two ages--and they were at last on their way to the station. It was not till they turned the corner that brought the familiar platform in view, that they received their first surprise.When the shouts had died down, Doctor Riley made a speech full of true Irish wit and humor, and pathos, too, telling the girls how deeply Deepdale had appreciated the active and patriotic work they had done for their country in the time of its bitterest need and how very sorry they all were to see them go.He went on to tell something of what the country was doing and had done, cracking a few jokes based on camp life, that almost sent the girls into hysterics--so finely balanced were they between laughter and tears. Then he ended with another eulogy of the Outdoor Girls and the hope that health and good fortune would follow them wherever they went.He stepped down from the box on which he had been making his address just as the sharp toot of the whistle gave warning of the train's approach. Some one handed him four little corsage bouquets of carnations, which he handed in turn to each one of the tremulous girls, with an appropriate little speech to each.With a grinding of brakes the train came to a standstill, and the crowd gave way to let them pass. Clutching the little bouquets tight and hoping desperately that they would not cry, the girls started for the train.""You dear people,"" she began, but choked and had to try again. ""I--we--want to thank you----"" Then, as two tears forced their way through and rolled unchecked down her face, she turned and ran up the car steps.""None of us did, except Betty,"" said Grace, recovering enough to open the chocolate box she had thoughtfully purchased at a drug store. ""She was the one who really thought up all the things, and all we did was follow where she led.""""Goodness, what's the use of arguing?"" Mollie broke in. ""The fact remains that we've been cheered by a crowd of our friends, made speeches to, and presented with bouquets, and I don't care whose fault it was it all happened. I'm too happy.""""That's a nice way to treat us, I should say,"" cried Mollie disgustedly. ""Just get our curiosity aroused and then sit on it. No, you needn't try to make it up by offering me candy, Betty. I'm just peeved.""And so the journey continued amid a great deal of fun and merriment until the train was nearing Camp Liberty. Then the prospect of seeing the boys and surprising them made the girls so nervous they could hardly sit still.""I did such a foolish thing,"" said Betty, as they, put on their wraps in a flurry of haste. ""I wrote to Allen yesterday and I'll see him before he gets the letter. It would have been better to have brought it along.""A few minutes later the train drew into the station, and a quartette of very pretty girls stepped to the platform. So pretty were they, in fact, that more than one passerby turned around to look a second time.Still feeling as if it were all happening in a dream, they crossed the sidewalk and ran up the steps of the house. Before they had time to ring the bell a stout, middle-aged, motherly-looking woman opened the door and smiled down at them approvingly."
"""We expected you almost an hour sooner,"" she added, as the girls followed her into a big, cheerful front room. ""I was rather afraid there might have been an accident on the road--there have been several lately.""""I'm Mrs. Watson,"" their hostess introduced herself a few minutes later, as she led the way upstairs. ""Mrs. Barton Ross has no doubt told you I am representing the Y.W.C.A. here in Denton. I hope,"" she added, as the girls took off their coats and hats and ""did things"" to their hair, ""that we are going to be friends."" After dinner, the girls were taken over their new domain, and were enthusiastic about it. There were three big parlors where the boys could entertain their friends and relatives, also bedrooms enough to accommodate some score of people over night.""Of course, as you see, we're not nearly in shape yet,"" Mrs. Watson apologized, as they came back to the big front room. ""There are still pictures to be hung, some draperies and odds and ends to be bought that will change the looks of the place entirely. It is with those things you girls can help me immensely, if you will.""""That's what we came for,"" replied Betty quickly, while the other girls looked eager. ""And besides, I think it will be a lark. Somehow, nothing seems half hard or strenuous enough to do for the boys that are giving up so much for us.""""That's the spirit we like to see,"" said Mrs. Watson, looking at the girl's flushed face and shining eyes approvingly. ""And it's the spirit,"" she added slowly, ""that we see among nine-tenths of our girls and women these days. It's wonderful what we are accomplishing.""""It's nothing to what our boys are going to accomplish when they get into the fight,"" broke in Mollie, her eyes big and dark. ""My one regret is that I can't put on a uniform, and fight side by side with them.""""But we can fight side by side with them,"" said Mrs. Watson, leaning forward very seriously. ""Don't you suppose the thought of us and the certainty that we are backing them up with all our might, will be with the boys every minute while they're in the trenches, helping them to fight the Hun as they never would be able to alone?""""Yes,"" said Mollie, impressed but still unconvinced. ""But I should think it would help them ever so much more if we were really there in person. Women have proved themselves just as good fighters as men, you know.""""That might be all right,"" said Amy quietly. ""But then who would stay at home to knit sweaters for them, and who would do the nursing work? We couldn't do that, and be in the trenches at the same time.""""That's the way I look at it,"" said Mrs. Watson, turning to the quiet girl and regarding her thoughtfully. ""It seems to me we are doing far more good here at home where we've had experience, than we could possibly do in the actual fighting. But it's getting pretty late,"" she interrupted herself, ""and you girls must be tired after your long journey. Suppose we get to bed right away, so that in the morning we can start bright and early to get things in shape."""
"""Mrs. Watson made a mistake,"" she said, ""when she put Grace and Amy in the other room. She should have put them in this one, so the sun could take our place and wake them up every morning. Betty, it's a glorious day.""""Don't you suppose I know it?"" asked Betty, shaking herself impatiently, as the tang of the air and the brilliant sunshine got into her blood, making her eager for action. ""And it's only six o'clock,"" she added, appealing to her little wrist watch. ""We'll never be able to get Grace and Amy up this early.""""Won't you, though?"" chuckled a voice from the doorway, and they looked up quickly to find Grace standing there, with Amy laughing at them over her shoulder. And what was still more wonderful and startling--they were dressed!""Yes, there were, lots of them,"" said Grace, stopping before a mirror to tuck in a stray lock that had come loose in the general confusion. ""Only you and Betty were talking so hard and fast, you didn't hear us. Goodness, but I'm hungry.""And after breakfast what a busy morning they spent! Never in all their active lives could they remember anything to equal it. Downtown first of all to shop under Mrs. Watson's guidance, in stores that were so different from those in Deepdale, that they were in great danger of becoming hopelessly confused.""Suppose,"" she suggested, as they rose from the table, ""that we call this a day and spend the afternoon in getting acquainted with the cantonment. It's extremely interesting, especially for those who have never been through one before. What do you say?""""We wanted to surprise you,"" said Betty gleefully, noting with pride how splendid he looked in his uniform. ""You don't seem at all glad to see us. Mrs. Watson,"" remembering her manners in the nick of time, ""this is a friend of ours from Deepdale--Allen Washburn. He didn't know we were coming.""""I was going to look up Frank and Roy, to tell them we'd been granted our five-day furlough. We were going to make a bee line home to Deepdale. Now,"" he added, eyes still on Betty's averted face, ""we won't have to!""""And it's the greatest luck ever,"" Allen continued enthusiastically, as they walked slowly across the parade ground, ""that we happened to get our furlough just now. What are you girls doing this afternoon?""""All right, you stay here then,"" said Allen, conducting them around the corner of one of the low wooden buildings, which the girls afterward learned was the mess hall. ""I'll look up the fellows, and lead the poor unsuspecting----"""
"Betty's eyes almost unconsciously followed the fine, stalwart figure till it disappeared around the corner of one of the buildings, and Mollie, who had been watching her closely, suddenly put an arm about her in a little impulsive hug.They had only a few minutes to wait before Allen came striding back to them, with two other khaki-clad figures. The girls shrank farther back into the shadows of the building. Not until they were almost upon them did the boys catch sight of them. Then Roy and Frank just stood still and gaped, as Allen had done.Then Frank added some equally incoherent phrases, and for a few moments confusion reigned, while they shook hands over and over again, all talked at once to nobody in particular, and generally enjoyed themselves.Before the girls had been half shown about the place, they more than agreed with him. It was wonderfully inspiring, to see those hundreds of boys, with their splendidly trained young bodies and their determined young faces, knowing they were devoting their lives freely and cheerfully to the greatest cause in all history.The girls peeped into the long, low buildings that were the sleeping quarters of the men, with their cots all in a row and clothes hung neatly along the wall. They saw the guardhouse, where unruly soldiers were confined and forced to a state of reasonableness.""It's over at the other end of the parade,"" said Frank, taking Grace's arm and leading her in the direction of the stirring strains. ""Every nice afternoon they have a concert from three to four. It's mighty fine, too.""""So am I,"" said Allen, drawing her away from the party and speaking softly. ""I've seen your face so often in my dreams, Betty, that when you suddenly appeared before me I thought for a minute it was just another of them--more real and vivid, but still a dream. And you are a dream, Betty, the most wonderful dream in all the world!""They enjoyed every minute of that hour's concert, and then felt abused because they could not have more. After that they visited the Y.M.C.A. hut, saw the officers' quarters from the outside, and otherwise amused themselves till the boys declared there was nothing more to be seen.""That's retreat,"" Allen explained. ""If you stand here, you can watch it at close quarters. Here come all the fellows. They have to stand at parade rest, left knee bent, weight on the right foot, guns held in front of them, till the old gun goes off.""Boom! The girls jumped but retained presence of mind enough to stand at attention as Allen had cautioned them. The boys were standing stiff and straight as ramrods, hands at salute, their young faces grave and tense.The band played the ""Star-Spangled Banner,"" and never had it thrilled the girls as it thrilled them now. It brought tears to their eyes, yet they wanted to shout with pride and patriotism. Their star-spangled banner, oh, long might it wave, o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!About a week after their arrival, Grace had received a letter from him, saying that he was coming on for an indefinite stay. Betty found her friend with the letter clenched tight in one hand, while the other crushed a handkerchief into a hard little ball."
"""No, I suppose you couldn't exactly call it that,"" said Grace wearily, folding up the letter and replacing it carefully in its envelope. ""As a rule I'd think it was mighty good news. Will is coming to Camp Liberty.""""He said he was coming on business,"" Grace replied listlessly, then added, with a sudden fierce outburst of emotion: ""I wish he'd stay in Deepdale. I wish, if he can't be honorable and live up to his ideals like the other boys, he wouldn't come where they are. If he is my brother, I'm ashamed----""""Hush, Grace, hush,"" cried Betty soothingly, putting a firm hand over her friend's mouth. ""You're all excited and worked up now or you wouldn't say such things. Didn't I tell you before that Will has his reasons? Are you going to let a friend have more faith in him than his own sister?""""Betty Nelson,"" Grace began angrily, then broke down and began to sob weakly. ""I can't help it,"" she said, as Betty tried to comfort her. ""I've always loved Will so, and been so proud of him. He's been such a good brother, too! I simply can't understand it!""""Never mind,"" went on Betty soothingly, trying desperately to think of something really comforting to say. ""Maybe after Will gets here he'll explain things. Till then, as my mother says, we'll just be 'canty wi' thinkin' aboot it.'""But when the conversation was reported to the other girls, it troubled them a good deal, and they longed to solve the mystery. And when Will came he refused to be of any help whatever, keeping almost entirely to himself, and answering questions put to him vaguely, if at all. His actions became more and more mysterious, and it was absolutely impossible to make him out.Then something happened that for a time drove the mystery from their minds. It was after a particularly long and hard day, when the girls had been entertaining at the Hostess House all morning and part of the afternoon.Then about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, they had gone downtown to do some very necessary shopping, and had been unable to get back to dinner till seven o'clock; and that evening the boys had arranged to take them to the theater.""I never felt so sleepy in my life,"" said Grace, sitting down on the edge of the bed and stretching her arms above her head. ""And yet we've had such a good time. If somebody doesn't give me another chocolate I won't be able to stay awake long enough to get undressed. Thanks, Amy, you always were a friend of mine.""""Well, I never laughed so much in my life,"" declared Mollie, pulling off her slipper and wiggling her toes contentedly. ""I think it's perfectly wonderful to go out with the boys in uniform. They look so splendid and we feel so very important."""
"And they slept the hearty sleep of tired girlhood till about four o'clock in the morning. Then Amy, in the room next to Betty and Mollie, rubbed her eyes, coughed a little, then sat up with a cry of alarm.Slowly the heavy eyelids opened, then Grace struggled to a sitting posture, supported by Amy's quivering arm, and gazed wildly about her. Then she sprang to her feet, swaying dizzily, and with Amy's arm still about her, they felt blindly for the door.""We must--get--them--out!"" gasped Grace, rushing into their chums' room and frantically shaking Betty, while Amy vainly tried to waken Mollie. The girls still slept on in the semblance of ordinary, healthy slumber.The fire, which had started inside, and had gained a good foothold before any trace of it could be seen from the outside, had been discovered by one of the guards, who had immediately sent in an alarm. Already the shriek of the fire engine could be heard, soldiers were being hurried out from the barracks to help in the rescue work, and all was noise and confusion.Flames lapped at him hungrily as he forced his mad way through them, smoke choked him, blinded him, and yet he must go on. Betty--Betty... A section of the stairs gave way before him and he had to jump to keep from going with it.Was this the head of the stairs? He felt for it with his hand and pulled it back with an involuntary cry of pain. He was horribly burned, his hands, his face, his hair--his clothing had started. He beat at them as he ran. He must live until he had rescued Betty--and then----A door. Fumblingly he opened it--then forced it shut from the other side. Blindly he felt for the bed. Yes, she was here. Thank God he had found her! But there was another figure--someone else to save.Then he felt a sharp pain. He looked down and found that the flames were rapidly creeping up--creeping up... There was a rug on the floor--with feverish haste he wrapped himself in it--smothering the flames. He must live until----Sobbing now, his breath coming in great gasps, Allen rushed back to the bed, picked up one of the figures, and staggered with it back to the window. They saw him standing there; and a great cheer went up from the spectators.Allen paused for a moment, steadying hand on the windowsill, then gathered himself for the last great effort. The bed was invisible now, the room an inferno--he had to fight every step of the way back to the bed. Then he found what he sought, and fought the slow fight back to the window."
"But his strength was going--going--his arms were iron weights--the room was going black. With a great effort he fought off the faintness. Then he saw a great, helmeted head peering in at him from the window.Allen's head jerked up proudly, and he forced still a little more from that splendid reserve of strength. Afterward he could never remember how he clambered over that windowsill, and got his feet upon the ladder.That he did it and managed the descent with the aid of the firemen, he afterward learned from his friends. All he could remember, was the great shout which came to him like a little murmur that went up from the crowd at sight of him.Fascinated, Allen watched the door as it slowly opened, admitting--Betty! Betty, sweeter and more beautiful than he had ever seen her. Her eyes widened at sight of him, and she ran forward impulsively.She thoughtfully regarded the hand he still held, yet did not try to draw it away. Instead she smiled a little--a smile that set Allen's heart to throbbing painfully, and said, so softly he could hardly hear her:""I--I'm not the only one,"" said Betty, startled at what she had done. ""Everybody is talking about you and praising you to the skies, and there was even a piece about you in the paper. I--I'm afraid when you are able to get out and hear how everybody is raving about you, you'll be spoiled entirely.""""Betty,"" he commanded, in so very different a tone from any he had ever used before that she started and looked at him shyly, ""what are you running on about such nonsense for? If I did anything, it was for you and because I loved you, Betty. There wasn't any heroism. I don't deserve any fuss about it and I don't want any thanks. I don't deserve any. You weren't hurt, Betty?""""No,"" she answered softly, not daring to look at him. This was such a different Allen and so wonderfully attractive. ""Mollie and I were both a little sick from the smoke and shock, but it didn't take us long to recover. You were the one who was so terribly burned that for one horrible long day, the doctors didn't know whether you'd pull through or not. Oh, Allen, that awful day!""""I--I never want to live through another one like it,"" she said with a little shiver, then suddenly rose to go. ""The doctor said you mustn't be excited,"" she explained as he looked up at her reproachfully. ""And I,"" she looked away again, ""I just wanted to--thank you, Allen--but if you won't let me----""It was Sunday afternoon, and the young folks had hired two automobiles for a trip out into the country. It was more than two weeks since the fire, and all but Allen had completely recovered from it. He, however, still felt a little ""wabbly,"" so the boys and girls had conferred together, deciding that an automobile trip was just what he needed to complete his recovery."
"""Gee,"" said Roy, waxing excited, ""do you call it hard luck to get a chance at being a hero, twice in three months, and have all the girls falling down and worshiping you, and all the old ladies patting you on the back----""""Yes,"" said Allen with a grimace, ""if anybody'd started to patting me at that time, I'd have returned pat for pat--only mine wouldn't have been gentle. Two cents for your thoughts, Betty. You haven't said a word all the way.""""Probably they weren't worth it,"" said Roy, to be promptly subdued by a look from Mollie's black eyes. ""As I was saying,"" he continued, hastily changing the subject. ""I'd consider myself in luck if I'd rescued two beautiful damsels----""""I felt anything but dramatic at the time,"" said Allen ruefully. ""The funny part of it is that I've always had a secret longing to do something of the sort--just to get the sensation. That,"" he paused dramatically, ""cured me!""""I should think it would cure most anybody,"" said Mollie with a grimace. ""Neither Betty or I are particularly light weights. I don't see how you managed it, Allen--in the heat and the smoke and everything.""While the Hostess House was in process of repair some friendly families living in the vicinity had opened their doors wide to the girls and the other visitors at the Hostess House. The fire had done a great deal of damage, but the house had been amply insured, and the work of rebuilding was proceeding as fast as possible. Meanwhile, the girls were going on with their work as usual, though eagerly looking forward to the time when they should be installed in their proper quarters again.To-day he had consented to accompany them, and during the early part of the ride had seemed in hilarious spirits. Now, for the last fifteen minutes or so, he had appeared gloomy and preoccupied, but as they neared the spot where they had decided to eat their lunch, his spirits seemed to revive somewhat, and he became talkative again.""Oh, well, what does it matter, anyway?"" said Frank philosophically, as he swung the car around a curve, and brought it to a standstill. ""I won't mind being an under dog or anything else as long as I get my share of the eats. Don't you think this is rather a pretty spot to have lunch?""""How are you feeling?"" asked Betty as they followed the others up the grassy slope to a sort of ledge--just the kind of place for a picnic lunch. She did not look at him. Somehow, it was almost impossible to look at Allen, these days. It was raining torrents outside, and the girls were seated in one of the big parlors of the Hostess House. As usual, they were knitting, and their tongues kept time to the rapid click, click, of their needles.They were exceptionally thoughtful and, as Amy expressed it, ""their mood matched the weather."" The war was not going as well as every one had hoped. The dark cloud was growing darker and darker every day, and each morning paper seemed to bring more disquieting news than the one before."
"""And it won't be long now,"" Mollie was saying, ""before our boys are sent across. It's almost time for the second draft, and the camps will have to be emptied of the first troops. And when they're gone----"" she bowed her head to hide the unbidden tears that were glistening in her eyes.""Yes, it will be terrible,"" said Betty, trying hard to keep the telltale tremulousness from her voice--trying desperately to sound brave and resigned. ""But we must remember that thousands of women and girls all over the United States are going through the same thing. And for the boys' sake, we must be cheerful.""""Yes,"" said Amy quietly, ""and I don't think anybody who hasn't been close to military life, as we have been, can realize how great the American army will be. It's meeting the boys day after day, seeing them get more enthusiastic as the time comes near for them to face those terrible guns----""""I feel as if I wanted to go down on my knees to every boy in uniform,"" cried Betty, gripping the arms of her chair till the knuckles showed white. ""No matter how hard we try we can't make up to them for what they're giving up--and giving up so cheerfully. And they're so dear and appreciative and thankful for every little thing that we have done for them, it makes me want to cry.""And have you noticed,"" she continued, while the girls stopped their work to watch her, ""what happens if you ask them about their home folks? Their faces light up, and right away they begin to talk about 'mother.'""'You know,' one of them said to me just a little while ago, 'when I first came to camp, I didn't exactly feel homesick, as I'd expected to; I just felt queer and uneasy and restless. For a couple of nights I couldn't sleep, just kept tossing and turning till reveille routed me out again. Then suddenly, one night, I found out what the matter was. I wasn't homesick; I was just missing my mother.'""A few days after that he came up to me. 'You won't laugh, if I tell you something?' he asked. 'On my word of honor,' I answered him. 'Well,' he said, looking so dear and sheepish, I had all I could do to keep from hugging him, 'as soon as I found out what you said about home being mother, I just put the picture I had of her under my pillow, and honest, I've slept like a baby ever since.'""""And to think boys like that,"" cried Mollie, knitting fast to keep time with her feelings, ""to think boys like that have to go over to the other side, and be mowed down by the thousands. Oh, I can't believe it!""""I guess we've all sort of closed our eyes to it, till now,"" said Grace, so unlike her usual self that she had completely forgotten to eat candy for fifteen minutes. ""But we can't go on like that forever. When it comes right down to us and we lose somebody we care for--"" her voice broke and the girls went on knitting faster than ever, fearing a general breakdown.""It's Allen,"" Betty answered, waving to the splendid specimen of manhood who was coming up the porch two steps at a time. ""He looks as if he had some good news for us. You let him in, will you, Amy? You're nearest the door."""
"""Oh, isn't that wonderful!"" they cried together, and thereafter arose a very babel of questions as to where, when and how the promotion had occurred, which Allen answered one after another with equal enthusiasm.""But, Allen,"" Betty broke in, struck by a sudden thought, ""you said something about _your_ having run into good luck. Was it something that happened to you personally, or was it just the good luck of being the friend of a corporal?""""You see,"" Allen explained, ""there's a chance for promotion now that there never was before. New men are coming in by the hundreds, and those men have to have officers. There's really no end to the chances if you just stick to the big game and do your level best. You're sure to win something good in the end.""""Saw Will, too, on the way up,"" he said, and at the name the girls all put down their knitting and looked at him inquiringly. ""He seemed to be immensely excited about something. Fact is, I don't think he would even have seen me if I hadn't gotten in his way and flagged him. Mark my words--that boy's got something big up his sleeve. I bet he's going to surprise us all some day.""""No,"" he answered, adding with a sincerity that brought a light of unutterable gladness to Grace's eyes: ""But I've met lots of fellows in my business, and have learned to size them up pretty well. And if there was ever a brainy, plucky, true-blue fellow in this world, his name is Will Ford!""""Well, I should say it was just about time,"" said Grace, carefully arranging her hat before the mirror. ""If it hadn't cleared up pretty soon, I'd have stopped hoping. Are the other girls nearly ready?""As the four girls walked down to the main gate of the cantonment, they nodded and smiled continually to the khaki-clad, respectfully-saluting boys they passed; for the fame of the girls at the Hostess House had spread all over the barracks, and the boys always looked forward to catching a smile or two or a merry word as they passed.Many there were who had been sentimentally inclined, but the Deepdale boys had well nigh monopolized the girls from their home town and by their actions had warned off all would-be intruders almost as plainly as though they had put out a sign.But stopping every few minutes to speak to some one you know, necessarily makes progress slow, and it was some time before the girls succeeded in reaching the gate and turning their steps toward the country.""Yes, it makes me feel dizzy sometimes,"" said Mollie, with a little perplexed frown. ""I feel as if I wanted to get hold of him by the forelock and hold him back. He's in altogether too much of a hurry.""""If we can only see that each one of the boys who can't go home for Thanksgiving gets a regular, old-fashioned home-cooked dinner,"" said Betty earnestly, ""I'll feel as if we'd done some good in the world.""""Yes, the people around here have certainly helped us more than we dared to hope,"" said Betty enthusiastically. ""We've hardly found one so far who wasn't willing to open his house--and his heart, too, for that matter--to the soldier boys. I love them all for being so generous. It's done more than anything else to keep up the boys' spirits and send them away happy and healthy and confident.""""We have walked a good deal, lately,"" laughed Betty. ""But it's nothing to what we _have_ done. Champion hikers like us shouldn't complain about ordinary walking. Here we are at the Shroths. Now look your prettiest and smile your sweetest for the sake of the soldier boys!"""
"""I saw you coming, my dears,"" she said, settling down comfortably in an enveloping armchair, ""and I'm almost sure I know what you have come to ask me. And you needn't even ask,"" she added, raising her hand as Betty started to speak, ""for the request was granted two weeks ago. My whole house is at your disposal--to do with as you please.""""The admiration is mutual,"" she said, and then Betty's heart went out to her entirely. ""I've watched you girls for a long time, and the work you've done for the boys has been simply splendid. I've tried to help all I could---""""And I've been grateful to you,"" Mrs. Shroth added, in her sweet voice, ""for showing me how best I could serve the boys and my country. Now, how many do you think I could accommodate for Thanksgiving dinner--or rather, how many would you like me to accommodate?""""Oh, nonsense,"" said Mrs. Shroth, brushing the suggestion aside. ""Two or three boys would be lost in this big house, even counting all my relatives who usually spend Thanksgiving day with me. No, I can take half a dozen, at least.""""It's such a little thing,"" she said, as she stood on the porch to say good-bye to them, ""that I feel almost guilty to take thanks for it. Good luck."" The girls went on down the street with singing hearts and a warm sense of friendliness and love for all their fellow beings.""Oh, every one's so kind and dear and anxious to help,"" cried Mollie, skipping a little in her delight, ""that your heart just feels too big to stay inside. Seems as if it ought to come out in the open where everybody can see how hard it's beating.""""It's wonderful,"" said Amy softly, ""what a comfortable, warm feeling it gives you to find people--some of them you never knew before--who are really working side by side with you for the same thing, ready to hold out a helping hand when you need it.""""Yes,"" agreed Betty, her eyes fixed dreamily on the horizon, ""it makes you feel as if there weren't any strangers in the world, as if we were all just friends, working for the common good of everybody.""""I'll never forget one thing that happened to me,"" said Amy, and they looked at her lovingly. Amy was such a dear--but then everybody was that to-night! ""It was only a little thing, and yet it made me think.""""You know,"" Amy went on, so deep in her own thoughts, she scarcely noticed the interruption, ""I never did talk much--I always felt as if people were cold and unfriendly--and so kept to myself, except for my really good friends, of course. Then, one morning, I saw that it was all my own fault.""I just happened to be walking along the street, not noticing anybody particularly, when an old woman dropped her nickel car fare and it rolled out into the middle of the street. I ran after it and gave it back to her, and she smiled at me. Somehow, that smile changed everything for me.""""Why,"" said Amy, blushing in her enthusiasm, ""it just made me feel as if everybody was ready to smile if you only gave them half a chance. And I've found out it was true,"" she finished decidedly. ""Because I've tried it ever so many times since, and it's never once failed!""With the strategy of a general, Betty dodged a couple of dirt piles--it was a row of small houses, in process of construction near the camp--slipped across between two of the houses and did actually succeed in cutting the spy off."
"She caught a fleeting glimpse of him as he dodged into a doorway with the evident intention of hiding till they got tired of the hunt. Also, it was certain he had not seen Betty and had no idea that she had seen him.With wildly beating heart, but no thought of turning back, the Little Captain picked up a big piece of wood that could serve excellently as a weapon and ran for the doorway through which the spy had disappeared.Cautiously she opened the door, and the next moment thought her heart would stop beating altogether as she took in the situation. The man was fumbling desperately with the knob of the inside door. Evidently it was locked. He had fallen into a trap!""Betty, Betty, where are you?"" cried a voice close at hand and the Little Captain gave a gasp of dismay. As long as the man had not known he was trapped, there might be a chance that he would remain quiet, hoping they would pass without thinking to look into the house. But now! Some one was pushing against the other side of the door. He was trying to get out!The man was hurling himself against the door with all the force of desperation, but the girls had not spent most of their life in the open for nothing. They held on gallantly, though in their hearts they knew that if help were very long in coming, there could be but one answer. They were three against one, it is true, but then they were girls and he was a man, and a desperate man.They listened breathlessly for a moment--then the wonderful truth dawned. Help was coming, and coming swiftly! There was no sound, save the regular thud-thud of running feet, but the most beautiful music in the world would have had no charms in comparison with that rhythmic sound.Adolph Hensler was not easy to handle, even after he found himself looking into the muzzles of two loaded revolvers. Even then he tried to escape and the guard was forced to shoot a couple of bullets over his head before he was scared into submission.The girls walked home behind captive and captors, too breathless and excited even to think. They had not gone far before they met Amy coming toward them, trembling all over from fatigue and excitement.""I was about half way to camp,"" she explained, ""when I saw Will and the three soldiers coming toward me. When I had managed to gasp out what I'd come for they didn't say a word--just put on full speed and ran.""They were nervous, too, for every once in a while one of them would get up, look out the window, throw an extra log upon the fire and sit down again with a ""why-don't-they-come?"" look of impatience upon her face.This time there was no mistake. A chorus of excited voices greeted Betty as she opened the door for them and a moment later the boys burst into the living-room, fairly exhaling importance. The girls welcomed them eagerly and drew up more chairs before the fire."
"""Just that,"" he answered, enjoying their mystification too much to enlighten them at once. ""When he received the order he told us fellows to come on over and he'd join us as soon as he could break away.""""I'm sorry, Grace--I didn't think,"" said Allen, in quick compunction. ""It means,"" he added, with a ring of pride in his voice, ""that Will is what we always believed him to be--one of the finest fellows that ever lived. I'm proud to be called his friend!""""Well,"" Allen continued, while Betty put a sympathetic arm about her friend and snuggled close, ""all the time we were wondering down in our hearts why Will didn't enlist--although we never doubted he had good reasons,"" he added hastily, ""he was really working harder, spending more time and energy for the government than we ever thought of spending. There's one important thing we forgot--that Will was a secret service man!""""Why,"" said Betty, leaning forward eagerly, ""after Amy told us that she had met Will and the soldiers half way to the spot where we found the spy, I seemed to see the whole thing as plainly as if some one had told it to me.""I remembered Will's special interest in the spy the first time we met Adolph Hensler on Pine Island--then how, soon after we saw him here again, Will wrote Grace that he was coming on. That would seem as though he were hot on his trail--""""Well, the rest is simple,"" said Betty. ""I suppose that Will kept on shadowing him till he got what he wanted. He was on his way to capture the spy, while we were hanging on to the door, praying for help. Oh, it all fits together like parts of a puzzle!""""You're a wonder, Betty!"" said Allen, while the others drew a deep breath, trying to take it all in. ""But there was one little bit, or rather, I should say, big bit, of cleverness on Will's part that neither you nor anybody else could guess at. You remember the code letter we picked up that night on Pine Island?""""Surely no experienced forger could have done it better,"" Allen agreed whimsically, while the girls waited with unconcealed impatience. ""Anyway, he wrote a short note--a decoy--to Adolph in this handwriting, requesting an interview at the very spot where you girls came upon him.""""Why, it was Betty who thought of cutting him off,"" she said, while Betty vainly tried to stop her. ""No, I'm going to tell the truth! And it was Betty that really captured him. She saw him go in the door, followed him, and was holding on for dear life when we came upon her.""""Yes, and how long would I have been able to hold on, I'd like to know,"" protested the Little Captain vigorously, ""if you girls hadn't come along just then. No, sir, if there's any credit at all, it's got to be divided equally among us!""""But Will is the real hero,"" said Betty quietly. ""To go on working for your county, taking a chance on having people think things of you that you don't deserve, that sort of thing is the real heroism.""""Oh, he'll be here almost any minute now,"" said Allen reassuringly. ""Meanwhile, suppose you play something for us, Betty--something soft and sweet to match the firelight--and you,"" this last so softly that none but Betty heard."
