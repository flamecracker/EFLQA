passage
"""What's on your mind now, Rand?"" his companion queried, a boy of about the same age, nearly as tall, but more stoutly built, and as light in complexion as the other was dark. The two were standing at the top of the road that wound down the side of the mountain from the town of Creston, which was perched, like the nest of some great bird, in a hollow of the Palisades.It was just after dawn of a June morning that the boys were assembling. It was still dark and gloomy, for it had rained during the night and the storm had not yet passed, but the boys having planned a fishing trip for this morning were not to be deterred by the fear of a wet jacket.""Hello, fellows!"" panted the newcomer, who was smaller and slighter than either of the others, but who made up in activity and energy what he lacked in size. His hair was a glowing red and with it went a temper so quick that the nickname, Pepper, that some chum had given him, was most appropriate. It is doubtful if any of his comrades really knew his Christian name. Certainly he was always ""Pepper"" to every one, even at home, although he was christened Philip.""Now, you know I didn't wait for breakfast,"" protested Pepper, adding rather reluctantly, ""though I did stop for a bite. But even if I am late I'm not last. Jack isn't here yet, and he left home first.""""Oh, he's out on the trail somewhere, I suppose,"" surmised Donald. ""He's always chasing for news. He'll be coming along presently with a whole budget. I believe he thinks the paper couldn't go on if it weren't for him.""""What is it?"" asked Pepper, eying it suspiciously. ""Looks as if the cat had been walking on it."" goodness, I hope not. I thought you were always hungry, but if you are only beginning I foresee a famine ahead of us. And to think of all the good food that is wasted on you, Pepper,"" went on Donald reflectively. ""Why, to look at you any one might think that you never had had enough to eat.""They had gone perhaps about halfway down the hill toward the boathouse when a big bay horse, drawing a light wagon in which were three boys, came quickly around a turn in the road. It bore down on them so suddenly that only by a rapid scramble up the bank by the side of the road did Rand and Donald save themselves from being bowled over.The newcomers would have driven on with a jeering laugh only that Pepper, angry at what obedience, neatness and order are Scout virtues. Endurance, self-reliance, self-control and an effort to help some one else are Scout objectives.""""Speaking of tracking,"" interjected Donald, ""in my opinion it were no bad plan to be making tracks toward the boathouse if we are going to get anywhere the day. It is getting bright in the east and it looks like a clear day, after all. And I may also take occasion to remark that I haven't had my breakfast yet, and this Boy Scout business doesn't sound inviting on an empty stomach. We can discuss it with more comfort when we have had a bite."""
"""Shades of Lindley Murray!"" exclaimed Rand, ""do I hear aright? What's them! And you a graduate of number one. Really, Pepper Blake, I don't believe we can let you in on this. What do you think about it, Don?""""That is better,"" drawled Rand. ""It not only sounds good, but it is good, as you elegantly express it. IT, according to the pamphlet that I have here, is an organization for boys between the ages of twelve and eighteen to train them in self-reliance, manhood and good citizenship. The movement is not essentially military,"" went on Rand, ""but the military virtues of discipline, looked like a deliberate attempt to run over them, sprang to the horse's head as it was passing, catching the bridle, and with a loud ""whoa"" he brought the outfit to a stop.""Aw, g-g-go on, kiddie!"" retorted Jim, a stout lad of about Rand's age, with a freckled face and a shock of aggressive red hair, mimicking Pepper, who, when excited, sometimes stuttered. ""Aw, g-g-go on. Little boys shouldn't play in the road.""""You mean a wind bag, don't you?"" sneered Jim, aiming a blow at Pepper, who now loosened his hold upon the horse's bridle to jump toward the wagon, whereupon Jim changed his purpose and struck the horse with the whip. With a loud ""giddap"" they started with a bound, missing Pepper by a hair's breadth, and driving on down the road at a rattling pace.The only answer of the boys in the wagon was a taunting laugh as they drove away. Randolph and Donald had taken no part in the controversy, not exactly approving of Pepper's disputing with the enemy, but they had stood at hand ready for any emergency should one arise.""Right as usual, Donald,"" laughed Rand, ""but I wasn't looking for anything to throw at him. I just happened to see this lying on the ground and picked it up."" Holding out a coin he had found, he added: ""What do you make of it?""""And on the other side is shown the ship wrecked on some rocks. Something about wrecking the Constitution, I suppose,"" added Rand. ""This side says, 'Van Buren Metallic Current,' with the date '1837',"" put in Donald.""Why, instead of a ship this one shows, on the one side, a man in a chest with a sword in one hand and a bag of money in the other, and around the edge are the words, 'I take the responsibility.' The other side has the wreck like the first one,"" concluded Rand after he had examined them.""They certainly are not common,"" went on Rand, ""and people don't usually carry them in their pockets. I'd like to know the history of these and how they came here, but I don't suppose I ever shall. But, speaking of curious things, what do you suppose Monkey Rae was doing with that horse and wagon?"""
"""Well,"" began Pepper as soon as they were fairly inside the house, ""didn't I hear somebody say breakfast?"" at the same time starting to get out of the locker the various utensils that the boys kept at the house to cook with on their fishing trips.""Hold on there, Pepper,"" remonstrated Donald, as Pepper continued to pull out one pan after another. ""We don't need ail that stuff. What do you think you are going to do, get up a banquet? If you are going to use ail those pots and pans, son, you will have to wash them by your lonesome.""Pepper was about to retort in kind when there was a quick step outside the door and an alert-looking, brown-haired, brown-eyed boy, with his cap perched upon the back of his head, dashed into the room.""Oh, there is something worth while to-day,"" replied Jack, drawing a box up to the plank that served as a table. ""Pass me some of those biscuits, Pepper, if you don't mind sparing a few, so I can eat while I talk."" While the boys are finishing their breakfast it may be well to introduce them to the reader. The four, who were known among their acquaintances as the ""inseparables,"" had been classmates for several terms at School No. I, of Creston, from which they had graduated the previous year and were now students of the Hilltop Academy, where they were preparing for college.Rand--Randolph in full, surname Peyton--who was slightly the eldest of the four, was the nephew of Mr. Scott, president of the Creston National Bank. He was a native of Virginia, having come to Creston after the death of his father some two years before this time, with his mother and sister. He was bright, but inclined to be indolent, except when aroused, when his energy knew no limit. He was slow in speech, having the soft Southern drawl with a tendency to slur his r's, and was a natural leader among his companions, both in their sports and their studies.Donald Graeme, sometimes nicknamed Old Solomon, was the son of the chief engineer of the Creston Paper Mills, and one of a considerable family of boys and girls. He was of Scotch descent and inherited many of the characteristics of his ancestry as well as many of their superstitions. Something of the burr clung to his tongue, and he was given to the occasional use of a Scotch word or phrase. He had also the Scotch canniness and never committed himself by a positive opinion. Although not as quick as Rand, he was more persistent and usually carried out, to the end, anything that he entered upon.Jack Blake was the oldest son of Mr. Blake, editor and publisher of the Crest, the newspaper of the town. Brought up in the newspaper atmosphere, Jack had early developed a nose for news and was the best reporter, although unofficial, on the paper. He was always on the lookout for items and always putting two and two together, sometimes with most surprising results.Lastly, Pepper Blake, Jack's younger brother, who was of a quicker, more nervous, disposition than the others and given to stammering when excited. Impetuous and quick-tempered, he was always getting into difficulties, but always finding a way out. Romantic and imaginative, but with a streak of hard horse-sense beneath.""Well, all I know is, Officer Dugan found a window open this morning and the place all upside down. The judge hadn't come down yet, so they don't know what's missing. From the tracks around it looks as if some boys were mixed up in it."""
"""Now I wonder,"" mused Jack, when the story of the encounter with Monkey Rae and his companions had been gone over in detail for his benefit, ""what Monkey Rae has to do with these things,"" jingling the coins in his hand.""All right, let it go,"" ordered Rand. ""Easy now, if you don't want to scare all the fish away. What are you trying to do?"" as Jack gave the anchor a swing and, failing to let go of the painter, promptly went overboard with it.""No, the colonel didn't say that,"" explained Jack, as he landed a good-sized perch in the bottom of the boat, ""there's one for luck. That was a comment of my own. Wait until I put a fresh bait on and I will tell you what he did say. He said--""""This isn't a police patrol,"" laughed Jack, ""this is a patrol in the Boy Scouts. It's a company of from six to eight boys. Two or more patrols form a troop under a scoutmaster who teaches them a lot of things."" ""Here comes the Dart,"" announced Jack, as a hoarse whistle sounded down the river. The anchor had, by this time, been lifted into the boat and they had started to row toward the shore. ""She has a whistle like an ocean liner.""The Dart, a long, low, white yacht, was coming up the river at full speed, the water curling away from her bow in a miniature cascade, the powerful engines driving her through the water with the speed of an express train.""That chap is all right,"" concluded Rand, after he had watched the canoe for a little while. ""He knows how to handle it. He is doing fine. See, he is just touching the water with his paddle, so as to keep it head-on. Maybe he thinks we will need some help.""""Now look at that!"" cried Donald suddenly, when the boys were a hundred yards from the canoe. ""Did you ever see such a fool trick as that? Just when he was coming out all right, too. Pull for ail you are worth, boys!""What had called forth Donald's exclamation was, that just as the Dart was passing the canoe one of the girls, who was seated in the stern, had suddenly risen to her feet to wave her handkerchief at some one on the yacht. As she stood up the swell from the yacht caught the light craft, rolling it from side to side, and the girl losing her balance pitched headlong over the side of the boat, capsizing it. In a moment they were all struggling in the river. As the canoe went over the man caught the girl nearest to him and helped her to the boat and then turned to aid the other girl, but she had disappeared."
"""I don't see anything of her,"" said Rand, who was standing in the bow of the boat intently watching for any sign of the girl. ""Yes, there she is."" A pale face had appeared for a moment on the surface. ""Straight ahead, boys!""As the boat came to the spot where he had seen her Rand made a long dive overboard, coming up a moment later with the inanimate body of the girl. He was joined almost immediately by Donald, who had followed him overboard, and so aided him in supporting her until Pepper and Jack had reached them with the boat.It required no little effort on the part of the boys to get the helpless girl into the boat, but it was finally done, and they rowed back to the assistance of the others. The other girl was helped from the overturned canoe, to which she was clinging, into their boat which was now loaded to its full capacity.""Is she alive?"" asked the other girl, as she was helped into the boat, looking fearfully at the girl lying in the stern. ""Very much so,"" answered Pepper, who had been feeling her pulse. ""The first thing to do is to get some of the water out of her lungs, if there is any there. Hold her with her head down. That's all right! Now, then, let's get ashore as fast as we can.""As the canoe had overturned the captain of the Dart, who was in the pilot house, seeing the accident, had rung for slow speed and, putting the yacht about, hurried back to the place. But, except for the fortunate presence of the boys, it is doubtful if he would have arrived in time to be of any assistance.""All right,"" responded Mr. Whilden, ""we'll take her on board. Can you come alongside?"" This end was shortly accomplished, then, lifting the girl up in their arms, Donald and Rand passed her to Mr. Whilden and the captain.At this moment there was a scream from a lady on the yacht as she caught sight of the girl. ""Why it is Nellie! She is dead!"" she cried, and would have fallen to the deck if she had not been caught by Mr. Whilden.""And where are they?"" asked Mr. Whilden. ""I had almost forgotten them in the excitement,"" turning to the boys, who had come on board to learn as to the fate of the girl. Shaking hands with them again and again, he explained: ""She is my daughter. I hadn't any idea she was anywhere near, and I don't see how it happened yet. Why, hello, Frank!"" addressing the young man who had been in the canoe, and who was now wringing the water from his clothes. ""What in the world were you doing here?"""
"""I thought I did, too,"" replied Frank, ""but Nellie saw you on the deck and, forgetting where she was, attempted to stand up to wave her handkerchief to you, and, the next thing we knew we were all in the water.""At this instant, as their backs were turned, a boy ran swiftly from a nearby clump of bushes, snatched the pan from the stove, overturning the latter as he did so, and silently dashed back into the woods.The boys set out at once in pursuit of the thief, but he had too long a start, and perhaps, some knowledge of the locality, and after a vain hunt they straggled back to the boat without having found any trace of him.""Well, that's the meanest thing yet,"" grumbled Pepper, looking at the overturned stove. ""The oil has all run out and we can't cook any more,"" he went on, with so gloomy an expression that, in spite of their anger against Monkey Rae, the others could not help laughing.""Suppose you let me show you how to cook without a stove. Jack, see if you can't find some dry leaves and small twigs. Rand, you can get some bigger pieces, plenty of them. That's the kind. And, Pepper, you and Don bring up a lot of that clay from down there by the water. That's the stuff. Now wrap your fish up in a coat of clay. Never mind the scales. Coat them all over and pile them up here as fast as you get them ready. If we only had some flour we'd have a dinner in the real scout style.""""That's the idea,"" said the colonel, who, while talking, had been packing the fish in two layers on a flat rock. ""Now put your leaves on--not too many--lay on your pieces, Rand, pile them up so as to leave a draught. That's it; now, Jack, touch it off.""Stooping down, the colonel waited a moment until there was a lull in the wind, when he struck the match, shielding it with his hand until it blazed up, and then touched it to the leaves, which, catching the fire, were soon blazing fiercely.""We didn't know we were in the enemy's country,"" said Rand, ""but I guess it is the enemy's country, wherever Monkey is. I'll take the first turn,"" going off and circling about the place. ""I guess he's gone,"" he said to himself, but no harm looking!""""Now,"" began the colonel, when they had finished their meal, unanimously voting it the best dinner they had ever eaten, ""I know you all have been wondering how I happened to be here when you came along.""""Speaking of angels, I see,"" said the colonel. ""The fact is, boys, I've got a little shack down here in the woods and whenever I get tired of town I come out here and get a breath of the woods, and I was out here to-day.""""Here is the trail,"" replied the colonel, pointing it out as he spoke. ""Here is the print of a foot on the dirt and here is another. Here is a bigger and a heavier one; a man made those. You can see one of them is deeper than the other, showing more weight on that side.""""Practice and observation,"" answered the colonel. ""That trail is as plain as day. There wasn't any attempt to hide it. Why, out on the plains a scout would follow it at a gallop. See how far you can track it."""
"But with much care and patience the boys were able to follow the track for a considerable distance, losing it every now and then and picking it up again, Rand being the quickest and Donald the most persistent; ail of them getting a little more expert as they went on.A short walk brought them to the shack, which was set in a little clearing in the woods. It was one-story high and about sixteen feet square, with a small kitchen in the back. It was provided with two doors, numerous windows, and had a small porch in front. It was ceiled inside and scantily furnished with a few chairs, a couple of tables and a couch, but the walls were ornamented with the heads of deer and elk, as well as the skins of smaller animals, and the floor was covered with bear and panther skins. Over the big fireplace hung a shotgun with a couple of rifles, and several Indian bows stood in one corner.""Not much of a story,"" replied the colonel. ""It was killed on a trip I made up in the Canadian Northwest, and it was a narrow escape for me, too. It was killed by an arrow from one of those bows there.""""It says,"" read Rand, ""a scout is a friend to all and a brother to every other scout, no matter to what social class the other belongs. A scout accepts the other man as he finds him, and makes the best of him.""""When we are going into battle, my boy,"" said the colonel, stopping on the way for a moment, ""we don't stop to consider to what class the man who is fighting alongside of us belongs, and this is a battle you are going into, one to make the most you can out of your lives, and if you can help some one else at the same time so much the greater is your reward.""Following the colonel's directions, the boys went down to the landing where they found the Scout, a 25-foot cat-boat, moored. Jumping on board they made ready to cast her loose, took the stops off the sail and had it partly hoisted when the colonel came along bringing with him a gun.With the wind on her quarter the Scout sped up the river on a course that would bring her near to the opposite shore, a little in front of the boat they were pursuing, the occupants of which, evidently having no thought of pursuit, were rowing in a leisurely fashion. It was not until the Scout was almost upon them that they gave it any attention, and then only enough to change their course sufficiently to keep out of her way.""In with the sheet!"" called the colonel, quickly bringing the Scout around; ""there, that will do!"" as Rand and Donald hauled in the sail until it was trimmed in as close as it would hold the wind, the boat laying over until her gunwale was under water. Holding her up in the wind until the peaks shivered, the colonel kept her on that course until she had run some hundred feet beyond the other boat.""He's an old fox and not easily to be caught,"" decided the colonel, when this maneuver had been repeated two or three times. ""He is making for the other shore, and if he gets in among the shallows over there I am afraid we will lose him yet.""""There is a sand-bar there, I think,"" replied the colonel. ""If you pull up the centerboard, perhaps we can slide over it. It's no use,"" he added a moment later as the boat fell off, ""we shall have to go round.""By this time the small boat had been pulled in close to the shore, where the man, picking up a package from the bottom of the boat, sprang over the side and, followed by the boys, ran up the shore and disappeared in the woods, leaving the boat to drift.Picking up the drifting boat the Scout was headed down the river and in a few minutes they were off the colonel's landing. Here, the boys would have taken their boat and rowed home, but the colonel insisted on carrying them down to Creston, which was quickly done in the bracing breeze.""It must have been that way,"" agreed Jack, ""but where did they get this key? That don't lessen the puzzle. It was a Yale lock, and keys to them are not to be had easily, and they must have had one for the front door, too."""
"By this time they had come to the building in which Judge Taylor had his office, which was on one of the main street corners of the town. A little description of the building is necessary here to make the situation clear. It was an old-fashioned, two-story brick structure, having been erected some years before. At the time of its erection there were no other buildings near it, and there were windows on all four sides. Some time later another building had been put on the adjoining lot, leaving a space of a little more than a foot between the two, thus making the windows on that side practically useless. The wall of the other building upon that side was blank, and it was upon this space that the side windows of the judge's office opened. In the rear was a yard of the width of the building and about twenty feet deep, with a low fence upon the side next to the street.Going in at the front door Jack led the way into the hall, from which a broad flight of stairs ascended to the second story. By the side of the stairs was a narrow passage, through which Jack continued to a small hallway in the rear, in which were two doors, one giving access to the cellar, the other opening on the yard in the rear.""That's what they say,"" responded Jack, ""and I don't believe burglars carry ladders around in their kits. Besides there is an electric light right here, so that a ladder could be seen quite plainly from the street. ""I wonder,"" he mused, looking into the space between the buildings, ""if any one could get up through there.""""Good morning, boys,"" replied the judge. ""Looking for news, as usual, eh, Jack? Well, I am sorry to say there isn't any. We are just as much in the dark as ever. It is beyond my comprehension how any one could get in and out of this place and not leave any signs to show how they did it.""""It beats me,"" chimed in the officer. ""It was a good job, too. Looks as if there were two or three in it, the way they handled the safe,"" pointing to the large, old-fashioned safe, good enough in its day, but not offering much resistance to modern tools, which was standing in the middle of the room.""See there!"" replied Jack, ""this window sill is almost free of dust, while the others have half an inch or so on them. It was rubbed off of this one by some one climbing through; see, there is the print of a hand---""""Wanted to give us something to think about, I guess,"" hazarded the officer. ""Perhaps they wanted to make it look like an inside job. Looks as if there were two or three men and a boy mixed up in it. That's a due, anyway, and I will send word around the country to look out for them.""""Found these between the buildings,"" replied Jack, showing a thin steel wedge and a small steel cold chisel. ""It just happened to strike me that they might have forgotten something, so I took a look around and I found these.""""Some of the tools they used on the safe,"" said the officer, taking them. ""Nice bit of work they are. It wasn't any burglar who made them. Now, if we could find where they were made we might get on the track of these fellows."""
"""See if you can find anything else,"" suggested the judge, but a careful search about the office failed to reveal any more clues, and the boys finally went off to see, as Jack expressed it, what they could pick up on the outside.""Come in again, Jack,"" said the judge when the boys were leaving, ""always glad to see you. You have cleared up part of the mystery, anyhow. You are so much better a detective than we are,"" he added laughingly, ""that I don't know but what we shall have to put the case in your hands.""""What I was going to say,"" went on Pepper, ""was, don't you think--now don't interrupt--that it would be a good idea to have Gerald Moore and Dick Wilson meet with us to have a talk about the Scout business?""""Well, I hardly know,"" responded Jack. ""It just came into my head while the colonel was talking the other day. He's an all-around good fellow, you know, even if he does not have much money. Full of fun, and you can depend upon him every time.""""Ah reckon dat am so,"" drawled Rand, then changing his tone he went on: ""What do you say to having a meeting to-night and talking it over? We can have Gerald and Dick come and make a start if we like.""""Then we will consider that settled,"" concluded Rand, who, as a matter of course, assumed the leadership, as he usually did in most things the boys undertook. ""Wait a minute,"" he went on as they were about to separate when they came to his house, ""I will ask uncle now.""""Forty-six stars representing the forty-six States of the Union, in a blue field in the upper right-hand corner,"" replied Gerald, ""with thirteen alternate stripes of red and white, representing the thirteen original States.""""Well, young gentlemen,"" began the colonel, a few days later, when the six boys met at his house in the woods to be sworn in as tenderfeet, ""I suppose you know the requirements and that you are ail ready?""""Raise your right hands, with the thumb resting on the nail of the little finger, the other three fingers pointing upward. This represents the three promises of the oath. Now, repeat after me: On my honor I promise that I will do my best:""Then if you will make a fire I will go on a hunting expedition and see what game I can secure,"" said the colonel. ""Better get to work, boys, for I won't be long. You will find some meal and salt in the shack, Rand, to make some bread.""The boys fell to work at once, Jack and Don gathering the wood for the fire, while Rand and Pepper mixed the dough for the bread, Dick and Gerald agreeing to do the cleaning up afterwards. By the time the colonel came back the fire was blazing and the bread baking on some stones, which were set up in front of the fire.""Well, we don't want our dinner carried off before our eyes,"" replied the colonel. ""Are you sure that your agile enemy isn't watching us from somewhere and just waiting for it to be done to his taste before making a raid on us?""""Going back to the flag,"" said the colonel, when the boys had returned, ""while we are waiting for the dinner to be done, can any of you tell the history of the flag? Of its origin and how it came into being?""""According to tradition,"" replied the colonel, ""but history doesn't bear it out. The earliest flag to be used by the colonies was the Liberty Flag, which was presented to the Council of Safety of Charleston, by Colonel Moultrie, in September, 1775.""""There was the Pine Tree Flag, with the motto 'An Appeal to Heaven.' This motto was adopted April, 1776, by the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts as the one to be borne as the Flag of the Cruisers of that colony. The first armed vessel commissioned under Washington sailed under this flag. It is thought that this flag was used at the battle of Bunker Hill."""
"""The first Union flag was raised by Washington at Cambridge, January 2, 1776. This flag represented the union of the colonies--not then an established nation--and while this flag, by its stripes, represented the thirteen colonies, the canton was the king's colors.""""On the 14th of June, 1777, Congress adopted the resolution that the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes alternating red and white, and that the Union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation. But I think the dinner must be ready by this time, and I have no doubt you are. You know the Scout motto is, 'Be prepared.'""""Hardly,"" replied the colonel. ""Nothing as plain as that. Remember, we are scouts, and we are going to try and follow the trail they leave. Now, then, hares, off with you. Go any way you choose, and in ten minutes we will take up the trail and see if we can follow it.""Starting off, the boys followed the trail, each one alert to notice any little peculiarity in the foot-prints that would enable them to recognize it again. The trail was readily followed along the road until it turned off into the woods, when they lost it. ""Well done, Pepper!"" cried Rand, as the former, drawing back a stout bow nearly as tall as himself, let fly an arrow that struck in the third circle of the target set up at the opposite end of the green.""Begorrah, Oi don't belave it mesilf,"" replied Gerald, shooting an arrow that struck just on the outer edge of the target. ""Faith, 'twas a narrow escape Oi made, and it's toime Oi was making another,"" starting off on a run as the others made for him.This was some days later than the events recorded in the previous chapters, since which time, Rand had been selected as leader and Don as corporal, while Gerald, from his fun-loving proclivities, had been named the ""Patrol's jester.""They had met upon this occasion for archery practice on the lawn in front of Mr. Scott's residence, where Rand was living. Immediately upon the formation of the Patrol Mr. Scott, who was one of the patrons of the Scout organization, had presented each member with a fine English bow and quiver of arrows, in the proper method of using which they were being instructed by Colonel Snow.They were all dressed in the Scout uniform, which they wore when on Scout duty or out on an expedition, and were not a little proud of the fact that each one had bought his uniform with money earned by himself, the first money that some of them had ever earned. This the boys had done in various ways, each according to his own fancy, such as going errands, selling papers, working in stores and shops, etc. They were also provided with small bugle horns, upon which they had learned to sound various signals and calls.""A rare good shot, Master Locksley,"" said a laughing voice, and Rand turned to meet a frank-faced lad of his own age in the Scout uniform, who wore a first class scout's badge, and who gave the Scout salute as he stepped forward.""I doubt it much,"" returned the newcomer, taking the bow which Rand had offered and stretching it the length of his arm. ""A good bow and worthy of your skill. With your permission I will essay a shot.""""Rather we crave the favor,"" answered Rand, extending his quiver to the stranger, who carefully selecting an arrow, fitted it to the bow. Then drawing the bow back the full length of the arrow he measured the distance with his eye, and, loosing the string, the arrow sped straight to the center of the bull's-eye.""It was but a chance shot that I might not be able to repeat,"" returned the other modestly. ""But I was a member of an archery club in our place and that brings me to my errand here. You are Randolph Peyton, leader of the Uncas Patrol, if I am not mistaken. I was told in the town that I would find you here."""
"""A challenge!"" exclaimed Rand. ""Not for an archery contest, I hope, or we are beaten before we begin. Master Watson, permit me to present Don Graeme, Jack Blake and his brother, Pepper, Dick Wilson, and last, but not least in his own estimation, Gerald Moore.""""The Highpoint Patrol, of the Boy Scouts, hereby challenges the Uncas Patrol to a contest for the Scout championship of the Hudson, to be rowed by crews selected from said patrols, at such time and place as may be hereafter agreed upon.""Well, boys, what do you say?"" asked Rand, when he had finished reading the challenge. ""After the prowess exhibited by their messenger, do you think we dare accept?"" Whereupon there arose a babble of voices in which all sorts of opinions were expressed.Wat would have declined to join in the festivities, but the boys were importunate, and the next half-hour was spent in an interchange of talk, in which the words: Scouts, patrol, tests, boats, were of frequent occurrence, and during which the cake and lemonade vanished as quickly as snowflakes in July, after which the Uncas escorted the messenger for a distance on his way, finally bidding him good-by with three cheers and a flourish on their bugles.The boys were in their club room in the attic of Mr. Scott's house, which had been given over to Rand's use. By one of the windows was the instruments of a wireless station with which Rand and his chums had experimented, and scattered about the room were golf clubs, baseball bats and other implements and apparatus of boyish sports.""It isn't a question of winning or losing,"" went on Rand. ""There would not be any sport in it if we only went in when we thought we would win. We will do our best and if we lose we will cheer our loudest for the winners.""""And the message must be delivered under all circumstances. It contains information of the utmost importance, which must not be allowed to fall into the enemies's hands. I will meet you to-morrow at the great oak to give you your final instructions.""""Bravo, boys, well done!"" commended Mr. Scott, who had been standing in the doorway, unseen by the boys, enjoying the fun. ""If I was only a little younger, there is nothing I would like better than to be an Indian brave with you.""""Shure, 'tis niver too late to have fun, Mister Scott,"" he said. ""We'd be plased to have ye for one of us. We'll make ye prisident an' ye'll find it a hape more fun than bein' the prisident av the bank.""""I don't doubt it,"" replied Mr. Scott laughingly, ""but I'm afraid I am almost too old to keep up the pace you set. But I'll tell you what I am going to do. I am going on an outing some of these days and I am going to invite you all to go along with me.""""Yes,"" answered Mr. Scott; ""they are a political token issued in the time of Van Buren during the controversy over the currency. By the way, I shouldn't be surprised if these were some of the coins that were stolen out of Judge Taylor's office when it was broken into.""The road which he was following ran through the woods along the top of the mountain and was comparatively little traveled, most persons preferring the lower road which, although longer, was not near so rough or hilly."
"Pepper met but few people on the way, and had gone rather more than half the distance when, as he was descending the slope of a small hill, he observed coming down the opposite slope a horse and wagon, about which there was something familiar.Stepping from the road he waited behind a small thicket until the wagon came nearer, when he saw that it was being driven by the man who had been with Monkey when they had taken the boat, and that, following the wagon was a big, ugly-looking, mongrel dog, that was dashing from one side of the road to the other, interspersed with little excursions into the woods.With a deep growl the dog started on the boy's trail. Pepper could hear him crashing his way through the underbrush and ran as fast as he could, looking about him, as he ran, for a stick or a stone with which to defend himself, but could see none, and all the time the dog was coming closer and closer, his growl becoming more and more menacing. It was nearly upon him, and he imagined that he could feel its hot breath and expected every moment to feel the snap of its jaws, when he saw, a little way ahead of him, what looked like a stout black stick lying upon the ground. ""Gee! that's lucky,"" thought Pepper, running to where the stick lay and, stooping to pick it up when, to his astonishment and terror, the supposed stick glided from under his hand and he saw that he had been about to grasp a large-sized snake. Springing to his feet he made a wild jump upward and, as luck would have it, caught at the branch of a tree above his head, and, getting a firm grasp, drew himself up just as the dog, with its teeth snapping, sprang at him.""Crickets!"" said the boy to himself, ""but that was a close shave,"" meantime climbing up into the tree to a more comfortable perch. ""I don't know which of them I like the least. It looks as though there was going to be something doing now.""So intent had been the dog in its pursuit of Pepper that he did not see the snake until he had run onto it as it lay coiled upon the ground when, with a cry of alarm, the dog bounded into the air, clearing the snake by half a dozen feet. Apparently forgetting the quarry which it had been so eagerly pursuing, the dog now turned its attention to the snake, which was the largest that Pepper had ever seen.For a few moments Pepper was too fascinated to move, as he watched the strangest combat that he had ever seen going on beneath him. A combat in which neither of the combatants seemed desirous of assuming the aggressive. Lying in a close coil, with its head rising from the center, its forked tongue darting in and out, and emitting every now and then an angry hiss, the snake, swaying its head from side to side, closely followed in its movements those of the dog, which circled about it barking furiously, and apparently watching for an opportunity to seize it back of the head, but which the snake was too wary to permit.""This beats the circus,"" thought Pepper, after he had watched the fight for a little time, ""but this isn't getting the message to Highpoint. I don't believe I have time to wait for the finale. I wonder how I am going to get out of this. If I drop down there they will be making a show of me. Looks as though I might get over into that next tree. I'll try it, anyhow.""""Looks as if I would have to go back,"" he decided, after he had tried and failed to get a hold on the other tree. But this, he found, was more easily said than done, for when he attempted to turn around he slipped and only his quick clutch of the swaying branch saved him from a tumble.""This is a nice scrape I have got into,"" he thought, when he tried to climb back onto the limb from which he had slipped, but found it impossible. ""I can't get back, and I don't see how I am to go on. I hope it will let me down easy.""""It is over this way,"" declared Rand, leading the way to the right, but, although they stopped from time to time to listen, they did not hear the sound again, nor did they find any trace of their missing comrade. For a half hour or more they continued their search, but in vain, and they were returning to the road when they heard the call again, but so faintly that it was lost almost as soon as heard."
"As nothing better was suggested the boys set out for Highpoint, which they soon reached, and a short hunt enabled them to find Jack Dudley, the leader of the Highpoint Patrol, from whom they learned that Pepper had not been there.""It's very strange,"" said Dudley. ""He may have met with some accident. I will hunt up our patrol and will help you search for him. If you will go back and start from the point where you searched before we will take up the scout from here and keep on until we find him, or we join forces again, unless you have something better to propose.""Walking rapidly along the road the colonel indicated one he thought might be Pepper's track, which the boys followed, with some success, after it had been pointed out until, all at once, the marks indicated that the person had come to a sudden stop and had turned aside.""He isn't here,"" went on the colonel; ""but there has been a disturbance of some kind. There are dog's tracks all around as if the animal had struggled with something, but no footprints. There is the track of a snake, too.""""I wish I knew,"" returned the colonel. ""If there were any birds around here big enough we might suspect that one of them had carried him off, but we will evidently have to await Pepper's own explanation of the enigma."" Then he added after a moment:""That reminds me,"" started Dick, when there was a hiss, a snarl and a flash through the air from the tree, under whose branches they were standing, and an immense wild cat, spitting and clawing, landed on Dick's back.For an instant the boys were so dumfounded by the suddenness of the attack that they all jumped in different directions, but the colonel, with a well-directed blow from the heavy stick he carried, knocked the animal off of Dick, but not before his coat had been torn and Dick himself scratched by its claws.""Look out!"" called Rand, ""give me a chance at it!"" drawing back his bow and letting fly an arrow which pierced the animal's body and knocked it sprawling, when Gerald added a blow from a well-directed stone. With a wild scream the cat bounded into the air and fell motionless to the ground.""Look out, Rand!"" cautioned Dick, creeping back from the bushes into which he had fled as soon as he had gained his feet, as Rand went up to where the cat was lying. ""Take care it don't spring on you!"" For a moment or two Pepper hung at the extremity of the branch to which he was clinging, when all at once there came an ominous cracking and the end broke away, but fortunately it had swung so low toward the ground that he dropped at the foot of the tree, not much the worse for his experience.""My goodness gracious!"" exclaimed Pepper, feeling himself all over to make sure that he was ail there. ""The farther I go the worse it gets. This is certainly the worst yet. I think the ground is good enough for me after that.""A little dazed by his fall, Pepper, without stopping to consider his direction, started off as fast as he could go, turning this way and that as he went, to avoid the thicker growths of under-brush, until he had gone a mile or more, getting ail the time deeper into the forest.""I think,"" he mused, when he stopped for a breathing spell, looking about for some clue to guide him, ""I had better be getting back to the road. Now, I wonder which way it is. Let me see, which is the North. That must be it, because this side of the trees have moss on them; then the road must be off this way."""
"Starting off in the direction he had decided upon Pepper pursued his way, swerving now to the right and again to the left to avoid some all but impassable thicket or some swampy bit of ground, until he judged that he had gone at least a mile.""Crickets!"" he exclaimed at length. ""I wonder where that road has gone. I was not that far from it, I know. I must have traveled about four miles since I left it, in the wrong direction at that. Gee! It must be pretty near noon, by the way I feel."" Looking at his watch he saw it was 12 o'clock, and sat down to eat his lunch.""Lucky I brought it along,"" he thought; ""for, from the looks of things, I don't know when I am going to get any more. I wonder if the boys are waiting for me to return? Looks as though they would have quite a wait.Striking off at right angles from the way he had been going he decided to try that course for a while, but after traveling for an hour through the underbrush, which seemed to be getting thicker and more difficult to get through the farther he went, he again came to a halt.Taking a coin from his pocket he closed his hand upon the metal without looking at it. ""if it is head,"" he decided, ""I will go to the right, and if it is tail I will go to the left. It's head,"" opening his hand. ""Now, I'll bet that isn't the right way, but I'll try it anyhow.""""Perhaps I can find some one who can direct me how to get out of this,"" he thought. A few minutes' walk brought him near to a small opening in the woods in which stood a rudely-built cabin, and a little way off a smaller shack which, apparently, was used as a stable, as there was a wagon standing beside it, which Pepper recognized as the one he had seen on the road, and as the very one Monkey had been driving when he nearly run them down. There were a couple of kegs in the wagon and several tin cans. Perched on the roof of the cabin was a boy, whom he recognized as Sam Tompkins, who had, apparently, climbed there to escape the dog, which was jumping up, trying to get at him.""That must be the smoke we saw from the river the other day,"" concluded Pepper. ""I wonder what they are cooking there? I can't say I like the smell of it, whatever it is, and I don't think this is any good place for me, either.""Slipping back as quietly as he had come, Pepper started on his away again. When he had gotten far enough from the place so that, he thought, it would not attract the attention of those there, Pepper sounded a call on his bugle.Hurrying forward he found himself, not, as he had expected, on the road, but on the top of a high bluff which descended almost perpendicularly for a hundred feet to a roadway, which was a welcome sight. Just below him, looking over the edge, he saw that there was a broad ledge about ten feet down and that, below this again, the cliff sloped at an acute angle to another narrow ledge, but below this again there was seemingly nothing but the bare side of the cliff.""Goodness!"" he cried, picking himself up and shaking off the dirt with which he was covered. ""I wonder what next? Now, how am I going to get out of this? I doubt if I can get back up there, and it don't look inviting below."""
"""I wonder if I can catch that tree,"" considered Pepper, preparing to slide down to the ledge. ""I guess it ain't a question of can, I've just got to do it, and I won't be any worse off there than I am here, and I may be a good deal better.""Carefully calculating his distance he let go, sliding down until he reached the ledge where he clutched a tree and held on until he could gain a footing. The ledge, which was about a foot in width, ran but a short distance in either direction, but to the right, a few feet below, was another level space, which Pepper judged he might gain. Moving cautiously along until he was over the point he let himself down to the lower ledge. Following this along he was able to gain another, and so on, slipping at times and tumbling, until he finally came out upon a small plateau at the foot of the hill.""Thank goodness!"" he cried as he got up and shook himself. ""I've got to the bottom, anyhow. I hope there isn't anything more coming my way or I won't get that message there to-day, and I've got to move pretty quick, as it is.""""Tom Brown,"" replied the other, then, with his trumpet, sending out a call that went echoing among the rocks until it brought back an answering call. ""Say, hold on until I get down there,"" he said, addressing Pepper, then clambering down until he stood beside the lost boy. ""Do you know we have been hunting all over for you?""""You certainly did,"" said Jack. ""Lucky we brought along a day's rations. We didn't know how long we might be out. Now,"" as the boys got out their supplies from their knapsacks and spread them out on the rocks, ""tell us how you got here."" Whereupon Pepper related the story of his adventures.So, in spite of Pepper's protests that he was all right and that once put upon the right road he could take care of himself, the boys insisted upon escorting him to the outskirts of Creston, which they reached without further misadventure.Tired, but happy that he had succeeded in delivering the message, Pepper hurried on home. He was almost there when he was accosted by a schoolmate and was told that his brother Jack and others had been seen going into Judge Taylor's office. It was but a step farther, so thither he directed his course.""No,"" replied the colonel, forgetting his anger over the blundering arrest. ""I am at a complete loss how to proceed. If the ground had opened and swallowed him he could not have disappeared more suddenly and more completely.""""We shall certainly have to start another search. The question is where to begin,"" mused the judge, and just then, catching sight of Officer Dugan, his mind reverting to the latter's inexcusable blunder, he gave the chagrined minion of the law a severe reprimand. How far the angry judge might have proceeded is not known, for just at this moment Pepper appeared in the doorway.""Of course not,"" the judge assured him; ""but there were some boys' tracks--now let me go on--and it has been said that these boys were out very early on that morning, and that they have been spending money pretty freely of late, buying uniforms and other things.""""I don't know that they are mine,"" said the judge, ""although they are similar. You had better keep them for the present. So that is the way they went,"" he mused; ""they probably escaped in a boat. I'm afraid there isn't much chance of capturing them. That is all, boys. I just wanted to have a talk with you to straighten things out."""
"""Then they must have been taken by some one around here,"" concluded the judge. ""It seems to me that the farther we go the more mysterious it gets. Jack, I think that you had better set your wits to work and see if you can't clear it up.""""Good night, boys,"" continued the judge. ""You have had rather an exciting day, and I think you had better be getting home. I think you want to look out for Pepper so that nothing more happens to him to-night.""""As weil as c'ud be ixpected av a lot of farmers,"" replied the irrepressible Gerald. ""Ye moight do worse, Oi dunno. Mebbe av ye tho't ye were hoeing potatoes ye c'ud do betther. Can't ye hit up a bit?""The Uncas crew were out for a final spin over the course before the race, which had been set for the following day. Beside the Uncas and the Highpoint, the Alton, from farther up the river, had also entered. It was not thought, even by their friends, that the Uncas had much chance against the others, whose crews, particularly the Alton's, were much heavier and stronger.""What are you trying to do, yourself?"" retorted a man, who was sitting in the stern of the skiff. ""Don't you think anybody has any right on the river but you? Think you own the whole place, don't you?""""He will carry it all his life,"" replied Jack, ""and then some more. Then Monkey doesn't like any of us because he was always behind us in school. He says we got ahead by favor, for we aren't any smarter than he is.""""Monkey said he guessed there'd be a surprise party here in the morning, when you found you didn't have any boat to row with. Sam asked how they could do it, and Monkey said they would go down to the boathouse to-night, after it got dark, and fix it. Sam didn't want to go very much, but Monkey said it was all right, and nobody would know who did it.""""Faith, I think he'll find it a hard nut to crack,"" asserted Gerald, dropping his brogue in his indignation. ""Though there isn't anything surprising about that. I don't think Monkey could surprise us, except by trying to be good.""""I am no sure there is anything to it,"" said Donald. ""And it may be possible we can take care of Monkey and Sam ourselves. In my opinion, it would no be a bad plan to go down to the boathouse and capture them if they come.""""That isn't a bad idea,"" agreed Rand. ""We can slip away, one at a time, so if they see us they won't suspect anything. I will go first and the rest of you can join me later. There isn't any moon to-night, and we can easily find places to hide around the house."""
"Acting upon Rand's suggestion the boys separated, each taking a different course, meeting later at the boathouse. The place was in darkness when Rand, who was the first to arrive, got there. Making a hasty examination by the light of a match he saw that the shell was all right. Keeping in the dark, he waited until the others, slipping up like so many shadows, had come.""We will just give them a chance to get inside,"" went on Rand, detailing his plans. ""I think it will be better if we each hide in a different place. Pepper can go over there behind those bushes and watch the road. Don can watch the door, and I will go on the other side and look out for the window.""""Like Paul Revere, 'one if by land, and two if by sea,'"" quoted Rand. ""If you hear them coming down the road, Pepper, you can give the whip-poor-will call, and Gerald, if he hears anything, can give the owl call.""The night was warm and pleasant. No sound, except the soft lapping of the waves on the shore, the chirp of a cricket or the occasional croak of a tree frog, disturbed the quiet of the night. As the time wore on, without any disturbance, the watches began to doze until Gerald was suddenly roused with a start by a splash in the water and saw a boat gliding silently toward the landing.While talking Monkey had opened the window and started to crawl into the house. ""If you're afraid to come in,"" he said scornfully to the other, ""stay outside and keep watch. It won't take me more than a minute to crack this shell.""As the whistle sounded Monkey sprang back through the window, landing in a heap almost at Rand's feet, but was up and off before Rand could get a hold on him, and sped after his companion, who had started off at the first alarm, in a race down the landing to their boat.Donald, at the alarm, rushed toward the window, and, tripping over a coil of rope, stumbled against a stack of oars, sending them down with a crash that could be heard a mile. Picking himself up, he ran after Rand down the landing.""Why, Gerald was out here on the landing, and now we can't find him. I don't know what has become of him, or if he is just hiding for fun,"" explained Rand; ""though I don't see where he could hide here,"" he added.""Sure of that?"" questioned the colonel. ""Let's take another look around."" Lighting a lantern from the boathouse they made a thorough search of the place without finding anything of their missing comrade.""He's all right!"" came the reassuring cry from Donald a little later. ""I have got him,"" and shortly afterwards reappeared paddling a boat in which was the bewildered Gerald, who was helped onto the landing by the colonel and the others.""It looks that way,"" replied Gerald. ""But when Rand called to me to stop them I ran out to try and head them off, but something gave me a rap on the head and the next thing I knew I found myself lying in that boat. Say, I feel as if I had a head like a pumpkin."""
"""That is going altogether too far,"" asserted the colonel indignantly. ""It might have had a very serious ending. I think that there is a bad quarter-of-an-hour in store for that Rae boy if I can get hold of him in the morning.""As there was no likelihood that Monkey Rae would return to renew his attempt to injure the boat the house was locked and the boys went back to the town discussing, as they went, the events of the evening. The colonel was very indignant.""Three hundred dollars reward. Escaped from jail. Three hundred dollars will be paid for the arrest and detention of one James Rae, alias 'Limpy,' who escaped from the jail at Melton on June fifth. Said Rae is about forty years old, stoutly built, and five feet eight inches in height. Has smooth face, red hair, and walks with a limp. James Robinson, Sheriff.""""Of course you don't,"" said Jack. ""You want it explained with a diagram. It was Rae who robbed Judge Taylor's office, and Monkey and Sam Tompkins helped him. He was hiding in the woods when we saw him.""""Why, they stole them out of the judge's office and lost them where Rand and Pepper found them. I've been studying this thing out ever since the night we were in the judge's office. You see, there was suspicion of some of us and I wanted to clear it off. It's all as clear as day now.""""Why, the robbery was done by Rae and some of his pals,"" explained Jack. ""They sent Monkey up between the buildings and he opened the window and got in and then opened the doors for the others. When they got through all they had to do was to walk out, and Monkey closed and fastened the doors after them and went down the same way as he got in.""""By putting two and two together,"" replied Jack. ""I knew that the coins you found were like some that had been stolen. Monkey Rae and Sam went over the road just before you found them. They had not been lying there long, or they would have been covered up in the dirt, or some one else would have found them.""""Then some of the tools they used had been taken from Wilson's blacksmith shop, and you know Dick said that Monkey and Sam used to come in there almost every day, so that it was quite probable that they took them; that's number two.""""Well, there isn't much more; but I saw, from this circular, that Rae had escaped from prison, so I concluded that the man we saw in the boat was Rae, and I put the two and two together and worked it out that it was he who robbed the judge's office.""""No,"" admitted Jack; ""but I have given the officer the tip, and told him about the shack in the woods where Pepper saw Rae. They are going to make a raid on it tomorrow, and perhaps they will find some of the stolen property in their possession; then we have the impression of a hand on this paper, and we can get one of Monkey's hands and see if they aren't the same."""
