passage
"It happened in Barrel Alley, and it was Tom Slade, as usual, who did it. Picking a barrel-stave out of the mud, he sidled up to Ching Wo's laundry, opened the door, beat the counter with a resounding clamor, called, ""Ching, Ching, Chinaman!"" and by way of a grand climax, hurled the dirty barrel-stave at a pile of spotless starched shirts, banged the door shut and ran.Tom was ""on the hook"" this morning. In one particular (and in only one) Tom was like ""Old John Temple,"" who owned the bank as well as Barrel Alley. Both took one day off a week. ""Old John"" never went down to the bank on Saturdays and Tom never went to school on Mondays. He began his school week on Tuesday; and the truant officer was just about as sure to cast his dreaded net in Barrel Alley on a Monday as old John Temple was sure to visit it on the first of the month--when the rents were due.This first and imminent rock of peril passed, Tom lost no time in offering the opening number of his customary morning program, which was to play some prank on Ching Wo. But Ching Wo, often disturbed, like a true philosopher, and knowing it was Monday, picked out the soiled shirts, piled up the others, threw the muddy stave out and quietly resumed his ironing.Up at the corner Tom emerged around John Temple's big granite bank building into the brighter spectacle of Main Street. Here he paused to adjust the single strand of suspender which he wore. The other half of this suspender belonged to his father; the two strands had originally formed a single pair and now, in their separate responsibilities, each did duty continuously, since neither Tom nor his father undressed when they went to bed.At the next corner was a coal-box. This he opened and helped himself to several chunks of coal. A little farther on he came to a trolley car standing still. Sidling up behind it, he grabbed the pole-rope, detaching the pulley from the wire.The conductor emerged, shook his fist at the retreating boy and sent a few expletives after him. Tom then let fly one piece of coal after another at the rear platform of the car, keeping a single chunk for future use.For, whenever Tom Slade got into a dispute (which was on an average of a dozen times a day), he invariably picked up a stone. Not that he expected always to throw it, though he often did, but because it illustrated his attitude of suspicion and menace toward the world in general, and toward other boys in particular.So firmly rooted had the habit become that even indoors when his father threatened him (which was likewise on an average of a dozen times a day) he would reach cautiously down behind his legs, as if he expected to find a stone on the kitchen floor conveniently near at hand.First and last, Tom had heard a good deal of unfavorable comment about his fancy for throwing stones. Mrs. Bennett, the settlement worker, had informed him that throwing stones was despicable, which went in one ear and out the other, because Tom did not know what ""despicable"" meant. The priest had told him that it was both wicked and cowardly; while the police had gone straight to the heart of the matter by threatening to lock him up for it.And yet, you know, it was not until Tom met young Mr. Ellsworth, scoutmaster, that he heard something on the subject which stuck in his mind. On this day of Tom's wild exploits, as he moved along a little further down the street he came to the fence which enclosed John Temple's vacant lot. It was covered with gaudy posters and with his remaining piece of coal he proceeded to embellish these.Tom paused (in the middle of a most unwholesome sentence) and saw a young gentleman, perhaps twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, looking pleasantly at him. He was extremely well-dressed in a natty blue serge suit, and to Tom his appearance was little less than gorgeous."
"Now this was great news to Tom. He knew he was no gentleman; Mrs. Bennett had told him that. He knew he was a hoodlum; the trolley conductors had told him that. He knew that he was lazy and shiftless and unkempt and a number of other things, for the world at large had made no bones of telling him so; but never, never for one moment had he supposed that he was no sport. He had always believed that to hit a person with a stone and ""get away with it"" represented the very top-notch of fun, and sporting proficiency.""Well, a dirty hand isn't as bad as a filthy word; besides, I'm rooting in the dirt with my hands all summer, anyway,"" said the young man, as he marked out Tom's handiwork. ""There,"" he added, handing back the coal, ""that's not so bad now; guess neither one of us is much of an artist, hey? See that scratch?"" he went on, exhibiting his hand to Tom. ""I got that shinning up a tree. Come on, let's beat it; first thing you know a cop will be here.""Tom hardly knew what to think of this strange, sumptuously-attired creature whose hands were rooting in the dirt all summer, and who got a scratch (which he proudly exhibited) from shinning up a tree; who said ""beat it"" when he meant ""go away,"" and who called a policeman a ""cop.""Tom rather liked the way this strange man talked, though it was not without a tinge of suspicion that he accompanied him along the street, casting furtive glances at his luxurious attire, wondering how such as he could climb a tree.They walked on silently for a little way; an ill-assorted pair they must have seemed to a passer-by, the boy hitching up his suspender as often as it slid from his shoulder in his shuffling effort to keep up with the alert stride of his companion.""Trouble with stone-throwing is that there isn't any skill in it. You know what Buck Edwards said, don't you? He said he'd have learned to pitch much easier if it hadn't been for throwing stones when he was a kid. He used to be a regular fiend at it, and when he came to passing curves he couldn't make his first finger behave. You think Buck can beat that pitcher the Prep. boys have got?""Tom was seized with a strange desire to strengthen his companion's side of the case. The poor boy had few enough arguments, goodness knows, in defense of his own habits, and his information was meagre enough. Yet the one little thing which he seemed to remember about the other side of stone-throwing he now contributed willingly.""Well, I don't know; I don't think there's so much in that, though there may be. I landed a guy one in the temple with a stick last summer--accident, of course, and I thought it would kill him, but it didn't.""Tom watched him as he ascended the steps of a neighboring porch. He had a strange fascination for the boy, and it was not till the door closed behind him that Tom's steady gaze was averted. Then he shuffled off down the street.Something was wrong, that was sure. Tom sniffed again. Something had undoubtedly happened. The old familiar odor which had dwelt in the Slade apartment all winter, the stuffy smell of bed clothes and dirty matting, of kerosene and smoke and fried potatoes and salt-fish and empty beer bottles, had given place to something new. Tom sniffed again."
"The stove-lifter which had been used to pry it up lay on the sill, and the spring air, gracious and democratic, was pouring in amid the squalor just as it was pouring in through the wide-swung cathedral windows of John Temple's home up in Grantley Square.Tom took his usual strategic position on the opposite side of the table, and as his father moved ominously around it, kept the full width of it between them. When he reached a point nearest the sink he grabbed a dented pail therefrom and darted out and down the stairs.Up near Grantley Square was a fence which bore the sign, ""Post No Bills."" How this had managed to escape Tom hitherto was a mystery, but he now altered it, according to the classic hoodlum formula, so that it read, ""Post No Bills,"" and headed up through the square for Barney Galloway's saloon. Bill Slade had been reduced to long-distance intercourse in the matter of saloons for he had exhausted his credit in all the places near Barrel Alley.In the spacious garden of John Temple's home a girl of twelve or thirteen years was bouncing a ball. This was Mary Temple, and what business ""old"" John Temple had with such a pretty and graceful little daughter, I am not qualified to explain.Meanwhile, the bad turn which he had done had begun to sprout and by the time he reached home it had grown and spread to such proportions that Jack's beanstalk was a mere shrub compared with it. Nothing was farther from John Temple's thoughts that beautiful Saturday than to pay a visit to Barrel Alley. On the contrary, he was just putting on his new spring hat to go out to the Country Club for a turn at golf, when Mary came in crying that Tom Slade had stolen her ball.Temple cared nothing about the ball, nor a great deal about Mary's tears, but the mention of Tom Slade reminded him that the first of the month was close at hand and that he had intended to ""warn"" Bill Slade with the usual threat of eviction. Bill had never paid the rent in full after the second month of his residence in Barrel Alley. When he was working and Temple happened to come along at a propitious moment, Bill would give him two dollars or five dollars, as the case might be, but as to how the account actually stood he had not the slightest idea.If Tom had not sent Mary Temple into the house crying her father would never have thought to go through Barrel Alley on his way out to the Country Club, but as it was, when Tom turned into the Alley from Main Street, he saw Mr. Temple's big limousine car standing in front of his own door.If there was one thing in this world more than another dear to the heart of Tom Slade, it was a limousine car. Even an Italian organgrinder did not offer the mischievous possibilities of a limousine. He had a regular formula for the treatment of limousines which was as sure of success as a ""cure all.""Placing his pail inside the doorway, he approached the chauffeur with a suspiciously friendly air which boded mischief. After a strategic word or two of cordiality, he grasped the siren horn, tooted it frantically, pulled the timer aroundr opened one of the doors, jumped in and out of the opposite door, leaving both open, and retreated as far as the corner, calling, ""Yah-h-h-h-h!""Tom placed his pail on the lower step of the stair leading up to the floor above his own, but did not enter the room whence emanated the stern voice of John Temple and the lying excuses of his father. He went down and out on the door step and sat on the railing, gazing at the chauffeur with an exasperating look of triumph.""Well, that's just what you are,"" said John Temple, ""and if certain people of this town spent less for canvas uniforms to put on their boys to make tramps out of them, we should be able, perhaps, to build an addition to the jail.""That night, when Tom Slade, all unaware of the tragedy which threatened his young life, shuffled into Billy's garage, he announced to his followers a plan which showed his master mind as leader of the gang. ""Hey,"" said he, ""I heard Sissy Bennett's mother say she's goin' ter have a s'prise party fer him Friday night, 'n' d'yer know wot I'm goin' ter do?""None of them could beat it, for it was an inspiration. To turn away Master Connover's young guests by this simple but effectual device was worthy of the leadership qualities of Tom Slade. Having thus advertised the possibilities of the signs he took occasion to announce,On Wednesday afternoon three men came down Barrel Alley armed with a paper for Bill Slade. It was full of ""whereases"" and ""now, therefores"" and other things which Bill did not comprehend, but he understood well enough the meaning of their errand."
"One man would have been enough, goodness knows, to do the job in hand, for there were only six or seven pieces of furniture. They got in each other's way a good deal and spat tobacco juice, while poor helpless, inefficient Bill Slade stood by watching them.""Can't you see wot they're a-doin'?"" roared his father. ""'Tain't them that's doin' it neither, it's _you--you done it!!_ It's _you_ took the roof from over my head, you and old John Temple!"" Advancing menacingly, he poured forth a torrent of abuse at his wretched son.""'Twas _you_ done it, Bill Slade, and not him, and don't you lay yer hand on him--mind that! 'Twas you an' your whiskey bottle done it, you lazy loafer, an' the street is well rid o' you. Don't you raise your hand agin me, Bill Slade--I'm not afraid o' the likes o' you. I tell you 'twas _you_ sent the poor boy's mother to her grave--you and your whiskey bottle!""Just then one of the men emerged bearing in one arm the portrait of the late Mrs. Slade and in the other hand Bill Slade's battered but trusty beer can. The portrait he laid face up on the table and set the can on it.Perhaps it is expecting too much to assume that a city marshal would have any sense of the fitness of things, but it was an unfortunate moment to make such a mistake. As Mrs. O'Connor lifted the pail a dirty ring remained on the face of the portrait.While the other marshals pulled Tom off his half-conscious victim, the younger contingent came down the street escorting a sauntering blue-coat, who swung his club leisurely and seemed quite master of the situation.In Court, the next morning, the judge ruled out all reference to the disfigurement of Mrs. Slade's portrait as being ""incompetent and irrelevant,"" and when the ""assault and battery"" could not be made to seem ""an act done in self-defense and by reason of the imminent peril of the accused,"" Tom was taken to the ""jug"" to spend the balance of the day and to ponder on the discovery that a ""guy"" has no right to ""slam"" a marshal just because he sets a dirty beer can on his mother's picture.His first enterprise after his liberation was a flank move on Schmitt's Grocery where he stole a couple of apples and a banana, which latter he ate going along the street. These were his only luncheon. The banana skin he threw on the pave-ment.In a few moments he heard footsteps behind him and, turning, saw a small boy coming along dangling the peel he had dropped. The boy was a jaunty little fellow, wearing a natty spring suit. It was, in fact, ""Pee-wee"" Harris, Tenderfoot, who was just starting out to cover Provision 5 of the Second Class Scout requirements, for he was going to be a Second Class Scout before camping-time, or know the reason why.""So long,"" said Pee-wee, and went gaily on, walking a little, then running a little, then walk-ing again, until Tom thought he must be crazy. Happening just at that minute to finish one of his apples (or rather one of Schmitt's apples) he let fly the core straight for the back of Pee-wee's head.Tom had always supposed that the back of a person's head was a safe target, and he could not comprehend the instinct which was so alert and highly-tuned that it could work entirely independent of the eyes. But this was merely one of Pee-wee's specialties, and his amazing progress from Tenderfoot to Star Scout is a story all by itself.The gum-drops and chocolate bars which did not find their way into the pockets of the storming host, were strewn about the street, the whistle of the peanut-roaster was broken off and Tom went scooting down the street tooting it vigorously.This affair scattered the gang for the time, and presently Tom and ""Sweet Caporal"" found themselves together. They got an empty bottle from an ash wagon, broke it and distributed the pieces along Broad Street, which they selected as a sort of ""mine area"" for the embarrassment of auto traffic."
"Tom then shuffled into the Public Library, ostensibly to read, but in fact to decorate the books according to his own theories of art, and was ejected because he giggled and scuffed his feet and interfered with the readers.It would not be edifying to follow Tom's shuffling footsteps that afternoon, nor to enumerate the catalogue of unseemly phrase and vicious mischief which filled the balance of the day. He wound up his career of glory by one of the most contemptible things which he had ever done. He went up at dusk and tacked his quarantine sign to the outer gate of the Bennett place.They _were_ all at home and Mrs. Bennett, whom he hated, was busy with preparation and happy anticipations for her unsuspecting son. That the wretched plan did not succeed was due to no preparatory omission on the part of Tom, but because something happened which changed the whole face of things.Tom's visit to the Library reminded him that it was here ""them regiment fellers"" met, and since it was near the Bennett place he decided to loiter thereabout, partly for the ineffable pleasure of beholding the side-tracking of Connover's party, and partly in the hope of seeing Mr. Ellsworth again.So he shuffled around a little before dark and did sentinel duty between the two places. He wanted something to eat very much indeed, and he surmised that such a sympathetic fellow as young Mr. Ellsworth would ""give him the lend of a nickel"" especially if he were tipped off in regard to the coming ball game.Standing outside, Tom heard the uproarious laughter through the basement windows and wondered what it was all about. Strange that fellows could be enjoying themselves so thoroughly who were not up to some kind of mischief.The first group paused on the sidewalk bent on finishing their discussion as to whether ""whipping"" was as good as splicing for two strands of rope. One boy insisted that splicing was the only way if you knew how to do it, but that you had to whittle a splicing needle.Another boy came out and said _he_ could jump the gap without any rope at all; it was only seven feet, and what was the use of a rope anyway? Then someone said that Pee-wee would do it scout pace, and there was a great laugh. The group went on up the street.Two more boys came out and one of them said it was going to rain to-morrow. Tom wondered how he knew. Then three or four of the Ravens appeared and one said it would be a great stunt if they could work that on the Silver Foxes at midnight.Tom didn't know what the Silver Foxes were (he knew there were no foxes in Bridgeboro), and he had no notion what ""that"" meant, but he liked the idea of doing it at midnight. He would like to be mixed up in something which was done at midnight himself.But his trusty pal, Mr. Ellsworth, did not appear. Whether he was absent that evening, Tom never knew. The last ones to emerge from the Library basement, were a couple of boys who were talking about dots and dashes.How these two expected to say good night without seeing each other Tom could not imagine, but he thought it had something to do with ""dot flares""; in any event, it was something very mysterious and was to be done that night. He rather liked the idea of it.The two boys separated, one going up toward Blakeley's Hill and pausing to glance at the quarantine sign on the Bennett house as he passed. Tom was rather surprised that he noticed it since he seemed to be in a hurry, but he followed, resolved to ""slam"" the fellow if he took it down.A little way up the hill the boy suddenly turned and stood waiting for him. Tom was hardly less than amazed at this for he had thought that his pursuit was not known. When they came face to face Tom saw that it was none other than the ""half-baked galook"" Roy Blakeley."
"He wore the full Scout regalia which fitted him to perfection, and upon his left breast Tom could see a ribbon with something bright depending from it, which seemed to be in the shape of a bird. He had a trim figure and stood very straight, and about his neck was a looselyknotted scarf of a silvery gray color, showing quite an expanse of bare throat. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, and on one wrist he wore a leather band.Tom's hulking form was within a few inches' of Blakeley and he thrust forward his lowered head and held his clenched fist conveniently ready at his side, but Roy did not budge. On the contrary, he seemed rather amused. He did not scare worth a cent.""Not fer me; guess again. Nay, nay, my boy, _I_ live in Camp Solitaire, with a ring round it. Anybody steps inside that ring gets his wrist slapped and two demerits. I let the house stay there on account of my mother and father and the cat. Don't you worry, you won't get within two hundred feet of the house. The house and I don't speak.""Tom, half suspicious but wanting a cup of coffee, shuffled along at Roy's side. The scout's offhand manner and rather whimsical way of talking took the wind out of his belligerence, and he allowed himself so far to soften toward this ""rich guy"" as to say,""Well,"" said Roy, ""I haven't slept indoors for two weeks, and I'm not going to for the next six weeks. And the best way to get hunk on a fellow that puts you out of a house is just to sleep outdoors. They can't put you out of there very well. Camp, and you've got the laugh on them!""They walked along in silence, Tom's half-limping sideways gait in strange contrast with his companion's carriage, and soon entered the spacious grounds of the big old-fashioned house which crowned the summit of Blakeley's Hill, one of the show places of the town.""Can you jump that hedge?"" said Roy, as he leaped over it. ""This'll be your first sleep outdoors, won't it? If you wake up all of a sudden and hear a kind of growling don't get scared--it's only the trees.""Near the tent was a small fire place of stones, with a rough bench by it and a chair fashioned from a grocery box. Before the entrance stood two poles and on a rough board across these were painted the words, CAMP SOLITAIRE, as Tom saw by the light of the lantern which Roy held up for a moment.The tent was furnished with a cot, blankets, mosquito-netting, several books on a little shelf, and magazines strewn about with BOYS' LIFE on their covers. On the central upright was a little shelf with a reflector for the lantern, and close to the pole a rickety steamer chair with a cushion or two. The place looked very inviting.""Now this out here,"" said Roy, ""is my signal pedestal. You know Westy Martin, don't you? He's patrol leader, and he and I are trying out the Morse code; you'll see me hand him one to-night. We're trying it by searchlight first, then, later we'll get down to the real fire works. He lives out on the Hillside Road a little way."""
"""Doesn't need to be very high, you see, because you can throw a searchlight way up, but we use it daytimes for flag work. Here's the searchlight,"" Roy added, unwrapping it from a piece of canvas. ""Belongs on the touring car, but I use it. I let my father use it on the car sometimes--if he's good.""Now for the coffee. Sit right down on that parlor chair, but don't lean too far back. Like it strong? No? Right you are. Wait a minute, the lantern's smoking. Never thought what you were up against to-night, did you? You're kidnapped and don't know it. By the time we're through the eats Westy'll be home and we'll say good-night to him.""Can you beat that valley for signalling? Westy's nearly as high up as we are. Now for the fire and then the plum-duff. Don't be afraid of it-you can only die once. Wish I had some raisin pudding, but my mother turned me down on raisins to-day.""In the glare of the glowing fire Roy looked straight at Tom. ""How will that--what good--"" he began; then paused and continued to look curiously at him with the same concentrated gaze with which he would have studied a trail by night. But that was not for long. A light came into his eyes. Hurriedly he took out his watch and looked at it.""Never mind that,"" said Roy. ""I'm glad you told me--I'm going to show you something as sure as you're a foot high! You and I are going to have the time of our lives to-night, and _don't you forget it!_""""Quick, now, hand me the light and look out you don't trip on the wires. If they once get past Westy's house--g-o-o-d-_night!_ Just inside the garage door there you'll see a switch-turn it on. Here, take the lantern. If Westy don't get this right, we'll kill him."""
"Tom, with but the haziest idea of what was to be done, followed directions. It evidently had something to do with the mysterious ""dot flares"" and with his own mean act. These excited nocturnal activities had a certain charm, and if it wasn't mischief Roy was up to it had at least all the attractive qualities of mischief.""That's the Morse Code,"" said he, ""easy as eating ice cream when you once get the hang of it. I know it by heart but I'm going to let you read them to me so as to be sure. Better be sure than be sorry--hey? I hope they don't speed that auto till we get through with them.""""No, they haven't got a car at Westy's and no searchlight. He brings me the message all writ, wrot, wrote out, in the morning. They've got a dandy team there, though. Cracky, I'd rather have a pair of horses than an auto any day, wouldn't you. Now be patient, Conny dear, and we'll see what we can do for you.""""It's a long, long way to Tip--Hillside. Do you s'pose Westy's home yet? Oh yes, sure, he must be. Well, here we go--take the lantern and read off the ones I ask for and get them right or I'll-make you eat another plate of plum-duff! Feeding with intent to kill, hey?""There was a little click as he turned the switch, and then a long straight column of misty light shot up into the darkness, bisecting the heavens. Far over to the west it swung, then far to the east, while Tom watched it, fascinated. Then he heard the click of the switch again and darkness reigned, save for the myriad stars.""That meant, 'Get ready,'"" said Roy. ""We'll give him time to sharpen his pencil. Do you pull much of a stroke with Machelsa, the Indian spirit? She smiles a smile at me once in a while, and if you want her to see you through any kind of a stunt you just rub your cheek with one hand while you pat your forehead with the other; try it.""So, across the intervening valley to Westy's home, the message was sent. The khaki-clad boy, with rolled-up sleeves, whose brown hand held the little porcelain switch, was master of the night and of the distance, and the other watched him admiringly.""Good-night,"" said Roy, and two fanlike swings of the misty column told that it was over. ""If they haven't passed Westy's yet, we win. Shake, Tom,"" he added, gayly, ""You did fine--you're a fiend at it! Wouldn't you rather be here than at Conny's party--honest?"""
"It was just about the time when Roy was showing Tom his camp that a big touring car rolled silently up to the outer gate of the Bennett place. (The house stood well back from the road.) The car was crowded with young people of both sexes, and it was evident from their expressions of surprise and disappointment that they saw the yellow sign on the gate.There were a few moments of debate; some one suggested tooting the horn, but another thought that might disturb the patient; one proposed going to the house door and inquiring, while still another thought it would be wiser not to. Some one said something about 'phoning in the morning; a girl remarked that the last time she saw Connover he had a headache and looked pale, and indeed Connover's general weakness, together with the epidemic which prevailed in Bridgeboro, made the appearance of the sign perfectly plausible.The upshot was that the auto rolled away and turned into the Hillside Turnpike. Scarcely had it gone out of sight when a patch of light flickered across the lawn, the shade was drawn from a window and the figure of Mrs. Bennett appeared peering out anxiously.It meant nothing to them, for there was not a scout in the car. And yet a mile or two farther along the dark road there hung a lantern on an upright stick, directly in their path, and scrawled upon a board below it was the word, ""Stop.""Out of the darkness stepped a figure in a white sweater (for the night was growing cold) and a large-brimmed brown felt hat. One of his arms was braced akimbo on his hip, the other hand he laid on the wind shield of the throbbing auto.The sign was gone from the Bennetts' gate when the car returned, and the two boys standing in the shadow across the way, saw the party go up the drive and disappear into the house; there was still plenty of time for the festive program.They kept it up at Bennetts' till long after midnight. They played ""Think of a Number,"" and ""Button, button, who's got the button?"" and wore tissue-paper caps which came out of tinselled snappers, and had ice cream and lady-fingers and macaroons and chicken salad.""Isn't it much better, dearie,"" she said, seating herself for a moment on the edge of the bed, ""to find your pleasure right here than to be tramping over the country and building bonfires, and getting your clothing all filled with smoke from smudge signals, or whatever they call them, and catching your death of cold playing with searchlights, like that Blakeley boy up on the hill? It's just a foolish, senseless piece of business, taking a boy's thoughts away from home, and no good can ever come of it.""What did Tom Slade do after the best night's sleep he ever had? He went to Mrs. O'Connor's, where he knew he was welcome, and washed his face and hands. More than that, he attended to his lessons in school that day, to the teacher's astonishment. And why? Because he knew it was right? Not much! But because he was anxious not to be kept in that afternoon for he wanted to go down and peek through the fence of Temple's lot, to see if there were any more wonders performed; to try to get a squint at Mr. Ellsworth and Westy.In short, Tom Slade had the Scout bug; he could not escape it now. He had thrown it off once before, but that was a milder dose. As luck would have it, that very afternoon he had an amusing sidelight on the scouting business which gave him his first knowledge of the ""good turn"" idea, and a fresh glimpse of the character of Roy Blakeley.When any sort of game or contest is going on it is absolutely necessary to the boy beholder that he pick some favorite whom he hopes to see win, and Tom lost no time in singling Roy out as the object of his preference.It was not a bad choice. As Roy stood sideways to the target, his feet firmly planted, one bared brown arm extended horizontally and holding the gracefully curving bow, and the other, bent but still horizontal, holding the arrow in the straining cord, he made an attractive picture."
"""Come over here, Westy,"" shouted Roy, ""I want Tom Slade to see your freck--well, I'll be--if this one hasn't shifted way over to the other side. Westy's our chart of the heavens. This is the fellow that helped send you the message last night, Westy. He ate two plates of plum-duff and he lives to tell the tale.""This precipitated a wrestling match and Tom Slade witnessed the slow but sure triumph of science, as one after another the last speaker's arms, legs, back, neck and finally his head, yielded to the invincible process of Roy's patient efforts until the victim lay prone upon the grass.""If you let him get away with the championship,"" said another boy, indicating the scoutmaster, ""he'll have such a swelled head he won't speak to us for a month. Come ahead down and make a stab at it, just for a stunt. You couldn't do worse than Blakeley.""""A little more sideways, my boy,"" said Mr. Ellsworth; ""turn this foot out a little; bend your fingers like this, see? Ah, that's it. Now pull it right back to your shoulder--one--two--three--"" The arrow shot past the target, a full three yards shy of it, past the Ravens' patrol flag planted near by, and just grazed the portly form of Mr. John Temple, who came cat-a-cornered across the field from the gate.The scoutmaster flushed slightly. ""No, that is quite foreign to our program, Mr. Temple. Some weeks ago, happening to meet your secretary I asked him whether we might use this field for practice since it is in a central and convenient part of town, and he told me he believed there would be no objection. Perhaps I should have--""""We will talk right here, and there'll be very little talking indeed. If you think I am a public target, sir, you are quite mistaken! You clear out of this lot and keep out of it, or you'll go to jail--the whole pack of you! A man is known by the company he keeps. If you choose to cast your lot with children--and hoodlums and rowdies--I could send that boy to jail if I wanted to,"" he broke off. ""_You know_ he's a vicious character and yet you--""""I'm afraid it would be hard to say at present just what he is, Mr. Temple. I was thinking just a few minutes ago, as I saw him dangling his legs up there, that he was on the fence in more ways than one. I suppose we can push him down on either side we choose.""""He has always been on the wrong side of the fence hitherto, Mr. Temple."" Mr. Ellsworth held out his hand and instinctively Tom shuffled toward him and allowed the scoutmaster's arm to encircle his shoulder. Roy Blakeley elbowed his way among the others as if it were appropriate that he should be at Tom's side.""I have no wish to interfere with this 'movement' or whatever you call it,"" said John Temple, sarcastically, ""provided you keep off my property. If you don't do that I'll put the thumb-screws on and see what the law can do, and break up your 'movement' into the bargain!"""
"""The law is helpless, Mr. Temple,"" said Mr. Ellsworth. ""Oh, it has failed utterly. I wish I could make you see that. As for breaking up the movement,"" he continued in quite a different tone, ""that is all sheer bluster, if you'll allow me to say so.""""As long as there are woods and fields. But I see there is no room for discussion. We will not trespass again, sir; Mr. Blakeley's hill is ours for the asking. But you might as well try to bully the sun as to talk about breaking up this movement, Mr. John Temple. It is like a dog barking at a train of cars.""The boys had the last word in this affair and it was blazoned forth with a commanding emphasis which shamed ""old John's"" most wrathful utterance. It was Roy Blakeley's idea, and it was exactly like him.When a carpenter arrived on the scene the next morning to put up such a sign, as per instructions, he went back and told John Temple that there was a very good one there already, and asked what was the use of another.During the next few days a dreadful document appeared which had to do with Tom, though he never saw it and only heard of it indirectly. Whence it emanated and what became of it he never knew, but he knew it was originated by the ""rich guys"" and that Mrs. Bennett and John Temple and the Probation Officer and the Judge had something to do with it.It said that ""Whereas one Thomas Slade, aged fourteen, son of William Slade, whereabouts unknown, and Annie Slade, deceased, was an unprotected minor, etc., etc., that said Thomas Slade should therefore be brought into court by somebody or other at a certain particular time, for commitment as a city charge,"" and so forth and so on. There was a good deal more to it than this, but this was the part of it which Tom heard of, and he rose in rebellion.He had been sleeping, sometimes at Mrs. O'Connor's and sometimes up at Camp Solitaire with Roy, as the fancy took him. When the news of what was under way fell like a thunderbolt upon him, in a frenzy of apprehension he went to Mr. Ellsworth.Mr. Ellsworth himself went to court on the fatal day. The judge asked what facilities the ""Scout movement"" had for handling a boy like Tom Slade and whether they had an ""institution."" He thought Tom might be placed under the supervision of competent people in the Home for Wayward Boys. The Probation Officer said that was just the place for Tom for he had a ""vicious proclivity."" Tom thought presently he would be accused of having stolen that, whatever it was. Happily, though, in the end, he was committed to Mr. Ellsworth's care and he and Tom went forth together.""Now Tom,"" said the Scoutmaster, ""you and I are going to have a little pow-wow--you know what a pow-wow is? Well, then I'll tell you. When the Indians get together to chin about important matters, they call it a pow-wow. They usually hold it sitting around a camp fire, and we'll do that too when we get to Salmon River, for the Indians haven't got anything on us. But we'll have our first pow-wow right now walking along the street. What do you say?"""
"""You heard the judge say you haven't any relations and, in a way, he was right, but he was mistaken, too, for a scout is a brother to every other scout and you've got lots of brothers, thousands of them; or will have when you get to be a scout. And after you get to be a scout, why you'll have a pretty big pack to carry. The question is, can you carry it?""""You'll have to carry the pack for all these brothers of yours. If _you_ make a slip--tell a lie or throw a stone or interfere with Ching Wo--everybody'll say it's the Boy Scouts. Just the same as if Roy Blakeley should send a flash message wrong. The telegraph operator would give us the laugh and say the Scouts didn't know what they were doing. You and I'd get the blame as well as Roy. So you see, Roy's got a pretty big pack to carry, but he manages to stagger along with it.""You may have noticed that the Scouts are great fellows for laughing. If there's any laughing to be done, we're going to be the ones to do it. We don't let anybody else have the laugh. That's our middle name--laughter.""There's one other little thing, and then I'll tell you the main thing I want to say--flash it, as you fellows would say. We have to be careful about talking. Stick your tongue out a little way between your teeth and say them.""""The first thing for you to do is to make a list of all the words you use that begin with 'th' and say them that way. You know we have troop calls and patrol calls and all sorts of calls, and we've got to be able to make them just right--see?""""Now you take that word you use so much--'ye-re.' 'Yes' is better because it's only got three letters and you can flash it quicker. So one of the first things to do is to make the school books work overtime (there's only two or three weeks more) and get all those words just right; _them, those, three_--because if you said 'tree' and meant 'three' it might throw everything endways. We have a lot to do with trees in the summertime, and you want to be able to say'three' just right, for another reason.""There are three parts to the Scout Oath and we don't want to get those three parts mixed with trees. So whenever you're thinking of the oath, say _three_ and whenever you're thinking of going to Salmon River Grove, say tree.""Tom overheard the words, ""fresh air,"" ""Boys' Home,"" ""something to do,"" ""appeal to honor,"" ""sense of responsibility,"" and more or less about woods and country and about a ""boy to-day being a man to-morrow,"" and about ""working with him,"" and other odds and ends which he did not understand.""Tom,"" said Mr. Ellsworth, ""I've been telling Mr. Schmitt about that signal work. (He was wondering what the light was.) And I've told him about your wanting to earn a little money before camping time. He's going to start you in on three dollars and a half a week, school-days after three and all day Saturdays and Saturday nights. He asked me if you could deliver goods and I told him there wasn't a boy in town who could ""deliver the goods"" like you. Remember the pack you've got to carry for the whole troop. If you fall down, you'll queer the troop-Roy Blakeley and all of us."
"""Mr. Schmitt's a busy man and he has no time to think of what you were doing a few days ago, so don't you think about that either. You can't follow a trail looking backward--you have to keep your squinters ahead. Isn't that so, Mr. Schmitt?""""Now, Tom,"" said Mr. Ellsworth, as they left the store, ""my idea is for you to stay at Mrs. O'Connor's, and give her your money every week. Roy says he'd like to have you go up several nights a week and stay at Camp Solitaire, so I think maybe three dollars a week to Mrs. O'Connor will be all right. Then she'll save the other fifty cents for you and by the time we start for Salmon River you'll have enough, or pretty near enough, for a uniform.""For instance, you might go up to Camp Solitaire every other night and eat plum-duff and eggs with Roy. He says they've got chickens enough up there to keep the camp going. He uses so many eggs, one way or another, I should think he'd ashamed to look a hen in the face. And remember about the colors coming down at sunset. Uncle Sam's a regular old maid about such things, you know. And don't forget page--what was it?""""That'll tell you all about the flag. Then I want you to turn to page 28 in the Handbook and study our law. We have our own home-made laws same as everything else, plum-duff and fishing rods--all home-made.""""You'll beat him out at it,"" said the scoutmaster. ""Anyway, he's going to post you about the sign and the salute, and that leaves only the knots. You take a squint at those knots in the Handbook. I can improve on two of them, but I won't tell you how. You've got to get the hang of four of them, and I want you to see if you can't do all this by Sunday afternoon. But remember, Mr. Schmitt comes first.""Mr. Ellsworth blew into Mrs. O'Connor's with the same breezy pleasantry that he had shown Mr. Schmitt, to the great edification and delight of Sadie McCarren. He created quite a sensation in Barrell Alley and Mrs. O'Connor, good woman that she was, fell in with his plan enthusiastically.The next morning Tom was up at six, wrestling with the O'Connor clothes-line, and by half past seven he had mastered the reef-knot and the weaver's knot, which latter he used to fasten two loose ends of the broken line for permanent use, and he wondered whether this by-product of his early morning practice might pass as a ""good turn.""Before he went to school, Mrs. Beaman, a neighbor, came in and said that after long consultation with her husband she had decided to offer three dollars for the Slade possessions, and in the absence of Bill Slade, the estate was settled up in Tom's interest on that basis. So he went forth feeling he and John Temple were alike in at least one thing-they were both capitalists.Mr. Ellsworth was somewhat of a stickler for form and organization, and it was a pleasant scene which took place the following Sunday afternoon under the big elm up at Camp Solitaire. The ceremony of investing a Tenderfoot was always held on a Sunday because he believed it made it more impressive, and whenever possible it was held out of doors.The First Bridgeboro Troop was highly organized and all its ceremonies emphasized the patrol. The two patrols, the Ravens and the Silver Foxes (and later the Elks) participated in the investing ceremony, but it was the affair particularly of the patrol into which the Tenderfoot was to enter, and this idea was worked out in the ceremony."
"Each patrol stood grouped about its flag, and a little apart, near the national colors, stood Mr. Ellsworth and Worry Sage, Troop Scribe, armed with a book and fountain pen. Down near the signal pedestal was Roy's sister, Esther, in company with her mother and one or two servants from the house. Carl, the gardener, was there, too, to watch the ceremony. On my honor I will do my best-- To do my duty to God and my country, and to obey the scout law; To help other people at all times; To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.Mr. Ellsworth stepped forward amid a tense silence and laid his hand on Tom's shoulder. ""I think you have been loyal to your mother already, Tom,"" he said in a low tone, ""as for your father,"" he hesitated; ""yes, I think you must be loyal to him too. There weren't any Boy Scouts when he was a boy, Tom. We must remember that.""And then, ""Are you familiar with the patrol call which is the voice of the silver fox, and with the patrol sign, which is the head of the silver fox, and do you promise to use this call and this sign and no other so that your name may be honorable in all the Troop, and among all troops?""""I saw Walter Harris,"" said she, panting from running and excitement, ""and he told me to tell you that if the Ravens aren't at the station not to wait for them but go right along on the three-thirty and they'll see you later at Salmon River Grove.""Salmon River Grove was about an hour out on the train. Some of the wealthier of the Bridge-boro people had cottages there. The Bennetts had a pretty bungalow in the village and here, in a hammock on the wide veranda, Connover was wont to loll away the idle summer hours in cushioned ease, reading books about boys who dwelt in the heavens above and in the earth beneath and in the waters under the earth. They went down in submarines, these boys, and up in airships, and to the North Pole and the South Pole and the Desert of Sahara. They were all Boy Scouts and it was from these books that Mrs. Bennett gleaned her notions of scouting.It was a dangerous season for Connover, for in the spring his fancy softly turned to thoughts of scouting, but Mrs. Bennett stood guard against these perils with a tennis racquet and a bottle of cod liver oil and a backgammon board and an automatic piano. And so by hook or crook Connover was tided over the dangerous season, and allowed to read the _Dan Dreadnought Series_ as a sort of compromise.But the show place at Salmon River Grove was Five Oaks, the magnificent new estate of John Temple with its palatial rubble-stone residence, its garage and hot-houses and ""No Trespassing"" signs, of which latter he had the finest collection of any man in the state. The latest edition of these did not say ""No Trespassing"" at all, but simply, ""Keep out."" These signs stood about the newly graded lawns seeming to shake their fists at the curious who peered at the great tur-retted structure.Mr. Blakeley, Roy's father, also owned an extensive tract of woods a little way from the village and here the First Bridgeboro Troop was monarch of all it surveyed from the day school closed until almost the day it opened; and here Mr. Ellsworth spent the happy days of a well-earned vacation, going into town occasionally as business demanded.From Salmon River Grove Station the Silver Fox Patrol had to hike it out for about three miles, and when they hit Camp Ellsworth (as the boys insisted upon calling it) there was the Ravens' tent pitched under the trees, and the Ravens' flag flying, and the Ravens' fire crackling away, and the Ravens themselves gathered about it. On a tree was displayed a glaring sign done in charcoal, which read,When Mr. Ellsworth came out from Bridgeboro at seven o'clpck, he declined to be interviewed as to what he might know of this affair. But whatever he knew, it was evident that the whole plan was known in another quarter, for the very next day the ""mail-hiker"" (who was Dorry Benton) brought up from Salmon River Village a post card addressed to Roy, which read,Scout-Pace Pee-wee got possession of this card, made an elaborate birch, bark frame for it, and hung it up in the Ravens' tent, where it remained ostentatiously displayed until the bitter day of reckoning, which came not long after.To Tom Slade the wretched, slum-stained boy whose whole poor program had been to call names and throw stones, the camp routine, the patrol rivalries and reprisals, the hikes, the stunts, the camp-fire yarns, the stalking and tracking, were like the designs in a kaleidoscope.Observant persons noticed how he began to say ""I saw"" instead of ""I seen""; ""those"" instead of ""them,"" and how his speech improved in many other ways. This was largely in the interest of the signalling, about which he had come to be a perfect fiend. It sent him to the dictionary to find out how to spell words which were to be flashed or wigwagged; and from spelling them properly he came to pronounce them properly."
"When he found that it was possible to tell a piece of oak from a piece of ash by smelling it, if the sense of smell were good, why, that was a knock-out blow for cigarettes. He wasn't going to let the Ravens get away with that species of scouting proficiency.Next to signalling work the thing that engrossed Tom's thoughts was tracking, which he was forever practicing and which he now looked to as the one remaining accomplishment which would advance him to the Second Class.More than a month of scout life had passed for him and he was eligible in that particular; he was ready, though a trifle shaky, on the ""first aid"" business; as for signalling, he had but one rival and that was Roy; and he could jog along at scout pace with anyone except Pee-wee. He was prepared to chop his way into the Second Class with knife or hatchet, as per requirements; he could kindle a fire in the open and cook you a passable meal, though he would never be the equal of Roy as a chef.He knew the points of the compass also, and there were but two things about which he was still in doubt. These were the tracking and the financial business. He felt that if he could do a good tracking stunt it might compensate for his lack in cooking proficiency and for his omission in another particular.It was now the ambition of his life to be a Second Class Scout; he thought of it by day and dreamed of it by night, and he wrestled with a dogged persistence with those things in which he was not skillful because they were not in his line.It was in the interest of this ambition that he joined Mr. Ellsworth one morning as the latter was starting out from camp on one of his ""auto confabs,"" as the boys called his strolls, for on these he was wont to formulate new policies and schemes and, as a rule, he went alone.""Yes, sir. I think I can do that tracking stunt in Paragraph Four an' if I do an' make it a good one, I was wondering if--I s'pose--would you--would you think those potatoes I cooked yesterday were all right?""""The rule says it must be in the bank--one dollar anyway. But I don't want to break it. One day I was going to ask Roy to give me five ones for it and then I decided not to. I like one bill better, don't you?""""All right, Tommy. Don't you worry about that. Just keep the bow line knot good and tight and think of potatoes and bandages and if you can make that tracking stunt something special so as to just knock the Commissioner off his feet, I guess it'll land you in the Second Class. One thing has to make up for another, you know. I've got to stand guard because if I didn't you fellows would be all waltzing scout-pace into the Second Class. But don't worry about financial matters--that's what's turning Mr. Temple's hair gray. When I go into town I'll put that five-spot in the bank for you, hey?""""If you wanted a new one they'd give you a new one. Now you hike it back to camp and tell Worry there are to be no leaves of absence to-night on account of camp-fire yarns, and to post a notice. Tell him to make duplicate prints of the chipmunk Eddie stalked and paste one in the Troop Book. I've got a call to make up toward the village.""Tom made him the full salute and started back. That night he dreamed that the ""Be Prepared"" scroll was pinned upon him and that he was a Silver Fox Scout of the Second Class, having passed with much distinction.""Hit the wrong trail. We don't have 'Eureka' Patrols or captains or lieutenants or squads or muskets. This book has got no more to do with real scouting than it has with a Sunday School picnic. I tell you what, Mrs. Bennett, I just came up out of the woods, and I tell you it's a shame that good trees should be cut down to get wood-pulp to make paper on which to print such stuff as this! It's a waste of good trees!"""
"""It's quite out of the question, Mr. Ellsworth. I am willing that he should read about them, but there it must end. We have always done everything for Connover. I have never stinted him in the matter of wholesome pleasure of any kind.""""Here he is under my eye. There is no use arguing the matter. I have no thought but of Connie's welfare and happiness, but I am not willing that he should dress up like Mrs. Blakeley's boy--a perfect _sight_--his clothes _redolent_ of smoke-and play with fire and sleep in a draught.""As Mr. Ellsworth walked back to camp through the silent woods, he was puzzled at the reasoning of the fond mother who thought that _Dan Dreadnought_ was a better companion for her son than Roy Blakeley.On one of their morning rambles, Mrs. Temple and Mary wandered to an unusual distance from home, and as the sun mounted higher Mrs. Temple felt greatly fatigued. Mary looked about for a spot where her mother might sit down and rest, but was startled by a slight sound and ran back just as Mrs. Temple sank fainting against a tree.Greatly frightened, the girl looked wildly around for assistance, but there was no house nor sign of life in sight. Not knowing what to do she ran along the road a little way, calling aloud, when suddenly she heard a sound. Pausing to listen she distinctly heard again what sounded like a bugle call, and turning in the direction from which it seemed to come she ran through the woods until she came, breathless, to the camp of the Bridgeboro Scouts.It happened that the Silver Foxes were that morning practising in first aid, and as soon as Mr. Ellsworth could gather from the frightened girl that her mother was in real need, he rushed ""Doc"" Carson, the first-aid boy, and Roy off to the rescue, instructing the other members of the patrol to follow scout pace.Water was brought and Mrs. Temple quickly revived. Her head had been slightly cut as she fell, and this Carson bandaged skilfully. She was still too weak to walk, however, and the boys improvised a litter in which she was carefully borne back to camp, Mary walking at her side.Perhaps it was not entirely by chance that he had instructed the two patrols to go through their signalling maneuvers at a little distance, so that they should not disturb the invalid, but yet in full view and near enough so that she might follow the course of the proceedings if she cared to. Mary had a thousand questions to ask as to the meaning of the various signals, and the kind scoutmaster answered them all patiently, finally summoning Eddie Ingram to show her about the camp and explain all its mysteries. Then, seeing that Mrs. Temple showed some interest in the maneuvers, the guileful Mr. Ellsworth proceeded to explain their practical value and the good uses to which the scout ""stunts"" were often put, tactfully pointing out the change that had taken place in Tom Slade, who at this moment was bashfully showing Mary how to blow whistle signals on a small bottle.Mrs. Temple, however, showed but a courteous interest, and feeling that her husband would be alarmed at her long absence she called to Mary and insisted upon returning home immediately, despite Mr. Ellsworth's urgent invitation that she stay and share the scouts' luncheon.The Silver Fox patrol was ordered to escort the ladies home, and with this ample bodyguard they returned to Five Oaks, the boys laughingly contesting for the honor of walking with Miss Mary--all save Tom, who lingered somewhat shamefacedly in the rear.As they walked up the gravel path through the spacious lawn, it was evident that something was wrong. One of the servants was in the _portecochere_, wringing her hands, and the stoical Japanese valet stood near her, calm and unsmiling.""Yes'm--he went after you, ma'am--with the runabout. He thought you was lost and he took on so--not knowing which way to go at all--and he sent James the other way to look for you--an' there was burglars--""The story of the afternoon's events was quickly extracted from the excited servant, prompted by Carl and the Jap. Mr. Temple, having grown anxious about the prolonged absence of his wife and daughter, had started out in the runabout in quest of them. The butler had been sent in another direction and shortly thereafter one of the maids had heard footsteps on the floor above. Thinking that Mrs. Temple must have returned, she went upstairs when, to her terror, a frightful-looking man brushed past her and went down the back stairs. She had screamed, and Carl and Kio had both come to her, but a search of the house and grounds had not discovered the burglar. The screen in the pantry window was ripped away, and Kio volunteered the suggestion that the ""honorable burglar gentleman"" had made his exit through it."
"A systematic search of all the rooms by Mrs. Temple and the patrol revealed no loss or evidence of ransacking except that in Mary's room the contents of the top bureau drawer were disheveled and some trinkets and an upset box lay upon the bed.""They took my class pin,"" said Mary, running over the things. ""Oh, isn't that a shame! I don't care what else they took--that's the only thing I care about! Oh, I think they were too mean for anything! It was my class pin!"" She was crying a little.Tom had gone downstairs and around the house to the pantry window. Nothing was farther from his thoughts than John Temple, but in those few minutes upstairs something had been said which recalled to his mind something else which had been said in the same half-doubtful, half-trustful voice, many weeks before. ""_Will you promise to toss it back?_"" And out of the past he heard a rough, sneering voice answer, ""_Sure, didn' I tell yer?_"" The words, ""_If they'd only bring that back_,"" seemed almost to counter-felt that haunting voice out of the past, and they stung Tom Slade like a white-hot coal.The rubber ball, which had been the subject of the half-pleading question, had gone the way of most rubber balls, and the memory of the episode would have gone the way of all such memories in the hoodlum mind, except that something had happened to Tom Slade since then. He was familiar now with Paragraph I, Scout Law, and was presently to show that he had pondered on other paragraphs of that law as well.Outside the pantry window was a nail keg and on this Tom sat down. It was in a jog formed by an angle in the back of the house, and there was not much danger of being seen from any of the rear ground floor windows, for these were all of heavy cathedral glass. The ground beneath them was littered with nails and shavings; a scrap or two of colored glass and some little bars of lead lay strewn about where the men had been working.Presently he heard voices and guessed that his companions were leaving. Then he heard the honk of an auto horn and caught a fleeting glimpse of a gray car rolling up the private way toward the _porte-cochere_. He heard other voices, the excited greetings of Mrs. Temple and Mary, and the sonorous and authoritative tones of John Temple.For a moment he forgot what he had come out here for, as he realized that it would be difficult to leave without being seen. His hatred of John Temple had modified somewhat since he had become a scout, and had now given place to a feeling of awe for the man who could own a place of such magnificence as Five Oaks. Never before had Tom been in such a house. He had supposed that Roy's beautiful home was about the most luxurious abode imaginable. He realized now that he was stranded in this despotic kingdom with ""No Trespassing"" signs all about glaring at him like sentinels.Tom had acquired many of the scout virtues and his progress in the arts (save in one or two which he could not master) had been exceptional. But he had still to acquire that self-confidence and self-possession which are the invariable result of good breeding. He had not felt at home in the house and though his conscience was perfectly clear, he was ill at ease now.These evidences of the power of wealth hit his boyish imagination hard, and for a minute John Temple seemed like a hero. He could despatch a car to Bridgeboro, another to Keensburgh; he could call up every police station in the state and offer rewards which would cause sheriffs and constables to sit up and take notice. He could pay ten thousand dollars for the capture of the man who had stolen that little class pin. John Temple might be an old grouch, but he was a wonderful man!"
"Then he remembered what he had come out here for, and it seemed very silly and futile alongside the approved methods which were being followed within. While he knew the Scout Handbook did not lie, just the same he hesitated to give this deducing and tracking business a practical test. Then, suddenly, there came to his mind the words Mr. Ellsworth was so fond of repeating to the troop, _He who has eyes to see, let him see_.As Tom rose he saw that the fresh paint on the pantry window ledge had been smeared. Then he looked at the ground. Below the window was a long smooth mark on the soil. ""The fellow had jumped from that window,"" said he, ""slid when he touched the groun'."" He stopped, but not to pick up a rock. Then he went down on his hands and knees, with never a thought of those treasured khaki trousers, and while the telephone bell rang and rang again in the house he read the writing which is written all over the vast, open page of nature for those who have eyes and know how to see.He was satisfied that the fugitive's shoe was worn in the sole so that the outer layer, worn thin and flopping loose, had slid onto one of the little malleable leaden bars used in the cathedral-glass windows. This had evidently pushed its way into the tattered sole, bent a little from the impact, and lodged securely. Either the fugitive did not feel it, or did not care to pause and remove it. It made a mark as plain as Tom's patrol sign.He cast one apprehensive look at the open windows of the upper floor and, taking a chance, made a bold dash across the rear lawn, where he thought he could discern footprints in the newly-sprouting grass. Several hundred feet away was the boundary fence and here the correctness of his direction was confirmed by a painty smooch on the top rail where the fugitive had climbed over.Tom leaped across the fence and, as usual, after any vigorous move, he felt instinctively to see if his precious five-dollar bill was safe. He lived in continual dread of losing it. He paused a minute scrutinizing the small crooked marks left by the leaden bar. Then he thought of something which added fresh zest to his thus far successful search. It was provision four of the Second Class Scout tests:""If I do that,"" said he, looking at his dollar watch, ""it'll land me in the Second Class with a rush, and if I should get the pin for her that would knock the Commissioner off his feet, all right. Here's my tracking stunt mapped out for me. I never claimed I could cook. Oh, cracky, here's my chance!""As he turned and cast a last look toward the house someone (a woman, he thought) seemed to be waving her arm from one of the upper casements. He could not make up his mind whether she was beckoning to him or only scrubbing the window. Then he entered the woods where the ground was sparsely covered with pine-needles.He had to stoop and search for the guiding mark and there were places where for thirty or forty feet at a stretch it was not visible, but the tumbled appearance of the pine-needle carpet showed where someone had recently passed. Then the marks took him into a beaten way and he jogged along with hope mounting high.He had tracked for more than twenty-five minutes and a very skillful tracking it had been, entirely independent of its possible result. So far as the tracking requirement was concerned he had fulfilled that in good measure, and the possible danger in connection with it would commend it strongly to the Scout Commissioner. Moreover, the deductive work which preceded the tracking and the chivalrous motive would surely make up for any lack in first aid and cooking. ""One thing has to make up for another,"" he thought, recalling Mr. Ellsworth's words."
"He was breathing hard, partly from a nervous fear as to what he should do if he succeeded in overtaking the robber, and his little celluloid membership booklet with the precious bill in it, flapped against his chest as he hurried on. ""I'll be in the Second Class before Pee-wee,"" he thought.Suddenly he came to a dead stop as he saw a figure sitting against the trunk of a tree a couple of hundred feet away. The tree trunk was between himself and the man and about all he could see was two knees drawn up.Now was the time for discretion. Tom was a husky enough boy; he seemed much larger since he had acquired the scout habit of standing straight, but he was not armed and he felt certain that the stranger was.He retreated behind a tree himself and quietly removed his shoes. The position of the stranger was favorable for a stealthy approach and Tom advanced cautiously. A flask lay beside the man and he was just taking a measure of encouragement in the prospect of the man's being asleep when the drawn-up knees went down with a sudden start and the figure rose spasmodically, reeled slightly and clutched the tree.""Stay--stay where you are,"" said Tom, his voice tense with fear and astonishment, as his father made a step toward him. ""I--I tracked you-stay where you are--I--didn' know who I wuz trackin'--I didn'. Don't you come no nearer. I--I wouldn' do yer no hurt--I wouldn'.""The elder Slade was a pathetic spectacle. He had gone down quite as fast as his son had gone up. He leered at the boy with red and heavy eyes out of a face which had not been shaved in many a day. His cheek bones protruded conspicuously. The coat which at the time of Mrs. Slade's funeral had been black and which Tom remembered as a sort of grayish brown, was now the color of newly rusted iron. His shoe, which had turned traitor to him and whispered the direction of his flight to the trailing scout, was tied with a piece of cord. He was thin, even emaciated, and there was a little twitch in his eye which grotesquely counterfeited a wink, and which jarred Tom strangely. He did not know whether it was his lately-acquired habit of observation which made him notice this or whether it was a new warning from Mother Nature to his father. But Tom was not afraid of a man whose eye twitched like that. He stood as firm as Roy Blakeley had stood that night of his first meeting with him. That is what it means to be a scout for two months.Slade made an exploration of his pockets as if he could not imagine where such a thing could be. Then he looked at Tom as if reconsidering the wisdom of an assault; then off through the woods as if to determine the chance for a quick ""get away.""The same old cramps which had furnished the excuse for many an idle day! Tom knew those cramps too well to be affected by them, but he saw, too, that his father was a spent man; and he thought of what Mr. Ellsworth had said, ""There wasn't any First Bridgeboro Troop when he was a boy, Tom.""""Yer better get away,"" he warned. ""Old John sent automobiles out and telephoned a lot. Don't--don't lose it,"" he added, realizing the large amount of the money. ""If yer tied it 'round yer neck it 'ud be safer."""
"Tom Slade had not the moral courage to crown his splendid triumph by going straightway and giving the pin to Mary Temple. He could not overcome his fear of John Temple and the awe of the palatial residence. You see, he had not the legacy of refined breeding to draw upon. The Scout movement had taken a big contract in the making of Tom Slade, but Mr. Ellsworth (good sport that he was) was never daunted. Tom did not know how to go alone up to the luxurious veranda at Five Oaks, ring the bell, face that stoical Japanese, ask to see the pretty, beautifullydressed girl, and restore her pin to her. He could have done it without revealing the identity of the fugitive, but he did not know how to do it; he would not ask Roy to come to his assistance, and he missed the best fruits of his triumph.It was fortunate for his disturbed and rather sullen state of mind that an unusual diversion was on the boards at camp. The Ravens' tent was quite deserted; Mr. Ellsworth was in his own tent, busily writing, and he called out cordially, ""Hello, Tommy,"" as Tom passed on to the Silver Foxes' tent.""Sit down; you get two slaps on the wrist for being late,"" said he. This was the only reference he or any of them made to Tom's disappearance at Five Oaks. A scout is tactful. ""I don't see any seat,"" Tom said.""The object of the puzzle,"" said Roy, rolling up his sleeves as if he intended to do the puzzle then and there, ""the object of the puzzle is to get inside the Ravens' tent without entering it. Will some gentleman in the audience kindly loan me a high hat and a ten-dollar gold piece? No? Evidently no gentleman in the audience.""""He has announced his policy of strict neutrality,"" said Roy. ""The field is ours! The obnoxious post-card will be ours if you, brave scouts, will do your part! For one month now has that obnoxious post-card hung in the Ravens' tent. For one month has Pee-wee Harris smiled his smile and gone unshaved--I mean unscathed. Shall this go on?""""And it must not be done sneakingly in their absence, but to the soft music of their snoring. The enterprise is beset with many dangers. Those who are not willing to venture (as What-do-you-call-him said when he stormed Fort Something-or-other) may stay behind!""The night for this bold deed had been well chosen. The Ravens had been stalking all day and at camp fire Tom listened wistfully to the account of the day's most notable stunt which was Pee-wee's tracking of a muskrat more than half a mile within the required twenty-five minutes of the Second Class provision.""Pee-wee'll be the first to jump out of the Tenderfoot Class this summer,"" said Mr. Ellsworth, as he poked the crackling fire. ""You Silver Foxes will have to get busy."" He looked pleasantly at Tom. ""Hey, Tommy?"""
"""I was wondering,"" said Roy, as he stretched himself on the ground close to the cheerful blaze, ""if we couldn't work in something special for next Wednesday--it's troop birthday. We'll be two years old.""""No, they're a lot of upstarts,"" said Doc. Carson, the first-aid boy. ""You'd think to hear them talk that they started before National Headquarters did. I remember when this troop was a one-ring circus: just us Ravens, and we had some good times too. I had my first-aid badge before those triple-plated Silver Foxes were born!""""They're an up-to-date patrol, though,"" said Roy. ""The Ravens are passe--like the old Handbook. That kind of patrol was all right when the thing first started; the Silver Foxes are a last year's model.""""Well,"" laughed Mr. Ellsworth, raking up the fire and drawing his grocery-box seat closer, ""maybe the Silver Foxes will be ancient history soon. I'm thinking of a new pack of upstarts for you foxes to make fun of.""Once, twice, thrice had he made a daring assault on the Bennett stronghold and once, twice, thrice had he been gallantly repulsed by the Bennett right wing, which was Mrs. Bennett. He had planted the Bennett veranda with mines in the form of _Boys' Life_ and _Scouting,_ but all to no avail. Yet his hopeful spirit in regard to the visionary Elk Patrol was almost pathetic.The tent of the venerable Raven patrol was pitched under a spreading tree and they retired with their proud and ancient traditions, blissfully unaware of the startling liberty which was to be taken with their historic dignity by those upstart Silver Foxes. Mr. Ellsworth, with a commendable application of his policy of strict neutrality, retired to his own tent to dream of the new patrol.Never in the history of the troop had a Silver Fox trespassed unknown into the ancient privacy of the Ravens, and never had a Raven condescended to enter the Silver Fox stronghold save honorably and by invitation. They knew the Silver Foxes for a sportive crew pervaded by the inventive spirit of Roy Blakeley, but they had no fear of any violation of scout honor and the obnoxious card hung ostentatiously on the central upright of their tent.In the still hour of midnight the enterprising Silver Foxes emerged in spectral silence from their lair and the battle-cry (or rather, whisper) was ""Revenge,"" pronounced by Roy as if it had a dozen rattling R's at the beginning of it. Every boy was keyed to the highest pitch of excitement.The Ravens' tent was a makeshift affair of their own manufacture and when its sides were not up it was more of a pavilion than a tent: the Ravens believed in fresh air. There were two forked uprights and across these was laid the ridgepole. The canvas was spread over this and drawn diagonally toward the ground on either side. There were front and back and sides for stormy weather but they were seldom in requisition.The program, discussed and settled beforehand, was carried out in scout silence, which is about thirty-three and one-third per cent greater than the regular market silence. Tom and Eddie Ingram, being the tallest of the foxes, stationed themselves at either upright, the other members of the patrol lining up along the sides where they loosened the ropes from the pegs. Then Tom and Ed lifted the ridgepole, the scouts along the sides held the canvas high, and the entire patrol moved uniformly and in absolute silence. The tent, intact, was moved from over the sleeping Ravens as the magic carpet of the _Arabian Nights_ was moved. It was a very neat little piece of work and showed with what precision the patrol could act in concert. Thanks partly to their strenuous day of stalking, never a Raven stirred except Doc. Carson, who startled them by turning over."
"In the centre of the Ravens' tent a sapling had been planted, its branches cut away to within several inches of its trunk, so that it made a very passable clothes-tree. This still stood, like a ghostly sentinel, among the slumbering Ravens, laden with their clothes and paraphernalia. The sudden and radical transformation of the scene was quite grotesque and the unsheltered household gods of the Ravens looked ludicrous enough as they lay about in homelike disposition with nothing above them but the stars.Eddie Ingram laid his end of the ridgepole on the ground and stealing cautiously over among the sleeping Ravens, removed the post card from the sapling and put the other card in its place. Then, stealing back to where the others were waiting, he resumed his end of the pole. This was restored to its place in the forked uprights, the ropes were fastened to the pegs along either side and the Silver Foxes bore Esther Blakeley's memento of their own disgrace triumphantly to their stronghold.When the telegraph and the telephone and the speeding autos and the bullying of the hapless village constable failed to reveal any clue to the burglar at Five Oaks, John Temple proceeded to pooh-pooh the whole business and say that there had never been any burglar, but that in all probability the maid had been exploring Mary's trinkets just as Mrs. Temple returned and that the ""frightful-looking man"" whom she had met on the stairs was a myth.It was then that the maid, groping for any straw in her extremity, said that a boy in khaki had darted out from the pantry and across the private rear lawn into the woods beyond while she stood at the window.If she had stuck to the plain truth and not permitted Mr. Temple to beat her down as to the man she actually did see on the stairs, a great deal of suffering might have been saved. But the loss of only one trinket, and that one of small intrinsic value, seemed to lend color to the theory that it was the work of a boy rather than of a professional adult burglar, and the master of Five Oaks, thinking this matter worth inquiring into, called up the constable and laid the thing before him in this new light.Mr. John Temple had no particular grudge against the Boy Scouts. He was a rational, hard-headed business man, decisive and practical and without much imagination. His lack of imagination was, indeed, his main trouble. He was not silly enough and he was extremely too busy to bear any active malice toward an organization having to do with boys, and except when the scouts were mentioned to him he never gave them a thought one way or the other. He was not the archenemy of the movement (as some of the boys themselves thought): he simply had no use for it.So far as the scout idea had been explained to him by the Bridgeboro Local Council (to whom he had granted five minutes of his time) he thought it consisted of a sort of poetical theory and that money put into it was simply thrown away. He believed, and he told the Council so, that ample provision had been made for boys in the form of circuses and movie plays and baseball games for good ones and reformatories and prisons for bad ones, and he referred, as the successful man is so apt to do, to his own poor boyhood and how he had attended to business and done what was right and so on, and so on, and so on.Nor had this king of finance cherished any particular resentment toward the poor creature who had thrown a stone at him. John Temple was a big man and he was not petty, but he was intensely practical, and he had no patience with Mr. Ellsworth's notions for the making of good citizens. He had known two generations of Slades; he had never known any of them to amount to anything, and he believed that the proper place for a hoodlum and a truant and an orphan was in an institution. He paid his taxes for the support of these institutions regularly and he believed they ought to be used for what they were intended for. He thought it was little less than criminal that the son of Bill Slade should be wandering over the face of the earth when he might be legally placed in a dormitory, eating his three meals a day in a white-washed corridor.For Mr. Ellsworth, John Temple had only contempt. He looked down upon him as the man without imagination always looks down upon the man with imagination. Meanwhile the new subtle spirit was working in Tom Slade and the capitalist had neither the time nor the interest to stoop and watch the wonderful transformation which was going on.He was not prompted by any feeling of spite or resentment toward Tom and the scouts when he told the constable about ""young Slade."" He believed that he was acting wisely and even in Tom's best interests, and it was in vain that his young daughter tried to pull him away from the telephone. Mrs. Temple weepingly implored him to remember the hospitality and the courtesy which she and Mary had just enjoyed at the hands of the scouts, but it was of no use. If no one had mentioned Tom he would never have thought of him, but since Mary had mentioned him he believed it was a good time to have Mr. Ellsworth's experiment with Tom looked into before ""all the houses in the neighborhood were robbed."" He did not mean that, of course; it was simply his way of talking."
"It was the second morning after the Silver Foxes' proud recovery of Esther Blakeley's card that a loose-jointed personage from Salmon River Village sauntered into camp, his face screwed up as if he were studying the sun, and surveyed the camp with that frank and leisurely scrutiny which bespeaks the ""Rube."" Concealed beneath his coat he wore a badge which he had fished out of an unused cooky-jar just before starting, and it swelled his rural pride to feel the weight of it on his suspender.The official personage sauntered over, watched by several boys, paused to inspect the wireless apparatus in its little leanto. His inquisitive manner was rather jarring. By the time he reached Mr. Ellsworth's tent a little group had formed about him.So Tom was called. Roy came with him, and all who were in camp at the moment clustered about the scoutmaster's tent. Mr. Ellsworth's manner was one of perfect confidence in Tom and half-amusement at the stranger's relish of his own authority.""Good heavens, man!"" said Mr. Ellsworth, nettled. ""You don't mean to tell me this boy is charged with trespassing! Why, half a dozen of these boys accompanied Mrs. Temple and her daughter home--they were invited into the house."" He looked at the stranger, half angry and half amused. ""Mrs. Temple and her daughter were our guests here. We might as well say _they_ were trespassing!""There was never a moment in the troop's history, not even in that unpleasant scene in John Temple's vacant lot, when the boys so admired their scoutmaster. His absolute confidence in every member of the troop thrilled them with an incentive which no amount of discipline could have inspired. It was plain to see that they felt this--all save Tom, whose face was a puzzle.He stood there among them, his belt pulled unnecessarily tight, after the fashion of the boy who has always worn a suspender, the trim intent of the scout regalia hardly showing to advantage on his rather clumsy form. His puttees were never well adjusted; the khaki jacket (when he wore it) had a perverse way of working up in back. He presented a marked contrast to Roy's natty appearance and to Westy whose uniform fitted him so perfectly that he seemed to have been poured into it as a liquid into a mould. Both boys looked every inch a scout. Yet there was something strangely distinctive about Tom as he stood there. A discerning person might have fancied his uncouthness as part and parcel of a certain rugged quality which could not be expressed in precise attire. There was something ominous in the dogged, sullen look which his countenance wore. He seemed a sort of law unto himself, having a certain resource in himself and seeking now neither advice nor assistance. He was no figure for the cover of the Scout Handbook, yet he had drawn out of it its full measure of strength; he would accept no one's interpretation of it but his own and thus he stood among them and yet apart--as good a scout as ever raised his hand to take the oath.""One o' these youngsters went daown stairs and raound the haouse t' th' pantry 'n' he was seen to go without warrant of law crost Temple's lawn and inter his private woods."" The man had his little spats of legal phraseology, of course, and Mr. Ellsworth could almost have murdered him for his ""without warrant of law.""It would be hard to describe the look in Mr. Ellsworth's eyes as he watched Tom. There was confidence, there was admiration, but withal an almost pathetic look of apprehension and suspense. He studied Tom as a pilot fixes his gaze intently upon a rocky shore. Tom did not look at him."
"""I know what you want,"" he said. ""I didn't know first off, but now I know. You couldn't search me--I wouldn' leave--let you. I could handle a marshal, and I'm stronger now than I was then. But you can't search me; you can't disgrace my patrol by searchin' them--or by searchin' me--'cause I wouldn't lea--let you. _Get away_ from me!"" with such frantic suddenness that they started. ""Don't you try to take it from me! I'm a scout of--I'm a scout--mind! Where's Roy?""""You take it an' give it to Mary Temple and tell her it's tossin' it back--kind of. She'll know what I mean. You know how to go to places like that--but they get me scared. Tell her it's instead of the rubber ball, and that I sent it to her.""It was Pee-wee who glided, scout pace, over to the Silver Foxes' tent. In the unusual situation it never occurred to him that he, a Raven, was entering it uninvited. Esther Blakeley's triumphant post card hung there but he never noticed it. He brought the well-thumbed Handbook with T. S. on it, and it was curious to see that he gave it to Roy instead of to Tom.""That don't make no difference,"" drawled the man. ""I got a right to go anywheres for a fugitive or a suspect. A guardian writ wouldn't be no use to ye in a criminal charge."" And he smiled as if he were perfectly willing to explain the law for the benefit of the uninitiated.Mr. Ellsworth did not respond to the call for supper that evening and Artie, who was cookee for the week, did not go to his tent a second time. The two patrols ate at the long board under a big elm tree; Tom's vacant place was conspicuous, but very little was said about the affair. It was noticeable that the Ravens made no mention of it out of respect to the other patrol.After supper Roy went alone to Mr. Ellsworth's tent. There was a certain freedom of intimacy between these two, partly, no doubt, because Roy's father was on the Local Council. The scoutmaster had no favorites and the close relation between himself and Roy was not generally apparent in the troop. It was simply that Roy indulged in a certain privilege of intercourse which Mr. Ellsworth's cordial relations at the Blakeley home seemed to encourage, and I dare say Roy's own buoyant and charmingly aggressive nature had a good deal to do with it. He also (though in quite another way than Tom) seemed a law unto himself."
"""No, not to-night, Roy. I can't. If that thing is true--if there's no explanation, why, then my whole structure falls down; and John Temple is right."" His voice almost broke. ""Tom is either no scout at all or else----""""Or else he's about the best scout that lives,"" interrupted Roy. ""Will you ever forget how he looked as he stood there? Hanged if I can! I've seen pictures enough of scouts--waving flags and doing good turns and holding staves and looking like trim little soldiers----""""Whenever you see a picture of a scout,"" said Roy, ""it always shows what a scout can do with his hands and feet; he's tracking or signalling or something like that. _There_ was a picture that shows the other side of it. You never see those pictures in the books. Cracky, but I'd like to have gotten a snap-shot of him just as he stood there with his mouth set like the jaws of a trap, his eyes ten miles away and his hand clutching that battered old Handbook.""After the boy had gone, Mr. Ellsworth picked up his own copy of the _Handbook for Boys_, and looked with a wistful smile at the picturesque, natty youngster on the cover, holding the red flags. It always reminded him of Roy.Roy was satisfied that the only hope of learning anything was to visit the scene of Tom's suspicious, or at least unexplained, departure from the Temple house. About this he knew no more than what the constable had said, but he firmly believed that whatever Tom had done and wherever he had gone, it had been for a purpose. He did not believe that Tom had taken the pin, but he felt certain that if he _had_ been tempted to, he (Roy) would have seen him do so. For a scout is not only loyal, he is watchful. His confidence in Tom, no less than his confidence in himself, made him morally certain that his friend was innocent; and Tom's own demeanor at the time of his arrest made him doubly certain.A little before dark, Roy put on his Indian moccasins, took his pocket flashlight and a good stock of matches, and started for Five Oaks. Reaching there, he made sure the veranda was deserted (for which fact he had to thank the chill air) and found it easy to trace Tom's footprints around to the back of the house through the almost bare earth of the new lawn.In the little recess by the pantry window he felt more secure. The play of his flashlight quickly discovered the painty smear on the windowsill and he examined it closely, as Tom had recently done, but Roy's mental alertness saved him time and trouble. Instead of trying to pick out footprints across the back lawn, he hurried across it, ran along to the end of the fence, and then back again, closely watching the upper rail by the aid of his light. Sure enough, there was a faint smootch of paint and by this easy discovery he had saved himself several hundred feet of difficult tracking. Better still, his own suspicions and the servants' original story were confirmed.For a while Roy and his trusty ally, the pocket flashlight, had a pretty rough tussle of it with the secretive floor of pine-needles in the woods beyond the fence; but Tom's own uncertain pauses and turnings and kneelings helped him, and he was thankful that his predecessor had left these signs of his own movements to guide him. For he now felt certain that Tom had passed here in the wake of someone else.It was a long time before he found himself in the beaten path, having covered a distance of perhaps an eighth of a mile where his tracking had been, as he later said himself, like hunting for a pin on a carpet in the dark. He had been on his hands and knees most of the time, shooting his light this way and that, moving the pine-needles carefully away from some fancied indentation, with almost a watchmaker's delicacy of touch. It was not so much tracking as it was the working out of a puzzle, but it brought him at last into the path and then he found something which rendered further tracking unnecessary. This was the flask which had lain beside Tom's father."
"And now Roy, with no human presence to distract him as Tom had had, noticed something lying near the flask which Tom had not seen. This was a little scrap of pasteboard which had evidently been the corner of a ticket, and holding his flashlight to it he examined it carefully. There was the termination of a sentence, ""...ers' Union,"" and the last letters of a name, ""...ade,"" which had been written with ink on a printed line.It meant nothing to him except as the slightest thing means something to a scout, but he began searching diligently for more of the torn fragments of this card. The breeze had been there before him and he had crept on hands and knees many feet in every direction before his search was rewarded by enough of these scattered scraps to enlighten him. But the light which they shed was like a searchlight!Using his membership card for a background and some pine gum to stick the fragments to it, he succeeded in restoring enough of the card to learn that it was a membership card of the Bricklayers' Union belonging to one William Slade.There was nothing about Mr. Temple or his house which awed Roy in the least. He had been reared in a home of wealth and that atmosphere which poor Tom could not overcome his fear of did not trouble Roy at all. He was as much at ease in the presence of his elders as it is possible for a boy to be without disrespect, but he was now to be put to the test.Mr. Temple worked his cigar over to the corner of his mouth, looking at Roy curiously and not without a touch of amusement. What he saw was a trim, sun-browned boy wrestling with a charming little touch of diffidence, trying to decide how to proceed in this matter which was so important to him and so trifling to John Temple, but exhibiting withal the inherent self-possession which bespeaks good breeding. He was half sitting on the coping and half leaning against it, his browned, muscular arms pressing it on either side.Perhaps it was the incongruity of the encounter, or perhaps his recent breakfast and his good cigar, but he said not unpleasantly, ""Lift yourself up there and sit down if you want to. What can I do for you?""""It's about Tom Slade, Mr. Temple. I know you don't like him and haven't much use for any of us scouts, and I was afraid if Mr. Ellsworth came to see you there might be an argument or something like that, but there couldn't be one with me because I'm only a kid and I don't know how to argue. But there's another reason too; I stood for Tom--brought him into the troop--and he's my friend and whatever is done for him _I_ want to do it. I'll tell you what he did--you know, he's changed an awful lot since you knew him. I don't say a fellow would always change so much but _he's_ changed an awful lot. You'd hardly believe what I'm going to tell you if you didn't know about his changing. It was his own father, Mr. Temple, that took Mary's pin--it wasn't Tom. I'm dead sure of it, and I'll tell you how I know.""I think he went out of the room where the rest of us were that day because he was afraid he might see you--ashamed, you know--kind of. I'd have felt the same way if I had thrown stones at you. Well, he went around the house--I don't know just why he did that--but anyway, he found tracks there and he found a paint smudge on the window-ledge where the burglar climbed out. There's another smudge on the fence where the burglar got over. Tom tracked him and found it was his own father and he got the pin from him, but I suppose maybe he was afraid to come and give it to Mary. You know, sometimes a fellow is afraid of a girl--""""And he was afraid of you, too, I suppose, and that's where he fell down, keeping the pin in his pocket. I know it was his father because-here. I'll show you, Mr. Temple. Here's his membership card in a union with his name on it, and this is what I think. He stopped in the woods and tore this up so there wouldn't be anything on him to show his name and that was just when Tom found him. Tom wouldn't tell about it because it's one of our laws that a scout must be loyal. So I want to give this pin to Mary and then I want Tom to go back with me because it's our troop birthday pretty soon--we've been going two years and--"""
"""Come around and show me your smudge and your tracks,"" said Mr. Temple. ""If what you say is true you can go down in the car with me and I'll withdraw the complaint and do what I can to have the matter expedited. You might let me have the pin.""The chauffeur who saw Mr. Temple step into the touring car followed by Roy, carrying the golf sticks, was a little puzzled. He was still more puzzled to hear his master making inquiries about tracking. After they had gone a few hundred yards he was ordered to stop and then he saw Roy run back to the house and return with two more golf sticks which his master had forgotten.If John Temple had had the least recollection of that scene in his own vacant lot in Bridgeboro, he might have recalled the prophetic words of Mr. Ellsworth, ""_by our fruits shall you know us, Mr. Temple_.""Doubtless, he had forgotten that incident. The tracking business, however, interested him; he was by no means convinced, but he was sufficiently persuaded to say the word which would free Tom. Roy's assumption of full responsibility in regard to the golf sticks amused him, and Roy's general behaviour pleased him more than he allowed Roy to know.He had no particular interest in the scouts, but away down in the heart of John Temple was a wish for something which he could not procure with his check-book, and that was a son. A son like Roy would not be half bad. He rather liked the way the boy had sat on the coping and swung his legs.It fell out that on one of those fair August days there came out from Bridgeboro a picnic party of people who were forced to take their nature by the day, and following in the wake of these, as the peanutman follows the circus, there came that trusty rear-guard of all such festive migrations,--Slats Corbett, the ""Two aces"" (Jim and Jakie Mattenburg), two of the three O'Connor boys (the other one had mumps), and, yea, even Sweet Caporal himself.The petrified mud of Bridgeboro was upon their clothes, the dust of it was in the corners of their unwashed eyes. They wore no badges but if they had these should have shown a leaden goat superimposed upon a tomato can, with a tobacco-label ribbon, so suggestive were they of street corners and vacant lots and ash heaps.The picnic was conducted according to the time-honored formula of such festivities. There were lemonade and cold coffee in milk bottles; there were sandwiches in shoe boxes; there were hard-boiled eggs with accompanying salt in little twists of brown paper; there were olives and hat-pins to extract them with, and there were camel's hair shawls to ""spread on the damp ground.""The rear-guard did not participate in the sumptuous feast. ""A life on the ocean wave"" was what they sought, and their investigations of the wooded neighborhood had not gone very far when they made discovery of an object which of all things is dear to the heart of a city boy, and that was a boat.It was pulled up along the river bank near the picnic grounds, and as a matter of fact, belonged to the scouts. It was used by them in crossing the river to make a short-cut to and from Salmon River Village, instead of following the shore to a point opposite the town where there was a bridge.""Findings is keepings"" is the first law of the hoodlum code, and though the O'Connor boys hung back (partly because they had no right to the boat and more because they were afraid of the water), Sweet Caporal, who balked at nothing save a policeman, led the rest of his intrepid band to the boat and presently they were flopping clumsily about in midstream, much to the amusement of the O'Connor boys and several of the picnickers who clustered at the shore.There are few sights more ridiculous than the ignorant handling of a boat. Sweet Caporal wielded an oar, Slats Corbett wrestled with another one, Jakie Mattenburg gallantly manned the helm, invariably pulling the tiller-lines the wrong way, while Jim Mattenburg, with a broken and detached thwart, did his best to counteract every effort of his companions. Amid these conflicting activities the boat made no progress and the ineffectual splashing and the contradictory orders which were shouted by the several members of the gallant crew were greeted with derisive hoots from the shore.Several times an oar slipped its lock and went splashing into the water; once Sweet Caporal himself was capsized by the catching of the unwieldy oar in its lock and tumbled ingloriously backward into the bottom of the boat.So Jakie Mattenburg took a chance with the right rope and whatever good effect that might have had was immediately counteracted by his brother who paddled frantically on the left side with his broken thwart until he lost it in the water.So they pulled together with such a frantic stroke that one of the oarlocks was lifted from its socket and dropped into the water. The sudden dislodgment of the oar precipitated Slats against one of the Mattenburg boys who thereupon announced that he would man the oar instead. While he was taking his place Sweet Caporal continued to pull frantically, the oar sliding back in its lock and the boat going around in a circle."
"Sweet Caporal, holding his oar about two feet from its end so as to lose all its leverage, pulled furiously, the blade only catching the water occasionally, Jim Mattenburg, with no oar-lock at all, improvised one hand into a lock and hauled frantically with the other one, while Jakie Mattenburg bailed the boat, which was now pretty loggy with its weight of water.The sharp crack of a rifle was heard from the woods on the opposite shore from the picnickers; one of the Mattenburg boys was conscious of a quick, short whizzing sound, and then Charlie, the youngest of the O'Connor boys, who was standing close to the shore, slapped his right hand quickly to his left arm, looked about bewildered, then turned suddenly pale and staggered into the arms of one of the picnic party.Advancing stealthily, our young hero raised his rifle and leveled it at the chief of the howling Zulus, who clustered threateningly on the farther shore. The young girl whom they had kidnapped lay bound hand and foot, and Dan Dreadnought clenched his teeth with anger as he heard her cries for help. The poisoned spears of the infuriated Zulus were flying all about him, but they did not cower the brave lad. He was resolved at any cost to rescue that girl.""I am a Boy Scout,"" he called, ""and I can handle a hundred savages if need be."" Then, uttering the cry of the Eureka Patrol, he dashed into the dugout which lay drawn up on the shore, and using the butt end of his rifle for a paddle, he guided his unsteady boat across the raging torrent amid a fusillade of spears and arrows with which the frantic Zulus vainly sought to stay his approach.Connover Bennett laid down the copy of _The Eureka Patrol in South Africa_, by Captain Dauntless, U. S. A., and dragging himself from the hammock, entered the house. He was breathing hard as if he had been running.Quietly, he crept upstairs and into the ""den."" In the corner among his father's fishing-rods and golf sticks stood a rifle. It was forbidden to Connover, but unfortunately _The Eureka Patrol in South Africa_ dealt not with scout honor and made no mention of the Seventh Law, which stipulates that a ""scout shall be obedient."" Nor had Captain Dauntless thought it worth while to mention Law One, which says that a ""scout's honor is to be trusted.""Connover glanced up and down the road from the bay-window to see if by any chance his mother might have forgotten something and was coming back. Reassured in this particular, he took up the rifle and, standing before the large pier-glass, he adopted a heroic attitude of aiming. Then he looked from the window down into the woods through which he could see little glints of the river.It was not glints of Salmon River that he saw, but the ""Deadly Morass River"" of South Africa; the woods were not quiet, fragrant pine woods where the First Bridgeboro Troop of real scouts was encamped, but the deadly morass itself; and he was not Connover Bennett, but _Dan Dreadnought_, and this was the trusty rifle with which he would--He looked again from the bay-window to make sure that his mother was not in sight. Then the creaking of a door startled him and he laid the rifle down. It was queer how every little sound startled him. He unfastened his negligee shirt at the neck and, standing before the pier-glass, arranged it as much like the frontispiece pictures of _Dan Dreadnought_ as possible. There was a curious fluttering feeling in his chest all the while which annoyed him. It did not seem to jibe at all with the heroic program.He went back into the room and opening the drawer of the desk, took out a box of cartridges, extracted several and put them in his pocket. When he replaced the box he forgot which end of the drawer he had taken it from and was in a quandary where to place it. He took up the rifle again, then laid it down and the thud of its butt on the floor startled him. What a lot of noise it seemed to make!It was oily and his hands were oily from it and left an oily stain on the felt covering of the desk. He placed the inkstand over it, and all the while he felt very strange and nervous; trembling almost as he planned his exploit."
"""Not till dinnertime, Master Connover."" He crossed the road, and headed through the woods toward the river. Once in the woods, the spirit of freedom took possession of him and he indulged in the luxury of shooting the gun at nothing at all.Arrested by a flutter in one of the trees, he leveled his gun again and by the luck of a random shot, brought down a robin. The sight of its quivering body and loose-hanging neck as it lay at his feet almost frightened him for he had never killed a red-blooded creature before, and he felt now a sense of heavy guilt. He was afraid to pick the robin up and when he finally did so and saw how wilted and drooping the thing was and how aimlessly the head swung he was seized with a little panic of fear and dropped it suddenly.But it was absolutely necessary that he should carry out his program of encountering the Zulu's. As long as he was not really going to kill anyone it was all right. He was at least going to have the thrill of that experience. Now that he had killed the robin, he found that in actual practice he preferred a sort of modified Dan Dreadnought to the real one; and he could piece out with his imagination the more harrowing features of Captain Dauntless's book.So he pictured a dugout drawn up on the shore of the river which he was approaching; and he pictured a group of howling Zulus on the farther shore. He heard ikes and the splashing of water, and it fitted well with his heroic scheme to imagine these sounds were made by the howling Zulus, though in reality he knew, or thought he knew, that they came from farther up the river near the scouts' camp.On the other side of the river the O'Connor boy was leaning back in the arms of one of a group of people, the boys in the boat were mending their efforts to get to shore; someone said, ""There he is!"" and then all eyes were upon him and Connover Bennett dropped the gun, reeled against a tree and stood staring as he realized that he was nearer to being the real _Dan Dreadnought_ than he had dreamed.It happened that same afternoon that Tom and Roy went up to Salmon River Village to purchase some provisions for camp. The two boys were on their way back from the village and were discussing an interesting discovery which they had made while there. This was a wireless apparatus which the storekeeper had shown them with great pride for he was one of that numerous class of wireless amateurs whose a‰rials may be seen stretching from tree-tops to house-tops these days, and since it was his pleasure to sit into the wee hours of the morning with his head receivers on, eavesdropping on the whole world, the two scouts had agreed to exchange messages with him.""Oh, yes he has; he's got what Doc Carson calls a passive case. Doesn't it beat all how Doc gets onto this medical talk? Did you hear that one he sprang the other night about a 'superficial abrasion'? Cracky, it nearly knocked me over!""""Yes, 'septic's' his star word now. Mr. Temple's case is likely to become acute any time,"" Roy added as he jogged along, jumping from one subject to another according to his fashion. ""You know you can have a thing and not know it. Then something happens, you get a bad cold, for instance, and that brings the whole thing out. That's the way it is with Mr. Temple--he's just beginning to get the bug; he doesn't know it yet. You ought to have heard him buzz me about tracking.They walked along a little while in silence. ""What-what-did Mary say?"" Tom asked. He had asked the question half a dozen times before, but it pleased him to imagine that he had forgotten the answer. Roy understood."
"They had left the road and were jogging scout-pace along the beaten path through the woods which led down to the river. As they neared it, a confusion of sounds and voices greeted their ears and when they presently emerged upon the shore they found a scene of pandemonium.In mid-stream was their own boat, two-thirds full of water, and clinging to it were Tom's erstwhile Bridgeboro friends and a frantic, shrieking creature whose streaming hair was plastered over his face and who was in a perfect panic of fright as every moment the gunwale of the loggy boat gave with his weight and lowered his head into the water.On the farther shore one little group called futilely to the hapless crew, bidding them cling to the gunwale and hold still; sensible enough advice, except that no advice is of any use to a person in peril of drowning. The bedraggled creature in particular would have prevented any such orderly and rational conduct by his terror-stricken clutchings and cries of ""Save me!"" as if he were the only one in trouble. Another little group on the opposite shore was gathered about a figure which Tom and Roy could not see.""Shin up that tree and see if you can get camp with your whistle,"" he ordered to Tom, throwing off his shirt the while. ""Whistle 'Help' by Morse--if they don't answer, try semaphore with your shirt; if that don't get them you'll have to hoof it. Get Doc, whatever you do. Shut up, will you?""' he shouted to the frantic boy who was making all the noise. ""Keep your mouth shut and you'll be all right!""The new _Dan Dreadnought_ was a pitiable figure. The boy whom he had shot sat near him, ashen white, his arm bleeding despite all efforts to stay the flow of blood, and he himself, his voice husky from his futile shrieking, the red mark of Roy's prompt but necessary blow standing out in bold relief on his white face, lay, half dead with fright and shock, and watched those about him as though in a trance. It was a sad and inglorious end to his adventurous career!It took Roy but a few minutes to tear a couple of shawls and a blanket into strips and tying these together he took an end in his mouth and swam out for the boat. Tying it to the painter-ring, he called to the people on shore to pull easily and, himself guiding and holding up the loggy, half-submerged boat, as best he could, it was finally hauled out of deep water and its hapless crew helped ashore.Roy did not know whether it had been done by Morse whistling or by semaphore. Tom had done it, that was enough, and while he scrambled down from the tree and swam across the river Roy rearranged the clumsily made tourniquet which the picnickers had placed about the arm of the wounded boy, and tightened it with the leverage of a stick which successfully stayed the flow of blood.The real scout and the burlesque scout who lay near by presented a striking contrast. All the mock heroics of the _Eureka Patrol_ of Captain Dauntless seemed cheap enough now, even to the frightened Connover as he languidly watched this quiet exhibition of efficiency. Never had he admired _Dan Dreadnought_ as he now admired Roy Blakeley, this cheerful, clean-cut fellow who knew what to do and just how to do it; and the gang, with all their bravado gone, watched him too, feeling strange after the first bath they had had in many a day.""Do you know what I'm going to do with you?"" said Roy, as he leaned over the O'Connor boy and bathed his face. ""I'm going to give you to Mr. Ellsworth for a birthday present; our troop's two years old next week.""It was not many minutes before the welcome sound of voices was heard in the wood and presently a half-dozen scouts appeared with a canvas stretcher. Mr. Ellsworth was with them and by his side was Doc Carson, or ""Highbrow Doc,"" with his neat little first-aid case. Doc was one of the ancient and honorable Ravens who were not unconscious of their dignity, and he had had the first-aid bee from the start.While he was putting an antiseptic dressing on the O'Connor boy's arm (the bullet had gone in and out again through the fleshy part), Roy and Tom heard for the first time the circumstances of the whole affair, as they were related to Mr. Ellsworth."
It seemed that upon the appearance of Connover with his gun he had been forbidden to go away and had obeyed, probably because he was too frightened and helpless to have any will of his own. His pitiable lack of command throughout the whole affair was not the least significant thing in his day's work, and showed how far he was from the real scout trail.The occupants of the boat, spurred by the emergency, had managed to get the frightened Connover aboard and it was in their clumsy progress across the river that one of the gunwales of the already loggy boat had gone under, shipping more water than the craft could carry besides its living occupants.The O'Connor boy needed only prompt and efficient treatment and the only peril he was in was that of blood-poisoning. Doc dressed his wound antiseptically and though he was not unable to walk, they bore him to camp on the stretcher, for his loss of blood had weakened him and the shock had unnerved him.Just as they started Connover broke down completely, clinging pitifully to Mr. Ellsworth and refusing to go home. His fear of arrest on the one hand and his fear of his parents on the other, made him go to pieces entirely now that the first excitement was over. His behaviour formed a ludicrous anti-climax for all the _Dan Dreadnought_ bombast and bravado, and if it was not borne in upon him then how harmful the books were, he at least began to see how ridiculous they were. Indeed, the redoubtable _Dan_ had begun to lose prestige with Connover the moment he had shot that robin.Connover told him the whole story. In his extremity he felt drawn to Mr. Ellsworth though he showed it in a more effeminate way than Tom had shown it, and the readiness with which he made the scoutmaster a refuge rather jarred upon Mr. Ellsworth. Tom, at least, had never gone to pieces like this.The maid at the Bennett bungalow had one good scout quality; she was observant and the fleeting glimpse which she had of Master Connover departing with the rifle was promptly communicated to Mrs. Bennett upon her return.At the appalling picture of her son trudging across the road into the woods with a fire-arm over his shoulder, the good lady all but collapsed. Her first thought was, of course, that he would shoot himself, which seemed likely enough, and her fear for his safety entirely obliterated her amazement at his shameless disobedience. It was the day of Mrs. Bennett's Waterloo.Out she went, and even in her haste and excitement she picked up the _Dan Dreadnought_ volume which sprawled on the veranda, and tossed it into the swinging seat, then hurried across the road and into the woods. The worst thing she had against Captain Dauntless was that he littered her tidy porch.She followed the same beaten path to the river which Connover had followed and when she reached the bank a few belated stragglers of the picnic party were gathering up their belongings on the opposite side. One of them came over for her in the boat and told her briefly of what had happened.As she approached it she noticed, even in her anxiety, wide bands of bright red high up on the tree-trunks at intervals. She learned later that these were to indicate the path as well as might be, for a distance on either side of it so that no arrow or missile of any sort should be shot across it. It was one of several precautions to guard against the breaking of this inviolable rule. The path was sacred territory.Mrs. Bennett was now within the outskirts of the camp and could smell the savory odor of cooking. She passed the tree where the Silver Foxes had spiked a piece of birch-bark with S. F. chalked upon it to indicate that the boys of that patrol were watching the industrious activities of a certain squirrel which patronized that particular tree. Another trunk bore a similar card with R. on it, showing that the Ravens were spying on the private affairs of an oriole which nested above. Little that oriole knew that seven photographs of him were pasted in the Troop Book.At camp a Red Cross flag had been raised above Mr. Ellsworth's own tent and except for the quiet comings and going of the scoutmaster himself and Doc Carson, all was quiet here. Mrs. Bennett had expected to find the camp a scene of commotion.
"""_Good_ evening, Mrs. Bennett,"" said the scoutmaster, in a tone of pleasant surprise. The spider was in his web at last, but he concealed his feeling of elation. ""You are just in time to grace the festive board. We're going to have corn wiggles; did you ever eat a corn wiggle, Mrs. Bennett?""""No, we heard you long before we saw you. I wish now that Connover's sense of hearing were a little more acute. Then he'd have been able to distinguish the locality of a human voice. But there's no use crying over spilled milk.""Mrs. Bennett listened breathlessly while he repeated the story of the afternoon's occurrences. While he was talking a scout approached, removed his hat, saluted Mr. Ellsworth, and handed him a paper. It was a memorandum of the temperature of the river water, an amateur forecast of the weather for the next day, and a ""stunt"" proposition for O. K. The scoutmaster asked one or two questions and dismissed the messenger. Mrs. Bennett was a little surprised to notice that the questions seemed to bear with practical sense and foresight upon the physical welfare of the boys.Doc assented and there was something so eloquently suggestive of efficiency about Doc that, although Mrs. Bennett sniffed audibly, she did not venture to ask what antiseptic had been used. She had supposed that antiseptics of all kinds would be quite unheard of in a camp of boys, and here out in the woods she was being told by a quiet, respectful young fellow in a khaki suit that her favorite antiseptic was ""out of date.""At a little distance from the tent several boys were engaged in the preparation of supper and the setting of the long board under the trees. Others were busy with various forms of house-keeping, or rather camp-keeping, and her domestic instinct prompted her to cast an occasional shrewd look at the systematic and apparently routine work which was going on. What she could not help noticing was the general aspect of orderliness which the camp displayed. Not a paper box nor a tin can was to be seen. She had always associated camping with a sort of rough-and-tumble life and with carelessness in everything pertaining to one's physical welfare. Cleanliness was, to her notion, quite incompatible with life in tents and cooking out of doors.Her casual discovery of the practice of testing the river water at stated intervals was in the nature of a knock-out blow. She felt a little bewildered as she watched the comings and goings of the troop members. She did not altogether like the realization that the water which had never been tested for her own son's bathing was regularly tested for this ""Wild West crew.""A little way from the roaring fire, whence emanated a most savory odor, the gallant representatives of Bridgeboro's East End were watching the preparations for supper. They had proved faithless to the excursionists and Mr. Ellsworth had invited them to dine at camp, supplementing the invitation with an offer to pay their way home by train, they having come gratuitously on a ""freight."" Mr. Ellsworth looked far into the future, but just at that moment Mrs. Bennett was his game.""Here, you see, is one of the patrol tents and over here is the other. We're hoping for still a third. Here's our wireless apparatus. The boys have just discovered that Mr. Berry, the storekeeper over in the village, has an outfit, so they're in high hopes of having a little chat with him. Here, you see, are the drain ditches, so that the camp is free from dampness and stagnant water. We'll be lowering the colors presently. Dorry, my boy, bring the Troop Book over so Mrs. Bennett can see it--and the Troop Album also. Ah, here's Connie now."""
"From among the group about the fire Connover came guiltily forward. Mrs. Bennett put her arm about him although she said nothing and seemed not altogether pleased. The recollection of his disobedience was now beginning to supplant her fear and anxiety. A little group of scouts, all on the alert for service, and anxious to advertise the details and features of their camp life, accompanied the trio about.""Camp is cleared every morning,"" said Mr. Ellsworth, ""and here is our first aid outfit--our special pride,"" he added as they re-entered his own little tent. ""We have better facilities for the care of an injured person than are to be had in the village.""Mrs. Bennett's housewifely instincts would not permit her to give any sign of surrender until she had proof of the cooking. But away down in her mother's heart was an uncomfortable feeling which she could not overcome; a feeling of disappointment and dissatisfaction with her own son. She had too much pride to show it, but Connover felt in some vague way that she was not well pleased. She was a mother of high ideals and she was not undiscerning. Aside from her son's disobedience, which had been a shock to her, what an inglorious afternoon had been his! It seemed that every one about her had done something worthy that afternoon except her own son. There lay his victim, the O'Connor boy, bearing his suffering in silence. She noticed that the boys seemed somehow to make allowance for Connover, and it touched her pride.While the last few touches for this special meal were preparing, she and Mr. Ellsworth wandered a little way out of camp. He spoke kindly, almost indulgently, she thought, but as one who knew his business and was qualified to speak. He had stormed Mrs. Bennett's fortress too many times to mince matters now.They walked along, he swinging a stick whick he had broken from a tree. ""There is no such man as Captain Dauntless, you know. Captains in the army have other work to do than to write stories for boys. Captain Dauntless is a myth.""""It is not as hard as it used to be. Remind me to give you a paper before you go. You see, if Connie had been a scout,--well now, let's begin at the beginning. If he had been a scout he wouldn't have read those books in the first place; they're really not books at all, they're infernal machines. Then if he had been a scout, of course, he wouldn't have disobeyed you; he wouldn't have sneaked off----""""If he had been a scout he wouldn't have killed a robin--but if he _had_ killed a robin, it would have been by skill and not by a silly, dangerous random shot--and he wouldn't have been afraid of the presence of death or the sight of blood. If he had been a scout he could have determined unerringly the locality of sounds and human voices, and Charlie O'Connor wouldn't----""""If he had been a scout he would have known how to swim; there isn't a member of my troop that can't swim. And if he had been a scout he wouldn't have been afraid to go home. Connie has the best home in the world, Mrs. Bennett----"""
"The cheerful call of the bugle told that supper was ready. Through the trees they could see the scouts assembling until each stood at his place at the long board under trees whose foliage had begun to dim in the fading light.Smilingly she started toward them with all the cultured affability of a true guest. She knew how to do this thing, and she was quite at home now. Mr. Ellsworth knew that her manner covered a sense of humiliation, but she carried it off well and so together they came out of the woods into the clearing.Charlie O'Connor came into the troop on the same wave which brought Connover, and East End contingent, though it did not surrender as yet, retired to the sweltering and almost deserted Bridgeboro, and tried to kindle a fire in Temple's lot after the Camp Ellsworth fashion. The effort was not very successful.The next day Jakie Mattenburg, on the strength of talk he had overheard in camp, tried his hand, or rather, his foot, at stalking, and was surprised to find that it was rather more interesting to watch the movements of a sparrow than to throw stones at it.It could hardly be said that this band of seasoned hoodlums made much immediate progress toward scouting, but they remembered their rescue from the river at Roy's hands, and they accorded him thereafter a grudging measure of consideration which, in the fullness of time, blossomed into genuine friendship. They were, in fact, the future Elk Patrol in its chrysalis form; but their career as scouts is part of another story.A few days after the events of the preceding chapter the troop's birthday was celebrated in camp and Connover and Charlie O'Connor submitted themselves to Roy, who tied a pink ribbon about the right arm of each. From Connover's ribbon depended a card reading,The presentations were made at supper and the two tenderfeet were led (with rather sheepish faces) to Mr. Ellsworth at the head of the table and tendered to him in true birthday fashion amid much laughter.Roy made a characteristic speech. ""These two valuable gifts are presented to our beloved scoutmaster with twelve profit-sharing coupons. When you get one hundred of these coupons take them to Temple's lot in Bridgeboro and receive a new scout.""Honorable Charles O'Connor has always had brothers enough, but now he has a few hundred thousand more, so he ought to be satisfied. This priceless gift"" (grabbing Connover by his pink ribbon) ""was very difficult to procure; it is _what you have always wanted_. If it doesn't fit you can exchange it. Honorable Bennover Connett is the only survivor, ladies and gentlemen--the _only survivor_ of the extinct Eureka Patrol! The Eureka Patrol was a part of the only original Cock and Bull Troop of Nowhere-in-Particular. The records of this troop, known as the _Dan Dreadnought Series_, are donated to Camp Ellsworth for fuel in case the kindling wood runs short. Full and implicit directions go with each gift.""They were just raking up the last embers preparatory to turning in when they were startled by the sound of running footsteps, and out of the darkness emerged a dark-cloaked figure with streaming hair and glints of white under the heavy garment which she wore.""I--lost the path,"" she gasped, ""and--and then I saw your--light--and-oh, Mr. Ellsworth--the house--was robbed and James--is shot and-there's another man shot--and it was all planned for they've cut the wires--and we have to get help--a doctor----""It was Mary Temple who gasped this shocking news and then all but collapsed from fear and haste and excitement. An automobile coat had been donned over her nightdress. For a few moments she was utterly unable to give a coherent account of what had happened at Five Oaks. The few minutes during which she had been lost in the woods, together with the appalling events at home, had quite unnerved her and she clung to Mr. Ellsworth, looking affrightedly about her as if she were being pursued.She looked up startled, and in the last dying glow of the fire she saw the stolid face of Tom Slade. It was the first time she had seen him since her mother's mishap and their visit at camp, though she knew from Roy of his tracking feat and recovery of her pin. She knew too of his night in the lock-up, but no knowledge of his father's connection with the affair had come to her."
"In the lean-to Roy lit the lantern and presently the whole troop was divided into two groups; one was getting ready the stretcher and helping Doc Carson, and the other stood about the lean-to watching Tom, who sat on the rickety grocery box before the wireless apparatus. Roy stood anxiously at his shoulder; the others waited, speaking to each other in an undertone occasionally, but never to Tom. By common consent they seemed to leave this thing for him to do, and there was about him a certain detachment from the others which suggested slightly his manner that day when he had been arrested.Boys came and went, Mr. Ellsworth and others departed hastily with Doc, the little group in the lean-to watched and waited while Tom, apparently unconscious of all about him, sat there adjusting his spark gap. Occasionally he spoke in an undertone to Roy, but seemed oblivious of all else.No answer. Then suddenly Tom's hand flew to the sending key, and as the letters of the Morse Code clicked away into the night a slight smile crept over his face. There was no member of the troop who could use the Morse alphabet with such rapidity as Tom, and he often thought (but seldom spoke) of that first message he and Roy had flashed together from the little tower on Blakeley's Hill.She actually stood a little in awe of Tom Slade, of Barrel Alley, who had cheated her and stolen her ball. And Tom Slade, Scout, who was sure of himself and afraid of nothing, was very much in awe of this young girl. And Roy Blakeley, his chum, understood and took the timid, admiring girl into his own charge and so the little party made its way out of the dark woods and across the bridge to Five Oaks.Mary Temple felt very much as Tom had felt the day after his own first essay at signalling. She knew it was a wireless apparatus he had used (she would have asked questions of him if she had dared), and she supposed that he was calling a doctor. She had experienced a thrill of admiration at the quiet, stolid exhibition of skill, and his apparent aloofness had only deepened her admiration into awe. But as Tom himself had felt so long ago, she wanted to see the tangible result of this work which was such a mystery to her.Tom hurried stolidly along with Pee-wee and Charlie O'Connor, with that clumsy gait which he had never entirely overcome, and which, ever so faintly, suggested the old shuffle. Whether there was any foreboding in his mind none of his companions knew for he was never talkative, but in the light of what soon happened, it occurred to them afterward that he had known all along what was before him, that he knew what he should see at Five Oaks, and that, like the good scout, he was _prepared_.On the way Roy gleaned from Mary more of what had taken place. It appeared that Mr. Temple, hearing sounds in the rooms below, had rung for the gardener who, with the chauffeur, had come from the garage and entered a back door, letting themselves in by means of the chauffeur's key. They were just passing through the foyer when three masked men rushed out of the breakfast room. One got away carrying some loot, not, however, before he had shot and seriously wounded James, the chauffeur, who had dropped in the hall with a bullet in his thigh.Neither of Mr. Temple's men recalled what became of the second man more than that he disappeared, they thought, empty-handed. The third had made for an open window and was just climbing out when the gardener shot him and he fell to the ground outside, where he still lay when the scouts arrived.Doc Carson was busy with James, who had been lifted to a couch in the hall, when Mary saw the tangible result of Tom's message in the form of two dazzling acetylene headlights coming under the _porte cochère_, and the doctor stepping briskly into the house.""Oh, Tom,"" she exclaimed, with as much delight as the occasion would permit, and with gratitude in every note of her voice. ""He came, just as you----Oh, where is he?"" she broke off suddenly, as she noticed that Tom was not there.""They'll have to see him--they'll have to know now. You tell the doctor. I got to be loyal. Tell Mr.--Mr. Ellsworth he's got to remember what he said, that there wasn't no First Bridgeboro Troop when he was a boy--you heard him say that."""
"When they brought the doctor around they found him still in that position and had to lift him gently away. The announcement that the wound was not fatal did not seem to move his stolidness in the least.It was not the scout fashion to order a young girl upon an errand, and it was certainly not the scout fashion, nor anyone else's fashion to summon John Temple thus peremptorily. But Tom was a sort of law unto himself and even Mr. Ellsworth did not interfere.The master of Five Oaks came around the house with his daughter clinging to him. And Tom Slade, who had knocked his hat off, stood up and faced him. It was not always easy to get Tom's meaning; he often used pronouns instead of names and his dogged, stolid temperament showed in his phraseology.""He told me when I joined the troop that I had to be loyal, and that's the reason I'm doing it and not because I believe in being a burglar."" The naïveness of this announcement might have seemed ludicrous if Tom's voice had not trembled with earnestness. ""And he said there wasn't no scouts when he was a boy--that's my father there. And that's what _you_ got to remember too. I tracked him before and I got the pin and gave him my five dollars that I'd saved.""""I guess you know about that, and that I didn't bring it to her 'cause I was scared, and I couldn't help him coming here to-night. Only you got to remember there wasn't any troop when he was a boy--you got to remember that. I'd 'a' been a burglar myself, that's sure, only for him"" (indicating Mr. Ellsworth) ""and the troop--and Roy. And he's sick--that's most what's the matter with him and I'd like to have him brought to our camp and have Doc take care of him till he gets well enough so's Mr. Ellsworth can talk to him, 'cause Mr. Ellsworth, he never fails--he's never failed once. But if you won't do that--if you won't leave him--let him--go like that--then you got to remember that there wasn't any troop when he was a boy-'cause I'm rememberin' it--and------""""If you want me to send a wireless for the constable, I'll do it, 'cause I got to do a service--only you got to remember--that's only fair. And I got something else to say while I'm not scared of you-'tain't because I got any reason to be scared of you either--but I'm sorry I threw that stone at you. That was what started _him_ for the bad--when he went away and left me--but it started me for the good anyhow--so that's something.""For a moment no one spoke. Mr. Ellsworth would not spoil the effect of Tom's words by uttering so much as a single word himself. It was John Temple who broke the silence, quieting his daughter who seemed about to break forth again.""I will do more than remember,"" said he. ""Come here, my boy. There will be no charge made against your father, so there will be no need of a service unless it is a service of my own. It has been borne in upon me lately that your good scoutmaster is a wonder-worker, and what you have just said strengthens that growing conviction. I have been thinking, too, how I might further the movement so well represented by him, and the story of your experience with your father has quite decided me. For every one of those five precious dollars that you were sensible enough to save and noble enough to give away, there shall be given a thousand to the cause whose precepts and principles you represent.Tom said nothing. He had never been much of a scout missionary, and the unexpected and altogether amazing conversion of John Temple quite overwhelmed him. He did not realize that he himself had done it, in his own stolid, crude way."
