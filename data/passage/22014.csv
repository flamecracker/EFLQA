passage
"Peter lives upon a mountain Pretty near the sun, Knows the bears and birds and rabbits Nearly every one; Has a home among the alders, Bed of cedar bark, Walks alone beneath the pine trees Even when it's dark. Squirrels tell him everything That happens in the trees, Cricket in the gander-grass Sings of all he sees; Rimes from bats and butterflies, Crabs and waterfowl; But the best of all he gets From his Uncle Owl. Sometimes when its day-time, But mostly in the night, They sit beneath an oak tree And hug each other tight, And tell their rimes and riddles Where the catty creatures prowl-- Funny little Peter Patter And his Uncle Owl._ Our little Pat Was chasing the cat And kicking the kittens about. When mother said ""Quit!"" He ran off to sit On the top of the woodpile and pout; But a sly little grin Soon slid down his chin And let all the sulkiness out. Father and mother and Bobbie will go To see all the sights at the animal show. Where lions and bears Sit on dining room chairs, Where a camel is able To stand on a table, Where monkeys and seals All travel on wheels, And a Zulu baboon Rides a baby balloon. The sooner you're ready, the sooner we'll go. Aboard, all aboard, for the Animal Show! On the road to Tattletown What is this I see? A pig upon a pedestal, A cabbage up a tree, A rabbit cutting capers With a twenty dollar bill-- Now if I don't get to Tattletown Then no one ever will. Where are you going, sister Kate? I'm going to swing on the garden gate, And watch the fairy gypsies dance Their tim-tam-tum on the cabbage-plants-- The great big one with the purple nose, And the tiny tad with the pinky toes. Where are you going, brother Ben? I'm going to build a tiger-pen. I'll get iron and steel and 'lectric wire And build it a hundred feet, or higher, And put ten tigers in it too, And a big wildcat, and--mebbe--you. Where are you going, mother mine? I'm going to sit by the old grapevine, And watch the gliding swallow bring Clay for her nest from the meadow spring-- Clay and straw and a bit of thread To weave it into a baby's bed. Where are you going, grandma dear? I'm going, love, where the skies are clear, And the light winds lift the poppy flowers And gather clouds for the summer showers, Where the old folks and the children play On the warm hillside through the livelong day. A tortoise sat on a slippery limb And played his pinky pang For a dog-fish friend that called on him, And this is what he sang: ""Oh, the skies are blue, And I wait for you To come where the willows hang, And dance all night By the white moonlight To my pinky, pinky, pang!"" Tick, tock! Tick, tock! Forty 'leven by the clock. Tick, tock! Tick, tock! Put your ear to Grandpa's ticker, Like a pancake, only thicker. Tick, tock! Tick, tock! Catch a squirrel in half a minute, Grab a sack and stick him in it. Tick, tock! Tick, tock! Mister Bunny feeds on honey, Tea, and taters--ain't it funny? Tick, tock! Tick, tock! When he goes to bed at night, Shoves his slippers out of sight; That is why Old Fox, the sinner, Had to go without his dinner. Tick, tock! Tick, tock! So says Grandpa's clock."
"Buster's got a popper gun, A reg'lar one that shoots, And Teddy's got an engine With a whistler that toots. But I've got something finer yet-- A pair of rubber boots. Oh, it's boots, boots, boots, A pair of rubber boots! I could walk from here to China In a pair of rubber boots. ""Thank you, dear,"" said the big black ant, ""I'd like to go home with you now, but I can't. I have to hurry and milk my cows-- The aphid herds on the aster boughs."" And the ladybug said: ""No doubt it's fine, This milk you get from your curious kine, But you know quite well it's my belief Your cows are best when turned to beef."" ""Tommy, my son,"" said the old tabby cat, ""Go catch us some mice, and be sure that they're fat. There's one family lives in the carpenter's barn; They've made them a nest of the old lady's yarn. But the carpenter has a young cat of his own That is healthy and proud and almost full grown, And consider it, son, an eternal disgrace To come home at night with a scratch on your face."" The roads are good and the weather's grand, So I'm off to play in the Hobo Band; With a gaspipe flute and a cowhide drum I'm going to make the music come. With a toot, toot, toot, and a dum, dum, dum, Just hear me make the music come! A robin and a wren, as they walked along one night, Saw a big brown beetle on a broomstraw. Said the robin to the wren: ""What a pretty, pretty sight-- That big brown beetle on a broomstraw!"" So they got their plates and knives, Their children and their wives, And gobbled up the beetle on the broomstraw. A silly little mule Sat on a milking stool And tried to write a letter to his father. But he couldn't find the ink, So he said: ""I rather think This writing letters home is too much bother."" A candle, a candle To light me to bed; A pillow, a pillow To tuck up my head. The moon is as sleepy as sleepy can be, The stars are all pointing their fingers at me, And Missus Hop-Robin, way up in her nest, Is rocking her tired little babies to rest. So give me a blanket To tuck up my toes, And a little soft pillow To snuggle my nose. Mister Crane said: ""Hi there, master, Can't you make your legs work faster? We can't poke along this way."" Then he slowly flew away. Loddy held him fast, you bet, And he hasn't come home yet. As I was coming back again In front of Missus Knapp's I saw that awful lady Give about a dozen slaps To every little Knapperine-- I thought it was, perhaps, Because they gathered stickers In their knitted jersey caps. A beetle once sat on a barberry twig, And turned at the crank of a thingum-a-jig. Needles for hornets, nippers for ants, For the bumblebee baby a new pair of pants, For the grizzled old gopher a hat and a wig, The beetle ground out of his thingum-a-jig. Tibbitts and Bibbitts and Solomon Sly Ran off one day with a cucumber pie. Tibbitts was tossed by a Kensington cow, Bibbitts was hanged on a brambleweed bough, And poor little Solomon--what do you think? Was drowned one dark night in a bottle of ink."
"I've got a new book from my Grandfather Hyde. It's skin on the cover and paper inside, And reads about Arabs and horses and slaves, And tells how the Caliph of Bagdad behaves. I'd not take a goat and a dollar beside For the book that I got from my Grandfather Hyde. The mighty baron, Batteroff, Raised a whale in a watering trough. When the whale grew large and fat He ate the baron's brindle cat. But pussy, once inside the whale, Began to tickle with her tail. This the monster could not stand, And spewed her out upon dry land. That night, when all was fine as silk And she had supped her bread and milk, She grinned and told old Batteroff How she got the whale to cough. Oh, I want to go to Garry On the toot-toot, toot-toot, You and I together On the toot-toot, toot-toot. Go run and ask your mother For some kind of cake or other, And a bit of cotton wadding For your ball-suit. Get your bobber and a bat, And be back as quick as scat, For we've got to go to Garry On the toot-toot. Bobbin rode a rocking-horse 'Way down to Doubbledoon, He told his little sister He'd be back that afternoon. But maybe after all she didn't Understand him right, For he wasn't back again Till the middle of the night. And what did little Bobbin see 'Way down at Doubbledoon? He saw a crazy Arab Throwing bubbles at the moon, A monkey making faces And a rabbit in a rage, A parrot shouting ""Murder!"" From the ceiling of his cage. I've got a yellow puppy, And I've got a speckled hen, I've got a lot of little Spotted piggies in a pen. I've got a gun that used to shoot, Another one that squirts, I've got some horehound candy And a pair of woolen shirts. I've got a little rubber ball They use for playing golf, And mamma thinks that's maybe why I've got the whooping-cough. Doctor McSwattle Filled up a bottle With vinegar, varnish, and rum. And offered a swallow To all who would follow The call of his trumpet and drum. It's good, I am told, For a cough or a cold; It's good for a pain in your thumb. Haven't you heard of Terrible Tim! Well, don't you get in the way of him. He eats lions for breakfast And leopards for lunch, And gobbles them down With one terrible crunch. He could mix a whole city All up in a mess, He could drink up a sea Or an ocean, I guess. You'd better be watching for Terrible Tim, And run when you first get your peepers on him. Old Molly is lowing and lowing 'Way down in the old meadow lot. I've given her water and clover, And all of the apples I've got; But she won't eat a thing that I give her, And never drinks even a sup, For they've taken her baby to market And some one has eaten it up. I'd just like to go to the city And cut them all up into halves And feed them to sharks and to lions-- Those people that eat little calves."
"The snowflakes are falling by ones and by twos; There's snow on my jacket, and snow on my shoes; There's snow on the bushes, and snow on the trees-- It's snowing on everything now, if you please. Twenty little snowflakes climbing up a wire. ""Now, listen,"" said their mother, ""don't you climb up any higher. The sun will surely catch you, and scorch you with his fire."" But the naughty little snowflakes didn't mind a word she said, Each tried to clamber faster than his fellow just ahead; They thought that they'd be back in time enough to go to bed. But they found out that their mother wasn't quite the dunce they thought her, The sun bobbed up--remember this, my little son and daughter-- And turned those twenty snowflakes into twenty drops of water. Slippery Slim, a garter snake, Leaned against a garden rake And smiled a sentimental smile At Tilly Toad, on the gravel pile, Till that bashful miss was forced to hop And hide her face in a carrot-top. No one at home in the hen-house, And no one at home in the barn, Old Brindle has gone to the neighbor's To borrow a skein of brown yarn, To borrow yarn for the darning Of socks for her wee spotted calf-- A Canada goose On the South Palouse Is singing her summer song. Her words are wise, And she greets the skies With a voice like a steamer gong: ""If you harbor your wealth And keep your health, You'll always be rich and strong."" Hipperty, clickerty, clackerty, bang, Get in a corner as fast as you can! The sideboard is tipsy, the table is mad, The chairs have lost all the sense that they had. So hipperty, clickerty, clackerty, bang, Get in a corner as fast as you can! A sailor gave his sonny Nearly half a pint of money And told him he should buy a suit of clothes; But he saw a pretty maiden With all kinds of posies laden, And he gave her all his money for a rose. Then the sailor gave his sonny Nearly half a pint of money To buy a little garden and a house; But he found him the next day, In a shop on Yesler Way, A-buying cheese and crackers for a mouse. A stove is a thing that gets awfully hot, And fries up your meat, or whatever you've got. It's made out of iron and hinges and screws, And filled up with shakers, and dampers, and flues. It's not very long and it's not very wide; It's got black'ning on top and ashes inside. Said the Robin to the Squirrel, ""How d' you do?"" Said the Squirrel to the Robin, ""How are you?"" ""Oh, I've got some cherry pies, And a half a dozen flies, And a kettle full of beetles on to stew."" Said the Squirrel to the Robin, ""How d' you do?"" Said the Robin to the Squirrel, ""How are you?"" ""I've a nest that's nice and neat, And a wife that can't be beat, And I'm every bit as happy now as you."" Two funny friends that you all know Are Cella Ree and Tommy To. About as queer as friends can be, Are Tommy To and Cella Ree. For hours they sit there grim and stable Side by side upon the table. Tom is red and Cella pale, His blushes are of no avail; She sits, in spite of his endeavor, As firm and undisturbed as ever, A funny pair, you must agree, This Tommy To and Cella Ree. O the Army of the Queen, The Army of the Queen, Some are dressed in turkey-red And some are dressed in green; A colonel and a captain, A corporal in between, Their guns are filled with powder And their swords are bright and keen; So toot your little trumpet For the Army of the Queen. Blue flames and red flames In a world all dark; Blue flames and red flames, And a tiny spark Hurrying to heaven, lest it should be late; Lest the cautious seraphim close the shining gate, And leave the little wanderer forevermore to fly Like an orphan angel through the endless sky."
"Poor little Timothy Grady Screwed up his face at a lady, And, jiminy jack! It wouldn't come back. The louder he hollered The tighter it grew, His eyes are all red And his lips are all blue. Oh, mercy me, what in the world will he do? Poor little Timothy Grady! Captain Tickle had a nickel In a paper sack, He threw it in the river And he couldn't get it back. Captain Tickle spent his nickel For a rubber ball, And when he cut it open There was nothing there at all. Jelly Jake and Butter Bill One dark night when all was still Pattered down the long, dark stair, And no one saw the guilty pair; Pushed aside the pantry-door And there found everything galore,-- Honey, raisins, orange-peel, Cold chicken aplenty for a meal, Gingerbread enough to fill Two such boys as Jake and Bill. Well, they ate and ate and ate, Gobbled at an awful rate Till I'm sure they soon weighed more Than double what they did before. And then, it's awful, still it's true, The floor gave way and they went thru. Filled so full they couldn't fight. Slowly they sank out of sight. Father, Mother, Cousin Ann, Cook and nurse and furnace man Fished in forty-dozen ways After them, for twenty days; But not a soul has chanced to get A glimpse or glimmer of them yet. And I'm afraid we never will-- Poor Jelly Jake and Butter Bill. A big, fat potato lay down on a clod In the shade of some burdock and tall goldenrod, And he dreamed he were king of the whole garden plot, With a palace and throne, and a crown with a lot Of jewels and diamonds and gold till it shone Like the front of a show when the lights are turned on. He had to be minded by all of the plants; When he whistled the radishes knew they must dance; When he tooted his horn the cucumbers must sing To a vegetable crowd gathered round in a ring. He made all the cabbages stand in a row While a sunflower instructed them just how to grow; The bright yellow pumpkins he painted light blue; Took the clothes off the scare-crow and made him buy new. He strutted and sputtered and thought it was grand To be king and commander o'er all the wide land. But at last he woke up with an awful surprise And found a blind mole kicking sand in his eyes. Old Father Annum on New Year's Day Picked up his bag of months and years, Thrust in his hand in a careless way, And pulled a wee fellow out by the ears. ""There you are,"" said he to the waiting crowd, ""He's as good as any I have in my pack. I never can tell, but I hope to be proud Of the little rascal when I come back."" Here comes a cabbage with a bonnet on its head, A pretty purple bonnet with a bow of blue and red; And here comes a bottle with a collar 'round its neck, A handsome linen collar, too, without a spot or speck; Next comes a meat-saw, his job is biting beef, And according to the cleaver he has gold in all his teeth; And last of all there comes along, amid the ringing cheers, A princely Indian corn-stalk with rings in both his ears. A pipe and a spoon and a tenpenny nail Stole a tin dishpan and went for a sail. But the cook he grew curious, Fussy, and furious; Gathered his trappings, and went on their trail. He found them that night in a pitiful plight, And sent them all home on the ten o'clock mail. Hi! Hi! Who will buy A wee little cloud for the pretty blue sky? Some are purple, some are red, And all are soft as a feather bed. Hi! Little children, won't any one buy One little cloud for the pretty blue sky?"
