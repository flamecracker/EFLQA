""I'm just sure I see that whale of a boat in the dim distance, and I think I see Patty's yellow head sticking over the bow.""It surely was, and though the last quarter hour of waiting seemed longer than all the rest, at last the big ship was in front of them, and swinging around in midstream. They could see the Fairfields clearly now, but not being within hearing distance, they could only express their welcome by frantic wavings of hands, handkerchiefs, and flags. But at last the gangplank was put in place, and at last the Fairfields crossed it, and then an enthusiastic and somewhat incoherent scene of reunion followed.""Nonsense, Ken, it's her clothes. She has a foreign effect, but it will soon wear off in New York. I _am_ glad to see you again, Patty; we didn't think it would be so long when we parted in Paris last Spring.""""No, you needn't,"" said Mr. Fairfield, kindly. ""You and Nan and Mr. Allen jump in a taxicab and go home. I'll keep Patty with me, and any other of the young people who care to stay, and we'll settle matters here in short order.""""That I won't, ma'am,"" was the hearty response, and the hat was laid back in its box as carefully as an infant in its cradle. ""I have ladies in my own family, ma'am, and I know just how you feel about it.""But after a good-natured controversy, Roger won the day, and climbed into the front seat. Mr. Fairfield, Kenneth, and the two girls settled themselves inside, and off they started for the Fairfields' home in Seventy-second street.""Come in? of course we'll come in!"" said Roger, as he assisted them from the cab, and Patty graciously invited him. ""That's what we're here for! We're all coming in, and if we're heartily urged, we may stay to dinner.""Very cosy and attractive the house looked, as, after more than a year's absence, Patty once again stepped inside. It had been closed while Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield were away, but a few days before their return, Mrs. Allen, Nan's mother, had come over from Philadelphia and opened the house and made it cheery and livable. A bright fire glowed in the library, flowers were all about, and holly-wreaths hung in the windows.Patty had done up her pretty hair in the prevailing fashion of the day; but though the soft braids encircled her head, many little golden curls escaped and made a soft outline round her face. Her frock, of pale rose colour, had a collarless lace yoke, and was very becoming.""Oh, I do have to hammer at that all day, and some evenings, too. But it's an unwritten law that a fellow must have some fun; so I'll take an afternoon off now and then, to come round and tease you girls.""As Elise had hinted this to Mrs. Allen while they were at the steamer dock waiting for Patty, the good lady was not greatly surprised. And she knew that Patty would prefer to be in New York with her young friends, rather than in Philadelphia."
"""Wonderful girl!"" commented Roger. ""I thought ladies were always behind time with their Christmas preparations. I thought they always said, 'It doesn't seem _possible_ Christmas is so near!' and things like that.""""Don't pay any attention to him,"" said Elise, ""he's putting on airs. He thinks it's funny to talk like that, but you just ought to see him on Christmas! He simply adores his presents, and fairly gloats over every one!"" The ten days before Christmas flew by like Bandersnatches. Patty had a long list of friends to whom she wanted to give presents, and though she had brought home a lot of what Kenneth called ""foreign junk,"" she had no notion of giving it all away.Of course, the lovely fans, beads, and scarves she brought made lovely gifts for the girls, and the little curios and souvenirs were all right for the boys, but there were so many friends, and her relatives beside, that she soon realised she would have little left for herself. And, though unselfish, she did want to retain some mementos of her foreign trip.""You're a contented little girl, Patty. And that's a noble trait, I admit. But just at Christmas time it's trying. Now, if you only wanted a watch, or a diamond ring, or some trifle like that, I'd be glad to give your father a hint.""""Thank you, stepmamma,"" said Patty, smiling; ""but I have a watch, and I'm too young for diamonds. I can't help it if I'm amply supplied with this world's goods. And think of the lots of gifts I'll get, anyway! Perhaps father'd better just give me the money and let me put it in the bank against a rainy day.""""I know it,"" said Patty, with a little sigh. ""I know we're rich. Not wealthy, like the Farringtons, but plenty rich enough. Only, you often hear of rich men losing their money, and sometimes I think I ought to save up some.""""You dear thing!"" she cried, as she embraced her; ""I was so sorry not to see you when I called. I should have come again, but I'm so rushed with Christmas work, that I can't go anywhere until Christmas is over. Do take off your things and sit down, and don't mind if I go on sewing, will you? I can talk just as well, you know.""""Dressing dolls,"" said Clementine, as she threaded her needle; ""and I've forty-five still to do,--but their underclothing is done, so it's only a matter of frocks, and some hats. Did you have a good time in Europe?"""
"""Why, the babies that the Sunshine Society gives a Christmas to. And there's oceans of babies, and they all want dolls,--I guess the boys must like dolls, too, they want so many. And, oh, Patty, they're the dearest little things,--the babies, I mean,--and I just _love_ to dress dolls for them. I'd rather do it than to make presents for my rich friends.""Suddenly Patty felt a great wave of self-compunction. She had planned and prepared gifts for all her friends, and for most of her relatives, but for the poor she had done nothing! To charity she had given no thought! And at Christmas, when all the world should feel the spirit of good will to men, she had utterly neglected to remember those less fortunate than herself.""I'm a pig!"" said Patty; ""there's no other word for such a horrid thing as I am! Why, Clementine, I've made presents for nearly everybody I know, and I haven't done a thing for charity! Did you ever know such an ungrateful wretch?""""But I've spent all my Christmas money,"" said Patty, contritely. ""Father gives me a liberal allowance, and then extra, for Christmas money. And it's just about all gone, and I hate to ask him for more.""So Patty told many tales of her stay in Paris and in England, and of her pleasure trip through Italy, and as she talked, her fingers flew, and she had soon completed three doll dresses, that were quite as pretty and well-made as Clementine's.""I'm so glad I came here to-day,"" she said, after the welcoming greetings were over, ""for it has roused my charitable instincts. I am quite sure, Mrs. Morse, I can send some toys for your society's tree, if you want them.""""Want them? Indeed we do! Why, Patty, there are forty little boys who want drums or trumpets and we can only give them candy and an orange. It's harder than you'd think to get subscriptions to our funds at Christmas time, and though we've dolls enough, we do so want toys for the boys.""""Why, Patty, dear, how kind of you! I am so glad, for those children were on my mind, and I've already asked every one I know to give to our fund. You are a generous little girl, and I know it will gladden your own heart as well as the children's.""""I don't wonder you think that, stepmothery,"" said Patty, her eyes twinkling at Nan, ""for I did tell you so. But since then I've changed my mind, and though I want my present from father in cash, I'm going to spend it before Christmas, and not put it in the bank at all.""""Friends,"" she said, ""you see before you a pauper,--a penniless pauper! Therefore, and because of which, and by reason of the fact that I am in immediate need of money, I stoop to this means of obtaining it, and, as aforesaid, I'd like it now!""So she told them, quite seriously, how she had really forgotten to give the poor and the suffering any share of her own Christmas cheer, and how this was the only way she could think of to remedy her neglect."
"""It's perfectly lovely,"" said Nan, as they all started out for a little spin, to try it. ""I've had so much trouble of late with taxicabs, that it's a genuine comfort to have my own car at my beck and call. It's a lovely car, Fred, and Patty and I shall just about live in it.""""You're lucky that you didn't hear them,"" laughed Patty. ""Yes, I did get them,--not all drums, some other toys,--and I took them down to the Sunshine place yesterday. I went with Mrs. Morse and Clementine. You know the kiddywids had their Christmas tree, the little poor children, and such a noise you never heard! They yelled and shouted for glee, and they banged drums and tooted horns, and then they sang songs, and I think I never knew such a noisy celebration, even on the fourth of July.""""Oh, yes, indeed! Why, just think, father, the little girls all had dolls, but if I hadn't taken the gifts for the boys, they would only have had candy or an orange. Next Christmas I'm going to do more for them.""""Well, wait till the holiday season is over,"" advised Mr. Fairfield. ""You've made forty boys happy, now turn your attention to making your family and friends happy. What are you going to give your poor old father for a Christmas gift, I should like to know.""""I haven't any such relative as you describe,"" returned Patty, smiling at him affectionately. ""I have a young and handsome father, and I think he seems to be rather a rich gentleman. Also I have a gift awaiting him at home, and I think we'd better be going there.""""This ox-tail soup is in place of the boar's head,"" she went on, gaily; ""and I know we are going to have chicken croquettes, which we will pretend are the roast turkey. And then we'll have our presents, as I know you two will fly for your train as soon as you leave the table.""So Patty gave Nan her present, which was a lovely white couch pillow of lace and embroidery. And Nan gave Patty a picture to hang in her own room. It was a beautiful water-colour, a Venetian scene, and Patty was delighted with it.Nan gave her husband a watch fob, on which hung a locket containing a miniature of her own sweet face. Neither Patty nor her father had seen this before, as Nan had been careful to keep the matter secret in order to surprise them.It was a real work of art, and so winsome was the pictured face that Patty cried out in admiration: ""What a stunner you are, Nan! I didn't realise you were so good-looking,--but it's exactly like you.""Nan's furs were ermine, and Patty's were soft, fluffy, white fox, and so beautiful were they that the two recipients donned them at once, and posed side by side before the mirror, admiring themselves and each other. Then, with a simultaneous impulse they turned to thank the donor, and Mr. Fairfield found himself suddenly entangled in four arms and two boas, while two immense muffs met at the back of his neck and enveloped his head and ears.""Oh, Fathery Fairfield,"" Patty cried, ""you are the dearest thing in the world! How _did_ you know I wanted furs? And white fox, of all things! And ermine for Nan! Oh, but you _are_ a good gentleman! Isn't he, stepmother?"""
"Patty, too, went to her room to get ready for her visit at the Farringtons'. She was to stay three days, and as there were several parties planned for her entertainment, she packed a small trunk with several of her prettiest gowns. Also, she had a suitcase full of gifts for the Christmas tree, which was to be part of the festivities.""At any rate, it would be absurd to give my white furs, or my chiffon frocks to poor people,"" she concluded, ""for they couldn't use them. Well, after the holidays, I'm going to see what I can do. But now, I must hurry, or I'll be late.""Indeed, Mrs. Farrington was in a whirlpool of presents that she was both sending and receiving. Maids and footmen were running hither and thither, bringing messages or carrying out orders, and as the whole house was full of warmth and light, and the spicy fragrance of Christmas greens, Patty fairly revelled in the pleasant atmosphere.She was of a nature very susceptible to surroundings. Like a cat, she loved to bask in warm sunshine, or in a luxurious, softly-furnished place. Moreover, she was fond of Elise, and so looked forward to her three days' visit with glad anticipation.""Well, perhaps I'll hold you to that,"" said Patty, slowly; ""for after the holidays I'm going to try to do something in the matter. I don't know just what; I haven't thought it out yet. But I'm not going to be what my father calls a 'mere social butterfly,' and I don't believe you want to, either.""The room was entirely of glass, and by a careful arrangement of double panes and concealed heat-pipes, was made comfortable even in the coldest weather. Flowers and plants were round the sides; birds in gilt cages sang and twittered; and gilt wicker furniture gave the place a dainty French effect that was charming. On the tables were strewn Christmas gifts of all sorts.""That's just what I don't know. I bought the ring for Roger and the paper cutter for Kenneth Harper; he's coming to-night. But I'd like to change them about and give the ring to Ken, and the paper knife to Roger. Would you?""""Well, she ought to, and I think she would. Now, don't be silly; give the ring to Roger, and if you want something grander than this bronze jig for Ken, get him a book. As handsome a book as you choose; but a book. Or something that's impersonal. Not a ring or a watch-fob, or anything like that.""""Elise, you're a goose!"" said Patty, losing her patience at last. ""A gift like that is not in very good taste from a boy to a girl; but from a girl to a boy, it's very much worse. And, anyway, it was different in my case; for Ken and I are old friends, which you and he are not. And, beside, father knew about it, and he said as a parting keepsake it was all right. But at a Christmas tree, in your own house,--Elise, you'll make a great mistake if you give Kenneth Harper a seal ring."""
"Kenneth Harper was there too, but there were no other guests, as this evening was to be a family celebration. Soon the other members of the household appeared, and then dinner was announced, and they all went to the dining-room.The Farrington household was conducted on a most elaborate plan, and their dinners were usually very formal and conventional. But to-night was an exception, and, save for the solemn butler and grave footmen, everybody in the room was bubbling over with laughter and merriment.""Ho, ho!"" laughed Kenneth, seeing it across the table; ""another good chance lost! You know the penalty, Patty, if you're caught under the mistletoe. But of course if you eat mistletoe, the charm fails.""""Fairly caught!"" he cried; ""under the mistletoe!"" And before Patty caught the jest, Roger had kissed her pretty pink cheek, and then calmly restored her plate of ice cream to its place in front of her.""It never can happen again,"" said Kenneth, in sad tones, as he watched the ""mistletoe"" disappear. ""But I'll not give up all hope. It's still Christmas Eve, and there are other mistletoes and other manners.""The children understood this, and Hester and Bobby at once ran out of the room. A few moments later they returned, dressed in trailing white robes, like surplices, and before they reached the drawing-room, their childish voices could be heard singing old-fashioned carols.Meantime, the older ones were admiring the decorations of the room. Round the walls were smaller evergreen trees of varying heights, giving the effect of a clearing in a grove of evergreens. The ceiling had been draped across with dark blue material, and was studded with stars, made of tiny electric lights.Quite content to wait for their gifts, Mrs. Farrington and the girls stood round watching the proceedings with interest, and soon Patty and Elise were down on the floor, too, breathlessly waiting the completion of the structure, and cheering gaily as the first train went successfully round the long track. Other trains followed, switches were set, signals opened or closed, bridges crossed, and all the manoeuvres of a real railroad repeated in miniature.As he was only a dinner guest, of course Kenneth had no such array of gifts, though the Farringtons had given him some pretty trifles, and Patty gave him a charming little Tanagra statuette she had brought from Florence.""Oh, indeed I do. Not exactly because they've given me all these pretty things, for I love the girls just as much in the summer time as at Christmas. But because they're my friends, and so,--I love them.""""No,"" said Patty, pretending to look downcast. ""Now, isn't that _too_ bad! Well, never mind, I've plenty of gratitude to go round, anyway. And I offer you a big share of that, Roger, for this silver box.""""Yes, it is a present, I know,"" said Roger, and in the laugh at this sally the subject was dropped, but Roger secretly vowed to look up the subject of crystals and find out why Patty was so pleased with a marble."
"""Pooh,"" said Patty, who, in kimono and bedroom slippers, nestled in a big easy-chair in front of the wood-fire in Elise's dressing-room. ""I've known Ken for years, and we do think a lot of each other. But you needn't take that tone, Elise. It's a boy and girl chumminess, and you know it. Why, Ken doesn't think any more of me than Roger does.""""Well, then, I'll stay blind, for I don't want to see devoted swains worshipping the Persian rugs I walk on! Though if you mean these beautiful rugs that are on all the floors of your house, Elise, I don't know that I blame the swains so much. By the way, I suppose some of them are 'prayer rugs' anyway, so that makes it all the more appropriate.""Patty had risen, and was stalking up and down the room with jerky strides, and dramatic waving of her arms. Her golden hair hung in a curly cloud over her blue silk kimono, and her voice thrilled with a tragic intensity, though, of course, exaggerated to a ludicrous degree.""Oh, Patty,"" cried Elise, forgetting the subject in hand, ""you ought to be an actress! Do you know, you were quite stunning when you flung yourself round so. And, Patty, with your voice,--your singing voice, I mean,--you ought to go on the stage! _Do_, will you, Patty? I'd love to see you an opera singer!""""Bother the swains! Patty, my heart is set upon it. You must be an actress. I mean a really nice, gentle, refined one, like Maude Adams, or Eleanor Robson. Oh, they are so sweet! and such noble, grand women.""""Then you'd better begin fooling. It's more sensible than your earnestness. Now, I'm going to run away to bed and leave you to dream that you're a circus-rider, whizzing round a ring on a snow-white Arab steed. Good-night, girlie.""Alone in her room, Patty smiled to herself at Elise's foolishness. And yet, though she had no desire to be an actress, Patty had sometimes dreamed of herself as a concert singer, enchanting her audiences with her clear, sweet voice, which was fine and true, if not great. She was ambitious, though as yet not definitely so, and Elise's words had roused a dormant desire to be or to do something worth while, and not, as she thought to herself, be a mere social butterfly.It was all of white. A white cloth frock, with short skirt; white broadcloth coat and a Russian turban of white cloth and fur; long white leather leggings, and her Christmas furs, which added a charming touch to the costume."
"As being more comfortable for skating, she had returned to her former mode of hair-dressing, and so two big white ribbon bows bloomed at the back of her head. These, and the short skirt, quite took away Patty's grown-up air, and made her seem a little girl again.""Sure you do!"" said Roger, looking at the two girls admiringly. ""No fellow on the ice will escort such beautiful ladies as I have in my charge. Now, we'll pick up Ken and the Morses, and then make a dash for the Pole.""Elise was a little uncertain as to what these were, exactly, but she resolved to look them up as soon as she reached home. At any rate, she knew Kenneth meant to be complimentary, and she smiled with pleasure.He was a most reliable boy, and always took charge of their little expeditions or outings. Elise never thought of questioning his authority, so again they all bundled into the car, and started homeward.So the Morses consented, and the six merry young people had tea under the Christmas tree, and told stories by the firelight, and laughed and chatted until Clementine declared she must go, or she'd never get back in time for the dance.Patty's was of apricot-coloured satin, veiled all over with a delicate thin material of the same shade. A pearl trimming encircled the slightly low-cut throat and the short sleeves. It was very becoming to pretty Patty, and she knew herself that she had never looked better.Elise's gown was of white silk, draped with silvered lace. It was lovely, and suited Elise's dark hair and eyes, and really both girls were pictures. But Patty's face was sunny and happy, while Elise's red mouth drooped in a little curve of discontent.The dance was in the tennis court, where a smooth crash had replaced the snowy floor of the Christmas Eve celebration. The Christmas tree still stood there, as it formed a beautiful decoration for that end of the ballroom.An exquisite dancer, she was, of course, besieged by partners, but in her merry, wholehearted way, she treated them all alike, showing favouritism to none, and dancing with less desirable partners as pleasantly and happily as with those she liked better.""You're wasted on a fellow like Harry Barr,"" he said, as he and Patty started for a turn. ""He dances like a grain-thresher, and yet you bob along with him as smilingly as if you were dancing with a decent tripper.""""Why not?"" returned Patty; ""he's pleasant and kind. He doesn't _talk_ like a grain-thresher, and he can't help his dancing. Or rather, his lack of it, for you can't call those gymnastics of his dancing. Oh, Roger, there's Mr. Hepworth!""""You know I am old-fashioned,"" he said, as he greeted the Fairfield family, and joined their circle round the library fire. ""But I don't suppose you thought I was quite so old-fashioned as to make calls on New Year's Day. However, I'm not quite doing that, as this is the only call I shall make to-day."""
"""You needn't laugh,"" began Patty, pouting a little. Then she laughed herself, and went on: ""Yes, you may laugh if you want to,--I know I sound ridiculous. But I tell you, people, I'm going to make good!""""Oh, cut it out, daddy,"" said Patty, dimpling with laughter, for she knew her occasional slang phrases amused her father, even though they annoyed him. ""If you'll help me 'do noble things, not dream them all day long,' I'll promise to talk only in purest English undefiled.""""She'll get over it,"" he said. ""A few years of these 'noble aims' of hers will make her so serious-minded that she won't even see the meaning of a slang phrase. Though, I must admit, I think some of them very apt, myself.""""But I'll tell you one thing,"" went on Mr. Hepworth: ""Whatever line you decide upon, let it be something that needs no training. I mean, if you choose to go in for organised charity or settlement work, well and good. But don't attempt Red Cross nursing or kindergarten teaching, or anything that requires technical knowledge. For in these days, only trained labour succeeds, and only expert, at that.""""Yes, she really has done some remarkable work. But she is poor and lives in a small country town. She has already learned all the local teachers can give her, and needs the technical training of a good art school. With a year of such training she could easily become, I am sure, a successful illustrator. At least, after a year's study, I know she could get good work to do, and then she would rapidly become known.""""No; she is ambitious in her work, but in no other way. She is shy and timid; a country girl, inexperienced in the ways of the world, ignorant of city life, and desperately afraid of New York, which to her is a name for all unknown terrors.""""Perhaps you've achieved your spunk since you came North, then,"" said Hepworth; ""for I agree with your father, Southern girls do not have much energy of character. At least, Miss Farley hasn't. She's about nineteen or twenty, but she's as childish as a girl of fourteen,--except in her work; there she excels any one of her age I've ever known.""""I don't know. I'm told they're very proud people, and would not accept charity. Of course she never can earn anything by her work if she stays at home; and as she can't get away, it seems to be a deadlock.""""Well, if you don't mean it for an epigram, I'll forgive you,--but don't let it happen again. Now, as to Christine Farley. I'll let you be clever for once, if you'll turn your cleverness to devising some way to aid her to an art education. Can you think of any way?""""I can think of dozens,"" returned Patty, ""but the only thing to do is for her to come to New York, get a scholarship at the Art School, and then board in a hall bedroom,--art students always do that,--and they have jolly good times with chafing dishes and palette knives, and such things. I've read about 'em."""
"""Oh, Nan!"" cried Patty, ""you could! I'm sure you could! Why, I'll bet I could earn fifteen dollars a week, and have plenty of time left for my practising, my club meetings, motoring, skating, and all the things I want to do beside. Fifteen dollars a week is _nothing_!""""Gently, gently, my girl,"" said her father, for Patty's cheeks were pink with the earnestness of her argument. ""Fifteen dollars a week seems nothing to you, because you have all the money you want. But where is your sense of proportion? Your idea of relative values? The value of fifteen dollars handed out to you willingly by a loving father, or the value of fifteen dollars earned from a grudging employer, are totally different matters.""""There's a good deal in that,"" said Hepworth, thoughtfully. ""Miss Farley does need somebody to make her think she can do things. But the life of an art student is a busy one, and I'm sure she couldn't earn much money while she's studying.""""Look here, Puss,"" said her father: ""sometimes you show a bravery of assertion that ought to be put to the test. Now I'll make a proposition to you in the presence of these two witnesses. If you'll earn fifteen dollars in one week,--any week,--I'll agree to pay the board of this Miss Farley in New York, for a year, while she pursues her art studies.""""Wait a moment; there are conditions, or rather stipulations. You must not do anything unbecoming a quiet, refined girl,--but I know you wouldn't do that, anyway. You must not engage in any pursuit that keeps you away from your home after five o'clock in the afternoon----""""Oh,"" interrupted Patty, ""I don't propose to go out washing! I shall do light work of some sort at home. But never you mind what I do,--of course it will be nothing you could possibly object to,--I'll earn fifteen dollars in less than a week."" Alone in her own room that same night, Patty thought out her great project. She was not at all doubtful of her success, she was only choosing among the various methods of earning money that occurred to her.""Father is an angel,"" she thought to herself; ""a big, splendid angel. He knew I could do my part easily enough, and he only made it a stipulation because he didn't want to shoulder the whole affair outright. He wanted me to feel I had a hand in it. He's so tactful and dear. Well, I'll do my part so well, he'll have nothing to complain of. Then I'll get Nan to write to the girl, and invite her here for a few days or a week. Then I rather guess we can gently persuade her to accept the goods the gods provide."""
"She thought Patty's scheme ridiculous, but harmless, for she knew the girl well enough to know she wouldn't do anything that might lead her into an unpleasant position; but she feared that her boundless enthusiasm would urge her on beyond the bounds of her nervous strength.Though soundly healthy, Patty was high-strung, and stopped at no amount of exertion to attain a desired end. More than once this nervous energy of hers had caused physical collapse, which was what Nan feared for her now.It was more like a large warehouse. Partitions that rose only part way to the ceiling divided off small rooms or departments, all of which were piled high with boxes or crates. The aisles between these were narrow, and the whole place was rather dark. Moreover, there seemed to be nobody about.""All right,"" said Patty, whose spirits always rose when she encountered difficulties. She saw the staircase, now; a rough, wooden structure of unplaned boards, and no balusters. But she trudged up the long flight hopefully.The next floor seemed to be full of whirring looms, and the noise was, as Patty described it afterward, like the buzzing of a billion bees! But, asking no further directions, she ascended the next staircase and the next, until she found herself on the fourth floor.The man took it from her, not rudely, but as if every moment were precious. Deftly he opened the parcel, and gave a quick glance at Patty's exquisite needlework on the doilies and centrepieces she had brought.He pointed a grimy finger in the direction she should take, and went on, whistling. Down the three flights of stairs went Patty, and thanks to the clarity of the red-headed one's direction, she soon found Department B.""Yes,"" said the woman, ""but can't you understand? This is a deposit to protect ourselves if you never return, or if you spoil the work. If you bring it back in satisfactory condition, at the appointed time, we return your deposit, and pay you the price agreed upon for the work.""""If what you do is done right, you'll get paid. And if the pieces you don't do are unsoiled and in good condition, we redeem them. But if you care for steady work here, you'd better not take more'n you can accomplish.""The pattern was a floral design, tied with bow-knots and interlaced with a conventional lattice-work. The shading of the blossoms was complicated, and showed many shades of each colour. The bow-knots were of a solid colour, but required close, fine stitches of a tedious nature, while the lattice-work part seemed to present an interminable task.""And yet, Nan,"" she said, ""it's really pathetic; they all seemed so busy and so tired. The woman who gave me the work was like a machine,--as if she just fed out centrepieces to people who came for them. I'm sure she hasn't smiled for fourteen years. The only gay one in the place was the red-headed boy; and he talked such fearful slang it cured me of ever using it again! Father will be glad of that, anyway. Hereafter I shall converse in Henry James diction. Why, Nan, he said, 'Pipe de guy wit' de goggles'!"""
"""No, I won't. There's no cure like an awful example. Watch the elegance of my conversation from now on. And besides, Nan, you mustn't act as if I associated with them socially. I assure you I was quite the haughty lady. But that slangy boy was an angel unawares. I'd probably be there yet but for his kindly aid.""""No, ducky stepmother of mine. The only way you can help is to head off callers. I can do the work if I can keep at it. But if the girls come bothering round, I'll never get it done. Now, this afternoon, I want to do a lot, so if any one asks for me, won't you gently but firmly refuse to let them see me? Make yourself so entertaining that they'll forget my existence.""""Yes, I have."" Patty didn't dare say she had three dozen. ""And if I do well this afternoon, I can calculate how long the work will take. Oh, Nan, I do want to succeed. It isn't only the work, you know, it's the principle. I hate to be baffled; and I _won't_ be!""A stubborn look came into Patty's pretty eyes,--a look which Nan knew well. A look which meant that the indomitable will might be broken but not bent, and that Patty would persevere in her chosen course until she conquered or was herself defeated.But though her fingers fairly flew, the pattern progressed slowly. She even allowed herself to leave long stitches on the wrong side,--a thing she never did in her own embroidery. She tried to do all the petals of one tint at once, to avoid delay of changing the silks. She used every effort to make ""her head save her hands,"" but the result was that both head and hands became heated and nervous.""No,"" said Nan, pleasantly, pretending not to notice Patty's flushed cheeks and tired eyes. Really, she had several times stolen on tiptoe to Patty's door, and anxiously looked at her bending over her work. But Patty didn't know this, and wise Nan concluded the time to speak was not yet.""Nan, you're such a comfort!"" cried Patty, jumping up to embrace her stepmother. ""You always say just the very right thing. Now, I'm going back to work. I feel all rested now, and I'm sure I can finish a lot to-day. Why, Nan Fairfield! for goodness' sake! Is it really four o'clock?"""
"Patty had just noticed the time, and was aghast! Two solid hours she had worked, and only a small portion of one piece was done! She hadn't dreamed the time had flown so, and thought it about three o'clock.Straight sailing it was,--but very tedious. An untrue stitch spoiled the smooth continuance of the embroidery that was to represent tied ribbon bows. An untrue stitch--and she made several--had to be picked out and done over, and this often meant frayed silk, or an unsightly needle hole in the linen.And then Mr. Fairfield, who had been somewhat enlightened by Nan as to how matters stood, chatted gaily of other things, and Patty forgot her troublesome work, and was quite her own gay, saucy self again.""Mind? Of course not. I rather fancy we're good enough friends not to misunderstand each other. If you'll let me come and make up my time some other night, I'll skip out now, so quick you can't see me fly!""But the tired voice had a quiver in it, for all at once Patty saw that she had failed. She had worked hard all the afternoon and evening, and had not finished one of her thirty-six pieces! It was this discovery that upset her, rather than the unexpected visit from her parents.But Mr. Fairfield didn't laugh. His limited knowledge of embroidery made him ignorant of how much work ""three dozen"" might mean, but he knew the effect it had already had on Patty, and he knew it was time to interfere.""No, Patty; I think I need say nothing more. I see you know when you're beaten, and I fancy you won't touch needle to that pile of work again! I hope you can settle matters with your 'employer'; if not, I'll help you out. But I want to congratulate you on your pluck and perseverance, even if,--well, even if they were----""""She has spoiled this piece for our use. She works nicely enough, but no two people work exactly alike, so no one else could now take this and complete the corner. So, you see the piece is valueless, and we must charge for it. Moreover, I should have to deduct fifty cents if it had been finished, because long stitches show on the wrong side.""""Indeed I'm not! But to-day I'm going to frivol. I worked hard enough yesterday to deserve a rest, and I'm going to take it. Come on, let's go somewhere nice to luncheon, and then go to a matinée; it's Wednesday.""The concert proved most enjoyable. Dinner at the Farringtons' was equally so, and when Patty reached home at about nine o'clock, she had much to tell Nan and her father, who were always glad to hear of her social pleasures."
"Armed with her pile of work, and her basket of sewing materials, Patty went up to the fourth floor, where a small room was set apart as a sewing-room. It was rarely used, save by the maids, for Nan was not fond of sewing; but there was a good sewing-machine there, and ample light and space.The plan worked well. The simple little garments had but two seams, and setting the machine stitch rather long, Patty whizzed the little white slips through, one after the other, singing in time to her treadle.She had not realised how physically tired she was. Running the sewing-machine all day was an unusual exertion, and when she reached her own room, with her arms full of the little white garments, she threw them on the bed, and threw herself on the couch, weary in every bone and muscle.""Oh, Nan,"" cried Patty, laughing, ""me legs is broke; and me arms is broke; and me back is broke. But I'm not nervous or worried, and I'm going to win out this time! But, Nan, I just _can't_ go down to dinner. Send Jane up with a tray,--there's a dear. And tell father I'm all right, but I don't care to mingle in society to-night.""""Run along, Nan, there's a good lady,"" said Patty, jumping up, and urging Nan out the door. ""Skippy-skip, before father comes up to learn the latest news from the seat of war. Tell him everything is all right, and I'm earning my living with neatness and despatch, only working girls simply can't get into chiffons and dine with the 'quality.'""""These experiences will do her no harm,"" said Mr. Fairfield, after hearing Nan's story. ""So long as she doesn't get nervous or mentally upset, we'll let her go on with her experiment. She's a peculiar nature, and has a wonderful amount of will-power for one so young.""She wearily picked up a little gown, cut a buttonhole at the throat, and proceeded to work it. As she was so skilful at embroidery, of course this was easy work; but Patty was tired, and her fingers almost refused to push the needle through the cloth. About ten o'clock Nan came upstairs.""Nan, I'm vanquished, but not subdued. I'm just one mass of lameness and ache, but if you think I've given up my plan, you're greatly mistaken. However, I'm through with 'white work,' and I've sewed my last sew on a machine.""""No, I'm not! I'm perfectly well. Just a trifle lame from over-exercise yesterday. I'll stay in bed to-day, and Nan, dear, if you love me, take those slips back to the kind lady who let me have them to play with. Make her pay you a dollar for the dozen, and don't let her deduct more than a dollar for the upside-downness of the sleeves. Tell her they're prettier that way, anyway. And, Catharine, do please rub me with some healing lotion or something,--for I'm as lame as a jelly-fish!"""
"""It's perfectly awful,"" she said to Patty, when relating her adventure, ""to think of the poor girls who are really trying to earn their living by white work. It's all very well for you, who are only experimenting, but suppose a real worker gets all her pay deducted!""""There's hardly enough pay to pay for deducting it, anyway,"" said Patty. ""Oh, Nan, it is dreadful! I suppose lots of poor girls who feel as tired and lame as I do this morning, have to go straight back to their sewing-machine and run it all day.""""No; and I don't intend to try. But I can do something to help. I know I can. That's where people show their lack of a sense of proportion. I know I can't do anything for the world, as a world, but if I can help in a few individual cases, that will be my share. For instance, if I can help this Christine Farley to an art education, and so to a successful career, why that's so much to the good. And though father has set me a hard task to bring it about, I'm going to do it yet.""""Oh, I don't mean butterfly,--as so many people do,--to represent a frivolous, useless person. I have a great respect for butterflies, myself. And you radiate the same effect of joy, happiness, gladness, and beauty, as a butterfly does when hovering around in the golden sunshine of a summer day.""""Yes, I have. It's your mission in life to be happy, and so to make others happy. This you can do without definite effort, so stick to your calling, and let the more prosaic people, the plodders,--earn wages.""""They are Darby and Juliet,"" he remarked, as he looked anxiously into the bowl. ""I am so tired of hackneyed pairs of names, that I've varied these. But, won't you send for some more water? I had to bring them with only a little, for fear I'd spill it, and they seem to have drunk it nearly all up.""""Yes, clever child, dormant. And now while they sleep, I'll tell you my plan. You see, these are extra intelligent goldfish,--especially Juliet, the one with a black spot on her shoulder. Well, you've only to train them a bit, and then give exhibitions of your trained goldfish! You've no idea what a hit it will make.""""Now, Ken,"" went on Patty, for she knew his ""bark was worse than his bite,"" ""I don't want you to do anything much. But, in your law office, where you're studying, aren't there some papers I can copy, or something like that?""""Patty, you're a back number. That 'copying' that you mean is all out of date. In these days of typewriters and manifold thigamajigs, we lawyers don't have much copying done by hand. Except, perhaps, engrossing. Can you do that?"""
"""Of course I do. I'm getting in practice against the time it'll be true. But if you really want to copy, buy a nice Spencerian Copy-book, and fill up its pages. It'll be about as valuable as any other work of the sort.""""Nothing in the world but suggestion. You think a Japanese crystal _ought_ to make you feel supernatural, and so you imagine it does. But it doesn't any such nonsense. Now, I'll tell you why I like them. Only because they're so flawlessly perfect. In shape, colour, texture,--if you can call it texture,--but I mean material or substance. There isn't an attribute that they possess, except in perfection. That's a great thing, Patty; and you can't say it of anything else.""""Goldfish always make me think of a story about Whistler,"" said Mr. Fairfield. ""It seems, Whistler once had a room in a house in Florence, directly over a person who had some pet goldfish in a bowl. Every pleasant day the bowl was set out on the balcony, which was exactly beneath Whistler's balcony. For days he resisted the temptation to fish for them with a bent pin and a string; but at last he succumbed to his angling instincts, and caught them all. Then, remorseful at what he had done, he fried them to a fine golden brown, and returned them to their owner on a platter.""""Ugh!"" cried Nan, ""what a horrid story! Why do they always tack unpleasant stories on poor old Whistler? Now, I know a lovely story about a goldfish, which I will relate. It is said to be the composition of a small Boston schoolchild. ""'Oh, Robin, lovely goldfish! Who teached you how to fly? Who sticked the fur upon your breast? 'Twas God, 'twas God what done it.'""Now, don't be a wet blanket and throw cold water on my plans,"" said Patty, a little mixed in her metaphor, but smiling placidly at her stepmother. ""This time it's really a most sensible undertaking that I'm going to undertake.""""Not I! To me a failure only means a more vigorous attempt next time. Now, Nan, I shall be away all day,--until about five o'clock. Won't you play with Darby and Juliet a little, so they won't get lonesome?"""
"Patty started off, and this time she gave Miller an address not so far away as before. When he brought the motor-car to a standstill, before a fashionable millinery shop, he felt none of the surprise that he had when he took Patty to what he considered inappropriate places.But it was early for fashionable ladies to be out shopping, so the rather supercilious young woman greeted Patty with a cautious air of reserve. It was so different from the effusive manner usually shown to Nan and Patty when they really went shopping, that Patty was secretly much amused. But as she was also secretly greatly embarrassed, it was with an uncertain air that she said:Patty's inflections were not in the least sarcastic, in fact her whole manner was gentle and gracious, but something in her tone, perhaps the note of amusement, made the saleswoman look at her suddenly and sharply.""Oh,--sudden reverses,"" murmured Miss O'Flynn, thinking she had solved the problem. ""Well, my dear, you have evidently been brought up a lady, so it will be hard for you to find work. I am sorry to say I cannot employ you, as I engage only skilled workwomen.""Miss O'Flynn was more puzzled than ever. Insistent though Patty was, it didn't seem to her the insistence of a poor girl wanting to earn her bread; it was more like the determination of a wilful child to attain its desire.""I will do as you ask. You may go to the workroom for to-day; but on the understanding that unless you show unusual skill or aptitude to learn, you are not to be paid anything, nor are you to come to-morrow.""Then she gave Patty an elaborate velvet hat, trimmed with feathers, and materials for sewing. She also gave her white silk for the lining of the hat, and a piece stamped with gilt letters, which Patty knew must be placed inside the crown.Though she had never lined a hat before, she knew in a general way how it should be done, and she tried to go about it with an air of experience. The other girls at the table cast furtive glances at her.She had said at home that she believed it would be possible for her to earn her living without special instruction, and it seemed to her, that if she now asked for advice it would be like getting special training, though in a small degree.Remembering that the stitch she used on her ""white work"" had been criticised as too long, she now was careful to take very short stitches, and she used her utmost endeavour to make her work neat and dainty.But Patty's expression was so plainly that of a conquering hero, she showed so palpably her pride in her own achievement, that Miss O'Flynn's eyes narrowed, and her face hardened. Without a word to Patty, she handed the hat to a sad-eyed young woman at another table, and said:""Yes, ma'am,"" said the girl; and even as Patty watched her, she began to snip deftly at Patty's small, careful stitches, and in a few moments the lining was out, and the girl was shaping and cutting a new one, with a quick, sure touch, and with not so much as a glance in Patty's direction.The other girls,--the ones at Patty's table,--looked horrified, but they did not look openly at Patty. Furtively, they darted glances at her from beneath half-closed lids, and then as furtively glanced at each other.It was her own independent and assured attitude that had led Miss O'Flynn to pursue this course. She didn't for a moment think that all beginners were treated like this. But she had asked to be given a fair trial--and she was getting it.She knew she had to get the satin on to the frame, without crease or wrinkle. She knew exactly how it ought to look when done, for she had a hat of that sort herself, and the material covered the foundation as creaselessly as paint.""I'm sure it only needs gumption,"" thought Patty, hopefully. ""Here's my real chance to prove that it doesn't need a series of lessons to get some satin smoothly on a crinoline frame. If I do it neatly, she won't ask some other girl to do it over."""
"Paying no attention to the covert glances of her companions, Patty set to work. She cut carefully, she fitted neatly; she pinned and she basted; she smoothed and she patted; and finally she sewed, with tiny, close stitches, placed evenly and with great precision.So absorbed did she become in her task that she failed to notice the departure of the others at noon. Alone she sat there at the table, snipping, sewing, pinning, and patting the somewhat refractory satin.""It is not right,"" said Miss O'Flynn. ""It is not done right, because you do not know how to do it. You have never been taught how to cover hats or how to line them; consequently you cannot do them right.""The other girls had gone to luncheon, so the two were alone in the room. Patty knew that Miss O'Flynn was telling her the truth, and yet she resented it. A red spot burned in each cheek as she answered:The other smiled. ""That is my argument,"" she said. ""You _don't know_. Of course stitches should be small for ordinary sewing, and for many sorts of work. But not for millinery. Here long stitches are wanted, but they must be rightly set,--not careless long stitches.""""Because a better effect can be produced with long stitches. You see, your stitches are small and true, but every one shows. With a skilful long stitch, no stitch is seen at all. It is what we call a blind stitch, and can only be successfully done by skilled workers, who have been taught, and who have also had practice.""Her confidence returned. She knew she could do what she was now about to attempt, for, added to her natural taste and love of colour, she had been critically interested in hats while in Paris, and while visiting her friend, Lady Kitty, who was especially extravagant in her millinery purchases.One was to be a simple style of decoration, the other, much more complicated. Taking up the elaborate one first, Patty went at it with energy, and with an assured touch, for she had the effect definitely pictured in her imagination and was sure she could materialise it.Without response, other than a quiet smile, Patty took up the second hat. This was simple, but daring in its very simplicity. A black velvet Gainsborough, with broad, rolling brim. Patty turned it smartly up, at one side, and fastened it with a rosette of dull blue velvet and a silver buckle. Just then, Miss O'Flynn came in.The white brim rolled slightly back, and where it touched the low crown it met two immense roses, one black and one of palest pink. Two slight sprays of foliage, made of black velvet leaves, nestled between the roses, and completed the trimming."
"Her triumph over Miss O'Flynn seemed small and petty. She was conscious of a revolt against the whole atmosphere of the place. The suavity of Miss O'Flynn's manner, the artificial grandeur of Madame Villard, filled her with aversion, and she wanted only to get away, and get back to her own home.""You are certainly clever,"" said Madame Villard, patronisingly, as she looked at the hats Miss O'Flynn held up for her inspection. ""I am glad to offer you a permanent position here. You will have to learn the rudiments of the work, as the most gifted genius should always be familiar with the foundations of his own art. Will you agree to come to me every day?""Patty hesitated. She hated the thought of coming every day, even if but for a week. And yet, here was the opportunity she was in search of. Trimming hats was easy enough work; probably they wouldn't make her learn lining and covering at once.""Well,"" said Madame Villard, ""as you are so ignorant of the work, I ought not to give you any recompense at all; but as you evince such an aptitude for trimming I am willing to say, five dollars a week.""Patty did not mean to be rude or impertinent. Indeed, for the moment she was not even thinking of herself. She was thinking how a poor girl, who had her living to earn, would feel at an offer of five dollars for six long days of work in that dreadful atmosphere.""I beg your pardon,"" she said, mechanically, and she said it more because of Madame Villard's look of amazement, than because of any regret at her own blunt speech. ""I shouldn't have spoken so frankly. But the compensation you offer is utterly inadequate.""""But wait,--wait, Miss Fairfield,"" exclaimed the Madame, who had no wish to let her new-found genius thus slip away from her. ""I like your work. I may say I think it shows touches of real talent. Also, you have unusually good taste. In view of these things, I will overlook still further your ignorance of the details of the work, and I will give you seven dollars a week.""""Madame,"" said Patty, ""I am inexperienced in the matter of wages, but I feel sure that you either employ inferior workwomen or that you underpay them. I don't know which, but I assure you that I could not think of accepting your offer of seven dollars a week.""""For twelve, then? This is my ultimate offer, and you would do well to consider it carefully. I have never paid so much to any workwoman, and I offer it to you only because I chance to like your style of work.""""Then why don't you pay them twelve dollars a week?"" cried Patty, whose harassed nerves were making her irritable. ""I will call our financial account even, but if any of your workwomen can trim hats that you like as well as those that I trimmed, I trust you will give them the salary you offered me. Good-afternoon."""
"Patty bowed politely, and then, with a more kindly bow and smile to Miss O'Flynn, she went through the draperies, through the front salesroom, and out at the front door. The milliner and her forewoman followed her with a dignified slowness, but reached the window in time to see Patty get into an elaborately-appointed motor-car which rolled rapidly away.""Oh, father, I was so afraid she _would_ say fifteen! Then I should have felt that I ought to go to her for a week; for I may not get another such chance. But I couldn't live in that place a week, I _know_ I couldn't!""""I don't know exactly why,"" returned Patty, thoughtfully. ""But it's mostly because it's all so artificial and untrue. Miss O'Flynn talks as if she were a superior being; Madame Villard talks as if she were a Royal personage. They talk about their customers and each other in a sort of make-believe grandiose way, that is as sickening as it is absurd. I don't know how to express it, but I'd rather work in a place where everybody is real, and claims only such honour and glory as absolutely belong to them. I hate pretence!"" As Patty was temporarily out of an ""occupation,"" she went skating the next day with the Farringtons and Kenneth. Indeed, the four were so often together that they began to call themselves the Quartette.The goldfish were a never-failing source of fun for the Quartette. The fish themselves were quiet, inoffensive little creatures, but the ready imagination of the young people invested them with all sorts of strange qualities, both physical and mental.The reason was, that the Fairfield house, though handsomely appointed, was not so formally grand as the Farringtons', and there was always an atmosphere of cordiality and hospitality at Patty's, while at Elise's it was oppressively formal and dignified.""No, I don't,"" declared Kenneth, promptly. ""And we don't want any musical nonsense, or any dramatic foolishness, either. Let's just have fun; if it's pleasant weather, we'll go skating, or sleighing, or motoring, or whatever you like; if it isn't, we'll stay indoors, or go to a matinée or concert, or something like that.""""Ken, you're very unjust,"" said Patty, her cheeks flushing; ""of course I have to give Mr. Hepworth tea when he asks for it; and if I seem more 'grown-up' with him, it's because he's so much older than you are.""""Yes, I have,"" said Mr. Hepworth, as he stirred his tea. ""That is, I've heard of her. My friend, down in Virginia, who knows Miss Farley, has sent me another of her sketches, and it proves more positively than ever that the girl has real genius. But, Patty, I want you to give up this scheme of yours to help her. It was good of your father to make the offer he did, but I don't want you racing around to these dreadful places looking for work. I'm going to get some other people interested in Miss Farley, and I'm sure her art education can be managed in some way. I'd willingly subscribe the whole sum needed, myself, but it would be impossible to arrange it that way. She'd never accept it, if she knew; and it's difficult to deceive her.""""I don't wonder you think I can't do what I set out to do,"" she said slowly, ""for I've made so many ridiculous failures already. But please don't lose faith in me, yet. Give me one or two more chances."""
"Though he cared more for Patty than for anything on earth, he had vowed to himself the girl should never know it. He was thirty-five, and Patty but eighteen, and he knew that was too great a discrepancy in years for him ever to hope to win her affections.""Indeed I won't,"" returned Patty. ""At least, not until I've proved to my own satisfaction that my theories are wrong. And I don't think yet that they are. I still believe I can earn fifteen dollars a week, without having had special training for any work. Surely I ought to have time to prove myself right.""""Yes, you ought to have time,"" said Mr. Hepworth, gently, ""but you ought not to do it at all. It's an absurd proposition, the whole thing. And as I, unfortunately, brought it about, I want to ask you, please, to drop it.""""No, sir!"" said Patty, gravely, but wagging a roguish forefinger at him; ""people can't undo their mistakes so easily. If, as you say, you brought about this painful situation, then you must sit patiently by and watch me as I flounder about in the various sloughs of despond.""""Nixy! Not I! Not by no means! But I'll give in to this extent. I'll agree not to make more than three more attempts. If I can't succeed in three more efforts, I'll give up the game, and confess myself a butterfly and an idiot.""""Oh, I can't promise that. I fancy I'd make a rather good lady's-maid or parlour-maid. But I promise you I won't be a cook. Much as I like to fuss with a chafing-dish, I shouldn't like to be kept in a kitchen and boil and roast things all the time.""""I should say not! Well, since I can't persuade you to give up your foolish notion, do go on, and get through with your three attempts as soon as possible. Remember, you've promised not more than three.""""Nonsense, Hepworth,"" said Patty's father, ""I'm glad you started the ball rolling. It hasn't done Patty a bit of harm, so far, and it will be an experience she'll always remember. Let her go ahead; she can't succeed, but she can have the satisfaction of knowing she tried.""""That's just it. I go to take a position as a companion to an elderly lady. And I shall stay a week. I'll take some clothes in a suitcase, or small trunk, and after I'm gone, you must tell father, and make it all right with him."""
"""Yes; but that referred to occupations by the day. Now, that I've decided to take this sort of a position, which is really more appropriate to a lady of my 'social standing,' you must explain to him that I can't come home at five o'clock, because I have to stay all the time, nights and all.""""Yes, the very one! Isn't it gay? She's a bit eccentric, and she advertised for a companion, saying the application must be a written one. So I pranced up to her house this morning, and secured the position.""""Yes; that's why I went myself! I sent up my card, and a message that I had come in answer to her advertisement. She sent back word that I could go home and write to her. I said I'd write then and there. So I helped myself to her library desk, and wrote out a regular application. In less than five minutes, I was summoned to her august presence, and after looking me over, she engaged me at once. How's that for quick action?""""Yes; I know she's a public benefactor, and all that. But, really, she's very interesting; though, I fancy she has a quick temper. However, we've made the agreement for a week. Then if either of us wants to back out, we're at liberty to do so.""""Oh, almost nothing. I'm not a social secretary, or anything like that. Merely a companion, to be with her, and read to her occasionally, or perhaps sing to her, and go to drive with her,--and that's about all.""""I don't think so. She didn't speak of any one, except her secretary and servants. She's rather old-fashioned, and the house is dear. All crystal chandeliers, and old frescoed walls and ceilings, and elaborate door-frames. Why, Nan, it'll be fun to be there a week, and it's so,--well, so safe and pleasant, you know, and so correct and seemly. Why, if I really had to earn my own living, I couldn't do better than to be companion to Mrs. Van Reypen.""""I don't like it, Patty,"" said Nan, after a few moments' thought. ""But it's better, in some ways, than the other things you've done. Go on, and I'll truly do all I can to talk your father into letting you stay there a week; but if he won't consent, I can't help it.""""Go to your room now, my dear, and occupy yourself as you choose until dinner-time. Dinner is at seven. There will be no guests, but you will wear a light, pretty gown, if you please. I am punctilious in such matters."""
"This was an easy opening, and Patty was quite ready to respond gaily, when she suddenly remembered her position in the house and wondered if a companion ought to speak to a strange young man in the same language a young person in society might use.""I am Mrs. Van Reypen's companion,"" said Patty, but though she made the announcement demurely enough, the funny side of it all struck her so forcibly that she had difficulty to keep the corners of her mouth from showing her amusement.""I don't believe I ought to,"" said Patty, hesitatingly placing one little satin-slippered foot on the next step below, and then pausing again. ""You see, I've never been a companion before, but I don't think it's right for me to precede Mrs. Van Reypen into the drawing-room.""""Ah, well, perhaps not. Stay on the stairs, then, if you think that's the proper place. I daresay it is,--I never was a companion, either; so I'm not sure. But sit down, won't you? I'll sit here, if I may.""And so provocative of sociability did the staircase prove, that when Mrs. Van Reypen came down, in all the glory of her black velvet and old lace, she nearly tumbled over two chatting young people, who seemed to be very good friends.The little dinner-party was a gay one; Mrs. Van Reypen became mildly amiable under the influence of the young people's merry chatter, and Patty felt that so far, at least, a companion's lot was not such a very unhappy one.After dinner, however, the young man was sent peremptorily away. He begged to stay, but his aunt ordered him off, declaring that she had seen enough of him, and he was not to return for a week at least. Philip went away, sulkily, declaring that he would call the very next morning to inquire after his aunt's health.""That is right,"" said Mrs. Van Reypen, approvingly. ""You cannot have many friends in your present position, of course. And you must not feel flattered at Mr. Philip's apparent admiration of you. He is a most impressionable youth, and is caught by every new face he sees.""But she pleasantly assured Mrs. Van Reypen that she would give her nephew no further consideration, and though Mrs. Van Reypen looked sharply at Patty's face, she saw only an honest desire to please her employer.""I'm glad I'm here!"" she assured herself, as she dashed cold water into her suspiciously reddened eyes. ""I know I shall have all sorts of odd and interesting adventures here; and I'm determined to be happy whatever happens. And, anyway, it will be over soon. A week isn't long.""Putting on a trim morning dress, of soft old rose cashmere, with a fine embroidered white yoke, she went sedately down to the breakfast room. She had been told to come to breakfast at nine o'clock, and the clock struck the hour just as she crossed the threshold.The rest of the meal was not very enjoyable. Mrs. Van Reypen was clearly displeased at her nephew's presence; Patty did not think it wise to take any active part in the conversation; and, though Philip was in gay spirits, it was not easy to be merry alone.Patty couldn't help smiling at his audacious speeches, but she kept her eyes down on her plate, and endeavoured to ignore the young man's presence, for she knew this was what Mrs. Reypen wished her to do.""You mustn't think him a rude boy, Miss Fairfield,"" she said. ""But he delights to tease me, and unless I am positively cross to him he never lets up. But he is really devoted to me, and, I assure you, he scarcely noted your presence at all."""
"""Of course not,"" said Patty, with great difficulty restraining a burst of laughter. ""No one could dream of Mr. Philip Van Reypen observing a companion."" Patty did not mean this for sarcasm; she desired only to set Mrs. Van Reypen's mind at rest, and then the subject of Philip was dropped.""Heavens! Miss Fairfield, don't ask such a question as that! You are here to entertain me. I am not to provide amusement for you! Why do you suppose I have you here, if not to make my time pass pleasantly?""""I think that's really what I meant, but I didn't express myself very well. And, you see, I don't yet quite know your tastes. Do you like fancy work? I know a lovely new crochet stitch I could show you.""""Yes, I do!"" cried Mrs. Van Reypen, so emphatically that Patty jumped. ""I love to see dancing! If you can do it, which I doubt, I wish you would dance for me. And this evening we'll go to see that new dancer that the town is wild over. If you really can dance, you'll appreciate it as I do. To me dancing is a fine art, and should be considered so--but it rarely is. Do you require music?""""Try it without music, first,"" was the order, and Patty walked to the other end of the long room, while Mrs. Van Reypen seated herself on a sofa. Serenely conscious of her proficiency in the art, Patty felt no embarrassment, and, swaying gently, as if listening to rhythm, she began a pretty little fancy dance that she had learned some years ago.Mrs. Van Reypen was so seated at the piano that she could watch Patty's dance, and in a moment the two were in harmony, and Patty was gliding and bowing in a charming minuet, while Mrs. Van Reypen played in perfect sympathy.""That's right,"" said Mrs. Van Reypen, as the dancing and music both came to an end; ""I am glad to see you smile as you dance. I have seen some dancers who look positively agonised as they do difficult steps.""But he didn't, and, except that she had seen him so clearly in the mirror, and he had asked her, silently but unmistakably, not to divulge the fact of his presence, she would have thought she only imagined him there in the doorway.""You dance wonderfully well,"" went on Mrs. Van Reypen. ""You have had very good training. I shall be glad to have you dance for me often. But--and please remember this--never when any one else is here. I wish you to dance for me only. If I have guests, or if my nephew is here, you are not to dance."""
"This was almost too much for Patty's gravity. For she well knew the old lady was foolishly alarmed lest her nephew should fall in love with a humble ""companion,"" and, knowing that the said nephew had gleefully watched the dance, it was difficult not to show her amusement.""Now, you may do as you like until luncheon time,"" said Mrs. Van Reypen, ""for I shall go to my room and lie down for a rest. My maid will attend me, so I will bid you adieu until one o'clock. Wander round the house if you choose. You will find much to interest you.""""Right you are!"" thought Patty to herself. ""I don't believe I'd have to wander far to find a jolly comrade to interest me!"" But she well knew if Mr. Philip Van Reypen was still in the house, and if she should encounter him and chat with him, it would greatly enrage the old lady.And sure enough, though she didn't know it, Mr. Van Reypen was watching her from behind the drawing-room draperies. His face fell as he saw her go up the stairs, and, though he waited some time, she did not return.""I mean that I am your aunt's companion, and trying to earn my living thereby. Now if you persist in secretly coming to the house,--pardon me if I am frank,--and if you persist in sending foolish notes to me, your aunt will not let me stay here, and I shall lose a good position through your unkindness.""Patty was very much in earnest, and her words were sincere, but her innate sense of humour couldn't fail to see the ridiculous side of it all, and the corners of her mouth dimpled though she kept her eyes resolutely cast down.Patty's eyes were dancing. She had come to Mrs. Van Reypen's on Thursday. She would, therefore, leave on Thursday, and she was sure that lady would have no objections to inviting her nephew to dinner after her ""companion's"" departure.""Oh, I see! You're here a week on trial, and if I am chummy with you Aunty Van won't keep you! Oh, yes! Why, of course! To be sure! Well, Miss Fairfield, I make this sacrifice for your benefit. I will keep away from here during your trial week. Then, in return, you promise to use your influence to get me an invitation to dine here next Friday.""Patty put on a smart tailored costume, and almost regretted that she had left her white furs at home. But she and Nan had agreed that they were too elaborate for her use as a companion, so she wore a small neckpiece and muff of chinchilla. But it suited well her dark-blue cloth suit and plain but chic black velvet hat.""Oh!"" began Patty, giggling, ""I've so much to tell you, and it's all so funny, I can't say a word. We're at the dressmaker's now, and I took this chance to call you up, because I won't be overheard. Oh, Nan, it's great fun!"""
"""Oh, Nan, wait a minute, for goodness' sake! Yes, she's patronising--she won't let me speak to her grand nephew. Oh--I don't mean her grand nephew! I mean her grand, gorgeous, extraordinary nephew. But I don't care; I've no desire to speak to him.""""Sure I can! Oh, she's a peach! Don't reprove my slang, Nan; I have to be so precise when I'm on duty. Well, I must say good-by now. I'll write you a long letter as soon as I get a chance. To-night we're going to see Mlle. Thingamajig dance, and to-morrow night, to the opera. So you see I'm not dull.""Patty hung up the receiver, for she knew if she talked any longer she'd get homesick. The sound of Nan's familiar voice made her long for her home and her people. But Patty was plucky, and, also, she was doggedly determined to succeed this time.Then, if Patty did this, it would bring down vials of wrath on her inoffensive head. Often she was at her wits' end to know what to say. But her sense of humour never deserted her, and if she said something, feeling sure she was going to get sorely berated for saying it, she was able to smile inwardly when the scathing retort was uttered.When Patty did so she either fell asleep and then, waking suddenly, declared that Patty had been skipping, or else she argued contrary to the doctrines expressed in the sermons and expected Patty to combat her arguments.""I'm tired of hearing you read,"" she said, at last. ""You do read abominably. First you go along in staccato jerks, then you drone in a monotone. Philip is a fine reader. I love to hear Philip read. I wish he'd come in to-day. I wonder why he doesn't? Probably because you're here. He must have taken a violent dislike to you, Miss Fairfield.""""Yes, I'm sure he did. For usually he likes my companions--especially if they're pretty. And you're pretty, Miss Fairfield. Not the type I admire myself,--I prefer brunettes,--but still you are pretty in your own way."""
"""By Jove!"" exclaimed the young man, but not aloud, ""if that isn't the prettiest sight ever. I believe there's a tradition that one may kiss a lady whom one finds asleep in her chair, but I won't. She's a dear little girl, and she shan't be teased.""Then Mr. Philip Van Reypen deliberately, and noiselessly, lifted another large armchair and, carefully disposing his own goodly proportioned frame within it, proceeded to fall asleep himself--or if not really asleep, he gave an exceedingly good imitation of it.""I shall win this time,"" she wrote, ""and, though life here is not a bed of roses, yet it is not so very bad, and when the week is over I shall look back at it with lots of funny thoughts. Oh, Nan, prepare a fatted calf for Thursday night, for I shall come home a veritable Prodigal Son! Of course, I don't mean this literally; we have lovely things to eat here, but it's 'hame, hame, fain wad I be.' I won't write again, I'll probably get no chance, but send Miller for me at four o'clock on Thursday afternoon.""After writing the letter Patty felt less homesick. It seemed, somehow, to bring Thursday nearer, to write about it. She began to dress for dinner, and, in a spirit of mischief, she took pains to make a most fetching toilette.At dinner Mrs. Van Reypen monopolised the conversation. She talked mostly to Philip, but occasionally addressed a remark to Patty. She was exceedingly polite to her, but made her feel that her share of the conversation must be formal and conventional. Then she would chatter to her nephew about matters unknown to Patty, and then perhaps again throw an observation about the weather at her ""companion.""""Aunty Van,"" said Philip, at last, giving up his attempts to make Patty converse, ""let's have a little theatre party to-morrow night. Shall us? I'll get a box, and if you and Miss Fairfield will go, I'll be delighted.""""I'll go, with pleasure,"" replied his aunt, ""but Miss Fairfield will be obliged to decline. She has been out late too often since she has been here, and she needs rest. So invite the Delafields instead, and that will make a pleasant quartette.""""Thank you, Aunty Van,"" she heard him saying, in a cool, determined voice, ""but I prefer to choose my own guests. I do not care to ask the Delafields--unless you especially desire it. I am sorry Miss Fairfield cannot go, but I trust you will honour me with your presence."" Philip had scored.It wasn't exactly pride, but Patty had been brought up in an atmosphere of somewhat old-fashioned chivalry, and it jarred on her sense of the fitness of things to have Philip's invitation to her referred to as a ""kindness.""""Of course,"" said Patty, to her own reflection in her mirror, ""a companion can't expect to sit with 'the quality,' but it does seem a shame to dress up pretty like this and then be sent to bed at nine o'clock! Never mind, only three evenings more in this house, and then victory for Patty Fairfield!""She would have liked to hold a long telephone conversation with Nan and her father, but she thought she had better not, for there were so many house servants on duty that a maid or a footman would be likely to overhear her."
"She played the piano and sang a little, then she wandered about the large and lonely rooms. Patty was a sociable creature, and had never before spent an evening entirely alone, unless when engaged in some important and engrossing work.""Oh! I meant to tell him not to tell, but I forgot it. Well, it doesn't matter much, as you chanced to strike a time when I'm alone. But don't call me up again. I'm not supposed to have any social acquaintances.""""This,"" she said, taking up a finished hat, ""is one my milliner has just sent home, and I think it a fright. Now here's a last year's hat, but the plumes are lovely. If you could untrim this first one, and transfer these plumes, and then add these roses--what do you think?""""Crying, are you!"" she exclaimed. ""If you had such a painful neck and shoulder as I have you well might cry. But to cry about nothing! Bah! Leave me, and do not return until you can be pleasant. Miss Fairfield, will you please finish putting up my hair?""Patty laid down her work, and did as she was requested. She was sorry for the maid and incensed at Mrs. Van Reypen's injustice and disagreeableness, but she felt intuitively that it was the best plan to be, herself, kind and affable.Patty was about to give a horrified exclamation when the funny side of it struck her, and she burst into laughter. Mrs. Van Reypen was really an elderly lady, and her angry surprise at being made to look like one seemed very funny to Patty.But she now realised that she had been expected to make it of even gayer effect than it had shown at first. This was an easy matter, and picking up the hat she straightened it out, and hastily catching up a bunch of pink roses and a glittering buckle, she said:But she sat down again, and Patty replaced the hat, and then adjusted the roses and the buckle, giving the whole a dainty, pretty effect, which though over-youthful, perhaps, was really very becoming to the fine-looking old lady.""Charming!"" she exclaimed, letting her recent display of bad temper go without apology. ""I felt sure you could do it. This afternoon we will go out to the shops and buy some materials, and you shall make me another hat.""And so the days dragged by. Patty had hard work to keep her own temper when her employer was unreasonably cross and snappish, but she stuck to her plan of flattering her, and it worked well more often than not."
"""Another week of this would give me nervous prostration!"" she said to herself. ""But to-morrow my week is up, and that means Success! I have really and truly succeeded in earning my own living for a week, and I'm glad and proud of it. I knew I should succeed, but I confess I didn't think I'd score so many failures first. But perhaps that makes my success all the sweeter. Anyway, I'm jolly glad I'm going home to-morrow. Wow! but I'm homesick.""She had been wondering how she should persuade Mrs. Van Reypen to let her go, and now the lady was voluntarily dismissing her! It was so sudden and so unexpected that Patty showed her surprise by her look of blank amazement.""I knew you'd feel dreadful about it,"" went on Mrs. Van Reypen, with real regret in her tone, ""but I cannot help it. You are not, by nature, fitted for the position. You are--I don't exactly know how to express it, but you are not of a subservient disposition.""""You do, Mrs. Van Reypen,"" said Patty, smiling; ""so clear that I am going to tell you the truth about this whole business. I'm not really obliged to earn my own living. I have a happy home and loving parents. My father, though not a millionaire, is wealthy and generous enough to supply all my wants, and the reason I took this position with you is a special and peculiar one, which I will tell you about if you care to hear."" After Patty had told Mrs. Van Reypen the whole story of her efforts to earn her living for a week, and why she had undertaken such a thing, she found herself occupying a changed place in that lady's regard.""Don't praise me more than I deserve,"" said Patty, smiling. ""I did begin the game with a charitable motive, but I thought it was going to be easy. When I found it difficult I fear I kept on rather from stubbornness than anything else.""""I don't call it stubbornness, Miss Fairfield; I call it commendable perseverance, and I'm glad you've told me your story. Of course, I wouldn't have wished you to tell me at first, for had I known it I wouldn't have taken you. But you have honestly tried to do your work well, and you succeeded as well as you could. But, as I told you, you are not made for that sort of thing. Your disposition is not that of a subordinate, and I am glad you do not really have to be one. You have earned your salary this week, however, and I gladly pay you the fifteen dollars we agreed upon.""Mrs. Van Reypen handed Patty the money, and as the girl took it she said, earnestly: ""As you may well believe, Mrs. Van Reypen, this money means more to me than any I have ever before received in my life. It is the first I have ever earned by my own exertions, and, unless I meet with reverses of fortune, it will probably be the last. But, more than that, it proves my success in the somewhat doubtful enterprise I undertook and it assures a chance, at least, of another girl's success in life."""
"""It is all so uncertain yet,"" Patty went on. ""I don't know exactly how we are to persuade the girl to come North at all. She is of a proud and sensitive nature that would reject anything like charity.""""Not literally, perhaps; but for the few hours that are left of your stay with me I shall look upon you as a guest, not a 'companion.' And as I always like to entertain my guests pleasantly, I shall, if you agree, telephone for Philip to come to luncheon with us.""When Philip arrived he was, of course, amazed at his aunt's demeanour. She not only seemed to approve of Miss Fairfield, but treated her as an honoured guest and seemed more than willing that Philip should chat socially with her. Soon she explained to him the cause of her sudden change of attitude.Philip laughed heartily. ""I suspected something of the sort,"" he said. ""Miss Fairfield didn't strike me as being of the 'thankful and willin' to please' variety. She tried her best, but her deference was forced and her meekness assumed.""""No,"" said Patty, laughing; ""I was born South, and I've only lived North about five years. One of those I've spent abroad, and one or two outside of New York. So when I say I'm a New York girl I only mean that I live here now.""At four o'clock Miller came for her, and when Patty saw the familiar motor-car her homesickness came back like a big wave, and with farewells, speedy though cordial, she gladly let Philip hand her into the limousine.She was talking to the reflection of herself in the small mirror opposite her face, but the happy and smiling countenance she saw there didn't tally with her remarks. ""Oh, well,"" she thought, ""I only agreed to earn my living for a week, and I've done it--I've done it!""She opened her purse to make sure the precious fifteen dollars was still there, and she looked at it proudly. She had more money than that in another part of her purse, but no bills could ever look so valuable as the ten and five Mrs. Van Reypen had paid her.""No, don't!"" implored Nan. ""I've had the most awful time the whole week! Every night Fred vowed he was going to bring you home, and I had to beg him not to. I wanted you to win,--and I felt sure you would this time,--but you owe it to me. For if I hadn't worked so hard to prevent it your father would have gone after you long ago----""""Good for you, Nan!"" cried Patty. ""You've been a trump! You've helped me through every time, in all my failures and in my one success. Oh, I've so much to tell you of my experiences! They were awfully funny."""
"""Oh, that's different! Travelling or visiting is one thing, but working for your living is quite another! Oh, _don't_ lose all your fortune, will you, father? I don't want to have to go out into the cold world and earn my own support.""""I'll never again express an opinion on matters I don't know anything about,"" declared Patty. ""Just think! I only said I thought it would be _easy_ to earn fifteen dollars a week, and look what I've been through in consequence! But I've won at last!""""It was worth spending that awful week to achieve your purpose,"" he went on, ""but I well know how hard it was for a home-loving girl like you. And I fancy it was none too easy to find yourself at the beck and call of another woman.""""It will be difficult,"" said Mr. Hepworth, ""as she is not only proud and sensitive, but very shy. I think if Mrs. Fairfield would write one of her kind and tactful letters that Miss Farley would be persuaded by it.""""Don't put it just that way,"" advised Mr. Hepworth. ""Say that you, as a friend of mine, are interested in her career. And say that if she will come to New York for a week and stay with you, you think you can help her make arrangements for a course in the Art School. Your own tact will dress up the idea so as to make it palatable to her pride.""""Yes, you are,"" agreed Mr. Hepworth, as he joined in the general laughter. ""But that 'suddenness' of yours is a quality that I wish Miss Farley possessed. It is really a sort of brave impulse and quick determination that makes you dash into danger or enterprise of any kind.""""I think so, too,"" said Mr. Hepworth, heartily. ""And I congratulate you on your plucky perseverance and your indomitable will. You put up a brave fight, and you won. I know how you suffered under that petty tyranny, and your success in such circumstances was a triumph!""""Thank you,"" said Patty, greatly pleased at this sincere praise from one whom she so greatly respected. ""It would have been harder still if I hadn't had a good sense of humour. Lots of times when I wanted to cry I laughed instead."" With her usual tact and cleverness, Nan managed the whole matter successfully. She wrote to the friends of Mr. Hepworth in the South who were interested in Miss Farley, and they persuaded the girl to go North for a week and see if she could see her way clear to staying there.Patty and Nan made ready for her with great care and kindness. A guest room was specially prepared for her use, and Patty adorned it with some of her own pet pictures, a few good casts, and certain bits of bric-à-brac that she thought would appeal to an ""art student."""
"""Oh, Christine Farley isn't that sort,"" declared Patty. ""I don't believe she wears her hair tumbling down and a Byron collar with a big, black ribbon bow at her throat. I used to see that sort copying in the art galleries in Paris, and they _are_ hopeless. But I imagine Miss Farley is a tidy little thing and her genius is too real for those near-art effects.""To put her more at her ease Patty had led her at once upstairs, and now the presence of only warm-hearted Patty and the view of the welcoming room made her forget her embarrassment and seem more like her natural self.""Of course you are,"" said Patty, cheerily. ""Don't bother about thanks. And don't feel shy. Let's pretend we've known each other for years--long enough to use first names. May I take your hat off, Christine?""""Now, Nan,"" began Patty, smiling, ""that's the wrong tone. We're going to make this girlie feel homelike and comfortable and omit all formality. We're going to call her by her first name, and we're going to treat her as one of ourselves. Now you just revise that little speech of 'We dine at seven, Miss Farley.'""""Lovely!"" cried Patty. ""Oh, you're an artist, all right! Dress your hair low--in a soft coil; but of course you know how to do that. I'll send Louise to hook you up, and I'll come back for you when I'm dressed. Good-by for now.""""But I'll learn it,"" she thought, with a determination which she had rarely felt and scarce knew she possessed. Her nature was one that needed a spur or help from another, and then she was ready to do her part, too.""Yes,"" she said to herself, as she deftly dressed her hair in front of the mirror, ""I'll conquer this silly timidity if it kills me! I'll take Patty Fairfield for a model, and I'll acquire that very same ease and grace that she has.""""Chattery,"" indeed! Her tongue seemed paralysed, her very neck felt strained and stiff, and she stumbled over the rug in her effort to stop trembling. In her own room, alone with Patty and Nan, she had overcome this, but now, in the brilliantly lighted drawing-room and the presence of other people, the terrible timidity returned, and Christine made a most unsuccessful entrance.Nan, who was watching her, though unobserved, led the conversation around to subjects in which Christine might be likely to be interested, and was rewarded at last by seeing the girl's face light up with an enjoyment unmarred by self-consciousness.Christine had grown almost gay in her chatter, when Kenneth was announced. Like a sensitive plant at a human touch, she lost all her poise, her face turned white, and her lips quivered as she braced herself for the ordeal of meeting a stranger."
"But Nan appreciated more truly the real state of the case, and knew that Christine had borne just about all she could, and that owing to physical fatigue and mental strain her nerves were just about ready to give way.""How do you do, Kenneth?"" said Nan, airily. ""Too bad you didn't come earlier. I am just taking our little guest away from this admiring crowd, who are tiring her all out with their admiration. She may just say 'howdy' to you, and then I'm going to carry her off. Miss Farley, this is our Kenneth--Mr. Harper.""""Nonsense!"" replied Nan, cheerily. ""You weren't horrid a bit. You looked lovely and behaved like a little lady. Your nerves are overwrought, and I don't wonder. Just tumble into bed, dearie, and forget everything in all the world, except that you're among warm friends.""""Of course you don't,"" declared Kenneth, who loved to take Patty's part against Mr. Hepworth. ""Why, you wouldn't be 'Our Patty' if you used only dictionary English. All the slang Miss Farley gets from you will do her good rather than harm. She needs it in her make-up.""And as more days went by the girl improved greatly in demeanour and bearing, and lost, to a great degree, her look of startled fear and painful self-consciousness. Of course this was not accomplished completely, or all at once, but helped by the kind gentleness of Nan and affectionate chaffing of Patty, Christine grew more accustomed to the pleasant social atmosphere into which she had been so suddenly thrown.They visited picture galleries and went to the shops, and went driving and motoring, and though Christine could not be persuaded to go to afternoon teas, or to formal luncheons, yet she enjoyed the pleasures she had and grew every day more at her ease in society.Her own determination helped her greatly. She purposed to yet become as unaffected and un-self-conscious as Patty, and, though she knew she could never acquire Patty's inborn gaiety of spirit, she resolved to come as near to it as she could with her naturally quiet disposition.""I've already learned,"" she said, ""that I have some talent and that I need the instruction and experience that I can get here and cannot get at home. When I once make up my mind to a thing I spare no effort to achieve it, and now I'm determined to get an art education by some manner or means!""""Hooray for you!"" cried Patty, for Christine's cheeks glowed and her eyes sparkled with the force of her speech. ""That's the way to talk! Christine, you do me proud! Now, go on; what have you in mind? Tell your Aunt Patty all about it."""
"""I want to stay in New York for a year, at least. I'm afraid of it--desperately so. The very sound of the traffic scares me out of my wits. But I'm going to conquer that, and I'm going to conquer my shyness and timidity and all the foolish things that stand in my way.""""Wait a bit, Patty. That's all very well so far as determination and will are concerned. And I can do it. My will is strong, and I know I'm started now on the right track. But--there are many hard facts to face. There's a sordid side to the question that can't be solved by will-power and determination. Mr. Hepworth thinks I can get a scholarship practically without cost; but, in addition to that, I have to pay my board, you know, and I have very little money. My dear old father can send me a small allowance, but we are a large family, and he is not rich. So I want to know if you think I could earn enough by some work outside my classes to pay my board--say, about fifteen dollars a week. Do you?""She was sitting on a couch, and she put her head down into a big, soft pillow, and shook with laughter. Did _she_ think a girl could earn fifteen dollars a week? _Did_ she, indeed? With a strange sound between a gurgle and a choke, she ran out of the room.""Christine,"" she said, gently, ""listen to me. We Fairfields and Mr. Hepworth all take an interest in you and in your career. We all feel sure you will yet be a great artist. Of course, our belief is founded on Mr. Hepworth's assertions, but we know he is capable of judging. Now you must have that year of study, and by that time Mr. Hepworth feels sure you can earn quite a lot of money by illustrating, and whatever he thinks goes!""""Well, you see,"" went on Patty, suddenly deciding that the plain, outspoken facts were best, ""father has offered to pay your board for a year at some nice, pleasant boarding-house, and----Mercy! _What's_ the matter?""""Oh, no!"" cried the other. ""Why, Patty, it isn't charity; it's great, big, splendid kindness, and it's just a loan, you understand. I can pay it back in a couple of years after I once begin to earn money. Patty, you don't know how sure I am of my own ability now that I understand my limitations. I can't explain it, but I see success ahead as surely as I see the blue sky out of that window!"""
