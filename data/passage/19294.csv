passage
"""I'll answer any and everything if you will only get ready. Oh, have you got to go upstairs? Hurry then,"" and Mollie swung her feet impatiently as Grace detached herself from the great chair slowly and gracefully and started out into the hall.""Oh, all right, if you will only hurry,"" cried Mollie in desperation, and jumping from her chair she propelled her friend in most undignified haste up the broad stairway--Grace protesting at every step.""Now listen here, young lady,"" she said, looking sternly down into her friend's laughing eyes. ""It's my turn to talk. I refuse to budge another step until you have explained, to my perfect satisfaction, the cause of all this rush.""""Uh-huh,"" said Mollie, and so she was released. ""There isn't much to tell anyway,"" she went on. ""Betty and I met Frank Haley and Will a few minutes ago and Frank happened to remark that it was a splendid day for an auto ride. We agreed with him--that's all.""""Oh, she's coming, just as soon as she lets her mother know where she's off to. We wanted Amy to go along too--stopped in there on the way down--but Mrs. Stonington isn't feeling well and Amy thought she ought to stay with her.""""Hello, girls, we'd have been here sooner if Betty hadn't delayed us."" It was Frank Haley who spoke, a handsome young fellow, whose merry grey eyes showed that he deserved his name--the first part of it, at least. ""Come, 'fess up, Betty,"" he added, turning to the bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked girl beside him.""Oh, well, it was wonderful--in more ways than one,"" this last so low that only Will heard it, as Grace squeezed his hand under cover of the robe. You see, Will was her brother, and they were very fond of each other, as well they might be.""Your car runs like a dream, Frank,"" Betty was saying as they reached the top. ""Look at that great big haystack down there--it must have taken some time to gather it in. Why don't you slow down a little? Don't you think--oh, what is it, Frank?"" for she had noticed the set lines of his mouth and the look of terror that had flashed into his eyes. ""Oh, Frank!"" she cried again. To those who are already acquainted with the Outdoor Girls, no explanations are necessary, but for the benefit of my new readers I will take advantage of this moment to make them better acquainted with the characters and setting of the story.In the first book of this series, called ""The Outdoor Girls of Deepdale,"" the girls, Betty Nelson, sometimes called the Little Captain, because of her fearless leadership, Mollie Billette, Grace Ford and Amy Blackford, had gone on their famous walking tour, and during their wanderings had solved the mystery of a five-hundred-dollar bill.The second volume, ""The Outdoor Girls at Rainbow Lake,"" tells of a summer full of interest and adventure during which the horse Grace was riding ran away with her. This misfortune led to the loss of some very valuable papers, with a subsequent strange happening on an island, about which, and the recovery of the papers, you may read, dear reader, if you will.""The Outdoor Girls in a Motor Car"" is the third book of the series. Yes, there really was a house where all sorts of weird sights and sounds might be seen and heard at night if one had the courage to stay around. And you may imagine the consternation of the Outdoor Girls when Mollie was captured by the ""ghost."""
"At the end of a delightful summer, spent in touring the country in Mollie's car, the girls had a wonderful chance to spend the winter in the woods. Needless to say, they took advantage of the opportunity. The fourth book, ""The Outdoor Girls in a Winter Camp,"" describes the settlement of a certain property dispute, involving Mr. Ford. The happy result was made possible by the good fortune that favors our girls. This volume tells also how Amy was claimed by a brother, of whose existence she was unaware.Then followed their adventures in Florida during which the girls had succeeded in finding Will Ford, Grace's brother, who had been virtually kidnapped by a villainous labor contractor and had been set to work in a turpentine camp. The fifth volume, entitled ""The Outdoor Girls in Florida; or, Wintering in the Sunny South,"" tells of many other adventures the girls had during their winter among the ""orange blossoms,"" but now it was over, and Deepdale, which they had left covered deep with snow, had begun once more to stir with life beneath the gentle touch of spring.In the sixth book, ""The Outdoor Girls at Ocean View,"" the girls have many good times and stirring adventures. The discovery of a box, containing veritable riches in diamonds, led to the kidnapping of Betty and Amy and their subsequent rescue.On, on, they went with ever-increasing speed, while Frank tried desperately to jam the useless brake--but to no effect! The car was like a horse with the bit between its teeth, plunging madly to destruction.Will and Frank shook the hay from their own eyes and then went to the rescue of the girls. Then they stared at each other. Gradually the look of utter bewilderment faded from their faces and a smile flashed from one to the other like a ray of sunshine.""You get disappointed,"" Frank finished with a rueful smile. ""Just the same, it's lucky for us that big haystack was just exactly where it is,"" he added. ""When I hit the rock I sure thought we were all goners.""That was Betty all over--bright, generous, fun-loving, the acknowledged leader of the girls. Grace was tall, graceful, slender, with a pretty face framed in a wealth of bright hair. She was accustomed to take life more easily than Betty and, although not a coward in the true sense of the word, she was always willing to have the other girls go first. Then there was Mollie, dark eyed and quick tempered, with more than a touch of the French in her, but Betty's equal in bravery. The last of the little quartette was Amy Blackford (formerly called Amy Stonington), who has not yet appeared in this book. Up to a year before she had been surrounded by a mystery which would have held great interest for the girls even had they not loved and admired her for her own good qualities.""Oh, I was going to Amy's first, to find out how Mrs. Stonington is,"" said Betty as she turned back. ""Then I was going to stop in to see if you would go with me to call on Grace. I promised her last night I would come over this morning.""The Little Captain seated herself comfortably on the board step of the veranda. ""Yes she will,"" she said decidedly. ""I told her yesterday that if I came over this morning and found her in bed eating candy before breakfast instead of enjoying the wonderful morning air, I'd never come over again. She knows that I mean it, too."""
"As the three chums, clad daintily in white, with a background of velvety green lawn to set them off, approached the Fords' beautiful home, they were surprised beyond measure to see Grace swinging leisurely back and forth in the big hammock under the trees. They stopped short and gazed upon this spectacle.""I wish you would stop gazing at me like that,"" said Grace, raising her head and looking at the three girls who were still regarding her fixedly. ""Is it my hair, or is my nose red, or is it my skirt that's too tight? Please tell me and get it over with. I can stand anything but this suspense.""""Amy, you're the only sane one in that crowd,"" cried Grace in desperation. ""Will you kindly explain what those two lunatics are talking about--if they know themselves!"" This last was uttered so vindictively that the girls came down from rhetorical heights with a bounce.""Now, please, girls,"" said Betty, fearing a storm, ""don't let's quarrel, whatever we do. We were only surprised to see you up so early, Grace, that's all. But now I'm mighty glad you are, because we'll have a chance for a nice long talk. What time do you suppose it is now?""""It was nearly ten when I came out of the house,"" Grace replied, placated by the Little Captain's tactful changing of the subject. ""Can't you all stay to lunch? Then we can make a good long day of it.""""Are you doing anything particular this afternoon?"" he wanted to know, and upon the girls replying in the negative, asked if he might bring some of the other boys around. ""We have made a discovery!"" he shouted after them. ""We'll tell you about it when we see you.""They had not long to wait--in fact they had barely had time to settle themselves in the comfortable chairs, when along the road came--not the boys, but a ragged, bent, old woman, leaning heavily on a twisted stick for support. Instead of going straight on, as the girls had expected she would do, the old woman turned in at the drive and made straight for them.As the old hag drew nearer, the girls instinctively shrank back in their chairs. And, indeed, she was not a prepossessing figure. Her head was bound about with an old red handkerchief, tied under the wrinkled chin and framing a face seamed and crisscrossed with a million wrinkles. An old, tattered shawl covered her bent shoulders, and the hand that grasped the knotted stick was claw-like and emaciated. Her eyes were the only part of her that seemed to retain some semblance of youth. They were little and beady and exceedingly keen, so that when she raised them to Betty's young face, that staunch little captain felt that she would almost rather be anywhere else than there beneath the trees with the searching eyes of the old crone fixed upon her.""I won't hurt you, pretty ladies,"" said the old woman, divining their repugnance and half-fear and desiring to placate them. ""Won't you have your fortunes told? Only twenty-five cents, and I can tell you of your past and as much as you will of your future. Only a quarter, pretty ladies."""
"""Some other day may be too late,"" said the old crone, leeringly. ""Oh, yes, you will have all the time there is to be miserable in. And you will be! You will be! The curse be on you for refusing an old woman like me the price of her bread!"" and she hobbled down the long drive muttering to herself and stopping once to shake her fist at the startled girls.""Oh, I've never been so glad to see anybody in all my life!"" said Grace with a little shiver, as the boys paused to gaze after the retreating form of the old hag. ""It is such a relief to have some boys around!""""Yes, what did you do to her, Betty?"" It was Allen Washburn who asked the question. He was a young lawyer, liked and admired by every one in Deepdale, and let it be said here that Betty was no exception to the general rule. And as for young Allen Washburn himself, he never sought to conceal his genuine admiration for the Little Captain. ""The last I saw of her, she was shaking her fist at the house. She didn't seem to be in any too sweet a temper, either.""""Yes, she did. She told you everything, only you don't know it,"" was Will's enigmatic comment. ""You see,"" he went on, ""there's a gypsy encampment near by and we thought you girls might like to visit it. The caravans they use and the strange costumes are all mighty interesting.""""Well, I wouldn't if they were all like this,"" answered Grace. ""But they're not, are they, Roy? There are lots and lots of really romantic-looking ones if all the books I've read know anything about it.""""Of course there are. You don't suppose we'd take you to see a lot of old crones like this peppery woman, do you?"" Roy answered. ""Why, I've heard there are some mighty good-looking girls in this crowd.""""Here come some of the others,"" Betty cried out. ""I can't quite make them out, but it looks like Roy and Amy and--yes--there's Allen, too. But who is the other girl? It certainly isn't Mollie. I know her walk too well."""
"But to the Little Captain, as she watched the quartette approaching, there seemed no plausible explanation. Why should Allen be paired off with ""this Jallow girl""? Betty knew very little of the latter except that she was always trying to get in where she was not wanted. Well, she certainly was not wanted now. Oh, why did Allen look so happy? If ""this Jallow girl"" had her, Betty's, escort, where did she come in? Hot tears of anger and mortification rose to her eyes, but she drove them back mercilessly and her greeting to the newcomers was as merry as ever.""And here I am,"" said Alice effusively. ""I do hope I'm not putting any one out. The idea of visiting the gypsy camp was so fascinating that I simply couldn't resist the temptation. I think you might have let me in on it in the first place,"" and she looked reproachfully at Allen.That young gentleman had been sending imploring looks in Betty's direction over Alice Jallow's head, which the former had chosen absolutely to ignore. Now, being thus appealed to, he smiled down at Alice.""Betty, this is a friend of mine, Jack Sanford,"" Frank introduced him in his own pleasant way. ""He's not such a bad chap when you get to know him well,"" he added, while his friend thanked him, ironically.Betty acknowledged the introduction gaily. If Allen liked ""this Jallow girl,"" why, he could, that was all! and she was not going to let them spoil the evening for her. Besides, here was one providentially sent, or so it seemed to her. And he was nice, too, very nice! He seemed to be hail-fellow-well-met with the boys. And the girls--well, one could see that they liked him from the start. But if only Allen would not look so happy!It really was the camp. The young people drew closer together as they neared it, fascinated, yet half afraid. There were huge bulky objects in the background beyond the illuminated circle of firelight.The girls' eyes grew wider and wider as they advanced toward the circle of flickering firelight. It seemed they were not the gypsies' only visitors, for there were many residents of Deepdale, some of whom the girls recognized.The roving folk had set forth their wares upon rudely constructed tables, ready for the first purchaser. Some of the things were truly beautiful--pieces of rare old lace, chains and chains of many-colored beads, silver that was polished till it reflected dazzlingly the dancing firelight. There were rude tents set aside for the telling of fortunes, and somewhere further back in the camp the wild, sweet strains of a violin mingled with a man's sweet tenor voice."
"Just as they had about made up their minds that it was time to go home, Betty, who had exclaimed more than once over the beauty of some of the young gypsy girls, their beauty being emphasized by the picturesque clothes they wore, stepped back to look into a tent they had passed a moment before.""But it isn't half as bad as what happened to us,"" she said, sinking into a porch chair and fanning herself violently, being overcome either by the heat or her emotions--possibly both. ""Why! dad's running around the house like a mad man this morning, swearing all sorts of vengeance on the thief, whoever he or she is--I suppose it must be a he, though, because women don't steal----""""Well, I was going to tell you if you'd only have a little patience,"" Grace continued, in an injured voice. Here she paused to put into her mouth a chocolate cream, which she had taken from a little box she had brought with her. Then, seeing Amy about to speak, she went on hastily, holding the box out mutely toward her friends, who all shook their heads. ""Here I rush all the way over and get all heated up and everything----""At this dire threat Grace continued quickly. ""Oh, well,"" she capitulated, ""since you are in such a hurry--well, the fact is, Betty, Beauty's been stolen,"" and she delivered the terrible news in a hushed voice.""Well, I don't see what else could have happened to him."" Now that she had delivered her news, Grace was once more as calm and composed as ever. ""The horse couldn't very well file the padlock from the outside or climb out the window, and the groom wouldn't be very likely to take him for a gentle stroll in the middle of the night. And unless one of those things has happened, Beauty has been stolen. Anyway, he's gone, there's no doubt of that.""""Yes, ever since the store was robbed the other night, dad has been suspicious of them,"" Grace answered. ""He has tried to watch his horses with especial care, too. That's one thing that makes him so tearing mad to-day. Oh, you should have heard him!"" and Grace sighed at the memory.""I remember,"" said Betty thoughtfully, ""that Allen said something the other night when we went to visit their camp about the gypsies being expert thieves. From the way things have turned out I guess he knew what he was talking about.""This conversation took place between the girls on a certain morning several days after their memorable visit to the gypsy camp. A day or so before one of the large stores of the town had been looted and practically cleaned out. For two days Deepdale had been in a furore of excitement and indignation, for in the memory of most of the inhabitants no such crime had ever been perpetrated. There had been small robberies, of course, but that Hendall's, traditionally the oldest store in Deepdale, should have been treated to such insult, and by a band of roving gypsies, too--for every one suspected them from the first--why, it was unheard of! incredible!Detectives and sheriff had searched the town from end to end but had found no sign of the missing goods. They had visited the gypsy camp, too, submitting it to a strict investigation, but with no result. The countryside had been scoured for miles around, but no trace had as yet been found of the missing criminals nor of their loot. Indeed, the thieves had covered their tracks well, and the inhabitants of Deepdale were beginning to lose hope of immediate reparation."
"Such was the chaotic state of affairs on this beautiful summer morning when Mr. Ford had awakened to find his splendid horse, Beauty, the ornament of his stables and the pride of his heart, strangely and inexplicably missing.For an hour or so the girls pondered on these two mysterious robberies and found themselves not one whit nearer the solution. It was Mollie who finally suggested that they go to her house and look at a couple of new dresses she had bought recently. ""It will help get our minds off the robbery,"" she said.The girls agreed readily, for they were always anxious to see Mollie's things. ""They are always so novel,"" Grace had once said, and Mollie had been uncertain whether to ticket it a compliment or otherwise.""You may be sure he is doing his best,"" Grace retorted with spirit. ""Those gypsies make thieving their profession and it isn't always as easy to track them as it seems. If you don't believe me, just try it yourself.""""Girls, some day, I am just going to get terribly angry about something and then let fly,"" Betty broke in. ""I'd just like to know what would happen and where we would end up if you didn't have me to act as peacemaker.""""Oh, hurry, please do hurry, Mollie!"" A small cyclone precipitated itself out of the house and into Mollie's arms. ""Muvver's cwyin' tuwible and she's telephonin' to evwybody to make you come home quick. Oh--oh----"" This was the beginning of a muffled wail--silenced by Mollie's hand over the small one's mouth.The girls followed hesitatingly, as Mollie rushed forward and threw her arms about her mother's neck, crying: ""Mother, dear, what is it? Dora says you have been crying and that you have been telephoning for me all over. Oh, I wish I had known! We would have run all the way.""""Oh, I suppose a few moments more or less would make no difference. It wouldn't bring back the silver,"" said Mrs. Billette, quietly. Hysterics had given place to a sort of despairing resignation. ""Only, at first, I felt as if I must talk to some one about it. The twins didn't understand, of course, and I couldn't very well talk to Jane.""""That is just what has happened to us,"" said Mrs. Billette, as the girls stared incredulously. ""We've been robbed of some things that money never can replace. Oh-oh-oh, if I had only put it in a safer place! How could I have been such a fool! Oh! oh!"" and Mrs. Billette, poor woman, was fast verging on another attack of hysteria."
"This conversation took place in the morning. Promptly at eight that evening the door bell rang and Betty, after a last peep in the mirror and a finishing pat to her dress, flew down to answer the summons.""Right on the dot, Allen,"" she laughed, flinging the door wide open. ""The clock is just striking the hour--listen,"" and obediently he listened, his eyes on Betty's face, while the sweet chimes filled the hall with melody.She laughed gaily. ""You would have had to spend your time in the library if you _had_ come early,"" she said. ""Because I have been ready for only half a minute. Here's your hat, Allen,"" she added, taking it down from the peg where he had just deposited it for the evening. Her manner was grave but mischief sparkled in her eyes.""What's the big idea?"" he inquired, regarding the hat held out to him with a puzzled expression. ""I am very well acquainted with the article in your hand. Too well acquainted, in fact, for this is the second season we have been chums; and I see prospect of a third, if the law business doesn't pick up. But, seriously, what is the idea, Betty? Do you want me to go home and spend a dismal evening all by myself--is that it?""Opening Allen's hand, she placed the unwelcome hat therein and closed his fingers over it. ""The explanation for all this,"" she went on, making him a curtsy, ""is very simple. We have been invited to spend the evening at Mollie's.""""Oh, bother M----"" he began, then added, decidedly: ""I came to see you to-night and I am not going to the Billettes' or anywhere else! Here, hat, get back where you belong,"" and he flung the offending article back on the hook with an air of finality that matched his words.""Please don't be an old bear,"" coaxed Betty, and Betty knew how to coax to perfection. ""Mollie has some perfectly wonderful news to tell us and all our girls and boys are going to be there to hear it. You wouldn't want me to be terribly disappointed--now you know you wouldn't,"" and she looked at him appealingly.""Well, if we are the last, everybody must have turned over a new leaf just for to-night,"" remarked Betty, as she started for the library from which came a confused murmur of many voices, speaking all at once, with now and then a burst of merry laughter.""Not a chance in the world, Frank,"" said Allen, who had come into the room in time to hear the last remark. ""I might be afflicted with loss of memory; but, Betty--never!"" They all laughed with enjoyment--all but Betty who threw him a reproachful glance which he refused to catch.""I'll begin all over again,"" said Mollie. ""You all know, with the exception of Amy and Allen, and they soon will, that I have been expecting to hear from my aunt and uncle every day. They took rather a long time to make up their minds, but now everything is settled. They are really going to Europe, and we girls are going to have the use of their bungalow, 'The Shadows,' for the summer. Or at least for the month and a half that is left."""
"""Well, I hope we shall,"" Mollie continued. ""The bungalow is on an island called Pine Island in Lake Tarracusio. They say it is a beautiful place, and it is only about a day's journey in an auto. We could make it easily.""""Hard luck, old man,"" said Will, feelingly. ""I am in the same boat. But you girls had better look out,"" he added threateningly. ""Don't forget that I had something to suggest to-night and if you don't treat me better, I'll----""""Will this do,"" interrupted Mollie, and, with hands clasped in prayerful attitude, she besought Will, with tears in her voice, to have pity. ""Oh, kind and noble sir,"" she said, ""be kind--be gracious to us, your humble slaves, and deign to honor----""""Thank you,"" said Will, bowing gravely in Allen's direction. ""As our friend says, I will proceed. Well, to come down to brass tacks,"" he continued, dropping the air of dignity, which, considering his youthful appearance, was always very comical, ""I thought maybe you fellows would like to put up a tent on the same island and camp there near the girls for the rest of the summer. We could have no end of fun.""There was a yell of joy from the boys, and the excited exclamations, questions and answers that followed showed that they agreed heartily with Will in his last prophecy that ""they would have no end of fun.""""Oh, won't it be great!"" cried Betty, her cheeks flushed with excitement. ""I do believe this is the very best of all,"" then her face clouded as she turned to Allen, who had not been taking a very active part in the conversation.""I have been thinking of that, and I am sure I know just the one,"" said Amy quietly; and they turned to her in amazement. Amy was like that, she didn't talk much, but when she did, what she said was usually to the point. ""You all know young Mrs. Irving whose husband travels?"" ""Grace, Grace, do wake up!"" Betty looked at her sleeping chum in absolute amazement. How could anybody sleep so soundly on this, the day of days, when one should have been awake at six o'clock thinking over the delights in store!Grace had come over the night before to talk over some minor details of the outing, bringing with her a new and, she declared, a specially delicious brand of chocolates. It had been so late when she had started to leave that she had been prevailed upon to spend the night with Betty. And so it was that on that eventful morning she lay slumbering peacefully in the Little Captain's bed, defying all that impatient young person's efforts to rouse her.Grace groaned dismally. ""Oh, Betty, I will have to have some more sleep,"" she wailed, pitifully. ""If I don't I won't be fit for a thing the rest of the day. Don't you suppose we could make it if we started by nine?"" she added hopefully."
"""Grace Ford, of all the----"" she almost stuttered. Then, as a thought flashed before her mind she laughed delightedly. ""Can't you see them, Grace,"" she chuckled, putting on one shoe and picking up the other. ""Can't you see the boys when I tell them they will have to walk around the block while Grace gets her beauty sleep. Oh! oh!"" and even Grace had to laugh at the picture.""They probably wouldn't wait anyway,"" Betty continued, with the tact of a diplomat. ""They would go on to The Shadows and let you follow later at your leisure. It will be a nice, dusty, hot ride in the train, too,"" she added, examining the lace on her handkerchief with the air of a connoisseur.Grace sat up on the edge of the bed and regarded her chum reproachfully. ""Nobody has any heart at all, and you least of all, Betty Nelson,"" she complained. ""Oh, where did I put my slippers? I was so excited last night I don't remember what I did with them,"" and she began a listless search under the bed.""They are over by that chair,"" said Betty patiently. Then went on: ""Oh, Grace, dear, please wake up. You will give me the blues if you don't shake off that dead and alive air. Imagine Betty Nelson with the blues to-day.""""It _is_ rather impossible,"" remarked Grace, regarding Betty's flushed cheeks and dancing eyes with admiration. ""I wish I didn't need any more sleep than you, Betty. Oh, well, the worst part of getting up is over now and I'll feel fine when I get some breakfast. You just watch me.""""Well, that is the very first time I have ever been accused of stopping a clock,"" said Grace with dignity. Then added plaintively: ""And by my best friend, too! Oh, well, I suppose you can get used to anything if you try hard enough.""""Oh, Grace, you're a dear when you look resigned like that,"" said Betty, dancing over to her friend and hugging her ecstatically. ""If you weren't so pretty, I wouldn't dare talk about stopping clocks,"" she added, and peace was restored, and soon both hurried down to breakfast.""You _are_ a dear,"" said Betty, for the second time this morning. ""Goodness, they are making enough noise with their old horns. Anybody would think there were ten automobiles instead of two,"" and while she ran out to greet the newcomers, Grace hurried--yes, actually _hurried_--up the stairs to get the small bags they were to take with them for immediate use, in case the trunks, which had been sent on before, did not arrive in time."
"Betty found the others all radiant. Roy was at the wheel in Mollie's car--she had invited him to act as chauffeur and he had gleefully accepted--with Mollie herself beside him and Will and Amy in the tonneau.""I did--after considerable persuasion,"" laughed Betty. ""I came out to tell you we just have to get our outside things on and we shall be ready. I can see Grace beckoning now--just a minute,"" and she ran toward the house.The boys had tumbled out of the automobile and were racing up the drive as if their lives depended on their reaching the porch at the same second. The girls adjusted their pretty panamas before the wide mirror while the boys picked up the bags and waited.""I wonder where the dear old chappie is, anyway,"" remarked Allen as he took his seat between Betty and Mrs. Irving in the tonneau. Grace was to sit with Frank. ""I haven't seen him about town lately. I wonder if mother has taken her darling boy to the seashore,"" he added, as the car moved off.""It is rather hard to imagine the immaculate Percy in those surroundings,"" drawled Grace. ""He would be running down to the river to wash his hands every two minutes. How do we get over to the island from the mainland, Betty, do you remember?"" she added. ""I know Mollie said something about a steamer, but I didn't get a very good idea of it.""""Oh, we will have lots of fun on it,"" Betty answered, enjoying the prospect immensely. ""Mollie says it is an old, rickety thing that looks as if it were going to pieces any minute. She thinks it must be at least two hundred years old, if what her aunt says is true. It will be awfully interesting.""""Yes, especially if it fulfills its promise and goes to pieces in the middle of the lake,"" Grace remarked dryly. ""I wouldn't mind the dip in weather like this, but I would rather choose the time and place.""""I wouldn't call that the worst thing that could happen to us,"" said Allen; and when the girls looked to him for an explanation he added: ""It would be no end of fun to be dumped in the river with a boatful of pretty girls. Think of the good time we could have rescuing you.""""Well, maybe you call that fun, but I should say it was pretty hard work,"" said Frank, ungallantly. ""Especially if the girls should lose their heads and begin to choke you. All hail, for Davy Jones' locker!""""Well, we shall have a chance to settle all disputes when we get to Pine Island,"" said Allen. ""To change the subject--has anybody noticed that the sun has gone under a cloud and that there is a stiff little breeze coming up? I shouldn't wonder if we were in for a storm."""
"""Yes, we may need our bathing suits even before we get to the island,"" said Betty, ruefully. ""I hope you didn't forget to bring your suit, Mrs. Irving,"" she added, turning to the chaperon, who had been singularly silent during the ride. Perhaps she was realizing for the first time the great responsibility she had taken upon herself. However, she spoke now, accompanying her words with a bright smile.""I am very much afraid we won't leave to wait till we get there,"" said Frank, regarding the sky anxiously. ""Unless I am a pretty poor prophet we are in for a considerable spell of bad weather. What do you say, Allen?"" The girls and boys stared at each other, dismay written on their faces. The road closed and the rain pouring down in torrents--a nice predicament! It was Mrs. Irving's calm voice which first broke the silence.""Oh, of course we shall be able to strike the main part of the road again if we go a couple of miles out of our way,"" Frank agreed, a worried frown on his forehead. ""The only question is, how are we going to find our way? I didn't bring a chart with me--worse luck.""""Well, if he has this particular species of junk it will come in mighty handy just now,"" said Frank, hopefully. ""I'll stick my head out and yell at him. Gee, it sure is raining some!"" and he craned his neck toward the other car, squinting his eyes to keep out the stinging drops. ""Hey, Roy!"" he shouted. ""Do you happen to have anything like a map of the surrounding country in your inside vest pocket? If you have, throw it over. We are stuck good and plenty.""Frank drew in his head and mopped his face and hair with a huge silk handkerchief. ""Two minutes before the next plunge,"" he announced to the amused occupants of his car. ""Allen, if he doesn't get me this time you will have to change places with me. I'll be almost drowned,"" then he thrust his head out once more and shouted in the direction of Mollie's car.""I don't believe any of us expect to,"" said Allen, dryly. ""What do you say we take that side road we passed a little way back, Frank? We can at least see where it leads and we can inquire our way as we go along.""""Perhaps it would be better if we hurried a little,"" Mrs. Irving suggested, when they had had their laugh out. ""With no delay it would take us almost till sundown to reach The Shadows and I don't want to be too late."""
"For answer, Frank threw in the clutch, and the big machine very slowly and painfully plowed its way through the clinging mud of the road and turned its face toward the crossroads and, in all probability, Mollie's runaway car.""Well, if that's all you want,"" sang Betty, cheerily, ""just look at Grace and Mrs. Irving and Allen and me. I, for my part, am having the time of my life. And look, everybody,"" she added, ""it isn't raining nearly so hard as it was. We will be seeing the sun next!""Five minutes later the cars started on again, with the breeze fanning the faces of the occupants and the sun pouring down goldenly upon them. As Frank had said, ""The world was a different place to live in.""""Did you see that gypsy girl who just passed in front of us?"" Mollie whispered when they had done as they were desired. Then, as the girls nodded assent, she continued excitedly: ""Well, I am almost sure she had on that jet necklace that disappeared with mother's silver! Oh, if we could only follow the girl we might find that too! Oh, can't we--can't we?"" she added, fairly dancing with excitement.""Isn't it lovely?"" cried Mollie delightedly. ""It looks just like the little colored pictures of towns they have in the magazines sometimes. The same quaint little frame houses with green shutters and well-kept lawns in front----""""Girls,"" said Betty, jumping up from the overturned suitcase she was using for a seat, and speaking impressively, ""I have a feeling----"" here she paused for effect. ""I have a feeling,"" she continued, ""that we are going to have a good time.""""Get off the luggage, you girls!"" Will commanded, good-naturedly. ""The man in there says we have just exactly five minutes to catch that joke steamer for the island, and if he is right, we've got to hustle. Sling over that bag, Sis, will you?""""By running like the very wind,"" Frank declared, and, picking up two suitcases in one hand, he propelled Grace down the street with the other. ""Please hurry,"" he urged. ""Never mind about your hats, girls. It will soon be so dark nobody will be able to see them.""Off they raced, light and graceful and buoyantly alive. It was no task at all to overtake Roy, who was hampered by gasping little Mrs. Irving--who, although young, was not--_so_ young. Next came Amy and Will, running easily, but Allen and Betty passed them as if they had been standing still."
"""There's the little steamer now, Allen!"" gasped Betty. ""Oh, do you think it will go without us?"" As if for answer the whistle on the curious old ferry shrieked a warning to all would-be voyagers to Pine Island.Betty nodded her head, for just then breath was precious and not to be wasted in idle words. Silently, the two called on their splendid reserve strength, while arm in arm they sped along the shore to the dock. They reached it just in the nick of time.""So this is the steamer!"" said Grace, as soon as she could find breath enough to speak at all. ""It does justify your aunt's description, Mollie, although it doesn't look quite so rickety as I expected.""""I don't see why ride isn't just as appropriate as sail in this case,"" said Will, sitting on a suitcase beside Amy, with his back against the rail, prepared to argue the point. ""Especially since this old tub has never known a sail.""""What?"" she said, bringing her mind down to every-day things with an effort. ""Oh, the basket! I wouldn't dare tell you that,"" she added, with sudden animation. ""Boys, boys, if you could only see inside--if you only could--oh, how your mouths would water!""""What, for instance?"" Roy demanded. ""If you call a leaky old ferryboat with the weather so damp that you can't touch the rail without feeling as if you have had a dip in the briny--if that's what you call romantic, then give me a good open fire and plenty of chicken bones to gnaw.""""Oh,"" said Betty in sorrow, shaking her head at the depths to which the boys had fallen. ""Frank, I would never have thought it of you. Just the same,"" she added, in a stage whisper, ""I wouldn't mind having a couple of them myself.""""Oh, Mollie, look there,"" cried Betty, pulling her friend towards her and indicating an indistinct shadowy bulk looming eerily before them. ""Mollie, dear, that's the island, isn't it? I can't wait until I put my two feet on it.""As he spoke the little steamer scraped against the dock that was almost invisible to those on deck, then came to a full stop. The shrill whistle which Roy contemptuously characterized as a joke, broke the misty stillness with a shriek, that echoed and re-echoed, thrown back upon itself by some distant cave or hillside on the island.""Goodness! I wouldn't mind a nice fire myself,"" said Mollie, shivering with something a little more than cold. There was something mysterious about this island, shrouded as it was in the clinging mist--something that made the girls draw close together for companionship. ""I hope it will be more cheerful in the daytime--the island, I mean, not the fire,"" she added."
"""Then you needn't worry about our following you,"" said Allen. ""Only if you don't look out we will get there before you after all. Come on, Betty,"" and for the second time that day the young folks had a chance to test their skill in running. The main thing was that they got there before the rain.It contained two large double beds--each in a little alcove of its own. The spotless grass mats, the flowers that bloomed on the wide-silled, latticed windows gave the room an air of cheerful hominess and comfort that was very pleasant.""The sun!"" she cried joyfully. ""And I was sure it was going to be rainy this morning! Oh, now we shall see the island as it really is. Wake up, Amy, do! Oh, goodness, how the child sleeps!"" and she shook her slumbering friend with no uncertain hand.""Well, if you don't believe it,"" said Will, through the keyhole, ""all you have to do is to come down and see for yourself. We've got everything fixed up O. K. all right. But say! when are you fellows--I mean girls--going to get up?""It required a great deal of tact to coax Amy and Grace out of bed, but it took a still greater amount of merciless driving to get them downstairs and into the big airy dining room, where Mrs. Irving was impatiently awaiting them.""And I feel as if I could sleep forever,"" said Grace. ""You never saw anything like Betty, Mrs. Irving,"" she complained. ""Why, I do believe she could have made a fortune in the old days as an overseer down South.""""Oh, oh, say no more!"" said Betty, clapping her hands joyfully and executing a little dance about the room. ""Honey and biscuits--I could make a meal of them alone. Mrs. Irving, show me the stove--lead me to it--and I'll make the biscuits,"" she finished importantly.""Mrs. Irving,"" Grace pleaded, turning to the chaperon, ""you are the only one here who could possibly make Betty do anything that she didn't want to do or stop her doing anything she had set her heart on. Won't you please interfere for the sake of the community? It might really be dangerous,"" she added plaintively.""Don't worry,"" Mollie put in. ""I have eaten Betty's biscuits of old, and, believe me, they are good. All I ask is that you hustle, Betty--shoo----"" And she hurried the willing Little Captain before her into the kitchen."
"""They're out yonder in the woods,"" Mrs. Irving replied, indicating a spot beyond the cottage. ""They were up very early this morning--couldn't wait to get the tents up. Allen left word that they would stop around in a couple of hours to say good-afternoon to you girls--if you happened to be up by that time,"" and the little chaperon's eyes twinkled as she saw the look of rising indignation in the girls' faces.""If we happen to be up, indeed,"" sniffed Betty, bustling around the kitchen in a business-like fashion, sorting out pans and getting out the flour, which Mollie's aunt had very thoughtfully left in the larder. ""If they talk like that much more, they won't get any of my biscuits. Just wait till they smell them, girls--they will go down on their knees.""""Oh, Amy! Amy!"" gasped Mollie, ""you will be the death of me yet. Anybody would actually think, to hear you talk, that you had really had some experience. Say, Betty,"" she added, regarding the doughy mixture--the result of Betty's skillful manipulation, ""that looks mighty interesting--I shouldn't mind learning how to make them myself.""""Oh, it's lots of fun,"" Betty affirmed, cutting out the biscuits with an improvised cutter--this last being the top of a baking powder can. ""Only take my advice,"" she went on, standing with the cover poised in the air and speaking earnestly. ""Don't try it on your family first--they never appreciate you. Why, the first time I made biscuits, do you know what dad said?""""Well, he said,"" Betty continued, patting the last biscuit into its appointed place and regarding her work with satisfaction, ""he said the best thing I could do with them would be to pack them and send them to the old country to use in some of the new howitzers or something like that they are getting out. How is that for a slam?""Betty turned and shot a reproachful glance at her friend. ""Just for that, Grace,"" she said, ""I ought to say you can't have any of these--works of art,"" indicating the pan she was putting into the oven. ""Why do you girls stand around staring at me anyway?"" she added, a sudden note of impatience in her voice. ""Why don't you do something to earn your living? Set the table or get the water boiling for the eggs. I can't do everything--now scatter! If you were all as hungry as I am you wouldn't wait to be told.""""Where is the table cloth, Mollie?"" called Amy from the other room. ""We used paper napkins and doilies last night."" Then she added, as Mollie came to help her, ""Did you ever see anybody eat like those boys last night?""""What a question!"" said Grace, appearing at the door carrying a plateful of the most deliciously golden honey the girls had ever seen--or so at least it seemed to them. ""Do you imagine they could exist from six o'clock to ten without eating? Mollie, I gave you credit for more sense."""
"""Is that so?"" retorted Mollie, cross because she was hungry. ""Well, I have a good deal more sense than some people I know. I mention no names, but see where I am looking,"" and she stared steadfastly at her unruffled chum, who was calmly setting the honey on the table.""Here I am again,"" said Betty, ""acting the part of peacemaker. Oh, girls, it is too wonderful a day for outdoor girls to quarrel. I am simply crazy to get out in the woods and just revel in the grass and the trees and the sunshine."" And she glanced longingly out of the open door that led to the porch. ""Oh, I wish,"" she said, ""I wish the biscuits could be done and eaten all in five minutes. Amy, did you put the eggs in?"" she demanded, and Amy, who had been gazing out of the window, scuttled out to the kitchen obediently. The girls and the boys, laughingly driving Mrs. Irving before them, fairly tumbled down the shallow steps in their eagerness to feel the soft grass under their feet. As Betty said, it was a glorious day, a typical day in early August, when a soft breeze tempers the heat of the scorching sun, and sets the trees to murmuring.The spicy air, sweet with the intoxicating scent of damp, moist earth and blossoming flowers, went to their heads like wine and they danced down the path that led through the woods on feet that scarcely touched the ground.Soon they emerged from the dense shadows of the wood into the small clearing which was thick and mossy under foot, and there, nestling among the trees, were the two tents the boys had so laboriously constructed.""He thinks he is reading 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,'"" drawled Grace. ""However, we will deign to honor you with our presence."" And she swept past him with a queenly air that elicited amused laughter from the others.For more than an hour the Outdoor Girls and their friends roamed about the clearing inspecting the tent critically, inside and out, and picking flowers in between times. It was Will who first suggested a change.It was well on toward three o'clock before the girls had changed their morning middies and skirts for dainty afternoon dresses, and had made all other necessary preparations for a trip to town. Mrs. Irving declined to go, saying she wished to write letters.It was in the best of spirits that the party of young people stood on the end of the dock, waiting to hail the little steamer as it chug-chugged its way from the summer colony at the far end of Pine Island to the mainland.When finally it did come in sight, the girls and the boys found themselves convulsed with laughter. If the shabby little craft had appeared grotesque in the mist of the night before, how much more forlorn did it look in the full, dazzling glare of the sun! As it came nearer they saw that the decks were crowded with people, the gay dresses of the girls mingling with the white flannel trousers and dark coats of the men.The bungalow party thoroughly enjoyed the trip to the mainland. The scenery was as beautiful as it had been pictured, and when they got tired of looking at the sky, the water, and the mainland, they had plenty to occupy their attention in the people about them. Everybody seemed ready for a good time, and the old ferryboat was filled with shouts and laughter.""I guess you are right,"" Roy admitted, as they joined the rest of the party. ""Just look at all those dudes, staring at Betty and Grace! Say! I'd like to teach them manners!"" and he glowered at the unconscious boys from the summer colony with a ferocity that should have terrified the most hardy."
"""Here we are, almost ashore,"" cried Amy, a little later. ""Have you got the list of the things we need, Allen? Let's see--butter and sugar and baking powder and eggs and--oh, we mustn't forget the meat.""Betty put her arm protectingly around the younger girl. ""There is no reason why you should want to be that, is there?"" she questioned. ""Amy thinks that as long as she feeds you boys well there is no need of----""""That was pretty good work,"" said Will, with an air of satisfaction as they made their way to the shore, followed by a stream of laughing humanity. ""I hope the girls didn't mind getting their dresses mussed. Say, fellows, if any one should ask me, I'd tell them it was one peach of a day!""""I have it!"" he cried. ""Don't you remember, Allen, that you gave it to me just before we left, while you ran back to get something for Betty? Behold,"" and he dangled the precious list before their eyes. The Outdoor Girls must have a fire. That they had decided at the supper table. What was the use of having a big fire-place if they never used it? Betty's theory was, that it was wicked to let anything go to waste. All this being true, it stood to reason that a fire they must have.""I wonder if the boys wouldn't come in and help us build it,"" Grace suggested, seized with a brilliant idea. ""There are already some logs in the fire-place, but I feel that I would like to have somebody else work for me to-night.""""Yes, but then think of all the trouble they would be making us,"" said Betty. ""Besides,"" she added, ""your aunt didn't say anything about a troop of noisy boys, Mollie, when she lent us her bungalow for the summer.""""Anything else?"" Frank inquired mildly, while the rest of him followed his head into the room. ""The fellows told me to come on ahead, and say to you ladies that they would be here as soon as they got through scouring their frying pan.""Betty paused half way to the kitchen and balanced her pile of dishes on one hand. ""Mollie,"" she cried in dismay, ""they will never think of it! Don't you think you had better go back and tell them, Frank?"" she said."
"""What's the matter with our going together?"" Frank inquired, moving his head slightly to bring Mollie within his range of vision. ""The distance won't seem half as far if I have such pleasant company,"" he added gallantly.Long before they had expected, voices were heard in the distance and the most unearthly noises broke the woodland stillness. There was a banging of wood upon tin and the clatter of utensils mingling with the outrageous uproar from three pairs of sound and healthy lungs. There were shouts and war cries and yells, combining in a weird clamor that could be heard for miles around--or so it seemed to the girls.A moment later the boys rushed upon them, vigorously pounding utensils, and shouting at the top of their voices. The girls gave way before them, and the roisterers tumbled in and took possession as though they were really the Redskins, whose cries they were successfully imitating. They raced about the house like madmen, while the girls watched their antics in a peculiar frame of mind. If the truth must be told, they were undecided whether to be displeased or amused. Amusement conquered in the end, however, for the boys were irresistibly funny, and the girls laughed till they ached and the tears rolled down their cheeks.Suddenly the smoke which had been rolling in clouds up the chimney, refused to roll farther. There being no other exit except into the room, the girls and boys suddenly found themselves suffocating. They choked, and the boys stumbled to their feet and followed the fleeing girls into the dining room.They drew back with cries of disgust and began rubbing their eyes and faces furiously. Then the four blackened adventurers turned to the girls appealingly. They looked so funny, standing there with their faces black and their clothes bespattered with grime and a look of sheepish chagrin on their faces, that the girls burst into gales of uncontrolled laughter.""How is this for a fire, eh?"" said Will, holding out his hand to the welcome warmth of the blaze, for although the days were hot, the nights were apt to be damp and cool on this island, surrounded as it was by the waters of the lake. ""Some time the girls will find out that we know our business pretty well. Oh, that feels good!""""That reminds me,"" said Betty, turning accusing eyes upon Roy and Mollie, whose faces were clearly outlined in the dancing fire-light. ""You two people over there seem to have a secret that you don't want to share with us. I think Mrs. Irving knows,"" she went on, turning an accusing eye on the chaperon where she sat in the midst of the circle, ""but she won't let on. Suppose you tell the rest of us what it is.""""Well, Mollie said something about a fire,"" Roy admitted, ""and I thought a couple of boxes of marshmallows wouldn't be unwelcome; so, when the rest of you were all busy buying other things, Mollie and I slipped off and got them. Where are they, Mollie?""""I'll get them,"" she answered, rising reluctantly from her comfortable chair. ""I hid them. I knew that if Grace once had an inkling they were in the house she would never rest till she found them. In that case----"" she paused impressively, and looked about her, ""there wouldn't have been one left by to-night."""
"""He says,"" Mollie continued, ""in the old days there used to be as many as two or three hundred of the gypsies gathered around here--on this part of the island, too."" She paused to see the effect of her words.""But didn't your aunt say anything about that, Mollie?"" Grace queried. ""Why, it seems impossible. I don't wonder you felt creepy, especially if there are many like that old crone we saw in Deepdale,"" and she glanced over her shoulder in the direction of the open window.""If you boys hadn't been so set on our looking at your old camp to-day,"" said Amy with unusual spirit, ""we would have proved it to you before this. But do you really think there are gypsies on the island?"" she added. ""Because, if there are, we might be able to find some of their loot."" She voiced this last desire in hushed tones.""Remember----"" said Frank, referring to the conversation of the night before, ""remember, you girls will have to prove your claims to championship swimming this morning. If you were just faking, now is the time we'll find you out.""""Really?"" Roy inquired with interest. ""Then you must be Mollie's ghost, while the real Mollie is swimming around out there somewhere,"" waving his hand in the direction of the water, ""chumming with some of the beautiful water nymphs. Just think, nothing to do but swim for--how many years is it, Mollie?"" he asked.""Say, what kind of sport are you, anyway?"" Will demanded. ""That's the way with girls--they all make a big bluff about being able to do what we can, and then when it actually comes down to business they want to try it on us first. I'd like to see one of you go in first!""Betty made a dash for the water. ""Wouldn't it be nice,"" she flung back at him over her shoulder, ""if all wishes could be granted so easily. Come on, girls--we'll show them a thing or two,"" and she waded in till the water was above her waist, then plunged in over her head.On, on the two racers went, with no apparent effort, until half the distance to the log had been covered. It was then that the watchers noticed the change. Betty lengthened her stroke a trifle and forged ahead, while Frank still kept the same steady stroke.Then, when more than half of the remaining distance had been covered, Frank evidently made up his mind that it was time to show those people some real speed. Suddenly he dropped the lazy stroke, and it seemed as though he were imbued with new life. His arms and legs worked together with the precision of a machine and he shot through the water like a catapult."
"""Well, that's where you had another think coming."" Betty would not have been human had she not gloried in this victory--for even a tie with one of Frank's strength and muscle was a triumph. ""I told you I could swim.""Mrs. Irving was lying down and the rest of the party was gathering about the camping place of the boys, some roaming about restlessly and others sitting upon the grass. It was a sultry, scorching day, when not a breeze came to temper the heat--a day when the slightest movement produces the effect, as Mollie had said, ""of a fire lighted right under your nose."" The young people were restlessly on edge, undecided what to do.It was too hot to make the long-looked-for walk to the summer colony a possibility. Of course they could swim, but this they had done all morning long and one couldn't swim forever! This was the state of affairs then, when Mollie made her petulant remark.""I tell you what we can do,"" said Allen, and the two on the grass regarded him hopefully. ""We fellows have brought some fishing tackle--suppose we go out and try to get some fish for supper? That doesn't require much energy,"" he added.""Oh, come on, Grace, be a sport,"" Frank coaxed. ""Just think how nice and shady and cool it will be when we get there. It _will_ be nice and shady and cool, won't it, Mollie?"" he added, turning to her for confirmation.Will took them in his hands and examined them minutely. ""They're pippins!"" he exclaimed joyfully. ""I don't know when I've seen a better outfit. You ought to be able to catch all the fish in the lake with these, girls,"" and he regarded them admiringly.They all laughed, including Mrs. Irving, who had come downstairs. She had not been feeling well of late--the heat had been too much for her--but she had announced a strong desire to accompany the young folks, if they went very far from home.""Well, I guess that's enough,"" said Allen, clapping the top on the big tin box, and getting to his feet. ""Now if the fish don't like the bait any better than you girls, I shouldn't wonder if we got done out of our supper.""""Good idea,"" Betty agreed. And she immediately plumped down on her two slim ankles, looking up at Allen invitingly. ""You look so far away,"" she said. ""When you sit down you are not nearly so impressive. There's plenty of room for two,"" and she patted the rock beside her."
"""It looks as if nothing would hurt them but an axe,"" Frank remarked. He had seated himself next to Allen and Betty, after having made Grace comfortable, and was busily engaged in baiting his hook. ""You'd better hurry up, Allen--we'll have all the fish in the place hooked before you get started.""""It does seem foolish,"" Betty admitted, taking her rod from Allen's hand, ""but I can't help it. Come, little fishes,"" she called, casting her line far out into the pool. ""Right this way! You have got to live up to the reputation Mollie has given you.""As he rid himself of his shoes in frantic haste, there was one thought and one only in his mind--to reach the helpless owner of those hands and bring her back to life and hope. He was sure it was a girl--those little appealing hands could belong to no other.Oh, he would never reach it! The water seemed to be some living thing, pushing him; driving him back to the shore in spite of himself! His muscles seemed weighted with lead, his sodden clothing dragged upon him mercilessly! Oh, he would never reach her in time--he couldn't!Then a wild, hot thought flashed through his consciousness, searing it like a flame. Now was no time to say he could not! He must! _He must!_ A life depended on his ability to reach that spot when the girl came to the surface again--if indeed she ever did. Ah, perhaps what he had seen had been the last time. Then he must dive, dive, dive until he found her, even though he lose his own life in the attempt.""Well, she will be if we don't hurry pretty fast,"" said Betty, her voice trembling but determined. ""Boys, look about and see if you can find anything round and hard that we can use in place of a barrel. Oh, do hurry! Mollie, you take her other arm and move it up and down--that's the way--hard--hard.""For half an hour they worked over the unconscious form and more than once during that time, they had almost given up hope of bringing back the spark of life. Then, all at once, a change took place--the ashy look of her face gave way to a faint tinge of color--the blue lips parted in something very like a sigh, and her hands, which had been lying inert and lifeless at her side, twitched almost imperceptibly.""Don't try, my dear,"" said Betty soothingly, while two tears made their way down her face, only to be dashed away impatiently. ""You have been through a terrible experience, and you don't have to think very hard just now--there is plenty of time.""""I'll help you as far as I can,"" she promised. ""You were swimming and something happened that made you cry for help. Luckily we happened to be near and one of the boys got you and brought you back to land. And here you are getting strong and well again,"" she finished brightly."
"""Well, whoever you are, you're a dear,"" said the stranger, the emphasis showing how quickly she was gaining strength. ""I remember now all about it. Mother and dad have told me over and over that I must not come over here alone; but the day was perfect for a swim and no one else would come, so I slipped off by myself. I was swimming all right, and then I was taken with cramps. Oh, oh, it was terrible!"" and she covered her face with her hands to shut out the memory.The girl looked up wonderingly at the sweet girlish faces gathered about her. ""I think you must be a--a company of angels,"" a sharp sob broke the attempt at a laugh--for she was still very weak. ""You are all so good to me I----""Allen and Frank, being the stronger of the boys, volunteered to carry the slight girl--she was young, scarcely sixteen--for the first half mile. Then the other two boys were to carry her the rest of the distance.In a moment the little procession was formed, and it started off for the woods, toward the summer colony. Allen and Frank moved in front with their burden, followed by the four girls and Mrs. Irving, while Roy and Will brought up the rear.The boys were wet to the skin, and even on a scorching day in August that is anything but a pleasant sensation. Then, too, the way was rough, and the briers and brambles along the path scratched their hands and tore at their clothing. Ordinarily all these petty annoyances would have tended toward making them irritable and cross, but on this day all such trifles passed over their heads unnoticed. For had they not between them done a marvelous thing? To save one life--to have brought back from eternity one little soul--was there not joy enough in that to last them all their days? The girls thought there was.A few moments later they heard voices directly ahead, and Anita--for that, she had said, was her name--raised her voice excitedly. ""They are probably coming in search of me,"" she cried, cheeks flushing with the hope of it. ""I knew they would! Oh, I knew it! Dad! Conway!"" she called.Then the two relief parties came face to face. Frank and Allen set the girl gently upon her feet and her father caught her in his arms. ""You're safe!"" he murmured over and over again. ""My little girl!"" and the others turned away before the depth of his emotion."
"""Madam,"" he said to Mrs. Irving, ""if you will tell me to whom I am indebted for Anita's safe return, I will try to thank him or her or all of you as the case may be. Although thanks at this time seem a small return for such a service.""""I am sure none of us wish any thanks for whatever little help we may have been able to render your daughter,"" Mrs. Irving answered, with grave courtesy. ""We can only thank a kind fate for leading us within hearing distance of her appeal for help. The rest is simply what you and your son would have done for any of us had we been in similar danger.""""That doesn't make what you have done any the less splendid,"" Anita's brother broke in impulsively, holding his sister as though he would never let her go again. ""Anita is tired now, but when we hear the whole story, I know we are going to be even more grateful to you than we were before--eh, Anita?""""Oh, they were wonderful to me,"" said the girl, her eyes shining like stars. ""If it hadn't been for them--I don't dare--think----"" and again her hand flew to her eyes to shut out the horror of that awful moment.Suddenly all Mrs. Irving's mother instinct rose to the fore, and she spoke impulsively. ""Take the child home,"" she begged; ""what she needs more than anything else is rest. You can see she is at the breaking point.""Mr. Benton looked at his daughter, who indeed was trembling like a leaf in her brother's arms, and saw the truth of the statement. ""You are right,"" he said slowly. ""We can't get Anita home too soon."" Then, turning once more to Mrs. Irving, he added, while his eyes traveled over the group of girls and boys behind her: ""Although we haven't time now to become better acquainted, we are going to stay here the rest of the summer, and if you expect to remain our neighbors----""""Well, it scared me nearly to death,"" said Grace, who was curled up on the lower step, with a cushion brought from the house acting as head rest. ""I declare when I saw them drag her up on the bank, Betty, I thought that she was dead. She looked so drawn and white, and----""""Well, you couldn't expect her to look particularly rosy and happy, after all she had been through,"" Mollie remarked. ""If I had been doused under water as long as that poor girl was I would not only have looked dead, I'd have been it.""""Speak for yourself,"" Mollie was beginning angrily, when Betty entered into the conversation. She had been dreamily studying the shimmering ripples the soft wind had stirred upon the surface of the water.""Some day,"" she began in a sing-song voice, her eyes still fixed on the distance, ""I'm just going to let you two go on to the bitter finish. I shouldn't wonder if you will be like the two cats of Kilkenny. You remember what they did, don't you?""""Oh, I think it can be done,"" Betty answered, her eyes twinkling with fun as she looked at Amy's flushed face. ""At least, I do believe in strong attractions at the first meeting. Perhaps that is all Amy has felt just yet.""""It seems to me it was Grace's dress that was being sat on that time, not you,"" Betty remarked, with a glint of mischief in her eyes. ""I wonder if anybody else has ever noticed,"" she went on, ""the funny habit all you boys have of blaming somebody else for blaming you."""
"""To change the subject,"" said Allen, rising and stretching his arms far above his head, as if to make sure his muscles were still in good condition, ""who wants to share a nice little canoe with me? Your aunt sure knew what she was doing, Mollie.""Afterward they cleared away the dishes in no time, and the four girls, Mrs. Irving having refused to be of the party, ran upstairs to get the light wraps that were always needed at night. The boys met them outside as they rushed down laughing and breathless, and ready for a good time.""I hope it doesn't take the moon till twelve o'clock to show itself,"" said Will, as they made their way down the walk and on to the float where the canoes were attached. ""Mrs. Irving says that we are to be back by ten o'clock at the latest.""""If nobody has any objection,"" said Allen, ""you shall. Grace, you drop into the middle with Frank, until it comes your turn to do the work. Betty may like it, but I must say I'd rather watch you people slave.""She moved restlessly and raised her hand as though to ward off this invader of her dreams, muttering softly, ""Oh--don't----"" Gradually she passed from sleeping to waking and, realizing the cause of the disturbance, sat up in bed with a start.""Oh, A--my!"" she called aloud, giving the bed such a thump that Amy's eyes sprung wide open on the instant--wide and startled. ""Are you going to sleep for-_ever_? Oh, I'm hungry!"" with which words she sprang out of bed and began dressing hastily.Even this did not daunt Mollie. She did not mind getting breakfast at all. In her own words, ""she could smell the good things that much longer."" So now her only answer was: ""Sleepy-head,"" uttered in a severe tone.""Oh, if any one would only give you the chance!"" and Betty gave Grace an affectionate little shake. ""Some time we won't call you, Grace,"" she laughed. ""I'd like to find out just how long you could sleep, if you were left to yourself.""""I don't see what that has to do with it!"" Grace retorted; but only a sharp click of the door and a little derisive laugh in the hall outside answered her. ""Oh, well,"" she added, sitting up and regarding Betty reproachfully as if that young person were responsible, ""I suppose I have got to get up.""""Of course, and make yourself charming for the prince,"" said Betty, pinning a rose at exactly the right angle in her soft white waist. ""You don't have to be a _sleeping_ beauty to find him, you know,"" she added sagely.""Oh!"" cried Betty, and drew back as a small stone flung by some one below hurtled through the open window and fell to the floor at her feet. ""Look! It has something tied to it,"" she cried, and, stooping, picked it up."
"With one accord they rushed to the window through which the message had come and leaned far out. But look as they might in every direction, there was no sight nor sound of human beings. The grounds about the house and even the woods seemed deserted.Mollie's breakfast was good. And the young folks ate with the healthy appetites of youth. Mrs. Irving left the table early to get herself ready to go over to the summer colony where she had promised to spend the day with friends who were summering there. The girls had scarcely finished their breakfast when the boys broke in upon them.""Sorry,"" said Roy, with a quick glance at Betty's nearly injured eyes, which had never looked brighter than at that instant. ""They look pretty good to me. But that brings me back to my first query--why are you girls all dressed up?""She broke into a run, and the others followed--bringing up at the edge of the water a moment later, breathless but glowing. This time no one hesitated, not even Amy. They ran out into the tepid water, then plunged in, swimming with strong, even, steady strokes.It had been decided that all were to take part in the race--consequently all were bent on losing not one moment of practice. They swam, off and on, for the whole morning--occasionally throwing themselves upon the mossy bank, to rest and get their breath, then going at it again with renewed vigor and resolve.""Oh, Roy is only talking to hear himself talk,"" Will assured her. ""It isn't possible to get lost on this island, even if you wanted to. All we would have to do would be to follow the shore and sooner or later we'd be bound to come upon 'The Shadows.'""They crowded about him, gazing in the direction he had pointed out. It was a wonderful island, this--where you were always stumbling into some little glade or woodland bower made especially for you. Surely this tiny garden spot of nature was even more alluring than the famous fishing pool, and the girls pushed forward eagerly.""Oh! will we?"" cried Mollie, and all made a rush for the baskets. ""What's first? You've got the table cloth? Well, then the napkins next and the sandwiches--and the biscuits, and--oh, boys, you never could guess----"" Mollie sat back on her heels and regarded them laughingly. ""Think of the thing you want most in the world,"" she said. ""That's it!""""And here is the hard sauce,"" said Mollie, passing it around from one to the other as though it had been a precious jewel. ""Amy made it--all of powdered sugar--with perhaps a little egg and butter thrown in--and I know it is delicious."""
"""The last of course,"" he answered, plucking a piece of long grass and beginning to chew the end of it. ""I don't know what you put in that plum pudding, but it has made me everlastingly sleepy. I'd like to take a nice long nap;"" and a prodigious yawn gave truth to his words.However, the Outdoor Girls and their boy chums were too active to remain quiet long, even after plum pudding. Allen was the first to become restless, and the others soon caught it from him. He rose, went through some gymnastic exercises, then looked about him curiously. ""I wonder if there are any more places like this hereabout?"" he said. ""Does anybody want to take a little tramp and find out? You look about as energetic as a bunch of turtles. Come on, let's do something.""""And I am going to force the second move,"" and before she could guess what he was going to do, he leaned over, caught her two hands in his and pulled her to her feet. ""Now, you are going to take a little walk with me, young lady. If the rest of this lazy crowd don't want to come along, they know what they can do!""It was Allen who first broke the silence. ""I wish you would tell me what you are thinking about so hard, Betty. It must be very interesting, because you haven't said a word to me since we left that lazy crowd back there. 'Fess up!""She had accidentally brushed aside some brambles that had caught on her dress, and there close beside them, so near that she could thrust her hand into the opening, yawned the cavernous black mouth of a cave.Allen drew her aside quickly. ""Don't go near it,"" he commanded, in a tone that made Betty look at him in surprise. ""I'm suspicious of these caves until I have investigated them myself. I am going to have a look, Betty. You stay where you are.""""Do you know, Allen, there is nothing a girl hates more than to have a boy ask her to be reasonable, when she knows she is? Anyway,"" her voice lowered and she pleaded her turn. ""Anyway, it's lots worse to see anybody get hurt, anybody that you like, that is, than it is to get hurt yourself.""""Will it make you feel any better if we get the others?"" Allen asked, just a little exasperated, for he liked mysteries and hated to leave them unsolved. ""We can get to them in five minutes if we run."""
"""Easily,"" said Allen. ""You see, we are pretty near the water right here and that bent old tree at the edge of the lake--see what I mean?--well, that's right on the line with the mouth of the cave. I guess it will be easy enough to find.""There were about twenty in the group, of which the majority were men. As they came nearer, the girls and boys could see how greatly their ages varied. Some were old men with white hair and flowing beards, while others were young striplings scarcely out of boyhood. Their clothes were many hued and picturesque, while each one carried on his back a huge bundle. They traveled along the bank, speaking in a low mellow tone, a language which the Outdoor Girls and the boys had never heard before.The gypsies moved on for a short distance, then gathered about something the nature of which the girls and boys could not discern. In his curiosity, Allen forgot caution and rising from the protection of the bushes he tip-toed over to a more advantageous lookout. In a moment he was back again on his knees beside the crouching group crying in an excited manner: ""It's our cave--the cave Betty and I discovered--they are going into it. Say, I wish we had gone in when we had the chance!""""Why not?"" he said, his eyes twinkling, for teasing Grace was one of his greatest delights. ""I wouldn't go in anybody's house and deliberately steal anything, but if somebody is kind enough to do it for me----""Willingly they followed his example, but no sooner had they risen to their feet than they were sent scuttling back again like rabbits into a burrow. The bushes were pushed aside and an aged gypsy stepped forth from the opening. With a little gasp of excitement the girls realized that he was without his heavy pack. Whatever it was they had brought evidently had been left behind in the cave. One by one they emerged until their number was complete. The last of the little band, a lad apparently no more than sixteen years old, replaced the screening bushes very carefully across the mouth of their hiding place. Then they turned, and retraced their steps, still speaking that strange melodious tongue of theirs, until they had reached the shore and departed the way they had come. It was not till then that the watchers ventured to speak above a whisper.""Well, I am just crazy to see what the gypsies left there,"" the Little Captain answered, ""but I do think it's a little late now to begin exploring. It isn't as if this were our last day on the island.""Allen went with him to find it, while the girls stood huddled together, wishing themselves back at the bungalow. Mystery is wonderful in the glaring sun of noon-day, but in the chill dusk of evening, with a damp mist rising and touching all the land with clammy fingers--at such a time it is not so alluring. All they wanted was home and a fire and a chance to talk things over.Allen and Frank, carrying the basket between them, soon rejoined those who were waiting at the cave, and they started along the shores of the lake, keeping a sharp lookout for anything that looked like a gypsy. Before the cheerful glow of the fire, the young people talked long that night, while Mrs. Irving listened with interest. Her eyes sparkled at the description of the cave and the gypsy troupe and once she broke in with:"
"Now it had come after a wait that had seemed interminable and she slipped silently out of bed, determined not to awaken the sleeping girls. But before she had time to move half way across the room, Grace hailed her.""Well, anything is better than lying in bed awake,"" yawned Grace, sitting up in bed and curving her arms behind her head with that slow, instinctive grace that was part of her. ""Look at Mollie staring at us for all the world like a little night-owl,"" she added.""Oh, for goodness' sake, Betty, don't you begin to disturb the peace, too,"" Amy broke in sleepily. ""It was bad enough before with Grace and Mollie always at swords' points, but if you begin it, I don't know what I shall do.""Amy's despair was so comical that the girls had to laugh in spite of themselves. As if at a signal, the sun broke through the heavy mist that had risen over night and flooded the room with golden beams. Somehow the world suddenly seemed a better and a happier place to live in, and the girls' spirits rose like mercury.The party started off in high spirits to find the cave and solve its mysteries. Mrs. Irving was with them, for, as Betty had said, she was a game little person and in for a good time whenever one could be found.So they started again, troubled and perplexed and scanning every step of the way. Half an hour later they halted for another conference. The tree was nowhere to be found--neither was the cave. It seemed as if their adventure of the day before had been a dream which had faded and vanished into thin air with the advent of the morning.Mollie had opened her mouth for a stinging rejoinder, but before she could voice it there came a disturbance from a new and unexpected quarter. The bushes parted and two figures emerged--a young man and a girl.""Oh, we would have been here long ago, but, you see, I was rather, well--shaken up,"" Anita explained, with a merry little laugh that made the girls warm to her at once. ""Conway could hardly wait to come to tell you all how grateful he was--and is,"" she added, with a quaint little sideways glance in the direction of her tall brother.""Anita's right. I almost came alone when I found she was inconsiderate enough to get sick,"" said Conway, who had been regarding the scene with lively interest. ""You see, I never knew before what it was to almost lose a small sister.""""He speaks as if he had any number of them,"" cried Anita, gaily; and one could see at a glance the perfect understanding and union between the two. ""But, really, this is the very first day I have been able to walk any distance at all, so Con and I thought we'd take advantage of it.""""Well, we are mighty glad you did,"" said Roy heartily, and Mollie glanced at him sideways. ""I wonder if you two could help us solve a riddle,"" he added. ""We had just about given it up for a bad job when you came along.""There could be no escaping this emphatic young person--that they realized--so Allen started to explain. When he had finished the two visitors were almost, if not quite, as excited as the Outdoor Girls and their boy chums had been.They stared at one another dumbfounded. It was as Grace had said--this was the day they had decided on for the race and they had forgotten all about it. Had ever such a thing happened before in the annals of history? If so, they could not remember it."
"Betty looked at her dazedly. ""What race?"" she repeated. ""Why, _the_ race, of course. Oh, I beg your pardon--I forgot you didn't know. The fact is, we have been planning a swimming race for--oh, ever so long--and now this gypsy-cave business put it clear out of our heads. Oh! how could we have forgotten it?""""I vote we get into our bathing suits just as fast as we can,"" said Frank. ""That is, if our visitors don't mind seeing a crazy race,"" he added, half-apologetically; for he remembered his manners just in the nick of time.""Oh, it would be all right if we fellows could be in it alone,"" said Roy, wickedly. ""But, you see, the girls have a mistaken idea they can swim, too, and so, just to encourage them, we have let them in on it.""As the young people neared ""The Shadows"" their excitement grew, and when at last they reached the house the girls fairly flew up the stairs, dragging Anita with them, Conway going with the boys, of course.""It's pretty hard luck,"" said Mollie, sympathetically, ""to have to stay out of the water on days like this. Say, girls, do you think we have a chance in the world of even keeping up with the boys?"" she asked, anxious, now that the moment of the test had come.""Why, of course we can,"" said Betty, pretending a confidence she did not feel. ""Especially if the boys give us the heavy handicap we agreed on. I didn't want them to, but I guess it may come in handy.""""Well,"" said Allen, electing himself spokesman, ""we decided on a starting point about a quarter of a mile from here. You see, from a sharp turn there, there is, for about three-quarters of a mile, a course almost straight. So, you see, that makes a fairly good course.""""I tell you what you can do,"" said Allen, struck by a sudden thought. ""You and your sister can be the judges. In case there are any ties--although, of course such a thing is improbable""--the girls refused to become indignant at this shot--""we'll need somebody to settle our dispute, and Mrs. Irving has flatly refused to interfere before this.""The vote was carried unanimously, and the newly made judges were instructed by Will to ""trot along to the finishing point"" and wait till they saw him leading the van. Then they would know who had won the race. There was an ironic shout at this assertion and Conway's laugh came back to them as he and his sister started to obey orders.""Well, now, is everybody ready?"" Roy asked, surveying the group critically. ""Suppose you girls get started. We won't jump in until one of you gets well past that jut in the shore--then it's our time to show a little speed."""
"Without more ado, the boys struck out bravely, determined to overtake the girls in the shortest time possible. They found it was not so easy, however, as might have been anticipated. The girls had had a big advantage and were still swimming strongly. Will and Roy began to agree with Frank that they had given them too long a handicap.Mollie and Betty had fallen a short distance behind the other two. They had felt the tax the speed was making on their strength, and had decided wisely to save the rest of it until it was more needed then at the present.Naturally Amy and Grace thought their friends were giving up and marveled at it. How on earth could they have lost out so soon? Had they been more versed in races they could have answered that question themselves.Meanwhile the boys, pulling hard, had managed to make up half the distance between them and the girls, and in sight of Betty's and Mollie's evident weariness their hopes soared high. Why, with these last two out of the running the race was as good as won.Amy had come to the limit of her strength with the goal an eighth of a mile away. She knew that for her the race was over. The waters pushed her back, forced her back, seeming like some pitiless enemy bent upon her downfall.And what of Grace? She would not acknowledge to herself that her strength was leaving her--why, she had swum as far as that many a time before--it was absurd that she should give up now. Besides, she was leading them all. With this thought she put the remainder of her waning strength into a few last desperate strokes.Meanwhile, the boys had caught up with Mollie, and seeing this she quickened her stroke, forging ahead again. But Betty kept the same calm, steady stroke which had so deceived the boys--and the girls, too, for that matter, with the exception of Mollie.The finish line had been very conveniently marked by a slender tree which had evidently been torn down in some terrific storm and now lay half on the shore and half upon the water. This, then, was their goal.Conway was the first to see them coming. ""Look, Nita!"" he cried, seizing his sister's arm and drawing her to the edge of the water. ""From the way they are all lined up I should judge this is nobody's race yet. That's the kind of a thing I enjoy--where there is occupation at the end. And look----""Out on the water the girls and boys knew the time had come when they must show what was in them. Grace and Amy, with the discomfited Will, had fallen to the rear, and the race lay between the other five. Allen was leading, and the two young judges on the bank had just decided that either he or Frank would be the winner. Then it happened! The two girls gathered all their energy, that splendid reserve strength they had kept so well in check--summoned every ounce of vitality they had and gave it full rein."
"Their muscles, trained to outdoor life, gallantly responded to the call. They passed first Frank, then Allen, who stared after them stupidly. You see, the boys were not believers in miracles. However, they rallied their reserved strength and shot ahead until they were even with the girls again.The goal was close before them. Now, if ever, must come the last desperate spurt. Could they make it? They must! they must! The thought kept hammering itself over and over in the girls' consciousness. They were so near now--they couldn't lose--oh, they couldn't!Conway stretched forward eagerly as the swimmers rushed on toward the mark. Four hands closed over the fallen tree trunk almost at the same instant--but not quite. Mollie reached the goal a fraction of a second ahead--the race was hers.For a few seconds the swimmers were too spent even to congratulate the winner. But when they did recover sufficient breath, they fairly overwhelmed her with praises. As Roy had said, ""they were nothing if not sports.""""It was lucky you did have a judge, or, I should say judges."" Conway glanced apologetically toward his sister. ""Otherwise I don't believe anybody would have known which of you got there first. It was as near a tie as anything I have ever seen.""As the four lagging participants in the race came up to them, rather sore and disgruntled, the young folks delicately forbore to look in their direction and Frank covered their coming with a remark. ""I don't know how you girls ever accomplished it--I thought you were done almost at the beginning. Tell us the secret.""Mollie and Betty looked at each other significantly. ""That's our secret,"" said Betty. Then, springing to her feet, she cried: ""Let's give three cheers for the winner of the race, Miss Mollie Billette!""""Don't be modest, Mollie,"" Roy entreated. ""You beat us all fairly--especially me,"" he added ruefully. They laughed and Betty added whimsically: ""I thought I had you up to the last, Mollie. It wasn't fair to lead me on like that."""
"Only too soon--for Anita and the Outdoor Girls had taken a great liking to one another--the former declared that it was time she and her big brother must be starting for home. ""Dad and mother worry whenever I am out of their sight nowadays--even though Con is with me,"" she explained. The week that followed the Outdoor Girls remembered as just one endless round of fun. With the exception of two days, the weather was perfect. They traveled over to town on the rickety ferryboat several times. They took the cars out of the garage for short spins about the country, and otherwise amused themselves.Then, too, the fish in the unrivaled fishing pool proved just as agreeable as they had on that first day, and provided many delicious suppers for the young people. The only thing that served to mar their pleasure was the continued reluctance of the mysterious cave to come to light--it was as though the earth had opened and swallowed it up.""I'm beginning to think it just never was,"" Grace remarked, as she contentedly munched some chocolates that Frank had laid on her altar. ""Will is terribly worried about it. He thinks since he is in the secret service that he ought to investigate it.""""I'm on your side, Will,"" she said staunchly. ""I'm not going to stop looking for the cave until we have to go home. Why, just think of the things we might find. There is probably loot in that place that is worth a great big lot of money, and in some cases they might be things that money couldn't replace. It's not a question of mere curiosity, it's a duty we owe to society.""There was no need of urging, for they fairly flew in the direction of her voice. There she was down on her knees before an opening much lower and narrower than the one they had discovered before, but nevertheless unmistakably another entrance to the cave.""I caught my foot in a twig,"" she explained, as they crowded around her, wild with excitement, ""and I almost fell into the cave."" So, as in the first place, the discovery had been made through an accident.Nothing loath, Mollie, Betty and even Grace pressed into the opening after Will, the boys standing aside--this last bit of self-control proving that chivalry was not all dead yet. The first temptation had been to run pell-mell after Will, regardless of girls or any other disturbing element that might be about.After several feet of back-breaking progress the girls came out into another portion of the cave, where the roof was high enough to admit of an upright position. As they stood up, nerves aquiver with suppressed excitement, Will rushed back to them.""There is another entrance at the other end,"" he cried. ""That must be the one you and Allen found, Betty. Come over here where you can get more light,"" he added. ""It filters through the leaves and twigs at the opening.""All this time he was leading the way to the spot that he was describing, the others following breathlessly. Once there, he grasped Allen's arm excitedly, crying in a tense voice: ""Look here, old man, here is one of those bags they carried the other day--the place is full of them. Now I am going to open this one. You keep a good lookout."""
"""Hush!"" cried Allen, and they listened, scarcely daring to breathe. From the mouth of the cave, soft but unmistakable, came the sound of voices--voices speaking in a tongue the boys had heard before. There could be no mistake--the gypsies were visiting their hiding place!The little group of young people held their breath while the gypsies entered, silent now. In the dim light of the cave their features could not be seen, but there was something about the bent old figure of the foremost gypsy that proclaimed the leader of that other day. They were as velvet-footed as cats, and as the girls' eyes became more accustomed to the gloom they discovered that the gypsies were not hunch-backed, as had first appeared, but merely carried upon their backs packs like those others scattered about the cave. These they deposited on the floor without much ceremony and were gone before the girls and boys had fairly realized it.""No, they won't,"" Will asserted, for he had suddenly acquired great dignity. ""They have probably gone for another haul. In the meantime it is up to us to inform the authorities, and mighty quick, too.""""That's easy enough,"" Allen commented. ""Besides I've been anxious to examine the contents of that bag for a long time. Now, I'd like to see anybody keep me from it!"" and he rushed over to the other side of the cave and was opening one of the bags even as he spoke.The others crowded close beside him as he knelt on the ground, taking advantage of the meager light from the cave mouth to examine its contents. What they did see literally made them gasp. Gold and silver and strings upon strings of beads--some very valuable, others less so--and trinkets of all sorts and descriptions.""Well, you people can stay here and guard the loot if you want to,"" said Will. ""But I'm going over to the mainland to hunt up a couple of ancient sheriffs--I suppose they are ancient,"" he added whimsically. ""In stories, you wouldn't recognize a sheriff without his whiskers.""""Never mind the whiskers,"" said Mollie impatiently. ""The thing is, somebody has to stay and guard the cave or it will disappear the way it did the other time, and you will bring the authorities over here for nothing.""""Well, of course you will have to stay until I get back,"" Will decided. ""In the meantime, you can eat lunch. Good-bye, I'm off."" And he led the way into the sunlight, which dazzled their eyes after the semi-gloom of the cave. Somehow the lunch did not taste as good that day. Excitement had robbed the Outdoor Girls and their boy friends of appetite. They ate in a preoccupied way, eyes now on the cave so close at hand, now wandering in the direction from which the gypsies had come. If these latter should return before Will--well, then it would be time for a hurried exit on their part. They had no intention of being caught in the wolf's lair."
"It was Will, however, who reached the place first, and those waiting for him could have danced with relief when they heard his voice. A moment later they caught sight of him, accompanied by two men from the town. Judging from their gesticulations, the latter were more than ordinarily excited. Incidentally, let it be recorded that neither of them, the sheriff nor his deputy, had a beard.""Good,"" said Will, then, turning to the men beside him, added: ""This is the entrance we found to-day--you see the bushes hide it completely. But there is another and a larger opening at the other end--that's the one we stumbled into in the first place.""""Now we will find out how far their rascality has gone,"" one of the men, the elder of the two, asserted. ""Perhaps you don't know it,"" he added, untying the fastenings of the first bag, ""but you young people have done the community a great service. People all over are complaining of stolen property, and, although we have suspected the gypsies for some time, so far we haven't been able to prove anything. However, this discovery of yours changes things considerably. Ah, what have we here?""""Oh, yes!"" Mollie explained. ""Mother lost her silver tea service that has been in the family for ever so many years, besides an expensive jet necklace. And, besides that, Miss Ford's father had his pet thoroughbred horse stolen.""""Hum,"" said the spokesman, stroking his beardless chin thoughtfully. ""It looks as if we might be able to trace a good many things."" And he continued to explore the contents of the bag to the very bottom.The other one was treated in like manner but nothing familiar met the watching eyes. Of course, all were disappointed, but Mr. Mendall, for such was the sheriff's name, warned the young people that it was not yet time to give up hope--there were plenty more bags where these had come from.""But we haven't time to go through all of them now,"" he stated. ""I simply wanted to assure myself that the things were valuable. Now that I am satisfied on that score, the best thing to do is to get the loot away as soon as possible and then set somebody to watch for those gypsies. I never saw anything like them when it comes to nerve,"" he added, waxing enthusiastic on the subject. ""Why, I believe if you were crossing a chasm with only a board between you and eternity, and they happened to need that board for kindling wood they would pull it out from under you without the slightest compunction.""""Then they would fall into a very prettily laid trap,"" was the grim answer. ""No, my dear young lady, we are not going to leave the cave unguarded. I'll have men watching day and night until we catch them red-handed. It is sure to come sooner or later.""Mr. Mendall rose to his feet, gripping a bag in each hand, but together they were all that he could carry. ""Here, Trent, you take one of these,"" he ordered. ""I'll take the other and, armed with proof like this, we ought to be able to convince even those skeptical people on shore."" Then he added, turning to Will: ""If you will keep watch for another hour we will be back with more men to relieve you."""
"""Oh, I wouldn't say that,"" Betty argued cheerfully. ""Just because they didn't sew him up in a bag and stick him in a gloomy old cave is no reason why we can't find him. We may come across him any time.""""Oh, we stuck to the shore most of the time,"" said Mr. Mendall, cheerily, ""and the rest of the way there are pretty broad paths. Now for the clearing up,"" and he led his half dozen followers after him into the cave.""It won't be much longer,"" Mr. Mendall responded. ""We want you all to know how grateful we are for this assistance. Without it we would probably have been a long time getting to the bottom of things. As I said before, you have rendered a great service to the community.""And with this graceful little speech, Mr. Mendall and two of the men he had brought with him took their leave, carrying with them the precious bags, one of which Mollie so hoped would contain some, at least, if not the whole, of her mother's silver. The other four men were left behind to watch for the return of the gypsies.""Oh, I don't know how I can wait till to-morrow,"" wailed Mollie, as they started homeward. ""I'm simply dying to know. I think they might have opened the things while we were there. Horrid old things! The gypsies probably wouldn't be back for another two weeks, anyway, and there really wasn't any danger.""""Goodness, Mollie!--an hour,"" echoed Betty, in imitation of Mollie's tragic tones. ""Don't you know that it would take at least three hours for the boys to go over, find out what Mr. Mendall has to say to them and get back here? Remember they have to wait for the ferry,"" she added significantly.It was early in the morning of the day on which the Outdoor Girls and the boys had decided to start for home. For days they had expected word from Mr. Mendall. The boys had haunted the town hoping to hear from him--but no word had come. Then suddenly Will had burst in upon the others with the great news that he had almost run into Mr. Mendall turning a corner, and that genial man had expressed great pleasure at sight of him.""Why, he said----"" Will had reported excitedly, ""he said that if he hadn't met me, he fully intended coming over to camp--that he had something to tell me that might be of great interest. And he wants us fellows to come over first thing in the morning,"" he had finished exultantly.""Why can't we stay over anyway--to-morrow is Saturday. I think we might as well finish out the week,"" cried Grace, seized with a bright idea. ""Maybe Mrs. Irving will consent, since it is bound to be late when we do get home."" She popped a chocolate in her mouth as she finished.""Oh, and do you know what Anita said the other day?"" Amy broke in suddenly. ""She said she had some distant relatives in Deepdale, and that if she could fish around and get an invitation, she might see us there."""
"""Do my eyes deceive me?"" cried Betty, springing up and pointing toward the mainland, ""or is that the good old Pine Island dreadnaught steaming majestically from the harbor? Tell me some one--am I right?""At the end of one of the longest half hours the girls had ever spent, the rickety little ferryboat scraped against the dock, and they ran down to meet the boys. The latter almost fell out of the boat, careless of what any one might think. At the first sight of them the girls were convinced their news was of the best.""Oh, Will! isn't that wonderful?"" she cried. ""I didn't dare really to believe till this very moment.
