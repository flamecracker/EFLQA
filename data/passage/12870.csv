passage
The little body of British troopers, only forty-eight of them all told, with Hal Paine and Chester Crawford as their guides, were reconnoitering ten miles in advance of the main army along the river Marne in the great war between Germany and the allied armies. For several hours they had been riding slowly without encountering the enemy, when, suddenly, as the little squad topped a small hill and the two boys gained an unobstructed view of the little plain below, Hal pulled up his horse with an exclamation.Rapidly the enemy advanced, firing volley after volley as they approached; then, at a word from Hal, the British poured forth their answer. And such an answer! Before the aim of these few British troopers, accounted among the best marksmen in the world, the Teuton cavalry went down in heaps.There was a perceptible slackening in the speed of the approaching horsemen. Then, as the English continued their work, firing with machine-like precision and deadly accuracy, the Germans came to a halt.So saying, he ordered the men to the ground, and the little force advanced to the extreme edge of the woods. So far not a man had been even wounded, for the Germans, unable to see that their foe had climbed into the trees, had aimed too low.Apparently, Hal had rightly guessed the cause of the enemy's indecision. They advanced slowly and warily; and when they finally gained the edge of the woods there was not a Briton in sight; but from further in among the trees the leaden messengers of death still struck the Germans, and man after man fell in his tracks.Now the man nearest Chester threw up his arms and with a cry fell to the ground. The lad made as if to go to his assistance, but Hal stayed him with a word, and the little body of English continued their retreat, firing as they went.Suddenly the pursued emerged from the woods into the open. A distance of half a mile lay between them and the next clump of trees. In this half a mile there was nothing that would afford shelter; and the Germans were approaching nearer every second.One more death-dealing volley was delivered at close range, and then the little troop of English turned and fled. But they had traversed scarcely half the distance when the Germans reached the edge of the woods, and poured a volley into them.A faint cheer went up from the handful who were left, and they turned determinedly to face their foes. They did not waste their fire. As the Germans came again into view, the British rifles cracked. Their marksmanship was superb, and rather than face this deadly fire the enemy halted.Then began a game of hide and seek, with death the penalty for all who were seen. The firing was only at intervals now. Wherever a German arm or leg showed itself, a British rifle sounded and a German was accounted for.For almost half an hour the game continued; and it was kept up until darkness fell. Fearing that it was the intent of the British to lure them into the hands of a strong force, the Germans did not attempt a charge, but contented themselves with trying to pick off their foes as they flitted from one tree to another.But if the Germans had suffered, so had the English. Of the little troop of fifty, there now remained, besides Hal and Chester, but ten men. The two boys seemed to bear charmed lives, for neither had been struck once. They had exposed themselves to all dangers as well as had the troopers, but fortunately no German bullets had reached them.
"And still the few English fought on. Now that darkness had fallen and two more men had dropped, Hal ordered those who were left to make a last dash for life. He sprang from behind the tree which had sheltered him, and Chester and the few remaining troopers joined him. Then they turned and sped as rapidly as the darkness would permit in the direction of their own lines.Now that the fire of the English had ceased entirely, the Germans halted, puzzled. It was impossible for their officers to tell whether the enemy had all been killed, or whether the silence heralded the approach of a larger force. Their indecision undoubtedly saved the lives of Hal and Chester and the eight troopers, for had the Germans advanced they would have experienced little difficulty in killing or capturing them.With the loss of their comrades still preying upon their minds, the little troop continued on its way; and while they are hurrying onward we shall take time to introduce Hal and Chester more fully to those who have not met them before, and to relate how it came about that they were serving in such an important capacity with the British army in France. Sturdy American lads, young though they were, Hal Paine and Chester Crawford had, when this story opens, already seen considerable military service. Each had received his baptism of fire during the heroic defense of the Belgian city of Liège, which had held out for days against the overwhelming horde of Teutons.In Berlin with Hal's mother when the war broke out, they had been separated from her and left behind. With Captain Raoul Derevaux, a gallant French officer, and Lieutenant Harry Anderson of the British army, they finally succeeded in making their way, after many desperate experiences and daring adventures, over the Belgian frontier, as told in the first book of this series, entitled ""The Boy Allies at Liège."" They had reached Liège in time to take an active part in the defense of that city.In escaping from Germany, each had done his full share of fighting and each had been wounded. They had finally reached Brussels, where they remained some time, while Hal's wound healed sufficiently to continue his homeward journey. As the result of their heroic actions, the Belgian commander at Liège had mentioned them so favorably in his report to King Albert, that he had bestowed upon them commissions as lieutenants in the Belgian army as a mark of distinction for their bravery.It was while waiting in Brussels that they again encountered Lieutenant Anderson, from whom they had been separated, and it was through his inducement that they now found themselves attached to the staff of Field Marshal Sir John French, commander of the British forces on the continent, engaged in scout duty.The German advance through Belgium into France, up to this time, had been steady, although the Allies had contested every foot of the ground. Day after day and night after night the hard pressed British troops, to which Hal and Chester were attached, had borne the brunt of the fighting. But for the heroism of these comparatively few English, slightly more than one hundred thousand men, the Germans probably would have marched to the very gates of Paris.But the arrival of the British troops had been timely, and under the gallant command of Sir John French, they had checked the overwhelming numbers of Germans time after time. The bravery of these English troops under a galling fire and against fearful odds is one of the greatest military achievements of the world's history.Slowly, but standing up to the enemy like the true sons of Great Britain always have done, they were forced back. They stood for hours, without sight of the enemy, men dropping on all sides under the fearful fire of the great German guns miles away. While the French, farther south, gave way more rapidly, these few English stood their ground.Time after time they came to hand grips with the enemy, and at the point of the bayonet drove them back with terrible losses. These bayonet charges were things of wonder to Hal and Chester, in spite of the fact that they had been in the midst of similar actions before Liège.As the French and Belgians advanced in a wild whirlwind of fury, the English went about the business of a charge more deliberately, though with the same savage determination. They charged swiftly, but more coolly; gallantly, but more seriously, and the effect of their charges was terrible. The Germans who came on in the face of the fierce rifle and artillery fire, could not face the British bayonets, and time after time were driven back in disorder."
"""It's a long way to Tipperary. It's a long way to go; It's a long way to Tipperary, To the sweetest girl I know. Good-by, Piccadilly, Farewell, Leicester square. It's a long, long way to Tipperary, But my heart's right there!""Liège had fallen before the invading German hosts, though several of the forts still held out; Louvain had been captured and its beautiful buildings burned to the ground. Brussels had been invested by the Teutons. In Alsace-Lorraine the French had been forced to relinquish the spoils won in the first days of the war. General Pau, after a stubborn resistance, had fallen back, and General Joffre, commander-in-chief of the French army, also had been forced to retire.So close to Paris were the Germans now that the seat of government, the day before this story opens, had been removed to Bordeaux. Homes and other buildings in the French capital were being razed, so that the great French guns in the city could sweep the approach to the town unobstructed. Paris, the most strongly fortified city in the world, was being prepared to withstand a siege.And still the Germans came on. Several of the enemy's war aviators flew over Paris and dropped bombs in the streets. This occurred upon several days, and then the French airmen put an end to these daring sky fighters. After this, no more bombs were dropped on Paris.In a final desperate charge, a small body of British cavalry had succeeded in driving back the German vanguard, while the main body of English retired still further. Then this little body of men returned, their number much smaller than when they had charged.For some time now there had been no sign of the enemy, and Hal and Chester, with a small squad, had been sent toward the enemy's line to reconnoiter. It was while on this reconnaissance that they had been attacked by the Germans in force.Slowly the two lads and the eight men, all that was left of the fifty who had gone forth, continued their retreat. They had gone forth on horses; they were returning afoot. Their mounts were in the hands of the enemy. From the rear, in the darkness, still came the sounds of firing.His amazement, slight though it was, proved his undoing. For as he staggered back Hal sprang forward, and the butt of his upraised rifle fell with stunning force upon the German's head. The soldier dropped to the ground with a slight moan.It was true. Ahead of them, in a long line running in each direction, the boys could see figures sprawled on the ground. It was a German force sleeping. There was not the sign of a light, a tent, or a hut. Here and there the boys could make out the dim form of a sentry flitting about."
"""I believe the best way is to try and go right through them without being seen,"" he replied at length. ""There is no telling how far this line stretches out, and if we didn't get around them by daylight it would be all off with us.""The plan was outlined to the men and they went forward. A moment and they were in the midst of the sleeping Germans. It was plain now that the line of sleepers stretched out for some distance, but that it was not very deep. Three minutes undiscovered and they would be through safely.Silently they crept between the sleeping soldiers. There was a certain amount of safety in the very boldness of the plan, for it was unlikely, should a sentry see them moving about, he would take them for English; and even if he did now, they would be able to make a dash with some hope of success. The German soldiers, tired and completely exhausted, slept heavily, and not one so much as moved in his sleep.The little party was now at the last line of sleepers, and just as Hal, believing they had accomplished their difficult task, drew a breath of relief, a form suddenly appeared from the darkness before them. It was a German sentry.Before he could make an outcry Chester and Hal both leaped forward. The former's hands grasped the German by the throat, stifling the sound of his voice, and Hal quickly delivered two hard blows to the man's face. The German fell limply into Chester's arms, and the boy laid him quietly on the ground.Then they moved forward again. The sounds of the scuffle had aroused no one. But suddenly there was the sound of a fall behind. Turning his head quickly, Hal perceived the cause of this commotion which caused such a racket in the stillness of the night.One of the English soldiers had tripped over the body of a sleeping German and had fallen across him. He was up in a moment, but so was the German, sleepily hurling imprecations at the disturber of his slumber.Before the German soldier was able to arouse himself, the Englishman dealt him a heavy blow over the head with his rifle butt. But the noise had brought another to the scene. There was the sharp crack of a rifle, and the English soldier who had caused all the trouble pitched to the ground. To the right Hal and Chester saw another sentry, a smoking rifle in his hands.At full speed the little party, only nine now, dashed forward. The other man lay dead in the German camp. There was a hoarse German cry of command, and a hail of bullets followed the fugitives into the woods. No man fell, though two groaned, and one dropped his rifle. The darkness made accurate shooting by the Germans impossible.Not pausing to return the fire of the enemy, the fugitives stumbled on through the woods. Another and another volley came from the pursuing Germans, but they were firing at random now, and the fact that Hal and Chester had led the way well to the right augured well for their chance of safety."
But as the darkness made accurate shooting by the Germans impossible, so it made speed by the fugitives impossible also. They stumbled along as well as they could, now and then tripping over a fallen limb or tumbling into a hole. Tired and almost exhausted, they at length emerged into the open, and broke into a weary run.Suddenly, in the darkness, they came upon another clump of trees, and as they stumbled into their shelter another volley rang out. One man groaned and stumbled. A comrade lent a supporting hand and dragged him into the woods.The two lads returned to their own quarters and gave themselves up to rest. So completely were they worn out that it was dark when they again opened their eyes; and they probably would not have done so then had not the clear notes of a bugle awakened them.Hal and Chester made their way to the side of General French and joined the members of his staff. The gallant British commander was sitting his horse quietly, his staff grouped about him. Occasionally one went dashing away with some order, as the general gave a laconic command.A moment later and the small though mighty host of Britain was in motion, and a loud cheer rang out on the still night air as the troops perceived that they were going forward--that the retreat had ended.Swiftly and silently the army advanced. Ahead could be heard the crack, crack of rifle fire, indicating that the outposts were engaged with the enemy. Also, from the distance, could be heard the booming of the great German guns, and as the English advanced still further men began to fall before the deadly German artillery fire.But the British did not falter; they plodded on as steadily as before. Then, after two hours of rapid marching, came the sudden command to halt. A moment later and a squadron of British cavalry came into view, retreating before a large force of Germans.Just in front of the infantry the cavalry halted, and turned their faces toward the enemy. The advance of the British so far had not been discovered; but as the pursuing Germans came into view, the command to fire rang out.There was a deafening crash as the British infantry hurled their messengers of death into the compact ranks of the foe; and under this deadly fire the British cavalry dashed forward. Before the Germans could recover from their surprise the English horsemen were upon them, striking, cutting, slashing.It was deadly and terrible work and the English did not go unscathed. But struggling thus, hand to hand, the Germans were no match for the English. Now there came from behind the Germans a large force of infantry on the run, and before these reinforcements the British cavalry was forced to retire.All this was happening right before the eyes of Hal and Chester, in the very center of the British line. On the right and left the engagement was of the same fierce kind, and the deafening crashes of rifles and artillery on either side gave conclusive evidence that the British were engaged with the enemy all along their entire front.As the German infantry advanced in the wake of their cavalry, the British came to sudden life. Flame burst out from all along the center and the Germans recoiled. Volley after volley was poured into the wavering ranks of the enemy, and they turned to flee.
A supporting column was rushed hurriedly to their assistance, and as they advanced the British artillery opened fire. Great holes were cut in the advancing German line, but their advance was unchecked. From their rear reinforcements were coming continually.The fire of the British artillery and infantry was deadly. Men fell by the hundreds, were mowed down like chaff before the wind by the accuracy of the British fire. In the English ranks men also were dropping on all sides, but the gaps were filled up immediately and the British, singing and cheering, continued their advance.The roar of battle could be heard for miles around, but the men engaged in the conflict were unconscious of it. They had but one sense left--that of sight--and their rifles continued to deal out death.But as the English broke into a run to pursue their advantage still closer, they were met with a hail of bullets from a large force of the enemy's infantry which at that moment advanced, in support of their comrades, close enough to come into action. For the smallest fraction of a second there was an awesome silence, and then the British swept forward with a rush. Neither the bullets from the thousands of rifles nor the steady fire from the great guns of the German field batteries checked them.As the British closed upon them, the Germans poured in one fierce volley; but they had no time for more. Down went Teutons and English in struggling heaps, but the British poured over them and continued their deadly work.Now Hal and Chester found themselves in the midst of the battle, in the fiercest of the fighting. Sent forward with orders, they found themselves in the center of the sudden charge. Neither was minded to turn back, but they managed to single each other out and soon were fighting side by side. Blood streamed from a wound in Hal's cheek, where a German bayonet had pricked him slightly. Chester was unwounded.Suddenly Hal found himself engaged with a German officer. With a swift move he swept aside his opponent's blade and felled him to the earth. At the same moment a tall German soldier, thinking to deprive the lad of his weapon, brought his rifle down upon Hal's sword.But the boy's grip was firm and the sword snapped off near the hilt. Quickly Hal sprang forward, and before the German soldier could recover himself, the lad cut him down with his broken sword. Then, stooping, he picked up the sword which had fallen from the hands of the German officer, and sprang to the aid of Chester, who was fiercely engaged with two of the enemy, one an officer, the other a trooper.Now Chester found himself engaged with a foeman worthy of his steel. The latter, a German lieutenant, was pressing the lad severely. At sword play the lad was clearly no match for him. Nevertheless Chester was giving a good account of himself.Suddenly his sword was sent spinning from his hand, and as the weapon came down the point struck a German soldier squarely in the face. Chester's opponent sprang forward, his blade raised for a death thrust. But even as he thrust Chester dodged and the sword passed harmlessly over his head.
"From his stooping position Chester seized the German officer by the knees before he could recover his balance and aim another thrust at him, and, with a quick heave, sent the officer spinning over his head. The German hit the ground with a thud, and as he was about to pick himself up an English trooper ended his fighting days with a thrust of his bayonet.Chester seized the officer's sword and sprang forward into the thick of the conflict again. Side by side, Hal and Chester advanced with the victorious British troops, striking, cutting and slashing their way through the dense bodies of the enemy.Suddenly Chester fell to the ground beneath the feet of the struggling men. A descending rifle butt had struck him a glancing blow on the head. Hal, engaged at that moment with another German officer, saw his friend's plight, and jumped back.With his sword he swept aside a German bayonet which at that instant would have been buried in Chester's prostrate form, but as he did so a heavy blow fell upon the lad's head and he was sent to his knees. Above him, with poised bayonet, stood a German soldier.Death stared him in the face and the boy realized it. It was impossible for him to regain his feet in time to ward off the thrust. Quickly he threw himself to one side, and as he did so the German toppled on top of him, lifeless.""Just in time,"" said Hal briefly, and turned to where Chester was now struggling to his feet; and as the battle raged fiercely about them, unmindful of his own danger, he gave his entire attention to his friend.But now the German retreat became more rapid. The enemy was unable to stand under the fierce charge of the British and they were giving way on all sides. The British pursued the foe rapidly and hundreds upon hundreds of the enemy were cut down in their flight.The dead strewed the battlefield, and as Hal, Chester and Lieutenant Anderson made their way toward the rear, they were forced to climb over the dead and wounded, many with shattered limbs and maimed for life. But the Red Cross was at work, and the wounded were being cared for with the greatest possible haste and gentleness.""That was some fight, if you ask me,"" said Hal to Chester, as they continued their way to the part of the field where they could see General French and his staff, Lieutenant Anderson having left them to rejoin his own men, from whom he had become separated.""I have an important piece of work that must be done, and which will be attended with grave danger; are you willing to undertake it?"" asked the British commander, coming to the point without preliminaries.""Good! The enemy has retreated beyond Meaux. To-morrow I shall try and drive him farther. It is absolutely necessary that our movements be not anticipated. As you see we have lost many officers. I want you to lead one hundred men to a position just this side of the bridge. The enemy must not be allowed to cross. One hundred men can hold the bridge as well as ten thousand. The men to go with you have been selected. They have volunteered for this duty. Captain Lee will show you where to find them. Hold the bridge! That is all!"""
"The two lads saluted and took their departure. They found Captain Lee, and with him were soon at the head of the little band of men who had volunteered to hold the bridge at Meaux against the whole German army, if necessary.It was still dark, and it was a quiet little band that advanced through the British lines to take up their positions at the extreme front. A long range artillery duel was still in progress in spite of the darkness, but little damage was being done by either side.Having retreated beyond Meaux, the Germans had unlimbered their artillery again and the British were replying. The little band of English, with Hal and Chester in lead, advanced to the edge of the bridge described by General French, and there took up their positions.The bridge was very narrow, hardly wide enough for five men to walk abreast. On the British end the approach curved, making it impossible for one coming from the other direction to see what was at the other end. It was indeed a strategic point for defense. The river was high and thus precluded any attempt to ford it.All night long the little band of men lay at the bridge, ready for battle on a moment's notice. All night long the shells of both the Germans and British flew screaming overhead; but none dropped near them.With the first faint glow of the approaching day the little band of British were awake. At Hal's suggestion they cut down trees, and dragged them to the end of the bridge, forming a barricade. Behind this they lay down.Under Hal's direction, a single line of rifles, twenty-five in all, appeared through the cracks of the barricade. The others had been divided into three bodies--each containing twenty-five men--each body directly behind the others. These were instructed to fill up the gaps made by the German fire. Thus, as each man in the front rank fell, his place would immediately be filled by another, the second by the third, the third by the fourth, so providing twenty-five men fell the front line would be still intact, although the fourth line would have disappeared.""There's no use wasting five bullets on each German,"" he told his men. ""Let the five men on the left each pick out a man. The rest reserve your fire unless one of our men go down, then the one nearest him take his man, and so on!""Five shots rang out as they came into view, and again five Germans fell. So far not a shot had been fired by the Germans. But now five more came around the turn with a rush, followed by five more, and still another five.The first five dropped in a heap, but from the second five came a burst of flame and the crack of rifles. Two men behind the barricade dropped, one of whom was Capt. Lee. But the Germans paid dearly for their rash attack.As each German rounded the turn in the bridge his rifle cracked, and continued to crack until he fell. Men inside the barricade also were beginning to fall fast now, and the reserve lines were being drawn upon more rapidly each minute."
"Hal and Chester, crouching down, directed the defense. In spite of the fearful havoc wrought by the British fire, the Germans came on. The bridge was piled high with dead and wounded, but the enemy did not hesitate.Their officers urged them on without regard for life, and bravely went to death with them. Rifles cracked in a steady roar and men on both sides fell rapidly. But each Englishman, sheltered as he was behind the barricade, accounted for at least several of the enemy before he himself went to his death.Now the defenders had dwindled to fifty, and still there was no cessation of the German assault. The heaped up bodies of dead now formed a barricade for the Germans, and they advanced and fell behind them, using their dead companions as shields. Ten or fifteen rows deep they stood behind their dead, and poured volley after volley into the defenders.But he was mistaken; for just as the first German again appeared around the turn, to be struck down by a British bullet, there was a sudden deafening roar from the rear, and turning suddenly Hal and Chester and the few brave soldiers who were left raised a feeble cheer.Leaning heavily on Hal's arm, Chester turned his eyes toward the river bank, which now was lined with British troops, who were firing steadily at forms disappearing on the opposite side of the stream. The approach of the English in force had caused the Germans to beat a rapid retreat. From the opposite shore, however, still came puffs of smoke, and bullets continued to fall among the English troops, and here and there men fell to the ground.With Chester still leaning on his shoulder, Hal led the way, going very slowly because of his burden. Making his friend comfortable under an army wagon, Hal went at once to Gen. French to make his report.He was walking slowly along with bowed head, musing, when he came suddenly into contact with another figure. The man with whom he had collided mumbled an imprecation and violently pushed the lad away, at the same time exclaiming:""Yes; on my way here I accidentally bumped into some fiery French lieutenant. He slapped me across the face and I knocked him down. He then informed me his friend would call on me this evening. That sounds like a duel to me.""""I am afraid it can't. You know these Frenchmen. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to fight about, but I am afraid the Frenchman feels he has a grievance. He'll probably demand a fight or an apology.""""Oh, I guess I can give a good account of myself,"" returned Hal. ""I've been pretty fortunate thus far. I don't figure I am going to fall before any Frenchman's sword or pistol. I'll probably be saved for a German bullet some of these days.""""Look here,"" said Chester, interrupting. ""With the whole German army lined up in front of us, it seems to me that our friend should be able to find all the fighting he wants. This fighting among ourselves is all nonsense."""
"""Fact,"" said Hal. ""I bumped into some little whipper-snapper of a French lieutenant a couple of hours ago. He slapped me and I knocked him down. Now he demands satisfaction, and I am going to give it to him in the morning, at half-past five."" It was hardly light when Chester, who had been unable to close his eyes, aroused Lieutenant Anderson. The two finished dressing before rousing Hal, thinking to give him all the rest possible before waking him up. Finally Chester shook him by the shoulder.Lieutenant Dupree, his two friends and a surgeon were already on the ground when Hal, Chester and Lieutenant Anderson arrived. All raised their caps as they came together. The seconds drew apart to discuss the details of the duel, Hal and Lieutenant Dupree in the meantime discarding their coats and rolling up their sleeves.The French lieutenant was pressing him sorely now. His sword darted in and out with dazzling rapidity, and Hal thanked his stars that he had been fortunate enough to have had some schooling in the use of the foil.Hal contented himself with remaining on the defensive, and not an attempt did he make to touch the Frenchman, although the latter left several openings, only, Hal knew, to draw him on. The lieutenant at last began to grow impatient, and with impatience came carelessness.Suddenly he aimed a fierce thrust at Hal, and the latter only escaped being impaled on the other's sword by a quick leap aside. Before the Frenchman could recover his balance, Hal stepped nimbly forward again, his sword darted out, and the lieutenant dropped his weapon with a muttered imprecation. Hal's point had pierced his arm just below the shoulder.""Don't be too sure,"" replied Lieutenant Anderson. ""He is likely to be more furious than ever, and demand that the fight continue until one of you fall. He must realize that you are no match for him, and he counts on that to give him victory. However, I must say that you have handled yourself well, and, if you keep your head, you may succeed in dropping him.""The lieutenant's predictions proved correct. Lieutenant Dupree had had his wound bandaged, and now demanded that the fight be resumed. Hal was not the lad to protest, so the two were soon at swords' points again.But now both Hal and Lieutenant Dupree fought more warily. Hal could read in his opponent's eyes that he had made up his mind to kill him. Touched once because of his carelessness, Hal knew that the Frenchman would be more wary.In stepping back before a fierce thrust of his opponent's sword, Hal's foot slipped. He threw up his arm, and for a moment was off his guard. Before he could recover his balance, the Frenchman's sword flashed up under his guard and pierced him through the left shoulder."
"The lad staggered back, and the Frenchman, unheeding the accident and the calls of Lieutenant Anderson and Chester, pressed his advantage. With a grim smile he started a thrust that would have ended Hal's days; but, with a sudden lurch, Hal staggered forward, threw up his sword, and, with a terrific stroke, swept the sword from the Frenchman's hand. Lieutenant Dupree was at his mercy.""The best thing you can do now,"" said Lieutenant Anderson to Hal finally, ""is to get a little rest. Both of you are wounded, and will not have to report for duty. I shall tell General French that you will be all right in a day or two.""The object of the boys' conversation was a long armored train, which stood on a siding. It was late in the afternoon, and the two lads, after having taken a long rest, and being relieved from active duty by the express command of General French, had strolled up to the temporary siding, where the huge engine now stood puffing and snorting.It was the first time either of the two boys had ever seen this rapidly moving vehicle of warfare. The open flat cars were protected by thick sheets of steel, behind which were mounted many small guns and rapid-firers.These armored trains already had given good accounts of themselves in other parts of the long line of battle, particularly in Belgium, in the earlier days of the struggle, and were things of terror to the German troops.The train beside which the two lads now stood was ready for instant action. The gunners were at their posts, ready to go forward at a moment's notice. The engineer and firemen stood beside the huge engine.In the distance the sound of firing could be heard, and occasionally a shell burst close to where the boys were standing. But they had been through their baptism of fire, and paid little heed to these messengers of death.""Yes,"" agreed Hal, ""and it is easy to see that among light armed troops they could do great execution. It would even take very heavy artillery fire to make an impression on those steel sides. Besides----""A crowd of troopers, who had been idling about a few yards from the train, disappeared with the deafening report, and when the smoke had cleared away they were nowhere to be seen. They had been blown to atoms.The boys rushed forward, but, even as they did so, they halted at the sound of a sudden cry, and, turning their faces up the track, they beheld a mounted officer galloping swiftly toward them. An officer dropped off one of the cars of the train, which, fortunately, had not been touched by the explosion, and hurried to meet the newcomer.""You are ordered to proceed forward at once under full speed,"" was the command. ""The Tenth Royal Dragoons are hemmed in by at least 10,000 Germans two miles ahead, and unless you arrive in time they will all be slaughtered.""""Great Scott!"" exclaimed the officer. ""Then what am I to do? Hicks was the only engineer with us right now. The others have gone to their quarters, and by the time I could get them here it would be too late."""
"He turned and rushed hurriedly back to his car, while Hal and Chester leaped aboard the locomotive. In response to a signal, Hal released the brakes, gently opened the throttle, and the great engine began to forge slowly ahead.Gradually the lad opened the throttle wider, and the huge locomotive commenced to gain momentum, until at last it was rushing along like some mad thing. Chester, in the meantime, was busy with a shovel.A moment, it seemed to the two lads, and the sound of firing rose above the roar of the locomotive, and the spat spat of bullets against the armored sides could be heard. But Hal did not falter. Rather, the engine seemed to leap ahead with even greater speed.From the rear came the signal to slow down, and, under Hal's firm hand, the terrific speed of the train was checked. Then also from the rear there came the sound of firing. The rapid-firers on the train had been unloosed, and their leaden messengers were spelling death in the ranks of the Germans, of whom the train was now in the middle.A short distance ahead he could make out a small knot of British, almost surrounded by Germans. The British had taken their stand directly on the railroad track, the most strategic point for miles. A clump of small trees screened them from the enemy on one side, but from the other three directions the Germans were pouring in their deadly fire.The British troops stood gallantly to their work, and returned volley for volley. They fought on doggedly. Suddenly the armored train shot up the line which the British were holding, and Hal brought it to an abrupt stop.Right and left the train poured in broadsides of machine-gun fire, mowing down the Germans at every yard. The Germans fell in heaps, and, as if by a miracle, both sides of the track were suddenly lined with high piles of the dead.But the success of the British was destined to be short-lived. Hal and Chester, in the cab of the locomotive, had just raised a loud cheer when there was a terrific explosion, followed by a thundering crash, and both lads were hurled violently to the floor of the cab.Chester, with blood flowing from a gash in his forehead, was the first to pick himself up. In falling his head had come in contact with a sharp projection of some kind. He was terribly dizzy, but his head was still clear. The engine rocked crazily as it dashed along, and the boys hung on to whatever offered for dear life. Around curve after curve they shot with a lurch, the locomotive threatening at every turn to leave the rails.""What! and leave the engine in the hands of the enemy? Not much. Besides, I am certain the British must control this road at the other end or it would have been destroyed by this time. We'll just keep on going and see what happens."""
"The locomotive was going more slowly now, Hal always keeping a keen eye ahead. For perhaps five minutes they rode along without incident; then suddenly Hal, without even a word to Chester, ""opened her up"" again.Apparently the Germans were unconscious of the approach of the locomotive, for they did not even glance in its direction. Troopers stood beside either side of the track, and several groups were standing between the rails.The great locomotive caught them as they attempted to jump from the track, and hurled them in all directions. Hal and Chester ducked low inside the cab, and it was well that they did so; for, as the engine shot past, hundreds of bullets sped through the cab, and hundreds more flattened themselves against the steel-protected sides. It was close work, and no mistake.Both lads were silent for a time, as the locomotive continued on its way. It was getting dusk now, and Hal was forced to reduce the speed of the engine even more. They went slowly along, both lads keeping a wary eye ahead for Germans.Slowly and cautiously Hal made his way along the track. As he moved stealthily around a curve in the road the cause of the explosion became apparent. It was even as he had feared. His quick wit had detected the meaning of the explosion and none too soon.Just ahead, where a short time before had been a bridge spanning a deep chasm, there was now nothing but space. The bridge had been blown up. Had Hal applied the brakes to the engine one minute later, in spite of the fact that it was traveling very slowly, both boys probably would have been carried over the embankment to certain death; for it is doubtful that either, in the darkness, would have noticed the absence of the bridge in time to leap to safety.And now Hal could make out a number of rapidly moving figures. To his dismay, he saw that they were moving in his direction. He turned quickly and ran back to the locomotive, where Chester was anxiously awaiting his return.Hal once more jumped aboard the locomotive, unheeding Chester's cry of wonder, released the brakes, and threw the throttle wide open. Then he dropped sprawling to the ground, while the engine dashed madly down the track.The words were hardly out of his mouth when the truth of them was proved. As they emerged from where the trees were thickest into a little clearing a sudden, guttural command brought them to an abrupt stop. Caught thus unexpectedly Hal immediately threw his hands above his head; Chester followed his example. It was plain to both lads that there was not a chance in a thousand to escape, for the German soldier had his rifle pointed squarely at them.Of course there was a possibility that by a sudden spring one of the lads might have succeeded in knocking the man down; but this probably would have meant the death of the other. Hal and Chester both realized that it was no time to take such a chance.""Well,"" said Hal, ""we were accidentally carried through your lines by a locomotive which we happened to be running when the rest of the train was blown up. We couldn't get back, so we went ahead. We finally lost the engine, so we were making our way back to our own lines."""
"""You did, eh?"" said the German officer. ""Well, I shall attend to your case in the morning. Orderly! See that these prisoners are carefully guarded, and have them brought to me the first thing in the morning. Perhaps they may be induced to give me the information I require.""""I'm sure I don't know,"" was Hal's reply, ""but I am afraid we are in for it this time. I have never taken much stock in the tales I have heard of the barbarous treatment of the Germans toward their prisoners, but one look at the general's face was enough to convince me that he would stop at nothing to gain his end.""Chester rose and started to walk around the tent. In the darkness he stumbled over something and fell to the ground. Arising he reached in his pocket and produced a match. A tiny flame lighted up the dark interior of the tent, and the lad stepped back with an ejaculation.Hal produced one, and, taking it from his friend's hand, Chester stepped to the back of the tent. Quickly he opened the blade, and made a neat incision in the canvas, finally cutting out a little square. Then he put his eye to the hole and peered out.They were not even challenged as they sped through the camp, turning this way and that, and they had passed beyond the last row of tents before a hubbub from the rear told them that their flight had been discovered.But they did not diminish their speed. Rather, if anything, they pedaled faster; and then the outpost came into sight--a long line of men, almost in front of them. Some were pacing to and fro, while others sat upon the ground.The riders were upon them before they knew it, and two flying bicycles sped between the German troopers. A cry of ""halt!"" went unheeded, and the Germans, quickly bringing their rifles to their shoulders, sent a volley after the lads.But neither was hit. In the darkness the Germans were unable to aim carefully. The boys heard the hum of bullets around them, but they did not falter. There was no second volley, for the lads had disappeared in the darkness, and the Germans were not minded to spend their ammunition foolishly.Chester was hardly a second behind him, and the two lads were again riding madly along the road. Fortunately there were many curves in the highway, and this fact prevented their pursuers from sighting them from any great distance.The spot where they had alighted was in the midst of a clump of trees, and quickly the lads drew their bicycles in among them, hiding them from sight of the road. Then Hal turned, and, with Chester close behind him, dashed back in the direction from which they had come, taking care to keep well within the shelter of the trees."
"And now Chester made out the object of his friend's wild dash. It was a farmhouse, setting well back from the road. Chester had not detected it as they sped by, but Hal's keen eyes had singled it out as a possible refuge.""We'll have to take a chance of the occupants being friendly,"" Hal told his friend, as they ran toward the house. ""If they will allow us to hide here until night, we may be able to get back to our lines safely.""""No, madam,"" Hal undeceived her, ""the English are not coming--yet. We are trying to make our way back to our lines, but a German motorcycle squad is after us. We have come here to see if you will hide us until nightfall.""A few moments later and they were safe in a little room at the very top of the house. After showing them to their retreat, the good woman departed, saying that she would return in a few minutes with water and food.""But we have searched every place else,"" came another voice, speaking in French, but with a heavy German accent. ""They must be here. We found the bicycles a short distance from this house, and have scoured the woods. They must be here.""Then came the sounds of heavy feet tramping through the house. Hal and Chester were both wide awake now and lay silent, listening. For an hour the heavy footsteps continued to ring through the house, and there was the sound of slamming doors and moving furniture.""I'll have a look for myself,"" came the reply, and heavy footsteps ascended the stairs into the room directly beneath Hal and Chester. There came to the lads' ears the sounds of heavy blows against the floor on which they lay. Evidently the German officer was making sure that there was not an opening in the ceiling of the room below. But after a while he desisted. The boys heard him descend the stairs, and a few moments later the sound of his voice:Further conversation was interrupted by a sound of some one at the trap-door. Chester and Hal both jumped to their feet, and stood ready above the opening in the floor to seize the intruder should it prove to be an enemy.""No, indeed; we can never thank you enough,"" agreed Hal. ""Had it not been for your kindness we should have been in the hands of the Germans right now, and there is no telling what they might have done to us.""""Just so he does his duty I shall be satisfied,"" said the woman, who now introduced herself as Mrs. Madeline Dersi. ""He has been a very wild boy, but I am sure that his heart is true and that he will fight to the last for his country, as did his father before him.""Mrs. Dersi was across the room in a moment, her arms wrapped about the newcomer. Tears streamed down her face, as she repeatedly kissed the young man, who seemed to take no great interest in the procedure."
"""Mrs. Dersi,"" said Hal, ""we have decided that it probably will be better for us if we take our departure at once. I am sure there are no Germans near right now, and the sooner we get started the sooner we shall reach our own lines.""Mrs. Dersi offered further objections, but at length, seeing that they were all in vain, she bade the two lads a sorrowful farewell, enjoining them to be sure and look her son up and to return to see her should the opportunity offer. This they gladly promised, and, leaving the friendly shelter of the good Frenchwoman's home, continued on their weary journey toward the British lines. Each boy put his best foot foremost, and they traveled at top speed. They wanted to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the house where they had so lately found shelter, for there was little doubt in the mind of either that young Dersi was a traitor, and that he would soon put their erstwhile captors on their track again.Nor were they wrong; and, had they but known what they learned later, they would have sought shelter almost anywhere rather than continue their journey afoot. Even now the same band of German motorcyclists who had given chase the night before were again in pursuit. But now, instead of an even dozen, there were thirteen. For Young Dersi himself was with them.""Well, mother,"" he said, ""I have accomplished my mission. I have learned the strength of the German army, and am now returning to my own regiment. But what of the two lads who were here? Have they gone? If not, we can all continue our journey together.""The good woman pointed out the road taken by Hal and Chester, never thinking for an instant that her son meant to harm them. A moment later young Dersi left the house; and soon the Germans were once more upon the trail of the two lads.Hal and Chester hurried along as fast as their legs could carry them. It was now nearing dusk, and with each forward step they knew that they were that much closer to a place of safety. Darkness fell and still the two lads plodded onward.At length, coming upon a small brook beside the road, they stopped to quench their thirst. Hal had risen to his feet and was waiting for Chester when from the rear once more came the faint ""chug-chug"" of a motorcycle, or motorcycles, the boys were unable to tell which.Side by side the two lads sprinted for a clump of trees almost directly ahead. They reached their friendly shelter just before the glare of a searchlight down the road gave evidence of the approach of their pursuers.""We must be very careful,"" Hal warned Chester. ""When they fail to overtake us they are sure to return. When we hear them coming we'll climb up a tree, or hunt a hole, or something. But we might as well go ahead as far as we can.""They had not detected from which direction the bullet had come, and for that reason were at a great disadvantage. Crouched close to the ground they waited, ears strained for a sound by which they could locate the man who had fired."
Hal had hardly taken his position behind the tree he had selected for his own cover when a second sharp crack of a rifle broke the stillness of the night, and there was a flash of fire hardly fifty feet from him.On hands and knees Hal made a short detour and approached his enemy from behind. Now he was hardly ten feet from the man, who loomed up like a giant in the darkness. Hal rose suddenly to his feet, and, as he did so, he stepped on the fallen limb of a tree.The man did succeed in raising his rifle above his head, and he now attempted to bring it down on the lad's head. But Hal was too quick for him. Stepping in close, he struck his opponent a stinging blow in the face, and at the same time seized the rifle barrel with his other hand.As the man staggered back, Hal wrenched fiercely on the rifle, and the weapon came away in his hand. But the man was not badly hurt by the force of Hal's blow, and he suddenly dropped his hand to his belt. A moment later and the naked blade of a knife gleamed in the night.Hal saw his enemy's move and sprang back. But the man was after him in an instant, his knife raised to strike. They were too close together for Hal to bring the rifle to bear upon his enemy, and, realizing that he probably was no match for his opponent, the lad suddenly turned and ran.But it was not Hal's intention to run very far from his enemy. He was not that kind of a boy. His idea was to get far enough ahead of the man so that he might turn and shoot him. But as he ran he felt a gust of air pass his ear, and he heard the sound of something whizzing by him.In spite of the fact that his assailant had attempted to murder him, Hal could not find it in his heart to kill him in cold blood. Therefore, even as he turned, he raised the rifle high above his head, and, holding it tightly by the barrel, rushed upon his enemy.In vain the man threw up his hands to ward off the blow. The force behind it was too great. Hal, wheeling half around as he swung, brought the heavy butt of the rifle against the side of the German's head with a crack. The man dropped limp at the boy's feet.Hal lowered his rifle, and stood for a moment over his fallen enemy, wiping his brow. Then he stooped over and relieved him of his other weapons, two automatic Colts. These he slipped in his pocket, and once more turned his face toward the spot where Chester lay, unaware of the terrible fight that had just occurred.Hal turned in the direction of the flash of the rifle, and, scarcely taking time to aim with his newly-acquired automatic, fired. His effort was rewarded with a howl of pain, but, as the lad started to run to where his fallen friend lay, there was another shot, and Hal felt a bullet whiz by his head.But the latter was not to be caught thus easily. Evidently he had heard of such subterfuges before. Hal waited patiently for some moments, and then, as there was no sign of his unseen enemy, he crawled slowly toward the spot where Chester had fallen.
"What was his surprise to find that Chester was not there. For a moment Hal was stupefied, but his amazement was brought to an end by a low whistle, and, looking to the right, Hal beheld his friend behind a large tree.Hal started to protest, but, before he could utter half a dozen words, Chester had disappeared in the darkness. Hal lay in silence for some time. Finally, putting his cap upon a stick, he poked it cautiously out from behind the tree, where it was silhouetted against the opening between the trees.Once more he raised his cap on a stick and moved it about. Again there was a sound of a shot. But, even as the bullet sped by, there was a second report, and Hal heard his friend's voice raised in almost a shout:Thinking that the man was shooting at his friend, being unconscious of the ruse Hal was employing, Chester immediately turned his own weapon loose upon the man, whom he could now plainly see. But, after firing, the enemy had shifted his position slightly at the very moment that Chester fired. Therefore, he escaped what otherwise would assuredly have been a death wound--for Chester was a crack shot--and received the ball in his pistol hand.Hal's first leap bore his opponent to the ground, where the boy twisted one hand around the man's throat. But, if he thought to overcome his opponent thus easily, he had reckoned without his host. Lying almost at full length on the ground as he was, he drove his fist straight upward into Hal's face. The lad released his hold upon his enemy's throat and fell back.With this he sprang upon Hal and bore him to the ground. But the lad was not to be thus easily conquered, and, with a mighty effort, wriggled from beneath his assailant and sprang back to gain a breath.But aid came from an unexpected source. Chester, who had been lying unconscious up to this time, now recovered sufficiently to take in the situation about him. In his hand he still grasped the automatic.This he brought to bear, and an instant before Dersi's finger pressed the trigger, Chester fired. Dersi fell to the ground with a groan. His revolver exploded as he fell, and the bullet whistled close to Hal's right ear.Hal did not leave his friend for a moment until Chester announced that his head had cleared up sufficiently for him to stand. With Hal's assistance he struggled to his feet, one hand holding the side of his head.""Do not tell mother I died like this. It would break her heart. She thinks I am a soldier of France. And so I was,"" and his voice became stronger, ""until I fell in with evil companions. Then I began to gamble. I lost. I needed money. When the war broke out, I was offered a chance to cancel all my debts, if I would deliver certain plans to the Germans. I did. Then I was discovered."""
"""I was caught in the act of taking papers from my superior's coat, which he had laid aside. I was court-martialed and ordered put to death. Through the connivance of another who was associated with me in this piece of treachery I managed to escape. He is high in the confidence of General Joffre.""""Then do not tell my mother of my treachery. Tell her that I died in battle, fighting for my country, and that I was game to the end, as you Americans say. Will you do this for me, one who has sought your death?""""I wouldn't have her know for all the world. I was always wild, but who would have thought that I would be a traitor to my country? When you see General Joffre, tell him at once what I have told you concerning the traitor. Immediately, do you understand?""Cautiously the two lads made their way through the woods. They could hear the sound of their pursuers, but they had little fear of being detected in the still uncertain light, as long as they kept the same distance between themselves and the Germans.But suddenly a gleam of light showed in the forest. A German soldier had flashed a pocket searchlight, and the glare of it fell squarely upon the crouching lads, before they could step behind a tree or any other place of refuge.Chester needed no urging, and also took to his heels. But their presence had been discovered, as was proved by the sharp crack of a rifle. Neither boy was touched, although the bullet passed uncomfortably close to Chester's head.Stumbling along as fast as the semi-darkness would permit, the boys made a brave effort to escape. But they were not to get off in such easy fashion. For again the searchlight lighted up the woods and exposed them to their pursuers. Both lads threw themselves to the ground, and thus avoided the volley of shots that were fired at them.As Chester dropped, he heard a startled exclamation from his chum, and, glancing quickly about, he could see no sign of him. The lad was non-plussed, but, before he could so much as move, he heard Hal's voice, apparently below him:Cautiously Chester moved in the direction of his friend's voice. But he was not cautious enough, and a moment later, grasping out wildly for some means to stay his rapid descent, he was sliding down what seemed to be a steep embankment.Now, Hal, moving his position slightly, felt a space behind him, and crawled slowly backward, where the darkness seemed greater, pulling Chester along after him. They continued this crawling for some minutes. Finally, raising his head, Hal dropped quickly again with a muttered exclamation.In arising his head had come in contact with something above him. Raising an exploring hand, he investigated. He touched a rock above. Then he reached out on each side. As he had surmised, only a few feet each way were solid walls."
"""We are cooped up in a cave. If the Germans are wise enough, after they learn where we are, they will just sit down on the outside and starve us out. But, if they try to come in--well, I don't think they will get very far, as long as our cartridges hold out. You wait here until I see how far back this thing goes.""Chester obeyed, and Hal continued his exploration. For two or three minutes he crawled along, and then, turning a slight bend, gave a sudden exclamation. He had come upon a possible means of exit, for, apparently, the cave had two openings.Slowly Hal led the way along the low passageway, and, reaching the opening again, poked his head out. This time he was doomed to a disappointment. Hardly had his head emerged from the hole in the ground when he drew it in quickly again.Slowly Chester crawled away. Reaching the opposite end of the cave, he cautiously poked his head out and looked around. In the dim light he could see no one. But he was afraid to call out to Hal--his voice might be overheard--so he took his tedious way back to where he had left his friend.They crawled back along the dark passageway as rapidly as the darkness and the condition of the ground would permit, but before leaving their place of refuge, Chester thought it advisable to peep out once more.""Well, I guess the best thing to do is to wait and see what happens. Perhaps they may leave before broad daylight and not discover this cave. In that case we shall be safe enough. Now you stay here and guard this end, and don't move unless I call. I'll do the same at the other end.""He had gauged the distance to a nicety, and before the German could cry out, one of the lad's hands sank deep into his throat. But the latter was a powerful man and not to be overcome easily. He hurled the lad from him with a quick shove, at the same time twisting on the wrist of the hand that gripped his throat.The pain was almost unbearable and Hal was forced to loosen his hold. But again the lad sprang, before the German could take the offensive, and this time struck out fiercely with his right fist. The German uttered a cry of pain, and with one hand delivered a smashing blow at the face so close to his own.But Hal had figured on this move and had calculated the time of the blow perfectly. With a quick movement of his head he avoided the huge fist, and there came a terrific howl of pain from the German. The blow had passed over the lad's head and the German's fist had crashed into the solid wall.This sound spurred Hal to greater activity, for he realized now that their presence had been discovered by those on the outside. He felt certain that the sound of the shot would probably bring new visitors into the cave from the end he was supposed to guard."
"He was rewarded by another groan of anguish and a moment later by the sound of a falling body. Quickly the lad leaped forward, his weapon held ready to strike again. But there was no need of a second blow. The German was unconscious.At length he came to the end of the passageway, and pushed his prisoner out. Even as he did so a bullet whistled by his head and he heard the crack of a German rifle. Hal lost no time in getting back into his hiding place.There was a terrific roar that echoed and reechoed through the passageway, a howl of pain and then silence. For a moment Hal waited, for he did not wish to be caught napping. Then he slowly made his way forward. Presently he came in contact with a man's body. It was the enemy.A German, walking past at that moment, struck a match to light a cigarette, and Chester's form was clearly outlined in the glare of it. With a hoarse guttural exclamation the German dropped his match and cigarette and brought his rifle to bear.Chester, well back in the cave, judged his pursuer's distance by the sounds of his awkward movements. He waited until the German got well within the cave, then raised his automatic and quickly fired twice.There came a groan of pain from the opening to the cave, but the exact result of his shot Chester could not determine. The light had disappeared and the cave was again in darkness. Hal, at his end of the cave, having serious business of his own to attend to, had not heard this last shot.For hours, it seemed to both boys, they lay there silently, save for an occasional shout to the other, when the darkness of the cave began to give way to a faint glow of light. The sun had arisen, and each boy, at his own end of the cave, breathed more freely. Gradually it became more light and at length a beam of sunlight shot into Hal's end of the cave. But still the lads kept silent vigil, being afraid to leave their places of concealment, and believing that the Germans on the outside were still on the watch for them.Nor were they wrong, for at both entrances to the cave, or at least standing nearby, were two groups of German soldiers, patiently waiting for the boys to emerge from their retreat. The Germans rightly surmised that they would not remain idle long after daylight.""I don't know,"" replied Hal. ""The Germans may have gone away, but I believe they are still loitering on the outside. However, this inaction is getting monotonous. We've got to do something, and we've got to do it right away.""""Well, suppose we make a dash out of this end, shooting as we go. Those guarding the other end will naturally think we are trying to escape, and will come to the aid of their companions. Then we can run back into the cave, crawl through as rapidly as possible and make a run for it out the other end."""
"The automatics of both lads spoke simultaneously and continued to spout fire for several seconds. Then they turned and ran hurriedly back to the cave, into which they disappeared before their startled foe could realize what had happened.With all possible haste the lads crawled through the passageway, and soon emerged at the other end. But now caution was thrown to the wind, for the lads figured that the Germans left to guard this end of the retreat were by this time on the way to aid their companions.Now they came to a clearing in the woods, stretching out for perhaps 200 yards, and the end of this another dense forest. They started across the open ground at a run, for they had no mind to be overtaken by the Germans where there was nothing to offer protection.They had almost reached the forest on the other side and each was mentally congratulating himself upon giving the pursuers the slip when a shot rang out from behind, and a bullet cut the ground beside Hal.""Quick!"" said Hal, and increased his pace, swerving from side to side as he ran, making it difficult for the Germans to aim accurately. Chester did likewise, and soon they were safe once more beneath the protection of the great trees.But now that they had been discovered, the lads knew that it was to be a race for life. They knew that it was but a question of a few minutes until the remaining Germans would again mount their motorcycles and give chase. Also they realized that their chances of eluding their pursuers were much more slight in broad daylight than they had been in the darkness.Therefore they ran at top speed. While they were not afraid and had not lost a whit of their nerve, they realized that discretion was the better part of valor, and their feet continued to hit the ground at breakneck speed, until again came to their ears the first faint sounds of the pursuing motorcycles. Gradually the sounds became more distinct, this telling the boys that their pursuers were gaining rapidly, although the rough condition of the ground made it impossible for the motorcycles to travel very fast.Finally, when he could run no more, Hal threw himself to the ground, and Chester immediately followed his example. For a few moments they lay there, panting, their tongues literally hanging out like worn out dogs.Then they sprang to their feet again, and making an abrupt turn to the right plunged into the underbrush right where it was the most dense. Here Hal espied a large tree, with low hanging branches. With Chester by his side he rushed for it.For a moment the Germans glanced about hurriedly, seeking out their prey. Then they sprang behind trees themselves, their rifles ready to fire. They had not yet discovered the boys' hiding place, and were fearful of a shot from ambush.Chester fired at the same moment as did Hal, and a second German clapped his hand to his head and reeled. But before the other pursuers could raise their rifles, there came from ahead a sound that brought a loud ""Hurrah"" from Hal and Chester, and a moment later, on the dead run, came a small body of British infantry.""Well, I am glad we arrived so opportunely,"" said the officer, laughing a little. ""We heard shooting in this direction last night, but we did not get an order to advance until this morning. As you may perhaps have surmised, we are part of the advance guard of the army.""""Exactly,"" replied the British officer. ""We are not far in front, and are pushing slowly along, that we may take the Germans by surprise, if possible. Perhaps you may have gathered some information as to the German position and strength?"""
"The lads thanked the officer, and soon the little troop was on the advance again. Hal and Chester resumed their journey in the opposite direction. For an hour they hurried along, occasionally meeting a detachment of mounted troops going forward, but they had traversed at least five miles before they made out in the distance the first long line of the British advance.It was indeed an imposing sight, this long line of khaki-clad men, marching rapidly toward them, and Hal and Chester were not unmindful of it, and their hearts swelled with pride at the thought that they themselves were a part of this great fighting machine.They hurried on toward the advancing army. Already the lads had been challenged several times, but upon explaining their predicament had been allowed to continue on their way. Now they reached the first line of the advancing host, and an officer hastily rode toward them.The officer did as requested and the lads made off in the direction he indicated. It was fully two hours later before they were admitted to the presence of the commander-in-chief of the small though mighty host of Britain.""And so you are the two who created such havoc in the ranks of the enemy,"" he exclaimed when Chester had concluded his account of their adventures. ""I learned through some of my scouts that a wild engine had dealt a heavy blow to the Germans, but I had never thought that you two were aboard it.""""Then I would suggest that you send word of General Tromp's treachery to General Joffre by special messenger, and not trust to the field wireless, for in that way Tromp might learn that he was suspected and make his escape.""Hal and Chester saluted and took their departure. Having done as the general ordered, they lost no time in returning to him. General French had already prepared his dispatch and this he placed in Hal's hand.""General Joffre no doubt will be amazed at the contents of this message,"" the general told the lads, ""and he probably will demand all details from you. Tell them to him as you have to me and I am sure he will be convinced. That is all, except that you return as soon as possible, for I may have other work for you.""The two lads saluted and started forth on their journey. Both had been furnished with good horses at the command of the general, for they had asked for these in preference to being carried in an army automobile.It was a long, tedious ride, for the French general, that he might have perfect quiet in which to make his plans and direct the movement of the French forces, had made it his custom to remain well in the rear of his army. And here, the following day, the lads found him, and upon informing his orderly that they bore important communications from General French, were admitted to his presence at once.The French commander-in-chief sat at a small desk, surrounded by members of his staff. Hal and Chester drew themselves up and saluted; then the former advanced and placed the document in Gen. Joffre's hand.""I must act at once,"" said the general, again half to himself. ""Never would Tromp have a better chance to work treachery to our cause than at this time. I must stop him, and I must do it personally and without publicity, for should this become noised abroad throughout France, nothing could prove more detrimental to our cause."" So this is how it transpired that Hal and Chester, two American boys, happened to be present at an interview between the commander-in-chief of the French army and General Emil Tromp, an incident that has never been told, and never will find its way into history; an interview between a gallant French officer and another who, were his actions known, would be likened to the greatest of American traitors--Benedict Arnold.Hal and Chester found ample time to take an inventory of the general's car. It was a huge machine, and besides being fitted up luxuriously was also furnished as an office, that the general might still be at work while he hurried from one part of the field to another when events demanded his immediate presence. Even now, with treachery threatening, and whirling along at a terrific speed, General Joffre, probably because of habit, fell to work sorting papers, studying maps and other drawings."
"The orderly saluted and dashed away. General Joffre paced up and down nervously. Finally, at the approach of rapid footsteps, he raised his head. A group of officers were approaching. One of them advanced right up to the general and saluted, and even as he did so the sound of a bugle rang out, ordering a general advance.""I accuse you,"" continued General Joffre, ""of being a traitor to France. I accuse you of aiding and abetting the escape of another traitor, one Dersi. And I also accuse you,"" and here the general pointed an accusing finger at General Tromp, ""of even now playing into the hands of the enemy by ordering an advance, when you knew very well that such an advance could mean only the extermination of our troops.""""I do,"" said the general quietly, ""upon the advice of General Sir John French, who vouches for the truth of their story. Besides, your actions just now have convicted you. Come, Tromp, further denial is useless. Dersi has confessed.""""Exactly what I say,"" was General Joffre's chilling reply. ""You have your choice. Either the way I mean, or to be publicly hanged as a traitor. If possible, I desire to avoid publicity. Which shall it be?""""It shall be as you say, sir,"" he said calmly. ""You are right. I am a traitor. I would not have been, but--but--well that makes no difference now. You shall see, sir, that I am no coward. I am not afraid to die. Neither need you fear that I shall not do as you command. Thus shall I atone for my sin.""The car sped away. That evening, while Hal and Chester stood beside General Joffre, back again in his headquarters, an orderly rushed into the tent, and forgetting the formality of a salute in his haste, went up to the general and thrust a paper into his hand. Hal and Chester accepted General Joffre's offer of an automobile to make their return trip, which consequently did not consume as much time as their journey to the headquarters of the French commander-in-chief.Meanwhile, what of the great driving movement of the allied forces, which after checking the vast German horde almost at the gates of Paris, had forced the foe back mile after mile without cessation? A word of the situation is here necessary."
From the first moment when the allied armies had assumed the offensive, after being driven back for days by the Germans, they had continued their steady advance. Such fighting as the world had never known was in progress continually, for the Germans contested every inch of the ground.Time after time the Allies threatened the German lines of communication, and the Germans were forced to fall back to protect them, or to be cut off and eventually annihilated, or forced to surrender. The strategy of General Joffre, condemned by many in the earlier days of the war, now was beginning to bear fruit, and he was praised on every hand.The English, under the command of Sir John French, the chief stumbling block in the path of the Germans as they advanced on Paris, were proving their mettle every day. Despite their numerical inferiority to the enemy, they stood bravely to their herculean task, until now the whole world realized that they were the real fighting strength of the allied army.Each day found the Germans farther and farther from the walls of Paris. Each day found the Allies pressing the foe more closely. The great battle line, stretching out for more than 200 miles, was in constant contact with the enemy. Almost hourly there was such severe fighting as in former wars would have earned the designation of battles. But along this great line they were but skirmishes.The losses on both sides had been tremendous, although the Germans, because of the fact that they had been previously on the offensive, and also because of the massed formation they had used in their advance, had suffered considerably more than the Allies.Louvain and other towns in Belgium had been sacked by the Germans, pillaged with fire and sword, until hardly one stone was left upon another. And now the fighting was again in Belgium, that little buffer state which, ever since she became a nation, has always been the battleground of European wars.The Belgian army, in spite of the terrible havoc wrought upon it by the heavy German guns, was still fighting desperately and had no mind to withdraw from the conflict. Possibly Belgium had more at stake than any other country in the war. She was fighting for life and freedom--from possible absorption into the German Empire.And now the German forces had been pushed clear across the River Marne, where they were making a determined stand. The eastern shore of the little river was held by the Kaiser's troops, the western shore by the Allies.So here the great armies now paused for a moment to take a much needed breathing spell. For the moment the fierce advance of the Allies was checked. Tired men sank to the ground in the ranks, there to remain until the battle should be resumed.But over all still was heard the roar of the great guns. The artillery continued in action, as it had ever since the two great armies had come into contact with each other. Shells dropped and burst among the troops on both sides of the river, blowing men to atoms; but still the main portions of the armies rested on their arms, awaiting the word to move forward again.The fire of the German artillery was hourly creating great havoc in the allied army; but in spite of their great guns, the greatest ever known, their execution had been no more terrible than that done by the smaller guns of the Allies; for the fire of the British gunners was far superior to that of the Germans. Few shells were wasted, while, up to this time, the comparatively poor marksmanship of the German gunners was the cause of much comment and surprise.So now, when Hal and Chester once more returned to their own posts, they found the two great armies lined up on either bank of the Marne; or rather some distance from it, only the outposts of either army occasionally riding right up to the river's edge, while the great shells continued to burst on both sides of the river.Hal and Chester sought out Lieutenant Anderson, whom they found after a long search. Through an orderly they also reported to General French, apprising him of where to find them should he desire their presence. After a short talk with Lieutenant Anderson, who had insisted that they make free use of his quarters, both lads turned in, for they had been many hours without sleep, and were tired out.
"""You two lads already have been of invaluable service. Perhaps I should not again call upon you so soon, although I know your hearts are in the success of the arms of France and England. But you have so often proved your fitness for dangerous missions that you seem the ones needed.""""What I must know,"" said General French, ""is the approximate strength of the enemy on the other side of the Marne, the positions of his troops and so on. I could ascertain this possibly by means of the flying corps; but in that event the enemy would know that I had learned. It must be done some other way. Are you lads willing to undertake this task?""""Oh, well,"" laughed the lieutenant. ""I have seen considerable action. I don't suppose I should complain. But how do you propose to gather this information? I suppose you realize that you have quite a sizable job on your hands?""""I believe that I should not go alone, were I in your place. The enemy will be constantly on the lookout for spies. My plan would be to make quite a detour along the river, crossing by a bold dash and riding right into the heart of the enemy's country, at whatever point it might be practically unprotected.""Half an hour later Chester and Hal inspected the men selected by Lieutenant Anderson, to whom the boys were introduced as scouts. A likely body of men they were, strong and sturdy, and not a man of them under six feet in height.The place where Hal had ordered the men from the car could not have been better selected, for, on the opposite side of the river, though Hal did not know it then, there was a considerable open space between the German forces.The troopers followed the lad to the bank of the river, and then, as there was not a shot from the opposite side, all walked boldly along the shore. At length they came upon a number of small boats, evidently having been placed in readiness by some of the British forces.The men piled into the boats, and pushed off. They reached the opposite side without discovery, and hastily clambering up the bank were soon hidden from sight in a clump of trees. Here Hal called another halt, until he was able to decide upon his next move.The boats had been pulled into the trees, to be used for their return trip. The driver of the auto truck was ordered to remain where the party had left him. All in readiness for a hasty retreat, Hal now bethought himself of a way to successfully accomplish their mission.The latter had not seen them, so quietly had they crept along. Hal, Chester and Lieutenant Anderson were upon them before they knew it, their men right behind them. Seeing that they were far outnumbered, the Germans did not put up a fight.Quickly the three mounted, and marching the soldiers on ahead of them started north, bearing off slightly to the east. For an hour they continued their journey, passing now and then a body of German troops. But they were not molested, not even challenged."
"""It can't be very far,"" the woman replied, ""for some of the officers often come here to eat. They say that they like my cooking better than the regular army fare. I wouldn't be at all surprised if some of them were to come along soon.""""By Jove! I never thought of that,"" said Hal. ""I believe you have hit it. That is where they are making their plans. I wonder""--and he grew greatly excited. ""I wonder if by any chance the Kaiser could be in that party.""""He is probably pretty near the whole party,"" said Lieutenant Anderson dryly. ""Kaiser Wilhelm is no coward, and if his staff is there, this close to the British lines, the Kaiser is probably there also.""""No you won't,"" said Hal, positively. ""The rest of you will stay here. If I should get into any trouble, I shall fire my revolver, and then the rest of you can come up. The six of us will be a match for them, the Kaiser included.""""I had thought of that,"" replied Hal, ""but something tells me it can't be done--a hunch, if you like. I have a feeling that if we attempt such a thing our whole expedition will go wrong. I can't explain just what I mean, but I feel it.""He made no attempt at concealment as he walked along, for he knew that such an action, should he be seen, would be suspicious and would probably mean an unsuccessful termination of his plan. He had little fear of detection, clothed as he was in a German uniform.Quickly he grasped the edge of the sill, and exerting great strength slowly and cautiously drew himself up. The window was open, and the lad put one leg over the sill. A second later he sat in the opening, and then disappeared inside the house.Very cautiously he ascended the steps. Remembering the exact location of the dining-room, the lad sought out the room above it. There, at one end of the room, he found what appeared to be a little closet.Hal ran an exploring finger over the floor of the closet. His finger felt a little hole, and changing his position the boy saw a very small opening in the floor. He put his eye to the hole and peered down, and as he made out the figures in the room below he chuckled softly to himself. In spite of the fact that Hal had sure sense that Emperor Wilhelm would be in the room below, he felt a peculiar thrill creep over him as he made out the imposing figure of ""The War Lord of Europe."" He whistled softly to himself."
"His fingers tightened on the trigger, but for a moment only. Then he lowered his weapon, and a moment later dropped it back in his pocket, while he wiped away little beads of perspiration that had gathered on his brow.""We will make a strong showing on the eastern shore of the Marne,"" he said, ""and will retire slowly before the British. As they come on, flushed with apparent victory, Von Kluck will take them on the left flank. We shall cut them to pieces.""""Good; but you say it is impossible for you to be ready until the day after to-morrow. In that event, we must hold the English in their present positions at all costs. A premature advance on their part, while we would undoubtedly repulse it, would mean the ruination of our coup. See to it, gentlemen, that there is no leak.""""Very well. But I had had my mind set on being in Paris long ere this. Had it not been for the interference of these English--and these starving Belgians, I would be there now,"" and the Kaiser's voice grew harsh. ""They must be crushed,"" and he struck the table a heavy blow with his clenched fist.Hal waited patiently for perhaps half an hour, and then, feeling certain that the coast was clear, emerged from his hiding place. He was just lowering himself from the window by which he had entered when, from almost below him, there was a loud scream.Glancing down, Hal beheld the pale face of the woman who had given them food only a short time before. Fearing that the Emperor and his officers might be attracted by her screams, Hal dropped quickly to the ground, and an instant later had his hand clapped over the woman's mouth.Chester, Lieutenant Anderson and the three troopers were running toward him as fast as their legs would carry them, closely pursued by a band of mounted Germans. Even at this distance Hal could make out the forms of Count Von Moltke, and, yes, Emperor Wilhelm himself!With the high German officers came a little troop of mounted soldiers, evidently, Hal thought, an escort, that had been left some distance behind while the Emperor and his officers discussed their plans in the farmhouse. In all, there were twelve horsemen dashing after the fugitives.Now his friends came up with him, and Hal, believing as did his friends that discretion was the better part of valor, also turned and ran. Several shots rang out, but none was touched and they did not pause to reply.But help came unexpectedly. Bristow, the man who had been left in charge of the little band of English, hearing the sound of firing, had crawled forward to investigate. He made out the figures flying toward him and recognized them instantly; also, he saw the pursuing horsemen.""No,"" replied Hal. ""In this German uniform I believe I shall be perfectly safe on this side, and I am going to try and gain further information. It may be that I can learn something that will be important.""He espied a small squadron of Germans approaching him at a quick trot. Making sure that his revolvers were ready for instant action, the lad trudged bravely on. The mounted troops passed him at a distance of perhaps a hundred yards, and the officer in command waved his sword in greeting as they went by."
"He approached boldly and soon mingled with the German officers, who were taking life easy, war, seemingly, being far from their thoughts. The place, to Hal, looked as if it might be a drill ground, with a large body of troops on parade.""Either they mistake me for someone else, or they are a very pleasant and courteous set,"" the lad told himself. ""However, I didn't come here to learn how they behave themselves. I won't get any information this way. I wonder who is in command here, but I can't afford to ask.""""Oh,"" continued the German. ""Then perhaps you know that Von Kluck, Von Moltke and the Emperor himself had a brush with a bunch of British or French spies a while back. The Emperor was much put out. He believed that information of an expected coup had leaked out, so all generals were hurried back to their posts to see that everything was shipshape.""Quickly he sought out a quiet spot, and broke the Imperial seal. It was even as he had expected--only more. For the papers contained the present troop positions, their expected movements and the number of men and how stationed.It was growing dusk, and as Hal walked along toward the outposts in the direction from which he had so recently come, he whistled blithely to himself. It was a mission well done, and the lad, although by no means egotistical, was well aware of it.He passed the farthest outpost of the camp unchallenged, and made off in the darkness. Then, still feeling safe in his German uniform, and more confident at having not been recognized during his stay in the German camp, he paid no heed to footsteps that were now approaching. Before Hal could recover his composure, which had left him at being so suddenly accosted, the woman had thrown her arms around his neck, pinioning his hands to his side. He tried to shake himself loose without hurting the woman, but so tight was her grasp that he was unable to do so.The man who was with her came to her assistance, dodging around the struggling pair with his revolver reversed, held ready to strike. But the woman herself prevented this, for he was unable to bring the butt of the weapon down on the lad's head without the imminent risk of injuring the woman.It came at last. Suddenly hurling the woman violently from him, Hal leaped forward and, catching his opponent off his balance, struck out swiftly with his bare fist. There was a sharp ""spat"" and the man fell to the ground.Hal turned to run, but found himself opposed by the woman, who pointed the revolver at his head. She held the weapon in a steady hand, and the lad realized that a miss at that close range was utterly impossible.His nimble wit was at work as he walked along, and he finally hit upon a plan. It was not without danger, but the lad figured he might just as well be shot then and there as to be put to death as a spy.Unable to tell whether he had really tripped or whether it was a ruse, she stood undecided a moment. That moment proved her undoing. For Hal, spinning on his heel, swept the revolver from her outstretched hand, and with a quick leap seized it himself."
"""Now, madam,"" he said calmly. ""I shall give you just thirty seconds to get away from here. If you have not put a considerable distance between us by the time the thirty seconds have expired, I shall be forced to use this weapon, much as I should dislike to shoot a lady. I am on important business and it brooks of no delay. Neither shall one life stand in the way.""He stepped quickly forward, and feinting with his left, drove his right fist squarely into the German's mouth. It was more than flesh and blood could stand, and once more the German toppled to the ground, where he remained, unconscious.He walked slowly along the bank, keeping a keen eye out for any kind of a craft in which to make the trip. He could find none; but, from the direction of the great German camp, came the sound of excited voices and the trampling of many feet.""The woman is a spy herself, that's my belief,"" said a second. ""She has concocted this story as an excuse for her being abroad at this hour. I certainly don't believe there is a spy on this side of the river.""Hearing the words, Hal took a long breath and sank from sight. It was well that he did so promptly, for a brilliant shaft of light flashed across the water, making it as bright as day. The German swept it back and forth across the water. He could see no one.Hal remained under the water just as long as he could and came to the surface as the Germans turned to walk off, ready to take another quick breath and dive again. But seeing no sign of the searchlight, he rightly concluded that the Germans, who had been but half-hearted in their search anyhow, had gone.He approached to within a few yards of the figure before his presence was noted. Then the sentinel, for such he proved to be, hearing footsteps behind him, turned suddenly and leveled his rifle at Hal.""Well,"" said the sentinel, by no means assured that Hal was what he represented himself. ""I'll let the colonel decide that point. March ahead of me now, and mind, no tricks, unless you want a bullet in your back.""""My name is Paine,"" he informed the colonel. ""I have been across the river within the German lines on a mission for General French. I have accomplished it and was returning when this sentinel accosted me. I can show credentials,"" and he showed the officer a pass signed by the commander-in-chief.""Thanks,"" replied Hal. ""I am. But I haven't very long to stay. Please have the car ready as soon as possible. And if you can spare a driver I shall be glad of his services. I don't believe I could drive the car any great distance."""
"Wrapped tightly in a great fur overcoat that the officer had insisted on lending him, Hal snuggled back comfortably in the large automobile as it sped over the ground toward General French's headquarters.The chauffeur was a speed demon and the huge machine covered the ground much more quickly than the one in which the little party of British had started on their mission. It was not long, therefore, before the lad found himself descending from the car. Another moment and he once more stood before his commander.""You have done well,"" he said quietly. ""I shall not forget it. You may go now, for I doubt not that your friend is greatly worried over you. I will say this: You have rendered an invaluable service to England--one that the King shall hear of. I have already taken steps to thwart this German coup, and if we are successful the credit will be mainly due you.""""That is true,"" replied Chester, ""but just the same if ill befalls him I shall feel that I am partly to blame. Besides, we had the information we went after. What had he to gain by staying and putting himself in the enemy's power?""Almost completely exhausted, the three were soon slumbering deeply. The day's work had been strenuous indeed, and there is no telling how long they would have slept on had not the sound of a bugle, calling ""To arms!"" roused them.The first glimmer of the morning sun appeared over the horizon as the command for a general advance rang out. Slowly at first, then faster, the great British fighting machine moved on, squadron upon squadron of cavalry leading the way.There were no bridges across the little river, nor were there boats enough to carry the army across. But under the direction of skillful engineers, the best in the world, pontoon bridges sprang up as if by magic. Before the Germans were fully aware of what was going on, several thousand men had been hurled across the little stream.These--advancing in the face of the overwhelming force of Germans, rushed forward to check them--fought off the enemy while other British troops were poured over the Marne. Desperately did the Germans try to drive them back. Time after time they charged, only to be hurled back again by the British horsemen, and the infantry that now had had time to form after crossing the river.Artillery was brought into action to force the British back across the little stream. But it was no use. The Germans had been caught unprepared. Already Gen. Von Kluck had weakened his defense by sending some of his men south to take their places in the force with which the Kaiser and his generals expected to execute their great coup.Evidently the danger of a sudden attack had not been anticipated by the German general staff. That the British, without the support of their French allies, farther to the south, would take the offensive, was a factor that had apparently been overlooked."
The surprise was practically complete. The British army on the continent at this time numbered slightly more than 100,000 men. Probably two-thirds of this whole force was hurled across the Marne in this battle, which, starting as a skirmish, soon grew into one of the fiercest and bloodiest struggles of history.Scotch Highlanders, Irish troops, Sikh legions, recently arrived from India, British troops from other of her foreign possessions and the English themselves stood shoulder to shoulder, fighting nobly and driving back the foe.For seven solid hours the battle for the opposite shore of the Marne continued, both sides fighting desperately and heroically. Then, as the Germans continued to retreat, General French called a halt. The British fell to work digging trenches in the recently won ground, and preparing to resist an attack should one be delivered.This first skirmish on the eastern banks of the Marne, while possibly unimportant, when viewed in the light of later events, became one of the greatest factors in the offensive movements of the Allies.Now that the English had obtained a foothold upon the opposite side they did not relinquish it, in spite of heavy assaults made by the Kaiser's troops in the days that were to follow. Passage across the stream for the rest of the allied army was now comparatively easy, for the English, already having a foothold, stood ready to drive off the Germans as reinforcements crossed.And if the action at the Marne was one of the deciding factors in the offensive movement of the Allies, the credit of it is undoubtedly due largely to Chester and Hal, who, at the risk of their own lives, enabled the British troops to catch the Germans in their own trap.That the boys' value in this important battle was recognized, is evidenced by the fact, that, when the army once more had come to a halt, General French summoned the two lads to him, and with a hand on the shoulder of each, and his whole staff grouped about him, said: It was two days later. The battle was raging fiercely. On all sides men were dropping singly, in pairs, in tens and in hundreds. Since early morning, when an advance guard of Germans had approached the British line, the struggle had continued without a minute's breathing space.Gradually giving way before the English attacks, the German troops fell back mile after mile, the English, in the section of the field where the fighting had been going on, pursuing them closely. Unmindful of their support on either side, the British still pressed forward, until now they were far beyond either flank.Before the officer in command could give the order to fall back, a force of Germans was hurled into their rear, completely cutting them off from any possible hope of aid from that direction. A thousand men were in this little force now completely surrounded.But the officer in command of the British was not of the caliber to surrender. He was a typical son of Albion, a fighting man, none other than Captain Harry Anderson, whose part in the expedition across the Marne had raised him to that rank.Advancing with his command, he soon found himself the ranking officer still on his feet. Hal and Chester, who the night before had shared his quarters, at the call to arms had plunged into the thick of the conflict alongside the gallant captain. In spite of the terrific carnage, in spite of the shot and shell that fell about them, they had so far escaped injury.Men dropped as though mowed down by the wind, but the little column halted not. They had spread out, fan-wise, at the command of Captain Anderson, to avoid as much as possible the sweeping fire of the Germans, and they now pressed forward at a run.Completely surprised at this sudden charge by the little body of men, that the German officers evidently believed entirely in their power, and still more surprised by their desperate offense in the face of overwhelming odds, the Germans, for a moment, gave way.That moment was enough for the success of Captain Anderson's strategy. At the point of the bayonet the British burst through the German line, dealing out death on every hand as they did so. A moment and the Germans rallied, but it was too late.
"Directly ahead was a large house, and for this refuge the British dashed madly. The first man to reach the door tried the knob. The door was locked. From behind came the plod of the heavy German feet and the sharp crack of rifles.There was not a moment to lose. With a swift blow of his rifle butt, the British soldier smashed in the door, and into this opening the troops poured. A second squad had dashed around to the rear of the house and performed a similar operation. In less time than it takes to tell it injured and uninjured alike were in the house. The ground outside, however, was strewn with their companions.""I'm not banking much on that,"" replied Captain Anderson, ""for, if we are missed, our loss probably will be put down to the fortunes of war. It is hardly possible General French would know we are cooped up in this house.""His place was quickly taken by another, and the battle went on. The firing became fiercer with each passing moment. The British barred the windows with chairs, tables, and whatever other articles of furniture they could find, leaving an opening just large enough to poke their rifles through.But even this was not enough to keep out all the German bullets. Still men fell, though not as fast as before. Captain Anderson assigned Hal to direct the fire of the British in the front of the first floor and Chester in the rear. The captain took command of the second floor himself.The three were everywhere encouraging the men, seemingly being all over their respective stations at once. Occasionally, as a man fell, Hal or Chester would step into the breach and hold the place until relieved by another soldier.Noon came and went, and still the fighting continued. Apparently, thus far, the Germans had not conceived the idea of battering the house to pieces with their big field guns. Evidently they thought they could take it without this trouble.And now darkness drew on. The German fire had played havoc with the defenders, but, if they had suffered severely, the enemy's loss, exposed as they were to the grilling fire from the house, had been enormous.Night fell, and with it came a lull in the firing. Hal took advantage of this respite to hurry upstairs for a word with Captain Anderson. As they conversed in low tones, they were startled by an outcry from the floor below.""I was hiding in the cellar,"" said the man in a shaking voice. ""When you English burst in I didn't know what to do. I remained in my hiding-place until there was a lull in the fighting. I was afraid I would be killed if I was found, so I tried to get out the first time I thought I had a chance."""
"""A nice specimen of a Frenchman, to be sure,"" said the captain, with a sneer. ""If you are such a peace-loving man, how does it happen we find you here? Why haven't you fled with the rest of the old women and children?""""And you call yourself a Frenchman,"" he said in contempt. He took a threatening step forward. ""No,"" he said angrily, ""there will be no pay, but I can promise you that if you don't tell what you know you will be shot right here and now.""""The Germans are planning an aëroplane raid on the English,"" said the man, in a low voice. ""There is a park of aëroplanes hardly two miles from here, on the road leading to Viviers. They are ready for instant flight.""""Simply this,"" said Hal. ""I believe that by a dash we can get through the Germans. They will not expect it, and, if they did, would not expect us to go forward. Consequently, the guard in front is not likely to be vigilant. We have enough men here to make a successful raid on these machines and destroy them."" Quickly the captain formed and outlined a plan. Then, gathering his men behind him at the door, he prepared for a sortie. Among the troops were a few engineers, the captain ascertained upon inquiry, and these he placed at the extreme rear of the little body.When all was ready, the captain opened the doors and stepped out. Hal and Chester were right behind him. It was very dark, and, as there was no light in the house, Germans who were on guard, being a considerable distance back to avoid the fire of the British defenders, did not at first make out the forms flitting silently from the house.Half the little troop had emerged before a single rifle shot, followed by a volley, gave notice that they had been discovered. Then, at a word from Captain Anderson, the British charged right at their enemy.Not a shot was fired until they were at close quarters, in spite of the fact that the German fire was not ineffective. Then, as the men spread out in a long line, they blazed forth their answer, and, hard upon this, charged with the bayonet.The Germans in flight, Captain Anderson, Hal and Chester soon found the Viviers road, and led their men along at double time. The two miles were covered quickly, and finally the three could make out in the darkness what appeared to be a factory. Closer approach showed that this what it was.A rapid-fire gun stationed near the automobiles opened fire. The first column of men was literally annihilated, Captain Anderson himself going to the ground with a severe wound in his chest. Not one of the troopers reached the automobile."
"Seeing what had happened to the first column, Hal and Chester were more wary. They approached from two directions, and, before the machine-gun could be turned upon them, were at hand grips with the enemy.Both sides were fighting in small groups, and at once began a fierce interchange of shots at a distance of fifteen yards. The airmen, who were crouching along the edge of the road, answered the British fire with great bravery and vigor.While this fighting was in progress, the detachments of engineers, which had been in the extreme rear of the British columns, armed with improvised tools, hurled themselves upon the aëroplanes. With sure blows from their rifle butts, and whatever other implements they could lay hands on nearby, they destroyed the motors, the gasoline reservoirs and the running gear of the German machines.While the little column commanded by Chester now withdrew a short distance, the lad having ordered this in the hope that he might find Captain Anderson still alive, Hal, with the comparatively few remaining men, advanced to one of the armored automobiles, in which stood a German officer, directing his men.The officer opened fire on these few British with an automatic revolver. Two men fell. Hal felt a bullet graze his arm, but not before he had discharged his own weapon against the chest of his opponent, who fell to the ground, fatally wounded.A second German, whom Hal had not noticed in the machine before, brought his rifle butt down over Hal's head. But the lad's quick eye had seen the descending weapon, and his upraised arm warded off the blow. His left arm, however, fell to his side numb, and he stumbled and fell to the ground.He was up in a moment, and sprang upon the German, one arm still hanging by his side, and his revolver gone. The German brought his rifle to bear, but, stepping quickly forward, the lad struck up the weapon, even as the German pressed the trigger.With a quick leap Hal was in the automobile, and was grappling with the German trooper. The German, unable to use his rifle at such close quarters, struck out with his fist. Hal dodged and his opponent drew back with a cry of pain. His fist had struck the steel side of the car, and his arm was now useless.The two were now on even terms. The German reached out and attempted to entwine his fingers in Hal's throat, but the lad was too quick for him. Dodging suddenly, he came up under the other's chin, and sent him spinning head over heels from the car, so fierce was the contact.Then the lad turned his eyes to other sections of the field. He could see no signs of an enemy. Evidently the Germans had had enough, or were awaiting the arrival of reinforcements before renewing the fight, for they had no way of determining the strength of the British attacking party.In any event, Hal realized that there was no time to lose. Leaping from the car, he ordered the few men who were left to man the waiting automobiles, quickly ascertaining that there were enough men capable of driving them. Then he set out to hunt Chester and Captain Anderson.""Follow me, single file,"" he called to his men, ""until I give the word to close up. Then range right alongside of me. We will go as swiftly as possible, and try to get through the German lines without a fight, if by any chance it is possible. However, if we have to make a quick dash and fight, it would be better to do it side by side, and plow right into the enemy. Do you understand?"""
As the five automobiles, containing not more than a hundred British all told, approached the center of the German force, each man determined to get through to the allied lines or to die in the attempt. Swiftly the high-powered armored motor-cars rushed on, drawing closer and closer to the solid ranks of the enemy. Not expecting trouble from within their own lines, the Germans were not on the lookout for this spectacular dash, and so were caught unprepared.The Germans lay sprawled about, the close formation having been more or less broken following the morning fight. The five speeding monsters were upon them almost before they realized it. As the cars approached the first irregular line of troopers, the British in the machines opened fire. In spite of their terrific speed, their aim was good. Germans tumbled right and left, or fell back as they attempted to rise.But now the Germans opened fire, and, in spite of the fact that the speed of the flying automobiles made accurate shooting impossible, the British did not escape scot-free. Three men in one of the machines to the left of the one driven by Hal dropped their rifles and sank to the bottom of the car. In one on the opposite side a soldier threw up his hands and tumbled from the car.Suddenly the car nearest the lads on the left swerved, and almost bumped into them; in fact, would have done so, but for Hal's promptness in turning slightly to the right. The driver of the car had been struck by a German bullet and killed.The driverless machine, swerving suddenly to the left, leaped forward ahead of the others, turned suddenly to the right again, and plunged straight toward the dense masses of Germans, the British inside still shooting as calmly as though they stood on firm ground, although it was plainly evident to them that the wild car was carrying them to certain death.Plunging straight into the dense masses of Germans, the gallant machine leaped upon them like a thing of life, hurling them off on all sides, and running amuck over their prostrate forms. Then, with another sudden turn to the left, it sped directly toward a group of officers, who stood nearby directing the firing. So sudden was this unexpected turn that the officers were run down before they could move from their tracks.It was a fatal move, for a German gunner sprang forward--there was a fearful roar--a loud explosion, a cloud of smoke, and, when the smoke had cleared away, there was no automobile to be seen--nothing but wreckage and a few maimed bodies scattered about.But Hal and his companions were having troubles of their own. Even at the moment that the first car disappeared in smoke, the driver of a second sprang to his feet, waved his arms about, as he wildly gasped for air, and tumbled overboard. The machine, now wild, turned and crashed into its nearest neighbor.There was a terrific crash, and both cars turned turtle. Came a cry of triumph from the Germans, but Hal and the driver of the other remaining car paid no heed; rather, if possible, their cars leaped ahead faster than before.But the herculean task the lads had set out to accomplish was too much. In spite of the fact that the Germans had been taken by surprise, their numbers were so great that the success of such a dash was impossible.A blow from the butt of a German rifle knocked the driver of the second car from his seat as he swept past, and the machine, turning round and round, like a huge top, suddenly turned over, pinioning its occupants beneath it.Fearing that all would be killed if he did not stop the machine, the lad threw off the clutch and applied the brakes. Then, in the center of a large force of Germans, who came rushing in upon them, the lad stood up in the machine, and, raising his uninjured hand, shouted:Hal did as commanded, and a moment later Chester also was on the ground. Turning back to the machine, they tenderly lifted Captain Anderson out and laid him on the ground. He had fainted during the wild ride.
"Standing beside the German commander was another officer, somewhat younger, recognizing whom, Hal's heart leaped into his throat. This second officer was none other than the man who, some days before, had placed in Hal's hands dispatches for General Von Kluck--papers that, through Hal's bravery, had been turned over to General French, and had thus foiled the coup planned by the Kaiser himself.""This,"" said the German, pointing to Hal, ""is the young man to whom I told you I delivered the dispatches intended for you. He represented himself to me as Captain Dersam, of your staff. Later we found Captain Dersam gagged and bound on the banks of the Marne. Therefore, this officer must be a traitor."" ""Yes,"" continued the Emperor of Germany, ""the boy is right. He has spoiled our plans, I will admit; but it takes a brave man to wander into our lines as he did. It takes a brave one to have made a dash in the armored cars I have just witnessed; and it takes a brave man to raid right into the heart of our arms and destroy twenty-five aëroplanes, as I have no doubt he did.""""The lad is perfectly right when he says that he was not captured in disguise. No doubt he was within our lines in German uniform, but, as he was not captured, he cannot be executed as a spy. Do you understand?""""It seems to me,"" went on the Kaiser, ""that rather than spend so much time looking for spies to put to death, it would be advantageous if some of my officers would expend their energies in looking more carefully after my interests.""""I have found that all the British are brave,"" said the Kaiser grimly. ""I was misinformed as to their attitude in this crisis,"" and the Kaiser's voice grew harsh; ""it was not the only subject on which I was misinformed.""""I suppose that is true,"" said the emperor, ""and still there are many more persons of German descent in the United States than of any other nationality. Do the people of the United States believe that Germany brought about this war?""""It is not true,"" thundered the Kaiser, bringing his clenched fist down heavily on the table. ""I tell you it is not true. Do you understand? It is not true. I did all in my power to prevent this war. It is Czar Nicholas of Russia who is to blame. He and his Slavs would overrun Germany. But, with the help of God, I shall prevent it. I will not be called the War Lord of Europe for nothing!""Hal and Chester were startled at this sudden outburst. Neither realized that Hal was, perhaps, the only person who had dared to stand before the German monarch and tell him to his face that he had not the sympathy of the whole world, and that he was held responsible for the greatest war of all history.Suddenly he ceased talking, and turned to the table, where he was soon engrossed in looking over some papers and maps. So he sat, utterly disregarding the presence of the two American boys; nor did they venture to interrupt his profound study, until two hours later General Von Kluck sent the guard ordered by the Kaiser to take them away. When the officer in charge of the squad made known his commission, the emperor signified his consent with a nod of his head. He addressed no further words to Hal or Chester."
"""Well,"" said Chester, ""they have got us this time, and I don't see any way of escape. Here we are, right in the heart of the German army, and we might just as well be in the Sahara desert, as far as our chances go of getting back to our own lines.""""Well, you can't tell,"" said Hal. ""We may be able to give them the slip. However, I would be opposed to any plan that did not have a good chance of success. For, if we failed, I am sure they would shoot us without compunction.""""Well,"" said Hal slowly, ""I believe, in the first place, that he takes himself too seriously. I believe that he considers himself the chosen instrument of Heaven to put down the Slavs, to say nothing of the French and English. He has the mistaken idea that he is a man of destiny.""""You are to remain here for the next few days,"" he informed them. ""As the emperor has interested himself in your behalf, General Von Kluck is awaiting further word from him as to what to do with you. Right now the emperor will not talk. He is busy with his maps and papers, and, when he is busy, no one dare disturb him."" It was indeed a sad word to the ears of the two young American lads. As Hal said, they had had trouble enough getting out of Berlin at the outbreak of the war, and had almost been forced back to the German capital once before. To be prisoners of war in Berlin certainly would be an inglorious finish to their military careers.But it seemed that the lads, if they had any hopes of escape, were doomed to disappointment. They were carefully guarded, and, while they were made comfortable, there was never a moment that they were not beneath some watchful eye.Several times they were allowed to leave their canvas prison and stroll about outside, but on each of these excursions the German officer in whose custody they had been placed accompanied them; and finally from General Von Kluck came the order for them to be sent to Berlin.""I sort of hate to see you go,"" the German officer told them, upon informing them of their fate. ""We have gotten along famously together. However, I am sure you will be well treated in Berlin, and that when you are released at the end of the war you will be able to deny some of the tales of German cruelty to their prisoners.""Accompanied by their guard the boys once more started on an excursion through the huge German camp. For an hour or more they walked about, discussing the war in its various phases, but finally the officer told them that it was time for him to report for duty, and they started back toward their temporary prison.""He must be one of your French war dogs,"" said the German with a laugh, quickly withdrawing his hand. ""We have captured a large number of them, and, in spite of the fact that we treat them as well as we know how, they will have nothing to do with us.""At that moment another German officer approached the trio, and, as he came closer, the dog snarled and showed his teeth. The German drew back his foot, and, before anyone could interfere, kicked the animal sharply in the ribs.But the German paid dearly for this act, for, with one quick bound, the dog leaped upon his assailant, and, snarling fiercely, bore him to the ground. Hal, Chester and their officer friend jumped quickly forward, and, after a sharp tussle, succeeded in dragging the dog off, though not until he had considerably shaken up his victim, even drawing blood from a wound in his throat."
"With a fierce imprecation, the German reached for his revolver, drew it quickly, and aimed it at the dog. But, before he could pull the trigger, Chester leaped forward, and, with a quick movement of his arm, knocked the weapon from the German's hand.The lads did not notice this, however, until they had entered the tent, and then Hal espied the nose of their newly-found friend poking its way in after them. A moment later and the dog was curled up at one side of the tent, sleeping.He bowed and left the tent. Hal and Chester now turned their attention to the dog, which still lay sleeping. Chester whistled sharply. The dog was on his feet in a second, ears cocked and sniffing the air eagerly.Chester called off the many dog names familiar to him, and Hal added a few. But, although the animal wagged his tail with evident pleasure at thus being talked to, he gave no evidence of owning any of the names in the boys' vocabulary. By dint of persuasion the German officer succeeded in gaining the consent of General Von Kluck to allow the boys to take the dog with them. That Marquis was just as pleased to go as the boys were to have him, was plainly evident. When they left their tent for the last time, and whistled to him to follow, he bounded after them with enthusiasm.The train on which the boys were to be taken back to Berlin did not leave until well along toward midnight, but, with some 5,000 other prisoners, British, French and Belgians alike, they were bundled aboard early. Heavily guarded, and without a weapon of any kind or description, there was no fear of a break for liberty, in spite of the large number of prisoners.The lads were shoved into a car already loaded down with prisoners and took their positions at the far end, the dog between them. In spite of misfortune, the prisoners all were far from unhappy. They joked and chatted as though they were on a pleasure trip.The trip was necessarily slow, for the train, time after time, was switched on to a siding to permit of the movement of German troop trains carrying soldiers from the western theater of war to the east, or from the east to the west.Consequently, it was late the following night when the train finally pulled in, and the prisoners were ordered to get out. Under the leveled rifles of a strong German guard, they stepped to the ground, and, after being divided into squads at the direction of the German officer in command, were marched away.""I hope so,"" replied the German, and continued: ""I am going to arrange for you to come with me--yes, and the dog, too,"" as he saw Hal glance at his canine friend. ""You can tell me stories of the war. Besides, I am interested to know how it is that two so young should have seen so much fighting.""""Oh, well,"" said the German, with a laugh, ""it doesn't matter. There is no chance of your getting out of Berlin, anyhow. However, since you refuse, it will be necessary to keep more careful watch over you.""""It certainly does,"" said Chester, with a smile, for he had at that moment recognized the spot where he, Hal, Lieutenant Anderson and Captain Derevaux had met for the first time--the spot where the French and British officer had been set upon by a gang of young thugs.The lads followed their captor up the steps, and into a prettily furnished hall, where a servant, summoned by the officer, hurried away with word for Mrs. Strauss, for, as Lieutenant Heinrich Strauss, the officer now introduced himself to the boys.Before either the young lieutenant or his mother could reply, there came a heavy footstep without; a moment later the door was thrown quickly open, and a German officer, huge in stature, and imposing in his uniform, draped with gold and lace, strode in. At sight of the two boys he came to a sudden pause."
"""Enough,"" said the general in a softer voice, his eyes twinkling although this he endeavored in vain to hide. ""You mean that you are up to some of your old tricks--that your sympathies have gotten the upper hand of your better judgment. Do you know what I should do with you, sir?""""I should have you court-martialed for disobeying the command of your superior officer. But I won't do it this time. However, it is a very good thing that our emperor--God bless him--is a very good friend of your father. Otherwise----"" Upon the two following days Hal and Chester, in company with the young German lieutenant, viewed the sights in the German capital. Instead of the peaceful, pleasure-loving city of their vacation, it now bore naught but signs of war.Officers in automobiles, afoot and on horseback, were rushing hither and thither continually. Troops were moving through the streets of the city upon every hand--some preparing to entrain for the west, and some for the east, where even now it was known that the great hordes of the Czar of all the Russias were approaching as fast as their vast numbers would permit.And something did turn up, though it was nothing the lads could possibly have anticipated. As they walked down the street a squad of German soldiers approached, in their center a man in civilian clothes. Lieutenant Strauss and the boys approached them.The guards lifted the two to their feet, and once more the prisoner was closely surrounded. Lieutenant Strauss now signified that he desired no further information and the squad of soldiers marched away, the prisoner meantime hurling epithets at the two lads.Chester, the little piece of paper still clutched in his right hand, was now impatient to be where he could read it, and for that reason pleaded fatigue. Stealing a moment when the lieutenant's attention was directed elsewhere, he slipped the paper into his pocket, as he feared that, upon close scrutiny, the lieutenant might see that he was concealing something in his hand. ""For the success of military operations in the western theater of war, it is essential that the Russian campaign be pushed with immediate vigor, particularly in the north. Knowing that we are all working in sympathy and accord, without awaiting an answer, I take it for granted that this suggestion will be acted upon.""""Some kind of a seal, it looks like to me,"" he said, after a careful scrutiny. ""By Jove, I have it! It's a secret sign, that's what it is. The man for whom this is meant will undoubtedly recognize it.""""No,"" said Chester, ""I can't. But something has got to be done. I imagine that General French and General Joffre figured that it would be delivered without fail. Either the messenger did not take the route as commanded, or it was believed safe for him to go by air in a sudden dash.""""I don't know,"" said Chester. ""That's up to you. My job, and a much harder one, it seems to me, is to appropriate one of the general's big maps, so that if we do succeed in getting out of Berlin, we shall know where we are going."""
"Since the two lads had been guests, or prisoners, in the Strauss home, a detail of soldiers had been stationed around the house, with orders not to let either of the lads pass unless accompanied by either the lieutenant or the general. The boys had been given the freedom of the house. The lieutenant had demurred at the placing of a guard around the house, saying that there was not the slightest chance of the boys escaping, anyhow, but the general had held out on that point, remarking:Using his knife as a screwdriver, he removed the hinges from the door. A moment later he was inside the closet. Quickly selecting two of the lieutenant's uniforms, he laid them on a chair, and hurriedly put back the door and tightened the bolts.When Chester entered the general's private room, which he found unlocked, he went straight to the general's desk. He knew that maps and valuable papers were kept there, because the general had once referred to them as being there while at supper.The desk was locked, but this did not disconcert the lad, for he had expected it would be. Drawing a small buttonhook that he always carried from his pocket, he inserted it in the keyhole. After several unsuccessful attempts the lock finally turned, and Chester quietly threw up the top.Walking to the door and making sure that no one was near, the lad returned to the desk. Quickly he looked over the assortment of papers, and at length a smile lighted up his face. Evidently he had found what he was in search of, for he quickly thrust a paper in his pocket.There was the sound of a door slammed on the floor below. Quickly the lad closed the desk, and, walking softly to the door, peered out. There was no one in sight. Closing the door quietly behind him, Chester walked rapidly down the hall to his own room, where Hal was waiting for his return.Chester glanced around the room. He walked to the closet and opened the door. Peering in, he found, just above the top shelf, a small opening, apparently not meant for use, as it was too close to the ceiling.""The general always leaves his sword and revolvers on the table in the hall before retiring,"" said Chester. ""Then I noticed another pair of swords hanging on the wall there. Also the lieutenant invariably leaves his weapons on the parlor table. Careless, I say, but lucky for us.""Chester's thoughtfulness in hiding the articles they had appropriated stood them in good stead, as it turned out that evening. General Strauss, upon his arrival home, went straight to his private office, saying that he would be in to dinner in a few moments.""Nor I,"" said the general slowly. ""Can it be I was mistaken? Perhaps, after all, I did leave the maps at headquarters."" He turned to Hal and Chester. ""I hope you will pardon me for my outburst,"" he said gravely, ""but I am easily excited."""
