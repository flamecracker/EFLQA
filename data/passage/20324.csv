passage
"""No, she only spoke,"" drawled Grace Ford, extricating herself from a mass of bright-colored cushions on the divan, preparatory to joining in the conversation. ""I ask you, Mollie, did you ever know Amy to say anything important?""""Why, I'm just plain homesick,"" said Amy, adding quickly, as the girls looked at her in surprise. ""For Camp Liberty and the Hostess House, you know. I miss the work and the long hours of entertaining and cheering people up. I feel,"" she looked around at them as though finding it hard to explain just what she meant, ""sort of--lost.""The three chums, Mollie Billette, Grace Ford, and Amy Blackford were gathered in the comfortable library of Betty Nelson's home--Betty being the fourth of the merry quartette, dubbed the ""Outdoor Girls"" by the people of Deepdale, because of their love of the open and of outdoor sports.The girls, as my old readers will doubtless remember, had helped establish a Hostess House at Camp Liberty, and since then had given all their strength and time and youthful enthusiasm to the great work of cheering our young fighters, entertaining their loved ones, and, in the end, sending them with fresh courage and happy memories to the ""other side"" for the great adventure.To-day they had gathered in Betty's house to discuss the rather hazy plans for their brief vacation. And Amy had simply voiced what was in the thoughts of all the girls. They were, undeniably and heartily, homesick for Camp Liberty and their work at the Hostess House.""Lost?"" Mollie repeated Amy's expression thoughtfully. ""Yes, I guess that would pretty well describe the feeling I've had for the last few days. Sort of restless and aimless--wondering what to do next.""A brief silence followed, broken only by the rustle of paper as one of the girls turned a page. Then, so suddenly that Mollie jumped nervously and Grace almost upset a box of chocolates at her elbow, Amy threw down her book and sprang to her feet.""Goodness, the child's mad,"" declared Mollie, looking at her chum with a mixture of amusement and sympathy in her eyes. ""What do you want to do, Amy, start a fight, or set the town on fire? Whatever it is, I'm for you, as Roy would say.""""Well, if all you want is noise, we'll easily fix that,"" said Mollie briskly, running to the piano and gathering in Grace and Amy on the way. ""Sing,"" she commanded, ""and I'll make as much noise as I can on the piano.""""Or something,"" Mollie mimicked, whirling around and catching the newcomer in a bear's embrace. ""Come over to the couch, Betty Nelson, and explain yourself. Where have you been and why did you keep us waiting?""Laughingly the Little Captain, as she was often called by the girls because of her talent for leadership, permitted herself to be dragged over to the couch by the impulsive Mollie, while Amy and Grace seated themselves on the arms.""I'm glad you wanted to see me so much,"" chuckled the Little Captain, adding, with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes: ""I imagine you would have been still more impatient if you had known--"" she paused wickedly and just looked at them.And indeed the Outdoor Girls had little reason to wonder who their correspondents might be, for as regularly as clockwork those precious letters with the strange foreign postmarks were delivered to their eager hands.There were other letters with that foreign postmark, too, for in addition to their work at the Hostess House, the girls had faithfully kept up a large correspondence with the brave boys who had already crossed the water and were waiting impatiently for their chance ""at the Huns.""Allen Washburn, on his way to make a great name for himself in the law before the war put a temporary check upon his ambitions, had been in love with the Little Captain for--oh, yes, ever since he could remember, while Betty--but Betty would never really admit anything, not even to herself."
"Then there was Will Ford, Grace Ford's brother, who was not only devoted to his pretty sister, but, in spite of Amy's flushed protestations to the contrary, to Amy Blackford, also--although in quite a different manner!Frank Haley was a high school chum of Will's, who from the time of his first meeting with Mollie Billette had seemed inclined to become her shadow, to the latter's secret gratification and outward indifference.The boys had shared in many of the adventures of the Outdoor Girls, and of course had been among the very first to volunteer to help ""lick the Boche"" as they slangily but ardently put it. The girls had gloried in their patriotism, and it was their assignment to Camp Liberty that had first given Betty the idea of working in the Hostess House there.They had been very happy, fired as they were by enthusiastic patriotism, until the fateful day had come when the boys had entrained for Philadelphia and from there to the Great Adventure. Then for the first time the girls had had the real and terrible meaning of war brought home to them. And the boys, so merry and care-free when they had first entered the service, had seemed suddenly older, more important, more manly, only the fire of enthusiasm in their eyes showing their indomitable youth.Several months had passed since that day of mingled tears and pride and heartache, and the girls had had time to get used to the separation a little--a very little. And now Betty had brought them the letters they were always hungry for, anxiously eager, yet always, at the very back of their hearts, a little haunting fear of what they might contain.""And when he, Frank, ventured to remonstrate with him the other day and advised him to cut down on his chow, Roy said: 'Nothing doing! I've got a definite end in view, old man. This khaki outfit has acquired so much terra firma it's beginning to stand alone, but if I get so fat I can't wear it they'll have to give me another one--see?'""The girls laughed, but there was just a shade of wistfulness in their laughter, for they knew that the boys were only skirting the outer edge of the hardships they would be called upon to encounter later on. The girls stared wide-eyed at Betty while slowly the color drained from their faces. It was true they had been dreading just this news for a long, long time, yet now that it had come they felt strangely quiet and numb. They had much the same feeling as one who had received a stunning blow. Until the paralysis had passed there could be no pain. That would come later.""He will probably, toward the end,"" Betty explained, while slowly her heart contracted and the tears welled to her eyes. ""Allen didn't--not till the last sentence. It's only a line, but th-that's enough. He says not to be alarmed if his letters are delayed--it may be hard to get them through.""And while the girls gazed at her in tragic silence, imagining terrible, unbelievable things, a moment will be taken to sketch briefly for the benefit of new readers the various exciting or amusing adventures which had befallen the Outdoor Girls in the days before the grim shadow of war had spread itself over the land.In the first volume of the series, entitled ""The Outdoor Girls of Deepdale,"" the girls had formed a camping and tramping club and had tramped for miles over the country, meeting with many interesting adventures on the way.At Ocean View some time later the Outdoor Girls had cleared up a mystery centering about a strange box they had found in the sand. Then had followed that splendid summer at Pine Island, when the girls had accidentally discovered a gypsy cave and had succeeded not only in rounding up the band of gypsies but in recovering several valuable articles that had been stolen from them. The four boys who were now facing the enemy in France had shared in their fun that summer, pitching camp near the bungalow of the girls.Their next adventure found the girls and boys again at Pine Island, but under greatly altered circumstances. America had just entered the great war, and the four boys had responded eagerly to the bugle call. Later they were sent to Camp Liberty for training, to which the girls soon followed them to work in the Hostess House."
"Will Ford, the brother of Grace, had caused the girls, and especially his sister, anxiety and uneasiness because of his failure to enlist with the other boys. In the end he justified himself, however, by delivering a German spy to justice and enlisting in the service of his country immediately afterward. The girls also recovered some valuable jewelry that the spy had stolen from them.Then in the volume directly preceding this, entitled ""The Outdoor Girls at the Hostess House,"" the girls had befriended an old woman who had been knocked down by an unscrupulous motorcyclist. They later learned the secret tragedy in the life of their little old lady.""I suppose in a way we are,"" returned the Little Captain slowly, wishing desperately that those troublesome tears would stay where they belonged--her eyes were so misty she could hardly see Grace! ""Only ours is a harder kind of battle, because it's made up mostly of waiting and working without any of the thrill and excitement of the real fight to help us. But I'd like to know,"" and there was a little ring of pride and renewed courage in her voice, ""what the real fighters would do without us anyway. We're just as much soldiers as they are, and if we don't do our share, they can't do theirs."" ""I can't seem to get used to it,"" sighed Mollie several days later, as she ran up the steps of her porch and opened the screen door for the girls. ""To think that no matter how much we want to go back to the Hostess House--""""There is no Hostess House to go back to,"" finished Grace, sinking down in a luxurious porch swing and plumping the cushion behind her back. Grace always had a gift for finding the soft places. ""It is rather discouraging.""""But we musn't think,"" Betty interrupted quickly, adding with a little twinkle: ""About being unhappy, that is. All we have to do is just hold on to the belief that the boys are coming back a year from now, maybe less--coming back without a hair less than they had when they went away.""This was Dora, nicknamed Dodo, and Paul, Mollie Billette's small brother and sister, who were nearly always getting into some sort of mischief from the time they stepped their little feet out of bed in the morning till the time they slipped the same little feet, tired out with getting into trouble, into bed at night.""Oh, dear!"" cried Mollie, half amused and half vexed as she put aside her knitting and took Dodo on her lap. ""I thought you and Paul promised to play with the bunnies all the afternoon and not bother sister. Can't you see she has company?""""Well, you won't get any, not this time,"" said Mollie definitely, trying not to smile, while the other girls were not even trying. It was always hard not to laugh at the twins, naughty as they often were.""But we want tandies,"" repeated Dodo, looking surprised that Mollie had not understood the first time. ""Dive Paul an' me tandies--lots of tandies--an' we'll go 'long. Shan't we, Paul? Ooh--"" the question ended in an anguished wail as Dora's eyes rested on her faithless twin.The latter had extracted Grace's half-filled candy box from under a cushion where she had hastily hidden it at the first threat of invasion by the insatiable twins and was at the moment busily engaged in devouring its contents. Grace had been too busy watching Dodo to notice him.Again the girls had to strangle their mirth while Mollie reiterated her command to Paul. The latter, after regarding the wriggling Dodo for a minute uncertainly, reluctantly left his refuge and stood before Mollie, head hanging."
"""That,"" said Mollie sternly, though the corners of her mouth twitched and there was a twinkle in her eye, ""is just exactly what you say every time you're a bad naughty boy. Now, just to make you remember how naughty you were, you shan't have another piece of candy for a whole week.""""Ooh dive 'em to me, dive 'em to me quick,"" she demanded, then as Mollie made good her promise the little girl turned upon the erring Paul a look of conscious virtue and said gravely; ""If you were a dood boy I would div you one, but now me's goin' eat 'em up, every one till dey's all gone.""""I wouldn't give much for his chances,"" chuckled Mollie, adding with a sigh that was a mixture of exasperation and amusement. ""Aren't they perfectly terrible? There isn't a minute of the day when they're not in some mischief.""""Just the same,"" said Mollie, after a little pause, ""even though the twins are a great deal of trouble, Mother said she just wouldn't have known what to do without them--especially after I went to Camp Liberty--the house would have been so frightfully dull.""""I should think so,"" said Grace, adding suddenly, as though she had thought of it for the first time: ""Why she would have been all alone, wouldn't she? How awful!"" For Mollie had no father, he having died several years before.""And the other day she said the strangest thing,"" Mollie continued, suddenly earnest. ""You know how she adores Paul. Well, I caught her looking at him with the most wistful expression, and when I asked her what the matter was she looked up at me and I saw there were tears in her eyes.""'It's Paul,' she said softly. 'Of course I'm thankful he is so little that I can keep him safe at home with me, but sometimes when I think of my dear country and the terrible wrongs she has suffered, I almost wish that my little son were old enough to bring retribution upon those hideous Germans. Sometimes I feel cheated--yes, you needn't stare--that I have not a son ""over there"".'""""Well,"" said Grace, stretching herself, sitting up in the swing, and looking important, ""nobody asks me whether I have anything to suggest,"" adding as they turned a battery of surprised and eager glances her way: ""I don't know whether I can be persuaded to tell you now or not."" ""I'm not a pig,"" cried Grace, striving to look dignified, which is a rather difficult procedure when one is being hugged by three pairs of arms at once. ""I don't care how many times you spit me, whatever that is, Mollie, but you shan't call me a pig.""""What?"" asked Grace aggravatingly, but added hastily as Mollie again raised the knitting needle at a threatening angle: ""All right, if you'll just give me space enough to breathe I'll do any little thing you ask.""""Well, that's what I'm going to tell you if you give me half a chance. She said she felt as if she owed something to us girls for having stood so loyally behind Uncle Sam, and had decided to offer us her cottage at Bluff Point to use as long as we wanted it.""""It's strange how everybody persists in calling it work and giving us so much credit when it was all such fun,"" said Betty. ""But girls,"" she added, laughing breathlessly, ""the great fact is that we are going to have another adventure in the open. The very thought of it makes me want to roll in the buttercups.""""But when shall we start?"" cried Mollie, coming back to the all-absorbing topic at hand. ""Goodness, I'd like to throw a few clothes in a suitcase and start right away--quick--this minute--I can't wait!""""Why, even in Mollie's car it will take two days,"" said Grace, turning to Betty with the relief of one who at last had a sane person to reckon with. ""Mollie and Amy evidently expect to make it in a couple of hours."""
"""Mind!"" echoed Betty, while the others looked at her in surprise. ""Why of course we'd love to have her! You know that. But I never imagined she would care to go, she is so interested in Red Cross work and her clubs--""""That's just it,"" said Grace, sitting up quickly. ""She's entirely worn out with work and worry about Will, and I thought a little vacation with us girls would help her out wonderfully. I'm not sure she will go--I haven't asked her yet.""""Now you're saying something!"" cried Mollie fervently, albeit slangily, as she flung her arm about the Little Captain and dragged her down the steps. ""Action is what we need--action, and plenty of it.""The girls fairly ran the short distance from Mollie's home to Grace's, and the people they met on the way, greeted them heartily, musing as he or she turned to go on: ""There's probably something interesting in the air--the Outdoor Girls always look like that when they have some new adventure in tow."" For Deepdale was very proud and fond of its Outdoor Girls.Mrs. Ford was just coming down the stairs dressed to go out when the quartette burst in upon her. She did look very tired and worn, as Grace had said, but the smile that lighted her face at sight of the girls made her appear ten years younger.""I've no doubt of it,"" retorted her mother, laughing, adding, with another anxious glance at the clock: ""But I'm afraid you will have to get someone else, Honey. If I were free, I should like nothing better, but you see how rushed I am--""""But you're terribly tired, Mother, you know you are,"" said Grace with unusual gentleness, adding diplomatically: ""What good will you be to the Red Cross or to anyone else, I'd like to know, if you let yourself get sick?""""But I'm not sick,"" protested her mother, then added with a sudden longing as the wild solitude of Bluff Point rose before her eyes suggesting utter peace and quiet, a chance to rest tired nerves and gather strength for the last great drive:It took the girls about five minutes of the hardest work they had ever done in their lives. But they did what they had set out to do. At the end of that time Mrs. Ford consented to start with them whenever they were ready. ""I wish,"" said Mollie, sitting back to view approvingly the shining black hood of her car, ""that we had another machine. I'm afraid by the time we've packed our bags and things into the tonneau we'll find it rather crowded. And for such a long trip we ought to have plenty of room.""""That's what I was thinking,"" agreed Amy, rubbing a bit of nickel to a gleaming polish, for the girls had gathered at Mollie's to help her put the car in shape for the anticipated trip to Bluff Point. And they had gone to their work with a will, rubbing and polishing the big machine as they would have groomed a well-loved horse. ""We will have our trunks sent, of course, but we shall have to take our nighties and combs and brushes and such things. We might put 'em on the roof,"" she added hopefully.""Betty, dear, I love you so,"" crooned Mollie, running around the car and putting a rather oily hand about Betty's waist. ""You wouldn't want such an ardent admirer to drop dead at your feet, would you, now?"""
"""It would have the charm of novelty,"" chuckled Betty, only to add quickly as Mollie made a threatening gesture: ""No, please don't kill me yet. Come over here on the steps and I'll tell you all about it.""""If you mean, when did I get it,"" answered Betty, enjoying their surprise to the full, ""I might tell you that up to six o'clock last evening I had no more idea of owning a car than you did. However, at six-fifteen, I owned it,"" and her eyes danced with the pride of ownership.""That's what we wanted to know, of course,"" she said. ""It seems that one of Dad's clients owed him a good deal of money, and although he, the client, that is, had plenty of money, it was all tied up in such a way that he couldn't get hold of it right away, so he offered to give Dad his almost new racing car in exchange. And,"" here Betty came to the most wonderful part of her story, ""since mother doesn't care for that type of car--he gave it to me!""""I don't know whether it's come yet or not,"" explained the Little Captain, as the girls threw aside dust rags and gingham aprons preparatory to a concerted rush upon the new acquisition. ""That's why I didn't tell you about it sooner. I was going to surprise you by taking you to it,"" she added, as they set off at a walk that was almost a run for the pretty Nelson house; ""but when Mollie spoke about another car I just couldn't hold back any longer. Oh dear, I hope it has come!""However, there was no time for more conversation, for at that moment they turned a corner, bringing Betty's house to sight, and what should be going up the drive at that particular and ecstatic moment but the graceful, low-bodied racer itself!With a shout the girls rushed forward. They overtook the driver as he slowed to a stop, and fairly danced with impatience while the man pushed up his goggles, took off his hat, wiped his perspiring forehead, and slowly turned to smile at them.""Yes, yes, we know all about it,"" interrupted Betty, then added with a smile, as the man looked surprised: ""I suppose you think I'm terribly impatient, but, you see, the car is mine, and I can't wait to try it out.""The man whistled and descended with alacrity. The girls noticed rather absentmindedly that he was a rather good looking young fellow, probably one of the young men from Mr. Todd's office who had volunteered to run this errand for him.""Well, I don't blame you a bit for being in a hurry,"" he said heartily, eyeing the beautiful lines of the car with approval. ""She sure is a great little machine! You are Miss Nelson, I suppose?"" he added, turning to Betty. ""You see,"" with evident embarrassment, ""I promised to deliver the car in person to Mr. Nelson--""""Here he is, so there ought to be no difficulty about that,"" said a jovial voice, and they turned to find Mr. Nelson himself coming toward them. ""Good afternoon, Mr. Jameson. How do you like my new acquisition? A beauty is it not?""""I say so!"" agreed the young fellow, and after a few moments of general conversation, Mr. Nelson led him off toward the house, leaving the girls to themselves. And that, as Mollie afterward remarked, ""was just the most beautiful thing he could have done!""In their excitement they all tried to climb in, forgetting that a car designed to seat two people cannot by any stretch of imagination accommodate four. Then suddenly realizing what an absurd picture they must be making, they began to laugh."
"""Oh, come on, we'll all go,"" cried Mollie dancing with impatience. ""You get in beside Betty, Grace, since you're afraid of the running board, and Amy and I'll hang on somewhere. Come on, Amy. Be a sport, old girl.""So Grace climbed in beside the Little Captain, while Amy and Mollie scrambled up on the running boards and clung to the sides of the car. Then Betty tooted the horn triumphantly and began slowly to back down the drive.""I don't know about this,"" she remarked, as the car made rather zigzagging work of it. ""I've driven mostly on a straight road, you know, and I'm not very expert, even if I do know all about a motor boat.""""Don't you dare,"" cried Betty, giving the wheel a nervous little twist that caused Amy to groan and clutch the side of the car tighter. ""If you make me stop now, I'll never get started again. There!"" as the car slid into the roadway, hesitated a moment, then without a jar or a jerk, glided swiftly along the smooth road, gathering headway as it went. ""Now we're all right.""""Just the same, it might have been a good idea to have brought some cushions along,"" said Mollie ruefully. ""We might have strapped them on and used them the way you do life savers--in case of emergency.""""Goodness, don't!"" cried Betty, as she swung the car around a corner and started once more toward home. ""The punishment wouldn't fit the crime, Mollie. Besides, we'll be back in a few minutes. Girls, she runs like a dream!""A few minutes more, and they were again turning into the Nelson drive, which, by the way, Betty took much more expertly this time. As the car slowed, Amy and Mollie dropped off and Amy opened the door for Lady Grace, who descended slowly.""Hello--who--why, Grace, how did you happen to wake up?--Why, Grace, what is the matter, dear?--You have heard what?--Will is wounded?--Oh, Honey, how awful! Is it serious?--Never mind, don't try to tell me about it now. I'll get dressed just as fast as I can and come right over--Yes, yes, in about five minutes.""Will! Dear old Will was wounded! That had been about all she had been able to gather from Grace's sobbing message--but that was enough. He was the first of the boys to fall out there in the trenches, and who knew but what Allen might be the next!And here only yesterday they had been so happy, as happy as they could be with that shadow always hanging over them. This was the day, too--the incongruous thought struck Betty as she hastily pulled on her clothing--the day they had set for their trip to Bluff Point. Well, of course, it was all off now. Who wanted to go anyway?"
"These thoughts and many more raced through Betty's head as she put the finishing touches to her toilet and crushed a garden hat on her pretty soft hair. She was a very attractive picture as she ran down the stairs, but she neither knew it nor cared.""Why, Betty dear, what is the meaning of the hat?"" her mother inquired, smiling as her young daughter burst into the dining room. ""You don't need it to eat breakfast in, you know. Who called on the 'phone?""""I'm not going to eat breakfast, at least not right away. But there, of course, you don't know,"" answering her mother's look of surprise. ""Grace called up and, oh, Mother, poor Will has been wounded! I don't want to c-cry,"" her chin quivered and she turned away for a moment to get control of the lump in her throat.And the Little Captain found poor Grace in need of all the sympathy she could possibly give her. She was sitting in the darkest corner of the library, all crumpled up in a big chair, her eyes red with weeping and a damp ball of handkerchief clutched tightly in one hand.""That's all it said--what I told you,"" replied Grace, relaxing wearily. ""Just said that he was wounded--nothing more. Dad is writing to Washington to try to get more news. Of course, he has a great deal of influence, being a lawyer with a good many friends in Washington, and he may be able to find out something. I don't know.""""But she's not his sister,"" cried Grace, with a sudden flare-up of jealousy that made Betty smile in spite of her heartache. She could not help wondering how Grace would have taken it if it had been Roy instead of Will who had been wounded.But Grace's little fit of jealousy did not last long at sight of Amy's drawn, white face and the traces of tears in her eyes. Instead, she opened her arms to this other girl who was not Will's sister, yet loved him too, and for a moment they cried on each others shoulders.""Goodness!"" said Mollie after a moment, shrugging her shoulders a little impatiently, ""of course, it's terrible to have Will wounded, and I can imagine Grace being all cut up about it, but she--and Amy too--act as if he were dead.""""I know,"" said Betty softly, then added, looking a little quizzically at Mollie; ""But you know I don't blame them so much when I try putting myself in their place. Of course we love Will, but suppose it had been Allen, for instance, or Frank.""""I did too,"" explained Grace. ""But when I spoke of it to Dad, he said we were to do nothing of the kind. He said we couldn't do poor Will""--in spite of all her resolution her voice broke on the name--""any good by staying at home and moping, and that he would let us know as soon as he had any authentic word from Washington. And he insists on mother's going too.""And so it happened that a few hours later a very sober group of Outdoor Girls started on what should have been a joyful trip, with heavy hearts and gloomy foreboding. Even the new racer did not serve to liven the party."
"However, hope and optimism did not consent to be kept long in the background on such a day as this when the sun shone its brightest and the birds sang their hardest and the very wind seemed to be whispering of happier times to come.""Well,"" sighed Amy at last, for she and Mrs. Ford were riding in Mollie's car, while Grace was with Betty in the racer, ""it's plain to be seen that nature at least doesn't know that anything horrible or cruel is happening 'over there.' I don't think I ever saw a more wonderful day.""""Which reminds me,"" Mollie cried, apropos of nothing in particular, ""that if we don't put on more speed we'll not reach our destination before dark. I wonder why Betty doesn't hurry,"" for Betty and Grace in the speedy little racer were taking the lead.However, Betty, looking behind, seemed not in the least concerned. On the contrary, she waved her hand joyously as she recognized Mollie had taken her challenge. Then she too bent over the wheel with her eyes glued to the flying ribbon of road ahead.""They're gaining,"" she cried, and then all at once the spirit of the thing caught her--the contest of speed was getting into her blood. ""Oh, Betty, don't let 'em,"" she almost screamed, above the noise of the motor and the rushing wind. ""They're not more than fifty feet behind now!""""That's near enough,"" Betty decided, and leaning over suddenly, did something to the car that Grace never quite understood. Anyway, it had the desired effect. The little racer fairly leapt forward and, like a horse that has been given his head for the first time, took the bit between its teeth and bolted.Behind them Mollie looked her amazement. She was getting every bit of speed out of her machine of which it was capable, and then, just as victory was within sight, Betty was doing an inconceivable, unbelievable thing--she was winning the race!""Oh, Betty'll take care of herself,"" said Mollie, though she was slightly mollified by this tribute to her superior experience, if not superior speed. ""I guess,"" she added, after a moment's reflection, ""I'd better sell this old car and get a racer too.""""Well, I'm glad there's something nice about it,"" said Mollie, for she had not yet recovered from her surprise and chagrin. ""I hope,"" she added, as a sudden thought struck her, ""that Betty doesn't get too far ahead. I don't know this part of the country very well and Betty has the map.""But they rounded several curves, and still no sign of Betty's car. Then happened what Mollie had secretly been fearing would happen. They came to a crossroads and a sudden stop at one and the same moment.""What, for instance?"" queried Mrs. Ford soothingly. She knew that the first defeat Mollie had ever experienced would be bound to rankle and was prepared to make allowances. ""If the engine is all right, why don't we go on?""At this reference to Betty's speed, Mollie winced a little but gave a relieved sigh nevertheless. For by this time the car was near enough to be identified beyond doubt. It was a racer, and there was a girl at the wheel."
"""Hello,"" she cried, adding as the car slowed to a standstill: ""This time the joke's on us. We were so busy running away from you that we took the wrong road. This one ends about two miles up in somebody's farm.""And Betty hustled, with Mollie keeping just far enough behind to avoid the cloud of dust the little car threw up. For an hour more the motors purred rhythmically, eating up mile after mile, until finally the girls were compelled by ravenous and healthy appetites to stop for lunch.They had brought two big hampers, packed full with sandwiches, fruit and cake and also something to drink, and after the long ride in the open the very thought of these delicacies brought, as Grace said, ""the tears of longing to their eyes.""""Are you going to get out and eat, in romantic fashion, by the wayside?"" queried Grace, eyeing a pile of sandwiches hungrily. ""Or are you going to sit in state in the car and let us occupy the running board?""""Well as long as you die out there it's all right,"" retorted Mollie unfeelingly. Nevertheless, she handed the sufferer a ham sandwich and a hard boiled egg, which the latter came as near to grabbing as her good breeding would permit.However, when they had finished the lunch, burned up what odds and ends remained, and had once more started on their way, they found that the shadow of unhappiness which the excitement of the race had almost banished, was returning again. ""Well, we've been making pretty good speed for the last three hours,"" said Mollie, taking first one hand, then the other, from the steering wheel and stretching her cramped fingers experimentally. ""Now if nothing else happens--""The sound of an explosion cut short the rest of the sentence, and she put on the brakes, at the same time tooting a signal to Betty. The latter stopped her car and came running back to see what had happened.""Tire,"" said Mollie laconically, forestalling the inevitable questions. ""I knew our luck had been too good to be true. Well,"" with the air of a martyr accepting the inevitable, ""I suppose there's nothing to do but get busy and fix it, though, of course, this spoils our chances of getting to Bensington to-night,"" Bensington being the town midway between Deepdale and Bluff Point where they had planned to spend the night. It was also the only town for miles around that boasted a hotel.Thus inspired, the girls ""got busy,"" but they were tired with the long drive and everything seemed to go wrong. Their usually skillful fingers fumbled, the tire was ""too big or too little or something,"" to quote Amy, and at the end of a quarter of an hour's useless struggle their tempers were worn to a frazzle and they were ready to cry.""Well, I never had anything act like that before,"" cried Mollie irritably. ""I'd like to give the person that wrote about the 'depravity of inanimate things' a medal. The old tire's got a mean disposition, that's all.""""I always knew you were a 'philosophiker,' Betty, dear. But,"" she added, vindictively kicking the tire that lay at her feet, ""all the philosophy in the world won't put this tire on for us. And we can't very well get to Bensington on three wheels and a rim.""""But you forget he's an angel in disguise,"" laughed Betty, snatching the dust cloth Mollie held out to her. ""Anyway,"" she added, over her shoulder, ""desperate cases require desperate remedies,"" and was off round the turn of the road."
"At the unexpected sight of a red rag wildly waved by a very graceful little figure in a gray traveling suit, he looked surprised but promptly put on his brakes. He leapt from his machine and came running toward her while Betty descended from her perch just in time to meet him at the foot of the rock.""Is there anything the matter?"" he asked, in a nice voice that Betty immediately liked. In fact, she liked nearly everything about him, from his sunburned face and merry blue eyes to his trim leather boots and puttees. So she gave him a friendly little smile that showed all her dimples, much to his secret admiration.Then, as they made their way around the turn in the road toward the car where Mrs. Ford and the girls were waiting for them, she explained the situation, adding with another smile: ""You see, I had to stop you some way, so I chose the very first method I could think of.""Then after mutual introductions, by which the girls learned that their new friend's name was Joe Barnes and that he had been on his way to Deeming, a village about five miles away when Betty's red flag had brought him to so sudden a stop, the youth went to work with a will at the tire while the girls alternately watched him and helped by handing him the tools he needed.""You were probably tired,"" he answered, glancing at the car, which gave unmistakable evidence of the many miles they had come that day. ""Are you, have you--"" he hesitated, evidently not knowing whether his question would be taken in good part or not. ""Are you going very much farther?""""But Bensington is about fifteen miles away,"" he protested, adding as he glanced up at a lowering gray cloud overhead: ""And if I know anything about weather signs, you will have to use some speed to get there before the storm.""""But we haven't got the drenching yet,"" Mrs. Ford reminded her, adding, with a cordial smile as she held out her hand to Joe Barnes: ""We don't know how to thank you Mr. Barnes, for taking all this trouble for us.""Another glance at the ominous cloud which had grown bigger and blacker even in these few minutes, sent the girls scrambling unceremoniously to their seats while Joe Barnes lifted his hat and stood waiting for them to start. Once his eyes rested upon Betty, and there was so much undisguised admiration in them that she flushed prettily and threw in the clutch with a jerk that was not at all skillful.""Good-bye,"" they called, and ""good-bye,"" he answered, as the two cars sprang forward in a cloud of dust. Not until they were out of sight did Joe Barnes turn away and retrace his steps toward his deserted motorcycle.""Joe, my boy,"" he communed with himself, shaking his head over the memory of Betty's dimples, ""that little Miss Nelson is one girl in a million. I wonder now,"" slowly mounting his machine and looking reflectively at the road in front of it, ""why I didn't ask if I might call."" Then the absurdity of the idea made him laugh at himself. ""What nonsense to think of taking advantage of an accident--Where was it they said they were stopping for the night? Oh, yes, Bensington. Well, he might go there and take a chance on seeing them--her. Fate might even be kind to him and burst some more tires!"" Then he laughed at himself again and started his motor.""Um--yes, that was rather strange,"" mused Grace. ""One isn't used to seeing a young, good-looking and apparently healthy boy on this side of the water these days, unless he's in khaki. I wonder if our knight by the wayside is by any chance one of those insects we term--""""Granted,"" agreed Grace, adding with a quick change of mood: ""Just the same, it makes me feel desperate to see any young fellow running at his own free will about the country, evidently enjoying life, while our boys are giving up everything--""For a long time there was silence. Then Betty gave a little start and regarded with disfavor a big drop that rested on the third finger of her right hand. She immediately resigned the guidance of the car to her left hand while she held up the right for Grace's inspection."
"""Rain,"" cried Betty succinctly, adding with a whimsical little smile: ""I don't know whether Joe Barnes is a slacker or not, but I do know he's a good prophet. We surely shall have to put on some speed if we want to reach Bensington before the storm!""""I don't know,"" answered Betty, while a worried frown wrinkled her pretty forehead. ""I don't know just how far out we are. Oh, there's a signboard. What does it say, Gracie? You can read it better than I.""Betty brought the car to a stop, jumped out on the road with Grace at her heels, and waited for Mollie to come up. They had not long to wait for a moment later Mollie stopped her car with a grinding of brakes and came running up to her chums.""I was wondering how long you were going to ignore the warnings of nature,"" she said, with a little grimace. ""That cloud has been growing with horrible rapidity for the last five minutes. What are your plans, Captain?"" and she favored Betty with a true military salute.It was easy to see by the way they went to work that the girls agreed with her. Even Mrs. Ford gave willing, though inexperienced, aid, and in a very short time they had lifted the tops, adjusted the side curtains and made all snug for the expected downpour.""Oh, it isn't getting wet that bothers me so much,"" said Grace, and Betty looked at her in surprise. ""It's the roads,"" she added by way of explanation. ""I've heard Aunt Mary say that they have terribly heavy storms in this part of the country, and sometimes in half an hour the roads get almost impassable. Many a machine has been known to sink three or four inches in mud, and sometimes they get in so deep they have to be hauled out.""""What a cheerful prospect!"" cried Betty, dismayed, adding, as the rain beat against the windshield in steady, driving sheets: ""Especially as this storm bids fair to be a record breaker. Look how muddy the roads are already.""They were silent for a while after that, while Betty regarded the increasingly muddy road ahead of her with anxious eyes. She had been forced to slacken her speed more and more until now they were barely crawling along.""I'm afraid we're in an awfully tight fix,"" she said at last. ""We're just plowing through this mud, and if it's hard on us, what must it be for Mollie, whose car is twice as heavy as this. Look behind, will you, Gracie, and see how she's coming along?""""She is just coming, and that's all,"" reported Grace, after a prolonged scrutiny through the rain-glazed window. ""Goodness, we've been out in storms before, but I never saw anything like this. And listen to that thunder--o-oh!"""
"""Well, I don't see that we'll be any less likely to get struck if we stand still,"" retorted Betty, a little sharply, for the situation was becoming wearing, to say the least. ""If you can suggest any way that we can get out of this fix--"" the sentence was cut short by a still louder and more terrifying clap of thunder.""Is Mollie still following us?"" asked Betty, after an interval of weird flashes, crashing thunder, and rain beating relentlessly against the glass in front and turning the road to a sea of mud. ""If she should get stuck I don't know what we would do.""""No, I don't,"" Betty replied wearily. ""You see how we've been traveling--not more than a snail's pace, and it won't be very long before we shall have to stop altogether. I'm surprised that Mollie has been able to keep going so long. You will have to keep your eye on her all the time, now, Grace, since it is getting so dark. We don't want to lose her.""""But,"" Grace suggested hesitantly, ""I don't see that we could do them very much good by staying here with them, if they do get stuck. Wouldn't it be better to go on and try to make Bensington? Then we could send help back to them.""""I've thought of that,"" said Betty simply, ""and it would work all right provided we did manage to reach Bensington. But the probability is that we would be forced to stop a little further on, and I must say I don't exactly enjoy the prospect of spending the night alone on this deserted road.""""Just the same,"" said Betty decidedly, ""I think I would rather cling to the old theory that there is safety in numbers. Besides, probably your mother would rather decide that for us. Are they still coming, Grace?""""It's a house!"" cried Betty jubilantly, while the hand that held the steering wheel shook with relief. ""You darling, wonderful house. Gracie, dear, I think it showed on the horizon just in the nick of time. Look behind once more.""""Don't be a goose, Gracie,"" chided Betty, feeling in hilarious spirits now that the end of their trouble was in sight. ""You ought to get down on your knees in thankfulness that there is a front door to get stuck in front of!""""Oh, is that so?"" mocked Grace, her own spirits reviving at the prospect of relief. ""Well, I'm thankful enough, but I certainly don't intend to get down on my knees about it. There isn't room in here and you can see it's too muddy outside!""""Except something to eat,"" amended Grace hungrily. ""I thought I had eaten enough lunch to last me a week, but I see I'm muchly mistaken. What shall we do, Betty?"" as the latter started to open the curtain and closed it quickly again as the rain beat in upon them. ""We are apt to get soaked just running that little distance to the porch."""
"""And the umbrellas are all wrapped up in the back of Mollie's car,"" lamented Betty, then added, with sudden decision: ""I guess unless we want to sit here all night we'd better chance it. I for one am so hungry I'd be willing to brave more than a rain for the sake of something to eat.""So they lifted the curtains and slipped out, thankful for the gravel walk that, while it was wet and slippery, was still a delightful contrast to the muddy sea of road they had left. They ran head down against the blinding rain, and gained the bottom step of the porch at the same time.""And here come your mother and Mollie and Amy,"" chuckled Betty as the trio followed their example and raced for the porch. ""I guess none of them ever knew she could run so fast in her life before. Hello, folks. Beautiful weather, isn't it?"" she inquired gayly, as the three scrambled, panting, up on the porch. ""You seem in a terrible hurry to get somewhere.""""Speak for yourself, John,"" gasped Mollie, shaking out her wet skirts and trying to regain some of her dignity by putting her hat on straight. ""If you could know what I've been through for the last hour, just coaxing the car along an inch at a time--""""Well,"" laughed Betty, as she turned to the front door and pushed the bell, ""I've been through a little bit of everything, myself, for the last few hours, except a good square meal. And, judging from the delightful aroma that hovers about this place,"" she added sniffing hungrily, ""I shouldn't wonder if that oversight wouldn't be swiftly remedied!""""I don't wonder you look surprised,"" she said in her sweetly modulated voice, ""for this is rather an unheard of calling hour. But you see we were caught in this awful downpour and had to seek your house for refuge.""""Oh, I'm sorry!"" exclaimed the lady, opening the door wider and motioning them into the cheerfully lighted living room. ""I didn't mean,"" she added with a smile, as they most willingly accepted her invitation, ""that I was sorry you came, but that you were forced to come by such conditions. Won't you take off your things? But you are wet!"" she exclaimed, as the girls started to remove their dripping wraps.""Please sit down and dry out a little,"" said the lady, indicating a grate fire which had evidently only recently been lighted on account of the chill in the air. ""I'm glad I had the fire made. I must have known,"" she added with a gracious smile, ""that you were coming to-night.""""I'll never say we aren't lucky again,"" agreed Betty, leaning an arm on the mantel and getting her wet skirt as close to the fire as she could. ""We were just wondering,"" she added, addressing Mrs. Ford, ""whether, if Mollie's car got stuck, you would rather have Grace and me struggle on to Bensington and get some help or stay and keep you company. Although,"" she added ruefully, ""if we couldn't pull through that mud, I don't know what we could find in Bensington to do it.""""Yes, I remember,"" Grace answered in a tone that indicated the memory was not a pleasant one. ""And I told him he had better drop that idea in a hurry if he expected me--I mean--any girl--"" she floundered, while they laughed mockingly at her, ""to have anything to do with him,"" she finished rather weakly, while the girls giggled exasperatingly."
"""Well, I don't know,"" remarked Betty, in an altruistic effort to pour oil upon the troubled waters, ""that I would particularly mind marrying a scientific farmer if they all have houses like this and acres of ground with orchards and cows and chickens--""The next moment she regretted her innocent little speech, for she could see that the mention of the boys had brought more vividly to Grace and Mrs. Ford and Amy the thought of Will--dear, bright, merry Will--lying wounded in some far-away hospital, how badly wounded they could not know, and dared not think.""I'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long,"" she apologized, ""but I have had to help the maid get dinner on the table. She is a new one, and, oh, so utterly helpless. Then, too, I was hoping my son would come home, but since everything is ready and I know you must be starving, we won't delay dinner any longer. If you will come, please--""""But this is imposing upon good nature,"" protested Mrs. Ford, as the lady held back the portiers and disclosed an inviting table set for seven, elaborate with shining crystal and silver. ""To drop down upon you from a clear--or rather, a cloudy sky--""""It is a pleasure,"" she said, adding, as they took their places: ""I am only thankful that a lucky chance enabled me to entertain you well to-night. I was expecting guests from the nearest farm, but since our next door neighbors are five miles down the road, they hesitated to make the trip because of the threatening weather. I guess it is just as well for them they did not come,"" and she paused to listen to the rain which was still pouring down in torrents.Mrs. Ford made an appropriate answer, and the two ladies entered into a little confidential chat that left the girls pretty much to their own devices. And they were trying their best not to disgrace themselves and to pay decorous attention to what their hostess was saying, while their hearty young appetites were crying their protests aloud.At last came the new maid whom their hostess had described as 'so utterly helpless,' looking to the famished girls an angelic being, bearing about her an aroma of tomato soup and fried chicken, more tempting than ambrosia.Without any perceptible hesitation, the girls immediately began to eat and continued the agreeable occupation without interruption to the end of the meal, save for an answer to a question or two asked by their hostess.The helpless maid was just bringing in an enormous layer cake to the accompaniment of admiring glances from the girls when the sound of a latch key in the door made the lady of the house look up with a start.Then came the sound of a hearty greeting in a masculine voice, followed by a slithery sound of wet clothing. Evidently the newcomer was divesting himself of some uncomfortably damp apparel. They could hear his mother speaking in a low voice--probably she was preparing him to meet the unexpected guests.""By Jove! did you say two cars?"" they heard him exclaim, and it suddenly seemed to them there was something familiar about his voice. ""Now I wonder--all right, Mother. Just give me a minute to get some dry clothes on and I'll be right with you. Gosh, but I'm starved!""""Oh, you shouldn't have waited for me,"" said the lady, noting that the ice cream that had followed hard on the heels of the chocolate cake had begun to melt. ""I don't know what to do with that boy,"" she added, smiling with a mixture of irritation and fond indulgence. ""When he gets out on his motorcycle, miles mean nothing to him and time means less. He is always late to dinner.""""Oh, he has conquered that difficulty,"" their hostess explained, her eyes once more lighting with pride in her son. ""He has a sort of path through the woods, which, while it perhaps lacks the comforts of a state road, at least is not inches deep in mud. He did get caught that way once and was several hours coming a few miles."""
"""Of course you hadn't,"" agreed her son, as he took the vacant seat beside her and turned upon her a pair of very handsome laughing eyes. ""I didn't either until a few minutes ago, and we haven't been acquainted more than a few hours.""""Your son did us the favor of helping us out of a difficulty this afternoon,"" Mrs. Ford explained, taking pity on the lady's bewilderment. ""To be explicit, he performed the very disagreeable operation of putting a new tire on the front wheel of our car.""But no matter how conscientiously Joe did justice to the good things set before him, there was not a moment when he was not conscious of Betty--Betty on the other side of the table, dimpling and sending him back sally for sally with ready wit. What lucky chance had prompted nature to send a thunderstorm that afternoon? The jolly old lady was certainly on his side!Finally some one suggested that Betty play some of the songs they had loved in those service-filled days at the Hostess House. As the girlish voices rang out in one patriotic song after another, Joe Barnes, who was seated on the edge of a table with one foot swinging idly, fidgeted uneasily, while over his face came a sober, almost sullen expression. Betty presently broke into the opening strains of ""There's a long, long road awinding,"" and the girlish voices took it up eagerly. They put into the melody all the pathos and longing of their hearts. They forgot where they were, the pleasant room faded away, and they saw only a sinister gray line of trenches, trenches that were death traps for the flowering youth of America. They were singing to the boys, their boys, and as she listened Mrs. Ford's eyes filled with tears.Nor was she the only one of that little audience who could not listen to the song unmoved. Joe Barnes felt a great, unaccustomed lump rising in his throat, and as the hot tears stung his eyes he rose hastily and stood staring at, though not seeing, a great picture of some illustrious ancestor that hung over the mantel.""We ought to,"" said Betty, forcing a lightness she did not feel, for as usual she was the first to sense the tense quality in the atmosphere, ""for we have certainly had practice enough. We used to sing for the soldier boys at the Hostess House almost every night.""""Yes, but it was sometimes very hard to make _them_ sing,"" added Amy. ""Often they didn't want to at first. But they always joined in toward the end, and the gloomiest of them went away with a smile on his lips.""""They could afford to laugh,"" said Joe Barnes bitterly. He had left the picture of his illustrious ancestor and had dropped down in his old position on the edge of the table, leg swinging idly. But his expression had changed. It was grim and hard.They had sung patriotic songs, they had spoken of their work at the Hostess House and of the soldier boys, while Joe Barnes, of military age and seemingly in perfect health, did not wear a uniform. Even though he were a slacker, it was terribly bad taste to tell him so in his own home, while accepting his, or his mother's, hospitality.And something deep down in their hearts, intuition, perhaps, perhaps a sort of sixth sense born of their wide experience of boys of all ages, told them that he was not a slacker. There must be some reason, some real excuse for his behavior.The girls assented eagerly, and in a few minutes the unpleasant episode was forgotten--or apparently forgotten. At least, for the time being it was relegated to the background, and it was not till some time later that Joe unexpectedly broached it to Betty."
"The drenching downpour had changed to a sort of dismal drizzle and Mrs. Ford, upon remarking this fact had made the suggestion that they get into the machines again and try to make Bensington. But Mrs. Barnes had so promptly and emphatically negatived this that there was really no room left for argument.""Why, even with dry roads it would take you two hours or more to get there, for at all times the road is bad between here and Bensington, but such a thing is simply out of the question with roads that are two feet deep in mud. No, you must stay for the night. I have plenty of room and am more than delighted to have you. No, please don't object, for I will not hear of your doing otherwise.""However, Betty was very much surprised when, in the midst of a beautiful dance with Joe Barnes--for Joe was a rather wonderful dancer--the latter whirled her off toward a window seat in one corner of the room and placed her, a little breathless, upon it.""And I,"" he countered, ""am telling you the truth when I say that if it were possible to talk with you and dance at the same time, I should not have brought you here. As it is, I choose the greater of the two blessings.""""In other words, 'get the agony over',"" said Joe, with a grimace. He waited a moment, while the girls, who had danced to the end of the record, turned it over, put in a new needle and started off all over again.""Yes, it's easy to guess what you thought,"" he interrupted, misinterpreting her sentence while the bitter look crept once more into his eyes. ""It's easy enough to guess what everybody thinks. But,"" he straightened his shoulders and threw back his head, ""I don't think anybody will have a right to think that very much longer. You see,"" he added, turning to her again and speaking more calmly, ""I tried to enlist at the beginning of the war, but they told me there was something wrong here,"" he touched his chest, ""with my lungs.""""The doctor said it was just beginning,"" he went on slowly, ""and he said--he was a good old scout, that doctor--that if I got out of the city where I could get fresh air, eggs, and milk--you know, the same old stuff--that I might succeed in curing myself up in a hurry and get in the game in time to bring in my share of helmets after all.""""Oh, so that's why you and your mother are away out here!"" cried Betty eagerly, laying an impulsive little hand on his. ""And you are well, aren't you? Why, you must be! You look the very picture of health.""""I feel just fine,"" he said, striving to make his voice sound natural. ""I never cough any more, and I've got the appetite of a wolf--you saw how I ate to-night--"" a faint smile lighted his eyes and found an answering one in Betty's. ""Yet, I've been holding off for more than three weeks for fear--just for fear--everything isn't all right. You see, they've made a coward of me. I'm afraid of being refused twice.""""Oh, but you won't be!"" cried Betty, with honest conviction in her voice. ""I'm not much of a doctor, although I've met so many of them at Camp Liberty and heard them talk so much about different diseases that I feel I ought at least to qualify as an assistant,"" she paused to smile at herself and he thought he had never seen anything so pretty in his life, ""and I would say that whatever your trouble has been, it is cured now. I'm sure of it."""
"""Say, you two over there,"" Mollie's voice broke in upon them gayly, ""we've been trying hard to be polite and not interrupt, but the clock has just struck twelve and we have a long ride before us to-morrow--or rather, to-day!""""Not on a morning like this,"" retorted Betty, running to the window and thrusting her head far out into the balmy air. ""Look, Lazybones, the roads are pretty nearly dry and we couldn't ask for a more wonderful day.""However that may be, the fact remains that in fifteen minutes from the time Mrs. Barnes stopped at the door, four very pretty and very hungry young girls gathered in the dining room, ready and eager for the day's adventure. Mrs. Ford was already there.Joe was there too, looking even more bronzed and attractive in the morning light, and Betty, glancing at him, could scarcely believe that what the boy had told her the night before had not been a dream. That splendid specimen of young manhood refused the right to serve his country because he had lung trouble! She could not even bring herself to think that other word, that horrible word, consumption.Perhaps something of what she was thinking was reflected in her eyes as she looked at him, for he returned the glance with so much admiration in his own that she hastily looked away and became absorbed in the bacon on her plate.""I wish you were coming with us,"" said Mrs. Ford, after the lady had waved aside her thanks for the good time they had had. ""I am sure you would enjoy the trip almost as much as we would enjoy having you with us.""""I wish it were possible for me to go,"" Mrs. Barnes replied rather wistfully, as they started down the steps to the waiting automobiles. ""It is rather lonesome out here,"" then, catching a glance from her son, who was trying to carry three handbags at once, she added hastily: ""But of course I love it and would miss it awfully. Joe, be careful, dear, you nearly dropped that bag in the dirt.""""I always thought I'd make good in the juggling profession,"" replied Joe ruefully, as he skillfully recovered the bag in question, ""but I guess I was mistaken. Where do these go, Miss Billette--anywhere?"" he asked, turning to Mollie.Amid expressions of friendship on both sides and laughing farewells, the two cars slid backwards along the drive and out on to the road. Then with a purring of engines, the little racer leaped ahead with Mollie in close pursuit. They were off once more.It was as Betty had said. The long clear night and the bright morning sunshine had done much toward drying the roads and though they were still rather sticky and slippery, the girls had no difficulty in keeping up a good rate of speed.""Wasn't it strange?"" she said, seeking to change the conversation and the trend of her own thoughts at the same time, ""that Joe Barnes proved to be Mrs. Barnes' son?"" It was not at all what she had intended to say, and out of the corner of her eye she saw Grace turn and look at her curiously.""That's the worst of it,"" sighed Grace, turning for consolation to her inevitable box of chocolates. ""No matter how awful you are, we have to love you just the same. Look out, Betty,"" as the car took a curve on three wheels. ""Goodness! you're getting to be a more expert skidder than Mollie."""
"Before they knew it, they had reached the outskirts of Bensington, then Bensington itself, and were speeding through the queer little town without a thought of stopping when a warning signal from Mollie's horn brought them to an abrupt stop. Betty jumped out and ran back.So Betty raced back to her machine and in a moment more they were off again, fairly eating up the miles. As the roads grew dryer and dryer beneath the scorching heat of the sun they made even better time until a little past twelve o'clock they entered the little village of Hill Crest.The place boasted nothing so magnificent as a hotel, but they managed to find a little bake shop where the rosy-cheeked country woman who worked there made them up some delicious sandwiches, supplied them with tempting rolls and cake, and, wonder of wonders, set upon the table a pitcher of fresh milk.When they had finished this rural but eminently satisfying repast, they hurried over to the one big general store to buy a few supplies that they would need that night. It was necessary to lay in only a limited amount, as Grace's aunt Mary had thoughtfully left her cottage well stocked and had informed them that eggs, chickens and vegetables of all kinds could be had fresh from the farmers round about.It was a narrow escape, for when the car had finally stopped there was not more than about an inch between it and the wagon in front. Luckily Mollie had been warned by the noise of the horn, and had stopped her machine just around the turn of the road. She and Mrs. Ford and Amy came running to see what the matter was.Meanwhile Betty had recovered herself and was smiling apologetically up at the frightened driver. His horses, startled by the noise and shouting had tried to bolt, and he had had all he could do to hold them in. The result was a slightly heated condition on the part of his temper.""Yes, an' I thought too,"" he interrupted, in a gruff, rude tone that whipped the color to her face. ""It would be a heap better if some folks'd think before they done things. Durned old gasoline wagons.""""I guess we had better be a little more careful in the future,"" said Mrs. Ford, a worried line between her brows. ""Better to be a little longer reaching Bluff Point than to endanger our lives and perhaps the lives of others.""""Well, we can't hope to pass that wagon,"" she explained, indicating the vehicle that was now some hundred feet in front and was waddling along at a snail's pace. ""There isn't room, with the ditch on one side and the drop on the other.""They laughed at her, and Betty cried gayly: ""Well, we won't get anywhere by standing here in the road. I move we follow the old fellow and see what he's up to. And if he gets too ridiculous,"" she added, as she climbed back into the car, ""I know how I'll fix him.""""You know, even his back looks stubborn,"" remarked Grace, when, coming close to the wagon and tooting the horn vigorously, the driver refused to budge from the middle of the road. ""I guess perhaps you will have to carry out your threat, Betty.""""Well, I declare if I won't,"" exclaimed the Little Captain, her cheeks flushing and her eyes blazing at the stubborn insolence of the man. ""It would give me great pleasure to bump him clear down the side of the mountain.""""Will you please suggest something?"" cried Betty, exasperated. ""There's nothing in the rules for driving a machine that covers this difficulty. I don't know what to do, unless-- Did you bring the pistol?"""
"""Well, that's what I want to do to that--man,"" cried Betty, trying to think of something bad enough to call the cranky farmer, who still urged his team along squarely in the middle of the road and refused to give an inch. ""Only I'd like to scare him to death. My conscience wouldn't even hurt.""Betty was silent for a minute or two, crawling along behind the wagon while her blood boiled and her anger surged. For Betty came from a race of fighting ancestors who were not in the habit of submitting to indignities.""Grace, I've got to do something!"" she burst out at last, gripping the wheel so tightly her knuckles showed white. ""It isn't so much the valuable time we're losing, but it's an absolute necessity to show that fellow where he--""""I'll say we shall,"" chortled Betty, adding with a glance over her shoulder at Mollie's car that was creeping along some twenty feet behind them: ""Of course the next thing will be to tell Mollie. Will you run back Grace?""""That was one time Grace had a good idea,"" Mollie was exulting as they flew along. ""I never thought she was particularly brilliant before, but I have changed my mind."" Then catching Mrs. Ford's eye, she added with a little laugh: ""You see that's the way Grace and I talk about each other. Only,"" plaintively, ""she says much worse things about me!""""She did,"" cried Mollie gleefully. ""And as luck, I mean bad luck, will have it, the mean old engine will choose the very center of the road to do it's stalling in. Bless it's little old heart,"" and even Mrs. Ford chuckled with her.As Grace had said, the detour was not over half a mile long, and they soon came out on the main road again. Then they backed the cars several hundred feet down the road so as to effectually block all passage. Very anxious the Outdoor Girls looked as the grouchy old farmer came toward them. Mollie was making all sorts of noises under the car, apparently tinkering with its mechanism, while the girls kept up a running fire of questions.""If we could don't you suppose we would?"" she queried, rather incoherently. ""Do you think I'm doing this for fun?"" Then she abruptly disappeared from sight again. The abruptness was caused by the terrible fear that if she stood looking at that sour old visage another moment she would have to spoil everything by laughing.As for the other girls, they were slowly turning purple in an effort to maintain the solemnity demanded by the occasion. A strange noise from beneath the car, promptly followed by a choked cough, didn't help them any, and they were relieved when their victim turned his suspicious gaze from them to the shallow ditch at the side of the road which was still muddy from the rain of the night before. The only hope he had of getting around them was to drive through this mud.Without a word or a glance in their direction, he whipped up his team and started for the ditch. This was something the girls had not foreseen, and they were of no mind to let him get ahead of them again."
"""I think so,"" she said, then as her eyes swiftly took in the situation--the grim old man already struggling through the ditch intent on getting ahead of them--she jumped to her seat and started the engine. ""All right,"" she cried gayly. ""Come on, girls, jump in.""The girls jumped in with alacrity and Betty and Grace ran to the car in front. Then while the man whipped up his horses and called to them in terms far from gentle, the two cars sprang forward and were off down the road.""It's wonderful how little children love the woods and brooks and all wild things,"" mused Betty, adding, as the picture of Dodo and Paul, hiding in the machines and begging to be taken along, came back to her: ""I almost wish we could have brought the twins with us. They would have so loved it.""""And we would have spent all our time trying to keep them from falling into the ocean,"" added Grace dryly. ""Besides,"" she added, ""I don't believe Mrs. Billette would have let them come. They are such little mischiefs, and she is always afraid something will happen to them.""""Yes,"" answered Grace, standing up in earnest now. ""Turn up the drive--it leads to the garage at the back. And, Betty, the house stands on a little bluff looking out over the ocean. Do you hear it--the ocean I mean, not the house, Silly!""Now, as Betty stopped the car at the back of the quaint little cottage, that sound of romance and mystery, the soft lapping of water with the deeper undertone of waves against rock came up to her and she threw back her head with a little bubbling laugh.The bluff on which they stood sloped gently down to the beach below. Once down there, the girls knew they would feel as though they were isolated from all the rest of the world, for the beach was in the form of a semi-circle, surrounded on three sides by rocky bluffs and blocked off in front by the ocean.The girls were almost as pleased with the interior of the house as they had been with its surroundings. There were odd little passages and unexpected window seats such as Betty had dreamed of having in her own little home some day.""Please don't do that,"" said Grace, as they entered the room they were to have together. ""I'm trying my best not to be as gloomy as I feel. But if you begin to sigh, I'll just have to give up and spoil the party.""""I know,"" said Grace a little petulantly, as she pulled off her hat and threw it on the bed. ""It seems to me that's all I'm ever doing--'just thinking.' If I could only really do something! Some time I'll scream aloud!""""I suppose so,"" she answered, eyes fixed moodily on the floor. ""Only the rest of you have only one to worry about, while I--"" she stopped, flushed, and began letting down her thick hair. ""If I could only cry!""In spite of the shadow hanging over them, dinner that night was a great success. Everybody pitched in, and, having acquired ravenous appetites on their long ride, did the cooking in record time, and of course everything tasted ambrosial."
"After dinner they wandered out on the veranda, which was almost as big as the rest of the house put together. It was a wonderful night, with the moon so bright that it shed a magic silver radiance over everything while the lapping of the water came softly up to them.""If they don't come to-day, either Mollie or I will go down to the station and see about them,"" offered Betty, who was looking as sweet and fresh as the morning itself. ""We'll probably have to go down and get them anyway, since we expressed them through by train and came by motor ourselves.""""Oh, well, who cares,"" cried Mollie, stretching her arms above her head and breathing deep of the salt-laden air. ""When we get down on that wonderful beach, that looks too good to be true, we'll be away from all the rest of the world and we won't need any clothes but a bathing suit.""After a minute's hesitation she agreed, and they ran upstairs eagerly to get ready. They all had black suits, and all but Grace wore snug-fitting rubber caps, designed more for use than looks. Grace wore a rakish little Scottish cap affair that was immensely becoming but not at all comfortable to swim in.""Goodness, anybody would think she was at Palm Beach or some other show place,"" cried Mollie, pulling her own plain little cap a trifle lower over her ears. ""If you expect an audience, Gracie, I'm afraid you will be disappointed.""Grace and Amy, following at not quite such breakneck speed, came out on the porch in time to see two slender, black-clad figures with vivid red and green caps scrambling down the side of the bluff that led to the beach.As they started after them Mrs. Ford joined them and they ran together to the edge of the bluff. The slope was not quite so gentle as they had thought on the night before, and Mollie and Betty were puffing considerably when they reached the bottom--which they did at almost the same minute.At the bottom they turned, saw Betty and Mollie reach the water's edge at the same instant--or so it seemed to them--and dash into the green depths. A moment more and the two black figures were lost to sight and only two vivid caps bobbed on the surface of the water.""Oh you needn't worry about them,"" Grace assured her. ""Betty and Mollie are regular fish in the water, and you know there aren't any mean currents around here. The beach slopes gradually down so that they can't get caught in water holes either, so don't worry, Mother,"" and she slipped an affectionate hand into her mother's and received an answering smile in return.""I dried off long ago,"" she said, adding, as they looked at her hopefully: ""I tell you what I'll do. I'll go up and open a couple of cans of tongue and make some sandwiches and bring down the cake we bought yesterday. And we can have some milk to drink, for I had the boy leave a couple of extra quarts this morning. How will that do?""""Do!"" the girls echoed, while Grace hugged her mother with vigor. The eyes of the girls followed her gratefully as Mrs. Ford started off on her work of rescue--at least, that is the way the hungry girls regarded it.""Well, mother did,"" returned Mollie spiritedly. ""She said she was glad I was going away because she thought the change would do me good. I really should have stayed at home, I suppose, and helped mother take care of the twins,"" she added thoughtfully. ""I never saw two children with such an absolute genius for getting into mischief. But when they're caught, they're so cunning and dear and say such quaint things that it is almost impossible to get angry with them."""
"""It seems so wonderful and peaceful here,"" said Amy, after a short pause, ""and we seem so awfully far away from the rest of the world. It almost makes one believe that the war 'over there' is a dream--""""No, oh, no!"" cried Mollie, then smoothed out the crushed paper and read the telegram through while her face grew whiter and her lips closed in a tense line. With a queer little sound in her throat she turned away and handed it to Betty.""Yes,"" agreed Mollie, sinking into a porch chair and searching desperately for a handkerchief in her pocketless bathing suit. ""But they always came home before night. I know it must be something awfully serious to keep them away over night.""""As you say, they probably ran away,"" she said. ""Only this time they have wandered too far and haven't been able to find their way back. But if your mother has notified the police, as she surely has by this time, they are sure to be found. And now,"" she added, rising briskly and making for the door, ""since everything seems a good deal worse than it is on an empty stomach, I'm going to give you some lunch and we'll decide what to do afterward.""""I'll have to go home, of course,"" she said suddenly, breaking a silence filled with unhappy thoughts. ""I don't know that I'll be any good, but I can at least comfort mother. I'm sorry,"" she gave them a wistful, apologetic little glance that went straight to their hearts and brought the tears to their eyes, ""to break up the party.""""You darling,"" cried Betty, trying to laugh and not making a very great success of it, ""do you think we care a rap about our old party? Only,"" she added thoughtfully, ""as you say yourself, I don't see that you can do very much good by going home.""""I know,"" interrupted Mollie, wearily. ""Of course she would say not to come. And I suppose,"" she added, dabbing impatiently at her eyes, ""all I'd do would be to weep anyway, and make things about ten times worse.""""Here we are, letting you do all the work again,"" cried Betty self-reproachfully. ""I guess we'd rather have it out here, but we'll bring it out ourselves. Please go over there, get into the swing, and don't stir until we say you may."" Betty had a pretty manner, half of deference, half of _camaraderie_, with older people that made them love her. Mrs. Ford patted her cheek with a little smile and obeyed her command while the three girls ran into the kitchen to bring out the sandwiches and cake that she had already prepared.""In the first place,"" Betty argued, as she began to clear away the dishes and Amy rose to help her, ""it couldn't have been an accident, or your mother would have read about it in the papers. The children are old enough to tell their names and where they live.""""Well, then, there are only two or three things left that might have happened,"" said Mollie, her lips quivering. ""It's barely possible they may have wandered off into the woods and gotten lost. In that case somebody will have to hurry up and find them or they will just stay there and s-starve! And that's almost worse than being run over."""
"""Well, with everybody in Deepdale, civilians as well as police, searching for them,"" said Betty confidently, ""I don't think there is very much chance of their starving to death. If that's the solution, I shouldn't wonder but that they are safe at home now with everybody rejoicing.""""I wonder,"" she said suddenly, after the girls had cleared away the lunch and had perched themselves on the porch railing, ""just what I ought to do first. Send a telegram to mother, I suppose,"" answering her own question.""Yes, I think I would,"" said Betty, adding, as Mollie got up with characteristic impulsiveness and started for the house: ""Do you mind telling us what you are going to say in it--about going home, I mean?""""There's another thing to consider,"" Mrs. Ford put in. ""It is almost a certainty that the children will be found in a day or two, perhaps are found already, and in that case you would have all your trip for nothing. I don't like to advise--""""You poor little girl,"" said the woman tenderly, then fearing lest sympathy would only make the girl feel worse, added hurriedly: ""In that case I should most strongly advise that you wait a day or two at least and give things a chance to straighten out. At the end of that time, if they haven't been found and you still think you ought to go, we'll pack up everything and go along with you, of course.""""That's what I'll do then,"" agreed Mollie, relieved to have the question settled for her. ""And now,"" she added, making for the door once more, ""I'm going to get into my street things and wiz down to that station in record time. Who wants to come with me?""It seemed everybody did, and in a very short time the girls had changed from their bathing suits to their street clothes and were ready for the dash to the station, which was about two miles from their house.""Better hold on,"" Mollie warned them. ""I've never done quite so steep a hill as this backward, and the old boy may balk. Take your time, old man,"" addressing the car, as it showed a tendency to pick up speed too rapidly. ""Of course we're in a hurry, but we don't want to land on our ears. That's the way--gently now. All right--we're off!"" as they reached the foot of the hill in safety and swung around into the road. ""Now let's see how long it will take you to reach that station.""As a matter of fact, it took scarcely any time at all, for the demon of speed seemed to have taken possession of Mollie, and she drove so recklessly that even the girls, who were used to her daring, were startled.However, the wild ride came to an end without accident, and the girls tumbled out of the machine and on to the station platform. They looked about them, but the only person in sight was an unpromising looking person with a bald head--though he could not have been over thirty-five--beaked nose, and small red-rimmed eyes.The girls followed him reluctantly into a little square booth-like place, and Mollie scribbled a telegram on the blank he gave her. Then they hurried out to the machine again. A little way down the road Amy turned and looked back. The fellow had resumed his lounging position and was looking after them with his little red-rimmed eyes.It was several days after the telegram had come which had so upset them and their plans, and they were sitting dejectedly on the sand at the foot of the bluff trying to read. The attempt had proved a failure, however, and one after another the books had dropped to their laps while they stared disconsolately out over the water."
"""No!"" Mollie was very positive. ""The boy will be coming with the provisions and letters in a little while, and there may be a telegram or something from mother. If there isn't pretty soon, I'll go mad.""""It's all very well for you to talk,"" Mollie retorted, in her nervous state saying something she never would have thought of saying under normal conditions, ""but nothing terrible has happened to you yet. Wait till it does. Then maybe it won't be so easy to get your mind off it.""""You're a darling!"" cried Mollie. She gave the Little Captain another bear's hug, then sat down in the sand again with her arms clasped about her knees. ""It's this everlasting uncertainty and the feeling of helplessness that gets on one's nerves so. I always did hate to wait for anything--especially with my imagination.""""Isn't that the boy with the mail?"" asked Betty after a minute, as the rumble of an antiquated vehicle and a masculine voice addressing in no uncertain tones a pair of invisible mules came to their ears. ""Perhaps he's bringing good news to us. Come on, we'll meet him half way.""Relieved at the prospect of action, the girls sprang to their feet, dusted off the clinging sand, and scrambled up the bluff. A minute more and they were running down the hill pell mell toward the oncoming team.The driver, the same gauky, red-headed country lad who had brought them their trunks, drew rein as the fleet-footed girls reached him and swept off his crownless hat with a gallantry that left nothing to be desired.""I'm bringing your provisions,"" he began, adding loquaciously, for he loved to talk and seldom got the opportunity: ""Sorry I couldn't get 'em to you yesterday, but Abe up to the store took sick and he says to me, 'Jake,' he says, 'guess mebbe you'll have to be storekeeper an' delivery boy both to-day. Shake a leg,' he says, 'an' I might mebbe give you a dollar extry. You never can't tell,' he says. He's that generous like, Abe is,"" the boy shook his head sadly at the thought of Abe's generosity, ""that he'd give a whole chicken to a kid dyin' of hunger, pervided he knowed the chicken had the pip.""""Yes, yes, we know,"" interrupted Mollie, reaching impatiently for the crumpled yellow envelope which he took from his pocket, smoothed out carefully, and handed to her with maddening deliberation. ""Oh, if anything terrible has happened I'll never forgive myself for not going to the station yesterday!""""But it was raining so hard, and we expected the boy any minute."" Amy thus tried to console her but it is doubtful if Mollie even heard her. She had torn open the envelope and was devouring the message whole while the girls looked at her anxiously.The red-headed orator, seeing that his presence was no longer in demand, clucked to his team and jogged off reluctantly. A telegram is rather a rarity in Bluff Point and they might have taken pity on a fellow and given him at least a hint of its contents. But there, he didn't want to know anyway--wouldn't if he could! Still, these out-landers were mighty mean, close-mouthed folks!"
"""Nothing,"" said Mollie, in response to the unspoken question of the girls. ""They haven't found a trace of either of them yet, but the police are confident that it is a case of kidnapping and that they will be able to round up the criminals in a short time. Poor little Dodo! Poor little Paul! If nothing worse happens to them they will be scared to death. Oh, if I could only get hold of those kidnappers I'd--I'd kill 'em!"" She clenched her hands passionately and her lips shut in a straight, grim little line.""To think I could forget letters!"" she marveled, as she distributed them to their rightful owners. ""Here's one for you, Amy, and two for you, Grace. One for Mrs. Ford and one for Mollie and--and--two for me--""""I don't know what you mean,"" said Betty, trying to look dignified and failing utterly, while Mollie and Amy continued to stare their amazement. They had forgotten completely that night spent under the hospitable roof of Mrs. Barnes, and even her son's engaging personality had faded from their minds. There had been so many things to think about and worry about. So now they both said together:""I told him where we were going,"" cried Betty desperately, driven into a corner. ""But I had no idea he was going to write to me until--until--"" hesitating as a picture of Joe Barnes, standing beside her car and asking if he might tell her ""how things were with him"" came vividly before her eyes.""I don't see what right--"" Betty was beginning spiritedly when she caught Mollie's eye and ended in a little helpless laugh. ""I suppose I'll have to tell you all about it or you'll turn a simple little molehill into a mountain.""""Nonsense,"" said Betty, almost crossly. ""He simply said he hadn't been allowed to get into the army because of ill health, but now that he felt well again he was going to try once more. It was that he wanted to write and tell me about. And because I was really interested, I said he might. That's all.""""A letter for mother?"" she cried. ""Oh, give it to me, Betty. It may be from dad. Oh, it is! It is!"" she exclaimed, as she saw her father's familiar writing. ""He must have heard about Will. Mother! Mother--"" she broke away from the girls and took the porch steps two at a time, waving the letter wildly as she went."
"They found Mrs. Ford in the living room, pale and trembling a little, holding the envelope in her hand as though she dared not open it. Grace had collapsed in a chair and was gazing up at her mother with such agonized pleading in her eyes that the girls could not look at her.Then very slowly Mrs. Ford tore open the envelope. At the same moment the girls seemed to sense that they might be in some manner intruding, and with one accord they moved over to the window and stood looking out.""Read it,"" they heard Mrs. Ford say in a choked voice, as a rustle of paper told that she had handed the letter to Grace. ""I can't tell you dear. Oh, my boy, my boy!"" And she sank down in a chair and covered her face with her hands.They were startled by a muffled sob, and turned in time to see Amy rush from the room. Poor little Amy! In the excitement and grief of the moment they had forgotten that she might also be affected by this news of Will!""There isn't going to be any next,"" said Betty, but in her heart she was not so sure. Almost everyone in the world was suffering, one way or another, and it was only to be expected that they would get their full share.But this new report from Washington seemed to put an end to that hope, and there was nothing to do but to face the terrible reality. Will was seriously wounded in some hospital in France, and, as Grace had said, that might mean that even now he was in a critical condition, perhaps, for all they knew, he had died out there away from all his dear ones and the friends that loved him.""I don't suppose there is any use acting as though he were dead already,"" said Mollie, breaking in upon her unhappy reverie. ""There have been several thousand wounded soldiers over there who have recovered.""""Yes, only to be sent back again to the firing line and have it done all over,"" said Betty bitterly, for, for a time at least, her staunch optimism had deserted her and she was ready to see the blackest side of everything.""Yes, it does seem that once a soldier has gone down to the very gates of death, he should be exempted,"" sighed Mollie, adding dispiritedly: ""But I suppose if they made that a rule they wouldn't have any armies left after awhile.""""And the boys themselves don't want to be exempted,"" said Betty, feeling a little thrill of pride in spite of her heartache. ""Their one biggest reason for getting well is to be able to get another 'whack at the Hun.'""""Shall we go and see if we can cheer up Amy?"" she asked after an interval filled with gloomy meditation. ""She is so brave and quiet about everything that you never have a chance to guess how hard she is taking her trouble. Poor girl!""""I suppose it won't do any harm to try,"" agreed Mollie, rising wearily. ""But I wish somebody would lend me a smile for a little while till I get mine back again. I might be able to play the role of merry little sunshine better.""""I--I'd rather not,"" replied the voice falteringly. ""I'm all right, and I'll be out in a minute. Please don't worry about me. You ought to be used to my making a goose of myself by this time."" This last accompanied by a pitiful little attempt at a laugh."
"""All right, Honey,"" Betty spoke sympathetically, for she had often seen the time when even her best friend would have been in the way. ""We only wanted to help, that's all. When you want us we'll be in my room.""""Well, I guess all we can do now is just sit still and wait till somebody wants us,"" said Betty, sitting down irresolutely and folding her hands. It was this last action that reminded her of the letter from Joe Barnes which she had not yet read. Although she had been holding it in her hand all the while, she had completely forgotten there was such a person as the writer.""That's so,"" she said. ""You never did find out whether or not Joe Barnes had been accepted. Tell me about it. I'd welcome a diversion--a cyclone or a tidal wave or anything--if it would only get my mind off our troubles.""It was a long letter, filled with youthful enthusiasm. In it the youth spoke his pleasure in meeting her and his hope that she would not only answer this letter but would allow him to write to her often.""N-no,"" sobbed Betty, raising eyes that were shining through her tears. ""I just love them so--all those splendid boys that are so crazy to give their lives for their country, that my heart gets too full sometimes, that's all.""""Yes,"" said Betty, feeling for a handkerchief. ""And he is simply wild with joy, Mollie,"" she added, while the color flooded her face. ""The Germans simply can't last long with that spirit against them. It makes our boys indomitable!"" Betty woke up the next morning with a sense of deadly depression weighing her down. For a few moments she lay staring up at the ceiling trying to collect her thoughts. Then the events of the day before came back to her and she frowned unhappily.The whereabouts of poor little Dodo and Paul was still a mystery, and Will Ford, whom she had come to regard almost as a brother, was terribly wounded somewhere in France. She probably would never see him again.And there was Allen too, to worry about every minute of the day and night. She had not heard from him in--oh, ages. Yes, it must be every bit of two weeks since she had read his last letter. For all she knew, he might be worse off than poor Will.There was no relief there from the gloom of her thoughts, for the sky was leaden and overcast, looking as if it, too, were mourning for the troubles of the world, and the surf beat loud and threateningly on the shore.""What has happened to you?"" asked Grace, opening her eyes again in surprise at this unheard of advice. Then as the full force of her trouble came home to her she turned over noisily and burrowed her head into the pillow."
"""Goodness, I hope it won't be that long before we have any good news,"" said Betty, trying to speak lightly. This would never do, she thought. They simply had to find some way out of this terrible slough of despondency before it mastered them completely.""I'm going to get up,"" she announced briskly, jumping out of bed. ""I've got to find something to keep me busy till that good news of ours feels like coming along. I'm getting absolutely morbid just sitting around and thinking.""""There's the house to be put in order,"" Betty pointed out, recovering a little of her old spirits, now that she had decided on a definite plan of action. ""And we never have really unpacked our trunks because Mollie has been undecided about staying.""""Yes, I know. And my clothes are a perfect wreck. I haven't a thing to put on that doesn't look as if it had been through the wars,"" Grace agreed. ""Not that it really matters,"" she added indifferently.""Of course it makes a difference,"" returned Betty sharply. She was determined to rouse Grace out of her lethargy, no matter what means she had to take. ""Don't you know that when you are dressed neatly and becomingly everything seems brighter and more hopeful? And, anyway,"" she added, watching Grace out of the corner of her eye, ""it isn't like you to be careless about your dress.""""Well, it isn't like me either to go moping around as if I had one foot in the grave and the other was slipping,"" retorted Grace, with a spirit that showed the experiment had worked. ""I don't think it's nice for you to make remarks like that when you know how I'm feeling and the excuse I have.""""Nobody has any excuse for giving up and acting as if everything were lost when it isn't,"" said Betty decidedly. ""If our soldiers did that the first time they had to retreat, how long do you suppose our army would last?""""No he isn't my brother,"" returned Betty, knowing she was going to hurt her friend but believing that the result would justify the means. ""But if he were I would try to behave so that when he came back he would have a right to be proud of me.""""Now you have done it, Betty, my dear,"" said Betty making a little face at her pretty reflection in the mirror. ""I shouldn't wonder if Grace would never speak to you again. Poor Gracie, perhaps I shouldn't have said what I did, but I simply had to start something.""""Look out!"" she cried suddenly, making both the girls jump. ""You nearly stuck that hairpin in your eye, Amy,"" she explained, as they looked at her reproachfully, ""and that isn't the place for it you know.""""If something doesn't happen pretty soon,"" put in Amy, with another deep sigh, ""I'll just naturally pass away. I wonder,"" she added, looking really interested in the subject, ""if anybody ever did die of the blues."""
"""I don't believe so--but there's always hope,"" said Betty dryly, adding with sudden spirit; ""Now look here, girls, something's got to be done about this. We really will make ourselves sick if we don't try to look on the hopeful side of things. It won't do anybody, least of all, ourselves, any good to sit here and mope all day. We've just got to fight against depression and cheer up.""""That's all very well for you, Betty,"" Amy voiced almost the same sentiment as Grace had only a few moments ago, ""but you are the only one of us who hasn't been hurt personally. Suppose it were Allen. Would you feel the same way then--about cheering up and taking it bravely?""""I hope I would,"" she said steadily. ""And if I didn't, I would surely feel ashamed of myself. It isn't,"" she paused at the door and looked back at them, ""as though Will or the twins were dead. We have hope in both cases, so I don't see any use of giving up. You talk,"" she choked back a sob, ""as though I didn't sympathize, as if I were an outsider just because nothing has happened to--Allen--yet--"" her voice choked in a real sob this time and she fled from the room.And so gradually Betty came to feel herself more or less of an outsider with these girls who were so close to her. And it was all because they misunderstood her effort to cheer them up and thought she could not feel for them because nothing terrible had happened to her yet.""I'll show them,"" she told herself fiercely, ""if anything should happen to Allen--"" But she shivered and turned away shudderingly from the thought. Allen--if only she could see him for five minutes--just five minutes--They were, as usual, sitting on the sand and trying to occupy their minds with sewing or reading, yet always with an eye to the road in readiness to rush to their red-headed combination of delivery boy and postman whenever he saw fit to put in an appearance.Betty opened her mouth to say something, but closed it again. She had learned that any suggestion she might make would be wrongly interpreted by the girls who were engrossed in their own troubles, and so she had wisely decided to say nothing.""Betty, is that what you read so carefully every night?"" asked Mollie, wide-eyed. ""Oh, I don't see how you ever have the courage!"" as Betty nodded. ""If I saw the name of anybody I--I--cared for in that dreadful list, I don't know what I'd do.""""Oh, I don't know,"" returned the Little Captain, while a wistful light grew in her eyes and her lips quivered. ""When I don't find--what I'm afraid to find--I feel like a criminal who has been reprieved, and it gives me courage to face another day.""Then suddenly the girls saw Betty in her true light. Why, she was suffering too! Think of her reading that awful list every night with fear in her heart! And in the light of this revelation, her brave efforts to cheer them seemed suddenly heroic."
"Then everybody cried a little and the girls called themselves all sorts of awful names for being ""brutes"" to their adored Little Captain, and when the storm cleared up everything seemed brighter and they could even smile a little.Then that night, when the little god of hope seemed about to take his accustomed place in the hearts of the Outdoor Girls, there came another blow, even more staggering than the ones that had gone before.""That means,"" said Betty, lifting a face so still and white that it startled the girls, ""that he is either dead or worse than dead. I would a thousand times rather he were dead than have him taken prisoner by the Germans.""""That's what missing almost always means,"" insisted Betty, still in that strange, lifeless voice. ""That,"" she added, as though speaking to herself, ""was the column I always read first, because I was most afraid of it. I think,"" she got up unsteadily, and Mollie ran around to her, ""that if you don't mind, I'll go upstairs a little while.""""I--I really think that if she doesn't call us in a few minutes, we'd better go up anyway,"" said Grace nervously. ""She looked so terribly queer and unlike herself that I'm worried to death. Hark! Did you hear something?""So still and white and rigid it was that the girls would have been still more frightened could they have seen it. For, propped on her elbows, with grim, set face supported by her clenched fists, Betty was gazing unseeingly out at the darkness beyond the square of window pane.""Somewhere he's out there,"" she kept saying over and over to herself. ""If he's dead, there's the mud and grime--"" she shuddered ""--and blood too--rivers of it. But if he's captured--Oh, I can't think--I mustn't think--""A flash of lightning greeted her, illumining the world outside, flashing into bold relief the familiar objects of the little room. She knelt down by the window, regardless of danger, and lifted her face to the rising wind.""Don't try not to cry, Honey,"" whispered Mollie, putting an understanding arm about the Little Captain's shoulders and holding her close. ""Tears are just the very best things in the world to help one through a crisis.""""Yes,"" added Grace, gently smoothing the hair back from Betty's hot forehead, while Amy sprinkled some toilet water on a fresh handkerchief and slipped it unobtrusively into Betty's other hand, ""we'll just sit here and wait till you're all through.""All of which loving sympathy very nearly caused a fresh outburst on Betty's part. However, she finally got the better of the storm within her and even managed a little smile for the benefit of the girls.""Oh, but I'm not brave,"" denied Betty, turning back to them. ""I'm not the least little bit brave. I--I went all to pieces a few minutes ago. But he isn't reported dead,"" she added, drawing herself up, while two defiant spots of color burned in her face. ""And until he is, I'm going to hold on to the hope that he is coming back. Nobody can take that from me, anyway!""""Now, you're making me ashamed of myself,"" said Grace in a small voice, while the tears glistened in her eyes. ""Here I've been imagining the very worst, while you-- Oh, Betty, forgive me, won't you, Dear?"""
"The next day dawned gloriously bright, and the girls chose to take it as a good omen. Following Betty's example, they stopped moping about and imagining the worst, and, although there was not a minute of the day when their hearts were not aching, they managed to smile when the others were looking and to speak hopefully of the future. Under Betty's gallant leadership, they had set up hope in their hearts and refused to give despair a foothold.""That is a terrible record for Outdoor Girls,"" Betty agreed. She was bustling busily about the cheerful kitchen making a tempting blueberry pie. There were circles under her eyes and she looked very pale for Betty, but her voice was bright and cheery.""I ought to get a letter from mother to-day,"" said Mollie, as her feet sank in the soft sand. ""She said yesterday that the detectives had picked up a clue and thought they were on the right trail at last.""""Oh, I don't know,"" Mollie replied wearily. ""I didn't think there was any use telling you until I had something really definite. You know the chief business of a detective is nosing out false clues,"" she finished scornfully.""Yes, it was splendid,"" Mollie admitted, but the reference proved to be an unfortunate one. It brought back vividly the picture of Will as he had been then, at the height of his triumph over the apprehension of the spy--in which the Outdoor Girls had also played an important part--and jubilant at the prospect of being able to join the colors at last and fight in the army of democracy.For one terrible moment the thought of sharks dashed into Betty's mind and she shuddered. But the next minute reason reasserted itself and she realized that sharks had never been seen on this coast. Baby ones, perhaps, but not the man-eating variety.Amy clutched her shoulder, and slowly the Little Captain turned about, saving her strength for the long swim back. She could not be too long about it either, she thought desperately. Amy was almost exhausted and had all she could do to keep her head above the water.It all depended on her, Betty. If she could get to shore, carrying the double weight before Amy's strength left her and she gave up altogether, all well and good. But if she could not--she groaned and set herself grimly to her task.She had covered about an eighth of the distance back when her heart leapt suddenly and she gave a sigh of relief. There were two other bobbing caps on the water coming rapidly nearer--and those two caps could belong to nobody but Mollie and Grace.That meant help--and, oh, she did need help! She was putting forth all her strength, but to her agonized fancy she was not going forward at all. Amy's almost dead weight dragging at her shoulder seemed a nightmare. Yet she dreaded beyond anything else to be relieved of the weight for that would mean--. She refused to put the awful thought into words, merely driving herself on more desperately. And all the time she was gasping out words of hope and courage to the poor girl she supported."
"""Give her to me, Betty,"" she directed. ""I guess you're about all in. That's it, Amy; grasp my shoulder with your other hand. Get a good grip before you let go of Betty. That's the way. Now we're all right. Between us we'll have you in in a jiffy. All right, Betty? Do you need help yourself?""But Betty shook her head, her long steady strokes keeping her even with Mollie. In a moment Grace came up to them and directed Amy to put her free hand on her shoulder, and in this fashion they finally reached shallow water.It did not take very long to bring her back to consciousness, for Amy had a wonderful constitution and strong vitality. However, it seemed ages to the anxious girls who worked over her, and when at last she opened her eyes they were ready to cry with relief.""I swam out farther than I meant to,"" Amy went on, as though they had not spoken. ""And when I tried to get back I found that something was wrong with my right leg."" She was shivering with exhaustion and the memory of the awful experience she had gone through, but when the girls tried to stop her she would not listen and hurried on feverishly.""It was a cramp I guess, and the harder I tried to get rid of it the worse it got till finally I got panic-stricken. I called to you girls, but you didn't seem to hear me. Then--"" she paused, and the girls held their breath as she looked around at them. ""Then--I went down. I came up again and called, and--and--I saw you, Betty. Oh, it was terrible!""""There's no reason why you can't be sure of it after a while,"" Betty pointed out. ""You see, we girls are pretty well out of practice. It's a long time since we did any swimming to amount to anything, and our muscles are weak and flabby. Why, we all got tired out to-day twice as quickly as we ordinarily would.""""They received a letter,"" Mollie explained, sinking down on a step of the porch while the others crowded about her eagerly, ""from some old rascal--oh, if I could only get my hands on him!"" she paused to glare about her ferociously, but they impatiently hurried her on.""Yes. But they ran away first,"" explained Mollie, almost beside herself with anger and excitement. ""And this old--brute! found them, and, I suppose because they were well dressed, thought he saw a way to make some easy money. Oh, my poor darlings! My poor little Paul and Dodo! Girls, we've just got to find them, that's all. I can't sit here and do nothing a minute longer."""
"""Oh, the police! Of course they are on the job--or think they are,"" interrupted Mollie scornfully. ""But I don't believe they will be able to find our babies in a thousand years. And every time I think of them, frightened to death! Oh, our precious babies!""""They told him, of course,"" said Mollie. ""Poor little trusting angels, of course they would think any grown person was their friend. Oh, if they had only fallen in with some respectable person instead of that--that--"" she could think of nothing bad enough to call the man who had stolen the twins.""Of course,"" Mollie agreed, two angry spots of color in her cheeks. ""And equally of course they have promised to do all in their power to apprehend the villain. But it makes me wild to just sit here and do nothing!""""Neither do I,"" cried Mollie, jumping to her feet and beginning to pace restlessly up and down the porch. ""That's the worst of it. I feel so absolutely helpless. And all the time I have no way of knowing what horrible thing may be happening--""""Oh, the man is probably treating them pretty decently,"" said Betty, adding, reasonably: ""If he hopes to get all that money from your mother he isn't going to take a chance on losing it by harming the twins.""""I know,"" cried Mollie, stopping in her restless promenade to regard Betty. ""But how in the world is mother going to raise any such sum of money? Twenty thousand dollars--why, we haven't that much ready cash in the world!""""But how long is he going to keep on hoping?"" cried Mollie, turning on her. ""He knows mighty well that if mother had that much money she would move heaven and earth to get it together and get the twins back. And the very fact that she hasn't--""""Oh, but that doesn't always follow,"" Betty broke in eagerly. ""There are a great many people who, even if they had the money, would try to bring the rascal to justice before they submitted to blackmail.""""For the next few weeks, yes,"" admitted Mollie. ""But he isn't going to wait forever, and when he finds out that mother can't raise the money what would be the natural thing for him to do? Get the twins out of the way, of course,"" she said, answering her own question.""It's all my fault,"" said Mollie contritely, noticing suddenly how white Amy's face was and how dark were the circles under her eyes. ""I let my own affairs make me forget everything else. Why didn't you say something, Amy?"""
"Even had the sun been shining brightly, they would have felt depressed, what with Amy's accident and the bad news Mollie had received; but with the wind wailing dolefully and black darkness in the middle of the day, they felt themselves growing utterly discouraged.Grace had heard no further news of Will, and the one straw of hope that she clutched so desperately was that he had not died, or surely her father would have heard. In this case, no news was good news to a certain extent.And as for Betty, brave as she had tried to be since that terrible night when she had read Allen's name among the missing, even she felt her courage slipping--slipping, and began to wonder if after all, hoping did any good.To-day, as she stood before the mirror, mechanically putting up her hair and looking through and past her own reflection, her eyes suddenly lost their preoccupied stare and became focused upon herself. For the first time in days she was seeing herself without the mask of cheerfulness she had so determinedly assumed. And as she looked, her eyes suddenly filled with tears--tears almost of self-pity.For the mirror told her, what she had scarcely realized, just how much she had suffered. Her eyes, usually so bright and merry, were dark and brooding. Her face looked thin and drawn, and her lips--those lips that had always seemed to smile even when her eyes were grave--had a pathetic, wistful droop, and there were lines, yes, actually lines, about them.Yet all the while she knew that if it were possible for Allen to see her or for her to see Allen, the face in the mirror would disappear as if by magic and the old Betty would return, for joy would have taken its place in her heart. ""I wonder if it is going to rain forever,"" cried Mollie petulantly, beating a restless tattoo on the window pane. ""As if we weren't forlorn enough without the old weather making things a hundred times worse.""""They say troubles never come singly, and I guess they're right,"" sighed Amy. She was sitting near the window in the brightest spot she could find--which was not very bright at that--knitting and trying her best not to think of Will. The result was that he was never for a minute out of her mind.""And left to myself I wouldn't say that much,"" returned Grace moodily, adding, as they turned to stare at her: ""It seems as if I never open my mouth these days but what I say something unpleasant, so I made up my mind last night that I wouldn't talk till I had something cheerful to talk about.""Mollie turned from the window and looked at them, and the whole situation suddenly appealed to her rather hysterical sense of humor. She began to laugh, and the longer she laughed the harder she laughed till she sank into a chair and shook with mirth.Betty obediently sat down to the piano, but her fingers wandered over the keys uncertainly. She did not want to play. Music, good music, always roused in her a feeling of exquisite sadness, a pain that was akin to joy, and in her present mood she was afraid to play.She struck a chord of exquisite harmony, and every fibre in her seemed yearningly to respond. She had meant to play something bright and cheerful, but almost against her will her fingers wandered into Grieg's ""To Spring.""The elusive, plaintive melody floated throbbingly out into the room, while the girls sat motionless, fascinated. They had never heard Betty play just this way before, and instinctively they knew that she was showing them her heart.""You shouldn't have asked me,"" she said, when they tried to comfort her. ""I knew I couldn't play without making a f-fool of myself. It was the one--Allen loved best--"" the last words so low that they had to bend close to hear them.""Poor little Betty!"" cried Mollie, stroking her hair gently. ""It was selfish of us to ask you, but you did play it wonderfully,"" she added with a sudden little burst of enthusiasm. ""You had us all hypnotized."""
"""No'm, I reckon mos' likely I couldn't,"" he answered amiably, adding with a return of the loquacity that was his most marked failing: ""I remember one year we had a storm near's bad as this, an' Luke Bailey, he got kind of short o' pervisions--campin' in the woods he was--an' he tried to drive his team into town--""""I got this here package of letters,"" he replied, seeming suddenly to remember the cause of his errand. ""Some o' them came a couple o' days ago, but I said to myself I might jest as well wait an' see if the weather didn't clear up--""""A letter,"" she gasped, holding out an envelope with the familiar red diamond in the corner. She was shaking from head to foot. ""Girls, oh, girls, it's from Allen!"" Then she turned and fled from the room.""It looks that way,"" said Mollie, two spots of color beginning to burn in her face. Then she turned to the boy who was still staring stupidly from one to the other of them. Even the story of Luke Bailey had been temporarily driven from his mind.""Miss Nelson,"" Mollie explained, taking pity on his bewilderment, ""has received the most wonderful news, and we can't thank you enough for bringing it to her. Can't we get you a cup of tea or something?"" she offered, rather vaguely.But the boy refused, and seeing that they were all tremendously excited about something, he finally took his leave, feeling very much abused that his story of Luke and his adventures had not been listened to with the attention it deserved.""He's not missing--never was!"" she cried, waving the letter wildly in the air, beside herself with relief and joy. ""He's just as well as ever he was, and Grace darling, and Amy, too, he says, he says--"" ""'Poor old Will certainly did have a narrow escape,'"" she read, ""'but thanks to the gods he is out of danger now. I went to see him yesterday--got leave for the first time in weeks--and he was looking mighty chipper. No wonder, with the good looking nurse he had.'"" ""'But do you know what that old boy said when I happened to comment upon the excellent nursing he must have had?'"" Grace read on, while Amy tried hard to look unconcerned. ""'He reached under his pillow and pulled out three pictures. ""Those are my three girls,"" he said, and I swear there was moisture in his eyes. ""You probably won't believe me, old man, but there isn't a girl or woman over here who could make me look twice at her unless she resembles one of those,"" and he pointed to the photographs I still held. ""'And when I opened them there was Mrs. Ford's face smiling up at me as sweet as life, and Grace with her best Gibson Girl expression--you can tell her from me that that is some picture of her--And who do you think the third was?'"" ""'It was Amy Blackford,'"" Grace read on, ""'And it was one fine picture of her too. Gosh, I didn't know it was as serious as all that, did you, little girl? But then the war does make a fellow feel about ten years older than he really is, and the girls at home suddenly seem the most desirable and necessary things on earth. And Amy did look so sweet and comfy and altogether like home that I couldn't blame the old chap."
"""'Then I pulled out the picture of the most beautiful girl in the world and we talked about home and--other things, you know--until we were ready to weep on each other's shoulders and the handsome nurse put me out.""That's all you get,"" she cried, ""the rest belongs to me. Oh, girls, did you ever hear such wonderful news? Allen strong and well and Will recovering splendidly, and both of them so sweet and loyal. Oh, I could kiss that beautiful red-haired angel who brought all this happiness to us. Where is he? Has he gone back again?""""Yes, he has, and what do we care!"" cried Grace wildly, her face radiant. ""Amy, you little goose, you're not crying are you? Don't you know there isn't a thing in the world to cry about? Come on--laugh, you sweet, comfy, little thing. Don't you know that Will is getting better and keeps our pictures under his pillow? That darling, wonderful, adorable boy. Great heavens!"" She stopped suddenly and a dismayed expression crept over her face. ""Excuse me, please,"" and she was racing up the stairs, leaving the girls to look after her, bewildered.""I hardly think so, since there isn't anything definitely settled yet,"" said Betty absently. She was thinking of Allen and what he had said in the part of his letter she would not let Grace read. Her eyes shone mistily and her heart sang. Allen, her Allen, was safe, and, oh, those wonderful things he had said!""Of course I do, you perfect brick!"" said Betty, hugging her fondly. ""But we can't any of us be really happy until we know you are. But even that is coming out all right, I'm sure of it,"" she finished gayly, her old optimism fully restored.""I won't be a death's head at the feast,"" she told herself savagely. ""I suppose I'm awfully wicked, but now that they are all so happy, it makes me feel dreadfully lonesome. I'm glad from my very heart for them, of course. But, oh, Paul! Oh, little Dodo! If you will only come back to Mollie, she will never go away from you again, never, never!"""
"Dinner that night for the other girls was a joyful occasion. The girls dressed up in their prettiest and best, Mrs. Ford and Betty cooked a most appetizing supper, and if it had not been for the one dark cloud still hanging over them, the evening that followed would have been the happiest they had ever spent.And how could she know as she lay there, restlessly tossing from side to side and muttering incoherently to herself, that the wind and waves were actually sending her an answer which, in her wildest moments, she could never have imagined?The wind had increased in fury while they slept, till now it was howling fiercely about the house, rattling the windows and whistling shrilly through the cracks, which together with the pounding of the waves, made an almost deafening uproar.""Mercy, it's raining in all over us!"" she tried aloud, and, springing out of bed, ran over to the window and closed it with a bang. When she came back she found Grace sitting up in bed and staring at her.""Search me,"" returned Betty, inelegantly. She had to almost scream to make herself heard above the noise of the storm. Furthermore, her feet were wet and her nightgown was wet, which did not serve to lift her spirits. In fact, she was feeling decidedly grumpy. ""The only thing I do know,"" she shouted, ""is that I'm nearly drowned.""""Don't you know that getting drowned at night is strictly forbidden?"" Grace began severely, but was promptly smothered by an avenging pillow. ""Why don't you get in bed?"" she asked, when she had succeeded in disentangling herself. Betty was sitting disconsolately on the dry side of the bed, which happened to be that occupied by Grace.""If you want to know, just feel the covers,"" Betty answered. ""Next time I'm going to make you sleep on the side near the window. Think I'll go in and see if Mollie and Amy are drowned yet,"" she added, starting for the door. ""Goodness, but this is a heavy storm!""Startled, she stood stock still, staring out in the direction from which that light had come. It seemed weird, eery--that lonesome light sending its signal out into the storm-whipped darkness. For that it was a signal, she did not for a minute doubt.Another followed, and another, and then the truth came home to Betty. Somewhere out there In that foaming sea a ship had met with disaster, perhaps at this moment was sinking and her crew, were sending out desperate appeals for aid.""There's a wrecked ship out there,"" Betty explained, her words stumbling over each other as she tried to make the girls understand. ""They are sending up signals for help, and if we don't get it for them right away it may be too late. Oh, girls, for all we know, it may be too late now!"" What happened in the next hour the girls never afterward clearly remembered. In what seemed a nightmare, they found their clothes, and, after turning things wrong side out, getting the left shoe on the right foot, and various other mishaps calculated to wreck the most well-balanced nervous system, they finally succeeded in getting them on."
"""There's a farmhouse about a mile down the road,"" explained Grace, ""and all the farm hands sleep on the premises. We can get them. And there's the life-saving station only a little way beyond. They may have seen the signals and be on their way already.""""We've got to--or at least make the attempt,"" cried Betty, pulling her coat more tightly about her. ""If nobody else will come, I'm going alone,"" she added, and the girls knew her well enough to be sure she meant it.She opened the door again, and this time, being prepared for the onslaught of the wind, merely gritted her teeth and ducked her head and plunged gamely into it. And without a minute's hesitation, the others, who were ""also Outdoor Girls,"" followed her.The fight with the wind that followed was all they had expected it would be--and more. Their clothes were whipped about their legs as if about to disengage themselves and fly away from their owners forever. And several times they were forced to stop and turn their backs to catch their breath and gather strength to go on.However, they accomplished the return trip in about half the time it had taken them to fight their way against the wind, and as the first bright rays of the sun gilded the country side, they found themselves back at the house, where Mrs. Ford was anxiously awaiting them.She had some breakfast prepared for them, which they ate standing, then rushed headlong down to the beach. The life-savers were already busily at work launching their sturdy boats, and as the girls followed the direction they were taking out to sea they suddenly saw the wrecked ship.Driven by the hurricane wind, it had been caught on one of those treacherous bars so common along this part of the coast. Part of the bottom had been torn away, and if the ship had not been so tightly wedged upon the bar it must certainly have sunk hours before. As it was, the starboard deck stood high in the air while the port side almost touched the water and was constantly swept by mountainous combers.""Look!"" cried Mollie, clutching her arm, ""They are filling the first boat. Oh, Betty, they'll certainly be swamped! I can't look!"" She turned away but the next minute her eyes were fixed strainingly upon the wreck again.""They're gone! They're gone!"" cried Amy, jumping up and down in her excitement as the boat sunk in the hollow between two huge combers and was lost to view. ""No, they're not! They're up again,"" as the boat, looking pathetically tiny in comparison to the vastness of the ocean, rose gallantly on the crest of a big wave and came rushing toward them, reeling from side to side. The next moment they were lost to view again.The girls were already racing eagerly toward it, and a few minutes later were welcoming the poor bedraggled survivors back to safety. There were nine of them in all, four women, one young girl, three men and a little boy. The child was sobbing and clung to his mother's skirts, terrified."
"Luckily the ship was a merchant vessel and carried very few passengers, so that the life-savers were confident of saving all those on board. Also the wind was beginning to abate and the sea was becoming less angry--all of which helped them in their work.""Mollie!"" Amy gasped, trying to catch her breath while her cheeks flamed with excitement, ""we just heard something we thought you ought to know. You know the woman with the little boy,"" she hurried on as Mollie was about to speak, ""well, while she was comforting her own child, she happened to speak of two other children on board--""""Girls,"" the word burst through dry lips as Mollie took a step toward them, ""what are you telling me? Oh, I can't bear to hope if--"" she grasped Grace's arm and shook it, not realizing how she hurt. ""Tell me,"" she cried, ""are they boy and girl--""A big, vicious looking man with black hair and black bushy eyebrows was lifting Dodo--her little Dodo--out of the boat. And while she looked, her heart beating wildly, hardly able to believe the evidence of her eyes, the man stretched out his hand for the boy, who sat crouched in the back of the boat. Then followed something that made Mollie cry out in rage.But her voice was drowned in a shriek from the twins as they tore themselves loose from the man and flung themselves upon her. She dropped to her knees in the sand and strained them to her, laughing, crying, sobbing out endearments while they clung to her frantically, burying their faces in her neck.With a cry Mollie jumped to her feet, an arm about each of the twins, and looked about for the man. The passengers who had also come ashore in the boat stood looking on in bewilderment. But the Spaniard had disappeared.""Where did that man go?"" cried Mollie frantically. ""There he is!"" she added, as she caught sight of him just approaching the foot of the bluff, evidently bent on flight. ""Don't let him get away! He's a kidnapper!""""Come on,"" cried Mollie, taking the beloved twins by the hand and starting back along the beach while the girls joyfully accompanied her, talking and ejaculating all at the same time, no one knowing what the other was saying--nor caring. The wonderful fact was enough for them.""Do with him?"" cried Mollie, regarding the Spaniard with flashing eyes. ""There isn't anything bad enough to do to him. But for the present, we'll have to be satisfied with locking him up. We have plenty of evidence,"" she added, waving that part of it aside with a motion of her hand. ""Letters and things, you know. He kidnapped my little brother and sister,"" indicating the twins, who snuggled close against her and regarded their former captor with terrified eyes, ""and then demanded twenty thousand dollars of my mother for their return."""
"It was many hours later and the dusk was falling softly over the land. The passengers of the wrecked ship had long ago started villageward, there to entrain for the city, leaving two of their number behind.These two were seated at the head of a long table in the little house at Bluff Point, devouring chicken and rice before an audience of admiring and joyful Outdoor Girls. Only Mollie very often could not see them for the tears that dimmed her eyes.""Oh, no, I didn't,"" Mollie answered. ""I sent a telegram by one of the boys who took that dirty Spaniard to the station. And, oh, girls,"" she leaned forward suddenly while the tears overflowed and slowly trickled down her face, ""if she does as I begged her to, she will be here to-morrow. Darling little mother!""""What a difference!"" said Betty softly, looking around the table. ""A few nights ago we were utterly miserable. Now we are wildly happy. We have the darling twins back again, and our boys 'over there' are safe. Girls,"" she cried, suddenly springing to her feet and raising her cup on high, ""let's drink a toast--""These are the adventures of a group of bright, fun-loving, up-to-date girls who have a common bond in their fondness for outdoor life, camping, travel and adventure. There is excitement and humor in these stories and girls will find in them the kind of pleasant associations that they seek to create among their own friends and chums.The Blythe Girls, three in number, were left alone in New York City. Helen, who went in for art and music, kept the little flat uptown, while Margy, just out of business school, obtained a position as secretary and Rose, plain-spoken and business like, took what she called a ""job"" in a department store. The experiences of these girls make fascinating reading--life in the great metropolis is thrilling and full of strange adventures and surprises.Among her ""fan"" letters Lilian Garis receives some flattering testimonials of her girl readers' interest in her stories. From a class of thirty comes a vote of twenty-five naming her as their favorite author. Perhaps it is the element of live mystery that Mrs. Garis always builds her stories upon, or perhaps it is because the girls easily can translate her own sincere interest in themselves from the stories. At any rate her books prosper through the changing conditions of these times, giving pleasure, satisfaction, and, incidentally, that tactful word or inspiration, so important in literature for young girls. Mrs. Garis prefers to call her books ""juvenile novels"" and in them romance is never lacking.Introducing Dorinda Fayre--a pretty blonde, sweet, serious, timid and a little slow, and Dorothy Rose--a sparkling brunette, quick, elf-like, high tempered, full of mischief and always getting into scrapes.Here is a thrilling series of mystery stories for girls. Nancy Drew, ingenious, alert, is the daughter of a famous criminal lawyer and she herself is deeply interested in his mystery cases. Her interest involves her often in some very dangerous and exciting situations.No subject has so thoroughly caught the imagination of young America as aviation.
