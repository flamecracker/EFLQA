passage
"As I was going to St. Ives, I met a man with seven wives, Every wife had seven sacks, Every sack had seven cats, Every cat had seven kits: Kits, cats, sacks, and wives, How many were there going to St. Ives? [One] Little boy blue, come blow your horn; The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn. Where's the little boy that looks after the sheep? He's under the hay-cock, fast a-sleep. Will you wake him? No, not I; For if I do, he'll be sure to cry. Trip and go, heave and ho! Up and down, to and fro; From the town to the grove, Two and two, let us rove, A-maying, a-playing; Love hath no gainsaying! So merrily trip and go! So merrily trip and go! When I was taken from the fair body, They then cut off my head, And thus my shape was altered. It's I that make peace between King and ring, And many a true lover glad. All this I do, and ten times more, And more I could do still; But nothing can I do Without my guider's will. [A quill pen] Ding, dong, bell, Pussy's in the well! Who put her in? Little Johnny Green; Who pulled her out, Big Tom Stout; What a naughty boy was that To try and drown poor pussy cat, Who never did any harm, And killed the mice in his father's barn. Here sits the Lord Mayor _forehead_ Here sit his two men _eyes_ Here sits the cock _right cheek_ Here sits the hen _left cheek_ Here sit the little chickens _top of nose_ Here they run in _mouth_ Chinchopper, chinchopper, Chinchopper, chin! _chuck the chin_ There was an Old Woman, And what do you think? She lived upon nothing but Victuals and drink; And though victuals and drink Were the chief of her diet, This little Old Woman Could never be quiet. There was a little boy and a little girl Lived in our alley; Says the little boy to the little girl, ""Shall I, oh, shall I?"" Says the little girl to the little boy, ""What shall we do?"" Says the little boy to the little girl, ""I will kiss you!"" I had a little nut-tree, nothing would it bear But a silver nutmeg and a golden pear; The king of Spain's daughter came to visit me, And all was because of my little nut-tree. I skipped over water, I danced over sea, And all the birds in the air couldn't catch me. Pickeleem, pickeleem, pummis-stone! What is the news, my beautiful one? My pet doll-baby, Frances Maria, Suddenly fainted, and fell in the fire; The clock on the mantle gave the alarm, But all we could save was one china arm."
"Pussy sits beside the fire. How can she be fair? In walks a little doggy--Pussy, are you there? So, so, Mistress Pussy, how do you do? Thank you, thank you, little dog, I'm very well just now. One misty, moisty morning, When cloudy was the weather, I chanced to meet an old man clothed all in leather. He began to compliment, and I began to grin. How do you do, and how do you do? And how do you do again? There was an old woman, her name it was Peg; Her head was of wood, and she wore a cork leg. The neighbors all pitched her into the water, Her leg was drown'd first, and her head follow'd a'ter. Whistle, daughter, whistle; whistle, daughter dear. I cannot whistle, mammy, I cannot whistle clear. Whistle, daughter, whistle, whistle for a pound. I cannot whistle, mammy, I cannot make a sound. Jockey was a piper's son, And he fell in love when he was young, And the only tune he could play Was, ""Over the hills and far away""; Over the hills and a great way off, And the wind will blow my top-knot off. There was an old woman had three cows, Rosy, and Colin, and Dun; Rosy and Colin were sold at the fair, And Dun broke his head in a fit of despair; And there was the end of her three cows, Rosy, and Colin, and Dun. One, he loves; two, he loves; Three, he loves, they say; Four, he loves with all his heart; Five, he casts away. Six, he loves; seven, she loves; Eight, they both love. Nine, he comes; ten, he tarries; Eleven, he courts; twelve, he marries. Hush, baby, my doll, I pray you, don't cry, And I'll give you some bread, and some milk by-and-bye; Or, perhaps, you like custard, or, maybe, a tart, Then to either you are welcome, with all my heart. A cat came fiddling out of a barn. With a pair of bag-pipes under her arm: She could sing nothing but fiddle cum fee, The mouse has married the bumble-bee; Pipe, cat--dance, mouse, We'll have a wedding at our good house. I won't be my father's Jack, I won't be my mother's Jill, I will be the fiddler's wife, And have music when I will. T'other little tune, T'other little tune, Prythee, love, play me T'other little tune. One, two, buckle my shoe; Three, four, shut the door; Five, six, pick up sticks; Seven, eight, lay them straight; Nine, ten, a good fat hen; Eleven, twelve, who will delve; Thirteen, fourteen, maids a-courting; Fifteen, sixteen, maids a-kissing; Seventeen, eighteen, maids a-waiting; Nineteen, twenty, my stomach's empty. Draw a pail of water For my lady's daughter; My father's a king, and my mother's a queen, My two little sisters are dressed in green, Slumping grass and parsley, Marigold leaves and daisies. One rush! Two rush! Pray thee, fine lady, come under my rush."
"I had a little pony I call'd him Dapple Gray, I lent him to a lady To ride a mile away. She whipped him, she slashed him, She rode him through the mire; I would not lend my pony now, For all the lady's hire. I went to the wood and got it; I sat me down and looked at it; The more I looked at it the less I liked it, And I brought it home because I couldn't help it. [A Thorn] Mary had a pretty bird,-- Feathers bright and yellow; Slender legs, upon my word, He was a pretty fellow-- The sweetest notes he always sung, Which much delighted Mary; And near the cage she'd ever sit, To hear her own canary. There was an old woman who lived in a shoe, She had so many children, she didn't know what to do. She gave them some broth, without any bread, She whipped them all around, and sent them to bed. Doctor Faustus was a good man, He whipped his scholars now and then; When he whipped them he made them dance Out of Scotland into France, Out of France into Spain, And then he whipped them back again! Riddle-me riddle-me riddle-me-ree, Perhaps you can tell what this riddle may be: As deep as a house, as round as a cup, And all the king's horses can't draw it up. [A Well] Jack Spratt could eat no fat, His wife could eat no lean, And so, betwixt them both, you see, They licked the platter clean. MORAL: Better to go to bed supperless than to rise in debt. A long-tailed pig, or a short-tailed pig, Or a pig without e'er a tail, A sow-pig, or a boar-pig, Or a pig with a curly tail. MORAL: Take hold of his tail, And eat off his head, And then you will be sure The pig-hog is dead. The streets were so broad, and the lanes were so narrow, I could not get my wife home without a wheel-barrow: The wheel-barrow broke, my wife got a fall, Down tumbled wheel-barrow, little wife, and all. MORAL: Provide against the world, and hope for the best. Ding, dong, bell, The cat is in the well! Who put her in? Little Johnny Green; What a naughty boy was that To try to drown poor pussy cat, Who never did any harm, And killed the mice in his father's barn. MORAL: He that injures one threatens a hundred. [The following is a game played as follows: A string of boys and girls, each holding by his predecessor's skirts, approaches two others, who with joined and elevated hands form a double arch. After the dialogue, the line passes through, and the last is caught by a sudden lowering of the arm--if possible.] If all the seas were one sea, What a _great_ sea that would be! And if all the trees were one tree, What a _great_ tree that would be! And if all the axes were one axe, What a _great_ axe that would be! And if all the men were one man, What a _great_ man he would be! And if the _great_ man took the _great_ axe, And cut down the _great_ tree, And let it fall into the _great_ sea, What a splish, splash _that_ would be! ""Will you walk into my parlor?"" said the spider to the fly; ""'Tis the prettiest little parlor that ever you did spy. The way into my parlor is up a winding stair; And I have many curious things to show you when you're there."""
"""I'm sure you must be weary, dear, with soaring up so high; Will you rest upon my little bed?"" said the spider to the fly. ""There are pretty curtains drawn around; the sheets are fine and thin; And if you like to rest awhile, I'll snugly tuck you in!"" ""Oh, no, no,"" said the little fly; ""for I've often heard it said, They never, never wake again, who sleep upon your bed!"" The spider turned him round about, and went into his den, For well he knew the silly fly would soon come back again; So he wove a subtle web in a little corner sly, And set his table ready, to dine upon the fly. Then he came out to his door again, and merrily did sing,-- ""Come hither, hither, pretty fly, with the pearl and silver wing; Alas! alas! how very soon this silly little fly, Hearing his wily, flattering words, came slowly flitting by. With buzzing wings she hung aloft, then near and nearer drew, Thinking only of her brilliant eyes, her green and purple hue,-- Thinking only of her crested head--poor foolish thing! At last, Up jumped the cunning spider, and fiercely held her fast! He dragged her up his winding stair, into his dismal den, Within his little parlor,--but she ne'er came out again! And now, dear little children, who may this story read, To idle, silly, flattering words, I pray you ne'er give heed; Unto an evil counsellor close heart and ear and eye, And take a lesson from this tale of the Spider and the Fly. There once were two cats of Kilkenny, Each thought there was one cat too many, So they fought and they fit, And they scratched and they bit, Till, excepting their nails And the tips of their tails, Instead of two cats, there weren't any. There was a little man, And he had a little gun, And his bullets were made of lead, lead, lead; He went to the brook And saw a little duck, And he shot it through the head, head, head. He carried it home To his old wife Joan, And bid a fire for to make, make, make, To roast the little duck, He had shot in the brook, And he'd go and fetch her the drake, drake, drake. Come to the window, My baby, with me, And look at the stars That shine on the sea! There are two little stars That play at bo-peep With two little fish Far down in the deep; And two little frogs Cry neap, neap, neap; I see a dear baby That should be asleep. There was an old woman And nothing she had; And so this old woman Was said to be mad. She'd nothing to eat, She'd nothing to wear, She'd nothing to lose, She'd nothing to fear, She'd nothing to ask, And nothing to give, And when she did die, She'd nothing to leave. Goosey, goosey, gander, wither dost thou wander? Up stairs, and down stairs, and in my lady's chamber. There I met an old man, who would not say his prayers; I took him by the left leg, and threw him down stairs. Tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee Resolved to have a battle, For tweedle-dum said tweedle-dee Had spoiled his nice new rattle. Just then flew by a monstrous crow, As big as a tar-barrel, Which frightened both the heroes so, They quite forgot their quarrel. Peter Piper picked a peck Of pickled pepper; A peck of pickled pepper Peter Piper picked; If Peter Piper picked a peck Of pickled pepper, Where's the peck of pickled pepper Peter Piper picked? God bless the master of this house, The mistress bless also, And all the little children That round the table go; And all your kin and kinsmen, That dwell both far and near: I wish you a merry Christmas, And a happy new year. I love you well, my little brother, And you are fond of me; Let us be kind to one another, As brothers ought to be. You shall learn to play with me. And learn to use my toys; And then I think that we shall be Two happy little boys."

Robin the Bobbin, the big-bellied Ben, He eat more meat than fourscore men; He eat a cow, he eat a calf, He eat a hog and a half; He eat a church, he eat a steeple, He eat the priest and all the people! A cow and a calf, An ox and a half, A church and a steeple, And all the good people, And yet he complain'd that his stomach wasn't full. I have a little sister; they call her Peep, Peep. She wades the water deep, deep, deep; She climbs the mountains, high, high, high-- Poor little thing! she has but one eye. [A Star] Monday's bairn is fair of face, Tuesday's bairn is full of grace, Wednesday's bairn is full of woe, Thursday's bairn has far to go, Friday's bairn is loving and giving, Saturday's bairn works hard for its living; But the bairn that is born on the Sabbath day Is bonny, and blithe, and good and gay.

This is the Man all tatter'd and torn, That kiss'd the maiden all forlorn, That milk'd the cow with the crumpled horn, That toss'd the dog, that worried the cat, That kill'd the rat, that ate the malt, That lay in the house that Jack built.

Taffy was a Welchman, Taffy was a thief, Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef; I went to Taffy's house, Taffy wasn't home, Taffy came to my house and stole a marrow-bone; I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was in bed, I took the marrow-bone, and beat about his head. 1. I went up one pair of stairs, 2. Just like me. 1. I went up two pair of stairs, 2. Just like me. 1. I went into a room, 2. Just like me. 1. I looked out of a window, 2. Just like me. 1. And then I saw a monkey, 2. Just like me.
