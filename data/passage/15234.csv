passage
"_Pussy-cat sits by the fire--how should she be fair?_ _In walks the little dog--says ""Pussy are you there?_ _How do you do Mistress Pussy? Mistress Pussy, how do you do?""_ _""I thank you kindly, little dog. I fare as well as you!""_Penguin Books Ltd, Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England Viking Penguin Inc., 40 West 23rd Street, New York, New York 10010, U.S.A.

I am baking it in a pie-dish--a pie-dish with a pink rim. You never tasted anything so good! And _you_ shall eat it all! _I_ will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!"" wrote Ribby.Duchess read the letter and wrote an answer:--""I will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four. But it is very strange. _I_ was just going to invite you to come here, to supper, my dear Ribby, to eat something _most delicious_.""I am dreadfully afraid it _will_ be mouse!"" said Duchess to herself--""I really couldn't, _couldn't_ eat mouse pie. And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party. And _my_ pie was going to be veal and ham. A pink and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's.""""It is all ready to put into the oven. Such lovely pie-crust; and I put in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust; and I made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steam--Oh I do wish I could eat my own pie, instead of a pie made of mouse!""""A pink and white pie-dish--and _you_ shall eat it _all_. 'You' means me--then Ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself? A pink and white pie-dish! Ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins.... Oh what a good idea! Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?""Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog could come--she popped _her_ pie into the oven. There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff."
"""The top oven bakes too quickly,"" said Ribby to herself. ""It is a pie of the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon. And I have taken out all the bones; because Duchess did nearly choke herself with a fish-bone last time I gave a party. She eats a little fast--rather big mouthfuls. But a most genteel and elegant little dog; infinitely superior company to Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.""Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen. She shook the mats out at the front-door and put them straight; the hearthrug was a rabbit-skin. She dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece, and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs.Then she spread a very clean white table-cloth, and set out her best china tea-set, which she took out of a wall-cupboard near the fireplace. The tea-cups were white with a pattern of pink roses; and the dinner-plates were white and blue.""It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was _not_ in the oven when I put mine in! And I can't find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house. I put _my_ pie into a nice hot oven at the top. I could not turn any of the other handles; I think that they are all shams,"" said Duchess, ""but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse! I cannot think what she has done with it? I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!""She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. ""I am glad I used the _bottom_ oven,"" said Ribby, ""the top one would certainly have been very much too hot. I wonder why that cupboard door was open? Can there really have been someone in the house?""Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party. She ran so fast through the village that she was too early, and she had to wait a little while in the lane that leads down to Ribby's house.""I think""--(thought the Duchess to herself)--""I _think_ it would be wiser if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it. What very small fine pieces it has cooked into! I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a quicker oven than my own.""Duchess started! She opened the door of the _top_ oven; out came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie,--and through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty-pan!""Then I must have been eating MOUSE!... No wonder I feel ill.... But perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!"" Duchess reflected--""What a very awkward thing to have to explain to Ribby! I think I will put _my_ pie in the back-yard and say nothing about it. When I go home, I will run round and take it away."" She put it outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep."
