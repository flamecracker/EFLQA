passage
"The three chums--and three brighter, prettier girls it would be hard to find--were on their way to the grammar school which had just closed the week before. Laura had forgotten a book which she prized highly and was in hope that the janitor, a good-natured old fellow, would let her in long enough to get it. At the last minute she had asked the other girls to go with her.The three chums had lived in North Bend, a town of less than twenty thousand people, practically all their lives. The girls loved it, for it was a pretty place. Still, being only forty miles by rail from New York City, they had been taken to the roaring metropolis once in a while as a treat, and it was only with great difficulty that their parents had succeeded in luring them home again.Billie's father was the prominent Martin Bradley, well known among real estate and insurance men, and it was from him that Billie, whose real name was Beatrice, had taken her brown eyes and brown hair and even that merry, irrepressible imp of mischief that made Billie Bradley the most popular, best-loved girl in all North Bend.Laura's brother, Theodore, known to his intimates as Teddy, was a handsome boy, as full of wild spirits as Billie herself. Teddy had entertained a lively admiration for Billie Bradley since he was seven and she was six. Teddy was tall for his fifteen years, and had already made a name for himself in the field of athletics.Amanda was red-haired and freckled; and while these attributes alone could not have accounted for her unpopularity, she added to them a tendency to spy upon the other girls and then run and tell what she had seen or heard.""I don't think we ought to be too hard on her,"" said Violet, as they turned the corner that brought the school into view. ""She can't help her mean disposition, I suppose. And anyway, Miss Beggs says there's always some good to be found in everybody.""""Sure, an' I will that,"" Mr. Heegan assured them, leading the way into the school yard and pulling out his bunch of keys. ""It must be a verra important book,"" he added, smiling at them as he fitted the key in the lock, ""to be bringing you back to school after school's out.""""All right, there you go,"" said the good-natured janitor, swinging the door wide for them. ""I'm goin' home, but I'll be comin' back in a few minutes to lock up. You'd best not be stayin' here then,"" he added, with a twinkling backward glance at them, ""or it will be locked up for the night you'll be.""""There it is,"" she said, running to a desk at the farther end of the room and picking up from an inner corner a prettily bound book. ""Just the very place I left it, too. My, but I'm glad to get it back again.""But she got no further, for with an indignant cry the girls had rushed on her. Dropping both her air of command and her dignity, Billie scurried wildly around the room, keeping the desks between her and her pursuers.""Well, now she will tell and we couldn't run away even if we wanted to,"" said Billie, sinking down on a bench and looking at them wistfully. ""Of course we wouldn't really have wanted to,"" she added, after a minute of uncomfortable silence. ""Only it makes me mad to _have_ to do the right thing. Oh, I don't see why somebody doesn't run that Amanda person out of town,"" she went on, doubling up her fists and looking as if it might have been just as well for that ""Amanda person"" that she was not there at the minute.""Of course I'll have to make it good,"" she said, going over to the pieces again and regarding them mournfully. ""But how in the world am I ever going to get together a hundred dollars? It might just as well be a thousand as far as I'm concerned."" The last was a wail."
"""Well,"" cried Billie, straightening up suddenly and trying to look hopeful, ""I suppose it won't do any good to stand here and look at the pieces. Besides,"" she added with a start, ""we've been here a terribly long time, and we don't want the janitor to lock us in.""""What does it look as if I were doing?"" asked Billie, reaching for an old newspaper that lay in the forgotten paper basket. ""I might as well have the evidence of my crime. Anyway, I want to take them to Miss Beggs.""""And many's the time I've done the same in my day,"" said Mr. Heegan, with a nod, looking not nearly as shocked as the girls thought he would. ""And sure, what are you made young for, if it wasn't that you was meant to be skylarkin' all the time?""""Yes, it makes you feel like a book agent,"" chuckled Billie. ""But oh, girls,"" she added, ""I didn't know how much I dreaded facing Miss Beggs till I found out I didn't have to. I don't mind writing to her nearly so much.""""Well, if it hadn't been for me and my old book,"" she explained, ""we wouldn't have gone back to school, and then you wouldn't have gotten yourself into all that trouble. I really do feel guilty,"" she added earnestly. ""I wish you would at least let me help you pay for it, Billie.""""And I suppose you're to blame for my climbing the bookcase, too,"" she chided her fondly. ""No, Laura dear, it's all my fault and you can't make me put the blame on any one else. But, oh!"" she wailed, ""how in the world am I ever going to raise that hundred dollars?"" The sun was flooding Billie Bradley's room when she awoke the next morning, and she sat up in bed with the feeling that it must be very late. She glanced at the little clock on the dresser and saw that its hands pointed to half past eight.""School!"" she said, stretching her arms above her head with a delicious sense of freedom. ""As the old man said: 'They ain't no sech animile.' I guess I might just as well get up, though, for I feel as if I were starving to death.""The room was cheerful with sunlight, for Mrs. Bradley had often said that a bright dining-room had more to do with making a happy home than any other one thing. But this morning Billie did not even notice it.""Oh, but, Debbie,"" said Billie, using the coaxing tone that even black Deborah, tyrant of the household, could never quite resist, ""remember how many mornings I have had to get up at seven and go out in the drizzling rain and--""""All right, honey, all right,"" said Deborah, her heart touched by this reference to the hardships her young mistress had suffered. ""You go in 'tother room an' don't bother Debbie an' she'll bring you in the prettiest breakfast you ever did see.""From where she stood she commanded a full view of the tennis court, on which she could see that a warm set of singles was in progress. One of the players was Chet, and as she watched she saw him fling his racket high in the air."
"""I don't think Dad will be able to make it good just now,"" went on Chet, in that sober tone that made people in North Bend feel confidence in Chetwood Bradley, young as he yet was. ""I heard him say the other day that all his capital was tied up. And then it costs so much to live--"" That afternoon Billie took herself and a book out on the porch and tried hard, but unsuccessfully, to forget her troubles. The more she tried to fix her attention on the printed page before her, the more the broken statue rose before her eyes until at last she closed the book with a slam and bounced impatiently in her seat.""That horrid old 'Girl Reading a Book' has spoiled my whole summer for me,"" she said, her lips pouting rebelliously. ""I wish I hadn't gone back to the old school anyway. I might have known it would bring me bad luck. Oh, here comes Laura,"" and her face brightened as she saw the familiar figure of her chum swinging up the street. ""I wonder what she wants. Whatever it is, she seems to be in a terrible hurry about it.""""I never did think of it in that way,"" she admitted, adding, after a minute's thought: ""Billie, dear, haven't you thought of some way you might pay for the statue? I didn't sleep a wink last night for thinking of it.""""Neither did I,"" said Billie gloomily, forgetting that she had in reality slept very soundly. ""Chet and I have started a fund with a dollar fifteen of his and seventy-five cents of mine. That's as far as we have got so far. I did think of Uncle Bill,"" she added slowly, mentioning a great uncle who occasionally visited them.""Oh, and I'm a perfect fright!"" cried Billie, her hands flying to her hair--hair, by the way, which was arranged in the very best manner to set off Billie's sparkling prettiness. ""Laura,"" she turned accusing eyes upon her chum, ""tell the truth. Did you know he was coming?""If ever a boy looked handsome, it was Teddy Jordon as he swung up the street to Billie's house. He was very tall, looking more like a lad of eighteen than the fifteen years he was. His fair hair waved back from a broad forehead, and his merry gray eyes sparkled with the joy of living.""Hello!"" he greeted the girls, as he took the porch steps two at a time and seated himself on the railing. ""Laura has been telling me of your escapade, Billie Bradley, and I've come to find out what you mean by going about busting busts--that isn't good English, is it?""""It doesn't sound just right,"" agreed Billie, dimpling adorably. ""You speak as if I were bust--pardon me, _breaking_ busts for a living. And it wasn't a bust, but a whole statue. No part way things for me!"""
"""I say, Billie,"" he said, his handsome eyes regarding her frankly, ""you know, I'm really awfully sorry about that business. It makes me mad that you should be troubled with it. You and I have always been pretty good friends, haven't we?"" he finished unexpectedly.""And if you are going around getting yourself sick with worry, what sort of good time do you think the rest of us are going to have?"" he burst out indignantly, and for the life of her Billie could not help smiling.""Well, I hope the old boy comes up to the scratch,"" he commented disrespectfully, adding hurriedly as Laura said good-bye to Nellie Bane and started toward them: ""And, Billie, if you change your mind about what I asked you let me know. Promise?""""Isn't it great to have friends?"" she asked a robin that had perched itself on the edge of the porch and was looking at her knowingly. ""And isn't Teddy the handsomest boy you ever saw?"" to which the robin, knowing little rascal that he was, nodded not once but twice.Chet came up on the porch a few minutes later and enticed Billie out for a game of tennis with him, hoping to get her mind off the broken statue. But while she was too full of life and health not to enjoy the swift, swinging game that Chet gave her, the thought of ""The Girl Reading a Book"" stayed constantly in the back of her mind.""A hundred dollars,"" her father repeated. ""Well, that's a lot to pay, Beatrice, for just a few minutes' reckless fun. Of course I can pay it, but that will mean putting off some affairs of more pressing importance--""""He is out of the country--gone on a business trip that has taken him on an ocean voyage,"" said her father. ""He will be gone for an indefinite period. I thought you knew, Billie. Though, as he just left, I suppose it is not strange you had not heard us speak of it."" And with that Mr. Bradley relapsed immediately into his brown study. Two weeks passed, and still Billie Bradley had found no solution to her problem. The broken statue seemed as far from being paid for as ever, and, as far as she was concerned, the summer vacation was completely spoiled.In this frame of mind she crushed a soft straw hat down over her brown hair one day and set out to find her chums, feeling the need of their sympathy. And how was she to know, poor Billie, that the news the girls would have to tell her would serve only to make her mood the blacker?""Oh, but, Billie, you won't mind when I tell you,"" cried Violet, regarding her friend with dancing eyes. ""The folks have decided to send me to Three Towers Hall!"" Three Towers was a boarding school some distance from North Bend. ""Laura is going too,"" Violet continued breathlessly. ""And of course you will--"" But something in Billie's face stopped her and she drew in her breath sharply."
"""I guess that's just what I am going to tell you,"" said Billie, her fists clasped so tightly that the knuckles showed white. ""I might have stood some chance if it hadn't been for that old statue. Now I can't get enough money to pay for that--much less go to Three Towers.""""Oh, that old statue!"" cried Violet desperately, adding, while her face grew longer and longer: ""What fun will there be, I'd like to know, in going to Three Towers if you can't go with us? And oh, Billie, I was making such wonderful plans!""Billie had to turn away to hide the tears that sprang to her eyes. For to go to Three Towers Hall had long been the ambition of the chums, and now it was doubly hard to see her chance snatched away by an accident that could have been so easily avoided. If only she had not been so foolish!""Laura told me that you thought your uncle might help you,"" said Violet, after an interval of unhappily trying to think of some way out of their trouble. ""Neither Laura nor I will stir a step without you, that's a sure thing.""""Why, of course you will,"" said Billie, stopping the swing short and looking at her chum in amazement. ""I'm sure your folks aren't going to let you stay at home from the school they've decided on just because I can't go with you. Although,"" and her voice broke a little, ""it's just wonderful of you, Vi, to feel that way. You will go, of course, and you can write me beautiful letters about the wonderful times you are having.""""I won't do it!"" cried Violet, springing to her feet. ""I'm not going to Three Towers without you, and that settles it. I don't care if I had a thousand parents. Who's that turning the corner?"" she interrupted herself to ask. ""There's something familiar about that walk.""""Plenty. But that's nothing to what we're going to do,"" crowed Ferd exultantly. ""He and I have at last persuaded our reluctant parents to send us to the military school. You know--the one that is only a little over a mile from Three Towers where you girls are going.""Again Billie felt as if she had been treated to a shower of ice water. Teddy and Ferd were going to Boxton Military Academy, and Chet--her darling, loyal Chet--would not be able to go with them. Her own disappointment seemed nothing at all beside this new tragedy.""I was just on my way over to your house,"" Billie was conscious that Ferd was addressing her. ""We haven't had a chance to get in touch with Chet yet. But the old boy will of course go with us, won't he? It wouldn't be any fun without Chet."""
"""Then I guess it's all right,"" said Ferd, leaning back with a sigh of relief. ""Gee, I was afraid you were going to say he couldn't go, and so spoil everything. Say, can't you see the good times we're going to have with you girls at Three Towers Hall and we fellows such a little way off that we can see each other every once in a while? I can't make up my mind that it's real yet--"" And so on and on, rapturously, while Billie's heart sank lower and lower and Violet's own warm one ached for her friend.""Well, of all--Say, old man, you've got to go,"" and he turned to Chet pleadingly. ""What sort of a party do you think this is going to be anyway, with Billie at Three Towers Hall and you back here in North Bend? It's not fair."" Billy Bradley really tried to be cheerful in the days that followed, but try as she would she could not altogether keep out the vision of Three Towers Hall, the boarding school to which she had wanted to go ever since--well, almost since she had wanted anything.And Chet was in just as bad a fix, for Boxton Military Academy had been his dream even as Three Towers Hall had been Billie's. Oh, if only they could all go what a wonderful time they could have! Oh, well--And Mr. and Mrs. Bradley, sensing something of all this, were very unhappy and cast about desperately for some way to give their boy and girl the advantages that the others would have. But money was very tight. Mr. Bradley had all his cash tied up in several real estate transactions.""Aunt Beatrice Powerson is dead,"" Mrs. Bradley announced with a look more of shocked surprise than of grief. ""She died in Canada quite suddenly, and this is from her attorney asking us,"" she looked across at her husband, ""to be present at the reading of the will.""""I imagine nobody knew,"" his father answered. ""As you know, she was queer, and as tight as a clam when it came to talking about her personal affairs. The only thing we're sure of is that she had plenty of money to travel anywhere she wanted to, and that's saying something these days.""""I say, Billie,"" cried Chet, his eyes shining with the thought--dear, unselfish Chet, his first hope even then was more for Billie than himself, ""you are Aunt Beatrice's namesake, you know. Maybe she left you something in her will.""""Are you really going, Mother, you and Dad?"" asked Billie, for it seemed impossible to her that her father and mother should go off on such a long journey and leave her and Chet behind. ""Are you?"" she asked again anxiously.""Of course not,"" laughed Mrs. Bradley, and Chet sighed with relief. ""Debbie will be here as usual to do the cooking. And, of course,"" she added to Billie, putting an arm about her and drawing her close, ""Debbie will help you with anything you want to know. We probably won't be gone more than a week, anyway.""So it was arranged, and a couple of days later, with a wildly beating heart and a rueful smile upon her lips, Billie stood with Chet upon the station platform and waved good-bye to her father and mother."
"""I hate to bother you, miss,"" said the black cook, approaching her mistress the next morning--Billie, by the way, was busily dusting the living-room with a very becoming dust cap perched on top of her pretty hair, ""but this is mah day out.""""Your--day--out!"" gasped Billie, sitting down hard on the chair she had been dusting and regarding Debbie's black face with dismay. ""You never can mean that you are going to desert me, Debbie? Leave me to do all the cooking and--and--everything--"" The awful vision was too much for her and her voice died down to a whisper.""I'm tur'ble sorry, Miss Billie,"" said Debbie, gently but very, very firmly, ""but mah young man and me we has a mos' awful impo'tant in-gagement fo' dis aft'noon, an' I couldn't break it--no'm, much as I want to."" She added that last in the evident hope of appeasing her young mistress, who was still regarding her with horrified eyes.""Yas, indeed,"" Debbie assured her, going on to explain that the meal was virtually prepared anyway. ""I done made a salad for you and Chet, an' the butter beans am in de pan. Dere is some stew too, which all you has to do is to warm up, Miss Billie. An' I done make a big peach pie, an' dere's some whipped cream in de 'frig'rater. So I reckons you-all won't starve to death,"" she added, with a broad smile that showed all her strong white teeth back to the last molar.As for Billie, she could have hugged the mountainous black figure in the relief she felt. Why, with the dinner all prepared like this it would be just a lark to put it on the table--for just her and Chet alone.""I'd like to see Debbie's young man,"" she mused, a smile twisting the corners of her mouth. ""He ought to be a giant. Anyway, I feel sorry for him if he isn't. Dear funny old Debbie--won't Chet and I have a picnic to-night?""""Oh, look who wants to help,"" cried Billie, finding an apron nevertheless and tying it around his waist so that he looked like a butcher's assistant. ""You will probably only get under my feet and bother me to death, but I suppose I'll have to humor you. There, if you must do something, set the table.""Now Chet did not want to set the table--it took him too far from the appetizing aromas in the kitchen. However, he obeyed grumblingly and was finally rewarded by being given a steaming dish of stew to carry in.""Chet,"" screamed Billie, following him in and checking him just as he was in the act of putting the hot dish on the tablecloth, ""put a protector under it. Don't you know,"" as Chet started and looked reproachfully at her, ""that you are apt to ruin the table? And it's almost a brand new one at that.""""My! but doesn't everything look good?"" cried Billie, sniffing hungrily. ""Hurry up, Chet, take off your apron and dish up the stew while I pour the coffee. What do you know about that? _I_ made the coffee. And doesn't it smell good?"""
"For the first part of the night Billie slept soundly, but just as the clock downstairs was striking two, she awakened suddenly and lay still in bed listening. She was frightened, though she could not have told why.Nearer, nearer came the stealthy padding, till Billie realized it had reached the landing. Her scalp crept and her hair began to stand on end. Her door was the nearest to the stairs, and she was all alone in the house with Chet!""Nervy beggar,"" muttered Chet. ""If I had a gun I'd know what to do. But say,"" he added, as a happy thought struck him, ""there's Dad's!"" He was out of bed and across the room before Billie could do more than gasp. Fearfully she followed after.Luckily Chet had elected to sleep in his parents' room during their absence so as to be nearer Billie, and he had happened to remember the secret hiding place that his father had shown him not long before where he kept his revolver always loaded and ready for action.Very carefully Chet turned the key in the lock, and then, while Billie pressed both hands over her heart to quiet its pounding, Chet flung open the door and stepped into the hall. Billie was right at his heels.For a minute Chet and Billie just stared speechlessly. Then slowly the revolver in Chet's hand dropped to his side and he began to laugh. It was a weak laugh at first, but it gradually swelled into a roar as he took in the full humor of the situation.Obediently Bruce went over to her and laid a cold muzzle in her hand, his soft eyes looking lovingly into her face. For Billie had made much of Bruce on her frequent visits to Nellie Bane, and the dog, with the instinct of his kind, had developed a great liking for her--though the first in his loyal dog's heart was Nellie Bane, his mistress.""Wait a minute,"" ordered Billie, and Chet turned back surprised. ""We haven't found out yet how Bruce got in,"" she explained, looking fearfully over her shoulder, for the effects of her fright had not quite left her yet. ""Don't you think we'd better take that along while we look through the house? We must have left a door or a window open somewhere. Bruce couldn't have come through the wall, you know.""""Something--I don't know what it can be--makes me agree with you,"" returned Chet sarcastically, but he turned to the stairs nevertheless, ""Come on,"" he said. ""If we have left a window open it is high time that that window was shut. Go ahead, Bruce, and show us where you got in--that's a good old boy.""They could laugh now at their surprise in meeting friendly Bruce instead of a very unfriendly house-breaker, but more than once both of them caught themselves listening for sounds in the silent house below.""Never knew you had one,"" remarked Chet cruelly, as he turned back to his bacon and eggs with a relieved sigh. ""If you need any help,"" he offered graciously, as Billie swept out of the room, ""just call on me.""Long before it was time to go to meet the train, they were ready and waiting. Billie was swinging back and forth in the porch swing, grasping a cushion in each hand to keep her from jumping out, while Chet walked restlessly up and down."
"""What's the use of raising hopes?"" she said dolefully, as a vision of the broken ""Girl Reading a Book"" rose reproachfully before her and she thought longingly of how happy she could be if it were only possible to replace it.Warm and panting they came out upon the station platform just as the train drew in. They watched the passengers eagerly, but not at first seeing those they sought, had almost decided that they were coming on a later train when away down at the end of the platform, Billie espied a familiar hat.""Were we!"" they cried, and Billie added with a laugh: ""We locked and double locked all the windows and doors, and if it hadn't been for Chet I would have piled furniture against the doors. But we want to know what you've been doing,"" she cried, turning to her mother eagerly. ""Tell us, please, quick. We've been waiting so long.""""Oh, please,"" begged Billie, almost beside herself with impatience by this time--and Chet, in his quiet way, was just as bad. There was something about their mother's and father's manner that told them something was in the wind.And still scolding herself she hurried them before her into the house and flew to find Debbie. She had not far to go, however, for Debbie was just lumbering, like a good-natured elephant, through the hall to greet her master and mistress. As soon as the greetings were over she lumbered back again to make the necessary tea.""Well,"" said Mrs. Bradley, and they leaned forward eagerly, ""we found that what we always supposed about the amount of money Aunt Beatrice had was right. She left only a few thousand, and that--queer soul that she was--she left to a missionary society.""""Oh!"" cried Billie, and it must be admitted that she both felt and looked horribly disappointed. She had not known just how much she had hoped, both for herself and for Chet, until this moment. And Chet, poor fellow, felt just as bad, although he showed it less.""She left a gold watch to Chet,"" Mrs. Bradley told them. ""It is really a very beautiful watch, Chet, and worth a good deal of money. And to Billie--"" She paused for emphasis and Billie wriggled impatiently. ""And to Billie she left her rambling old homestead at Cherry Corners.""""I haven't been there for a number of years,"" replied her mother, knitting her brows in an effort to recall the details of Billie's queer inheritance. ""As I remember it, it is an old-fashioned rambling affair. It must have been considered rather handsome in its palmy years, and it has been in the Powerson family for generations. In fact, I believe it dates back to revolutionary days. It has great large rooms, and rather spooky, dark hallways. I'm afraid I wasn't very much impressed with it the first time I saw it,"" she finished, with a smile."
"""Wh-what a funny thing to leave me,"" said Billie, her eyes big and round with wonder. Then she added, without thinking--as Billie always did: ""Oh, don't I wish she had left me a hundred dollars instead! It would have been much more useful!""""Well, I should say so!"" cried Chet, to whom the description of the queer old house, while dismaying his sister, had appealed immensely. ""Say, I'd like nothing better than to go out right now and look your property over, Billie. Big rooms and spooky halls and--say, Mother, it must have a cellar and an attic. What are they like?""""As I remember it, the cellar was the most peculiar part of the whole queer place. Aunt Beatrice took me through it, and seemed immensely proud of the funny old tunnels and store-rooms that were tucked away in all sort of odd corners. The only thing I liked about it,"" she finished, with a reminiscent smile, ""was the shelf-lined, icy room where she kept her fruit preserves.""""I should say it was!"" returned his mother, with an emphasis that set all his fears at rest. ""It was the creepiest place I have ever been in, and I was never gladder in my life than when we left it for the more cheerful lower floor--though goodness knows that was dreary enough.""""Goodness, that sounds as if it were away off in the wilderness!"" cried Billie, adding: ""But wouldn't it be awful to have to live in that spooky old house all alone? Are there any houses near it, Mother?""""Why, I've heard Aunt Beatrice say,"" answered Mrs. Bradley, beginning to share in her children's enthusiasm, ""that the Powersons who originally built the house built it especially for the purpose of resisting Indian attacks. Now that I come to think of it,"" she added, her eyes beginning to shine with excitement, ""that was the reason for the winding tunnels and secret rooms. As the last resort, the family could take refuge in them.""""Why, yes, that was all,"" said her mother, adding the next moment, surprised that she should have forgotten the most important part of all: ""Oh, I forgot to tell you--Aunt Beatrice left you the house with all its contents.""""I am sure I do not know,"" answered his mother, ""It may be completely furnished or it may be quite bare. I imagine, though, that Aunt Beatrice left it furnished. But everything is very old, and maybe the rats and moths have played sad havoc there.""They talked for a little while more about this strange thing that had happened. Then Mr. Bradley went off to pick up the loose ends of his business and Mrs. Bradley adjourned to the kitchen to discuss supper preparations with the mountainous Debbie.""But we didn't expect her to leave you an old stone mansion,"" crowed Chet. ""Say, Billie,"" he added, stopping before her in his excited pacing of the room to gaze at her eagerly, ""aren't you crazy to go out and see it?""""Oh, thieves and things. Tramps maybe,"" said Billie thoughtfully; then she added with spirit, as Chet smiled a superior sort of smile: ""I just guess you wouldn't be able to spend a night in that sort of a gloomy old house away off from everybody without feeling nervous. Goodness! I'd be expecting every minute to have the ghosts of dead and gone Indians rise up and scalp me."""
"""But oh,"" she added after a few minutes of thoughtful silence, ""I can't help it if it is ungrateful, but I do wish Aunt Beatrice had left me a few hundred dollars instead. We've still got that old statue to worry about, and Three Towers Hall and the military academy.""""But you know Uncle Bill always said that you never could get anything like the value for old gold. And anyway,"" she rose and put a loving arm about him, ""I couldn't let you do that for me, Chet, dear. I think you're the dearest brother in the world.""A few hours later Laura Jordon and Violet Farrington came over, trying their best not to look curious. They had waited as long as they could, but knowing about the death of Billie's queer old aunt and knowing also that Billie, as her namesake, might expect some share of the fortune--if there was one--they had been filled with excitement, and now as they ran up the steps to Billie's porch it was all they could do to keep from blurting out the question.""Just think,"" Violet had said in one of their excited conferences on the subject, ""what a wonderful thing it will be for Billie just now when she is so worried about that miserable old statue. And for Chet too!""""Yes, it would mean they could both go to school and we'd all have such a good time,"" Laura had chimed in. ""Goodness!"" she had added with a chuckle, ""I feel almost as much obliged to Aunt Beatrice as Billie will.""But now that the great moment had come, they sat decorously in Billie's porch swing and tried to appear not at all curious as to whether Billie had gathered in a fortune since they last had seen her or not.""Billie Bradley, if you don't tell us what we want to know this instant,"" cried Laura, jumping to her feet and making a threatening movement toward Billie's mischievous head, ""I'll--I'll--oh, I don't know what I'll do. Are you going to be good? Are you?""""Yes, yes,"" cried Billie, pretending immense fright, while her eyes danced with mischief. ""Tell me what it is you want to know and I'll do my best, Your Highness,"" this last in such a very humble tone that Laura chuckled.""Straight from the shoulder,"" Billie murmured. Then as Laura made another threatening gesture toward her, added hurriedly: ""All right. Don't shoot and I'll tell you everything. Only it will take time.""""It's either not enough or it is too much,"" replied Violet. ""If I had to have the ghosts, I should want some very substantial compensations to make up for such housemates as those airy and playful ladies and gentlemen are said to make.""""Well, I don't know that it is a regular honest-to-goodness one,"" admitted Billie reluctantly. ""You see, it is the house Aunt Beatrice used to live in when she was at home, and she left it to me, with everything in it.""""Oh, I suppose so,"" said Billie, adding as a shadow crossed her face: ""The folks think I'm awful, all 'cept Chet, and I suppose I am--but I'd give the whole place, tunnels, spooky hallways, ghostly attic, and everything for just a few little hundred dollar bills.""""All the better,"" cried Violet, growing more and more enthusiastic. ""You say that the old house dates back to revolutionary times, Billie. How do we know but what some of the old furniture would be very valuable as antiques?"""
"""Violet, you're a wonder!"" cried Billie, hugging her so hard that she gasped for breath. ""I'd never have thought of that in a thousand years. Now you speak of it,"" she added thoughtfully, ""I remember some antique furniture that Uncle Bill has in his library. He says it's worth all sorts of money, but I wouldn't give two cents for it.""""For goodness' sake!"" cried poor Billie wildly. ""You make me feel dizzy. What is the use of getting my hopes all raised? Probably Aunt Beatrice's furniture will be old, fallen-to-pieces stuff that nobody would give two cents for.""""Why, I don't know,"" answered Billie thoughtfully. ""As soon as we can arrange it, I suppose. Dad says it's a full day's trip to get there, so we would have to make some arrangement to stay over night.""""Gracious, isn't she stuck up?"" cried Laura flippantly. ""I'll have you know you're not the only property holder in the community, Billie Bradley. Dad gave me the deed to three lots in some outlandish place, I don't even know where it is.""""I think you are the one who needs a doctor,"" retorted Billie. ""Who ever thought of spending a vacation out in the wilderness a million miles or so from nowhere in an old tumbled-down house that makes your flesh creep and the hair rise on your head just to look at it?""""Oh, that would be fun,"" cried Billie, then flushed as she met Laura's laughing eyes. ""I meant,"" she added, angry because of the blush, ""that the place wouldn't be quite so lonesome and horrid with the boys around.""Why, thought Billie, as she ignored the remark, pretending not to hear it, would Laura always be such a goose as to make a joke of the very real friendship between her and Teddy Jordon? She liked Teddy immensely and she was not going to stop liking him even if Laura would persist in being foolish.""It will be lots of fun,"" she said, beginning to see the possibilities in a vacation spent at Cherry Corners. ""Mother says the rooms are large and there are plenty of them so we could have as big a party as we wanted. But I don't know how comfortable you would be,"" she warned them.""Who cares about being comfortable on a lark like that?"" cried Laura airily. ""The more uncomfortable we are the more fun we'll have. I say, Billie, don't you think we'd better take Gyp along?"" Gyp was a thoroughbred bull terrier of which Laura was the proud owner. ""He might come in handy if any ghosts showed up."""
"""But whom shall we get for a chaperone?"" asked Laura Jordon, after they had thoroughly discussed these new and startling plans for a vacation. ""We don't want to get any one who is too old and grouchy, and yet the folks probably wouldn't let us go unless we did.""""We do seem to be 'up against it,' as Ted says."" Laura was always using her brother for an excuse for her own slang. ""I can't think of a single person jolly enough to please us and dull enough to please the folks.""""Yes, she's the funniest thing you ever saw,"" Laura answered, her eyes beginning to twinkle at the memory of some of Mrs. Gilligan's escapades. ""Why, one April Fool's Day she set the clock back an hour and Mr. Gilligan got up grumbling that it was awfully dark for six o'clock. Then when he was all ready and was starting out to work she told him about it.""""There she was with her head in her hands,"" went on Laura, too much amused by her story to notice the interruption, ""sobbing as if her heart would break. And when he got down on his knees to comfort her, she just looked at him with a grin and said: 'April Fool.'""""Well, anyway,"" Laura concluded, ""I think she would be just the one to take on our trip with us. She's jolly and full of fun and yet she's old enough and fat enough to please our fathers and mothers. What do you say?""Gaily the girls set off to win Laura's parents over to their side, and they were lucky enough to find Mrs. Jordon at home. Also Teddy was there, sitting beside her on the veranda. At sight of Billie the boy jumped to his feet and came running down to her.""Your what?"" he cried, then suddenly he grasped her two hands and swung them joyfully back and forth. ""Do you mean to say,"" he cried, ""that your aunt really left you something? What is it, Billie? Go on, tell me.""""If you want to hear all about it just stay around for a little while,"" she laughed, leading him toward the group at the other end of the porch, two members of which were already in animated conversation.""Now perhaps you'll tell me,"" she said, ""what this crazy daughter of mine is talking about. So far I've got a sort of confused jumble of a haunted house and vacations and Mrs. Gilligan. I must confess I don't see how the three can possibly be connected.""And in this case Billie did indeed prove herself to be a wonder. Within half an hour she had not only won Mrs. Jordon over to their side, but had persuaded her to let the girls borrow Mrs. Gilligan for the time of their vacation.""Of course,"" Mrs. Jordon warned them, as the girls were hugging each other triumphantly, ""we aren't at all sure that Mrs. Gilligan will want to undertake such an expedition. I couldn't blame her very much if she didn't,"" she added, with a rueful little smile, ""knowing you girls as she does."""
"""Sure and I suppose the young girl is up to some of her tricks,"" said Mrs. Gilligan, beaming fondly upon her captor, ""but I came with her, thinking it possible you might really have something to say to me, Mrs. Jordon.""And then and there began another campaign. However, with Mrs. Jordon as a powerful ally the girls had little trouble in overcoming Mrs. Gilligan's objections, and in the end came off with colors flying. After permission for the outing was gained from all the parents concerned everything was bustle and excitement. For a week the girls spent the whole of every day at each other's houses, planning their vacation, talking about the clothes they would need to take with them, and generally enjoying themselves.""But there is the tennis match we promised to play with the fellows of the south end,"" Chet pointed out for perhaps the hundredth time. ""We couldn't back out of it at the last minute, you know; they'd think we were afraid.""""Well, so have I,"" spoke up Laura promptly. ""If there isn't a family ghost or two about the place, we just won't have any fun. What's the use of going off into the wilderness to a spooky house if we're not going to meet a ghost?""""Well, you know I didn't promise any ghosts,"" said Billie, looking up from a piece of fancy work she was embroidering. ""If you are disappointed, you needn't blame it on me, Laura, or you either, Chet.""""No, the ghosts probably wouldn't know the difference,"" said Teddy wickedly. ""By the way, boys,"" he went on, imitating Laura's tone to perfection, ""that's one important thing we haven't decided, yet. What are we going to wear?""""Oh, you big fibbers!"" Billie's eyes danced as she looked at them. ""I remember--oh, I have a very good memory,"" and she glanced sideways at Teddy, who was beginning to look uncomfortable. ""I remember a certain person telling me how beautifully you boys cooked while you were at camp.""""Well,"" said Billie with a little chuckle, ""I imagine we would rather eat our own cooking anyway, so you needn't worry. Only,"" she added warningly, as they sighed with relief, ""there is one thing you _will_ have to do.""It was a wonderful day, sunshiny and warm without being too hot, and all three of them were up with the birds. They were to catch the eight o'clock morning train, and so they had no time to waste in bed.Billie was in a joyful mood as she got herself into the pretty new dress she was to wear on the trip. She ran around the room, humming to herself and every once in a while doing a little dance step as she realized that they were at last to embark upon their adventure.And an adventure she somehow felt sure it was to be. For even though, contrary to Chet's hopes, and she smiled as she thought of him, they did not meet with ghosts at Cherry Corners, there would be the fun of seeing for the first time her inheritance.No wonder she sang as she gave a last fond pat to the pretty dress and tucked a wandering little strand of hair into place. Her eyes danced and her face was flushed, but Billie never noticed how pretty she was."
"She was the first in the dining-room that morning, but her mother soon came in, scattering advice as she came and all through the meal Billie tried hard to listen dutifully to all the ""must nots"" and ""don't dos."" But all the time her eyes were on the clock and her mind was saying over and over again:Then Chet came in and her father, and, finding that it was almost train time, postponed their breakfast to see her off. A few minutes later they started off to pick up the girls on the way to the station.They found them waiting impatiently, and wildly eager to be off. About a block from the station they heard the whistle of the train, and the girls would run for it, though they really had plenty of time.""Huh,"" retorted Mrs. Gilligan good-naturedly, ""it's him that I wouldn't be trusting. But what,"" she asked, looking curiously at Billie, ""did your brother mean by saying not to scare away the ghosts before he gets there?""""Oh,"" laughed Billie, ""he has a sort of idea that the house at Cherry Corners is inhabited by spirits--just because mother said that the halls and rooms were spooky. He will be terribly disappointed if he doesn't see half a dozen ghosts.""""I suppose we might as well take off our hats and stay awhile,"" agreed Laura, following suit. ""Say, girls,"" she added, as she stuck her hat up in the rack above her head, ""I just thought of something last night.""""All right,"" said Violet, suddenly goaded into an unusual firmness. ""You promise me this minute that you won't say another word about ghosts until we get there, or I'll get off at the very next station and walk back.""""I think I'll have to try Violet's trick,"" she said. ""If anybody mentions the high cost of living to me while we're away on this vacation, I'll get out and walk home. I don't care if it's a hundred miles.""""Goodness, I didn't think we were anywhere near there, yet!"" cried Violet, as she began to gather up her things. ""I never knew a day to go so quickly in my life. Billie, are these your candies? You'd better not leave them on the seat.""""Who said I was going to?"" cried Billie, rescuing her sweets just as Laura was in the act of sitting on them. ""Here, there's just room for them in the corner of my grip. Mrs. Gilligan, have you got the trunk checks?""""Here, put it on straight,"" cried Billie, performing that service for her friend. ""We don't want to have our reputations ruined the minute we step on the platform. Who ever heard of a perfect lady with her hat over one eye?""""Well, if you don't like my company--"" Laura began good-naturedly, as she squinted at her distorted reflection in the little two-by-four mirror set in the tiny space of wall between the windows. ""Gracious, Billie, you took it off of one eye to put it over the other. Do I look more like a perfect lady with my hat over my right eye?"""
"Billie chuckled and pushed the hat over Laura's nose, at which Laura would have protested vigorously and, if must be, forcefully, if there had not been other passengers in the train besides themselves. As it was, she had to be content with an indignant stare, which Billie, with twinkling eyes, calmly turned her back upon.""Roland! Roland!"" called the conductor in stentorian tones, and with little squeals of excitement the girls found their hand baggage, gave one last little pat to their hats, and started toward the door.""I wonder if Vi expects the ghosts to meet us at the station?"" chuckled Laura in Billie's ear. ""She reminds me of a relative of ours who always pushes her escort in front of her when she meets a strange dog.""""Well, we're not going to live here,"" said Mrs. Gilligan briskly. ""And you can't expect to find a thriving town away off a hundred miles from nowhere. Come on, let's see if we can find some sort of a wagon to take us and our belongings to Cherry Corners. I don't suppose,"" she added, as they crossed the street toward a building a little more dilapidated than the rest that had the words Livery Stable painted on a blurred sign over the door, ""that there is any sort of hotel or boarding house where we might put up for the night.""The place, in truth, was not attractive, nor did it promise much, outwardly at least, as a refuge for the night. Besides the street on which were the forlorn looking stores and the post-office and a few other nondescript looking buildings that might have been used for almost any possible purpose, there seemed to be but two streets on which were built the dwelling houses. These, for the most part, were simple and plain enough, each with its yard, well or ill kept, in front and a garden and chicken yard behind. Only one was a little more pretentious in appearance, but that, too, had attached to it its garden and chicken yard.However, they found that there was no necessity for their finding a place, if place there was to be found to stay for the night. They found the owner of the livery stable with two old but well-preserved vehicles which he was eager to place at their disposal.They spent some time in getting enough provisions to last for a time and to supplement what had been sent from North Bend; then, in half an hour more, with their luggage coming on behind, they were lumbering off over a very rocky road toward the house at Cherry Corners.""One of us would have had to sit on the trunks on the cart,"" chuckled Billie. ""Ouch!"" she cried, as they bounced over another ""thank you ma'am,"" ""I'm glad we haven't any more than five miles to go. There wouldn't be any of us left alive.""""Do you think it's haunted?"" asked Billie, with the hint of a laugh in her voice. Even here, in this forsaken place, with dusk coming on and the prospect of spending a night in a house people called haunted, Billie's sense of humor did not altogether leave her. ""Do you?"" she repeated, the laughter still more marked in her voice.""Nonsense, we're not going to turn back,"" spoke up Mrs. Gilligan, a trifle sharply, for she could see that the driver's evil prophecies were getting on the girls' nerves. ""If there are any ghosts in that house--which of course there ain't--they'd just better show their faces around me, that's all. I'll give 'em such a taste of my rolling pin that they'll get discouraged for good and all."""
"""Why no, Miss,"" said the driver reluctantly. ""I don't know as they actually seen things, but they has heard queer noises. There was some boys once,"" he went on, warming to his task of story teller, ""as thought they'd have some fun. You know the old lady what owned the place was nearly allus away and just left it to a caretaker that didn't take over much care of it--"" He stopped to chuckle, and the girls leaned forward eagerly.""Well, they heard such funny humming noises and jingling like the rattling of chains an' things,"" said the driver, ""that they got most scared to death and ran back home like the old Nick was after them. Ever since then folks has said the place was haunted.""""Stuff and rubbish!"" said Mrs. Gilligan, as the team came to a stop before the house. ""A nice lot o' talk I call that to fill the girls up with. Rattlin' of chains and hummin' noises! Huh!"" And with her nose in the air to show her contempt of all such notions she swept out of the carriage.The girls followed, and ran back to the wagon that contained their luggage and some provisions. The boy who had been driving this wagon was already unloading it, and the old fellow who had told them such gloomy tales came hobbling back to lend a hand.""You'd better be giving the key to me,"" said Mrs. Gilligan. ""We can't stand out here talkin' all night. Besides, the door probably has an old-fashioned lock on it, and they ain't a lock anywhere that can fool me.""She drew from the pocket of her coat a small electric torch and flashed it into the interior of the house. The bright light showed them glimpses of queer chairs standing about in odd corners and finally lighted up a broad stairway.""Well, if you're after acetylene gas I guess you'll be disappointed,"" said Mrs. Gilligan as her torch lighted up a wonderful old-fashioned richly carved candelabrum containing a dozen candles, half burned and looking rather wilted. ""It's candles we'll be burning while we're here.""""But they give such a ghostly, flickering light,"" protested Violet, as if it were in some way Mrs. Gilligan's fault. ""I know I'll never be able to stand it,"" and she glanced nervously over her shoulder.""Well, could you stand the dark any better?"" asked Mrs. Gilligan practically, as she began to light the candles one after another. ""There will probably be other candelabra in the house, and if you get enough of them burning there's nothing in this world that is prettier. For myself I just love candle light.""""That's the way to talk,"" said Mrs. Gilligan approvingly, as she crossed over to Billie's side of the large hall and began to light the other candles. ""If we just make the best of everything and make up our minds to have a good time, we'll have a good time. And if we don't we might just as well take the driver's advice and go home again."""
"""Well, if you want to go into that there haunted house, it's your concern,"" the old man was saying in a querulous voice. ""As for me, I wouldn't step a foot inside of it, no sir, not if you was to give me a farm!"" ""Maybe you wouldn't do it for a farm,"" said Mrs. Gilligan, striding resolutely toward the man and the boy, while the two drew apart and stared at her in surprise, ""but you're goin' to do it for me. If you think I'm going to lug those trunks and provisions and things into the house all by myself, you never was so much mistaken in your life. What do you suppose I'm paying you my good money for? Now, get a move on and hurry those things inside, or I'll have to take a hand in the matter myself. Trunks first!""The girls watched the two go upstairs with Mrs. Gilligan bringing up the rear to make sure they did not stop half way, and then turned to each other with a queer expression, half of amusement, half of uneasiness, on their faces.""A regular one,"" agreed Billie, adding decidedly: ""And I'm going to enjoy myself. Why, Laura,"" with a touch of excitement, ""did you notice those funny old chairs and things? They're really very pretty, and they are surely very old. I shouldn't wonder--""""Oh, Billie,"" cried Violet rapturously, ""do you suppose you could get real money for them? If you could,"" she added with the air of a martyr that made the girls laugh, ""it would be worth even braving the ghosts for.""""All right. And now you can bring in the provisions,"" they heard Mrs. Gilligan directing. ""I don't know where the kitchen is, but I suppose there is one somewhere. I'll find it while you start to bring the things in.""So, with Mrs. Gilligan at the head, they marched through what seemed to be a library, seen dimly by the light thrown by their four candles, into a room whose table and chairs showed it to be the dining-room.""Goodness! the Powerson that first built the house must have expected to entertain lots of company,"" exclaimed Violet, looking with wonder at the rows of curtained cupboards. ""I wonder if there are dishes in all of them?""""We haven't time to look now,"" said Mrs. Gilligan, stopping her as she was about to peep inside a closet. ""We can do all that to-morrow when we have daylight. Ah, here's the kitchen,"" she added, as she stepped into a huge room--the regular type of a very old kitchen that could be used as sitting-room as well.""I'm glad I don't have to keep it clean as a steady job,"" said Mrs. Gilligan grimly. ""Now, girls, let's go back and find our two friends with the provisions. I don't know how you feel about it, but as for me, a little something to eat wouldn't go at all bad.""""Humph!"" grunted Mrs. Gilligan, her mouth straightening to a grim line, ""I had more than a notion that that old fellow would clear out, and of course the young one wouldn't stay alone. I shouldn't have trusted them out of my sight!"""
"""Now for something to eat!"" cried Laura. ""What shall we have, Mrs. Gilligan? I suppose it will have to be a cold supper,"" she added, looking about for some means of cooking and discovering only an immense coal stove.""Here's plenty of coal,"" said Mrs. Gilligan, who had been finding things out in her own practical and efficient way, ""and here is plenty of wood and old newspapers to start it going. Indeed and we're not going to have any cold supper,"" she added, while in imagination the girls already were sniffing the aroma of broiling steak. ""Not after that long ride an' cheerful conversation!""""Besides, what we want we want in a hurry,"" said Laura, taking the dishes from Violet and setting them decidedly on the table. ""To-morrow will be time enough to put on airs. Just now all I want to do is to eat!""While they were waiting for the supper to cook and after they had done as much as they could toward its preparation, the girls looked about the kitchen and the gloomy dining room a bit. The latter room was dark and cheerless, and they wondered that any one should have selected it for a dining room. The woodwork was all of black walnut, and there was much of it, the window frames and door frames being heavy and ornate and the room being wainscoted with the same dark wood. The room was large, too, and there were windows at one end only, and that toward the north.""Almost ready now,"" she said, adding another piece of butter to the golden browned potatoes. ""Have you girls cut the cake? It's in one of the packages I brought in--on the end of the table. Don't cut it all now,"" she warned, as there was a joyful rush for the cake. ""We want some of it left for to-morrow.""Instead of the dinner making them more courageous, it seemed to be having the opposite effect, for when they had finished their cake and the steaming hot coffee, they found themselves talking in whispers as if they were afraid of the sound of their own voices.""What's the matter with us?"" Billie asked, her voice sounding strangely loud and unnatural even to herself in the hushed stillness all about. ""We never used to be so awfully quiet. And I'm sure we don't have to whisper about it.""""I--I suppose,"" shivered Violet, ""that it's because everything else is so quiet. It sort of has its effect on us. I wish,"" she added, with a sudden little outburst unusual in Violet, ""that that horrid old driver hadn't told us that horrid story. I catch myself listening for noises all the time.""""But that's foolish,"" said Mrs. Gilligan, in that every-day, matter-of-fact tone that never failed to give the girls courage. ""There isn't one of us who believes anything he said, so why let it worry us? Come on,"" she said, rising and beginning to gather together the dishes, ""we'll get these things put away in a hurry, and then go up to bed. I think a good night's rest is what you need."""
"""Oh, but I don't want to go up in the spooky upstairs part,"" whispered Violet to Billie, as she scraped some odds and ends off on a plate. ""Oh, why didn't we travel by night, so that we could have reached here in the morning?""""Well, we didn't, so there's no use worrying about it,"" said Billie sharply, for the situation was beginning to get on her own nerves. She had caught herself dreading the moment when they must leave the more or less cheerful kitchen for the upper floor of the house.The girls giggled and followed Mrs. Gilligan as she strode up the stairs. The flickering candles made grotesque shadows on the walls; the house, after that noise, was as still as a tomb, and despite the comforting presence of their valiant chaperone, the girls kept close together for protection.""Look out, now, go slow,"" Mrs. Gilligan was cautioning them. ""We don't want to stumble over this luggage and get a broken leg or two. Ouch!"" she exclaimed, as she stubbed her toe against something hard. ""I guess I'm the first casualty!""""Just as I thought,"" said Mrs. Gilligan, referring to the object she had stubbed her toe against. ""Your suitcase, Billie, and the creepy noise we heard was when it slid off the trunk. Come on now,"" she added, holding her candle high over her head again, ""let's see what we can find in the way of bedrooms.""""All right, but I have to sleep somewhere,"" Mrs. Gilligan reminded her with a wry little smile. ""Aren't you going to help me find some place? This may be the only bed that's in sleeping condition in the house.""Laughing, the girls pushed out into the hall and looked for the next doorway. They no longer glanced fearfully in the corners for something they were afraid to see. The thought of the nice clean bed pushed all their weird fancies into the background. Ghosts and clean beds did not seem to go together!""Only me opening a door,"" said Mrs. Gilligan from the farther end of the room. ""My, but you girls are jumpy! Better get to bed,"" she added, crossing over to them with a decided step. ""You're tired, and everything will seem better in the morning. Off with you now. No, not that way,"" as they started toward the hall, the way they had come in. ""I've found a door between our two rooms--it was opening that that made you jump. See?""""Goodness, you needn't look at me when you say that,"" said the latter, going energetically to work on the other shoe. ""I wouldn't go down into that gloomy place again for all the money there is in the world."""
"""Well, I'm not,"" said Billie stoutly, while her eyes searched the far corners of the room which were beginning to get very indistinct and creepy in the flickering uncertain light of the fast shortening candles. ""And, anyway,"" she added, the thought seeming to comfort her, ""I locked the door.""It was about three o'clock in the morning that it happened. Tortured by dreams in which she was being chased by a ghost in goggles and a green motor car, Violet finally awoke and lay staring out at the dark.Then suddenly she sat up. Her dream had followed her into the world of reality. There was the same strange, weird purring noise that sounded like, yet was strangely unlike, the chugging of a motor car.Out there in that wilderness, at three o'clock in the morning, a noise that sounded something like a motor car and yet was unlike anything they had ever heard before, might have frightened more experienced people than three fourteen-year-old girls.The purring sound was coming closer, seemed almost in the house, it was so near--Then came an awful thought to Billie. Could it really be in the house? Was it possible that those awful stories about ghosts were true?""It--it must have been a machine,"" said Laura, beginning to laugh hysterically. ""Vi, what did you go and wake me up in the middle of the night for just to hear an automobile? I was having such a lovely sleep.""""But it couldn't have been anything else,"" said Billie, trembling a little with the reaction. ""We heard it coming down the road, heard it pass the house, and go on. It simply must have been a machine.""""Well, I am,"" said Billie, leaning back and closing her eyes, yet knowing that she was as wide awake as she had ever been in her life. ""I don't see any use in lying here and listening for things. Good night once more, girls--I'm off.""As a matter of fact, even while they were saying they could sleep no more that night, the girls did go to sleep, and, what is more, slept soundly until they were awakened by Mrs. Gilligan's voice calling to them from the connecting doorway.""Do you expect to sleep all day?"" she was asking them, her face rosy and herself very nice and trim in a light blue house dress. ""This is the third time I've spoken to you, and I was beginning to get worried.""""Ghosts?"" she said, her eyes sparkling. ""I shouldn't think you'd be talking of ghosts any more. Here you've spent a whole night in the house and no spirits have bothered you yet. I should think you'd be satisfied.""""A noise that sounded like a motor car,"" she said, when they had finished and had paused for lack of breath. ""Well, I don't see what's so very queer about that. May have been some joy-riders or something."""
"""That particular sport does seem to belong to the idle rich,"" Mrs. Gilligan agreed, with a chuckle. ""Well,"" she added, getting up and starting for the door, ""whatever it is, or was, we needn't go without our breakfast because of it. How would you like some bacon and eggs and biscuits?""""But it's horribly gloomy, just as mother said."" Billie was regarding the dingy woodwork, now almost black with age, and the huge four-poster with its funereal canopied top, and the large pictures of dead and gone ancestors that adorned the walls. ""The only really good things in the whole room are the tables and chairs. They look,"" she added hopefully, ""as if they might bring in a little money. Perhaps I'll be able to pay for the statue after all.""""We're ready now,"" said Billie, putting an arm about Violet and hurrying her to the door. ""Oh, is that bacon I smell--and coffee?"" she asked as through the open door came a whiff of the good things below.""You said it!"" cried Laura, making a rush for lower floor with Billie and Violet not very far behind her. ""And it isn't going to be more than about two minutes before I taste that same bacon and eggs.""When they reached the lower hall they were surprised to see that it looked almost as gloomy and forbidding as it had the night before, in spite of the fact that the front door was open and sunlight was streaming through.""We have treated our hostess rather rudely, haven't we?"" laughed Violet, putting an arm about Billie and drawing her out into the sunshine. ""But really, Billie, we're quite sure that you don't like it any better than we do.""After breakfast the girls roamed around the big house, nosing into corners, calling each other's attention to this and that queer ornament or article of furniture--and there were plenty of them,--and otherwise thoroughly enjoying themselves. But as yet they did not venture into the gloomy cellar with its mysterious tunnels.After she had tried and failed on half a dozen different compositions, she gave up the attempt, and they roamed upstairs, looking through one room after another until Billie accidentally opened the door that led to the attic.It came again, a weird little noise like the brushing of wings against some hard object, and the girls scarcely dared to breathe. Then out into the hot open attic fluttered a tiny little object with webbed wings and the body of a mouse.During those days the girls roamed around the farm attached to Cherry Corners. They found it for the most part a rocky place, with here and there dense patches of woods. There was a brook and in this they saw some small fish darting about.The cherry trees also interested the chums--there were so many of them. The late cherries were ripe, and they spent a day in picking them, donning overalls for that purpose. Mrs. Gilligan took the fruit and made several delicious pies and also a number of tarts.The boy who daily brought them provisions from the village had been commissioned to send the antiquated carriage after the girls so that they could get down to the village in time to meet the early train. But the girls, with no confidence in the country lad's memory, had been sure he would forget all about it."
"""Well, that's just the reason it will probably be on time this morning,"" remarked Billie, scrambling in after the girls. ""When I'm late the trains are always early. Please hurry,"" she added, and the driver clucked half-heartedly to his team.All the way down they worried for fear they would be late, but when they reached Roland at last they found that their rural driver knew the habits of trains in that part of the country better than they did, for they had a full thirty-five minutes to wait.It had hardly drawn up to the station with a screeching of brakes and come to a standstill before a cyclonic trio of boys leaped from one of the rear cars and came dashing toward the girls, waving hats and bags and various other personal articles high in the air as they came.""There's an old carriage that looks as if it were on its last legs,"" laughed Violet, leading the way back to where the antiquated vehicle and its sleepy driver awaited them. ""We came up in it, but I don't know how we're all going to squeeze into it going back.""The ride to the house was one big lark. The boys sat on the trunks among the provisions, and the girls went off into gales of merriment at their comical efforts not to step on the eggs or fall among the fruit. They were having such an awfully good time that even the solemn old driver had to join in the fun.At last they reached Billie's house, and with much ceremony the boys jumped down from the wagon and ran to the carriage to help the girls out. And all they got for their pains was scorn and derision on the part of the girls.""Get out of the way before I step on you, little speck of dust,"" Laura cried haughtily to Ferd, who turned up his collar and slunk along toward the house as though his humiliation were more than he could bear, amid shouts of laughter from the merry crowd that followed him.""I say, let's go for a tramp in the woods this afternoon,"" Ferd suggested, after he and the other lads had taken a look around the house. ""This is the prettiest, wildest country I've ever seen, and I'd like to nose about a little.""The girls had spent much of their time in the old house since their arrival, for they had found an almost inexhaustible supply of strange corners and unexpected rooms and peculiar ornaments that had fascinated them.But to-day, as they felt the warm sunshine on their heads, as the wind caressed their faces and the scents of the woodland bathed them in perfume, they were glad they had let the boys have their way and had decided to spend the glorious afternoon in the open.He stopped short as they came upon the other young people. A couple of bearded men had come out of the woods and confronted the crowd. Each man carried a heavy club. They were the fellows who had once passed the girls without speaking.They had a flashlight, a lantern, and some candles, and all these combined gave them quite an illumination. But the girls kept close to the boys, for the cellar was certainly a creepy place, with its many nooks and corners and dark closets.""There,"" she said, when she had given it to the store boy to post, ""now I feel better. The confession part of it is off my mind, anyway. If I can only pay for the old statue--or buy another one like it--I'll be happy--or nearly happy.""She added the ""nearly happy"" as the thought came to her that even with the broken statue paid for and off her mind she had still another ordeal before her. In a couple of weeks their vacation would be up at Cherry Corners, and soon after that she would have to see Violet and Laura and the boys, except poor Chet, go off to boarding school, while she and her brother would be left behind.""I'm going to call the boys,"" said Billie, who, despite all her determination, could hardly stand up her knees trembled so. ""We'll all go and rout that old ghost. He's got to,"" she added with a hysterical giggle that matched Laura's, ""get off my piano!"""
"""Vi's right,"" said Mrs. Gilligan, just as the boys were about to protest. ""There isn't any use going into this thing any further to-night and getting the girls all upset. I'll stay down here awhile and see what I can see.""""Well, I've had enough of spooks to last _me_ forever,"" said Laura, with a shivery glance over her shoulder as the boys left the girls at their door and started off down the hall. ""If that piano begins to play itself again to-night, I'll just die, that's all there is to it."" The piano did not swallow Mrs. Gilligan up, and, as a matter of fact, the good woman did not stand guard until morning. Half an hour of sitting alone in that gloomy room watching a piano that had played itself was enough to ruin even her seasoned nerves.In the morning the girls themselves felt somewhat inclined to laugh at the fright they had had, and yet they knew that what had happened had been no figment of their imaginations. The sound, though weird and eerie, had been real--even Mrs. Gilligan would testify to that.""Well, I tell you what we ought to do,"" said Ferd, as he sat down to a huge plateful of breakfast. ""We fellows ought to take turn and turn about keeping watch. There must be some reason for the noise the girls heard, and I won't be happy until we find out what it was.""""You'll do nothing of the kind, any of you,"" broke in Mrs. Gilligan, with that slight tightening of her upper lip that the girls and boys had come to know--and respect. ""That's a fine way to see all sorts of things that ain't and hear all sorts of things that never happened. Sit up in the dark, waiting for something to happen! I guess not!""""No, indeed I won't tell you,"" she said, adding with a little chuckle: ""I want to try it out myself first. For I know that if I told you young ones about it you'd only laugh. And I don't like being laughed at.""""Get out with your promises,"" said Mrs. Gilligan, relapsing into her brogue. ""I do be knowing you better. I'll try it to-night,"" she added graciously, ""and if it doesn't work I'll tell you about it in the morning.""""Well, you don't look as if you'd ever lost a wink in your life,"" said Chet, glancing at her admiringly, for it was an open secret with the boys and girls of North Bend that Chet rather especially liked tall, dark, peace-loving Violet Farrington--perhaps because she was so much like himself.But it was only a little while later that Mrs. Gilligan put another damper on their fun by announcing that some one would have to go to town for more provisions. The boy had failed to come that morning, and their supply of canned goods was running dangerously low.""Well, we could wait till toward evening,"" said Ferd. ""It wouldn't be so scorching then. I admit,"" he added, taking a slanting squint at the sun, ""that even I am not eager to take a long hike just now.""This time Violet proved to be right. Something did happen. It was after dark, the boys had not yet got back from the village, and the girls were setting the table in the kitchen--they had never found the courage to eat in the gloomy dining-room--when Violet set a dish down on the table with a bang that made the girls start and look at her in surprise."
"There was the same strange humming sound that had so startled them on their first night in the house, only this time, instead of coming from a distance and passing by, the noise seemed to get louder, then softer, louder and softer, as if whatever it was were approaching and retreating at regular intervals.They were about to enter into a heated argument when they saw the wagon that had by this time become familiar to them coming down the road with the boys seated in it or hanging to it in characteristic attitudes.When the girls had poured into their interested ears the story of the queer humming sound that had just repeated itself, they agreed to one man to Billie's suggestion that it was very probably an aeroplane.""I'll tell you what we'll do next time we hear it,"" said Teddy as the boys picked up the provisions they had brought and started toward the house. ""We'll go up on the roof. Then we'll pretty soon see whether it's a ghost or the real thing."" It was not long before there came a recurrence of the strange humming noise which had so disturbed the girls. It was only a few nights later that Chet sat up in bed with the joyful feeling that here at last was a chance to investigate at least one of the ghosts that haunted the homestead at Cherry Corners.""If you wouldn't talk so much, you could hear it,"" Chet answered, pushing up a trap door that led to a small square platform on the roof. ""It's the motor sound the girls heard and that scared them so.""""Say, what are you doing up there?"" a girl's voice hailed them from the bottom of the steps, and Chet thought he recognized it as Billie's. ""Are you walking in your sleep or have you gone crazy? Come down here quick, we need you.""""They're down looking for the ghost,"" answered Billie, as she ran down the stairs in front of them. ""They sent me to get you boys, and I found you gone. Mrs. Gilligan,"" she added, with a hysterical giggle, ""has the broom and Laura has the poker.""""Well, if it is, he's got a sense of humor,"" said Mrs. Gilligan, rising from her knees where she had been peering into the corner behind the piano. ""I've heard of all sorts of spirits, but I never heard of one who insisted upon playing the piano in the dead of night.""""Well, I don't see why he doesn't choose a regular piano to haunt,"" said Billie, feeling irritable because she was very sleepy and had been very much frightened. ""It's bad enough for a live person to play, let alone a ghost.""""And where could it have gone?"" wondered Laura, her eyes big and dark with excitement. ""The minute we heard the noise--I guess we're sort of listening for it even in our sleep--we jumped up and came down here while Billie went to call you boys. It was playing almost up to the minute we came into the room.""""There's no use wondering, that I can see,"" said Mrs. Gilligan, preparing to send them off to their respective bedrooms. ""I think the best thing we can do is not to notice them any more. Perhaps the ghosts will get tired, if they find they don't worry us,"" this last with a chuckle.""Say, this thing is making me mad!"" cried Ferd, glaring at the old piano as though it were the offender. ""I don't mind meeting an honest-to-goodness ghost, but I'll be hanged if I'll let him laugh at me!"""
"""I don't see how you're going to help it,"" said Teddy. ""Come on, fellows, it's pretty nearly morning, and we can decide then what we'll do to catch Mr. Ghost. I'm so sleepy I'm apt to fall asleep on my feet.""""Ugh,"" she cried, glancing about her distastefully, ""it's the gloomiest place I ever did see. I'll be glad when we leave it. That is, I would be,"" she added wistfully, ""if only Chet and I were going with the others to boarding school.""""I wonder--"" she said, then, remembering an old rat trap that she had come across several days ago, ran into the pantry to get it. She baited it with a fresh piece of cheese and set it carefully on the piano. It was ten o'clock before the girls finally came down, and it was still later before the boys appeared. Mrs. Gilligan and Billie had had breakfast together, and Billie had confided to the older woman her suspicions in regard to the ghostly player of the old piano.""It seems to me I've heard that remark somewhere before,"" said Billie, laughing at him. ""Hurry up and eat, you folks,"" she added, as she set a dish of fried hominy before them. ""We girls haven't really made a thorough examination of the attic yet, and I'm just dying to poke into all the corners.""""No, thanks,"" said Teddy decidedly. ""I can think of lots better things to do than go roaming about a hot old attic when the thermometer is ninety-six in the shade. I'm going for a walk in the woods. How about it, fellows?""""Yes, and see if we can come across those old fellows with the beards that told us the corn-fish story,"" chuckled Chet. ""You know,"" he added, ""I have wondered several times since then what the old fellows were up to. Somehow, I'm mighty sure they didn't tell the truth.""""Sure we're game,"" they answered, and Chet added, as he picked up a stick he had found in the woods several days before and had modeled into an excellent club: ""If they start any funny business they'll find me ready for them.""""I found a funny old closet yesterday,"" said Billie, as they came out into the musty attic. ""I was just going to open it and see what was inside when you girls called me for something. Here it is,"" indicating a small door, the top of which was only on a level with their shoulders.""We'll have to stoop down to get in here,"" said Billie, poking her head into the stuffy dark hole disclosed. ""And look, girls!"" she exclaimed excitedly, as her eyes became accustomed to the gloom. ""The closet runs away back an awfully long way, and there seems to be something bulky at the other end of it.""""Well, let's go in,"" said Laura, giving Billie an impatient little push. ""We can't find anything by standing here. Billie, what's the matter?"" for Billie had started back so suddenly that she had almost thrown Laura off her balance."
"However, after much hauling and pulling, Billie finally succeeded in backing out of the closet, pulling the trunk after her. Then standing up and brushing the hair out of her eyes, she regarded it gleefully.""Well, let's get it downstairs,"" suggested Laura, wildly impatient to see the treasure, if treasure it were. ""We certainly can't open it ourselves without a key. Oh, if the boys were only at home!"" she added with an impatient little stamp of her foot ""It seems to me they're never around when you want them.""""Maybe we can call them back. They haven't had time to go far,"" said Billie, stirred to instant action by the thought. ""Come on Laura, you take one end, Vi can steady it at the side, and we'll at least get the trunk downstairs. That's the way! Now then!""There the girls left it and started hastily down the stairs in pursuit of the boys. They had gone only half the way, however, when they were startled by a tremendous crash and explosion outside and stood still, their hearts in their mouths. The girls never remembered very clearly what happened after that. They had a vague and confused recollection of seeing the boys gathered around something in the bushes at the brook that groaned a little and made queer sputtering noises.The boys had succeeded in removing the man from the wreckage--one glance about them told the girls that the wreck had once been an aeroplane--and the man, who was elderly, lay quite still, looking up at them with sick eyes.""It's something in here,"" said the old fellow, while the girls and boys stood looking helplessly at him, not knowing what to do. He put a hand over his left side. ""Something's broken. I--I was trying to--invent a new kind of aeroplane,"" he went on jerkily, and in spite of the tragic circumstances the young folks felt a thrill of excitement as they realized that here perhaps was the secret of that strange humming noise that had so badly frightened and bewildered them.""That"" was the sound of running feet and a crackling of bushes, and the next minute two men burst out into the clearing. They were red of face and breathless, and when they saw the old man and the wrecked machine they stood stock still and stared in consternation.The older of the two men was working feverishly--he seemed to be a doctor, judging from the skill with which he tapped here and pressed there, evidently trying to find out what bones were broken, if any.""Why, this isn't so bad after all,"" announced the man at last, looking up from his patient with a light in his eyes that made him look very boyish in spite of the beard on his face. ""Your father's terribly bruised and battered up, Stanton,"" he said, addressing the old man's son, who had been looking on with strained attention, ""but as far as I can see the only bones broken are a rib or two. We'll soon fix you up as good as new,"" he went on, turning again to the old man.""No indeed,"" said the ""doctor-person""--as Billie had already dubbed him, rising briskly to his feet. ""You'll live to fly many another aeroplane, Mr. Parsons. Now will you let your son and me take you home?""""Goodness, you needn't bother,"" said Violet, going over to the wrecked machine and regarding it wonderingly. ""We've had enough of ghosts to last us a lifetime. My, that poor old inventor must have had a terrible fall."""
"""If that's meant to be a joke,"" said Laura bitingly, ""I must say it's as much of a failure as our old inventor himself. Well, girls,"" she added, turning back to them, ""I don't suppose there's any use staying around here any longer. Let's go back to the house.""""Why, it's my trunk,"" said Billie, when she could make herself heard above the babble. ""We found it in the attic. But I don't see what difference it makes where we got it,"" she added impatiently, getting down on her knees once more and shaking the trunk as if it were to blame. ""Won't you please get busy and open it, boys? Aren't you a bit curious to see what's inside?""""Goodness, I don't care whether you pick the lock or what you do as long as you get it open,"" cried Billie, half wild with impatience now that the fateful moment had arrived. ""You can use dynamite for all I care.""""Somebody give me something to throw at him,"" cried Laura indignantly. ""Anyway,"" she added triumphantly, ""we know there isn't dynamite in it or we'd have been blown to bits long ago. We dragged it down stairs.""""Now what have I done?"" she cried. ""If he once gets among those tools we won't see him for hours. Teddy,"" and she looked appealing enough even to melt Teddy's hard heart, ""won't you go after him? You will have to just tear him away--""However, the two boys were back sooner than the girls expected, for they were very curious about the contents of the small shabby trunk, which had so evidently been hidden away in the darkest corner of a dark closet in the attic.""Say, those are some tools, Billie,"" said Chet jubilantly, as he pried away at the lock. ""You could do just about anything with them--anything from making a house, to breaking into one. I say,"" he added, stopping work to look at her entreatingly, ""don't you remember mother saying that Aunt Beatrice left you the house and me--the tools?""""No, I don't remember anything of the sort,"" she said, imitating his tone to perfection. ""But if you're a good boy and open the trunk in a hurry, I'll deed them to you, Chet--every last tool in the tool-house.""""Of course, if you're all going to guess the same thing it's all ruined,"" she said, then added, as she bent forward and started to lift the cover: ""I don't know that I blame you, though, for I was going to guess the very same thing!""The trunk was full to the brim with old coins, many quite rare, while scattered here and there were postage stamps on sheets and loose, queer, foreign looking things that made Billie's eyes glisten as she looked at them.""You bet! It's a treasure,"" said Teddy soberly. Then with a little smile he turned to Billie--Billie who was vivid and breathless with the great discovery. ""Allow me to present to you, ladies and gentlemen, our old friend, Captain Kidd!"""
"""Well, you needn't take all the credit to yourself,"" said Billie, the lilt of happiness and excitement in her voice. ""Just remember, young lady, that it was little Billie Bradley who discovered the trunk.""""You stuck up thing,"" cried Violet, putting a fond arm again about her. ""Billie, dear,"" she went on in the serious voice that was Violet's very own, ""I'm just exactly as glad for myself that you found the money as I am for you. Because if Laura and I had had to go to Three Towers without you we wouldn't have enjoyed a single thing.""""There never was a girl had such wonderful friends,"" she said, and something in her throat tightened a little. ""And it makes the trunk three times as valuable,"" she added, in a lighter tone, ""because it makes three people happy instead of one. Which reminds me--"" she stopped short and put her hand over her mouth in consternation.""It doesn't look very mysterious,"" answered Billie, turning the envelope around and around in her hand and finally holding it up to the light to see if she could get any clew to its contents that way. ""But I surely never did see that handwriting before. I wonder--""""Girls,"" she said, ""it's from Miss Beggs!"" And she looked at them with wide eyes, forgetting for the moment that she had no more reason to fear a letter from the teacher. Then she remembered, and a joyful smile dawned on her face.""Girls, I've been sort of dreading this letter all summer,"" she said, her eyes sparkling, ""and now when it's come I don't mind a bit. Isn't it just wonderful? I have money enough of my own to replace that horrid 'Girl Reading a Book' and two or three more like it. Now,"" she said, settling down with a satisfied little sigh, ""if you'll allow me, I'll read my letter.""""Well, if that isn't the limit!"" she cried, laying down the letter and regarding the girls disgustedly. ""Here I've been worrying myself--and Chet--sick all summer about that horrid old statue and now when I've got the money to pay for it, I find out that I probably wouldn't have had to replace the old thing anyway.""""Why,"" Billie went on to explain, glancing at the letter again, ""Miss Beggs says that the statue had been broken before and she had attempted to mend it. She says that I'm not to worry over it, for it would have been only a matter of time before it had fallen to pieces itself anyway. Now what do you think of that?""""Well, I don't see any use of looking doleful about it,"" said Laura briskly. ""I should think you'd be glad, Billie, that you won't have to buy a statue. It will give you that much more money to have for yourself.""""Oh, but I'll buy a little statue, anyway,"" said Billie decidedly. ""It's awfully nice of Miss Beggs to tell me not to bother about it, but the fact is that I _re_broke the statue, whether it was broken before or not. And, anyway, I'll be glad to do it now,"" she added, with a little gleam in her eye, ""just to show Amanda Peabody that I can!"""
