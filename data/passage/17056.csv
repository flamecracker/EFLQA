Conclusion""Now, that I've had the good luck to sell the 'Pollard' to the Navy,"" responded Jacob Farnum, principal owner of the shipbuilding yard, ""I'm not disposed to grumble if the Government prefers to store its property here for a while.""Yet the young shipbuilder--he was a man in his early thirties, who had inherited this shipbuilding business from his father--allowed his eyes to twinkle in a way that suggested there was something else behind his words.Jack Benson saw that twinkle, but he did not ask questions. If the shipbuilder knew more than he was prepared to tell, it was not for his young captain to ask for information that was not volunteered."
"The second boy present, also in uniform, Hal Hastings by name, had not spoken in five minutes. That was like Hal. He was the engineer of the submarine torpedo boat, ""Pollard."" Jack was captain of the same craft, and could do all the talking.Jacob Farnum sat back, sideways, at his rolltop desk. On top of the desk lay stacked a voluminous though neat pile of papers, letters, telegrams and memoranda that some rival builders of submarine torpedo boats might have been willing to pay much for the privilege of examining. For, at the present moment, there was fierce competition in the air between rival American builders of submarine fighting craft designed for the United States Navy. Even foreign builders and inventors were clamoring for recognition. Yet just now the reorganized Pollard Submarine Boat Company stood at the top of the line. It had made the last sale to the United States Navy Department.At this moment, out in the little harbor that was a part of the shipyard, the ""Pollard"" rode gently at anchor. She was the first submarine torpedo boat built at this yard, after the designs of David Pollard, the inventor, a close personal friend of Jacob Farnum.""The United States will take its boat one of these days, Captain,"" Mr. Farnum continued, after lighting a cigar. ""By the way, did Dave tell you the name we are thinking of for the third boat, now on the stocks?""""Object? You know I don't, sir. But I am afraid the idea is going to my head,"" laughed Jack, his face still flushed. ""The very idea of there being in the United States Navy a fine and capable craft named after me--""""Oh, if the Navy folks object,"" laughed Farnum, ""then they'll change the name quickly enough. You understand, lad, the names we give to our boats last only until the craft are sold. The Navy people can change those names if they please.""""Deserved, well enough,"" retorted the shipbuilder. ""Dave Pollard and I are well enough satisfied that, if it hadn't been for you youngsters, and the superb way in which you handled our first boat, Dave and I would still be sitting on the anxious bench in the ante-rooms of the Navy Department at Washington.""""Give us time, won't you, Captain?"" pleaded Jacob Farnum, his face straight, but his eyes laughing. ""We expect to build at least five boats. If we didn't, this yard never would have been fitted for the present work, and you three boys, who've done so handsomely by us, wouldn't each own, as you now do, ten shares of stock in this company. Never fear; there'll be a 'Hastings' and a 'Somers' added to our fleet one of these days--even though some of our boats have to be sold to foreign governments.""""If a boat named the 'Hastings' were sold to some foreign government,"" laughed Jack Benson, ""Hal, here, wouldn't say much about it. But call a boat named the 'Somers,' after Eph, and then sell it, say, to the Germans or the Japanese, and all of Eph's American gorge would come to the surface. I'll wager he'd scheme to sink any submarine torpedo boat, named after him, that was sold to go under a foreign flag."""
"""That's just the trouble,"" grumbled Hal Hastings, breaking into the talk, at last. ""Confound it, why don't the people of this country run their government more than they do? Four-fifths of the inventors who get up great things that would put the United States on top, and keep us there, have to go abroad to find a market for their inventions! If I could invent a cannon to-day that would give all the power on earth to the nation owning it, would the American Government buy it from me? No, sir! I'd have to sell the cannon to England, Germany or Japan--or else starve while Congress was talking of doing something about it in the next session. Mr. Farnum, you have the finest, and the only real submarine torpedo boat. Yet, if you want to go on building and selling these craft, you'll have to dispose of most of them abroad.""It was well along in the afternoon, a little past the middle of October. For our three young friends, Jack, Hal and Eph, things were dull just at the present moment. They were drawing their salaries from the Pollard company, yet of late there had been little for them to do.Yet the three submarine boys knew that big things were in the air. David Pollard was away, presumably on important business. Jacob Farnum was not much given to speaking of plans until he had put them through to the finish. Some big deal was at present ""on"" with the Government. That much the submarine boys knew by intuition. They felt, therefore, that, at any moment, they were likely to be called into action--to be called upon for big things.Plainly the boy who had brought the telegram was disappointed over not getting some inkling of the secret. All Dunhaven, in fact, was wildly agog over any news that affected the Farnum yard. For, though the torpedo boat building industry was now known under the Pollard name, after the inventor of these boats, the yard itself still went under the Farnum name that young Farnum had inherited from his father.Readers of the first volume in this series, ""_The Submarine Boys on Duty_,"" remember how Jack Benson and Hal Hastings strayed into the little seaport town of Dunhaven one hot summer day, and how they learned that it was here that the then unknown but much-talked about Pollard submarine was being built. Both Jack and Hal had been well trained in machine shops; they had spent much time aboard salt water power craft, and so felt a wild desire to work at the Farnum yard, and to make a study of submarine craft in general.How they succeeded in getting their start in the Farnum yard, every reader of the preceding volumes knows; how, too, Eph Somers, a native of Dunhaven, managed to ""cheek"" his way aboard the craft after she had been launched, and how he had always since managed to remain there.Our same older readers will remember the thrilling experiences of this boyish trio during the early trials of the new submarine torpedo boat, both above and below the surface. These readers will remember, also, for instance, the great prank played by the boys on the watch officer of one of the stateliest battleships of the Navy.Readers of the second volume, ""_The Submarine Boys' Trial Trip_,"" will recall, among other things, the desperate efforts made by. George Melville, the capitalist, aided by the latter's disagreeable son, Don, to acquire stealthy control of the submarine building company, and their efforts to oust Jack, Hal and Eph from their much-prized employment. These readers will remember how Jack and his comrades spoiled the Melville plans, and how Captain Jack and his friends handled the ""Pollard"" so splendidly, in the presence of a board of Navy officers, that the United States Government was induced to buy that first submarine craft.After that sale, each of the three boys received, in addition to his regular pay, a bank account of a thousand dollars and ten shares of stock in the new company. Moreover, Messrs. Farnum and Pollard had felt wholly justified in promising these talented, daring, hustling submarine boys an assured and successful future."
"Jacob Farnum at last looked up from the final reading of the telegram in his hands. Captain Jack Benson's gaze was fixed on his employer's face. Hal Hastings was looking out of a window, with almost a bored look in his eyes.""Hardly that, I imagine,"" replied Farnum. ""It's the custom of the United States Navy, you know, to send a gunboat along with every two or three submarines. They call the larger craft the 'parent boat'. The parent boat looks out for any submarine craft that may become disabled.""""A naval crew will take possession of the 'Pollard,' and the craft will proceed, under the care of the Dad boat""--with a side glance of amusement at Hal--""to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.""""Why, that would have been well enough,"" assented Jack, ""before I had such a chance in your submarine service. No; I mean I'd like to see Annapolis. I'd like to watch the midshipmen at their training, and see the whole naval life there.""""Yes; that will give us a chance to have the 'Farnum' studied most closely by some of the most capable officers in the United States Navy. It ought to mean, presently, the sale of the 'Farnum' to the Government.""""Oh, you boys are safe from the ordinary perils of vanity, or your heads would have burst long ago. Well, then, when you arrive at Annapolis, you three are to act as civilian instructors to the middies. You three are to teach the midshipmen of the United States Navy the principles on which the Pollard type of boat is run. There; I've told you the whole news. What do you think of it!""""Yes; we'd better look both boats over at once,"" replied Mr Farnum, picking up his hat ""And we'll leave word for Grant Andrews and some of his machinists to inspect both craft with us. There may be a few things that will need to be done.""As they left the office, crossing the yard, Captain Jack Benson and Hal Hastings felt exactly as though they were walking on air. Even Hal, quiet as he was, had caught the joy-infection of these orders to proceed to Annapolis. To be sent to the United States Naval Academy on a tour of instruction is what officers of the Navy often call ""the prize detail.""Farnum and his two youthful companions went, first of all, to the long, shed-like building in which the third submarine craft to be turned out at this yard was now being built. From inside came the noisy clang of hammers against metal. The shipbuilder stepped inside alone, but soon came out, nodding. The three now continued on their way down to the little harbor. All of a sudden the three stopped short, almost with a jerk, in the same second, as though pulled by a string.Here, too, the cable was missing. Evidently the ""Farnum"" had made a clean get-away. If there had been any accident, it must have taken place after the new submarine boat had slipped away from her moorings."
"Mr. Farnum nodding, the boat was rowed in to the shore and Andrews and his men were put aboard the ""Pollard"" at the platform deck. Captain Jack Benson unlocking the door to the conning tower, was himself the first to disappear down below. When he came back he carried a line to which was attached a heavy sounding-lead.""It won't take us long to sound the deep spots in this little harbor,"" said the young skipper, as he dropped down once more into the bow of the shore boat. ""Row about, Hal, over the places where the submarine could go below out of sight.""""You also know that all three of us have been practicing at telegraphy a good deal during the past few weeks, because every man who follows the sea ought to know how to send and receive wireless messages at need.""""And the 'Farnum,' or whatever it is, is coming up,"" called Captain Jack, suddenly. ""I just felt my lead slide down over the top of her hull. Hard-a-starboard, Hal, and row hard,"" shouted young Benson, breathlessly.Though Hastings obeyed immediately he was barely an instant too soon. To his dismay, Mr. Farnum saw something dark, unwieldly, rising through the water. It appeared to be coming up fairly under the stern of the shore boat, threatening to overturn the little craft and plunge them all into the icy water.Hal shot just out of the danger zone, though. Then a round little tower bobbed up out of the water. Immediately afterward the upper third of a long, cigar-shaped craft came up into view, water rolling from her dripping sides, which glistened brightly as the sun came out briefly from behind a fall cloud.In the conning tower, through the thick plate glass, the three people in the shore boat made out the carroty-topped head and freckled, good-humored, honest, homely face of Eph Somers. The boat lay on the water, under no headway, drifting slightly with the wind-driven ripples. Then Eph raised the man-hole cover of the top of the conning tower, thrusting out his head to hail them.""I've been experimenting--flirting with science,"" responded Eph, loftily. ""Say, if you landsmen know a buoy from a banana, get down to the bow moorings of this steel mermaid, and I'll pass you the bow cable. It's a heap easier to lead this submarine horse out of the stall, single-handed, than it is to take him back and tie him.""Hal rowed easily to the buoy, while Eph, returning to the steering wheel and the tower controls, ran the ""Farnum,"" with just bare headway, up to where he could toss the bow cable to those waiting in the boat. A few moments later the stern cable, also, was made fast, in such a way as to allow a moderate swing to the bulky steel craft.""You never knew me to do it when I could ask permission, although, as captain, I have the right to handle the boat. But that leave doesn't extend to all the rest, Eph. What were you doing down there, anyway?""""Why, I came on board, and left the manhole open for ten minutes,"" answered Somers. ""Then I found the cabin thermometer standing at 49 degrees. I wondered how much warmth could be gained by going below the surface I had been down an hour and five minutes when you began to signal with that sledgehammer--""""I could have told you that, from my reading, without any experiment,"" retorted Skipper Jack. ""Close your conning tower and go down a little way, and the temperature would gradually rise a few degrees. That's because of the absence of wind and draft. But, if you could go down very, very deep without smashing the boat under the water pressure, you'd find the temperature falling quite a bit."""
"""Just my luck,"" muttered Eph, disconsolately. ""Here I've been dull as ditch-water for an hour, trying to find out something new, and it's all stated in a book printed--ten years ago,"" he finished, after rapidly consulting the title-page.Jacob Farnum had been no listener to this conversation. Taking the marine glasses from the conning tower, the shipbuilder was now well forward on the platform deck, scanning what was visible of the steam craft to the southward. At last the yard's owner turned around to say:""I don't believe you young men can have things ship-shape a second too soon. The craft heading this way has a military mast forward. She must be the 'Hudson.' If there's anything to be done, hustle!""Half an hour later Andrews and his men had put in the few needed touches aboard the newer submarine boat. The sun, meanwhile, had gone down, showing the hull of a naval vessel some four miles off the harbor.While Somers was busy putting the foreman and the machinists ashore, Mr. Farnum, Jack and Hal remained on the platform deck, watching the approach of the naval vessel, which was now plainly making for Dunhaven.Reaching the inside of the conning tower at a bound, the young skipper rapidly manipulated his own electric signaling control. There was a low mast on the ""Farnum's"" platform deck, a mast that could be unstepped almost in an instant when going below surface. So Captain Jack's counter-query beamed out in colors through the night:In another jiffy the two young chums had put off in the boat, Hal at the oars, Jack at the tiller ropes. The gunboat was now lying to, some seven hundred yards off the mouth of the little harbor. Hastings bent lustily to the oars, sending the boat over the rocking water until he was within a hundred yards of the steam craft's bridge.Answering only with a quiet grin, Hal rowed alongside the starboard side gangway. Jack, waiting, sprang quickly to the steps, ascending, waving his hand to Hal as he went. Young Hastings quickly shoved off, then bent to his oars.""For your best anchorage, sir,"" declared Captain Jack, after he had brought the gunboat slowly into the harbor, ""you will do well to anchor with that main arc-light dead ahead, that shed over there on your starboard beam, and the front end of the submarine shed about four points off your port bow."" There was so much of overwhelming censure in the naval tone that Jack's spirit was stung to the quick. ""It's your mistake, sir,"" he retorted. ""You didn't follow the course I advised. You swung the ship around to port, and--""As Jack, burning inwardly with indignation, though managing to keep outwardly calm, descended to the deck below, he caught sight of Hal Hastings, hovering near in the rowboat. Hal signaled to learn whether he should put in alongside to take off his chum, but Benson shook his head.Over on the ""Farnum"" the yard's owner and Eph Somers watched wonderingly. They understood, well enough, that the new, trim-looking gunboat was in trouble, but they did not how that Jack Benson was held at fault."
"Down between decks the engines of the ""Hudson"" were toiling hard to run the craft off out of the sand. Then the machinery stopped. An engineer officer came up from below. He and Mr. Mayhew walked to the stern, while a seaman, accompanying them, heaved the lead, reading the soundings.""We're stuck good and fast,"" remarked the engineer officer. ""We can't drive off out of that sand for the reason that the propellers are buried in the grit. They'll hardly turn at all, and, when they do, they only churn the sand without driving us off.""""Confound that ignoramus of a boy!"" muttered Mr. Mayhew, walking slowly forward. It was no pleasant situation for the lieutenant commander. Having run his vessel ashore, he knew himself likely to be facing a naval board of inquiry.Jacob Farnum glanced swiftly at his young captain. Jack shook his head briefly in dissent. Jacob Farnum, with full confidence in his young man, at once understood that there was more yet to be learned.Jack followed the others, including the engineer officer of the ""Hudson."" Yet Benson was clenching his hands, fighting a desperate battle to get full command over himself. It was hard--worse than hard--to be unjustly accused.Jacob Farnum wished to keep on the pleasantest terms with these officers of the Navy. At the same time he was man enough to feel determined that Jack, whether right or wrong, should have a full chance to defend himself.""Forget his youth altogether,"" urged Mr. Farnum. ""Let us treat him as a man. I've always found him one, in judgment, knowledge and loyalty. Do you mind telling me, sir, in what way he erred in bringing you in here?""""Pardon me, sir,"" Jack broke in, unable to keep still longer. ""What I said, or intended to say, was to bring your vessel so that the forward end of the submarine shed over there would be four points off the port bow.""""Gladly, sir,"" Benson replied, gripping the proffered hand. Jacob Farnum stood back, wagging his head in a satisfied way. It had been difficult for him to believe that his young captain had been at fault in so simple a matter, or in a harbor with which he was so intimately acquainted.""The only one in near waters, sir,"" replied the yard's owner, ""is a craft, not so very much larger than a launch, that ties up some three miles down the coast. She's the boat I use when I need any towing here. Of course, I have the two torpedo boats, though their engines were not constructed for towing work."""
"""Flood tide will be in in about two hours and a half, sir,"" Benson followed up. ""That ought to raise this vessel a good deal. Then, with the tow boat Mr. Farnum has mentioned, and with such help as the engines of the submarines may give, together with your own engines, Mr. Mayhew, I think there ought to be a good chance of getting the 'Hudson' afloat with plenty of water under her whole keel. We can even start some of the engines on shore, and rig winches to haul on extra cables. Altogether, we can give you a strong pull, sir.""So, presently, Jack and his employer found themselves seated at table in the gunboat's handsome wardroom. Besides the lieutenant commander there were Lieutenant Halpin, two ensigns, two engineer officers and a young medical officer. In the ""Hudson's"" complement of officers there were also four midshipmen, but these latter ate in their own mess.Before dinner was over the small towboat was in the harbor. At the coming of flood tide this towing craft had a hawser made fast to the gunboat. With the help of some of the naval machinists aboard the ""Hudson,"" both submarine craft were also manned and hawsers made fast. Two cables were passed ashore to winches to which power was supplied by the shipyard's engines. When all was ready a mighty pull was, given, the gunboat's own propellers taking part in the struggle. For two or three minutes the efforts continued. Then, at last, the ""Hudson,"" uninjured, ran off into deep water and shortly afterwards anchored in safety.""Mostly flat, as to the surface,"" Mr. Farnum replied. ""If your question goes further, there are some fine roads and several handsome estates within a few miles of here. Mr. Mayhew, won't you and a couple of your officers come on shore with me? I'll telephone for my car and put you over quite a few miles this evening.""One of the ""Hudson's"" cutters being now in the water alongside, the party went ashore in this. Jack, after bidding the naval officers good-night, found Hal and Eph, who had just come ashore from supper on board the ""Farnum.""""I don't know,"" replied Jack. ""We've few friends around here we need to take the trouble to say good-bye to. We could call on Mrs. Farnum, but I imagine we'd run into the naval party up at the Farnum house. We want to keep a bit in the background with these naval officers, except when they may ask for our company.""""My dear Farnum,"" ran the enclosure, ""since you're short a good machinist for the engine room of the 'Farnum,' the bearer, Samuel Truax, seems to me to be just the man you want. I've examined him, and he understands the sort of machinery we use. Better give him a chance."" The note was signed in David Pollard's well-known, scrawly handwriting.""Why, I'll tell you what I'll do,"" Benson went on, feeling in one of his pockets. ""Here's a dollar. That'll buy you a bed and a breakfast at the hotel up the street. If you want to get aboard with us in time, you'd better show up by eight in the morning."""
"""That's really all I can do,"" Jack Benson hastily assured the fellow. ""I'm not the owner of the boat, and I can't take any liberties. Oh, wait just a moment. I'll see if there's any chance of Mr. Farnum coming back to night.""Jack knew well enough that there wasn't any chance of Mr. Farnum returning, unless possibly at a very late hour with the naval officers, but the boy had seen the night watchman peering out through the gateway.""Just a pointer for you. You've seen that man on the street with us? He has a letter from Mr. Pollard to Mr. Farnum, but I wouldn't let him in the yard to-night, unless Mr. Farnum appears and gives the order.""""If it looked that way, then I'm sorry,"" Benson protested, in a tone of genuine regret. ""All I wanted to make plain was that I couldn't pass him on to our precious old boat without Mr. Farnum's order.""The three boys strolled easily about town, getting a hot soda or two, and, finally, drifting into a moving picture show that had opened recently in Dunhaven. This place they did not leave until the show was over. They were halfway home when Captain Jack remembered that he had left behind him a book that he had bought earlier in the evening.On the way toward the water front Benson had to pass a vacant lot surrounded by a high board fence on a deserted street. He had passed about half way along the length of the fence, when a head appeared over the top followed by a pair of arms holding a small bag of sand. Down dropped the bag, striking Jack Benson on the top of the head, sending him unconscious to the ground.With a chuckle Truax stepped through the hole in the fence. Swiftly he gathered up the young submarine captain, bearing him through the aperture and dropping him on the ground behind the fence. At the same time he took with him the small bag of sand.""Knocked you out, but I don't believe you'll be unconscious long,"" mused Truax, standing over his young victim, regarding him critically. ""There wasn't steam enough in the blow to hurt you for long. You're sturdy, following the sea all the time, as you do.""""Now, if someone finds you before you come to, you'll look like a fellow that has been drinking and fighting,"" muttered Truax under his breath. ""If you come to and get back to the yard without help, you'll walk unsteadily and have that smell about your clothes. Usually, it needs only a breath of suspicion to turn folks against a boy!""Pausing only long enough to learn that Jack's pulses were beating, and that the submarine boy was breathing, Truax stole off into the might, carrying the bag of sand under his over coat. At one point he paused long enough to empty the sand from the bag over a fence. The bag itself he afterwards burned in the open fireplace in the room assigned to him at Holt's Hotel.He got slowly to his feet, using the board fence as a means to help steady himself. Then, though he found himself weak and tormented by the pain in his head, Benson managed to feel his way along the fence until he came to the opening made by the loose board. Holding himself here, he thrust his head beyond."
"Now, Hal and Eph, having waited for some time at the shore boat, before going out on board the ""Farnum,"" had at last made up their minds to go back and look for their missing leader. They came along just at the moment that the young captain's head appeared through the opening in the fence.In truth, Jack didn't seem inclined to conversation. He was too sore and dazed to feel like talking. He couldn't collect his ideas clearly. The most that he actually knew was that the pain in his head was tormenting.""I'll pick him right up in my arms and carry him,"" proposed Andrews. ""I'll take him to Mr. Farnum's office. Then I'll get a doctor. We don't want much noise about this, or folks will be telling all sorts of yarns against Jack Benson and his drinking habits, when the truth is he's about the finest, steadiest young fellow alive!""Just as Andrews was about to carry his purpose into action, however, an automobile turned the nearest corner and came swiftly toward them. In another instant it stopped alongside. It contained Mr. Farnum and his chauffeur, besides three naval officers.""There is liquor on his clothing,"" continued the shipbuilder. ""It looks as though someone had assaulted the lad, laid him out, and then sprinkled him. It's a wasted trick, though. I know him too well to be fooled by any such clumsy bit of nonsense.""""A stupid trick, indeed,"" agreed Lieutenant Commander Mayhew, but the naval officer did not quite share the shipbuilder's confidence in the submarine boy's innocence. Mr. Mayhew had known of too many cases of naval apprentices ruined through weak indulgence in liquor. Indeed, he had even known of rare instances in which cadets had been dismissed from the Naval Academy for the same offense. The lieutenant commander's present doubt of Jack Benson was likely to work to that young man's disadvantage later on.Others of the party left the auto. Hal and Mr. Farnum got into the tonneau, supporting Jack there between them. Thus they carried him to Mr. Farnum's office at the yard, Grant Andrews then going in the car after a doctor, while the others stretched Jack on the office sofa. The naval officers returned to the ""Hudson,"" at anchor in the little harbor below.""The young man acts as though he had been struck on the head,"" was the physician's verdict. ""No bones of the skull are broken. The odor of liquor is on his coat, but I can't seem to detect any on the breath.""Under the effects of medicine Jack Benson was asleep when, at ten o'clock that morning, the two submarine torpedo boats slipped their moorings, following the ""parent boat,"" the ""Hudson,"" out of the harbor. ""Hullo!"" muttered the young submarine skipper, staring curiously about the little stateroom aft. He had it to himself, the nurse having been put on shore. ""Under way, eh? This is the queerest start I ever made on a voyage."""
"But it was all too great a puzzle. Benson finally decided to stop guessing until some future time. He went on with his dressing. Finally, with his blouse buttoned as exactly as ever, and his cap placed gingerly on his aching head, he opened the stateroom door, stepping out into the cabin.Accustomed as he was to sea motion, the slight roll of the ""Farnum"" did not bother the young skipper much. He soon reached the bottom of the short spiral stairway leading up into the conning tower. Up there, in the helmsman's seat, he espied Hal Hastings with his hands employed at t he steering apparatus. Hal was looking out over the water, straight ahead.""Right-o, if you insist,"" clicked Eph Somers, appearing from the engine room and darting to the young skipper's side. True, Jack's head swam a bit dizzily as he climbed the stairs, but Eph's strong support made the task much easier. There was space to spare on the seat beside Hal, and into this Jack Benson sank.""No; that new man, Truax, is on board, and at the last moment Mr. Farnum put Williamson, one of the machinists, aboard, also. You can send Williamson back from Annapolis whenever you're through with him.""""I think he's going to be a useful man,"" Hal responded. ""He seems familiar with our type of engines. Of course, he knows nothing about the apparatus for submerging the boat or making it dive. But he doesn't need to. Now, Jack, old fellow, we're going along all right. Why not let Eph help you back to your bunk, or one of the seats in the cabin, and have your sleep out?""""Nonsense,"" retorted Hal Hastings. ""I've been here a bare quarter of an hour, and I'm good for more work than that. Jack, you're nothing but a fifth wheel. You're not needed; won't be all day, and at night we anchor in some harbor down the coast. Go and rest, like a good fellow.""""Can't rest, when I know I'm doing nothing,"" Benson retorted, stubbornly. ""Besides, this is the first time I've ever found myself moving along in regular formation with the United States Navy. I feel almost as if I were a Navy officer myself, and I mean to make the most of the sensation. Say, Hal, wouldn't it be fine if we really did belong to the Navy?""""Well, it's no use thinking about it,"" sighed Hal, practically. ""Neither one of us is in any danger of getting appointed to Annapolis, so there's no chance that either one of us ever will become an officer in the Navy. Let's not talk about it, Jack I've been contented enough, so far, but now it makes me almost blue, to think that we can only go on testing and handling submarine craft like these, while others will be their real officers in the Navy, and command them in any war that may come."""
"Though his head throbbed, and though a dizzy spell came over him every few minutes, Jack Benson stuck it out, up there beside his chum, for an hour. Then, disdaining aid, he crept down the stairs, stretching himself out on one of the cabin seats. Eph brought him a pillow and a blanket. Jack soon slept, tossing uneasily whenever pain throbbed dully in his head.""Folks have an idea that, at most times, I'm one of the best-natured fellows on earth,"" declared Eph, solemnly. ""Yet they do say that, when I'm crossed in anything my mind's made up to, I can be tarnation ugly. I just told you I don't want the captain disturbed. Do you know, Sam Truax, I feel a queer notion coming over me? I've an idea that that feeling is just plain ugliness coming to life!""Jack slept, uneasily, until towards the middle of the afternoon. As soon as Eph found him awake, that young man brought the captain a plate of toast and a bowl of broth, both prepared at the little galley stove.""Humph!"" retorted Eph. ""Not so you could notice it much, I guess. It's a simpleton's job up in the conning tower to-day. All he has to do is to shift the wheel a little to port, or to starboard, just so as to keep the proper interval from the 'Dad' boat. Besides, I've been up there on relief, for an hour while you slept, and Hal came down and sat with the engines. Cheer up, Jack. No one misses you from the conning tower.""""Well, you needn't bother at all about the conning tower to-day,"" wound up Eph, glancing at his watch. ""It's after half-past three at this moment and I understand we're to drop anchor about five o'clock.""So skipper Jack settled back with a comfortable sigh. Truth to tell, it was pleasant not to have any immediate duty, for his head throbbed, every now and then, and he felt dizzy when he tried to walk.""Who could have hit me in that fashion, last night, and for what earthly purpose?"" wondered the boy. ""I've had some enemies, in the past, but I don't know a single person about Dunhaven, now who has any reason for wishing me harm.""Jack lay back on the upholstered seat. He sat with his eyes closed most of the time, though he did not doze. At last, however, he heard the engine room bell sound for reduced speed. Getting up, the young captain made his way to the foot of the conning tower stairs."
"""All I am sure of,"" retorted Eph, ""is that Jack Benson is captain on board this craft. That means that he's sole judge of everything here when this boat is cruising. If you were here by the orders of both owners, Jack Benson would fire you ashore for good, just the same, after you've balked at the first order.""There followed a series of signals, first of all for stopping speed, then for a brief reversing of engines. A moment later headway speed ahead was ordered. So on Eph went through the series of orders until the ""Farnum"" had been manoeuvred to her exact position. Then, from above, Captain Jack's voice was heard, roaring in almost his usual tones:Hal still sat at the wheel in the tower. As Eph and Truax crept forward over the arched upper hull of the ""Farnum,"" Hal sounded the engine room signals and steered until the boat had gotten close enough to make the bow cable fast. Then the stern cable was made fast, with more line, to another buoy.The parent vessel and her two submarine charges now lay at anchor in the harbor at Port Clovis, one of the towns down the coast from Dunhaven. This mooring overnight was to be repeated each day until Annapolis should be reached.Within fifteen minutes the craft were surrounded by small boats from shore. Some of these contained merchandise that it was hoped sailors would buy. Other boats ""ran"" for hotels, restaurants, drinking places, amusement halls, and all the varied places on shore that hope to fatten on Jack Tar's money.For four nights, in all, the submarine squadron tied up at moorings in harbors along the coast. On the fifth night, as darkness fell, the squadron continued under way, in Chesapeake Bay, for Annapolis was but three hours away.Immediately after supper Captain Jack took his place in the conning tower. He concerned himself principally with the compass, his only other task being to keep the course by the ""Hudson's"" lights, for the parent boat supplied in its own conduct all the navigation orders beyond the general course. The ""Farnum's"" searchlight was not used, the gunboat picking up all the coast-marks as they neared land.As she entered the mouth of the Severn River the ""Hudson"" signaled to the submarines to follow, in file, the ""Pollard"" leading. A little later the three craft entered the Basin at the Academy. While the gunboat anchored off the Amphitheatre, the two submarine boats were ordered to anchorage just off the Boat House. Then a cutter came alongside.""The lieutenant commander's compliments to Mr. Benson. Will Mr. Benson go aboard the 'Hudson'?"" asked the young officer in command of the cutter. Captain Jack lost no time in presenting himself before the lieutenant commander.""Mr. Benson,"" said Mr. Mayhew, after greeting the submarine boy, ""your craft will be under a marine guard to-night, and at all times while here at the Naval Academy. If you and your crew would like to spend the night ashore, in the quaint little old town of Annapolis, there's no reason why you shouldn't. But you will all need to report back aboard, ready for duty, by eight in the morning."""
"The shore boat waited to convey them to the landing. Before going, young Captain Benson closed and locked the manhole entrance to the conning tower. A sullen silence had fallen over Truax. The instructions to the corporal of the guard, and the prompt acceptance of those instructions, told Sam, beyond any doubt, that he was not coming back on board that night. Truax followed the others as they passed through the Academy grounds. Beyond the large, handsome buildings, there was not much to be seen at night. Lights shone behind all the windows in Cadet Barracks. Nearly all of the cadets of the United States Navy were in their quarters, hard at study. Here and there a marine sentry paced. A few naval officers, in uniform, passed along the walks. That was all, and the submarine party had crossed the grounds to the gate through which they were to pass into the town of Annapolis.For more than an hour the submarine boys wandered about. The principal streets contained some stores that had a bright, up-to-date look, and in these principal streets the evening crowds much resembled those to be found in any small town. There were other streets, however, on which there was little traffic. In some of these quieter streets were quaint, old-fashioned houses built in the Colonial days.Jack found the oyster house readily. As he entered the little, not over-clean place, he found himself the only customer. He gave his order, then picked up the local daily paper. As he ate, Jack found himself yawning. The drowsiness of Annapolis by night was coming upon him. Little did he dream how soon he was to discover that Annapolis, in some of its parts, can be lively enough.""Marse Truax, sah, he done hab er powah ob trouble, sah, las' wintah, wid rheumatiz, sah! He 'fraid he gwine cotch it again dis wintah, sah. Now, sah, dere am some good voodoo doctahs 'roun' Annapolis, so Marse Truax, he done gwine to see, sah, what er voodoo can promise him fo' his rheumatiz. I'se a runnah, sah, for de smahtest ole voodoo doctah, sah, in de whole state ob Maryland.""The mulatto launched into a prompt, energetic defense of the voodoo doctors. Young Benson had heard a good deal about these clever old colored frauds. In spite of his contempt, the submarine boy found himself interested. He had heard about the charms, spells, incantations and other humbugs practised on colored dupes and on some credulous whites by these greatest of all quacks. The voodoo methods of ""healing"" are brought out of the deepest jungles of darkest Africa, yet there are many ignorant people, even among the whites, who believe steadfastly in the ""cures"" wrought by the voodoo."
"""Yo' see, sah,"" the guide went on, ""Marse Truax wa'n't in no fit condition, sah, to try de strongest voodoo medicine dat he called fo'. So, w'ile de voodoo was sayin' his strongest chahms, Marse Truax done fall down, frothin' at de mouth. He am some bettah, now, sah, but he kain't be move' from de voodoo's house 'cept by a frien'.""""I'll get a chance to see one of these old voodoo frauds, anyway,"" Jack told himself. ""This new experience will be worth the time it keeps me out of my bed. What a pity Hal missed a queer old treat like this!""When the cab at last stopped, Benson looked out to find that the place was well down a lonely country road, well lined with trees on either side. The house, utterly dark from the outside, was a ramshackle, roomy old affair.""Mebbe yo' kin see some voodoo wo 'k, too, ef yo's int'rested,"" hinted the guide, in a whisper, as he fitted a key to a lock, and swung a door open. In a hallway stood a lighted lantern, which the guide picked up.""Now, go quiet-lak, on tip-toe. Sh!"" cautioned the guide, himself moving stealthily into the nearest room. Jack Benson began to feel secretly awestruck and ""creepy,"" though he was too full of grit to betray the fact.Jack Benson, under the impetus of that push, staggered ahead, seeking to recover his balance. Without a doubt he would have done so, but, just then, the floor under his feet ended. With a yell of dismay, the submarine boy tottered, then plunged down, alighting on a bed of soft dirt many feet below.Gr-r-r-r! Gr-r-r-r t That sound from overhead was not pleasant. Jack, in the few seconds that were left to him, could only guess as to the cause of the sounds. Then, some fifteen feet over his head, a tiny flame sputtered. This match-end was carried to the wick of the lantern that the yellowish guide had been carrying, and now the light illumined the place into which Jack Benson had fallen.That place was a square-shaped pit, with boarded sides. Up above, on a shelf of flooring, knelt the late guide, grinning down with a look of infernal glee. On either side of the mulatto stood a heavy-jowled bull-dog. Both brutes peered down, showing their teeth in a way to make a timid man's blood run cold.Jack fell back, his hands dropping to his sides. Had there been but one dog, the submarine boy, with all his grit forced to the surface, might have chosen to face the brute, hoping to despatch it with a well-aimed kick. But with two dogs, both intent on ""getting"" him, young Benson knew that he would stand the fabled chance of a snow-flake on a red-hot stove.""Yeah! Ah done foun' dat was de name ob a gemmun in yo' pahty dat wasn't wid yo'. Truax do as well as any odder name--yah! Now, Ah's gwine leab yo' heah t' git a sleep. Ah'll toss down some blankets. 'Pose yo'se'f and gwine ter sleep, honey. Don't try to clim' up outer dat, or dem dawgs'll sho'ly jump down at yo'. Keep quiet, an' go ter sleep, an' de dawgs done lay heah an' jest watch. But don' try nuffin' funny, or de dawgs'll sho'ly bring trubble to yo'. Dem is trained dawgs--train' fo' dis business ob mine. Ho, ho, ho!"""
"""No matter how much of a liar that rascal is, he didn't lie to me about the dogs,"" reflected Jack, his temper cooling, but his bitterness increasing. ""They're fighting dogs, and one wrong move would bring them bounding down here on me--the two together. Ugh-gh!""""Roll up one fo' a pillow, under yo' haid,"" grinned the mulatto. ""Dat's all right, sah. Wow, good night, Marse Benson. Ef yo' feel lonesome, Marse Benson, jes' whistle fo' de dawgs. _Dey'll come_!""The light vanished while the mulatto's sinister words were ringing in the boy's ears. Would the dogs jump down? Jack knew they would, at the first false move or sound on his part. He huddled softly, stealthily, on the blankets, there in the darkness.""Well, of all the slick man-traps!"" he gasped. ""I never heard of anything more clever. Nor was there ever a bigger idiot than I, to walk stupidly into this same trap! What's the game, I wonder? Robbery, it must be. And I have a watch, some other little valuables and nearly a hundred and fifty dollars in money on me. Oh, I'm the sleek, fat goose for plucking!""Lying there, in enforced stillness, Jack Benson, after an hour or so, actually fell asleep. A good, healthy sleeper at all times, he slumbered on through the night. Once he awoke, just a trifle chilled. He heard one of the dogs snoring overhead. Crawling under one of the blankets, Benson went to sleep again.It was the voice of the same mulatto, calling down into the pit. Again the rays of the lantern illumined the darkness. Both bull-dogs displayed their ferocious muzzles over the edge of the pit. Jack sat up cautiously, not caring to attract unfriendly interest from the dogs.""Ah want yo' to take off all yo' clothes 'cept yo' undahclothes, an' den Ah'll let down a string fo' yo' to tie 'em to,"" declared the mulatto, grinning. ""Yo' needn't try ter slip yo' wallet, nor nuffin' outer mah sight, cause Ah'll be watchin'. Now, git a hurry on, Marse Benson, or Ah'll done push dem dawgs ober de aidge oh dis flooring."""
"Jack hesitated only a moment. Then, with a grunt of rage, he began removing his outer garments. Down came a twine, to the lower end of which the boy made fast his garments, one after another. His money and valuables went up in the pockets, for the sharp eyes of the mulatto could not have been eluded by any amateur slight-of-hand.""I hope we do meet at another time!"" Jack Benson flared back, wrathily. The cool insolence of the fellow cut him to the marrow, yet where was the use of disobeying a rascal flanked by two such willing and capable dogs?""Now, yo' jes' put dese t'ings on, Marse Benson, ef yo' please, sah,"" mocked the mulatto, tossing down some woefully tattered, nondescript garments, and, after them, a battered, rimless Derby hat and a pair of brogans out at the toes.""Jes' as yo' please, ob co'se, Marse Benson,"" came the answer, from above. ""But, ef yo' don' put dem t'ings on, yo'll sho'ly hab ter gwine back ter 'Napolis in yo' undahelo's. An' yo's gwine back right away, too, so, ef yo' wants tr gwine back weahin' ernuff clo'es--""It looked like a highly risky bit of business, but Jack told himself that, now he had been deprived of his valuables, this yellow worthy must be genuinely anxious to be rid of the victim. So he took hold of the rope and began to climb. The mulatto and the dogs disappeared from the upper edge of the pit.""Come right in, Marse Benson. Dere am' nuffin' gwineter hu't yo',"" came the rascal's voice reassuringly. Jack obeyed by stepping into the next room, though he kept watch over the dogs out of the corners of his eyes.""Now, yo' lie right down on de flo', Marse Benson,"" commanded the master of the situation. ""Ah's gotter tie yo' up, befo' Ah can staht yo' back ter 'Napolis, but dere ain' no hahm gwine come ter yo'.""Making a virtue of necessity, Captain Jack lay down as directed, passing his hands behind his back. These were deftly secured, after which his ankles were treated in the same fashion. Immediately the mulatto, who was strong and wiry, lifted the boy and the lantern together. The dogs remaining behind, Jack was carried out into the yard, where he discovered that daylight was coming on in the East. He was dumped on the ground long enough to permit his captor to lock the door securely. Then the submarine boy was lifted once more, carried around the corner of the house and dumped in the bottom of a shabby old delivery wagon. A canvas was pulled over him, concealing him from any chance passer. Then the mulatto ran around to the seat, picking up the reins and starting the horse.It seemed like a long drive to the boy, though Benson was certainly in no position to judge time accurately. At last the team was halted, along a stretch of road in a deep woods. The mulatto lifted the submarine boy out to the ground."
"""Now, w'en yo's got yo' se'f free, yo' can take de road in dat direckshun,"" declared the fellow, pointing. ""Bimeby yo' come in sight ob de town. Now, Marse Benson, w'at happen to yo' las' night am all in de co'se ob a lifetime, an' Ah hope you ain't got no bad feelin's. Yo' suttinly done learn somet'ing new in de way ob tricks. Good-bye, sab, an' mah compliments to yo', Marse Benson.""""Oh, pshaw! There's no sense in trying to run after that rascal and his wagon,"" decided the young submarine skipper. ""I haven't the slightest idea what direction he took after he got out of sight, and--oh, gracious! I'm under orders to be aboard the 'Farnum' at eight this morning. And on Mr. Farnum's business, at that!""Clenching his hands vengefully, Jack started along in the direction pointed out by his late captor. Brisk walking wore some of the edge off his great wrath. Catching a comprehensive glimpse of himself, Jack could not keep back a grim laugh.""Well, I certainly am a dandy to spring myself on the trim and slick Naval Academy!"" he gritted. ""What a treat I'll be to the cadets! That is, if the sentry ever lets me through the gate into the Academy grounds.""As he hurried along, Jack Benson decided that he simply could not go to the Naval Academy presenting any such grotesque picture as he did now. Yet he had no money about him with which to purchase more presentable clothes in town. So he formed another plan.Within a few minutes he came in sight of Annapolis. Hurrying on faster, he at last entered the town. The further he went the more painfully conscious the boy became of the ludicrous appearance that he made. He saw men and women turn their heads to look after him, and his cheeks burned to a deep scarlet that glowed over the sea-bronze of his skin.""That means a fearful hustle,"" he muttered, and went ahead under such steam that he all but panted. At last he came to the Maryland House, opposite the State Capitol grounds. Into the office of the hotel he darted, going straight up to the desk.That was as far as the disgust of the clerk would permit him to go in words. A score of well-dressed gentlemen were staring in astonishment at the scene. The clerk nodded to two stout porters who had suspended their work nearby."
"It had been Jack Benson's purpose to go to his room and keep out of sight, while despatching one of the colored bell-boys of the hotel with a note to Hal Hastings, asking that chum to send him up a uniform and other articles of attire. However, before the young submarine captain fully realized what was happening, the two porters had seized him. Firmly, even though gently, they bustled him out through the entrance onto the street.""Oh, well,"" he sighed, paling as soon as the new flush of mortification had died out, ""there's nothing for it but to hurry to the Academy. I hope the sentries won't shoot when they see me,"" he added, bitterly.""I know I look pretty tough,"" Jack admitted, shamefacedly. ""But I belong aboard the 'Farnum,' one of the submarines that arrived last night. And I'm due there at this minute. Please don't delay me.""Jack frowned. The sentry's grin broadened a bit. As he did not offer to detain the boy longer, Benson hurried on along one of the walks. He took as short a course as he could making straight for the Basin, where he made out the ""Hudson"" and the two submarines.""Eh?"" muttered another person, lounging near the rail of the gunboat. Then Lieutenant Commander Mayhew, after a keen, wholly disapproving look at the hard-looking figure of a young man at the landing, started, as he muttered:""This isn't the first time the young man has come back the worse for wear,"" the lieutenant commander continued, under his breath. ""His friends were loyal enough to him, that time. I wonder if they can be, to-day?""One of the shore boats, waiting about in the Basin, put young Benson aboard the ""Farnum"" as soon as he explained who he was. Hal and Eph stood awaiting the coming of their young commander, their faces full of concern and anxiety. Both gripped Jack's hand as soon as he gained the platform deck of the submarine.This need Jack Benson proceeded to realize without an instant's delay. While he washed himself off, in one of the staterooms aft, he talked through the door, which had been left ajar. He continued his story while he dressed.""We were fearfully anxious this morning,"" Hal confessed. ""I went to sleep last night, and didn't know of your absence until this morning. Then Eph and I decided to come on down to the boat to see if you were here. We were just planning to send quiet word to the Annapolis police when Eph spotted you coming.""""I've got to think that over,"" muttered Jack, as he drew on a spick-and-span uniform blouse. ""I don't know whether there'll be any use in trying to find that mulatto. I haven't the least idea where his place is. Even if I found it, it's ten to one I wouldn't find the fellow there."""
"""I will,"" assented Jack, with a wry face, ""and here's where I have to do some tall but truthful explaining to a man who isn't in the least likely to believe a word I say. I can guess what Mr. Mayhew is thinking, and is going to keep on thinking!""Mr. Mayhew was seated before a desk in his cabin when the orderly piloted the submarine boy in. The naval officer did not rise, nor did he ask the boy to take a seat. Jack Benson was very well aware that he stood in Mr. Mayhew's presence in the light of a culprit.""Mr. Benson,"" began Mr. Mayhew, eyeing him closely, ""you are not in the naval service, and are not therefore amenable to its discipline. At the same time, however, your employers have furnished you to act, in some respects, as a civilian instructor in submarine boating before the cadets. While you are here on that duty it is to be expected, therefore, that you will conform generally to the rules of conduct as laid down at the Naval Academy.""""As I am at present in charge of the submarine purchased by the United States from your company, and at least in nominal charge of the 'Farnum,' as well, I am, in a measure, to be looked upon, for the present, as your commanding officer.""Thereupon, the submarine boy plunged into a concise description of what had happened to him the night before. The lieutenant commander did not once interrupt him, but, when Jack had finished, Mr. Mayhew observed:Jack looked straight into the officer's eyes as he put the question bluntly. An officer of the Army or of the Navy must not answer a question untruthfully. Neither, as a rule, may he make an evasive answer. So the lieutenant commander thought a moment, before he replied:""I don't feel that I know you well enough, Mr. Benson, to express an opinion that might be wholly fair to you. The most I can say, now, is that I very sincerely hope such a thing will not happen again during your stay at the Naval Academy.""""I hope not, Mr. Benson, for it would destroy your usefulness here. A civilian instructor here, as much as a naval instructor, must possess the whole confidence and respect of the cadet battalion. I hope none of the cadets who may have seen you this morning recognized you.""Then, taking on a different tone, Mr. Mayhew informed his young listener that a section of cadets would board the ""Farnum"" at eleven that morning, another section at three in the afternoon, and a third at four o'clock.""Hardly,"" retorted Jack. ""Mr. Mayhew is an officer and a gentleman. I admit that my yarn does sound fishy to a stranger. Besides, fellows, Mr. Mayhew represents the naval officers through whose good opinion our employers hope to sell a big fleet of submarine torpedo boats to the United States Government.""Because, for one business reason, the cadets are going to be the naval officers of to-morrow, and the Pollard Submarine Boat Company hopes to be building craft for the Navy for a good many years to come.""Sam Truax lounged back in the engine room, smoking a short pipe. With him stuck Williamson, for Eph had privately instructed the machinist from the Farnum yard not to leave the stranger alone in the engine room.""Sorry, but you'll have to stop all smoking in here now,"" announced Eph, thrusting his head in at the doorway. ""There'll be a lot of cadets aboard at eleven o'clock, and we want the air clear and sweet. You'd better go all over the machinery and see that everything is in apple pie order and appearance. Mr. Hastings will be in here soon to inspect it."""
"""Don't know, I'm sure,"" replied Williamson. ""All I know is that the three youngsters are aboard here to run the boat and show it off to the best advantage. My pay is running right along, and I've no kick at taking orders from any one of them.""""This is where I go on smoking, anyway,"" declared Truax, insolently, striking a match and lighting his pipe again. Williamson reached over, snatching the pipe from between the other man's teeth and dumping out the coals, after which the machinist coolly dropped the pipe into one of his own pockets.""He doesn't need any size or weight,"" retorted Williamson, crisply. ""If Captain Benson wants you off this boat, it's only the matter of a moment for him to get a squad of marines on board--and you'll march off to the 'Rogues' march'.""At the minute of eleven o'clock a squad of some twenty cadets came marching down to the landing in front of the boat house. There Lieutenant Commander Mayhew and one of his engineer officers met them. Two cutters manned by sailors brought the party out alongside, where Jack and Hal stood ready to receive them.After greeting the submarine boys, Mr. Mayhew turned to the cadets, calling their attention to the lines and outer construction of the ""Farnum."" Then he turned to the three submarine boys, signing to them to crowd forward.""These young gentlemen,"" announced the lieutenant commander, ""are Mr. Benson, Mr. Hastings and Mr. Somers. All three are thoroughly familiar with the Pollard type of boat. As the Navy has purchased one Pollard boat, and may acquire others, it is well that you cadets should understand all the working details of the Pollard Submarine Company's crafts. A few of you at a time will now step into the conning tower, and Mr. Benson will explain to you the steering and control gear used there.""Half a dozen of the cadets managed to squeeze into the conning tower. Jack experienced an odd feeling, half of embarrassment, as he explained before so many attentive pairs of eyes. Then another squad of cadets took the place of the first on-lookers. After a while all had been instructed in the use of the conning tower appliances.""Mr. Benson,"" continued the lieutenant commander, ""will now lead the way for all hands to the cabin. There he will explain the uses of the diving controls, the compressed air apparatus, and other details usually worked from the cabin.""""Mr. Benson's present status,"" rapped Mr. Mayhew, quickly, ""is that of a civilian instructor. Any cadet who addresses Mr. Benson will therefore say 'sir,' in all cases, just as in addressing an officer of the Navy.""The cadet so corrected, who was at least twenty-one years old, flushed as he glanced swiftly at sixteen-year-old Jack. To say ""sir"" to such a youngster seemed almost like a humiliation. Yet the cadet repeated his question, adding the ""sir."" Jack quickly answered the question. Then two or three other questions were asked by other cadets. It was plain, however, that to all of the cadets the use of ""sir"" to so young a boy appealed, at least, to their sense of humor."
"""You can have a lot of fun with Benson,"" whispered Truax, ""if you fire a lot of questions at him, hard and fast. Benson is a conceited fellow, who knows a few things about the boat, but you can get him rattled and red-faced in no time.""""That will do, Mr. Merriam. Your questions appear to go beyond the limits of ordinary instruction, and to partake more of the nature of a cross-examination. Such questions take up the time of the instruction tour unnecessarily.""""You have done splendidly, gentlemen--far better than I expected you to do. If you manage the sea instruction as well, in the days to come, our cadets will have a first-class idea of the handling of the Pollard boats.""When the second squad of cadets arrived, in the afternoon, the three submarine boys found themselves ready for their task without misgivings. Eph took more part in the explanations than he had done in the forenoon. Then came a third squad of cadets, to be taken over the same ground. The young men of both these squads used the ""sir"" at once, having been previously warned by one of the naval officers.""It's all right for a while,"" agreed Jack. ""But it would grow tiresome after a few weeks, anyway. Lying here in the basin, and talking like a salesman once in a while, isn't like a life of adventure.""""Not in a rush,"" Jack answered. ""If I do, the police may start at once, and that mulatto and his friends, being on the watch, will take the alarm and get away. If I wait two or three days, then the mulatto's crowd will think I've dropped the whole thing. I reckon the waiting game will fool them more than any other.""Putting on their caps, the three went up on the platform deck. The engine room door was locked and Williamson and Truax had already turned in. There was a shore boat at the landing. Jack sent a low-voiced hail that brought the boat out alongside.At this hour the walks through the grounds were nearly deserted. A few officers, and some of their ladies living at the naval station, were out. The cadets were all in their quarters in barracks, hard at study, or supposed to be.For some time the submarine boys strolled about, enjoying the air and the views they obtained of buildings and grounds. Back at Dunhaven the air had been frosty. Here, at this more southern port, the October night was balmy, wholly pleasant.""Gentlemen, I must ask you to close your eyes, and keep them closed, on honor, until I ask you to open them again. You won't have to keep your eyes closed more than sixty seconds before the camelroorelephant will be ready for inspection. Now, eyes closed, please."""
"""At attention"" is the rigid attitude taken by a United States soldier or sailor when in the presence of his officers. Jack had already seen men in that attitude, and did his best to imitate it in smart military manner. Eph and Hal did likewise.The other cadet midshipmen now hemmed in closely about the three. Jack thought he caught the idea. He bent over, throwing his feet up in the air and resting on his hands. Unable to keep his balance, he walked two or three steps.Jack tried, but of course made a ludicrous failure of standing still on his hands. So did Hal and Eph. The latter, truth to tell, didn't try very hard, for his freckled temper was coming a bit to the surface.The smile had all but left Jack Benson's lips, though he tried to keep it there. Hal Hastings made the most successful attempt at looking wholly unconcerned. Eph's face was growing redder every minute. It is a regrettable fact that Eph was really beginning to want to fight.""You're General Washington, out to take a ride on your horse,"" announced Mr. Merriam, turning to Hal. ""It's a ride for your health. Do you understand? It will be wholly for your health to take that ride!""Jack pranced as best he could, on all fours, Hal making the load of his own weight as light as he could. Over the ground the pair moved in this nonsensical ride, the cadets following and grinning their appreciation of the nonsense.As the three submarine boys rose, each found himself gently held by a pair of cadet midshipmen. It was a more or less polite hint that the ordeal was not yet over. Mr. Merriam turned to whisper to one of the cadets, who darted inside the barracks building. He was back, promptly, carrying a folded blanket on his arm.A grin spread over the faces of the assembled cadet midshipmen. The bearer of the blanket at once unfolded it. As many of the cadets as could got hold of the edges, bending, holding the blanket spread out over the ground.Jack Benson's two captors suddenly hurled him across the length of the blanket with no gentle force. Instantly the cadets holding the blankets straightened up, jerking it taut. Up into the air a couple of feet bounded Jack. As his body came down the cadets holding the blanket gave it a still harder jerk. This time Jack shot up into the air at least four feet. It was the same old blanket-tossing, long popular both in the Army and Navy. Every time Jack landed the blanket was given a harder jerk by those holding it. Benson began to go higher and higher."
"As regular as drumbeats the cadets ripped out the syllables of the refrain. At each word Jack Benson's body shot higher and higher. These young men were experts in the gentle art of blanket-tossing. Ere long the submarine boy was going up into the air some eight or nine feet at every tautening of the blanket.As for escape, that was out of the question. No sooner did the submarine boy touch the blanket than he shot skyward again. Had he desired to he could not have called out. The motion and the sudden jolts shook all the breath out of him.Just as suddenly as it had begun the blanket tossing stopped. Yet, hardly had Jack been allowed to step out than Hal Hastings was unceremoniously dropped athwart the blanket. The tossing began again, to the chant of:Then how Eph _did_ go up and down! It was as though these cadet midshipmen knew that it would make Eph mad, madder, maddest! These budding young naval officers fairly bent to their work, tautening and loosening on the blanket until their muscles fairly ached.It was lofty aerial work that Eph Somers was doing. Up and up--higher and higher! Without the need of any effort on his own part young Somers was now traveling upward at the rate of ten or eleven feet at every punctuated bound.""Young gentlemen,"" said the officer, severely, ""I regret to find so many of you engaged in hazing. It is doubly bad when your victims are men outside the corps. And, if I mistake not, these young gentlemen are here as temporary civilian instructors in submarine work.""Mr. Merriam and his comrades made no reply in words. Nor did their faces express much. They stood at attention, looking stolidly ahead of them, though their faces were turned toward the officer. It was not the place of any of them to speak unless the officer asked questions.""Why, it was like this, sir,"" Jack continued. ""My two friends--Hastings and Somers--and myself were talking about the West Point and Annapolis hazings, of which we had heard and read. We were talking about the subject when a cadet came along. I suggested to Somers that we ask the cadet about hazing. Well, sir, to make a long story short, some of the cadets undertook to show us just how hazing is--or used to be--done at Annapolis.""""We entered most heartily into the spirit of the thing,"" Jack hastened on to say, ""and feel that we owe the deepest thanks to these young gentlemen of the Navy. Yet, if our desire to know more about the life--that is, the former life--of the Academy is to result in getting our entertainers into any trouble, we shall never cease regretting our unfortunate curiosity."""
"For some moments the naval officer regarded the three submarine boys, solemnly, in turn. From them he turned to look over the cadet midshipmen. The latter looked as stolid, and stood as rigidly at attention, as ever.""Under this presentation of the matter,"" said the officer, after a long pause, ""I am not prepared to say that there has been any violation of discipline. At least, no grave infraction. However, some of these young gentlemen are, I believe, absent from their quarters without leave. Mr. Merriam?""So on down through the list the officer ran. Nine of the young men proved to have leave to be away from their quarters. The other seven did not have such permission. The names of these seven, therefore, were written down to be reported. The seven, too, were ordered at once back to their quarters.""Gentlemen,"" he said, earnestly, as he reached them, ""it may not be best for me to be seen lingering here to talk with you. But my comrades wanted me to come after you and to say that we think you bricks. You carried that off finely, Mr. Benson. None of us will ever forget it.""""It was quick-witted of you, and generous too, sir,"" rejoined Mr. Merriam, finding it now very easy to employ the ""sir."" ""Probably you agree with us that no great crime was committed, anyway. But, just the same, hazing is under a heavy ban these days. If you hadn't saved the day as you did, sir, all of our cadet party might have been dismissed the Service. Those absent from quarters without leave will get only a few demerits apiece. We have that much to thank you for, sir, and we do. All our thanks, remember. Good night, sir.""""Eph, you're too quick to talk about others fibbing. From the evidence just put in, it's evident that you're the only one of the three who fibbed any. Won't you please walk on the ether side of the road? I never did like to travel with liars.""""He had to be; that's the answer. That officer, like every other officer of the Navy detailed here, is sworn to do his full duty. So he has to enforce the regulations. But don't you suppose, fellows, that officer was hazed, and did some hazing on his own account, when he was a cadet midshipman here years ago? Of course! And that's why the officer didn't question us any more closely than he did. He was afraid he might stumble on something that would oblige him to report the whole crowd for hazing. _He_ didn't want to do it. That officer, I'm certain, knew that, if he questioned us too closely, he'd find a lot more beneath the surface that he simply didn't want to dig up."""
"During the last few days short cruises were taken on the Severn River, in order that the middies might practise at running the motors and handling the craft. At such times one squad of midshipmen would be on duty in the engine room, another in the conning tower and on the platform deck.Of course, when the midshipmen handled the ""Farnum,"" under command of a Navy officer, the submarine boys had but little more to do than to be on board. Certainly they were not overworked. Yet all three were doing fine work for their employers in making the Navy officers of the future like the Pollard type of craft.After waiting a few days Jack Benson reported to the Annapolis police his experience with the mulatto ""guide."" The police thought they recognized the fellow, from the description, and did their best to find him. The mulatto, however, seemed to have disappeared from that part of the country.""This, Mr. Benson, completes the instruction desired in the Basin and in the river. To-morrow and Sunday you will have for rest. On Monday, at 10 A.M., a section will report aboard for the first trip out to sea. Then you will show our young men how the boat dives, and how she is run under water. As none of our cadet midshipmen have ever been below in a submarine before, you will be sure of having eager students.""""Then, sir, we'd like to spend a little time ashore, as we've been confined so long aboard. If I lock up everything tight on the boat until Sunday night, may we know that the 'Farnum' will be under the protection of the marine guard?""""He sent you along to us, true,"" admitted Jack, ""but I have instructions from Mr. Farnum to dismiss anyone whose work on board I don't like. Now, Truax, you're a competent enough man in the engine room, and there's no sense in having to let you go. You're well paid, and can afford the time on shore. I wouldn't make any more fuss about this, but do as the rest of us are going to do.""""I don't want to make it felt too much that I am boss here,"" Jack retorted, mildly. ""At the same time, though, I'm held responsible, and so I suppose I'll have to have things done the way that seems best to me.""""Blessed if I know,"" replied Eph. ""But that's the way I size the fellow up. Now, take that time you were knocked senseless, back in Dunhaven. Who could have done that? The more I think about Sam Truax, the more I suspect him as the fellow who stretched you out.""""Yes, and a fine fellow Dave Pollard is--true as steel,"" put in Hal Hastings, quietly. ""Yet you know what a dreamer he is. Always has his head in the air and his thoughts among the stars. He'd as like as not take a fellow like Truax on the fellow's own say-so, and never think of looking him up."""
"""Oh, we've no reason to think Truax isn't honest enough,"" contended Jack Benson. ""He's certainly a fine workman. As to his being sulky, you know well enough that's a common fault among men who spend their lives listening to the noise of great engines. A man who can't make himself heard over the noise of a big engine hasn't much encouragement to talk. Now, a man who can't find much chance to talk becomes sulky a good many times out of ten.""The naval machinists aboard the first submarine boat, the ""Pollard,"" now owned by the United States Government, found something slightly out of order with the ""Pollard's"" engine that they did not know exactly how to remedy.Sam Truax, hanging around the Basin that Sunday forenoon, was called upon. He gladly responded to the call for help. For four hours he toiled along in the ""Pollard's"" engine room. Much of that time he spent there alone.""Now, if I can only get the same chance at the 'Farnum's' engines!"" he muttered, to himself. ""If I can, I think Mr. Jack Benson will find himself out of favor with his company, for his company will be out of favor with the Navy Department at Washington!"" ""The submarine boats when out in the Bay will keep abreast of the 'Hudson,' two hundred yards off on either beam. The speed will be fourteen knots when the signal is given for full speed. The general course, after leaving the mouth of the Bay will be East.""On each of the submarine craft were sixteen cadet midshipmen, out for actual practice in handling a submarine in diving, and in running under water. On board the gunboat were eighty more cadets. Thus a large class of the young men were to receive instruction during the cruise, for the detachments aboard the submarines could be changed at the pleasure of Lieutenant Commander Mayhew, who was in charge of the cruise.Captain Jack, his own hands on the conning tower wheel, ran the ""Farnum"" out into the river, first of all. Then the ""Pollard,"" under command of a naval officer, followed. Both backed water, then waited for the ""Hudson"" to come out, for the gunboat was to lead the way until the Bay was reached. Then the formation ordered would be followed.Though it was nearing the first of November, the day, near land, was ideally soft and balmy. As many of the midshipmen as could sought the platform deck of the ""Farnum."" Those, however, who belonged to the engineer division were obliged to spend the greater part of their time below.By the time that the three craft were in the ordered formation, abreast, and well started down Chesapeake Bay, the parent vessel signaled that the designated cadets were to take charge of the handling of the submarine boats.Jack Benson cheerfully relinquished the wheel to Cadet Midshipman Merriam, and stepped out on to the platform deck. At need, as in case of accident or misunderstanding of signals or orders, Benson was still in command. While all ran smoothly, however, Mr. Merriam enjoyed command."
"This task of Eph's took time, though it was not a hard one. The food for the cadets had been sent aboard. Eph had to make coffee and heat soup. For the rest, cold food had to do. The young men, on this trip, were required to wait on themselves.""I'll do it, then,"" proposed Truax, roughly. He attempted to crowd his way past Hal, but the latter refused to be crowded, and stood his ground until the midshipman passed him a wrench. Then Hastings loosened up the part.The ""Farnum"" now lay to, as did the ""Hudson,"" for the officer in command of the ""Pollard"" signaled that his machinists were making a rapid but thorough investigation of the unfortunate submarine's engines.Taking off his uniform blouse and rolling up his sleeves, Hal sailed in vigorously to locate the fault. Machinists and cadets stood about, passing him the tools he needed, and helping him when required.""This, sir,"" complained Hal, turning around to face the naval officer in charge, ""looks like a direct attempt to tamper with and damage the engine. Someone has done this deliberately, sir. It only remains to find the culprit.""""Yesterday morning, sir,"" continued the senior machinist, ""we thought the engines needed some overhauling by someone more accustomed to them than we were. We saw one of the machinists of the 'Farnum,' sir, hanging about on shore. So we invited him aboard and asked him to look the engines over.""""I think Mr. Benson and myself understand, sir, how it happened that this damage was done. There are extra parts in the repair kit. In twenty minutes, sir, I think we can have the engines running smoothly once more.""Working like beavers, and with the assistance of others standing about, Jack and Hal had the piston replaced and all the other parts in place within fifteen minutes. Then, once more, Hal turned on the gasoline, set the ignition, and watched.""If you'll pardon our not answering directly, sir,"" Captain Jack replied, ""we want to have more than suspicions before we make a very energetic report on this strange accident. But we shall not be asleep, sir, in the matter of finding out. Then we shall make a full report to Mr. Mayhew.""Eph, therefore, came up with the last of the cadets from below. In the excitement of the pending race it had not been noticed by any of the submarine boys that Williamson was already on deck, aft. That left Sam Truax below in sole possession of the boat's engine quarters.A little cheer of excitement went up from the cadets aboard the ""Farnum"" as that craft shot ahead over the waters. The cadets were catching the thrill of what was virtually a race. At the same time, though, these midshipmen could not help feeling a good deal of interest in the success of the ""Pollard,"" which was manned wholly by representatives of the Navy."
"In the first three minutes the ""Farnum"" stole gradually, though slowly, ahead of the ""Pollard."" Then, to the disgust of all three of the submarine boys, the other craft was seen to be gaining. Before long the ""Pollard"" had the lead, and looked likely to increase it. Already gleeful cheers were rising from the all-navy crowd on the deck of the other submarine.From looking at the ""Pollard"" Captain Jack glanced down at the water. His own boat's bows seemed to be cutting the water at a fast gait. The young skipper, knowing what he knew about both boats, could not understand this losing to the other craft.""I don't know what it can be, then,"" murmured Hal, uneasily. ""There aren't so confusingly many parts to a six-cylinder gasoline motor. They aren't hard engines to run. More depends on the engine itself than on the engineer.""""Williamson might get it into his head that I went below because I thought he was making a muddle of the speed. As a matter of fact, he knows every blessed thing I do about our motors, and Williamson is loyal to the core.""""I know,"" nodded Captain Jack. ""I'd hate to hurt a fine fellow's feelings. Yet--confound it, I do want to win this burst of speed. It means, perhaps, the quick sale of this boat to the Navy. If we're beaten it means, to the Secretary of the Navy, that he already has our best boat, and he might not see the need of buying the 'Farnum' at all.""The naval cadets were too much absorbed in watching the race to have overheard anything. Williamson, too, standing at the rail, looking out over the water, had not yet discovered that Hal Hastings was up from the engine room.Both Jack and Hal could see that the gasoline flow had been turned on nearly to the full capacity. It was the poor ignition work that was making the motors respond so badly. A little less, and a little less, of the electric spark that burned the gasoline, and air mixture--that was the secret of the gradually decreasing speed, while all the time it looked as though the ""Farnum"" was doing her level best to win the race.""This fellow has been 'doping' our engines,"" announced Captain Jack. ""And now he's threatening to stand us off. We'll close in on him from both sides. If he tries to use that steel bar on any of us--""Then, with a yell, the midshipmen leaped in on one side, Jack leading the submarine forces on the other. Mr. Merriam's trip and Jack's smashing blow with the fist brought Truax down to the floor in a heap.""I thought it best to stop speed, sir. We'll have to look over our engines before it will be safe to attempt any more speed work,"" Captain Jack answered. ""I've caught a fellow tampering with our machinery. We hold him a prisoner, now. Can you take him off our hands, sir?"""
"The gunboat's engines slowed down. Ere long her port side gangway was lowered. Jack saw not only two marines and a corporal come down over the side, but Lieutenant Commander Mayhew appeared in person. That officer came over in the cutter.""I'll be glad to have a fellow like that in irons in the brig aboard the 'Hudson,' then,"" muttered Mr. Mayhew. ""I couldn't understand, Mr. Benson, how you were doing so badly in the full speed ahead dash.""""The prisoner below is the answer, sir,"" Captain Jack replied. He then led the corporal and two marines below. The corporal produced a pair of handcuffs, which he promptly snapped over Truax's wrists.Truax was foolish enough to try to hang back on his conductors. A slight jab through the clothing from one of the marines' bayonets caused the prisoner to stop that trick. He was taken on deck and over the side.""The ignition power was lowered, and that may have been the most that the fellow did,"" said Hal. ""Yet, at the same time, before putting these engines to any severe test, I believe they ought to be cooled and looked over.""""No; that won't do either, Mr. Hastings,"" replied the naval officer. ""This craft is private property, and I have no right to give orders that may damage private property. I'll hold the fleet until you've had time to inspect your engines properly. By that time, however, we'll have to put back to the coast for the night, for our practice time will be gone.""""I thought maybe you'd be willing to let me have a look over a craft of this sort,"" said the man in the bow. He appeared to be about forty years of age, dark-haired and with a full, black beard. The man was plainly though not roughly dressed; evidently he was a man of some education.""I didn't say that,"" Jack replied, evasively. ""But the construction of a submarine torpedo boat is a secret. It is a general rule with our owners that strangers shan't be allowed on board, unless they're very especially vouched for. Now, I hate to appear disobliging; yet, if you've ever been employed by anyone else, you will appreciate the need of obeying an owner's orders.""""All right, then. And, Eph since you're so sleepy, you can turn in as soon as you want. The boat will be under sufficient protection,"" Jack added, nodding toward the marine slowly pacing the platform deck.Williamson was called too, but declared that he felt like turning in early. So, when the shore boat came, it had but two passengers to take from the submarine. There were a few shore leave men, however, from, the gunboat."
"By way of public buildings there turned out to be a church, locked and dark, a general store and also a drug-store that contained the local post-office. But the drug-store carried no ice cream or soda, so the submarine boys turned away.There was one other ""public"" place that the boys failed to discover at once. That was a low groggery at the further end of the town. Here two of the sailors who had come on shore leave turned in for a drink or two. They found a suave, black-bearded man quite ready to buy liquor for Uncle Sam's tars.""These fishermen don't have such things,"" smiled the stranger. ""They are content with the bare necessities of life, with a little grog and tobacco added. Speaking of grog, would you care to try the best this town has, gentlemen?""""Tell you what I can do, gentlemen,"" proposed the stranger, suddenly. ""I might invite you down to my shack for a little while, and show you my books and some models of yachts and ships that I've been collecting. I'm quite proud of my collection in that line. Won't you come?""""If you don't mind,"" suggested Curtis, ""I will light a cigar. And say, by the way, gentlemen, what if we take a little walk down to my beach? Before showing you the models I spoke of, I'd like to have your opinion of the lines of my sloop.""""I won't keep you long, gentlemen, if I am boring you,"" agreed their host, amiably. ""Now, I'll go below first and light up. So! Now, come down and take a look. Do you find many yacht cabins more comfortable than this one?""It was, indeed, a cozy place. Up forward stood a miniature sideboard, complete in every respect with glass and silver. In the center of the cabin was a folding table. There were locker seats and inviting looking cushions. The trim was largely of mahogany. On either side was a broad, comfortable-looking berth.Curtis spoke in a low, droning, far-away voice that caused Jack Benson's upper eyelids to sink. Curtis stood watching him, in malicious glee, for some moments. Then, at last, he took hold of the young skipper."
"Curtis dodged the light blow, then gripped Jack Benson resolutely. ""Now, see here, young man,"" hissed the bearded one, ""I'm not going to have any more nonsense out of you. Up into the berth you go! Do you want me to hit you?""""You lemme up,"" insisted the submarine boy, in a low, chill voice, though he swung both his arms in an effort to assert himself. ""M not goin' t' stay here. Lemme up, I say! 'M goin' back to--own boat.""""Listen, if you've got enough of your senses left,"" growled the bearded men. ""You're not going back to the 'Farnum'--neither to-night, nor at any other time during the next few months. You're bound on a long cruise, but not on a submarine boat. I am the captain here, and I'll name the cruise!""Eph, after having made up his mind to turn in early, had found his sleepy fit passing. He read for a while in the cabin, then pulled on a reefer and went up on deck. Williamson was already in a berth, sound asleep.""That's the kind of a craft Jack would give a heap to be on,"" thought Eph. ""Queer that he should spend all his time on gasoline peanut roasters when he's so fond of whistling for a breeze behind canvas.""""Hullo,"" muttered the submarine boy, two or three minutes later. ""Here's the shore boat coming on its regular trip. I wonder if Jack and Hal are in it? It's about time for them to be coming on board.""""That's queer,"" reflected Eph. ""It wouldn't be like them to go sailing at this time of the night, and without notifying me, either. But, then, I didn't see anything of 'em aboard that sloop, either.""""Mighty strange things have been happening all through this cruise,"" Eph muttered, half aloud. ""Especially happening to Jack! Now, the two of them go aboard that sloop, and immediately after the boat puts out to sea in the dead of night. What if Jack and Hal have been shanghaied on that infernal sloop?""""I half believe, sir,"" Eph rattled on, ""that my two comrades, Mr. Benson and Mr. Hastings have been tricked, in some way, and carried out to sea on that knockabout. They'd have been back from shore by this time, if nothing had happened."""
"""Want to do, sir?"" retorted Eph. ""I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to slip moorings and chase after that knockabout. What I wish to know from you, sir, is whether you'll send another marine or two on board, so that I can back up my demand to find my friends?Eph, hanging at the rail in the silence that followed, had no notion of whether his request had been a correct one. All he knew was that his suspicions had surged to the surface, and were threatening to boil over. It was a huge relief to the boy when Mr Mayhew's voice sounded from the rail of the gunboat. Somers swiftly answered all questions.""Your craft and crew are in a measure under our protection and orders,"" decided Mr. Mayhew. ""I think we may properly extend you some help. I will send some men to you, and a cadet midshipman who will have my instructions.""""Engines?"" That word came as a fortunate reminder to the Submarine boy. He darted below, almost yanking Williamson from his berth, nearly pulling the machinist into his clothes. By the time that Williamson was really wide awake he found himself standing by the motors forward.Then young Somers darted onto deck again, just in time to see the boat coming alongside. It brought two more marines, one of them a corporal. There were also two sailors. A cadet midshipman commanded them.""Mr. Somers,"" reported the cadet midshipman, ""I am not intended to displace you from the command of this boat. I am here only with definite instructions in case you succeed in overhauling that white sloop.""No sooner had the moorings been cast loose from than Eph sounded the slow speed ahead bell. Within sixty seconds the propellers of the ""Farnum"" were doing a ten-knot stunt, which was soon increased to fourteen.""They're mighty close to it, if they've shanghaied Mr. Benson and Mr. Hastings and put to sea with 'em,"" rejoined Eph. Then he rang for more speed. Down below, Williamson almost instantly responded. The ""Farnum"" now fairly leaped through the water.""Now, we want you men to stop,"" called Midshipman Terrell, between his hands. ""We are United States naval forces, from the gunboat, and you will regard this as an order that you must obey. No!"" thundered the midshipman, suddenly, as the bearded one started to step down into the cabin. ""You will both keep on deck. Otherwise we shall be obliged to fire into you. We mean business, remember!"""
"""Then your danger will be divided between being shot where you stand and having your craft cut in two by the bow of our craft,"" retorted Mr. Terrell. ""You will realize, I think, that there can be no parleying with our orders.""Eph allowed the ""Farnum"" to fall back a little way. Then he exerted himself to show his best in seamanship as he ran the submarine up to board the sloop by the starboard quarter. The two boats barely touched. Mr. Terrell, his three marines and two seamen leaped to the standing room of the yacht. Eph, all aquiver, let the nose of the ""Farnum"" fall back slightly. Then he trailed along, under bare headway.Eph quickly rang the signal, then did some careful manoeuvering. As he touched, one of the marines leaped back to the platform deck, then passed a line to Mr. Terrell. The two craft were held together until Jack and Hal had been passed, still unconscious, over the side. The naval party quickly followed, then cast loose from the sloop.The boat took them away. It was five minutes later when the boat returned, bringing the lieutenant commander, Doctor McCrea, the surgeon, and a sailor belonging to the hospital detachment aboard the ""Hudson."" Eph conducted them below.""Humph!"" uttered Mr. Mayhew. ""That sort of trick isn't played on folks in any decent resort on shore. I don't understand Mr. Benson's conduct. I remember his mishap at Dunhaven. I remember the plight he got into at Annapolis; and now he and Mr. Hastings are found in this questionable shape. I am very much afraid these young men do not conduct themselves, on shore, in the careful manner that must be expected of civilian instructors to cadets."" ""Let me try to get at your meaning, sir, if you please,"" begged Somers, after standing for a few seconds with clenched fists. ""Do you mean that my friends have been going into tough resorts on shore?""""It's very strange,"" returned the lieutenant commander, ""that such things seem to happen generally to Mr. Benson when he gets on shore. I know I have been ashore, in all parts of the world, without having such things happen to me.""""There is something behind this, sir, that doesn't spell bad conduct on the part of either of my friends,"" cried Eph, hotly. ""There's some plot, some trick in the whole thing that we don't understand. And we might understand much more about it, sir, if your midshipman had arrested that pair of blackguards on the sloop, and brought them back with us.""""Had Mr. Benson and Mr. Hastings been members of the naval forces we could have done that,"" replied Mr. Mayhew. ""Probably you don't understand, Mr. Somers, how very careful the Navy has to be about making arrests in times of peace, when the civil authorities are all supreme. We carried our right as far as it could possibly be stretched when we boarded and searched that sloop for you."""
"""I don't care so much about that,"" contended Eph, warmly. ""But it does jar on me, sir, to have you take such a view of my friends. You don't know them; you don't understand them as Mr. Farnum and Mr. Pollard do.""""Perhaps you wouldn't blame me as much for my opinions,"" replied Mr. Mayhew, ""if you could look at the matter from my viewpoint, Mr. Somers. I am in charge of this cruise, which is one of instruction to naval cadets, and I am in a very large measure responsible for the conduct and good behavior of young men who have been selected as instructors to the cadets. If you were in my place, Mr. Somers, would you be patient over young men who, when they get ashore, get into one unseemly scrape after another? Or would you wonder, as I do, whether it will not be best for me to end this practice cruise and sail back to Annapolis, there to make my report in the matter?""""I'm afraid I shall have to, if I want to talk with your friends,"" replied the lieutenant commander, smiling coldly. ""And now, Mr. Somers, you and I had better leave here. The doctor and his nurse will want the room cleared in order to look after their patients. I hope your friends will be all right in the morning,"" added the naval officer, as the pair gained the deck.""Now, see here, sir,"" began Eph, earnestly, all over again. ""I hope you'll soon begin to understand that, whatever has happened, there are no two straighter boys alive than Jack Benson and Hal Hastings.""""I trust you're right,"" replied Mr. Mayhew, less coldly. ""Yet, what can you expect me to think, now that Benson has been in such scrapes three different times? And, in this last instance, he drags even the quiet Mr. Hastings into the affair with him.""""Now, of course, from his way of looking at it, I can't blame him so very much,"" admitted Eph Somers, as he leaned over the rail, watching Mr. Mayhew going back through the darkness. ""But Jack--great old Jack!--having any liking at all for mixing up in saloons and such places on shore! Ha, ha! Ho, ho!""Williamson, now able to leave his motors, came on deck, asking an account of what had happened. The machinist listened in amazement, though, like Eph, he needed no proof that the boys, whatever trouble they had encountered, had met honestly and innocently.""Oh, yes, I suppose so,"" nodded Somers, gloomily. ""I've been trying to tell myself that. But it would be fearful, wouldn't it, if the 'Farnum' were ordered away from the fleet, and Jack disgraced, just because of things he really didn't do.""Williamson, however, having had some sleep earlier in the night, was not drowsy, now. He lighted a pipe, lingering on the platform deck. Eph, not being a user of tobacco, went below to find that Doctor McCrea, from the gunboat, was sitting in the cabin, reading a book he had chosen from the book-case.""I've brought the young men around somewhat,"" reported the physician. ""I've made them throw off the drug, and now I've left some stuff with the nurse to help brace them up. They'll have sour stomachs and aching heads in the morning, though."""
"""I'm inclined to believe you,"" nodded the surgeon. ""They have splendid, clear skins, eyes bright as diamonds, sound, sturdy heartbeats, and they're full of vitality. I've met boys from the slums, once in a while--beer-drinkers and cigarette-smokers. But such boys never show the splendid physical condition that your friends possess.""With that the submarine boy passed on to the starboard stateroom. He would have given much to have stepped into the room opposite, but felt, from the doctor's manner, that the latter did not wish his patients disturbed.""Doctor McCrea as good as admitted that we--won't have anything to do to-day. What's wrong?"" Then, after a brief pause: ""Good heavens, does Mr. Mayhew believe we've been acting disgracefully? Are we barred out of the instruction work?""The red-haired boy, however, was spared the pain of going any further, for, at that moment, a heavy tread was heard on the spiral staircase. Then Lieutenant Commander Mayhew, holding himself very erect, one hand resting against the scabbard of the sword that he wore at his side, came into view below.Many were the questions that the naval officer put to the two victims of the last night's mishap. All the time his eyes studied their faces keenly. Apparently, it needed a lot of assurance to half convince Mr. Mayhew that the two submarine boys were telling him the truth.""Well, gentlemen,"" he said, at last, rising and speaking with great deliberation, ""I believe you to be gentlemen, which means that you are young men of honor, if it means anything at all. Your story is so strange that--pardon me--it is difficult to credit. Yet I have no evidence that it is not true. I am sorry we have not in custody the two men who sailed that sloop last night--""""It is a mighty likely thing that, if you question that fellow, Truax, that you have on board, you may be able to learn something from him. For I tell you, sir, there's some plot on hand to discredit the Pollard submarine boats with the United States Government. There's a scheme, too, to ruin Jack Benson--but that's only a part of the bigger plot to discredit our company's boats with the Navy, sir.""""I'll see if I can hit upon a tactful way of questioning Truax,"" replied the naval officer, after a while. ""And now, Mr. Benson, since you and Mr. Hastings are not in the least fit to instruct any of the cadets to-day, I'll send out sections on board the 'Pollard' only, under command of my executive officer, Lieutenant Halpin. To-morrow you should be in shape to resume your duties. Yet, if I permit this, I must make one condition.""""As long as you remain on this present tour of duty, Mr. Benson, and you, also, Mr. Hastings, you are requested not to leave the 'Farnum,' except with my knowledge and consent. Will that be satisfactory to you?""Though at first they felt some spirited resentment against the very plain suspicions of Lieutenant Commander Mayhew, it was not long before both the victims of the queer work of the night before began to see that there was an abundance of reason and good sense in the naval officer's belief and attitude.But they _did_ take it, and, as is always the case, with benefit to their general sense of discipline. In fact, when ordered aboard the gunboat, before eight o'clock the next morning, Jack Benson and Hal Hastings, in their best uniforms, and looking as natty as could be, appeared quite the ideal of young submarine officers."
"""Oh, you will be in command of your boat, Mr. Benson,"" continued Mr. Mayhew, noting the start and interpreting it correctly. ""Mr. Trahem may make some suggestions, if he thinks them necessary, but you will command, sir, and you will instruct the midshipmen.""In due time the section of naval cadets came on board. Mr. Mayhew was also thoughtful enough to send a naval machinist to take the place of Sam Truax in the engine room. Thus Hal had two men to look after the motors and other machinery under his direction, leaving Eph at Jack's more personal orders.""The lieutenant commander sends you word, with his compliments,"" reported Ensign Trahern, ""that, after leaving the bay, the formation will be as usual. The signal to halt and be ready for the tour of instruction will be given when we are about ten miles off the coast, due East.""When the starting order came from the gunboat, just before the ""Hudson"" glided ahead in the lead, Mr. Surles gave the order to cast loose from moorings. The engine room bell jangled; Surles, for the first time in his life, was watch officer of a submarine torpedo boat.""Captain Benson,"" he stated, ""I have inspected all the submerging machinery, the tanks, the compressed air apparatus, and all, and find everything in good order. We can go below the surface at any moment.""Ensign Trahern waited until the last of the cadets had filed below, then followed them. Last of all came Jack Benson, after having lowered the short signal mast and made other preparations. Now he stepped inside the conning tower, swiftly making all fast. Then he called Midshipman Surles up the stairway to the tower wheel.""It can be done there, when the officer in charge of the boat is up there,"" Jack answered. ""The diving, and the rising, may be controlled at this point in the cabin. Mr. Hastings, give us eight miles ahead from the electric motors.""""We're going down, now, gentlemen,"" called Jack. ""Observe the shifting record on the depth gauge, as we go lower and lower. Also, look out for your footing, for we dive on an inclined plane. Now--here we go!""""That's one of the peculiarities of submarine boating,"" explained Jack Benson. ""A good many land-lubbers imagine we use powerful searchlights to find our way under water, but a light powerful enough to show us twenty feet ahead of our own bow hasn't yet been made by man. So, when you dive beneath the surface, you simply have to go it blind. As a result, you take your bearings and guess your distance before you dive. That guess is all you have to go upon in judging where to come up to strike at an enemy's hull. But that guess can be made with splendid accuracy when you understand your work well enough.""After having finished the prescribed distance under water, Captain Jack turned on the compressed air to expel the water gradually from the compartments. So easily was this done that there was no real sensation of rising. Suddenly the conning tower appeared above water. There was a quick rush upward for the platform deck. None of these middies ever having been below before, in a submarine boat, several of them had been on tenterhooks of anxiety. Not one of them, however, by word or gesture had betrayed the fact."
"""I think you'll find, gentlemen, that it will seem like the longest half hour you can remember,"" announced young Captain Benson. ""My friends and I have spent many long hours under the surface, though we have never yet gotten over the terrible monotony of such a trip. Twenty-four hours under, I think, would make a lunatic of the bravest or the most stolid man.""""Whew-ew-ew!"" whistled several of the naval cadets. Not one of them was a coward, yet, in their experience, the thought that they had put in barely more than a third of the ordered time under water made some of them fidget.Then passed what seemed like an eternity of seconds. All the time the electric motors ran, almost noiselessly. The slight tremor imparted to the craft by the propeller shafts seemed like an ominous rumbling. Jack's voice had ceased. No one felt like talking. From time to time Skipper Jack glanced at his watch; his face, expressionless, gave no clue to the eagerly watching naval cadets. But at last young Benson's hand reached toward the compressed air apparatus.Up above, in the tower, the midshipman bending over the compass, suddenly realized that daylight was filtering down through the water. In another instant the midshipman glanced up to find the tower above the surface.Yet Cadet Midshipman Osgoodby gasped as though he had intended to scream instead. For, right ahead, her great bows looming up in the path of the little submarine, was a big liner, coming straight toward them!On came the great liner, and now her bow was right atop of the bow at the forward end of the submarine's platform deck. There was just an instant to spare, but the ""Farnum"" shot past the oncoming, hostile-looking bows. In another moment the little craft, now more than awash, was out of harm's way.None the less, the alarm had been passed on to those aboard the liner. That great craft, bound up from South Africa, carried diamonds and gold coin, in the purser's vaults in the hold, amounting in value to more than four million dollars.""The only up-to-date pirate would be one that came in a submarine boat,"" Captain Coster had laughingly told his passengers. ""A submarine boat could get away again, without leaving a trail. In these days no other kind of pirate craft could long escape.""So the passengers had joked each other about the submarine boat that would meet them, and rob the liner of its precious cargo. Bets had laughingly been offered that the submarine pirate would be encountered off the coast of the United States.Yet, in the excitement that followed, the girl uttered a shriek and tottered. Her brother's hold was loosened for the instant, in his own bewilderment. Before he could recover, the girl had plunged down toward the water. With a frantic yell, the brother leaned too far out to seize her. He, too, plunged over the rail."
"No sooner had his feet touched the platform deck than Jack threw down his cap. His blouse followed, almost in the same instant. Racing to the rail, the submarine boy calculated his distance, then sprang overboard, striking out desperately.Word had been carried to the ""Greytown's"" bridge, and the big craft was slowing up as rapidly as her headway permitted, while an officer and several men rushed to lower and man a boat. Yet the boat, when it struck the water, was something more than a quarter of a mile away from the spot where the young woman and her brother had fallen overboard.Splash! splash! The order had come too late to stop these last divers. A solitary midshipman, hatless and with his blouse half off, stood beside the ensign, both of them knee-deep in discarded parts of uniform, while Eph peered out from the conning tower.It was of no use. She clung the tighter. There was but one course that would save time--to strike her a blow on the forehead that would render her senseless. But Jack could not bring himself to strike a woman.The cry led half a dozen of the young men toward the all but exhausted rescuer. They came with long, lusty strokes that brought them to Benson, quickly, while he trod water and tried to raise the face of the girl above the surface.In the meantime, four other midshipmen swam close to where the girl's athletic brother had been seen to go down. He came up, at last, more than half gone, but the middies pounced upon him--and then he was safe.Hal was at the wheel, now, with Williamson and the naval machinist below in the engine room. That gave Eph Somers a chance to spring out on the platform deck with Ensign Trahern and the sole remaining midshipman.The steamship's boat, too, pulled by a strong, well-trained crew, was now getting close to the scene. So it came about that the liner's lifeboat picked up Jack, the girl and her brother. The middies, disdaining any such outside interference, calmly turned and made for the ""Farnum.""Under that vigorous treatment Walter Carruthers, as the young man afterwards declared himself to be, was quickly brought around. The middies had much harder work in reviving the girl. Her brother sat by watching the work.""Oh, no,"" replied one of the midshipmen, suspending his rescue work for an instant. ""In fact, if there were women here to do the work--loosening her corsets, and all that sort of thing, you know--Miss Carruthers would be sitting up in short time.""The ""Greytown,"" in the meantime, had manoeuvered as close as was safe for such a big craft to come. The ship's doctor put off in a lifeboat, and soon declared his patient fit to be removed to the liner.The commanding officer of the ""Hudson,"" having learned that something had happened was now heading the gunboat toward the ""Farnum."" In another half hour the naval fleet was together again, while the ""Greytown"" was rapidly vanishing along the northern horizon."
"On receiving a report by megaphone, Lieutenant Commander Mayhew's first act was to order all of the drenched, and now chilled, midshipmen aboard the parent vessel. Here they were treated with rub-downs, dry clothing and hot black coffee. Even Jack Benson had been ordered on board, and he had to pass before Doctor McCrea at that.Sam Truax meekly submitted, then sat, perfectly still, while Doctor McCrea paced the brig for two full minutes. Then the ""sawbones"" took the thermometer from between Truax's lips and inspected it keenly.""Get on to this, Truax. Don't think of attempting to walk,"" ordered the surgeon. ""Sentry, I am taking your prisoner to the sick bay. I'll make proper report of my action to the lieutenant commander.""The ""sick bay"" is the hospital part of a warship. It is a place provided with wide, comfortable berths and all the appliances for taking good care of ill men. Sam Truax was carefully placed in one of the berths. He was the only patient there at the time.But, in a minute, something happened. A man may feel as well as ever, at one moment. Twenty minutes later, however, if he vomits, it is impossible to convince himself that he feels anything like well.More of the same draught was brought, and the sick man made to swallow it. Even a third and a fourth dose were administered. Sam Truax became so much worse, in fact, that he did not even hear when the bow cable chains of the gunboat grated as the anchors were let go opposite Blair's Cove just before dark.""Here's Mr. Benson, Truax,"" announced Doctor McCrea. ""Now, my man, if there is anything of which you want to unburden your mind, go ahead and do it. The rest of us can bear witness, and help matters straight if, in your better health, you have done anything that needs righting.""""I found that mulatto in a low den,"" confessed the sick man. ""I told him you carried a lot of money, and that he'd be welcome to it all if he'd decoy you somewhere, keep you all night, and then send you back, looking like a tramp, to the Naval Academy at the last moment.""""Yes; and of course they wanted to get the business away from the Pollard crowd,"" confessed Sam Truax. ""They told Tip Gaynor it would be worth ten thousand dollars to him for each Sidenham boat he could sell to the United States Government. Tip wanted that money, and your Pollard people were the hardest ones he had to beat. So Tip hired me--""""I don't believe they did,"" replied Truax. ""In fact, Gaynor as good as told me the Sidenhams didn't know anything about his proposed tricks. He told me I must be very careful to keep the Sidenham name out of it all."""
"""Yes. From what I hear. He was the blackbearded man who drugged you and shanghaied you in the white knockabout. Only Tip doesn't usually wear a beard. He has grown it in the last three or four weeks, in order to hide himself from people who know him well. Then he came down here to Blair's Cove and rented a house so he could watch things. He had a tip that the instruction cruise would center around this little bay.""""Then it shows you, Truax,"" broke in Doctor McCrea, now laughing, ""how far below the mark you shot in guessing at Jack Benson's ingenuity and brains. For it was he showed me how to induce you to make this confession, voluntarily, after having refused to answer any of the lieutenant commander's questions.""""Why, my man, I mean,"" grinned the naval surgeon, ""that, when I was first called in to you, you were no more sick than I was. You were scared, first of all, by the remarks of others. Then, after we got you to bed in here, we dosed you with ippecac a few times. That started your stomach to moving up and down until you were convinced that you were a very sick man.""""Oh, you're not very badly poisoned,"" laughed Doctor McCrea. ""About the most that you need, now, is to get into your clothes and take a few turns up and down the deck with a marine. The fresh air will brace you up all right. I shan't be surprised if the ippecac leaves you with an appetite after a while.""""The prisoner, Truax, sir, escaped while taking a walk on deck under guard of a marine. He took to the water headlong, sir. The marine fired after him through the darkness, sir, and a second shot was fired. The officer of the deck sends his compliments, sir, and wants to know if Truax is to be pursued by men in a small boat?""Though a very thorough search was made, Sam Truax was not found. It was thought, at the time, that the fellow must have been drowned. Months, afterward, however, it was learned that he was skulking in Europe with Tip Gaynor, who had received word in time to make his escape also.It may be said, in passing, that neither Mr. Farnum nor Mr. Pollard felt it necessary to go to the trouble of trying to have the scoundrels arrested and extradited to this country, and in this Jack Benson agreed. Both rascals were rather certain, thereafter, to give the United States a wide berth.For some time David Pollard had been holding aloof and keeping very quiet--a habit of his, often displayed for long periods. About this time, however, Mr. Pollard returned, with a triumphant twinkle in his eyes. He had been hard at work upon, and had perfected, an improved device for the discharge of torpedoes through the bow tube of the Pollard submarine boat.It is to be mentioned, also, that the Sidenham Submarine Company, while admitting that Gaynor had been entrusted with the sale of their boats to the Government, disclaimed all knowledge of the methods that salesman had been employing. Everyone believed the disclaimer of the Sidenham concern, yet up to date none of its boats have been sold to the United States Government."
