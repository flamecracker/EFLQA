She sat on the floor in the middle of the long drawing-room of her New York home. To say she was surrounded by flowers, faintly expresses it. She was hemmed in, barricaded, nearly smothered in flowers.""Friends!"" cried Patty; ""nobody could have as many friends as this! These flowers must be also from my enemies, my casual acquaintances, and indeed from utter strangers! I think the whole hilarious populace of New York has gone mad on the subject of sending flowers!""Even as she spoke, Jane came in with several more boxes, followed by Miller, fairly staggering under an enormous box that was almost too much for one man to carry. Behind him was Nan, who went straight to Patty and held out both hands to assist her to rise.""That's so, Nan,"" and Patty scrambled to her feet. ""Come on, girls, let's gather our foodings while we may. These flowers will keep; but I shudder to think of the accumulation when we come back from luncheon!""""Dunno, Nancy; probably the Czar of Russia or the King of the Cannibal Islands. But I mean to take time to eat my luncheon in peace, even if the flowers aren't all in place by the time the company comes.""After some search, Roger discovered a small envelope, with a card inside. The card read, ""Mr. William Farnsworth,"" and written beneath the engraved name was the message, ""With congratulations and best wishes.""But the crowd of merry young people set to work, and in an hour the floral chaos was reduced to a wonderful vision of symmetry and beauty. Under Mr. Hepworth's directions, the flowers were banked on the mantels and window-seats, and hung in groups on the wall, and clustered on the door-frames in a profusion which had behind it a methodical and symmetrical intent.""It's perfectly beautiful!"" declared Nan, who, with her husband, was taking her first view of the finished effect. ""It's a perfect shame to spoil this bower of beauty by cramming it with a crowd of people, who will jostle your bouquets all to bits.""""Well, we can't help it,"" said Patty. ""You see, we invited the people, as well as the flowers, so we must take the consequences. But they can't reach those that are up high, and as soon as the party is over, I'm going to put them all in fresh water----""""Well, you may go now,"" and Patty smiled at him. ""Your work is done here, and I'm going away to dress. Good-bye, Ken; this is the last time you'll see me as a little girl. When next we meet, I shall be a young lady, a fully-fledged society lady, whose only thoughts will be for dancing and gaiety of all sorts."""
"""Thank you, Ken,"" said Patty, for there was a note of earnestness in Kenneth's voice that the girl was quick to catch. They had been friends since childhood, and while Patty did not take her ""coming out"" very seriously, yet she realised that it meant she was grown up and a child no longer.""Oh, don't do it now, Mr. Hepworth,"" said Patty, laughing; ""the occasion is solemn enough, I'm sure, and if you lecture me, I shall burst into large weeps of tears! Do let me 'come out' without being lectured, and you can come round to-morrow and give me all the warnings you like.""""Well, it isn't!"" declared Patty. ""I may have a wedding some day, but that's in the far, far future; why, I'm only just entering society, and when I'm married, I suppose I shall leave it. I expect to have heaps of fun between this and then.""The programme for the occasion was an afternoon reception, from four o'clock until seven. This was really Patty's début. A dinner at eight was to follow, to which were invited about a dozen of her dearest friends, and after this would be a dance, to which a goodly number more were asked.""Well, I haven't, little steppy-mother. It will be just about all Miss Patricia Fairfield can do to get into her purple and fine linen by four o'clock p.m., and methinks you'd better begin on your own glad toilette, or you'll be late yourself.""Patty looked adorable in soft white chiffon, untrimmed, save for some fine lace round the slightly low-cut neck. She wore a string of small but perfect pearls which her father had given her for the occasion, and she carried a beautiful bouquet of orchids, which was Nan's gift.Patty had never looked prettier. Her rose-leaf cheeks were slightly flushed with excitement, and her big violet eyes were bright and sparkling. Her golden hair, which was really unusual in texture and quantity, was dressed simply, yet in a manner very becoming to her small, prettily poised head. On her brow and temples it rippled in natural ringlets, which gave her piquant face a charming, childish effect. Patty was certainly a beauty, but she was of such a sweet, unspoiled nature, and of such simple, dainty manners, that everybody loved her.Her father looked at her rather thoughtfully, half unable to realise that his little Patty had really grown up and was taking her place in society. He had no fears for her, he knew her sweet nature too well; but he was earnestly hoping that she was starting out on a life of happiness and well-being. Though healthy and moderately strong, Patty was not of a robust constitution, and there was danger that too much gaiety might result in a nervous breakdown. This, Mr. Fairfield determined to guard against; and resolved that, while Patty should be allowed generally to do as she chose, he should keep a strict eye against her overdoing.Nan had much the same thoughts as she looked at the lovely débutante, so exquisite in her fresh young beauty. Nan's gown of heavy white lace was very becoming, and though a secondary figure, she ably shared the honours of the afternoon with Patty.And then the guests began to arrive, and Patty learned what it meant to stand and shake hands, and receive the same compliments and congratulations over and over again. It was interesting at first, but she grew very tired as the hours went by.""Now, I say,"" exclaimed a cheery voice, suddenly, ""it can't be that you have to stand here continuously from four to seven! Mrs. Fairfield, mayn't I take Patty to get a cup of tea or an ice, and you stay here and 'come out' until she returns?"""
"It was Philip Van Reypen who made this request, and Nan consented readily. ""Yes, indeed, Philip,"" she said, ""do take her off to rest a minute. I think most of the people have arrived; and, anyway, you must bring her back shortly.""""I ought to find you a 'quiet little corner,'"" he said, smiling; ""but I don't see such a thing anywhere about. So I'll just place you on one of these gimcrack gilt chairs, and I'll ask you to keep this one next, for me, until I make a raid on the table. What will you have?""""Well, I don't care if I did! It was the proper thing to say, and nobody could say it a million times in succession, without sounding parrotty! I know now how the President feels when he has to shake hands with the whole United States!""""Yes; the mad rush is pretty much over. Only a few late stragglers now, and Elise is floating them. Here's Roger. He says you wouldn't speak to him this afternoon, except to say, 'oh, thank you!' three times.""So Patty went back to the drawing-room, and insisted that her stepmother should go for a little refreshment. ""I can hold the fort alone now,"" she said; ""you've no idea how capable I am, now that I'm really out. Run along, Nan, and get some of those sandwiches; they're awfully good.""""She's a fine girl--a fine girl."" Mr. Galbraith's eyes rested on his daughter a little thoughtfully. He was a Chicago man, who had made his fortune suddenly, and was a little bewildered at his own success. His one interest in life, outside of business matters, was his daughter Mona, for whom he desired every possible good, and to whose wishes and whims he always willingly consented.At her request, he had closed his Chicago home and come to spend the winter in New York, that Mona might be near Patty, whom she adored. The Galbraiths were living for the winter at the Plaza Hotel, and Patty, who had grown fond of Mona, was glad to have her friend so near her.""She's a fine girl,"" Mr. Galbraith repeated, ""and a good-looking girl."" He paused a moment, and then added in a sudden burst of confidence, ""but, Patty, I wish she had a mother. You know how I idolise her, but I can't do for her what a mother would do. I've urged her to have a chaperon or a companion of some sort, but she won't do it. She says a father is chaperon enough for her, and so we live alone in that big hotel, and I'm afraid it isn't right. Right for her, I mean. I don't care a snap about conventions, but Mona is impulsive, even headstrong, and I wish she had an older woman to guide and advise her."""
"""I wish she did, Mr. Galbraith,"" said Patty, earnestly, for the two were chatting by themselves, and no one else was within hearing. ""I've thought about it, and I've talked with my stepmother about it. Perhaps I could persuade Mona to do as you wish her to.""""I hope you can, Patty; I do hope you can. You know, Mona is dignified and all that, and as proud as they make them. Nobody would dare to speak to her if she didn't want them to; but, Patty, here's the trouble. There's a young man at the hotel named Lansing. He's not especially attractive, and yet, somehow, he has gained Mona's favour. I have told my girl that I do not like him, but she only laughs and says carelessly that he's all right. Now, I mustn't detain you longer, my child; there are people waiting to speak to you. But, some time, I want to have a little talk to you about this, and perhaps you can help me in some way. For I believe, Patty, that that Lansing man is trying to win my girl for the sake of her money. He has all the appearances of a fortune-hunter, and I can't let Mona throw herself away on such."" At eight o'clock that same evening, Patty came down to her own dinner party. An hour's rest had freshened her up wonderfully, and she had changed her little white frock for a dinner gown of pale green chiffon, sparkling with silver embroidery. It trailed behind her in a most grown-up fashion, and she entered the drawing-room with an exaggerated air of dignity.""No, not you,"" and Patty looked at him, critically; ""you won't do, and neither will Kenneth, nor Phil Van Reypen, nor Mr. Hepworth."" She looked at them each in turn, and smiled so merrily that they could take no offence. ""I think,"" she said, ""I shall select the best-looking and best-natured gentleman, and walk out with him."" Whereupon she tucked her arm through her father's, and led the way to the dining-room, followed by the rest of the merry crowd.The dinner was a beautiful one, for Nan had spared no pains or thought to make it worthy of the occasion. At the girls' places were beautiful souvenirs, in the shape of fans of carved ivory with lace mounts, while the men received attractive stick-pins.""Well, rather!"" declared Patty. ""Why, I'd feel like dancing if I'd been through a--civil war! I could scarcely keep still when the orchestra was playing this afternoon, and I'm crazy for to-night's dance to begin.""Patty again stood by Nan to receive them, and after greeting many people she knew, she was surprised to find herself confronted by a stranger. He was a thick-set, stockily-built man, several years older than most of Patty's friends. He had black hair and eyes and a short black moustache and a round, heavy type of face. His black eyes were of the audacious sort, and he flashed a glance of admiration at Patty. Before she could speak, or even offer her hand, Mona sprang forward, saying, ""Patty, this is my friend Mr. Lansing. I took the liberty of inviting him to your dance. Mrs. Fairfield, may I present Mr. Lansing?"""
"Patty was angry. This, of course, must be the man of whom Mr. Galbraith had spoken, and, aside from the fact that he seemed undesirable, Patty felt that Mona had no right to invite him without asking permission from her hostess.But Nan knew nothing of all this, and she cordially greeted the stranger because he was a friend of Mona's. Patty recovered her equilibrium sufficiently to say, ""How do you do, Mr. Lansing?"" in a non-committal sort of way, but she couldn't refrain from giving Mona a side glance of reproof, to which, however, that young woman paid no attention.In another moment Mona had drifted away, and had taken Mr. Lansing with her. Patty turned to speak to Nan about him, but just then some more guests arrived; and then the dancing began, and Patty had no further opportunity.As Patty had promised, she gave the first dance to Philip Van Reypen; and after that she was fairly besieged by would-be partners. The fact that she was hostess at her own coming-out ball, the fact that she danced beautifully, and the fact that she was so pretty and charming, all combined to make her, as was not unusual, the most popular girl present.Patty had never known Roger to be so out of temper, and she resented his tone, which was almost rude. Now, for all her sweetness, Patty had a touch of perversity in her nature, and Roger had roused it. So she said: ""I don't know why you speak like that, Roger. He's a friend of Mona's, and lives at the Hotel Plaza, where she lives.""Patty was not quite ingenuous in this speech, for she knew perfectly well, from what Mr. Galbraith had said to her, that it was not all right. But she was irritated by Roger's demeanour, and perversely disagreed with him.""No,"" and then Patty hesitated. She did know something,--she knew what Mr. Galbraith had told her. But she was not of a mind to tell this to Roger. ""I only met him as I was introduced,"" she said, ""and Mona has never so much as even mentioned him to me.""""It _was_ necessary, Patty, and you know it, if Mona doesn't. Now, look here; you and I are Mona's friends; and if there are any social matters that she isn't quite familiar with, it's up to us to help her out a little. And I, for one, don't believe that man is the right sort for her to be acquainted with; and I'm going to find out about him.""And then they both realised that they were bickering like two children, and they laughed simultaneously as they swept on round the dancing-room. The music stopped just then, and as they were near a window-seat, Patty sat down for a moment. ""You go on, Roger,"" she said, ""and hunt up your next partner, or fight a duel with Mr. Lansing, or do whatever amuses you. My partner will come to hunt me up, I'm sure, and I'll just wait here.""Now, Patty had not chosen to express to Roger her real opinion of this new man, but in reality she did not approve of him. Though fairly good-looking and correctly dressed, there was about him a certain something--or perhaps, rather, he lacked a certain something that invariably stamps the well-bred man. He stared at Patty a trifle too freely; he sat down beside her with a little too much informality; and he began conversation a little too familiarly. All of these things Patty saw and resented, but as hostess she could not, of course, be openly rude."
"Patty looked at him coldly. She was not accustomed to this style of expression. Her friends perhaps occasionally used a slang word or term, but it was done in a spirit of gaiety or as a jest, whereas this man used his expressions as formal conversation.Patty made no response to this, and Mr. Lansing turned suddenly to look at her. ""I say, Miss Fairfield, do you know what I think? I think you are prejudiced against me, and I think somebody put you up to it, and I think I know who. Now, look here, won't you give me a fair show? Do you think it's just to judge a man by what other people say about him?""He wagged his head so sagaciously at this speech, that Patty was forced to smile. On a sudden impulse, she decided to speak frankly. ""Suppose I tell you the truth, Mr. Lansing, that I'm not accustomed to being addressed in such--well, in such slangy terms.""Patty rose without a word, and in a moment they were circling the floor. Mr. Lansing was a good dancer, and especially skilful in guiding his partner. Patty, herself such an expert dancer, was peculiarly sensitive to the good points of a partner, and she enjoyed the dance with Mr. Lansing, even though she felt she did not like the man. And yet he had a certain fascination in his manner, and when the dance was over, Patty looked at him with kinder eyes than she had when they began. But all that he had won of her favour he lost by his final speech, for as the dance ended, he said, brusquely: ""Now, I'll tumble you into a seat, and chase my next victim.""""You are a great factor in my happiness, Mr. Van Reypen,"" she said, saucily; ""but you are not all the world to me! So, if I flock on the stairs with you, I must know what other doves will be perching there.""""Habit,"" said Patty, laughing, as she made her way up a few steps; ""I've always eaten my party suppers on the stairs, and I dare say I always shall. When I build a house I shall have a great, broad staircase, like they have in palaces, and then everybody can eat on the stairs.""""Seats all taken,"" declared Roger, who had had a real tiff with Mona on the subject of her new friend. The others, too, did not seem to welcome Mr. Lansing, and though one or two moved slightly, they did not make room for the newcomers.Patty was uncertain what she ought to do. She remembered what Mr. Galbraith had said, and she felt that to send Mona and Mr. Lansing away would be to throw them more exclusively in each other's society; and she thought that Mr. Galbraith meant for her to keep Mona under her own eye as much as possible. But to call the pair upon the stairs and make room for them would annoy, she felt sure, the rest of the group.She looked at Roger and at Philip Van Reypen, and both of them gave her an eloquent glance of appeal not to add to their party. Then she chanced to glance at Mr. Hepworth and found him smiling at her. She thought she knew what he meant, and immediately she said, ""Come up here by me, Mona; and you come too, Mr. Lansing. We can make room easily if we move about a little.""Mr. Van Reypen and Roger Farrington declared their intention of making a raid on the dining-room and kidnapping waiters with trays of supplies. On their return the supper plates were passed up to those on the stairs, and Van Reypen and Roger calmly walked away."
"Patty knew perfectly well what they meant. They intended her to understand that if she and Mona persisted in cultivating the acquaintance of the man they considered objectionable, they did not care to be of the party.Christine and Mr. Hepworth joined in the conversation, and perhaps because of what Patty had said earlier in the evening, Mr. Lansing avoided to a great extent the use of slang expressions, and made himself really interesting and entertaining.""Do you think so?"" said Patty, looking at Christine in astonishment. ""He was rather nicer than I thought him at first, but, Christine, I never dreamed _you_ would approve of him! But you never can tell when a quiet little mouse like you is going to break loose. Why did you like him, Christine?""The rest of the evening was danced gaily away, but neither Roger nor Philip Van Reypen came near Patty. To be sure, she had plenty of partners, but she felt a little offended at her two friends' attitude, for she knew she hadn't really deserved it.But when the dance was over, Patty's good-nights to Roger and Philip were quite as gentle and cordial as those she said to any one else. She smiled her best smiles at them, and though not as responsive as usual, they made polite adieux and departed with no further reference to the troublesome matter.""In the whole United States, you mean,"" said Patty, complacently, as she took a spoonful of chocolate. ""Yes, the party in all its parts was all right. There wasn't a flaw. But, oh, Nan, I got into a scrap with the boys.""""Nan,"" and Patty shook her spoon solemnly at her stepmother, ""I've come to realise that there is slang and slang. Now, the few little innocent bits I use, don't count at all, because I just say them for fun and to help make my meaning clear. But that man last night,--that Lansing man,--why, Nan, his slang is altogether a different matter.""""Goodness! it sounds like a game of bowls. No, I don't mean that; but--well, I'll tell you what I do mean. He said we weren't fair to him, to judge him adversely, not knowing anything about him. And I think so, too, Nan; it doesn't seem fair or right to say a man is a bounder,--that's what Roger called him,--when we don't know anything about him, really.""Seeing she could get no sympathy from her stepmother, Patty dropped the subject of her quarrels, and remarked, with a yawn, ""Well, I suppose I may as well get up, and begin on those flower notes. What shall I say, Nan, something like this? 'Miss Patricia Fairfield thanks you for your kind donation of expensive blossoms, but as it's such a bother to write the notes of acknowledgment, she really wishes you hadn't sent them.'""""Oh, I forgot to tell you. We're going to have a club, just a little club,--only four of us girls. And, Nan, you know there are so many clubs that make an awful fuss and yet don't really _do_ anything. Well, this is going to be a _Doing_ Club. We're going to be real _doers_."""
"""We don't know yet, that's what the meeting's for this afternoon. But we're going to do good, you know--some kind of good. You know, Nan, I always said I didn't want to be just a social butterfly and nothing else. I want to accomplish something that will give some joy or comfort to somebody.""Patty's blue eyes looked very earnest and sincere as she said this, and Nan kissed her, saying, ""I know you do, Patty, dearest, and I know you'll succeed in your doing. If I can help you in any way, be sure to ask me; and now I'll run away and let you dress.""It was not a difficult task, and she did not really mind it, though it was a long list. But Patty had a knack at writing graceful little notes, and although she jested about it, she was really grateful to the kind friends who had sent the flowers.""I don't know _why_ I have so many friends,"" she said to herself, as she scanned the rows of names. ""To be sure, a great many are really friends of father's and Nan's, but there's a lot of our crowd, too, and lots of out of town people. Perhaps it would be a good idea to do the farthest away first, and so work back to New York.""Patty picked up Mr. Farnsworth's card, and read again the message on it. ""H'm,"" she said to herself, ""it sounds to me a trifle formal and conventional--considering all things. Now, Little Billee is a Western man,--but how different he is from that Lansing person! I wonder what makes the difference. Little Billee isn't formal or conventional a bit, and yet his manners are as far removed from Horace Lansing's as white is from black. Oh, well, I know the reason well enough. It's because Little Billee is a thorough gentleman at heart; and the other one is,--well, I guess he's what Roger called him. Now, what shall I say to Mr. William Farnsworth by way of thanks for his truly beautiful pink roses? I'd like to write a nice, every-day letter, and tell him all about the party and everything; but, as he just sent his visiting card, with a mere line on it, I suppose I must reply very formally.""Patty began her formal note, but tore up half a dozen beginnings before she completed one to her satisfaction. This one read, ""Miss Patricia Fairfield thanks Mr. William Farnsworth sincerely for his exquisite gift of roses, and for his kind congratulations.""With the exception of the roses, Patty had never heard a word from Big Bill since they were at Spring Beach together. She had told her father and Nan of what Mr. Farnsworth had said to her down there, and as they had agreed that Patty was altogether too young even to think of such a thing as being engaged to anybody, it was wiser to hold no correspondence with him at all.Patty had liked Bill extremely, but as Arizona was far away, and she had no reason to think she would ever see him again, she gave him few thoughts. However, the thoughts, when she did allow them to come, were pleasant ones. Although she had sealed the note she intended to send, she began another one, and the opening words were ""Little Billee."" This note she wrote in the first person, and thanked him simply and naturally for the flowers. Then, for a signature, she made a carefully and daintily drawn pen-and-ink sketch of an apple blossom. She was clever at flower-sketching, and she sat a moment admiring her own handiwork. Then a flush spread over her pretty face, and she spoke sternly to herself, as was her habit when she disapproved of her own actions."
"""Patty Fairfield,"" she said, reprovingly, ""you ought to be ashamed to think of sending a personal, lettery sort of a note like that, to a man who sent you the formalest kind of a message! He only sent the flowers, because convention demanded it! He never gave you one single thought after that last time he saw you,--and that's all there is about _that_!""""No, thank you,"" and Mona tossed her head, disdainfully; ""I know what companions are! Snoopy old maids who won't let you do anything, or careless, easy-going old ladies who pay no attention to you. If I could have a companion of my own age and tastes, I'd like that,--but I suppose that wouldn't do.""""Don't let's have too much organisation,"" said Clementine. ""Do you know, I think lots of clubs, especially charity clubs, have so much organisation that they haven't anything else. One club I joined fell to pieces before it was fairly started, because the two vice-presidents squabbled so.""""I am,"" declared Elise, assuming an angelic expression, which made them all laugh, for Elise was really the one most likely to take offence at trifles, or to flare up impulsively if any one disagreed with her.""I think,"" said Patty, ""that our end and aim ought to be to do good to somebody who doesn't expect it. Now, that isn't quite what I mean,--I mean to people who wouldn't accept it if it seemed like charity, but to whom we could give a pleasure that they would really like.""""Patty, my child,"" said Clementine, ""I think your ideas are all right, but I must say you don't express them very clearly. Let's get down to something definite. Do you mean to give material things,--like presents or money?""""Oh, Patty,"" cried Mona, ""I never knew you to be so hopelessly vague. Now, for instance, how would it be if we gave a lovely motor ride to some poor shop girl, or somebody that never gets into a motor?""""No,"" said Patty; ""my mind is clearing now, and I begin to see our club. Instead of a president, we'll all four be presidents, and instead of a treasurer, we'll all four be treasurers. We'll give money when it's necessary, or we'll use our motor cars, or buy flowers, or whatever we like; but we won't have dues and officers and things.""""The principle is exactly right,"" said Clementine; ""now, let's get it down to practicability. As Mona says, we needn't necessarily choose a shop girl,--but suppose we do, many of them are free Saturday afternoon.""""Yes, perhaps, in the big shops; but there are lots of them, in offices,--or even school teachers,--who would be free Saturday afternoons. Well, anyway, here's what I'm thinking of, and you can all say what you think of it. Suppose we try, every week, to give a happy Saturday afternoon to somebody who wouldn't have it otherwise.""""Oh, if there's anything especial, we needn't consider ourselves bound to give up the afternoon,"" said Clementine. ""For that matter, we could send a couple of girls for a motor ride without going ourselves.""""They'd always remember you, Patty, if you were the bright spot,"" declared Mona, who idolised her friend. ""But I must confess I do like to be definite about this thing. Now, how's this for a plan? To-day's Thursday. Suppose we begin on Saturday and make a start at something. Suppose we each of us pick out a girl,--or a boy, for that matter,--or a child or anybody, and think what we can do to make them happy on Saturday afternoon."""
"""Now we're getting somewhere,"" said Elise, approvingly. ""I've picked mine already. She's a girl who comes to our house quite often to sew for the children. She's a sweet little thing, but she looks as if she never had a real good time in all her life. Now, can the rest of you think of anybody like that?""""Yes, I have one,"" said Mona. ""Your suggestion made me think of her. She's my manicure girl. She comes here, and sometimes she's so tired she's ready to drop! She works awfully hard, and never takes a day off, because she has to support two little sisters. But I'll make her take a holiday Saturday afternoon, somehow.""""There's a girl I'd like to have,"" said Clementine, thoughtfully; ""she's at the ribbon counter in Walker's. She always waits on me there; and she has such a wistful air, I'd like to do her a kindness. I don't suppose she could get off,--but I could go and ask the head of the department, and perhaps he'd let her.""""I can't think of anybody,"" said Patty, ""except one person, that I would simply _love_ to have. And that's a very tired and cross-looking lady who gives out embroidery patterns in a dreadful place, way down town. I believe it would sweeten her up for a year to have a little spree with us.""""I could have them here, easily enough,"" said Mona. ""Our dining-room here, would really be better than any of the homes of you girls. Because you all have people, and I haven't. Father would just as lieve lunch downstairs, in the main dining-room.""""That's lovely of you, Mona,"" said Patty. ""I was going to suggest some small, quiet restaurant, but a luncheon here in your pretty dining-room would indeed be a bright spot for them to remember. But suppose they won't come?""""Then we must ask someone instead,"" said Clementine; ""let's promise each to bring someone with us on Saturday, and if the first one we ask declines, keep on asking till we get somebody. Of course, Mona, we'll share the expense of the luncheon equally.""""No,"" said Patty, firmly; ""we'll each pay a quarter of whatever the luncheon costs. And let's have it good and substantial, and yet have some pretty, fancy things too. For, you know, this isn't a charity or a soup kitchen,--it's to give those girls a bright and beautiful scene to look back on.""""That will be all right,"" said Patty, smiling. ""Mona can fix her table, and I'll come over before the luncheon, and if she has too many or too grand flumadiddles, I'll take some of them off. I don't want our guests struck dumb by too much grandeur, but I do want things pretty and nice. Suppose we each bring a favor for our own guest."""
"""Well, we'll need two,"" said Clementine, ""and two of us girls and two guests can go in each. We'll see which cars can be used most conveniently; perhaps our fathers may have something to say on that subject. But we can arrange all such things by telephone to-morrow. The main thing is to get our guests.""But it was with a different feeling that she entered the big building this time, and she went straight to department B. On her way she met the red-headed boy who had so amused her when she was there a year ago.""Sure it is,"" and for some reason the boy added, ""miss,"" after a momentary pause, which made Patty realise his different attitude toward her, now that she wore a more elaborate costume, than when he had seen her in a purposely plain little suit.""No pass needed; she's a free show,"" the boy called after her, and in a moment Patty found herself again in the presence of the sharp-faced, tired-looking woman whom she had once interviewed regarding her embroidery work.""It's only this,"" and though Patty's errand had seemed to her simple enough before she came in, she now began to wonder how Mrs. Greene would take it. ""Some friends of mine and I are asking three or four people to lunch with us and take a little motor ride on Saturday, and I want you to come as my guest?""As it chanced, she unwittingly took the right tack. So earnest was she that her lips quivered a little, and her eyes showed a pleading, pathetic expression, as she said, ""_Please_ don't misunderstand me, Mrs. Greene. If you would enjoy it, I want you to come to our party on Saturday as our welcome guest. If you wouldn't enjoy it,--just say so,--but--but _don't_ scold me!""So Patty told her, honestly and straightforwardly, the circumstances of the party, and wound up by saying, ""I truly want you, Mrs. Greene, for the simple reason that I want you to enjoy the afternoon,--and for no other reason.""""And I'll come, and be awful glad of the chance! Why, I've never had a ride in a motor car in my life, and I've never eaten in one of those fandangle hotels; and the way you put it, I'm just crazy to go!""""Say, Miss Fairfield,"" and Mrs. Greene twisted her fingers a little nervously, ""don't think this is queer,--but won't you wear one of your real pretty dresses? I do like to see a pretty, stylish dress,--and I never get a chance.""Patty nodded a good-bye, and went on, rapidly turning over in her mind a new plan that would include Rosy in some future happy Saturday afternoon. But this plan must wait for development, as the coming Saturday was enough to occupy her thoughts for the present.""Home, Miller,"" she said, as she took her seat. Miller gave a relieved sigh, for he was always more or less afraid of Patty's escapades; and he didn't like to have her go alone into these strange buildings.""So do I,"" said Patty. ""We girls had planned to wear our plainest dresses, thinking to make our guests feel more at ease. And when Madame Greene spoke of her black mohair, I thought I'd even rip the trimming off my brown waist! But not so,--far otherwise. So I shall get me into that new American Beauty satin, and I hope to goodness it will suit her taste. I expect she's fearfully critical.""""Oh, you old wet blanket! Now, you know perfectly well, we're doing our best. And if we're awkward, we can't help it. We're going this afternoon to get the favours. What do you think of little pins,--silver gilt, or enamel?"""
"Half an hour before luncheon time, Patty walked into Mona's dining-room. She wore her new gown of American Beauty satin, softly draped with a thin black marquisette, and a soft sash of black satin. Her hat was all black, with a Beauty rose tucked under the brim, and resting against her fair hair.As she spoke, Patty was looking at herself in a long mirror and craning her neck to get a view of her back. She was fond of pretty clothes, and her new gown, though rich, was really simple in line and colouring.The girls had decided that, since Christmas was only about a fortnight away, it would be attractive to use Christmas decorations for their party. And so the round table showed crossed strips of broad red ribbon, under bands of lace, and a central decoration of a real Christmas tree, with beautiful fancy ornaments and colored electric lights. At each place was an elaborate bonbonnière of Christmas red, decked with sprays of holly. The place cards were Christmassy; and the little brooches they had bought, were in dainty boxes tied with holly ribbon.""I thought I wouldn't have any flowers on the table,"" Mona explained, ""for they didn't go with the other things. So, you see, I've these four big bunches of red carnations around the room, and I shall give them each one to take home. Of course, I have boxes ready for them,--and then, Patty, I thought we'd distribute the Christmas tree decorations among them,--and I have the boxes big, so we can put those and the place-cards and candy-boxes and souvenirs all in them. And then, you know, it won't seem like _giving_ them things; for you know yourself how keen people are to take away their place cards and such things.""""They are, indeed! I've been _surprised_ the people who have _everything_ will gather up their cards and trumpery boxes after a luncheon! And your thoughtfulness is lovely, Mona. We'll each give them our own place-card and box, too.""""No, Mona,"" she said; ""our club is made up of just us four girls, and we can find plenty to do among girls or women. At least, for this winter. If it's all a success, we can do more next winter, and perhaps get some men to help us then. If we want to take newsboys to the circus, father will go with us. Don't be everlastingly dragging in that Mr. Lansing.""""Now, Mona, don't be silly. I'm sure I don't know what you see so admirable in Mr. Lansing, but I do think you ought to be advised by others who know better than you. Why, your own father doesn't like him.""""Now, stop, Mona. You know you don't care for those things! You can have all you want, without Mr. Lansing's gifts. You like him, because he flatters you, and--well, I must admit that he has a way with him."""
"""Well, I can't! Now, look here, Patty. You know how much I care for you, but I won't have you talking to me like a Dutch Aunt. I made father bring me to New York this winter, so I could be near you, and we could have fun together. But, if you're going to scold me all the time, we won't have any fun at all.""Patty began to realise that, though Mona might be coaxed, she could never be driven. So she concluded to drop the subject, and use more thought and tact in her endeavours to break up Mona's new friendship.""My guest, Jenny Bisbee. She's the ribbon girl I told you about. I had the greatest time to get her off for the afternoon. I had to go to Walker's, you know, and see all sorts of Heads of Departments. My! they acted like Crowned Heads! They said it wouldn't do at all,--it would establish a precedent,--and all sorts of things like that. But, somehow or other, I wheedled them into it, and at last they said Jenny might come. She was just crazy about it. She said, she never has any fun in her life, except looking at the new ribbons when they come in! Oh, girls, isn't it awful _never_ to have any fun? I expect Jenny will be embarrassed, but I'm sure she'll enjoy it all. Oh, how lovely the table looks! Mona, you are a wonder! I never should have thought of all those Christmas fixings."" Elise came in, bringing her guest with her. The three girls waiting in the sitting-room were surprised to see the small, dainty person whom Elise introduced as Miss Anna Gorman. She had a sweet, sad little face, and wore a simple one-piece gown of dove-grey voile. Her hat was grey, also; a turban shape, with a small knot of pink roses at one side. Anna was not pretty, but she had a refined air, and a gentle manner. Though embarrassed, she strove not to show it, and tried to appear at ease.Mona greeted her cordially: ""How do you do, Anna?"" she said, for they had agreed to call the girls informally, by their Christian names. ""I am glad to see you. Come with me into the boudoir, and lay off your coat."" Mona herself assisted, for she thought it better not to have her maid about."
"""Well, I didn't know a table _could_ look so handsome!"" she went on. ""My land! I s'pose it's been thirty years since I've went to a real party feast, and then, I can tell you, it wasn't much like this!""Probably not, for Mona's table, with the coloured electric lights blazing from the pretty Christmas tree, the soft radiance of the room, the fragrance of flowers, the exquisite table appointments, and the pretty, kindly hostesses, was a scene well worthy of praise.Anna Gorman trembled a little as she took her seat, and sat, wide-eyed, looking almost as if in a trance of delight. Celeste Arleson was less embarrassed, as her profession took her into fine mansions and in presence of fashionable people every day.The guests all looked a trifle awestruck when the first course appeared, of grapefruit, served in tall, slender ice-glasses, each with a red ribbon tied round its stem, and a sprig of holly in the bow.""Well, I will,--as you took some. But if that ain't the greatest! Now, just let me tell you. A friend of mine,--she has seen some high society,--she was telling me a little how to behave. And she told me of a country person she knew, who had some soup in a cup once. And he thought it was tea, and he ca'mly puts in milk and sugar! Well, he was just kerflum-mixed, that poor man, when he found it was soup! So, my friend says, says she: 'Now, Almira, whatever you do, _don't_ put milk in your soup!' And, I declare to goodness, here you're doin' just that very thing!""As Patty had agreed, the luncheon was good and substantial, rather than elaborate. The broiled chicken, dainty vegetables, and pretty salad all met the guests' hearty approval and appreciation; and when the ice cream was served, Mrs. Greene discovered she had both a fork and a spoon at her disposal.""So it does, so it does,"" agreed Mrs. Greene, ""though, land knows, it ain't much like the puddin's I'm accustomed to. Cottage, rice, and bread is about the variety we get, in the puddin' line. Not but what I'm mighty grateful to get those.""""I like chocolate pudding,"" said Jenny, in a low voice, and apparently with great effort. Patty knew she made the remark because she thought it her duty to join in the conversation; and she felt such heroism deserved recognition.""So do I,"" returned Jenny, a little bolder under this expressed sympathy of tastes. ""Once I had a whole box of chocolate candies,--a pound box it was. I've got the box yet. I'm awful careful of the lace paper.""""Well, I don't see nice ladies,"" broke in Jenny. ""My, how those queens of society can snap at you! Seems 'if they blame me for everything: the stock, the price, the slow cash boys,--whatever bothers 'em, it's all my fault."""
"""Indeed it does!"" returned Jenny. ""But I'm going to forget it just for to-day. When I sit here and see these things, all so beautiful and sparkly and bright, I pretend there isn't any shop or shopping in all the world.""Mrs. Greene's cap was a tri-corne, with a gay cockade, which gave her a militant air, quite in keeping with her strong face. Patty had a ruffled night-cap, which made her look grotesque, and Anna Gorman had a frilled sunbonnet.""Yes; and I'll have them put in boxes for you, along with your cards and souvenirs, which, of course, you must take home also. And, if there's room, I'll put in some of these Christmas tree thingamajigs, and you can use them for something at Christmas time.""""Oh!"" exclaimed Jenny; ""maybe my two kid brothers won't just about go crazy over 'em! Says I to myself, just the other day, 'What's going in them kids' stockings is more'n I know; but something there must be.' And,--here you are!""""Well,"" said Mrs. Greene, ""if you ask me, I'd like best to ride up Fifth Avenue. There ought to be some fine show of dress, a bright afternoon like this. And there ain't anything I admire like stylish clothes. That's a real handsome gown you got on, Miss Fairfield.""""It's a dandy,"" observed Jenny. ""I see lots of good clothes on my customers, but they don't all have such taste as Miss Fairfield's. And all you other ladies here,"" she added, politely, glancing round.""Now, are we all ready?"" asked Mona, looking over the group. ""Mrs. Greene, I fear you won't be warm enough, though your jacket _is_ thick, isn't it? But I'm going to throw this boa round your neck, by way of precaution. Please wear it; I have another.""Down went the eight in an elevator, and Mrs. Greene was overjoyed to find that she was attended with quite as much deference as Mona herself. Elise and Clementine took their guests in the Farrington car, leaving Patty and Mona, with their guests, for the Galbraith car.""My!"" exclaimed that worthy, as she bobbed up and down on the springy cushions; ""to think it's come at last! Why, I _never_ expected to ride in one of these. I saved up once for a taxicab ride, but I had to use my savings for a case of grippe, so I never felt to try it again."""
"""Well, no; it wasn't _my_ grippe. Leastways, I didn't have it. It was a lady that lived in the same boardin' house, along with me. But she'd had misfortune, and lost her money, so I couldn't do no less than to help her. Poor thing! she was crossed in love and it made her queer. But that Rosy,--you know, that redhead boy, Miss Fairfield?""""Well, he says she was queered in love, and it made her cross! She works in our place, you know. Well, cross she is; and, my land! if she wasn't cross when she had the grippe! You know, it ain't soothin' on folks' nerves.""""My! I'm just drinkin' 'em in! Furs is worn a lot this year, ain't they? Well, I don't wonder. Why, I feel real regal in this fur of yours, Miss Galbraith. I don't know when I've had such a pleasure as the wearin' of this fur.""""Now, we'll go through the park and up Riverside Drive,"" said Mona, as they neared Eighty-sixth Street. It was pleasant in the Park, and the fine motors, with their smartly-apparelled occupants, delighted Mrs. Greene's very soul.""Well, in a manner o' speakin', they do,"" said Mrs. Greene, gently. ""Not real tears, maybe; but, you know, to weep over a bier, is a figger of speech; and so far as its meanin' goes, Grant's got it. And, after all, it's the meanin' that counts.""The younger girls chose chocolate, but Mrs. Greene said, ""Give me a cup of tea. There's nothing like it, to my mind. And to think of having tea in this beautiful place, all decked with posies. I'll just throw this fur a little open, but keep it over my shoulders. It looks so luxuriant that way.""""I live way down on East Eleventh Street,"" she said, apologetically; ""and I oughtn't to let you go clear down there with me. But,--oh, well, I might as well own up,--I'd just love to roll up to our door in this car!"""
"""And so you shall,"" said Mona, appreciating this bit of feminine vanity. ""And, Mrs. Greene, if you'll accept them, I'd like to make you a present of those furs. I don't need them, for I have several other sets, and you're very welcome to them.""""And to think I thought you ladies were stuck up!"" she said, in a voice of contrition. ""Why, two angels straight from Heaven couldn't be more kind or whole-soulder than you two are. But, Miss Galbraith, I can't accept such a gift,--I--I ought not to.""""Now, father Fairfield,"" exclaimed Patty, ""you ought to know better than that! you might as well say that a man in a prison ought never to see a ray of sunlight, because it would make him more discontented with his dark jail.""""Other people have offered to help us,"" began Mona, but Patty interrupted her, saying: ""We don't want any help from people individually. I mean, father, if you will lend us the car, and things like that, we'll be glad, of course. But we don't want any personal assistance in our plans.""""All right, chickadee; far be it from me to intrude. But I thought perhaps if you wanted to make a little excursion, say, to see the Statue of Liberty, or even to go to the circus, you might like a man along with you as a Courier General.""""That's just what we're _not_ going to do!"" she declared. ""We're only going to places where we can go by ourselves, or if we need a chaperon, we'll take Nan. But we don't want any men in on this deal.""""I don't see why,"" began Mona, but Patty promptly silenced her by saying, ""You _do_ see why. Now, Mona, don't say anything more about it. There isn't any circus now, and it's time enough when it comes, to decide about going to it; and I don't want to go, anyway. There are lots of things nicer than a circus.""Patty hesitated. The plan sounded attractive, and she quickly thought that she could invite Rosy for one of the guests and give the boy a Happy Saturday Afternoon. But she didn't want to accept anything from Mr. Lansing, though she couldn't quite bring herself to say so, frankly.""Nonsense,"" said Mona. ""You know very well, Patty, it isn't a formal club. I'm going to accept these two Hippodrome boxes, and tell the girls that we can each invite two guests. The Hippodrome show is lovely this year, and anybody would like it, whether children or grown-ups. And we're much obliged to you, Mr. Fairfield."""
"Mona was so laughingly good-natured that Patty's serious face broke into a smile, too. She was annoyed at the idea of being under obligation to Mr. Lansing, but, after all, it was hardly fair to stand in the way of eight people's pleasure. So she surrendered gracefully.""Of course I know it, Patty,"" and Mona smiled, complacently. ""But I made you do it, didn't I? I knew I should in the end, but your father helped me unexpectedly, by offering a second box. Now, Pattikins, you may as well stop disliking Mr. Lansing. He's my friend, and he's going to stay my friend. He may have some faults, but everybody has.""""He mayn't be your sort, but he's mine; and I like him because I like him! That's the only reason that anybody likes anybody. You think nobody's any good unless they have all sorts of aristocratic ancestry! Like that Van Reypen man who's always dangling after you.""""Mona, I'd like to shake you! I might just as well reason with the Rock of Gibraltar as to try to influence _you_. Don't you know that your father asked me to try to persuade you to drop that Lansing man?""""Oh, daddy!"" said Mona, carelessly. ""He talks to me by the hour, and I just laugh at him and drum tunes on his dear old bald head. He hasn't anything, really, against Mr. Lansing, you know; it's nothing but prejudice.""""Well, I don't know what you call it, if not that. But I don't mind. Go ahead, if it amuses you. But I'm sorry if my affairs make trouble between you and your friends. However, I don't believe Mr. Van Reypen will stay angry at you very long. And as for Roger,--well, I wouldn't worry about him. Of course, you're going to Elise's dance on Tuesday night?""Mona was right in her opinion. At Elise's dance on Tuesday night, almost the first man Patty saw, as she entered the drawing-room, was Philip Van Reypen. He greeted her pleasantly, but with a certain reserve quite different from his usual eager cordiality."
"Quick-witted Patty chose just the tone that she knew would irritate him. ""Certainly, Mr. Van Reypen,"" she said, carelessly, and as she handed him her card, she turned to smile at another man who was just coming to speak to her. When Philip handed back her card, she took it without looking at it, or at him, and handed it to Mr. Drayton, seemingly greatly interested in what dances he might select.""What _can_ I do with so many suitors?"" she cried, raising her hands in pretty bewilderment, as her card was passed from one to another. ""Don't take all the dances, please; I want to save some for my special favourites.""Patty's mind worked quickly. She had no intention of giving Roger three dances, but she saw that he and Mona were not yet on speaking terms. So she nodded assent, as he scribbled his initials in three places, thinking to herself that before the evening was over, two of them should be transferred to Mona's card.Patty was looking lovely in pale blue chiffon with tiny French rosebuds of pink satin adorning it here and there. Her golden hair was clustered in becoming puffs and curls, tucked into a little net of gold mesh, with coquettish bunches of rosebuds above each ear.But, though Patty was pretty and wore lovely clothes, her chief charm was her happy, smiling face and her gay, good-natured friendliness. She smiled on everybody, not with a set smile of society, but in a frank, happy enjoyment of the good time she was having, and appreciation of the good time that everybody else helped her to have.""You are all so kind to me,"" she was saying to Robert Kenton, who had just come in; ""and I want to thank you, Mr. Kenton, for the beautiful flowers you sent. I do love valley lilies, they're so--so----""""Oh, yes, of _course_ I do!"" And Patty put on an exaggeratedly soulful look. ""I'm _that_ sentimental you wouldn't believe! But I forget the language of flowers. What do lilies of the valley mean,--especially with orchids in the middle of the bunch?""""It's a little too complicated for me to think it out now,"" and Patty smiled at him, roguishly. ""Besides, here are more suitors approaching; so if you'll please give me back my card, Mr. Kenton,--though I don't believe there's room for another one.""""Oh, I never arrange those in advance,"" said Patty. ""My partners take their chances on those. But I'll give you half of this dance,"" and she calmly cut in two the one dance against which Philip Van Reypen had set his aristocratic initials.Then the dancing began, and what with the fine music, the perfect floor, and usually good partners, Patty enjoyed herself thoroughly. She loved dancing, and being accomplished in all sorts of fancy dances, could learn any new or intricate steps in a moment.After a few dances she found herself whirling about the room with Roger, and she determined to carry out her plan of reconciling him and Mona. Mr. Lansing was not at the dance, for Elise had positively declined to invite him; and so, though Mona was there, she was rather cool to Elise, and favoured Roger only with a distant bow as a greeting.""I don't like his manners, either; but I tell you honestly, Roger, you're going about it the wrong way. I know Mona awfully well,--better than you do. And she's proud-spirited, and even a little contrary, and if you act as you do toward her, you simply throw her into the arms of that objectionable-mannered man!"""
"""Well, of course, I don't mean literally, but if you won't speak to her at all, on account of Mr. Lansing, why of course she's going to feel just piqued enough to smile on him all the more. Can't you understand that?""""And awfully good to his mother, let us hope,"" and Roger smiled, a little sourly. ""Now, Patty girl, you'd better keep your pretty little fingers out of this pie. It isn't like you to interfere in other people's affairs, and I'd rather you wouldn't.""If Eugene Everson was surprised at the summons, he did not show it, but advanced courteously, and took a seat by Patty's side. He had a dance engaged with her much later in the evening, so Patty said, pleasantly:""Yes, I know,"" and Patty favoured him with one of her most bewitching smiles; ""but the lady is Miss Galbraith, as I happen to know, and Miss Galbraith is a very dear friend of mine, and,--oh, well, it's a matter of 'first aid to the injured.' I don't want to tell you all about it, Mr. Everson, but the truth is, I want Miss Galbraith to dance this number with another man,--because,--because----""It was not quite so easy as Patty had anticipated. She didn't want to go so far as to explain the real situation, and she became suddenly aware that she was somewhat embarrassed. Her face flushed rosy pink, and she cast an appealing glance from her violet-blue eyes into the amused face of the man beside her.""I haven't an idea of what it is all about, Miss Fairfield, but please consider me entirely at the orders of yourself and Miss Galbraith. A man at a party is at best but a puppet to dance at the bidding of any fair lady. And what better fortune could I ask than to be allowed to obey your decree?""Patty was greatly relieved when he took the matter thus lightly. In whimsical conversation she was on her own ground, and she responded gaily: ""Let it remain a mystery, then; and obey as a noble knight a lady's decree. Dance with me, and trust it to me that Miss Galbraith is also obeying a decree of mine.""The music had been playing for some moments, and signifying her assent, Patty rose, and they joined the dancers who were circling the floor. Mr. Everson was a fine dancer, but he was all unprepared for Patty's exquisite perfection in the art.Having done all she could in the matter of conciliating Mona and Roger, Patty bethought herself of her own little tiff with Philip Van Reypen. It did not bother her much, for she had little doubt that she could soon cajole him back to friendship, and she assured herself that if she couldn't, she didn't care.""Then there's no use going on with it,"" and releasing her, Philip tucked one of her hands through his arm, and calmly marched her into the conservatory. The seat under the palms was vacant, and as she took her place in one corner of it, he poked one or two cushions deftly behind her back and made her entirely comfortable. Then he sat down beside her.""Now, look here, Philip Van Reypen, I've already exhausted myself this evening patching up one spoiled friendship, and it's just about worn me out! Now if ours needs any patching up, you'll have to do it yourself. I shan't raise a finger toward it!""Patty leaned back among her pillows, looking lovely and provoking. She tried to scowl at him, but her dimples broke through the scowl and turned it into a smile. Whereupon, she dropped her eyes, and tried to assume a look of bored indifference."
"Van Reypen looked at her. ""So she won't raise a finger, won't she? And I've got to do it myself, have I? Well, then, I suppose I'll have to raise her finger for her."" Patty's hand was lying idly in her lap, and he picked up her slender pink forefinger slowly, and with an abstracted air. ""I don't know how raising a finger helps to patch up a spoiled friendship,"" he went on, as if to himself, ""but she seems to think it does, and so, of course, it does! Well, now, mademoiselle, your finger is raised,--is our quarrel all patched up?""""You needn't, little girl,"" and Philip's voice rang true. ""Nothing can _ever_ shake it! And I apologise for my foolish anger. If you want to affect the society of men I don't like,--of course I've no right to say a word, and I won't. At any rate, not now, for I don't want to spoil this blessed making-up with even a thought of anything unpleasant.""""All the girls are,"" she returned, carelessly, which, however, was not quite true. ""But I'll tell you what I will do. I'll give you half of number sixteen. That's Mr. Everson's, but I'll divide it. I told him I should.""""Hear the man talk!"" exclaimed Patty. ""Why, I do believe they're beginning an extra now! Mr. Van Reypen, won't you dance it with me?"" Patty jumped up and stood before him, lightly swaying in time to the music.Philip sat looking at her, entranced by the pretty vision; and even before he could rise, Kenneth Harper came to Patty, and obeying a sudden coquettish impulse, she put her hand lightly on Kenneth's shoulder and they danced away.""What a transparent child she is,"" he thought to himself. ""Her pretty little coquetries are like the gambols of a kitten. Now, she thinks I'm going to be annoyed at losing this dance with her. Well,--I am,--but I don't propose to quarrel with her about it.""""Oh, you goose! _do_ go on! What have you stolen? A pin from Elise's pin cushion,--or some powder from her puff-box? Another dab on your nose would greatly improve your appearance,--if you ask me! It's as red as a beet!"""
"""I'll forgive you _anything_, if you'll tell me what's the matter, and convince me that you haven't lost your mind. Now, Christine, don't you _dare_ ask me to forgive you again, until you tell me _what for_!""""Well, stop it, right now! Mr. Hepworth is lovely; he's one of the best friends I ever had, and if I have any claim on his interest or affection, I'm only too glad to hand it over to you. Now, brace up, powder your nose, and come down to supper. And you needn't think you can keep this thing secret! I won't tell,--but your two faces will give it away at once. Don't blame _me_ if people guess it!""When the two girls came downstairs, smiling, and with their arms about each other, Mr. Hepworth went to meet them, and drew Christine's arm through his own with an unmistakable air of proprietorship. Christine's blushes, and Patty's smiles, confirmed Hepworth's attitude, and a shout of understanding went up from their group of intimates. Patty was singing softly to herself, as she fluttered around her boudoir at a rather late hour the next morning. Robed in a soft blue silk négligée, with her golden curls tucked into a little lace breakfast cap, she now paused to take a sip of chocolate or a bit of a roll from her breakfast tray, then danced over to the window to look out, or back to her desk to look up her calendar of engagements for the day.Patty flew across the room and greeted her stepmother with an affectionate squeeze, and then flew back and dropped comfortably on the couch, tucking one foot under her, and thereby dropping off a little blue silk boudoir slipper as she did so.""Yes, isn't it great! and oh, Nan, what _do_ you think? Christine was all broken up,--crying in fact,--because,--did you ever know anything so ridiculous?--because she thought she was taking him away from me!""""Of course he did! And of course he _does!_--You speak as if he were dead!--and I think a great deal of him, and I think a heap of Christine, and I think they are perfectly suited to each other, and I think it's all just lovely! Don't you?""""Good gracious, Nan, if you mean was I in love with him, I sure was _not!_ Little girls like me don't fall in love with elderly gentlemen; and this particular little girl isn't falling in love anyway. Why, Nan, I'm only just out, and I do perfectly adore being out! I want three or four years of good, solid outness before I even think of falling in love with anybody. Of course I shall marry eventually, and be a beautiful, lovely housekeeper, just exactly like you. But, if you remember, my lady, you were some few years older than nineteen when you married my revered father.""""I'm jolly glad, too; and father was in luck when he got you. But you're not going to be rid of me yet for a long time, I can tell you that much. Well, more things happened last night. Philip and I made up our quarrel,--which wasn't much of a quarrel anyway,--and Roger and Mona are pretty much at peace again; though, if Mona keeps on with that Lansing idiot, Roger won't stand it much longer. And I'm going to the opera to-night in the Van Reypen box, and I'm going skating to-morrow,--oh, there's the mail!""""Quite a bunch for you, Nansome,"" and Patty tossed a lot of letters in Nan's lap. ""And a whole lot of beautiful, fat envelopes for me. 'Most all invitations, as you can see at a glance. Two or three requests for charity,--they show on the outside, too. A few bills, a few circulars and advertisements, and all the rest invitations. Isn't it gorgeous, Nan, to be invited to such heaps of things?"""
"Having weeded out the more interesting looking letters, Patty returned to her sofa, and curled up there with both feet under her, looking like a very pretty and very civilised little Turk. With a slender paper cutter she slashed all the envelopes, and then went through them one by one, making running comments of delight or indifference as she read the various contents.""Oh, Nan, it's _too_ gorgeous!"" And Patty's eyes ran through the letter again. ""You know Adèle Kenerley, who was down at Mona's last summer,--well, she and Jim have bought a place at Fern Falls,--wherever that may be,--somewhere up in Connecticut,--in the Berkshires, you know. Heavenly in summer, dunno what it'll be in winter. But all the same that's where the house party is, Christmas,--stay two or three weeks,--all our crowd,--oh, Nan! isn't it beatific!""Patty bounded to her feet, and gathering up the sides of her accordion-pleated gown, she executed a triumphant dance about the room, winding up by kicking her little blue silk slipper straight over Nan's head.""Not much of a compliment to my skilful ballet dancing,"" and Patty flung herself into the cushions again. ""But, Nan, you don't understand; everybody's going! Elise and Mona and the boys, and oh, gracious, _do_ show some enthusiasm!""""Good-bye."" And Patty hung up the receiver. ""She's coming over here, Nan; there's so much to plan for, you know. Do help me, won't you? A regular Christmas tree, and all that, you know; and presents for everybody, and a dance at the country club, and I don't know what all.""""Now, Mona Galbraith, you stop that! Adèle has a lovely party made up, and you're not going to spoil it by even so much as a reference to that man! Roger will be there for Christmas, and if that isn't enough for you, you can stay home!""""No, she can't. She's going South next week with her mother, and I doubt if Philip Van Reypen will go. His aunt won't want him to leave her at the holidays. Do you know, I'm a little sorry Daisy Dow is up there.""The days simply flew by as Christmas drew nearer. There was so much to do socially, and then there were the Happy Saturday Afternoons to be planned and carried out, and the Christmas shopping to be done.She undertook to dress a huge doll for baby May. Nan helped her with this or she never could have finished the elaborate wardrobe. She selected a beautiful doll, of goodly size, but not big enough to be cumbersome to little two-year-old arms. With her knack for dressmaking and her taste for colour, she made half a dozen dainty and beautiful frocks, and also little coats and hats, and all the various accessories of a doll's outfit."
"She bought a handsome opera bag for Mona and a similar one for Daisy Dow, that there might be no rivalry there. She bought a few handsome and worth-while books for the men who would be at the party, and attractive trinkets for the house servants.Of course, in addition to these, she had to prepare a great many gifts for her New York friends, as well as for her own family and many of her relatives. But both Patty and Nan enjoyed shopping, and went about it with method and common sense.Patty looked thoughtful. ""I don't think it's that, Nan; at least, not entirely. I think it's more common sense, and not being fussy. Now, I give lots of presents that cost very little; and then, of course, I give a lot of expensive ones, too. But it's just as easy to buy the cheap ones, if not easier. You just make up your mind what you want to spend for a certain present, and then you buy the nicest thing you see for that amount. It's when people fuss and bother, and can't make up their minds among half a dozen different things, that they get worried and bothered about Christmas. I do believe most of their trouble comes from lack of decision, which is only another way of saying that they haven't common sense or even common gumption!""Nan flashed a smile at Patty, entirely unmoved by this criticism; for she knew that she was vacillating and sometimes undecided, as compared to Patty's quick-witted grasp of a subject and instantaneous decision.""Have I told you,"" said Patty, ""what we're going to do next Saturday afternoon? I do think it's going to be lovely. And I do hope it won't make the girls mad, but I don't think it will. You know, Nan, what an awful lot of things we all get every Christmas that we don't want and can't use, although they're awfully pretty and nice. We just lay them away in cupboards, and there they stay. Well, on Saturday, we're going to take a lot of these things and give them to people.""""Yes; it isn't the least bit _charity_, you see. Why, one of the people I'm going to give things to, is Christine. With her work, and being engaged and all, she hasn't any time to make things, or even to go shopping, and she can't afford to buy much, anyway. So I'm going to give her one or two beautiful silk bags that were given to me two or three years ago. They're perfectly fresh, never been out of their boxes. And I'm going to give her one or two beautiful, fine handkerchiefs in boxes, and two or three lovely books, and two or three pieces of bric-a-brac, and a Japanese ivory carving. Don't you see, Nan, she can give these to her friends for Christmas, and it will save her a lot of trouble and expense. And dear knows, _I_ don't want them! My rooms are chock-a-block with just such things, now. And I know she won't feel offended, when I tell her about it straightforwardly.""""The girls thought at first that maybe it might not work, but I talked them around and now they're all in for it. I'm going to take some things to Mrs. Greene. I've quite a lot for her, and I'll tell her she can give them all away, or keep some herself, just as she likes. And I've things for Rosy, that freckled-faced boy, you know. I have games and picture-puzzles and books that I used to have myself. Of course they're all perfectly new. I wouldn't give anything that had been used at all. And we're going Saturday afternoon to take these things around. Mona has lovely things, and so has Elise. You see, we get so many Christmas and birthday presents, and card party prizes, and such things, and I do think it's sensible to make use of them for somebody's pleasure instead of sticking them away in dark cupboards. And, Nan, what do you think?--with each lot of things we're going to give a dozen sheets of white tissue paper and a bolt of holly ribbon and some little tags so they can fix up real Christmassy presents to give away."""
"""It does seem funny,"" said Patty, that same afternoon, ""to be tying up these things almost two weeks ahead of time. But with all the newspapers and magazines urging you to do your shopping early, and send off your parcels early, you can't really do otherwise.""""I'm sick and tired of holly ribbon and red ribbon,"" she said, as she deftly tied up her parcels. ""So, this year, I'm using white satin ribbon and gilt cord. It's an awfully pretty combination, and these little green and gilt tags are lovely, don't you think?""Her audience, which consisted of Elise and Mona, were watching her work with admiration. They had offered to help, but after an ineffectual attempt to meet Patty's idea of how a box should be tied up, they abandoned the effort, and sat watching her nimble fingers fly.""Yes, I do,"" declared Patty, stoutly. ""This kind of stuff can be picked up in a jiffy, and then the room is all in order. This is temporary, you see. By untidiness, I mean dirt and dust, and bureau drawers in a mess, and desks in disorder."" Christmas would be on Wednesday, and it was arranged that Patty and Mona should go up to Fern Falls on Monday. Roger and Philip Van Reypen were to go up on Tuesday for the Christmas Eve celebration; and the rest of the house-party were already at the Kenerleys'.""We hoped for snow,"" he said, as he cordially greeted the befurred young women who stepped off the train at the little station. ""So much more Christmassy, you know. But, at any rate, we have cold, clear weather, and that's something. Hop in, now. Adèle didn't come to meet you,--sent all kinds of excuses, which I've forgotten, but she can tell you herself, when we reach the house. Here, I'll sit between you, and keep you from shaking around and perhaps spilling out.""Cheery Jim Kenerley bustled them into the tonneau, looked after their luggage, and then, taking his own place, drew up the fur robes snugly, and the chauffeur started off. It was a four-mile spin to the house, for the village itself was distant from the station, and the Kenerleys' house a mile or so beyond.It was cold, but the girls were warmly wrapped up and didn't a bit mind the clear, frosty air, though in an open car. ""Didn't bring the limousine,"" Mr. Kenerley rattled on. ""Can't abide to be shut up in a stuffy glass house, and then, you know, people who ride in glass houses mustn't throw stones.""The name was not inapt, for Mr. Ferris showed a round, chubby face, with big, dancing black eyes and ringlets of dark hair clustered on his brow. Only his enormous size prevented his appearance being positively infantile, and his round, dimpled face was as good-natured as that of a laughing baby.He looked approvingly from Patty's flower face to Mona's glowing beauty, and truly it would have been hard to find two more attractive looking girls. The sudden transition from the cold out-of-doors to the warmth of the blazing fire had flushed their cheeks and brightened their eyes, and the hearty welcome they received brought smiles of delight to their faces.""Oh, I know what you'll do,"" said Chub, in an aggrieved tone. ""You'll just go upstairs and hob-nob and talk and gossip and chatter and babble, and never get down here again! I know girls! Why, first thing I know, you'll be having your tea sent up there!"""
"The girls had really no intention of not returning, and it was not much more than the allotted time before Patty and Mona were arrayed in soft, pretty house-dresses and reappeared in the great hall, where tea was already being placed for them.""What a duck of a house!"" exclaimed Patty, as she came down the broad staircase, her soft, rose-coloured chiffon gown shimmering in the firelight. She cuddled up in a corner near the fire, and Hal Ferris brought a cushion to put behind her.""A little shy of men; aren't we, Adèle?"" he said to his sister. ""Even Jim seems to have disappeared. Not that I mind being the only pebble on the beach,--far from it,--but I'm afraid I can't prove entertaining enough for four.""Patty wandered around her room, singing softly, as she dressed. Looking over her dinner gowns, she decided upon her second best, a white marquisette with a garniture of pearl beads and knots of pale blue velvet. When the maid came to assist her she was nearly dressed, and ten minutes before the dinner hour she was quite ready to go downstairs. ""I may as well go on down,"" she thought to herself. ""I can explore the house a little.""There was no one about, so she strolled through the various rooms, admiring the big, pleasant living-room, the cosy library, and then drifted back to the great hall, which was very large, even for a modern country house. It was wainscoted in dark wood, and contained many antique bits of furniture and some fine specimens of old armour and other curios. Jim Kenerley's father had been rather a noted collector, and had left his treasures to his only son. They had chosen this house as being roomy and well-fitted for their belongings.""I beg your pardon,"" he exclaimed. ""I do indeed! I'm almost a stranger to you, I know; I ought to have waited until I know you better to say anything of that sort to you! May I take it back, and then say it to you again after I do know you better?""The articles he had asked for were soon provided, and in the slow, grave way in which he did everything, Mr. Collins began to make the strange animal of which he had spoken. The lemon formed the whole pig, with four matches for his legs, two black pins for his eyes, and a narrow strip of paper, first curled round a match, for his tail. It was neither artistic nor realistic, but it was an exceedingly comical pig, and soon it began to squeak in an astonishingly pig-like voice. Then a tap at the window was heard, and a farmer's gruff voice shouted: ""Have you my pig in there? My little Lemmy pig?""""He'd better stop it!"" came in a deep growl from Jim Kenerley's end of the table, and Patty was surprised at such a speech from her urbane host. Then she realised that that, too, was Mr. Collins speaking.""Yes; I supposed you'd say so! But to-morrow more people are coming, and I'll never see anything of you. Say, how about this? Are you game to get up and go for an early morning skate, just with me, and not let anybody else know?"""
"As Patty stepped out of her room into the hall the next morning, at eight o'clock, she found Hal Ferris already tiptoeing down the stairs. He put his finger to his lip with a great show of secrecy, which made Patty laugh.Patty had on a trim, short skirt of white cloth and a blouse of soft white silk. Over this she wore a scarlet coat, and her golden curls were tucked into a little scarlet skating cap with a saucy, wagging tassel.""I didn't intend to eat anything,"" she said; ""but the coffee smells so good, I think I'll have a cup of it, with a roll."" She smiled at the waitress, who stood ready to attend to her wishes, and Hal took a seat beside her, saying he would have some coffee also.""We won't eat our breakfast now, you know,"" he went on; ""but we'll come back with raging appetites and eat anything we can find. I say, this is jolly cosy, having coffee here together like this! I s'pose you won't come down every morning?""As there was room for them all, Daisy and Mona both accompanied Patty on her trip to the village, and Hal Ferris volunteered to drive the car. But when they reached the country shop, Patty laughingly refused to let any of the party go inside with her, saying that her purchases would be a Christmas secret.She bought a great many yards of the material known as Turkey red, and also a whole piece of white illusion. Some gilt paper completed her list, and she ran back to the car, the shopkeeper following with her bundles. They attended to some errands for Adèle, and then whizzed back to the house just in time to see the Christmas tree being put into place.Adèle referred to a decoration of spun glass, which was thrown all over the tree in cascades, looking almost like the foam of a waterfall. This would not burn, even if the flame of a candle were held to it.The tree was set in the great, high-vaulted hall, and was a noble specimen of an evergreen. Hundreds of electric lights were fastened to its branches; and the thick bayberry candles were placed by means of holders that clasped the tree trunk, and so were held firmly and safe.""No; if Mr. Van Reypen and Mr. Farrington get up from New York without having their trains blocked by snowdrifts, I imagine our Fern Falls people will be able to get here for the dinner and the dance.""The tree had been illuminated; the electric lights were shining and the candles twinkling, when little May came toddling into the hall. She was a dear baby, and her pretty hair lay in soft ringlets all over the little head. Her dainty white frock was short, and she wore little white socks and slippers. She came forward a few steps, and then spied the tree and stood stock still.As a matter of fact, there were no gifts on the tree, only decorations and lights, but Patty took one or two little trinkets from the branches, and put them in the baby's lap. ""There,"" she said. ""How do you like those, baby May?""One by one the little hands took the gifts from their wrappings, and soon the baby herself was almost lost sight of in a helter-skelter collection of dolls and teddy bears and woolly dogs and baa lambs and more dolls. To say nothing of kittens and candies, and balls, and every sort of a toy that was nice and soft and pleasant.Having undone all her treasures, the baby elected to have a general romp with Santa Claus, whom she well knew to be her father. Jim had made no attempt to disguise lest it should frighten the child, and so his own gay young face looked out from a voluminous snow-white wig and long white beard. His costume was the conventional red, belted coat, edged with white fur, and a fur-trimmed red cap with a bobbing tassel."
"After these unwonted exertions, everybody was ready for tea, which was then brought in. As a special dispensation, May was allowed to have her bread and milk at the same time, with the added indulgence of a few little cakes.""Patty take May beddy! _Zes!_"" The finality of this decision was unmistakable. The most casual observer could see that unless it were complied with the scene might lose something of its sunshine and merriment.""Fiddlestrings, Adèle,"" returned Patty; ""this is no time for discipline. The poor baby is about worn out with fatigue and excitement. You know, it has been her busy day. Let's humour her this time. I'll take her away, and I'll return anon.""""Just what I wanted!"" she exclaimed, ""and I don't care if that _is_ what everybody always says, _I_ mean it! I've wanted one a long time. They're so heavenly for party wraps or opera cloaks. Mona has a beauty, but this is handsomer still.""""And I know another thing,"" said Adèle. ""If you girls don't scamper off and dress, you won't be ready for dinner at eight o'clock. And there are lots of guests coming. And more this evening for the country dance. Now, disperse, all of you, and put on your prettiest frocks for Christmas Eve.""Patty had a new gown for the occasion, of an exquisite shade of pink chiffon, which just matched her cheeks. She did up her hair simply, with a pink ribbon around it, and a pink rose tucked over one ear.Dinner was a real Christmas feast. The table was properly decorated with red ribbons and red candles and holly, and everybody had souvenirs and Christmassy sort of trinkets, and everybody was very gay and festive, and an air of Christmas jollity pervaded the atmosphere.The Turkey red she had fashioned into a full-draped cloak, which she adjusted around Hal's broad shoulders. It was trimmed with white fur, and was caught up on one shoulder, toga fashion, with a spray of holly. A massive gilt pasteboard crown she put on his head, and gave him a long wand or sceptre covered with gilt paper and topped with a cap and bells.The garment Fräulein had made for Patty was simply straight, flowing breadths of the white illusion, which fell straight from her shoulders, her pink gown beneath giving it a faint rosy tinge. From her head the illusion rippled in a long veil, floating down behind, and there were long angel sleeves of the same material.But the masterpiece of the costume, and one that did great credit to the ingenuity of Fräulein, was a pair of wings that were fastened to Patty's shoulders. They were made of fine net, covered with fringed tissue paper, which had the effect of soft white feathers."
"Slowly, in time to the music, Patty came down the great staircase. She paused on the landing, which was but a few steps from the bottom, and standing there, motionless as a picture, joined her voice to Adèle's.She sang the beautiful carol, Adèle now singing alto, and the vision of the beautiful Christmas Spirit, and the tones of Patty's exquisite voice, gave the guests assembled in the hall a Christmas memory that they could never forget.They insisted on another song, but Patty shook her head laughingly, and the next moment Adèle played a merry, rollicking march on the piano and the Lord of Misrule came bounding downstairs. He had a long trumpet in his hand, upon which he sounded a few notes, and then waved his sceptre majestically.""And I'm glad to be with a friend again, after all these strangers,"" she said, as they danced away. ""Though they're awfully nice men, and some of them are very good dancers. You and Mona are all right, aren't you, Roger?""""I don't dislike him; at least, not as much as you do. But I don't see any reason for you to take the matter so seriously. At any rate, while you're up here, forget it, won't you, and be good to Mona.""""Very well. Make her decide in your favour. But, mark my words, young man, you'll never win her by getting grumpy and sour just because she smiles on another man. In fact, you'd better praise Mr. Lansing. That would be the best way to make her lose interest in him.""""Oh, women are born with a spirit of contrariness. And, anyway, it's human nature. Now, you jolly Mona up, and stop looking as if you'd lost your last friend,--and then see how the cat jumps. Why, what is Hal Ferris doing?""""As these dramas are necessarily impromptu,"" he said, ""you will please come forward and do your parts as soon as your names are called. Any delay, hesitation, or tardiness will be punished to the full extent of the Law of Misrule. The first play, ladies and gentlemen, will be a realistic representation of the great tragedy of 'Jack and Jill.' It will be acted by Mr. Van Reypen and Miss Fairfield. Ready! Time!""He began intoning the nursery rhyme, and Patty and Philip strolled through the hall, swinging the bucket between them, and acting like two country children going for water. They climbed the stairs, laboriously, as if clambering up a steep hill, and as they went up, Philip hastily whispered to Patty how they were to come down.She understood quickly, and as the second line was drawled out they stood at the top of the stairs. Then when Hal said, ""Jack fell down----"" there was a terrific plunge and Philip tumbled, head over heels, all the way downstairs, with the big copper bucket rolling bumpety-bump down beside him. He was a trained athlete, and knew how to fall without hurting himself, but his mad pitching made it seem entirely an accidental fall. In the screams of laughter, the last line could scarcely be heard, but when Hal said, ""And Jill came tumbling after,"" Patty poised on the top step, leaning over so far that it seemed as if in a moment she must pitch headlong. Her fancy dance training enabled her to hold this precarious position, and as she stood, motionless, a beautiful tableau, everybody applauded."
"""I choose Jim Kenerley,"" said Daisy, suddenly remembering a little trick they used to do in school. A whispered word was enough to recall it to Jim's mind, and in a twinkling he had snatched a gay silk lamp-shade from an electrolier and clapped it on his head, and draped around him a Bagdad couch cover. Then he caught up a big bronze dagger from a writing-table, and he and Daisy went to the staircase landing, which was almost like a stage. Seemingly, Jim was a fearful bandit, dragging a lady, who hung back with moans and cries.On the landing, he brandished the dagger fearsomely, and Daisy knelt before him, begging for mercy. At least, her attitude denoted that, but all she said was: ""A B C D,"" in a low, pleading voice. ""E F G!"" shouted Jim, dancing about in a fierce fury.""My beloved subjects,"" said the Lord of Misrule, ""you are sure some actors! I didn't know I had so much talent concealed about my kingdom. I shall now aim for a higher touch of histrionic art. Let us stop at nothing! Let us give the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet. I will command Miss Galbraith to play the part of Juliet, and if no one volunteers as Romeo, I'll modestly remark that I'm a ripping good actor myself.""""Can't! Won't!"" cried the Lord of Misrule, in stentorian tones. ""Those words are not allowed in this my Court. Ha, maiden, dost desire the dungeon for thine? Dost hanker after prison fare? Fie! Get to thy place and take thy cue.""Mona flung her lace handkerchief on her head for a little Juliet cap, and accepting a large lace scarf which a lady offered her as she passed, and an enormous bunch of roses, which Jim hastily took from a vase and gave her, they all agreed she was perfectly costumed for Juliet.Upstairs she went, and drawing a chair to the railing, looked over at Roger below. He had hastily opened a small cupboard, and caught up a broad black hat of Adèle's, with a long, willowed ostrich plume. He put it on, so that the feather hung straight down his face, and he kept blowing it out of his eyes. Daisy had offered him a gay, flowered chiffon scarf as he passed her, and he tied it round his waist like a sash.Roger then sneaked cautiously upstairs, motioned to Mona to make no sound, picked up various impedimenta, including books, vases, a statuette, and such things as he could find on the hall tables, added a good-sized rug, and then, also picking Mona up in his arms, he stealthily made his way downstairs again, and the elopement was successful.And then, as Christmas Eve was well past, and Christmas Day had begun, the merry guests went away, and the house party congratulated itself all round, wished everybody Merry Christmas, and went away to rest. Christmas morning was as white as the most picturesque imagination could desire. A heavy snow had fallen in the night and lay, sparkling, all over the fields and hills, so that now, in the sunshine, the whole earth seemed powdered with diamonds."
"""Merry Christmas, everybody!"" she cried, as she found the group gathered round the fireplace in the hall. ""Did you ever see such a beautiful day? Not for skating,"" and she smiled at Hal, ""but for snow-balling or coasting or any old kind of fun with snow.""So everybody put on wraps and caps and furs and out they went like a parcel of children to frolic in the snow. Snow-balling was a matter of course, but nobody minded a lump of soft snow, and soon they began to build the snow-man.He turned out to be a marvel of art and architecture, and as his heroic proportions were far too great for anybody's hat or coat, they draped an Indian blanket around him and stuck a Japanese parasol on the top of his head to protect him from the sun.""Want to be pioneer?"" asked Roger of Patty. And ever-ready Patty tucked herself on to a sled, grasped the rope, Roger gave her a push, and she was half-way down the hill before any one knew she had started. The rest followed, and soon the whole party stood laughing at the bottom of the long hill.And she was right. Half-way up the hill, Philip was forced to slow down, and panting and puffing,--for he was a big man,--he turned to look for Patty. She came along, and swung past him with an easy stride, flinging back over her shoulder, ""Take another sprint, and you may catch me yet!""""I'll catch you, no matter how much I have to sprint,"" Philip called after her, but he walked slowly for a few paces. Then, having regained his breath, he strode after her, and rapidly gained upon her progress. Patty looked over her shoulder, saw him coming, and began to run. But running uphill is not an easy task, and Patty's strength began to give out. Philip saw this, and fell back a bit on purpose to give her an advantage. Then as they were very near the top, Patty broke into a desperate run. Philip ran swiftly, overtook her, picked her up in his arms as he passed, and plumped her down into a soft snowbank at the very top of the hill.Philip's face was laughing, but there was a touch of seriousness in his tone that made Patty look up quickly. She found his dark eyes looking straight into her own. She jumped up from her snowbank, saying: ""I want to go down again. Where's a sled?""""It's been here all the time, but you've been so wrapped up in that Van Reypen chap that you had no eyes for anybody else, or anybody else's sled! I'm downright jealous of that man, and I'll be glad when he goes home.""""Well, I know; they do, and they don't mean a thing; it's part of the game, you know. Now, I'll tell you something. I've known Philip Van Reypen ever so much longer than I have you, and yet I like you both exactly the same! And Roger just the same,--and Jim just the same!"""
"They had reached the bottom of the hill before this, and were sitting on the sled, talking. Patty jumped up and clapped her hands. ""That's about the prettiest speech I ever had made to me! It's a beautiful speech! I'm going right straight up the hill and tell it to everybody!""""Off we go!"" said Jim, as he arranged her snugly on the toboggan sled, and took his place in front of her. They had a fine ride down, and Jim insisted on pulling Patty up again. She rode part way, and then decided it was too hard work for him, and jumped off.""I guess you are, Patty. You're strong enough, only you're not as hardy as Daisy and Adèle. I believe our Western girls are heartier than you New Yorkers. By the way, Patty, speaking of the West at large, what made you tell a naughty story this morning?""""Patty, it's none of my business, but you seem to be in earnest in what you say, so I'll tell you that there certainly was in the mail a big blue letter for you, addressed in Bill Farnsworth's handwriting. I wasn't curious, but I couldn't help seeing it; and I know the dear old boy's fist so well, that I was moved to tease you about it.""But when they reached the house, neither Jim nor Patty could find the blue letter. Adèle said she had not seen it, and Patty insisted that no one else should be questioned. Privately, she thought that Hal Ferris had received it by mistake from baby May, and had kept it, because he, too, knew Bill's handwriting, and because,--well, of course, it _was_ foolish, she knew,--but Hal had said he was jealous of any other man, and he might have suppressed or destroyed Bill's card for that reason. She felt sure it was not a letter, but merely a Christmas card. However, she wanted it, but she wanted to ask Hal for it herself, instead of letting the Kenerleys ask him.""Baby can't come to the table. She's too little, and her table manners are informal, to say the least. However, the tradition still holds, so dinner's at two o'clock, and you may as well all go and get dressed, for it's after one, now. There'll be a few extra guests, so you girls will have somebody to dress up for.""So blushing and laughing both, Patty ran upstairs to her own room. Hal had been so frank that she was convinced he knew nothing about the letter, and she began to fear it must have been tossed into the fire, with the many waste papers that were scattered about.""Well, don't mind,"" said Mona, cheerfully. ""You can have mine. It isn't very pretty, and Daisy's isn't either, but I suppose they're the best Bill could find out there in Arizona. Do you want it now, Patty?"""
"""The house is yours,"" said Adèle. ""I reserve no portion of it. From cellar to attic, from drawing-room to kitchen, hide where you will and seek where you like,--if you'll only promise not to wake the baby. She's taking her afternoon nap.""""Of course we will,"" said Philip. ""I'm specially devoted to that baby, and I'll see that her nap isn't disturbed, even if I have to stand sentry at her door. But what larks to have the whole house! I've never played it before but what they wouldn't let you hide in this room or that room. Who'll be It?""""Oh, that's an old-fashioned way to play,"" said Hal. ""Here's a better way. Either all the men hide and the girls find them, or else the other way around; and, anyway, don't you know, whoever finds who, has to be her partner or something.""""Then hurrah for our game of hide and seek,"" Hal exclaimed. ""Jim and Adèle, you must be in it, too. You needn't think you can go as Darby and Joan,--you must take your chances with the rest. If you find each other, all right, but if you find anybody else, that's your fate,--see?""""All right,"" went on the master of ceremonies. ""Now you girls must hide. We'll give you fifteen minutes to tuck yourselves away, and then we're all coming to look for you. As soon as any man finds any girl, he brings her back here to the hall to wait for the others. Now, there's no stipulation, except that you must not go out of the house. Scoot! and remember, in fifteen minutes we'll be after you!""The six girls ran away and made for various parts of the house. The two Misses Crosby, who had come as dinner guests, looked a little surprised at this unusual game, and Patty said to them, kindly: ""You don't mind, do you? You know, you needn't really go with the man who finds you, if you don't want to.""Then she bethought herself that that was one of the most likely places they would look for her, and she was seized with an ambition to baffle the seekers. With a half-formed plan in her mind, she slipped out of a side door of her own room that opened on a small passage leading to the nursery. In the nursery, she found the baby asleep in her crib, and the Fräulein lying down on a couch with a slumber-robe thrown over her, though she was not asleep.Like a flash, Patty's plan formed itself. She whispered to the Fräulein, and with a quick understanding the good-natured German girl took off her rather voluminous frilled cap, with its long muslin streamers, and put it on Patty's head. Then Patty lay down on the couch, with her face toward the wall, and deep buried in the pillows. Fräulein tucked the slumber-robe over her, and then herself disappeared down into the kitchen quarters."
"The two Crosby girls were found first, because not knowing the house well, they had simply gone into hall closets, and stood behind some hanging dresses. They were discovered by Jim Kenerley and Hal; and if the latter was disappointed in his quarry, he gave no sign of it.""No, you were waiting for me, I know,"" said Jim, ironically. ""But never mind, Mona, we'll be partners next time. Hello, Adèle, is that _your_ terrible fate?"" and they all laughed as Adèle and Mr. Hoyt came in together, with cobwebs on their hair and smudges of black on their faces.""Nothing of the sort,"" said Daisy. ""I was out on a kind of little balcony place, that's on top of a bay-window or something,--but I put my hands over the sill inside, so that I could say I was still in the house. Wasn't that fair?""""I saw Phil,"" said Roger, ""standing guard at the nursery door, as he said he would. He let us each go in and look around, on condition that we wouldn't wake the baby. And the baby's nurse was also asleep on the sofa, so I looked around and sneaked out as fast as I could.""Just then Van Reypen came downstairs. ""I've been delayed,"" he said, ""because I held the fort for the baby, until every man-jack of you had been in the nursery. Now I'm going to begin _my search_. Who is there left to find?""""Well, of course she's got to be found,"" said Philip. ""There's no use looking in the obvious places, for Patty's just cute enough to pick out a most unexpected hiding-place. Come on, Roger; you found your girl,--help me with mine.""""Here I go, then."" And Philip ran upstairs three at a time. He went first to the attics, and made a systematic search of every hall, room, and closet. He even peeped into the great tank, as if Patty might have been transformed into a mermaid. Then followed a thorough search of the second story, with all its rambling ells and side corridors; he tiptoed through the nursery, smiling at the sleeping baby and casting a casual glance at the still figure on the couch with the long, white cap-strings falling to the floor.""I think she had one of those contraptions like the Peter Pan fairies,"" he said, ""and flew right out through the roof and up into the sky! But I haven't searched this floor yet. May I go into the dining-room and kitchens, Mrs. Kenerley?""Philip strode through the rooms, looked under the dining-room table and into the sideboard cupboards; on through the butler's pantry, and into the kitchens. Needless to say, he found no Patty, and returned, looking more puzzled than ever."
"""It's clairvoyance,"" said Philip, with a mock air of mystery. ""You see, I know all the places where she _isn't_, so the one place I have in mind must be where she _is_. By the way, Mrs. Kenerley; baby always takes an afternoon nap, doesn't she?""""No,"" said Philip, ""I think fairy tales are much prettier than Mother Goose rhymes. We're going as the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood, and the Fairy Prince. Only, of course, the Sleeping Beauty will be awake for the occasion. Shall I bring up your costume when I return next week, Patty?""""Oh, yes, he will,"" said Patty. ""Those court suits are lovely,--all silver lace and cocked hats! Oh, Philip, do wear one of those! And I'll write to Nan, to get me a costume. What are you going to wear, Mona?""""Nicht, nein, non, no!"" cried Patty, jumping up and brandishing her hair-brush. ""I know perfectly well what your confabs mean,--an hour or more of chattering and giggling! Come in the morning,--I'm going to have my chocolate upstairs to-morrow,--and I'll give you all the information you want. But as for to-night, skip, scoot, scamper, and vamoose, every dear, sweet, pretty little one of you!""""It's no use, Patricia,"" she said, talking to herself in the mirror, as she often did, ""letting those girls keep you up till all hours! You need your beauty sleep, to preserve what small pretence to good looks you have left.""Patty was not really vain of her pretty face, but she well knew that her delicate type of beauty could not stand continuous late hours without showing it, and Patty was not mistaken when she claimed for herself a good share of common sense.""No; Jim said I must tell you to-night. Oh, pshaw, it's nothing, anyway! Only there _was_ a letter for you from Bill Farnsworth, and I took it from May, and kept it for a while, just to tease you. I was going to give it to you to-morrow, anyway; but Jim came and asked me about it, and made _such_ a fuss! Men are so _silly_!""""Why, no, Daisy, it isn't anything much; only you know people _do_ like to have letters that belong to them! But, as you say, it's nothing to make a fuss about. Incidentally, I believe it's a State's prison offence,--or would be if you opened it. You didn't, did you?""Patty grasped the girl by her shoulders, and shook her good-naturedly, while she laughed aloud. ""Daisy, you _do_ beat the dickens! You know that foolish little temper of yours is too silly for anything, and if you'd conquer it you'd be a whole lot nicer girl! You're just as pretty as anybody else, and just as jolly and attractive, but you get a notion that you're slighted when you're _not_; and that makes you ill-tempered and you lose half your charm. Don't you know that if you want people to love you and admire you, you must be sunshiny and pleasant?"""
"""I don't know why I'm so glad,"" she said to herself, her weariness all gone now. ""But I did feel neglected to have Little Billee send the other girls cards, and leave me out. I'd like to see it; I hardly glanced at theirs,--though I remember, they weren't very pretty. I'd like to see Little Billee again, but I don't suppose I ever shall. Well, there are plenty of other nice boys in the world, so it doesn't matter much. All the same, I'd like to see that card. I believe I'll go down and get it. There's always a low light in the hall, and I can feel it between the books.""Patty hesitated for some time, but finally her impatience or curiosity got the better of her, and she softly opened her door and peeped out. There were low lights in the halls, and as she listened over the banister and heard no sounds, Patty began to creep softly down the stairs. Her trailing robe of light blue crêpe de chine was edged with swansdown, and she drew it about her, as she noiselessly tiptoed along in her slippered feet.The hall light shone dimly into the library, through which Patty could see a brighter light in the smoking-room beyond. She listened a moment, but hearing no voices, concluded she could creep into the library, capture her card, and return undiscovered.It was easy to proceed without a sound by stepping softly along the thick rugs, and as Patty knew exactly where the cyclopædias were shelved, she made straight for that bookcase. It was next to the smoking-room doorway, and as Patty reached it, she peeped around the portière to make sure that the next room was unoccupied.But to her surprise, she saw Philip Van Reypen stretched out in a big arm-chair in front of the fire. His eyes were closed, but Patty saw he was not asleep, as he was slowly smoking a cigar. Patty saw him sidewise, and she stood for a second contemplating the handsome profile and the fine physique of the man, who looked especially graceful in his careless and unconscious position.By slow, careful movements, it was easy enough to move the books silently, and at last she discovered the blue envelope, tucked between two of them. She drew it out without a sound,--careful lest the paper should crackle,--and started to retrace her stealthy steps upstairs again, when she saw the hem of the portière move the veriest trifle.He sprang up, and pushing aside the portière, switched on the light, to see Patty sitting on the low, tufted back of the chair, her hair streaming about her shoulders, and her face expressing the utmost fear and horror.His amused calm quieted Patty's nerves, which had really been put on edge by her uncontrollable aversion to mice, and she returned, cheerfully, ""I suppose I shall have to stay up here the rest of my life, unless you can attack and vanquish the fearsome brute.""""I shall not even try,"" said Philip, coolly, as he turned to throw away his cigar, ""because I like to see you sitting up there. However, as there may be danger of another attack from the enemy, and as this chair is almost entirely unoccupied, I shall camp out here at your feet, and keep guard over your safety.""He seated himself on the arm of the same chair, while Patty sat on its low, cushioned back. She drew her blue gown more closely about her, and cast wary glances toward the corner, where the enemy was presumably encamped.""Watch me go,"" said Philip, showing no signs of moving. ""However, if it will set your mind at rest, I'll tell you that it _wasn't_ a mouse. I don't believe they have such things in this well-regulated household.""""Patty, you are the most ridiculous little goose on the face of this earth! Your imagination is something marvellous! Now I'll inform you that the reason that tassel moved, was because I threw a match at it. I aimed for a waste-basket and hit the curtain, but I had no idea that I should find myself so surprised at the result!"""
"Patty dimpled and giggled. ""It _is_ surprising, isn't it?"" she said, feeling much more light-hearted since her fears were relieved regarding the mouse. ""And I'm not sure it's altogether correct, that you and I should be down here alone after midnight.""For some unexplained reason, Patty suddenly felt unwilling to tell what she had come for. Bill's letter was hidden in the folds of her voluminous blue gown, and she couldn't quite bring herself to tell Philip that she came down for that.""I wasn't going to take _all_ the volumes,"" said Patty, demurely, and then she jumped down from her perch. ""I'll just see which one I do want,"" and pretending to read the labels, she deftly slipped her letter back between the volumes, unseen by Van Reypen.""Well, be a swan, then! Be anything you like. But come on, let's make for the dining-room. We'll probably find Jim there, but don't make any noise, or everybody upstairs will think we're burglars and shoot us.""Philip switched off the library light, and taking Patty's hand, led her through the dim hall and into the dining-room. At the end of this room was a wide bay window, which let in a perfect flood of moonlight.The picture from the window was a far sweep of hills, white with snow, and glistening in the moonlight. In the foreground, evergreen trees, laden with snow, stood about like sentinels,--and a big, yellow three-quarter moon was nearing the western horizon.""You're frightened, Patty, that's all; and perhaps I ought not to have spoken just now; but you looked so sweet, in the moonlight, with that wonderful hair of yours curling about your shoulders, that I just couldn't help it.""""Forget it? Why, Patty, what do you mean? I never forget it for a single moment! I was sitting there to-night, dreaming of _you_. I wasn't asleep, you know, I was just thinking about you, and wondering how soon I might tell you my thoughts. You're so young, dear,--I'm half a dozen years older than you are,--but I want you, my little Patty. Mayn't I hope?""""I do like you a whole lot, anyway; but I don't love you and I'm not going to love _anybody_, _ever_! I do think being grown-up is a regular nuisance, and I wish I was a little girl again, with my hair down my back!""""This is ever so much more fun than moonlight,"" said Patty, as she perched herself on a table, there being no chair, and held a partridge wing in one hand and a macaroon in the other. ""Could you find me a glass of milk, Philip?""In the upper corner was a spray of apple blossoms, exquisitely painted; and on the card were some verses, written in a hand that was small and fine, but unmistakably the same as the address on the outside of the envelope. ""My Lady of Delight's a dainty, winsome thing; She's Queen of Summertime, and Princess of the Spring. Her lovely, smiling lips are roses set to rhyme, She has a merry, lilting laugh, like Bluebells all a-chime. The radiance of her smile, the sunshine in her eyes, Is like the Dawn of breaking Day upon the summer skies."
"""With roguish glances bright, all on a Summer Day, My Lady of Delight she stole my heart away; And though I humbly beg and plead with her, alack! My Lady of Delight, she will not give it back. I seem to see her now, with tangled golden curl, With dancing eyes, and smiling lips,--My Apple Blossom Girl! ""Oh, Lady of Delight, I pray you, smile on me; Oh, Lady of Delight, your Knight I fain would be; Oh, Lady of Delight, you set my heart aglow. I only know I love you so, Dear Lady of Delight!""""I wonder if he wrote them himself,"" she mused. ""I don't believe he did; he must have copied them. He knows an awful lot of pretty poetry like that. And yet it doesn't sound like a real poet's poetry, either. And he used to call me Apple Blossom,--such a pretty name. Philip would never think of such a thing as that. I wonder if I like Little Billee better than I do Philip. I wonder if he likes me better. But of course he can't, or he would have written to me in all this time. I haven't seen him since August, and he never wrote a word, except the stiffest kind of a line with those flowers he sent me. I thought he'd forgotten all about me! But I can't think so now,--unless he just came across this poem, and it recalled me to his mind. Well, I came awfully near not getting it! I don't see how Daisy _could_ have been so mean; I don't like that kind of a joke a bit. But of course she thought it was just a printed card, like hers and Mona's. Well, she'll never know it _isn't_,--that's one thing sure!""""At last!"" she said, sitting down on the edge of the bed. ""I thought you'd never wake up! Patty, what do you think? I've been down in the library, and I can't find that card! I'm awfully sorry, truly I am; I'll give you mine if you want it.""""Thank you, Daisy,"" and Patty smiled at the recollection of Mona's similar offer. ""Bill's cards seem to be a drug in the market! But you may keep yours, and also set your mind at rest about mine; for I sneaked downstairs last night in the dark, and fished it out for myself."""
"""It wasn't exactly like yours, and I won't let you see it. You kept it away from me, and now it's my turn to keep it away from you. And by the way, Daisy, that was a mean thing to do, and I don't want you to do anything like that to me again!"" Patty's sweet face showed an unusually stern expression, and her blue eyes looked straight into Daisy's as she spoke.""I know it; and, Daisy, I want you to try not to give way to those 'sudden impulses' when they're mean ones. You have enough good, generous impulses to keep you busy. Now, you mustn't mind if your Aunt Patty lectures you a little bit, because as the teachers always say, 'it's for your own good.' And if you'll please take a chair, instead of sitting all over my feet, I'd like to have my breakfast; for I hear my pretty little Swedish Hedwig bringing it in.""""What _is_ the matter with you, Patty?"" said Adèle. ""You're acting like a harmless lunatic! However, I'm sent to tell you to hop up and get dressed, for one of your admirers below stairs wants you to go for a sleighride with him.""""Patty,"" said her hostess, ""you're a born coquette, and always will be! But your wiles are wasted on me. Save them for your suitors. But, truly, Mr. Van Reypen is going on an errand for me, and he said that he wanted to show you _some_ little attention while he was here, and he guessed he'd let you go along with him in the cutter.""But then another old lady appeared. She was rounder, rosier, plumper, and jollier than the first, and she cried out, heartily: ""Jog along? Well, I reckon not! I jest waited to slip into my shoes,--my feet's awful tender,--and then I come right out here to see what's goin' on. Now, you two young folks come right in, and set a spell. 'Tain't often we get a chance to have comp'ny,--and on chicken pie day, too!""""Well, well, never mind! It'll jest be a nice, smart trip back after dinner. I'm Mrs. Fay, and this is my sister, Miss Wilhelmina Winthrop. She's got a longer name than I have, but I've got a longer head.""They were ushered into the old-fashioned sitting-room, with its Brussels carpet showing huge baskets of flowers; its heterogeneous furniture, some chairs haircloth and black walnut, and others cane-seated, with rep cushions tied on; marble tables, of course; and an old sofa, with well-worn pillows and rugs.""Yep,"" he was saying, ""lost our way; took wrong turning at Big Tree Fork. Brought up, somehow, at Mrs. Fay's. Accepted invitation to dinner,--chicken pie!--Start back immediately after the E in Pie! See? Expect us when we get there. Will accumulate a butter and a egg or two, on our way home. Love to all. Philip."" He concluded his harangue, and turned to Patty."
"The two old ladies were not of the quaint type, nor was their home picturesque. The place and the people were merely old-fashioned, and they were almost primitive in their ways. They were kind-hearted and hospitable, but they were of the rugged New England class that has lost the charm of its Colonial ancestry.The dinner was wholesome and plentiful, but with no variety, and served in the plainest fashion. The chicken pie was delicious, but it had no accompaniments except home-made hot biscuit and coffee with thick, rich, country cream.""I always say,"" said Miss Winthrop, as she settled herself at the table, ""that chicken pie is a whole meal in itself, without any bothersome side-dishes. I say it's meat and drink both; but sister says she just can't enjoy it 'thout she has a cup of coffee alongside of it. Well, I've no objections to the coffee, I'm sure, but I'm free to admit it does seem superfluous. Still, with company so, it ain't so much out of place.""""I'm sorry if we've made you any extra trouble,"" said Patty, giving Miss Winthrop one of her best smiles; ""but _I'm_ free to confess that this is the most wonderful coffee that I've ever tasted, and I think it goes specially well with the pie. And as for these light biscuit, they're just puffs of lusciousness! Aren't they, Philip?""Mrs. Fay beamed with delight at these generous compliments, and said, complacently, ""Yes, they ain't many can make chicken pie like mine, if I do say it. My, ain't it lucky you young people happened along, to-day of all days! And land knows, I don't want you to go away right off. I'd like you to set a spell after dinner. But I feel it my bounden duty to tell you that 'Kiah says there's a storm a-brewin'. But I don't think you need start off before, say, three o'clock, anyway.""""Land's sake!"" and Miss Winthrop turned to look out of the window behind her. ""So it is snowing! And when it begins that way, with fine flakes, slanting crossways, it means business! I dunno as you can hardly dare venture on a twelve-mile ride in the face of this. 'Pears to me it's going to be a blizzard.""""Nonsense, Mina; you do always look on the dark side,"" expostulated her sister. ""Now _I_ think 'tain't nothing but a flurry, and by then dinner is over, it'll be bright sunshine again. Now, have your plates filled up, friends, and try and make out a meal.""Mrs. Fay fairly beamed with hospitality as she urged more viands upon her guests. The table appointments were of the plainest, being thick white china and coarse table napery, with plated silverware. Patty had expected thin little old teaspoons of hall-marked silver, and old blue or perhaps copper-lustre teacups, but this household was not of that sort. Everything seemed to date from the early seventies, and Patty wondered why there were no old Winthrop heirlooms in the family."
"She brought the conversation round to antiques, and Mrs. Fay remarked, decidedly: ""I just can't bear old-fashioned things. I come into quite a lot of old mahogany furniture and pewter and dishes and things when my grandfather died. But when I got married, I had an auction and sold everything. Then I took the money and bought a whole new outfit. I believe in going right along with the times. 'Course those old things were all right for grandfather, but when I married, I'm free to confess, I wanted things that were in style then. So I bought a real tasty outfit, and I've kept it careful, and it's pretty near as good as new now.""""Land, yes! Nearly all my life. Mr. Fay, he's been dead twenty-five years; so sister and me we live here together, as contented as you please. We have a telephone and a rural delivery, so you see it's just the same as if we were right in town. Now, if you really won't eat any more pie, let's go into the sittin'-room a spell.""From the sitting-room windows the view of the storm seemed more serious. The sky was black, the wind was blowing a gale, and the snow-flurry had grown thicker. In fact, it was a hard snowstorm, and Miss Winthrop's fear of a blizzard did not seem entirely unfounded.The young people took it lightly, however. ""There's no use worrying,"" said Patty. ""We ought to be thankful, Philip, that we're under shelter, and with such kind friends. You'll keep us till the storm is over, won't you, Mrs. Fay?""""Don't let that worry you none,"" and Mrs. Fay swung back and forth complacently in her plush patent-rocker. ""We got two spare bedrooms, and I'll just be tickled to death to put you up over night. You're just like a streak of sunshine in the house, Miss Fairfield, and I'm glad to have you as long as you'll stay.""""But never mind the weather, so long as we're together,"" sang Patty with a little trill, as she danced about the room. Then she seated herself at the old, square piano, and began to sing snatches of gay songs.So Patty sang several of her prettiest songs, and the two old ladies were enchanted. Moreover, Eliza, the maid-of-all-work, and 'Kiah, the hired man, appeared in the doorway of the sitting-room and listened too.""Well, that was great!"" exclaimed Mrs. Fay, as Patty rose at last from the piano stool. ""I used to sing some, and he used to sing bass. My, but we had nice times singing together there at that same piano. You two just made me think of it all over again. I think it's awful nice for two to sing together."""
"""Oh, I don't want to hide anything, I'm sure,"" said Philip. But Patty said, ""Don't be foolish, Philip; there's nothing to hide! You're mistaken, Mrs. Fay, if you think we're anything more than friends.""""Oh, land, child, I know what that means! Maybe you ain't ready to say yes yet, but you will soon. Well, it ain't none of my business, but I'm free to confess you are as proper-lookin' a young couple as I'd want to meet; and mighty well suited to each other.""""Well,"" she said, going to the window for the fourteenth time; ""it's perfectly hopeless to think of starting. And it's after four now, and it's blowing great guns and snowing like all possessed! Mrs. Fay, we'll simply have to accept your hospitality for the night. Now I think I'll telephone Adèle that we're stormbound.""""They might if we were nearer. But a motor would get stalled before it could get over here and back again in these drifts. It's an awful storm, Patty, and the sooner you make up your mind that we can't go home to-night, the better for all concerned.""""Land no, child! We ain't old-fashioned folks, you know. We have springs and mattresses just like you do at home. Well, I'm sorry if your folks are worried, but I'm glad to have you young people stay the night. Maybe this evening, you'll sing for us some more.""Once having made up her mind to the inevitable, Patty ceased bothering about it, and proceeded to enjoy herself and to entertain everybody else. She chatted pleasantly with the old lady, she coquetted with Philip, and finally wandered out into the kitchen to make friends with Eliza.""There, there, child; I know you are, and I don't blame you a mite. I am, too, or leastways, I used to be. I've kinder got over it of late years. But I know just how you feel. Now, let me tell you; _honest_, never a mouse dares show the tip of his nose outside the cellar! If you don't go down there, you're as safe as you would be up in a balloon. And I don't count none the less on you for acting skittish about 'em.""But Patty drew her hand away, declaring that Mrs. Fay had quieted her fears entirely, and that if Eliza would promise to keep the cellar door shut, she wouldn't give another thought to the dreaded animals.After supper, the four played a game of old-fashioned whist, which delighted the two old ladies, though it seemed strange to Patty and Philip, who were both good bridge players. Then there was more music, and at ten o'clock Miss Winthrop informed them that it was bedtime."
"""Now, I hope you'll be comfortable,"" she said, ""and I'm sure you will be. Here's my best night-gown for you, and a dressing-gown and slippers. I don't need 'em,--I can get along. And here's a brush and comb. And now, that's everything you want, isn't it?""Patty was touched at the kindliness of the old lady, and though inwardly amused at the meagerness of her night appointments, she said, gratefully, ""You're so kind to me, Miss Winthrop. Truly, I do appreciate it.""When Patty surveyed herself in the mirror, she almost laughed aloud. The night-dress was of thick, unbleached muslin, made with tight bands to button around the neck and wrists. These bands were edged with a row of narrow tatting; and it was this trimming, Patty felt sure, that differentiated Miss Winthrop's best night-gown from her others. Then Patty tried on the dressing-gown, which was of dark grey flannel. This, too, was severely plain, though voluminous in shape; and the slippers were of black felt, and quite large enough for Patty to put both feet in one. She arrayed herself in these things and gave way to silent laughter as she pirouetted across the room. But her amusement at the unattractive garments in no way lessened her real appreciation of the gentle kindliness and hospitality that had been accorded to her.At last she tucked herself into bed, and rolling over on the nubbly mattress and creaky springs, she almost wished that it had been a feather bed. But she was soon asleep, and thought no more about anything until morning.Breakfast was at half-past seven, and after that, the long morning dragged. The fun and novelty had worn off, and Patty was anxious to get back to Fern Falls. She was bright and entertaining as ever, but the spontaneous enthusiasm of the day before had vanished.Patty pouted a little, and then, with a sudden resolution, was her own sunny self again. ""All right, Philip,"" she said, smiling at him. ""I know you'll start as soon as it's possible. When will that be?""""Now, Philip,"" and Patty turned to flash a twinkling smile at him, ""we have a twelve-mile drive ahead of us, besides gathering the eggs. Now, if you're going to say things like that to me all that twelve miles, I'm going to jump right out into this snowbank and stay there till somebody comes along and picks me up.""""But they _are_ cold. If you don't believe it, I will wait while you try one. But, Patty, anyway, tell me this. If I stop teasing you now, will you give me an answer when I come back at New Year's? You know, I must take that five-thirty train this afternoon, and I shan't see you again till next week. Will you give me an answer then?"""
"""No, I don't want Daisy's answer, I want yours. Now, you think it over through the week, and when I come up next Tuesday, you be ready to say, 'Yes, Philip, you may hope, and some day I'll make your hope come true.'""Philip was forced to be content with this, for Patty suddenly changed the subject, and began to chatter merry nonsense that afforded no opportunity for romance. The roads were only a little broken, and the going was hard, because of occasional big drifts, but along some wind-swept stretches they made fairly good time.""All right,"" returned Patty. ""I'll put it up to Adèle that we just couldn't do it; and I'll tell you what, Philip, we'll go right to the station, and you take the train there without going to the Kenerleys' at all. They'll send your things down to-morrow.""""At Barclay Inn; and we're in an awful hurry. Philip is going to take the five-thirty from the station, and you send somebody there to meet me and drive the horses home, will you! And what did I miss? And _you'll_ miss the butter and eggs, because we didn't get them.""The roads were much better where they were travelling now, and they reached the station in time for Philip's train. But it was a close connection, for the train was already in the station, and as Philip swung aboard, he saw Martin and Hal Ferris coming in another sleigh.""Well, you _did_ cut up a pretty trick!"" exclaimed Hal Ferris, as he came up to her. ""Now, you jump in here with me, and I'll drive you home, and let Martin look after your horses. They must be pretty well done up. I would have brought a motor, but the sleighing's fine, and the motoring isn't. Hop in.""Patty wondered to herself why she felt as if something awful had happened. She couldn't realise that Bill had been there, and had gone away, and she hadn't seen him! What a cruel coincidence that it should have been just at the time when she was away. But her pride came to her rescue. She had no intention of letting Hal Ferris or anybody else know that she cared.""Yes, I know; but of course nobody could help it. He came East on a flying business trip. Tried to get here for Christmas, but couldn't make it. He waited over a day, just to skip up here and back; said he wanted to see us all. But he had to take the two o'clock back to New York to-day, and I believe he starts to-night for Arizona. He's a great fellow, Bill is. You like him, don't you, Patty?"""
"""I've known him for years, you know. Giant Greatheart, we used to call him. So big and good, you know. Always doing something for somebody, and generous as he can be. Well, he's making good out in the mines. I don't know exactly what he's doing, but he's in a fair way to be a rich man. He's connected with some big company, and he's working with all his might. And when you say that about Big Bill Farnsworth, it means a good deal.""The gilt-framed glass gave back a lovely picture. The costume was one of the prettiest Patty had ever worn, and was exceedingly becoming. There was a short, quilted skirt of white satin and a panniered overdress of gay, flowered silk, caught up with blue bows. A little laced bodice and white chemisette completed the dress. Then there was a broad-leafed shepherdess hat, trimmed with flowers, and under this Patty's gold curls were bunched up on either side and tied with blue ribbons. She wore high-heeled, buckled slippers, and carried a long, white crook, trimmed with blossoms and fluttering ribbons.She pranced and turned in front of the mirror, decidedly satisfied with the whole effect. Then she caught up her basket of flowers, which she carried because it added a pretty touch, and went downstairs.It was a gay-looking party that waited for her in the hall. The two Misses Crosby had been there to dinner, and also Mr. Hoyt and Mr. Collins, and these, with the house party, were now all arrayed in their fancy dress. As they had agreed on Christmas Day, they were all in pairs, and as of course there could be no secrecy among them, they had not yet put on their masks.Mona and Roger were very magnificent as Queen Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh. Though Mona was not at all the type of the red-haired queen, she looked very handsome in the regal robes and great, flaring collar, while Roger was a veritable courtier in his picturesque garb.Perhaps, however, it was Philip Van Reypen whose costume received the greatest applause. He had copied a picture of Bobby Shafto that had been painted by a frivolous-minded artist, and his embroidered and belaced coat of light blue silk was remindful of the period of the gayest Louis. He wore white satin knee-breeches, white silk stockings, and black slippers with enormous buckles. In accordance with the song, there were large silver buckles at his knees; and his tri-corne hat was a very marvel of gold lace and feathers. Full lace ruffles flapped at his throat and wrists, and altogether he was an absolute dandy.And then everybody admired everybody else until it was time to start. Then each put on a little mask, which they were to wear at the ball until supper-time. Patty's was of light blue silk with a short fall of lace, and Philip's was of black satin.""Well, put it on just before you get there,"" enjoined Adèle. ""I've taken great care that no one should know a word about our costumes, and now if we are well masked they won't be able to guess who we are. Even though they know we all came from our house, there are so many of us, they can't tell us apart."""
"The Country Club was a handsome, spacious building, well away from the outskirts of the town. But the motors took them there swiftly, and soon they joined the large party of maskers in the Club ballroom. There were perhaps a hundred people there, and Patty felt there was little risk of being recognised. She did not know many of the Fern Falls people, anyway, and they would scarcely know her in her disguise.But after that dance was over, Patty was besieged by would-be partners. Historical characters, foreigners, clowns, monks, and knights in armour begged for dances with Little Bo-Peep. Patty was so engrossed in looking at these wonderful personages, that she scarcely noticed who put their names on her card. And in truth it made little difference, as none of the men put their real names, and she hadn't the slightest idea who they were.""Good gracious!"" cried Patty, horrified. ""I'm nothing of the sort! I'm a simple-minded little country girl, and I dance because I can't help it. I love to dance, but I must say that a monk's robe on one's partner is a little troublesome. I think all the time I'm going to trip on it.""""Well, he's awfully picturesque,"" said Patty, quite undisturbed by her ignorance of the play, and looking admiringly at Lear's magnificent court robes of velvet and ermine, and his long, flowing white hair and beard, and the garland of flowers that lay loosely on the glistening white wig and trailed down behind.With another courtly bow, King Lear still seemed to insist on his wish, and he took up her card, which she had tied to her crook by a narrow ribbon. With surprise he saw the whole second page blank, and pointed to it with an accusing gesture.""Ah, yes,"" returned Patty, smiling, ""but those are for my friends after I know them. We unmask at supper-time, and then I shall use some discrimination in bestowing my dances. If you want one of those you must ask me for it after supper.""King Lear bowed submissively to Patty's decree, and was about to move away, when a sudden thought struck him. He picked up Patty's card again, and indicated a space between the last dance and the supper.""Oh, I know what you mean,"" cried Patty. ""You mean an 'extra.' But I don't think they'll have any. And, anyway, I never engage for extras. If they do have one, and you happen to be around, I'll give it to you;--that's all I can say."" And then Patty's next partner came, and she danced away with him, leaving King Lear making his sweeping, impressive bows.""Patty, I do believe you're fishing! And I _know_ you're talking nonsense! Dignified isn't just the term I should apply to you,--but if there's anybody more graceful than you are, I've yet to see her."""
"""Oh, Roger, that's dear of you. You know very well, I hate flattery or compliments, but when a real friend says a nice thing it does me good. And, truly, it's the regret of my life, that I'm not about six inches taller. There, look at Zenobia now. She's walking with that King Lear. Aren't they a stunning couple?""""Oh, to settle affairs of state."" He led her to the gymnasium, and sure enough, tall palms and flowering plants had been arranged to form little nooks and bowers, which were evidently intended for tête-à-tête conversations.""Yes, you _did_ promise, you exasperating little Rose, you! And I'm going to keep you prisoner here, until you make it good! Patty, you said you'd look into your heart, and tell me what you found there.""""As it was only half a promise, then it means only half a dance,"" said Patty, turning her laughing blue eyes to the majestic, flower-crowned King. ""Is there going to be an extra, Jim,--I mean Chief Mudjokivis, or whatever your Indian name is?""At his intent gaze, Patty felt almost frightened, but as her eyes met his own, she became conscious of something familiar in the blue eyes that looked at her, and then she heard King Lear whisper, softly: ""Apple Blossom!""""Of course I am,"" and Patty had regained her gay demeanour, which she had lost in her moment of intense surprise. ""Oh, of course I am! I was so sorry to have missed you last week. And Jim said you went back to Arizona.""""I did expect to, but I was detained in New York, and only this morning I found I could run up here and stay till to-morrow. I couldn't get here earlier, and when I reached the house, you had all started. So I got into these togs, and came along.""Farnsworth looked down on her as he removed his own mask. ""Apple Blossom!"" he exclaimed again, and the comparison was very apt, for the pink and white of Patty's face was just the color of the blossoms.As each offered an arm at once, Patty accepted both, and walked out demurely between the two big men. The men were exceedingly polite and courteous, but each was annoyed at the other's presence. As a matter of fact, Farnsworth had chanced to overhear a few words that Philip said to Patty a short time before. It was by merest chance that King Lear and Zenobia had walked by just as Philip was asking Patty to give him more than friendship. Zenobia, uninterested in the two under the palms, didn't even hear the words; but Farnsworth, who had found out from Jim Kenerley all the members of the house party, had scarcely taken his eyes from Little Bo-Peep since he arrived at the ball. With no intention of eavesdropping, he had followed her about, hoping to get a chance to see her first alone. He managed this only with Kenerley's help, and meantime he had discovered that Van Reypen was very seriously interested in Little Bo-Peep."
"Big Bill was in the merriest of spirits. He greeted everybody heartily, he joked and laughed, and was at his most entertaining best. Patty was very proud of him, for without his mask he looked very handsome as King Lear, and his stalwart figure seemed to dwarf the other men.Patty looked at him, thoughtfully. ""We'd have a better dance if you took off that flapping robe. But then, of course, you'd have to take off your wigs and things, and you wouldn't be half so beautiful.""""I know I haven't, Patty, and I apologise. I can't seem to get over my Western bluntness. And, Little Girl, I don't blame you a bit if you do care for him. He's a good-looking chap, and an all-round good man.""""Daisy said that, did she?"" Patty rarely lost her temper, but this unwarranted speech of Daisy Dow's made her exceedingly angry. But what hurt her even more, was that Bill should believe Daisy's assertion, and should take it so calmly. His attitude piqued Patty; and she said, coldly: ""Well, if Daisy says so, it must be so.""""I know it, Little Girl,"" and Farnsworth's voice was very tender. ""He can give you everything that you ought to have,--wealth, social position, and a life of luxury and pleasure. Moreover, he is a thorough gentleman and a true man. I hope you will be very happy with him, Patty.""For some reason this speech exasperated Patty beyond all measure. It seemed as if her friends were settling her affairs for her, without giving her any voice in the decision. ""You are a little premature, Bill,"" she said, without a smile. ""I'm not engaged to Mr. Van Reypen, and I do not know that I shall be.""""No, Patty, I am not implying anything of the sort. I only know that you are too young yet to be engaged to anybody, and I wish for your own sake you would wait,--at least until you are perfectly sure of your own affections. But if they are given to Mr. Van Reypen, I shall be glad for you that you have chosen so wisely.""Patty looked at Farnsworth in amazement. Remembering what he had said to her last summer, it was strange to hear him talk this way. She could not know that the honest, big-hearted fellow was breaking his own heart at the thought of losing her; but that he unselfishly felt that Van Reypen, as a man of the world, was more fitting for pretty Patty than himself. He knew he was Western, and different from Patty's friends and associates, and he was so lacking in egotism or in self-conceit that he couldn't recognise his own sterling merits. And, too, though he was interested in some mining projects, they had not yet materialised, and he did not yet know whether the near future would bring him great wealth, or exactly the reverse of fortune."
"But Patty couldn't read his heart, and she was disappointed and piqued at his manner and words. Without even a glance into his earnest eyes, she said: ""Thank you, Bill, for your advice; I know it is well meant, and I appreciate it. Please take me back to Philip now.""Soon afterward, the ball was over, and they all went home. As Patty came from the cloak room, wrapped in her fur coat, Philip stepped up to her in such a possessive way, that Farnsworth, who had also been waiting for her, turned aside.A few days later Patty was back in New York. She gave her father and Nan glowing accounts of the delightful times she had had at Fern Falls and the jollities of a country house party in the winter time. She told them all about the pleasant people she had met up there, about her experience at Mrs. Fay's, and about Farnsworth's flying visits.""But now,"" said Mr. Fairfield, ""if I may have the floor for a minute, I'd like to make an announcement. We have a plan, Patty, which we made while you were away, and which I hope will meet with your approval.""""She's not a very sedate matron,"" said Nan, laughing. ""I dare say she'll keep you on the go, Patty. She's fond of opera and concerts, and she likes gaiety. But father will come over for the week-ends, and look after you both.""Nan's parents lived in Philadelphia, and as they had just returned from a trip abroad, the Fairfields hadn't seen them lately. But it had seemed to them that the arrangement they had planned would be satisfactory all round, for Mrs. Allen liked to spend a few weeks in New York each winter.""Now, you mustn't let me be a burden to you in any way, my dear,"" Mrs. Allen said, after the two were left alone. ""Whenever I can help you, or whenever you want a chaperon, I'm entirely at your service; but when I'm not necessary to your plans, don't consider me at all,--and don't think about entertaining me, for I can look after myself. I'm never lonely or bored.""""Thank you, Mrs. Allen,"" said Patty. ""I'm sure we shall get on most beautifully together, and anything you want or want to do, I want you to give your own orders, just as if you were in your own home.""And so the two had many pleasant times together. They went to matinées, teas, and concerts, to picture exhibitions, and to card parties. Mrs. Allen did not care for dances, but went gladly when it was a party where Patty required a chaperon.""I like that big Western chap,"" Mrs. Allen said to Patty one day; ""but he seems preoccupied. Sometimes he sits as if in a brown study, and says nothing for quite some minutes. And then, when you speak to him, he answers abruptly, as if bringing his mind back from faraway thoughts.""""I know what you mean, and I suppose it's the effect of the aristocratic Van Reypen ancestry. But Mr. Farnsworth has such a splendid big air of real nobility about him that I think a more formal and conventional demeanour would quite spoil him.""""I know you think my farewells never mean anything,"" he said, smiling; ""and I don't wonder, for I often say I am going, and then a telegram obliges me to change my plan. But I think it is positive this time that I shall leave to-night for Arizona."""
"But she couldn't bear to do that. It seemed too dreadful to tell Roger what had happened. She thought next of Kenneth, who was a standby as a loyal friend, but he was far downtown in his office, and might be busy with an important case.""Philip, of course,"" she said to herself; but even with her hand on the receiver, another thought flashed through her mind. ""No one could help me to save Mona like Big Bill!"" she thought, and on a sudden impulse she called up his hotel.The kind, quiet voice, with its deep tones of sympathy and capability, made Patty realise that she had appealed to the right one. ""Oh, Bill,"" she went on, ""there's awful trouble, and you must help me.""Bill hung up the receiver, without even a good-bye, and Patty gave a little sigh of relief, for it seemed as if he had taken the responsibility from her shoulders, and would manage the matter himself. She ordered her car, flung on her hat and coat, and with a hasty word to Mrs. Allen that she was going out, she drove her little electric herself down to the hotel.""It's true,"" he said, looking at her with a grave face. ""That is, I think it must be. Mona went away half an hour ago, and took a suit case with her. She went in a motor with Mr. Lansing. Anne is worried, because this morning she overheard the two telephoning.""Patty hesitated. She had always thought it little less than a crime to read a note addressed to another, but the circumstances made this case seem an exception. ""We might telephone to Mr. Galbraith and ask his permission,"" she suggested.""No!"" he declared, ""_I'll_ take the responsibility of this thing. To telephone would frighten Mr. Galbraith, and would delay matters too much, beside. I shall read this note, and if I can't square my action with Mr. Galbraith afterward, I'll accept the consequences.""In it, as they had feared, Mona told her father that she was going away to marry Mr. Lansing, because her father would not allow her to marry him otherwise. She expressed regret at the sorrow she knew this would bring to her father, but she said she was old enough to decide for herself whom she wished to marry, and she felt sure that after it was over he would forgive her, and call his two children back to him.""Yes, I do! And I ought to have warned Mona more against him. I did tell her what his real nature is, but she wouldn't listen, and I never dreamed she was so deeply infatuated with him. But we mustn't blame her, Patty. She was simply under the influence of that man, and he persuaded her to go with him against her better judgment. But we must go after them and bring them back."""
"""Not unless we rescue Mona first! Why, Patty, she _mustn't_ be allowed to marry that man! I tell you he's a scoundrel, and I never say _that_ about a man unless I _know_ it to be true. But this is no time to discuss Lansing. We must simply fly after them.""""Right-O!"" and after some rather troublesome telephoning, Bill announced, ""They did! they got a license, and they started in a motor for Greenwich about half an hour ago! Come on, Patty! Anne, you stay right here, in case we telephone. If Mr. Galbraith comes home, don't tell him a word about it. Leave it to me. I'll be responsible for this note."" Bill put the note in his pocket, and almost pushing Patty out of the door, he had her in the elevator and downstairs almost before she knew it.""Now if you want to talk you may,"" said Bill, and his voice was quiet and composed, though he was alertly threading his swift way through the traffic. ""I had to be a little short with you while we were hurrying off, because I didn't want to lose a minute. But now, all I have to do is to keep just inside the speed limit while we're in the city, and then I rather guess there'll be one big chase!""""No, they won't,"" said Patty, positively; ""not unless they think they're pursued, and of course they've no idea of that. Speed her up, Bill; the way is clear now! I don't believe they're going at this pace.""It didn't seem as if they could go any faster, but they did, and if it had been anybody driving except Farnsworth, Patty would have felt frightened. But she knew his skill, and too, she knew that he never let excitement or enthusiasm run away with his judgment. So she sat as still as she could, striving to catch her breath in the face of the wind; and refraining from speech, lest she distract Bill's attention even for a second.""It's no use, Patty; we can't catch them! I've done all I can, but that car they're in is a world-beater! They went through Greenwich like a streak. They would have been arrested, but no one could stop them. Oh, I say, My Little Girl,--I have an idea!""""_Will_ they be speeding? You _bet_ they will! And even if they aren't, they'll be arrested, all the same, and held without bail until we get there! Oh, Patty, if the situation were not so serious, I could laugh at this joke on Lansing!"""
"Horace Lansing was in a violent fit of temper, and was alternating bribes with threats of vengeance, but the policemen were imperturbable, having been told the facts of the case by Farnsworth over the telephone.Mona was weeping bitterly, and though Patty went to her with affectionate words, she stormed back, ""Go away, Patty Fairfield! You have no right to interfere in my affairs! It was your prying that found this out. Go away; I won't speak to you!""But Farnsworth strode over to the speaker, and spoke to him, sternly but quietly. ""Lansing,"" he said, ""it's all up, and you know it! Now, I don't want to have a scene here and now, so you have my permission to go away wherever you like, on condition that you never enter the presence again, of Miss Galbraith or Miss Fairfield.""""Ho!"" said Lansing, with an attempt at bravado. ""You give me your permission, do you? Let me tell you that Miss Galbraith is my promised wife. We have the license, and we're about to be married. It will take more than you to stop us!""""Indeed,"" said Farnsworth, and putting his hands in his pockets, he gave Lansing a contemptuous glance. ""Well, then, I shall have to request assistance. If I tell this constable a good reason why he should detain you long enough to prevent your marriage to Miss Galbraith, would such an argument have any weight with you?""There was an instantaneous change in Horace Lansing's demeanour. From a blustering braggart, he became a pale and cringing coward. But with a desperate attempt to bluff it out, he exclaimed, ""What do you mean?"" but even as he spoke, he shivered and staggered backward, as if dreading a blow.""Since you ask me,"" said Farnsworth, looking at him, sternly, ""I'll answer frankly, that unless you consent to go away and never again enter the presence of these ladies, I shall inform these policemen of a certain little bank trouble that happened in Chicago----""It was unnecessary to go on. Lansing was abject, and begged in pleading tones that Farnsworth would say no more. ""I am going,"" Lansing stammered, and without a word of farewell to Mona or even a glance at Patty, he walked rapidly away.""No, Mona, you don't love him."" Bill spoke very gently, and as he laid his hand on Mona's shoulder, she raised her eyes to look into his kind, serious face. ""You were not much to blame, Mona; the man fascinated you, and you thought the foolish infatuation you felt for him was love. But it wasn't, and you'll soon forget him. You don't want to remember a man who was a wrong-doer, I'm sure; nor do you want to remember a man who goes away and deserts you because he has been found out. Mona, is not his going away as he did, enough proof of his guilt?"""
"""Now, it's up to you, Patty,"" said Farnsworth, cheerily. ""You and Mona get into the tonneau of this Galbraith car, and I'll drive you home. You chirk her up, Patty, and tell her there's no harm done, and that all her friends love her just the same. And tell her if she'll stop her crying and calm herself before she gets home, nobody need ever know a thing about this whole affair.""""No, Mona dear,"" said Patty. ""Sit here by me and I'll tell you all about it. How we read the note and kept it, and everything. And, Mona, we won't even let Roger know anything about all this, because it would hurt him very much.""""It's a justifiable deception, Mona,"" said Bill, ""for I know how it would grieve the poor man if he knew about your foolish little escapade,--which is all over now. It's past history, and the incident is closed forever. Don't you be afraid Lansing will ever appear against you. He's too thoroughly frightened ever to be seen in these parts again.""Farnsworth hesitated a moment, then he said, decidedly, ""No, Patty, I can't do it. I was to take the seven o'clock train to-night, but though I'll miss that, I can take the nine o'clock, and I _must_ go.""Christine had demurred, for she wanted a simple ceremony with no reception at all. But the Fairfields finally made her see that Mr. Hepworth's position as an artist of high repute made it desirable that his many friends should be invited to his wedding.The day of the wedding, Patty, assisted by Elise and Mona, was superintending the decorations. Christine had insisted that these should be simple, and as Mr. Hepworth, too, was opposed to the conventional work of a florist, the girls had directed it all themselves.""It does look perfectly sweet,"" said Patty, as she surveyed the drawing-room. ""Personally, I should prefer all those dinky white telegraph poles stretched with ribbon and bunched up with flowers to make an aisle for the happy couple to walk through. But as it isn't my wedding, I suppose we must let the bride have her own way.""""She has lots of friends of her own, too,"" said Patty. ""All the girls gave her beautiful things, and you two quite outdid yourselves. That lamp of yours, Mona, is a perfect dream; and, Elise, I never saw such gems as your silver candlesticks. Christine's path through life will be well lighted! Well, everything's finished, and I think it's about time we went to dress. The ceremony's at four, and as I'm going to be a bridesmaid for the first time in my mad career, I don't want to be late at the party.""""Yes, Patty, that's the privilege of a bride. But some day you can have your own way in the direction of your own wedding, and I rather fancy it will be an elaborate affair. I hope I'll be here to see."""
"""Oh, Mrs. Allen,"" said Patty; ""suitors doesn't mean men who want to marry you. I suppose it's sort of slang, but nowadays, girls call all their young men suitors, even the merest casual acquaintances.""""So do all my suitors,"" said Patty, complacently. ""They're awful ground worshippers, the whole lot of them! But so long as they don't worship me, they may adore the ground as much as they like. Now, you people must excuse me, for I'm going to get into that flummery bridesmaid's frock,--and I can tell you, though it looks so simple, it's fearfully and wonderfully made.""""You _sweet_ thing!"" cried Patty, flinging her arms round her friend's neck. ""Christine dear, you know I'm not much good at sentimental expressions, but I _do_ want to wish you such a heap of joy that you'll just almost break down under it!""""Oh, Christine!"" said Patty, ""I _do_ want him, something dreadful! I shall just _pine_ away the rest of my sad life because I can't have him! But you wrested him from me, and I give him to you with my blessing!"" And then Patty went away, and Christine smiled, knowing that Patty's words were merely jesting, and knowing too, with a heart full of content, that Gilbert Hepworth really wanted _her_, and not the radiant, mischievous Patty.Promptly at four o'clock, the old, well-known music sounded forth, and Patty came slowly downstairs. Her gown was of white chiffon, over pink chiffon, and fell in soft, shimmering draperies, that looked like classic simplicity, but were in reality rather complicated. Christine had designed both their gowns, and they were marvels of beauty. On Patty's head was perched a coquettish little cap of the style most approved for bridesmaids, and she carried a clustered spray of pink roses. As she entered the drawing-room, intent on walking correctly in time to the music, she chanced to glance up, and saw Bill Farnsworth's blue eyes fixed upon her. Unthinkingly, she gave him a radiant smile, and then, with the pink in her cheeks deepened a little, she went on her way toward the group of palms, where the wedding party would stand.Not even the bride herself looked prettier than Patty; though Christine was very sweet, in her soft white chiffon, her misty veil, and her shower bouquet of white flowers, which she had expressly requested should be without ribbons.Only the more intimate friends had been invited to the ceremony, but immediately after, the house was filled with the reception guests. Patty was in gay spirits, which was not at all unusual for that young woman. She fluttered about everywhere, like a big pink butterfly, but ever and again hovering back to Christine, to caress her, and, as she expressed it, ""To keep up her drooping spirits."" Christine had never entirely overcome her natural shyness, and being the centre of attraction on this occasion greatly embarrassed her, and she was glad of Patty's gay nonsense to distract attention from herself.Kenneth Harper was best man, and, as he told Patty, the responsibility of the whole affair rested on himself and her. ""We're really of far greater importance than the bride and groom,"" he said; ""and they depend on us for everything. Have you the confetti all ready, Patty?""""No; my duties are ended when I once get them packed into a motor at the door. But Christine looks as if she couldn't survive much longer, and as for old Gilbert, he's as absent-minded as the conventional bridegroom."""
"""Christine's all right,"" said Patty. ""I'm going to take her off, now, to get into her travelling clothes. Oh, Ken, she has the loveliest suit! Sort of a taupe colour, you know, and the dearest hat----""""Patty! Do you suppose I care what she's going to wear away? But _do_ see to it that she's ready on time! You girls will all get to weeping,--that's the way they always do,--and you'll spin out your farewells so that they'll lose their train! Run along with Christine, now; Hepworth is fidgeting like the dickens.""""Here's your coat, Christine,--put your arms in, do! Now the other one. Now sit down, and I'll put your hat on for you. Oh, Mrs. Hepworth, _do_ hold your head still! Here, stick this pin in yourself, or I may jab it through your brain,--though I must confess you act as if you hadn't any! or if you have, it's addled. And Ken says that husband of yours is acting just the same way. My! it's lucky you two infants had a capable and clever bridesmaid and best man to get you off! There! take your gloves,--no, don't hold them like that! put them on. Wake up, Christine; remember, the show isn't over yet. You've got to go downstairs, and be showered with confetti, and, oh, Christine, _don't_ forget to throw your bouquet!""""Nonsense! of course you will! You've simply _got_ to! I'm not going to run this whole wedding, and then have the prima donna balk in the last act. Now, listen, Christine, you throw it over the banister just as you start downstairs! Will you?""""Well, you can't, Christine; it isn't done! You'll have to direct your sentimentality in some other direction. Or, here, I'll give you a flower out of it, and that's plenty for you to keep for a souvenir of this happy occasion."""
"""First and foremost, because I tell you to! and, incidentally, because it's the custom. You know, whoever catches it will be married inside of a year. Now, I'm going on down, and then you come along with Nan, and I expect you'll find Mr. Hepworth down there somewhere,--if Ken hasn't lost him.""Patty cast a final critical glance at Christine, and seeing that she was all right in every respect, she gave her one last kiss, and hurried downstairs. She found a group of laughing young people standing in the hall, all provided with confetti, and the girls all looking upward to watch for the descending bouquet.""There, _now_ she's going to toss it! _Quick_, Patty, catch it!"" Big Bill whispered in her ear, and Patty looked upward. Then, seeing the direction in which the flowers fell,--for Christine really tossed them straight at her,--Patty whirled round and sprang aside, so that the bouquet was picked up by a girl who stood next to her.""Come, come, Patty,"" he cried. ""Let them make their getaway! I think they've missed the train as it is. There, now, they're off! My, a best man's lot is not a happy one! But our trials are over now, Patty girl, and we can take a little rest! Let's go back and receive the congratulations of the audience on our good work.""""Yes, I _am_ very busy just now. Indeed, matters are rapidly coming to a crisis. It was only because I suddenly found that I must be in Boston to-morrow, that I could stop here to-day. And if matters turn out to-morrow as I hope they will, I must start back immediately to Arizona. But some day I hope to be less hurried, and then----""""Bear,"" interrupted Patty. ""You _are_ like a big bear, Bill! But such a nice, gruff, kind, woolly bear,--and the best friend a girl ever had. But I wish you'd be more of a chum, Little Billee. I like to be good chums with every one of my suitors! It's all very well for Christine to marry; she doesn't care for society, she just only loves Mr. Hepworth.""Patty, with her beauty and frank good nature, and Marjorie full of vitality and good spirits, are two lovable characters well worth knowing, and their adventures will stir the eager imaginations of young readers."
