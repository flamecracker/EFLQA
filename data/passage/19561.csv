passage
"""You never are, Mollie Billette!"" exclaimed Grace Ford, as, with three companions, she hurried to the window of the library of the Billette home, and looked out toward the street, up which was coming a luxurious touring car of the latest model.""I don't see why,"" spoke Mollie, as the car, in charge of a demonstrator, came to a stop in front of her house. ""I've taken enough lessons, the garage man says; I have my license, and why shouldn't I run my car? Are you afraid to come with me?""""No--no, it isn't exactly that,"" said Amy, slowly as she fastened the strings of her new motoring hood--all the girls had them, and very becoming they were. ""It isn't exactly that, Mollie, but you know----""""If you weren't afraid to go with Betty in her motor boat, I don't see why you should be afraid to come with me in the car,"" went on Mollie. ""Oh, what did I do with my goggles?"" she asked as she hurriedly looked about the room, lifting up a pile of books and papers on a table. ""I know I had them, and----""""Look!"" exclaimed Betty Nelson with a laugh. ""Dodo and Paul are trying to pull them apart. I suppose they think the goggles are big enough for two,"" and she pointed to where the twins, Mollie's little brother and sister, were seated on the velvety lawn, both having hold of a new pair of auto goggles, and gravely trying to separate the two eye pieces.Dodo arose, and backed away, limping slightly, for she was not quite recovered from a recent operation as the result of a peculiar accident. She held the goggles out of reach, and, walking with her eyes fixed on her sister, she was in danger of stumbling.""The little rascals,"" laughed Mollie. ""I wish I dared rush at her and take them away. But she might fall----"" and with the recollection of what little Dodo had suffered, Mollie gave up her plan of action. The chauffeur tooted on the auto horn, as much as to say:""Well, I like the way you speak!"" exclaimed Mollie, rather sharply--Mollie had a failing in her quick temper. ""If you girls are afraid to come in my new car, just because I'm going to steer all alone, why----""""Grace, have you any?"" asked Mollie, beseechingly. ""We _must_ get started, and the day is so fine we don't want to miss any of it. Paul--Dodo--don't you dare break my glasses!"" She shook a warning finger at them.""I just _happen_ to have some chocolates,"" said Grace, with an air of injured dignity. From the pocket of her sweater she produced a small box, and held it out to Dodo. The child, with a glad cry, dropped the goggles on the grass and sprang for Grace. Paul, too, joined in the race, and while Mollie picked up her recovered property the twins, with a new matter to contend about, gravely sat down on the lawn, and proceeded to divide the candy."
"""You should have thrown the candy in her mouth--not in her face,"" laughed Betty, and then Grace smiled instead of frowning, and the four chums--the Outdoor Girls, as they had come to be called from living so much in the open--walked across the lawn to the waiting car.""It certainly is a beauty!"" declared Grace, as her eyes, and those of her friends, took in all the details of the auto. ""Mollie, you are a lucky girl, and so is Betty with her motor boat. Amy, I wonder what good fortune is coming to us?""Carefully Mollie threw out the clutch, and slipped in first speed. Then releasing the clutch pedal gradually she felt the car move slowly forward. A flush of pleasure came to her face; for, though she had several times performed this feat of late, the demonstrator had always sat beside her. Now she was doing it alone.""I don't want more than my half of the road,"" good-naturedly called the farmer who was driving the horse-drawn vehicle. ""If all motorists were as generous as you there'd be no complaints,"" and he smiled and lifted his cap.""Well, you see, when poor papa died,"" explained Mollie, as she put on a little more speed, ""he provided in his will that on my seventeenth birthday I should have a certain sum of money to use just as I pleased--within reason, of course.""He didn't say what it was for, but he had suggested that I take a trip to Europe. But I want to do that later, when I can better appreciate what I see, so I asked mamma if I couldn't use the money for a car, and she allowed me to. The result--you now behold,"" and she patted the steering wheel.""I don't mind you there,"" said Mollie, with a sigh of relief. ""Oh, but isn't this lovely!"" and she inhaled deeply of the flower-scented air. There had been a shower the night before, and the roads were in excellent condition. Mollie had had the car about two weeks, and had taken several lessons in driving. As the chauffeur had said, she had proved an apt pupil, and now, being fully qualified, as her license stated, to run it alone, she had, on this first occasion, invited her friends for a run.For several miles the girls rode along, enjoying to the utmost the swift, silent and easy motion, and drinking in the sweet air. They admired the views, too, for though they had been out with Mollie when she was taking her lessons, they had been so much occupied with watching her attempts to steer, and listening to the man's instructions, that they had not fully appreciated the beauty of the country through which they passed. And the country about Deepdale was beautiful.""That's a nice way,"" said Grace. ""Here, Mollie, open your mouth,"" and, as her chum did so, Grace inserted a chocolate, for Mollie had not yet enough confidence to take her hands from the steering wheel, except to shift gears, with the right.They were going along a well-shaded road now, the big maples on either side meeting in an arch of green overhead. Some of the branches were so low that care had to be taken in passing under them, as Mollie had the top of the car up for protection.The white object--large and fluttering--toppled from the tree, almost in front of the car, and with a little scream of fear Mollie gave the steering wheel such a sudden twist that the auto swerved and nearly upset. Across the road it shot on two wheels, and crashed into the bushes and briars that lined the highway."
"Instinctively Mollie jammed on the brake, and threw out the clutch, the next instant shutting off the power, but so suddenly did she stop in the excess of her zeal that Grace and Amy were thrown from their seats, and Betty had to put out her hands to avoid hitting the wind shield. Mollie was the first to recover herself. Her position at the steering wheel had given her an advantage, in that she had something to hold to, and so was not tossed about as were her chums when the auto came to such a sudden stop.""Stop it!"" commanded Betty, getting control of her nerves, and then taking the situation in hand, as she so often did. ""No one is hurt, and the car doesn't appear to be damaged, unless the stopping of the motor indicates that.""Leaving the auto where it was, half-way through a patch of briars and brambles, the four girls approached the quiet figure lying under the tree. They looked up and down the road in case help would be needed, but not a person or vehicle was in sight.""Oh--oh! I'm--I'm afraid to--look,"" spoke Mollie, shrinking back, as Betty bent over the figure of the strange girl. The latter's eyes were closed, and her loosened hair was in a mass about her head--even tossed as it was the girls could see there was a wonderful wealth of it. Betty gently pushed aside the locks from the forehead, and, as she did so she started back. Then bravely repressing her feelings she said:""You've just _got_ to run it,"" declared Betty, firmly, ""even if it only crawls. Now if we can find some water to bathe her head we can tell how badly she is hurt. Girls, look for a spring. One of you bring me a lap robe.""Thus Betty issued her orders, and while the girls are preparing to lend aid to the injured stranger I will take a moment of your time--my new readers--to explain briefly some facts about the characters of this story.In the first book, entitled, ""The Outdoor Girls of Deepdale; Or, Camping and Tramping for Fun and Health,"" I told how Mollie, Betty, Amy and Grace, four girls of Deepdale, a town in the heart of New York State, organized a little club for camping and tramping. They went on a tour of about two hundred miles, stopping at night with friends or relatives, and on that tramp they solved a queer mystery having to do with a five hundred dollar bill--solved it very much to the satisfaction of a certain young man.In the second volume, called ""The Outdoor Girls at Rainbow Lake; Or, the Stirring Cruise of the Motor Boat _Gem_,"" I related what good times the girls had when Betty's uncle gave her a fine gasoline craft. Stirring times the girls had, too, when there was danger from a burning hay barge; and jolly times when they took part in races and went to dances. That Mollie's little sister Dodo was in distress because of a peculiar accident, which involved Grace, and caused the loss of valuable papers, detracted somewhat from the happiness of the girls for a time.But in the end a ""ghost"" led to the finding of the missing documents, and Dodo was cured, so that all came out right. Then had followed more delightful times cruising and camping, and now, with the advent of fall, and Mollie's touring car, more glorious times were in prospect. The girls had not been long back from Rainbow Lake when Mollie received her auto.I might mention that Betty Nelson was the daughter of a wealthy carpet manufacturer, with a large plant near Deepdale, while Mollie Billette was one of three children, her mother being a widow. Little Paul and Dodo I have already mentioned. Grace--the ""Gibson girl,"" as she was often called, had a peculiar longing for sweets, and not being stinted as to pocket money--her father being a wealthy lawyer--she indulged her taste rather too much, so some of her friends thought.There was a mystery about poor Amy Stonington, for the details of which I must refer my readers to the first book. Sufficient to say that since a baby she had been cared for by her uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. John Stonington. Amy had lived in the West, and had been rescued from a great flood when an infant. What became of her parents, or her brothers or sisters--if she had any--no one seemed able to say. In a way this mystery embittered Amy's life, but she was of too sweet and good a disposition to allow it to make a difference with her friends."
"The four girls had been chums since grammar school days, being now High School students. In addition to the ""inseparables,"" as they were often called, my former readers will recall Will Ford, the brother of Grace; his chum, Frank Haley, and another friend, Allen Washburn, now a young lawyer, with whom Betty--but there, why should I give away Betty's little secret?Quite in contrast to these boys was Percy Falconer, a rather foppish lad, who greatly admired Betty--as who did not? But as for Percy--Betty did not care for him in the least. She was too fine a character to permit herself to be really angry at him, but Betty and Percy never could get along well.""Dear Deepdale,"" as the girls alliteratively referred to it, was a charming country town, nestling in a bend of the Argono River, which, some miles below the village, widened out into Rainbow Lake. It was on this lake that the girls had cruised, and had such fun, and Betty's boat was now docked in the new house constructed for it near Mollie's home. The girls lived within short distance of one another, and were continually visiting, or calling back and forth. Where you found one you would find the others, and their parents used to say they never knew when to expect their daughters home to meals--for they were like one family in respect to dining out.""That ought not to make her unconscious,"" said Betty. ""More likely she has some additional injury; possibly a blow on some other part of her head. Girls, did you ever see such glorious hair!"" Betty caressed it. Truly there was a mass of it, and it was of beautiful silkness and softness. It was still partly bound up, but the autoists could easily tell that it must reach almost to the ground when the girl stood up.""I am almost sure you did not,"" spoke Betty, positively. ""As she started to fall you steered out. She just toppled to the ground. See, there is not a mark of dust on her dress, as there would be if the tires had struck her.""""But her dress isn't torn or much disarranged. No, Mollie, the auto never struck her, of that I'm sure. But possibly she fell on her head, and the blow and shock stunned her. Oh, we must get her to a doctor!Betty used more water, and succeeded in getting some between the pale lips of the girl, but to no purpose. She was limp and half senseless, though she continued to moan and talk incoherently. Then the four girls picked her up and carried her toward the stalled automobile.Mollie took her place at the wheel, pressed the starting button, and then, with a glance backward to see which way to steer, she slipped in the reverse gear, and let the clutch come into place. Slowly, amid a tearing away of vines and bushes, the car regained the highway.""Good!"" cried Grace. ""Now, how shall we put her in, Betty?"" for the ""Little Captain,"" as she was often called (as Mollie was called ""Billy"") was generally looked to for advice in emergencies like these."
"""Getting her to a doctor would not make up for any injury caused by a jolt,"" said practical Betty. ""Besides, I do not think she can be seriously hurt. Her hair is so very thick that she could stand a very hard blow on the head. There are no other signs of injuries; but of course there may be internal hurts. She did not fall far, those branches were very close to the ground.""Mollie had brought her car to a stop, and alighted to help lift in the unconscious girl. Between them Amy and Grace held her in the tonneau, her head resting on Amy's shoulder, a damp handkerchief covering the cut to keep any dirt from getting in it. Mollie again took her place at the steering wheel, and when Betty had gotten in the girls started off with their strange passenger.""This is better than a dozen lessons in the art of managing an auto,"" commented Betty. ""Practical problems are what count--not theoretical ones. Does she seem all right, Grace?"" and she looked around at the unconscious girl.""Of course! Bring the poor dear in!"" the woman directed. ""The men folks are over in the far meadow salting the cows, or I'd send one of them for Dr. Brown. He's most likely to be home too, now. He lives down the road a piece--about a mile.""The girl seemed to have again sunk into a stupor, as they carried her in, and placed her on a comfortable lounge. Then the woman of the house brought out a bottle of camphor, of generous size, and it was held to the nostrils of the unconscious one.""Suppose we go out and let her be by herself; we can't do anything more,"" suggested the woman. ""Besides, she needs all the air she can get. That's always best for fainting folks. She may come to by herself, I'll open the window and shutters,"" and she proceeded to do so. Then coming out, and closing the door, they left the strange girl alone, Betty and Amy taking turns telling how the affair had happened.""Dr. Brown is real good,"" was the woman's opinion. ""He cured my rheumatism, and Hetty Blake--she lives over on the Melford road--she had jaundice something terrible--she was as yellow as saffron tea, and he brought her around when old Dr. Wakefield give her up. Yes, Dr. Brown is right smart.""""Yes,"" went on Betty, taking up the story, ""didn't Mollie tell you that? She really fell from a tree as our auto passed, and at first we thought we had struck her."" Betty shot a glance of inquiry at Mollie."
"""No, no!"" said Dr. Brown somewhat sharply, ""you misunderstand me. I never accept a fee in a simple accident case. What I meant about there being no patient was that she has evidently gone away, possibly in a delirium, and in that case we had better search for her, for she may be badly hurt, or do herself some injury. You say she was in this room?""""Then the only other possible solution is that she got out of the window,"" went on the physician, ""for there is no other door from the room. We must look outside,"" and he crossed the apartment to the casement. It had been raised, and the shutters were open when the unconscious girl had been left alone.""And see!"" added Betty, standing beside the physician, ""here are some of her long hairs,"" and she picked some from the window sill. ""Oh, she did have the longest, most glorious hair!"" and Betty sighed in memory, for Betty loved long tresses and her own, while they became her wonderfully well, were not very luxuriant.""She may have regained consciousness,"" spoke Dr. Brown; ""or, as I said, she may have wandered off in a delirium. In that case we must try to find her. Again, she may not have been as badly hurt as you supposed, and also she may have simulated an injury hoping she would get a chance to escape unobserved. Was there anything strange about her?""""Yes, there was,"" admitted Betty, slowly, and she gave the details of the accident, how, most unexpectedly the girl had toppled from the tree, the subsequent swerving of the auto, and how, several times, the girl had murmured something about not going back to a certain man.""Very good, we will search there, and we may be able to trace her footprints. Please do not any of you walk under the window, nor in a line from it until we have made some observations. We will play a little detective game,"" and he smiled frankly at the girls.But if he had hoped anything from the clue of the footprints he was doomed to disappointment for, though there were plain indications where the girl had landed when she jumped from the window, the marks were soon lost sight of on the harder ground a short distance from the house.A search of the barn revealed no trace of her, and one of the farm hands, coming to the house a little later, joined in the search. He reported that there had been seen no hatless, injured--or apparently injured--girl crossing the fields.""I should not blame myself if I were you,"" said the physician, kindly. ""It was evidently not your fault. You did all you could for the girl. If she did not want further treatment that is her lookout. Of course, if she wandered away in a delirium, that is another story, and perhaps it would be well to search down the road. She did not pass us, or we would have seen her, coming from my office along the main highway as we did,"" he said to Mollie. ""A search in the opposite direction would be the only feasible thing to conduct."""
"Mrs. Meckelburn refused an invitation to go in the car, but the four girls started off, Dr. Brown at the wheel. They went as far back as the tree which was the scene of the accident and saw no trace of the girl. Nor had any of several other autoists, or drivers of horse vehicles, to whom they appealed, seen her.""I will attend to that for you,"" responded Dr. Brown, kindly. ""There is no need for you to be mixed up in this. Sometimes, with the best intentions in the world, one gets unpleasant notoriety in these cases. I will notify the authorities to be on the lookout for the girl, for her own sake alone. Later, if there is need of you----""""Such a fine car as this ought to make anyone feel fine! It is a beauty!"" and he seemed to caress the steering wheel. ""I am getting a small runabout,"" he went on, ""and that is how I happen to know how to drive. I learned some time ago.""They flashed past Mrs. Meckelburn's house, calling to her of their failure, and saying that they would be back soon. A little later, having left the physician at his home, they were again in the pleasant farm house, sipping tea which their hostess had thoughtfully made.Grace strolled into the room where the girl had been, and half idly she looked about it, as though in that way she might solve the mystery. A piece of paper in one corner caught her eye and she picked it up.""No, I'll guarantee there was not a piece of paper in that room when you carried that girl in,"" said the farmer's wife. ""I had just swept,"" and she tossed her head in pardonable pride of her housework.""It's evidently a piece torn from a letter,"" answered Grace, as she accepted the paper from the woman, ""and all I can make out are the words--'not go to Shadow Valley even if'--and that's all there is to it.""They talked it over for some time, but could come to no other conclusion. Grace saved the scrap of paper, and soon, having bidden good-bye to Mrs. Meckelburn, they were on their way again, with Mollie at the wheel.They had made the turn into a road that would lead them to Deepdale when they came in sight of a man standing in the road beside a small, and rather gaudily painted wagon. He seemed to be looking in the dust for something, and Mollie, seeing him, slowed up, remarking:The appearance of the man, in some ways, was enough to invite the confidence of four girls, and in others was not. He had long, and very white hair, fluffy and wavy, and was dressed in a shabby suit of black, but his face had hard, cruel lines in it, as though he were in the habit of imposing his will on others.A look at his wagon showed the character of his trade, for it was brilliantly lettered with such devices and mottoes as--""Bennington's Hair is All His Own."" ""Use His Restorer and Be Likewise."" Another was: ""Bennington's Restorer Really Restores.""""Yes, ladies,"" he said with a smirk and bow, taking off his broad brimmed hat, and running his fingers through his hair, making it fluff out more than ever, ""I have lost a bolt out of part of my wagon, and I'm afraid to go on lest I break down. It dropped somewhere in the dust, but I can't find it."""
"""You all have fine hair,"" returned the peddler; ""but at that it would be all the better for Bennington's Restorer--I am Bennington--I make it myself,"" and he bowed. ""Won't you take it. I can guarantee it harmless.""""Probably he doesn't,"" answered Mollie. ""He may sleep in his wagon, eat there--dining on bread and cheese or herring--and so reduce the high cost of living. Then he may make a big profit on his hair restorer. Ugh! The stuff! I could not bear to use it.""Quickly Mollie put on both brakes, and threw out the clutch, but there was no need; for the child, with the perverseness of youth, had turned and was running back toward the gate, evidently frightened by the frantic tooting of the horn, the bulb of which Mollie pressed spasmodically.""Well, I don't want to seem mean, but he is getting just what he deserves,"" said Grace, looking back, ""and that is--a spanking. Toddlers must be made to learn the danger of rushing blindly across auto roads.""""Of course I've got lots to learn,"" she said to her chums, ""but that will come gradually, the demonstrator said. One learns, after a while, to steer instinctively, and to do everything almost automatically--like slowing down, applying the brakes and so on. Now you girls must come over to-night, and we'll----""In the days that followed the four inseparables took many rides out into the beautiful country around Deepdale. True to her determination, Mollie insisted on Betty, Amy and Grace taking at least a few lessons. Betty was quick to learn, but Grace was not quite strong enough to handle the wheel properly, and Amy was too timid. Still, either of the latter could manage the car on a straight, level road, but Betty was the only one who persisted enough to be able to get a license, which she one day took out on Mollie's suggestion.""Oh, it isn't quite ready yet,"" she said. ""I'll tell you in plenty of time to prepare for it, though. Mind your wheel, Bet, there are two cars coming back of us, and I think they're going to pass us close.""""There--I've told part of my secret!"" exclaimed Mollie, in some confusion. ""I was going to suggest that, as we have a sort of informal Camping and Tramping Club, and as there is a kind of motor boat club feeling existing among us, we form an auto club.""""That doesn't make a bit of difference!"" broke in Mollie. ""You don't have to have an auto to belong to this club. Just as when you get your airship, Grace, we'll join your aero club; though you'll be the only one with a flying machine.""""Do come in for a cup of tea,"" urged Mollie. ""It will refresh you all. No, no, Paul!"" she called to her brother, ""you must not get in sister's auto when she is not in it,"" for the little fellow had started to climb up in the front seat as the girls strolled toward the house."
"""That would suit me,"" laughed Grace. ""Here, Paul, and don't get that on your suit--the chocolate is so sticky and messy in warm weather,"" and Grace daintily removed, with the tip of her tongue, some brown spots from the ends of her rosy fingers that had passed the candy to the little boy.The four girls ran swiftly across the lawn--yes, swiftly, for no such creations as ""hobble skirts"" hindered them. Fortunately Mrs. Billette, whose French nature was easily excited had not seen the happening. Dodo was out with the maid.Paul had, with the impishness of childhood, climbed up in the auto. It was a simple matter to even blunder on pushing the button that would set the self-starter in operation. The car had been left standing on a level bit of road, but, just ahead of it, was a rather steep slope. Mollie had neglected to leave the emergency brake set, and when the motor started there was vibration enough to send the car over the little space that separated it from the slope. Then it simply rolled down. That was what had happened first.It seemed that Paul had a tricycle, worked by foot pedals and hand levers, and he was quite expert in its use. He had now put into practice what had been told him about his toy, and had added his observations of Mollie's operation of her car.After starting the motor Paul had somehow managed to slip in the low gear, and the marvel of it was that he knew enough to disengage the clutch while he did this. Afterward he told how he had heard the demonstrator impress many times on Mollie the need of doing so.It was hopeless for the girls to try to catch the auto now. They were far behind it, but still Betty ran on. Several narrow escapes had Paul on that perilous journey, and then in the nick of time he was saved from what might have been a serious accident.Up the road was coming a racing car, going at high speed. The man, crouched almost under the steering wheel, if he saw Mollie's car at all, probably imagined that a motorist of experience was guiding it. But Paul was on the wrong side of the road, and there was no telling at what moment he might shift the course.Will Ford was riding directly toward Paul. In an instant Grace's brother had sensed the situation. Skillfully going around the racing car, which had fortunately slackened speed as the driver evidently realized that something was wrong, Will guided his wheel toward Mollie's auto.Then he turned, so as to ride in the direction in which it was advancing, with ever-increasing speed. Will gauged his progress to that of the car, rode up alongside the run-board, and, in another instant, kicked his wheel from under him and was at Paul's side. In another second he had snapped off the power and applied the brakes.Paul was contentedly chewing a candy Grace had produced and the little crowd that had gathered, on seeing Will's act, began to disperse, understanding what had happened. Then Mollie, assuming the wheel, directed the car back to her house, taking the girls and Paul in it. Will went back to get his bicycle and the excitement was over. But it took some time for the girls to quiet down."
"""Our auto tour. That's what I've been working on. I wanted to plan a nice route--one that would take in a good stretch of country, enable us to see new places, and be comfortable. Now I have it all mapped out. You'll come; won't you--all of you?"" and she looked appealingly at her chums.""Why, since I have a car, we must get the best use out of it we can. So why can't we four--and a chaperone, if we think we need one--go for a tour, the same as when we walked--only this time we'll ride? We can make five hundred, or a thousand, miles, if we choose, stopping over night in different places. Won't it be fun?""""Well, it _is_ running a risk,"" he answered, as he took a chair Amy set out for him. ""But I have important business down here, so I though I'd call. I worked out that little verse on the way down,"" he confided to the girls.""It is indeed!"" exclaimed Mr. Lagg, brightening up on hearing this praise. ""I am glad you noticed that. Yes, I am gradually getting it better, and on a higher plane. That is what worried me about leaving my store alone.""""Practically so,"" was the answer. ""I have a boy I hire occasionally, but he hasn't the least talent in the line of poetry, and I know my customers will miss that. However, they will have to put up with it for a few hours. I am going back as soon as I can.""Perhaps,"" he added, cautiously, ""I should never have worked up my versifying talent; but, somehow, I just couldn't seem to help it. I started in a modest way, just as I did in my store, and it seemed to grow of itself. Now my customers have come to look for it, and I know if Johnnie--that's the boy I spoke of as being left in charge--I know he'll rhyme the wrong words--that is, if he attempts anything at all, which he is likely to do. And nothing displeases a customer more than to listen to wrong rhymes; don't you think so?"" and he appealed to the chums.He was obviously uncomfortable in his ""Sunday-go-to-meetin'"" suit, and a stiff shirt and a stiffer collar did not add to his ease. But he stood it manfully. Sitting on the edge of the chair he looked from one to the other, twirling his hat."
"""Not what it should be,"" replied Mr. Lagg, with a smile. He seemed to feel that he was making progress now. At least he was in his own element. ""Not what it should be. I miss you girls. When you used to run in now and then for something in my line I did better. You were good customers, and I always shaded the prices all I could, besides reciting all my newest poetry as soon as I made it up. It isn't everyone I do that for,"" he added. ""Why, to some customers I never speak more than a line or two in a whole year. But you girls--well, you're different. I miss seeing the _Gem_ tied at my dock. There isn't a chance that you'll go cruising again; is there?"" he asked, eagerly.""So, you see, unless you could arrange to have a sort of traveling store, we couldn't patronize you very often,"" went on Mollie, wondering why Mr. Lagg did not come to the point. He had evidently called with some special object in view, and leaving his establishment during the height of the season would seem to indicate that the object was not a trivial one. ""But we'll stop in whenever we're near you,"" Mollie concluded.""Then that may fit in with what I have called about,"" said Mr. Lagg, quickly. ""Yes, it may be just the very best idea yet. Excuse me a moment while I think,"" he said, and he closed his eyes. His head nodded two or three times in a satisfied sort of way, and occasionally he murmured to himself. The girls looked at one another, unable to fathom the meaning of this conduct. Then Mr. Lagg whistled and suddenly exclaimed:""Yes,"" answered the storekeeper. ""Mr. Kenyon, who was once a millionaire, built that mansion after ideas of his own. Everyone said Shadow Valley--at least that part of it--was too gloomy and out of the way to be a good place for a mansion like that, and the folks around here said it was foolish. They called it Kenyon's Folly from the start, though he named it Kenyon's Woodland Lodge, or some such fancy name as that.""""Yes,"" answered Mr. Lagg. ""From the very first his wife took a dislike to the place. She said it was too gloomy, and in spite of a lot of entertainments and parties--elaborate affairs they were, too--life there was dreary. They had lots of company, but Shadow Valley seemed to cast a gloom over the big mansion."
"""Then Mr. Kenyon died, and some said it was partly due to grief over the fact that his wife refused to live in the place. At any rate, he closed it up, and went abroad, I believe, not living long after he started to tour Europe.""Then there was trouble over his will, his whole estate was thrown into court, and the heirs fought and squabbled over the mansion, as well as over the rest of his possessions. No one could get title to it, and the place fell into neglect.""""Yes. After years of litigation the courts, last spring, ordered the mansion sold. I saw a chance to get a bargain, and as I had some money put away I bought in the property. I got it cheap, but I purchased it through an agent so that no one, except a very few, know that I own it.""""No, I don't intend to live there,"" said Mr. Lagg. ""I didn't buy it for that. But I thought it would be a good investment, and I had an idea of forming a company, and turning it into a hotel. By making some changes the surroundings could be made less gloomy, and the place would pay.""But before I could do that I got an offer from some doctors, who wanted to establish a sort of sanitarium for the treatment of nervous diseases. They saw the mansion, and decided it would be just the thing, being so quiet, and all that.""""I'm coming to that,"" spoke Mr. Lagg, being now too interested to quote a couplet. ""Matters were going on well, and I expected to close the deal, and make a pretty penny, when the doctors said they couldn't take the property, as it was haunted, and of course a haunted house, with queer noises in the night, would never do as a home for nervous invalids. I could see that myself.""""It seems that some of them were inspecting the place late one afternoon, a day or so ago,"" said the storekeeper, ""when a shower came up, and they had to stay inside until it was over, which was after dark. It was then they heard the queer groans, and saw strange lights, and felt cold draughts of wind.""""I guess it got on the nerves of the doctors,"" said Mr. Lagg, ruefully, ""for they called off the deal, and said they could not take the house unless I would get rid of the haunt. Of course I laughed, and made an investigation.""""Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Lagg,"" she asked, ""that those doctors might be playing a trick on you to get you to part with the property cheap? A haunted house isn't the best sort of real estate, you know; but haunts and ghosts can easily be imitated, and those doctors might be up to some such trick as that.""""Very well,"" said Mr. Lagg, calmly. ""I've no objection to the boys helping you in this case. In fact, it might be better. But what I want to know is, could you--and would you--dare try to solve the ghostly mystery?""The girls looked at one another. Amy was shaking her head in the negative. Betty and Mollie seemed interested, for they were born leaders, Betty especially. Grace reached for another chocolate, always a source of inspiration for her."
"""Of course I'm not asking you to give up your time and go to a lot of trouble for nothing,"" resumed Mr. Lagg, quickly. ""I am willing to pay you well. So I make you this offer. If you can discover what makes those ghostly sounds and manifestations, and can show me a way to get rid of them, if they are natural, which I am sure they are, why, I'll pay you a good sum. I can afford to, for I can then sell the mansion to the sanitarium doctors. Will you try it?""""But if those doctors are interested in depreciating the value of the property, by making it appear haunted, they would have a good object in preventing us from finding out what causes the queer noises and lights,"" said Mollie.""Exactly,"" agreed Mr. Lagg, ""but you girls were smart enough to solve that five hundred dollar mystery, and the mystery on Elm Island, so I have hopes that you can help me out in this. That is why I called. Will you help me?"" Mr. Lagg looked hopefully from one to the other of the Outdoor Girls. Clearly he was very much in earnest over his strange offer, and he saw nothing out of the ordinary in it. But it must be admitted that it is not every day four girls are asked to take a motor tour and solve the mystery of a ghost-haunted house. Betty and her chums evidently realized that.""I won't have you undertake it on any other basis,"" he interrupted. ""If you solve that mystery for me it will be a big favor, and worth paying for. I might make up a verse about that part of it, but I won't take your time. But please consider it.""""You might not have to stay there all night,"" said Mr. Lagg, ""though of course I know that is customary in solving mysteries of this kind. You might be able to tell what it was without staying there long. I wouldn't want you to run any risks, you know.""""I can't spare the time. I am needed at my store. That boy is sure to wrap up the wrong kind of tea or sugar, and my customers are very particular. And as for the poetry end of the business, he is no good at that at all. No, I can't spare the time.""""I thought of that,"" said Mr. Lagg, simply, ""but you know what the police are about ghosts. They would only laugh at me, and do nothing. Besides, if these doctors are doing it, they are sharp enough to cover their tracks well. I would have no chance. But they would never suspect you girls, and they might betray themselves. Come now, will you look into this for me?"""
"He was very much in earnest, and Mollie, who had at first been inclined to laugh at the ghost theory, began to think that at least Mr. Lagg had some basis for his alarm. If after all his work in getting the property, that no one had cared for so long, it was to become useless on his hands, he was to be pitied, for he had labored hard to accumulate his savings.""You needn't answer me right away,"" went on the storekeeper. ""Take a little time and think it over. Speak to your folks about it, and tell the boys, if you like. But if these ghosts, whatever they are, don't get out of that place soon, I'll lose all the money I put in it.""""No, they haven't yet. If that is their game they will wait a little longer, I think,"" spoke Mr. Lagg. ""But don't be in a hurry to decide now. Think it over. I'll go now, for I must get back to my store.""We'd better solve the mystery first,"" said practical Betty, ""then we'll know what sort of a book to make. I wonder if we ought to take this up?"" and she gazed half-doubtfully, half-suggestingly, at her chums.""Not right away, at any rate!"" exclaimed Mollie. ""Let's talk about our motor tour. I'm just dying to get off on that. Afterward we can consider Mr. Lagg's offer. Poor man, he seemed really worried! I'd like to help him if we could.""The girls alternated their talk between the proposed tour and the haunted mansion. The latter was left in abeyance, but they tentatively decided to take a long auto trip, as soon as they could arrange for a chaperone to go with them on such occasions as they would stay over night at hotels, while other nights were to be spent at the homes of relatives or friends. In a way it would be a duplication of their camping and tramping trip, except that they would cover a wider range of country, and be more comfortable.Auto veils, bonnets, goggles and gowns were soon donned, Mollie's chums having come partly prepared for a trip, and soon, with Mollie at the wheel, they were riding down the pleasant main street of Deepdale.""Did you ever see such a sister!"" cried Will. ""She has no heart! Very well, run us around to Lee's, Mollie. I'll get the candy if it--breaks me,"" and he began searching through his pockets, picking up bits of change on the way."
"""Because I acted as Mr. Lagg's representative in some legal matters,"" replied the young law student, who was allowed to do some practice. ""I know that he owns the old mansion, and I heard, indirectly, that he was having trouble disposing of it to the sanitarium doctors. Of course I can't say as to the ghost, but there is some hitch over carrying out the transaction. If you girls could solve the mystery, providing there is one, I know you would be doing Mr. Lagg a service.""Half-jokingly they talked about it as they motored over the pleasant road. There had been a heavy shower the night before and the main highways were in excellent condition, though a trifle muddy in spots. Of course some of the less-used country roads would be well-nigh impassable.It was while crossing one of these roads, on a hard macadam highway, that the girls and boys saw, stuck in the mud of the poorer path, a peddler's wagon. The bony horse was doing its best to move the vehicle, which had sunk down in a hole, one wheel being imbedded in the mud to the hub.""No, his wagon is all painted with gaudy signs,"" said Betty. ""That's a boy driving that wagon. Why--why!"" she exclaimed, as she caught sight of the lad, ""it's the same boy who took home the little lost girl for us--the same one who told us about the man with the five hundred dollar bill. It's Jimmie Martin!"" The boy, who was endeavoring--and by gentle urging, be it said to his credit--to get the horse to pull the wagon out of the mud-hole, looked up on hearing his name spoken by Betty. At first he did not recognize the girls, and his face plainly showed this.""Exactly,"" agreed Betty. ""But you seem to be in trouble, Jimmie,"" for the bony horse had given over the attempt to move the mired wagon and was patiently resting between the shafts, awaiting developments.""I'm still my own boss,"" he replied, with a smile. ""I am trying for a larger trade, that's all. I got the chance to buy this outfit cheap, and I took it. I guess I got it too cheap,"" he added, ruefully, ""for this horse isn't strong enough to pull me out of this mud-hole. I shouldn't have come this way.""""Oh, not very. You see, there are not enough folks living there. So I thought I'd take a short cut over to Limeburg. I generally do pretty well there. But I guess I'd have done better to have gone the long way. I'm stuck for fair. Go 'long there, Stamp!"" he called to the horse. ""See if you can move the boat."""
"""Well, I guess I'll have to stay here until this mud dries up,"" went on Jimmie, ""or I might feed up Stamp until he is strong enough to pull me out. Only that would take too long, I'm afraid. He's been kept on a diet of carpet tacks, lately, to judge by the many fine points about him,"" he added, whimsically.""I was going to see if we couldn't pull him out of the hole,"" replied Will. ""If the rope is long enough to reach from his wagon to the auto, and the rope holds, and his wagon doesn't pull apart with the strain, we can do it.""Slowly the auto started. There came a strain on the rope. There was a creaking to the old vehicle, and then it slowly began to emerge from the mud. The old horse, who had almost gone to sleep, roused up at this strange activity, and was literally forced to stir out of his tracks. In a few seconds the wagon was on the firm road, the auto having pulled it in a diagonal direction from the mud-hole.One end--that nearest them--was laid out in a number of small farms, on which were substantial houses. But the other end, where ""Kenyon's Folly"" had been built, was in the narrower part, and was almost deserted as regards residences. This section of the valley was narrower, the hills--almost mountains--rose high on either side, hemming it in. This produced deep shadows early and late in the day, and gave the valley its name. Grace and Amy were in each other's arms. Betty admitted afterward that she wished she had some one to lean on, but she gripped the steering wheel until her knuckles went white with the strain. Mollie clutched the sides of the seat in a grip of something like despair. The boys looked wonderingly at one another, and then at the strange figure that had tumbled out of the bushes.""At your service, ladies and gentlemen!"" exclaimed the proprietor of Bennington's Hair-Tonic. ""I see you remember me,"" and he smirked at the girls--that hard, and rather cruel, look never leaving his face, even when he smiled.""That was an accident,"" replied Mr. Bennington, who continued to dust his clothes, which seemed to have accumulated considerable of the dirt of the road. ""I was up on the hillside gathering the herbs I use in my tonic, when my foot slipped. I heard the auto coming, and I was afraid I might roll under it. That is why I yelled.""""I am sorry I have nothing for nerves,"" and the fellow bowed, rather mockingly, it seemed. ""I am a specialist in hair. If you would like any of my tonic--something to make your locks like mine,"" and he shook his own with an air of pride, ""why,"" he resumed, ""I am at your service!"" Again he bowed.""Don't you believe it!"" declared Will. ""To my way of thinking, he's a faker. He looked plump and well-fed enough. I warrant you he has no lack of good food. Those fellows put about ten cents worth of alcohol in a bottle, a little perfume and some water, and sell it for a dollar as hair-tonic."""
"Mollie glanced back toward Shadow Valley. The gloom over it was increasing, and at the far end could just be discerned the deserted mansion--the remnant of a rich man's folly. About that, too, the shadows seemed to gather, dark and foreboding.""Ugh! That place gives me the creeps!"" Mollie muttered. And against the dusky background of the valley and the old mansion she beheld the figure of the rather mysterious peddler. His white locks stood out in strange contrast to the surrounding darkness, and his black clothes.""It certainly looks as though it might be haunted,"" agreed Betty. ""Poor Mr. Lagg! I'm afraid he will never get the money he expects out of that place. It would never do for a sanitarium for nervous wrecks.""""Oh, I don't know,"" answered Will. ""I've been close to it several times, and, I think, by cutting down some of the trees that keep out the sunlight, a good view could be had. Then the place would not be half so depressing. But of course if it gets a reputation of being haunted that will settle it as far as people with weak nerves are concerned. Are you girls going to take up Lagg's offer?""The car was now descending a slope, and soon Shadow Valley was out of sight, as was the strange old mansion. The girls breathed easier, and perhaps the boys did also, for, though nothing had actually occurred, the reputation of the place, and the sudden and startling appearance of the old man, had given them all a thrill.""Poor girl!"" spoke Amy. ""I hope she found some friends, at any rate,"" and Amy thought of the mystery surrounding her own life, and how fortunate she had been to find such a good home with Mr. and Mrs. Stonington.As Mollie had said, the details of the tour were now practically settled. Mollie's cousin, Mrs. Jane Mackson, had arranged to accompany the girls as chaperone, and on such times as she could not be with them they were to stop over night at the homes of friends or relatives.They did not arrange for any definite rules about their trips. It was to be a pleasure jaunt, and at times they would cover more ground than others. Nor were any fixed dates set as to when they would be at certain places. As Mollie aptly expressed it:And so the tour was laid out. The girls would take with them suit-cases with sufficient change of raiment to do them until other things could be forwarded from their homes to various designated points. Occasionally they would take a run back to Deepdale to renew necessaries."
"""Oh, we're always careful,"" said Mollie. ""Don't fuss, Cousin Jane, or you won't have a good time."" Mollie was too kind to add that neither would her friends have much pleasure, and perhaps Mrs. Mackson realized this, for, though she would clutch nervously at the side of the seat whenever the car jolted or lurched, she said nothing more in the way of caution.They were on the main street of Deepdale now, having to pass through the town to get to the road that led to Freedenburg, which was about seventy-five miles away. They planned to make the town by night.The main street had been sprinkled to lay the dust, and there were little puddles of water here and there. It was impossible to avoid all of them, and Mollie went into a big one at a crossing. The big-tired wheel threw some muddy spray and it went far enough to land on the highly-polished shoes of a youth who had paused to let the car pass.""That was nice of him,"" said Mollie. ""I did spoil his polish, but when he saw Betty he was as nice as pie, though he looked as if he'd like to eat me up a moment before. Betty, you are to be congratulated.""The girls were soon outside the town, bowling along a pleasant country road. The day was perfect, and, as Grace said, they could not have had a better one for their start had it been ""made to order."" They had plenty of lunch with them, and planned to stop in some convenient spot at noon and eat.""At least I hope so,"" went on the poetical grocer, with a laugh. ""Say you'll undertake that job,"" he pleaded. ""I've tried to get those doctors to take the place, ghost and all, but they won't, and I'll have it on my hands if I don't look out.""""No, not yet. They asked me if I could guarantee that there would be no queer disturbances, and of course I couldn't so they said they'd have to wait. But they're dickering for another place, and may take it. I wish there was no such things as ghosts.""""A fellow like Pete Skillinger, or some of the fishermen around here, might imagine,"" he admitted, ""but not those scientific doctors. They certainly saw, and heard, something they couldn't explain. They sure did!""""No, these doctors are all well-known men, and have good reputations,"" said Mr. Lagg, with another puzzled shake of his head. ""They wouldn't do such a thing. I don't doubt but what this haunting business can be explained; but how? That's the question. How? I can't solve it--I haven't time--daren't leave my store. Now you girls are smart and brave. The ghost of Elm Island didn't bother you, so why should this one?"""
"They kept on, enjoying the ride to the utmost. Just before noon they got a puncture, and voted not to attend to it until after lunch, which they ate near a road-side spring, under a great oak tree. And then the Fates were kind to them. For, as they were laboriously jacking up the car to take off the tire, a lone chauffeur, in a big car, came along and kindly offered to do the work for them.The girls gladly accepted, and watched him carefully, for though they had once or twice before changed a shoe, they were not skillful at it. Mollie offered the man some change, but he declined with a laugh and reddened under his tan.""You meant it all right,"" said Betty. ""And really he looked like a professional chauffeur. He might have taken the money, and let us think so. I read a story once where a man did that, and fell in love with a girl, and----""Again the girls were off, and without further accident, save that when Betty was driving she narrowly missed running over a persistent barking dog. They reached Freedenburg, and went to the hotel, leaving the auto at a public garage near by.The services of a maid were at their disposal in their rooms, and they were soon making themselves fresh for the dinner that was shortly to be served. As Mollie let down her long hair the maid uttered an exclamation:""It's lovely!"" the maid insisted. ""I haven't seen any as nice--not since a strange girl stopped here one night some time ago, and I helped her do hers up. Hers was nearly to the floor when she stood up. And it was just the color of yours. She had a scar on her forehead, I remember--a recent one, and I had to be careful of it as I combed her hair.""Then, to the surprise of Betty and her chums, the hotel maid gave a good description of the girl they had seen fall out of the tree some time before--the girl who had so strangely disappeared when they went after aid for her.""Nothing much. She seemed all right, as far as her health was concerned, but she did not seem happy. The cut on her head was nothing. I asked her if the fall from the tree had hurt her, and she said not much.""""No, only in a general way. I thought, from what she said, Miss, that she had seen trouble, and was trying to get away from it. She was well dressed, and had some money. She let fall that she was traveling about, trying to find some friends she had lost track of. There was some mystery about her, of that I'm certain."""
"The girls dressed for dinner, and then visited the hotel office. The maid fortunately had a good memory, and could tell the date of the girl's stay. The register of that day contained several names, but the clerk recalled the incident of the girl applying for a room. This hotel made a speciality of catering to women patrons.They talked and speculated about her, but that was all they could do. They could arrive at no conclusion. It was plain that she had not been as badly hurt as they had feared, and, after leaving the farm house, must have gone to some other place of shelter. She must have also changed her garments, for the dress the maid described was not the one she wore at the time of the accident.""She seems to have come into our lives in a most mysterious way,"" said Mollie, ""and then to have vanished. We get a glimpse of her, as it were, and again she vanishes. I wonder if we will ever solve the mystery?""All the conclusion the girls could come to was that the girl, after leaving the farm house, had somehow managed to find those who were able to look after her. Then had come an interim, which was a blank as far as the girls were concerned. Then came the hotel episode, and--another blank.That evening, with Cousin Jane to accompany them, they went to a pretty little play, enjoying it very much. Morning saw them on the road again, and they stopped the next night at the house of a distant relative of Betty's mother.Then, for a time, the good luck the girls had had left them. There came a spell of rain that lasted two days, and they remained in the house of Mrs. Nelson's relative--rather miserable days they were, too, for there was little to occupy them. But all things come to an end finally, and the bad weather was no exception.The sun came out, the roads dried up, and one pleasant morning saw the outdoor girls again in the car, speeding onward. Their objective point was Wendell City, and to reach this they had to make a detour that would take them through a picturesque part of the country.In fact it was so picturesque, and there were so many fine views, that Mollie stopped the car oftener than she meant to, and in consequence they were far behind their schedule when it began to grow dusk.""Oh, it isn't anything serious, I think,"" said Mollie. ""But one of the cylinders seems to be 'missing.' There, hear it!"" she exclaimed. The girls were expert enough to detect the ""miss,"" now. It was unmistakable.The auto faltered on top of the hill. Then it went down and on the level seemed to be all right again. The girls were more hopeful, until the next hill was reached. There the car nearly stalled. But the summit was reached, and there appeared in view a long, easy, downward slope."
"""And the--the----"" it was Betty who began this, it being her evident intention to make a remark about the haunted house. Then her usual good sense came to her rescue, and she refrained. There was pressure enough now on the nerves of her chums, she reasoned.""I understand that our car has balked for some reason or other,"" said Betty in brisk, business-like tones, ""and we have to fix it. If we don't we are likely to be caught in a thunder storm. So get out, girls, and let's hunt for trouble. Grace, if you have any chocolates left you might offer them as a prize for the one who first discovers the difficulty--and why the motor won't mote. Cousin Jane will be the--stake-holder is the proper term, I believe.""""I do indeed, and that's why I say we must make this car go,"" went on Betty. ""Come,"" and she got out, followed by Mollie. ""It seems hard lines to get a thunder storm after all the rain we've had, but it is threatening. Let's get busy.""""I think that suggestion very practical,"" said Mrs. Mackson. ""Girls, you had better do as Betty says and try to find out what is the matter with the car. I don't know anything about such things or I'd help. If a hairpin will be of any use I have an extra paper of them with me.""It was growing dark and gloomy, and though it was not yet seven o'clock the lowering clouds had added to the dusk of approaching night. Occasionally, in the distance, could be heard the low rumbling of thunder.""That's all right,"" spoke Betty, soothingly, for she noted that Mollie's temper might get the best of her under the stress of the trouble. ""Let's look at the engine first. Shall I light the lamps, Mollie?""""Yes, do. I didn't think of them. Light the oil ones as well as switch on the electrics. We may need both, and I am not sure of that storage battery. The last place I had it looked at the man said it would need re-charging soon.""""Just push the self-starter button,"" she directed Betty after a moment, during which she had primed the cylinders with gasoline, and changed the adjustment of the carburetor slightly. She had really made quite a study of the troubles that might beset a motor, and the garage man had added some further instructions.Mollie watched while Betty pushed the lever, and set the electric starter in motion, but when the gasoline and spark levers were set at the proper places, the motor did not respond, the fly wheel merely revolving under the impulse of the starter.""That's it. I--I hate to mention it. But we are nearer to it than ever since--since Mr. Lagg told us about the--the trouble there. I wish we were--back home. Gracious--what's that?"" and she jumped nervously, clutching Amy's arm."
"""Only thunder--a sharper clap than usual--don't be a goose!"" said Betty, sharply. ""Shall I try it again, Mollie?"" for Mollie was still inspecting the motor by the light of one of the oil lamps held over it by Cousin Jane, while Betty was at the steering wheel, manipulating the levers.""It's no use!"" sighed Mollie. ""I'll have to have a garage man look at it. Probably it's some simple little thing. That's generally the way--it's the little things of life that make so much trouble. You can fight a big thing better.""""Oh, I know it!"" and Mollie's voice trembled. ""It was horribly mean of me to answer you as I did. I beg your pardon, but I am _so_ bothered! Isn't it mean to have things go wrong this way, and at such an inconvenient time and place?""""Never mind,"" spoke Betty, laughing. ""To-morrow we will only think this was fun. And now I suggest that we go down the road a bit, and look for a garage. It's true that this isn't a main highway, but nowadays even the country blacksmiths are calling themselves auto repairers. We may come upon one unexpectedly, and if his shop is closed he may live near enough so that we can get him out here. Let's try, anyhow.""""And I think you'd better put the top up while we are gone,"" suggested Mollie. ""It may rain suddenly, and with the top and the side curtains and wind-shield in front, we can at least keep dry until morning.""""I'll not stay,"" declared Grace. ""I'll walk anywhere--even in the rain--to get away from--this place,"" and she could not repress a shudder as she looked back over her shoulder at the entrance to gloomy Shadow Valley.Betty again took her position at the wheel--why, she hardly knew. Mollie had closed the bonnet over the motor, evidently giving up trying to discover the trouble. Idly Betty pushed on the button and lever of the self-starter, and then she exclaimed:""The self-starter! It's guaranteed to run the car under electric power for nearly a mile, without the motor being operated. All we'll have to do will be to set the starter going--that turns the fly wheel, you know. Then we can put in low gear, slip in the clutch, just as if the motor was in operation, and get the car to the top of the hill. We're really at the top now, for it's level here. But we can get it to the edge of the downward slope, and let it coast. Then, on the next level, we can do the same thing again. In that way I am almost sure we can make over a mile."""
"""Oh, I don't take any credit for that think! I just recalled an advertisement I had read about self-starters. Nearly all of them say the starters alone will propel the car for some distance. Let's try it, anyhow.""Betty soon demonstrated that she could get the auto to move, and slowly but surely it rolled along until it had started down a long, gentle slope. Then Betty shut off the electric motor, which was run by a storage battery, and applied the brakes.Betty again repeated her operation with the starter. The car went forward slowly, and the girls were very hopeful, and then suddenly the auto came to a stop with a sort of whining groan, and the electric lights went out.It began to rain, gently at first, even while they were struggling with the rather refractory top, in the dim light of the two oil lamps. But they managed to get it in place. Then, as they were fastening the side curtains, the storm burst in all its fury, with a suddenness that was almost terrifying.Grace and Amy, who were trying to fasten a curtain on the side of the auto whence the wind came, screamed and let go of the flap. In an instant, so powerful was the wind, it had ripped off the curtain, sending it scurrying away in the blackness of the night, that was torn and pierced by frequent flashes of lightning.""Never mind! Don't talk about that now. Get on your raincoats, girls, or you'll be drenched!"" and, fastening the last strap of her curtain, Mollie donned her garment--the girls and Mrs. Mackson carrying them in a seat locker that Mollie had utilized for this purpose.But the rain came in at the place where there was no side curtain, sweeping over them all. The wind blew fiercely, and the auto swayed in the blast. Miserable indeed was the plight of the Outdoor Girls. They were possibly having just a little too much of out doors.They tried, but it was hard work. The curtains fastened with straps above and below, being a new kind, and not very satisfactory, as Mollie declared then and there. Nor were the girls successful, for the wind whipped and blew the curtain about so that it was impossible to put it up. Thus there were two openings now--one on either side of the auto--and rain came in both.""It wasn't your fault,"" said Betty. ""You couldn't tell that the motor was going to give out. Besides, what if we are wet? It isn't very cold, and we'll get dry some time. Oh, but that was a heavy one!"" she cried, pressing her hands over her ears as a tremendous peal of thunder followed closely after a vivid flash."
"""We can get out and walk until we find some kind of shelter,"" said Mollie. ""There must be some sort of house around here. This place isn't a desert. And even walking in the rain and mud is better than staying here, all cramped up, and drenched. Who will come?""""It doesn't show any signs of letting up,"" retorted Mollie. ""It acts to me like an all-night rain, and the longer we wait the worse off we'll be, and the less chance we'll have of finding any one up if we do locate a house.""The others hesitated a moment. As they waited and listened to the whining of the wind, the swish of the rain and the angry muttering of the thunder, and saw the vivid lightning, it was no wonder they did not want to decide hurriedly to go out in that out burst of the elements. But it was also trying on the nerves to stay in the stalled auto, exposed as it was by the lack of side curtains.""It's nice you can see some good points,"" laughed Mollie--yes, actually laughed, and the girls marveled at it. But Mollie had that rare quality of ""keeping her nerve,"" if I may be pardoned that expression, so often and effectively used by my friends, the boys.""We had better go forward,"" suggested Betty. ""We didn't pass any houses for quite a while as we were coming up here, and there may be one not far off just ahead. Or we may find a cross-road. Advance, I say!""She and Betty led the way, carrying the lamps, which gave but an uncertain light, and that only in one direction--forward. However, the road, though now quite muddy, was a level one, and in fairly good condition.Forward they tramped through the rain. It is on such occasions as these--when something goes wrong, upsetting all prearranged plans, and making life seem miserable--that true courage of a sort, comradeship, good-fellowship and real grit are best shown. And, to the credit of the outdoor girls be it said that, now they had taken the ""plunge"" none of them showed the white feather. They were brave under any circumstances and this very bravery strengthened their tired nerves.On they splashed through muddy puddles, protecting themselves from the rain as best they could by their coats. But occasionally the wind would whip them open, letting in the moisture that already had soaked the garments well.Much encouraged they kept on. The rain increased, but they did not so much care now. The thunder was just as hard, and the flashes of heaven's fire was vivid, while the wind seemed more powerful. But they kept on. The light they had seen seemed to grow brighter. Then it suddenly disappeared."
"By the lightning flashes they saw, set some distance back from the road, a large house. By the same flashes they saw leading up to it a path, much overgrown with weeds. And back of the house were big trees. The rest was not very distinct, but at least shelter was offered them.""Now see here!"" began Betty, and her voice was as severe as she could make it, for she recognized that now was the time to get the situation well in hand. ""This house is no more haunted than you are, Grace Ford.""Suiting the action to the word she advanced into the hall, through which the wind was now sweeping in rather mournful gusts. Mollie hesitated a moment, and then followed her chum. The action of the two leaders with the lanterns had a good effect on the others.This might have been accounted for in two ways. The presence of Betty and Mollie in the hall may have had its effect, or the kindly lights of the auto, glowing so cozily, disclosed a shelter that, whatever its disadvantages, at least afforded dryness.Then, too, the taking away of the lights from the three of the party who remained outside may have added to the effect. At any rate Grace stepped into the hall, followed by Cousin Jane, and then timid Amy, finding herself alone on the small porch, scurried in.""If we had only brought something to eat,"" sighed Grace. ""And our chocolate outfit!"" for they carried one, with a small alcohol stove, that they might make a hot drink when they stopped at noon for luncheon.""No use crying over missing chocolate,"" said Mollie. ""We're here, under shelter, anyhow; and we can keep dry. Now if we can find anyone at home we'll beg their hospitality for the night. Maybe they can get us a meal--if we pay for it.""""There's no one living in this house--I'm sure of that!"" declared Amy. ""Smell the musty odor--and--see----"" she pushed open a door leading from the hall, and directed Betty's hand so that the lantern flashed inside. The room was bare and empty. ""No one at all,"" she insisted. ""The house is deserted.""""Well, it's a queer thing to be insisting that you are in a haunted house,"" remarked Betty, ""but I am beginning to believe now that we are not. At least I agree with Mollie that this doesn't look at all like the place called Kenyon's Folly.""As the storm thundered and roared about them the girls looked around the hall and room. Truly it was but a poor structure, much fallen into decay now, yet at heart it was sound. Paint and decoration would do much to restore it."
"""Don't you remember, Mr. Lagg told us that there was a housekeeper's residence built to connect with the main structures?"" she said. ""There is a sort of covered passage, I believe, that goes to the main castle, as it were.""""And it will give us something to do to explore a bit,"" added Mrs. Mackson. ""Come along girls. Who knows but what we may find a table all set for us by fairy hands, as we used to read of in the story books?""They went through various rooms. All were deserted. Here and there they saw discarded and broken furniture. But there was no sign of recent habitation. The house was musty and damp, but they were glad of shelter from the storm.""Girls--supper!"" she exclaimed, and, holding her light high up, she flashed it on a collection of groceries. Boxes of sardines there were, dried herring, crackers, some butter in a carton, a loaf of bread, canned tomatoes and peaches, and with all some dishes--knives and forks, spoons, and, most useful of all--a can-opener, and a corkscrew--and--a bottle of olives!""So much the better; our consciences won't trouble us. And if anyone comes to claim them we can pay for what we eat--I have money!"" and she jingled her silver purse, ""And now, 'let good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both,'"" she quoted. ""Fall to!""The girls laughed, but they did ""fall to."" Cans and tins were opened, crackers and slices of bread spread, and with peach juice to drink, for they did not like to draw any water, fearing it might not be fresh--they ate--and ate--and ate again.She paused--they all did--mouths half opened. For from somewhere in the structure came a hollow and terrifying groan, and then followed the unmistakable sound of clinking metal, while a bluish light flashed around them. Then came another long-drawn cry--a shrill, eerie wail, and both their lights went out, leaving them in total darkness, while the storm shrieked about the old house, rocking it, and swaying it as though to tear it from its foundations. Screams and frightened exclamations on the part of the girls followed the queer manifestations. Even Cousin Jane gave a cry of alarm, and clung to Betty. In fact, everyone was clinging to some one else, the table having been deserted at the first alarm.There was silence for a moment--no, not altogether a silence, for the noise of the storm indicated that it was not in the least lessening, but there was comparative quiet in the room, and then again came that strange bluish, flickering glare, and the metallic clanging sound. Then there was that startling, hollow groan, that seemed to echo and re-echo through the deserted house.It was sufficiently terrible there in the darkness, illuminated only by the lightning, or by that weird blue glare that seemed to come from no place in particular, but which shone through the whole room--throwing into ghastly outlines the faces of the girls.Even then, Betty confessed afterward, she felt a hysterical desire to propound the old question of where a certain Biblical personage was when the light went out, but instead Grace answered before her:"
"The interior of the old house was quiet now, as with fingers that would tremble in spite of her efforts to still them, Grace lighted a match, and applied the flickering flame to the wick of one of the lamps which Betty opened. Then, as the cheerful yellow glow shone around them, Amy cried:""Gracious! I hope that doesn't happen here!"" exclaimed Betty, as she helped Grace light the other lantern. Then the girls looked at one another. From the faces they glanced to the table. Nothing there had been altered, nor had the room changed in appearance.""Let's finish the meal,"" suggested Mollie. ""There is some left, and there's no telling when the owner--or owners--may come along. If we've eaten it all up they can't do any more than make us pay for it, which we are perfectly willing to do. But if there's some food still left they might stop us from eating it. So let's begin again, girls.""""Oh, well, yes; but this is different,"" protested Grace. ""These hollow groans--there they go again!"" and she clutched Amy's arm so suddenly that a cracker and herring sandwich the latter was eating went to the floor.""That is only the wind,"" declared Mrs. Mackson, though she looked over her shoulder apprehensively. ""The wind, moaning down an old chimney, or in some broken window, and around a corner--I have often heard it that way.""""You're a comfort, at least,"" murmured Betty. ""But, girls, I really wonder if it could be anyone in trouble? Someone who took refuge in here from the storm, as we did, and who, wandering about, fell and got hurt. That girl, perhaps--the one from the tree----""""Don't be silly,"" advised Betty. ""Why, of course some one is here, or has been here. Else how would that food get here? That is not ghostly, at all events. It was very material, and satisfying, and I'm deeply grateful for it. It stands to reason that some one expected to eat it.""My theory is that some one, traveling perhaps like ourselves, only maybe not in an auto, was overtaken by the storm. More provident than we they had lunch with them, and brought it in here, intending to eat it. Then some accident happened to them, or----"""
"""We'll tell him,"" suggested Mollie. ""It's a pity, while we are here, that we don't solve the mystery of the haunted house. Of course, strictly speaking, we are not in the mansion proper, but we could go there----""They were going along the passage by which they had entered. The rain was not coming down so hard now, and the lightning and thunder were less frequent. The door was swinging to and fro on its hinges, swayed by the wind which blew in gusts up and down the passage.Mollie was in the rear, carrying one lantern, with Betty in the lead with the other. They had almost reached the outer door, and were eagerly hoping they would see some friendly passer-by when a noise behind her caused Mollie to turn quickly. She saw a tall white object in a proverbially ghostly winding sheet. It had come from a side room.Mollie screamed. The others, adding their startled voices to hers, beheld the white figure catch the frightened girl by the arm, and thrust her into the room. Then the door was slammed shut, a key turned in the lock, while the white figure turned and fled down the passage, as a flash of lightning threw its ghostly outlines into weird relief, and a crash of thunder followed.""Didn't I hear him speak? It was a man's voice. Some man, for purposes of his own, is masquerading as a ghost, and he probably tried to frighten Mollie and the rest of us to keep up the reputation of the mansion for being haunted. If none of you are going back, I'll go alone!""Betty started down the hallway, and her example was one of the things needed to infuse courage into the others. Not that Cousin Jane especially needed it, for she had already made up her mind, as had Betty, that something must be done, and that soon.""Hush!"" cautioned Mrs. Mackson. ""Probably the poor child has fainted, and can't hear us. It's enough to make any one faint. But I'm sure this is the room,"" and she indicated the one she had pointed out. ""We must break down the door and get her.""Through the old house there once more sounded that mournful groan, chilling the very blood of the girls, and causing them to cling together. Several times were the groans repeated, and then there shone, as if from a distance, a bluish light, and there came the clank of metal.""It was the wind--that is still blowing,"" insisted Mrs. Mackson. ""Don't be frightened, girls. We must get Mollie out of that room. She has certainly fainted, and when she comes to she will be horribly frightened if we are not with her. Try the door again, Betty."""
"""Then we must stop him!"" cried Betty. She turned toward the front door, but a short distance away. The others hurried on after her and saw, out in the road, the dim outlines of a carriage. There was a driving-light on the dashboard, and by its gleam the girls could make out the dark form of a man alighting. Mollie tumbled in a heap on the floor of the room, into which the white-robed figure had thrust her. She gasped once or twice, for her breath had grown short, not alone from fright--though she admitted that she was terribly scared--but from the rough treatment she had received. Then, as she endeavored to get to her feet in the darkness--for her lantern had fallen from her hand and been extinguished--she fainted, and fell back. Her heavy mass of hair, uncoiled and loose, served as a cushion, and so saved her as she crashed backward.How long she remained in this condition she could not afterward tell, but it could not have been for long, since she was strong and healthy, and it was merely a case of overwrought nerves, and a severe mental shock, which did not amount to anything serious.Poor Mollie heard the ringing of innumerable bells as if from some land beyond the clouds. Queer lights, even in the darkness, seemed to dance before her closed eyes. She felt a pressure, a sense of suffocation--this was the stagnant blood resuming its circulation.""In the first place,"" she reasoned, ""I am not seriously hurt. That fellow, whoever he was, just thrust me into this room. And it was no ghost, either,"" she went on, as she felt her arm, which she was sure had been bruised by the grasp of the mysterious one. ""I'd better make a light, I think. Then I can see where I am. Oh, but what can have happened to the others? I hope he didn't get them, too!""It was the work of but a few seconds to set aglow the extinguished lantern, and how Mollie blessed the thought that had prompted taking both side lights with them. Otherwise she would have had to remain in the gloom. The lantern had not broken in the fall, and soon a cheerful glow made the room less gloomy, though it was a large apartment, and there were many flickering shadows, while the corners seemed in total darkness.Flashing the light about the room, the girl-prisoner made it out to be a large apartment, void of anything save a few broken sticks of furniture, and a litter of papers. The paper on the walls was mildewed and hanging in strips. There was a damp and musty smell in the place, but--joy of joys to Mollie--no rat holes. The floor was solid, and she could see no openings where the creatures might get in.And so she sent out a ringing cry for her chums. But the room had thick walls--the door was a solid one, and, as Betty, Amy, Grace and Mrs. Mackson were having a surprising time of their own just then, they did not hear the appeal.""In the first place, let me think how I got here,"" she mused. ""Something in white grabbed me, and thrust me here. It was a very human touch--depart the ghost theory. I believe, after all, that Mr. Lagg was right--it is some one trying to make out that this place is haunted in order to get it for a lower price. The food supply proves that, I think."
"""Anyhow, here I am--pushed in by some man masquerading as a ghost. That much is certain. And what was it he said, as he caught hold of me--'So you have come back!' That is all I remember. This would seem to indicate that I had been here before, and that he was either expecting me, or wanting me.""A case of mistaken identity, at all events, for I never should have come back, had I been here before, and that I was never here before is positive. Come, Mollie, we are getting on in this deduction business. Some one mistook me for some one else, and that shows that it is not really me who is wanted. That's good.""But why should I wait for that man to come back?"" she asked herself. ""There might be trouble when he discovers that I am not the person he thinks me. He may be angry. And, though doubtless Betty and the others will do all they can for me, I had better see if I can help myself.Mollie went quickly over the different happenings of the night, and tried to figure out a reason for the various ghostly manifestations. That they were the work of some one endeavoring to depreciate the value of the property, she was certain.""That man may have hired some girl who looks like me to help him,"" she thought, ""and she may have become afraid, or worried, and left. Then I have to blunder in here, and in the dark he takes her for me. I'm sure that's it.""She approached the casements, realizing that as she was on the ground floor the sills could not be very high from earth. But though she saw that the catches on the frames were broken, and though she managed to raise one sash, it was with a jolt of disappointment that she saw the windows were heavily barred.Mollie placed it between two of the bars, and pried. She was strong, and it did not take all of her muscle to force the ends of the rods from the rotting wood of the sill. A child might have done it. In a moment she had a space sufficiently wide to enable her to get out.""Perhaps that man went for some vehicle in which to take me away!"" thought the girl, aghast. ""I had better not go out! What shall I do? My light! I must put it out, or he'll see me,"" and she turned the flame of the lantern down, leaving herself in darkness."
"""Well, there really have been some strange goings-on here,"" said Betty, standing in the doorway with her chums. She looked out at the weather. It was not raining much now, and the thunder and lightning had about ceased.""Suppose you explain,"" proposed Mr. Blackford. ""I happened to be in this part of the country looking after some of my business interests. I was delayed longer at one place than I expected to be, and got caught in the storm. When I came past this house I thought I would see if I could not be accommodated over night, for my horse was tired and needed stabling. Instead I----""They all went outside. The rain was but a mere drizzle now. The fury of the storm had passed, and the night was becoming calm. The old house, and the mansion beyond it, which could now be seen dimly back of a fringe of trees, was silent and seemingly deserted, even by the ghost. There were no more queer blue flames, no more hollow groans and clanking noises.""We had better not all go under that window at once,"" suggested Mr. Blackford, as they neared the casement with the bent bars. ""Let me go alone, with the light, and I'll see if I can make out any footprints.""""Only for a short distance,"" answered Mr. Blackford, as he flashed the rays of the lamp to and fro. ""Then comes grass, and I am not sufficiently good on the trail to track a person over grass. However, we are sure of one thing--that she got out of the room herself, and ran off. She was not carried away.""The girls told all that had occurred--told it in gasps--by exclamations--by ""fits and starts,"" as Betty expressed it. At first Mr. Blackford was amused--then he was more interested--finally he was impressed.""I don't like this,"" he said, when he had been informed of the failure of Mr. Lagg to dispose of the property because of the ""ghostly"" manifestations. ""It looks to me as though some trick was being perpetrated here. Possibly something more than a trick. There may be crimes contemplated. The authorities should be notified.""Of course I don't believe in ghosts--neither do you--and, from what you say, it must have been a very human one who caught Miss Billette. But she is our most important consideration now. We must find her! We must search outside, for clearly she is not in the house, though it will do no harm to take another look."""
"""Certainly we'll go back there and look,"" spoke Mrs. Mackson, in business-like tones. ""Though I don't believe Mollie would go back, unless it was to look for us. And how can she have gone in without us seeing her?""Fortunately, Betty had a good sense of direction and could lead the way, flashing her lamp at intervals. Mr. Blackford had proposed that some of the girls wait while he drove one of them to the stalled car in his carriage, it holding but two. But the girls refused to consider this, wishing to stay together.""If I had known it I would not have been so frightened,"" remarked Mollie. ""As it was, I put out my lamp, and then, when no one came for me, I decided to jump out. It was not far to the ground. Then I ran, and at first did not know what to do. Then I decided to try and find my auto. I must have blundered into the road, but I got here at last. I was going to hide in the car, and I wanted to leave some sort of a light on it so no one would run into it in the dark.""""No,"" answered Mollie. ""You see the room is some distance from the front of the house. And I was too frightened to know what I was doing. Besides, I fainted, at first, you know. And I thought you girls would run when--when you saw that white thing that grabbed me. I was disappointed when you were not at the auto here.""""There!"" he exclaimed, when, by the light of a held-up lantern, he had made the necessary adjustment. ""We will see if it won't go. Of course you can't use the self-starter, since your storage battery is out of order, but we can crank up in the old-fashioned way.""""The car generates its own current when it is running,"" said Mollie. ""But to-day I have been running on an extra battery, as something seemed to be the matter with the other one. T must have it looked to.""""I think I will drive on to the next town also, since it has stopped raining,"" went on Mr. Blackford. ""I will see you in the morning, and we'll talk over this business some more. I want to lay that ghost if we can. You'll get to the town ahead of me in your car."""
"Four weary and much exhausted girls, and a rather used-up chaperone, were soon enjoying the comforts of the hotel. They had 'phoned on ahead for rooms that morning, but the proprietor had about given them up. However, it was only eleven o'clock.Morning, as Betty put it, ""dawned clear and bright,"" and with it came refreshment to the Outdoor Girls. They almost forgot the terrors of the night, and when Mr. Blackford met them in the parlor, he having arrived about an hour after they did, he found a very different set of young ladies.""I am!"" declared Mollie. ""I think that ought to be investigated. The authorities should be notified, not so much for what happened to me--to all of us--as because of what might happen to others. Then there's poor Mr. Lagg--he'll lose what money he put into that property if the value goes down because of the ghosts. I say let's try to discover the secret.""""Yes, indeed, thanks to the way you girls helped me out by finding my five hundred dollar bill. But this is not business. I don't mind telling you that I am seeking for a long-lost relative--a sister--and I have engaged a firm of private detectives to look for her. They just sent me word that they are on the track of a person who may be the one I have been looking for so long. So, under the circumstances----""""Then suppose we meet here, say a week from to-day, and try for the ghost secret. By that time I may have found my sister, or have suffered another disappointment--and there have been many of late,"" and he sighed.The week that followed was a busy one for the Outdoor Girls. Mollie had her car put in perfect order, and they toured over many miles of splendid country. They had minor happenings and adventures, but nothing of moment, if we except a few punctures and a blowout. Oh, yes, they did run over a dog, breaking the creature's leg. But it was the dog's fault, and Mollie steered out of the way so quickly that she nearly sent the auto into a tree.The Outdoor Girls, with Mrs. Mackson and Mr. Blackford, had reached the so-called ""haunted mansion."" The day was a sunny one, perhaps that added to the lack of nervous fears they felt as they stopped the auto, and entered the place. This time they had gone to the mansion proper, having driven through what were once beautiful and extensive grounds. But they had long since fallen into a tangle of weeds and shrubbery.During the week that had intervened, the keys of the place had been secured from Mr. Lagg. He was delighted that the girls had finally consented, through a chain of circumstances, to investigate the queer manifestations.""You'll do better than the boys, I'm sure,"" said the storekeeper. ""Anyhow, they've gone camping. Now find out what that ghost is, and--get it out of there. I have received word from the doctors who want to use the place as a sanitarium, that if I cannot, within a week, deliver them the property with a guarantee that there will be no disturbances, they will take another place."""
"They entered the old mansion. Truly it had been a magnificent place in its day, and even now the hand of decay had touched it but lightly. With a few repairs, some decorating, a cutting down of the trees that were too thick about the place, it could be made into a most cheerful sanitarium.""And it's so big!"" cried Grace, as she wandered about the spacious rooms. But she had hold of Amy's arm, it might be noticed, and both girls kept rather near to Mr. Blackford. He had come back unsuccessful in his search for his sister.They did this, ascending by means of the grand staircase to the second floor, and thence to the third and fourth. The latter contained but few rooms, mostly for storage, it seemed, and it was soon evident that no ghost--of the human kind at least--had been at work here. The dust and grime of years had accumulated in the apartments.The third floor offered no solution. This was rather larger in extent, and contained many guest-rooms. Some showed evidence of having been beautifully decorated, being paneled in tapestry that now hung in shabby strips--a relic of former beauty.It was not until the second floor was reached that anything like a promising clue was found. Meanwhile many queer nooks and corners had been explored. Mr. Kenyon had evidently built the house after his own eccentric ideas, for it contained strange rooms, connecting with one another by little, unexpected passages, short flights of stairs, and many winding ways. Some of the rooms might well have been secret ones, so strangely were they tucked away.But in two apartments on the second floor--two rooms that had evidently been choice guest chambers--the searchers came upon signs which indicated clearly that some one had been in them recently. There was less dust, and in one corner was a pile of bags and rags that seemed to indicate a bed. On the hearth--there were big fireplaces in each room--were ashes that had been hot not many days gone by.""Well, all we have established so far,"" said Mr. Blackford, ""is that someone has been sleeping here. Now let's keep on to the annex, and see if we can establish a connection. It may be that the secret is there.""They found the passage that led from the mansion to the house in which so much had happened to them that stormy night. There was a room in the main house, whence the passage began, and this room, too, showed signs of having been used recently.""I confess I am baffled,"" he said. ""I did hope to find something. But we haven't come across it. If there was a systematic effort to give the impression that this mansion was haunted, there would have been some evidences of it.""I mean we would have some material evidence. There would have to be some way of producing that bluish light, that groaning sound and the clanking of metal. But, unless the apparatus is more cleverly hidden than I suspect, it isn't here."""
"They all ran to where Mr. Blackford's voice sounded. It was in the very room where Mollie had been held a prisoner. And there, in the center of the apartment, supported in Mr. Blackford's arms, was a girl. At the sight of her Betty cried:""Of course I'm sure!"" declared Betty, as she advanced to assist Mr. Blackford in caring for the girl, who lay white and senseless in his arms. ""You'll be sure, too, as soon as you take a good look at her. Isn't that hair evidence enough?"" and she let some of the girl's luxurious tresses, that had come unbound, slip through her fingers. ""And see her face--and there's the scar she got when she fell from the tree. Of course it's the same girl!""""My--the man who calls himself my guardian, but who has used me very cruelly,"" she said. ""I ran away from him, and then I learned that there might be a way to escape him forever. I came back to get certain papers--but I heard noises in the old house, and----""""We hope you won't go until you have told us a little something about yourself,"" said Betty, with an inviting smile. ""We don't want to pry into your private affairs,"" she went on, ""but we would like to help you. And please don't disappear so mysteriously again. You are the girl who fell out of the branches of a tree; aren't you?""""Yes,"" and she smiled faintly, ""I am Carrie Norton. I knew you as soon as I saw you all again. Oh, please don't think harshly of me, but I have been so worried I did not know what I was doing. I have always regretted repaying your kindness so shabbily, but really----""""Oh, yes, much. I am not given to fainting. It was just fright that made me call out when I heard the noise you made, and then I went over--all got black before me. Oh, I am feeling stronger every minute.""""I went up there to hide from my guardian, or the man who calls himself such,"" said the girl. ""I suppose it seems strange, but really that was the only thing I could think of. And it was not hard to get up, for the branches were low. You see I had just run away from him, from this very house, when he brought me here, and said that it was to be our home."""
"""I don't know Mr. Lagg,"" said the strange girl, with a shake of her head. ""But I'll explain in sections, as it were. My name is Carrie Norton, and my guardian is Samuel Clark. At least, that is his right name. He goes by several, according to the nature of the business he is in.""""He is queer,"" agreed Carrie Norton, ""and not altogether honest, I fear. To be brief, when my parents died, several years ago, he assumed charge of me. He had been associated with my father in business, and he said the will provided that he was to be my guardian. I was too grief-stricken to question that, but I was shocked when, instead of having a comfortable fortune, as I supposed, there was little or nothing, and Mr. Clark said I must go about the country with him, helping him sell goods. He was a sort of commercial traveler, dealing in different things at different times.""""Finally we came to this section, and one day he came to this house. He said he owned it, and that we were to live here. I saw that it was deserted, and I made up my mind I would not stay. The very next day, when he was making preparations to remain over night, I ran away. Oh, I was so lonely. I did not care what became of me. Then I thought I saw him coming down the road after me, and I went up in the tree.""Perhaps I was foolish, but I scarcely knew what I was doing. I guess I must have fallen asleep, for I was in a comfortable position, and I had lost much rest of late. Then I heard an auto horn--I thought all sorts of things--I awoke with a start, and fell out.""""No, I was just stunned by the fall. When I woke up, and found myself in that farm house bedroom, I did not know what to think. One idea possessed me, that I must get away--that I would not go back to him--my guardian. So I slipped away, and I have been wandering about ever since. I managed to get enough office work to help support me, for I am a business college graduate and I had a little money of my own with me. Sometimes I stopped at hotels, and again at boarding houses. My one idea was to keep away from that man.""""Yes,"" Carrie admitted. ""I had written one I intended leaving for--for that man. Then I decided not to and I tore it up just before I got out of the window. I suppose I must have dropped a piece. It was a letter saying I would never come back to Shadow Valley."""
"""A little while ago,"" resumed Carrie, ""I read something in a paper referring to my case. It was a legal notice asking for news of my whereabouts, and saying I would hear of something to my advantage by calling on certain lawyers with papers to prove my identity. At first I feared this was a trap on the part of my guardian, but I inquired and learned that the law firm was a reputable one. There is a Mr. Allen Washburn connected with it.""""So I decided I would go see those lawyers,"" went on Carrie. ""But first I wanted the papers. My guardian had them, but I recalled that the day we came here he placed them on the mantle in this room. I came back to get them, but they were gone, and then I heard a noise--I fainted--and, well, here I am, and you are here too, I see.""""I was here only part of one day,"" she said. ""I am glad it was not dark--I should have been afraid. Oh, it must have been terrible for you to have been caught by--by that man!"" she said to Mollie. ""Who could he have been?""""I am just wondering if it could have been your guardian,"" said Mollie, a strange look on her face. ""He said something about me having 'come back.' Girls, I'm sure that was it!"" she cried. ""He took me for Carrie, with my long hair----""It was while autoing toward the town of Franklin, on their way to Deepdale, that the girls saw on the road a farmer standing beside a carriage with a broken axle. The man was ruefully contemplating the damage.""Yes, I am; after as slick a swindler as has been around these parts in a long time. He done me out of a bunch of money not long ago, and only a little while ago I got word that the same man is peddling stuff in Franklin. I hitched up, as soon as I could, intending to go to Franklin and have him arrested. But this pesky axle had to break, and now I can't go on. It's the only rig I have, too. I heard that the fellow intends to go out on the noon train. Then I may never hear of him again.""""There's no 'phones around here, and if I did it would be hard work to hold him. There'd have to be a warrant, and I'd have to swear to a complaint. My mere word over the wire wouldn't be enough, I'm afraid. And it's near noon now. I don't know what to do."""
"""What will you do with your horse and carriage?"" asked Mr. Blackford, when the girls had made different seating arrangements to accommodate Mr. Bailey, the farmer. ""It won't do to leave it on the road; will it?""""No, I'll have to fix that some way. We can't very well take it along with us. But here comes Jim Bates. He'll look after my nag for me. Hi, Jim!"" he called as a man came driving past in a dilapidated wagon, drawn by a bony horse, ""Jim, jest look after my outfit; will you? Maybe you can leave it in Pierce's barn until I come back. That isn't far. Pierce is away, but his wife will let you, I guess.""""Yep. That's how I was swindled,"" he explained to our friends. ""This faker come along with a wonderful soap. It would take the spots out of everything--even the sun, he said. It did do good work when he manipulated it. Well, I was foolish enough to give up some of my hard-earned savings for the secret of how to make the soap. I bought the stuff he told me, but the soap was a failure. He swindled me. Now I'm after him.""They started off, the farmer going into details of how he had been swindled. He was very thankful for the unexpected ""lift"" given him, and declared that he would not have known what to do had not the auto come along.They saw a crowd of people in the square in front of the court house. In their midst stood a man on a raised platform--a platform gay with flags. His strident voice could be heard extoling the merits of his wares. The auto came nearer. The vendor's face could be plainly seen. Several things happened at about the same time, and so quickly that the girls confessed afterward that they were fairly dizzy. Consequently they were not altogether sure of the sequence of events themselves."
"Naturally the attention of Mr. Blackford, and the girls, was first drawn to Mr. Bailey, the farmer, who was shaking his fist at the man selling tooth powder on the platform. His announcement that this was the man he sought was sufficiently dramatic.The man on the platform turned pale, and then a sort of sickly green color spread over his face. He had caught sight of the farmer standing in the auto. Perhaps he also had had a glimpse of Carrie Norton. At any rate he said:""And now, my dear people, I must leave you. This is the last chance you will have to purchase Tuckerman's Tooth Tester at this price. I thank you one and all for your attention, and for your patronage. I must leave at once. I have been summoned by telegraph to attend a conference of the International Dental Society, who wish to purchase the secret of my wonderful invention. I will bid you good-day,"" and he started to descend from his platform.""No, you don't!"" cried Mr. Bailey. ""No, you don't get away like that! The dental society kin wait until you pay me back the money you swindled out of me on that soap deal! Hold him, somebody, until I kin swear out a warrant. I've caught you, old fellow!""""You will have one in five minutes!"" said Mr. Blackford. ""I tell you to hold that man. Mr. Bailey, get to the nearest justice of the peace as soon as you can. Swear out a warrant and have it brought here. Officer, arrest that man!""""He's arrested on the charge of assault and battery!"" she called in her fresh, strong voice. ""I make the charge, Girls!"" she exclaimed, turning to the others, ""that's the man who thrust me into that room, and locked me there. That's the ghost. I recognize him by the scar on his thumb!"""
"Then as the girls in the auto stood up, the better to see, Carrie was revealed. The faker, closely held by the constable who had arrested him, and by a brother officer who had hurried up, gave the strange girl one look. Then those who were near him heard him mutter: Betty furnished the next sensation. As the man in charge of the officers passed near the auto, poor Carrie cowering away from him, though he no longer had it in his power to harm her, the Little Captain exclaimed:""Yes, and since the girls recognize him for what he was part of the time--a seller of hair tonic--I will explain a little further. He made me pose in his cart, before the crowds, as one whose hair had been restored and made long by his worthless stuff. Oh, it was shameful! That is why I ran away from him!""""I never used a drop of it! Neither did he. It was trash! He used to make me shake down my hair before the crowd, and then he would tell how I used to have none at all, but by using his medicine it came. I always had nice hair, before I ever met him! Oh, I can't forget it!"" and she sobbed a little.And it was, as far as any further charge the faker had over Carrie Norton. Allen Washburn came on with the papers in the case. It seems that a distant relative of the girl, learned in a round about way that Clark, or Bennington, to use but two of his names, had forged certain documents in order to make it appear that he was her legal guardian. This gave him control of Carrie, and her money, a tidy sum left by her father. The girl he compelled to accompany him on his vending trips, but when he went into the making of worthless hair restorer and obliged her to pose as having benefited by it, she finally rebelled.This distant relative, wishing to aid the girl, took the matter up with a law firm, happening to hit on the one where Allen Washburn was employed. The newspaper advertisement was inserted, and at last had its effect.The facts in the case were presented to the court after the faker's arrest, and the judge lost no time in deposing him as Carrie's guardian. He was obliged to give up the money he had wrongfully retained, and Allen Washburn was, much to Carrie's delight, appointed to look after her affairs.""He must have mistaken you for me,"" said Carrie, as they talked over the thrusting of Mollie into the room. ""Seeing you in the house whence I had fled, and with your hair hanging down, he made a natural mistake, thinking I had come back to him.""""No, he had no intention of being a spook, but he could not have done it better had he planned it. I have been talking to him,"" and Mr. Blackford nodded in the direction of the court house. ""He made a clean breast of everything when Allen hinted that it might have a good effect when he came to be sentenced."
"""It seems that he manufactured his hair-tonic in the haunted mansion. It was necessary to heat it in a sort of furnace, and this made the groaning sound you heard, it was caused by air pressure. Sometimes it groaned and again it shrieked as the hot air rushed from the ventilator.""""That was the burning of sulphur which he used in the preparation. Sulphur is often used in hair-tonics I believe, though I don't know that this man used it to any advantage. At any rate he burned it, making the ghostly flashes of blue fire, and the smell. The flashes were reflected from the room where he worked into the smaller house, by the big window panes.""""That was a big white garment he put on to avoid soiling his clothes when he made his hair-tonic mixture. And he really did mistake you for Carrie, Mollie. He admitted as much, and asked to be forgiven. It was his lunch you ate. He had prepared for a long stay in the house.""""No, and never was. It was simply the making of his hair-tonic there nights that produced the effect. He says he never even knew that the doctors who were to buy the place were frightened away, and the night you girls stopped there he thought you had, as was the case, taken refuge from the storm. He did not know he had frightened you, but when he saw Mollie he made a rush for her, thinking she was his ward, come back. He locked her up, intending to come for her later, when he had taken off the furnace some of his boiling mixture.""And so was the poetical store keeper himself, when he heard the news. He composed an eight-line verse on the subject, and insisted on rewarding the girls, saying it was due to their efforts that the ""ghost was laid."" He received a substantial sum for the old mansion, which was turned into a sanitarium.Eventually the false guardian was sent to prison for a long term, on several charges. Mr. Bailey was not the only farmer he had swindled, it appeared. The fellow had unexpectedly come to the old mansion, and had boldly decided to use it for his purposes, learning that the title was in dispute. It just suited his needs, and the hair-tonic was not the only nostrum he made there after Carrie ran away. But the tonic was alone responsible for the queer sounds and manifestations. On leaving the mansion to go about peddling his wares, the man would take his apparatus with him in the wagon, so there were few signs of his occupancy.Mr. Blackford bade the girls farewell a few days after the explanations had been made, saying he was going to look up a new clue regarding his sister. Carrie Norton was made welcome at the home of Betty, though she often stayed for weeks at a time with the other chums. She had income enough to support her now that her fortune was restored to her.These are the tales of the various adventures participated in by a group of bright, fun-loving, up-to-date girls who have a common bond in their fondness for outdoor life, camping, travel and adventure. They are clean and wholesome and free from sensationalism."
