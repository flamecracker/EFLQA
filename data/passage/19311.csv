passage
"Grace Ford tried to repress her emotion, but the cause of her tears was evidently too recent, or the effort at self-control too much for her, for she gave way to another outburst, sobbing this time on the shoulder of Betty Nelson, who patted her sympathetically, and murmured soothingly to her chum.""Here come Amy and Mollie,"" went on Betty, as she glanced from the library window and saw two girls walking up the path opened across the lawn through the mass of newly fallen snow. ""Do you want to meet them, Grace; or shall I say you don't feel well--have a headache? They'll understand. And perhaps in a little while----""""But what does it all mean, Grace? I can't understand. Is anyone dead--or--or hurt?"" and Betty Nelson, who had called at the house of Grace to talk over plans for a dance they were going to attend the following week, looked anxiously at her chum. Only the day before Grace had seemed like her nearly-always jolly self. She and her three chums, including Betty, had been down town shopping, and Grace, as usual, had indulged in chocolates--her one failing, if such it can be called.""Now look here, Grace Ford!"" exclaimed Betty briskly, pausing a moment on her way to the door. ""You just stop this! If no one is dead, and no one is hurt, then it can't be so very dreadful. You just stop now, and when we all get together we'll help you in whatever trouble you have. You know that; don't you?""""It certainly is. Look in the glass if you don't believe me. There--take my chamois and give it a little rub before I let in Amy and Mollie. It's only nice, clean talcum--you needn't think it's powder.""""Gracious, you'd think someone was going to be hanged, or beheaded, or sent to the galleys for life--or some other dreadful thing such as we read of in our ancient histories,"" commented Betty. ""Cheer up, Grace. There may be worse to come.""""Oh, it isn't so cold. You don't feel well, that's all. Hello, Amy--Mollie. Come in!"" she greeted the other girls, at the same time endeavoring by nods and winks to convey some idea that all was not well with Grace.But if Betty hoped to convey a quiet intimation that something out of the ordinary had happened she did not succeed. In her eagerness to warn the newcomers not to ask questions she overdid it, and succeeded only in making them alarmed."
"""Why don't you, yourself, Betty Nelson?"" demanded Mollie Billette, quickly, her dark eyes flashing. ""You meet us as if--as if something terrible had happened, and because we live up to the part, and behave ourselves, you----""Then Amy stole softly up to her, and, reaching up her arms, tried to put them around Grace's neck. But Grace was tall, while Amy was rather short, so the little act of kindness could not be carried out.""Don't mind them, Amy,"" said Grace quickly, as she turned about, placing her own arms around the other. ""I know I am too tall, and I seem to keep on growing. Hello, Mollie dear. I'm so glad you came,"" and she kissed the two newcomers.""Uncle Isaac himself told us,"" resumed Grace, after a pause. ""As for how it happened we don't know yet. Uncle Isaac is on his way now to give us some particulars. He just telephoned to mamma, and that is what upset us all. I have sent for papa to come home from the office. He will be here to meet Uncle Isaac I hope. Oh, isn't it dreadful!""""But perhaps it is only some boyish prank,"" suggested Betty hopefully. ""What are the particulars? Perhaps he has only gone off with some friends, and will come back again, just as he did the--other time.""""The other time,"" as Betty called it was rather a delicate subject with the Ford family, for Will with some chums had gotten into a little difficulty not long before this story opens, and the present complication was an outcome of that. I shall describe them in order presently.""No, I don't believe it is a prank this time,"" went on Grace. ""He has been gone some time, and we never knew it until Uncle Isaac mentioned it casually over the telephone. Oh, I wish he would come! We can't do a thing until we hear the particulars. Then papa will start an inquiry, I think. Poor Will! I hope he is not--not hurt!"" and again Grace showed symptoms of tears.""Oh, I'd feel dreadful, of course. But Paul and Dodo get into so many scrapes,"" she added, with a curious shrug of her shoulders, in which she betrayed her French ancestry--""so very many scrapes, my dears, that we are past being shocked."""
"""Not a word, and that makes it seem all the worse. If we only had some word--something to go by, we might not feel so bad. But it came like a bolt out of a blue sky--what Uncle Isaac telephoned about an hour ago. He is down town attending to business, and he said he'd come up as soon as he could. He was surprised himself, to know that Will was not home.""""Well, the boys didn't like him from the very start,"" proceeded Grace, ""and I guess he didn't like the boys any too well. They played some tricks on him, and he retaliated by doubling up on their lessons. Then one night he was kidnapped--taken from his boarding place and hazed. It was nothing very bad, but the faculty held a meeting, and voted to expel all the boys concerned in it. Will was one, and papa was so angry that he said he would punish Will in a way he wouldn't forget. He said he'd take him out of school, before he'd have him expelled, and make him lose a term.""So poor Will was given his choice of starting the study of law in papa's office, or going to work for Uncle Isaac Ford--papa's brother. Uncle Isaac has a big cotton mill down in Atlanta, Georgia, you know. Papa thought it would be a good thing for Will to see what hard work meant. At the same time it would take him away from Deepdale, and out of the influence of some of the boys who were responsible for the hazing. I don't believe Will was one of the ringleaders.""""We don't know the particulars,"" said Grace. ""We supposed up to about an hour ago, that Will was in Atlanta, though we wondered why he didn't write. But then he never was very good at sending letters. Then came this 'phone message. I answered and I was surprised to hear Uncle Isaac speaking.""'Why, isn't he down in your mill?' I asked. Uncle Isaac said he was not--that Will had not come to work one morning, and had left a note saying that he was going to quit. Of course Uncle Isaac thought Will had come back home. But when I told him we had not seen my brother, why, Uncle Isaac was as startled as I was. He said he'd come right up here and tell us all he knew.""""There he is now!"" cried Grace, glancing out of a window. ""And he has papa with him. He must have stopped at the office. Oh, I'm so glad papa is here!"" and she hurried to the front door to let them in."
"""Oh, father!"" gasped Grace, as she slipped into his waiting arms. Hardly a greeting did she give to Uncle Isaac, but perhaps this was on account of having spoken to him over the telephone shortly before. ""Oh, father! Where is poor Will?""""Yes, I allowed that was the best procedure,"" said Mr. Ford Sr., he being the elder brother of the father of Grace. Uncle Isaac spoke with a slight Southern accent, but not very pronounced, since he had lived most of his life in the North.""Well, if there has, he brought it on himself,"" said Uncle Isaac sharply. ""He had a good place with me, and he could have stayed there and learned the business. Instead of that he chose to act like a----""As Betty looked out of a crack in the library door she made up her mind that Mr. Ford's brother seldom did anything ""between meals."" He seemed to be a man who lived by hard and fast rules, and he had not the most kindly face and manner in the world. He was quite a contrast to Grace's father.""Excuse me!"" interrupted Uncle Isaac. ""I'll meet them later, after your father and I have straightened out this tangle--if it can be done. I'll sit in the parlor, though I'm not used to it. No use wearing out the best carpet. Is anyone in the dining room?""The initial volume of this series was ""The Outdoor Girls of Deepdale; Or, Camping and Tramping for Fun and Health,"" and in that was related how Betty, Amy, Mollie and Grace had gone on a walking trip, and how they solved the strange secret of a five hundred dollar bill.The second book brought our heroines into the midst of summer, and also saw them started on a voyage in Betty's motor boat. This book, called: ""The Outdoor Girls at Rainbow Lake; Or, the Stirring Cruise of the Motor Boat _Gem_,"" had to do, in a measure, with a curious happening on an island, following the strange loss of some valuable papers, when a horse Grace was riding ran away with her. And how the papers were recovered--but there. It would not be ""playing the game"" to go into details now.""The Outdoor Girls in a Motor Car; Or, The Haunted Mansion of Shadow Valley,"" was the third book of the series. As the sub-title indicates there really was a house where strange manifestations took place, and when Mollie was captured by the ""ghost,"" her chums were very much alarmed.The adventures of our friends in the touring car, which Mollie owned, carried them well into Fall, and when the first snow came, and the girls had the chance to go to the woods, they took advantage of the opportunity. In the fourth book, ""The Outdoor Girls in a Winter Camp; Or, Glorious Days on Skates and Ice boats,"" there was related how a certain property dispute, involving Mr. Ford, was settled through good luck favoring the girls. Also how Amy was claimed by a brother, of whose existence she was unaware.The girls, as I have intimated, lived in the city of Deepdale, in the heart of the Empire State. Deepdale--Dear Deepdale as the girls called it--lived up to its name. It was a charming town, with some country features that made it all the nicer. It nestled in a bend of the Argono River, a stream of some importance commercially."
"The four girls I have already named--Grace Ford, Mollie Billette, Betty Nelson and Amy. In the first volume the latter was Amy Stonington, but a mystery concerning her had been solved, and a brother who had long sought her, at last found her. He was Henry Blackford, who was concerned in the five hundred dollar bill mystery, and he recognized Amy as his sister in a peculiar way. So Amy Stonington became Amy Blackford, and Mr. and Mrs. John Stonington, instead of being her uncle and aunt, were mere strangers to her.No, not mere strangers, either, for they had not brought her up from a baby to so easily relinquish her now. They could not bear to give her up, and as she had no other relatives, except her brother, as far as she knew, and as he had to travel about considerably in his business, Amy remained with those she had so long regarded as her parents. She was very glad to do so.Betty was the only child, while Grace had, as I have mentioned, a brother Will. Mollie had a small brother and sister--the twins, Dora (or ""Dodo"") and Paul. Her mother was a well-to-do widow, and the parents of the other girls were wealthy, but made no display of their means.As I have noted, Will's foolish prank had brought its punishment, though perhaps he did not merit it as much as did some of his chums. One, Frank Haley, had been expelled, and another had been suspended for three weeks. But to Will would seem to have come the heavier punishment, now that he was away from home, no one knew where.""Will stayed at my home, you know,"" went on Uncle Isaac. ""I did the best by him I knew. I didn't let him out nights, I made him read good and helpful books like 'Pilgrims Progress,' and others of the kind, and I kept him from the moving pictures.""And he had packed up his things and left,"" went on Uncle Isaac. ""I was dumbfounded, I was. I didn't think it was much use to hunt for him as I thought he'd come right home. He had some money--you know you gave him some.""""Well, something will have to be done,"" said Mr. Ford with a sigh. ""Isaac, let's talk this over, and see what we can do. I may have to go to Atlanta to straighten this out. I don't believe Will would deliberately set out to cause us worry.""Her father and uncle left to go to Mr. Ford's private office in the house, for he was a lawyer, and kept a large library at home. The girls sat in the main library, looking at one another with sad eyes.""I don't know whether this will be pleasure or not,"" went on Amy with a blush, ""but Uncle Stonington (I'm going to call him that, though he is no relation)"" she interjected, ""Uncle Stonington has bought an orange grove in Florida, and we can have all the oranges we want. If that's good news,"" she finished. Amy's announcement--unexpected as it was--had two effects. It dispelled, for a time, the gloom that had come with the news of Will Ford's disappearance, and it gave the girls something to talk about, to speculate over and to plan for."
"""I must confess,"" admitted Betty, ""that our strenuous life this Fall and Summer, living in the outdoors, has unfitted us for the hum-drum sort of existence that used to satisfy us. We seem to want some excitement all the while now.""""But it must be perfectly lovely in Florida now,"" spoke Grace, who found that by joining in the conversation she did not think so much about her missing brother. ""The weather there in our winter season is delightful. Where is Mr. Stonington's orange grove, Amy--near Palm Beach?""""Uncle Stonington said he would be glad if I could take you girls,"" said Amy. ""He got the grove through some sort of a business deal. He doesn't know anything about raising oranges, but there are men in charge who do. There is quite a big sort of place--a ranch I believe they call it.""""She is not at all well,"" spoke Amy. ""Uncle Stonington is quite worried about her. I think when it came to getting the orange grove he took it as much on her account as on his own. The doctor said the air down there would do her good.""""Well, I don't see anything to do but to take a trip down there,"" he said. ""When I'm on the ground I can decide what course to take. Writing is only nervous work. And yet I don't see how I can spare the time now.""""No, no!"" exclaimed Mr. Ford, quickly. ""I think Will has been punished enough. I want to get him home, and then we'll map out a course of procedure. Perhaps I gave him too heavy a sentence,"" and, almost unconsciously, he glanced at his brother.""Well, I must think about this Southern trip,"" went on Will's father. ""Why, you girls look as though you had been talking secrets!"" he exclaimed, not wanting to inflict too much of his family troubles on the visitors.""Mr. Stonington has purchased an orange grove in Florida,"" Betty went on, ""and Amy has asked us all down there. Do, please, say that Grace can go!"" and she blew him a kiss, for the four chums shared their parents and friends as they did their--well, let us say--chocolates.""Florida,"" spoke Mr. Ford, musingly. ""I wonder if, by any chance, Will could have gone there? Many young men go down South in the winter to work as waiters in the big hotels. But I hardly think he would be so foolish. Well, of course if Grace wants to go----"""
"""Oh, I'll find him. He has just gone off on some little trip, perhaps. Very likely he has written to us and the letter has miscarried. Or he may be carrying it around in his pocket, thinking he has mailed it. Yes, I think you may go, Grace, if the others do. Don't worry about your brother. We'll have trace of him soon.""""A good idea. I wish I could go. And it is fortunate that, on account of a change in the school system, you will not miss a term."" For following a shift in the educational work of Deepdale, had come a reconstruction of the system. The outdoor girls were sufficiently advanced to permit of their taking several months' vacation, and still remain up to the standard required by the State regents.""Well, let's get down to my office,"" suggested Will's father, after a pause. ""I'm going to have my hands full. To trace a missing boy--though really I don't imagine that will be serious--and have a daughter go to Florida is 'going some,' as the boys say. But I guess I can manage it. Now, Isaac, if you're ready----"" Grace's announcement caused a flutter of excitement among her chums, and Mr. Ford's face showed his pleasure and surprise. But a moment later he had steeled his features into a non-committal mask, for he was really much provoked by his son's conduct, and if this was an appeal for forgiveness he wanted to be in the proper censuring attitude. At least so he reasoned.""We'll see you again, Grace,"" spoke Betty, as she led the way for the other two girls to follow. She felt that the family might like to be by themselves while perusing the first letter from Will since his latest escapade.""Oh, don't go!"" exclaimed Grace, guessing her chums' intention. ""Stay and hear what Will has to say. I'm sure papa would want you to,"" and she looked at Mr. Ford, who was nervously tearing open the envelope. His brother was watching him anxiously, but it was not a kindly look on Uncle Isaac's face.At first, when it seemed as if something seriously might have happened to Will, the elderly man was rather alarmed, thinking perhaps he might be blamed. Now that a communication had come from the youth, seeming to indicate that all was well with him, his former employer was ready to deal harshly with him. He was even meditating what form of punishment could be applied, and he planned harder tasks for him, in case his father should send Will back to the cotton mill in Atlanta."
"""Yes, stay, by all means,"" spoke the younger Mr. Ford, in rather absent-minded tones, as he flipped open the letter. ""We have no secrets from you girls, and if you are going to Florida, and Will is in that neighborhood, he can take a run over and see you. Let's see now; what does the rascal say?""There was a caressing note in the father's voice in spite of the somewhat stern look on his face, and he slowly read the letter, half aloud. The girls could catch a word here and there. Grace was leaning forward expectantly, her lips parted. The strain had told on her, and her eyes were still red from the tears she could not hold back.""All right, Grace. But nothing much seems to have happened to him so far. Hello, what's this, though? 'Going to strike out for myself. Can't stand Uncle'--um--'will write particulars later--I have a good chance for an opening'--I wonder if it's as a waiter in some Palm Beach hotel? 'There may be a good thing in this. I can learn the business, the agent says'----""""Yes, and if he says anything against me, don't be afraid to come out with it,"" interjected Uncle Isaac. ""Will and I didn't get along well--that's no secret. He didn't like work, and he didn't hesitate to say so. I've no doubt he had hard feelings against me, but I say here and now that I treated him as I would my own son. I made him work harder than I would my own son, in fact, for I felt that I had a duty to do by Will.""""Well, to be frank with you, Isaac,"" spoke Mr. Ford, ""the boy says that he did not like the life in the factory. But I did not suppose he would. I did not send him there to like it, but I thought the discipline would do him good. However, he seems to have struck out for himself.""""There now,"" he said, soothingly. ""It seems to be all right, and Will is in no danger. All your tears were wasted. To be brief, he writes that he did not like the work in the mill, and getting a chance to go to Jacksonville, Florida, he took it and went without the formality of a good-bye.""""He writes that he has a chance to get in with a concern that is going to develop some of the Everglade lands,"" went on Mr. Ford, referring to the letter. 'The company plans to drain the swamps, and grow pecans, oranges and other tropical fruits and nuts.' Will says he was offered a sort of secretaryship to one of the developers, and took it."
"""Will says,"" he went on, again referring to the letter, ""that he is sorry he went off in the abrupt way he did, but he felt that it was the only method to pursue. He says he feared you would stop him, if you heard about it, Isaac.""""And as the opportunity had to be taken up quickly, or be lost, Will went away in a hurry,"" continued his father. ""He says he wants to show all of us that he can make his own way in the world, if given a chance, and he doesn't want to come back until he has done so. He thinks he has had enough of school. He sends his love to--to all of us--and his mother, and says he will write again soon, and run up for a few days' visit as soon as he can get the time.""""Either Will carried that letter around in his pocket after writing it,"" said Mr. Ford, ""or he dropped it in some obscure postoffice where their cancelling stamps are worn out and letters go only once a week or so. The letter was written on the night he left your house, evidently,"" he said to his brother, indicating the superscription. ""I guess the mails down your way are not very certain, Isaac.""""And I guess I'd better telegraph Will some money while I am at it,"" his father said. ""He writes that he has plenty of cash, but his idea of a lot of money is a few one dollar bills and a pocket full of change. I'll wire twenty-five dollars to him in Jacksonville to come home with."" ""And to think that in a few more days we'll leave all this behind us--all the cold, the icicles, the snow, the biting winds--leave it all, and sail into a land of sunshine and oranges and Spanish moss and magnolias and----""""Alligators!"" finished Betty for Grace, who was thus going into raptures over the prospect before them, as she looked over the wintry landscape that was in full view just outside the window of Amy's home. I say Amy's home, for, though it had developed that she was no relative of Mr. and Mrs. Stonington, still they insisted that she call their home hers as long as she liked. So it was at Amy's home, then, that her chums had gathered to talk over the trip to Florida.""Oh, I just can't bear cold weather!"" said Grace, with a shiver, and a look toward the chair on which, in a fluffy pile, rested her furs--and Grace looked handsome in the sable set that her father had given to her at Christmas.""Don't pour cod liver oil, whatever you do,"" said Grace, quickly. ""I had to take some of the horrid stuff the last cough I had, and I can taste it yet. Where are my chocolates? Oh, thank you, Amy,"" as the latter passed them over. ""Have some. These have maraschino cherries inside.""""What to wear!"" exclaimed Amy, with a bright thought. ""You see we'll have to take two sets of clothing. One to wear until we get to Florida, and the other after we arrive at the orange grove. We'll need thin things there. Aunt Stonington is making me up some pretty voile and white muslin dresses."""
"""We can stay as long as we like,"" said Amy. ""Uncle Stonington says he'll remain until Spring, anyhow, for the business will take until then to get going properly. Then, too, he is anxious about Aunty's health. The doctor says the longer she stays in a mild climate the better she will be.""""She doesn't look very well,"" spoke Betty in a low voice. Mrs. Stonington had greeted the girls as they came to call on Amy, and had then gone to lie down. The callers had all noticed how frail and worn she seemed. Perhaps the shock of almost losing Amy had something to do with it. But there also appeared to be the seeds of some deep-seated malady present in her system. And a look at Mr. Stonington's face told that he, too, was worrying. But the trip to Florida might work wonders. They all hoped so, at any rate.""There are. The grove is near the town of Bentonville, on the Mayfair River, which empties into Lake Chad, so I think there will be plenty of chance to go boating. The grove is in the Indian River section, where some of the finest oranges grow.""Discussing what they would take in the way of dresses, and other feminine accessories, talking over prospective trips in the motor boat, speculating as to whether Will or any of his boy chums would go to Florida for a brief visit, made the winter afternoon pass quickly.They all were, it developed, and on the way Betty stopped at the railroad freight office and arranged to have a man sent to the boathouse to crate the _Gem_. Then it could be taken to the railroad on a truck.""And what will we do with it when we get to Bentonville?"" asked Amy. ""It does look so big out of the water,"" for, after the visit to the freight office they had gone to where the _Gem_ was stored in winter quarters.As the girls walked with Grace toward her house, the Ford home being the first on their way, they saw a messenger boy with his little black-covered book and a bunch of telegrams just turning into the gate.""There's a message!"" exclaimed Grace, breaking into a run. ""I want to take it from him before he rings the bell. Mamma is so nervous at the sight of a telegram. She always thinks the worst thing has happened. I suppose this is from Will, saying he is on his way home. Poor boy! he has had a lesson."""
"""Nonsense!"" answered Grace, as she tore open the message, which was addressed to her father. She felt she had a right to do this, as, had it been some business communication, she argued, it would have gone to Mr. Ford's office. Grace felt sure it was from her brother. ""Cannot locate Will Ford at Jacksonville address given. Am holding the twenty-five dollars subject to your order. Party was at address noted, but information to our agent here is to effect that young man left in company with a labor contractor who does not bear a very good reputation. Young man's boarding mistress worried. What shall we do?""""In the first place,"" she said, ""you mustn't let your mother know about this, Grace. You must keep it from her. In the second place your father must be told at once. Now you go in and act as if nothing had happened. I'll go see your father.""""Then Mollie or Amy must go in with you, and help to keep up appearances. Amy, you go in and talk--play--sing--dance--do anything to keep Grace from feeling bad, and giving away the secret. As soon as Mr. Ford comes he can decide whether or not to tell his wife. Mollie, you and I will go down to his office. This is the night he gets home late; isn't it, Grace?""""Well, we'll soon have him home,"" declared Betty. ""Now you two do as I tell you. Talk about Florida--anything but what has happened. Mr. Ford will know what to do when he comes. Now, Mollie, let's hurry. Gracious! I believe it's going to snow. Well, we won't have any of that in Florida, that's a blessing for you, Grace,"" and Betty smiled bravely.The two set off through the gathering storm, while Grace and Amy turned into the former's house. They were under a strain, and afterward they hardly remembered what they did. But Grace did not betray the secret, at any rate. The two girls talked of many things, and when Mrs. Ford referred to the home-coming of her son Amy changed the subject as soon as she could."
"""Oh, she is brave,"" said Amy. ""Besides, nothing very dreadful can have happened. Will may be all right. Even if he has gone off with a labor contractor, who has a bad reputation, your brother is able to look after himself. He can appeal to the police, if necessary.""""I think it will be better. Will may do something rash, thinking he is putting through a fine business deal. I don't want him to get into--legal difficulties. It would not look well for my professional reputation,"" and Mr. Ford forced a laugh to reassure his wife.Arrangements for going to Jacksonville were soon made, as he was to leave on the midnight train. In the meanwhile he communicated with the telegraph authorities in the South, telling them of his plans, and asking for any additional information.All that he could learn was that Will had gone to the address given in his first letter--a private boarding house. He had been there a few days, making friends with the landlady, and finally had gone off with a man who bore a shady reputation in the city. Will had said he was going farther into the interior, and the woman thought she heard something about a lumber camp, or a place where turpentine and other pine-tar products, were obtained.There were three weary days of waiting, relieved only by brief messages from Mr. Ford, saying that he was doing all he could to find Will. Mrs. Ford was not told the whole story, save that her son had gone into the interior.""Oh, I'm sure something must have happened!"" exclaimed Grace, when on the fourth day there came a message saying Mr. Ford was on his way back. ""He hasn't Will with him, or he would have said so. Oh, isn't it perfectly terrible!""""Now, don't worry,"" advised Betty. ""I know that is easy to say, Grace, and hard to do. But try. Even if your father hasn't found Will, perhaps he has some trace of him. He would hardly come back without good reason.""""Well, by getting in with this developing concern. It seems that he signed some sort of contract, agreeing to work for them. He supposed it was clerical or secretary's work, but it turns out that he was deceived. What he signed was a contract to work in one of the many camps in the wilds of the interior. He may be getting out cypress, or turpentine."""
"""I know it, my dear,"" replied her father. ""But they have him in their clutches, and possession, as you know, is nine points of the law, and part of the tenth. Where Will is I don't know. Just as the message said, he went off with that smooth talker, and he seems to have disappeared.""""I'm going to have your Uncle Isaac trace him. He knows the South better than I, and can work to better advantage. That is why I came back. Uncle Isaac is in New York City now. I am going to telegraph him to come on here and I'll give him the particulars. Then he can hunt for Will. Poor boy! I guess he wishes now that he'd stayed in the mill.""The news was broken to Mrs. Ford as gently as could be, but it nearly prostrated her. Then Uncle Isaac came, and to his credit be it said that he was kinder than his wont. He seemed really sympathetic and did not once say, ""I told you so!""It was in the shape of a letter from a Southern planter, who said one of his hands had picked up the enclosed note in a cotton field near a railroad track. It had probably been tossed from a train window, and had laid some time in the field, being rain-soaked. It bore Mr. Ford's address, and so the planter forwarded it. The note was as follows: ""DEAR DAD: I certainly am in trouble. That development business was a fake, and I have literally been kidnapped, with a lot of other young fellows--some colored. They're taking us away to a turpentine swamp to work. I've tried to escape, but it's no use. I appealed for help to the crowd, as did some of the others, but the contractors declared we were a lot of criminals farmed out by the State. And, as a lot of their workers really are convicts, I had no show. I don't know what to do--help me if you can. I don't know where they're taking us, but if I get a chance I'll send word. I'm scribbling this under my hat in the train, and I'm going to toss it out the window. I hope you get it. Grace was in tears when her father finished reading Will's pathetic letter. Nor were the eyes of her chums altogether dry, for they all liked Will, who seemed as much a brother to them as he did to his own sister."
"""No, I do not believe they are,"" said Mr. Ford, frankly. ""The State would not let contractors hire them if they were. I suppose they are mostly young men who have been guilty of slight violations of the law, and hard work is the best punishment for them. But I certainly am sorry for Will.""I certainly shall, daughter,"" and Mr. Ford put his hand on Grace's head, now bowed in grief. ""I will write to Uncle Isaac at once, and have him get in touch with the authorities. They should be able to tell where the different gangs of prisoners have been sent, and by investigating each one we can, by elimination, find Will. Then it will be an easy matter to get him home. And I think he will be very glad to see Deepdale again, in spite of the fact that he wanted to start out for himself to 'make good.' I hope the lesson will not be too hard for him.""""Tut--tut!"" exclaimed Mr. Ford, with a laugh, something he had seldom indulged in of late. ""We couldn't get along without our girls. You can offer sympathy, if nothing else, and often that is something as real as actual service. But I don't agree that you girls are helpless. You have proved in the past that you outdoor lassies can do things, and I would not be surprised in the future if you gave further evidence of it.""""Well, things are certainly taking a queer turn,"" said Grace as she looked at the scribbled letter of her brother, so strangely forwarded to them. ""There is no telling how long ago this was written. Poor Will is probably having a hard time this very minute.""""He probably is if he's at work in a turpentine camp,"" said Mr. Ford. ""It is no easy work, and it is no wonder the contractors have to take criminals, and fairly kidnap their helpers. Then they have to literally mount guard over them to force them to remain. But I must start things moving to aid Will.""""But you girls must not let this interfere with your trip, nor with the enjoyment of it,"" said Mr. Ford, who had told his wife something of the truth, but not enough to cause her to worry. He said they had word from Will, and hoped soon to have him home. And Mrs. Ford, who leaned much on her husband and daughter, was more content than she had been. ""Get ready, Grace,"" said her father, ""and enjoy your winter in the South.""Though Mr. Ford had set in motion various forces, no definite word had yet been received. But they were hoping that every day would bring some message. Uncle Isaac wrote that he was doing all he could."
"Frank Haley, Will's school chum, and Allen Washburn, the young lawyer, were very anxious to start off and make a search for their friend. But Mr. Ford, though deeply grateful to them, thought it might complicate matters. So, much against their desire, the two young men were forced to remain in Deepdale.The next day Mollie telephoned for all of her chums to gather at her house for a sort of farewell tea some of the friends of the girls wished to tender to them. It was a cold, snowy, blustery day, and as Grace, wrapped in her furs, walked shiveringly along with Amy and Betty she remarked:They found Mollie in the midst of showing some of her new gowns to her friends, and the three chums joined in the admiration. For Mollie, with the characteristics of a French girl, loved pretty clothes, and rather inclined to a pronounced style not indulged in by her chums. But she always dressed becomingly.""Not for where we are going,"" was the answer. ""You forget that we are going to a summer land. Oh, Dodo--stop that!"" she cried, for from the room where stood Mollie's half-packed trunk came the twin, trailing a garment. ""That's my best petticoat!"" wailed Mollie. ""You'll ruin it. And Paul! What are you doing with that shirtwaist--it's my very finest lawn!""""You wouldn't say so, if they did this--or something like it--to you three or four times a day,"" exclaimed Mollie, half-crossly, as she advanced to rescue her garments. But the twins backed away, stepping on the skirt.The little tea was a success, in spite of the invasion of the twins. The girls were bidden farewell by their friends--rather envious friends, to be frank--for who would not envy one a trip to sunny Florida with its flowers in the midst of winter?The motor boat had been crated and shipped. Mr. Stonington had arranged his business for a long stay in the South, and all was in readiness for the trip. The girls had decided on a hundred and one things to take with them, and had rejected as many, only to make new selections. But finally even their exacting tastes were gratified, and satisfied, and their trunks were ready to go.""She seems very weak. Uncle is quite worried about her, though the doctor says the change will benefit her as soon as we get there. But I am afraid about the trip, though we are to go in a compartment car, and won't have to change.""""And poor mamma is not herself,"" murmured Grace. ""Lack of news from Will seems to prey on her mind. But there! don't let's talk any more about our troubles. Let's look on the bright side of the clouds. I'm sure we ought to just hug Amy to pieces for giving us this nice trip."""
"""Worse and worse,"" protested Mollie. ""We'll have the fauna and flora of Florida hopelessly mixed before we get through. Now let's see if we have everything packed,"" and they went over their list of belongings for the tenth time.But all things must have an end, and so did their preparations. The day of the start came, final good-byes were said, and with Mr. and Mrs. Stonington the four outdoor girls took the train for the Sunny South.The girls and Mr. and Mrs. Stonington were driving in a big canopy-topped carriage along a Florida road, toward the orange grove on the outskirts of the town of Bentonville. Their journey was over and at last they were in Florida.Their trip had been practically without incident, and certainly without accident. There had been one or two delays, caused by various small happenings, but finally they had steamed into the junction station, where they took a way train for Bentonville.The snow, the cold and biting winds had gradually been left behind, and Nature, coy and uncertain at first, had, with the advance into the South, grown bolder. They had come from the land of bleakness and barrenness--from the place of leafless trees--into the region of Summer, almost in a day and night. They had exchanged snows for flowers.Mrs. Stonington had stood the trip well, though a trifle weary and worn as the end of the journey came in sight. But the warm and balmy air of the South seemed to revive her, and her cheeks, that had been pale, took on a tinge of color.""Bress all yo' hea'ts!"" she exclaimed. ""Climb right down, and come in yeah! I's got de fried chicken an' corn pone all ready fo' yo'all. An' dere's soft crabs fo' dem as wants 'em, an' chicken-gumbo soup, an'----""Let us pass over that first meal--something that the girls did not do by any means--but the mere details of our friends arriving, getting settled, and then of resting to enjoy life as they had never enjoyed it before, can have little of interest to the reader. So, as I said, let us pass over a few days.Each one, it is true, brought something new and of peculiar interest to the girls, but it was only because they had never before been in Florida. To the residents it was all an old story--even the picking of oranges.They puffed along, to the wonder and admiration of many of the colored pickers, who stopped to look--any excuse was good enough for stopping--especially the sight of a motor boat. Suddenly Grace, who was trailing her hand over the stern, gave a startled cry, and sprang up.""'All's well that ends well,'"" quoted Betty, as she turned the boat nearer shore. ""Some day we must take our lunch, and have a picnic ashore. See the lovely Spanish moss hanging down from the trees. It's like living history over again. Just think of it, how Balboa came here and discovered the land, and----"""
"She pointed to something long and dark floating in the river--something that seemed to be covered with scales and ridges--something that suddenly turned up an ugly head, with bulging eyes, which looked fishily at the girls in the boat.Not knowing the character of the stream Betty did not want to venture to far. So, after going down about a mile or so, she turned the boat and headed up stream. They passed a number of small boats, manned by colored boys who were fishing, and the youngsters suspended operations to gaze with mingled wonder and fear at Betty's swiftly-moving craft.But Grace was so nervous that night that she did not sleep well, and Mrs. Stonington grew quite alarmed. Perhaps it was as much worry over the fate of Will, as the recollection of her escape from the alligator, that disturbed Grace.Will seemed to have been taken into the interior of Florida, and there lost. There were so many turpentine camps, or places where contract labor was used to get out valuable wood, or other products, that a complete inquiry would take a long time.Mrs. Ford was as well as could be expected, Grace's father wrote, though naturally very much worried. And Grace was worried too. If she could have engaged actively in a search for her brother perhaps she might not have fretted so. But it was harassing to sit idly by and let others do the work.Betty was sending her boat ahead at good speed, scanning the shores of the river for some quiet cove into which to steer. The day was warm, and the sun shone down unclouded. From the banks came the odor of flowers.""A--a sand bar,"" faltered Grace, sinking back among some cushions that matched her dress wonderfully well. Mollie said later that Grace always tried to match something, even if it was only her chocolates.""A plain, ordinary sand bar,"" repeated Betty. ""One of the men at the dock warned me about them, and even told me how to locate them, by the peculiar ripple of the shallow water over them. But I forgot all about it. Oh dear!""""It isn't that--no indeed. I meant Amy--for bringing up such a topic as alligators at this moment, when we can't move. And the ugly creatures always come out on a sand bar to sun themselves; don't they?""""Is it a baseball engine?"" asked Grace languidly. She seemed to have recovered her composure now. Whether it was the fact of her chocolates being safe, or that there was no immediate danger of sinking, or that no alligators were in sight, was not made manifest, but she certainly seemed all right again.""It's enough of a ball game to have a base, and to be obliged to hold it,"" said Betty with a smile, as she bent over the machinery, testing the bolts and nuts that held the motor to the bottom of the boat.""I guess it's all right,"" she added with a sigh of relief. ""Now to see if it will operate. But first I think we'd better see if we can push ourselves off with the oars and boat hook,"" for Betty, knowing that the best of motors may not ""mote"" at times, carried a pair of long sweeps by which the _Gem_ could laboriously be propelled in case of a break-down. There was also a long hooked pole, for landing purposes."
"""Mollie, you take one of the oars, and I'll use the other,"" directed Betty, for she realized that she and the French girl were stronger than the others. ""We'll let Grace and Amy use the hook. Then if we all push together we may get off without further trouble. If that won't answer, we'll try reversing the engine."" The machinery had been shut down by Betty immediately following the sudden stop on the bar.About the stranded craft swirled the muddy river. Bits of driftwood--logs and sticks--floated down, and sometimes there was seen what looked to be the long, knobby nose of an alligator, but the girls were not sure enough of this, and, truth to tell, they much preferred to think of the objects as black logs, or bits of wood. It was much more comforting.""Come, girls, if we're going to get off the bar it's time we tried it,"" suggested Betty with a smile. She did not want the two tempers, that seemed often on the verge of striking fire, one from the other, to kindle now. There was enough of other trouble, she reasoned.The oars and pole were thrust into the water ahead of the boat. Bottom was found within a few inches, showing how shallow was the stream over the bar. The prow of the _Gem_ seemed to have buried itself deeply in it.They pushed and pushed and pushed again, but the only noticeable effect was the bending of the slender pole of the boathook on which Grace and Amy were shoving with all their strength. The motor boat did not budge.She sat down in the cushioned cockpit, an example followed by the others. They were breathing rather hard, and presently Betty went into the cabin and came out with some iced orangeade that had been put aboard in a vacuum bottle to retain its coolness.""It's more comfortable here,"" objected Grace, languidly. ""In fact, if it were not for the fact of being stranded I should like it here."" The cockpit was covered by an awning which kept off the hot rays of the sun, and the cushions, as Grace said, were very comfortable.The engine seemed a bit averse to starting at first, and, for a few seconds, Betty feared that it had suffered some damage. But suddenly it began to hum and throb, gaining in momentum quickly, as it was running free. Betty slowed it down at the throttle, and then, looking aft to see that all was clear, she slipped in the clutch that reversed the propeller.""It doesn't seem to do any good,"" wailed Betty, hopelessly, as she slowed down the engine. The water about the craft was very muddy and thick now, caused by the propeller stirring up the bottom of the river.""Never!"" cried Grace. ""I'll stay here until someone comes for us. Say, we haven't called for help!"" she exclaimed, with sudden thought. ""We're not so far from either shore but what we could make ourselves heard, I think. Let's give a good call!"""
"A moment later a motor craft swung into view around an upper bend, coming swiftly down the river. But at the sight of it the girls gave a gasp, for it was filled with roughly dressed colored men, while in the stern sat a white man of even more villainous appearance than the blacks. And the boat was headed straight for the stranded _Gem_. Help was coming indeed, but it was of doubtful quality.They both seemed to depend on the ""Little Captain"" in this emergency. As for Mollie, her dark eyes flashed, and she looked at Betty with a nod of encouragement. Whatever happened, these two would stand together, at any rate.""They are coming toward us,"" added Amy, shrinking closer to Betty. There was no doubt of that. The eyes of all in the approaching motor boat, which was a powerful craft, were fixed on the girls in the _Gem_, and it was a strange sight to see the eyes of the colored men, with so much of the white showing in contrast to their dark faces, staring fixedly at our friends. Grace caught herself in a half-hysterical laugh.""Look natural!"" she commanded to the others a moment later, her voice not reaching the men in the other craft, she felt sure, for the clutch of the relief boat had been thrown out and the engine was racing, making considerable noise. ""Look as though we expected this,"" Betty commanded. ""There's nothing to fear. We are not far from home.""""Lots of folks get stuck on that bar,"" went on the man, who was bringing his boat into a position favorable for giving aid to the _Gem_. ""It ought to be buoyed, or marked in some way. You're strangers around here, I take it,"" he went on.""Just the same. Now, then, I'm going to turn about and try to haul you off, pointing my bow down stream. This boat works better on the direct clutch than in reverse. And when I start to pull, you'd better reverse your motor. Can you do it?""""Oh, is that so! Well, if he should happen to need any pickers, I can supply him. Hank Belton is my name. I supply laborers for lots of orange growers and others. I'm the biggest dealer in labor around here; ain't I, boys?"" and he appealed to the colored men."
"""So just remind Mr. Stonington about me,"" the man went on with what he evidently meant for a friendly smile, but which made the girls shudder. ""My place is at Penbrook--about ten miles up the river. Now, then, have you that rope fast?""""Nary a pay, Miss,"" was his answer. ""I'm glad I could help you. Just give my message to Mr. Stonington, and I'll be obliged to you. Better back down a bit before you turn. That bar sticks out a ways. It's a wonder you didn't hit it before. You can't draw much.""The other boat was proceeding down stream now, the colored men looking back with their rolling eyes. Betty started her engine on the reverse again, and then, feeling sure that they were beyond the bar, she turned and steered her craft back toward the orange grove. The picnic plan was given up now as it was getting late and the girls were tired.""Oh, rough is the worst thing you can say against them. They aren't really bad. Belton has the best supply of laborers around here. Probably he was taking those men down to Hanson's grove. We will need pickers ourselves next week, Mr. Stonington, and I don't believe we can do any better than to get them from Belton.""The next few days were filled with small incidents of little interest. The girls motored about, and did some fishing in the river, catching a variety of specimens, few of which were pronounced fit for the table. But they enjoyed themselves very much.They wandered about in the orange grove, eating as much of the delicious fruit as they chose. Sometimes they took walks with Mrs. Stonington, who was slowly regaining her health. Mr. Stonington was kept busy seeing to the details of the business, that was new to him.""That shows he's in camp,"" said the foreman, as he helped the girls tie the _Gem_. Then they struck off into the interior, not a few doubts tugging at the girls' hearts. It was very wild and desolate, the Everglades being not far distant. Trailing vines hung from great trees on either side of the path. Large bunches of Spanish moss festooned other monarchs of the forest, which seemed gloomy indeed as the girls gazed off into it. Now and then some creature of the woods, disturbed by the passage of the party, would take flight and scurry off, fly away or slink deeper into the fastness, according to its nature."
"""Why not?"" asked Mollie, who was in the rear of Grace. ""I think it is most romantic. Just think--we may be treading over the very ground where de Leon and his men searched for that fountain of perpetual youth.""""Huh! He'd better be careful of what he drinks in these woods,"" said the overseer. ""There's water that's deadly poison, to say nothing of the moccasins and copperheads in some of the swamps. If that fellow is a friend of yours warn him to be careful.""""Oh, well, then that's all right,"" and the overseer seemed relieved. ""Yes, you want to be careful of what you drink in these wilds. Of course a good clear spring is all right, and generally you'll find a cocoanut shell, or something like that, near it to drink from. That's a sign it's good water.""""They call 'em cotton mouths because their lips are white,"" Mr. Hammond explained, ""and it looks as though they were chewing cotton. They're deadly too, and so are the copperheads, which look just like that color. Be careful of 'em.""They went on in Indian file, for the path was narrow. As they penetrated deeper into the interior the woods became more and more gloomy until even brave Betty began to feel a bit doubtful as to the wisdom of coming. But she knew Mr. Hammond could be trusted to see that no harm came to them.""Yes, one of the Seminoles. He's all right, and a friend of mine. Hello, Ko-dah!"" called Mr. Hammond, adding something in a sort of jargon, to which the aged man replied. He seemed more like a negro than an Indian.""We're near Belton's place,"" explained the foreman. ""He keeps quite a lot of hands in readiness, and they pass away the time singing and eating until they're hired. I hope he has some good ones for us. The oranges need picking quickly now.""A minute later the party emerged into a large clearing about which were grouped many huts, in front of which, and lolling in the shade of some, were a score or more of colored men. They set up a call for ""Boss,"" as Mr. Hammond came in sight.""Howdy, Hammond!"" greeted the labor contractor, as he came out of the best-looking house in the clearing. ""Why, it's the girls I hauled off the sand bar!"" he added, as he recognized Betty and her chums. ""Did you get home all right?"""
"""Oh, I forgot,"" called the contractor. ""Young ladies, my wife is up in that cabin,"" and he pointed to the one he had just left. ""She'll be glad to see you and make you a cup of tea. Sue!"" he called, ""take care of Mr. Stonington's girls!"" and a woman appearing in the doorway waved a friendly greeting to the chums.Over the teacups, in a cleaner and neater cabin than one would suspect it to be from a glance at the outside, the girls told of their trip. Mrs. Belton said her husband had told her of their predicament on the sand bar.""I'd like it better if I could find my brother,"" said Grace. ""He's here--lost--in some turpentine swamp, we are afraid. I wonder if Mr. Belton could give us any information, since he is in the labor contracting business?""""Don't you do it, honey! Don't you do it!"" she exclaimed earnestly. ""Keep away from the turpentine camps whatever you do. There's a desperate lot of men there--convicts a lot of 'em, and there's worse men guarding 'em. Keep away if you know what is good for you,"" and she looked earnestly at Grace, who paled as she thought of poor Will. Betty, as well as Grace, Mollie and Amy, seemed much taken aback by the earnest words of Mrs. Belton. The wife of the labor contractor seemed under stress of some excitement, as she faced the girls after the warning.""Don't go!"" she went on. ""Don't any of you think of going! I used to think my husband dealt with a rough enough class of men, but those in the interior--in the turpentine camps, and cypress swamps--oh, they are the most lawless element you can imagine. And no wonder, for no men, unless they are compelled, will work with those contractors. They have to keep their men just like prisoners.""""But perhaps Will isn't treated as the others are,"" suggested Betty, giving the woman a look she understood. ""He went there under different circumstances than the others, and he may receive consideration.""""Of course I don't know all the circumstances,"" went on Mrs. Belton as she nodded at Betty to show that she would be more careful in what she said. ""He may be favored. Of course not all the contractors are cruel, but they have to deal with a bad class of men, and that makes them harsh, perhaps. But take my advice, and don't go near one of those places under any circumstances. Please don't!"""
"""Don't go where?"" asked her husband, coming in at that moment with Mr. Hammond. ""Are the girls thinking of going cruising among the Everglades?"" and he laughed heartily. Betty was beginning to like him very much, as were the other girls. He was rough, and uncouth, but he seemed honest and sincere, and his wife, a hard-working woman, had given of her best hospitality to the visitors.""No, they weren't talking of the Everglades,"" said Mrs. Belton. ""This young lady thinks her brother may have been taken to one of the turpentine camps, or other camps in the interior, and she wants to rescue him. I was telling her to keep away.""""And that's good advice,"" agreed Mr. Belton, more seriously than he had yet spoken. ""I don't mind mixing up with some men, but those contract laborers are pretty bad. My men are nothing to them, though I do get a hard customer once in a while.""""But what can we do?"" Grace besought. ""If Will is there we must get him away! Of course I'm not sure, but papa is looking everywhere for him, and the best clue we got was that he was somewhere in the interior of here.""""Then take my advice, and let the authorities do the searching,"" said Mr. Belton. ""The season won't last much longer, and they may discharge a lot of their men--these contractors may. Then your brother could come out of his own accord.""""We'd first have to locate the camp,"" said the labor man. ""After that we could talk business. It would depend on who was running it, and where it was. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll keep my eyes and ears open, and when I hear anything I'll let you know, Miss. What sort of a looking young man might your brother be?""""Oh, shucks!"" exclaimed the labor contractor. ""Begging your pardon, Miss, for that kind of talk. But you haven't seen anything of the interior yet. There's parts I wouldn't want to trust myself to, not with all of my men behind me, and I'm not a scary sort of an individual, either. There's parts no one has ever been in, I reckon. Don't you say so, Hammond?"""
"Mr. Belton promised to bring a boat-load of laborers to the orange grove in the morning, and as the visitors left they heard the soft strains of one of the negro songs following them through the deep woods. The effect was weird in the extreme, especially when they reached the denser parts of the forest.Good time was made back to ""Orangeade,"" as the girls had christened the bungalow in the grove, the boat running well. Mr. Hammond complimented the girls on the manner in which they ran the craft, each taking a turn at steering, while the overseer imparted instructions as to various sand bars and shallow places along the course.Mr. Stonington was much interested in the report brought back by the girls regarding the lawlessness of the interior camps, and he agreed with Mr. Hammond that if any attempt at a rescue should be made a number of reliable men must be taken along.""And I must write to father!"" exclaimed Grace, ""and ask if he has any clues. He may be able to give us some aid in locating the neighborhood of the camp. Oh, if Will could only know we are here, and would send us a letter! Just think, girls! He doesn't even know we are in Florida!""Glorious were they--those winter days in Florida, where the outdoor girls enjoyed themselves to the utmost. Had it not been for one little rift in the lute, their pleasure and happiness would have been complete--and that rift was the absence of Will. Grace seemed to feel it more keenly as day passed day and no word came.Her father did write saying that the inquiry was progressing slowly, and that it would take some time to have scanned each list of minor offenders who had been ""hired"" out to contractors under an old law, operative only in certain cases. As for naming any special locality where Will might be, that was impossible, as yet.Mrs. Stonington seemed very much improved by her stay in the South, but she was not yet out of danger, the doctor said, and must use care. Her husband and Amy were still anxious about her, and watched her carefully; for, though she was no relation to Amy, she still acted, and in reality was, almost as a mother to the girl.The orange picking was in full swing now, and the girls spent many happy days in the grove. They learned many new ways of eating oranges, and marveled at the difference in flavor of the fruit picked from the trees, from that as they recalled it in the North.The laborers supplied by Mr. Belton had proved to be good workers, and more were sent for, the girls taking Mr. Hammond up to the clearing in the motor boat to arrange about them. Grace hoped to have some news of her brother, but the contractor said he had not been able to get any clues.""Let's go quite a distance up the river,"" she suggested. ""There are new sights to see, Mr. Hammond says, and no bars to run upon after we pass the landing where Mr. Belton docks. We may find some new streams or lakes to explore, for we've been all over Lake Chad."" This was so, the girls soon having exhausted the possibilities of that body of water.The trip was a delightful one, and no accidents marred it. They swept on up the river, which had hardly current enough to be noticeable. They paused to admire pretty spots, and stopped for lunch in a ""perfect fairyland of a grove,"" to quote Amy. The _Gem_ was anchored near an overhanging tree which served to permit the girls to go ashore dry-shod."
"Betty Nelson reached the bank of the river and stopped. She could go no farther for the muddy water stretched itself at her feet. But her boat--the trim little _Gem_--was moving slowly up the stream under the influence of the mysterious something that was towing it away from the girls.""But what can be towing our boat?"" asked Mollie. She stood on the bank, nervously twining her fingers in and out, weaving them back and forth as she always did when puzzled or alarmed. ""Is it the current taking it away, Betty?""""The alligator may be swimming just below the surface,"" was Mollie's opinion. ""He may come up pretty soon, and we can throw stones at it. That's it, Betty. We must stone the creature and make it let go. Come on!""""It isn't going very fast,"" observed Mollie as she watched the boat moving slowly up the river. ""We can run along the bank after it, and maybe the beast will let go, or run ashore with the _Gem_. Then we could get it.""""Then speak of the _Gem_ as 'her' and the alligator as 'it,'"" Betty directed. ""But I believe Mollie's plan is the only one we can adopt. We must follow along the bank. Only I hope, if the alligator does let go, it won't be in the middle of the river, for then our boat would float down, and it might lodge on the other shore. Then we would be as badly off as we are now. Oh, what a predicament! We seem to be getting into nothing but trouble of late.""""A mere accident,"" was Betty's opinion. ""Probably the creature was swimming along shore, and became entangled in our anchor rope. It may be as much frightened as we are distressed. But come on, if we're going to try to get the boat.""""Well, it might be a good plan to try,"" spoke Betty. ""I see what Amy means. When we were little, and used to play with toy boats, if one went out too far we used to throw stones in the water beyond it, and the waves would sometimes send it ashore. Now, if we did that, the alligator might think someone on the other bank was throwing things at him, and he would come over here. It's worth trying."""
"In spite of her protest, Grace managed to do fairly at the stone-throwing. In fact the outdoor girls were what their name implied--they could do many things that outdoor boys could do, and throwing stones was one of their accomplishments. They had not played basket ball for nothing.A shower of missiles fell into the water on the far side of whatever creature was towing the _Gem_. For a few minutes no effect was produced, and then the creature under water did seem to veer over toward the shore where the girls were slowly walking along.There was a swirl in the river just in front of the _Gem_, as though the creature towing it objected to the treatment it was receiving. And then, as the girls, anxiously watching, prepared to send another volley of stones, Amy uttered a cry, and pointed up the river toward a small point of land that jutted out into the stream.The ragged youth looked up, startled, and glanced from the boat, seemingly moving up stream without any visible propelling agency, to the four girls on the shore. He seemed much surprised, and acted, as Betty said afterward, as though he would like to run away. She called to him:The ragged youth now seemed to comprehend what was wanted of him. He poled his clumsy craft toward the _Gem_ and peered down into the water to see what manner of creature was at the other end of the anchor rope. Then he waved his pole at the girls, as though to reassure them, and edged nearer the motor boat. The girls need have had no fears. The youth in the boat seemed to know what he was doing. He was pulling up the anchor rope now, and a moment later he had the grapple in his scow. Then he let his craft slip down stream until he was below the _Gem_ and in a position to tow it.""That's a manatee--a sea-cow, some folks call 'em!"" answered the ragged youth, as he poled his boat toward them, towing the _Gem_. ""They're harmless, but I had to shoot this one to make him let go. I didn't hurt him much. I never see one so far inland as this, though. I'll have your boat there in a minute.""""Yes? That's quite a ways down."" The youth, in spite of his rags, had a good-looking face and a pleasant manner. He seemed restless and afraid, and was constantly glancing about him, as though in fear of seeing someone or something he did not care to encounter.""Would you--I mean, can we do anything for you?"" half stammered Betty. She wanted to offer him money, but she did not quite know how he would accept it. ""If you are going down stream,"" she went on, ""we could take you as far as we are going. If you would come with us, perhaps----"""
"""No, no!"" interrupted the youth, glancing about him nervously. ""It isn't that kind of help. I am trying to help someone else. I--I can't tell you. But I must be getting on. And will you do me a favor?"" he asked suddenly.""Don't tell anyone you saw me,"" begged the youth, earnestly. ""There are those who would stop me--take me back where I came from. They are after me--they may be below me, trying to head me off. If you meet them--meet any rough-looking men who ask for me--don't tell them about me. Don't set them after me, please.""""Then do you think you will be all right?"" asked Mollie. Amy and Grace had taken no part in the talk. They seemed to be content to look at the strange youth who had rendered the outdoor girls such a service.""Oh, yes, I'll be all right,"" was the answer, but the ragged youth looked about him apprehensively. ""I must be getting on now, after help--for him. Don't say you saw me--don't tell them anything about me.""""Thank you--good-bye!"" He stepped into his skiff and quickly poled out from shore, dropping down with the current. The girls gazed after him for a moment. Strangely had he come into their lives, and as strangely gone out, without revealing his identity. And he had done them such a service, too.The _Gem_ was none the worse for her queer tow, and soon, with the girls aboard, was dropping down stream again. The strange youth was not in sight, even when the turn of the river was made, but he may have poled off into one of the many little bayous, or tributary streams, that joined the main one.She stopped suddenly, and stared ahead. There, coming around a turn in the river, was a small motor boat containing two men, who, at the sight of the _Gem_, headed directly for her, at the same time indicating by gestures that they wished to speak to those aboard. ""What shall we do?"" whispered Grace, glancing at Betty, who stood at the wheel, seemingly as calm and unperturbed as though she had the _Gem_ out for a little run on Rainbow Lake. ""Oh, what shall we do?"""
"""That's what I do mean. I don't see why we should halt our boat just because two strange men signal us. Indeed I'm not going to!"" and Betty turned on more power. She gazed straight ahead as though she did not see the men in the approaching craft, who were now wildly waving their hands, and turning their rather disreputable-looking craft in the direction of the _Gem_.Betty never turned her head, but gazed on down the river as though intent on not grounding on a sand bar, or running into an alligator. Her chums followed her example, but Grace could not forbear giving the men one glance.""But you don't understand,"" cried the man, seemingly growing desperate. ""One of our boats was taken last night by a young fellow, and he came down the river. We followed him, but we must have passed him in the night. Now we're on our way back. He may have hid in some bayou, and be on his way down farther up stream. All we wanted to know was if you had seen a tall young fellow, with blue eyes, in a small skiff?""""Why shouldn't they tell?"" asked the first man in a low voice, but he forgot how well even low tones carry over the water. ""They are strangers here I am certain. They can't know 'The Loon,' and so we're perfectly safe in questionin' 'em.""But Betty stayed to hear no more. She opened wide the throttle of her motor, and the _Gem_ shot ahead, leaving the other craft far behind. There was some evidence in the quicker staccato exhaust of the pursuing boat that the occupants tried to get more speed out of her, but they failed, and a little later Amy, turning around, saw them circling back up stream.""I think we will take one of the young men from the orange crate factory,"" suggested Mollie. ""Mr. Hammond will spare us one, I'm sure, and it would be too bad if we had to give up our trips on the river just because some men are hunting a fugitive.""""Yes, that was probably to escape in,"" suggested Grace. ""He was going for help for someone. Maybe a friend of his was hurt. I wish someone could take help to my brother. Oh, it's dreadful to think he may be in need of it, and that we are unable to get to him.""A little later the girls tied up at the orange grove dock. They made light of their adventures, even the one with the sea cow, and did not mention the ragged youth at all, except to say a stranger had recovered their boat for them.For a day or so the girls did not venture far from the bungalow on the river, but soon they tired of comparative inactivity and planned a little cruise, down stream this time, past Lake Chad, and up another river that emptied into it."
"""But you'd better take one of my young helpers along,"" suggested Mr. Hammond, when the girls made known their plan. ""There have been a couple of suspicious characters hanging around of late, and I don't want you to take any chances. I'll give you a young fellow you can depend on.""""Oh, just the usual kind,"" replied the overseer. ""I don't want to alarm you, and you needn't be afraid. They're mostly a cowardly set that always congregate around where a lot of work is going on, hoping to get money without labor, either by some form of chance game, or by deliberately taking advantage of some of the simple-minded colored hands. I ordered these two away a couple of times, and I'll do more than that the next time I see 'em.""""I didn't notice. But they weren't the kind of fellows I want hanging around here, especially when pay-day comes. But don't think any more of what I said. I'm going to give you a young fellow to accompany you. He knows the river and the region around like a book, and anyone who tries to bother you when you're out he'll make short work of. He's a sort of deputy constable.""""Oh, various ways. They might try to sell you a lot of useless trinkets, knowing you're from the North. Fancy shells, sea beans, curios and the like of that. You see, there isn't much ready money floating around among the poor people here. Even some of the scattered Seminoles--or what were once Seminole Indians--try to make a living selling trinkets they make themselves, and if they thought you had money they would become annoying. But Tom Osborne will see to 'em, all right. He knows a lot of 'em. When are you going?""""But maybe we ought not to take him from his work,"" suggested Betty, feeling that perhaps Mr. Stonington would not like the operation of his orange business interfered with by the pleasure of herself and her friends.""You needn't worry,"" spoke Mr. Hammond with a laugh. ""Tom will be glad to come, and the worst of the rush is over now. Just consider him your escort, and he'll do anything you want, from catching an alligator to getting your meals. He's a handy young fellow, Tom is, and he knows all the streams about here.""While the overseer was gone to summon the young man, the girls prepared for the little outing. They had put up a lunch, or, rather, Aunt Hannah, the genial colored ""mammy"" had done it for them, putting in plenty of fried chicken and corn bread.""Of course,"" rejoined Amy. ""You meant it all right. And they may not have been the same ones at all. Mr. Hammond did not say they made inquiries for us, or for that poor young fellow. What was it they called him--'The Duck?'"""
"""Oh, I don't mean it that way,"" said Betty quickly. ""I only suggested that perhaps those mean men--I'm sure they were mean--might have called him that to suit their own purposes. But I think we are well rid of them, anyhow. Here comes Mr. Hammond, and that must be Tom with him,"" and she indicated two figures approaching.""Then we'd like to be your friends,"" said Betty with a smile, and a calm look at Mollie, who was making signs behind Tom's back. Obvious signs they were, too. Betty looked triumphant, as though saying: ""There, didn't I tell you?""Tom Osborne proved that he knew something about motor boats, and was also versed in the ways of making girls comfortable. He asked if they wanted him to steer, and as Betty had not taken her craft down the river very often she agreed. The girls sat on the after deck, under a wide-spread awning, and chatted of the sights they saw.""Now, if you girls want to walk about and see what there is to be seen,"" he told them, ""I'll get out the victuals and set the table on the grass under that tree,"" and he indicated it. ""I'll call you when I'm ready.""Betty and her chums assented, and Tom proceeded to set out the luncheon. The girls strolled on for some distance, and Mollie, attracted by some flowers on the end of a small spit of land, extending for some distance into the stream, walked toward them, the others following.""Why can't you say something less--less scary?"" demanded Mollie who, after the first gasp of fright, had come forward to stand beside Betty. Amy had already shrunk to a place in the rear near Grace. It seemed to be always thus, with Betty and Mollie facing the immediate danger, and Grace and Amy needing protection.Not that they were not brave when occasion demanded it. They would not have been outdoor girls else, but somehow the first fear of something menacing sent Amy and Grace scurrying to the rear, whence it needed considerable persuasion to bring them to the van again.""They won't see you and Grace at all, if you stay behind us,"" said Mollie a bit sharply. ""There's no present danger, as far as I can see. Why don't you come out and help Betty and me throw stones at them?""""Well,"" answered Betty, with a shrug of her shoulders, ""I don't know that a mad alligator is any worse than any other kind. They're all mad, as far as I'm concerned, and throwing stones at them can't make them any worse. I rather side with Mollie. We may drive them away.""""Don't be silly!"" directed Betty in a stern tone. It was sometimes necessary to be severe with Grace when she was likely to give way to her feelings. But in this case Betty did not want to be too much so, for she realized all that her chum had suffered in the disappearance of her brother."
"The two big alligators, and they were exceptionally large, so the girls said afterward, seemed to have taken permanent possession of the narrow neck of land that connected the peninsula with the main shore. The girls were practically prisoners on what, with a rise of the river, would be an island.The alligators evinced no intention of coming forward. They were moving about, seeming to scoop out resting places in the hot sand, on which the sun poured fierce rays. Then, having made themselves comfortable, stretched out at full length, the creatures sunned themselves.Together the girls raised their voices in a shout that must have carried far. They wailed, but there was no response. Then they called again, with like result. The outdoor girls looked anxiously at one another. The alligators seemed disposed to maintain their position indefinitely, and the neck of land was so narrow that the saurians occupied the entire width of it.""Well, here goes!"" cried Betty when it was evident that their calls were not going to be heeded. With that she threw a stone at the nearest alligator. Her aim was exceptionally good. Betty admitted that herself, afterward, the missile falling on the broad and scaly back of the reptile.""No, but I have found a way to get off, and back to the shore without going near those creatures. See! here is a sand bar curving from the side here, right around to that other point of land. You can see bottom all the way to shore. It isn't more than a few inches deep, and we can wade.""""That's so! It can be done!"" cried Betty, taking in at a glance Amy's plan. ""We can wade right along that raised bar. The water is deep on either side of it, but as she says, it is only a few inches deep on top of the bar. Come on, girls,"" and she sat down and began unbuttoning her shoes.""Don't--don't!"" cried Mollie. ""Keep them on. What if we do get wet? Our shoes will soon dry, it's so hot. And there might be crabs or little fishes or--little alligators on the bar. We'll wade in our shoes."""
"Grace burst out crying. She said she knew it was silly, and not at all what an outdoor girl should do, and, very contritely afterward, she told the others how sorry she was that she had given way. But she just could not seem to help it. Without reserve she sobbed on Amy's shoulder.For a moment Mollie and Betty, looking at one another, feared that Amy, too, would give way to her feelings, and that they would have two hysterical ones on their hands. But the little outburst of Grace seemed to act as a sort of tonic to Amy, who put her arms about her chum, murmuring comforting words.No one knew what to answer. Certainly they were in a situation that needed help to enable them to escape from it. They could not approach the alligators--at least they did not think they could, though perhaps the creatures would have fled when the girls came near. And the snakes, while not aggressive, seemed to be numerous in the water that offered the only ford to shore. And moccasins, the girls had been told, were deadly poisonous.""No, there they come back again,"" and she pointed to where the writhing serpents could be seen. Evidently the sand bar was a sort of feeding place for them, and though they might disappear for the moment at some disturbance, they returned.Hopelessly the girls looked at one another. Then they glanced into the water, that seemed fairly swarming with the snakes. There appeared to be more than ever of them. Then Amy looked toward the neck of land and gave a cry of surprise--of joy.The saurians indeed seemed waked into life. Whether they had completed their sun bath, or whether the call of their appetites moved them, it was impossible to say. But they were walking about, dragging their ponderous, fat, squatty bodies, and their big tails.""Let's tell 'em we're in a hurry,"" suggested Betty, as she caught up a stone. Running forward she threw it with such good aim that it struck one of the saurians on the head. With a sort of surprised grunt the creature slid off the narrow neck of sand into the water. The other followed with a splash.Betty said afterward that they had never run so fast, not even at the school games, where the outdoor girls had made records for themselves on the cinder track. Just who reached shore first is a matter of no moment--in fact it must have been a ""dead heat,"" as Tom Osborne said afterward.As the girls passed the place where the alligators had been sunning themselves they gave one look each into the water where the saurians had disappeared. One look only, and they did not pause to do that. But they saw no signs of the ugly creatures.Betty looked all around the little glade on the edge of the river, where the table was set. There was no sign of their escort. The _Gem_ floated lazily where she was moored, and the scene was quiet and peaceful enough. But there was a certain mystery about the disappearance of Tom Osborne."
"But ""between bites,"" as it were, Betty and the others looked about for a sign of the young man. He did not appear, however, nor were there any sounds of his approach. The woods back from the river teemed with bird and animal life. The latter was not so visible as the former, for the feathered creatures flitted here and there amid the branches, bursting into various melodious notes.The meal went on; it was finished. The girls packed up with a little sense of disappointment. They felt that their outing had been rather spoiled. They saved enough for Tom in case he should come back hungry, which would very likely be the case.A goodly packet of lunch was done up, and placed in a tree, well wrapped, where it would be sure to be seen. Then a note was left, with a brief account of what had happened, and the information that the girls had gone back to Orangeade.""He ought to see that!"" remarked Betty, stepping back to inspect her handiwork. She had pinned a small square of white paper, containing the writing, to a sheet of light brown manila, so that it was visible for some distance.The _Gem_ was started and began dropping down the branch stream toward the main river. At least the girls hoped it was the main river when they turned into a larger body of water. But as they puffed on, amid the lengthening shadows, an annoying doubt began to manifest itself in Betty's mind. She glanced at the shores from time to time.""Because this place doesn't look at all like any part of the river we came down before. The trouble was that we let Tom steer, and we didn't notice the course very much, as we should have done on coming in a new channel. But I'm sure we are lost.""""Of course I'm going to try,"" replied Betty. ""But that doesn't mean we'll get there. Often, after you're lost, trying to find your way back again only makes you lost the more--especially with night coming on.""""Well, it's very evident that we're not going the right way,"" went on Betty. ""The farther we go the more sure I am that we were never on this part of the stream before. So I think we had better turn back, and, if necessary, start over again from where we had lunch.""We may be able to see the right turn by starting over once more. Then we will be all right. Once I am started on the right track I think I can follow it. We have a compass, and I noticed, in a general way, which direction we came, though I was not as careful as I should have been."""
"""These rivers are split up into a lot of side brooks, bayous and such things,"" said Mollie. ""Tom mentioned that, and he said that often one could wander about in them being close to the right route all the while, and yet not know a thing about it.""To the credit of the outdoor girls be it said that even in this nerve-racking emergency they did not altogether lose heart and courage. Of course there was that first instinctive fear, and something like a gasping for breath, as when one plunges into cold water. But the reaction came, and the girls were themselves once more--brave and self-reliant.The _Gem_ chugged her way up ""Alligator Brook,"" as the girls had named it. Eagerly they looked for some sign of their missing escort, and listened for any sound that would indicate he was coming to meet them. But the forest was silent. Night was settling down, and birds and beasts were seeking their resting places.They reached the place where the boat had been tied, and could see where they had eaten their lunch. Over in the gloom there fluttered the paper Betty had fastened to a tree to indicate to Tom the fact that his charges had left. For a few seconds it was like a tableau, the strange young man, more ragged than before (if that were possible) standing in the midst of the clearing, and gazing as though spellbound at the girls in the motor boat.The Loon, to give him the title bestowed on him by the men in the boat, hesitated as he caught the sound of whispering. He shifted from one foot to the other, much after the manner of some animal seeking to escape unnoticed.He took a step backward. By this time Betty had brought her boat close to the extending tree branch, where she had made fast before. The power had been shut off and the _Gem_ had drifted to the former mooring place. Now Betty was ready for action.""I beg your pardon,"" she said in a low voice, and with an intonation calculated to disperse the fears of even the most timid youth, ""but will you be so good as to help us again? We are the girls, you know, whose boat you got when the manatee was towing it away.""""We're the same girls,"" went on Betty. ""You know, we saw you poling down the river that day. If you come closer you can see us and make sure. We need help again. We are lost and a friend of ours is missing. Wait, I'll light the lamps,"" and with a turn of the switch Betty set aglow the electric lights, operated by a storage battery.Thus far she had only set aglow one in the after cockpit, and the red and green side lights, together with the one on the small signal mast. Now she flooded the cabin with radiance, for it was getting more and more gloomy in the forest clearing.""Won't you come aboard?"" urged Betty kindly. ""We will do all we can for Tom Osborne if he is in trouble. We can't understand why he deserted us. We have been in much distress, we got lost and had to come back. Come aboard and tell us all about it so we will know what to do. Perhaps you are hungry. We left food there,"" and she indicated it. ""Bring it here, and then perhaps you can take us back to the bungalow. The men there will organize a searching party if need be. But tell us who has caught Tom."""
"""The ones who were after me. There's a camp back there in the woods, and they have him, and the other one, too. I started for help for him long ago, but they got after me and took me back. Then they brought Tom in this afternoon. He saw me and told me to come for you. They didn't see him tell me. We've got to go to the rescue.""""That's it!"" cried the queer youth. ""That's what I've been trying to remember. He told me to be sure and tell you that he didn't run away. He saw you getting flowers, he said, and he went off in the woods a way to look for some rare kind for you. He didn't mean to go so far. Then the men caught him, and took him away before he could warn you. That's what he wanted me to be sure and tell you. Now I've remembered,"" and he seemed quite pleased in his own peculiar way.""Wait, please, wait,"" begged The Loon, again passing his hand over his brow. ""I can't think very fast. I know the bad men in the lumber camp had Tom, and the other one--I don't know his name. But maybe we can rescue them both. If you'll come----"" The Loon stood irresolute for a few seconds. He seemed to want to rush off into the dark woods again, and evidently expected the girls to follow him. But, though they were very anxious to effect the rescue of their friend Tom, and the other unknown, held in some distant camp, Betty and her chums would take no risks.""No, the bosses are getting out a certain kind of wood. Oh! but it is hard work. The wood is partly under water, and the bugs and mosquitoes and alligators are terrible. I ran away, for I couldn't stand it.""""Just like my poor brother Will,"" agreed Grace. ""Oh, I wonder if he could be the 'other one' he refers to! Listen,"" she went on to the simple youth eagerly, ""I am going to describe a young man to you. I want you to tell me if he is like the one you once tried to rescue--the time you saved our boat,"" and she gave a close description of her brother."
"However simple-minded the poor youth might be, however undecided and timid in the forest, he seemed to be a new person on the water. There was a self-reliance about him, a poise and a certain ability that he seemed to have acquired suddenly. Without a trace of hesitation he guided the boat through the winding course of the creek that flowed into the main stream.It was now so dark that the girls could not see just the course taken, and so could not know where it was they had made other mistakes. But the darkness did not seem to bother The Loon. Like the bird whose name he bore he seemed able to see in the gloom as well as in the light.The _Gem_ chugged on through the darkness, making turn after turn, twisting here and there in the water, The Loon seeming to know the channel perfectly. In a much shorter time than the girls had expected they made a turn that a few seconds later brought them out on a broad stream.A few minutes later they saw a sudden glare of light and heard the firing of guns. Then they noticed boats here and there on the stream, each one containing several lanterns, while the occupants were shouting from time to time.""We got lost,"" explained Betty quickly, ""and some men have captured Tom. They are holding him a prisoner in an Everglade camp. This young man can take us back there. We must rescue him,"" and they quickly filled in the other details of the story.""It would be impossible, Harry,"" said Mr. Hammond, gently. ""They might escape in the darkness, and take your friend, and Tom, with them. We'll get ready to descend on their camp at daybreak. That will be best.""After some thought The Loon agreed to this, and those in the other searching boats, one or two of them being small launches, having been informed of the return of the girls, the whole flotilla went back to the orange grove.The Loon was given a place to sleep, and then the girls told more of their story. Mr. Stonington told how, becoming worried over the long stay of the young people, he had organized a searching party, getting more and more alarmed as the hours went by without the return of Betty and her chums.It was rather a restless night in Orangeade, and all were astir early, for they wanted to be at the Everglade camp by daylight. Two extra launches besides the _Gem_ made the trip, the others carrying a number of sturdy men headed by Mr. Hammond. Mr. Stonington went with the girls, The Loon steering.A faint gleam of light was beginning to straggle through the trees when the party, with The Loon in the lead, set off to march to the Everglade camp. There was a narrow trail, and Mr. Stonington insisted on the girls keeping to the rear. Taken by surprise by the sudden rush of Mr. Hammond and his men those in charge of the Everglade camp, and the miserable creatures they held in virtual bondage, offered little resistance. There was neither time nor chance for any.The camp, as the girls saw afterward, was merely a collection of miserable huts. Some were better than others, and it was to these that the rescuers turned their attention, for in them were the ""bosses"" of the camp."
"Mr. Hammond and his men made a rush for these, and, surrounding them, called on those within to surrender. At first there was sleepy-eyed surprise as the rough men ran out. Some showed a disposition to fight, but Mr. Hammond coolly said:In turn every cabin was inspected. Many wretched young men, and some old ones, too, were routed out, but the proprietors of the camp seemed to have a right to their services, either by contract, or through the action of the criminal laws. Sad indeed was their plight, but the rescuers had no legal right to take them away.""Probably an illegal one, if I'm any judge of your methods,"" said Mr. Hammond, grimly. ""I don't blame him for getting away, but I wish we could have rescued him. He may be in a bad plight in this swamp.""An inspection of the cabin where Tom had said some other prisoner had been held showed a board forced off in the rear, and it was evident that the unknown young man had gotten out this way when the guard was asleep--for the camp was kept under guard, so fearful were the bosses that their wretched slaves would escape.""You have my last word,"" said Mr. Hammond, grimly, as the rescue party prepared to leave the miserable camp, ""if you produce that young man I'll do what I can to have the courts deal easy with you. If not--you'll get the limit!""""I tell you he escaped!"" insisted the head of the lumbermen. ""And if you think you can scare us, go ahead. If you hadn't so many with you, and if my men had the spunk of chickens, there'd be a different ending to this,"" he added, vindictively.The girls were permitted a distant view of the camp, and then they started for their boats, Tom in the midst of the girls, explaining to them his seeming desertion. The Loon was worried over his failure to rescue the unknown young man who had given him money. Tom Osborne, on the way back in the _Gem_ with the girls and Mr. Stonington, told his story. He had prepared the luncheon, and, seeing the girls going out on the little neck of land to gather flowers, he recalled seeing some blooms, of the orchid variety, farther in the woods.Thinking to give the girls a surprise, he decided to gather some before they returned. He set off, but the flowers grew farther away than he thought, and before he realized it he was a mile from the glade.""I thought so at the time,"" said Tom, grimly. ""I couldn't imagine why they wanted me, but when they led me off into the swamp I understood. They were after workers, and they'd do anything to get them.""Happily the days are past when such things are done, but a few years ago, before the law intervened, men who were making money by getting valuable timber, and other products, from the Southern forests, stopped at little in order to obtain the necessary labor.Tom was taken to the Everglade camp, which explains why the calls of the girls did not reach him. Strong and healthy, he was a great ""find"" for the unscrupulous contractors, but as he stubbornly refused to work he was made a prisoner in one of the shacks.It was there that he got into communication with The Loon. Poor Harry, wandering about in the swamps and forests in search of the young man who, some time previous, had given him money to go for aid for him, came within talking distance of where Tom was locked up. Tom knew the half-witted fellow, and quickly whispered an appeal to him."
"""I forget,"" he muttered. ""All I know is that I saw him up in the other camp--away off. He gave me money then, and told me to go to someone--I forget who--to send a message over the telegraph wires, you know. He wrote it down, but I lost that and the money. Then I went back, but they had taken him away. I trailed him, though, and found him where I saw Tom. Then I ran to meet you girls. I was afraid, too.""Tom told more details of his imprisonment; how he heard sounds from an adjoining cabin that would indicate some other unfortunate was held there. He heard the men discussing his case, and planning to force him to work in the morning.Without further incident the orange grove was reached. Tom Osborne, tired and worn out, received every attention, and was soon himself again. Mr. Hammond communicated with the authorities regarding the men of the camp, but little could be done. There were legal complications hard to avoid.""No!"" declared Mollie. ""We'll take The Loon along, and he will look after us,"" for Harry was back from one of his wanderings. He spent much time away from the grove, seeking in many strange places for the young man who had appealed to him for help. But he did not find him.They were scanning the shores ahead of them, looking for a suitable place to land and eat their lunch, when Betty, who had taken the wheel, with The Loon to stand beside and direct her steering, uttered a cry and pointed ahead.Thus cried Mollie, who stood at the bow of the _Gem_ with a boathook in her grasp, while the motor craft approached the rude raft on which lay the body of an unconscious youth. Mollie had caught the hook in the edge of the boards and the motor boat was now beside it.There was a moment of hesitation among the girls--a natural hesitation--and then Betty and Mollie with an understanding look at each other climbed from the boat to the raft. It was big and strong enough to support much more weight; for, though it was rudely made, it was substantial, being composed of tree trunks, and boards, bound together with withes, forest vines, and bits of rope.How they got Will Ford aboard the boat the girls could not tell afterward. But they did, with The Loon's aid, and soon he was being given hot coffee. Slowly his senses came back, and when some warm broth had been slowly fed to him he opened his eyes, looked wonderingly about him, and asked hoarsely:Will grew better every minute and wanted to tell his story, but the girls insisted on waiting, except for the most important details, until he had reached the orange grove. To satisfy him, however, they told how they came to be in Florida.That there was surprise at Orangeade when the outdoor girls arrived with Will Ford can easily be imagined. The first thing done was to send a telegram to Mr. Ford, apprising him that his son was found."
"""Then I fell in with a plausible talker,"" explained Will, ""and he persuaded me he had a great scheme for making money. Well, before I knew it I had signed some papers--foolishly. At first I was given decent clerical work to do, and then the scheme failed, I was transferred to another part of the State, and to another company, and in some way, by a juggling of contracts, not knowing what I was doing, it seems that I signed an agreement to work in a timber camp. Say, it was worse than being in prison, and some of the fellows were prisoners, I heard. There were one or two others like myself; but we couldn't get away.""Then I wrote that letter to dad and threw it out of the car window. From then on I've lived a dog's life. I've been a regular slave. Many a time I'd have given anything to be back, even with Uncle Isaac. This has been a lesson to me.""""I thought it was all up with me then,"" he said. ""Before that I had met this chap,"" and he nodded toward The Loon. ""I thought he could help me, and he promised to. I managed to speak to him on the quiet, and gave him what money I had managed to hide away from those slave-drivers. He went off, promising to bring help.""Will related how he had broken from the shack shortly before the rescuers reached the Everglade camp, and how, after much suffering, having previously cut his foot, which made him lame, and wandering about in the woods, he had made the raft and floated down the river. What little food he had gave out, and he had fainted from weakness and exposure just as the girls' boat came in sight.But they had left that part of the State, and could not be traced. One reason, Will thought, why they held him a prisoner, was because they had violated the law in regard to the treatment of the working-prisoners, and did not want to be reported. And the reason The Loon's description of Will gave no clue to the girls was because of Grace's brother's temporary lameness, and his change due to poor living and ragged clothes.Then came happy days. Mr. and Mrs. Ford, rejoicing over the news of their son being found, sent word for him to stay with the girls, and they would join him in Florida. As for the girls--Mollie, Amy and Betty shared with Grace the fun of showing Will about the lovely place where they had spent the winter.The Loon found a comfortable home with one of Mr. Hammond's workers, and made himself very useful about the orange grove. He could not do enough for the girls, or for Will and Tom, the latter two becoming fast chums, as they had been companions in misery.And now the time has come to take leave of the outdoor girls--at least for a time. Perhaps we may meet them again, under other circumstances.
