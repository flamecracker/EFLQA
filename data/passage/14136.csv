passage
"""Goodness, I've been careful so long I'm afraid it will grow on me,"" Mollie Billette, sometimes known as ""Billy,"" retorted, a determined set to her pretty chin. ""Someway, I've got to get it out of my system.""As may have been gathered, Mollie was driving. Amy Blackwell, fearful of an accident, was in the seat beside her, while Grace Ford and Betty Nelson, their beloved Little Captain, occupied the tonneau and amused themselves by laughing at Amy's fears.""Well, but you needn't take it out on us,"" Amy said in reply to Mollie's assertion. ""If you're going to take many more of those two-wheel turns, I'm going to get out and walk. Oh, Mol-lie!"" The speech ended in a wail, as Mollie wickedly rounded another curve, jolting Amy half out of her seat.""I don't know but what I agree with Amy,"" drawled Grace, from the tonneau, helping herself to a chocolate, upon which Betty's eye had just rested longingly. ""I've been bumped around so much I can't tell whether I'm a girl or a scrambled egg. Now, look what you did!"" A sudden lurch of the big car had sent the box of chocolates to the floor, where its contents rolled about aggravatingly at their feet. ""Come back here, Mollie Billette, and pick them up. That's the least--""The rest of the sentence was never uttered, for Mollie brought the car to so sudden a stop that Grace and Betty both lurched forward and narrowly escaped bumping their noses on the back of the seat in front of them.""All you--"" Grace was beginning, striving desperately to recover her breath and her dignity at the same time, the accomplishment of which feat was decidedly retarded by growing indignation. ""Goodness, I never heard such a--""""Just a minute, Mollie, dearest,"" Betty's laughing voice broke in. ""You know I'm not worrying about the chocolates at all, but I'm not particularly anxious to spoil my perfectly good shoes with crushed chocolate or, on the other hand, frump my perfectly good nose in a vain attempt to pick them--""""Goodness, listen to it--"" Grace was beginning, straightening indignantly from her stooping posture and preparing once more to enter the fray. ""When it's all her fault, anyway--"" But Betty upset both speech and dignity by unceremoniously pulling her down again.""Goodness, who'd want them anyway, after they've rolled around and picked up all the dust and millions of germs from the bottom of the car?"" grumbled Grace, cross at having to exert herself to even so small an extent. Grace, as my old readers doubtless remember, had been born with an ease-loving disposition that not even close association with the other Outdoor Girls had served to change. Perhaps, as Mollie had once remarked, that was why the girls were so fond of her--because she was ""so different.""""Well, if you don't want 'em,"" Mollie replied practically, ""why didn't you agree to my proposition? I promised to eat them for you, germs and all, and all I got for my sacrifice was one withering glance--""""At that you're lucky,"" Grace retorted, straightening up from a spirited chase of the last elusive chocolate, red of face and fierce of eye. ""Some time I'll come to the end of my patience, and then, Mollie Billette, you'd better look out.""""If I thought you meant that, I'd say you ought to be ashamed of yourself,"" put in Amy, with unaccustomed spirit, as Mollie threw in the clutch and the big car started off again. ""Anybody that had been as good to you as Roy has been--"""
"""Now, see who's talking,"" chuckled Mollie delightedly, changing into high and driving with wild, care-free recklessness along the smooth road. ""Oh, Betty darling, much as I love you, there do come times when you make me laugh.""""Oh, I didn't mean that way,"" Mollie returned, her eyes once more turning to the ribbon of road ahead while the girls' bright faces sobered thoughtfully. ""Because when it comes to a thing like giving up their lives--well, I think they're the bravest--"" Her voice broke, and in an effort to hide her emotion she nearly sent the car over the side of the road and into a six-foot ditch.""Oh, I guess it isn't that they don't realize it,"" Grace interrupted thoughtfully. ""You know my father always used to say that a man who never knew what it was to be afraid wasn't really brave at all. He said it was the man who was scared to death in his heart, that gritted his teeth and went ahead and faced things anyway, that deserves all the credit.""""I presume that's right,"" said the Little Captain, leaning forward earnestly. ""I don't suppose there is any one in the world who really enjoys the thought of losing an arm or a leg, or being broken in health for the rest of his life. I think what our boys are doing is just to take the fear of that with a smile and go ahead gayly to face whatever may come. Brave--"" Her voice trailed off, and for a long time there was silence while the big car hummed rhythmically along the road and the miles swept by uncounted.""Of course, there are lots of people,"" Betty resumed after a while, ""who say the boys just enlisted for the love of adventure, the love of a good fight, and I suppose that had something to do with it.""""Of course it had,"" Mollie agreed. ""And that's one thing that makes it harder for us who have to stay at home and can't have any of the thrill and excitement that helps to carry the boys through. But it's only one of a dozen reasons, after all.""""Oh, I hope not,"" said Betty, white-faced and pitying, as she bent over the little old woman. ""That man ought to be hung! I'll loosen her collar. And, Grace, see if you can find some water. Hurry, dear.""And while the girls are ministering to the poor little victim of the accident, the opportunity will be taken to tell new readers something about the Outdoor Girls and their activities and adventures in other volumes of this series.Betty Nelson, gay and fun-loving, possessed the natural gift of leadership which had earned for her the title of ""Little Captain."" The girls adored her and followed her unquestioningly wherever she led.Grace Ford was a graceful, tall, pretty girl with a decided and insatiable fondness for chocolate candy. At the outbreak of the war, or rather, at the time of America's entry into the war, her brother Will had caused her great unhappiness by his failure to enlist with the other boys of her acquaintance. The mystery had been satisfactorily explained later, however, and when this story opens, Will was on his way to make a splendid soldier in America's army of democracy.There was a bit of French blood in Mollie Billette, or ""Billy,"" as the girls sometimes called her. Bright black eyes which could, upon occasion, snap fire and a rather unruly temper attested to this French ancestry.The last one of the quartette was Amy Blackford, quiet and retiring, but given to occasional outbursts which never failed to surprise and delight the girls. The mystery which at one time had surrounded her origin had been cleared up some years before by the finding of Henry Blackford, her long-lost brother."
"After this the girls had many adventures, first at Rainbow Lake, to which they went on another tour, this time in an automobile. From there they went to a winter camp where they had many varied and exciting experiences on skates and iceboats. Then followed a glorious trip to Florida, where the girls braved many dangers and took thrilling trips into the wilds of the interior.Then followed that glorious trip to Pine Island. An aunt of Mollie Billette had turned her bungalow over to the Outdoor Girls for the summer. During their strenuous adventures the girls had made many friends among the boys and young men of Deepdale, and four of these had asked and been granted permission by the girls to accompany them to Pine Island and pitch their camp in the woods near by.One of the young men was Allen Washburn, a rising young lawyer and a great admirer of Betty. Another was Will Ford, Grace's brother, and a third was his high school chum, Frank Haley. The fourth, Roy Anderson, had been drawn into the circle chiefly through his admiration for Grace.During that eventful summer on Pine Island the young people had accidentally discovered a gypsy cave, concealed by underbrush, and had succeeded not only in rounding up the band of gypsies but in recovering several valuable articles that had been stolen from the girls.Their last adventure, related in the volume directly preceding this one, and entitled ""Outdoor Girls in Army Service,"" found the girls and boys again at Pine Island, but under very much altered conditions. America had entered the great World War and all the boys but Will Ford had volunteered. Later, the boys were called to Camp Liberty, some distance from Deepdale, and the girls conceived the plan of opening a Hostess House for the benefit of the relatives and friends of the boys. The plan worked out very satisfactorily.While still at Pine Island the girls and boys had come upon a suspicious looking man in the woods. Upon finding himself discovered the man had made his escape, but in his hurry had dropped a letter which the girls found to their disgust was written in code. They decided that the man must have been a German spy.At Camp Liberty the girls succeeded in rounding up the spy, and found, to their surprise, that Will Ford, who was in the Secret Service, had been engaged all that time in tracking him to earth. Will, having accomplished his mission, immediately enlisted.Now, at the time this story opens, the girls were still at the Hostess House and looking forward apprehensively to the time, now imminent, when the boys would be ordered across the sea to fight for the country they loved.""We can at least get her into the car,"" Betty said, indicating the limp little figure in the roadway. ""You take her feet, Mollie, and I'll take her head. We haven't spent all our lives outdoors for nothing.""""Oh, if Grace and Amy would only come!"" Mollie was crying distractedly when the girls themselves burst through the underbrush, crying despairingly that they had not been able to find water, that there was not a house anywhere for miles around.At this spot the road was very narrow and on each side sloped down sharply about ten or twelve feet to the level of the fields. It seemed almost an impossibility to turn the car in that narrow space without precipitating it down either one or the other of the steep banks.""I do,"" answered Betty determinedly. ""Some time we're going to find that fellow and make him pay for what he's done. Think of it!"" she added, turning upon them suddenly while her eyes flashed fire. ""To run down a helpless old woman in the road and then not even stop to find out whether you've killed her or not! We'll find him if we have to search the country for fifty miles around!"""
"The girls never forgot that mad ride to Camp Liberty. Mile after mile sped by on wings, and it was not till they were on the outskirts of the town itself that the victim of the accident showed signs of returning consciousness.When the girls came to know her better they no longer wondered at her quaint and unexpected sayings. But at the moment this queer statement, coming as it did from one who they thought must be hovering at death's door, rather startled them.""I said,"" replied the surprising old woman, in a stronger voice, trying unsteadily to straighten herself in the seat and raising trembling hands to her rather dilapidated old hat, ""that I was sure to come to it some day. There's a fate in such things.""""No, I'm not crazy,"" she assured them, regaining her strength with amazing quickness. ""You see, it seemed kind o' funny to me after all these years o' swearin' that I'd never ride in one o' these gasoline cars to find myself in one after all,--and at my time o' life.""""Guess maybe I'd have thought so, too, if I'd had the chance,"" responded the surprising old lady ruefully. ""Pretty well mussed up, I guess, and stunned. Shouldn't wonder if I found a heap o' bruises around me somewhere--but no bones broke. You see,"" she added, as though imparting a great secret, ""the Sandersons' bones jest never was made to break. Now, there was our cousins--the Petersons--they was different. One o' that family wouldn't dare waggle his finger too hard for fear it would bust on him. You see, they was just naturally made that way. My son, Willie,"" here the brave voice lowered a trifle and tears rose to the bright old eyes, ""he used to call them in fun--always jokin', that boy was--the Break-bone Petersons.""""But are you sure you aren't hurt?"" Betty insisted, still with that curious feeling of having the wind taken out of her sails. ""You see,"" she added hastily, as the twinkle returned to the old woman's eyes, ""we were going to take you to the hospital, but if you are really sure there are no bones broken, I think you would like the Hostess House better.""""Hostess House?"" repeated the old woman, her eyes widening with interest. ""Yes, I've heard a lot about those places. That's where the sweethearts and mothers and wives of the soldier boys go, isn't it--to meet them--?""""But I'm not a mother, or a wife, or a sweetheart of any of those boys,"" objected the little old woman, while the same cloud swept over her face, leaving it wrinkled and old. ""I--I might have been--if--if--Willie--""""But that doesn't make any difference,"" Grace assured her, speaking for the first time and laying a white, soft hand over the knotted, wrinkled one. ""We want you to stay with us and rest while we try to find the man who ran you down.""""Oh, him!"" cried the old woman scornfully, all the time patting Grace's hand with gentle fingers. ""There's no use wastin' time lookin' for him. He'll make pretty sure that he won't be seen round these parts again--not for some time, anyway. But you're dear, sweet little ladies,"" she added, looking from Betty, whose arm still rested about her shoulders to Grace's hand in hers and from them to the two girls in front. ""You're awfully sweet little ladies,"" she repeated, while the quick tears rose to her eyes. ""I don't see why you're bein' so kind to me--"""
"""But we just love to do anything we can,"" broke in Betty quickly, for the Outdoor Girls never liked to be thanked. ""And we'd like so much to have you see our Hostess House. That is, if you'd care to,"" she added, suddenly remembering that the old woman might not be so helpless and alone as she had seemed--might have made some other plans. But the latter quickly reassured her.""Oh, I would like to, more than anything else in the world,"" she replied eagerly, then, realizing that her fervor might astonish the girls, added with a little forced laugh. ""You see, it's a weakness o' mine. Maybe it's because I'm getting old--but, the soldier boys--I can't seem to see enough o' them--""The woman's eyes twinkled again. She was about to make some sort of comment, but at that moment Mollie swung the car into the street leading to the Hostess House, and the girls gave a little surprised exclamation at finding themselves so nearly there.It was astonishing to see how quickly their patient had recovered from the accident. She seemed a little weak and unsteady as they helped her from the car, but going up the steps to the Hostess House she resolutely refused all assistance and mounted the porch alone.There was some discussion at first as to where they could put their unexpected guest, for all the rooms were full and a couple of unused emergency cots seemed to be all the extra accommodations they could find.""Ah, 'tis a deep, dark plot,"" cried Mollie, staggering dramatically and almost falling downstairs. ""I see it all--they get the bed while we, poor wretches that we are, toss our uneasy bones upon the cot--""""My, isn't this fine!"" exclaimed the guest, her face lighting up happily. ""A beautiful big bed and three fine windows to see the soldier boys from. Are you sure,"" she added, glancing from one to the other of the four eager faces suspiciously, ""that I'm not putting you out? Because, if I am--""""Why of course you're not,"" Betty fibbed stoutly, adding, with a swift change of subject: ""But I'm sure now that you would like to rest. Look,"" she added, with quick solicitude, as she saw how white the old lady had become, ""your hands are trembling--""""No, no, no,"" disclaimed the little old woman impatiently, as she gazed with set face out of the window that faced upon the parade. ""I'm a little cold. And--that boy--"" She pointed with quivering finger at a sturdy, khaki-clad figure, swinging happily over the parade in the direction of the mess-hall, ""He--he reminded me--""""He--he was--just like--"" The slight form was shaking and the words forced themselves from between her chattering teeth, ""what my Willie boy would have been now--if he hadn't--run away. My little son! My baby!""""I guess maybe it would,"" she agreed, taking a handkerchief from the pocket in her dress and wiping her eyes. ""You see, I never have told anybody for years and years, and if it hadn't been for this war I suppose I should have gone right on not telling anybody for the rest of my life. Of course the Yates and Baldwins and all the folks that lived around us knew it, so there was no use telling them--"" Her voice trailed off and her eyes sought the window with its vista of parade ground and low, roughly built barracks buildings."
"The girls looked at her. Never in their lives, they thought, had they been so thoroughly interested in anything as they were in the secret sorrow of this gentle old lady, the sorrow that brought that strange cloud of unhappiness every time she mentioned this son of hers who had run away.""Well, to begin with,"" she said, ""we lived way at t'other end o' the world. Danestown, it was called, and my husband--better man never breathed--died when my little boy was only four years old. I wasn't so young any more, for Willie was the youngest--the others had all died when they was babies--and Willie's pa and me was getting along in years when he come to us--the dearest, sweetest, prettiest baby you ever set your eyes on.""Well, we had managed to save some little money, though 'twasn't over much at best, and with me workin' on the farm week days and Sundays, we managed to get along pretty well. An' I was savin' pennies--"" Here the old voice trembled and nearly broke, so that it was some minutes before the speaker could go on.The girls tried hard to think of something to say, but as everything that came to them sounded flat and inappropriate, they kept a sympathetic silence--which was perhaps the best they could have done, after all.""As I was sayin',"" the old voice continued after a while, ""I was squeezin' every little penny I could from the bare necessities to lay aside for the boy. You see, it had been his father's wish that Willie should be given the chance neither of us had ever had to get some schoolin' and have his chance in the world. I was hopin' that by the time the boy grew up I might maybe have enough to send him to college.""Of course,"" she added, with an air of apologizing for a weakness that went straight to the girls' hearts, ""they was only dreams. But I don't see as there was any harm in them, seein's I always kept them to myself an' never told anybody 'bout them--leastways, no one but Willie.""Sometimes, on a winter night when the snow was fallin' outside an' the wind was howlin' round the house, I used to draw Willie up to the big, open fireplace we had in the kitchen and tell him 'bout his pa an' how he had always wished for Willie to be a fine, big man.""An' Willie, he'd listen with those big, earnest eyes o' his--such beautiful eyes my Willie had--"" Again the voice broke and trailed off into silence while the girls sat and waited as before, only with a stronger pity in their hearts for this faithful little old woman who had loved so well--and lost.""An' then,"" the voice continued, more softly and dreamily than before, my little boy would reach up and pat my cheek, just like his father used to do, and seems like I can hear his voice now, just as plain as I did all those long, long years ago.""'Maw,' he'd say, drawlin' a little in his cunnin' way, 'just don't you worry. I'll do all those things, jest like pa said, an' then we'll go an' live in a big house an' you won't have to work so hard any more--jest be happy.'""He was,"" answered the old lady simply. ""It wasn't very long after that he ran away, and I suppose""--again her eyes sought the parade ground--""if I was to meet him now I maybe wouldn't know him. You see, I'd still be lookin' for my little brown-eyed, yellow-haired Willie boy.""""You see, Willie took a lot after his father. He used to just like to sit and dream and read books you'd thought a little fellow like him couldn't understand at all--he was just twelve when he ran away.""Only, I remember one time,"" the bent old form straightened up proudly and the bright old eyes gleamed, ""when the other boys started pushin' things too far an' begun callin' my boy names--no names that a boy with any pride in him would stand for--I heard them--they was jest around the back o' the house, an' I came to the door with my mad up to the boilin' point, but what I saw made me stop right short an' wait for what I knew was goin' to happen.""Willie, he was sittin' on a log by the barn, jest wrapped up in a new book he'd found, an' it was some time before just what those ragamuffins was sayin' seeped in. When it did was when I came to the door, boilin' with rage.""'I'll be askin' you,' he said, drawlin' very marked and facin' the bully o' the crowd that was at least two or three years older than he was--'I'll be askin' you to say what you been sayin' all over again.'""'Now,' he says, more quiet than ever--I can see him now, with his big eyes blazin' black out o' his white face and his little hands that seemed to me scarce more'n a baby's clenched tight at his side--'Now, I guess, I got to lick you!'""Well, then came the awful day when Abner Conway's barn burned an' Abner himself came over to accuse my Willie of havin' started the fire, bringin' with him two or three o' the boys who had tried to call Willie names to swear they'd seen him do it.""But it didn't do any good. Abner was ragin' because it meant considerable loss to him, an' so much blame had been laid at Willie's door by the other boys that he declared this time he was goin' to have him punished."
"""'I'll have the law on him!' he shouted, rampagin' round my kitchen like a wild animal. I'll show that boy o' yours if he can go round settin' folks' barns on fire an' not get come up with! I'll give him a taste o' what it feels like to be behind bars. It's time somethin' was done, an', by Jerry, I'm the one to do it!'""Abner kept his word and brought the sheriff around that same afternoon, but they couldn't find Willie--he was gone. He'd left a note for me--full o' love--but sayin' that he couldn't bear to bring disgrace on me an' so he'd gone away. When he'd done what his pa wanted him to, he said, he'd come back an' then we could live in the big house an' be happy.""You see,"" the old lady went on tonelessly, ""it was only a little while after Willie ran away that they found out that tramps started the fire. Of course Abner was sorry then, but it was too late. My boy was gone.""The girls tried to comfort the little old woman for a few minutes more, then had to hurry away to various duties about the Hostess House--Mollie to help a young Polish boy who had been drafted into the army and who was struggling valiantly and conscientiously to learn English, Grace to write a letter for a Southern mountain boy who had never learned to read and write, and Amy and Betty to help a timid and somewhat helpless mother through the long hours of waiting before she could have a brief visit with her son during his time of relief from duty.""I don't see where you get that,"" Mollie interrupted hotly. ""Why, half the criminals in the world are made up of boys who were good enough to start with, but because of some temptation, or their environment, went wrong--""""Then I'd have indigestion and never cheer up,"" retorted Mollie crossly. ""Sometimes you make me feel as if I were on a little island completely surrounded by chocolates, Grace, and whenever anything bothered me I'd only have to eat one--a chocolate, I mean, not the island--to forget all my troubles.""""Which reminds me,"" broke in Betty, shaking off the thoughtful mood that had taken possession of her, ""that this is the day of our picnic, and if we don't get back to the Hostess House pretty soon the boys will be there before we have even made a sandwich.""""I should hope so,"" twinkled Betty. ""Our boys are as little apt to remind us of criminals as anybody I know. But seriously,"" she added, a little of the thoughtfulness returning, ""I think we're making a mistake in thinking that Willie Sanderson has become a criminal. I think there is probably some satisfactory explanation of why he stayed away from home; and perhaps with the help of the people we know we may be able to solve the mystery. Anyway, I don't believe that a boy like that and with a mother like this dear old soul could turn out very badly.""""Goodness, I think you're going to die, Gracie,"" said Mollie, looking her friend over anxiously. ""This is the first time since the fateful day of our meeting that I can remember your offering, actually offering, me two chocolates in succession.""""Goodness, have you got those things, too?"" asked Betty, as she hurried busily from table to pantry and back again. ""Please don't be so lazy, Mollie dear. The boys will be here before we're half ready, and we don't want to lose a minute of this perfect day.""Harder heart than Mollie's must have softened at this appeal, and she set to work with a will preparing delicacies for this picnic with the boys--perhaps the thought was accompanied by a strange, panicky sinking of the heart--the very last picnic they would have together, at least until after the war.""No, nothing definite,"" the Little Captain responded, deftly slipping currant jelly into layers of buttered biscuit. ""Of course, he said there were all sorts of rumors, but since they all came from equally good sources and no two of them pointed the same way, he wasn't listening to any of them. All they really know is that the regiment is all ready and equipped and will surely be on its way very soon."""
"""That's right, dear, I wouldn't either,"" approved Grace, patting her encouragingly on the back as she passed on her way to the pantry. ""You want to get your mind used to it by degrees, otherwise the shock might be too great. What's that, Betty--the sugar? Surely. Anything to be agreeable!"" The last hamper had just been done up, filled to the brim with good things, when the boys arrived.""Go in and keep the boys quiet, Amy, that's a dear,"" she begged, then, seeing refusal in Amy's eyes, added cajolingly: ""You always look as if you came out of a bandbox yourself, you know. Please, dear--""""Oh, Mollie, if you only wouldn't talk so much,"" sighed Grace, turning with an air of resignation from the mirror. ""As soon as you begin to talk everything goes wrong. My gloves walk under the bed, and my hair stands on end--""""Goodness,"" cried Mollie, looking injured, ""anybody'd think I was a ghost. I'll stand for being called lots of things, but a phantom--Ouch! Now what's the idea?"" For Grace's thumb and forefinger had come together in the fleshy part of her arm.The young folks paired off as usual, and Allen drew Betty a little behind the others. The two formed so handsome a couple that many a passer-by stopped and looked back after them with an admiring smile.The camp training had improved Allen wonderfully. Always splendidly athletic, he carried himself with a poise and moved with a swing that spoke of perfectly trained muscles, while his handsome face had been tanned to the color of an Indian's.No wonder that when Allen bent toward her and spoke in a certain tone reserved for her alone, Betty found it hard to look at this tall, bronzed soldier who had been her faithful cavalier for--oh, she could not remember how long.""Mollie and I have been trying to keep the hearts of three of those recruits that came in yesterday from breaking outright. Poor boys, they're awfully young--I believe they fibbed about their ages--and look like cherubs. None of them has ever been away from home before, and they are pathetically homesick. But they have told us about their homes and their mothers and fathers and the little brothers and sisters, and Mollie has joked with them and--Well, anyway, Allen, I believe we have made them feel that they are not wholly friendless.""""Grace has been writing letters for some of the boys who find it hard to do that. Grace is awfully good at that. And Amy, I believe, has been showing some girls who came down to see their brother, about the place and trying to keep them interested during the long waits between the times they can see the boy, who, like his sisters, is almost too timid to look out for himself."" The spot they had chosen for the picnic was quite a distance away from Camp Liberty, and by the time the party finally reached it, both boys and girls were wondering if the generous contents of the hampers would serve even to take the edge off their appetites.""Go on, Betty, never mind this vulgar rabble--with apologies to you, sweet sister,"" as Grace shot an indignant glance at him. ""You were saying that if I found this motorcyclist you'd give me an extra piece of cake, or words to that effect. Am I right?"""
"""And a little grub,"" supplemented Will hungrily. ""It seems to me I remember somebody saying a couple of hours ago that we were even then approaching our destination, and we seem to be getting no nearer rapidly--""""Well, I guess they've got another think coming,"" said Allen, inelegantly, placing himself with outstretched arms before the two precious hampers as though he were guarding a gold mine. ""Now let him come who dares. Only over my dead body--""""Oh, what's the use of spoiling our perfectly good party,"" complained Grace. ""Can't we ever begin to enjoy ourselves but what somebody starts taking all the joy out of life by talking about killing somebody, or something--""""Goodness, that's just the usual thing,"" Betty explained, looking prettier, so Allen thought, than ever before with the background of lacy green to set off her bright coloring. ""If they don't behave like that we know they're sick or something. Do have another biscuit, Roy. Goodness,"" and she stared round-eyed down into the empty space where the biscuits had been, ""they're every one gone! Who did eat them all?""Will was about to utter some scathing retort when Grace, who had gotten up to shake the crumbs from her dress and had walked down toward the road, suddenly called to them. It was such an excited, urgent call that they left everything and came running.""Well, there's nothing more we can do now,"" said Frank practically. ""Let's go back and finish our lunch. Probably,"" he added, as they thoughtfully retraced their steps, ""he took the wagon road for fear of running into one of you girls.""""Well, we might at least have tried,"" she cried hotly. ""That is more than you boys would have done. You don't seem to be even interested,"" she continued indignantly. ""If I were a man in uniform I'd show that coward that he can't knock old helpless women down and then run away. I'd show him that in insulting an old woman he was insulting the whole United States army--"" ""Well, where do we go from here, boys?"" asked Allen, lazily stretching out on the grass with a convenient, raised bank of moss for a pillow, while the girls repacked the depleted hampers. ""It's such a wonderful day, and camp was never like this.""""If it's bad,"" added Mollie briskly, ""we don't want to hear it, for, as the old lady said that used to come to see Mother regularly once a year, 'I don't care what terrible things people say or think about me, if they don't tell me about it,' But if it's good--we might stand it.""""All of which,"" Frank finished his self-justification, ""shows that we're far from anxious to leave you girls when we say we're eager for action. I guess,"" he added, thoughtfully, ""it's just because we're so crazy to be with you that we're eager to go across.""""But it's lots of fun,"" chuckled Mollie. ""We have found out by judicious inquiry--Amy, here, soon worms out the heart secrets of these boys by her quiet, sympathetic way--that a number of those boys have parlor tricks of one sort or another, and--"""
"""That orchestra fellow really is good,"" interrupted Amy. ""Boys, you should hear him play! He has a guitar hung over his shoulder, a harmonica strapped to his head, a piano near by to which he makes sudden dashes, and all the while he dances the most marvelous dance!""""Oh,"" laughed Betty, ""we are stage managers, scenic artists, stage hands, costumers, modern mutation of the Greek chorus, stays and props for the weak and timid, brakes for the overbold--in fact, we are around to do any work that nobody else wants to do.""But this isn't an argument; it's a suggestion,"" said Allen. ""Though I expect the scorn and ridicule of an unthinking populace. Perhaps you have heard of the old-fashioned, but sometimes effective, string and bent pin?""So they went to work, eager as children on a lark. The girls managed to furnish enough pins for the hooks, and when the available string gave out, the boys made use of stout, withy vines as substitutes.Several days had gone by, and the entertainment into which the girls had thrown themselves with so much enthusiasm had been given and pronounced a great success by the soldiers stationed at Camp Liberty. Since then the days had been given largely to the routine work of the Hostess House--afternoon teas, evening coffee served to those who wished it, writing letters for the boys, entertaining others, looking after wives and mothers and sisters who were visiting near the camp, suggesting books for some who seemed to be of uncertain taste. Now, on this day, something unusual had plainly happened.""Oh, girls, I've got a wonderful plan--something new for the soldier boys!"" cried Betty, breaking in upon her two friends merrily. Then, seeing that she had interrupted something, paused and looked uncertainly from Amy to Mollie and back again.""Oh, can't you find something original to say?"" snapped Mollie irascibly. ""Seems to me that's all I hear from morning to night. 'Oh, Mollie, what's the matter--what's the matter, Mollie?' till I could scream.""""All this would be funny if it weren't so impossible,"" she said. ""Suppose we begin at the beginning and tell our experiences, since we're all in the same boat. It ought to be interesting--if not instructive.""""Well,"" continued Mollie, her color rising, ""I don't know whatever got into Frank--he never used to be like that. He just sort of froze up and wouldn't answer my questions or anything until I got so angry I told him that if he didn't tell me what the matter was I'd say good-by to him right there and wouldn't ever speak to him again.""""Why, he just got red in the face,"" replied Mollie, ""and said all right then, he'd tell me what the matter was. And then he said""--she laughed a little hysterically--""that he just couldn't stand the thought of my seeing so much of Sergeant Mullins--think of it--me, who have never said two words alone to the man in my life!""""Allen said,"" Betty contributed, wide-eyed, ""that it made him mad to see the way that Sergeant Mullins hung around the Hostess House all the time. He made it quite plain that there was no doubt but what I was the main attraction.""""I know. But that's because he's so lonesome,"" put in Betty. ""And, of course, we have all tried to be nice to him. I think it's horrid,"" she added, flaring up, ""for the boys to act so ridiculously just because he happens to be good-looking and awfully attractive!"""
"""Well, for goodness' sake get to the point,"" urged Grace impatiently, glancing at the clock. ""We'll have to dress pretty soon, to go down to serve the regular afternoon tea to the soldier boys and their friends.""But to them he had been only one of many interesting soldier boys who had come and gone and whose meetings and partings with dear ones they had watched with swelling throats and tears in their own eyes.He had proved so wonderfully successful that, much to his secret chagrin--for Sergeant Mullins, like all the rest of our brave boys, had dreamed of the great things he would do ""over there""--the Government had decided to keep him at Camp Liberty indefinitely.They had accepted eagerly, little dreaming of the storm their acceptance would evoke. And it is very doubtful whether, even if they had known, it would have made any difference, for they had long desired just this thing and knew that in years to come they would look back upon it as one of the biggest experiences in their lives.""Nothing. It's what you may do,"" Betty answered, adding, in an explanatory tone: ""You see, we are just about to enter the sacred precincts of the drill ground, and it is fitting that we do so with an air of propriety and sobriety.""""I said it might be a mistake,"" Betty continued patiently, although her eyes twinkled. ""Anyway, we've got to live up to it--Goodness! just look at the boys. I guess the whole camp must be in the drill.""Mutely the girls echoed the sentiment, and for the next hour they sat motionless, eyes and attention glued upon the magnificent spectacle of a thousand men, running, advancing, retreating, attacking, all in obedience to one great plan.They forgot it was only a sham attack, an imitation battle, an exhibition drill. For the moment a curtain had been lifted and they were permitted to see something of the glory, the passion, the horror of democracy's struggle against the armed autocracy of the world.""I didn't say it was fun,"" she cried. ""Naturally the boys have to take into consideration the possibility of all that you said, Amy. But there's no glory in the world like giving yourself for a great cause--""""Oh, you did, did you?"" cried Frank, regarding Mollie's haughtily tip-tilt little nose with mingled fear and admiration. ""Well, I'll have you know, young lady, that you can't get rid of us as easily as all that. May I be permitted to walk beside you, mam'selle?"" The girls awoke one morning several days later--days of routine duty at the Hostess House--with the delightful sensation of something good impending. Crowded as they were in the one big room for Mrs. Sanderson's accommodation, they had formed the habit of talking over their prospective fun before the actual work and hurry and bustle of the day began.""I think it's poor Betty that needs the gas mask,"" retorted Mollie dryly. ""I never heard you talk so much this early in the morning since the first day of our acquaintance, Grace. What happened to wake you up?""""Please take her away, somebody,"" she wailed plaintively, while Betty regarded her out of wide and sleep-brilliant eyes. ""I heard a doctor say the other day that at the second sneeze it was time to go to the hospital.""""We would, dear,"" cried Mollie, slipping out of her own bed and taking Grace's place beside Betty on the sun-flooded cot, ""only you don't really look as though you were dying of anything, you know--especially influenza. Betty dear,"" she added, with an impulsive little hug, ""you do look so pretty!"""
"""Good for you, Amy dear,"" cried Betty eagerly. ""That's just exactly what I was thinking. The dear old lady seemed so much better yesterday I thought we might persuade her to share our picnic with us. How about it, Mollie?""""Well,"" explained Mollie, with a little smile as she recalled one of the many unusual conversations she had had with the little old woman, ""she told me the other day that she 'hated them gasoline wagons worse than poison,'--that the only reason she rode in ours was because she was unconscious when we put her in and she couldn't help herself. And she added somebody'd have to run over her again to make her do it a second time.""""I think she's the most wonderful old person I ever saw,"" remarked Amy thoughtfully, as they dressed hastily. ""She must be pretty old, and yet she says the funniest, wittiest things, and her eyes sparkle and twinkle like a girl's.""""Well, I really think she looks older than she really is,"" said Grace slowly and very judicially. ""You know working on a farm in the hot sun the way she did for years, isn't calculated to make a person look younger than she is.""""Well, wishing won't accomplish anything,"" said Mollie practically, as she vigorously pulled on a shoe as if it were in some mysterious way responsible for the unsatisfactory state of affairs. ""I think some one ought to nickname us the 'four Dianas.'""""Well, of course Diana was very beautiful,"" said Grace, complacently regarding her own pretty reflection in the mirror. ""But if you meant that, Mollie, of course the description applies to only one of us.""""I meant,"" Mollie continued slightly, but only slightly, mollified, ""that we were hunting two men--Mrs. Sanderson's Willie and the motorcyclist who ran her down. And we haven't any more real chance of finding them than--"" But it seems that breakfast ""hath charms to sooth the savage breast,"" for after Mollie had attacked and conquered the appetizing fruit and cereal, ham and eggs, she seemed to forget all about her dire threat and smiled amiably at her intended victim across the table.""Goodness,"" she reproached herself, ""I almost forgot about her. Yes, go ahead Betty and do your best to get her. I know it would do her good. But you had better take Amy with you to help persuade Mrs. Sanderson. Amy and you together are a pair that will be hard to refuse. There goes Mr. Bretton now! He's so grateful for what we girls have done for him here--as though it were anything at all--that he'd do far more than help get the car ready. I'll get his help, while you and Amy go for Mrs. Sanderson and Grace gets ready. Now, rush! hurry! fly! off with you!""""Well, good morning, my dears,"" said the old woman, delighted at sight of their bright faces. ""I declare, if you don't bring all the sunshine in with you! It is lovely of you to call on an old woman so early in the morning."""
"""Well, I guess maybe it is,"" she admitted gayly. ""But, you see, we can't very well do it without asking you. Mollie said,"" she added, taking the little lady's hand in hers and squeezing it affectionately, ""that you told her the only way we could get you to do it was to make you unconscious again. And,"" she finished, with an adorable little coaxing smile, ""we couldn't do that, you know. We're altogether too fond of you.""""An automobile picnic,"" explained Betty, adding quickly as she saw refusal in the bright old eyes. ""Oh, please don't say 'no' yet. We've got the whole day off, and we're going to take Mollie's car and go off all by ourselves and eat our lunch and admire the view and--""""Taste gasoline for a week after,"" finished the old lady with a little grimace. Then she added quickly, as she saw the hurt look in Betty's bright face: ""No, I didn't exactly mean that, dear, and I wouldn't say anything to make you feel bad for worlds, that I wouldn't, only--I jest can't bring myself to ride in those automobiles. You see,"" there was an almost pathetic appeal for understanding in the bright old eyes, ""I guess I'm maybe too old to change my ways, an' I get tired easy--""""I'll tell you what we'll do,"" Amy intervened with rare tact. ""Some day when we're going for just a little ride around the block we'll ask you again. Maybe you'll feel more like it then, and you can get used to it by degrees.""""That's awfully nice of you, dearie,"" said the old woman, looking gratefully from one bright face to the other. ""I suppose you don't know how much I appreciate all you've done for me,"" she added, her voice breaking a little, ""'cause I never could tell you if I lived for a hundred years. But you just sort o' revived my faith in human nature. Since my boy went away--"" The old voice broke down entirely then, and Betty continued patting her hand soothingly,""But there,"" she added, in a different tone, wiping her eyes determinedly and smiling at them, ""this ain't no kind of a mornin' for tears, an' I know my son Willie would be the first one to tell me so.""Oh, will you let us?"" asked Betty eagerly, jumping up and dropping a kiss, light as thistle-down, upon the old face. ""And we'll bring you flowers, whole bunches of them. Will you promise to be happy while we're gone?""""Yes, dearie, just happy thinking of your coming back and the flowers,"" she agreed, and the smile remained on her lips even after the door closed behind them until the sound of their light footsteps and laughter faded away.""Why, yes,"" repeated Amy, astonished at Betty's amazement. ""She's almost well now, and, of course, she's too independent to want to stay here when she's all right again. Why, Betty, what's the matter?""""Oh, I don't know whether you'd call it an idea or just plain foolishness,"" answered Betty, striving to speak carelessly. ""I was just thinking that we might persuade her to stay longer on the plea that we wanted to bring the motorcyclist to justice and needed her identification.""""Well, I don't know,"" she said doubtfully. ""She said the other day that she didn't care much about bringing the fellow to justice. She said one motorcyclist was as bad as another, and the only thing that would give her satisfaction would be 'to arrest the whole tribe o' them.'"""
"The sharp toot of a horn as Mollie grazed the curb with the huge touring car put an end to the conversation for the time being. Grace was already on the porch, and as they raced down the steps the girls' spirits rose happily.""I should think you'd be tired expecting by this time,"" returned Mollie practically. ""Now will you please repeat that somewhat meaningless jumble of words, Betty dear? What was it--something about somebody's son having a good effect upon somebody--""""Go on talking all night, will you, Betty dear?"" entreated Mollie, speaking thickly because of a mouthful of chocolate. ""Home was never--"" But here Grace inserted another bonbon so deftly that Mollie choked and almost precipitated another appalling accident.""Well,"" said Betty obediently, for she had been so busy with her own thoughts that half the persiflage and gay bantering had passed above her head, ""I was speaking of Mrs. Sanderson and her son. I thought that if we told her we were trying to find her Willie, she might consent to stay on with us a little longer.""""Yes,"" Grace agreed, employing her paper napkin to remedy the damage done by a vivid spot of jelly on her skirt. ""They seem to think they can dictate to us. Imagine it! To us! Outdoor girls who have never known what it was to take dictation from any one!""""To finish what I was saying,"" Grace continued, while Betty and Amy chuckled and Mollie looked wide-eyed and innocent: ""I, for one, will never take dictation from any one outside the home folks--especially mere boys our own age,""""Just the same I can't help thinking,"" Betty persisted, ""that that was why they acted so queerly about Sergeant Mullins. Maybe they think that when they're several thousand miles away the other boys will have their chance.""""Evidently they thought I couldn't hear them,"" Mollie continued. ""But they were mistaken, for I heard Roy answer pityingly, 'Say, old man, I've heard of love being blind before, but here's a case where the poor little god is deaf.'""""Oh, I believe I know when that was now!"" exclaimed Grace, with sudden animation. ""It must have been that evening when I was baking biscuits and I looked out of the window and saw Roy. He looked like a tramp, hair all disheveled and face as red as a beat.""Then what do you mean?"" cried Mollie impatiently. ""Oh, Betty dear, I just haven't realized how awful it will be until this minute. When, those boys have actually gone, I'll lie down and die, that's all.""""'In a week!' the major was saying eagerly. 'The boys will be glad of that, Colonel. I've had all I could do to keep them pacified at all. Once let them get at the Huns and it will be all over but the shouting.'"
"""'Yes, they're a fine bunch of young fighters,' the colonel answered. And, oh girls, I wish you could have seen the way he looked, so splendidly straight and martial and proud. 'I tell you, Major,' he said, 'it's a great thing to have the leadership of such lads as those. They're the pick of the nation.'Her voice trailed off into silence, and for a long time no one spoke. Each one of these young girls, who, a few short months before, had scarcely known the meaning of the word war except as they had read about it in their histories, was striving desperately to visualize the battle front--the trenches, great guns belching forth a deadly hail of shells, the roar of cannon, the moans of dying men--""Yes, it is something like cutting the poor dog's tail off an inch at a time,"" sighed Amy, and at the comparison and her sober countenance they had to laugh despite the very real trouble at their hearts.""I wish,"" said Betty wistfully after a while, ""the boys could have gotten leave to-day. I should like to have just one more picnic with them. We've had such good times together. And we're going to have lots more,"" she added, springing to her feet with a sudden, swift smile. ""That's our part of the business from now on. Just to keep smiling and make up our minds that they're coming back to us just as they went--only better.""""Girls, it's getting late,"" she said suddenly, with another of her swift changes of subject. ""I guess perhaps it's time we were starting back. Oh, I forgot,"" she added, in consternation, ""I, or rather, Amy and I, promised Mrs. Sanderson we'd gather some flowers for her, and now we've got to do it, even if it is late--""Grace gave one desperate leap and landed beside Amy on the stump while Betty and Mollie stepped to one side out of the reptile's path. Then, almost miraculously--or so Betty thought when she looked back upon it afterward--her eye fell upon a forked twig lying at her feet.Quick as a flash and before the snake had time to coil again, Mollie picked up the rock and hurled it at his sinister copper head. Her aim was true, and the long, slithery body, robbed of its deadliness, writhed and beat furiously at the short stubbly grass.""I--I thought you'd be k-killed,"" moaned Amy, and though the tears of excitement and horror were rolling down her cheeks, she would have been the first to deny it had you told her she was crying. ""Oh, B-Betty, you're w-wonderful!""""Well, let's g-get out of here,"" cried Grace. Later they had time to laugh at the chattering teeth that made it impossible to say anything without stammering--but it seemed anything but funny to them then. ""Let's g-get out!""""I guess that was one of the narrowest escapes we ever had,"" said Mollie over her shoulder with a laugh that was still a little unsteady. ""I guess we won't go picnicking in the woods alone again for quite some time.""""There aren't many,"" Betty explained, ""Allen told me that poisonous snakes of any sort had been so rarely seen around these parts that people thought the stories of them were made up. He said they always looked suspiciously at the bearers of the snake tales, shrugged their shoulders, winked, and asked each other to guess where So-and-So had been the night before.""""Oh, please don't start anything else,"" cried Betty, herself a little on edge with the rather exciting day's events. ""Let's get out and see if we can find what's wrong. We certainly can't do any good by talking about it."""
"They got out, and Mollie even consented to ""get under,"" but all to no avail. The machine refused to be placated and stood stubbornly still in the middle of the road while the storm clouds gathered and the first drops began to fall.As the small squad swung around the turn in the road they were delighted to see that Sergeant Mullins was in charge. He brought the boys to a sharp halt at sight of them, and came forward to meet them, saluting gravely.""I guess it's all right now,"" he assured them with another punctilious salute. ""If I might suggest that there's no time to be lost--"" with a significant glance toward the lowering sky. For answer, Mollie threw in the clutch and the machine purred evenly. Then, with a little impulsive gesture, she turned to the sergeant.""Goodness, it isn't even that now,"" Mollie returned, dropping a stitch in the sweater she was making and not even noticing it--an almost unheard of procedure. ""That is,"" she added, with a slight little flicker of hope, ""if you're sure you heard the major aright, Betty. Mightn't he have been speaking of something else?""""Well, I told you what he said,"" answered Betty, a trifle impatiently, for she also had dropped a stitch and saw before her the weary process of ripping out two whole rows of her helmet--and helmets were such mean things to make, anyway!""Have you seen any of the boys lately?"" she asked, after an interval of deep concentration. ""We've been kept so busy here at the Hostess House lately with these other boys that our boys might as well be dead and buried for all I've seen of them.""""No, no, of course not,"" he said hurriedly. ""He was speaking of me, poor worm that I am. But, I say,"" he added, looking around at the busily flying needles, ""what's the idea of the knitting. We've got more sweaters and things than we know what to do with now.""""I don't know, and what's more I don't care,"" replied Roy independently, leaning back and crossing his long legs with a sigh of content. ""We've all been trying to get leave to come over and see you girls, and so far I'm the only one who's succeeded. The old boy, that is, the colonel,"" he corrected himself, gravely saluting the imaginary officer, ""is drawing the reins pretty tight these days. Looks,"" he added, striving to keep the excitement out of his voice, ""pretty much like business.""""Like business,"" they repeated in chorus, and were about to follow it up with a shower of questions when there was the sound of more masculine voices in the hall and the missing members of the quartette precipitated themselves upon the assembled company. Roy looked disgusted--the girls happy.""Betty, Betty,"" he cried, his voice keen, his eyes shining with excitement, ""we've got special permission to tell you, because you're in the service. We're going, little girl! We're on our way to lick the tar out of those Huns!""""Allen!"" Betty's face went suddenly white and she sank down on the arm of a chair, regarding him with wide, dark eyes. The other three boys with Mollie and Grace were gathered in the opposite corner of the room, chattering like magpies."
"""C-congratulations,"" she stammered, then her lip trembled and she bit it to keep it steady. ""I know how much you've been wanting it,"" she continued, striving for a matter-of-fact tone, ""and so, of c-course, I'm glad for your sake. Only--""""Betty,"" he cried, his hands breaking away from their imprisonment and seeking hers fiercely, ""I'm trying so hard to do the right thing,--be honorable and all that--wait till I come back, you know--but I can't. It--it isn't human nature. You're too wonderful--too utterly--""If they had been alone no one knows what might have happened. But, even as it was, Allen, watching the flaming color and the downcast eyes, felt his heart leap joyfully and was almost--almost--satisfied. The rain that had been pouring down steadily all night stopped about dawn. Betty raised herself on one elbow to look out the window and was greeted by a dazzling burst of sunshine, as the glorious disc dispersed the fog and took possession of the world.""Well,"" said Mollie, throwing back the covers preparatory to rising, ""I might suggest that the next time you feel it coming on, you might choose something more comfortable, that's all. Wondering about such things might become wearing. What's that?"" she asked, as a sharp tap sounded on the door.""I haven't been able to sleep all night,"" she said, her hands fluttering nervously in her lap. ""Ever since Betty told me the boys were going this morning I couldn't think of anything but just that one thing.""""Oh, it wasn't your fault, dear,"" the old woman hastened to reassure her. ""And it really didn't make me feel bad--not for them, anyway. They're lucky to be able to fight--even to die--for a country like ours. Only,"" she paused, and some of the light died out of her eyes, ""I couldn't help wishing--""""If I thought that,"" she said, her voice tense, her hands clasped so tightly in her lap that the knuckles showed white, ""I'd be willing, glad, to die the next minute. If I could just see my boy in uniform--even if I knew I could never see him again--"" her voice trailed off, and once more the light died out of her eyes.""But, of course, that's impossible,"" she said wearily. ""If my boy had been alive, he'd have come back to me. But that wasn't why I came in to see you so early,"" she added after a moment, straightening up with that indomitable courage that had won, first, the girls' admiration, then their love. ""I jest wanted to find out when 'twas the boys was startin'.""""We're not quite sure. The boys thought some time between nine and ten o'clock, but they didn't seem to be at all sure about it. The only thing we really know is that they're going to start early,"" Betty answered.""Well, that's just the reason she won't,"" said Grace, irritably struggling with an unruly lock of hair. ""Nobody ever gets what he deserves in this awful world. What is the matter with my hair this morning? It looks just exactly as I feel."""
"""Oh, come away from the mirror, Gracie,"" cried Betty, putting an arm about her and dragging her, an unwilling victim, out into the hall. ""You'll feel better after you've had your breakfast. And remember,"" she added diplomatically, ""there's a brand new box of candy in your left-hand dresser drawer.""""It was Roy's parting gift,"" she said, striving to speak lightly, though her voice trembled ever so little. ""You know, Betty,"" she said in a rare burst of confidence, ""I never had the slightest idea I could feel so really b-bad--"" her eyes filled and she brushed her hand across them impatiently.""Well, but what's one skid more or less in a good cause?"" interrupted Betty merrily. ""Besides, I guess we wouldn't have time to walk, anyway,"" she added quickly, as dozens of soldiers began pouring from their barracks. ""We'll never be able to get to the station before the boys unless we take the car.""""Certainly looks like it,"" said Grace grimly, for once not knowing or caring whether the becoming little hat was tilted at exactly the right angle or not. ""It makes me feel all queer and--wobbly inside.""""Better take some candy along,"" advised Mollie, with a weak attempt at raillery as they ran down the porch steps and piled into the car. ""You won't be able to come out of it alive if you're not properly fortified, Gracie.""""Oh, that reminds me,"" cried Betty, springing from her seat and from the car at the risk of her neck, for the machine had already begun to move. ""We forgot the chocolate and tobacco for the boys. Wait for me, Mollie.""""Yes we have, and it's just about time, too,"" panted Betty, as they scrambled into the machine. ""The boys are coming from the main gate now, and we'll have to make things hum if we want to get there before them.""""But Mollie,"" said Amy, gripping both hands tight in her lap as the car swerved sharply and executed a magnificent skid on two wheels, ""you know it won't do either the boys or us any good if we get killed on the way. Do be--""Unconsciously the girls were sparring for time. They knew that once they let themselves think, that once they let themselves realize the full significance, the utter finality of this thing that was about to happen, it would be hard for them to smile. And they so wanted to smile!And the thought of their going away had seemed so far in the future that, as yet, it need not worry them. Blinded by their own passionate patriotism, they had seen all of the glory of war and none of its horror.And now, in order to send the boys away with the thought of bright faces and encouraging smiles to cheer them on their long, grim journey, the girls joked and laughed, carefully avoiding the subject that was uppermost in their minds.""Oh, well, that's all a person can expect in this world,"" Grace had answered resignedly, in reply to Amy's thrust. ""Just be kind and loving and thoughtful of other people's comfort, and you're sure to be sat upon--""""Goodness, she doesn't think anything of herself, does she?"" Mollie flung back over her shoulder. ""Now see what you made me do!"" the exclamation was fairly jerked from her as the car lurched into a deep rut at the side of the road, skidded for a minute, seemingly uncertain whether to fling them out on the bank or continue its way, then bumped up on the road again and continued its flight."
"""How so?"" queried Mollie with interest--or perhaps it might be said, Mollie's back expressed interest. For Mollie's back could express, Grace had once said, ""more emotions in a minute than most people's faces could in a year."" And, riding as they so often did, in full view of that expressive back, the girls had come to interpret its owner's emotions correctly in nine cases out of ten. So now they were able to detect a very quickened interest.""Girls,"" she said, and suddenly her voice quivered and her eyes filled, ""I've tried so not to think of it, but I can't fight it off much longer. Will and I have always been such chums, played and worked and even--quarreled--together--""""Please don't, Gracie,"" cried Betty, her face flushing and her eyes growing dark and wide. ""It would be so easy just to g-give way, but we're in the service, too, you know, and we must be at least as b-brave as the boys.""""Well, we never know what we can do till we try, do we?"" cried Betty, that indomitable fighting spirit of hers rising to the emergency. ""If we say we can't, of course we can't, but we can do our best, can't we? If the boys aren't c-crying, why should we?"" It was a valiant determination, that one to smile whatever happened; but somehow, 'way down in their brave hearts, the girls doubted a little. They would do their best, but, after all, they were only human and there are times when to smile is the hardest achievement in the world.""We're--we're nearly there,"" ventured Amy, after a little interval of silence, during which the girls had been busily gathering all their resources for the crisis just before them. ""Do you suppose we've got in ahead of the boys?""""Goodness, I should hope so,"" retorted Mollie, with a brief return of her old spirit. ""If this old car couldn't make better time than boys on foot, I'd give it away to any one who'd take it off my hands.""As she spoke the car swung around a sharp curve, and the station that had appeared so attractive to them several months ago, loomed into view. To-day they greeted its appearance with as much enthusiasm as they would the electric chair.""Yes, that's where a great many of them go,"" Betty answered, praying desperately that she might fight down that flood of tears that every moment threatened to rise and overwhelm her. ""I _won't_ be weak and f-foolish,"" she was saying, over and over, to herself. ""I won't, I won't, I won't!""""Well, they'll see the car, won't they?"" Betty argued, a little impatiently, for even her sweet temper was beginning to give way under the strain. ""They'll know by that that we're here and then if they miss us, they deserve to--that's all.""""I--I don't see how it's going to make us feel very much better to quarrel about it,"" she said, adding whimsically: ""Come ahead you two--kiss and make up before the boys come. You know they always said it made them jealous enough to commit murder when we did it in their presence.""""Oh, I know. But it all seemed like a terrible d-dream till now,"" returned Amy, looking so like a bewildered child that Betty put a comforting arm about her and drew her into the little recess beside her."
"""It isn't a dream, Amy dear,"" she said, very steadily. ""I don't think we were ever more fully or terribly awake than we are now. Not even that day when we heard of the sinking of the _Lusitania_, did we realize just what this war was going to mean to us. It's only by some sacrifice--some personal sacrifice--"" but the brave voice broke and died into silence while she listened with almost straining intensity to that regular beat of marching feet, coming nearer, ever nearer--""Oh, keep still,"" cried Mollie, turning with sudden, unreasoning fury toward the oncoming locomotive with the smudge of smoke in its wake, her hands clenched passionately and her black eyes smoldering. ""We know you're coming for them--Roy and Allen and Will and Frank and--and--all the others. But that's no reason why you have to rub it in, is it?""At any other time, the rather unreasoning attack upon the train would have seemed funny to the girls, and even in their trouble a faint gleam of humor came to them, but no one laughed, no one even smiled.""I--I wonder,"" said Grace, nervously patting a stray lock of hair into place beneath the smart little hat which, under the spell of excitement, had gotten slightly awry, ""if we'll be able to pick our boys out from all that crowd. Oh, girls,"" taking a quick little survey over the top of her own particular packing case, ""they're almost here! Swarms, just swarms of them!""""Goodness, that sounds like locusts--or mosquitoes,"" cried Betty hysterically, scarcely knowing what she was saying. ""Squeeze in tight, Amy, or you'll get your toes stepped on. Grace, look again. How far away are they?""""Safer?"" cried Mollie scornfully, ""I'd like to know what there is to be afraid of. Oh, there you go again,"" shaking an impotent little fist as the great train rumbled into the station with a screaming of brakes and a shrieking of whistles.And then the flood broke. Down the station platform came hundreds upon hundreds of khaki-clad figures, talking, gesticulating, faces eagerly flushed, eyes brilliant as they prophetically looked into the future.And indeed there were scores of familiar faces among the boys that were passing perhaps forever out of their lives. Some saw the girls and saluted them gaily, but most of them were too intent upon boarding the train and embarking upon the glorious adventure with as little delay as possible to look either to the right or the left.They came over then, those four, to the girls they were leaving indefinitely--perhaps forever. Their young faces were very grave, their jaws grim and set, and the girls realized suddenly that these were not the boys who had so joyously left Deepdale in the service of their country. These were no longer careless, irresponsible boys, but men with a great and glorious duty to perform, and their hearts thrilled with a new pride.""Y-yes,"" she nodded, breathless, a little frightened, yet adorably brave. Why, this was Allen, and he was going away! He might be killed over there! She might never see him again! ""And,"" she added, looking up into his eyes with a shy recklessness, ""I--I'd say it again, Allen, if you asked me--"""
"""Betty, Betty, I love you,"" he whispered unsteadily. ""I'll be dreaming of you always. Whatever I do 'over there' will be because of you--"" The whistle shrieked a rude warning and his hands tightened on hers. They were both trembling a little.""I don't think they'd admire us very much if they could see us now,"" sighed Amy, dabbing a rather red nose with a generous portion of talcum powder. ""Crying is so terribly damaging to my particular style of beauty! Every time I do it I vow I never will again--""""But you girls are all Helen of Troys compared to me when I cry,"" said Grace, her tear-dimmed eyes fixed mournfully on space. ""Why, after I've had a good cry I cover up all the mirrors in the house for a couple of days afterward.""""Betty,"" cried Grace, pausing in the act of applying still more powder to the tip of her nose and regarding the Little Captain with a horrified expression, ""why drag the mention of such unromantic things into the open--""""As if I were not always that!"" retorted Amy, dabbing so liberally at the unfortunate member that Mollie sneezed, bumped over a rock in the road and nearly dashed the car against that long-threatening tree.""Well, I guess I didn't altogether mean that,"" said Betty thoughtfully. ""Of course there is the medical personnel that is stationed here indefinitely and very much against its will. And, of course,"" she added, after a moment's pause, ""there is Sergeant Mullins.""""And he's simply desperate at being kept here,"" added Amy suddenly. ""He's done everything he possibly could to get away, but they say they need him more here than on the other side, and so, of course, he can't do a thing.""""Strike one,"" she cried. ""But do tell us, Amy clear, about this meeting with Sergeant Mullins that occurred in the broad light of day. It must have been interesting--though unforeseen,"" she added hastily, as Amy turned a suspicious eye upon her.Betty brought back her wandering attention with a start. She had been thinking of those last words of Allen's, had been seeing again that exalted look in his eyes, could feel again the trembling of his hands as he grasped hers in a grip that hurt--hurt gloriously.""Oh, Amy, do tell us about it,"" she begged earnestly. ""You know he has always been something of a mystery to us because of his reserve, and we'd love to know more about him. You know we're really not curious--just truly interested.""""Well,"" agreed Amy, with a smile, not able to resist Betty--nobody ever was for long--""of course, I'll tell you all there is to tell--although it really isn't much. I was hurrying along the parade a day or two ago, watching the boys drill, when somebody ran plump into me and made me drop the package I was carrying. I gasped and started to apologize for not looking where I was going when I saw that it was Sergeant Mullins. Then we both laughed and he picked up my package and offered to see me safely back to the Hostess House. Now what are you laughing at, Mollie?"""
"""Well,"" Amy continued, slightly mollified, ""it was then he told me all about the ambition he had had of being one of the first on the firing line and how hard it was to train all the boys to go after the Huns and then not have a chance at them himself.""""Well, what else was there to say?"" Amy replied, a little sharply. ""Of course, it didn't make him feel any better, and I knew in my heart that it wouldn't, but anything's better than just staying quiet and acting foolish.""""Anyway, he seemed to understand that I was really sorry for him,"" Amy continued, not noticing the interruption. ""He said he was sorry he'd bothered me with his grouchiness, that he wouldn't have felt so bad about it if it hadn't been for all the boys going away, and he supposed he'd even get used to that after a while if he tried hard enough.""Just the same, he did look mighty grim as he turned away,"" she finished, with a little smile at the memory, ""and he said something about not being surprised if he got mad at the last minute and hitched on the rear platform, anyway.""""It's wonderful how eager they all are,"" said Betty, her eyes shining and a little catch in her voice. ""I suppose there are slackers, lots of them, but so far I haven't met a boy who wasn't desperate at being given a 'safe berth' away from the firing line and danger.""And it isn't that they don't think of it, either,"" she went on, her face flushing with enthusiasm, ""or realize what it means. Just the other night Will was talking to me, Gracie--you know he's always been almost as much my brother as yours--and he said, 'I tell you what, Betty, it isn't often I let the grim side of this war business get to me, and it's the same with the other fellows. Of course we know it's there, but we're willing to take the bad with the good for the sake of doing what we're pretty darn sure is the only thing to do. Only,' he added, slowly, 'we're none of us pretending to say that we enjoy the idea of being maimed or perhaps crippled for life. There's not one of us but who's praying that if we have to go, it will be a good swift bullet that will do the business.""'But,' he added, with a smile--and I could have hugged him for that smile, girls. 'But, of course, as I said before, we're not thinking of that side of it. It's enough to know that if it comes, we'll know how to meet it.'""And Mollie's eyes that could flash so wrathfully at times, were also soft with memory, and Amy, thinking of those last words that were almost, yes, so very near, a promise, flushed hotly and wondered if after all she ought--so soon-- A day or two went by during which the girls tried pluckily to go on with their duties about the Hostess House with bright and smiling faces. It was hard, though, to keep their thoughts from wandering to the four boys who were now on their way to face all the realities and all the horrors of the terrible war, and perhaps it was well that the leaving of so many made their duties lighter than usual.On their return from the station after seeing the boys entrain they had found a letter from their friend, Mrs. Barton Ross, of their home town of Deepdale, head of the Young Women's Christian Association, under whose auspices the Hostess House at Camp Liberty was run. In this letter Mrs. Ross had said that she had sent to the girls a box of books for which they had sent a request--books all of which one boy or another had asked for, and which the regular Camp library had not been able to supply.""Well, we can't be sad and forlorn any longer,"" said Betty determinedly. ""We came here to cheer people up, you know, and how we're going to do it by being doleful ourselves, I don't know. So, in the words of the vulgar--'here goes.' How's that?""""I can't bear to think of her in there by the window all alone,"" she said. ""It has been awfully hard for her to watch all those boys going away, knowing that her Willie wasn't among them. I might be able to comfort her a little.""They knocked on the door, but, receiving no answer, pushed it open and stepped inside the room. The old lady was sitting in exactly the same position as when Betty had seen her from the car, almost an hour before."
"She glanced up, a little startled when they spoke to her, and half rose to her feet. She looked dazed and very old and drawn. With a little cry of compassion, Betty ran over to her and gently forced her back into her chair.""You needn't be, dearie."" The old eyes twinkled and the old hand was very gentle as it patted Betty's cheek reassuringly. ""I'm always glad to see you and I've told you to come right in any time. I was thinking very hard, I guess, and that's why I didn't hear you.""""No, no, I was hoping you would come,"" said the latter so eagerly that Betty knew her impulse had been a correct one. The old woman had wanted some one--some one who understood--to pour out her heart to.""It was wonderful just to sit here and watch those boys who went, an' I've been thinkin' of it,"" she said, after a brief silence. ""Only, somethin' inside o' me, I guess 'twas my heart, kept bleedin' an' cryin' out that my boy should have been among them--my little brown-eyed Willie who used to sit out in the sun readin' every minute he could get. I can see him now, sittin' there, jest as if 'twas yesterday--"" Her voice trailed off, and in a silence eloquent with sympathy the girls waited for her to go on.""But I wanted to tell those boys too,"" she cried, straightening up with sudden fire, ""that my Willie wasn't only a reader an' as bright as a dollar,--he could fight, too. He'd have made a soldier to be proud of.""It wouldn't be near so bad,"" she added, turning to the girls with such a depth of tragedy in her eyes that their hearts bled for her, ""if I could only be sure o' his bein' dead. It's the heartbreak of not knowin' that's goin' to kill me in the end!""But there,"" she said, catching herself up as though ashamed of the outburst, ""seems like I talk to you little ladies more'n I ever talked to anybody else in all my life. Seems like it's jest been bottled up inside o' me so long it's jest got to come out.""Oh, please,"" cried Amy, taking one of the work-worn hands and pressing it earnestly between her own warm ones. ""We just feel honored to think that you trust us enough and like us enough to tell us these things. If you didn't we'd be miserable!""Several days later Mrs. Watson, their chaperone, and the head of the Hostess House, called the girls to her for a consultation, and, wondering what new thing was in store for them, they responded to the call.""Of course I've done my part of it,"" she agreed modestly. ""But equally of course I couldn't have done it if you girls hadn't stood shoulder to shoulder with me. And,"" she added, enthusiastically, ""it has been more the spirit with which you did the work than the actual work itself that has won such a reputation for our Hostess House here.""""We have,"" responded Mrs. Watson, with an indulgent smile. ""And, whether deserved or not, modesty would prompt us to say that it is not, of course--"" and the girls laughed amusedly. ""Our reputation is unusually good and unusually widespread. So good, in fact, that the boys are glad when they find they are to be sent to Camp Liberty.""""That is modest,"" said Mrs. Watson with another smile. ""But,"" she added, leaning forward in her chair and speaking earnestly, ""I honestly think that you girls don't even begin to realize what a wonderful work you have been doing right here in this little city that sprang up over night. It isn't a small thing, you know--sending thousands of our boys away cheered and strengthened, armed to meet the future--better men, just for having met you."
"""And the mothers and wives and sweethearts who have been entertained so royally and permitted to say good-bye to their loved ones under the very best and cheeriest conditions possible--why, they have spoken to me of you with tears in their eyes!""""That's it,"" Mrs. Watson broke in quickly. ""That's the spirit that has made your work here such a wonderful success. You've done it--and whether you will admit it or not, sometimes we've all been so tired at night we've ached in every joint and muscle when we've crawled into bed--because you loved to do it and because it was 'fun' to make people forget their troubles, if only for a little while, and be happy.""That's the secret, dear girls, and that's why the boys are all eager to be assigned here. Also, the boys in the permanent garrison will sing your praises to the few who have not already heard them, and of course we shall have to live up to their opinion of us.""""Only,"" said Mrs. Watson warningly, ""the work before us is apt to be very much more trying and arduous than any we have yet had. The camp is going to be filled to overflowing, and of course that will mean entertaining continually for us.""But you don't know how they feel,"" retorted Grace, wiggling one foot in its trim slipper experimentally. ""Every time I get a pair of shoes I have to get a size larger, and you know,"" argumentatively, ""at that rate I'll be a freak and you'll be able to charge admission for a look at me.""""Oh, don't give up, Grade dear, before we've even started,"" cried Betty, giving a little exuberant skip with the sheer joy of being alive. ""Anyway,"" she added, with inspiration, ""if you get tired you and Mollie can go back and get the car.""""I wouldn't waste my time on such a lazy person, Betty,"" said Mollie, who was walking briskly ahead with Amy. ""I suppose we might have brought the car,"" she added, after a minute, ""only it seems foolish when you have to stop at every house you come to.""""Well,"" said Betty diplomatically, while her eyes twinkled at the imaginary spectacle of whirling through the streets of the town, blowing raucously on horns and making stump speeches from the running board of the machine, ""it would at least have the advantage of being spectacular--""""Goodness, I am!"" exclaimed the latter, wilfully misunderstanding. ""With you to the death, if need be. But look,"" she added as they turned a corner, ""Methinks we have pretty nearly reached the scene of our activity.""""I tell you what we'll do,"" suggested Betty, as they crowded eagerly about her. ""It will save time, and, I think, be the easiest way. We'll each one take an entire street, visit as many of the houses as possible within an hour, and at the end of that time we'll meet here again and each make her report.""""I think this is the most wonderful town,"" Mollie remarked after a pause. ""Why there's hardly a house that I visited but what the people were willing to accommodate at least one boarder, and in some cases two or three, and, what's more,"" waving her hand enthusiastically, ""several of them didn't even want to take any money for it.""""And I found almost the very same thing,"" agreed Betty, as they linked arms and started on the homeward walk. ""I guess we have enough promises to start with now, and I don't think we'll have any trouble finding quarters for all who want them.""""I shouldn't wonder if Mrs. Watson is right about our reputation,"" said Grace, a little ruefully. ""Because the minute Mrs. Robinson opened the door and saw me she said she hadn't the slightest idea what I was going to ask her this time, but, seeing it was one of the girls from the Hostess House, she expected to say yes, anyway.""""Well, of course, it appears that way to us,"" replied Betty, shaking her head thoughtfully. ""But I'm afraid we can't hope to make her see it so. Anyway, Mrs. Watson said she spoke to her about it and said she would be going as soon as she had a chance to say good-bye to the 'young ladies.'"""
"For a long time the girls stared straight before them, deeply troubled. It was not so much the thought of losing the old lady, although, having grown fond of her, they would miss her badly, as it was the realization that here was one person in deep trouble, whose burden they could not seem in any way to lighten.""And we haven't been able to get hold of that motorcyclist,"" mourned Mollie. ""It makes me simply ferocious,"" she added, with sudden vigor, ""to think of his getting away with a thing like that and not even a day in prison to show for it.""""Humph,"" groaned Grace disgustedly, the temporary glow of success fading before the torture of aching feet, ""I don't see that they helped very much when they were here. We did the suggesting, and all they did was to laugh at our suggestions--""At this moment they were startled by the sound of a machine coming behind them at furious speed. Some chickens, crossing the road and pecking lazily as they went, scurried with alarmed squawking into the woods on either side.Betty's action always followed hard upon the heels of impulse, and before any of the girls had time to realize what she was going to do she had darted across the road, had said a few excited words, and was tumbling into the tonneau.The motorcyclist had sped around the corner and darted into one of the side streets. A few minutes later the chauffeur turned the same corner with a recklessness that made them gasp, turned it just in time to see their quarry disappearing round another corner.""Oh, please don't think about us,"" cried Betty, her hands clutching the back of the seat, her eyes straining after the flying speck that seemed to be growing smaller every second. ""Oh, we must catch him,--we must! It would be awful to lose him now!""""That you were the girls up at the Hostess House that everybody is talking about,"" he told her, while the girls fairly gasped with surprise at this proof of their widespread fame. ""That's why I didn't ask questions but just did as I was told,"" he added. And somehow they knew, though they could not see his face, that he was grinning. ""You see, I'd always heard that you most always got what you set out to get, and I didn't waste time arguin',"" he finished.""A murderer,"" cried Mollie fiercely, adding, as the man started and the girls looked at her in surprise: ""Well, he might just as well have been. He didn't even stop to see whether he was or not, which is about the same thing.""""I'm afraid so, miss,"" said the man, and he seemed so genuinely disappointed that they looked at him gratefully. ""The man must be rather much of a dare-devil, your criminal,"" he added, eyeing the bumpy path thoughtfully. ""An ordinary rider wouldn't be able to go two yards along that path without coming to grief.""""Sorry, miss,"" he said, ""but the road that path leads to is nothing but a wagon road, and we'd have to go several miles before we'd cross it. And the chances are,"" he added, ""that the fellow would double back upon himself and we'd have the run for nothing.""""I guess you're right,"" she said at last, after a pause during which the girls had looked at her hopefully. Betty so often found a way where no one else could that they never completely gave up hope until she herself relinquished it.""You've been awfully good,"" cried Betty, with real gratitude in her voice. ""But you don't have to take us away back to camp. If you will drop us at the end of the road we can walk back."" All this despite sundry vigorous and desperate shakings of Grace's head and pantomimic pointings toward her feet. At the conclusion of Betty's sentence she groaned, but brightened up again at the chauffeur's response."
"At the gates of Camp Liberty they got out of the car, thanked the chauffeur, and while they were hesitating whether or not to offer him money for his trouble, the latter turned the car and, with a last lifting of his cap and waving of his hand, was gone.""He hangs out mostly at Thomasville, a town about fifteen miles from here,"" the sergeant explained, when at last the girls had realized that if they ever hoped to learn anything at all they must give the man a chance to speak. ""And he makes most of his money by skinning the rookies.""""You mean,"" cried Betty, translating camp slang into intelligible English, ""that he gets the newly enlisted men to play with him before they have a chance to learn his reputation, and of course gets all their money, because his game is crooked?""""Exactly,"" agreed Sergeant Mullins, his grave face clouding angrily. ""And equally, of course, it's the week following pay day when he makes his big haul. I hope you succeed in getting him,"" he said, turning earnestly to Betty. ""And if there's anything I can do to help, you can count on me.""""Well, it's a comfort anyway,"" said Mollie, as they turned and went into the house, ""to know that he's as bad as we thought he was. And perhaps,"" she added hopefully, ""Sergeant Mullins will be able to help us.""It was more than a week later when the first eagerly looked for letters began to arrive from overseas. It was one day when the promised rush of soldiers into the camp had been fulfilled and the girls were particularly busy entertaining and finding comfortable quarters for their relatives and friends that Mollie whispered the joyful news into Betty's ear.""Letters!"" she cried. ""Letters, honey! Here are yours, two of them, and each one of us others got one apiece. We've decided not to open them until to-night, when we'll have time to read them in comfort. If you'll wait, too--""""Well, it's all over now,"" said Amy, taking her own thick and promising looking letter from her silk blouse where it had rustled and crackled betrayingly all day. ""I don't know about you girls, but I just can't wait another second.""""Oh, please wait just a moment until I get my shoes off,"" begged Grace, sinking down on the edge of the bed and removing the shoes from her aching feet. ""Oh dear,"" she moaned, ""I know I'll have to get a size larger next time, and if I do I'll be ashamed to be seen in the street.""The suggestion was unanimously accepted, and thereafter various soft and filmy garments flew thick and fast as the girls got ready for the treat which had been postponed all through the long, long day,--almost the longest they had ever known.""Come on, Gracie,"" called Mollie, as barely five minutes later three figures sat propped up in the bed, waiting impatiently for the fourth. ""What's the use of primping to-night? Nobody's going to see you.""""Goodness, if I have to work so hard to be beautiful,"" retorted Mollie, holding her letter up to the light in a vain attempt to read its contents through the envelope, ""I'd rather be good and homely and comfortable.""""If all wishes were so easily granted,"" Grace began, but at the look in Mollie's eyes thought better of it. ""I meant,"" she corrected herself blandly, ""that, of course, you can never be anything but beautiful, Mollie.""""Never mind your suspicions, Mollie,"" cried Betty, with a happy ring in her voice, as the last of the quartette climbed in under the covers. ""All that really interests me now is the fact that I have a couple of letters that are just begging to be read."""
"""Just to be original, I suppose,"" answered Betty, striving to speak calmly while a hot flush mounted to her forehead. ""Anyway,"" she added lightly, ""I suppose the best way to satisfy our curiosity would be to read our letters and find out.""""Well, nobody asked you to,"" retorted Grace, slipping back into bed with the precious candy box under her arm. ""And, what's more,"" she added threateningly, ""if you're going to be uncivil, I won't ask you to share my candies.""""Goodness! now isn't that the limit?"" cried Betty suddenly, and they looked at her in surprise. She, in her turn, having thought aloud, flushed and turned back to the letter. ""I'm sorry,"" she stammered. ""I really didn't mean to interrupt you.""There was a little constrained silence after that, no one knowing just how to clear the rather electric atmosphere. They went on reading absorbedly, only the crackling of the paper as they turned a page breaking the deep stillness of the room.""If that doesn't sound just like Roy,"" she said, and they looked up expectantly, relieved at the naturalness of her tone. ""Allen says that he--Roy, that is--was very much impressed with his first sight of a camouflaged ship. Said he had devised a fine scheme of killing off the German army in a hurry. He'd disguise himself as a piece of Limburger cheese, and when the Huns came running to him, he'd simply give them a gentle little tap on the head.""The girls were returning from a rather hurried excursion to a near-by town when they came face to face with the motorcyclist. His motor had evidently stalled, and he was standing in the middle of the road tinkering with it.""Now we have him, what are we going to do with him?"" whispered Mollie, a comical look of chagrin on her face. ""We can't capture him all by ourselves, and we can hardly expect him to wait while we get some one.""But Betty either did not hear or did not want to, for she was approaching the man without a backward glance in their direction. Though not knowing just what was about to happen, the girls followed loyally, close at her heels.""That was just the question I was about to put to you,"" Betty replied, and by her outward composure no one could possibly have guessed how hard her heart was beating. ""We are really quite desirous of knowing all about you.""""You ought to know that without my telling you,"" she said coldly. ""Perhaps you will remember, if I recall it to you, the day you knocked an old woman down in the middle of the road and then rode away without finding out how seriously you had injured her.""""Whoever you are, you're fools,"" he said gruffly, menacingly. ""And if you don't forget all about this thing you've been spouting about, I'll make it pretty darned unpleasant for you. Get me?"" And, with a quick movement, he started his motor and leaped on his machine."
"Betty sprang forward and desperately clutched the handle bars, calling on the girls for assistance, but he roughly pushed her aside. At the same moment the machine leapt forward and Betty knew that he would get away again.Then it was the first miracle happened. Sergeant Mullins, out on a hike with some of the rookies from the camp, the sound of his approach deadened by the putting of the machine, appeared around the turn in the road, coming toward them. To keep from running into the men, which would have meant a nasty spill, the motorcyclist was forced to put on his brake.But Sergeant Mullins, in one swift glance, had already taken in the situation, and as the man tried to start his machine he sprang forward and grasped the handle bars, at the same time shouting orders to his men.""Don't waste your breath, Denham,"" retorted Sergeant Mullins coolly, ""your reputation isn't any too good around these parts, you know, and you'll have plenty of chance to do your shouting to the judge.""Never mind your machine,"" he added sharply, as the fellow's mean eyes glanced about desperately for means of escape. ""The boys will take care of that. And,"" he added meaningly, ""I have rather a life-sized impression that you won't be needing it again for some time to come!""""But what are you going to do with him, now you've got him?"" asked Grace, repeating almost word for word the question Mollie had put only a few minutes before. ""I suppose we've got to get out some sort of definite charge against him.""""Yes,"" said the sergeant thoughtfully. ""We can put him in the guardhouse up at camp till we have a chance to get the township authorities up here. And,"" he added, turning to Betty, ""I'd like to have an interview with that old lady of yours, if you can manage it. We'll have to have her evidence, you know.""""Oh, and isn't it lucky?"" cried Betty, executing a little skip in her excitement. ""She told us only this morning that she was feeling perfectly well again and would go away to-morrow. We were worrying ourselves sick about it, but couldn't think up a single plan to keep her with us. And if she had gone before this happened--"" she stopped, overwhelmed by the mere contemplation of the tragedy.""Yes,"" he said, adding, with a trace of hesitation: ""It won't take long though, and if you don't mind waiting till I get back I'd like to have that talk with the old lady he knocked down. It's necessary to see her as soon as possible.""Sergeant Mullins laughed boyishly, saluted smartly, and turned on his heel to follow the boys who were fast bearing the prisoner to the guardhouse and from there to the just punishment that had been so long in overtaking him.""It's you that ought to be forgiven for calling me names,"" returned Grace, in an injured tone of voice. ""Goodness,"" she cried, a moment later, pointing a moist and tired chocolate in the direction of the horizon. ""Am I mistaken, or is that the stalwart figure of our sergeant approaching in the distance?"" The girls stared for a moment, dazed, bewildered. Stared at the dark head bent in such passionate tenderness over the gray one, stared at the old hands patting the broad young shoulders, tremblingly, joyfully, incredulously, then, with a stifled gasp, turned and fled."
"Betty closed the door softly and followed the girls into their own room where they sank down on arms of chairs or tables or the edge of the bed--any place--and went on staring, only this time at each other.""Goodness! how do we know?"" returned Mollie, wiping two tears from the end of her nose. ""It's all the biggest kind of a m-mystery, anyway. Oh, dear, has anybody got a handkerchief?"" as two other tears threatened to make their appearance. ""I didn't know I had it in me to be such a goose.""""And to think,"" Amy murmured softly, ""that if that old motorcyclist hadn't knocked Mrs. Sanderson down, she would have gone away without finding her son, and the chances are she would never have seen him again.""""I suppose you think we ought to send the motorcyclist a vote of thanks,"" remarked Mollie dryly, recovering herself a little. ""If he keeps on knocking old ladies down in the middle of the road and then gets himself arrested, he may be counted on to do a lot of good in the world.""""Please, please, girls!"" she said, smiling as only Betty knew how to smile. ""What is the use of quarreling about miracles? The most wonderful thing in all the world has happened, and what do we care how it happened? Just think of it!"" she added, leaning forward eagerly. ""Only this morning we were feeling discouraged and down-hearted because Mrs. Sanderson was going away to-morrow and we couldn't think of a thing to do to help her. Then all in one day, in an hour, really, we capture the motorcyclist and find her son for her. It's no wonder I can't seem to make myself believe I haven't dreamed it all,"" she finished, with such a look of utter happiness on her face that Mollie slipped an arm about her and hugged her fondly.""Why, I was just thinking,"" Mollie replied with rare earnestness, ""that, as usual, if it hadn't been for you we probably wouldn't have arrested the gambler--or rather, given Sergeant Mullins a chance to--and so wouldn't have brought him here to find out he belonged to our little old lady.""""I don't suppose you do,"" she said, with fond severity. ""You never do give yourself credit for anything, anyway, Betty Nelson. But who was it, I'd like to know, that first had courage to go up and speak to that criminal?""""Well, I know, but that didn't have anything to do with capturing him,"" argued Betty, determined not to take any more than her share of the credit--and not that, if she could help it. ""If Sergeant Mullins hadn't happened along just at that moment, he'd have gotten away from us the way he did those other times.""""All right,"" laughed Betty. ""I'll admit that much, since you insist. But what earthly difference does it make, anyway, as long as it's done?"" she cried. ""Just think,"" her voice trembled a little, ""how happy those two must be in there! I--I--oh, I can't believe it yet."""
"""And Mrs. Sanderson couldn't have known about his being called Mullins,"" Grace broke in eagerly, ""because we've spoken to her of Sergeant Mullins more than once, and she never acted as though more than casually interested.""""Well, but I suppose that's easily enough explained,"" said Mollie, who was in no mood for details--the actual occurrences being wonderful enough in themselves to occupy her attention for some time to come. ""People often enough change their last names for some reason or other.""On the threshold stood Mrs. Sanderson, her eyes red with weeping, yet her whole face so transformed with joy that the girls would hardly have recognized her as the Mrs. Sanderson of that morning. Instinctively they glanced over her shoulder, expecting to see the tall figure of Sergeant Mullins looming in the background, but he was nowhere to be seen.""He's--he's gone,"" said the little old lady tremulously, seeming to interpret their glances, at the same time coming timidly into the room. ""He told me to tell you,"" her face lighted up still more with that wonderful inward joy, ""that he would have stayed and thanked you young ladies, but he'd made sort of an idiot of himself--so he said--an' would be around later, instead.""""And is he really--really--_really_ your son?"" cried Betty, unable to contain herself longer, pressing the old lady into a chair and kneeling down before her eagerly. ""Oh, we knew you'd come and tell us! We've been so very happy for you.""""Yes, he's my Willie boy,"" answered the little old lady, speaking dreamily as though even yet she was not able to grasp the wonderful thing that had happened to her. ""It's strange when I come to think of it how I knew him right away because, you see, I've always sort o' thought of him as my little son, my baby, and in my mind I've always seen him as he was that day he ran away. But he's really just the same--my little Willie boy--only taller and sort o' broader in the shoulders an' handsomer--"" her voice broke and Betty slipped a sympathetic little hand in hers while the girls gathered closer.""You see, I've been prayin' for this thing for a good many years,"" she went on quaintly, ""an' it looks like Providence sort o' saw fit to answer me at last. An' He jest picked out the sweetes' little ladies He could find to be His instruments.""""You see, his real name is William Mullins Sanderson. But when he ran away he dropped the Sanderson so's they couldn't arrest him for somethin' he didn't do--poor little lad."" Her voice was very soft and her eyes tender. ""He would have come back to me, only he heard that I was dead and thought 'twasn't any use. He said he'd jest been eatin' his heart out, thinkin' of old days an' how he'd promised to make a fortune for us both an' buy a big house where I wouldn't ever have to work again 'less I wanted to. An' now he says,"" she straightened up and her eyes flashed with pride in him, ""he says, soon's the war is over he's goin' to make that old dream come true.""He'd been studyin' to be a lawyer, an' had jest passed his 'bar exams'--so he called 'em--when the war broke out, an' he jes' couldn't resist the call o' the bugle. O' course he couldn't!"" Once more was heard that thrill of pride. ""Wasn't he my Willie boy, who had the blood of fightin' ancestors in his veins as well as brains an' a love o' book larnin' from his pa?It was more than a week after the wonderful discovery in their Sergeant Mullins as Mrs. Sanderson's long lost son, and until this afternoon the girls had hardly been able to find a minute to get together and discuss the remarkable affair.Mollie had suggested a spin in the machine, and the girls had eagerly assented, anxious to blow the cobwebs of hard work and confinement from their brains and get out on the open road where they could think clearly and freely.But they were not disappointed. There were not only letters from the boys, but several fat and interesting epistles from friends and relatives in Deepdale, including two from Paul and Dodo, Mollie's small and mischievous brother and sister."
"""Let's drive away out of town where we can be by ourselves,"" Betty suggested, face radiant, fingers fairly aching to tear the precious missives from their envelopes. ""Then we can stop the car and Mollie can read hers, too.""""You always have the right idea, Betty honey,"" said Mollie, with fond emphasis, as she swung the car at breakneck speed down the street and headed for the open country. ""Now aren't you glad,"" she flung at Grace and Amy, ""that we made you go back with us and take a chance?""""Don't rub it in, Mollie dear,"" purred Grace, too happy at the prospect before them to contradict anything or anybody on earth. ""We are deeply appreciative and inordinately grateful to you for your wonderful foresight and insistence.""""Is she calling me names?"" cried Mollie threateningly. ""For if she is, I should like to remark for the benefit of each and every one that I am still in possession of the wheel, and a swift and terrible doom shall overtake--""""Rave on, rave on, Macbeth,"" chuckled Betty, adding with a whimsical smile and a quickened heart beat as she fingered the letter she had so carefully placed under the rest: ""There's no use, Mollie dear--you can't start a rumpus now. It can't be done. We're all too good-natured.""""Just the same, I'd wager anything,"" cried Betty, with a thrill in her voice and the hint of tears behind the brightness of her eyes, ""that there isn't one of us who wouldn't be willing to make biscuits from morning till night if we only had the boys here to eat them.""""He's delirious,"" said Betty simply, adding, with the ring of pride in her voice: ""He seemed two inches taller when he told me about it. Oh, the spirit of our boys--the wonderful spirit of them! It can't take them long, it can't, when they once get started!""""I haven't seen her yet,"" said Betty, her face sobering a little. But it brightened again as she added with conviction: ""I think we know enough about that little lady to be sure she'll take it standing up and be prouder than ever of her 'Willie boy.'""""Of course she will,"" said Grace softly, her eyes following the red disc of the sun as it sank slowly in the west. ""We're all awfully proud of them, but I don't think any of us can help wishing that it were all over instead of just beginning, and that the boys were coming home to us victorious.""""We shouldn't be human if we didn't feel that way,"" said Betty soberly. ""But we haven't come to the joyful part, yet. Just now we've got to keep cheerful and hold on hard to our hope and faith in the future. We owe that to the boys, the boys who are fighting, perhaps dying for us, more than we owe it to ourselves.""Goodness, it's you who made us forget them, Betty Nelson,"" cried Grace, squeezing the Little Captain's hand fondly, then falling to with a will on her own momentarily neglected mail. ""Just see,"" she added wickedly, holding up two letters with the coveted foreign postmark before their envious eyes, ""what an advantage it is to have a brother in the army as well as a--a--""""Well, go ahead,"" Betty teased, while the others laughed delightedly at her flaming color. ""What is that other thing you've got besides a brother, the mere mention of whose name makes you the color of a beet?--I should say,"" correcting herself with a demure little smile, ""the color of a flaming sunset--""""Well, she at least said you were graceful,"" chuckled Betty, tearing open a letter from Deepdale and still reserving the best till the last. ""Anyway,"" she added, ""we have better things to do than to engage in useless controversy."""
