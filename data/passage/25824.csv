passage
"""That won't do,"" said he. ""Somebody might come to the window and close the shutter; and then our nest would fall to the ground. And if we happened to have six or eight eggs in it, you know you wouldn't like that very well.""Rusty's wife agreed with him on that point. But she still insisted that she wanted to live near the farmhouse; and she said that she expected her husband to find a good spot for their nest, for she certainly wasn't going to spend the summer in a hole in a fence-rail, or in an old apple tree, either.Rusty Wren saw at once that there was no sense in arguing with her. If he wanted any peace, he knew that he might as well forget the old hollow apple tree and the hole in the fence-rail too. He had better forget them and resume his search for a home. So he gave his plump little cinnamon-colored body a shake and held his tail at even a higher angle than usual, just to show people that he was going to be the head of the house--when they should have one. Then with a flirt of his short, round wings he hurried over to Farmer Green's dooryard--after calling to his wife that he would come back and tell her if he had any luck.Rusty Wren spent some busy moments about Farmer Green's buildings. And since he loved to be busy and was never so happy as when he had something important to do, he hopped and climbed and fluttered to his heart's content, looking into a hundred different holes and cracks and crannies.But he didn't find a single one that suited him. Every place into which he peered was either too big or too little, or too high or too low; or it was where the rain would beat upon it; or maybe it was so situated that the cat could thrust her paw inside. Anyhow, every possible nook for a nest had some drawback. And Rusty was wondering what he could say to his wife, who was sure to be upset if her plans went wrong, when all at once he came upon the finest place for a house that he had ever seen. One quick look through the small round opening that led to it was enough.At that the bustling little pair hastened toward the farmhouse. And, to Rusty's delight, the moment his wife saw what he had found she said at once that it was exactly the sort of house she had always hoped to have, some time.He found the idea in the weekly paper which the letter-carrier left each Friday in the mail box at the crossroads. On the Children's Page Johnnie read a story about a pair of house wrens. And he learned then that an old tin can nailed to a tree makes exactly the sort of house that wrens like.Well, Johnnie Green began at once to look for a tin can. He had made up his mind that he would try to coax a couple of those busy little songsters to nest near-by, where he could have fun watching them.Not finding an _old_ tin can that suited him, Johnnie took a shiny maple syrup can, which his father said he might have. It seemed to him that it was just the kind he needed, for the only opening in it was a small round hole in the top, hardly bigger than a twenty-five-cent piece. (The story in the weekly paper said that the wrens' doorway should be as small as that, so that no ruffianly English sparrows could enter the house and disturb the little people that were to dwell there.)Johnnie Green punched a few nail holes in the sides of the syrup can, because he thought that if _he_ lived in such a place, he would want plenty of fresh air. Then he nailed a board to the can. And next he nailed the board to a cherry tree close to the house."
"Since their search was ended, the tiny pair began building their nest right then and there. In a surprisingly short time they had completely filled their new house with twigs. And as soon as they had done that much, in the center of the mass of twigs they built a nest of dried grasses, singing the merriest of songs while they worked.Of course, Johnnie Green was delighted. All the time the lively little couple were at work upon their new home it was easy to find Johnnie. But it was hard to get him to do any errands, because he didn't want to stir from the dooryard, he was so interested in what was going on.Farmer Green, too, seemed pleased. And though he didn't spend much time watching Mr. and Mrs. Rusty (he said that he had to work, the same as they), he remarked to Johnnie that he was glad to see that the newcomers were already paying rent for their house.One might think that Farmer Green would have had some trouble awaking so early in the morning. And perhaps he might have overslept now and then had he not had a never-failing alarm clock to arouse him.It was not one of those man-made clocks, which go off with a deafening clatter and bring a startled body to his feet before he is really awake. No! Farmer Green had something much pleasanter than that; and it was not in his bedroom, either.Every morning, without fail, Rusty sang his dawn song right under Farmer Green's window. His musical trill, sounding very much like the brook that rippled its way down the side of Blue Mountain, always made Farmer Green feel glad that another day had come.To be sure, Johnnie Green--sitting up and rubbing his eyes sleepily--sometimes wished that Rusty would skip his dawn song once in a while. And he told his father at breakfast one day that since he was not a bird, he saw no reason why he should get up with the sun.Johnnie remembered that such habits were supposed to make one ""healthy, wealthy and wise."" And since he hated to take medicine, and was trying to save enough money to buy him a gun, and disliked to be kept in after school for not knowing his lessons, he decided that perhaps it was just as well, after all, to follow Rusty Wren's example.Now, Farmer Green spoke so often and so pleasantly of Rusty Wren, saying that nobody could want a better little alarm clock than he, that Rusty began to take a great deal of pride in his morning task of awakening the household. It could hardly be called a task, however, because Rusty thoroughly enjoyed singing, though when he sang--as when he did anything else--he put every ounce of his strength into the effort. With his head lifted as high as his short neck would permit, and his tail (which usually stuck pertly upwards) drooping downward, as if he had for the moment forgotten it, he poured forth his music with such fervor that his small body actually trembled. Before Rusty Wren came to live in Farmer Green's dooryard the family had been known to oversleep now and then. Working hard all day long as everybody did (except Johnnie Green, who played hard enough--goodness knows!), they slept very soundly at night. And two or three times every summer they were sure to rise late, just by accident.Though such a mishap always annoyed Farmer Green, it never troubled either the hired man or Johnnie in the least. On the contrary, they seemed to enjoy those occasions. But with Rusty Wren to rouse them at dawn all that was changed. And Farmer Green remarked one day that one thing was certain; they would lose no time that summer by staying in bed too long."
"Those surprises pleased Johnnie and his mother so much that when he went to bed that night Farmer Green felt even happier than was usual with him. He went to bed somewhat early because he said he had more work than ever to do the next day, on account of his having gone to the village.""I don't see what's come over me,"" said Farmer Green. ""I don't hear that wren singing right under my window any more. I thought that maybe the cat had caught him. But there he is this very moment, on that limb!""""I wish that new clock I brought home day before yesterday was an alarm clock,"" he said. ""Then I wouldn't have to worry about waking up on time.... Anyhow, I ought to hear the wren again to-morrow morning.""It was all on account of one of those surprises that Farmer Green had brought home from the village. For without intending to do any such thing, Farmer Green had surprised Rusty Wren as well as Johnnie and his mother.""Matter?"" cried Rusty Wren. ""Here I've sung my best for Farmer Green all summer, and waked him at dawn every morning without fail! And what do you suppose he's done? He has brought home a strange bird from the village, because he doesn't care for my singing.""""It _said_ 'Cuckoo!'"" Rusty explained. ""But if it's a cuckoo, it's different from any other I've ever heard. You know yourself that Black Bill Cuckoo who lives in the bushes beyond the orchard says '_Cow, cow!_'""""He's telling Farmer Green that it's time to get up!"" Rusty exclaimed indignantly. ""And since Farmer Green has seen fit to get somebody else to wake him, I certainly shall not trouble myself on his account any more.""So Rusty Wren flew away to the orchard to sing his dawn song. Jolly Robin, who lived there, in an old apple tree, was surprised to hear Rusty Wren singing in that neighborhood so early. And he was still more astonished at Rusty's melody.It is easy to understand why Farmer Green and his family overslept, when one knows that Rusty Wren no longer sang his dawn song beneath Farmer Green's window. And when Rusty saw that the whole household never stirred until long after sunrise, he was so pleased that he couldn't help making a few remarks about the new bird in the farmhouse, which had annoyed him so by singing ""Cuckoo! cuckoo!""""This stranger is a very poor songster!"" Rusty said to his wife. ""All he can sing is 'Cuckoo! cuckoo!' in that silly way of his. He has no trills and runs and ripples at all! And he can't even repeat his song ten times a minute, as I give mine. He has to wait at least half an hour before he cries 'Cuckoo! cuckoo!' again. And no one but a simpleton would ever attempt to awaken a hard-working farmer by such half-hearted singing."""
"As time went on, and the Green family overslept each morning, Rusty began to grow very weary of the monotonous ""Cuckoo! cuckoo!"" which came every half hour, all day long, through the kitchen window of the farmhouse.But the stranger never stirred out of the kitchen. And at length Rusty decided to make inquiries about him. Seeing Jimmy Rabbit passing through the orchard on his way home from the cabbage-patch, Rusty called to him.""If you happen to see old Mr. Crow, I wish you would ask him if he won't please come right over to the orchard,"" Rusty Wren said. ""There's something I want to find out. And Mr. Crow knows so much that perhaps he can help me.""Jimmy Rabbit declared that he would be delighted to deliver the message. And he must have gone out of his way to find Mr. Crow, for the old gentleman arrived at the orchard in less than sixteen minutes.Old Mr. Crow pondered for a while before answering. He reflected that since it was long past corn-planting time, it really made no difference to him whether Farmer Green overslept or not. If the corn had just been put in the ground, he would have liked to have Farmer Green stay in bed all day long.""I understand that the whole family enjoys your songs,"" Mr. Crow told Rusty at last. ""And for the present you may as well sing your dawn song right here in your own tree, beneath Farmer Green's window. But if you're living here next spring, I wish you would consult me again.""Rusty Wren agreed to that, thanking Mr. Crow for his kindness, too. And, afterward, instead of being angry, he laughed whenever he heard that silly ""Cuckoo! cuckoo!"" Since he knew it was only a wooden bird, Rusty Wren was jealous no longer. Rusty Wren's wife was a very neat housekeeper. Every day she carefully cleaned her house, chirping while she worked. Sometimes her voice was sweet and pleasant. But at other times--though it was still sweet--it was not pleasant at all. And whenever Rusty heard that second kind of chirp he was always careful to find some errand that took him away from home.You see, Rusty Wren was not so orderly as his wife. Often he scattered things about the house in a very careless fashion. For instance, if he happened to notice a bit of moss--or a burr--clinging to his coat, just as likely as not he would brush it off and let it fall upon the floor. And when Mrs. Rusty found anything like that in her cottage, she always knew how it came there."
"One day after he had come home from an excursion to the pasture (he seldom strayed so far from home as that!), Mrs. Rusty began sniffing the air. Her nose would have wrinkled--only it couldn't, because it was so hard. She looked at her husband suspiciously. And it seemed to her that he had a guilty manner.Just then he happened to notice a bit of something or other clinging to one of his tail feathers. And though his wife was looking straight at him, he flicked the tiny scrap upon the floor, without thinking what he was doing.""There you go again!"" Mrs. Rusty Wren cried. ""Here I've just finished cleaning the house and you're littering it all up! You don't care how much work you make for me."" And she pounced upon the brownish bit, intending to pick it up and throw it out of the house. Rusty Wren edged toward the door--that little opening in the syrup can, only slightly bigger than a twenty-five-cent piece. He wished he was already safely through it, for he did not like the look in his wife's eyes.""On my clean floor!"" his wife interrupted. ""Goodness knows it's bad enough to have you forever doing things like that without your bringing _tobacco_ into my clean house--and without smelling of smoke, too.""For almost the first time in his life Rusty Wren was really worried. Somehow, he had managed to get into something a good deal like a scrape. It seemed to him that the house was terribly hot and stuffy; and always before he had thought it quite comfortable.""I'm going out for a breath of fresh air,"" he protested feebly. And before Mrs. Rusty could stop him he dodged past her and slipped through the tiny doorway, leaving her to scold to her heart's content.Never before had he stayed away from his snug house so long. And, naturally, that made him have a guilty feeling, as if he had really done something to be ashamed of. As for smoking, he had (as he said) never smoked in his life. It was true that Farmer Green was burning stumps in the pasture that morning, and that the odor of the smoke had clung to Rusty's feathers.But the bit of tobacco that had clung to his tail was a mystery that he couldn't explain. It was a most unfortunate accident. But Rusty hoped that by that time--it was then the middle of the afternoon--he hoped that his wife had recovered from her displeasure. Usually, when they had any little difference of opinion, she felt better if he gave her plenty of time in which to scold. But now Rusty was not quite sure of his welcome. He had never seen Mrs. Rusty so upset."
"""The smoker has come home again,"" a peevish voice called out. And instead of bursting into the merry song which Rusty had been all ready to carol, he flew off across the yard and began hunting for something to eat. After Rusty Wren had revived his drooping spirits by eating heartily of three dozen insects of different kinds and sizes, he felt so cheerful that he couldn't help trilling a few songs. It was almost evening; and he was glad not to let the sun go down without thanking him in that way for shining so brightly all day.Now, above the wide door of the carriage house a window was open--a window through which Rusty had flown early in the morning. Unlike old Mr. Crow, Rusty Wren was not in the least afraid to enter any of the farm buildings. Perhaps if Rusty had been in the habit of taking Farmer Green's corn he would have thought twice before he ventured inside the cow barn or the carriage house. But since he never damaged the crops, and always helped them by destroying a great number of insects that ate all sorts of growing things, Rusty had nothing whatever to fear from anybody in the farmhouse--except the cat, of course.There was really no reason for Rusty's flying through the open window, beyond the fact that he liked to prowl around the great, dusty room under the eaves, to see what he could find. Once he was inside, he noticed something that had not caught his eye on his former visit. Hanging from a rafter, where the slanting rays of the setting sun fell squarely upon it, was a big bunch of brown tobacco leaves.""I'll go right home and get her and bring her here so she can see this tobacco herself!"" he said aloud. ""Then she'll know where that shred came from which fell on the floor."" He did not say ""which I brushed onto the floor,"" for he never could remember long that he ever did such careless things. When Johnnie Green fastened the tin can to the tree in the dooryard he couldn't have picked out a better spot for it. Of course, he hoped that a pair of wrens would build their nest inside the syrup can. But what he never dreamed was that the cherry tree was exactly the sort of tree that wrens liked.It was not that Rusty and his wife cared for cherries. But as soon as Mrs. Wren had said how much she liked her new house, she remarked that the old cherry tree was a fine place to hunt for bugs and insects.Not being fond of cherries, they did not look forward to the time when the bright red fruit should hang gaily upon the branches above their home. But there were others--besides Johnnie Green--who eagerly awaited that time and noticed that the old tree was loaded with blossoms, which meant that later there would be plenty of cherries.Jolly Robin was one of those who had a taste for cherries, no matter whether they grew wild in the woods or within easy reach in Farmer Green's yard. And as soon as cherry time arrived Jolly was on hand every day to enjoy the treat.He was so cheerful and good-natured that Rusty Wren and his wife did not object to Jolly's visits--so long as he did not venture too near their house. They always scolded loudly when an outsider came too close to their home, for they had a big family of children, and they couldn't help feeling that the youngsters were safer with no prying busybodies to meddle with them.Of course, Jolly Robin never once thought of harming any of Rusty's family. And as soon as he saw that Rusty--and especially his wife--wanted him to keep away from their side of the tree, he took care to respect their wishes.At last, however, Jolly Robin made a remark one day that threw both Rusty and his wife into a flutter of alarm. Jolly Robin had not meant to frighten them. But the news was out before he realized that it was far from welcome to his two little listeners."
"""Jasper Jay has heard about these cherries,"" he announced. ""And he says he's coming over here as soon as he can find time, for he is specially fond of all kinds of cherries, no matter whether they're red cherries or black cherries or choke cherries.""He could easily see that Jolly Robin's speech had upset her. And, to tell the truth, he did not himself relish the prospect of a visit from anybody as boisterous and quarrelsome as that famous bully, Jasper Jay. As soon as she heard that Jasper Jay intended to visit her cherry tree, to enjoy the ripe fruit, Rusty Wren's wife began to worry. And she made herself so unhappy that Rusty couldn't help wishing that Jolly Robin had kept his news to himself.""He's a great, cruel bully,"" she replied. ""And if he spends much time here I'm afraid the children will starve, for neither you nor I will be able to go out and find food for them, because Jasper would be sure to pounce on us; and what chance would we have against him?""Meanwhile the racket on the roof continued, with only a short pause between each outburst. The six Wren children began to cry--for they were hungry as well as frightened. And all the time Mrs. Rusty clung to her husband's coat-tails and besought him not to leave her.To tell the truth, he had no such intention. Though he was very brave for his size, he was thoroughly alarmed. And for the time being he was quite content to stay inside his snug house and hope that the trouble would soon come to an end.On the whole, the Wren family spent a very unpleasant quarter of an hour. The _bang, clatter, bang_ on their roof still continued until the din became almost unbearable. And Rusty Wren grew so desperate that he had almost made up his mind to break away from his wife, even if he had to leave his coat-tails behind him, and dash out of doors to see what was the matter. ""It's Jasper Jay!"" Rusty Wren cried, as soon as he and his wife heard the hoarse cry outside their house. ""He's playing one of his tricks on us. And I'm going out and tell him exactly what I think of him.""""How shall I frighten them, then?"" Jasper Jay asked him. ""Perhaps you like this way better!"" he shouted. And with that he flew straight at Rusty Wren. He was so big and he looked so cruel that Rusty turned tail and dashed back into his house again. And he was glad that his doorway was not much bigger than a twenty-five-cent piece, because he knew that Jasper Jay could never squeeze through so small an opening.""That blue jay is teasing my little wrens!"" Johnnie Green cried indignantly. And, catching up a potato from the kitchen table, he hurried to the door and hurled it as hard as he could at the blue-coated trouble-maker."
"And then it was Jasper Jay's turn to be alarmed. He jumped off the roof of Rusty Wren's house as if he had been shot and dashed off as fast as his handsome wings could carry him. He knew of no way to tease Johnnie Green; so there was really no sense in his staying in Farmer Green's yard any longer.Although the cherries hung red and juicy upon the old tree for at least a week longer, just begging to be picked--as one might say--Jasper Jay did not come back to enjoy them. He told Jolly Robin that he was entirely too busy to waste his time in an old cherry tree. It seemed to take Rusty Wren's wife a long time to recover from the fright that Jasper Jay had given her. He had amused himself by dropping cherries upon the roof of her house. But the trick had not amused the Wren family in the least.Even after Johnnie Green had driven the blue-coated rascal away from the dooryard Mrs. Rusty Wren was all aflutter. She jumped at the slightest noise. And she was so nervous that Rusty soon saw that it was a great effort for her to go abroad for food for their hungry family.So Rusty Wren took up his task cheerfully. He found it no easy one, either. Feeding six growing youngsters had kept both their parents working every minute all day long, because the children were always clamoring for more food. And now they seemed half starved, for they had had nothing to eat all the time that Jasper Jay had kept Rusty and his wife hiding in their house.Rusty Wren, however, was not one to complain, no matter what happened. And every day from dawn till dark he hurried out of the house to find some toothsome insect, and bring it home to drop it into somebody's yawning mouth.Indeed, he was so busy feeding his family that he scarcely had a chance to eat anything himself. So he grew quite thin. And though he still sang as merrily as ever, his wife noticed the change that had come over him. The news of Rusty Wren's sign, ""Boy Wanted,"" spread like wildfire through the whole of Pleasant Valley. Rusty had put the sign out at daybreak. And before sunset as many as fifty of the field and forest people had come shyly to Farmer Green's dooryard.There were others, too, such as Fatty Coon and Tommy Fox, who said that while they didn't care to visit Farmer Green's place in the daytime, they expected to call there during the night and take a look at Rusty Wren's home and the odd sign upon it.Yet it proved to be a very bad day for Rusty's family, because he had almost no time at all in which to try to bring home any food. No sooner had he talked with one caller than another knocked at his door. And so the steady stream of strangers kept him busy as a little red wagon, as Farmer Green would remark.It was a discouraging business, to say the least. Though Rusty had advertised for a ""boy,"" persons of all ages appeared and wanted to work for him. Some of them were old enough to be his grandfather. And, what was worse, they were all so big that they couldn't squeeze through Rusty's little round door. (The hole in the syrup can, you will remember, was only slightly larger than a quarter of a dollar.)"
"Of course, there was no use of his hiring a helper that could do only half the work. What Rusty wanted was somebody that could not only catch an insect, but bring it right inside the house and drop it into the mouth of one of his children.At last when Rusty had almost given up all hope of finding anyone of the required size, a young English sparrow flew up and said boldly that he was the very person for the position. He claimed that he could get in and out of Rusty's door without any trouble. And he was just about to prove his claim, too, when Rusty Wren stopped him.""Ha!"" cried the stranger impertinently. ""It's easy to see that your wife rules the house. And, since that's the case, I'm very glad I'm not going to work for you."" He flew away then, with a jeering laugh which made Rusty Wren feel quite uncomfortable.He was a likely-looking lad, who wore a bay cap on his head. And he had excellent manners, too. He said ""Good-evening!"" to Rusty very pleasantly and touched his cap. No doubt he would have taken it off had it not grown right on his head. ""I see you want a boy,"" he observed.""He comes from a good family,"" Mrs. Rusty admitted. ""But don't you know that the Chippys are bigger than we are? Not much bigger, to be sure. But Mr. Chippy certainly couldn't get through our doorway.""""But I have a feeling that this is going to lead to trouble,"" she said once more. Rusty Wren said, ""Nonsense!"" He was overjoyed at the prospect of having a spry young helper. And he hurried out to tell Mr. Chippy's son that he might start to work at daybreak.""Of course he isn't much of a singer,"" she remarked to Rusty, ""but he seems to have a quick eye for an insect, and he is kind to the children. He is very neat, besides. I have watched him sharply,"" she added, ""and I haven't caught him tracking any dirt into the house--nor brushing any off his clothes onto my clean floor, either.""""He's a spry worker,"" he said. ""And he can get through our door as easily as I can. He went in and out of the house two hundred and fifty-seven times to-day; and not once did he get stuck in the doorway."""
"For several days everything went so smoothly in Rusty Wren's household that his wife began to feel more like herself again. Jasper Jay did not come near their house to annoy them; and there was plenty of food for all--thanks to the untiring efforts of Chippy, Jr. Though she tried her hardest, Mrs. Rusty couldn't think of anything to worry about. And her husband frequently remarked that it was a lucky day for all of them when he decided to hire a boy.So interested were Rusty and his wife in their children that they failed to see that Chippy, Jr., was growing likewise. Indeed, he now overtopped Rusty by half a head. But the Wrens--both husband and wife--entirely overlooked that fact.Neither did they happen to notice that Chippy, Jr., was beginning to have a good deal of trouble squeezing through the door. For some reason--due, perhaps, to the way the opening was made--for some reason he could get into the house more easily than he could get out of it.Since he continued to grow from day to day there could be but one outcome. And at last when Rusty came home late one afternoon with a plump insect in his bill he found Chippy, Jr., blocking the doorway. His head peered through the round opening. And his face wore a worried expression.""Ah! That was the trouble,"" Rusty told poor Chippy, Jr., who looked quite distressed. ""I was trying to pull you out; and she was trying to pull you in. But you mustn't mind a little mistake like that.""That plan worked better. In a short time Mr. Chippy's unlucky son suddenly slipped backward, knocking Mrs. Rusty Wren flat on her back. And Rusty himself tumbled into the house and fell on top of the heap.""Matter?"" she groaned. ""Here's this great lout of a boy inside our house! And we'll never be able to get rid of him. Instead of his helping us to feed our children, we shall have to feed him! And now we are worse off than we ever were before.""""I begin to think that it was all planned this way by his father,"" Mrs. Rusty told her husband, ""so Mr. Chippy wouldn't have to take care of his son. But I don't intend to adopt a big, overgrown boy like him--not when I have six small children of my own!""""Well,"" said Rusty Wren, ""I don't know how you're going to leave our house if you can't squeeze through the door. So I'll hurry over and tell your father about this trouble, and he can break the news gently to your mother."""
"""It's just like being caught in a trap!"" he exclaimed. ""And I can't help feeling that you've played a trick on my son--probably to please Johnnie Green.... If you don't set my boy free to-morrow morning at daybreak, I shall certainly make trouble for you.""""I'm so deep in trouble now,"" he told Mr. Chippy, ""there's nothing you can do to make matters any worse for me. I've six growing children to bring up; and now I have your son to take care of; and my wife thinks everything is my fault, because I wanted to hire a boy to help me catch insects.Rusty Wren did not like to listen to him. So he flew back home and went to bed. He only wished that it were possible for Mr. Chippy to break into his house and rescue Chippy, Jr. But since the house was made of tin, Rusty knew that Mr. Chippy was helpless. The next morning Rusty Wren awakened with a start. Somebody was pounding at his door--and shouting his name, as well. He jumped out of bed to see what was the matter. And, looking outside, he beheld Mr. Chippy, with sixteen of his cousins, all very much excited--if one might judge by their actions.""I don't care to argue with you?"" Mr. Chippy replied. ""Just let me have Chippy, Jr., or we'll come inside your house and get him. We'll make trouble for you, too. Perhaps you didn't know that kidnapping a child is a very serious act. I've already asked Solomon Owl's opinion about this matter; and he advises me to take my child away from you by force, if necessary.""That, however, was as far as he was able to go. His shoulders were altogether too broad for the small, round passage. And though his relations attempted to push him into the house, they soon saw that they would never succeed in their undertaking.Though he was usually very mild, Mr. Chippy grew terribly angry the moment he heard Rusty's laughter. His sixteen cousins began to scold, too. Again they tried to crowd through Rusty Wren's door. And they made such an uproar that when Johnnie Green stepped out of the farmhouse before breakfast he couldn't help noticing them.""That doesn't sound like a wren!"" he exclaimed. ""It sounds exactly like a chipping sparrow!"" Then, as he looked, he saw Chippy, Jr.'s, head, with its bright bay cap, peer through the mouth of the syrup can."
"Naturally, Chippy, Jr., did not like to be called a ""beggar."" But he couldn't very well prevent Farmer Green from saying whatever he pleased. So he kept still, while Johnnie Green quickly opened a great hole in Rusty's house. Then Johnnie carefully lifted Chippy, Jr., out of his prison and gave him a toss into the air.And Rusty and his wife were so glad to see the last of Chippy, Jr., that afterward they never objected in the least when Johnnie Green called them ""my wrens."" They had discovered that he was a good friend to have. Rusty Wren's cousin, Long Bill, lived in the reeds on the bank of Black Creek. Although everybody called him ""Long Bill,"" like Rusty Wren he was actually short and chubby. His bill, however, was much longer than Rusty's. You see, he belonged to one branch of the Marsh Wren family; and they all had bills like that.It was not often that Rusty met this cousin of his, for Rusty seldom ventured so far from home as Black Creek. And being very fond of water, Long Bill did not care to spend any of his valuable time in Farmer Green's dooryard.Of course, there was the duck pond not far away--and the river, too. But the only water really close to Rusty's home was the watering-trough. And that was entirely too small to please Long Bill Wren. So no one ever saw him around the farm buildings.""I won't come in,"" said Jolly (of course he couldn't have, anyhow--being far too big to get through Rusty's door!). ""I won't come in, for I merely want to give you a message. Old Mr. Crow came to the orchard to-day and he asked me to deliver an invitation from your cousin who lives near Black Creek."" As soon as they reached the orchard, Jolly Robin exclaimed, ""There's old Mr. Crow now, over there on the fence! He's come back to get your answer and take it to Long Bill Wren. I'll have to tell him you're sorry--but you're going to be too busy to-morrow to go to the party.""Jolly Robin stopped and sat down on a branch of an apple tree, he was so surprised. ""My dear sir!"" he cried. ""You seem to have forgotten that your wife said you wouldn't be able to accept Long Bill's invitation.""""Good!"" cried Jolly Robin. ""I'm glad to see that you don't let your wife manage your affairs, though I _have_ heard differently about you, for some people say that----"" He stopped abruptly and looked carefully around. Whatever it may have been that he was about to say, for some reason he did not care to have his wife hear it. And he happened to think that perhaps Mrs. Robin might be near-by."
"The next morning Rusty Wren helped his wife so spryly that long before midday the house-cleaning was finished. Although she tried her best, Mrs. Rusty could think of no more tasks for her husband to do--except to feed the children. That was a duty that would not be finished until they were old enough to leave home and shift for themselves.""I think,"" said Rusty, as he moved about uncomfortably under his wife's gaze, ""I think that since I've a little time to spare I'd better go and see Mr. Frog, the tailor. You know you've been telling me that my Sunday coat is beginning to look shiny--and I suppose I really ought to have a new one.""Now, she did not know that Mr. Frog had moved. She thought his shop was on the banks of Broad Brook. But that was just another mistake of hers. And if she had known where his tailoring parlors were then located, she would certainly have raised a good many objections to Rusty's visiting them on the day of his cousin's party. For Mr. Frog's shop was on the banks of Black Creek, where Long Bill Wren spent his summers. The shadows were lengthening--for the sun was far over in the west--when Rusty Wren reached Mr. Frog's tailor's shop overlooking Black Creek. Rusty pushed open the door and stepped inside, expecting to find Mr. Frog sitting cross-legged upon his table and sewing busily, according to the tailor's custom, until sunset, which marked the close of Mr. Frog's working day.""How-dy do!"" he said, almost before he had picked himself up. ""If you have come to see me on business, I'm sorry to say that I can't do anything for you to-day.... The fact is, I'm going to a singing-party this evening. And I don't want to be late.""""Then come right along now!"" Mr. Frog cried heartily. ""We'll go together. For I'm sure that Long Bill didn't mean to forget me. You know we're the best of friends. I make all his clothes for him; and he has never yet paid me a penny.""It is not strange that Rusty Wren should feel a little uncomfortable at the prospect of arriving at a party with a person who had received no invitation to it. But he could think of no way of ridding himself of Mr. Frog's company. So the two started off together towards the home of Long Bill Wren.If there were no other guests to be seen, neither was there any indication of a party about Long Bill's home. There was nothing to eat anywhere in sight; and no flag, nor gay Chinese lantern, nor decoration of any other kind adorned his house.Rusty Wren had always thought his cousin's house a strange dwelling. Made of coarse grasses and reed stalks, it was round, like a big ball, with a doorway in one side. This queer building was fastened among the reeds a little distance above the ground. And it seemed to Rusty Wren that it must be a damp and unhealthful place to live."
"The words were scarcely out of his large mouth when Long Bill thrust his head and shoulders out of his door--for he had heard the voices in his front yard. He had on a shocking old coat--not at all the sort one would choose to wear when one expected guests.Now, Rusty Wren wished he had not called at Mr. Frog's shop at all. If he had only come straight to his cousin's house, he thought that he would have spared himself--and his cousin, too--a good deal of trouble. And, since he didn't know what to say, he kept still for a few moments and let the others do all the talking.""My party!"" he cried. ""Why, I know of no party here! Somebody has made a mistake. I haven't given a party for a year--just a year ago to-day.... I invited you at that time,"" he told Rusty Wren, ""but you didn't come. And I never received any word from you about the matter.""""Ah! I see it all now,"" said Long Bill. And he began to laugh merrily. ""Mr. Crow's poor memory is to blame for your mistake. He forgot to deliver the message last year. And he happened to remember it only yesterday. So the news reached you just twelve months too late.""But Mr. Frog soon said that so far as he was concerned, he still had a singing-party that he could attend, so he didn't feel sad very long. And, after all, Rusty was glad to see his cousin, Long Bill Wren. They had a pleasant chat together for almost an hour. And Long Bill invited Rusty to stay to dinner.When he returned to the old cherry tree Rusty had to answer a good many questions. His wife wanted to know what had kept him so long, and what Mr. Frog said, and what color his new Sunday coat was going to be.These delightful stories in which well known birds and insects are the characters are based upon actual natural history facts, and while the youngster eagerly listens to them, a moral foundation of deeper importance is being laid.
