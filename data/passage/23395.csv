passage
This book is prepared for teachers and pupils who use the Illinois State Course of Study. The outline in Orthography for the Seventh and Eighth Years is the basis of all that is included herein. Three fifths or more of this work is word analysis which, valuable as it is, teachers as a rule are unable to teach without the aid of a text, never having learned much of it themselves. What, for example, can the average teacher unaided do toward writing a list of words to be analyzed which contain the root _ann_, meaning year? He might turn in the dictionary to _annual_, _anniversary_, and _annuity_, but he must fall back on his acquired knowledge for such as, _biennial_, _centennial_, _millennium_, _perennial_, and _superannuate_. And having the list, very many teachers, as well as pupils, need help in the analysis.Emphasis has been placed upon word analysis. The author believes that this has more value in education than is generally attributed to it. When Mr. Kennedy named his work on word analysis “What Words Say”, he gave it the best possible title. Composite words have a wealth of meaning; each syllable is significant. And, as a rule, only to those who can read this significance does the word yield its full meaning. Accuracy is the mark of a scholar. Accuracy in speech and in the understanding of speech cannot be attained by those whose knowledge of words is vague and general. Pupils should early learn how to interpret _what words say_, and to discriminate carefully in the use of words, for these are the tools which they are to use in all the various departments for acquiring knowledge.Not only will such a study improve a person's language greatly, but it will, at the same time, do much to improve the clearness and precision of his thinking; thought and language have a reciprocal effect.If a child, while young, can be made to be interested in words themselves,—their origin, their exact meaning, their relations to each other and some of the changes in their meaning which result from their use,—he will be likely to retain that interest through life; it will be more likely to increase than to diminish.It seems often to be assumed that a student can do nothing profitably with the study of words made up from Greek and Latin roots till he has acquired some mastery of those languages. But I know from experience and much observation that this is not true. Why should it be? Must one master Greek and Latin before he can understand that, in English words, _graph_ means write; _ge_ means earth; _phone_ means sound; _cur_ means run; _fin_ means limit; _port_ means carry, etc.?Of course, we know that many words in common use have shades of meaning quite different from, and in some cases almost opposite to, their literal significance. But will not the student be better able to understand these derived meanings by knowing their literal significance than in any other way? At any rate, I am fully persuaded that such a study of words as this book proposes can be made very profitable to those pupils for whose use it is prepared.The teacher will find, however, that the teaching of this subject will require much careful labor on his part. The mere learning of the meaning of prefixes and suffixes and of the roots themselves, with the brief remarks on the meaning of some of the words, will need to be supplemented by a careful mastery of it all on his part. And to this must be added much thought of his own, together with careful research in the great dictionaries. But to the earnest and intelligent teacher, such thought and research will yield very rich fruit in his own thinking, and in his use of English speech.2. All words given for the first month's work are either defined or illustrated below the lists. This is done to help make clear the method of showing their _literal_ significance. Further along in each year's work only the most difficult words are explained. Insist that pupils in every case where it is possible define or illustrate so as to show the _literal_ meaning, else much of the value of the study is lost.
And, moreover, the ordinary, or current meaning, _where it differs from the literal_, should be given. Very many of the words have various uses. Thorough work requires that these be illustrated. This necessitates a free use of the dictionary.It is strongly urged that the pupils (with the aid of the teacher when necessary) try to find _an appropriate sentence to illustrate each word_ and write the same in an orderly way in a note book for the purpose.In work of this kind a teacher should not underrate the value of reviews. By this means fix facts on the minds of your pupils, especially the meanings of roots and prefixes. Since these meanings are given in a single word, reviews may proceed rapidly.One convenient method of recitation in this subject is to send pupils to the blackboard without their books, assign them by turns words to be analyzed according to the examples given under “Directions to Pupils”, and then let each pupil read to the class what he has written on the board. Given in the seventh and eighth years' work of the State Course of Study are 45 prefixes, 64 roots, and 33 suffixes,—in all 142 elements or component parts of words. In this book a list of words is furnished to illustrate each element, the average number of words in each list being about eleven, and the total number of different words analyzed, or partially analyzed, is over 1200.2. Combine these meanings in a definition, _supplying additional words if necessary_, to make the sense complete. In exceptional cases, however, the exact literal meanings of the parts cannot be put together in a good definition. One or more of the parts must then be omitted entirely, or represented by words which are not exactly literal.hostile: (1)_host_, enemy + _ile_, belonging to. (2) _Belonging to_ or having the characteristics of an _enemy_. (3) Yon tower which rears its head so high invites the _hostile_ winds.portable: (1) _port_, carry + _able_, capable of. (2) _capable of_ being _carried_ or moved from place to place; not stationary. (3) A _portable_ photograph gallery stopped for three days at the cross-roads near my home.benefactor: (1) _bene_, good + _fact_, make, do + _or_, one who. (2) _One who does good_; especially one who makes a charitable donation.

Hence tantalize means to tease or torment by presenting something desirable to the view and frustrating expectation by keeping it out of reach.Words 9 to 24 may be defined in a simple and satisfactory manner by using some meaning of the suffix _ize_ in the definition with the first part of the word; thus, _agonize_ means to _cause_ to have _agony_.1. _agri cultur_ ist, field + culture 2. _an arch_ ist, without + rule 3. _art_ ist, art 4. _a the_ ist, without + god 5. _botan_ ist, plant 6. _de_ ist, god 7. _dent_ ist, tooth 8. _flor_ ist, flower 9. _ge olog_ ist, earth + science 10. _hypno_ tist, sleep 11. _journ_ alist, day 12. _jur_ ist, right 13. _loy_ alist, law 14. _oc_ ulist, eye 15. _optim_ ist, best 16. _pessim_ ist, worst 17. _re viv_ alist, again + life 18. _roy_ alist, king 19. _sci_ entist, knowledge 20. _somn ambul_ ist, sleep + walk

The cognates are in pairs, as follows: _Vowels_: ā ĕ, ē ĭ, â ă, ä ȧ, a̤ ŏ, û ŭ, ōō o͝o; _consonants_: g´ k, b p, d t, j ch, th th, v f, z s.The NUMBER OF LETTERS in the different alphabets vary, as follows: English 26, Arabic 28, French 25, German 26, Greek 24, Hebrew 22, Italian 21, Russian 33, Spanish 27, Sanskrit 49. The Chinese have no alphabet, but about 20,000 syllabic characters.There is no absolute division between vowels and consonants. Certain vowels are so open as to be only vowels, certain consonants are so close as to be only consonants; but there are yet others which have the value now of vowels and now of consonants; as, _i_, _u_, _w_, and _y_.“_Y_ as a vowel is a substitute for _i_, and _i_ is a consonant as a substitute for _y_. _W_ and _y_ are vowels: (1) When they end words or syllables, (2) when they are not followed by a vowel in the same syllable, (3) when they are followed by a silent vowel in the same syllable. _W_ and _y_ are consonants when they begin words or syllables and are immediately followed by a vowel. _I_ is a consonant when it represents the consonant _y_, as in _alien_. _U_ is a consonant when it represents the consonant _w_, as in _quick_, _language_.”—_Irish's Orthography._
The diphthongs in the following words are all that are in common use, viz.: t_oi_l, t_oy_, s_ou_nd, c_ow_, p_ea_l, _oi_l, _au_dible, _aw_ning, s_ay_, s_ei_ne, p_eo_ple, f_eu_d, ob_ey_, esch_ew_, bel_ie_ve, l_oa_n, h_oe_, h_ue_, j_ui_ce. Of these _oi_, _oy_, _ou_, and _ow_ are the only _proper_ diphthongs.All other consonants are _semivowels_, and are pronounced with a _continuous_ sound. The sound may be continued so long as the breath lasts; but in the case of mutes the sound must stop with the explosive utterance.II. The SUBVOCALS and ASPIRATES are shown in the vertical columns of the table below. The subvocals are sometimes called _voice_ consonants and the aspirates _breath_ consonants. These are fit terms, for they indicate the basis of classification.III. LABIALS, LINGUA-DENTALS, and PALATALS constitute a classification of the consonants with respect to the place of formation. Bead the table from left to right. The _lips_ have most to do with making the labial sounds; the lingua-dentals are formed at the point of the _tongue_ in contact with the _teeth_, the palatals between the tongue and hard and soft _palate_. #Subvocals.# #Aspirates.# (Voice.) (Breath.) Labials. { b p (Lips.) { v f { w wh { mThe ULTIMATE syllable of a word is the last (_ultimus_ = last); the PENULTIMATE is next to the last (_pen_ = almost); the ANTEPENULTIMATE is the third from the last (literally, _before almost_ the _last_); the PREANTEPENULTIMATE is the fourth from the last (literally, _before_ the one that is _before_ the one _almost last_).In long words two, and sometimes three, syllables are accented. But one syllable is always accented more strongly than the others are. The stronger accent is called the PRIMARY accent, the weaker is called the SECONDARY. Thus, in _am´ mu ni´ tion_ the primary accent falls on the third syllable and the secondary on the first.The “PRINCIPLES” which govern the placing of accent are complicated. The International Dictionary says there are no principles by which to determine the accent in English. Another high authority says: “All attempts to assign rules for the place of the accent in English only serve to render the subject hopelessly intricate and confounded.”A word of one syllable is a _monosyllable_ (mono = one); of two syllables, a _dissyllable_ (dis = two); of three syllables, a _trisyllable_ (tri = three); of three or more syllables, a _polysyllable_ (poly = many).Another class of words ending in _ce_ and _ge_ retain the final silent _e_ on adding a suffix beginning with _a_ or _o_ to preserve the soft sound of _c_ and _g_, and with it the correct pronunciation of the word; as, _serviceable_, _noticeable_, _changeable_, _courageous_.In _honour_ and _favour_ _u_ is silent, and therefore a useless letter, so far as sound is concerned. The _u_ signifies that the word came to us through the French, instead of directly from the Latin. The question is, whether we shall go to the trouble of writing the extra letter in a large class of such words for the sake of the historical association. Perhaps one in a thousand would choose to do so, but others of us are more intent on saving time and ink. When the spelling reform idea becomes operative with English speaking people, a great many silent letters will go the way of the _u_ in _labour_, _favour_, and the like.

This is certainly true of a great many such rules (and there are a great many); but three or four of these rules apply to so many words difficult to spell, and they have such a small number of exceptions that they are well worth while. Several hundred words are spelled according to the first rule given below. The rule itself is short, and all of the exceptions could be learned “for keeps” by a pupil in an hour. But _pupils must have drill in applying the rules_ or they may be able to repeat the rules perfectly and glibly and not be able to spell the words coming under them.Since the rule given for the work of the first month, seventh year, and that given for the second month, are counterparts, each of the other, I prefer to take them together. Knowing that “_silent final e is dropped when a suffix beginning with a vowel is added_”, we naturally infer its counterpart, viz.: “_Silent final e is retained when a suffix beginning with a consonant is added._”To bring about the necessary drill and insure attention to the application of the rule, I suggest that a class of pupils, reciting by turns, spell at least twenty-five words according to the following model. [The words are on the board in this form: love + able, care + less.]Words to be spelled according to this model should be mixed,—those in which the suffix to be added begins with a vowel mixed with those in which the suffix begins with a consonant. Exceptions ought to be thrown into the mixture, and when a pupil comes to an exception, he can proceed according to the model, concluding with, “but this word is an exception to the rule”.love—able adventure—ous decide—ing care—less change—ing ice—berg blame—able extreme—ly house—keeper achieve—ment fickle—ness idle—ness brake—man fore—cast excite—ment cure—able compare—able console—able discourage—ment continue—ally endure—ance prove—able contrive—ance amaze—ment move—able guide—ance fierce—ness acquire—ing forgive—ness peace—ful else—where hate—ful deface—ment enlarge—ment believe—ing disgrace—ful admire—able converse—ed blue—ish abide—ing hedge—hog lodge—ing advertise—ment achieve—ing amuse—ment eye—brow hoarse—ness dine—ing pursue—ing argue—ing revenge—fulchangeable challengeable pronounceable exchangeable peaceable advantageous chargeable serviceable outrageous manageable traceable courageous marriageable noticeable vengeanceThe exceptions here given, which are practically all of the exceptions to this rule, should be reviewed until they cannot be forgotten.
