Cora'S Brave Resolve 227 XXVII. The Red Oar Again 235 XXVIII. The Discovery--Conclusion 241 Four girls sat on four chairs, in four different corners of the room. They sat on the chairs because they were really too tired to stand longer, and the reason for the occupancy of the corners of the apartment was self-evident. There was no other available space. For the center of the chamber was littered to overflowing with trunks, suitcases and valises, in various stages of being packed, and from them overflowed a variety of garments and other accessories of a journey."
"""I'm sure I can't get another thing in my suitcase,"" spoke the smallest girl of all, who seemed to shrink back rather timidly into her corner, as though she feared she might be put into a trunk by mistake.""There's an idea!"" cried a plump girl, in the corner nearest the piano. ""A rubber suitcase! What a boon it would be for week-ends, when one starts off with a Spartan resolution to take only one extra gown, and ends up with slipping two party dresses and the 'fixings' into one's trunk. Oh, for a rubber suitcase!""""Now, sisters!"" cautioned Cora, as she gazed at the Robinson twins, ""don't get on one another's nerves. Let's have another try at it. I'm sure if we go at it with some sort of system we'll be able to get all the things in. And really we must hurry!"" she exclaimed, looking at the clock on the mantel, which pointed to the hour of four. ""I promised to have all the baggage ready for the man at five. That only gives us an hour----""Then, as the apparent hopelessness of the situation overcame them again, they looked at one another, at the trunks and suitcases that already held their fair share of articles, at the accumulation on the floor, and then they sighed in concert.""It certainly would create a sensation in Chelton,"" murmured Belle, as she looked at her plump sister. ""But come, we really must help you, Cora. It's too bad we took advantage of your good nature, and brought our things here to pack. We might better have done it at our own homes.""""No, I think you'll find my way best in the end,"" said Cora, with a smile, as she looked about for a place in which to pack her sweater. ""By doing this we won't duplicate on the extras. Now, girls, try once more. Marita, let's begin on your suitcase, for that seems to be the smallest. Oh, dear, Bess, what are you doing now?"" she called, as she noted an unusual activity on the part of the plump girl.""Couldn't close my trunk lid. That's the way I can always tell. Problem: Given a trunk, which requires a force of one hundred and thirty-five pounds to close down the lid, and a girl of one hundred and fifteen, how many chocolates must the said girl eat before she is heavy enough to close the lid? Answer--one pound, and here's for a starter,"" saying which pretty, plump Bess rummaged in a pile of her belongings until she found what she was after. Then, sinking down in a heap of silk petticoats she began munching bonbons with a contented air."
"She was interrupted by the laughter of the others, for Marita was a newcomer in Chelton, and though Cora and her chums had taken her up, attracted by her nice ways, Marita did not yet appreciate her new friends.""Don't mind what Bess says, my dear,"" spoke Cora, as she saw that Marita was a little hurt at the laughter. ""As for the boys, please don't suggest such a thing. If they came in now, we'd never get through packing. I hope----""""Too late!"" exclaimed Cora, as she saw her brother Jack and his chum, Walter Pennington. ""The boys are here! Any more of you, Jack?"" she asked, as she crowded some feminine finery out of sight behind her back.""Now you really must go,"" said Cora, seriously, when Walter had managed to close the trunk. ""Come, Jack, we have to get through by five o'clock,"" and she glanced at her brother, who was in earnest conversation with Marita in her corner.""I just wanted the things compressed, Walter dear,"" said Bess, sweetly. ""I've got a lot more to put in, and I couldn't squeeze in another piece until they had been crowded down a bit. Now run along, little boy.""Cora bit her lip. Really she was provoked at Jack this time. She and her chums were in the midst of packing for their annual Summer trip, and to be interrupted this way, at the last critical moment, was provoking.""The plainer the better,"" observed the newcomer, as he bowed to Marita. ""But what's it all about, Jack?--No, there's no use asking him,"" he murmured as he noted Cora's brother resuming his interrupted conversation with the little girl. ""Will someone please enlighten me?""""It's our annual flitting,"" sighed Cora. ""And really half the pleasure is taken away with this packing. Well, as long as you boys are here you might as well make yourselves useful, as well as ornamental.""""We girls have taken a bungalow at Crystal Bay,"" explained Cora. ""We're due there to-morrow, leaving on the early morning train. The boys, that is, Jack and Walter, are to have a tent near us, and they're supposed to go with us in the morning. But unless they're further along with their packing than we are----""""Well, when you go, please take them with you,"" and Cora indicated her brother and Walter. ""Then we'll be able to go on with our packing. Really, Jack,"" and she spoke most seriously this time, ""you must go!"""
"From the Kimball home driveway the expressman drove with the baggage, and soon the trunks were rattling down the main street of Chelton, that pretty New England town, nestling in a bend of the Chelton River.The boys came over to the Kimball home that evening, Jack having dined with Walter Pennington. Ed came also, to say that he could go, and then the young people talked over plans for Summer fun, until the chiming of the clock warned the girls, at least, that they must separate if they were to get up early the next morning.""And now, after it's all over,"" said Cora to her mother that night, ""I think I would not again have all the packing done in one place. I thought it would save time for the girls to bring their things here, especially as the Robinsons are so upset with building that addition to the parlor. But it was a lot of work!""""Yes. It was Grandfather Lewis's homestead. Well, most of our income has come from that since father's death, and now--Oh, I don't know all the details, but some land speculators--land sharks, mother calls them--are disputing our title.""Mother has just worried herself sick over it, and I'm afraid she is going into nervous prostration. I've been to see some distant relatives about the matter, but I can't do anything. I'm so sorry for dear little mother. If she should break down----""Poor, worried Freda could not go on. Cora held her close and the thought came to her that Freda herself was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The girl had changed very much from the happy, laughing chum of a year before.""I must see you again, Freda,"" said Cora, hastily. ""I'll look for you on the train. I've got to get my party together. Don't forget--I'll see you again!"" and, wondering what was the cause of her friend's worry, Cora hastened up the platform, toward her companions, while the train steamed noisily in.Thus the motor girls, and their boy friends, sent merry quip and jest back and forth as they found seats in the coach, and settled down for the trip to Crystal Bay. Cora, after making sure that the girls had comfortable seats, and noting that Jack had pre-empted the place beside Marita, leaned over Bess and whispered:And while Cora is thus bent on her errand of good cheer, it may not be out of place, for the benefit of my new readers, to tell a little something more about the characters of this story, and how they figured in the preceding books of this series.To begin with the motor girls, there were three of them, though friends and guests added to the number at times. Somehow, in speaking of the motor girls, I always think of Cora Kimball first. Perhaps it is because she was rather of a commanding type. She was a splendid girl, tall and dark. Her mother was a wealthy widow, who for some years had made her home in the quiet New England town of Chelton, where she owned valuable property. And, while I am at it, I might mention that Jack was Cora's only brother, the three forming the Kimball household."
"I think I have already intimated that Bess was plump and rosy--a little too plump, she herself admitted at times. Her sister was just the opposite--tall and willowy, so that the two formed quite a contrast.Each year Cora and her chums sought some new form of Summer vacation pleasure, and this time they had decided on the seashore, in a quiet rather old-fashioned resort, which the girls, on a preliminary inspection trip, had voted most charming. In fact they went into such raptures over it that Jack and his chums had decided to go there also. So the boys and girls would be together.Speaking of the boys, the two who will come in for the most consideration will be Walter Pennington and Ed Foster. Walter was perhaps a closer chum of Jack's than was Ed, the former attending Exmouth College with Jack, where, of late, Ed had taken a post-graduate course. Ed was considered quite a sportsman, and was fond of hunting and fishing.The first book of this series, entitled ""The Motor Girls,"" tells how Cora became possessed of her car, the _Whirlwind_, and what happened after she got it. In that powerful machine she and her girls chums unraveled a mystery of the road in a manner satisfactory to themselves and many others.When the motor girls went on a tour, they made a strange promise--or rather Cora did--and how she kept it you will find fully set forth in the second volume. In the third you may read of the doings of the girls at Lookout Beach, where came two runaways whom Cora befriended. The runaways were two girls--but there, I must not spoil the story for you by telling you their secret.Going through New England in their cars, the motor girls had a strange experience with the gypsies, as set forth in the fourth volume. Cora was in dire straits for a time, but with her usual good luck, and her good sense, she finally turned the situation to the advantage of herself and her chums.Motoring so appealed to the girls that when they got the chance to change from the land to the water they eagerly took it. Cora became the owner of a fine motor boat, and in the story ""The Motor Girls on Cedar Lake,"" you may read of what she and her friends did with their craft. The hermit of Fern Island had much to be thankful for, after meeting Cora, who did him a great service.Longing for wider waters in which to display their skill as amateur motor-boatists, the girls went to the coast the Summer following their experiences on Cedar Lake, and there they found the waif from the sea. Again did Cora and her chums take advantage of an opportunity to befriend an unfortunate.The experiences of that Summer were talked of nearly all of the following Winter. Now warm weather had come again, and with it the desire to be flitting to a watering place. Crystal Bay, as I have said, was selected, and of the start for that place I have already told.""She was considered well-off at school,"" murmured Cora, as she saw her friend half way down the second coach, ""but she never appeared fond of money. Now the loss of it seems to have changed her terribly. I wonder if it can be--just money?""""Then I hope I can do something for you!"" exclaimed Cora, earnestly. ""Come, Freda, dear, tell me your troubles--that is, if you would like to,"" she added quickly, not wishing to force a confidence for which the other might not be ready.""I don't know what the beginning was,"" said Freda slowly, ""but I can almost see the--ending,"" and she seemed to shiver. ""But where are you going, Cora, you and your friends?"" she asked. ""I must not be selfish and talk only about myself."""
"""Perhaps that is partly because I have been traveling all night. It is always so wearying. But my chief cause of anxiety is for mother. She is really on the verge of a breakdown, the doctor says. Oh, if anything happens to her----""""I will,"" said Freda, bravely. ""It is this way. My grandfather was a pioneer land-owner of a large tract at Crystal Bay. It came to us, after papa died, and we lived well on the income from it, for there was much farm land besides the big house we lived in. But a month or so ago a big land company, that wants to get our property for a factory site, filed a claim against us, saying we had no good title to the estate. They said certain deeds had not been filed, and that we were only trespassers, and must get off.""""Not yet, but I am afraid we'll have to. You see these men took the matter to court. They got an injunction, I think it is called. Anyhow, it was some document that forbade the people who rent the land from us from paying us any more money until the case was settled. And, as we depend on the rents for our living--well, you see we haven't any living now, to speak of,"" and Freda tried to smile through her tears.""We have tried, mother and I. But we really have no money to hire lawyers, and neither have any of what few friends and relations there are left. I have just been on a quest of that kind, but it was not successful.""There are supposed to be some documents--deeds, mortgages, or something like that, in existence, and if we could only get hold of them we might prove our claim, and force the men to let us have our rent money again. But until we get those papers----""""I don't mind so much about myself,"" said Freda, bravely, ""but I am really more worried about mother than I am about the property. If worst came to worst I could go to work, but mother has taken so to heart the actions of the land sharks! She never was strong, you know. You met her; did you not?""""I don't just know how, but I am. First I'm going to think this over, and then I'm going to talk about it with Jack. He has a friend--Ed Foster--who knows something about law. We may be able to get ahead of these land sharks yet.""With a reassuring pat on Freda's shoulder Cora left her friend, to go to her chums in the other coach. She found them about to organize a searching party to look for her, and they clamored for the reason for her desertion."
"They had alighted at the station, and there was the confusion that always follows engaging a carriage and seeing that the baggage has safely arrived. Cora found time to slip off for a minute and whisper words of cheer to Freda. Then she rejoined her chums, and made ready for the trip to the bungalow.But finally order came out of chaos. The girls found themselves at their bungalow, surrounded by their belongings. The boys, after seeing that their possessions were piled in the tent, slipped on their oldest garments and began overhauling their fishing tackle.Somehow trunks and suitcases were unpacked; somehow rooms were picked out, rejected, taken again, and finally settled on. Then, between the nibblings at the crackers and pickles Jack had despised, the girls settled down, and at last had time to admire the place they had selected for their Summer stay.A woman had been engaged to open the bungalow for them, and she had provided most of the necessaries of life, aside from those the girls brought with them. Cora and her chums had been satisfied to have her attend to everything from buying food to providing an oil stove on which to cook it.There were a number of conveniences at Crystal Bay. Stores were not out of reach, and supplies could be procured with little trouble. A trip across the bay brought one to the shores of a real village, with school house, post-office and other accessories of civilization. A trip down the bay opened into eel pots in August, bluefishing in September and deep sea fishing later on, when the Summer colonists had departed.Very early in the morning after the arrival of the motor girls at Crystal Bay, house, tent and bungalow were deserted--it was all a matter of motor boat. Moored to the brand new dock, at Tangle Turn, a brand new motor craft heaved with the incoming waves and tugged at its ropes whenever a sufficiently strong motion of the water gave it excuse to attempt an escape.This was the _Chelton_, the ""up-to-datest"" little-big motor boat possible to own or acquire, according to the verdict of the young men from Chelton who had just now passed judgment, and the wise decision of Cora and her girl friends who had actually bought the boat, after having taken a post-graduate course in catalogs and hardware periodicals, to say nothing of the countless interviews they had found it necessary to hold with salesmen and yacht agents.""And land on a desert island? What sport!"" exclaimed Lottie, to whom motor boating was an entirely new experience. ""I hope we make it Holland. I have always longed to see a real, live Holland boy. The kind who are all clothes and wooden shoes.""""We might make one up for you,"" suggested Belle. ""I think Wallie would look too cute for anything in skirty trousers and polonaise shirts. Just let his locks grow a little--Look out there, Bess! That's water around the boat. It only looks like an oil painting. It's real--wet!""Bess was climbing over the dock edge, and of course the boys could not allow her that much exercise without pretending that she was in danger of going overboard. After Belle unhooked the hem of her sister's skirt from an iron bolt, thereby giving Bess a sudden drop to the deck of the _Chelton_, however, Bess declared she knew water when she saw it, and also the difference between a water color and an oil painting."
"""These are the very latest, most improved and most expensive electric attachments on the market,"" answered Cora, with a show of dignity, ""and when you boys take a meal here, if we ever invite you to, I think we can easily prove the advantage of electrical attachments over campfire iron pots.""""It means something else,"" Captain Cora remarked, ""namely, if we have company for supper, and the storage current gives out, we will not have to make it a progressive meal, extending into the next day. The course can be continued from the extra current.""""Likely,"" said Belle, for the girls had all taken an interest in the housework-made-easy-plan, and had arranged to use the boiling water as it came from the motor after cooling the cylinder. ""But it won't hurt dishes.""""And I made friends with a pretty, little, soft ground mole, Jack,"" put in Ed, ""and if the rest of our boxes do not arrive and unpack themselves in time for your slumber this eve, that mole has agreed to cuddle up under your left ear. I believe you sleep on your left.""""Now what are you two up to?"" demanded Jack. ""Just because Drayton Ward has not arrived, we are held up for his coming. I tell you, Sis, that chap may not put in an appearance at all, here. He knows--sweller places.""""Oh, don't you mind him, Cora,"" Ed interrupted. ""Dray is sure to come. He had his canoe shipped two days ago, besides sending to the cove for his motor boat. I expect some tall times when he gets here. Our own innocent little _Lassie_ won't know how to skip over the waves at all--she'll be that flustered when the swell, gold-railed, mahogany-bound, carpet-floored _Dixie_ gets here.""""We did, plainly and emphatically. But a boat builder, letter or seller has a right to make his own day in delivering the goods. We'll be lucky if we get the barge at all without taking the sheriff up to that shipyard.""""And we must get back to the bungalow,"" she observed. ""Freda and I have an important appointment for eleven, and if you all promise not to follow us or attempt to go out in the _Chelton_, perhaps we will have some interesting news for you this evening.""The boys strolled away, talking about the motor boat they had hired. Money, for some reason, was not plentiful that Summer with Jack and his chums, and they had to be content with a second-hand craft, that had been patched and re-patched until there was little of the original left. They were not even sure the _Lassie_ would run, but they were anxious to try her.""Oh, yes,"" returned Freda, with a suspicion of a sigh. ""Over there, just in that splendid green stretch is, or was, grandfather's place. It runs all along to the island, and on the other side there is a stream that has been used for a mill race.""""What a shame!"" cried Cora. ""And all because there is some technical proof of ownership missing. I should think that when your family had undisputed possession for years it ought to be sufficient to establish your rights."""
"""Yes, we never dreamed we could lose it,"" Freda explained. ""Mother and I have lived there in the Winter since father died, and we have rented it in Summer, as I said. Of course the Summer is the desirable time here. And we had some of the loveliest old furniture. But when we had to break up we sold most of it.""""Look out! There's a hole there,"" Cora warned just in time, for in the heavy sand little rivulets were creeping from some rollers tossed in by a passing boat. The bay was dotted with many craft, and the picture it presented gave Cora keen delight, for it forecasted a merry Summer for the motor girls.""We only have a little farther to go,"" Freda said. ""I hope old Denny has kept his word and stayed in. He is the queerest old fellow--you will be amused at him, I am sure. But he was always such a staunch friend of grandfather.""""More than fine, it would be glorious!"" Freda replied. ""If we lose it all now, I will have to look for work. Not that I mind that,"" she added, ""but I intend to take a course in nursing. I have always longed to be a nurse.""Cora now had a chance to see this quaint old fellow. He was Irish, with many fine humorous wrinkles about his eyes and mouth. He seemed to breathe through his pipe, so constantly did he inhale it, and just how he kept his sailor's blouse so clean, and his worn clothes so neat, was a trick he had learned in his younger days in the navy.""Chelton? Chelton? Sure, I do. I went through there once in a parade wagon. We were out with the G. A. R. and I guess the parade got lost, for I remember at Chelton we had to put up for the night in an old church they were using for a fire house. But we had a fine time,"" and he chuckled at the recollection. ""And next day we finished up without the need of a wagon. It was like camp days to scatter ourselves about the big ramshackle place.""Up the little board walk to a path through the woods the three tramped. Denny Shane was popular with young folks; even the mischievous boys who would occasionally untie his boat before a storm had no reason to fear his wrath, for such pranks were quickly forgotten."
"A surprising little place, indeed, the girls were shown into. Neat and orderly, yet convenient and practical, was Denny Shane's home. There was a stove and a mantel, a table, two chairs and a long bench. Pieces of rag carpet indicated the most favored spots--those to be lived on.""No--indeed!"" he said almost solemnly. ""That oar will stay with me while Denny Shane has eyes to see it. It has a story, Freddie, and I often promised to tell it to you. This is as good a time as another.""He put his pipe down, brought a big chair up to the window, opened a back door to allow the salt air to sweep in; then, while Cora looked with quickening interest at the old red oar, that hung over the fireplace, Denny shook his head reflectively and started with his story.""That oar,"" he said, ""seems like a link between me and Leonard Lewis--your grandpa, Freddie. And, too, it is a reminder of the night when I nearly went over the other sea, and would have, but for Leonard Lewis and his strong red oar.""A light flashed into the old eyes. Plainly the recollections brought up by his story were sacred. He left his chair and went over to the mantel, climbed up on a box and touched the oar that had sagged a little from its position.""It was a raw January night--in fact, it seemed as if it had been night all day for all the chance the sun had to get out. A howling wind whistled and fairly shrieked at everything that didn't fly fast enough to suit it. Len and me had been puttin' in a lot of time together at his house, just chinnin'--there wasn't much else to do but to keep warm. Well, along about five o'clock, we heard a rocket! The wind died away for a minute or so, and we dashed out to the beach to get the lay of that distress signal. Talk about big city fires!"" he digressed. ""A fire on land ain't what it is on sea. It always seems like as if death has a double power with the fire and the deep and nothing but the sky above to fan the flame.""We soon saw the smoke. It was from a point just over the turn, where the clouds dip down and touch the waves. A little tail of smoke crawled up and hung black and dirty, not gettin' any bigger nor spreadin' much. When we sighted her, we went to work in the way men of the sea have of working together and never sayin' a word. Up the beach we chased, and dragged out the boat we called our 'Lifer.' It was a good, strong fishin' boat, and we kept her ready in the rough weather."
"""Mother always said grandfather was queer about such things,"" Freda remarked. ""I remember we had an old jug that he found on one of his birthdays. He would never allow that jug to be thrown out; he said it meant a jug full of good luck.""""But I'm gettin' away from my yarn,"" he said, presently. ""We took the big thick oars and pulled out against the wind. By this time the hail was comin' down in chunks that would cut the face off you. Sometimes there are a lot of stragglers around here, but when we need a man, of course, there is not one in sight. But we rowed away and somehow managed to get close to the wreck. It was a little steamer, not much bigger than a tug, and it was burning faster than the smoke told us.""'You throw the rope and I'll stick to the oars!' shouted Len, his voice sounding like a wheeze in the wind. There were three men on the steamer and they were just about tuckered out. They were clingin' to the rail, their hands blisterin' from the flames that were sweepin' up close to them even as they touched the water's edge.""It's an awful thing to see sufferin' like that,"" he put in. ""I won't ever forget how those fellows tumbled into our boat. They just rolled in like dead men. But my rope got caught in the rudder of the steamer, and I tugged and tugged, but it looked as if we would have to let her burn off before we could free ourselves. Just when I decided to make a big haul at it I came near my end. I stood up, gave the rope a yank, and with that--rip! She let go! And I went with it over into the water!""""It was bad, Miss,"" agreed the narrator. ""And the feel of that water as I struck it! It was like a bath of sword-points. Well, that's where the oar comes in! Bless the bit of wood it was cut from, it sure was a good, strong stick.""When I flopped into the water, like a fish dumped out of a net, your grandpop, Freddie, took nary a chance at reachin' me with the rope. He dropped the regular oars and took one of the pair he called lucky.""With the effort to keep up me blood heated some, and the next time I saw the flash of red I grabbed it good an' proper. It took three of them to haul me up, but I clung to the red oar and that's how I'm here this minute. Likewise, it's why the oar is here with me."""
"""Looked like it,"" agreed Denny. ""And after we got back Len couldn't pay any attention to the half-frozen men, or to me, that had been pretty well chilled--all he could do was talk about the luck of that oar.""""Right,"" said Denny, ""for while we had another pair to work with, they were slim, and weak, but that fellow, it sure was tough then; but lately when I take it down it seems to have shrunk, for it's gettin' lighter, somehow.""""But the queer part of it was that your grandfather seemed to think I would outlive his son, and John such a strappin'-lookin' fellow,"" resumed Denny. ""Len called me to him, and him sick and miserable, and he says: 'Denny, John's not as strong as he looks, and I want you to do all you can to help Louisa,' (your mother of course, Freddie), 'for she has the child to raise,' he said. Well, he wouldn't let me interrupt him when I tried to speak of John. He would have it that I should keep an eye to things. Your grandfather Lewis left me no papers, however--I supposed John had them--but he left me the old red oar. He had fairly been playin' with it for years, always polishin' it or shapin' it off here or there. I often look at the marks of his knife on it, and wonder why he seemed fond of it.""""I am sure,"" said Freda, earnestly, ""you have kept your promise, Uncle Denny. Mother often speaks of how good you were when I was small. Father never had any papers about grandfather's land; all he had related to family keepsakes. The strange part of it all is to me that a man of grandfather's intelligence should be so remiss about his property claims.""""But, Freddie, you don't understand. There seemed no need for deeds and mortgage papers then about here. Everybody knew everyone else, and things seemed to be solid forever. But now them plagued land fellows--well, they've got a good cheek, is all I can say."" And he emptied an unsmoked pipe of tobacco in his indignation.""But we are going to get after them,"" Cora declared. ""We want to go slowly, and, if possible, find out what their intentions are. Find what sort of company they claim to have, in the first place, and if they are an honorable set of men they ought to make open claims, instead of sneaking around, and trying to find out things that might cause a flaw in the title. I am suspicious, for one,"" she finished significantly.""Oh, it was the greatest fun,"" Freda replied. ""They could not imagine how we ever thought of using the cylinder water for a dishwater supply. I never gave it away that you suggested it to Cora's mechanic.""""Oh, the early Summer mornings are beautiful,"" replied Freda, ""and I am sorry I had to lose so many of them. Who's that? The girls, looking for us! There's Bess puffing, and Belle--fluffing. I do think they are the most attractive pair."""
"""Indeed they shall not take the _Chelton_ out without my permission,"" Cora declared. ""When we make our initial trip I intend to command it. For one thing, Uncle Denny is to come along; for another--well, that's to be a little surprise. This afternoon at two exactly--will you come, Uncle Denny?""""Oh, we are just crazy to get out on the water,"" Bess put in, ""and what do you think? That vain little Lottie went all the way to town to get the exact nautical cap. I wonder if she thinks folks in motor boats run slowly enough to see little white caps on little light girls?""""Now, Bessie, that would be telling,"" replied Cora, stopping just long enough to empty the sand from her tennis shoe. Denny was trudging along after them--he could not resist an excuse to go down to the shore.""What are you girls up to?"" demanded Belle. ""You have been acting mysteriously ever since you met on the train. Freda, it is really unpardonable not to take the initial trip with us, but if you really cannot----""""Now, I'll show you a short cut,"" said Denny. ""Take that path there--don't be afraid of the sign that the owner put up--he has no right to the beach front; then when you get to the Lonely Willow--do you know where that is?""""You can't miss the Lonely Willow, for it stands all alone and looks as forlorn as the mast of a sunken steamer,"" said Denny. ""It's in the deep hollow by the watercress patch. Turn around that tree to your left and you'll see another path. But wait a minute,"" he broke off, ""maybe it's a bit lonely.""""We did make a stay,"" agreed Cora, ""but Denny is a very old friend of Freda's family, and, to tell you the truth, we could hardly break away when he started in to tell sea-yarns. Ouch! The mud is deep. I guess we must be near the Lonely Willow.""All eyes were turned to the big tree. Two men were seated on a branch that made a comfortable seat. As the girls approached one of the men wrapped some papers up and thrust them into his pocket. But the movement was not lost on the girls.Lottie and Jack strolled through the moss-padded path that led to the white sands of Tangle Turn, talking in this vein as they went. It was indeed a merry crowd, and well worth noticing, as was evinced by the number of curious spectators already assembled on the dock to which the _Chelton_ was tied.""Now, Lottie, I can see his bald head under his cap at this distance without marine glasses, and it's a rule of the club that 'dears' have special advantages in the matter of healthy heads of hair. But, of course, if you wish to call him 'dear'----"""
"Bess, Belle and Cora had already reached the motor boat. Denny was proudly ""looking her over,"" pipe in mouth and hands in pockets. The girls were bustling about, all enthusiasm, while the boys, assuming an air of importance, found many points to investigate.Ed was on the dock with the rope loose from the cleat. Cora was at the steering wheel, while Denny insisted on turning the fly wheel, as that seemed about the most difficult thing to do. The gasoline was turned on, Jack attending to that, and as Denny gave the fly wheel a vigorous turn, Ed pushed off and jumped into the boat. The ""push"" sent the _Chelton_ out in the water, but the motor failed to do its duty. Again Denny tried, but still no response. As this is not unusual with any motor, whether new or old, all hands waited patiently.""The rope!"" called Cora, who had dashed from her position at the steering wheel to the side of the boat where the mooring rope had been dropped. In the excitement, of course, all crowded to one side of the small craft, which caused it to careen alarmingly.By this time the _Dixie_, the innocent cause of the accident, was alongside. Drayton Ward, the wealthy young fellow who could boast of a motor boat that would have aroused comment even at Newport, leaned over the side and grasped the arm of the girl in the water. The rest was a simple matter, for soon Lottie was assisted over the rail of the _Dixie_, and was in the finest boat on Crystal Bay.All this time the drenched girl was being most carefully looked after by the gallant captain of the _Dixie_. He was seeing to it that she did not suffer from a chill, for a big coat had been wrapped around her and her pretty white cap that had merrily floated off was now replaced by one marked ""Dixie."" Altogether, for a mere Summer dip, Lottie was having a magnificent time, as Ed took pains to observe.""Let's shift,"" suggested Drayton, with a gracious smile at Cora. ""Mine is probably the faster boat. You get in here with us, Miss Cora, and we will run up and down the bay while your friends are working off the oil smoke. That's a neat little boat you have, a perfect little model,"" he finished, coming as close as possible to the _Chelton_.Without a word all hands, keen for a race as soon as one was suggested, took seats, and the two boats veered out into the bay and ""lined up"" for the start. Denny was the proudest engineer imaginable, and constantly looked over the fine mechanism.""Ready!"" shouted Ed, and at the word both throttles were thrown wide open and the boats shot up the bay, emitting clouds of smoke from their newly oiled works, and ""chugging"" so rapidly that the sounds were drowned in a roar. It was a pretty sight, for in the girls' boat a line of colored sweaters and waving caps lent life to the gray of the waters, while Drayton, in his glistening, highly-polished _Dixie_, only needed the glint that the sun lent to complete the picture afforded by his fine craft.""He's keeping his eye on those girls on the beach,"" laughed Walter. ""Those are the lassies who have the white canoe."" So saying he waved his own cap and a flutter of handkerchiefs from the beach came back in recognition."
"Here a white flag fluttered, the stake left from some recent sailing races. Gracefully the _Chelton_ rounded the stake first. Drayton had lost time in running too close to shore. Only a minute later the _Dixie_ swayed after the _Chelton_, then the final stretch was taken up in earnest. Spectators on the bank might wave now, but the motorists had no eyes for them. A slight miss in the _Chelton's_ explosion brought Denny and Ed to their feet--there should be no break in the rhythm of that chug.Denny shook his head lest a word might interfere with the boat's motion. Dray stood up and did something that caused the bow of his boat to shoot up, while the stern seemed to bury itself in the waves.This was a signal for all three girls to slip down to the floor of the boat and while they lost the good view afforded from the seats, they evidently enjoyed the change, and craned their necks to see over the sides.The girls gathered around Cora and Lottie at this remark. But Cora, by some mysterious signal system, had warned Lottie not to say anything, and she soon joined the boys, who had already boarded the _Dixie_ to overhaul her.""It's all right,"" commented Denny, ""and a good lesson. I never knew myself that too much speed would do the like of that. Well, I must be off doin' some chores. I've been a-galavantin' most of the day, and the fishes of Crystal Bay are not educated to come up to me door yet. Thank you for the sport. It was fine,"" he concluded, genially.""But not the same strange men every time,"" Lottie put in. This gave a clue to her fright. The men who had secluded themselves under the Lonely Willow that morning had appeared again, this time in the vicinity of the girls' bungalow, now known as the ""Motely Mote.""""But our housekeeper has given notice,"" announced Cora. ""And I don't wonder. Not one has been on time for a single meal since we arrived. But I must say, I wish she had stayed until the stuff was all unpacked. It's dreadful on the hands,"" and she looked at hers ruefully.""Why not ask the boys to help?"" asked Lottie, who was doing her best to press her damp clothes by stretching the most important of them over Belle's trunk, and holding them there with two suitcases. ""If I had not gotten these things wet I should have been glad to unpack, but if I leave them this way over night I shall never be able to wear them again.""""Something like that, Bess, if they did unpack at all. But, seriously, if you will give me a little help to drag these empty trunks to the porch, I will tell you of a plan I have evolved. Of course we cannot remain this way without a chaperone."""
"""Oh, I don't know about that,"" objected Cora. ""I have noticed that in case of emergency, when some strange man happens to poke his nose in at the window, we are all rather glad to acknowledge we are mere babes.""""Now, Lottie,"" said Cora, ""you have an idea that everyone who looks at us 'peers' at us. For my part I was rather flattered by their attention. You see the fame of the motor girls is spreading. But let me now make my proposition,"" and she settled down on the rug that was intended to cover the floor--some time.""Well, you know our little friend, Freda, has lost some property; that is, her mother and herself have lost a certain claim to it. This little colony around here is fairly bristling with the prosperity implanted in it by such thrifty men as was Freda's grandfather, but in spite of that, strangers come in, make a big fuss about riparian rights, and government laws, and property claims and, in so doing, pretend to discover a flaw in a title that for years has been considered perfectly clear."" She paused, for Bess had opened her mouth twice, and this time Cora wanted to hear what she had to say.""You see, Marita dear,"" Cora explained, ""because we seem such harmless babies we are able to get information that others, considered more dangerous, might not have access to. Now, let me continue. There are men around here, members of some sort of a land company, who are trying to get hold of certain papers. We don't know whether they exist or not, but in our own quiet, girlish way----""Here she was interrupted with a burst of mocking laughter. ""Your quiet girlish way,"" repeated Belle. ""Why, Cora, I do believe if you thought you could get the better of that land company you would take the _Chelton_, and go--pirating! Wouldn't it be great to go out on a dark night, steam up the bay, watch for other boats, listen to the smugglers----""""Oh, Belle,"" put in Lottie, ""that's not the way in books. We would have to go out and get kidnapped, and then, when in the cave, we would hear the plot of the men who were going to steal the old homestead.""""Well, you could scarcely call it that,"" replied Jack, espying an undamaged orange on the window sill, and making a lunge for it. ""We did intend to eat the stuff, but it was just plain grub--not eatables.""""We are on a diet,"" explained Jack. ""Wallie had the crackers, Ed nabbed the dried beef--he's the biggest and needs the most, you know--and I got the pickles. Then we followed directions, and each drank three sips of pure spring water. But the trouble arose when Dray came in. He said he was to have milk--doctor's orders. We didn't have any but 'pretense' milk, so Dray is now out looking for a cow.""""Feed us? No, we can eat with spoons. Just lead us to the eats. Really, it is serious with Dray. He has already gone dead white. Come in, fellows. We are expecting you. The girls are just getting out the best linen!"""
"""Good evening, ladies,"" panted Dray. ""We are delighted to accept your kind invitation to dine with you. Pray pardon the togs. I feel like a regular 'toff,' don't you know, but my studs are for the moment lost. And what is a frock without the studs!""Finally believing that the boys were hungry, the girls proceeded to empty the ice box on the back porch. They did not find any too much food there, for the sudden departure of their housekeeper that afternoon had left the girls themselves almost stranded. But, being girls, they managed the living end a little better than the boys did.The boys, it seemed, had laid in a stock of canned stuff, in the usual hit-and-miss way, but some other campers found the ""cave"" where the food had been hidden. It was out of the question either to take or get ice, so the next best thing considered was the digging of a big hole in a very damp place. Into this the boys had sunk a nice, clean, galvanized tub, and in it the victuals had been placed. On top was a cover, made of boards and oil cloth, and over this was placed the limb from a tree, this last to detract attention.""Now, wouldn't you think,"" said Jack, as he fortified himself with a sandwich, ""that any decent chap would know that we belonged to the union? We are going to form a housewives' league at dawn to-morrow, and then we will find the culprits. They will be offering us our own grub at exorbitant rates.""""Bright little Jackie,"" commented Bess, who was devouring cheese and macaroons. ""When you find the culprits you will have a perfectly good movie act in your camp. It will be entitled 'The Fate of the Kid Grubber.'""""Of course they will, and that right now,"" declared Cora. ""We have no time to spare to get someone else to stay with us, however. Bess, do you want to come with me? I am going out for our new companion.""""Oh, don't be silly, Bess,"" and Cora laughed lightly. ""Everything is perfectly safe and sane at the bay, but what I want is to get over to the little cottage where Freda and her mother are living before they retire. It is Mrs. Lewis I hope to get as our housekeeper.""""Yes, I have been talking to her and I think she is just that--fine and wholesome. And goodness knows,"" added Cora fervently, ""we need some weight at the Mote. But they may not consent. I happened to overhear a remark this afternoon that set me to thinking. I am afraid poor Freda and her mother are in for further trouble."""
"They hurried along, making their way with difficulty in the deep sand that covered road and path alike. Once or twice they paused, startled at the sound of men's voices, then hurried the more to make up for lost time.The living room of the cottage was typical of the seashore--a long apartment, with field-stone fireplace and fumed fir trim. The stairway led up from the room and gave it an air of even greater spaciousness. Altogether it was most attractive. Mrs. Lewis, a slim, fine-featured woman, rose from her rocker as the girls entered.""It is late to call,"" began Cora, ""but our business is really urgent. We have been left all alone suddenly--our housekeeper says she received a hurried call to go back to her family in the city. I don't question the call, I know how often and faithfully they follow maids who find a country place lonely; but the fact is we girls do not fancy staying alone to-night.""It was plain, now that the girls had become accustomed to the lights, that Freda and her mother had both been crying. Their eyes were red and their cheeks swollen. Freda saw that the girls observed this.""I must hurry with my errand,"" said Cora. ""I came to see if it would be possible for you and Freda to lock up and come over with us to-night. I am afraid those land sharks have our little place marked, too, for they have been loitering around all day. I don't want to tell the boys. They are hasty and so apt to resent any intrusion that would worry us.""""I suppose because they know that Freda is a friend of ours,"" replied Cora. ""But don't worry about them bothering us, all we want is to be able to meet them fairly. Of course if they knew we were alone at night they might be mean enough to frighten us, and some of the girls are rather timid.""""Oh, that is splendid!"" Cora cried. Freda immediately went about fastening the windows and seeing to the general locking up, while Mrs. Lewis hurried up stairs to pack a small bag. It seemed as though they were ready almost instantly, much to the relief of Bess, who kept wondering if the boys would remain at the bungalow with the girls until her own and Cora's return.Ed tucked an end of white mosquito netting in his belt, draped it jauntily, and appeared ready to do the ""waiting."" Walter was frying bacon and eggs on the oil stove. Jack threw dishes at the oilcloth-covered table in imitation of a game of quoits, and he rarely missed the mark. They were about to have breakfast, and in spite of the difficulties encountered in the way of modern improvements omitted in the arrangement of Camp Couldn't (the camp got that name for a million reasons), the boys were having a fine time.""That coffee will be cold,"" protested Dray, ""and my doctor says cold coffee is slow poison. I prefer my poison quick."" The joke about Dray's doctor was that Dray never knew a doctor other than the medical inspector at school. He had such astonishingly good health that they used the idea of sickness in reference to him as a ""counter irritant."""
"""If the Cattle crowd have a good stove they won't sell it,"" replied Jack. ""You will likely find a second-hand flue in it, or a rubber hose leader. Those boys are brilliant. If we need a new stove let it be from Duke's, with a cast-iron guarantee.""""Right-o,"" seconded Dray. ""The cast-iron is always useful about a camp. But I say, what about the racket at the Mote last night? That sister of yours, Jack, is wasting her talents. She ought to be chief of a detective bureau.""""Cora is all right,"" Jack returned, proudly. ""And while we are on the subject, and not to brag, of course, I might say that some of the other girls are in the same class. First few years they came out to the woods I used to be rather doubtful, but now we often find that the maids can take care of the masters; don't we, Wallie? More of that odor, please. I wonder why bacon turns all to odor when it's cooked up!""A huge, very hard bun, the sort found only in bakeries near Summer resorts, hit Jack squarely in the face. Without any comment he caught it, cut it in half, and with a tin spoon plastered it with butter. Then he put ""the lid on it,"" and tried to get it between his teeth. It was heroic exercise, but Jack had been trained at a reputable college, and had learned to eat what he wanted.""But those duffers, the land men,"" continued Dray, ""what are they after the girls for? I had an idea one of them must be trying to claim relationship with the fair Freda. He kept so close to her when she was out after Denny.""""The one who wears the Panama? I wonder if anyone would think of haste in connection with that duffer. It took him just one hour to buy three soft crabs from some kids at the dock yesterday,"" said Walter. ""I wouldn't like to be his messmate. But I don't like his eye; it's made on the bias.""""And you had a 'Doins' last night,"" Dray reminded him. ""Now, Tom, we want to be fair, but we have arranged to form a housewives' league for the purpose of swiping systematically. For instance,"" (here he got a burnt match and tried to trace something on the oilcloth), ""if we have company, and no olives, we could go over to your cupboard, take a bottle and deposit in its stead, say, a can of beans.""""Great!"" shouted Tom, tossing up his cap, that landed on the flaming oil stove. ""You should not waste oil,"" he said, as he rescued the cap. ""It's always wise to turn out the stove when you take off the pan."""
"""Now, quit your fooling,"" returned Walter. ""I have an engagement and I would like to get my housework done. Tom, help yourself to a towel, and be careful not to wipe the plates on a glass towel. You can tell the difference by the border. The dish towel is all border, the center or hole went up on the oil stove, a little trick our stove has--it does not like towels. The proper towel for the glasses is that one with the black line drawn through the middle. The black line is not important, it was put there with a single wipe of the spark plug from the _Lassie_. Ed did it, very neatly.""Tom took the towel tossed to him, and, as only a boy can, began to dry the dishes that Walter was piling in front of him. First he patted and rubbed the towel on one side of the dish that lay before him; then he turned the same dish over with a bang and repeated the patting and rubbing on the other side. After that he gave the plate a spin. If it landed right side up he left it so; if the trade-mark showed he counted it a ""foul,"" and tried the trick again. How boys can get work done that way is always a mystery to girls, who find the same play labor.""Oh, we would just love to have you,"" replied Jack, with mock seriousness, ""but the fact is, we are all invited out. We lunch on the _Chelton_ to-day,"" and he strutted around with such wide sweeping curves, and twists, that he knocked from the narrow board table every last bit of butter the ""Couldn'ts"" had in their camp. Gingerly he scooped up the top lump, that lay on the store dish, but the scraps had to be scraped up with the egg turner, and the spot on the floor (they had a board floor in the camp) had to be washed up with the dish water, when Walter finally relinquished that important commodity.The ""bell,"" a very old and very large tray, was found outside under the bench, and with a good strong stick Dray beat it furiously, until it might easily be heard by every camper on the grounds. At the first signal boys came scampering from all directions. Some carried towels--too much excited to drop them in their camps; others dashed through the woods with sweaters on their arms, and reluctant neckties in their fists, for it was early and the campers had scarcely time to make ""careful"" toilets.""Grub nothing!"" replied Walter. ""You just get outside on that bench, the overflow can take the reserved seats on the nice green moss. This meeting has been called for the purpose of organizing the Housewives' League of Crystal Bay.""""The purpose of this meeting,"" went on Jack, ducking a lump of moss tossed in lieu of a bouquet, ""is to formulate plans, whereby the humans of Prowlers' Paradise may continue to defy the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and live in a perfectly human way.""""Let me explain,"" interrupted Dray, pushing Jack from his place, and taking the stand pompously. ""We have been the victims of prowlers. We have lost our soup; we also lost our cans of milk--in fact, the cruel ones took everything but our appetites, and now we propose to put a stop to such depredations. We will form a league to borrow and to lend, also to pay back, but he who taketh his brother's soup and returneth not a can of beans shall be expelled from the Prowlers' Paradise!""A commotion then started that broke up the meeting. The boys, in rolling and tumbling about, rolled Dainty, so-called because he never could get enough to eat, and because his quest showed in unweighable pounds of fat, deliberately down the small hill at the side of Camp Couldn't. Two of the Cattle did the rolling, and as Dainty made one full turn a can of milk squirmed out of his pocket."
"When the last visitor had been ""shooed"" away and the Couldn'ts had carefully prepared for the lunch to be taken on the _Chelton_ (although Ed claimed that Walter had appropriated his most becoming tie, and that the shade of tan rather marred Wallie's own ""tannery"" effect), the boys finally put the camp flap down good and tight, and were off to the bay. Far out in the pretty bay the _Chelton_ was anchored. It was arranged that the luncheon should be given too far from land to get anything in supplies that might have been forgotten. In fact, it was to be a test meal, such as might be a necessity in case of ""shipwreck"" or accident.Dray ran his boat, the _Dixie_, alongside, and together the fleet of two comprised what the boys termed a ""White House Lunch."" The cooking was all done on the _Chelton_ and the eatables were handed over the brass rail to Lottie and Marita, who served as waitresses on the _Dixie_. First there were lettuce sandwiches, rolled. Any girl who can successfully roll bread and lettuce is termed proficient by the cooking teachers, and it was a tie between Belle and Cora as to who did the most and best of the rolling.Next came baked potatoes. These had been done on the electric toaster, right aboard the _Chelton_, and while scarcely a correct following for salad, the first was given as an appetizer, and the potatoes as food.Dried beef went with the potatoes, also dill pickles, and while Cora kept the electric toaster going, and saw to it that the ""kitchen"" did not run out of hot water from a reserve tank, the other girls took turns eating their own lunches. Of course, as the boys were guests, it was important their wants should be first supplied, a matter not easily managed, as the girls soon found out.""Nix, nary, not much!"" cried Ed, in protest. ""That's 'Dainty' there, the stroke, and if he gets in here he'll eat the dish pan and the cooker. I say, young ladies should be most careful what sort of fellows they associate with.""The canoe bobbed up and down, until Cora took an extra rope from the _Chelton_ and threw it to Dainty, who in turn tied it to a small hook in the green _Snake_. This served to keep the canoe from capsizing as Dainty and Kent crept into the _Chelton_.Just what saved all three boats from being turned upside down in the racket that followed only Neptune knows, for in their delight at seeing real food the boys from the ""Likes"" grew so impetuous that the ""Couldn'ts"" felt called upon to interfere.Lottie declared she never had such a splendid time in her life, and the brightness of her cheeks catching the flame from her eyes bore out this statement. Marita, too, seemed to have ""shook her cocoon,"" Jack said, his economy of language scarcely making up for the little difference in ""shook"" and ""shaken."" Certainly she managed to climb from one boat to another with remarkable alertness, while Bess, Belle and Cora acted like up-to-date society maidens, only they acted a little in advance of the ""date"" usually adhered to.""You boys just tie your canoe tight to us,"" Cora said, as the two visitors were about to climb into their frail skiff. ""You would be washed out during the storm that's coming. Here, Bess, hold this,"" handing Bess one end of the awning tie. ""Belle, can you keep that rope taut?""It was astonishing how quickly the scene of enjoyment turned to one of alarm. Those of the girls who were active and eager to assist in making things safe, did not suffer so much from fright as did they who took time to watch the clouds. The first severe storm of Summer usually has a more terrifying effect upon the timid ones than those that may follow, and this one certainly was a ""star"" for a starter.The lightning soon began to flash intermittently and the thunder to rumble. The clear expanse of horizon afforded such a wide view of the storm that it was small wonder those out in the bay feared for their safety."
"All over the bay sail boats, canoes, motor boats, row boats and every sort of craft were making for shore, but in most of these there were little or no goods that might be damaged by rain or waves, while both the _Dixie_ and the _Chelton_ would have suffered severely had they encountered a down-pour uncovered.Jack clung to the steering wheel, and Cora never took her eyes off the engine. But how they whirled and twirled! There was the _Dixie!_ It was keeping near--one good thing. The canoe had broken loose and was soon lost to sight. No one bewailed it; there was too serious work at hand for that.The other girls had been roused to activity by Lottie's condition. They could now see a rift in the clouds, and one after another hurried to say that the storm was breaking, and it was not so bad; that boats could be seen, and perhaps they would soon sight land.But those at the wheels of the boats knew how little they could do in the way of steering. Every time the wheel was turned one way the force of the rollers would wash it completely around. In fact they were making absolutely no progress, and might almost as well have allowed the powerless craft to submit to the fury of the waters.Cora realized this, as did the boys, but the other girls, except perhaps Bess, felt more secure as the sound of the motor indicated motion. The clouds were lifting, but the force of the storm seemed to be coming in from sea, and had little to do with the appearance of the sky.Not one word could Cora exchange with Jack, he was too far from her to hear her voice. The _Dixie_ was still near enough to be sighted, but how the boys managed to keep her so was as remarkable to themselves as to those on the _Chelton_.The roar of the storm increased. Just as Cora had predicted, the new squall was worse than the first. For some moments all three boats tossed and tumbled as if they had neither master nor man, but it was the _Chelton_ that righted herself first.Like a sprite, the girl in the yellow slicker and rubber hat made for the highest end of the boat, measured her distance to the _Chelton_, and while Kent and Cora strained to hold the rope steady, sprang.The boats had drifted apart again. The girls clung to Freda as if she had really brought them safely to shore, instead of adding her own weight to their burden, but it was the message from land that reassured them.""No!"" replied Freda, cheerfully. ""It isn't so bad out there. But we knew what it was on this bar, and could tell by the wind just about where you were drifting. If Jack will let me take the wheel I will follow Denny's orders and ride into it. Then we can go around the island--and see a blue sky!""""Oh!"" gasped Cora. Freda dropped into the ""V"" space at the base of the wheel. Still, she did not take her hands from the spokes. It was a serious moment. What if the boat could not ride those waves? The time it took to get out of the harder waves could not be estimated by the hands of a clock or watch; but in gasping breaths, thumping hearts, pale faces and fears--for boys as well as for girls--it must have been a long, long time."
"""And--it--took a girl--to--do it!"" exclaimed Jack, who would not have been blamed for hugging Freda had the opportunity offered. Instead, however, he made his way back to the wheel and allowed Freda and Cora a chance to look at their blistered hands, for both girls had been tugging at the spokes.But the wind had ceased, and the waves soon quieted. With more than a sigh of relief the _Chelton_ girls and boys fell into the course made now by the _Dixie_, for in that boat Denny Shane was at the wheel. A more delightful scene than Crystal Bay presented, two hours after the squall, could scarcely be imagined. To the motor girls it was particularly effective, as may easily be imagined. Coming back around the island the _Dixie_ picked up the lost canoe, so this left nothing to be worried over in the record of adventure.The return of the storm-stricken ones attracted crowds of bungalowers and campers to the beach; for, of course, craft of all sorts had been caught in the gale. The center of interest, however, was the _Chelton_, for that boat had already gained a reputation at Crystal Bay.Not one person came in from the bay in dry clothes; in fact, many were drenched, and naturally the girls showed the effects of the storm more conspicuously than did the boys. Bess happened to be the one ""who got the worst of it,"" among the motor girls--perhaps because there was more of her for the waves to hit.""Almost enough to make up for the danger,"" Belle returned. ""But wasn't Freda splendid? What good training she must have had to be able to manage that boat. No one else except Cora could have done it, and she was unfamiliar with the tricks of the bay. I do feel so sorry for Freda and her mother!"" This last was said with a wistful sigh, for all the members of the Mote were now much attached to the motherly Mrs. Lewis.""Cora must have known those men were going to put the 'for sale' sign on the cottage, when she hurried so to get Freda and her mother over to our place the other night,"" went on Bess. ""I knew there was something more important than merely taking care of us.""""It must be perfectly awful to lose everything that way; to feel it is all an injustice, yet not to be able to prove one's own claim,"" said Belle. ""Tricky business men are worse to watch than spiteful girls, and we always thought _they_ were about all that we could handle. There's Ted and Jean. Just look at their boat!""""Not only liable, but accountable,"" added Ed. ""Of course we will go home and dress. I wonder what on earth the squall did to headquarters?"" he asked, suddenly realizing that the camp had had need of secure moorings during the last two hours.""I rather hope she did,"" admitted her brother. ""I had some things in that tent not warranted rainproof. Hey, fellows!"" he called to the other members of Camp Couldn't. ""Hurry up. Our tent was struck, they say."""
"At the word the crowd from the beach ran helter-skelter through the woods toward the camp colony. Surely there was enough excitement around Crystal Bay that afternoon to last for some time, and there was every prospect now of new adventures developing.""Thinking of spilled grub?"" queried Walter. ""Nothing doing. We have a salvage corps department to our housewives' league, you know, and they are bound to protect the members from bandits. So you may just run along and see what is going on at the Cattle.""The storm had played havoc in the woods. Pine branches had scratched deep furrows in the white sand paths, beautiful bushes of blooming mountain laurel and mountain pinks were shorn of every bloom, and the wild roses were scattered like pink butterflies on the catch leaves of shrubs.The first camp to be met by the boys was Camp Hyphen. This was quite a pretentious establishment with a smaller tent adjunct. The adjunct stood for the hyphen, and it now lay in a heap like a discarded potato sack, its store of supplies settled uncertainly in nearby bushes.A hyphenated name seemed the worst of luck for this camp, for there was no strong pole or cast iron bar to hold the two tents together, and the ""hy"" was merely a strip of ground that gave extra play to the wind. The smaller tent was now being dragged from the bed of wet sand into which it had partly buried itself, and the campers were struggling heroically to get it back to its pegs.""You are?"" returned Dray. ""Say, fellows,"" to his own camp company, ""the best thing we can do is to take what stuff we find left and hide up at the Mote. Those fellows will come down on us and won't believe about the washed-away constitution. Who on earth put that indemnity clause in, anyhow?""""Oh, Clem did. He's studying engineering, and I suppose he is lonesome for his math. We ought to make him pay the assessment. But I agree with Dray,"" continued Walter. ""We ought to 'beat it' up to the Mote, quick. There are other tents flopping around, and everybody will be good and hungry, you can be sure.""""No, not likely,"" Jack said, ""but the old fellow was pretty wet and played out. He's plucky, all right, and I don't believe we would be in yet but for him and Freda. But he is old, just the same, and only his pluck keeps him up to it. I would like to have been more decent to him, but he won't give one a chance. We must fix it up some way, though."""
"""Seems to me the demand is rather violent,"" replied Ed, as the Couldn'ts saw what was going on. The entire tent was filled with boys from the wrecked camps, and they were making away with practically everything in the line of eatables they could lay their hands on.""The only way,"" replied Hal, a boy from the ""Mist."" ""We couldn't even keep up in starvation, but with something to sustain us we might be able to keep the law. As a matter of fact, it was civic pride that compelled us to come in here and eat.""Nobody noticed the sermon--everyone was too busy looking for food. Finally Walter and Ed, after a private conference with Dray and Jack, decided to give to the unfortunates all the food they possessed, ""in order to avert worse damage to their property.""""They did not,"" replied Jack, ""and we are not going to intrude. We are just going over to thank Mrs. Lewis for saving this camp from destruction. She hammered down those stakes. Look at them!"" he ordered. ""Ed, did you ever wield a hammer as truthfully as that?""Cora gave a sigh of relief. What a blessing Mrs. Lewis had proven to be! After finding themselves shut out of their house by a trick of the land agents she and her daughter had taken up a permanent residence in the girls' camp. Freda, in spite of all opposition, had installed herself as ""maid."" She insisted on waiting on the table, and attending to rooms, and helping her mother generally, although the girls wanted her to be one of them. Everyone declared that her mother, with her wonderful management and activity, more than made up for Freda being a visitor at the Mote.Freda seemed happier now than when she shared the little cottage with her mother, but this was easily understood. Under the new arrangement Mrs. Lewis was earning an honest and comfortable living, and Freda was more than willing to assist her in every way possible. Before, they had lived in constant dread of the land agents putting them out of their home. Even the fact that the sign ""For Sale"" had been placed on the cottage did not seem so unbearable, for the girls and boys had insisted that that was only a ""scare"" on the part of the land agents, and that while the town constable would not interfere to the extent of taking down the sign, he had promised to investigate the rights of those who put it up.The boys had come, and the supper was almost ready. Lottie looked as pretty and as well as ever, for she had dressed in a chic pink frock, and with a pink snood binding her brow looked as fresh as though she had just come from the hands of a beauty specialist. After all, such vigorous treatment and baths of spray as the girls had encountered all that afternoon amounted to just that--beauty treatment; and Lottie was not the only one whose cheeks glowed, and in whose eyes shone the light that comes only from youth and health.The rumpus that always followed the boys' arrival was in full sway, Jack and Ed chasing Bess around the bungalow to make her give up an imaginary lost scarf pin, while Dray and Walter contented themselves with the less violent exercise of rocking on the front porch, where the other girls were scattered. They certainly were ""scattered,"" for there was so much to tell and hear of the afternoon's adventure that each girl chose her own listener and her own corner.""That sounds fine,"" Dray told Freda, who in her blue linen sailor suit looked quite as well as the young ladies who put in most of their time ""leisuring."" ""Our Belle is not nearly as aristocratic as that."""
"""Dinner will make that reputation immortal,"" Jack declared, as he and Ed gave up their chase and joined the others on the porch. ""But hello! Here comes Denny! And he has no pipe! Something surely is wrong.""""'Tis nothing bad,"" replied Denny, as he sat down on the bottom step of the porch, in spite of all invitations to come up and have a chair. He settled his cap more securely on his gray head. ""I just want to--tell her something.""Cora was serving the dinner and endeavoring not to spoil it. The boys were too hungry and too glad to eat to allow any interruption to interfere with their pleasure, but the girls were prone to whisper, and even to listen when a voice penetrated the room.""Sure as me name's Dinny Shane!"" exclaimed the old man. ""Who else would have tied up little Brian, the dog that was never tied before in his life! Sure I'd like to 'a caught them at it,"" and he brought his fist down hard on something.""And I remember well how you fixed it up,"" answered Denny, gallantly. ""This is a bit like the old days; isn't it? When I used to eat you out of house and home, when Len would fetch me into your house to tempt me appetite,"" and he chuckled at the recollection. ""Freddie, you were only a tot then, but you could climb on my knee right smart. I guess you were always a romp."" This last was plainly intended as a compliment, for Denny smiled at Freda as she handed him his steaming coffee.If the young folks thought that by special attention to Denny and his wants at the table they might get an inkling of the mystery that had so excited the old man they were disappointed, for he never betrayed a word of it, and only an occasional absent look in his sober gray eyes betokened anything unusual. ""We didn't want to make a fuss over it before the boys,"" Cora explained to a number of the girls, who, next morning, were seated about the bungalow side porch, trying to get in a few stitches of embroidery. ""They would be sure to go straight at those land fellows, and we think--Denny and all of us--that the best way to do is to watch them carefully for a while.""""We don't know that, either,"" continued Cora. ""We can only surmise. They must have been after something that was neither money nor table silver."" She laughed a little at the idea of anyone trying to rob the humble cabin of a fisherman. ""The little terrier is never tied up and never troubles anybody, but it seems he did object to the intrusion, for he has a cut on one leg, made, possibly, by a heavy shoe, and when Denny found him he was tied tight to a hook in the woodshed. Denny will never forgive whoever tied Brian.""""Not a thing. Of course there was nothing an ordinary thief would have any use for; but it looks as if they were searching for something in particular, for everything was turned inside out. Every strip of carpet was pulled up and loose boards in the floor pried away. It really is too bad for Denny. He will have a lot of trouble getting things in order again, and you know he is neat, for a lone fisherman."""
"""And have officers ringing our door bell all hours of the night because someone forgot to turn out the dining room light, or the side window was found unlocked,"" said Cora. ""They have very few officers here, I should imagine, and if we really gave them something to do they might insist on doing it.""""I don't think you ought to go in a canoe until you can swim,"" said Cora. ""You know a canoe is the most uncertain of craft, except that it is absolutely certain to upset if you draw a breath in, when you should send a breath out. Jack says a canoe is more than human, but I won't shock your ears by saying what he thinks it is.""""Well, I hope Clem will put you in the very bottom of the boat, and not trust to a seat. Even a big cushion is wobbly,"" finished Cora. ""Now, young ladies, are you ready for a tramp? We have to walk to the old village this morning to shop, unless you want to go to the dock and take Frank's ferry. He will take us across for ten cents each, and we need things to eat.""""Do _you_ grow around here?"" asked Belle, maliciously, inferring that the desired walk was needed to ""reduce."" A withering look was the answer she received from her twin sister. Just the same the walk was decided upon, and a little later the wintergreen path was alive with voices. It was one of the delights of Summer to tramp and ramble; and in spite of the joys of motor boating the girls were not slow to appreciate the pleasures of dry land decked in various shades of foliage green and floral tints.The mountain laurel was at its best--that little tasselled thing we call ""pfingster,"" but which looks quite aristocratic enough to belong to the orchid family, made bouquets of itself in every appropriate spot, while the glorious rhododendrons put forth a display sufficiently beautiful and courageous to last all Summer.""Oh, Hilda!"" answered Cora, advancing to meet the girl who almost ran to greet her, ""I am so glad to see you. We are stopping at our own little bunk--the Motely Mote--on Pine Shade Way. And where do you put up?""Introductions followed, and girls from the Mote were plainly delighted to meet the others from a fashionable hotel. The meeting also resulted in a general invitation from the Cliff girls to the Motes to attend a hop to be given the next evening at the hotel.""Just duck,"" advised Belle. ""It's a great teacher of the proper mode of ducking; and that is not to be despised, Lottie, whether one has to duck harsh words, or big poles. But I want to go sailing. I can't see what fun there is in going into a stuffy hotel on a beautiful moonlight evening when we can go out on the water and see something.""It was a delightful morning, and the woods were fairly alive with young folk. It seemed there could be very few mothers or chaperones at Crystal Bay, for even in marketing hours it was always the girls with baskets, or the boys with huge paper bags, who were encountered. On benches along the beach, to be sure, ""elders"" might be found sunning themselves and ruining their fading sight with alleged art embroideries, but in the matter of housekeeping it was youth that prevailed at the bay.It was a long walk to the general store at the point, but there was a resting place there, and if one wanted to tarry and felt like dancing, a very accommodating young man sat near the piano ready to play at the shortest notice. Belle and Lottie usually took a twirl while Bess and Cora did the shopping, but to-day having walked instead of coming by motor boat they sank into a seat at the water's edge and watched others try the newest steps."
"""We just about have it,"" said one man to the man behind the counter. ""There is no question about the legal right; it is only a matter of a lost document. We may get along without it, but we understood you were a life-long resident, knew the people, and thought perhaps you could tell us something about it. Of course we don't want anyone's time for nothing.""He had raised his voice to angry tones, a remarkable thing for Bill to do in business hours, but those around who heard had no blame for him. The strangers left without taking up their cigars or paying for them. Bill looked after them quizzically.""We must not put that off another day,"" she told Bess. ""I am convinced that those men are dishonest, for why should they go sneaking around that way? Why not ask for information from the proper persons?""""I'll see Jack at once,"" declared Cora, ""and if there are not trustworthy lawyers here we will fetch our own down from Chelton. The senior member of the firm would do anything reasonable for our family, and when mother is away she leaves Jack and me full discretion. Let us hurry back before the boys get out on the water. Bess, call Belle and Lottie.""The look of relief that spread over the widow's face was a more eloquent form of thanks than words could have been, so without further delay they all hurried to the motor boat in which Mrs. Lewis and Freda had come over. It was from a bay front hotel and had come over for the eleven o'clock mail.The boy at the wheel started up as soon as all were seated, and as the launch was a good-sized one the trip across the bay was both comfortable and enjoyable. Of course Belle and Lottie wanted to know more than they could be told about the coming of Freda and Mrs. Lewis, so they had to content themselves with a word and a look from Cora. ""I will go to Lamberton this afternoon,"" declared Mrs. Lewis, after having conferred with Cora and Jack. ""I know a man there who was a great friend of my husband. He told me to come to him any time I needed advice, and he is a prominent lawyer. I have never troubled him--had no good cause to until now.""""Now, you needn't do anything of the kind,"" objected Cora, ""we girls can well enough take care of ourselves once in a while. Why, Mrs. Lewis, you have us all spoiled. We are supposed to do most of our own housekeeping in Summer camp, you know.""""Now that is what I call sweet of you,"" Jack observed as he greeted the four girls, all seated around a low porch table with knives and beans plying from basket to pan. ""Who told you we were coming to dine?""""You positively are not, Brother Jack,"" Cora declared. ""You boys think our place is an elastic delicatessen. Why, we never know whether we are going to have enough for another meal or not, and we can't go to the point again to-day."""
"""All right, Little Sister. If you have the heart to eat good string beans from old Henry's garden, and know that your brother is starving for a single spoonful, just go ahead. They will rest heavy on your heart, though. I warn you.""""It does seem as if all we do is to get ready to eat and then eat,"" said Belle with a sigh. ""I would never keep house for myself if I starved. At least, I would manage on fewer meals. We have only been to the point since breakfast and now it is time to eat again.""Cora had gone in with Freda and Mrs. Lewis and very soon afterward luncheon was announced--the beans were laid over for the evening meal. Jack stayed, of course, and wondered (so he said) why the other fellows did not come in search of him.""Oh! I am surprised at you being so nervous, dear,"" replied the mother, kissing Freda reassuringly. ""I never felt less nervous. In fact, I think now things will soon be righted. Good-bye, dear. And have a good time with your friends.""""How different from the one we rode in this morning,"" Freda remarked. ""I always feel as if something were going to explode when I sit near a noise such as that old engine made. I wonder that a big house like the Laurel can keep such a tub.""""Guests are always glad to get on the water,"" answered Cora, ""and I suppose they are not particular as long as they do not have to pay extra for the sail. Most of the hotels down here hire out their launches, I believe.""They headed straight for the island, and then ran around it to come back on the east shore. In many of the passing boats were young friends of Cora, and all sorts of messages were shouted back and forth.""I cannot get over the attempt to rob Denny,"" Cora went on, as they neared the bungalow. ""I am glad they chose a time when he was not around, for he would certainly fight. He thinks he has the same strength he enjoyed years ago, and I hate to think what might have happened had he met those fellows.""""He has never mentioned such a thing, and with us worrying as we are, I am sure that if he had any of our papers he would show them to mother. I know my grandfather trusted him more than he even trusted my father, his own son; but that is easy to understand, for Denny had settled for life here, near the property, while father was likely to go to any part of the world, had he lived. He always wanted to travel.""""I have some to write, too,"" Freda rejoined. ""I had that very task in mind. I have to write to those 'in-laws' I interviewed last week. They will think I am very ungrateful not to have written since my return. So long,"" she called out cheerily. ""I hope when mother comes back we will all have cause to rejoice. That friend of father's is a very good lawyer."""
"So the girls parted, Cora to go to her letter writing, and Freda to hers. It seemed the entire household at the Mote was very busy that afternoon, some resting for the evening, others arranging the fussy trifles so important to young girls.""Mother should have come on that train,"" she told herself. Then she waited to hear the train pass at the second crossing. ""She would be on her way up now if she came,"" Freda reflected, ""I'll get my things on and go to meet her.""Coming down the stairs she called Cora, but receiving no reply she did not wait to find her. She expected to be gone only a few minutes and it was not worth while to wait to tell Cora where she was going.""I don't know,"" answered the lad. ""Mr. Burke, at the station, took it over the telephone, and wrote it out. Here it is,"" and he held up an envelope. ""It's all paid, and you don't have to sign the book; it isn't a regular telegram.""""Wickford Junction!"" gasped Freda, as the messenger boy rode away. ""Why, how did mother get there? That's in the opposite direction from Lamberton. Oh, there must have been some accident, and she has been taken there! I must go to her!""Wickford Junction was hardly more than a flag station, and there was an agent there only part of the time. He was not there now, but in the dingy waiting room, where Freda went to make inquiries, she found a shabbily dressed woman.""Now, dearie, don't get excited,"" soothed the woman in accents that only made Freda worry more. ""It will be all right. I sent for you to come here because I wanted to have a chance to talk to you alone. Now if you'll sit down----""""Now, dearie, tell me everything,"" said the woman. ""You can trust me. Or, better still, if you will come with me to the country hotel where I am stopping we will not be disturbed. Better come with me,"" and in her eagerness she caught Freda by the arm.""I did not deceive you!"" replied the woman, sharply. ""It was for the good of your mother that I asked you to meet me here. I will explain all to you later, but not here. I can do you good. Only trust me. Come with me. I have a carriage waiting outside."""
"Then the harassed and nervous girl burst into tears. A kindly-faced hack driver, waiting outside in the hope of having some belated traveler hire him, heard. Dick Bently was a benevolent sort of chap, with daughters of his own. Hearing a girl crying he went into the depot.""Now don't you worry a mite,"" replied Dick. ""I'll just take you home to my wife, and she'll look after you. Don't you worry,"" and, after some persuasion he prevailed on Freda to go in his ramshackle rig to his home, where she was kindly received by his wife.""I'll go back to the station to meet the express that sometimes stops at the Junction,"" explained Dick, ""and, Miss, if there come any inquiries for you I'll tell where you are. But you'll have to stay with us till mornin', I reckon.""And then a new difficulty arose. There was no train to the Junction that night; but Mrs. Lewis was in such a state that nothing short of a visit to the place would satisfy her. There was no telephone available then, the Junction station being closed.This was done. In the _Chelton_, the motor girls and the boys went to Hartford, making good time in getting there. A neighbor came over to the bungalow to stay with Mrs. Lewis, who grew more alarmed as the night deepened.The trip by auto, which was taken only by Jack, Cora and the chauffeur, was marked by the mishap of a blown-out tire, but that was all. When the Junction was finally reached, there, true to his promise, was the hackman, and to Cora's excited inquiries he gave reassuring answers.Yes, Freda was all right, and safe at his house. He directed Jack and Cora there, and soon all were reunited. Then explanations were offered, Freda's fears about her mother were quieted, and the trip back to Hartford made, where the motor boat party was anxiously waiting.""And now for the bungalow!"" sighed Cora, as she took her place at the familiar wheel. A little later it was reached, and mother and daughter were together again telling their stories, and speculating much about Freda's strange message and the mysterious woman. But the puzzle could not be solved.""And no wonder,"" agreed Belle, as she went over to a hammock suspended between two trees. ""Get something for mine, while you're at it, Bess. I think they use bromide, or something like that. But I doubt if the boys would have any. They don't seem to have a nerve in their bodies, though goodness knows they're 'nervy' enough at other times. Pardon the colloquialism,"" she murmured as she sank back."
"It was the morning after Freda's return, and the night had been rather a troubled one. No one in the girls' camp felt much like eating breakfast, though they managed to nibble at a bit of toast and drink some coffee.The alarm about Freda had giver the motor girls the keenest anxiety, and while Jack and the boys tried to make Freda and the girls believe the woman and the telephone message had been a joke, it looked to be too serious a matter to be lightly passed off.The odd woman who had met Freda at the country junction had shown, by her questions, that she knew much about the disputed property. And her manner had been, in a way, rather threatening. It was too unusual to have been accidental, at any rate.But Freda had reached home in safety. The motor girls were glad of that, but they were all suffering from a bad case of nerves, though, so far, Bess and Belle had been the only ones to admit it openly.""I wouldn't take any of that bromide, if I were you, Bess,"" said Cora, as she straightened out some of the things in the living room. The usually homelike apartment had taken on a most woebegone appearance since the previous night. Everyone had left everything just where she had happened to let it fall.""Nonsense!"" exclaimed Belle. ""You've surely got a case of nerves, all right. Come on, let's do as Cora says and take a trip on the water."" She got out of the hammock--Belle could accomplish this difficult feat more gracefully than anyone else, Cora always said.Then they all went down to the little dock where the _Chelton_ was tied, and Cora, with a quickness born of long experience, ascertained that there was plenty of gasoline and oil in the craft. She tested the vibrator and found the current good, though at times, when not suffering from a fit of stubbornness, the engine had been known to start with the magneto. But it was not safe to depend on it.""I don't believe it does,"" answered Jack's sister. ""It was a sort of makeshift, anyhow. Jack only got her running because someone said it couldn't be done--it was a sort of dare. But the poor old boat seems to suffer from some intermittent fever. It runs one day and rests the next.""On went the _Chelton_, and she had that part of the bay all to herself for the time being. A little breeze ruffled the water, and the sun shone brightly. Under these calming influences of nature the girls--even nervous Bess--felt themselves growing calm, and at peace with the world. The trouble of the night before seemed to melt away, and assume a less sinister aspect. But Cora could not get over the feeling that something akin to a tragedy had nearly happened.As Cora turned the wheel and swung the boat about in a wide circle, she was aware of another craft coming toward her. She did not remember having seen it before, and as it drew nearer she noted that it contained but a single occupant--a young man, who, as Lottie said afterward, was not at all bad-looking."
"The young fellow guided his boat closer to the _Chelton_, and after she had done making mental notes of the new craft's characteristics, Cora had an idea that the stranger wanted to speak to them. Such evidently was his intention, for he slowed down his engine, so as to muffle the noise of the exhaust, and called out:""Over there,"" answered Cora, pointing to a promontory that jutted out into the bay. ""But be careful and go well out when you round it. There are some dangerous rocks at low tide. How much do you draw?""Cora and the motor girls had been on so many trips on land and water that they had learned how to meet and accept the advances of strangers, even when they were good-looking young men. There was, too, a sort of comradeship about a motor boat that lent a chaperonage to the effect of girls talking to men to whom they had never been introduced. Cora's chums realized this and thought nothing of her offer.""Follow me,"" Cora called, as she opened the throttle a little wider, and the _Chelton_ shot ahead. The other boat came right after, with a promptness that caused Cora to think it had more speed than she at first suspected.""I should have, my dear, I don't mind admitting that, if only I had had enough gowns,"" went on Lottie, with a sigh. ""But I didn't have half enough. Papa was dreadfully poor that year. I believe he said there had been a 'slump in the market,' whatever that means.Cora was rather taken aback by the proposal. It was one thing to direct a stranger, even when he was a youth good to look at, and it was all right, too, to even pilot him on his way in strange waters; but it was quite another matter to have the aforesaid stranger invite himself to a race. It was like having a beggar apply at your front door, and when given a sandwich, calmly ask for soup.""It's a race for keeps,"" announced Cora. ""And I think we'll win. That last gasoline we got is the best we ever had. It gives us more power, and the _Chelton_ is running like a sewing machine, as Jack says. I think we're going to win!""But Cora had no intention of letting him do so. She had shrewdly estimated the ability of his boat, as well as she could, though of course it was difficult, in the case of a craft she had never before seen.Foot by foot the young man urged his boat onward. Clearly he was not of that false chivalrous type that permits a lady to win whether she has the ability or not. To a really athletic girl, pitted against a man in an equal contest, nothing is more humiliating than to realize that her opponent is not putting forth all his powers. There are some men who will never try too hard to win from a woman. This stranger was evidently not of that type, and Cora valued him accordingly."
"Cora Kimball well knew the capabilities of the _Chelton_. She had steered other motor craft in many races, and was aware, almost to a revolution, just how much speed was available in a boat of this kind. And while she did not know what the rival boat could do, she was too expert at water sports to use up her last reserve of speed.""Don't believe her!"" exclaimed Cora, turning for an instant to smile at the girl who always seemed to be effacing herself for others. Then as she saw the spray coming up against the bows, and dashing over Marita, she added:""But you must,"" insisted Cora. ""Here, put this on,"" and from a forward locker she pulled an oilskin coat, flinging it back to Marita, as at that moment the boat yawed when a big wave hit the bows, necessitating a firm hand on the wheel.Cora looked back at the oncoming boat of the young man. It was within ten feet of her now, and as she opened the throttle of the _Chelton_ a trifle more, she tried to get a glimpse of the controlling mechanism of her rival's craft.Determining to end the race in good style, Cora opened up the throttle full, and advanced the spark to the limit. The _Chelton_ responded with a sudden burst of speed that carried her some distance ahead of the rival craft.For a moment her brain was in a whirl, and she had an idea that she ought to tell her chums what she had in mind. Then she decided to be cautious--to wait and watch a little longer. She wanted to find out his reason.Who was this strange young man who seemed so friendly? What did he want in Bayhead? Why had he proposed a race? And then, after proposing it, why had he not won it when, clearly, he might have done so?""I'm greatly obliged to you,"" was his reply. But Cora did not look at him, nor return his bow. She swung her boat around and started back for the bungalow. The young man, with a curious glance at her, bent over his motor to make some adjustment. In another instant his craft shot ahead, seemingly at greater speed than it had made at any time during the race.""What did you see?"" asked Bess, eagerly. ""Did he have some sort of weapon? Or do you think he tried to get us over this way, hoping we would be wrecked on the rocks? Maybe he was a wrecker, Cora. I've heard that there are some of those terrible people in this section."""
"""The antidote of the race and the excitement of the mystery, as to why the nice young man didn't want to win, are guaranteed to cure nerves or money refunded,"" said Lottie with a laugh. ""Where are you going, Cora?""""Then it is time for us to be anxious about ourselves,"" said Bess. ""But I don't believe Mrs. Lewis will worry. You know she went away right after doing up the breakfast things. She said she was going to consult some friends, for those she saw last night could not help her, and she may not be back yet. So there's no need to hurry.""""Then I have an idea!"" cried Cora. ""We have our tea outfit with us, and some crackers. Why not go ashore and have a little picnic? It will complete the nerve treatment, perhaps,"" and she smiled at Bess.Cora changed the course of the boat to send the craft over toward a pretty little wooded cove where the girls had often gone ashore for luncheon. They always carried in the boat an alcohol stove, with the necessary ingredients for tea.They carried their own fresh water with them, not depending on finding a spring. Condensed milk, sugar and some tins of sweet crackers completed the meal, which was served on the grass for a table, paper napkins adding to the luxury of the occasion.She raised her hand for silence, but there was no need. The girls ceased chatting at once, and silently followed Cora toward a hedge of underbrush, some little distance from where their luncheon was spread. The girls looked at one another with startled glances. Cora bent forward eagerly in order to better hear what else was said. She had no compunctions as to eavesdropping, feeling that it was justified under the circumstances.""Yes,"" resumed the speaker, ""we must make old Shane do it. Once we get him in the proper frame of mind he'll testify just as we want him to. And we need some testimony to offset that of the widow and her girl. Otherwise we'll never get the property without a long delay.""""Leave that to me,"" answered the one who had been in the fast motor boat. And Cora started as she noted the difference in his tone now. It was hard and cruel, while, in speaking to her, his accents had been those of a cultured gentleman, used to polite society. There was a metallic ring to his voice now that boded no good to Denny Shane.There was a movement on the other side of the bush, and Cora, with a sudden motion, crouched down, signalling the others to do the same. It was only just in time, too. Fortunately for the girls they were in a sort of depression, and by crouching down they got out of sight, as one of the men came forward to peer through the underbrush. He saw nothing, as was evidenced by his report a moment later."
"""I'm glad we came away from our luncheon,"" whispered Cora, as the men resumed their talk. The wind sprang up, for a moment, and carried their tones away from the girls, so that only an indistinct murmur could be heard. Then there came clear talk again.""We'll all have to call on him,"" said Bruce, grimly, ""but only one need actually do the business. We've got to deal with him in two ways. We've got to make him tell what we want brought out in court, and we've got to scare him so that he won't tell what we don't want known. And there are two ways of doing that.""""First we can offer him a reward. It will be worth it, even if we have to pay something to have him testify as we wish. The committee allowed us a certain sum for--well, let us say for witness fees. I'd rather pay him a hundred dollars and have it all over with. It's better to have a friend than an enemy, and you never can tell which way a thing like this is going to swing.""""I have to laugh when I think how I took those girls in,"" went on Bruce. ""I pretending that I was a stranger in these waters, and they kindly offering to pilot me. I guess they took me for some society swell of Bayhead.""It was rather an excited little luncheon, but the hot tea did them all good, and then, rapidly talking over what they had just gone through, and making all sorts of plans to outwit the schemers, the girls got into their boat again, and headed for the bungalow.Cora and her chums found Mrs. Lewis rather worried over their absence from the bungalow. She had returned, unsuccessful, from seeing her friends. Freda was recovering from the shock and fright of the day before.""Oh, just off on a little picnic,"" was the answer, and Cora motioned to her chums to say nothing of what they had heard. They had agreed that it would be better for the widow not to know, at least for the present.""Oh, yes,"" answered Freda. ""They were all here, wanting to know where you'd gone; but of course I couldn't say. Then they went out in your brother's boat, but they didn't get far before they had a breakdown.""It was anxious waiting for the girls, and they were so nervous that they did not enjoy the dinner Mrs. Lewis had prepared, at which lack of appetite she wondered much. But she ascribed their distraction, and their rather strange comments, to the alarm of the day before.""No, I don't imagine anything has happened,"" said Jack. ""You know he often goes off and stays a long time in his boat. He's got a crazy sort of motor in it, that runs about as often as the one does in the _Lassie_. He may be stuck somewhere."""
"""That's right,"" chimed in Dray. ""I've heard him say that certain fish won't bite when the tide's running out, and that you can catch others only when it's coming in. Maybe he is hanging around for that.""""Well, it's evident that the men haven't been here since the girls gave us the alarm. If they had they'd have torn up that note. Then, too, you'd think, if they were going to try to make Denny do what they wanted in the way of giving testimony, they'd be getting at it. He goes to bed early, as everybody around here knows, and locks up. If those fellows wanted to get at him without breaking in they'd come early. All of which makes me think that they may already have had a serious interview with him.""""No, but seriously. Suppose we cruise about a bit. We needn't go far from the shore, and we can have an eye on the cabin. In case Denny is out on the water we may pick him up. Then we could tell him what was on, and warn him. We could do it even better than on shore here, for there's no telling but what some of those fellows may be in hiding around here,"" and Jack cast a look about. It was dark, but a full moon was coming up to make a light that revealed most objects.""Then if there is a possibility that someone may be in ambush here,"" said Walter, ""we'd better keep a bit more mum. But I think Jack's plan is a good one. Let's cruise about a bit, but keep within sight of the cabin.""No one had any objections so, after making a casual search about the cabin, and not finding anyone in hiding, the boys again got aboard the _Dixie_ and started to cruise on the bay, that was now sparkling in the moonlight.Jack and his chums kept a careful watch for Denny Shane's boat. There were several motor craft out, for the night was one that invited trips on the water--calm and still, with a gentle breeze that had in it the tang of salt mingled with the sweet odors of Summer.Round about they cruised, and they were thinking of returning to make sure that Denny had not reached his cabin by some other route, unseen by them, when the motor of the _Dixie_ gave a combined cough, groan and sneeze, and stopped short.The boys had a way of doing the most absurd things, from a mechanical standpoint, whenever their motors refused to mote. They would dust talcum powder on the cylinder tops, or tie a piece of baby-blue ribbon on the pet-cock when they had exhausted every other means of making a rebellious motor operate.And the odd part of it was that, often, when they had done these seemingly silly things, the boat would start. So they were rather superstitious about it, and they did carry a tin of talcum powder with them, much to the amusement of the girls.""It isn't any such great, or late, hour of night,"" replied Cora, calmly, ""and the woods are not dark. There's a lovely moon. But I don't propose to go through the woods. What is the _Chelton_ for if we can't use her?"""
"""Oh, I meant if he was tied hand and foot,"" went on the leader of the motor girls. ""Villains are always tied hand and foot, you know. They can't move. They're gagged, too. I think I should insist on having our villain gagged. It might happen to be that young man who raced with us to-day, and he might get sarcastic if he could talk. Yes, I think he must be gagged.""""Yes, I think so. Besides, she is so nervous after what nearly happened last night, that I'd rather she wouldn't go out. Oh, if only things were settled! If only we were sure we could get that property back, and not have to worry about it being taken away from us!""Cora did not say so--even to her chums, but she had great hopes that something might develop from the events of this night. If the unscrupulous men could only be caught in some wrong-doing a hold might be obtained over them that would enable them to be defeated in court. Thus their claim to the property--which claim Cora felt sure was a false one--might be disproved.That there were papers in existence which would show the widow and her daughter to be the rightful owners Cora did not doubt. Freda's grandfather, from all accounts, was a careful business man, if eccentric in some ways. He would not have come into possession of property without having the papers to prove his claim. And he was not a man to put them in some safe deposit vault and leave no memorandum as to finding the key.For the engine of the motor boat still refused to be coaxed into going. They were being carried out toward the mouth of the bay on the outgoing tide, which was now running strongly. Soon they would be out to sea, and though the moon still shone brightly there was a haze in the sky that betokened a coming storm.""That isn't the point,"" rejoined Jack. ""There we took the case out of the girls' hands, so to speak. We said we were the big noise, and that we'd look after things. Then we go and get stuck miles from shore where we can't do a thing. They'll laugh at us when we do get back, if they don't do any worse.""""That's no excuse,"" returned Jack. ""It's like a child breaking the looking glass and then saying he didn't mean to. Well, I know one thing Cora will say when we get back--if we ever do--and own up that we weren't on hand when the play came off.""Nothing could be found wrong there. The feed pipe from the gasoline tank was examined, but it seemed to provide a good flow. The timer was adjusted and readjusted. The coil was looked to. Everything, in short, that the boys could think of, or that previous trouble had taught them to look for, was tried, and all with no effect."
"""Oh, hush-a-bye-baby on the jokes,"" exclaimed Dray, a bit petulantly. ""If ever I buy a speed boat again you'll know it! A good old-fashioned make-and-break motor for mine after this--one you can depend on.""""Not a thing that we could use to work against the tide,"" answered Dray, gloomily. ""There's a boat hook, but that isn't any better than a straw. I left the oars out after the man got through fixing the motor to-day. He said I wouldn't need them.""""That's right. Maybe the machine has just been giving us a try-out,"" suggested Ed. ""We certainly have said mean things about you, old Mote!"" he went on sarcastically. ""Kindly forgive us and go. 'See by moonlight 'tis 'most midnight, time boat and us were home hour-and-a-half ago,'"" he said, quoting from the old nursery rhyme.Up to now, with all their shouting and blowing of the whistle, they had neither seen nor heard of a craft. They had drifted too far out. If any had come within hearing distance the occupants had paid no heed to the calls for help. Now there was one approaching, that was evident.""I don't know,"" was the hesitating answer. ""I suppose one ought to be afraid, coming at night to a cabin where some horrible men are expected. And yet, somehow, I don't seem to be,"" replied Marita. ""I know I would have been a few months ago, but since I have met you girls, and seen the things you do, why it's queer, but really I--I rather like it!"" and she laughed.The girls were really puzzled, not only at the peaceful surroundings at Denny's cabin, but at the absence of the boys. Of course they could not know that Jack and the others had been there and gone, not finding Denny at home. Nor did they know anything of the note left pinned to the door.The others agreed. They had stepped away from the window for a moment, but now Cora walked toward it again. Denny was still holding the oar, but he must have gotten up, for the window was now partly open, and it had not been so at first.""If only Grandfather Lewis were here, what tales he could tell, too,"" Denny went on. ""And there's one tale I'd be glad to listen to. He could tell where the land papers were. If only I could find 'em everything would be all right, and the factory men--ha! we could laugh in our sleeves at 'em. Laugh in our sleeves! Ha! Ha! No, we could laugh in their faces, so we could; couldn't we?"""
"""'Grab holt!' says he. 'Grab holt and I'll pull you in. Don't be afraid, the oar is strong!' And so it is--a grand, strong oar. As strong as old Len Lewis himself. What a grand old man he was! A fine old man!""They must be around here. He ought to have kept 'em in the bank, or in a strong box; but he was always like that. Hidin' his things away in curious places. He even did it with his tobaccy. A strange man!""But I'll wager the papers aren't far from the land. That would be his way--to keep the papers near the land. 'A place for everything and everything in its place,' he used to say. What more natural than that he'd have the papers near the land?""I wonder, though, did he stick 'em anywhere around me cabin? He come over here often enough to sit and chat. Ah, many's the good old talk we used to have--a talk of the old days. Often I'd come in from me boat, and find him here. He might have brought the papers an' hid 'em here when I was out. I wonder if he did?""""No, the papers wouldn't be here,"" he mused. ""I'd have found them before this. And those fellows, who came and upset my place when I wasn't home--they'd have found 'em if they was here. I wonder what Grandfather Lewis did with them papers?""Cora and her chums looked at one another in the moonlight outside Denny's cabin. His talk had revealed something to them, but there was no clue to the missing papers which could prove the title of Mrs. Lewis to the valuable land.It was flung over. The two boats were now bobbing side by side, for they were well out in the bay, and the sea was quite choppy. The tide was running out, and help had come to the boys not any too soon."
"""Glad to hear it,"" remarked one of the occupants of the rescuing boat, in a grumbling sort of voice. ""There's so many launched on the bay now, with a lot of chaps running them who don't know any more than to turn on the gasoline and switch on the spark.""Somehow or other, though why he could not tell, Jack's suspicions were aroused. He tried to get a good look at the faces of the men, but the moon was hidden behind some clouds just then, and it was out of the question. The light was too baffling.""Well, I guess we're ready,"" announced the man who was making fast the towing rope. ""Now where do you fellows want to go? We can't promise to take you home, as we have some business of our own to attend to.""He had it on the tip of his tongue to ask that, if possible, they be landed near Denny's cabin, when a ray of moonlight glinted on the name of the rescuing boat, painted on her stern. There Jack read the word:""Sure, we can rouse somebody up if they are closed,"" answered Ed, quickly falling in with Jack's scheme. ""That will do us, all right,"" he added to the men. ""That is, if it won't be too much out of your way.""The engine of the rescuing boat was set going more rapidly, and the clutch was thrown in. The craft forged ahead, and soon the _Dixie_ was under way again. She was being brought back from the sea which had so nearly claimed her, and in a strange manner.""Because I want to fool these fellows,"" and Jack quickly told how he had seen the name of the boat that had raced with his sister's. ""If we do land there,"" he went on, ""they won't know who we are. We can tell them to cut us off before we get to the dock, in case the place should happen to be open and lighted up. Then they can't see us.""""I've thought of that,"" answered Jack. ""We'll have to get another boat, if we can, and go to Denny's cabin in her. The _Dixie_ is no good. Oh, excuse me!"" he said quickly to Dray. ""I didn't mean that--exactly.""""Say, what's the matter with up and telling these fellows we know who they are, and who we are,"" suggested Walter. ""We can tell them we know what they're up to, and threaten them. Won't that stop them from bothering Denny--at least to-night?""""All right--cast off!"" Jack had called as they neared the dock, and the _Dixie_, with trailing rope, ran up to it under her own momentum, while the other craft swung off into the darkness, the boys calling their thanks to the men."
"And while the boys were thus looking for a boat to take the place of the disabled _Dixie_, the plotters, in their swift _Pickerel_, were hastening toward the little cove where the fisherman's cabin stood.The men in the boat were Moran, the slow-moving character whom Cora had seen in the store; Bruce, the ""society"" chap; Kelly, a blunt and unscrupulous Irishman, who handled the money for the factory interests, and a man to run the boat. He had been brought in at the last minute.""Well, we were early,"" said Bruce. ""I've had a man keeping watch on Shane's shack, and he was late getting in. He telephoned to me. It's just as well to let Shane get a bit settled before we tackle him. He was out fishing until long after dark.""She pulled Bess behind a row of bushes, and the others followed silently. They had started down to the beach from the cabin, but fortunately managed to conceal themselves in time. The men, walking up the little slope toward the cabin, had not seen them.Trembling with nervousness, Cora and her chums awaited the new turn of events. That it would come soon seemed likely, for the men appeared bent on something. They had made fast their boat, and came up the slope openly, as though their errand was the most innocent in the world. The light still glowed in the cabin.They saw a strange sight. Old Denny Shane, brave and rugged, confronted the four men who had called on him. In one hand he grasped the red oar, while the other rested on the back of the chair from which he had risen.""Here you go, Shane!"" he exclaimed. ""There's a cool hundred here, and it's yours if you testify that the Widow Lewis has no claim on the land. And she hasn't any claim that she can prove. All we want you to testify to is that her husband's father sold the land some time before his death. We'll do the rest.""""Well, she can't unless you tell what you know,"" broke in Bruce. ""We've found out that much. Now the factory wants that land, and it's going to get it. Here, I'll make it a hundred and fifty if you do as we want you to.""""Not what the land's worth. That's valuable property,"" insisted Denny, ""and it will keep her in her old age if she manages right. Be off with you! I'll stick to the Widder Lewis, so I will. Be off!"" and he motioned them to the door. ""You wouldn't have got this close if it hadn't been that my dog was dead. Be off!"""
"Cora and her chums were close to the cabin now. They could look in the door, and through the uncurtained window, and see plainly all that went on. They could also hear plainly, for the men and old Denny spoke loudly. And, as yet, the girls had not been noticed.""Now, look here!"" said Bruce, and there was a snarl in his voice. ""This is our last offer, Shane. Either you take the hundred and fifty dollars, and testify the way we want you to, or we'll find means to make you, and you won't get the money. And I'll say this, that we'll treat the Widow Lewis as fair as we can.""""That is what's going to happen,"" said Cora, ""but perhaps we can prevent it. For some unknown reason, though the boys promised to come here and defend Denny, they haven't done so. Therefore, it's our place to do it.""The fisherman swung his weapon, but he either had not calculated on the length of it, or he forgot that he was nearer to the wall than he had been at first. The blade of the oar caught in a hanging picture, and was entangled in the wire.The girls were screaming, but even Cora, brave as she was, dared go no nearer to the two desperately struggling men. Bruce and Moran were seeking an opening that they might get hold of Denny. The fourth man had gone back to the boat, seemingly. He had leaped out of the window as the girls entered.""Ah, would you?"" gasped Denny, as he rolled out from under Kelly, who had sought to pass a rope about the old man's wrists. ""I'm not down and out yet!"" he panted. ""The red oar is broken, but I've got the best end yet.""Then a strange thing happened. The handle of the oar split lengthwise, and from a hollow place inside there flew out a roll of papers, yellow with age. And on one of them was a red seal--a legal-looking seal.Bruce staggered at the blow, and a strange look came over his face. It might have been that he was dazed, but his eyes lighted on the roll of papers that had fallen to the floor. There they lay--a curious roll that had come from the secret crevice in the red oar.As for the men they, too, seemed startled by the strange turn of events. Kelly rose to his feet, and was creeping up on Denny from behind. His arms were outstretched, and his fingers worked convulsively, as though they would like to close about the fisherman's throat, and force him to testify as the plotters desired."
"""Give me those!"" cried Denny leaping at him with the jagged piece of the red oar in his gnarled hands--the hands that had, so many years ago, grasped the same oar in what was little short of a death-grip. ""Give me those papers!"" fairly roared Denny. ""I don't know what they are, but they're not yours. Give 'em to me!""""Give you these! I guess not!"" sneered Bruce. ""They are just what we want--the land papers. They're the only ones by which the widow could prove her shadowy claim to the property, and with them out of the way it's all clear sailing for us. Wild with rage the three men with one accord made a leap for Denny Shane. But the old fisherman was not to be easily taken. Holding the precious papers close to him, he made a jump for a corner of the room, where hung an old musket.Denny Shane had reached the corner where hung his musket. It was not loaded. Cora knew this, for the old fisherman had said he was always afraid of some accident happening, and he never kept a charge in the gun. It was for the effect of it, he said, that he had it hanging on his wall. Now it would be useful as a club, at least--more useful than the easily shattered red oar had been.But before Denny could reach the gun Kelly was upon him. With a fierce motion the desperate plotter grasped the fisherman around the neck. Holding him thus with one arm, he snatched the papers from him with his other hand.""Here you go!"" Kelly cried to Bruce. ""Take the papers while I hold him. Burn 'em if you want to, but be sure you do the job well! Then we'd better get out of here. I think I hear a boat coming. This place will soon be too hot for us!""Kelly and Denny were struggling in the corner of the room. But poor old Denny had not much strength left. The events of the night had been too much for him, and he was giving way under the cruel pressure of Kelly's arms."
"Bruce, to get them out of Jack's reach, held them high in the air, over his head. The two were struggling. Moran and Kelly were wrestling with Ed and Walter, while the other girls cowered behind Dray, who had caught up a chair as a weapon.Cora saw her chance. She slipped around behind Bruce, and with a leap that had often enabled her to outwit an opponent in playing basket ball, the plucky motor girl snatched the papers from the man's hand. Full and clean was her jump, and the smouldering papers came away in her grasp.""I'm all right,"" asserted the fisherman, as he slowly arose. ""He just cut off my wind for a minute. I'm all right. But where are the papers?"" and he looked about the floor, on which were scattered pieces of the broken red oar.Explanations were then in order. I will be as brief with them as I can. How the girls came to go to the cabin is already known. And how the boys, foolishly perhaps, went out on the bay while waiting for Denny to come back, and how they became stalled, is likewise known to my readers.""They left us at Buler's,"" said Jack, ""and then we had our own troubles. We tried to get a boat to come on, for the _Dixie_ still refused to move. But we couldn't get one for love or money, and it was too rough to row.""""They were in the red oar,"" said Denny. ""And to think I never knew it! They were there all these years, and all of us worrying about them and wondering where they were. But I understand now. Grandfather Lewis must have hollowed out a hole in the handle, hid the papers in it, and then plugged it up. Then he gave the oar to me to keep. I remember well at the time he said it would prove valuable some day. I often wondered what made the oar lighter than it had been. It was because it was hollowed out.""I asked him what he meant by sayin' the oar was valuable, but he kept puttin' me off. He said he'd tell me some time, but he never did. Then the day he died he sent for me, and was trying to tell me, I guess, but he couldn't. I remember I wondered what was on his mind, but he was too weak to explain. So he died with his secret, and the red oar had it and kept it all these years."
