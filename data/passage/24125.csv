_A Little Book for a Little Cook_ was originally published by Pillsbury in 1905. This new reproduction has all of the recipes from the original softcover edition, but is being reissued with the modern reader in mind. The collector will note some small departures from the original book, but the little cook will no doubt find what is here to be fun to cook, delicious, and warmly nostalgic. For best results, we recommend the following recipe changes when preparing these old-fashioned recipes. When using Pillsbury BEST® Flour, there is no need to sift the flour. Just lightly spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off. When combining the flour with other dry ingredients, stir the ingredients together with a fork. Bread: Soak 1 (.6 oz.) cake compressed yeast or 1 pkg. active dry yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in 2 tablespoons lukewarm (105-110°F.) water for 2 minutes. Knead dough 5 to 10 minutes. Let dough rise in warm place until it is _almost double in size_. Grease, bottom only, 8×4 or 9×5-inch loaf pan. Bake at 375°F. for 35 to 40 minutes or until light golden brown.Soak yeast in 2 tablespoons cold water. Pour 1/2 cup boiling water into 1/2 cup milk. _Let cool to lukewarm._ Stir in dissolved yeast and salt. Add 3 cups Pillsbury's Best. Turn onto a kneading board. Knead until smooth. Let rise until three times the original size. Knead slightly, put into a well greased pan. Let rise until double its bulk and bake 25 or 30 minutes in moderate oven. It will be well to consult some experienced person as to lightness of sponge and dough.Sift flour, salt and baking powder twice. Chop butter in with a knife until mealy. Add milk for a soft dough. Place on a board with a little flour. Knead gently until smooth. Roll out to one-half inch thickness. Use small cutter and place biscuits in greased pan. Bake in a hot oven until nicely browned.
"Put molasses in a bowl. Add sugar, melted butter, cinnamon and ginger. Put soda and salt in a cup and fill with hot water. Stir into first mixture. Add flour, then well beaten egg. Beat hard. Bake for thirty minutes in a well greased pan. Watch oven closely, as ginger bread burns easily. This makes a good sized cake. ""Here are Felix and Mary Ann Looking in at the Gingerbread Man, Which was baked in the baker's pan; Cloves for his eyes and paste for his tie,-- Wondering whether the price is high."" ]Separate eggs, beating whites to a stiff froth. Set them aside. Beat yolks until thick. Add sugar gradually, then water, salt, flour and baking powder. Beat thoroughly. Fold in whites and add vanilla. Bake twenty minutes in a buttered and floured shallow pan in moderate oven.Beat butter, sugar and egg until creamy. Add milk little at a time, stirring in gradually flour sifted with salt and baking powder. Grease muffin pan, heat slightly, put in mixture and bake in quick oven.Pare potatoes, cut into dice, wash in cold water. Cover with boiling water, salt and place on range. Boil until tender, but not mealy. Have ready the cream dressing. This is made by rubbing flour and butter together, adding the milk, salt and pepper, and cooking in double boiler, stirring constantly until like custard. Drain potatoes of water, let them steam a moment, then stir lightly into dressing. Serve hot.Melt butter in a granite pan. Add sugar, milk and molasses, stirring gently until sugar is dissolved. Boil slowly without stirring for five minutes. Add chocolate square and stir until melted. Boil again until a little of mixture dropped in cold water seems brittle. Take from range, add vanilla, beat until it begins to thicken, then pour into a buttered pan. Cool and mark into squares."
