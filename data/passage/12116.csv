passage
"When the children have been good, That is, be it understood, Good at meal-times, good at play, Good all night and good all day-- They shall have the pretty things Merry Christmas always brings. Naughty, romping girls and boys Tear their clothes and make a noise, Spoil their pinafores and frocks, And deserve no Christmas-box. Such as these shall never look At this pretty Picture-book. Just look at him! there he stands, With his nasty hair and hands. See! his nails are never cut; They are grimed as black as soot; And the sloven, I declare, Never once has combed his hair; Anything to me is sweeter Than to see Shock-headed Peter. Here is cruel Frederick, see! A horrid wicked boy was he; He caught the flies, poor little things, And then tore off their tiny wings, He killed the birds, and broke the chairs, And threw the kitten down the stairs; And oh! far worse than all beside, He whipped his Mary, till she cried. The trough was full, and faithful Tray Came out to drink one sultry day; He wagged his tail, and wet his lip, When cruel Fred snatched up a whip, And whipped poor Tray till he was sore, And kicked and whipped him more and more: At this, good Tray grew very red, And growled, and bit him till he bled; Then you should only have been by, To see how Fred did scream and cry! But good dog Tray is happy now; He has no time to say ""Bow-wow!"" He seats himself in Frederick's chair And laughs to see the nice things there: The soup he swallows, sup by sup-- And eats the pies and puddings up. It almost makes me cry to tell What foolish Harriet befell. Mamma and Nurse went out one day And left her all alone at play. Now, on the table close at hand, A box of matches chanced to stand; And kind Mamma and Nurse had told her, That, if she touched them, they would scold her. But Harriet said: ""Oh, what a pity! For, when they burn, it is so pretty; They crackle so, and spit, and flame: Mamma, too, often does the same."" But Harriet would not take advice: She lit a match, it was so nice! It crackled so, it burned so clear-- Exactly like the picture here. She jumped for joy and ran about And was too pleased to put it out. The Pussy-cats saw this And said: ""Oh, naughty, naughty Miss!"" And stretched their claws, And raised their paws: ""'Tis very, very wrong, you know, Me-ow, me-o, me-ow, me-o, You will be burnt, if you do so."" Then how the pussy-cats did mew-- What else, poor pussies, could they do? They screamed for help, 'twas all in vain! So then they said: ""We'll scream again; Make haste, make haste, me-ow, me-o, She'll burn to death; we told her so."" So she was burnt, with all her clothes, And arms, and hands, and eyes, and nose; Till she had nothing more to lose Except her little scarlet shoes; And nothing else but these was found Among her ashes on the ground. And when the good cats sat beside The smoking ashes, how they cried! ""Me-ow, me-oo, me-ow, me-oo, What will Mamma and Nursey do?"" Their tears ran down their cheeks so fast, They made a little pond at last."
"Augustus was a chubby lad; Fat ruddy cheeks Augustus had: And everybody saw with joy The plump and hearty, healthy boy. He ate and drank as he was told, And never let his soup get cold. But one day, one cold winter's day, He screamed out ""Take the soup away! O take the nasty soup away! I won't have any soup today."" Next day, now look, the picture shows How lank and lean Augustus grows! Yet, though he feels so weak and ill, The naughty fellow cries out still ""Not any soup for me, I say: O take the nasty soup away! I _won't_ have any soup today."" The third day comes: Oh what a sin! To make himself so pale and thin. Yet, when the soup is put on table, He screams, as loud as he is able, ""Not any soup for me, I say: O take the nasty soup away! I WON'T have any soup today."" ""Let me see if Philip can Be a little gentleman; Let me see if he is able To sit still for once at table"": Thus Papa bade Phil behave; And Mamma looked very grave. But fidgety Phil, He won't sit still; He wriggles, And giggles, And then, I declare, Swings backwards and forwards, And tilts up his chair, Just like any rocking horse-- ""Philip! I am getting cross!"" See the naughty, restless child Growing still more rude and wild, Till his chair falls over quite. Philip screams with all his might, Catches at the cloth, but then That makes matters worse again. Down upon the ground they fall, Glasses, plates, knives, forks, and all. How Mamma did fret and frown, When she saw them tumbling down! And Papa made such a face! Philip is in sad disgrace. Where is Philip, where is he? Fairly covered up you see! Cloth and all are lying on him; He has pulled down all upon him. What a terrible to-do! Dishes, glasses, snapt in two! Here a knife, and there a fork! Philip, this is cruel work. Table all so bare, and ah! Poor Papa, and poor Mamma Look quite cross, and wonder how They shall have their dinner now."
