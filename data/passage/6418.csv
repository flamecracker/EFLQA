passage
"There were so many interesting friends of the Five Little Peppers, whose lives were only the faintest of outlines in the series ending when Phronsie was grown up, that a volume devoted to this outer circle has been written to meet the persistent demand. Herein the author records many happenings that long ago Ben and Polly, Joel and David told her. And even Phronsie whispered some of it confidentially into the listening ear. ""Tell about Rachel, please,"" she begged; and Margaret Sidney promised to write it all down some day. And that day seems to have arrived in which it all should be recorded and the promise fulfilled. For the Five Little Peppers loved their friends very dearly, and were loyal and true to them. And hand in hand, the circle widening ever, they lived and loved as this history records.""Perlice."" The girl nodded briefly, taking her face away from the iron railings enough to accomplish that ceremony. Then she plastered her nose up against its support again, and stared at Phronsie with all her might.""Oh, you ninny!"" The girl staring at her through the railings stopped a minute to laugh, covering both hands over her mouth to smother the sound. ""The perlice can go everywheres they want to. I guess some of 'em's in heaven now, spyin' round.""""An' I couldn't no more get into this 'ere garden than I could into heaven,"" the girl on the outside said at last, to bring back the blue eyes to earth, ""so don't you think it, you. But, oh, my, don't I wish I could, though!""There was so much longing in the voice that Phronsie brought her gaze down from the policemen in their heavenly work to the eyes staring at her. And she clasped her hands together tightly, and hurried up to lay her face against the big iron gate and close to that of the girl.The gate flew open suddenly, nearly overthrowing her; and the girl, mostly all legs and arms, dashed through, picking up the doll to squeeze it to her neck so tightly that Phronsie rushed up, quite alarmed.""Haven't you ever had a child?"" asked Phronsie, suddenly, two or three tears trailing off her round cheeks to drop in the grass, and she drew a long breath and winked very fast to keep the others back.The new mother didn't hear, being hungrily engaged in smoothing her child's cheeks against her own dirty ones, first one side of the face and then the other, and twitching down the dainty pink gown, gone awry during the hugging process, and alternately scolding and patting the little figure. This done, she administered a smart slap, plunged over to the nearest tree, and set the doll with a thud on the grass to rest against its trunk.""Oh, my Lord!"" The girl tumbled down to the grass and rolled over and over, coming up suddenly to sit straight, wipe her tangled black hair out of her eyes, and stare at Phronsie. ""Well, you are a reg'lar freak, you are,"" was all she could say.""It's--oh, Jumbo!"" and over she flopped again, to roll and laugh. ""Well, there!"" and she jumped to her feet so quickly she nearly overthrew Phronsie, who had drawn closer, unable to miss a bit of this very strange proceeding. ""Now I'm through pretending an' I haven't got any child, an' you may have her back."" She wrung her grimy hands together, and turned her back on the object of so much attention. ""Take her, quick; she's yours."""
"Phronsie hurried over to the doll, sitting up in pink loveliness against the tree, knelt down on the grass, and patted her with gentle hand, and smoothed down her curls. A curious sound broke in upon her work, and she looked up and listened. ""I must go back,"" she whispered to her child, and in a minute she was running around the figure of the girl, to stare into her face.""No, you don't, either."" The girl twitched away angrily. ""There ain't never no tears you could see on me; 'twas the cat or the bird. Ain't you green, though! You're green as that grass there,"" and she spun round and round, snapping her fingers all the while.""But I think you did,"" said Phronsie. ""Oh. I'm very sure you did, and you may hold my child again, if you only won't cry any more,"" and she clasped her hands tightly together. The other girl started and ran toward the big iron gate.""I wish you'd play with me,"" said Phronsie, having hard work to keep out of the way of the flapping shoes all down at the heel, ""and you may have Clorinda for your very own child as long as you stay--you may really.""""Oh, yes, I would,"" declared Phronsie, in great distress; ""see, I'm going to get her now,"" and she turned around and hurried over the grass to pick Clorinda off from her resting-place and run back. ""There, see, little girl,"" she cried breathlessly, thrusting the doll into the dirty hands; ""take her now and we'll go and play.""But there wras no stop to the long, thin figure flying down the path on the other side of the tall hedge. It was a back passage, and few pedestrians used the path; in fact, there were none on it this afternoon, so the children had it all to themselves. And on they went, Phronsie, with but one thought--to rescue her child from the depths of woe such as being carried off by a strange mother would produce--blindly plunging after.""I can't,"" said Phronsie, in a faint little voice. Her cheeks were very red, and she wiped her hot face on her white apron. ""You must give me Clorinda, and I must go home,"" and she held out a shaking hand.But the girl danced off, and Phronsie, without a thought beyond the rescue of her child, stumbled on after her, scarcely seeing one step before her for the tears that, despite all her efforts, now began to stream down her round cheeks.""Keep still, can't you?"" cried the girl, gripping her arm, as two or three pedestrians paused to stare at the two. ""Come on, sister,"" and she seized Phronsie's hand, and bore her off. But on turning the corner, she stopped abruptly, and, still holding the doll closely, she dropped to one knee and wiped off the tears from the muddy little cheeks with a not ungentle hand. ""You've got to be my sister,"" she said, in a gush, ""else the hoodlums will tear you from neck to heels."" And seizing Phronsie's hand again, she bore her off, dodging between rows of dwellings, that, if her companion could have seen, would have certainly proved to be quite novel. But Phronsie was by this time quite beyond noticing any of the details of her journey, and after turning a corner or two, she was hauled up several flights of rickety steps, strange to say without the usual accompaniment of staring eyes and comments of the various neighbors in the locality.""There!"" The girl, still clutching the doll, flung wide the rickety door. ""My, ain't I glad to get here, though!"" and she drew a long breath, releasing Phronsie's hand, who immediately slid to the floor in a collapsed little heap. ""Well, this is my home--ain't it pretty, though!"""
"""You needn't try,"" said the girl, slamming the door, ""'tain't likely you can praise it enough,"" and she broke out into a hard, sarcastic laugh, which shrilled its way out of the one window, whose broken glass was adorned with nondescript fillings.""See here now, you're all beat out,"" she exclaimed suddenly; then rushing across the room, she dragged up a broken chair, and jammed it against the door. ""There now, we're by ourselves, an' you can rest.""""Did you think I didn't know what was proper?"" cried the girl scornfully, and tossing her head. ""I'm going to have five-o'clock tea 'fore you go. There, I'm a lady, an' a swell one too, I'd have you know.""""Here's my silver spoons--ain't they beautiful!"" she cried, running up with a few two-tined forks and a bent and battered knife. These she placed, also the cracked cups, with great gusto, on the rickety table, propped for support against the wall, as one of its legs was gone entirely and another on the fair road to departure.""'Tain't stylish to have yer table agin the wall,"" she broke out, ""at a five-o'clock tea; I know, 'cause I've peeked in the windows up on the avenoo, an' I've seen your folks, too."" She nodded over at Phronsie. ""I know what I'll do."" She tossed her head with its black, elfish locks, and darted off in triumph, dragging up from another corner a big box, first unceremoniously dumping out the various articles, such as dirty clothes, a tin pan or two, a skillet, an empty bottle--last of all, a nightcap, which she held aloft. ""Gran's,"" she shouted; ""it's been lost a mighty long time. Now I'm goin' to wear it to my five-o'clock tea. It's a picter hat, same's that lady had on to your house once--I seen her."" She threw the old nightcap over her hair, tied the ragged strings with an air, and soon, by dint of pulling and hauling, had the table in the very center of the apartment, the box securely under its most delicate and unreliable portion.She gave a flirt of her ragged gown and darted here and there with her elfish movements; and presently a cold potato, shivering in its skin, a slice or two of hard, moldy bread, and some turnips and carrots, uncooked, were set about the dirty table, with empty spools in between. ""Them's the flowers,"" she explained, as she put the last-mentioned articles in their places. ""Now it's all ready, except the choc'late."" And waving an old tin coffeepot, whose nose was a thing of the past, she filled it at the faucet over the wooden sink, and put it down with a flourish at one end of the table. ""Now we're ready, an' I'm the beautiful lady up to your house--I seen her, once when I was peekin' through the fence""--she nodded shrewdly, her little eyes snapping--""her an' your sister.""""Well, I'm goin' to take you to her, when I've given you my five-o'clock tea; that is, if you don't cry. An' I ain't goin' to be the beautiful lady up at your house; I'll be Mrs. somebody else. No, I'll be a Dukess--the Dukess of Marlbrer--I've seen her in the paper. Oh, you've got to have the best chair,"" and she dragged up the sole article of furniture of that name, minus its back, away from the door; then helping Phronsie up from the floor, she wiped off the tears on her pinafore, no longer white, and soon had her installed on it. ""Now you're comp'ny."" Thereupon she ran and fetched the doll from the bed, and put her on a small, old barrel, from which the articles were dumped out, and, with a box for her back, Clorinda was soon in great state on one side of the feast. The Dukess then slipped into her own seat, an inverted tub, somewhat low, to be sure, but still allowing the view of the festive cup to be seen. ""She's my child, now. Will you have some choc'late?""--with a winning smile that ran all over her dirty face and wrinkled it up alarmingly."
"""I mean till I get through my five-o'clock tea,"" cried the girl; ""can't you understand? Then she'll be yours, an' I'll take you home. Will you have choc'late?--you must, Lady--what's your name, anyway?"" she demanded abruptly, bringing her black eyes to bear on Phronsie.""Oh, 'tain't no trouble,"" said the Dukess airily, quirking out her little finger with grace; and poising the tin coffeepot with an elegant air, she inverted it over a cracked cup, which, when generously full of water, she passed to her guest. ""Help yourself to th' cakes. Lady Fonsie,"" she said graciously, ""an' what beyewtiful weather we are havin'!""Phronsie put forth a trembling hand, as it seemed to be expected of her, and took the cup of water, spilling about half of it, which ran off the table-edge and down her little brown gown, the Dukess greeting this mishap with a shout of laughter, checking it suddenly with a start and a dismayed glance in the direction of the broken window.This occasioned so much discussion that there was no lack of conversation, and was the reason that steps over the stairway were not heard. The door was thrown open, and an old, stout, sodden woman, in a dirty, green shawl and battered bonnet stood transfixed with amazement in the entrance. She hadn't a pleasant eye beneath her straggling, white hair, and her first words were not altogether agreeable nor appropriate at five-o'clock tea.""So this is the way,"" she said gruffly, ""when I sends you out, Rag, to pick up somethin' you eat me out o' house an' home with brats you bring in""; for she hadn't seen through the dirt on Phronsie's face and clothes what manner of child was present.The Dukess twitched off the nightcap, and sprang up, upsetting the tin coffeepot, which rolled away by itself, and put herself over by Phronsie, covering her from view. In passing, she had grasped the doll off from the barrel and hidden her in the folds of her tattered gown with a quick, sharp thrust.""'Tain't nothin' 'f I do have some fun once in a while, Gran,"" she grumbled. She pinched Phronsie's arm. ""Keep still."" And while the old woman swayed across the room, for she wasn't quite free from the effects of a taste from a bottle under her arm, which she couldn't resist trying before she reached home, Phronsie and Rag were working their way over toward the door.The old woman leered at her, and passed her hand to the beads on Phronsie's neck; and in doing so she let the little arm slip, that she might use both hands to undo the clasp the better. One second of time--but Rag, knowing quite well what could be done in it, seized Phronsie, rushed outside, slammed the door, and was down over the rickety stairs in a twinkling, through the dirty courtyard and alley--which luckily had few spectators, and those thought she was carrying a neighbor's child--around a corner, darting here and there, till presently she set Phronsie down, and drew a long breath.""Yes, and your child, too."" Clorinda and all her pink loveliness was thrust into her own little mother's arms, and the sharp, black eyes peered down upon the two. ""I've brung you home, and you're on your own grassplot, same's you were."" Still she stood in her tracks.""Well, I've got to go. Say, don't you call no one, nor tell no one, till I've had time to shake my feet down street."" She thrust out one flapping shoe, then the other, gave a scornful laugh, and brushed her hand across the sharp eyes. ""Promise now, black and blue, 'I promise true, hope to die if I do'. Hurry up! Do you promise?"" she cried sharply."
"""I've got my child,"" said Phronsie, putting up a sleepy hand to pat Clorinda's head, but it fell to her side, while her yellow hair slipped closer over her flushed cheek. She tried to say, ""Clorinda, we've got home, and my foots are tired,"" swayed, held her child tighter to her bosom, and over she went in a heap, fast asleep before her head touched the soft grass.Polly Pepper, hurrying home from Alexia's, ran in by the gateway, and down by a short cut over the grass, her feet keeping time to a merry air that had possessed her all the afternoon. ""How fine,"" she cried to herself, ""our garden party will be!--and we've gotten on splendidly with our fancy things this afternoon. It will be too perfectly elegant for--"" the flying feet came to a standstill that nearly threw her over the sleeping figure, the doll tightly pressed to the dirty little pinafore and the flushed cheeks.""Lady-chair,"" said Polly, the worry dropping out of her eyes at the fun of carrying Phronsie in. But Phronsie was beyond the charms of ""lady-chair"" or ""pick-a-back,"" her yellow head bobbing so dismally when they lifted her up, that Jasper at last picked her up in his arms, and marched off with her.Mother Fisher said never a word when she received her baby, but wisely soothed and washed and tucked her away in bed; and little Doctor Fisher, as soon as he got home, viewed her critically through his big spectacles, and said, ""The child is all right. Let her sleep."" Which she did, until every one of the household, creeping in and out, declared she could not possibly sleep any longer, and that they must wake her up. This last was from Polly.""Nothing,"" said Mrs. Fisher, with firm lips. Polly must not be worried by unnecessary alarm, and really there seemed to be nothing amiss with Phronsie, who was sleeping peacefully, with calm little face and even breath. ""It's the best thing for her to sleep till she's rested.""""Say no more about it, Polly,"" said her mother, setting even, firm stitches, ""for Mr. King is very angry with Joanna; and you needn't be afraid that Phronsie will ever be left again, until we do get just the right person to be with her. Now you better go out and forget it all, and busy yourself about something.""""Best fly at it, then,"" said Mrs. Fisher, smiling at her. So Polly, with a parting glance at the figure on the little bed, went downstairs and into the big drawing-room, wishing that Phronsie was there, as usual, where she dearly loved to stay, tucked up in a big damask-covered chair, one of her dolls in her arms, waiting patiently till the practice hour should be over.But when Phronsie at last turned over, and said without a bit of warning, ""I want something to eat, I do."" with an extremely injured expression, Mother Fisher was so thankful that she had no time to question her, if, indeed, she had considered it wise to do so. And Sarah was called, and laughed with delight at the summons, and ran off to get the tray ready, Phronsie watching her with hungry eyes in which the dew of sleep still lingered. But old Mr. King was not so patient.When he saw, as he soon did, his visits to the side of the little bed being as frequent as Polly's own, that Phronsie was really awake and sitting up, he could keep still no longer, but putting his arms around her, fumed out:""So I will--so I will, Pet!"" cried old Mr. King, very much delighted; and lifting her up to rest her head on his shoulder, he walked up and down the room. ""There, there, dear! Oh, why doesn't that Sarah hurry!""--when in walked that individual with a big tray, and on it everything that a hungry child could be supposed to desire. But Phronsie had no eyes for anything but the glass of milk.""So she has,"" he laughed as gayly, ""Well, now, we'll sit right down here and have some of these good things,"" and, Mrs. Fisher drawing up a big easy chair in front of the table where Sarah deposited the tray, he sat down, with Phronsie on his knee. ""Now, child----"""
"""We'll play it is five-o'clock tea,"" said old Mr. King, at his wit's end to bring the smiles into her face. Phronsie turned and gave him one look, then buried her face in his waistcoat and cried as hard as she could.""There, there!"" The old gentleman got up to his feet and began to pace the floor again, his white hair bent over her face, his hand patting her back gently. ""Don't cry, poor little lamb."" And as a sudden thought struck him, ""Just look at your mother, Phronsie; you are making her sick.""""I'm sorry, Mamsie,"" said Phronsie, and she put out a little hand, ""I'll eat the toast."" So down old Mr. King sat again, with her on his lap, and Mother Fisher cut up more toast, and Phronsie opened her mouth obediently, and after the first mouthful she smiled: ""I like it, I do."" And Mother Fisher smiled too, and said, ""I knew you would, Phronsie."" And Grandpapa laughed, he was so happy, and Sarah kept crying, ""Bress de Lawd! yer maw knew best."" And pretty soon Mrs. Fisher nodded to old Mr. King, and he said, ""Now for the rest of the milk, Phronsie,"" and the glass was put into her happy hand.And then more toast, and more laughing, for Grandpapa by that time told a funny story, and everything got so very merry that the gayety brought all the rest of the houseful of children up to see if Phronsie were really awake.Phronsie at this gave a loud sob. ""Take me, Polly,"" was all she said. So Polly sat down on the floor, and Phronsie snuggled up closer into her neck, and was rocked back and forth to her heart's content, while Joel, perfectly aghast at the mischief he had done, was taken in tow by Mother Fisher, to sob out, his head in her lap, that he ""didn't mean to, he didn't mean to.""""I'm going to talk about the garden party,"" cried Polly, an inspiration seizing her. ""Oh, Phronsie, now you must sit up; you can't think what plans we have for it."" But Phronsie burrowed deeper in her nest.""Oh, that's no end jolly!"" cried Jasper, throwing back his dark hair from his forehead with a quick thrust. ""Now we can do splendidly. Polly, only think!"" His eyes shone, and Polly screamed out, ""Oh, Grandpapa, how lovely!"" and the others joined in, not quite knowing what they were so happy about, until Joel popped up his head from his mother's lap to hear what all the noise was about over there.So David ran over and precipitated himself into the middle of the group, with his question; when immediately the rest began to clamor to help Jasper give out the letters, so the babel was worse than at first. Phronsie sat on the stairs, halfway down the long flight. It was the same staircase on which Jasper had found her, with Polly waiting patiently on the lower step, when she first came to Grandpapa King's. Now she held Clorinda in her arms, tightly pressed to her bosom.""Oh, I forgot, Mamsie didn't want me to say that,"" said Polly, with a little blush. ""Well, it's an invitation, Pet, and to Miss Mary Taylor's, to go with us girls this afternoon to work on our fancy things for the fair. Only think of that, Phronsie Pepper!"" And Polly threw her arms around the small figure, and hugged her, to the imminent danger of both falling down the rest of the flight."
"""Can I really go, Polly?"" cried Phronsie, as soon as she could get her breath, ""when you all take your bags and work on things?"" She set Clorinda carefully down on the stair above, and stood up to look into Polly's face.This was such a height of bliss that it quite overcame Phronsie, and she sat down on her stair again to think it over. To have a little silk bag to hang on her arm to carry her work in, just as Polly and the other girls did when they went to each other's houses with their fancy work, was more than she ever imagined was coming to her till she got as big as they were. And to put her ""cushion-pin"" in it, and go to Miss Mary Taylor's with them all, sent her into such a dream of delight that she sat quite still, her hands in her lap.""Oh, I don't know that I can do that,"" said Polly slowly, ""because you know I took my piece of pink ribbon Auntie gave me, for that sachet case I'm making for the fair. But never mind, child""--as she saw a sorry little droop to Phronsie's mouth--""I'll find another somewhere, and it will be nice, even if it isn't pink.""""And come on, Pet, we'll go and find the ribbon and make the bag now, so as to be all ready."" Polly flew up from her stair. ""Pick up your doll, and give me your hand. Here we are!""--as they ran up to the top.The invitation of Miss Mary Taylor to all the girls who were getting up the fair for the poor children's week, plunged them into such a state of excitement that those who had been lagging over their fancy work now spirited up on it, or ran down-street to get more materials and begin anew. One of these was Clem Forsythe.""Oh, dear me!"" cried Polly, looking up from the floor of her room, where Phronsie and she had thrown themselves, the piece-box of ribbons between them, ""here comes Clem up the drive; now I 'most know she wants me to help her on that sofa-pillow,"" and she twitched a square of yellow silk into a tighter tangle. ""How in the world did that spool get in here?"" she exclaimed, in vexation.""Oh, I'm so glad to find you!"" panted Clem. ""Dear me! what _are_ you doing?"" And not waiting for an answer, she plunged on: ""I stopped at Alexia's--thought you might be there. And she's just as mad as can be because I was coming over here for you. You see, her aunt has something for her to do this morning. I'm tickled to death that for once I got ahead of her. Whew! I'm so hot! I ran every step of the way."" She threw herself down on the floor beside the two. ""My, what a sight of ribbons, Polly Pepper!"""
"""You see, I promised her this,"" Polly was guilty of interrupting. ""She's been invited to Miss Mary's this afternoon with us girls, and she wants a silk bag to carry her work in, too, the same as we big girls have, don't you, Pet?"" Polly stopped long enough in the final tussle with the snarl to set a kiss on Phronsie's round cheek.""Oh, I don't mean I finished it in that way,"" said Clem carelessly. ""I mean I'm done with it forever. I just hate that old dog, Polly, and so I gave the whole thing to our second girl, and she's going to work it for Christmas and send it to her mother.""""Oh, yes, I will, too,"" declared Clem cheerfully; ""I'll give something ten times better than that old dog sitting up on a cushion. And nobody would have bought it when it was done, except my mother--I'd made her--so what's the use of finishing it? Anyway, I've given it to Bridget; and now I'm going to make the most elegant thing--you can't guess, Polly Pepper.""Polly leaned her face in her hands, and her elbows on her knees. ""Mm, mm--oh, I know!"" She brought up suddenly, nearly overthrowing Phronsie, who had bent anxiously over her. ""Take care, Pet, I came near bumping your nose. It's a workbag.""At the mention of the workbag, Phronsie had gently pulled Polly's arm. But Polly was too deep in thought to notice, and she wrinkled her brows, and bent her head again in her hands. What could it possibly be that Clem was to make?""An old sachet bag, when all the girls are making oceans of 'em! I should think you'd be perfectly ashamed, Polly Pepper, to sit there and guess such things. I'm going to make a most beautiful, embroidered handkerchief case, with little violets all----""""Why, you can't, Clem Forsythe!"" Polly flew to her feet, sending the ribbon box flying, and nearly oversetting Phronsie. ""You ought not to do any such thing,"" she ran on passionately, a little red spot coming on either cheek, ""when you know it'll be just like mine. It would be too mean for anything.""""I guess there are other violet handkerchief cases in the shops,"" said Clem coldly. She was getting over her uncomfortable fit, and now she sprang to her feet. ""And I think you are mean and stingy, too, Polly Pepper""--she tossed her head high in the air--""to expect to keep all the best things to yourself, and we're all working ourselves most to death over this old fair. And I did come to ask you to go down-town with me to buy my materials. Mother's given me five dollars to spend just as I like--but I shan't ask you now, so there!"" She gave her head another toss, and walked off toward the door."
"""Oh, no, Polly isn't mad,"" declared Phronsie. She clasped her hands, and swallowed very hard to keep the tears back, but two big drops escaped and rolled down her cheeks. When Clem saw those, she turned away.""And you don't know anything about it, child. To think of making a violet handkerchief case, and mine is almost done, and none of the girls would copy mine! And Jasper drew the flowers on purpose."" She was going on so fast now that she couldn't stop herself.""Mamsie would say--"" began Polly decidedly. Then she stopped suddenly. ""Oh, what have I said!"" she cried. ""Oh, what can I do!"" She clasped her hands tightly together. She was now in as much distress as Phronsie, and, seeing this, Phronsie came out of her tears at once. Looking both sides of the road, not daring to think what she would say if she really did see Clem, Polly sped on. But not a glimpse of the tall girl's figure met her eyes, and at last she turned in at a gateway and ran up the little path to the door. Mrs. Forsythe saw her through the window that opened on the piazza.""Oh, I can't. I mean I would like to see Clem,"" mumbled Polly, with an awful dread, now that she was on the point of finding her, of what she should say. It was all she could do to keep from running down the piazza steps and fleeing home as fast as she had come.""Why, Clem isn't at home,"" said Mrs. Forsythe, in a puzzled way; ""you know I told you she had gone over to your house. She wanted you to go down-town with her, to buy some materials to take over to Miss Mary's this afternoon and begin something new for the fair.""""You see, she was all tired out over that sofa-pillow. I told her it was quite too ambitious a piece to do, and she was so discouraged I gave her some more money, and advised her to get something fresh. She had almost made up her mind to give up working for the fair altogether.""""Yes."" Mrs. Forsythe leaned comfortably against the door-casing. It was such a comfort to tell her worries to Polly Pepper. ""Clem said all the other girls were making such pretty things, and it was no use for her to try. She can't get up new ideas quickly, you know, and she was ashamed not to take in something nice, and so she said she didn't mean to do anything. I couldn't bear to have her give it up, for she ought to keep with you girls."" Mrs. Forsythe's face fell into anxious lines. ""She gets unhappy by herself, with no young people in the house and only my mother and me to brighten her up. So I talked with her a long while this morning, and at last got her to be willing to try again. Well, it's all right now, for she's started to find you, and go down-town to buy the things,"" and Mrs Forsythe smiled happily."
"""Oh, no, no!"" Polly sprang to her feet and hurried down the steps. ""I must go home,"" she said hoarsely; and not pausing to think, only to get to Mamsie, she sped away on the wings of the wind, not stopping until she had turned in at the little green wicket-gate where she wouldn't be likely to meet any one.Polly was too far gone in distress to say anything. Clem jerked up her head from the table, and raised a defiant pair of cheeks, wet and miserable. ""Oh, dear, dear!"" was all Polly could get out. But she stumbled in and put her arms around her neck, and down went the two heads together.""You aren't ever mean, Polly Pepper!"" Clem hugged her so tightly by the neck that the neat little ruffle Mamsie sewed in that very morning was quite crushed. When she saw that, Clem was in worse distress than ever.""But this would make a set, yours and mine,"" said Polly breathlessly, and coming up to shake the downcast shoulders, ""don't you see? Oh, you goosie! and I've been another, not to think of it before. And oh, such a set! Why, it would sell for a lot of money. And I'll ask Jasper to draw you the same kind of bunch of violets on your glove case, and we'll go right down-town, now. I can make Phronsie's bag when I get home. Come on!""When Clem once had the idea in her mind, she got off from the bench, and Phronsie, watching anxiously from Polly's window for her return, saw the two girls hurrying across the lawn, their arms around each other and talking busily. And it wasn't but a moment or two, and she was flying over the grass to meet them. Polly had explained that the little ribbon bag was to be made just as soon as the materials for the new glove case were bought. Polly had run up for her hat, and to get her little purse, for she just remembered that her green silk for the violet stems was nearly out, and Phronsie had said good-bye and gone back to the house on happy feet, to tell Clorinda and watch at the window till Polly should come again.And just after luncheon, for they must start early in order to have a good long afternoon at Miss Mary's, Polly and Phronsie set forth, the new little bag hanging from Phronsie's arm. Jasper went with them as far as the corner, where he turned off to go to Jack Rutherford's, for the boys were to meet there to write letters for the post office. They had promised to be there bright and early.""I'm very big,"" said Phronsie, stepping so high she nearly fell into a mud-puddle. Whereat Jasper picked her up, bag and all, and marched off, laughing, not to set her down till they reached the corner.""And I do hope you'll have splendid success with the letters, Jasper,"" Polly craned her neck around the corner to say, the last thing. Then she took Phronsie's hand and hurried along to meet a throng of girls, all bound for Miss Mary's."
"""So you must. Well, then, here goes!"" Mr. Dyce swung her up to his shoulder and went, two steps at a time, in through the crowd of girls, so that he arrived there first when the door was opened. There in the hall stood Miss Mary Taylor, as pretty as a pink.So the bag was admired, and the girls trooped in, going up into Miss Mary's pretty room to take off their things. And presently the big library, with the music-room adjoining, was filled with the gay young people, and the bustle and chatter began at once.""I should think you'd be driven wild by them all wanting you at the same minute."" Mr. Dyce, having that desire at this identical time, naturally felt a bit impatient, as Miss Mary went about inspecting the work, helping to pick out a stitch here and to set a new one there, admiring everyone's special bit of prettiness, and tossing a smile and a gay word in every chance moment between.""That's all the more reason that you ought not to be bothered with them week days,"" observed Mr. Dyce. ""Now why can't you sit down here and amuse me?"" He pushed up an easy-chair into a cosy-corner, then drew up an ottoman, on which he sat down.""Oh, look at that Mr. Dyce,"" said Clem, quite in a flow of spirits, as she threaded her needle with a strand of violet silk; ""he's going to keep Miss Mary off there all to himself. What did make him come this afternoon?""""Well, he isn't going to have Miss Mary!"" cried Alexia Rhys, twitching her pink worsted with an impatient hand. ""Horrors! Now I've gone and gotten that into a precious snarl. The very idea! She's our Sunday-school teacher. Oh, Miss Mary!"" she called suddenly.""Miss Mary thinks a great deal of me,"" said Alexia composedly. ""Dear me, what a plaguey little thing that needle is! Never mind, Phronsie, don't feel badly. I guess--oh, here it is, and sticking straight up.""""And all this would never have happened but for your calling Miss Mary away,"" observed Mr. Dyce, getting up straight again. ""What a little nuisance you are, Alexia!"" All of which she had heard from him so many times before that it failed to disturb her, so she went back to her seat in high spirits, Phronsie hopping over like a small rabbit to a little cricket at Polly's feet. At this there was a bustle among the girls.""Oh, yes, a story, a story,"" they one and all took it up. Even Phronsie laid down her big needle which she was patiently dragging back and forth, with a very long piece of red worsted following its trail across the face of her ""cushion-pin"" in a way to suit her own design, to beg for the story."
"""She thinks she'll get it done faster with a great, long thread,"" giggled one of the girls over in the corner. Mr. Dyce turning to fix her with a stare, she subsided, ducking behind her neighbor's back.Phronsie got off from the little cricket where he had placed her, and went straight over to him, to lay her hand with the ""cushion-pin"" in it on his knee. ""Then I will sell it to you,"" she said gravely, ""and the poor children can go into the country."" Then she went back to her seat and took up her work once more.Some of the girls laughed, but Alexia frowned furiously at them; and Mr. Dyce and Miss Mary apparently seeing no amusement in it, they all began to beg for the story again, till the clamor bade fair to stop the needles from doing their work.""I want a story told to me first,"" he said coolly, leaning back in his chair. ""What is all this bee for, and this fair? I know just a hint about that, but let me have the whole story from beginning to end. Now then, some one tell me. I am very anxious to hear.""""You tell, Polly,"" cried Alexia, and ""Let Polly Pepper tell, can't she, Miss Mary?"" begged all the girls, every one saying the same thing. So Miss Mary said yes, and Polly laid down her violet handkerchief case in her lap, although she hated to stop working, and began:""Yes,"" said Polly, her cheeks like a rose for fear her dear Miss Mary might not like it, ""Miss Mary said we ought to be doing things, not always talking about them and learning how to be good; and she said there were so many poor children who were waiting for us to help them. And----""""Oh, dear!"" said poor Polly, blushing rosier than ever and moving her cricket so that she need not see Miss Mary's face, while Mr. Dyce, protesting that he was not to be cheated out of a single word of the narration, made her go back and tell over the last thing she said. This was so much worse that Miss Mary decided she would let the story go on at all hazards, so she leaned back in her chair resignedly, while Polly went on:""Oh, this horrible old shawl!"" said Alexia, regarding the worsted folds dangling from her needle with anything but favor. ""Well, I didn't want it, and nobody will buy it, I know, but the other girls were all going to do things, so I had to.""""Well, go on, Polly,"" said Mr. Dyce, with a laugh. So Polly, quite satisfied that he really understood how Alexia was helping along the work for the poor children the same as the others, hurried on with the story.""Well, so then Miss Mary proposed that we hold a fair, and Grandpapa said we might have it on his grounds; and Auntie Whitney said why not have a garden party, and sell tickets, for perhaps some people wouldn't care to buy things and----""And then Polly flew back to her work again, and Mr. Dyce told such a very funny story about some monkeys who were going to give a party in the woods to all the other animals, that Phronsie forgot all about her needle, and ran over to clamber up into his lap.And then, oh, the needles flew; and Clem's green stems began to grow, and a tiny bud showed itself, and then a full-blown violet. And Alexia's pink shawl took ever so many rows, and all the work seemed to flourish like magic. And at last, Miss Mary looked up at the clock.""Time to put up work, girls,"" she cried gayly. And then wasn't there a great bustle, every one trying to see which would get hers into her bag first! And then, oh, such a stretching of tired arms and feet!"
"Miss Mary sat down by the small table and poured chocolate for them, a white-capped maid at her chair, Mr. Hamilton Dyce on the other side as grand helper. Then the girls settled down in pretty groups on the broad window-seats, and on the high-backed chairs, and gave themselves up to the supreme content of the hour.""Dear me!"" cried Polly, ""she must have it now."" So she ran into the house to get it, where Phronsie had left it on her little cricket, Mr. Dyce meanwhile saying, ""There, there, child, you shall have it,"" while he turned the little mare sharply about.""We can't ever find the needle,"" said Alexia, rushing after Polly into the library, and getting down on her knees to prowl over the floor. ""Misery me!""--with a jump--""I've found it already, sticking straight into me!""So Phronsie's ""cushion-pin"" was thrust into the gay little pink-and-green-striped workbag, and Polly danced out with it and handed it up to her. Mr. Dyce cracked the whip, and this time they were fairly off.""Oh, yes, of course,"" assented Polly, her mind on the garden party, now only three days ahead. ""Phronsie, how perfectly elegant those roses are going to be!""--pointing off to the old-fashioned varieties blooming riotously.""Oh, of course."" Polly gave a little laugh. ""Well, there are lots of poor little girls who will go, Phronsie,"" she said, in great satisfaction, ""because, you know, we're going to make a great deal of money, I expect. Why, Grandpapa has told Thomas to buy ever so many flowers. Just think, child, and the oceans we have here!"" She waved her hands over to take in not only the old-fashioned garden where they stood, but the smart flower-beds beyond, the pride and joy of the gardeners. ""Oh, yes, there will be ever so many children who will be happy in the country in the summer.""""And my poor little girl,"" persisted Phronsie gleefully, ""she will be happy, Polly. Oh, let's go down to the big gate--p'raps she's there now--and tell her. Please, Polly."" She seized Polly's hand in great excitement.""I guess--she'll--be--there,"" panted Phronsie, but she was running so fast to keep up with Polly's longer steps that her words died away on the air; and Polly, who dearly loved a race over the grass, was letting her mind travel to the delights of the garden party, and what it was going to accomplish, so she didn't hear.""To be sure I will,"" said Polly very remorsefully, ""you're all tired out. There, let's come over here,"" and she led her over to the very tree under which Phronsie had fallen asleep. ""Here's where I found you the other day, Phronsie, when you were so tired. Heigh-ho!"" And Polly threw herself down on the grass, and drew Phronsie into her lap."
"""P'raps she'll come,"" said Phronsie, and the sorrowful look began to disappear as she cuddled in Polly's arms. ""Don't you believe she will, Polly?"" She put her face close to Polly's to peer anxiously into her brown eyes.""Oh, yes, there is,"" contradicted Phronsie, her lip quivering again, and, despite all her efforts, the big tears began to course down her cheeks. ""She's my little girl, and I like her. Please let her go, Polly. And maybe she'll come soon, if we only wait for her."" It was a long speech, and by the time it was all out, Phronsie had laid her head in Polly's neck, and was sobbing as if her heart would break.It was for this reason that Polly did not happen to look up across the grass to the big gate, so of course she couldn't be expected to see what took place there. And it was not until Phronsie had been persuaded to sit straight and have her tears wiped away, because Mamsie wouldn't like to have her cry, that any one guessed it at all. And in one instant Polly's lap was deserted, Phronsie was flying over the greensward, crying out:It took but a moment for Polly's swift feet to follow, but none too soon, for the thin little face with the sharp, black eyes was withdrawn, and the flapping old shoes were beating a hasty retreat. But Polly was after her, and her hand was on her arm, and the first thing the stranger knew she was drawn within the big gateway, Phronsie circling around her with great satisfaction.""Gran."" The girl, at that, tried to fold up her arms in the remains of her sleeves. But Polly saw the long, red welts that were not pleasant to look at. She gave a little shiver, but held on firmly to the tattered ends.Rag looked into the brown eyes of the little girl not so much older, drew a long breath, then burst out, ""She's visited me to my house,"" and, putting on the most defiant expression possible, stood quite still.""Bless me; what have we here?"" Old Mr. King, enjoying a morning constitutional on the big veranda, looked over his spectacles, which he had forgotten to remove as he had just thrown down the morning paper in a chair, and stared in amazement at the three children coming over the lawn.""My poor little girl, Grandpapa,"" announced Phronsie, releasing the arm she clung to, and tumbling up over the steps, ""and please make her stay, and I'm going to let her take Clorinda,"" and she plunged breathlessly into the old gentleman's arms.""Yes, she has. An' I give her a five-o'clock tea,"" cried Rag, in a burst, who, thinking that she was probably now going to be killed, began to take pleasure in telling all she knew. ""Swell folks does; I seen 'em plenty of times on th' avenoo, an' here, too""--she nodded toward the long French windows--""an' I got as good a right, I guess. An' she let me take her doll, an' I like her. An' we had an orful good time till Gran came in, an' then we lit out, an' I brung her home. Now what you goin' to do about it?"" She folded her thin arms as well as she could, for Polly was still holding to one, and glared defiantly out of her sharp, black eyes.Rag turned as if shot, and twitched the ragged sleeves down, tucking the free arm behind her back. ""Lemme go, you girl: you hain't no right to see 'em, it's none o' your business,"" she screamed at Polly. Old Mr. King had sunk into a chair. Phronsie, in his lap, was so busy in putting her face close to his, and telling him that it was really her own poor little girl, that she had failed to see the arms and the disclosures they had made."
"""I'll bring Mamsie to see my poor little girl,"" Phronsie kept saying to herself over and over, as she scuttled off, and in a very few minutes Mother Fisher was out on the veranda in obedience to old Mr. King's summons.""It's beyond me""--the old gentleman waved his hand at Rag--""you'll have to unravel it, Mrs. Fisher. Here, Phronsie, get up in my lap."" He strained her so tightly to him, as Phronsie hopped into her accustomed nest, that she looked up.""Oh, no, child, my head doesn't ache. There, sit still, dear, that's all I want."" So Phronsie cuddled up within his arms, feeling quite sure that now Mamsie had her own poor little girl, everything would be all right.""Grandpapa,"" said Phronsie, after a moment's silence only broken by a soft murmur of voices, for Mother Fisher had drawn her group to the further corner, ""I don't think my little girl has got a very nice place to live in.""""I like my own little girl very much indeed,"" said Phronsie, dismissing her own hurts to go on with her narrative. ""Yes, I do, Grandpapa,"" she added decidedly, ""but I don't like the place she lived in. And, Grandpapa""--here she drew a long breath--""there was an old lady came in, and I don't think she was a nice old lady, I don't, Grandpapa."" Phronsie crept up a bit closer, if that were possible.""It didn't sound like a bird, Grandpapa. I thought some one was crying."" Yet she put her yellow head obediently down, and didn't lift it again till Mother Fisher stood by the side of old Mr. King's chair.Over the yellow hair the old gentleman had found out and communicated several things back and forth. One was, ""I don't think she is the child's own grandmother."" ""Mr. Cabot can investigate,"" and so on. ""Deary me!"" Grandma Bascom stopped shooing out the hens from her kitchen doorway, and leaned on the broom-handle. ""If here don't come Mis' Henderson! Now I shall hear about that blessed little creeter and all the rest of them childern.""""Yes, I see you have, an' I'm obleeged to you, I'm sure, for it's mighty lonesome since that blessed little creeter, an' all the rest of them childern went away. Come in an' set down,"" and she led the way into the kitchen.""'Tain't proper to see your minister's wife in your mornin' cap, nor your petticoat neither for that matter,"" said Grandma to herself, looking down at her short gown. So she concluded to put on her Sunday-go-to-meeting gown, as she called her best dress. This took her so long, because she hooked it up wrong three times, that Mrs. Henderson appeared in the doorway before the operation of dressing-up could be said to be finished.""'Tain't a bit o' trouble,"" said Grandma cheerfully, pulling at the second hook, which she had been trying for some time to get into the first eye; ""you set down, Mis' Henderson, an' I'll be out pretty soon.""""I must go very soon."" The parson's wife came quite close to say this, up under the frill of the best cap, which stood out very stiffly, as Grandma always kept it in a covered box on top of her high bureau."
"""It's aft-noon? I know it. I'm comin' 's soon 's I can git this hooked up""--with another pull at the mismated hooks and eyes. Seeing this, in despair the parson's wife took the matter of hooking up into her own hands, and before long the Sunday-go-to-meeting gown could be said to be fairly on.""Now that's something like,"" observed Grandma, in great satisfaction. ""I hain't been hooked up by any one since Mis' Pepper went away. Deary me, how I should set by a sight o' her, an' th' blessed little creeter--there ain't none other like that child.""""I have letters from the Pepper children, and they ask me to come over here and read them to you,"" shouted Mrs. Henderson. ""Dear me!""--to herself--""what shall I do? I'm all tired out already, and three letters to read--she won't hear a word.""But Grandma, having caught the word ""letters,"" knew quite well what was in store, so, picking up her best gown by its side breadths, she waddled out and seated herself with great dignity in a big chair by the kitchen window. It was next to the little stand in whose drawer she used to let Joel Pepper look for peppermints.When the Pepper children shut up the little brown house to go to Mr. King's, Grandma moved the small mahogany stand from its place next to the head of her bed out into the kitchen. She kept her big Bible on it, and her knitting work, where she could ""have 'em handy."" And it made her feel less lonesome to look up from her work to see it standing there.""So sorry? What's ben a happenin' that Polly's sorry?"" said Grandma, supposing that was in the letter. ""Now I know that blessed little creeter has got hurt, an' they wouldn't let me know afore the rest.""""Oh, dear me! dear me!"" cried the parson's wife, in a great fright. ""Peletiah, here are the letters from the Pepper children""--thrusting them into his hand--""do you stay and read them to Grandma. And be sure to tell her why I went home,"" and she actually ran out of the kitchen, and down the lilac-bordered path.Peletiah, left alone with the letters, turned them over and over in his hands, as he stood quite still in the middle of the kitchen floor. He never thought of disobeying, and presently he pulled up another chair, just in front of Grandma, and sat slowly down.""Oh, I know she's got hurted bad,"" she kept groaning, ""an' I shan't never see her again. Oh, the pretty creeter! Hain't she hurted bad?"" she asked anxiously, bringing her cap frills to bear on the boy in front."
"""Well, read them letters,"" said Grandma mournfully, when she could control her speech enough to say anything; ""maybe they'll tell more about the accident,"" and she put her hand again behind her best ear.It was impossible to stop Peletiah until he had rounded a sentence, as he considered it his duty to pay strict attention to a period. So, although Grandma screamed, and even twitched his jacket sleeve, she couldn't get him to stop. The consequence was that he had to shout this over till at last she understood it, and then she turned a bewildered face upon him, but as he was deep in his second sentence, he didn't see it, but plodded patiently on.""'Grandpapa is going to let us have a garden party; there are tickets to be sold, for we are going to raise money to send poor children out into the country. And Jasper is getting up the post office, which Grandpapa says we may have in the Wistaria arbor. And we girls are all making fancy work, and oh, Phronsie is making a pin-cushion which Mr. Hamilton Dyce has bought already. Just think, and oh, I do believe we shall make lots and lots of money! Give my love to dear, dear Grandma Bascom, and please read this letter to her. From your loving little friend, Polly.'""Peletiah, considering it better to read this all as one sentence, had droned it out without a break, to look up and find Grandma sunken back against her chair, her cap frills trembling with indignation.""You don't say so!"" exclaimed Grandma, greatly pleased at the hint of any festivities, no matter how distant, and the smiles began to run all over her wrinkled face again. ""I wonder now,"" she said, ""if they don't want my receet for Cousin Mirandy's weddin' cake; it's in th' Bible there""--nodding over to the little stand.""'Dear Misses Henderson.'"" Somebody must have corrected him then, for he scratched out the ""Misses,"" and wrote on top ""Mrs."" ""'You tell Grandma Bascom, please, that it's just prime here, but I like her peppermints, too, and I won't chase her old hens when I come back. Joel.'""When Grandma really got this letter by heart, she laughed and said it had done her good, and she wished Joel was there this minute, in which Peletiah hardly concurred, being unable to satisfy Joel's athletic demands. And then she looked over at the little mahogany stand, and the tears rolled down her withered old cheeks.""I'd give anythin' to see him comin' in at that door, Peletiah,"" she said, ""an' he may chase th' hens all he wants to when he comes back""; for Grandma always cherished the conviction that the ""Five Little Peppers"" were to make life merry again in their ""little brown house,"" and she went on so long in this way that Peletiah, who had glanced up at the clock many times, said at last, in a stolid way, ""There's another letter."" And Grandma, looking down, saw a little wad in his hand.""There ain't nothin' to read,"" repeated Peletiah; ""you can see for yourself."" He held it up before her. There were many pencil marks going this way and that, by which Phronsie felt perfectly sure that her friends would understand what she was telling them. And once in a while came the great achievement of a big capital letter laboriously printed. But for these occasional slips into intelligible language, the letter presented a medium of communication peculiar to itself.""Well, now tell your ma I thank her for comin', and for them letters from them precious childern. An' see here."" Grandma leaned over and pulled out the under drawer of the little stand. It wasn't like giving peppermints to Joel Pepper, and it sent a pang through her at the remembrance, but Peletiah had been good to read those letters."
"""She won't do Peletiah any harm""--and then he laughed--""and she might brighten him up, if she's the girl Mrs. Fisher's letter indicates. And as for Ezekiel, there's no harm to be thought of in that quarter. Our boys aren't the ones, wife, to be influenced out of their orbits.""""You said no more than what is always on my mind,"" said the minister again, and he pressed the hand on his arm, looking at it fondly. ""Poor Almira!"" he said, ""I didn't think how hard you would have to work to please her, when I took her here.""""Yes, Mrs. Fisher's letter must be answered,"" said the parson, pulling himself out of his revery. ""She asks if we can find a place in Badgertown for this child, who seems uncommonly clever, and is, so she writes, very truthful. And I'm sure, Almira, if Mrs. Fisher says so, the last word has been spoken.""""And the old woman who pretended to be her grandmother, and who beat her because she wouldn't steal, became frightened at the investigation, and has cleared out, so there is no one to lay a claim to 'Rag.'""""No,"" said his wife, ""I didn't have time to read more than part of it. Don't you remember, I hurried over to Grandma Bascom's with the little Pepper letters, and you said you'd talk it over with me when I got home? And then Peletiah came after me, and I ran back here to poor Jerusha.""""I know it; I cannot bear to think of it even in the light of her safety,"" said Mr. Henderson. ""Well, now, Mr. King has taken upon himself to support and to educate Rag--Rachel, I mean--and the best place, at first, at any rate, to put her is Badgertown. Now what do you say, Almira, to her coming here to us?""""Oh, yes,"" said Mrs. Henderson, ""I forgot. Then I say, husband, we will take this child. I should really love to put the brightness into her life. And please let her come soon."" A pretty glow rushed up to her cheek, and the parson's wife actually laughed at the prospect.""They're all grown,"" said Phronsie, trying to peer out into the thick twilight between the great splashes of rain running down the window over toward the garden, ""and now we can't have our party to-morrow, Grandpapa,"" she added sorrowfully.""What's philo--that big word, Grandpapa?"" she asked, turning away from her effort to catch sight of the flower-beds, off in the distance, gay with the wealth of blooms saved for the hoped-for festivities of the morrow, and she put her arm around his neck.""Oh, that? It was a pretty large word to use to you, and that's a fact,"" said the old gentleman, with a little laugh. He was having rather a hard time of it to conceal his dismay at the blow to all the plans and preparations so finely in progress for the garden party. ""Well, it means we must make the best of it all, and not fret.""Over in the library there was a dismal group. Joel was fighting valiantly with a flood of tears, doubling up his little fists and glaring at Percy and Van at the least intimation of a remark to him. Little Davie had succumbed long ago, and now, crammed up in a small heap in the corner back of the sofa, was rivaling the storm outside, in the flood of tears he supplied."
"Jasper crowded his hands in his pockets, marching up and down the long room. Polly, who was swallowing hard, as if her throat hurt her, wouldn't look at one of the boys. Little Dick was openly wailing in his mother's arms.""Oh, hush, boys!"" cried Polly hoarsely, a wave of shame rising in a rosy flush up to her brow. Oh, why hadn't she tried to keep cheerful instead of giving way to the general gloom? And now here were Phronsie and dear Grandpapa, who had ordered ""just oceans of flowers"" and everything else. Oh, dear, how naughty she had been! She sprang away from the big, carved table, over to take Phronsie's hand.""Then that'll be nice, I think,"" said Phronsie, smoothing down her gown in satisfaction, ""and I can finish my cushion-pin now""; for there was one little corner still untraveled by the remarkable design observed by the worker. But Mr. Hamilton Dyce had protested he didn't care for any such trifling deficiency, for he could put more pins in that quarter, so he should still be its purchaser.""I have, too,"" declared Van, very red in the face, ignoring the reflection on his writing and plunging over to Jasper. ""Haven't I, Jasper, written a letter for the post office? Say, haven't I?""--gripping him by the jacket-sleeve.Little Dick at that stopped sniveling, and slipped off from his mother's lap. ""I did, too, write some, ten, three, 'leven, just as many as you did."" The tears trailed off from his red cheeks as he bobbed his head emphatically.""Why, how very jolly you all are!"" observed Miss Mary. The rain-drops were glistening on her hair and cheeks, where she had scampered away from the protecting umbrella at the foot of the steps. ""Oh, I'm not wet, Mrs. Fisher""--Mother Fisher at this moment coming in with her mending basket. ""I left my mackintosh in the hall.""""Well, well,"" exclaimed Mr. Hamilton Dyce. Joel had left sparring with Van and now swarmed around the newcomer, for he was extremely fond of him. ""How are the letters coming on, Jasper? By the way, I've a few belated ones, in the pockets in my coat out in the hall. I'll get them.""""Joel, what did you say?"" Mother Fisher glanced up, the lines of worry that had settled over her face at the terrible disappointment that had befallen the family, disappearing, now that the usual cheeriness was coming back."
"""There, there, Davie, mother's boy, it's all right""--smoothing the hair away from the hot brow--""we can have the garden party another day, and then perhaps there'll be all the more pleasure and good time.""""That's the trouble with crying,"" observed Mother Fisher wisely; ""it makes you twice sorry--once when you're doing it, and the next time when it shows. You can't help it now, Davie, so run along. Mother wants you to.""""Oh, I haven't done it--anything to make them happy,"" cried Polly, the wave of color again flooding her cheeks; ""indeed I haven't, Miss Mary. I've been bad and wicked and horrid,"" she said penitently, her head drooping.""Well, don't let us talk now about it; we will look at the letters."" Miss Mary drew her within the den. There stood Jasper behind the table perfectly overflowing with epistles of every sort and size, while little packages, and some not so very little, either, filled up all the receptacles possible for mail matter.""Oh, dear me!"" exclaimed Grandpapa, at the sight. Letters were scattered here and there in the thickest of piles all along the surface, while the Chinese vase had a whole handful poking up their faces as if to say, ""Here we are, all the way from China.""""No, is it?"" cried Grandpapa, highly gratified; and, lifting her up to a level with his face, he kissed her on both cheeks. ""Now, Phronsie, I shall always keep that letter,"" he said, as he set her down.""The very thing!"" cried Jasper enthusiastically. ""Here, all you good people""--he whirled around--""if you want to help, please sit down, and we'll get this mess of letters sorted and tied up into bundles."" He waved his hands over his head, and of course everybody stopped talking at once.""Let's ask Miss Mary,"" said Polly. So Jasper called, ""Miss Mary!"" but she didn't seem to hear, which perhaps wasn't so very strange, after all, as Mr. Dyce was telling her something which must have been very interesting, over in the corner. When at last the summons reached her, she came hurrying over with very pink cheeks. ""Oh, what can I do to help?""When Miss Mary saw what was wanted of her, she proposed that Jasper give out twelve letters to each person, who should tie them up neatly, and put in a big basket. Then they would be ready to take out to the post office in the Wistaria arbor, and to be sorted into the little boxes which Grandpapa had commissioned the carpenter to make all up and down the sides, leaving one end free for the delivery window. The door for the postmaster and his assistants was to be at the opposite corner.And in a minute or two, Joel came back with Percy, carrying the basket, a big market affair, between them. And when he saw what fun they were having over it, for they were both laughing merrily, Van wished he had gone.And seeing his dismal face, Jasper sent him after a ball of twine. And then Phronsie wanted to get something, and little Dick teased to go too, so Grandpapa suggested they should go after some extra pairs of scissors."
"""Oh, you better stop working, Mrs. Fisher."" Old Mr. King popped his white head in at the library door. There sat Mother Fisher by the table, mending away as usual, for the stockings never seemed to be quite done. ""And come into Jasper's den and see how fine we all are!"" he added gayly.""We're going to cut letters,"" said Phronsie, with an important air, her fingers already in the basket, which, standing on tiptoe, she had pulled quickly over toward her in her eagerness. ""And may we have your scissors, Mamsie?""Mother Fisher had drawn Phronsie up to her bosom, where she cuddled her to her heart's content. ""Now, child,"" she said, after a minute, ""I think you ought to help to pick up the things and put them in the basket. See how nicely Dicky is doing it.""And in shorter time than it takes to tell it, the spools, and mending cotton, and tape measure, and, dear me! the ever-so-many things of which Mrs. Fisher's big workbasket was always full, were all collected from the nice time they were having on the floor, and snugly set up in their places again. And Mother Fisher, escorted by the children and old Mr. King, who by this time was laughing quite gayly once more, was going out into the hall, on the way to Jasper's den. And Phronsie had the big cutting-out shears, and little Dick the smaller, little snipping-thread scissors.""We've called to condole with you all,"" said both gentlemen, as they were divested of their wet garments, ""but it doesn't seem as if our services were needed""--with a glance at Grandpapa and his group.""Oh, my family gets over any little disappointment such as bad weather,"" observed the old gentleman, with pride. ""Well, come this way, the principal object of interest is in Jasper's den; no need to announce it""--as the peals of laughter and chatter sounded down the long hall. And so, after all, it turned out to be the very best thing that the garden party did not take place until two days after, for all was then as sweet and fresh as a rose--all but one thing. And that was, on the very morning of the eventful day, Mrs. Chatterton drove up.But then, as Jasper observed to Polly when this dire news was announced, ""Cousin Eunice was always turning up when least wanted."" And Polly had, as usual, to keep back her own thoughts on the subject, to comfort him. It would never do to add to his dismay.""Well, you know she does,"" said Jasper gloomily, and squaring round--""always picking and carping at something or somebody; and now Father will be all upset by her. If she had only waited till to-morrow!""""And just think how good Father has been,"" went on Jasper, too miserable to keep still, ""and all those flowers he had ordered, for of course he couldn't let the florists suffer, and that he sent to the hospitals when it poured so.""""And now he has ordered another lot, and everything else--why, you know, Polly, there isn't anything Father hasn't done to make this fair a success, and now she has come!"" Jasper flung himself into a chair and buried his face in his hands.""Now where are those two, Polly and Jasper?"" said old Mr. King to himself, coming to the library in a great state of irritation. ""I've searched this house for them, and nobody seems to have the least idea where they have gone. Polly! Jasper!"" he cried loudly, and it wasn't a very pleasant voice, either."
"""Hey?"" The old gentleman whirled around from the table, where he had begun to throw the papers about. ""Did you know Mrs. Chatterton had come back?"" He glared at them over his spectacles, which he had forgotten to remove when he had been interrupted with the unwelcome news while peacefully reading the morning paper.""Are they so?"" Grandpapa beamed at her, all his happiness returned. ""So you want me to tell you how to arrange them, eh?"" And his satisfaction in being appealed to was so intense that he held his head high. ""Well, come on,"" and he laughed gayly.Mrs. Chatterton, newly arrived in the handsome suite of apartments Cousin Horatio's hospitality always allowed her, looked out of the window, and, having no one else to confide her opinions to, was not averse to chatting with her French maid.""Isn't it perfectly absurd, Hortense, to see that old man?--and to think how particular and aristocratic he used to be! Why, I can remember when he would hardly let Jasper speak to him in some of his moods, and now just see that beggar girl actually holding his hand, and he laughing with her.""""She is not a beggaire, madame,"" declared Hortense pertly, opening her black eyes very wide. ""Oh!"" She extended her hands and burst into a series of shrill cackles. ""Why, she's like all de oder children in dis house, and I think truly, madame, de best.""""Go back to your work, I say,"" commanded Mrs. Chatterton, in a fury, forgetting herself enough to stamp her foot. So Hortense picked up the gown, but she continued to cackle softly to herself, with now and then a furtive glance at her mistress.Outside, with all the sunny influence of the summer morning upon him, old Mr. King, and Polly, and Jasper went about, superintending the placing of the flowers. For there seemed to be a great many in the pots, with ferns and palms, to distribute where they would best show off and be persuaded to swell the poor children's fund.""I think so, too,"" said Polly, coming out of her rapture. Thereupon ensued such a busy time!--especially as old Turner and two of his under-gardeners came up for directions, and Mr. King went off with them. So for the next hour Polly seemed to be on wings, here, there, and everywhere, and breathing only the sweet fragrance of the flowers.Long before that time, the avenues and streets leading out to the Horatio King estate were thronged with children of all ages and sizes; most of them with their nurse-maids, all bound to the scene of the garden party, their small purses dangling by chains from their arms, or carried carefully in their hands. For wasn't this to help poor children who didn't have any pleasant homes, but lived in stuffy tenement houses, to go out into the broad, beautiful country, where they could race in the fields and play with the chickens, and pick all the flowers they wanted to? And so, ever since the announcement had been made that such a fund was to be raised, there had been much hoarding of pennies, and no slight self-denial on the part of the younger element, who would naturally be drawn into the plan.All the society people were to drive up later; and until the early evening hours it was to be the function of the town, which every one was anxious to attend. But everybody in Mr. King's household was to be ready to receive, exactly at three o'clock.Phronsie was in the highest of spirits, having Grandpapa's hand to cling to, trying to welcome all the guests, and keeping one eye out to see that Rachel was enjoying herself, attired in a pretty, pink cambric gown, her black hair--which now seemed, oh, so soft and pretty!--tied back with little pink bows. And Rachel's eyes--well, there! no one would ever have suspected that they had only been accustomed to the squalor of Gran's apartment, and Gran herself, but one short week ago. They now looked on the world in general, and this fair scene in particular, with all the nonchalance of one born and brought up in the midst of such conditions as could bring about a state of affairs like the present that surrounded her. And many asked, ""Who is that child?"" for it was clearly seen that she wasn't of the set that was thronging the grounds."
"Rachel herself was wholly unconscious of the remarks that were being made, so she devoted her heart and soul to the duty assigned to her, that of waiting on Polly and her bevy of school friends in one of the flower-bowers. And she never bothered about any curious glances, or asides, until a chance remark struck her ear as she was hurrying across the lawn, which she thought needed attention; then she raised her head, and her black eyes grew sharp and intent. It was Mrs. Chatterton who was speaking.""Yes, it's a little beggar girl he took in,"" and the cackle was unpleasant that accompanied the words. ""Dear me! I expect she'll rob us all; such creatures are so sly."" She was pointing out Rachel to one of her friends lately arrived from Europe, and who had exerted herself to come early and see the children.""Do you mean me?"" demanded Rachel, her black eyes, like gimlets, on the long, cynical face. ""'Cause if you does, I can tell you that what I does, I does right out on top; an' I guess by the looks o' you, that ain't your style.""""You impertinent creature!"" exclaimed Mrs. Chatterton, her long face crimson with passion, not allayed by seeing that her friend could with difficulty control her amusement. ""She'll tell this everywhere,"" she fumed within. ""I shall go and speak to my cousin, Mr. King, about you, girl."" She moved her arm and shapely hand, both very beautiful still, and well exhibited on every occasion, and started off with great dignity.As soon as they had disappeared down a winding path, Rachel's amusement quite left her. She drew herself up stiffly, and hurried back to Polly, to be the same quiet, attentive, deft little maiden as before.""I'll take it,"" said the little tot who had to stand on tiptoes to peer over the table with its blooming beauty. ""I want it for my mamma,"" and he gave his smart little cane to the nursemaid to hold, while he opened his purse.""Here's Rick Halliday,"" called Clem, at the other end of the table. ""Now I'm going to make him buy something of me. We must all make him, girls; his father's given him oceans of money to spend, of course.""""I shan't buy anything of you, Clem Forsythe,"" loudly declared small Rick over to her, taking his little cane from the nursemaid's hand, ""anyway. And beside, my papa said if any one teased me to spend my money, I was to come right away. But he didn't believe they would here."" And with his basket of flowers for his mother, he moved off with great dignity across the lawn, swinging his cane as he had noticed the men did.""Of all kids, I do think that Rick Halliday is the most detestable infant,"" exclaimed Clem, in great discomfort. ""Oh, yes, Mrs. Nunn""--her face brightening--""we have heliotrope, ever so much of it."" She thrust her hands into a big vase overflowing with fragrance. ""How many? Oh, three dozen sprays. Yes, indeed."""
"And the bands--one at the end of the big lawn, and the other on the terrace at the farther side of the house--were playing their sweetest; and now the society folk began to put in an appearance among the throngs of children. Everybody was in gala attire, and the garden party was at its height.""Come on, Joel,"" called another of the postmen, who happened to be Percy, rushing along. ""I'm going to get my mail bag now, there's just a crowd of folks waiting over there for letters""--pointing over to the pine grove.""So will I get mine,"" shouted Joel, ""and see here""--waving his ten-dollar bill--""what Mr. Cabot sent to Jasper. I guess that'll send one poor child off into the country, Percy Whitney! Won't that be prime!""There was such a crowd around the Wistaria-arbor post office, that Percy and Joel, who much preferred being letter-carriers to helping Jasper within, had to crawl in under the vines, to find the mail bags.But Jasper, who was trying to satisfy the demands of a throng of people all clamoring at the small window for letters, didn't see it, or even hear his name called. So the ten-dollar bill lay perfectly still where it fell, until it got all tired out, and a little puff of wind, sweeping through the arbor, blew it first to one side, and then to the other, until at last it fell down among a tangle of evergreen with which the posts of the arbor were wound. And presently, Van, who much preferred being assistant to Jasper to running about as a letter carrier, came along and exclaimed, ""Oh, that silly old green stuff! It takes up so much room!"" And he twitched off a lot of it, and the ten-dollar bill, well crumpled up inside of the bunch, sighed and said to itself as it was flung under the counter, ""Now I guess I'm dead and buried forever.""And, ""Joel Pepper!""--from clear across the lawn--""come over here; Mrs. Singleton wants to see you about some letters,"" until Joel began to feel that he was about running the whole post-office department, and it seemed as if every drop of blood was in his chubby face, he was so hot. But he never thought of being tired, he was so happy, plunging on.""Oh, my gracious, honey! you done mos' knocked de bref out o' me!"" It was Candace, who had left her little shop on Temple Place to help forward the garden party, against whom he had come up, careless where he was going.""And what'll Mis' Cabot and Mis' Alstyne say?"" groaned Candace. Then she sat right down on the grass and began to pick at the dolls discontentedly. ""W'y couldn't you 'a' looked whar you're goin', Mas'r Joel?""""Joel, aren't you coming with that letter bag?"" and, ""Joel Pepper, hurry up!"" The cries were now so insistent that Joel dashed away, stopped, and rushed back tumultuously. ""Oh, Candace, I'm so sorry!"" He flung himself down on the grass by her side. Distress was written so plainly all over his hot face that Candace stopped in her work over the dolls to turn and regard him.""Not a mite,"" protested Candace, bobbing her own woolly head in a decided fashion. ""Dear me! now I'm afraid I discomberated my turban, an' it's my spick an' span comp'ny one Mr. King give me for this yere berry occasion,"" and she put up both black hands to feel of it anxiously. Joel jumped to his feet and ran all around the big figure to get the most comprehensive view."
"""You shan't either; I ain't slow,"" cried Joel, answering both statements at once, and whirling around in an endeavor to keep the bag at his back. But Van flew for it, disdaining to waste more time over arguments.Candace stretched out a large, black hand. ""See here, now, Mas'r Van, leggo dat bag."" She seized him by the jacket collar with such a grip that he dismissed all thoughts of the mail bag, his one concern now being to get free from Candace.""Yer see, Mas'r Joel was a-helpin' me,"" said Candace, slowly releasing Van's jacket collar, ""an' 'twarn't none 'o his fault dat he stopped kerryin' de letters."" But Van was off from under her open fingers and shot across the green in the opposite direction from little Dick and his party.""Now I'll take my dolls to de ladies,"" observed Candace, bundling them up in her clean, checked apron. She sent a satisfied glance after Joel, making quick time toward the post office, then waddled off.""Boy!"" called a fine, imperious voice, as Joel dashed by a group of ladies and gentlemen. As there wasn't any other boy in sight, he might be supposed to be the one wanted; but Joel by this time was frantic to get to the post office, and with his mind filled with mortification and distress at his delay from his duty, he paid no heed to the call, now repeated more insistently.""Oh, yes, you are,"" she declared; ""we all know it, so there is no use in your denying it. Well, you get us some ices and be quick about it."" She dismissed him with a wave of her beautiful arm, in its flowing, lace drapery.""Well, I must say,"" protested Mrs. Chatterton, an angry light coming into her cold eyes, and turning around on him sharply, ""that this isn't very friendly in you, Mr. Vandeusen, to pit that upstart boy against me. Now there will be no managing him hereafter.""""Well, but, Mrs. Chatterton,"" broke in one of the other gentlemen, in a propitiatory voice, and leaning over her chair, Mr. Vandeusen turning calmly on his heel to survey the distant lawns through his monocle, ""a beggar, don't you know--well, it isn't the pleasantest thing in the world to be called that, don't you know?""""And as for you, Miss Tresor, I should consider it wiser for you to be silent."" Mrs. Chatterton turned on her with venom. ""What do you know about these miserable Peppers that infest my cousin's house, pray tell?""Well, by the time that six o'clock came, there wasn't so much as a scrap of a letter left in Jasper's post office, but, instead, a box crammed full of silver pieces and banknotes. And Miss Mary Taylor and Mr. Hamilton Dyce, and some other young ladies and gentlemen whom they drilled into the service, shut themselves up in the library and wrote as fast as ever they could make their pens fly over the paper, till little white piles appeared on the table. And Percy and Joel and Van and the other boys would rush in for these same piles to put them in the post office, to earn more money, to go into the big box. So back and forth ran these letter carriers, until even Miss Mary threw down her pen.And then a card was put up outside the Wistaria arbor, ""Post Office Closed."" And everybody who still had money, was anxious to spend it before going home; so it was just lavished on the flower-bowers, the fancy-work table, and the candy shop.And then, when there wasn't anything more to be bought or sold, the bands moved down nearer to the center of the big lawn, making the gay little groups all move back, leaving a broad, smooth surface, for the affair was to end in dancing on the green.Meanwhile Grandpapa was gallantly offering his arm to Madam Dyce, and leading her up to an esplanade on the upper terrace, and, word being spread about that all the guests were expected to follow, there they found seats and little tables and a bevy of waiters to serve a delicious supper. And here the dancing on the green below by the young people could be seen in all its gayety, the setting sun casting bright gleams upon the merry scene."
"""Dear me! shouldn't you think those young people would be tired enough after all they have worked,"" observed the old gentleman, leaning back in his comfortable chair, ""to sit still and take it easy with us here?""""Did we not?"" laughed Grandpapa, too. And then up came some merry groups, tired of dancing, after some supper, when down they would go again, fortified and refreshed, to begin it all over once more. At last, even the lingering ones were obliged to say good-bye. The evening had shut in and the brilliant garden party was a thing of the past. The King household was resting and talking it all over on the spacious veranda, luxurious in its cushions and rugs, its easy-chairs and hammocks.""Oh, it has been so perfectly beatific!"" exclaimed Polly, in a rapture. She was curled up on the top step, her head in Grandpapa's lap, who was ensconced in a big chair with Phronsie's tired little face snuggled up on his breast. ""Hasn't it, Alexia?"" For Alexia was going to stay over night.""Oh, my!"" Alexia gave a sigh and squeezed Polly's hand. ""I never had such a good time in all my life, Polly Pepper,"" she declared. ""The poor children won't begin to get the fun out of it that we've had.""""Eh?"" asked Jasper. Everybody was chatting and laughing, so it wasn't strange that things couldn't be heard the first time. So Joel shouted it again, glad to be allowed to scream such a splendid contribution over and over. ""The big bill, wasn't it prime, Jasper!""""I laid it--right down. Oh, dear me!"" Joel was pretty far gone in distress by this time, and blubbered miserably, as they all raced across the greensward, Polly and Alexia following swiftly. ""Hold on there, James,"" ordered Jasper, to one of the three men busy dismantling the post office of its improvised trimmings of pine branches.""Is that so, sor?"" said James, in great concern. ""Well, if I'd 'a' known it, I'd 'a' kept a sharp eye out for it, sor."" Polly and Alexia were already in the arbor in the thickest of the green branches scattered over the floor, and the boys were picking and pulling wildly, everywhere a banknote could be supposed to hide. ""What was it, sor?"""
"""A banknote,"" said Jasper, down on his knees, prowling over the floor with both hands, while Joel, who could scarcely see for the tears that streamed down his chubby cheeks, searched desperately on all sides.""And Joel is so dreadfully careless,"" said Alexia, determined to grumble at something, and poking aimlessly at the green branches scattered on the floor. ""I don't suppose we'll ever find it in all this world, in such a mess.""""Well, we can't; it's perfectly hopeless--so do keep still. Just look at all this."" Alexia waved her arms at the green draperies. ""I'm going to pull the rest down anyway, though; that'll be fun,"" and she made a dash at it.""Oh, dear me!"" wailed Alexia. ""Polly, _please_ get up."" She ran all around her, wringing her hands. ""Oh, what did I say it for! Polly, Polly Pepper, we'll find it, as sure as anything. We can't help but find it. Polly, do get up.""""Oh, I couldn't help it,"" exclaimed Alexia remorsefully. ""There! Oh, dear me! you've scared me 'most to death, Polly Pepper. Do get up."" So Polly sat straight, and Alexia fussed over her, all the while repeating, ""We will find it, Polly.""""Well, what's the use?"" began Alexia. ""Oh, yes, of course we'll find it,"" she brought herself up quickly. ""Now, Polly, I tell you."" She sprang to her feet. ""Let's clear a place in this corner""--and she rushed over to it--""and then pick up every branch and shake it, and put it over here. Then we'll know surely whether that horrid thing is on the floor or not.""""So we shall,"" cried Polly, getting up on her feet; ""that's fine, Alexia!"" And they set to work so busily they didn't hear when the boys came back from their search. But the first moment she saw Jasper's face, Polly knew that the hunt was unsuccessful, and the next minute Joel threw himself into her arms and hugged her closely."
"Polly patted his poor head and cuddled it in her neck. ""Oh, Joey, we'll find it,"" she said, swallowing a big lump in her throat; ""don't cry, dear,"" while Alexia sniffed and wrung her hands, fiercely turning her back on them all.""I will,"" announced Van, rushing over to twitch down the green drapery that had been such a piece of work for the gardeners to put up. Percy said nothing, but set to work quietly, lifting each branch to peer under it.""Take care,"" warned Jasper, pausing a minute in his own work to look over at Van's reckless fingers; ""you must shake each one as you pull it down, before you throw it out on the grass, else we'll have all our work to do over again. Oh, Alexia, are you coming to help?""""Hurrah!"" Jasper leapt down from the railing and plunged up in great excitement to Polly and Joel. ""There, old fellow, what did I tell you?"" he cried with glowing face, and clapping Joel on the back again.It was too much; and Joel, who had hopped out of Polly's lap, flung himself on the floor and cried as if his heart would break. They couldn't get him out of it, so Jasper just picked him up and marched off to the house with him to give him to Mother Fisher.And the next morning, search as hard as they could--and everybody was hunting by that time--not a trace of the ten-dollar bill could be discovered. And Mrs. Chatterton took pains to waylay Joel in the hall or on the stairs at all possible opportunities, and ask him, with a smile at his swollen nose and eyes (for he had cried so he could hardly see), if he had found it yet. But these chances became very few, for it was Jasper's and Polly's very especial business to keep guard over Joel, and try to divert him in every way. Meantime the hunt went on. And the third day, when it became perfectly apparent to the entire household that the banknote was in such a clever hiding-place that no one could find it, Joel, his tears all gone, marched into Mr. King's writing-room and up to his big table, and without a bit of warning burst out:""Grandpapa""--Joel laid a brown hand on the velvet morning-jacket, and brought his black eyes very close to the gentleman's face--""I've got to earn that ten dollars; I've got to, Grandpapa, 'cause I lost it."" Joel's voice broke here, but he recovered it and dashed on, ""And I can't do it unless you will let me sell tin. _Please,_ Grandpapa dear. Mr. Biggs used to, in Badgertown, you know, and he took me with him sometimes on his cart, so I know how; and I can sell a lot. I can wheel it in my express wagon, and--"" Joel by this time was running on so glibly, under the impression that if he didn't stop, Mr. King would be induced to say yes, that the old gentleman was forced to put up his hand peremptorily.And in a minute or two Joel was perched on the old gentleman's knee, and they were having the most sociable time possible. And before long Joel forgot he hadn't laughed for oh, such a long while, and lo and behold! Grandpapa said something so very funny that they both burst out into a merry peal, that rang out into the wide hall beyond.""Joel is actually laughing,"" exclaimed Polly, coming soberly down the stairs; and she was so overcome by the joyful sound that she sat right down on the step. ""Oh, dear me, how perfectly lovely!"" she breathed, folding her hands in delight.So they both flew off from the stairs to begin the search for the money again. For no one stopped--dear me, not a bit of it!--the hunt for the hidden ten-dollar bill. Everybody but Phronsie and little Dick searched and prowled in every nook and corner where there was the least possible chance that the ten-dollar bill could be in hiding. They had both been so sleepy on the evening of the garden party when the loss had been announced, that it fell unheeded on their ears. And afterward all the household was careful to keep the bad news from them. So the two children went on in blissful unconsciousness of Joel's trouble, while the grand hunt proceeded all around them."
"""And you must keep at it,"" said the old gentleman decidedly, ""else no pay. There's to be no dropping the job, once you take it up. If you do, you'll get no money. That's the bargain, Joe?""--with a keen glance into the chubby face.""Yes, we'll hurry, seeing our business arrangement is all settled,"" laughed the old gentleman. ""Now, then, Joel, my boy, we'll go down-town and buy the blank book, so that I can set you to work at once,"" and he grasped the brown hand tightly, and away they went.And in ten minutes everybody knew that Joel was going to make a list of all the books in a certain case in old Mr. King's writing-room, and that Grandpapa and he were already off down-town to buy a new blank book for the work. And at the end of it--oh, joy!--Joel was to have a crisp ten-dollar bill to replace the one he had lost. ""Here she comes!"" roared Mr. Tisbett. The townspeople, hurrying to Badgertown depot to see the train bearing the new little girl sent on by Mrs. Fisher to their parson's care, crowded up, Mr. and Mrs. Henderson smilingly in the center of the biggest group.""Oh, husband, I do pity her so!"" breathed the parson's wife. ""Poor thing, she will be so shy and distressed!"" The parson's heart gave a responsive thrill, as he craned his neck to peer here and there for their new charge. ""She hasn't come. Oh, dear me!""--as a voice broke in at his elbow.""I'm here."" The words weren't much, to be sure, but the tone was wholly self-possessed, and when the parson whirled around, and Mrs. Henderson, who had been looking the other way, brought her gaze back, they saw a little girl in a dark brown suit, a brown hat under which fell smooth braids of black hair, who was regarding them with a pair of the keenest eyes they had either of them ever seen.Mrs. Henderson was divided in her mind, for an instant, whether to kiss this self-possessed child, as she had fully arranged in her mind beforehand to do, or to let such a ceremony go by. But in a breathing space she had her arms about her, and was drawing her to her breast.Rachel glanced up sharply, heaved a big sigh, and when she lifted her head from Mrs. Henderson's neck, there was something bright that glistened in either eye; she brushed it off before any one could spy it, as the parson was saying:""Let us all go,"" said Mrs. Henderson kindly, gathering Rachel's hand up in one of hers. ""Come, dear."" So off they hurried, the platform's length, the farmers and their wives looking after them with the greatest interest.And before very long, Rachel had been inducted into her room, a pretty little one under the eaves, neat as a pin in blue-and-white chintz covering, around which she had given a swift glance of approval. And now she was down in the parsonage kitchen, in a calico gown and checked apron; her own new brown ribbons having been taken off from her braids, rolled up carefully, and laid in the top drawer, the common, every-day ones taking their places.""Yes, you are, too,"" declared Miss Jerusha, quite pleased at the effect of her words, and telling off each syllable by bringing one set of bony fingers down on the other emphatically; ""in fact, you're a beggar, and my brother----"""
"""There is no one here but those who love you,"" said the minister. ""Now, child, get directly up and sit in that chair."" He indicated the one, and in a minute Rachel was perched on it, with streaming eyes. Peletiah, having started to get a towel, and in his trepidation presenting the dish-rag, the parson dried her tears on his own handkerchief.""Well, I don't believe she will again; let us hope not,"" said Mr. Henderson, in a worried way. ""However, you are not to cry; remember that, Rachel, whatever happens,"" he added firmly: ""you are to be happy here; this is your home, and we all love you.""""You do?"" said Rachel, much amazed, looking at them all. ""Oh, well, then, I'll stay."" And slipping down from her chair, she seized Mrs. Henderson's apron. ""What'll I do? Mrs. Fisher told me how to wash dishes. May I do 'em?""But Peletiah and Ezekiel were much too slow to suit Rachel, who got far ahead of them, so she flew to the drawer in the big table where she had seen them get the dish-towels, and, helping herself, she fell to work drying some of the big pile in the drainer in the sink.""Rachel, Rachel!"" said the parson's wife, over by the table. She was getting her material together for baking pies, and she now added gently, ""We don't call each other names, you must remember that, child.""So Peletiah, letting his elbows take care of themselves, picked up his plate and set to work on its surface again; and pretty soon the dishes were all declared done, the pan and mop washed out, and hung up.""Now, boys,"" said Mrs. Henderson, pausing in her work of rolling out the pie crust, ""I think you had better take Rachel down to see Grandma Bascom. I've told her she's coming to-day, and she's quite impatient to see her. And, Rachel, you can tell her about Mrs. Fisher and Polly and the boys. And oh, Rachel, be sure to tell her about Phronsie; she does just love that child so!""So Peletiah went into the buttery and got the pat of butter, and the three started off. The parson stepped away from the doorway into the entry, where he had been silently watching proceedings, and went over to the window.""Oh, dear me!"" exclaimed Rachel, catching her breath. ""Well, let's run."" And before either boy knew what was going to happen, she was hauling them along at such a mad pace as they had never before in all their lives indulged in.Rachel looked at him, and put up both hands. The only thing proper to do under such circumstances was to shake him smartly, but it seemed so like attacking a granite post, and besides, he was the minister's son, and she was going to be good, else they must send her away (so Mrs. Fisher had said), so her arms flopped down to her side, and hung there dismally. And she burst out:"
"She seized a hand of each boy, Ezekiel being a silent spectator all the time; and if they went fast before, this time, in retracing their steps, it might be called flying, till a little spot on the roadside grass showed the object of their search. Peletiah's breath was gone entirely by this time, and he sank down by its side without a word, his brother following suit.The way back was conducted on slower lines, as Rachel had an anxious oversight lest the butter-pat should again be taken off on the wind, so that Peletiah and Ezekiel had a chance to recover their breath, with some degree of composure, by the time they turned down the lane to Grandma Bascom's. There she was, sitting in her big chintz-covered chair, resting after the morning's work, as they found on entering the little old kitchen.""Oh, dear me! you said so,"" cried Rachel, in a high, disappointed key. ""Oh, dear, dear, dear! I wish she was."" And, terribly afraid she was going to cry, she marched off to the little-paned window, and twisted her fingers into knots.""Who is this?"" she asked, staring at the strange little girl, for although the parson's wife had told her all about the new member of the family to come that day, Grandma was so bewildered by being suddenly aroused from her sleep, she had forgotten all about it. ""Hey, who is it?""""Oh, dear me! You get away, Peletiah,"" commanded Rachel, brushing him aside. So Peletiah, very glad to be released, moved off, and Rachel, putting her mouth to the nodding cap-border, said very distinctly:""Oh, my land o' Goshen!"" exclaimed Grandma Bascom, lifting both hands in delight. ""Why, I can hear you splendid. You see, I'm only a grain deaf. An' so you're that little gal. Well, I'm glad you've come, you pretty creeter, you!"" And in another minute Rachel was telling all about Mrs. Fisher and Polly and Phronsie--oh, and Joel and David--for Grandma kept interrupting and asking all sorts of questions, so that the news and messages were all tangled up together.""Oh, yes, he said yours were awful good, and he wished he had some of 'em,"" Rachel answered. She didn't dare take her mouth away from the cap-frill, and her feet ached dreadfully from standing still so long. But Grandma was as bright as a button, and hungry for every scrap of information.""Land o' Goshen!"" mourned Grandma, ""how I wish he was comin' in now! an' I'd give him plenty."" She sat still for a minute, lost in thought. Peletiah and Ezekiel had wandered off outside, where they sat under the lilac bushes, to rest after their unwonted exercise, so the hens, undisturbed, stepped over the sill of the kitchen door, and scratched and picked about to their hearts' content."
"So Rachel, wishing the duty could be an hour long, shooed and waved her broom wildly, and ran and raced, and the fat old hens tumbled over each other to get away. And then she came slowly back to Grandma's side, to go over again every bit she had told before. Until, looking up at the old clock on the shelf, she saw that it was one minute of twelve o'clock.""There, see what that new girl has done already,"" said Miss Jerusha sternly, laying down her knife and fork. ""Peletiah and Ezekiel ain't ever late. Well, you'll see trouble enough with her, or I'll miss my guess.""And then Mr. Henderson told such a funny story about a monkey he had read about only just that very morning, that Ezekiel forgot there ever was such a thing as tired legs, and even Peletiah had no thoughts for that dreadful run home from Grandma Bascom's.As for Rachel, all idea of dinner flew at once out of her head. She laid down her knife and fork and leaned forward with sparkling eyes, to catch every word. Seeing which, Mrs. Henderson burst out laughing.""I ain't a-goin' to laugh,"" declared Miss Jerusha, ""and it's a wicked, sinful shame to set such an example before those boys, like coddlin' up that girl for keepin' them off playin'. I never see such goin's on!""The idea of Miss Jerusha ever having played, made Rachel turn in her chair and regard her fixedly. Then she broke out into a laugh; it was such a merry peal that presently the boys joined in, and even the parson and his wife had hard work to keep their faces straight.""So I see,"" said his father gravely. ""Well, now we're all getting on very well,"" he added, in great satisfaction, with a glance around the table. ""Good-bye; you must excuse me, wife; you know I must get over to the funeral early.""""I do."" Rachel bobbed her black head at him across the table, and her eyes roved excitedly. ""I've seen lots an' lots of 'em in the city. They're fine, I tell you."" She laid down her knife and fork again and waved her arms. ""Oh, a string of carriages as long--an' the corpse is sometimes in a white box, and heaps of flowers. I like 'em next to the circus.""""There, there, Rachel, eat your dinner, child,"" broke in Mrs. Henderson quickly. ""And, boys, don't talk any more. You must get through dinner, for I have to go to Miss Bedlow's by two o'clock,"" and she got out of her chair and began to clear the table.So all that was to be heard now in the parsonage kitchen was the pleasant rattle of knives and forks, and the bustle of clearing up, and presently the children hopped out of their chairs and began to help Mrs. Henderson to set everything in order.""Can you, dear?"" asked the parson's wife. She was very tired, and yet had the funeral of the old parishioner to attend. But the risk seemed great of allowing the new little girl to do up all the dinner dishes. ""There are a great many of them, and some of them are big""--glancing doubtfully around the piles. ""Are you sure you can manage them?"""
"""So remember; and when you are through, and the kitchen is set up neatly, you may all play out of doors this afternoon, for lessons don't begin for you until to-morrow, Rachel. And now be good children.""""Yes. Oh, my, what fun! Let's hurry."" And before the boys quite knew how, the dishes were all piled in the pantry, the dishpan and mop washed out and hung up to dry, and the crumbs swept from the kitchen floor.""All right,"" said Rachel, seeing she was not to lose sight of the parade she so dearly loved. ""Whoopity--la!"" She flung herself down on the long, flat doorstone, and whipped her gown neatly away on either side. ""I'm goin' to sit in the middle.""""Well, let me think,"" said Rachel, reflecting; ""you see, I've seen so many. Hmm! Oh, I know!"" She jumped so suddenly that she came near precipitating Ezekiel, who was leaning forward to attain a better view of her face, off into the middle of the peony bed.""Well, then, I'll say it. Came back and sit down; I'll say it. Saw, saw, saw. There, now""--as Peletiah, very much delighted, settled back into his place. ""Well, you know this was a great big-bug who was buried, and----""""Well, so he was,"" declared Rachel, turning around to him. ""Some men are big-bugs, an' some men are only little mean ones. But this one I'm tellin' you about was, oh, an awful big one,"" and she spread her arms with a generous sweep to indicate his importance.A small, black, high-topped wagon went by, the old horse at a jog trot, and after it came a two-seated rockaway, and after that a carryall, and around the curve in the road appeared more vehicles of the same patterns, tapering off to a line of chaises and gigs.This was so much worse than he had imagined, as any possible effect from his words, that Peletiah couldn't speak, but stood over her in silent misery. Seeing this, Ezekiel took matters into his own hands.""They're all hearing you,"" observed Peletiah, who, seeing Rachel upon her feet, found his spirits reviving, and he pointed to the line of buggies and chaises. ""See 'em looking back; my father won't like it.""""Oh, oh, what a story!"" exclaimed Ezekiel, who was just on the point of reproving his brother for contradicting, and he pointed his brown finger at her. ""That's got Miss Bedlow in, and they're taking her to the burying-ground, and it's her funeral."""
"""Well, I don't want to go back to the city,"" said Rachel hastily, dismissing Miss Bedlow and her funeral and all discussion thereon summarily, and she dug the toe of her shoe into the gravel; ""don't let your mother send me back.""""Oh, dear, dear!"" Rachel dropped Peletiah's arm, and she hid her face in her hands. ""Don't make me go back,"" she wailed. ""It's too dreadful there, for Mrs. Fisher won't have me if you send me away, 'n' Gran 'll get hold of me somehow--she'll--she'll find me, I know she will,"" and she shivered all over.""Her Gran beat her."" Peletiah went over to his brother. ""She beat Rachel."" He kept repeating it, over and over; meanwhile Ezekiel moved about in confusion, digging the toes of his shoes into the gravel to hide it.""Yes, I'm goin' to learn,"" exclaimed Rachel, in a glad little shout, and, springing to her feet, she swung her arms over her head. ""I'm goin' to read an' I'm goin' to write, an' then I can write a letter to my Phronsie.""And when the parson and his wife got home from Miss Bedlow's funeral, they found the three children there, perfectly absorbed in the labor of sailing boats of cabbage leaves, and guiding their uncertain craft in and out the shimmering pools and down through the tiny rapids. And they watched them unobserved.But on the morrow--well, the minister came out of his study when the lesson hour was over, with a flush on his face that betokened pleasure as well as hard work. And Rachel began to skip around for very joy. She was really to be a little student, Mr. Henderson had said. Not that Rachel really knew what that meant exactly, but the master was pleased, and that was enough, and all of a sudden, when she was putting up some dishes in the keeping-room closet, she began to sing.""Why, my child!"" she exclaimed, then stopped, but Rachel didn't hear her, and sang on. It was a wild little thing that she had heard from the hand organs and the people singing it in the streets of the big city.Miss Parrott stepped into the apartment in stately fashion, her black silk gown crackling pleasantly as she walked, and seated herself very primly, as befitted her ancestry and bringing-up, in one of the stiff, high-backed chairs. And presently the parson, his garden clothes off and his best coat on, came in hurriedly to know his honored parishioner's bidding.""I will come to the point at once,"" said Miss Parrott, with dignified precision, as he sat beside her, and she drew herself up stiffer yet, in the pleasing confidence that what she was about to say would strike both of her hearers as the most proper thing to do. ""You have taken this little girl, I hear, to educate and bring up.""""Very true, for a period of time,"" said Miss Parrott throwing her black-figured lace veil, worn by her mother before her, away from her face. ""Well, now, Pastor, it is not appropriate for you to do this work, with your hands already overburdened. Neither should you bear the expense----""""But I don't,"" cried Parson Henderson, guilty now of interrupting. ""Mr. King pays me, and well, for teaching the little girl until she will be ready for the district school. You see, she has never been in a schoolroom in her life, and it would be cruel to put her with children of her own age, when she is so ignorant. But she is singularly bright, and I have the greatest hopes of her, madam, for she is far above and beyond most children in many ways."""
"""No doubt, Pastor, but I must say what is on my mind. It is that I have for some time wanted to do a bit of charity like this, and Providence now seems to point the way for it. I would like to take the child and do for her. Let her come to you here, for lessons, but let me bring her up in my house.""""Dear Miss Parrott,"" said Mrs. Henderson, and she so far forgot her fear of the stately, reserved parishioner as to lay her hand on the black-mitted one of the visitor, ""we were given the care of the child by Mr. King, who rescued her from her terrible surroundings, and we couldn't possibly surrender this charge to another. But I will tell you what we might do, husband,"" and her eyes sought his face. ""Rachel might go down now and then to spend the day with Miss Parrott. Oh, your beautiful house!"" she broke off like a child in her enthusiasm. ""I do so want her to be in it sometimes."" She turned suddenly to the visitor.And Rachel, in the keeping-room closet, was trilling up and down some of the jigs her feet had kept time to when she, with the other tenement-house children, had run out to dance on the corner when the organ man came round, all unconscious of what was going on in the study.""This is the first time she has tried it,"" said the parson, who had no ear for music and was sorely tried when expected to admire any specimens of it. ""But I dare say she will do very well. She is a very teachable child.""With which enigmatical expression, she mounted her ancestral carriage; the solemn coachman, who had served considerably more than a generation in the family, gathered up the reins, and the coach rumbled off. ""Joel--where are you?"" Frick Mason raced in, to encounter Polly in the wide hall. ""Oh, dear me!""--not pausing for an answer--""all the boys are waiting for him outside. Please tell him to hurry, Polly,"" for Joel's friends always felt if they could only get Polly on their side, they were sure of success, and he shifted his feet in impatience.""I don't know in the least where Joel is,"" said Polly, pausing in her run through the hall. She had promised Alexia to be over at her house at nine o'clock, and there it was, the big clock in the corner stated plainly, five minutes of that hour. ""Oh, dear me! I wish I could help you,"" and she wrinkled up her brows in distress.""Oh, yes, you can find him,"" said Frick, sniffling dreadfully, and beginning to wheedle and beg. ""Do, Polly."" He seized her gown. ""The boys can't do anything without Joel, and they've sent me for him.""""And I'm sure I can't do anything""--Polly shook her gown free--""so there's no use in asking me to stand here and talk about it, Frick Mason. And just look at that clock--two minutes of nine."" She pointed tragically up to the big clock. ""And I promised to be at Alexia's--"" The last words came back to him as she disappeared out to the veranda and down the steps, racing off as hard as she could."
"""Oh, you're here."" Frick seized him on both sides, wishing he had twice the number of hands to employ; then he tried to run in, but Joel shook off the grasp, pushed to the door, only leaving the scantiest space to allow of conversation.Frick slid down to the floor and laid his mouth alongside the crack, with the feeling that his message would be more impressive delivered in that way, since he was not to be admitted to the apartment to give it in due form.""The boys want you, Joel; they're all waiting for us outside. Hurry up."" Having delivered it, Frick got up to his feet in a hurry, confident that the door would be flung wide, to let Joel come hopping out in delight, and not choosing to be run over in the process.""What did you say?"" Frick slid to the floor again and beat his hands on the polished surface. ""Say, Joel, we want you to come. We're all waiting for you, don't you understand?"" He kept saying it over and over, under the impression that if he only repeated it enough, the door would open.""Well, you stop it this minute,"" commanded Jane, waving her broom over the two figures, for by this time Frick had managed to roll over and was now putting up quite a vigorous little fight in his own defense.""Oh, dear me!"" cried Jane, bringing her broom down smartly on as much of the surface of either boy as was possible. ""I'll scream for Mrs. Fisher if you don't stop, you two boys. I will, as true as anything!""""Oh, no, you mustn't, Jane,"" said Joel. His brown fists wavered in the air and described several circles before they fell at his side; seeing which, Frick slipped out from underneath him and began to belabor Joel to his heart's content. ""You mustn't, Jane,"" howled Joel.""Yes, I will, too, Master Joel,"" declared Jane, twitching away the string; ""for such carryings on, I never see. Oh, here's Mr. King; now he'll take care of you both,"" and she skipped upstairs, broom and all.""So I was,"" cried Joel, stung to the quick; and jumping to his feet, he fairly beat the old gentleman's arm with two distressed little palms, ""and he made me come out. I said I would pound him, and I had to. Oh, Grandpapa, I had to,"" and he pranced wildly around the tall, stately figure.""Keep quiet, Joe,"" said the old gentleman, with a restraining hand; ""and, Frick, get up. Oh, dear me!""--as Frick obeyed, bringing his interesting countenance to view, by no means improved by his efforts to wipe off the smears. ""What have you boys been about?""""And is that the way you respond to your invitations, my boy?"" said Grandpapa, with a grim smile. ""I shouldn't think you'd receive many at this rate. So you fell upon him because he asked you to go somewhere, eh?""--with a keen glance into the black eyes."
"""Well, now, Frick, I really believe you better go out and tell those boys that when Joel gets ready to join them, he'll make his appearance. Good-bye, Frick."" Grandpapa waved him off sociably, and Frick, not exactly understanding how, or why, found himself on the other side of the big front door, in the midst of the waiting company from which he had been picked out as messenger.""I wouldn't make such a promise again, if I were you, Joel,"" observed old Mr. King, gathering up the small, brown hand in one of his own; ""it might be a little awkward to keep it, you know. Now, then, here we are,""--turning in at the writing-room. ""Well, say no more, but fly at your task,"" and he seated himself in the big chair before the writing-table and took up his pen.Thus left to himself, Joel went slowly over to the set of shelves in the alcove, from which Frick's summons at the door had called him. There were several volumes on the floor, and a blank book and some sheets of paper, showing clearly Joe's favorite method of setting to work on making lists, while sprawled on the carpet with all his paraphernalia around him. He threw himself down amongst it all, prowled around for his pencil, which, suddenly dropped when he had deserted his task, had taken the opportunity to roll off by itself. Now it added to his discomfiture by hiding.""Oh, yes. Well, now, I mustn't hinder you from your work""--old Mr. King turned briskly to his writing again--""or I shall be as bad as Frick--eh, Joel?"" and he laughed gayly. ""Now trot back and go at your task again.""So Joel, fortified with his pencil, marched back to sit on the floor in the alcove and take up his interrupted work, and Grandpapa's pen went scratching busily over the paper, and nothing else was heard except the buzzing of a big fly outside the window, venting his vexation at his inability to get in.""Phoo! he couldn't make that in his grandfather's writing-room,"" said Larry, in derision, yet he looked anxious. Suppose Joel Pepper were really busy over such a splendid thing as that and hadn't told him. ""Guess something else.""""I can't think what it is,"" said Frick, sitting down on the curbstone to become lost in thought--an example to be speedily followed by all the boys, till finally there was a dismal row of them, without a thought remaining of having the expedition on the pond, since Joel Pepper wouldn't come with them.""It's no use,"" she cried, throwing down the little brush with which she was whisking off the dainty bureau-cover. The girls were ""setting up"" the various adornments that were plentifully strewn about, an occupation that Polly dearly loved, and that Alexia as dearly hated. ""I must go home.""""Why, Polly Pepper!"" she exclaimed, in an injured tone. One eye was draped by a cobweb, gained by diving into the closet's extreme corner after a missing slipper, gone for some weeks; and in other ways Alexia's face presented a very unprepossessing appearance. ""You said you'd help me with my room this morning.""""Bother the boys!"" exclaimed Alexia, interrupting. ""Is that all? They are everlastingly wanting to find Joel. Well""--with a sigh of relief--""we can go back to work again. Why, I must say, Polly, you scared me 'most to death. Oh, dear me! I wish I had let Norah sweep this old closet when she does the room. It's dirty as can be. If Aunt knew it--"" The rest of it was lost, as Alexia was down on her knees again, her head back in the closet, with the hope of unearthing more slippers and shoes."
"""Misery me!"" cried Alexia, scuffling out backward from the closet, the blue silk waist on her head where it had fallen, and in her sudden exit nearly overthrowing Polly Pepper. ""Here comes Aunt. Shut the door, Polly--shut it""--scrambling with both hands to get the waist off, while a hook caught in her light, fluffy hair. And Miss Rhys being too near the door for any such protection as Alexia suggested, in she walked.""I won't be still,"" cried Alexia, casting up a pale eye full of wrath on the side next to Polly, and giving another twitch. ""I guess if you'd been hooked up by a horrible old thing, and your aunt came in and scolded you terribly, you wouldn't wait. Ow! Oh, dear me!""So Polly set to work, Miss Rhys slipping out of the room. Although Alexia's nervous fingers were now not in the way, still, it wasn't easy to disentangle the hook from the thick, fluffy hair, wound in as it was.""No, of course not,"" said Polly; ""at least not until I get this hook out of your hair. There--oh, dear me! I thought it was quite free. Well, anyway, now it is!"" She held up the blue silk waist with a triumphant little flourish, over her own head. ""It must be awful to have something fastened to you like that,"" she said, sympathetically, as she placed the waist on the bed with a sigh of relief.""Well, I guess you'd think so,"" assented Alexia decidedly; ""it's too perfectly awful for anything. It pulls like a big vulture with his talons holding your hair."" She hopped to her feet and shook herself in delight, her long, light braids flying out gayly. ""Well, I am glad that Aunt has gone""--looking around the room, and drawing a long breath.""I can't help it."" Alexia, for the want of something better to do, ran over and twitched the table cover straight. ""And I know she's my aunt, but she needn't pick at me all the time,"" she added defiantly. She looked uncomfortable all the same, and ran about here and there trying to get things in their places, but knocking down more than were tidied up. ""Why don't you say something?"" she cried impatiently, whirling around.""Oh, dear me!"" Alexia sent her long arms out with a despairing gesture. ""I suppose I've just got to go and tell Aunt I'm sorry."" She drew a long breath. ""But I hadn't been playing; I was tired to death over that dirty old closet and that tiresome shoe bag, and my hair all hooked up. Well, do come on."" She ran over and held out her hand. ""Come with me,"" she begged."
"""How is she going to hear with the door shut, pray tell?"" cried Alexia, with a giggle. ""Well, it's over with now. Let's fly at this horrid old room. Dear me!""--as she ran by the window--""do just see those dreadful boys.""""Well, you haven't any right to abuse him, just because he doesn't want to go out with you on the pond,"" said Alexia warmly, veering round at the first word of blame of Joel from anybody else. ""That's a great way to do, I must say.""""Oh, he would, he would,"" said Polly, clasping her hands tightly together, the color flying over her cheek. ""Something must have happened to keep him back""--as the boys, having nothing more to say, moved off. ""Alexia, now I _must_ go home, for I'm afraid--"" of what, she didn't say.""There isn't anything the matter with him,"" shouted back Frick, over his shoulder, who had caught Polly's last words. ""And he could have gone as easy as not; he was in Mr. King's writing-room with the door locked.""""Grandpapa's writing-room, with the door locked!"" repeated Polly, turning around in a puzzled way. ""Why--I don't see--oh!"" Then she gave such a squeal that Alexia hopped across the road in astonishment. ""I know now. Dear, splendid, old Joel! Boys!"" She was up by them again, and talking so fast that nobody understood for a moment or two what the whole thing was about.""Don't you understand? Oh, how stupid I've been not to think of it before!--though I didn't know he was to begin this very morning,"" cried Polly, hurrying on, all in a glow. ""Grandpapa has engaged Joel to do some work for him on his books""--Polly didn't think she ought to explain any further about the ten-dollar note--""and so Joel thought he couldn't stop till the hour was up, and----""""Yes,"" said Polly, turning her rosy face on him, so glad that she was really making them see that Joel couldn't go with them when he was asked, ""he must work a whole hour at a time on them, so you see he really had to stay back."" But this part was lost on the whole group. But the boys didn't get back after Joel--not just then. A big tallyho coach, in swinging around a corner, bore down upon the struggling crowd, the driver halloing and the horn blowing lustily, by way of a signal to clear the road. This would have been all well enough and easy to avoid, if a string of bicyclists had not selected that very identical moment to appear from the opposite direction. And Larry, whose uncle was in the last-mentioned procession, having a laudable desire to see him and make his relation aware of the fact, turned, waved his cap and his arms with a, ""Hi, there, Uncle Jack!"" and in another second was under the big wheels, the whole merry party going over him and the laughter and chat still filling the air."
"Half a dozen men were on the ground with him, and the boys swarmed around wildly, getting in everybody's way. The bicyclists, not catching the idea of any accident, were swiftly coasting down the hill, for after all their leader had suddenly changed his mind and veered off just before reaching the scene of the accident.But Miss Mary continued to say, ""Help me down,"" and she so evidently displayed the intention of getting down without any assistance if it weren't forthcoming, that Mr. Dyce did as he was bidden, and she was on the spot by the time that Larry was drawn out from under the wheels and laid on the roadside grass.""You needn't think to save me,"" she said, with a little gasp: ""I'm--I'm quite strong. I must go. Oh, don't stop me. Think of poor Mrs. Keep!"" and she was back in among the group of men and the frantic boys. ""Send for Doctor Fisher,"" she cried, kneeling down by Larry's side.Little Porter Knapp could, there was no doubt of that. All arms and legs was he, and able to get over more ground a minute than any other boy of their set, not excepting Joel Pepper. So, before Mr. Dyce had finished speaking, he was off like a shot, leaving Miss Taylor sitting on the grass holding Larry's poor head, while the whole crowd of men revolved around her, nervous to do something, but not seeing their way clear to find out what would be expedient.""It's pretty hard on the kids,"" remarked the friend, with a glance over his shoulder at Frick and the rest of the boys, who added to the misery by crowding up to the scene and impeding the progress of all would-be helpers.""Oh, Mac's not to blame,"" said the first speaker hastily, ""but it's an awful calamity just the same, to run down a kid. Well, we must pacify the ladies."" So the two walked back and up to the side of the coach, when the big hats under the parasols leaned over and allowed their fair owners to be diverted with all sorts of comforting things. And presently little Doctor Fisher came rushing along in his gig, out of which sprang Porter Knapp before the horse could be persuaded to stop.""What is it?"" Larry tried to move, and felt a strong hand laid on him just where it made any motion impossible. Beside, a great wave of pain swept him suddenly into such astonishment as well as suffering that all he could do was to shut his eyes and let his head sink back.""Now, then!"" Doctor Fisher glanced up to the coach-load. ""All of you get down,"" he said curtly, and before the women quite knew how, the pretty gowns and hats and parasols were all descending, a gay, fluttering bevy all chattering together.""Miss Mary, I'll trouble you to hop up there,"" and a dozen hands helped her into position on the coach. ""Now, then, Mr. Dyce, and you""; he nodded over to Harry Delafield, the little doctor did, then rapidly picked out two more men. ""Up with you, please,"" and quicker than it takes to tell it all, they were in position, and Larry had been lifted gently into their laps, his head on Miss Taylor's arm.""Ugh!"" Betty Cameron gave a worse shiver than before. ""How Mary Taylor can!"" she exclaimed, with a grimace. ""Oh, dear me! I'm as faint as I can be, just to think of it. I should die outright to be up there with him."""
"""Well, we've got to walk home, I suppose,"" observed one of the other girls disconsolately, who, now that Larry could really speak, thought it quite time to turn attention to her own discomfort, and she thrust out her dainty shoe.The boys, when they saw that Larry was really alive, stopped howling, especially as each and all had felt the glare of the eyes back of Doctor Fisher's big spectacles. And they set off on a run by the side of the coach, and as far ahead of that vehicle as possible, as Mac handled the ribbons with his best style, trying to drive as gently as possible for the patient.""She's here,"" cried Porter suddenly. He had heard the words, but something had abruptly come in between, and he wildly dashed at the little doctor. Doctor Fisher turned around and saw, flourishing up to the gateway, a gay little runabout, and in it Larry's mother and sister.""Yes,"" said Mrs. Keep, ""he is, but then I suppose he has a good deal on his mind. You know they say his practice is getting to be tremendous. Well, we must run in and see him,"" as they drove down to the stable. ""And you can go afterward to see Mary Taylor.""""And I'm sure if ever an hour was long, this last one has been,"" the old gentleman was saying to himself. Joel, who was rather stiff in the joints when first getting up from his work on the carpet, now came out feeling his arms, and then indulging in a good long stretch.""Take care,"" warned the old gentleman; ""those long arms of yours will have things off from my table. My goodness, Joe! you must really go out of doors and stretch, you make such a sweep,"" and he laughed again.""I can reach so far."" Joel ran all around the table and stretched out his brown arms. ""See, Grandpapa,"" he cried; then he got on his tiptoes and leaned over to achieve greater and more astonishing results.""You'll be over on your nose, if I don't rescue you and the things on my table,"" said Mr. King, bursting into a heartier laugh than ever. ""Come on, Joey, my boy, let's get out of doors, in a larger place."" So he gathered up one of the sprawling sets of fingers, and summarily marched him out.Old Mr. King, left alone, nodded to himself two or three times, and smiled in a pleased way. ""The very thing,"" he said at last, and in as great satisfaction as if he had been talking to a good listener. Joel rushed along at a breakneck pace to make up for lost time. How good it was to sniff the fresh air, and to be free, and then to think of that hour put into solid work over the book-list! Why, he glowed all over with delight at the very thought.There was no response as Joel dashed into what the boys called their camp, a rough enclosure the wealthy men who owned the pond on the outskirts of the town had allowed to be built. As some of the boys were their own sons, every indulgence in the way of using the pond had been granted, and Mr. Horatio King being the largest owner and the most indulgent, Joel's set, to a boy, decided to call it the ""King Camp."" It was in a knot of pines, and in the summer was a most attractive place, overrun with vines and creepers and gay with the colored boat-cushions that were always thrown about.""Hey there!"" shouted Joel again, running about within and without the little wooden structure. ""Are you all deaf? Hey--whoopity-la!"" but nobody answered, save a little bird from the tip of the tallest tree."
"Joel stood transfixed with amazement; then he dashed off suddenly down a descent to the little cove. ""It must be that they are out on the pond,"" he said to himself, in vexation, and he craned his neck and peered up and down the shining water as well as he was able for the many curves. ""But I don't see how they can be, for Larry's boat is here""--he had dashed up again to the camp--""and Mr. Hersey's, that's the one they would take""--surveying the collection of rowboats and dories drawn up on the beach--""and Webb's father's and Porter Knapp's."" Besides, there was a goodly number of others, all in such situations as by no means suggested a party expected to be on the pond at short notice that morning.""Well, I'm going out, anyway,"" declared Joel, snapping his fingers, ""and catch up with them. Most likely they've taken the fishing-tackle; I won't stop for that."" So, pushing off his row-boat, he picked up the oars and headed down the pond in the direction most likely in his mind to overtake them.But although he pulled lustily at his oars and ran his boat in and out the curves and hallooed and shouted, he didn't catch a glimpse of them; and the pine groves and wooded glens that ran down to the curving bank only echoed his own calls, or sent a bird note out to him. There wasn't the first suggestion of a boy anywhere about.""Where in the world are they?"" cried Joel in vexation, resting on his oars. ""Hi--there they are!"" He turned suddenly, knocked against one of the oars, it slipped, and before he knew what it was about, there it was in the water. And to make matters worse, the sound that had filled him with delight proved to be a big, black dog, scrambling through a thicket of underbrush, and coming out to stare at him from the edge of the pond.""Oh, you beggar!"" exclaimed Joel, not to the dog, but to the oar drifting off quickly. It was an easy thing, however, so he thought, to recover it, and he made no special haste to paddle along as best he might after it. Just at this moment another boat came suddenly in sight around a curve. It didn't hold Joel's friends, but a wholly different set, some city boys who had no rights on the pond. And having stolen their opportunity, and helped themselves to a boat down below, they meant to have as good a time as possible, knowing it would probably be their last. So here was a grand chance, a boy alone in a rowboat, and at their mercy, one of his oars drifting off.The black dog on the bank, who belonged to them and was following, as best he might, their course, danced about and gnashed his teeth in his rage that he couldn't join actively in the excitement, sniffing at the water and drawing back as it lapped his feet.""Now then, look alive,"" cried the one who appeared to be the leader, and the whole crew bent to their oars with a right good will; and grinning all over their faces with the prospect of fun ahead, they made straight for Joel in his boat.Joel drew himself up, his black eyes flashing, and paddled with all his might. But it was no use; his boat went round and round, or zigzagged along, and in a trice the unlucky oar was seized by the triumphant crew, as it was drifting off into some lily pads, and drawn with a worse yell than ever into their boat. Good luck! here would be easy game!""Now then!"" There was no limit to their delight as they saluted Joel in every conceivable way best fitted to get him worked up. ""How are you, snob? Don't you want your oar?"" and such things, every boy contributing at least a few selections to the general hubbub, the black dog on the bank emitting shrill, ear-splitting barks of distress."
"He was drowned in a storm of yells: ""Your granddaddy? Fellows, this baby is talking of his granddaddy,"" and they screamed in derision, snapping their fingers and swinging the oar as high as they could tantalizingly at him.Round and round went Joel's boat, describing a series of curves, that despite all his efforts only carried him away from his tormentors. What he would have done, had he reached them, hadn't entered his head, his only thought being to get up to them. In the midst of this interesting proceeding, a sharp clap of thunder reverberated over their heads, to be almost immediately followed by a piercing gleam of lightning. It produced the greatest consternation in the boat-load, and a sudden jump on the part of nearly every boy in it, made it careen, then turn completely over, and before they were fully aware, every single one was in the water, screaming and struggling wildly.""Don't catch hold of each other,"" he yelled, his mind intent on helping some of them into his boat. But as well talk to the wind. The boys who couldn't swim--and most of them were in that plight--were grabbing this way and that, to seize upon anything that would give them a support.""Catch hold of your boat,"" roared Joel at them. But instead of that, some of them preferred to catch hold of his, the consequence being that it would soon have been upset, had he not screamed at them (and they knew he meant it), ""I'll bang you across the head if you try it""--lifting his oar sturdily.And seeing that this was all they could get, and that Joel was as good as his word, one after another was helped in, the others wisely catching hold of the overturned boat--an example speedily followed, till all were either in Joel's boat and rowing quickly off to shore, or hanging to their own craft.The leader of the crew huddled sheepishly down over his oar, which Joel handed him to do some of the rowing, and he didn't look at the owner of the boat, till, just as they neared the bank, he glanced up suddenly and said:""What do you take me for?"" cried Joel, in extreme disgust, and plying his oar briskly. All this time the rain had come down in torrents, till there wasn't much difference between the boys who had been in the water and the one who had kept out, and the lightning played over their heads in unpleasant zigzag streaks, and the thunder rolled and rumbled.""Well, I would if I was you."" The words came in a burst from a boy supposed to be in such a half-drowned condition that he wouldn't care to take part in any conversation, who was crouched down in the bottom of the boat. ""I'd tell every single thing about it."" He raised himself and shook his fist at the leader's very face. ""If it hadn't been for you, Mike,"" he said, ""we wouldn't have come.""And really Mike didn't look as if he would, for he crouched and cowered lower yet, till Joel began to say, ""Give me the oar,"" for it wabbled so that it played a small part only in getting the craft to the shore.""There you are,"" cried Joel, as they were dumped out, to keep company with the big, black dog, who sniffed them contemptuously and walked around their dripping bodies as they sank on the bank. This wasn't the kind of fun he had meant when he followed his master out, and not at all to his taste.""Shut up."" It was the other boy that roared at him, who, injured arm or not, could somehow inspire the former leader with fear. ""I'm going to tell myself; an' if any of you fellows has got spunk, he'll tell, too."" It was such a battle cry that Mike's head went down. He knew as well as afterward that his leadership was gone, and that every one of the crew had gone over to the other boy.""Hi--yes, we'll tell."" If Jack, their new leader, could decide to, they would follow him, and they yelled it out much better than any one would suppose possible after their fright, turning their backs on Mike."
"""That's good,"" said Joel, bobbing his black curls, from which the rain was streaming, at the whole bunch of boys in approval, and taking up his oars he prepared to move off. ""If you'll only tell about the boat.""""Mr. King's!"" Jack gave a roll over and groveled in the wet moss. ""Oh, it's all up with us, fellows,"" he groaned. The black dog, who belonged to him, came and licked him all over, glaring between whiles at Joel, as if he were the cause of the whole trouble. The bunch of boys said nothing, but shivered in silence.""Well, if I ever!"" It was all that Jack, the leader, could get out. And Joel, seeing there was nothing to wait for, set to work again, and presently amid the rain and the lightning gleams, his boat was only a little speck on the surface of the pond, as viewed by the group of boys on the bank.""Not a word shall you hear until you can control yourself,"" declared Miss Taylor, wresting herself away from the nervous grasp, and running over to the door she closed it. ""Now then, Nell, are you a sensible girl?""--coming back.""Of course I am,"" said Mary. ""Now see here: we are both of us very wrong to give way in this fashion; we ought to be seeing to your mother. Get up, Eleanor,"" and she sprang to her feet. ""There, that's right. Come on.""""The very thing,"" said Mary Taylor; ""we'll get your mother in there""; and with a message back to Mrs. Sterling the two young ladies hurried off, and before Larry's mother quite knew how, she was in the beautiful upper room of the stately brownstone mansion, and face to face with its invalid mistress, condemned for years to lie on her sofa.""I do believe,"" said Mrs. Sterling, putting out a soft hand, ""that everything will be much better than you think. We shall soon have cheering news, I feel quite sure. Gibson, draw up the easy-chair, so--that's right.""""Young ladies,"" said Gibson, coming out softly, ""wouldn't you wish to go down into the drawing-room? Mistress would like to have you make yourselves comfortable. The storm is pretty heavy, and I'll light the gas.""""We like this,"" said Mary Taylor; ""please, Gibson, don't feel troubled."" So Gibson went back to her mistress' room, and Mary put her arm around Eleanor, and patted her hair as she cuddled up to her neck.""And Mrs. Sterling wants them invited in here to wait?"" exclaimed Mary. ""How kind of her! Now, then, Nell, that's work for you and for me: we must help those boys to get a little comfort""--as Gibson went quickly down the long stairs on her errand."
"Eleanor, seeing nothing for it unless she were to be left alone on her stair, which would have been the last thing to be endured, got up and followed slowly, to be met at the big door leading to the side porch by the company of gloomy-faced boys.So they all filed up the long flight, and Gibson held open the door, and Mrs. Sterling from her sofa called out, ""Boys, yon don't know how glad I am to see you all."" And just as they began to feel a little bit of hope down in their hearts, it was so much easier all bearing the suspense together, a light tripping step came up the staircase, and little Doctor Fisher's big spectacles were thrust in the doorway.""Now I must go. I'll look in again on your boy in an hour. Madam""--to Mrs. Keep. ""Meantime, I'd stay over here, for I've sent for a nurse from the hospital; he must be kept quiet a spell. Good-day,"" and he was off.""What--oh, what?"" They crowded up to her sofa. Gibson, from the doorway where she had retreated, to be within call, looked a little anxious, but catching a glance from her mistress, smoothed out her face again.""What is your plan?"" asked Curtis. It really seemed as if the boys had been accustomed to gather in that room, by the way in which they now crowded up as comrades entering into anything that might be proposed.Gibson, in great trepidation at any one performing the office for her mistress, started to do it, but Curtis was already most gallantly, if a trifle awkwardly, pushing up the pillow, giving it a rousing thump that got on the nerves of the maid.""Never mind; that is all right."" Mrs. Sterling smiled up at him where he stood, the hot blood in his face, and his eyes downcast. ""I'm very much obliged to you, Curtis. I guess you are accustomed to do it for your mother,"" she said encouragingly.""Well now, if I were you,"" said Mrs. Sterling, turning on her pillow to get a good look at them all, ""I'd form a committee, a comfort committee, to think up things that will interest Lawrence. And by and by the doctor is going to let you go to see him, and----""""And oceans of magazines."" They all shouted one thing, and another. Gibson, who by this time was tired of popping her head in and out, had withdrawn to a little room opening out of her mistress' apartment, and taken up her sewing, quite convinced that far from its being a cause for alarm, everything was going on finely.Curtis Park was just in his element here, for he dearly loved puzzles and conundrums. And presently Mrs. Sterling and he were busily talking over this and that kind, and book, and collection, until finally the small boy pulled the fringe of her pink crocheted shawl.""Dear me!"" Mrs. Sterling looked up quickly, to give a little laugh. It wasn't loud, but so cheery and sweet that Gibson, in the little outer room, dropped her sewing in her lap. ""Thank the Lord!"" she said, and wiped her eyes."
"Frick, meanwhile, too excited to hear the doctor call them to come back, had darted out of the house, with no thought for the rain, but with one wild desire--to find Joel Pepper. And as he had a perfect faculty for sprinting, and cut through, with a dash, all the cross-streets, he soon found himself for the second time that day at the King mansion.But this second time he was no more fortunate than the first. For although he was willingly admitted to Mr. King's writing-room, it was to see that gentleman look up and say with the most genial of smiles:""Joel hasn't been with us,"" blurted out Frick, Then he leaned against the big writing-table, speech all gone, for he began to feel terribly tired, and it had been nothing but one long disappointment all day.""Oh, no, he hasn't,"" declared Frick, shaking his head dismally; ""we haven't any of us seen him, and Larry Keep has been run over by Mr. MacIlvaine's tallyho, and most smashed up."" Then he stopped suddenly, his cup of woe being empty.""The first thing to do is to find Joel,"" said Mr. King to himself, anxiously. ""The storm is almost over, to be sure""--glancing out of the window--""but where can he be?"" He hurried across the room and touched the electric button. ""You haven't the least idea, Frick, where to look for him, eh?""""Yes, Joel can't be found,"" said old Mr. King, speaking lightly to hide the dismay he really felt. ""It's all right, of course; he's probably at one of the boys' houses; only as he was to join Frick, why, I'd prefer to look him up a bit. Well, there's Thomas""--glancing out of the window.""Yes, yes,"" said his father, ""of course you may come if you like."" So Jasper, well pleased, rushed for his mackintosh, and all three got into the carriage, and Thomas whirled them off in his best style.""It isn't really worth while to worry Mrs. Fisher,"" said old Mr. King when well on the way, ""for we shall probably soon run across Joel as bright as a button, and gay as a lark. Bless me, how this rain comes down!"" But no Joel ""bright as a button and gay as a lark"" came in sight. Instead, at a corner they were turning rapidly, Mr. King in desperation giving the order to drive to one of the boys' houses most likely to attract Joel's attention this morning, Thomas came to an abrupt halt that nearly threw the horses back on their haunches.The boy thus addressed paid not the slightest attention to the irate coachman, but advanced to the carriage door. He seemed to have something the matter with his arm that would evidently have given him a good deal of bother had his mind been on anything but the desire to attract Mr. King's attention.But that gentleman, violently jolted by the sudden pull-up of the horses, not being in the best frame of mind, called out testily, ""Bless me, what is the man stopping for? Drive on, Thomas,"" and looked directly over his head.That functionary, with a very dissatisfied expression that he hadn't been allowed to use his whip when he got it all ready so nicely, now cracked it at the horses. The boy, with one hesitating glance at Jasper, slid off the carriage-step down to the street, and yelled defiantly up into Mr. King's face as the brougham spun off:""Father!"" exclaimed Jasper, with a white face, ""he must know where Joel is. Thomas, _Thomas, stop!_"" For Thomas, having no other way to vent his vexation, took it out in driving as fast as possible, so he didn't hear what was going on in the coach.But the boy, quite willing to tell whatever story there was on his mind when he jumped on the carriage step, was now of a different mind, and he ran like a deer, first down one street then another. At last, finding himself pursued by some one not at all inclined to easily give up the chase, it suddenly dawned on him that his blue cap might possibly be a means of tracing his course. So he twitched it off and tucked it under his well arm. This made it more difficult for Jasper, whose footsteps were fast gaining on him, to follow him accurately, and for the first time a horrible moment came to the pursuer when he thought that after all the boy might escape; but Frick, who had seen Jasper's nimble progress around a corner, ran down a side street, then across a garden, and came plump into the face of the boy."
"""Here he is,"" cried Frick, the breath almost knocked out of him by the encounter. He had grasped whatever he could first lay his fingers on and held to it firmly. It proved to be the arm for which the boy had not appeared to have much use.""No, you don't get away this time,"" said Frick, for the tall boy had him in hand now, and was marching him back to the carriage at a pace much more comfortable for all concerned. ""What have you to tell us?"" he was being asked.""I would have told you then,"" said the boy doggedly. He couldn't help but show some suffering in his face, and Jasper, looking down to see its cause, found one arm hanging in a very peculiar manner. ""You've hurt your arm,"" he said abruptly. ""Frick, take care""--to the boy, not at all particular what he took hold of if he only got a good grip.""How did you hurt your arm?"" asked Jasper. Despite all his anxiety about Joel, and an awful feeling that in some way an accident had occurred that had enveloped them both, he looked into he face beneath him with real concern.""None of your business,"" the boy was going to say, but instead he turned away his face, then brought it back, and defiance was written all over it. ""He sassed me, that old fellow in the carriage. Did you s'pose I'd tell him after that?""""Then, if you do""--Jasper stopped suddenly and brought his keen dark eyes to bear on the rough, defiant face--""I just hope you will tell me. And I know you will,"" he added, after a pause in which Frick fastened his gaze on them both wildly, luckily without discovering any use for his tongue.""But what was he doing out on the pond in such a storm?"" asked Jasper. His lips were white, but he didn't allow his eyes to waver, for it was better to have the whole story before getting back to his father.""Yes,"" said the boy, as if he were going to add, ""Well, what are you going to do about it?"" The next moment, he had made up his mind to tell all there was to tell. It wasn't exactly clear why, but he was giving the account in a very few words, leaving it where it ended with his seeing Joel rowing off down the pond.And presently the two who had hopped out of the carriage, with the new boy and the one who had thrust his head in over the door, were seated in the brougham, and Thomas had turned his back on the city streets and was driving off at a furious pace for Spy Pond.Then out came that story to add to the general misery, and old Mr. King sat very straight and kept saying, ""Bless me! Tell Thomas to drive faster,"" and ""Oh, bless me!"" again, as he glanced over at the boy.But no Joel. They pranced, the horses did, shaking off the rain from their wet manes, around as much of the pond as was adapted to carriages, and Jasper and Frick got out and explored the rest, at least wherever Joel would be supposed to put into port, the boy holding up the arm that appeared not to be in its usual condition and going along, too, yet unable to add any information to his original statement. At last: ""Probably Joel's gone home""--it was all Jasper could do to get the words out of his white lips."
"Jasper threw wide the door. ""_Joe!_"" he cried. Thomas pulled up again, the horses by this time having become so well accustomed to this method of bringing up that they did it quite well, and there was a great to-do in the coach.""Well, it's all out, Joe,"" said Jasper affectionately, who couldn't stop patting his back. Frick flew over to the opposite side and let Joel snuggle up to the old gentleman. ""I'm here, Grandpapa,"" he said happily.""Oh, bless me! Yes, my boy!"" said old Mr. King brokenly, and fondling the little brown hands. ""Well, we must get you home and out of these wet clothes as soon as possible. I don't know what your mother will say. Oh, dear me, Joe!""""You're wet as a drowned rat, Joe,"" declared Jasper, bursting into a laugh, which was such a relief to all concerned that in a minute it really seemed like a pleasure excursion. But Joel pulled himself up.""Never mind; do as I tell you,"" said Jasper, nowise disconcerted. So Frick reported that it did rain; and then Jasper began to talk so fast that Joel had no time to get in a word at all, although he tried with all his might.""See here,"" he shouted at last, and his voice rang clear above every other noise, ""can't we take him to Doctor Fisher's office--can't we, Grandpapa? Make Thomas turn about and take us there""--he fairly howled it now.It was impossible to stop the dreadful news of Larry's accident from coming now. And in a minute Frick had it all out in a burst, quite unconscious of Jasper's efforts, and well pleased at having something important to say.""And where is Alexia?"" And without waiting for an answer, Miss Rhys paced nervously up and down the room, still wringing her hands. ""And of course there will be more; there, there it comes,"" and she ran, the embroidery-piece still hanging to her gown, into the closet.""Well, that's no reason I should be all pinched to death,"" grumbled Alexia, forgetting the thunderstorm in her present discomfort and edging off as well as she could. ""The closet is dreadfully small, Aunt.""""I'm going after Polly."" Alexia out in the middle of the room flung her arm around Polly. ""Oh, misery!--where?"" as a vivid flash seemed to hop right in the window. ""Oh, Polly, come!"" She clutched her wildly."
"""Well, there's just no use in running,"" said Polly, but seeing Alexia's distress she suffered herself to be led, and downstairs the two girls sped, and into the landlady's room, the first door to stand ajar.""It is pretty bad,"" a voice answered. It wasn't Mrs. Cummings, as she had hurried to oversee the maid close the windows through the house, but another of the boarders, who, like Alexia, had selected this apartment for a refuge.""I think so,"" said Mr. Filbert, a little thin old man sitting over in the corner and leaning forward over his cane. He spoke cautiously, as if not quite sure. ""Yes, it _is_ a bad storm,"" he repeated decidedly. ""Where is your aunt?""Alexia dashed down the sofa-cushion with a nervous hand. ""I can't breathe; let's get out, Polly,"" and she flew up, to sit quite straight. ""Yes, my aunt is up in the closet, Mr. Filbert. Whee! Oh, I am so scared, Polly Pepper!""""Oh, dear, dear!"" Alexia began to whimper, feeling all around the floor with terror-stricken fingers. ""Aunt, where are you? Oh, she's been struck and she's dead, I know she is! Polly Pepper,"" she screamed, tumbling out of the closet to rush to the head of the stairs, ""come up and help me find Aunt.""""Alexia!"" Miss Rhys, concluding not to be left alone in the closet when the two girls ran downstairs, had hurried out after them, and now appeared from the hall corner where she had crouched. ""Don't scream so.""""Why, of course not; don't you see I'm here?"" said Miss Rhys. ""There, child, take care, you're mussing my lace collar,"" and she edged off from the nervous fingers. ""We'll go downstairs, I think, and stay with Mrs. Cummings.""""Oh, how fine!"" exclaimed Alexia, hopping after, losing sight of the thunderstorm in the delight of having Polly Pepper to herself for so many hours. ""Oh, Aunt, what's that tagging after you?""--catching sight of the piece of embroidery dangling from her aunt's long figure.""Well, I do,"" said Alexia, bobbing her light hair till the fluffs settled over her forehead, ""for then you'd stay. You haven't been over here in ever and ever so long, Polly Pepper,"" she said, in an injured voice, ""and I've got so very much to talk with you about."""
"""Oh, that was because she knew it was so ugly that no one else would buy it,"" said Alexia composedly. ""Well, I don't care, so long as it's sold. I was just tired to death of that old thing, Polly; I don't want to ever see another shawl.""""Well, it would do them good to be left out sometimes,"" declared Alexia: ""they're so high and mighty, I'd just dearly love to take them down, and say, 'Boys, you can't come into this.'"" She tossed her fluffy hair till the long, light braids flew out triumphantly.""Oh, little biscuits,"" said Polly, going back in her mind to the delights of baking-day in the little brown house; ""cunning little ones, you know; you can't think how perfectly elegant we used to make them, Alexia.""""Oh, you had everything elegant in your little brown house,"" said Alexia, twisting enviously in her corner. ""Joel's never tired of telling of it. And to think I wasn't there! Oh, dear me! I wish you would talk about it.""""And beside, even if they don't make things, why, they can come to our suppers, for we must of course get up some, of things we've learned to make. Oh, it will be _such_ fun, Alexia!"" Polly sighed and clasped her hands.""And I'll learn to make your cunning little biscuits,"" declared Alexia suddenly, quite as if she had proposed the plan and pushed it along from the very beginning, ""and do let's have a club supper soon,"" she begged.Polly burst out into a laugh. ""Just look there,"" She pointed to the patches of light in the sky gradually growing bigger and brighter. ""It doesn't rain a single drop! And, oh, Alexia, look, look--the rainbow!"" But the cooking club with all its delights wasn't started yet for many a day, for just as soon as Polly got home there was the whole story of the morning's adventures of Joel and Larry's accident, to fill all her time and thoughts.And then Jack--why, of course, he must come in for a goodly share of notice, for Joel insisted on making him a hero, to be willing to come and tell Mr. King of his misdemeanor on the pond. And Doctor Fisher had said the arm was in a bad way, the trouble being increased by all the running about in the pelting storm that Jack had indulged in, and this made Joel nearly frantic. Dear me! there was no time to think of cooking clubs!And then after luncheon came a little note from Mrs. Sterling, brought by no less a person than Mrs. Gibson herself, who, in her staid little black bonnet and gray dress and white apron, waited for Polly's answer.""Dear Polly"" (so the note ran), ""will you run down this afternoon to talk over a little plan for the Comfort committee. I suppose the boys have told you about it. Bring Joel, too, for he couldn't come this morning when it was proposed. Your friend, Pamela Sterling.""""I hope you'll be there soon,"" said Mrs. Gibson, the light of pleasure at Polly's first words dying down a bit when she saw that Joel was to be waited for. ""Couldn't you come first?"" she asked anxiously."
"She was already out in the hall, and Mrs. Gibson having obtained the best she was likely to receive, departed to carry back the word to her mistress. And Polly raced here and there without avail, for Joel was not so easily found after all.""Well, you aren't ahead now,"" cried Van in glee, and mounting the stairs, he couldn't resist the temptation to peer over the railing. ""Ha, ha! who's the smart one now? I'll get there first, Percy Whitney.""""What do you want me for?"" repeated Van, begrudging every step of the way he was now taking, and keeping a sharp look out that Percy didn't spring past him. To prevent that, he spread out both arms. ""Say, Polly, what do you want me for?"" At last he was by her side.""Yes,"" said Polly, ""and hush, Van. Now, see here, boys: I've got to find Joel. Mrs. Sterling has sent for him to come with me over there this afternoon, and she wants us right away. Don't you know where he is? I've looked for him just everywhere."" She clasped her hands and looked at them in despair.""Boys,"" said Polly, ""it's just this way; you must help me to find Joel, for, unless you do, I'm sure I don't know what I can do. And Mrs. Sterling was going to tell us all about the Comfort committee to help Larry, you know."" She dropped Van's jacket-end, and ran and sat down on one of the high-backed chairs, and folded her hands in dismay.""Oh, we will--we will,"" cried both the boys, quite overcome at this, and, losing sight of all the charms that were awaiting them in Ben's room, they precipitated themselves upon her. ""But where shall we look for him? You know he went out with Doctor Fisher in his gig. Say where shall we look for him, Polly.""""Well, they might have taken us,"" said Van again. ""I'd like to have seen him awfully, and now Joel will have him all to himself. I'm going to get something, and I won't let Joel have any of it,"" he added vindictively.""Boys""--Polly drew away from Van, and sank down on her chair again--""I shan't have anything to say to either of you when you say such dreadful things,"" and she folded her hands sorrowfully in her lap and looked straight ahead at the opposite wall.Meanwhile, Polly was sorrowfully confessing to Mrs. Sterling why she was late, and explaining all the reason that Joel couldn't accompany her. And the whole story of the morning affair on the pond, as gathered from Jack, for Joel hadn't told a word of the encounter with the crowd of rough boys, had to be gone over with before Mrs. Sterling could open her budget of news and her wonderful plan for the Comfort committee."
"There was a funny little noise over the stairs, as if there were more than one pair of feet, which was soon explained by Joel's bursting in, dragging another boy after him, who had his arm done up in a sling.""I'm very glad to see Jack,"" said Mrs. Sterling, with a smile, putting out her soft, white hand to the boy, who was gazing at the doorway through which he had come, as if nothing would please him so much as to go through it again, this time on the way back.""Well, you see--"" Mrs. Sterling, without more ado, began at once on her plan. Polly was by this time back on her cricket, very much relieved to find that it wasn't so very dreadful after all to have Jack there, since Mrs. Sterling seemed to like it. ""There's nothing helps a boy who is to be shut up in the house for a long time, quite so much as to have the other boys who can go out to play, think of him, and plan for his comfort. Isn't that so?"" Mrs. Sterling looked at her little audience keenly.""Yes,"" said two of them. Jack was so scared at finding himself where he had never supposed he could be--in the stately brownstone mansion--that he fixed his eyes on the carpet, not daring to move; as for speech, it was quite beyond him.""Here are some of them,"" said Mrs. Sterling, ""that I told the boys this morning when they were in here. You might cut out the funny things in the magazines and newspapers, the pictures and the stories, and send him. It's so nice to have little reminders to pass away the time.""""Perhaps that is the very reason it would be well for you to do it,"" said Mrs. Sterling, with a smile. ""At any rate, it would please Lawrence, I think. Well, then there are conundrums; you can surely think up something of that sort that will amuse him, and puzzles.""Sent in to Larry Keep's big house, almost as grand as the one Jack sat in now, by him, a little six-penny grocer's son, doing business over at the South End! He couldn't believe his ears, and to assist them, he lifted his eyes and stared at the person making the announcement. Evidently she meant it, and the more he gazed at her face, the better he liked it. But he didn't dare to stare long, so he concluded to transfer his attention from it to the carpet.""We are getting on so well,"" said Mrs. Sterling, and her tone was very cheery, ""that I am really quite hopeful that Lawrence may be amused by all that we are to do for him. And now, before we go any further in our plan, suppose we take a little comfort ourselves."" And she laughed a gay little laugh that wouldn't have sounded badly as Polly's own. ""Gibson,"" she called.""If you knew, Polly,"" said Mrs. Sterling, with a laugh, ""what a pleasure it is to me, to hear a hungry boy say so up here, you would be very glad to let him. You can't think""--looking around on the three--""what good you are doing me. Really your work as a comfort committee has begun already.""There was an awful pause. A big blue-bottle over in the corner under the rafters was making a final decision to explore the filmy lace web beneath the window where a fat old spider had been patiently waiting for him, and he gave his last buzz of freedom before he hopped in. This was all the sound that broke the silence. Rachel held her breath, and fixed her black eyes at a point straight ahead, positively sure if she withdrew her gaze she would burst out crying."
"""So you will be ready to go at ten o'clock, Rachel, for Miss Parrott will send for you then,"" Mrs. Henderson was saying. And in a minute more the parson's wife was going down the garret stairs; Rachel, with a heart full of woe, slowly following, leaving the big garret to the fat old spider, who was busily weaving her silken threads in glee over her prisoner.And Rachel's woeful face was more than matched by the countenances of the two boys of the parson's family, who were not at all pleased that the companion sent to them by Mrs. Fisher, and who had turned out surprisingly just to their liking, should be suddenly torn away from them even for a single day. And they followed disapprovingly around, hanging upon all the preparations for the momentous visit, with a very bad influence upon Rachel's endeavor to control herself. Seeing which, their mother sent them off on an errand to Grandma Bascom.So, when the ancient carriage, with its well-seasoned coachman who rejoiced in the name of Simmons, made its appearance, there was no one to see Rachel off, save the patron's wife, the minister himself being away on a call lo a sick parishioner.Rachel went steadily down the walk between the box-borders, feeling her heart sink at each step. Mrs. Henderson, well in advance, was down at the roadside to help her in, with a last bit of good advice.""Good-morning, Madam,"" Simmons touched his hat, and spoke with the air of state, for he kept his English ways. Secretly, the parson's wife was always quite impressed by them, and she looked at Rachel for some sign to that effect. But the child was scowling, and biting her thin lips, and she suffered Mrs. Henderson to assist her into the wide old vehicle without any further change of expression. When once in, she gazed around, then leaned forward on the slippery old green leather seat.Simmons starting up the horses, that, although an old pair, yet liked to set off with a flourish, the movement bounced Rachel violently against the back of her seat and knocked her bonnet over her face. This gave her something to think of, and changed her terror to a deep displeasure. When the drive was ended, therefore, and the brougham, after its progress through an avenue of fine old trees, was brought to a standstill before the ancestral mansion where Miss Parrott's father and grandfather had lived before her, the visitor was in no condition to enjoy the pleasures thrust upon her.Miss Parrott, in the stiff, black silk gown that she had worn the day when she called at the parsonage, met her on the big stone steps. She put out a hand in a long, black lace mitt, ""I am very glad to see you, child,"" she said, in old-time hospitality.But no hospitality, old-time or any other, had a pleasant effect on Rachel. She gave a glance up and around the big, gloomy gray, stone house, with a wild thought of rushing down the avenue and home to the parsonage.Miss Parrott started, and gave a little gasp. Then, reflecting it was not in accordance with fine manners to notice any such slip on the part of guests, she led the way into the mansion. Simmons, much shocked, actually forgot himself so far as to scratch his head, as he drove off to the stables, and he didn't get over it all day.""Perhaps you would like a little refreshment,"" suggested Miss Parrott, when, the child's bonnet off, she was seated on the edge of a stiff, high-backed chair. She couldn't think of anything else to say, and as she usually offered it to her friends at the end of their long drives when they called upon her, it seemed a happy thing to do now, especially as Rachel's black eyes were fastened upon her in a manner extremely uncomfortable for the person gazed at.As Rachel didn't know in the least what ""refreshment"" meant, she stared on, without a word. And Miss Parrott, pulling with more vigor than was her wont, a long red worsted cord that hung down by the piano, a stately butler made his appearance quicker than usual, took his directions from his mistress, and after regarding the small figure perched on one of the ancestral Parrott chairs with extreme disfavor, he silently withdrew.Presently, in he came, his head well thrown back, and bearing a huge silver tray. On it were a decanter, two little queer-shaped glasses, and a plate of very thin seed cakes. He deposited this on a spindle-legged table, which he drew up in front of his mistress, and, with another glance, which he intended to be very withering, cast upon Rachel, but which she didn't see at all, he departed.""Now, my dear,"" said Miss Parrott, in a lighter tone, feeling quite in her element while serving refreshments in such an elegant way, ""you must be very hungry."" She poured out a glassful from the decanter, and getting out of her chair, she took up the plate of seed cakes, and advanced to the small figure. ""Here, child."""
"""It smells just like Gran,"" Rachel was repeating, with flashing eyes. ""Oh, how dare you give it to me!"" She was standing over the wreck of the priceless china and glass, which, as no such accidents had been recorded in the family, Miss Parrott had continued to use in the entertainment of her guests.""You may leave the apartment, Hooper,"" said Miss Parrott, regaining some of her dignity by a mighty effort. ""I'm not in the least afraid."" But her looks belied her words, or at any rate the old serving-man thought so, and he made bold to remonstrate again.""Oh, no, no!"" protested Miss Parrott, coming rapidly to her self-composure; ""that would never do in all the world. Leave the room, Hooper."" This last was said so exactly like his mistress at her best, that the butler obeyed it, making a wide circuit as he passed Rachel, who still stood, the picture of wrath, over the broken china and glass.Not a word was said for some minutes. Outside, Polly, the old parrot, was scolding vociferously, and the tall clock was ticking away for clear life. Hooper, his ear first, and then his eye, glued to the keyhole, was vainly endeavoring to find out what was passing in the sitting-room.No matter that she broke those beautiful things! The whole truth flashed upon Rachel, and although the smell of the hated stuff was even yet dragging back to her all the memory of her low condition of life through such childhood as she had known, over and above it all was quickly rising the conviction that for this unpardonable misdemeanor she would be sent back to the city and--awful thought!--perhaps to Gran. She set her teeth together hard, and clenched her thin hands as they hung by her side.""Yes. I say it is no matter,"" repeated Miss Parrott, not suffering herself to glance at the wreck of her ancestral treasures, ""but oh, child! why did you say such dreadful things?"" She still clung to the cabinet, shocked out of one tradition of her family, as if she must still hold to its time-worn and honored furnishings.""Never!"" said Miss Parrott firmly. All the blood in her body seemed to be in her wrinkled face, and her eyes shone, as had those of her father, the old judge, when befriending some poor unfortunate. ""You shall never go back, child; don't be afraid.""But Rachel still shivered. There were the broken bits of china and glass on the floor back of her, and the minister and his wife must be told of the awful accident; and what they would do with her, why, of course, no one could tell.The thin, wrinkled fingers on which blazed many rings, that had been her mother's before her, were tremblingly smoothing Rachel's neatly braided hair. And as if she thought what was passing beneath them, Miss Parrott broke out quickly:""Of course not,"" declared Miss Parrott, in scorn. ""So do not be afraid any longer, but get up and dry your eyes."" For at this announcement, Rachel's tears had gushed out, and she sobbed as if her heart would break."
"For answer Rachel flew to her feet, and without any warning and astonishing herself equally with the recipient, she threw her arms around Miss Parrott's thin neck, in among all the ancient laces with which she delighted to adorn it, and hugged it convulsively.Taken unawares, Miss Parrott could utter no word, and Rachel clung to her and sobbed. But the old ears had heard what hadn't been sounded in them for many a long day, and forgotten were wasted heirlooms and broken treasures.What should she do now to divert this little girl from her terror and distress? She was sorely put to it for the answer. She gathered up the nervous hands in one of her own, and led the way out into the wide hall, hung with ancestral portraits. ""I am going to take you to my own room,"" she said suddenly.Rachel didn't know the wonderful condescension of this plan for her amusement, but she clung to the long, thin fingers, and presently she was seated on a cricket covered with tambour work, and watching Miss Parrott's movements about the spacious apartment.""Move your cricket over here, child."" Miss Parrott was unlocking what looked to Rachel's eyes like a big cupboard that stood out from the wall. It had little panes of glass all criss-crossed with strips of white wood across its face, and a set of drawers beneath. And as Rachel obediently carried the cricket over and set it down where Miss Parrott indicated, her chief attention was still upon this curious cupboard, and what Miss Parrott was doing in it, for the door now stood open.Rachel leaned forward on her cricket and rested her hands on her knees. On the shelves was such an array of articles, that to the child's gaze, nothing stood out distinctly as an object to lavish one's sole attention upon. But Miss Parrott made early choice, and lifting out a big doll from one of the lower shelves, she laid it in Rachel's lap.Rachel looked down upon the doll in her lap. It was long and hard and angular as to body, and its face was a dull white, except some patches of pink on the outer edge of the cheeks, showing the rest of the coloring to have been worn away. Its eyes were staring up into Rachel's in such an expressionless, unpleasant manner that she involuntarily turned away her own.""Now I don't suppose you know how much I loved this doll,"" said Miss Parrott, turning her back on the cupboard, to draw up a chair opposite Rachel and seat herself upon it, ""but I used to take her to bed with me nights.""""Well, Priscilla was always pretty to me,"" said Miss Parrott, astonished that she felt so little the slight to her child. ""Well, now, Rachel, we will put the doll aside. You may lay it on the bed and then come back here.""""My, what a funny bed!"" she exclaimed, using her eyes to their utmost to see as much of the canopy, with its tester of blue and white chintz, the four posts beneath, and the counterpane executed in honeycomb pattern.Miss Parrott, exploring her cupboard to get out something else with which to entertain Rachel, did not hear her; so she slowly returned, walking backward to observe as much of this queer article of furniture as the time allowed. In this way she fell over the cricket.""Oh, no,"" said Miss Parrott reassuringly, ""the cricket is not harmed. See here, Rachel""--she held in her hand a long string of little irregular things that dangled as she turned toward her--""I am going to put these on your neck. Now stand still, child."" And suiting the action to the words, something snapped with a little click under Rachel's chin."
"""Red coral beads,"" said Miss Parrott, smiling at the nice contrast between the necklace and the dark little face above. ""Now, child, you are going to wear them whenever you come to visit me and as long as you stay. And that means they will not come off till to-morrow, for you are to sleep here to-night.""""I must go and get it,"" said Rachel wildly, and, dashing blindly off, she left Miss Parrott standing in front of her ancestral cupboard holding her childish treasures, to rush over the long and winding back stairs. At their end she found herself hopelessly entangled in an array of back passages and little old-fashioned apartments, from which, run as she would, she could never seem to find the right exit.Her progress was noted with indignation and contempt by as many of the old retainers in the Parrott service as could be gathered at short notice, and their calls to her to leave the premises, accompanied by sundry shakings of a long crash towel in the hands of the cook, only impeded Rachel's hope of success.""Well, 'tisn't here,"" said an angry voice, and the brandishing of a big, iron spoon made Rachel beat a hasty retreat, this time into the back hall. Miss Parrott was just descending the stairs, her stiff, black silk skirt held high, before she set foot in the servants' quarters.""Ah--well, then, we'll go out this way."" And there, turning to the left, was the passage down which Rachel had plunged twice before, and at its end, a small green door, that, when opened, led out through an arbor overrun with creepers, to a short cut to the stables.""Now, then!"" Miss Parrott gathered up the train of her black silk gown and put it over her arm; then in full view of the latticed window of the kitchen and scullery department, she sallied forth across the greensward to the stables beyond, Rachel's brown hand tucked in her own.""You're a ninny!"" cried the cook, turning on her in disdain; ""go back to your pots and kettles, Ann. Whatever would she have to do with the Mistress's beads? It's some old string you see around her neck.""""It tell you it's Miss Parrott's red beads!"" declared Ann stoutly. She might be sent back to her work among the pots and kettles, but she would stick fast to her tale. ""I seen 'em when I went up to Miss Parrott's room with the bellows I'd cleaned this very morning, through the little winders to her cupboard, an' I'd know 'em anywhere.""""Now jump in,"" said Miss Parrott, but this command was not needed, for Rachel was already within the family coach and prowling around on the old green leather cushion and over the floor with both nervous hands.Miss Parrott leaned against the brougham, and broke the seal. Rachel, her whole heart in one glad thrill of joy, made little sign except to heave a deep sigh of relief that the note had been found. Simmons, seeing no excuse for lingering further, went back to one of the carriages to go through the form of inspecting its exterior, while he still kept an eye employed in the direction of his mistress.""Dear Miss Parrott"" (so the note ran), ""I really do not think it is wise to ask Rachel to remain over night. I will explain later. Another time, perhaps she may do so. Yours respectfully, Almira Henderson.""""Dear me!"" exclaimed Miss Parrott to herself, and, folding up the little note into many creases, she stood lost in thought. ""Well, I suppose I must yield to the parson's wife, for she has some good reason. But the child shall stay next time."""
"Rachel, whose spirits had risen, since it was quite positive that the note was not lost, now seized Miss Parrott's hand and hopped and skipped by her side across the green grass on their return to the mansion. Simmons came out of his retirement, his chamois skin with which he had been ostensibly polishing up a carriage, still in his hand, to stand in the doorway to watch them.""Well, just one peep,"" she said, ""for it is near to luncheon time,"" and she pulled out the watch from her belt. But to Rachel ""a peep"" meant all the world, so she dropped the fingers and raced through the gateway, to get there first and thus make it last as long as possible.""Oh, oh!"" she cried, her little dark face aflame with delight, ""it's the most beautiful place."" Then she began to run up and down all the narrow paths marking the circles and hearts and diamonds in which the old-fashioned garden was laid out, and sniffing the fragrance as she ran.Miss Parrott seated herself on a stone seat by the fountain in the center. Her delight was quite equal to Rachel's, and the thin, wrinkled face assumed a more peaceful expression than it had carried for many a day, so that when Hooper came to summon her to luncheon, he was fairly taken aback at its unwonted cheer.""Rachel!"" Miss Parrott's voice had a pleasant ring to it. Rachel came dancing along a little curving path, the red coral beads flying up and down on her breast, her cheeks nearly as red. ""Oh, it's perfectly beautiful here,"" she cried.""Do you like it?"" Miss Parrott's thin cheek glowed, too. It carried her back to the day when she as a child had been skipping in that old garden, and her heart gave a throb at the thought that there were perhaps in store for her many delights yet, through Rachel's enjoyment of the old-fashioned flowers and shrubs.As Rachel knew nothing whatever about system, she followed silently, her small head full of the beautiful garden in which she had been rioting, and which--oh, joy!--Miss Parrott promised she should visit again, when the luncheon was over. And seated at the polished mahogany table, she was so lost in thought that Miss Parrott, in state at the other end, was obliged to speak to her twice before she looked up.Rachel hadn't even begun it, and she now seized the first thing upon which her hand rested, a heavy silver fork. Hooper, back of his mistress's chair, darted forward to put the right implement before her. But Rachel gave him a withering glance that stopped him half-way. ""You don't need to come. I've got it""; and she held up her spoon triumphantly, and ever after, all through the meal, she seemed to view his necessary advances as so many affronts, intended to show up her lack of manners, and she exercised all her wits to keep him at bay. So that the old butler was glad when the meal was over.But long before that time arrived, Rachel had leaned back in her tall, carved chair, letting her knife and fork rest on her plate, while she feasted her eyes over the table, what it held, and then around the whole apartment.""There's some of the same flowers like the ones in the garden,"" she said, bringing her gaze back to point to the old-fashioned silver vase and its nodding clusters in the center of the table. ""What are they?""""And what's the other, this side?"" Rachel bobbed over on her chair, till Hooper involuntarily closed his eyes, expecting she would go entirely off from her chair, and he didn't want to see it, it would be so disgraceful at a Parrott table.""_Ragged robin!_"" repeated Rachel, hopping off from her chair. ""Oh, I want to see it,"" and she ran around the table-end, and leaned over to get a better view. ""'Tisn't a bit ragged,"" she cried, very much disappointed, ""and besides, he isn't there."""
"Rachel, thus admonished, scuttled back to her seat, while Hooper groaned and pretended not to see anything. But she kept her black eyes fastened on the ragged robins. ""There isn't any bird there,"" she said.""I don't want any more milk,"" said Rachel, waving him off with quite an air. ""I've got lots and lots""--peering into her cup. She took up her knife and fork again, but, looking over them, found so many things to call for more attention than they seemed to be worthy of, that she soon laid them down again upon her plate.""And you must eat something,"" continued Miss Parrott, glancing at the little girl's plate, and with dreadful qualms at her old heart for having been severe. ""If you don't, Rachel, Mrs. Henderson won't let you come here again.""Rachel by this time was alive to the disgrace she was undergoing, and she turned quite pale, and deserting her food altogether, sat stiff and straight on her chair, too miserable to care for anything. Miss Parrott bore this for a breathing-space, and then without a warning she slipped off from her chair and went quickly down to the end of the table.""Oh, that is nothing,"" began Miss Parrott; then she stopped suddenly and put both hands on the thin little shoulders. ""Oh, child,"" she said brokenly, ""I did so hope you'd like me, for I've nothing in this world to live for, Rachel, and now you want to go back to the parsonage.""""Oh, I don't want to go back--I do love you!"" cried Rachel, in great alarm, and she raised her little brown hands and actually smoothed the long, wrinkled face between them. ""Don't look so, you look dreadful,"" she pleaded.For at the touch of those childish hands over her face, Miss Parrott broke utterly down, all her aristocratic traditions falling away in a second of time, to reveal her lonely, hopeless life. And she sobbed in a way very hard for any onlooker to hear. To Rachel, powerless to stop her, it seemed the most terrible thing in all this world, and she burst out in her misery:That word ""forever"" did what nothing else could have achieved. It brought Miss Parrott to herself. Then it was Rachel who led her about the old-fashioned garden, and chattered about the flowers, unmindful whether or no she was answered, until presently Miss Parrott was quite recovered, and even smiling in a well-pleased way. At last she pulled out her ancient watch from her belt.""I'll sing,"" she said, ""all you want me to. I know lots and lots of things""--until the grand piano in the long, dim drawing-room, not opened for many years, was reached. Then she spun down the middle of the apartment. ""I'm going to dance first,"" she announced, picking out the skirt of her gown on either side. ""My, but ain't it dark, here, though!""Then she did a thing she could not remember doing in all her life, she deliberately went on with her employment, allowing Simmons to wait on his carriage box, while she broke up the system of years that always made her punctual to a minute.""Yes,"" said Miss Parrott, sitting very straight, and giving all the graceful little quirks to the slender fingers which her music-master, long since dead and buried, had taught her. ""Now begin, child."""
"So up and down, high and clear, rang Rachel's voice, with no more effort than the birds outside put forth, the sound penetrating the ancient walls, and paralyzing every domestic, while it nearly made Simmons, outside, fall from his box.""Oh, I can't dance,"" said Rachel, ""when you play so funnily. It doesn't go like that; it goes so."" She picked up her gown again, and made a sweep off in one direction, and then in another, her feet scarcely touching the pictured roses and lilies with which the velvet carpet was strewn, all the while singing a tune that seemed to carry her off on its own melody. Miss Parrott turned around on the music-stool, and watched her breathlessly.It was therefore much later than the parsonage people expected when the old brougham set Rachel down at their gate, and she walked into the house, supported on either side by Peletiah and Ezekiel, who had been watching there a full hour for her arrival.But it wasn't to stay, that Rachel went back on the morrow; it was only for a day. Despite all the pleadings made by Miss Parrott, and all the desire of the parson and his wife to please their honored parishioner, and most of all, the earnest wish to consent to what would probably be for the child's best good, they held firmly to the first statement, that nothing could be arranged till Mrs. Fisher and Mr. King had been consulted.So letters had to fly back and forth from the parsonage and the King estate in the big city, and Miss Parrott wrote long letters in a pinched, lady-like hand in very faint ink, crossing the paper whenever she was afraid she hadn't said enough to plead her cause successfully. Which condition of mind she was in perpetually, all through these writing days. These letters old Mr. King endeavored to read at the first, but he soon threw them down impatiently.Then Polly or Jasper would hurry in and wade through the missives. And when he saw the hungry longing of the desolate soul, and the sweet refinement of the writer came out, and the sterling honesty was revealed in the prim sentences, he relented and went tumultuously over to the other side.""Yes, yes, she shall go,"" he declared, pulling out his big handkerchief to blow his nose violently, to remove all suspicion that anything was the matter with his eyes; ""'twould be the best thing in the world for her. Of course she must go.""And so it was finally settled that Rachel was to live at Miss Parrott's and be her own little girl, going down to the parsonage every day to learn her lessons under Mr. Henderson's care, until the time when she would be ready to be sent to such a school as Miss Parrott might select should arrive.The Comfort committee being well-established and in fine running order by this time, Mrs. Sterling gathering them around her sofa, in her spacious sitting-room upstairs, Polly and Alexia saw no reason why they shouldn't begin work on the Cooking Club, ""because,"" said Polly, ""if we are really going to learn how to cook things, why, we ought to begin."" And the mothers of the several boys and girls who were to form it, taking instantly to the idea, the two girls and Jasper set to work to write the notices of the first meeting.""Well, I'm sure boys are such nuisances,"" said Alexia, leaning her long arms on the table (they were in the library at Mr. King's), ""and besides they won't want to come to our Cooking Club, I verily believe, so what's the use of having them on the Committee?""""Well, I declare,"" cried Alexia, looking up admiringly from a receipt book which Mrs. Fisher had loaned them, and over which the heads of the two girls were bent, ""if you boys haven't been quick, though!""""I'm going to write the notice to him,"" declared Alexia, dipping her pen in the ink-well and beginning with a flourish. But she threw it down before she had finished his first name. ""Polly, you ought to write the first notice,"" she cried; ""you proposed the Club.""""Oh, clear! we haven't a pattern of the notice made yet,"" said Polly, leaning back in her chair, after the labor of getting the first envelope addressed; and she pushed up the little brown rings of hair from her brow, for Polly didn't like very well to write, and it always took her some time to achieve anything in that line. ""Jasper, you draw up one, do,"" she begged.But Picketing protesting that he didn't know any more how to write such a notice than Prince lying on the rug before the fire, Jasper in despair drew up a sheet of paper, and wrote in big staring letters and with a great flourish, clear across the top of the page:""Well, it does,"" said Alexia; ""you know for yourself, Polly, she always stands up quite stiff on the platform and says, 'Attention, young ladies!' Oh, I quite hate the word, because we all have to look at her.""""Well, you needn't be,"" retorted Alexia; ""she's very fond of me, Miss Salisbury is, and I don't in the least know what she'd do if I left her school. But I never shall go away, for I just dote on her."""
"""Wait till I write a good one,"" said Jasper, beginning on a fresh sheet of paper. ""I was hurrying so to get it all down; you can hardly read it."" So he wrote it out in his best hand, then propped the notice up against the book-rack. ""Now begin,"" he said.""Well, don't let's talk,"" said Alexia, seeing that she couldn't have any part in the conversation since all her mind had to go into her task. ""Oh, dear me! I left out the dot to my 'i,' and misery! there's a blot! It was all because I was listening to you, Pickering Dodge.""""You may try,"" said Polly, pushing the paper toward her, when she saw Alexia's face, ""but it's no matter anyway, I'll write another."" And she had already begun it when Alexia threw down the ink-eraser.Pickering said nothing; he didn't really believe the ten-dollar bill would ever be found, having helped Jasper to ransack so many possible and impossible places, but he wasn't going to say so, and thus add to the general gloom.""Well, I don't see how he can,"" said Alexia, drawing a long breath. ""Dear me, it would just tire me to death. Why, Polly Pepper!"" Alexia threw clown her pen and stared at her. ""When is the first meeting to be?""""I suppose I might have known if I'd stopped to consider that you've talked your Parish boy every day since the little affair on the pond,"" said Mr. King, still laughing. ""Well, and so Mrs. Sterling has invited your friend, Joel, to some festivity, I suppose, eh?""""Yes,"" said Joel, ""she has""--his satisfaction returning--""it's a supper at her house, to-morrow night, Grandpapa."" He leaned over to bring his brown cheek close to the one under the white hair. ""Just think of that!""""Well, she's going to have us, every single one in the Comfort committee,"" declared Joel decidedly, ""and she asked Jack, most particularly; she did, Grandpapa--she really did. May I go down and tell him now? May I, Grandpapa?"" he cried eagerly.Instead of complying with this demand, the old gentleman leaned back in his chair and steadily gazed into space while he revolved something in his mind. At last, when Joel thought he couldn't brook the delay another minute, Mr. King whirled suddenly around in his chair.""Right away now,"" declared old Mr. King, getting out of his chair; ""that is, as soon as we can make ourselves presentable for our walk. Goodness me, Joe, what a whirlwind you are!""--bursting into another laugh."
"Joel didn't care what he was called so long as he was really going to see Jack Parish and carry him the wonderful invitation, and all the way down to the little grocer's on Common Street he just bubbled over with happiness, till everybody who passed the two felt a glow at the heart at the merry comrades: and many were the backward glances cast at the old, white-haired gentleman of stately mien, with a chubby-faced boy of the jolliest appearance hanging to his hand.""Well, well, well, and so here we are."" Old Mr. King looked up curiously at the little sign above the door--""Ichabod Parish, Grocer""--then down over the shop windows overrunning with canned goods, and, to finish up, an outside stall on which jostled and overcrowded each other every description of vegetable in the market, from a cabbage down. A fat, red-faced man with a big apron that had been white earlier in the day, came out of the shop and stood by the stall.""Well, yes,"" said old Mr. King, with a twinkle in his eye, for by this time he perceived some lines along the fat cheeks that showed very plainly the habit of smiles running up and down in them. ""I've come for a boy, if you please.""""Oh, no, I'm not,"" said old Mr. King very seriously, but the other man had been just as observing in his way, and had seen the twinkle in the keen eyes. So now he laughed some more and waited patiently for the joke to be explained.Old Mr. King was rapidly exclaiming: ""No, no; bless you, did you think I'd come at you in such a way? Why, this boy here""--thrusting Joel forward--""has got an invitation for him. Now, then Joel, my boy, speak up.""And Joel did speak up; and in a minute they were all there in the little shop, and the fat grocer was bustling around to work a chair out from behind the counter. But as the big store cat and several parcels were on it, it took a bit of time. Meanwhile, old Mr. King sat down upon a box of soap, while Joel hung over his shoulder.A woman came in with a jug to be filled with molasses, and a small girl for a box of matches. But the little grocer told them to wait, and after he had placed the chair and gotten Mr. King off from the soap-box and into it, he bustled to a door at the head of the shop.""Jack's to home,"" announced the grocer, coming back with the air of imparting a piece of news, just as much as if every word had not been heard. ""Well, now, Mis. Jones, I'll fill your jug."" He took it from her and she settled herself comfortably, during the slow process, to watch the stately, white-haired figure in the chair to her heart's content; her example being followed by the small girl who had, of course, been obliged to wait for the box of matches.So Jack, free from his sling, for Doctor Fisher had found him surprisingly quick at recovery, bolted through the doorway, and into the shop, and without a bit of warning brought up against old Mr. Horatio King and Joel.""It doesn't look much like it,"" said the old gentleman, bursting into a laugh. The fat grocer over at the molasses barrel, looked across anxiously at the group, and for once in his life wished Mrs. Jones, although one of his best customers, anywhere but in his shop.""Well, try again, Joel,"" said Mr. King. So Joel began once more, and before long, Jack Parish understood fairly that Mrs. Sterling had actually invited him to supper on the following night with the Comfort committee, just as if he were not the son of Ichabod Parish, the little grocer on Common Street, but were one of the rich boys of Joel Pepper's set.When he comprehended the matter, as after an infinite deal of pains he did, his astonishment knew no bounds. It absolutely struck him speechless, and there he stood in the middle of the little shop, lost to the fact that he was a small grocer on an obscure street. He was the father of Jack, hitherto obliged to go with boys of the neighborhood, not of specially nice families, with manners and aims to match, now--oh, joy!--with a chance for something better, that might reach to unknown heights. He might even become an alderman! The little grocer's breast heaved with delight, but even in that blissful moment, his first thought was of his wife."
"And Jack springing to help his father, who bounded to the molasses barrel, old Mr. King and Joel took themselves off without any further embarrassment to the little grocer, who surely never could in all this world express his gratitude as he wanted to.Jack Parish, with his hair carefully oiled by his anxious mother, and his very best clothes on, a circumstance calculated to invest him with dread and rob him of every bit of comfort to begin with, presented himself at Mr. King's mansion on the next afternoon. His countenance was long, and he looked so worried that Joel, rushing out to meet him, involuntarily ejaculated, ""Oh, dear me!"" in dismay.""That's good!"" exclaimed Joel, with shining eyes, and clapping him on the back; ""we'll have a bout together sometime. And here are my boxing-gloves."" He seized them and struck an attitude. ""Come on, Jack,"" he cried in huge delight.So Jack did come on, and when he emerged, why, there were the fencing foils to try; and when this was all over, and both boys sat down, flushed and panting, why, Jack's best Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes and his oiled hair didn't look so badly, to Joel's way of thinking.It didn't take Jack long to be over in front of the cabinet, and pulling out its many drawers. So that he was lost to all the fuss of dressing that Joel and David were undergoing, and it wasn't till he had been clapped on the back most vigorously with a, ""Wake up, old chap,"" that he realized that the dreaded time had arrived when he must go out to his first company. Then a dreadful feeling came over him.""Come along, you,"" he cried, hauling Jack away from the cabinet and hurrying him off downstairs. Then he began to chatter as hard as he could, saying the first things that came into his head, until the gray stone mansion was reached, and they were fast and safe within the door.Joel glanced around in dismay, then pranced out into the hall. A scuffling noise struck upon his ear, and leaning over the banister, he saw David and Jack apparently hanging on to each other and whirling around in the hall below. He was down over the stairs in a flash.Jack looked thoroughly ashamed, but he still cast wild eyes at the big front door, as Joel considering whatever was to be done at all, should be done quickly, launched him upstairs, and before he had a moment to breathe freely, pushed him into the beautiful sitting-room above with a, ""Here he is.""The room swam all around before Jack, as he went up to the sofa-edge, and Mrs. Sterling's soft, white hand took his hot, nervous one. He didn't know in the least what she said, or how she looked, as he couldn't raise his eyes, but he remembered afterward that her voice was sweet and low, and that somehow he wasn't so afraid after that, and then Joel dragged him into a knot of boys, for by this time several were pouring into the room. And in five minutes Jack felt as if he had known them all for years, and he quite forgot that this was the first time he had ever gone into company.So Gibson went over and touched the electric button on the wall, and in came the butler and two maids bearing trays full--well, just crowded with all the good things a boy could desire to eat. And these having been placed on the big, mahogany table in the center of the room, usually filled with books and magazines, but which had been cleared for the purpose, each boy was invited to come up and be helped to whatever he wanted, an invitation that wasn't long left unaccepted.Joel, in his fear that Jack would somehow be left out in the cold, bent all his energies toward getting him something to eat. The consequence was, that he forgot all about waiting on Mrs. Sterling, and, glancing around after he had poked a plate of cold chicken and jelly into Jack's hand, he saw two or three of the boys--Frick and even little Porter Knapp--vying with each other to be the first to serve their hostess.""Thank you, Joel; I shall want it pretty soon,"" said Mrs. Sterling, smiling into his red face. ""There, we'll put it on the table""--for Mrs. Gibson had been busy drawing up a light stand to the side of the sofa--""and will you bring me some cold chicken?""So Joel, with a mind to edge up to see how Jack was getting on, found to his amazement that he was laughing and talking with the last boy with whom he would have supposed it to be possible--Curtis Park!""I couldn't help it,"" said Davie, who had been quite miserable since his ill success in getting Jack over the stairs after Joel. He was aimlessly crumbling up a biscuit on his plate, and eating nothing."
"Joel, left alone, was feeling very dismal, when suddenly he looked over, and caught Jack's eye. Curtis Park was saying something very jolly--Joel knew it was, for he caught scraps of it, and so did some of the other boys who pushed up to hear the rest. But Jack Parish evidently didn't listen, for his eye had been anxiously roving around the room, and just at that moment, they rested on Joel, and they lighted up so unmistakably that Joel sprang forward, a light in his own.So the circle of chairs and crickets was made around the sofa, and the real business of the evening began. It was in the very commencement of things Joel noticed that every one of the members seemed to take a fancy to Jack.Jack, not knowing how to refuse, took it. And the other boys, seeing Curtis Park come down from his high-flown notions enough to notice so conspicuously the new boy, all began to find ever so many things in him that were worthy of, their attention. So, instead of Joel having to push him along, Jack became quite popular. The result was that Joel was left out in the cold.""Now,"" said Mrs. Sterling brightly, after a little of this chat had been going on, and Gibson had shaken up her pillows, and raised her mistress into a more comfortable position, ""you all know, of course, that Doctor Fisher reports Lawrence ready for a little amusement, if we send it to him, for no one is allowed yet to see him.""""I don't doubt it,"" said Mrs. Sterling, smiling at him, ""but until that good time does come, why we who belong to the Comfort committee ought to set to work on something that will cheer him up. And as I believe work of that kind always gets along better when ever so many club together at it, why, I thought I'd ask you all to meet here, and we'd see what could be done this evening. Now what shall we do first?""""Two things to choose from,"" and Mrs. Sterling laughed. Her spirits were rising now, and all the doubts she was beginning to feel overwhelming her as to the wisdom of inviting these boys in for the evening, fled at once.""I think puzzles are just as horrid as conundrums,"" said Joel Pepper, beginning already to feel the prickles run up and down his legs, from sitting still so long, and wishing for nothing so much as a good scamper; ""they're both as horrid as they can be.""""I very much wish you would, Jack,"" said Mrs. Sterling. And she looked at him in such a way, that Jack although he had wild thoughts of taking a flying leap out of his chair, and off to the small grocery shop, nevertheless stuck to it manfully and at last found his tongue.Frick wriggled in his chair; he wanted his puzzles dreadfully, and he couldn't see, since he had proposed them first, why he shouldn't carry the day, but every boy was looking at him sharply, so he mumbled, ""Yes.""""Well, now, Jack, you've fixed it cleverly,"" said Mrs. Sterling, much relieved. ""Get your pencils all ready while Gibson goes into my bedroom and brings out the pile of magazines, and we'll have such a lovely evening of work. You know you must each select pictures, and each write a puzzle, and each give a conundrum; then they must be read aloud and we will choose the very best ones to send. Now then ""--as Gibson deposited her armful of magazines on the little stand, and laid several pairs of scissors on the top of the pile--""let us all set about it.""Boom, boom, clang, clang, clang! It was the fire-bell, loud and clear and strong. Down went all the scissors, and a whole litter of papers to the floor, and the magazines sprawled every way, as each boy sprang out of his chair.The other boys, just on the edge of saying the same thing, now stood quite still. Every nerve was quivering to be off to the fire, which, from all appearances, must be a splendid one. The bells were clanging fast and furiously, hoarse cries were heard, as if raised from hundreds of throats, and now, to add to the general melee, an engine dashed around the corner. They could hear the mad plunge of the horses, the shouts of the people; and then off in the distance, yet approaching nearer each instant, was another and evidently a more powerful one, the horses at a mad gallop. It was too much for any boy to stand."
"Jack Parish's head spun, and he clenched his hands. Why had he come to this sick woman's house! If he were only out in the free, open air, he'd go in a flash. His father let him run to fires, and it wouldn't be many minutes before he'd be in the thick of it. He'd make a break and run!But how white she looked as she laid her head on the pillow. Like it or not, there he was in her house, an invited guest; and she'd been so kind to him and sent him the first invitation he'd ever had. He opened his hard fists and closed them tighter than ever. Curtis Park was now at the head of the stairs. Having decided, he was bolting off. Little Porter Knapp was engaged in kicking Gibson, who was detaining him by the end of his jacket, and screaming wrathfully and slapping her hands. The other boys, most of them making up their minds to follow Curtis, were watching proceedings.Curtis Park was dreadfully proud of his manners, and he would have stopped there, but as it again occurred to him that this was the son of a grocer who was setting up to be an authority, he cried angrily:""I wish I'd stopped him,"" said Jack to himself. ""Hello, here's the whole mob""--as all the boys except Joel and David, and of course Porter, now plunged out to do the same thing. ""No, you don't."" He squared up in front of the staircase. ""Not one of you goes down there.""And in five minutes Hamilton Dyce set forth, with Mrs. Sterling's complete approval; a string of boys in his wake, including little Porter, who was parted from Gibson only on her hearing her mistress say, ""Yes, indeed, he can go; but do look out for him.""""Do you know""--Mrs. Sterling took her arm and pulled her gently down to a level with the face on the pillow, and her soft eyes twinkled--""it really seems good to see such a muss for once in my life: you do keep me so immaculately fine, Gibson.""""No, I shan't,"" protested Mrs. Sterling, her eyes beaming, and going on resolutely, ""and just to think of boys being here!""--she looked around the room with a sudden affection--""and liking it--for they did, Gibson, they surely did, until the fire started. Oh, it is perfectly beautiful!""""Don't say so,"" cried Mrs. Sterling laughingly, ""and I will be good,"" and she settled back comfortably into her accustomed place. ""Yes, Gibson, I have my young folks now, the same as other people,"" she added proudly. ""You needn't try to fix up the room yet; you may finish the story you were reading to me last night.""She had to turn her face on the pillow, for the smile would come, at the picture of Gibson, the immaculate, sitting down calmly in the midst of the awful effects of the tumult that had so vexed her soul.She had her young people, there was no manner of doubt after that. And though the exit from their evening's excitement was not again made to the clang of the fire-bell, all the subsequent visits held fun and jollity, and quiet enjoyment, and everything else that was delightful, mixed up together.And the Comfort committee had so much pleasure out of the whole thing, that one evening little Porter looked up from his laborious pasting, whereby a joke from a funny paper was going down for the sick boy's amusement."
"""Well, we must think of somebody else to help with our Comfort committee,"" said Mrs. Sterling from her sofa. ""Don't worry, Porter, we won't let ourselves die out for want of work. Boys--"" She looked at them suddenly, and raised herself on her elbow, Gibson over in her watchful corner trotting across in great apprehension.""Then I'm going to make things,"" declared Joel, who never in his life before had been willing to sit still and cut out and snip and paste and write, and he plunged back to his seat. ""Oh!"" he cried, in dismay, and his face grew terribly red, ""did I upset that?""--pointing to the mucilage bottle.""You surely did,"" said Gibson tartly, and taking up the last of the sticky mess with a wet towel, ""and I suppose you'll do it again, or some of the rest of you boys will. It don't make much difference which,"" and she moved off slowly.Curtis Park had been through several spasms of distress over his attack on Jack, when, whirling around from the friendly attitude he had chosen to assume, he had made a tirade on the grocer's son. Look at it whichever way he might, it didn't seem pleasant to view. And all the delight in the fire and the companionship of Mr. Dyce, of whom all the boys were exceedingly fond, was suddenly blotted out. He went home that night, and crept into bed, a most disconsolate boy.""I was a beastly cad,"" he fumed, kicking the covering down to the foot, and rolling out with the vain attempt to find some diversion. But that being impossible, he tumbled in again, with his unhappy thoughts.And all through the following days, go whichever way he might, there was the fact to stare him in the face, that he, Curtis Park, who had hitherto prided himself upon his fine manners, had dropped from his height, to blackguard a boy, who, despite the fact of having been born the son of a little grocer on Common Street, had yet shown himself capable of the height.There was only one way, and he knew it, just as well at first as after all the fencing with himself that ensued the next few days. And at last on this very evening, he stopped fighting the idea, and marched up to what it suggested, like a man.""Oh, it's no use to deny, Jack,"" said Curtis, speaking rapidly and desperately, ""that I've been a cad--a mean, low cad--to talk to you in that way. It's done, and can't be helped now, only I want you to know what I think of it.""""And you will never have another chance to call me a cad, I promise you,"" declared Curtis, wringing it. ""Come on now, Jack""--hooking him by the arm--""it's time to go to Mrs. Sterling's; this is the evening, you know.""And the boys who had begun to think they had made a mistake in supposing that Curtis Park had taken a fancy to Jack Parish, were pushed back into their first conviction by seeing them come into the meeting of the Comfort committee arm in arm. Polly Pepper ran down the steps of Miss Taylor's house, and set off at a lively pace on the pavement. Presently she came to an abrupt stop. ""Oh, how could I forget, Mamsie wouldn't like me to run in the street,"" she thought remorsefully. And this took away some of the glad little thrills running over her.""Oh, dear me!"" exclaimed Polly, quite gone in distress over the failure of the candy, and feeling very helpless in the fact that there was no one to tell her news to, for of course Alexia must be the first one to hear it. ""Which way did she go, Miss Rhys?""--lifting a troubled face to the window above."
"""So you would,"" assented Alexia's aunt, wondering whether the bunch of grapes should be filled in solid, or worked with the mixed stitch that she had seen in a shop. ""Well, then, I think on her way back she was going to see you, Polly.""""Yes,"" said Miss Rhys, turning back with a sigh of relief to her embroidery again, while Polly hurried off, wishing that she was a boy, when it would be quite proper for her to run through the streets.""Oh, if it were only Badgertown!"" she sighed to herself, thinking of the many happy runs she had enjoyed down the lane to Grandma Bascom's cottage, or over across the fields to the parsonage. ""Dear me!""--when a voice, ""Polly Pepper, Pol--ly Pepper!"" called after her. She looked back, and there, with the window screen up, and her face thrust well forward, was Alexia's aunt, loudly summoning her.When she saw that Polly heard, and had turned back, she beckoned smartly with her long fingers, on which shone, as Alexia had once said, ""all the rings the Rhys family had ever owned,"" drew in her head, and waited till Polly came up under the window again.""Yes, Miss Rhys,"" said Polly, with a dismayed remembrance just how far it was to the little shop where the very latest patterns and materials for fancy work could be obtained, and the first supper of the Cooking Club to be given to-night!She crept off on very dismal feet, till she reflected it wouldn't help matters any to lose heart, and so she set forward at a brisk pace again. Miss Rhys pushed down the window screen and set to work with a complacent smile at the prospect of having her errand performed so nicely.Polly went the whole length of North Street to the great establishment of Pennsey's, where the avenue people traded. But search as she might, up one aisle and down another, there was no trace of Alexia; and inquiring of a clerk at the sugar department, if she had been there, he whipped his pencil out from behind his ear, and picked up his order pad before he stopped to think.Polly hurried on rapid feet. It was half-past three by the big central clock as she went down the main aisle--well, she must hurry home, for Alexia was probably on her way there, as Miss Rhys had said, when, ""Dear me, Polly Pepper, wait!"" struck her ear.""Yes, I know,"" said Polly, coming up close to comfort as much as possible, for Alexia had a very long face on, and looked as if it would take a good deal to cheer her up. ""How can I tell her about that dreadful green floss and those patterns?"" said Polly over and over to herself. ""I must wait till we get out on the street.""But when the two girls were outside the shop, Polly carrying the bundle of nuts tucked under her arm, it was just as bad, and she put it off until the corner was reached down which they must turn to go to Miss Angell's. And worst of all, they were hurrying on so fast the lovely bit of news must be postponed.""How glad I am, Aunt didn't take it into her head to send me spinning off down there!"" observed Alexia, glancing down the long thoroughfare with anything but a pleasant expression on her long face. ""I just hate that Miss Angell's shop. Goodness me! we never could do it, with all this candy to make, and get our Club supper to-night.""Polly stopped short, and seized Alexia's arm. ""Oh, don't feel badly!"" she gasped, and then, thinking, ""It's better to have the whole out at once,"" she finished in one breath, ""Your aunt wants some green floss, Alexia."""
"""Well, she shan't have it,"" declared Alexia, stopping short, too, and glaring at Polly over her bundle of sugar. ""No, indeed!"" and her pale eyes grew very angry. ""The very idea! she's always wanting green floss, every single minute. Come on, Polly Pepper."" She set her face straight ahead and marched on. But not hearing Polly following, she looked over her shoulder, and then ran back. ""Why don't you come on? I shan't get that old green floss""--all in one breath.""We can get there in a few minutes perhaps,"" said Polly, ""Alexia, do let us hurry,"" and, turning down the corner, without so much as a glance backward, she went swiftly on, without trusting herself to look down the long street.""I shan't get that old green floss,"" declared Alexia wrathfully, standing quite still on the corner, yet, as Polly kept steadily on, showing no intention of stopping, she pattered after. But she kept saying, every step of the way, ""I shan't get that old green floss, Polly, _wait!_""""Oh, dear me!"" exclaimed Polly, in terror, and running down the steps. ""Did you hurt you? Oh, I'm so sorry!""--clasping her hands and looking the picture of distress. Then she saw it was Mrs. Patterson, a friend of Auntie Whitney's.""Polly, will you come?"" called Alexia, dancing about impatiently on the top step, and clutching the bag of sugar with nervous ringers that didn't help matters any. ""Oh, dear me, do look!""--pointing tragically to the little pile of sweetness at her feet.""Oh, that tiresome Mrs. Patterson! Well, it will do her good to tumble down once in a while,"" said Alexia unsympathetically, ""she's so stiff and mighty; and I should think you might pay some attention to me,"" she cried, in a loud, injured tone; ""I'm all in a mess with this sugar, and I haven't got any candy, and you made me come clear down to this old shop, and----""""And I'm glad enough to get where I can lay this old thing down,"" declared Alexia, dumping the bag of sugar upon the first resting-place she saw, an aesthetic little lounge, covered with elaborately embroidered pieces. ""Oh, me! my arms are almost broken,"" and she stretched them restfully, ""and beside, the sugar is 'most all run out.""The other lady was standing irresolutely by the lounge, but she wouldn't even look at the centerpieces that Miss Angell was smoothing out with a despairing hand, preparing to put them into their boxes again.Alexia was huddling up her bundle quite gone in despair, and lost to all the distress of having no candy to take to the Cooking Club supper. If those two ladies would only buy the centerpieces they had selected, it was all she hoped for in this world."
"Mrs. Alexander, a portly person, with a great deal of black jet and lace, that seemed to be always catching in the apparel of those who passed her, worked her way into the small shop, and up past the knot of people, giving friendly nods of recognition on her way.""How d'ye do, Miss Ellicott, Miss Juliana. How are you, Polly? And, Alexia, how is your aunt?"" And without waiting for a reply, she sprang, if such a ponderous body could be said to spring, at the box of centerpieces Miss Angell was packing away. ""Oh, oh! how beautiful! Stop""--laying her large hand on one. ""Just what I want. How much is it?""""Fifteen dollars,"" said Miss Angell, whipping it neatly out of the box, her dismal frown becoming an expansive smile. ""Yes, it is a beauty--one of the very latest things,"" and she spread it forth on the lounge with an experienced little nourish.Miss Ellicott deserted the door and hurried over to the lounge. ""I'll--I'll""--as she tried to work herself in between. But the portly Mrs. Alexander had no idea of being interrupted at such an important crisis in life when centerpieces were to be decided upon, so she loudly kept on in her bargaining. ""I'll take it,"" she said, in her most decided fashion. ""And the next one, too, I fancy; let me see that.""""If you'd done as I wanted you to,"" cried Miss Juliana, the tears of vexation gathering in her eyes, as she saw the now incomparable bits of fancy work borne off before their very faces, ""you wouldn't have stopped for such a trifle as a few crumbs of sugar, Sister.""Miss Ellicott's face was very red, but she knew better than to show the chagrin she felt, to add to the delight of the purchaser over her bargain, so she contented herself with saying, as she stalked to the door:""But I wasn't so set about it,"" said Miss Juliana, with a regretful glance at the box, now gayly tied up by the jubilant Miss Angell and delivered into the hands of the little errand-girl to be given to the Alexander footman, ""and I'm sure if you hadn't insisted, I should have seen that they weren't hurt.""""Well, do come on now, Juliana,"" said her sister sharply, in all the anguish of having the whole blame deposited upon her person. ""Since the things are gone, what is the use of talking about the matter?""--as they disappeared out of the shop.Polly and Alexia, therefore, had to wait for all this confusion and excitement to clear away, before the green floss could be bought and the message from Miss Rhys as to the patterns could be given. Meanwhile, Polly was tying up the package of sugar, and patting the shrunken paper bag into shape over the hole.""You tell your aunt,"" said Miss Angell, her cheeks quite flushed with elation over her good bargain, ""that I haven't any more patterns come in since she was here. Yes, Mrs. Alexander""--to that lady, with her head over a drawer, deep in a hunt for more bargains-""there are some exquisite designs among those. There's the floss""--bunching it up hurriedly into a wad, and speaking all in one breath. ""Would you mind, Miss Alexia, doing this up yourself?""--pointing to the white tissue paper on the table."
"""Isn't it!"" cried Alexia, in the greatest satisfaction. ""To think I got it done after all our fright! And it's the best candy I ever made""--glancing over the room, where the dish was being passed about eagerly.""Much better than candy!"" echoed Alexia, laying clown the slice of sponge cake that Clem had made, on her plate, and peering around into Polly's face. ""What do you mean, Polly Pepper? There can't anything possibly be better than candy.""""Yes, there can,"" contradicted Polly, twisting in delight on her chair, ""and you'll say so when you hear it. It's the most beautiful thing that could possibly have happened, Alexia Rhys. It's""--and just then the door opened and in walked Miss Mary Taylor and Mr. Hamilton Dyce, and the first glance that Alexia took of their faces, she guessed the whole thing.""Oh, Alexia, how could I?"" cried Polly, in an aggrieved little voice; ""for we were in such a perfectly dreadful scrape over getting ready for the supper! How could I, Alexia?"" She turned such a miserable face that Alexia made haste to say:And Mr. Hamilton Dyce being unable to keep his delight within bounds, and seeming to think it incumbent upon himself to take the young people into his confidence, just coolly announced it. And then there was no more paying attention to the cakes, and the little biscuits, the custards, and the whipped cream; and even Alexia's nut candy went begging.And Miss Mary had to sit in the center of each group of boys and girls, a few minutes at a time, for the supper was passed around on trays, till Mr. Dyce said he wished he hadn't told the news until the feast was ended. And after that, when they all finished up the evening festivities with a dance, why, every one there, tried to get her for first partner. But it was Alexia who swept them all one side.""Oh, well, I mean Miss Mary is my very dearest friend after that,"" said Alexia coolly, tossing him a saucy glance, as she bore off her beloved Sunday-school teacher down the whole length of Mrs. Keep's drawing-room floor.""Yes."" Phronsie bobbed her yellow head; then took it up from its resting-place in her mother's neck, to peer up into the face above. ""And she'll be my little girl all the time she is here, and I must get Clorinda fixed this very minute,"" she added, dreadfully excited. And, her news all told, Phronsie clambered down from Mrs. Fisher's lap and scurried off.And in a few minutes everybody knew all over the house that the letter had come, in which the invitation for Rachel's visit had been accepted by Miss Parrott. Moreover, she was to arrive on the following day.""Whoopity-la!"" sang Joel, who very much liked Rachel, for she was always ready to play anything that he proposed, and was a perfect adept in climbing trees and inventing a circus out of small material; ""now that's just prime! I wish she was coming to-day."""
"Joel's face worked, and he flung the broken racket across the room. It fell with a crash; and he ran over to the bed, hopped into the middle of it, and buried his face in his brown hands, his shoulders in distress.""Oh, just look what you are doing,"" exclaimed Percy, prancing up and down the room. He had started two or three times to run out and call Mrs. Fisher; then thought better of it. ""You've mussed the bedspread all up; and only look at those shams!""--hanging over the footboard in extreme dismay.Hearing these last words, both boys rolled apart and thrust up their heads, to gaze at the details in question. There they were, spick and span as usual at the top, but the lower parts were all mussed and wrinkled, while the lace at one end hung down in a small tag.""And just see how you've mussed up the bedspread,"" Percy couldn't help saying, to relieve his chagrin over the failure to make the pillow shams look nicely, and he drew off and pointed to it tragically. ""It looks as if crocodiles had been all over it,"" he declared, hunting for the worst thing he could think of.""As soon as I get one side nice, it all comes away from the other,"" he said to himself. ""How in the world does Jane ever make a bed, I wonder?"" And at last he deserted it altogether and drew off with a very hot face. ""Heigh-ho! I wish we could do something to celebrate when Rachel comes,"" and he wrinkled his brows in perplexity. ""Oh, I know,"" and he clapped his hands in glee. Then he ran softly out and up to Ben's room.But Ben wasn't in; so Percy, nearly bursting with a plan that now seemed to him very grand, was obliged to take some one else into his confidence. And that one happened to be old Mr. King, whom he met as he came downstairs with a very rueful countenance.""Oh, I was going to get Ben to take me out into the woods to-morrow,"" said Percy, feeling as if he should very much like to cry, he was so disappointed, ""and we could have dug up some cunning little plants and ferns: Rachel said she liked them at the garden party. We could have planted them in a box, and 'twould have been so nice, and now it's too late."" And, overcome with despair, he sat down on the first thing he could find, which was a pile of books on the floor.""I am glad you are not hurt,"" said Grandpapa King, with a rueful glance at the big reference volumes, only laid out for his use that morning, which certainly wouldn't be improved by their fall. ""Here, wait a bit, and I'll help you, Percy, my boy,"" and he got out of his chair.""Oh, I can do it; let me, Grandpapa; let me do it alone,"" begged Percy, tugging at the books and piling as rapidly as he could, for they were quite heavy. ""There, see, they're almost back again""--as he staggered up with the last one.""Not quite so fast,"" said Grandpapa King, lending his hand to the task. ""Now next time when you want to sit down, I advise you to take a chair, Percy, my boy. Well, now, let us think how you can get up a nice little surprise for Rachel when she comes to-morrow.""""And nobody must know it,"" cried Percy, quite enchanted at the prospect of having a secret plan with Grandpapa. ""Oh, you won't tell anybody but me, will you?"" He crowded in between the old gentleman's chair and the big table, and regarded him anxiously."
