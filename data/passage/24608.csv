passage
Each night the Katydids' rasping chant was repeated again and again: _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did!_ But since in any crowd there are always a few that want to be different from the rest, now and then some member of Kiddie's clan insisted that Katy didn't--somewhat in this fashion: _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she didn't!_However, there were always so many others to drown any such puzzling statement with their shrill clamor that Katy really _did_ do it (whatever it was!) that nobody paid much attention to those few who didn't quite agree.On warm, dry, midsummer nights the Katydids all made a terrific racket. But there wasn't one of them that outdid Kiddie. He always had the best time when he was making the most noise. And since he liked to station himself in a tree near Farmer Green's house, his uproar often rose plainly above that of the other Katydids.To be sure, the balmy breezes wafted many other night sounds through Johnnie's open window. From near-by came Chirpy Cricket's cheerful piping. And in the distant swamp the musical Frog family held a singing party every evening. Johnnie Green liked to hear them. But he objected strongly to the weird hooting and horrid laughter of Solomon Owl, who left the hemlock woods after dark to hunt for field mice.As for Kiddie Katydid, he paid little attention to any other of the night cries. No matter what anybody else said, he solemnly hurled back at him that neverending refrain, _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did!_You would have thought, if you had heard Kiddie, that somebody had disputed his statement. But such was not the case at all. Since no one except the Katydids knew anything about the mysterious Katy, nobody was able to say truthfully that she _didn't_ do it. In fact, the whole affair was a great secret, so far as outsiders were concerned. And one night Johnnie Green even thrust his head out of the window and cried impatiently: It must not be supposed that all of Kiddie Katydid's family made the same neverending din at night. Actually it was only the gentlemen that so amused themselves. No doubt the ladies, too, knew the secret about the mysterious Katy--and what she did.Furthermore, in the daytime Kiddie and his fellows were as quiet as they could be. Having waked the echoes all night long, they were content, when morning came, to rest silently among the trees and shrubs. And a very good reason did they have, too, for such a habit. During the day there were altogether too many birds flying about, to please the Katydids. And Kiddie often remarked in a joking way that the only birds he cared about were those that _didn't care about him_!Of course, there were a few birds that prowled about Pleasant Valley after dark. Mr. Nighthawk was one of that crew of nightly wanderers. And whenever the word was passed around that he had been seen in the neighborhood, Kiddie Katydid tried to lower his solemn chant, because he knew that Mr. Nighthawk was usually in search of something to eat.
"So you see it was no wonder that Kiddie was not eager to attract the attention of that night rover. Some of the more timid of Kiddie's companions even begged him, at times, to hush. They said he was making such a noise that Mr. Nighthawk would be sure to hear it, even if he were a quarter of a mile away.""A person has to take a few chances,"" he remarked one day. ""If we were all afraid to make a sound it would be pretty hard on Katy, for then she would have nobody to take her part. And what would people think of her?""He fell so fast that Kiddie Katydid, watching from his hiding-place in one of the maples, couldn't help hoping that the sky-coaster would be unable to stop himself in time to escape being dashed upon the ground.Meanwhile Kiddie Katydid kept very still among the leaves, with his wings folded over his back. Only his two long, thread-like feelers _would_ wave backwards and forwards, although he tried to keep them still. He was so nearly the color of the green of the tree-top that he trusted Mr. Nighthawk wouldn't be able to spy him.""Why, good evening!"" Kiddie Katydid answered, since he was discovered--and there was no use denying it. ""It's a great surprise--meeting you so unexpectedly. If you'd only sent word that you were coming I'd have made different arrangements.""""I've no doubt you would have!"" Mr. Nighthawk sneered. ""But I like to take people unawares.... I've heard about you,"" he added. ""They say that you're a great jumper--the spriest jumper in all Pleasant Valley.""""Well, I can jump fairly well,"" Kiddie Katydid admitted. ""But I don't pride myself on my jumping. It's something that has always run in my family, you know. All of us Katydids can leap quite a distance without any trouble.""Kiddie Katydid almost jumped out of his skin when he heard what Mr. Nighthawk said. And it wouldn't have been anything remarkable for him if he had. He had already squirmed out of his skin six times that summer--though not from fear, of course. Casting his skin was almost a habit with Kiddie. All his family were like that.Though he was not nearly so old as Mr. Nighthawk, Kiddie Katydid had learned a thing or two during his brief lifetime. And though he would have liked very much to jump--and jump out of Mr. Nighthawk's sight, too--he had no wish to hide himself _inside_ that feathered scoundrel. So he clung all the tighter to his perch and replied that he didn't believe he cared to do any jumping that night."
"Now, Mr. Nighthawk had a certain odd trick of talking through his nose. Whether that was because the late hours he kept, even on dark nights, gave him a cold in his head, nobody seemed to know. Anyhow, he began teasing Kiddie Katydid to jump for him--and he talked through his nose more than ever. Yes! although Mr. Nighthawk tried his best to speak pleasantly, he only succeeded in making Kiddie Katydid want to laugh at him, for all Kiddie was so uneasy. ""I certainly hope you aren't going to disappoint me?"" Mr. Nighthawk whined, as he looked hungrily at Kiddie Katydid. ""Please, please jump for me--just once!"" he begged. ""Here I've come all the way across the meadow on purpose to see what a fine jumper you are! And I shall feel very unhappy if you don't perform for me.""""I know--I know,"" said Mr. Nighthawk, nodding his head. ""But I thought that just to oblige a friend you wouldn't object to jumping from this tree into that one."" And he pointed to the nearest maple, the branches of which all but touched the tree-top in which they were sitting. But Kiddie Katydid's mind was made up.All this time Mr. Nighthawk was growing hungrier than ever. And one might well wonder why he didn't make one quick spring at Kiddie Katydid and swallow him. But that was not Mr. Nighthawk's way of dining.""I don't know where my relations are just now,"" replied Kiddie Katydid. ""Some of them were here a while ago; but they went away."" And that was quite true! At that _peent_--that first warning cry--of Mr. Nighthawk's, they had all vanished as if by magic, among the leaves.""What about that Katy you're always talking about?"" Mr. Nighthawk then inquired. ""Don't you suppose you could find _her_ and persuade _her_ to do a little jumping for me--just to show me how it's done?""""I'm sorry--"" Kiddie said somewhat stiffly, ""I'm sorry; but I must absolutely refuse to do such a thing. Now that you've mentioned her, I'll simply say _Katy did_. And beyond that I cannot discuss her with you.""But Kiddie Katydid declined to answer that question. He merely hugged his wings closer to his green body, and shot a sly glance at Mr. Nighthawk, as if to say, ""Ah! That's for _you_ to find out! But I shan't tell you!"""
"Mr. Nighthawk looked rather foolish. He had always supposed that any one who spent a good part of every night saying the same thing over and over and over again must be quite dull-witted. But now he began to think that perhaps Kiddie Katydid was brighter than the field people generally believed him to be. And when Kiddie suddenly asked _him_ a question, he was sure of his mistake. For a few moments Mr. Nighthawk fidgeted about on his branch of the maple tree. What Kiddie Katydid said to him about Solomon Owl frightened him. And he almost wished he hadn't come to Farmer Green's dooryard that night.""Oh, I can't begin to fly as well as you can,"" Kiddie Katydid told Mr. Nighthawk. ""I only wish I knew how to coast down out of the sky the way you do, without being dashed upon the ground.... How do you manage to stop so suddenly?""In spite of his way of belittling his flying feats, Mr. Nighthawk was secretly very proud of his skill at sky-coasting. And when Kiddie Katydid asked him if he wouldn't kindly give an exhibition of the art of fancy flying, Mr. Nighthawk couldn't help feeling pleased.He wanted to display his skill. But there was just one thing that troubled him. He was afraid that if he climbed up into the sky, before he dropped down again Kiddie Katydid would have vanished. And that didn't suit Mr. Nighthawk's plans.Then he began climbing upwards into the sky. And he had gone about as high as he wished to, when all at once a rolling _Whoo-whoo-whoo_, _whoo-whoo_, _to-whoo-ah_ startled him. It was Solomon Owl's weird call. And it drove every thought except one out of Mr. Nighthawk's head. That one idea--to escape--filled his mind completely. And he turned and hurried away from Farmer Green's place as fast as he could go; for Mr. Nighthawk feared that Solomon Owl would arrive there at any moment.As for Kiddie Katydid, when he heard Solomon's cry he knew at once that he was rid of Mr. Nighthawk. And Kiddie's _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did_ rang out again and again in the night. All his friends and cousins crept out of their hiding-places and joined in the chorus. And everybody enjoyed a good laugh over Mr. Nighthawk's visit--and his sudden departure.""I knew better than to jump for Mr. Nighthawk!"" he cried. ""I happened to know that he always wants to catch his food _on the wing_. And if I had jumped, or tried to fly away, he would have snatched me right out of the air as quick as lightning."""
"That secret about Katy, and what she did, was not the only one that Kiddie hid from the field people. He had another--something about himself--that nobody ever suspected, until Freddie Firefly stumbled upon it one night.Probably Freddie would never have learned this second secret had he not been trying to find out about the first one. Over in the meadow he had heard Kiddie Katydid shrilling his well-worn ditty, _Katy did; she did, she did!_ And he had danced his way into Farmer Green's dooryard because he wanted to have a talk with Kiddie and ask him some questions about that unknown lady.Like all others who tried to pry into the mystery, Freddie Firefly had no luck at all. For Kiddie Katydid made no reply to his inquiries. Kiddie merely smiled in a most annoying fashion and kept on repeating the refrain.But Kiddie refused to answer that question--a fact which at once made Freddie suspicious. He moved nearer Kiddie Katydid and flashed his light upon him every time Kiddie repeated his odd statement about Katy. And soon Freddie Firefly grew much excited. He actually danced up and down, he was so astonished.""I've found you out!"" he cried in a loud voice. ""It's no wonder your voice doesn't get tired from that song! For you don't really _sing_ it at all! You make that queer _sound by rubbing your wing covers together_!""Kiddie Katydid abruptly ceased his shrilling. He looked most uncomfortable. And it was not surprising. He had not supposed that Freddie Firefly--or anybody else--would be shrewd enough to discover that secret. It was a family secret--one that had been closely guarded by the Katydids since the beginning of time, almost. And here he had gone and let Freddie Firefly find it out!""I don't care about your manners,"" Freddie answered. ""I dare say they're good enough, although some people think it's rather rude of you to make so much noise when a good many others are trying to sleep.""""I should like to know who objects to my music?"" Kiddie Katydid exclaimed hotly. ""If Farmer Green has been talking to you, I should like to state that he had better be careful. Anyone who drives a clattering mowing-machine around, when a lot of us are trying to get our rest in the daytime, ought not to complain about a little _music_ on a pleasant night like this.""""There!"" he cried. ""You've just the same as told me that I was right. If you _sang_ your _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did_, you would call it _singing_. But since you make that ditty by rubbing your wing covers together, it is _music_. And you just referred to it as such!"""
"Well, Kiddie Katydid couldn't say a single word. Freddie Firefly was right. They both knew it. And the secret was hopelessly ""out."" In fact, it was a secret no longer--unless Kiddie Katydid could persuade Freddie Firefly to keep the news to himself.""Won't I?"" said Freddie Firefly. ""Why, I just couldn't help telling people what I've learned! It's the biggest bit of news that I've known since I've lived in Pleasant Valley. And I must get word of it to old Mr. Crow somehow.""""Ah! That's just the point!"" cried Freddie. ""Mr. Crow _is_ a newspaper. Perhaps you didn't know it; but every Saturday he flies over Blue Mountain to the pond where Brownie Beaver lives and tells Brownie all the news of the past week.""""You're too modest,"" he said. ""It's a shame to be able to make music the way you do and not let the neighbors know it. Why, the first thing you know you'll be one of the most famous people in this whole valley.""""But I don't want to be!"" Kiddie Katydid cried. ""I'm not like you. You go dancing about every night, flashing your light so everyone can see you. But I stay among the trees and shrubs. And I even wear a green suit--which matches the color of the leaves--so people won't notice me. Of course,"" Kiddie added, ""I don't mind if the public hears my music. But I don't care to be seen, as a rule. And I don't like callers a bit!""""You don't, eh?"" remarked Freddie Firefly. ""Then it's time for me to be moving along. For I never stay where I'm not welcome."" And he flitted away, feeling somewhat peevish--and all the more determined to get the news of the discovered secret to Mr. Crow at the earliest possible moment."
"He was pondering over his difficulty, which bothered him not a little, when a terrific croaking from the direction of the swamp reached his ears. It was the final chorus of the Frog family's nightly singing party. And it promptly put an idea into Freddie Firefly's head.""I'll hurry right over there and speak to Mr. Frog, the well-known tailor,"" he said to himself. ""He knows old Mr. Crow. He sees him almost every day. And he'll be glad to give the old gentleman a message."" When Freddie Firefly reached the swamp he found that the singing party had already broken up. But luckily, Mr. Frog the tailor was the last one to leave. He was still poised on the bank of the sluggish stream, ready to plunge into the water and swim away, when Freddie Firefly dropped down upon a cat-tail and called him by name, flashing his light frantically so that Mr. Frog would be sure to notice him.""Out with it, then!"" said Mr. Frog. ""My time is valuable, you know. I ought to be back in my shop this moment; for I promised Paddy Muskrat I'd make him a policeman's uniform by to-morrow morning. And I haven't begun it yet.""""Certainly not!"" replied Mr. Frog. ""I see you don't know much about making a policeman's suit. You start by laying the buttons in a row on the ground; and then you sew the cloth onto them.... That's my own invention--that method,"" he added with an air of pride. ""And now, what was it you wanted to say to me?""""I don't believe there's any use of my telling you, after all,"" Freddie Firefly replied. ""You're going to be so busy that you won't have time to do an errand for me. I wanted you to give Mr. Crow a message.""""Tut, tut, young man!"" Mr. Frog cried. ""I see you have something important to tell me. And since that is the case, I'll manage somehow to deliver your message to Mr. Crow, even if I have to disappoint a customer. _Always oblige a friend!_ That's my motto!"" said Mr. Frog.""Oh, it doesn't,"" the tailor echoed. ""Then I don't know that I care to listen to you, after all. I thought you were going to explain about that mysterious lady that Kiddie's always singing about."" He was sadly disappointed. And once more he turned toward the creek."
"""That--"" replied Freddie Firefly--""that is just where you're mistaken, Mr. Frog. And that's where everybody else is mistaken, too. To-night I was lucky enough to learn that Kiddie Katydid has been fooling us all this time.""""Perhaps he will when he hears the rest of the message,"" Freddie answered. ""I was just going to explain that Kiddie Katydid has a trick of rubbing his wing covers together to make that _Katy did_ sound.""""For the land's sake!"" cried Mr. Frog, as he leaped into the water, convinced at last of the truth of Freddie Firefly's claim. ""I must hurry home at once, for dawn's already breaking. And Mr. Crow may come sailing over my place at any moment."" He landed with a splash in the creek and started to swim rapidly away. But after a few strokes he paused and turned around. ""You might almost say that Kiddie Katydid is a fiddler, mightn't you?"" he called.""You may as well put out your light!"" Mr. Frog shouted back, as he disappeared among the reeds. But he didn't wait to see whether Freddie took his advice. He was too much excited over the strange news. And as he swam easily along with practiced strokes he kept talking to himself.""I'm a pretty clever chap, I am!"" he chuckled. ""I've discovered a great secret this night. And old Mr. Crow will be glad to hear all about it. Perhaps he'll want me to help him with his newspaper after this. Mr. Frog reached home just as the sun peeped over the hills. He slipped hastily out of the water, sprang up the bank of the creek, and in three jumps landed on the roof of his tailor's shop. There he squatted, while his queer, bulging eyes scanned the sky in every direction. He was watching for Mr. Crow, and all but bursting with the news that he had for the old gentleman.""What's your news about?"" Mr. Crow asked him gruffly. ""I suppose you've made another suit for somebody. And you remember I told you I couldn't put that news in my newspaper any more unless you paid me something. It's advertising. And nobody gets free advertising."""
"""Don't!"" Mr. Crow begged. ""Please don't! It's bad enough to have to hear that silly chorus every time I happen to wake up during the night--bad enough, I say, without being obliged to listen to it in broad daylight.""""Well, there's nothing to prevent your telling this story to other people, is there? And you certainly will be willing to mention me at the same time, won't you?"" Mr. Frog inquired with an anxious pucker between his strange eyes.""Perhaps you did--and perhaps you didn't,"" Mr. Crow observed. Being very, very old, he was very, very wise. And he had long since learned that Mr. Frog was a somewhat slippery person. ""If I spread any such news as this about Pleasant Valley I shall do it in my own way,"" he remarked. And thereupon the old gentleman rose quickly and disappeared in the direction of the cornfield, without so much as a ""Thank you!"" Well, the day was not half gone before all the wild creatures in Pleasant Valley had heard all about Kiddie Katydid and his fiddling. At least twenty-seven people came to Mr. Frog at different times and told him the news. And he was furious.""Mr. Crow has suggested that Kiddie Katydid be invited to join the Pleasant Valley orchestra,"" Long Bill Wren informed Mr. Frog. ""They have no fiddlers, you know. And Kiddie will be a great help to them. Mr. Crow has appointed a committee to call on Kiddie to-night and ask him to come to the next concert.""After flinging that remark over his shoulder, Mr. Frog flung himself inside his tailor's shop and slammed the door behind him. And then, sitting down cross-legged upon his table, he began to think, wrinkling his low brow until you might have supposed he would need to smooth it out again with one of his flat-irons.At last the tailor suddenly quit thinking and smiled very widely from ear to ear. And carefully selecting some soft, warm, green cloth he began to fashion a small garment, which was tiny enough to fit--well, to fit a person as little as Kiddie Katydid.Being a spry worker, Mr. Frog finished his task by nightfall. And then, taking his handiwork with him, he left his shop--after locking the door behind him--and hid himself beneath a shelving rock on the bank of the creek.""If it wasn't midsummer I should think we were going to have a frost!"" Mr. Frog exclaimed, buttoning the long coat which he had donned before going out of doors. ""I wish they'd hurry up!"" he added mysteriously. He kept a close watch upon his shop door. It was evident that he expected callers."
"Not long afterward a crowd began to gather in front of Mr. Frog's door. ""Back Soon"" said the sign upon it. And the thinly clad, shivering knot of field folk sat themselves down unhappily and waited for the tailor to appear. Every one of them wanted a warm new overcoat, for each expected to be out late that night.Meanwhile Mr. Frog watched them--and giggled as loud as he dared. It was Mr. Crow's committee that thronged about his door--the people who were expecting to call upon Kiddie Katydid that very night to invite him to join the Pleasant Valley orchestra. Mr. Frog had a delightful time listening to the remarks of his callers, who had no idea that he was so near at hand. And as the weather grew colder, they began to shiver and their voices began to shake. And by the time it was almost dark all the waiting company were quite discouraged.""Mr. Crow will be very angry with us to-morrow when he learns we haven't called on Kiddie Katydid,"" somebody remarked. And a hush fell upon the company. But Chirpy Cricket had a happy thought, which made them all feel better.""Kiddie Katydid won't stay out of doors on a night like this!"" he suddenly exclaimed. ""He'll find some snug place to creep into. And we wouldn't be able to find him in Farmer Green's dooryard even if we tried to.""Nevertheless, he was pleased, on the whole. And not waiting to watch the shivering party leave the neighborhood, he set off at once toward Farmer Green's house, making first for the river, which ran near the farm buildings, because Mr. Frog did not like to travel by land.Because the air was cool, the water felt all the warmer. And by the time Mr. Frog had reached his journey's end he was almost overheated. Besides, as he noticed, it was not so cold in Farmer Green's dooryard as it had been by the creek.""You're exceedingly kind, I'm sure,"" said Kiddie. And he was about to jump down and slip into the coat when he noticed that Mr. Frog had an extremely wide mouth.... Suppose, after slipping into the coat, he should find himself slipping down the tailor's throat?""I see!"" Mr. Frog cried. ""That's your way of accepting a gift. And I wouldn't dream of quarreling with you about that. So I'll hang the coat right here and go back to the watering-trough to wet my feet. While I'm gone you can try the coat on, and tell me how you like it when I come back."""
"""Ah! Trust me not to make a mistake!"" Mr. Frog chuckled happily. And then he withdrew. But he could not help pausing for a moment, to look back and watch, while Kiddie sprang down from his tree and took his new coat from the twig on which the tailor had hung it.""I've come here to-night to deliver an important message to you,"" Mr. Frog went on. ""And thinking the weather might be cooler than you liked, I made you that fine coat so you could stay out here in your tree and listen to what I have to tell you.... I hear--"" he said--""I hear that you're a musician.""""Well, how do you know that you can't, if you've never tried?"" Mr. Frog retorted. ""If you can play _Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did_, by rubbing your wing covers together, there's no knowing what you could do with a real fiddle and bow.""""Well,"" said Mr. Frog, who appeared greatly pleased with himself, ""anyhow, I want you to join our singing society. Perhaps you've heard me and my friends over in the swamp. Almost every night we have a singing party there. And if you'll only agree to fiddle for us, while we sing, I venture to say that we'll have Farmer Green getting up out of his bed to listen to us.""""Promise me this, at least--"" Mr. Frog finally said--""promise me that you won't agree to make music for anybody else! Now that people know you're musical, they'll be asking you to play in an orchestra, or a band, or a fife-and-drum corps, or something. But I've invited you first, and if you oblige anybody it ought to be me--especially after I've given you that beautiful warm overcoat."" The tailor looked upwards into the tree so beseechingly that Kiddie Katydid hadn't the heart to refuse his request. Old Mr. Crow flew into a terrible rage when he found, the next morning, that his committee had not called on Kiddie Katydid during the night. And when Chirpy Cricket told him that the weather was too cold for anybody to stay out late, Mr. Crow said ""Nonsense! What about Mr. Frog?""The old gentleman was so disturbed that he quite lost his appetite during the rest of the day. And he moped and groaned about, hoping for the best, but fearing the worst. One thing that made him especially uneasy was the fact that when he called on Mr. Frog he found the tailor in a gayer mood than he had ever known him to be in.""What's the matter?"" Mr. Frog asked him. ""Don't you like my voice? Or is it the songs I sing? I've a new one that I'd like to sing for you. It's about one of the Katydid family; and I'm sure you'll enjoy hearing it."""
"That night Mr. Crow's committee called on Kiddie Katydid. It was a fine, warm, moonlight night. And as they drew near Farmer Green's place they could hear Kiddie's shrill music, even while they were still a quarter of a mile away.It was a downcast company that left Farmer Green's front yard. And they quarreled among themselves, too, before they parted. For there wasn't one of them that was willing to tell Mr. Crow that Kiddie had declined his invitation.It turned out that Jasper was delighted to undertake the task. He hoped that Mr. Crow would fly into a passion when he heard the sad tale. And Jasper was not disappointed. For old Mr. Crow was furious. Of course, Kiddie Katydid was not always to be found in his favorite nook among the trees in Farmer Green's front yard. Quite often he went skipping about from tree to tree or from bush to bush, sometimes flying and sometimes leaping. It really made little difference to him which mode of travel he used. And he never stopped to think how lucky he was to be able to move so spryly with the help of either his legs or his wings. He took his good fortune as a matter of course.Such thoughts, however, never entered Kiddie Katydid's head. He went cheerfully about his business--which was _eating_, principally--and jumped or flew as the mood seized him. Indeed, if it hadn't been for that queer fellow, Benjamin Bat, probably Kiddie never would have realized just what he could--or couldn't--do.Since Benjamin was another night-prowler like himself, Kiddie Katydid saw him often. It seemed to Kiddie that he could scarcely ever gaze at the full moon without catching sight of Benjamin Bat's dusky shape flitting jerkily across the great, round, yellow disk.When Benjamin was astir in the neighborhood, Kiddie Katydid lay low--or high--in his favorite tree-top. At least, he kept very still until the night was nearly gone, to give Benjamin Bat plenty of time to satisfy his hunger. For Kiddie found Benjamin Bat a much more agreeable companion when he had eaten his fill. Early in the evening, soon after he had waked up, Benjamin was positively ferocious. But the more he ate, the pleasanter he grew. And by the time faint streaks of light began to show in the east he could smile and crack a joke as easily as anybody else.""We ought to have some sports right here in Farmer Green's yard,"" he suggested. ""You're such a fine jumper that you could try your skill against Mr. Frog. And you're such a fine flier that you and Freddie Firefly ought to have a race.... I'd suggest--"" he added--""I'd suggest that the sports take place after dark, almost any evening."""
"But Kiddie Katydid spoke up quickly and said that he wouldn't care to join in the fun until the night was almost gone. He said he was sure he could jump and fly better at that time. And that was quite true, because he knew that if Mr. Bat swallowed him early in the evening he wouldn't be able to take any part in the sports.""Oh, yes!"" said Benjamin. ""I'm going to hang by my heels from the limb of a tree. And since I'm never so heavy early in the evening, before I've had a chance to eat much, I'd prefer to have the sports begin soon after dark."" When the night of the races and other sports finally came, a great crowd began to gather about Farmer Green's place soon after dark. Although Benjamin Bat had told people that the fun wasn't going to begin until almost morning, they were all so excited that they couldn't wait for the night to pass.Mr. Frog objected to every arrangement that Benjamin Bat had made. When he learned that he was expected to enter a jumping contest with Kiddie Katydid he exclaimed that he and Kiddie were such good friends that he hated the thought of trying to beat Kiddie at jumping.""Wouldn't you prefer some other sort of contest?"" Mr. Frog then asked him. ""Now, there's swimming! We could swim in the watering-trough, or the duck pond. And if I beat you, you could stick your head under water, so you wouldn't hear what people said. Don't you think that's a good idea?""Meanwhile Benjamin Bat was worrying. He couldn't find anybody who was willing to try the sport of hanging head downward by his heels. He asked Kiddie Katydid; and Kiddie declined flatly to do any such thing.""What's the matter?"" he sneered. ""Don't you know how to do an easy trick like that? If I could see you--"" he declared, peering among the maple leaves--""if I could see you I'd show you how it feels to hang beneath a limb.""Kiddie Katydid said no word in reply. He knew well enough what Benjamin Bat meant. Benjamin wanted to eat him! And he wished that Benjamin would go away and get a good meal somewhere before he came back again.Naturally, Benjamin's temper grew worse as the night lengthened. And Kiddie Katydid had to admit to himself that he would be most unwise if he did any jumping or flying just then. For Benjamin Bat was in so fierce a humor that he was ready to snap at anybody who was smaller than he was. All the tiny flying folk gave him a wide berth. And it began to look as if he were going to spoil the night's fun."
"""Certainly! Certainly!"" Mr. Frog said then. ""I've been trying to think of some way to prevent so much quarreling. It hardly seems fair to Kiddie Katydid--this uproar right in his dooryard. And since you are the one that's making the greatest disturbance, I'd suggest that you go away and leave us to enjoy the rest of the night in peace.""""That's strange!"" thought Benjamin. ""He must have put out his light, to fool me. But I don't care, because Kiddie Katydid is hidden somewhere in this tree. And I'm going to find him--for I'm terribly hungry.""So Benjamin began flying in and out among the maple branches. Nobody but he could have twisted and turned in such a helter-skelter fashion. It made Kiddie Katydid almost dizzy just to watch him. But Kiddie didn't take his eyes off Benjamin, because he intended to jump--and jump fast and far--in case Benjamin should spy him.Now, although the Bat family was able to see in the dark as well as Farmer Green's cat could, Benjamin failed to find Kiddie Katydid anywhere. Crouching motionless upon a leaf, and dressed all in green, Kiddie Katydid was almost invisible. But if he had moved the least bit, Benjamin Bat would have found him out.Looking only for a tiny green figure among the green leaves, Benjamin Bat paid no attention to the grayish branches of the tree. He was really strangely careless. Quite unsuspected by him, while he was wrangling with Mr. Frog, the cat had crept out of the woodshed and stolen softly into that very tree, where she lay motionless along a limb. She had come out upon an early morning hunt for birds.She was a fierce old cat. There was nothing, almost, that she wasn't ready and willing to fight. Even old dog Spot had learned to shun her. And now she waited patiently until Benjamin Bat should come within reach of her quick paws.That stupid, blundering fellow bumped squarely into her at last. And how he escaped is still a mystery. The old cat always claimed that when she found Benjamin wasn't a bird she was so surprised that she let him go. And as for Benjamin himself, he never would discuss his adventure with anybody. Kiddie Katydid was the only other one who saw what happened. But he was so frightened at the time that he only knew that Benjamin Bat tore away toward the swamp as if a thousand cats were following him. And people do say that for some time afterward, Kiddie Katydid shrilled a slightly different ditty. It was _Kitty did, Kitty did; she did, she did_!"
"Kiddie Katydid had a neighbor who was a good deal like him. Indeed, a careless person had to look sharply to discover much difference between them. But there was a difference. There was, especially, a certain way in which one could always tell them apart. One had only to take the trouble to look at their horns--or feelers. For Kiddie Katydid had horns as long--or longer--than he was. But his neighbor, who was known as Leaper the Locust, wore his horns quite short.Although they saw each other often, Kiddie and this neighbor of his were not on the best of terms. The trouble was simply this: they couldn't agree on the question of horns. Whenever they met they were sure to have a most unpleasant dispute before they parted.Really, their quarrels were as bad as those that Jimmy Rabbit and Frisky Squirrel once had over the matter of tails. And many of the field folk said it was a shame that the Grasshoppers' trouble couldn't be settled somehow.The difficulty was that the field people--as well as Farmer Green's whole family--had fallen into the lazy habit of calling those two by the same name. They spoke of Kiddie Katydid as ""the Long-horned Grasshopper,"" while they termed his neighbor ""the Short-horned Grasshopper.""""Honestly, I'm tempted to move away from this neighborhood,"" Leaper the Locust began to tell everyone he met. ""If that chap would only trim his horns to the proper length I wouldn't mind it so much. But he's actually proud of them. He's always waving them over his head, so people will notice them.""They both declared--Kiddie Katydid and Leaper the Locust--that they couldn't abide the name ""Grasshopper."" And they took pains to warn people in the neighborhood that they wouldn't answer to that name, no matter how loudly anyone might shout it at them.After that a few of their neighbors took great delight in crying ""Grasshopper! Grasshopper!"" whenever one of the two happened to be within hearing. But no matter which of them it might be--whether Leaper the Locust or Kiddie Katydid--he pretended not to hear, and went right on eating.But at last something happened that made both those jumpy gentlemen change their minds. From not wanting to be called Grasshoppers, they decided suddenly that they liked the name. And each claimed that the other had no right to it.""That message for 'Mr. Grasshopper' is certainly meant for me,"" Kiddie insisted. ""You know yourself how you have objected to being called by the name of 'Grasshopper.' Why, only last night you refused to stop when Freddie Firefly shouted it after you."""
"""And you--"" cried Leaper the Locust--""you paid no attention when Chirpy Cricket went up to you just as the moon rose this evening and said, 'How-dy do, Mr. Grasshopper!' right in your ear. You have no right to open the message. And I promise you that I shall make trouble for you if you don't mind your own affairs.""""Well, well--what's all this row about, anyhow?"" asked a strange voice. It was a newcomer in Pleasant Valley who had just spoken. He elbowed his way briskly through the throng until he reached the center of it, where Kiddie and Leaper the Locust faced each other angrily. People noticed that the stranger looked as if he had travelled a long distance. And he had a mail-pouch slung over his back. Furthermore, he was enough like Kiddie and Leaper to be a cousin of either one of them.""Ah! I thought not!"" said the stranger, ""I thought not, because I have it in this mail-bag. And now I must confess that I'm puzzled myself; for I don't know which one it's intended for."" And he pulled off his hat and began fanning himself with it.He soon discovered that there was some difficulty. Kiddie Katydid had torn open the message; and now he turned it over and over, wondering what it said--for to tell the truth, he couldn't read a single word. Though you do not know me, I am a distant cousin of yours; and I am now on my way to your neighborhood, with my family. Not being acquainted in your part of the country, I am sending you this message with the hope that you will be ready to welcome us when we arrive. _Please see that there's a plenty to eat!_Thereupon the travel-worn messenger repeated the contents of the letter. And this time he held it with the back towards him, so that he couldn't see the writing at all. Like Kiddie Katydid, he didn't know how to read a word. But luckily he had learned the message by heart before starting on his journey.""I believe you know more than you're willing to tell!"" he suddenly cried. And then he quickly shoved the letter inside the stranger's mail-pouch. ""That's not for me, after all!"" he declared. ""Unless I'm greatly mistaken, the person that sent this letter is a Short-horn, the same as you. And I want nothing to do with him!"""
"""Where's that other fellow that was clamoring for the message?"" the stranger asked. And spying Leaper the Locust on the edge of the crowd, he sprang upon him, collared him, and explained that there had been a mistake. Kiddie Katydid looked on happily while Leaper the Locust struggled to free himself from the clutches of the messenger. But Leaper was no match for the stranger. In the end he had to accept the message as his own.Then the field people would shake their heads and say that they didn't understand. Wasn't everybody _glad_ to have company once in a while? And wouldn't it be a _pleasure_ to talk with strangers who came from some far-off place, and ask them how the crops were where they lived, and what the weather was?Well, Kiddie's neighbors couldn't imagine what he meant. They made a good many guesses. But there was always somebody to point out some flaw and upset every calculation. So at last everybody stopped guessing and admitted that he had no idea as to what Kiddie Katydid had in mind. It was just another one of his secrets. And people might as well wait patiently to see what happened. Even Solomon Owl agreed to that. ""Time will tell!"" he said with a wise nod of his head. In at least one respect, the short-horned messenger had told the truth. Before twenty-four hours had gone by, the fellow returned to Farmer Green's dooryard; and with him came a great, fat person who belonged without question to the Locust family.""There are tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands,"" Kiddie Katydid declared solemnly. ""They'll eat everything they can find. And we shall be lucky if they leave enough for the rest of us to live on, after they pass on.""So Freddie Firefly went off to hunt for Leaper the Locust. He knew now why Leaper had struggled to escape from that mysterious messenger with the curious message. And Freddie intended to ask Leaper a good many questions about his cousins.But Benjamin Bat was having the time of his life. He said that he hoped the Short-horns would like Pleasant Valley so well that they would decide to stay right there for the rest of their days. But, strange to say, Benjamin made things as unpleasant as possible for the newcomers. He _ate_ as many of them as he could, remarking that from such a horde a few would scarcely be missed."
