passage
"A Frog he would a-wooing go, _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY! Whether his Mother would let him or no. _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_, _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!So off he set with his opera-hat, _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY! And on his way he met with a Rat. _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_, _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!""Pray, MR. RAT, will you go with me,"" _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY! ""Pretty MISS MOUSEY for to see?"" _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_, _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!Now they soon arrived at Mousey's Hall, _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY! And gave a loud knock, and gave a loud call. _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_, _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!""Pray, Miss MOUSEY, are you within?"" _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY! ""Oh, yes, kind Sirs, I'm sitting to spin."" _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_, _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!""Pray, Mr. FROG, will you give us a song? _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY! ""But let it be something that's not very long."" _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach,_ _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!""Indeed, Miss MOUSE,"" replied Mr FROG, _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY! ""A cold has made me as hoarse as a Hog."" _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_, _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!""Since you have caught cold,"" Miss MOUSEY said. _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY! ""I'll sing you a song that I have just made."" _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_, _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!But while they were all thus a merry-making, _Heigho, says_ ROWLEY! A Cat and her Kittens came tumbling in. _With a rowley-powley, gammon and spinach_, _Heigho, says_ ANTHONY ROWLEY!"
