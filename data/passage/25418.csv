"Oranges and lemons, says the bells of St. Clemen's; You owe me five farthings, says the bells of St. Martin's; When will you pay me, says the bells of Old Bailey; When I grow rich, says the bells of Shoreditch; When will that be? says the bells of Stepney; I do not know, says the great bell of Bow.Upon Paul's steeple stands a tree As full of apples as may be, The little boys of London town They run with hooks to pull them down; And then they run from hedge to hedge Until they come to London Bridge.]Ding dong bell! Pussy's in the well! Who put her in? Little Tommy Lin. Who pulled her out? Little Tommy Stout. What a naughty boy was that To drown poor pussy-cat, Who ne'er did any harm, But killed all the mice in father's barn.]1. A jolly fat frog lived in the river swim, O! A comely black crow lived on the river brim, O! ""Come on shore, come on shore,"" Said the crow to the frog, and then, O! ""No, you'll bite me, no, you'll bite me,"" Said the frog to the crow again, O!]2. ""O! there is sweet music on yonder green hill, O! And you shall be a dancer, a dancer in yellow, All in yellow, all in yellow."" Said the crow to the frog, and then, O! ""All in yellow, all in yellow,"" Said the frog to the crow again, O!3. ""Farewell, ye little fishes, that in the river swim, O! I'm going to be a dancer, a dancer in yellow."" ""O beware! O beware!"" Said the fish to the frog, and then, O! ""I'll take care, I'll take care,"" Said the frog to the fish again, O!4. The frog began a swimming, a swimming to land, O! And the crow began jumping to give him his hand, O! ""Sir, you're welcome, Sir, you're welcome,"" Said the crow to the frog, and then, O! ""Sir, I thank you, Sir, I thank you."" Said the frog to the crow, again, O!"
"5. ""But where is the sweet music on yonder green hill, O? And where are all the dancers, the dancers in yellow? All in yellow, all in yellow?"" Said the frog to the crow, and then, O! ""Sir, they're here, Sir, they're here."" Said the crow to the frog--[A]1. ""Oh, what have you got for dinner, Mrs. Bond?"" ""There's beef in the larder, and ducks in the pond;"" ""Dilly, dilly, dilly, dilly, come to be killed, For you must be stuffed, and my customers filled!""]2. ""John Ostler, go fetch me a duckling or two, John Ostler go fetch me a duckling or two; Cry dilly, dilly, dilly, dilly, come and be killed, For you must be stuffed, and my customers filled!""3. ""I have been to the ducks that are swimming in the pond, And they won't come to be killed, Mrs. Bond; I cried dilly, dilly, dilly, dilly, come and be killed, For you must be stuffed, and the customers filled!""4. Mrs. Bond she went down to the pond in a rage, With plenty of onions, and plenty of sage; She cried, ""Come, little wag-tails, come, and be killed. For you shall be stuffed, and my customers filled!""There was a jolly miller once Lived on the river Dee; He worked and sang from morn till night, No lark more blithe than he. And this the burden of his song For ever used to be, ""I care for nobody, no, not I, And nobody cares for me.""]2. The king was in his counting-house counting out his money; The queen was in the parlour eating bread and honey; The maid was in the garden hanging out her clothes, When up came a blackbird and pecked off her nose.1. Tom he was a piper's son, He learnt to play when he was young; But all the tunes that he could play Was ""Over the hills and far away."" Over the hills and a great way off, The wind shall blow my top-knot off.]1. 'Twas on a merry time, When Jenny Wren was young, So neatly as she danced, And so sweetly as she sung, Robin Redbreast lost his heart, He was a gallant bird, He doffed his cap to Jenny Wren, Requesting to be heard.2. ""My dearest Jenny Wren, If you will but be mine, You shall dine on cherry pie, And drink nice currant wine; I'll dress you like a gold-finch, Or like a peacock gay, So if you'll have me, Jenny, dear, Let us appoint the day.""]"
