passage
"Oh, Susan Blue, How do you do? Please may I go for a walk with you? Where shall we go? Oh, I know-- Down in the meadow where the cowslips grow! Little Blue Shoes Mustn't go Very far alone, you know Else she'll fall down, Or, lose her way; Fancy--what Would mamma say? Better put her little hand Under sister's wise command. When she's a little older grown Blue Shoes may go quite alone. Puff, puff, puff. How the trumpets blow All you little boys and girls come and see the show. One--two--three, the Cat runs up the tree; But the little Bird he flies away-- ""She hasn't got me!"" Oh, dear, how will it end? Peggy and Susie how naughty you are. You little know where you are, Going so far, and so high, Nearly up to the sky. Perhaps it's a Giant who lives there, And perhaps it's a lovely Princess. But you very well know You've no business to go; You'll get yourselves into a mess. Oh, dear, I'm sure it is true; Whatever on earth can it matter to you? For you know it--oh, fie-- That it's naughty to pry Into other's affairs-- Into other folks houses to go, Where you know You're not asked. So you'd better come back While there's time, it is plain. Go home--and be never So naughty again. Oh who'll give us Posies, And Garlands of Roses, To twine round our heads so gay? For here we come bringing You many good wishes to-day. From market--from market--from market-- We all come up from market. When you and I Grow up--Polly-- I mean that you and me, Shall go sailing in a big ship Right over all the sea. We'll wait till we are older, For if we went to-day, You know that we might lose ourselves, And never find the way. In September, when the apples were red, To Belinda I said, ""Would you like to go away To Heaven, or stay Here in this orchard full of trees All your life?"" And she said, ""If you please I'll stay here--where I know, And the flowers grow."" In my little Green House, quite content am I, When the hot sun pours down from the sky; For oh, I love the country--the beautiful country. Who'd live in a London street when there's the country? Oh, what shall my blue eyes go see? Shall it be pretty Quack-Quack to-day? Or the Peacock upon the Yew Tree? Or the dear little white Lambs at play? Say Baby. For Baby is such a young Petsy, And Baby is such a sweet Dear. And Baby is growing quite old now-- She's just getting on for a year."
