passage
"Rain, rain, rain! How it did rain! The great drops ran down the glass in streams. Tom, Jack, and lit-tle Meg watched it for a long time. ""O dear!"" they said at last, ""do you think it will nev-er clear? We want to go out and play.""That struck them as a fine plan; and off they trooped, pound-ing up the bare stairs with their nois-y feet. They found three old brooms, and be-gan to play soldier,--Tom first, then Jack, with Meg last of all. The gar-ret was ver-y large; and their mam-ma could hear them as they tramped a-long, and could hear Tom's com-mand to right a-bout face when they had reached the farth-er end.By and by they tired of play-ing sol-dier; and then they pulled down some old dress-es and hats that hung on a peg, and put them on, and made be-lieve that they were grown peo-ple. Then, out of an old box, they dragged a scrap-book full of pic-tures, and sat them down to look them o-ver. Sweet is the voice that calls From bab-bling wa-ter-falls In mead-ows where the down-y seeds are fly-ing, And soft the breez-es blow, And ed-dy-ing come and go, In fad-ed gar-dens where the rose is dy-ing Old Win-ter is com-ing; a-lack, a-lack! How i-cy and cold is he! He's wrapped to the heels in a snow-y white sack; The trees he has lad-en till read-y to crack; He whis-tles his trills with a won-der-ful knack, For he comes from a cold coun-tree. A fun-ny old fel-low is Win-ter, I trow, A mer-ry old fel-low for glee: He paints all the no-ses a beau-ti-ful hue, He counts all our fin-gers, and pinch-es them too; Our toes he gets hold of through stock-ing and shoe; For a fun-ny old fel-low is he. Old Win-ter is blow-ing his gusts a-long, And mer-ri-ly shak-ing the tree: From morn-ing to night he will sing us his song, Now moan-ing and short, now bold-ly and long; His voice it is loud, for his lungs are so strong, And a mer-ry old fel-low is he. Old Win-ter's a rough old chap to some, As rough as ev-er you'll see. ""I with-er the flow-ers when-ev-er I come, I qui-et the brook that went laugh-ing a-long, I drive all the birds off to find a new home I'm as rough as rough can be."" A cun-ning old fel-low is Winter, they say,-- A cun-ning old fel-low is he: He peeps in the crev-i-ces day by day, To see how we're pass-ing our time a-way, And mark all our do-ing from so-ber to gay; I'm a-fraid he is peep-ing at me!Off scam-pered the two girls to the hay-field. Soon Miss Gray fol-lowed, but there was noth-ing to be seen of them. She looked all a-bout, and at last walked up to the man who was load-ing the hay on the cart.Miss Gray turned a-way, when all at once she heard a laugh be-hind her. She looked back, and there were the laugh-ing fa-ces of Bell and Car-rie. They had been on the cart, all hid-den un-der the hay in or-der to play a lit-tle joke on Miss Gray. Then they scram-bled down, and came run-ning to her.The ver-y next day their mam-ma did take them. They found Ruth sit-ting pil-lowed up in a chair, ver-y pale and white. Bell had picked her a bunch of flow-ers, which she seemed ver-y glad to get; and the three girls soon be-came good friends. Car-ree found a lit-tle gray kitten with which she played."
"They came a-gain the ver-y next day. Miss Gray was with them, and car-ried a bas-ket on her arm in which were some dain-ties to tempt the sick girl's ap-pe-tite. She was glad to see them, and told them they should have the kit-ten for their ver-y own. So pus-sy went back in the bas-ket which had brought the dain-ties.Rob Jack-son's dog jumped off the lit-tle bridge in-to the mill pond to fetch a stick that Hal Jones threw for him. The wheel was in full mo-tion, and Jack, for that was the dog's name, was drawn in toward it. Rob was a-fraid that Jack was go-ing to be drowned and was just a-bout to jump in af-ter him, when one of the mill hands held him fast. ""Wait a bit,"" said the man, and he held out a long pole to Jack who clutched it with his teeth and was drawn safely to land. The merry boats of Brixham Go out to search the seas; A staunch and sturdy fleet are they, Who love a swinging breeze; And before the woods of Devon, And the silver cliffs of Wales, You may see, when summers evenings fall, The light upon their sails. But when the year grows darker, And gray winds hunt the foam, They go back to Little Brixham, And ply their toil at home. And thus it chanced one winter's night, When a storm began to roar, That all the men were out at sea, And all the wives on shore. Then as the wind grew fiercer, The women's cheeks grew white, It was fiercer in the twilight. And fiercest in the night. The strong clouds set themselves like ice, Without a star to melt, The blackness of the darkness Was darkness to be felt. The storm like an assassin Went on its wicked way, And struck a hundred boats adrift, To reel about the bay. They meet, they crash--God keep the men! God give a moment's light! There is nothing but the tumult, And the tempest and the night. The men on shore were anxious, They dreaded what they knew; What do you think the women did? Love taught them what to do! Out spake a wife, ""We've beds at home, We'll burn them for a light: Give us the men and the bare ground! We want no more to-night."" They took the grandame's blanket, Who shivered and bade them go; They took the baby's pillow, Who could not say them no; And they heaped a great fire on the pier, And knew not all the while If they were heaping a bonfire, Or only a funeral pile. And fed with precious food, the flame Shone bravely on the black, Till a cry rang through the people, ""A boat is coming back!"" Staggering dimly through the fog, Come shapes of fear and doubt, But when the first prow strikes the pier, Cannot you hear them shout? Then all along the breadth of flame Dark figures shrieked and ran, With ""Child, here comes your father!"" Or, ""Wife, is this your man?"" And faint feet touch the welcome stone, And wait a little while; And kisses drop from frozen lips, Too tired to speak or smile. So, one by one they struggled in, All that the sea would spare; We will not reckon through our tears The names that were not there; But some went home without a bed, When all the tale was told, Who were too cold with sorrow To know the night was cold. This is the picture of a kit-ten who lived once at a farm-house. He was such a pret-ty lit-tle cat as to be made a great pet and used to trot a-bout af-ter the peo-ple like a lit-tle dog. His name was A-grip-pa and he knew it quite well."
"To this farm-house came a boy and girl named Ned and Lau-ra, to spend the sum-mer. Both were fond of pets and both played so much with A-grip-pa that he grew rath-er la-zy and did not try to catch ma-ny mice.Ned and Lau-ra were ver-y good friends, but it happened now and then that both want-ed the same thing and then, sad to say, some loud words might be heard. Ned would say, ""Give me Grip-pa,"" and Lau-ra would an-swer, ""You shan't have Grip-pa!"" and Ned would say a-gain, ""I will have Grip-pa,"" and so it would go on till some-times poor Grip-pa would run a-way. But they al-ways made up and were friends a-gain.Grip-pa grew up a large, fine cat, and lived some years. But he was at length taken ill. He came no more to the house, but stayed in the barn and grew ver-y weak, till he could hard-ly walk. At last, one day he came walk-ing fee-bly to the house. He went in-to the kitch-en, then to the pan-try, then to the din-ing room. In-to all the rooms went Grip-pa, and in each room sat down and looked a-round, as if tak-ing a last fare-well; then slow-ly walked out of doors. It was in-deed his last vis-it. Next morn-ing poor Grip-pa was found dead. Frank More had been out skat-ing near-ly the whole af-ter-noon, for there was no school this week, and the ice was in fine or-der. It was al-most dark, and he was go-ing home, skates in hand, when a poor boy a-bout as large as him-self came up and be-gan to beg from him.The boy went glad-ly, and on the way Frank asked him ma-ny ques-tions. When they ar-rived, Frank took him to the kitch-en, where Jane the cook gave him a warm seat and plen-ty of sup-per, for his thin face made her feel sor-ry.""Don't you think, fa-ther,"" he said, ""that grand-pa would like such a boy? He says he will be glad to work, and if moth-er will let me give him my old suit, I can take him to see grand-pa in the morning.""""Well, Frank, you may try,"" said his fa-ther. So poor Sam had a good bed to sleep in that night, and next morn-ing the two boys went to see a-bout work for him. Dressed in the warm clothes Frank's moth-er gave him, he looked like quite a dif-fer-ent boy, and was ve-ry grate-ful for her kind-ness.It was soon set-tled that Sam should live at old Mr. More's. He had a good ma-ny things to do: to help take care of the chick-ens, the sheep and lambs, the cows and horses; and be-sides all this, he went to school, and with all the other boys, had great fun at coast-ing and skat-ing when school was out. But he worked as well as he played, and proved so trust-y, that grand-ma said: ""Frank's boy was a boy worth hav-ing."" Jo-ey Hart was a boy who was sent by his fath-er to spend the sum-mer with an un-cle in the coun-try. Jo-ey had been ill, and the doc-tor said that there was noth-ing like coun-try air to make him well a-gain.So he set off one bright morn-ing, and be-fore night was safe at his un-cle's farm. His pa-pa had thought that Jo-ey might go to school dur-ing the sum-mer, but when the doc-tor heard of it he said no. ""Let the boy run wild for three months. He will learn twice as fast next win-ter."""
