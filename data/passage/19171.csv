passage
"""Boisterous! Weren't you going to say--rude?"" laughingly asked the one who had first spoken. ""Come, now, 'fess up! Weren't you?"" and the shorter of the twain, a girl rather plump and pretty, with merry brown eyes, put her arm about the waist of her sister and endeavored to lead her through the maze of chairs in the whirl of a dance, whistling, meanwhile, a joyous strain from one of the latest Broadway successes.""You don't know what to make of me? That's it; isn't it, sister mine? Oh, I can read you like a book. But, Ruth, why aren't you jolly once in a while? Why always that 'maiden all forlorn' look on your face? Why that far-away, distant look in your eyes--'Anne, Sister Anne, dost see anyone approaching?' Talk about Bluebeard! Come on, do one turn with me. I'm learning the one-step, you know, and it's lovely!""Come on, laugh and sing! Really, aren't you glad that dad has an engagement at last? A real engagement that will bring in some real money! Aren't you glad? It will mean so much to us! Money! Why, I haven't seen enough real money of late to have a speaking acquaintance with it. We've been trusted for everything, except carfare, and it would have come to that pretty soon. Say you're glad, Ruth!""The younger girl gave up the attempt to entice her sister into a dance, and stood facing her, arm still about her waist, the laughing brown eyes gazing mischievously up into the rather sad blue ones of the taller girl.""You have a queer way of showing your gladness,"" commented the other drily, shrugging her shapely shoulders. ""Why, I can hardly keep still. La-la-la-la! La-la-la-la! La-la-la!"" She hummed the air of a Viennese waltz song, meanwhile whirling gracefully about with extended arms, her dress floating about her balloonwise."
"""There, dear!"" she said in consoling tones. ""Of course you couldn't help it. Don't worry. Daddy won't mind when you tell him you were just doing a little waltz of happiness because he has an engagement at last.""""I don't care!"" announced Alice, finally, as she sank into a chair. ""I'll tell dad myself. I'm glad, anyhow, even if the vase is broken. I never liked it. I don't see why dad set such store by the old thing.""""Am I, really?"" and in delight the younger girl sprang up, her grief over the vase for the moment forgotten. ""Am I really like her, Ruth? I'm so glad! Tell me more of her. I scarcely remember her. I was only seven when she died, Ruth.""""Oh, I'm so glad. Now we can go to a play once in a while--I'm almost starved for the sight of the footlights, and to hear the orchestra tuning up. And you know, while he had no engagement dad wouldn't let us take advantage of his professional privilege, and present his card at the box office.""""It was so!"" affirmed the other. ""Why, you must have read of it dozens of times in those novels you're always poring over. The hero and heroine on a raft--she looks up into his eyes and sighs. 'Have another morsel of boot soup, darling!' Why, the time dad had to use the money he had half promised me for that charmeuse, and we bought the supper at the delicatessen--you know, when Mr. Blake stopped and you asked him to stay to tea, when there wasn't a thing in the house to eat--do you remember that?""""Of course it was just the same,"" explained the younger girl, merrily. ""There was nothing fit to give Mr. Blake, and I took the money that was to have been paid for my charmeuse, and slipped out to Mr. Dinkelspatcher's--or whatever his name is--and bought a meal. Well, we ate my dress, that's all, Ruth."""
"""And we must save that, I suppose, until dad gets some salary, which won't be for a time yet. And we really ought to celebrate in some way, now that he's had this bit of good luck! Oh, isn't it just awful to be poor!""""I don't care if they do hear. They all know dad hasn't had a theatrical engagement for ever so long. And they know we haven't any what you might call--resources--or we wouldn't live here. Of course they know we're poor--that's no news!""""I'm glad of it. Oh, Ruth, when will you ever give up trying to pretend we are what we are not? You're a dear, nice, sweet, romantic sister, and some day I hope the Fairy Prince will come riding past on his milk-white steed--and, say, Ruth, why should a prince always ride a milk-white steed? There's something that's never been explained.""All the novels and fairy stories have milk-white steeds for the hero to prance up on when he rescues the doleful maiden. And if there's any color that gets dirtier sooner, and makes a horse look most like a lost hope, it's white. Of course I know they can keep a circus horse milk-white, but it isn't practical for princes or heroes. The first mud puddle he splashed through--And, oh, say! If the prince should fail in his fortunes later, and have to hire out to drive a coal wagon! Wouldn't his milk-white steed look sweet then? There goes one now,"" and she pointed out of the window to the street below.Their door swung open, for someone had seemingly caught at the knob to save himself from falling. The girls had a glimpse of their neighbor across the hall, Russ Dalwood by name, pushing a strange man toward the head of the stairs. The portal was closed with a bang--so closed because Alice in a mad rush threw herself against it and turned the key in the lock. Then she gained a place by her sister's side, and slipped an arm about her waist.""I don't know,"" Alice made answer. ""I don't believe he meant to come in here. It was--was just an accident. But the door is locked now. Maybe it was some collector--like those horrid men who have been to see us lately. The Dalwoods may be short of money, too.""""Let's slip down the back stairs to Mrs. Reilley's flat. She has a telephone, and we can call the police,"" suggested the taller girl, in a hoarse whisper, her eyes never leaving the hall door that had been so unceremoniously thrust open."
"""She wouldn't be a bit afraid, if what you tell me of her is true!"" insisted Alice, stoutly. ""And I'm not a bit afraid, either. Why, Russ is just across the hall, and it was only the other day you were saying how strong and manly he was. Have you forgotten?""""Then don't be a silly. I'm not going down and ask Mrs. Reilley to 'phone for the police. That would cause excitement indeed. I don't believe anyone else heard the commotion, and that was only because our door flew open by accident.""""Oh, well, maybe it will be all right,"" assented the taller girl who, in this emergency, seemed to lean on her younger sister. Perhaps it was because Alice was so merry-hearted--even unthinking at times; despising danger because she did not know exactly what it was--or what it meant. Yet even now Ruth felt that she must play the part of mother to her younger sister.""Positive! See, I'll slip on the chain, and then it would tax even a policeman to get in. But, really, Ruth, I wouldn't go to Mrs. Reilley's if I were you. She'll tell everyone, and there doesn't seem to be any need. It's all over, and those below, or above us, seem to have heard nothing of it.""""So do I, for that matter. That's sensible. What did he say,"" asked Alice, ""when you went down to Mrs. Reilley's telephone to talk to him?"" For that neighbor had summoned one of the girls when she learned, over the wire, that Mr. DeVere wished to speak with his daughters about his good fortune.""Well, I suppose he'll come as quickly as he can. Let's see what we can get up in the way of a lunch. We may have to resort to the delicatessen again. I do want father to have something nice when he comes home with his good news.""""So do I,"" agreed Ruth. ""I'm afraid our ice box doesn't contain much in the way of refreshments for an impromptu banquet, though, and I positively won't go out after--after what happened. At least not right away!""In fact since the DeVere family had come to make their home in the Fenmore Apartment House, on one of the West Sixtieth streets of New York City, there had been very little in the way of food luxuries, and not a great deal of the necessities.Their life had held a little more of ease and comfort when they lived in a more fashionable quarter, but with the loss of their father's theatrical engagement, and the long period of waiting for another, their savings had been exhausted and they had had recourse to the pawn shop, in addition to letting as many bills as possible go unpaid until fortune smiled again."
"Hosmer DeVere, who was a middle-aged, rather corpulent and exceedingly kind and cultured gentleman, was the father of the two girls. Their mother had been dead about seven years, a cold caught in playing on a draughty stage developing into pneumonia, from which she never rallied.Ruth and Alice came of a theatrical family--at least, on their father's side--for his father and grandfather before him had enviable histrionic reputations. Mrs. DeVere had been a vivacious country maid--or, rather, a maid in a small town that was classed as being on the ""country"" circuit by the company playing it. Mr. DeVere, then blossoming into a leading man, was in the troupe, and became acquainted with his future wife through the medium of the theater. She had sought an interview with the manager, seeking a chance to ""get on the boards,"" and Mr. DeVere admired her greatly.Their married life was much happier than the usual theatrical union, and under the guidance and instruction of her husband Mrs. DeVere had become one of the leading juvenile players. Both her husband and herself were fond of home life, and they had looked forward to the day when they could retire and shut themselves away from the public with their two little daughters.But fortunes are seldom made on the stage--not half as often as is imagined--and the time seemed farther and farther off. Then came Mrs. DeVere's illness and death, and for a time a broken-hearted man withdrew himself from the world to devote his life to his daughters.But the call of the stage was imperative, not so much from choice as necessity, for Mr. DeVere could do little to advantage save act, and in this alone could he make a living. So he had returned to the ""boards,"" filling various engagements with satisfaction, and taking his daughters about with him.Rather strange to say, up to the present, though literally saturated with the romance and hard work of the footlights, neither Ruth nor Alice had shown any desire to go on the stage. Or, if they had it, they had not spoken of it. And their father was glad.Mr. DeVere was a clever character actor, and had created a number of parts that had won favor. He inclined to whimsical comedy rôles, rather than to romantic drama, and several of his old men studies are remembered on Broadway to this day. He had acted in Shakespeare, but he had none of that burning desire, with which many actors are credited, to play Hamlet. Mr. DeVere was satisfied to play the legitimate in his best manner, to look after his daughters, and to trust that in time he might lay by enough for himself, and see them happily married.Then came a panicky year. Many theaters were closed, and more actors ""walked the Rialto"" looking for engagements than ever before. Mr. DeVere was among them, and he even accepted a part in a vaudeville sketch to eke out a scanty livelihood.Good times came again, but did not last, and finally it looked to the actor as though he were doomed to become a ""hack,"" or to linger along in some stock company. He was willing to do this, though, for the sake of the girls.A rather longer period of inactivity than usual made a decided change in the DeVere fortunes, if one can call a struggle against poverty ""fortunes."" They had to leave their pleasant apartment and take one more humble. Some of their choice possessions, too, went to the sign of the three golden balls; but, with all this, it was hard work to set even their scanty table. And the bills!Ruth wept in secret over them, being the house-keeper. And, of late, some of the tradesmen were not as patient and kind as they had been at first. Some even sent professional collectors, who used all their various wiles to humiliate their debtors."
"But now a ray of light seemed to shine through the gloom, and a tentative promise from one theatrical manager had become a reality. Mr. DeVere had telephoned that the contract was signed, and that he would have a leading part at last, after many weeks of idleness. For a moment the girls faced each other with wide-opened eyes, the brown ones of Alice gazing into the deep blue ones of Ruth. Ruth's eyes were not the ordinary blue--like those of a china doll. They were more like wood-violets, and in their depths could be read a liking for the unusual and romantic that was, in a measure, the key to her character. Not for nothing had Alice laughed at her sister's longing for a prince, on a milk-white steed, to come riding by. Ruth was tall, and of that desirable willowy type, so much in demand of late.Alice was just saved from being a ""bread-and-butter"" girl. That is, she had wholesomeness, with a round face, and ruddy cheeks--more damask than red in color--but she also had a rollicking, good-natured disposition, without being in the least bit tomboyish. She reminded one of a girl just out of school, eager for a game of tennis or golf.The DeVeres had only known their neighbors across the hall since coming to the Fenmore Apartment. Yet one could not live near motherly Mrs. Sarah Dalwood and not get to know her rather intimately, in a comparatively short time. She was what would have been called, in the country, ""a good neighbor."" In New York, with its hurry and scurry, where people live for years in adjoining rooms and never speak, she was an unusual type. She knew nearly every one in the big apartment--which was almost more than the janitor and his wife could boast.A widow with two sons, Mrs. Dalwood was in fairly good circumstances--compared with her neighbors. Her husband had left her a little sum in life insurance that was well invested, and Russ held a place as moving picture machine operator in one of the largest of those theaters. He earned a good salary which made it unnecessary for his mother to go out to work, or to take any in, and his brother Billy was kept at school. Billy was twelve, a rather nervous, delicate lad, liked by everyone.There was a rattle as the chain fell from the slotted slide on the door, and Alice opened the portal, to disclose the smiling and yet rather worried face of Russ. The girls had come to know him well enough to call him by his first name, and he did the same to them. It might not be out of place to say that Russ admired Ruth very much.""I'm awfully sorry about what happened,"" began Russ. ""You see I didn't mean to shove that fellow so hard. But he was awfully persistent, and I just lost my temper. I was afraid I'd shoved him downstairs.""""Indeed he did not,"" replied Russ. ""He caught at your door to save himself from falling. I guess he thought I was going to hit him; but I wasn't. I just shoved him away to keep him from coming back into our rooms again. Mother was a little afraid of him."""
"""He was a fellow who's trying to steal a patent I'm working on!"" exclaimed Russ, rather fiercely. ""He's as unscrupulous as they come, and I didn't want him to get a foothold. So I just sent him about his business in a way I think he won't forget.""""Well, it is something about machinery,"" admitted Russ. ""It is something new to go on moving picture machines, to steady the film as it moves behind the lens. You've often noticed how jerky the pictures are at times?"" he asked.""Well, I've made a simple little device that fits on the machine. I needn't go into all details--to tell you the truth I haven't got 'em all worked out yet; but I think it will be a good thing, and bring me in some money.""I've spoken to Mr. Frank Pertell, manager of the Comet Film Company, about it. I have done some work for him, you know. He says it will be a good thing, and, while it may not make me a millionaire, it will help a lot. So I'm working hard on it.""""He didn't have anything to do with it--but he wanted to. His name is Simpson Wolley--Simp, he's called for short, though he is not as simple as his name sounds. He heard about my invention--how, I don't know--and he's trying to get it away from me.""""Yes. He came to me and wanted me to sell him the rights, just as it was, for a certain sum. I refused. Then to-day I came home unexpectedly. I found him in the room where I work, looking over my drawings and models. Mother had let him in to wait for me. She put him in the parlor, but he sneaked into my room. That's why I sent him flying.""""Oh, you need not worry,"" Russ assured her. ""He won't come here again; though I don't fancy I'm through with him. Simp Wolley hasn't much principle, and I know a lot of fellows who have done business with him to their sorrow. But he'll have to work hard to fool me. So my apology is accepted; is it?"""
"""I couldn't come sooner,"" the latter explained in his deep, mellow voice--a voice that had endeared him to many audiences. ""We had to arrange about the rehearsals. Haven't you a kiss for dad, Ruth"" he went on, putting his arms about the taller girl. ""How are you, Russ?"" and he nodded cordially. ""Isn't it fine to have two such daughters as these?"" He held them to him--one on either side.""Never mind, better days are coming,"" said the actor. ""At last I have a part just suited to me--one of the best for which I have ever been cast. It's with the 'A Matter of Friendship' company, and we open in about three weeks at the New Columbia. I feel sure I'll make a hit, and the play is a very good one--I may say a fine one.""""Yes; or, rather, in two weeks from to-night. There are two weeks' rehearsals. But what--oh, I see. You mean there won't be any money coming in for three weeks--or until after the play has run a week. Well, never mind. I dare say we will manage somehow. I can likely get an advance on my salary. I'll see. And now for lunch. I'm as hungry as a stranded road company. What have you?""""Excuse this interruption,"" the young moving picture operator began, ""but mother sent over to ask if you wouldn't take dinner with us. We have a big one. We expected my uncle and aunt, and they've disappointed us. Do come!""""Mother will be disappointed if you don't come,"" urged Russ. ""She has chicken and biscuit for dinner, and she rather prides herself on it. The dinner will be spoiled if it isn't eaten hot--especially the biscuit, so she'll take it as a favor if you'll come over, and take the places of my uncle and aunt. Do come!"" and he looked earnestly at Ruth."
"""Well, it's the truth!"" insisted the merry girl, her brown eyes dancing with mischief. ""Russ knows we aren't millionaires, and with papa out of an engagement so long--oh, chicken! Come on. I haven't tasted any in so long----""As usual in theatrical companies, no salaries were paid while ""A Matter of Friendship"" was being rehearsed. Neither Mr. DeVere, nor any of the company, received any money for those two weeks of hard work. Those actors or actresses who had nothing put by lived as best they could on the charity of others. It was indeed ""a matter of friendship"" that some of them lived at all. And for a week after the play opened they could expect nothing. Then if the play should be a failure----How he and his family lived those two weeks none but themselves knew. They had pawned all they dared, until their flat was quite bare of needed comforts. Tradesmen were insistent, and one man in particular threatened to have Mr. DeVere arrested if his bill was not paid. But it was out of the question to meet it. What little money was on hand was needed for food, and there was little enough of that.Mr. DeVere did negotiate some small loans, but not enough to afford permanent relief. Perhaps motherly Mrs. Dalwood suspected, or Russ may have hinted at their neighbors' straits, for many a nourishing dish was sent to Ruth and Alice, on the plea that there was more of it than Mrs. Dalwood and her sons could eat. Startled and alarmed the two girls hastened to the side of their father. They flitted helplessly about him for a moment, like pretty, distressed birds. As for Mr. DeVere, his hand went to his aching throat as though to clutch the malady that had so suddenly gripped him, and tear it out. For none realized as keenly as he what the attack meant. It was as though some enemy had struck at his very life, for to him his voice was his only means of livelihood.""Can't you see he can't speak!"" exclaimed Alice, a bit sharply. She had a better grasp of the situation in this emergency than had her sister. ""Something has happened to him! Was it dust in your throat on the street?"" asked Alice. ""Don't answer--wait, Dad! I have some lozenges. I'll get them for you!"""
"She was in and out of her room on the instant, with a box of troches, one of which she held out to her father. He had not moved since sinking into the chair, but stared straight ahead--and the future that he saw was not a pleasant one to contemplate.""Take this, Father,"" begged Alice, slipping her arm about him, as she sank to the floor at his feet. ""This will help your throat. Don't you remember what a terrible cold I had? These helped me a lot. Take one!""Mr. DeVere shook his head slightly, and seemed about to refuse the lozenge. But a glance at his daughters' worried faces evidently made him change his mind. He slipped the tablet into his mouth, and then straightened up in his chair. Whatever happened to him he knew he must make a brave fight for the sake of the girls. It would not do to show the white feather before them, even though his heart was quaking with the terrible fear that had come upon him.""I know just how it is,"" went on Alice, and her tone did as much as anything to relieve the strain they were all under. ""I caught cold once, and I got hoarse so suddenly that I was afraid I was going to be terribly ill. But it passed off in a day or two. Yours will, Dad!""""I'll slip over and ask Mrs. Dalwood the name of a good doctor,"" offered Alice. ""It's too bad we can't pay Dr. Haldon, but we will as soon as we can. Mrs. Dalwood may know of a good throat specialist nearby.""Alice fairly flew across the hall, and the tragic little story was soon told. Mrs. Dalwood, fortunately, did know of a good doctor in the vicinity. He had attended Billy several times, and, while not exactly a throat specialist, was to be depended upon.It was rather anxious waiting for the physician, but when he came his cheery, breezy presence seemed to fill them all with hope. He took Mr. DeVere into a room by himself, and made a careful examination. The girls could hear the young doctor's sharp, quick questioning, and their father's hoarse, mumbled replies. Then followed a period of nervous silence, broken by more talk.""Oh, that isn't half as bad as it sounds!"" laughed Dr. Rathby. ""I have had cases worse than this. Now, I'll leave you some medicine to be used in an atomizer, as a spray, Mr. DeVere, and I want you--in fact as a doctor I order you--to speak as little as possible. Don't use your voice at all, if you can help it--at least not for several days."""
"""A week? No! I have been 'resting' enough weeks as it is. I must go on with this. I've had it before. It has passed away. Can't you give me something that will enable me to go on--some medicine that will act quickly? I must be at rehearsal to-morrow.""""Well, if you have to--you have to, I suppose,"" he said. ""I understand. I can give you an astringent mixture that will shrink the chords, and may relieve some of the inflammation. It may enable you to go on--but at the risk of permanent injury to your throat.""""Never mind!"" responded Mr. DeVere, hoarsely. ""I--I must risk the future for the sake of the present. I cannot give up this engagement. I must keep on with the rehearsals. Give me something speedy, if you please, Doctor. I'll--I'll have to take the chance.""""I am sorry,"" spoke Dr. Rathby. ""But of course I understand. I have a mixture that some singers have used with good effect. I'll try it on you. You can use it several times to-night, and on your way to rehearsal stop in at my office in the morning, and I'll swab out your throat. That may help some.""""I'll get it filled,"" offered Ruth, and she could hardly keep back a sigh as she looked at the scanty supply of money in the household purse. As she was going out to the drug store she met Russ in the hallway.Mr. DeVere seemed better when Ruth got back with the medicine. And when his throat was sprayed he could talk with less effort. But his tones were still very husky, and it was evident that unless there was a great improvement in the morning he would hardly be able to go to rehearsal."
"Mr. DeVere spoke little the next morning. Perhaps he did not want his daughters to know how very hoarse his voice was. He left for the doctor's before going to the theater, and most anxiously did the girls await his return. For a few moments the two girls said nothing. They simply stood there, looking at their father, who was bowed with grief. It was something new for him--a strange rôle, for usually he was so jolly and happy--going about reciting odd snatches from the plays in which he had taken part.""Well, it did yesterday--very suddenly. But this time I was hoarse when I started to rehearse and it kept getting worse until I couldn't be heard ten feet away. Of course it was no use to go on then, so the stage manager called me off.""""For a few minutes--yes. But as soon as I got to the theater I was as bad as ever. I had some of his spray with me, too, but it did little good. I think I must see him again. I'll go to his office now.""""Now, don't be frightened,"" went on the doctor quickly, seeing their alarm. ""This may not be at all serious. There is a good chance of Mr. DeVere getting his voice back; but I confess I see little hope of it at the present time. At any rate he must give himself absolute rest, and not use his voice--even to talk to you girls,"" and he smiled at them.""Yes, only a chance. It would be cruel to deceive you, and try to tell you that this is only temporary, and will pass off. It may, but it is sure to come back again, unless you give your throat an absolute rest.""His daughters knew the reason. Times were but little better than they had been in the theatrical business. Many good men and women, too, were out of engagements, and every available part was quickly snapped up. Mr. DeVere had waited long enough for this opening, and now to have to put on an understudy when the play was on the eve of opening, might mean the loss of his chances. Theatrical managers were uncertain at best, and an actor in an important part, with a voice that would not carry beyond the first few rows, was out of the question.""I'll tell you what I'll do,"" went on Dr. Rathby. ""I'll speak to your manager myself. I'll explain how things are, and say it is imperative that you have one or two days of rest. It may be that your chords will clear up enough in that time so that I can treat them better and you can resume your duties."""
"""Will you do that?"" cried the actor, eagerly. ""It will be awfully good of you. Just say to Mr. Gans Cross--he's the manager of the New Columbia theater--that I will be back in two days--less, if you will allow me, Doctor.""""I have good news for you. He agreed to use an understudy for two days. He said you were letter-perfect in the part, anyway, and it was the others who really needed the rehearsing. So now we have two full days in which to do our best. And in that time I want you to talk the deaf and dumb language,"" laughed Dr. Rathby.Then began a two-days' warfare against the throat ailment. Ruth and Alice were untiring in attendance on their father. They saw to it that he used the medicine faithfully, and they even got pads and pencils that he might write messages to them instead of speaking.On his part the actor was faithful. He did not use his voice at all, and on the second day Dr. Rathby said there was some improvement. He was not very enthusiastic, however, and when Mr. DeVere asked if he could attend rehearsals next day the doctor said:He went to the rehearsal, and the worst fears of the physician were realized. After the first act Mr. DeVere was hoarser than ever before. The other players could not hear him to get their ""cues,"" or signals when to reply, and come on the stage. The rehearsal had to be stopped. There was a hasty conference between the manager of the company and the treasurer of the same.""Is to replace me. I know. You can't help it, Mr. Cross. I know just how it is. It isn't your fault--it's my misfortune. I thank you for your patience. You'll have to--to replace me. It's the only thing to do. And yet,"" he added so softly that the manager did not hear ""what am I to do? What are my daughters to do?"""
"""They couldn't wait, Alice, my dear,"" explained Mr. DeVere. ""Cross did all he could for me, and allowed me two days. But it is out of the question. Dr. Rathby was right. I need a long rest--and I guess I'll have to take it whether I want to or not.""""Now don't worry, girls. There'll be some way out of this. If I can't act I can do something else. I'm well and strong, for which I must be thankful. I'm not ill and, aside from my voice, nothing is the matter. I'll look for a place doing something else beside stage work, until my voice is restored. Then I'll take up my profession again. Come, there is nothing to worry about.""There was--a-plenty; but he chose to ignore it for the time being. He knew, as well as did the girls, that there was little money left, and that pressing bills must soon be met. Added to them, now, would be one from the physician and Mr. DeVere would need more medical attention.""Oh I'll be careful,"" her father promised. ""I'll take along a pad and pencil, and pretend to be dumb. But I'll speak if it's absolutely necessary. Now that there is no particular object in holding myself for the place in 'A Matter of Friendship,' and with the strain of rehearsal over, I won't be so afraid of talking. Yes, in the morning I'll start out.""""Never mind, don't you worry. Perhaps it will come out all right, after all. Father may get a place. He knows many persons in the theatrical business, and if he can't get behind the footlights he may get a place in front--in the box office, or something like that.""""Oh, don't worry. I won't cause any sensation. But I'm going to do something. There's no use in two strong, healthy girls sitting around, and letting poor old daddy, with a voice like a crow's, doing all the work and worrying.""""That's it!"" exclaimed Alice, petulantly. ""Girls ought to be brought up able to do something so they could earn their living if they had to, instead of sitting around doing embroidery or tinkling on the piano. I wouldn't know even how to clerk in a store if I had to."""
"""Well, what else is there to be done?"" asked the younger girl, fiercely. ""We've got to live. We've got to have a place to stay, and we've got to pay the bills that are piling up. Can you think of anything else to do?""""I'm not going to wait for it. I'm not like Mr. Micawber. I'm going out and turn up something for myself. There's one thing I can do, and that's manicure. I could get a place at that, maybe,"" and Alice looked at her pretty and well-kept nails, while Ruth glanced at her own hands.""Well, what can I do? I must do something. Poor daddy's voice has failed utterly. He can't take his new part in the play unless he does it in pantomime, and I'm afraid that would hardly be the thing. He simply can't speak his lines, though he can act them.""""Then the movies is the very place for him! He won't have to say a word--just move his lips. He can act parts in photoplays as well as if he never had a voice. I just thought of it. It will be the very thing he can do. Say, I'm glad I met you. We must get busy with this at once.""Come on! I'm on my way now to see about my new patent, and I can take you to the manager of the film company. I know him well. I'm sure he'll give your father a place in the company, and it pays well. If Mr. DeVere can't act at the New Columbia he can in the movies! Come on!"" Filled with enthusiasm over his new project for aiding Mr. DeVere, Russ Dalwood caught Alice by the hand, and guided her steps with his. She had been about to turn off at a corner, to carry out her intention of seeking employment in one of the many manicure parlors on a certain street. Now she hesitated."
"""And, if you like, we'll go back and get Ruth. Maybe that would be better!"" he exclaimed eagerly, and as Alice looked into his honest gray eyes she read his little secret, and smiled at him understandingly.""Oh, never that!"" she cried gaily. ""Ruth would be the last one in the world to be let into this secret, until it is more assured of success. Besides, I guess when you walk with Ruth you don't want me,"" she challenged.""No, really, Russ,"" she said earnestly enough now, and her eyes took on a more grave and serious look. ""It isn't that. It's only--well, I might as well tell you, though it may be rather mean after your kindness. But my father thinks the movies are so--so vulgar! There--I've said it.""""Nothing like that!"" he assured her. ""I've heard worse things than that said about the movies. But I want to tell you that you're wrong, and, with all due respect to him, your father is wrong too. There's nothing vulgar or low about the movies--except the price.""""I'm not saying that because I make my living at them, either,"" Russ went on. ""It's because it's true. The moving picture shows were once, perhaps, places where nice persons didn't go. But it's different now. All that has been changed. Why, look at Sarah Bernhardt, doing her famous plays before the camera? Even Andrew Carnegie consented to give one of his speeches in front of the camera, with a phonograph attachment, the other day.""""He certainly did. And a lot of the best actors and actresses in this and other countries aren't ashamed to be seen in the movies. They're glad to do it, and glad to get the money, too, I guess,"" he added, with a grin.""I think it would be the very thing for your father. Of course, if his voice had held out he might like it better to be an actor on the real stage. But in the movies he won't have to talk. He'll just have to act. Then, when his voice gets better, as I hope it will, he can take up the legitimate again."""
"""They're not common!"" defended Russ, sturdily. ""The moving pictures are getting better and better all the while. Of course some poor films are shown, but they're gradually being done away with. The board of censorship is becoming more strict.""Common! Why do you know that it costs as much as $20,000, sometimes, to stage one of the big plays--one with lots of outdoor scenes in it, burning buildings, railroad accidents made to order, and all that.""""That's right!"" exclaimed Russ. ""I'm just at the beginning of the business. I've learned the projecting end of it so far. Almost anyone can put the film in the machine, switch on the light, get the right focus and turn the handle. But it's harder to film a real drama with lots of excitement in it--outdoor stuff--cattle stampeded--the sports of cowboys--a fake Indian fight; it takes lots of grit to stand up in front of an oncoming troop of horsemen, and snap them until they get so close you can see the whites of their eyes. Then if they turn at the right time--well and good. But if there's a slip, and they ride into you--good-night! Excuse my slang,"" he added, hastily.""Well, if not that, something near enough like it. I've heard the operators--those who take the negatives--tell of 'em many a time. That's what I'm going to be soon--a taker of the moving picture plays instead of just projecting them on the screen. Mr. Pertell has promised to give me a chance. He's organizing some new companies.""Who, Simp Wolley? Oh, yes, he's been sneaking around after me, and I told him what I thought of him. He's got another fellow in with him--Bud Brisket--and he's about the same type. But I'm not going to worry about it.""""Thanks, I'll be careful. But just now I'm interested in getting your father to take up this work. I know he'll like it, once he tries it. Won't you come and see the manager? I'm sure he'll give your father a trial."""
"""Yes, Russ, I will, and I thank you! I told Ruth I was going to do something, and I am. If father can get an engagement I won't have to go to work. Not that I'm ashamed to work--I love it!"" she added hastily. ""But I wouldn't like to be a public manicurist, and that's the only situation that seemed open to me. I will go see your manager, Russ, and I'll do my best to get father to take up this work. It's quite different from what I thought it was.""Soon they found themselves before a rather bare brick building. It had nothing of the look of a theater about it. There were no gaudy lithographs out in front, no big frames with the pictures of the actors and actresses, or of scenes from the plays. There was no box office--no tiled foyer. It might have been a factory. Alice's face must have shown the surprise she felt, for Russ said:""This is where the films are made. It's all business here. They make the inside scenes here--anything from the interior of a miner's shack to a ballroom in a king's palace. Of course, for outside scenes they go wherever the scenery best suits the story of the play. And here the film negatives are developed, and duplicate positives made for the projecting machines. This is Mr. Pertell's principal factory.""If Alice was surprised at the exterior appearance of the building the interior was more bewildering. They passed rapidly through the departments devoted to the mechanical end of the business--where the films were developed and printed. Russ promised to show her more of that later.Alice looked about the big room, that seemed filled with all sorts of scenery, parts of buildings, rustic bridges--in short, all sorts of ""props."" She had been behind the scenes often in some of the plays in which her father took part, so this was not startlingly new to her. Yet it was different from the usual theatre.And such strange ""business"" seemed going on. There were men and women going through plays--Alice could tell that, but the odd part of it was that in one section of the room what seemed a tragedy in a mountain log cabin was being enacted; while, not ten feet away, was a parlor scene, showing men in evening dress, and women in ball costumes, gliding through the mazes of a waltz. Next to this was a scene representing a counterfeiter's den in some low cellar, with the police breaking through the door with drawn revolvers, to capture the criminals.And in front of these varied scenes stood a battery of queer cameras--moving picture cameras, looking like flat fig boxes with a tube sticking out, and a handle on one side, at which earnest-faced young men were vigorously clicking."
"And so it went on, in the glaring light that filtered in through the roof, composed wholly of skylights, while a battery of arc lamps, in addition, on some of the scenes, poured out their hissing glare to make the taking of the negatives more certain.Alice was enthralled by it all. She stood close to Russ's side, clasping his arm. Many of the men engaged in taking the pictures knew the young operator, and nodded to him in friendly fashion, as they hurried about. Some of the actors and actresses, too, bowed to the young fellow and smiled. He seemed a general favorite. Alice liked the appearance of Mr. Pertell, manager of the Comet Film Company, from her first glimpse of him. He seemed so sturdy, kind and wholesome. He was in his shirt sleeves, and his clothing was in almost as much disorder as his ruffled hair. But there was a kindly gleam in his snapping eyes, and a firm look about his mouth that showed his character.""Oh, hello, Russ; is that you?"" was the cordial greeting. ""How is the patent? I could use it if I had it now. Spare a minute? Yes, several of 'em. They've spoiled that one act and it's got to be done over. I don't see why they can't do as they're told instead of injecting a lot of new business into the thing! I've got to sit still and do nothing now for ten minutes while they fix that scene up over again. Go ahead, Russ--what can I do for you?""He sat down on an overturned box, and motioned for Russ and Alice to occupy adjoining ones. Clearly there was not much ceremony about this manager. He was like others Alice had observed behind the scenes in real theatres, except that he did not appear so irascible.""This is Miss Alice DeVere,"" began Russ, ""and she has come to you about her father. He has lost his voice, and she and I think he might fit in some of your productions, where you don't need any talking.""""I will,"" Russ agreed, with a smile. And, while Alice looked at some of the other dramas being enacted before the clicking eyes of the cameras, her companion told how it had been planned to overcome the prejudice of Mr. DeVere and get him to try his art with the ""movies.""Alice was tremendously interested, and looked on with eager eyes as the actors and actresses enacted their rôles. Some of them spoke, now and then, as their lines required it, for it has been found that often audiences can read the lips of the players on the screen. But there was no need for any loud talking--in fact, no need of any at all--whispering would have answered. Indeed some actors find that they can do better work without saying a word--merely using gestures. Others, who have long been identified with the legitimate drama, find it hard to break away from the habit of years and speak their lines aloud."
"She looked at two girls--they did not seem much older than herself and Ruth, who were playing a scene in a ""society"" drama. They were both pretty, but Alice thought they were rather too flippant in manner when out of the scene. They laughed and joked with the other actors, and with the machine men.But the latter were too busy focusing their cameras, and getting all that went on in the scenes, to pay much attention to anything else. The least slip meant the spoiling of many feet of film, and while this in itself was not so expensive, it often meant the making of a whole scene over again at a great cost.""Well,"" Mr. Pertell said at length, ""I am greatly interested in Mr. DeVere. I know him to be a good actor, and I greatly regret his affliction. I think I can use him in some of these plays. Can he ride a horse--does he know anything about cowboy life, or miners?"" he asked Alice.""Thank you, so much!"" returned Alice, gratefully. ""I shall tell him, and--well, there's no use saying I'm sure he'll come,"" she went on with a shrug of her shoulders. ""It's going to be rather difficult to break this to him. It--it's so--different from what he has been used to.""Then, with many digressions, and in rather piece-meal manner, interrupting herself often to go back and emphasize some point she had forgotten, Alice told of her morning trip with Russ. She enlarged on the manner in which the moving pictures were made, until Ruth grew quite excited.""Not another word!"" exclaimed Mr. DeVere. ""I never would consent to acting in the moving pictures. I would not so debase my profession--a profession honored by Shakespeare. I never would consent to it. The movies! Never!"" Mr. DeVere sank into a chair. Ruth looked distressed as her father glanced over the dispossess notice, for such it was. But on the face of Alice there was a triumphant smile. For she saw that this was the very thing needed to arouse her father to action. Despite the distastefulness of the work, she felt sure he would come finally to like acting before the camera.""I--I could not do it,"" he added with a sigh. ""I must try to get something in the line of my profession. Perhaps I might get a place in some dramatic school. I have trained you girls in the rudiments of acting, and I'm sure I could do it with a larger class. I did not think of it before. Get me some lunch, Ruth, and I'll go out again."""
"She slipped out into the hall, and closed the door after her. There was a low murmur of voices, gradually growing louder on the part of the unseen caller. Ruth seemed pleading. Then Mr. DeVere and Alice heard:""I--I'll go at once and see Mr. Cross, my former manager,"" exclaimed Mr. DeVere. ""He will make me a loan, I'm sure. Then I'll pay this butcher bill, and tell the insulting fellow that we shall seek a new tradesman.""""Oh, yes--the rent. I forgot about that."" The dispossess notice rustled in his hand. ""The rent--Oh, yes. That must be paid first. I--I will have to get a larger loan. Well, get me what lunch you can, Ruth, my dear, and I'll go out at once.""Alice did not say ""movies"" again, not even when the very modest and frugal lunch was set. And it was about the ""slimmest"" meal, from a housekeeper's standpoint, that had ever graced the DeVere table, used as they had become to scanty rations of late. Mr. DeVere said little, but he appeared to be doing considerable thinking and Alice allowed him to do it without interruption. She seemed to know how, and when, to hold her tongue.When he had gone out Ruth and Alice talked matters over. First they counted up what money they had, and figured how far it would go. If they paid the rent they would not have enough to live on for a week, and food was almost as vital a necessity as was a place to stay. There were other pressing bills, in addition to those of the butcher and the landlord.""Why, yes. It's quite warm, with all those arc lights glowing, you know. And besides, what are shirt sleeves? Didn't dad act in his during the duel scene in ""Lord Graham's Secret?"" Of course he did! Shirt sleeves are no disgrace. Oh, Ruth, what are we to do, anyhow? What is to become of us?"""
"It was tedious waiting. The girls talked but little--they had no heart for it. Around them hummed the noise of the apartment house. Noises came to them through the thin, cheap walls. The crying of babies, the quarrels of a couple in the flat back of them, the wheeze of a rusty phonograph, and the thump-thump of a playerpiano, operated with every violation of the musical code, added to the nerve-racking din. Let it be said of Alice that, even in this moment of triumph, she did not gloat over her victory--for victory it was. Had she planned it, events could not have transpired to better purpose. The combination of circumstances had forced her father along the line of least resistance into the very path she would had chosen for him, and she felt in her soul that it was best.The girl was perhaps wiser than her years would indicate, and certainly in this matter she was more resourceful than was Ruth. But then chance had played into her hands. That meeting with Russ had done much.""But they can't act!"" asserted Mr. DeVere. ""I have seen bills up advertising the moving pictures--all they seemed to be doing--the so-called actors, I mean--was falling off horses, roping steers--I believe ""roping"" is the proper term--or else jumping off bridges or standing in the way of railroad trains. And they call that acting!""""Oh, you wouldn't have to do that, Daddy!"" cried Alice, with a laugh. ""Mr Pertell is putting on some real dramas--just like society plays, you know. Of course all the scenes won't take place in a parlor, I suppose. You won't have to do outdoor work, though, and I'm sure you won't have to catch a wild steer, or stop a runaway locomotive.""""But that is real acting, all the same,"" went on Alice. In that little while she had come to have a great liking and interest in the moving picture side of acting. ""You should see some of the scenes I saw. Why, Daddy, some of the men and women were just as good as some of the actors with whom you have been on the road.""""Oh, yes, if you include the road companies of the barn-storming days, perhaps,"" admitted Mr. DeVere. ""But I refer to the real art of the drama, Alice. However, let us not discuss it. The subject is too painful. I have decided to take up the work, since I can do nothing else on account of my unfortunate voice--and I will do my best in the movies. It is due to myself that I should, and it is due to you girls that I provide for you in any way that I can."""
"""Tut! Tut!"" he exclaimed, smiling and holding up a chiding hand. ""I don't look at it that way at all. I am not so foolish. Art may be a very nice thing, but bread and butter is better. We have to live, my dear. And, after all, my art is not so wonderful. I hope I have not exaggerated my worth to myself. I am very willing to try this new line, and I am very glad that Alice suggested it. Only it--it was rather a shock--at first. Now let us consider.""""It is an advance on my salary as a moving picture actor,"" he replied, hoarsely, but still with that same gay air. ""See, I have put my other life behind me. Henceforth--or at least until my voice promises to behave,"" he went on, ""I shall live, move and have my being on the screen. I have signed a contract with Mr. Pertell--a very fair contract, too, much more so than some I have signed with managers of legitimate theaters. This is part of my first week's salary. I have taken his money--there is no going back now. I have burned my bridges.""""Oh, yes. He seemed very anxious to play Shakespeare,"" remarked Alice, with a smile. ""I heard Mr. Pertell caution him about not letting Hamlet get into the parlor scene they were presenting,"" and she laughed at the recollection.""Of course it was rather new and strange to me,"" went on Mr. DeVere, ""but I dare say I shall get accustomed to it. There were some of the young ladies, though, for whom I felt no liking--Miss Pearl Pennington, who plays light leads, and her friend, Miss Laura Dixon, the ingenue.""""Passably so,"" agreed Mr. DeVere. ""Well, our living problem is solved for us, anyway. Now I must study my new part. It is to be a sort of society drama, and will be put on in a few days. Mr. Pertell gave me some instructions. I shall have to unlearn many things that are traditional with those who have played all their parts in a real theatre. It is like teaching an old dog new tricks, but I dare say I shall master them."""
"""There--there!"" he returned, indulgently, ""don't try to flatter your old father. You are just like your dear mother. Run along now, I must take up this new work. What a relief not to have to declaim my lines! I shall only move my lips, and who knows but, in time, my voice may come back?""The meal was a great success--not only from a gastronomic standpoint, but because of the jollity--real or assumed--of Mr. DeVere. He went over the lines of his new part, telling the girls how at certain places he was to ""register,"" or denote, different emotions. ""Register"" is the word used in moving picture scenarios to indicate the showing of fear, hate, revenge or other emotion. All this must be done by facial expression or gestures, for of course no talking comes from the moving pictures--except in the latest kind, with a phonographic arrangement, and with that sort we are not dealing.""Oh, no!"" protested her sister. ""But let's sit down. The meal is spoiling. Oh!"" she cried, with a hasty glance at the table. ""Not a bit of salt. I forgot it. Alice, dear, just slip across the hall and borrow some from Mrs. Dalwood.""""Oh, excuse me,"" murmured Alice, but even in her embarrassment she could not help thinking that the man looked like anything but a plumber. She backed out of the kitchen, after picking up a salt cellar, and was more startled as she observed the man following her. Alice was racking her brain to recall where she had seen the man before. If he was a plumber, as he said he was, it might be that he had been in the apartment house on other occasions to repair breaks. But Alice was not certain.""We can't tell until Russ comes home,"" replied her father. ""I'll leave our door ajar, and we can hear if anyone goes into the Dalwood rooms. As soon as some of them return we will tell them what has taken place.""Alice helped herself to the needed salt, and the meal began, with pauses now and then to learn if there was any movement in the flat across the hallway. Presently footsteps were heard, and proved to be those of Russ himself."
"""Plumber!"" he exclaimed. ""So he was masquerading as that; eh?"" the moving picture operator exclaimed when Alice told him what had occurred. ""You're right, he was after my patent,"" and a worried look came over his face.""Yes--and no,"" returned Russ. ""It's all right, for the time being, but I don't like what has happened. Simp Wolley must be getting desperate to come here in broad daylight and rummage the house under the pretense of being a plumber. It shows, too, that he must be watching this place, or he wouldn't have known when I went out.""""I'll think about it,"" agreed Russ. ""Of course he hasn't really done anything yet that they could arrest him for, unless coming into our apartment without being invited is illegal, and he could wriggle out of a charge of that sort. No, I'll keep my eyes open. In a little while, after I obtain my patent, and the attachment is on the market, he can't bother me. But I don't mind admitting that I'm worried.""As Alice and Ruth came into the big studio, where a battery of cameras were clicking away, the two girls became aware of the looks cast at them by those not actually engaged in some scene. And, while most of the looks were friendly, those from two of the players were not.""Oh, no. You're ahead of time if anything, and I'm glad of it. We'll have to set the smuggling play aside for a time. One of my men isn't here, and I can slip in your scenes now, and be that much ahead. So if you'll get ready we'll go on with 'A Turn of the Card.'""While there were many persons connected with the Comet Film Company, there were certain principals who did most of the work. Among them, excepting Mr. DeVere, was Wellington Bunn, an old-time actor, who had long aspired to Hamlet, but who had given it up for the more certain income of the movies. Then there was Mrs. Margaret Maguire (on the bills as Cora Ashleigh) who did ""old women"" parts, and did them exceedingly well. She had two grandchildren, Tommy and Nellie, who were often cast for juvenile rôles.Carl Switzer was a joy to know. A German, with an accent that was ""t'icker dan cheese,"" to use his own expression, he was a fund of happy philosophy under the most adverse circumstances. And on his round face was always a smile. He did the ""comic relief,"" when it was needed, which was often.Exactly opposite him in character was Pepper Sneed, the ""grouch"" of the company. Nothing ever went the way Pepper wanted it to go, from the depiction of a play to the meals he ate. No wonder he had dyspepsia. He was always apprehensive of something going to happen and when it did--well, they used to say that Pepper was the original ""I told you so!"""
"Pearl Pennington and Laura Dixon have already been mentioned. Paul Ardite, who played opposite to Miss Dixon, was a good looking chap, with considerable ability. It was rumored that he and the ingenue--but there, I am not supposed to tell secrets.Had it not been for ""Pop"" Snooks, I am sure the Comet Film Company would never have enjoyed the success it did. For Pop was the property man--the one of all work and little play. On him devolved the task of manufacturing at short notice anything from a castle to a police station.And the best part of it was that Pop could do it. He was ingenuity itself, and they tell the story yet of how, when on the theatrical circuit, he made a queen's throne out of two cheese boxes and a board, and a little later in the same play, made from the same materials a very serviceable dog-cart.""That's the way it goes!"" grumbled Pop as he scurried about. But that was all the fault he found, and presently the hole in the dungeon wall, caused by the removal of the safe with a painted canvas on it to represent stones, was filled by some boards taken from a fence used in a rural love drama.""I say now, dot's not right!"" spluttered Mr. Switzer, who as a country boy was making love to a country lass, (Miss Dixon). ""Dot's not right, Pop. You dake our fence avay, und vat I goin' t' lean on ven I makes eyes at Miss Dixon? Ve got t' haf dot fence, yet!""""Mine gracious! Vot a business!"" exclaimed the German, his round face showing as much woe as he ever allowed it to depict. ""Dot vos a fine fence, mit der evening-glory vines trailing 'round mit it. Ach, yah!""""Never mind,"" said Miss Dixon, ""Pop will fix us up,"" and while she was waiting she strolled over to where Paul Ardite was talking to Alice. Russ Dalwood had come in and had greeted Ruth and Alice, and then, in response to an unseen gesture from Paul, had introduced him. Both girls liked the young fellow, who seemed quite interested in Alice.""All ready for 'A Turn of the Card' now!"" called Mr. Pertell, as Mr. DeVere came out of his dressing room. ""Is your camera all ready, Russ?"" for Russ had obtained a place with the film company, and had given up his position in the little moving picture theatre.""Well, I don't want this particular scene to run more than eighty feet. Got to save most of the film for the bigger scenes. Now, watch yourselves, ladies and gentlemen. This is going to be one of our best yet, or I'm mistaken. Pop--where's Pop?"""
"Mr. DeVere was an excellent actor. In his time he had played many parts, so the necessary action, or ""business,"" as it is called, was not hard for him. He had learned readily what was expected of him, and though it seemed rather odd to make his gestures, his exits and entrances before nothing more than the eye of a camera, he soon had become accustomed to it after the days of rehearsal. And the great point was that he did not have to use his voice. Or, at the most, when some vital part of the little play called for speaking, he had only to whisper to give the ""cue"" to the others.The plot was not a very complicated one, telling the story of a wealthy young fellow (played by Paul Ardite) the son of a wealthy banker, (Mr. DeVere) getting into bad company, and how he was saved by the influence of a good girl.With them moved Russ Dalwood, who was ""filming"" this particular play. He placed his little box-machine, on its tripod, before each scene, and used as many feet of film to get the succeeding pictures as Mr. Pertell thought was necessary.I presume all my readers have seen moving pictures many times, and perhaps many of you know how they are made. But at the risk of repeating what is already known I will give just a little description of how the work is done.In the first place there has to be a play to be ""filmed,"" or taken. It may be a parlor drama an outdoor scene--anything from a burning building to a flood. With the play decided on, the actors and actresses for the different parts are selected and carefully rehearsed. This is necessary as the camera is instantaneous and one false move or gestures may spoil the film.Next comes the selection of the location for the various scenes. Indoor ones are comparatively easy, for the scenic artist can build almost anything. But to get the proper outdoor setting is not so easy, and often moving picture companies go many miles to get just the proper scenery for a background.So careful are some managers that they will send to California, or to the Holy Land, in order that their actors may have the proper historical surroundings. This costs many thousands of dollars, so it can be seen how important it is to get the film right at first.For this two different machines are needed. The first is a camera, similar in the main principle to the same camera with which you may have taken snapshots. But there is a difference. Where you take one picture in a second, the moving picture camera takes sixteen. That is the uniform rate maintained, though there may be exceptions. And in your camera you take a picture on a short strip of celluloid film, or on a glass plate, but in the moving picture machine the pictures are taken on a narrow strip of celluloid film perhaps a thousand feet long.The camera consists of a narrow box. On one side is a handle, and there is a lens that can be adjusted or focused. Inside is varied machinery, but I will not tire you with a description of it. Sufficient to say that there are two wheels, or reels. On one--the upper--is wound the unexposed film. One end of this film is fastened to the empty, or lower, reel. The film is passed back of lens, which is fitted with a shutter that opens and closes at the rate of sixteen times a second."
"Turning a handle on the outside of the camera operates it. So that when the scene is ready to be photographed the actors, whether men or animals, begin to move. The handle turns, and the unexposed film is wound from one reel to the other, inside the camera, passing behind the lens, so that the picture falls on it in a flash, just as you take one snapshot. But, as I have said, the moving picture camera takes snapshot after snapshot--sixteen a second--until many thousands are taken, so that when the pictures are shown afterward they give the effect of continuous motion.When the reel of film has all been exposed, it is taken to the dark room, and there developed, just as a small roll from your camera would be. This film is called the negative. From it any number of positives can be made, all depending on the popularity of the subject.To make positives, the negative film is laid on another strip of sensitive celluloid of the same size. The two films are placed in a suitable machine, and then set in front of a bright light. The two films are then moved along so as to print each of the thousands of pictures previously taken.The positive film is then developed, ""fixed"" to prevent it from fading, and it is then ready for the projecting machine. This latter is like the old-fashioned stereopticon, and by means of suitable lenses, and a brilliant light, the small pictures, hardly more than an inch square, are so magnified that they appear life-size on the screen.That, in brief, is how moving pictures are made and shown, but it tells nothing of the hard work involved, on the part of operators, and actors and actresses. Often the performers risk their lives to make a ""snappy"" film, and many accidents have occurred where daring men and women took parts with wild beasts in the cast, or dared serious injury by long jumps.The last scene had been ""filmed"" by Russ, who was getting ready to take his camera to the dark room for development, when there came a crash from where Mr. Switzer was going through a love scene with Miss Dixon.And that was what had happened. Amid the wreckage of the property fence, which had collapsed with the weight of the German actor, sat he and Miss Dixon, while the manager, with a gesture of despair exclaimed:""Only my feelings iss hurted!"" replied Mr. Switzer, with an odd look on his round, fat face. ""It iss not seemly und proper dot ven a feller is telling a nice girl vot he dinks of her, dot he should be upset head ofer heels alretty yet; ain't it?""""Will you be able to go on, when we make the film over again?"" asked the manager anxiously. He did not make this inquiry because he was heartless, but the foremost thought with those who provide amusement for the public--whether they be managers or actors--is that ""the show must go on."" For that reason sickness, and even the death of loved ones, often does not stop the player from appearing on the stage. And, in a measure, this is no less so with those who help to make the moving pictures.""Go on! You'll never be able to go on inside of a week, little girl!"" exclaimed the actor with the perpetual ""grouch."" He looked gloomily at those about him. ""This is the worst business in the world,"" he went on. ""Something is always happening. I know something will go wrong in that safe-blowing act I'm to do next. I----"""
"""Say, you go do that act, and then let us know if anything happens!"" interrupted the manager. ""They're waiting for you over there,"" and he motioned to an office setting, in which a safe robbery, one of the scenes of another play, was to take place.""Never mind now!"" called the manager sharply, with a reassuring glance at Ruth and Alice, who were regarding this little flurry with anxious eyes. They glanced over toward their father. ""Pop, make a new fence--a strong one--and we'll film that scene over again,"" went on Mr. Pertell. ""To your places, the rest of you. Mr. DeVere, I think that will be all we will require of you to-day. But come into the office. I have a new play I'm thinking of filming, and I'd like your advice on some of the scenes. Miss Dixon, shall I send for a doctor?""""Oh, no, indeed!"" she exclaimed, energetically. If there is one thing more than another that an actor or actress fears, it is being supplanted in a rôle. Of course, all the important parts in a play are ""understudied""; that is, some other actor or actress than the principal has learned the lines and ""business"" so, in case the latter is taken ill, the play can go on, after a fashion. But players are jealous of one another to a marked degree, and rather than permit their understudy to succeed him, many a performer has gone on when physically unfit. Perhaps it was this that induced Miss Dixon to conceal the pain she was really suffering.""You must let me attend to you,"" broke in a motherly voice, and Mrs. Maguire, who, as Cora Ashleigh, had finished her part in a little drama, came bustling over. ""I'll put some hot compresses on your ankle, and that will take out the pain,"" went on the elderly actress. ""Come along.""And Miss Dixon was glad enough to go. Mrs. Maguire was really a sort of ""mother"" to the others of the company, and many a physical ache and pain, as well as some mental ones, yielded to her ministering care.""Oh, Mr. Ardite,"" continued the manager to the leading juvenile, ""I'm going to change your part in that runaway drama. I'll want some exterior scenes. One on the Brooklyn Bridge and another at the Grand Central Terminal. Get ready to go up there. Miss Fillmore will be here soon. She's in that with you. I'll send Charlie Blake up to film it. Here's the ""register"" list--look it over,"" and he tossed a sheaf of typewritten sheets to the young actor."
"Miss Dixon, who had come back from her room, after having her ankle bathed, looked up quickly at these words. She glanced from Alice to Paul, and back again, and then said something in a low voice to Miss Pennington.""And I want to congratulate you,"" went on Mr. Pertell. ""You are doing splendid work, and we are glad to have you with us. It is not everyone who can come from the legitimate stage and go into the movies with success; but you have.""""Well, everything seems to be going on all right now,"" observed Mr. Pertell. ""Here's Pop with the fence. Now, Mr. Switzer, and Miss Dixon----well, what is it?"" he broke off with, as he saw Wellington Bunn approaching with an irritated air.""I must refuse, sir, positively refuse, to go on with the part you have assigned to me!"" exclaimed the former Shakespearean player, striking what he thought was a dignified attitude. ""I cannot do it, Mr. Pertell, and I wonder that you expect it of me.""""Yes, and in one scene I am supposed to come home from the office, and get down on the floor to play with blocks with the children. I do not mind that so much, but I have to play horse, and ride the children around on my back, and then, to cap the climax, I have to turn a somersault.""""Well, I positively refuse to do that somersault! The idea of me--Wellington Bunn--who has played in Shakespearean dramas, groveling on the floor and turning somersaults! The somersaults positively must be cut out.""""But they can't very well, Mr. Pertell!"" broke in one of the other actors in the same drama. ""Because when Mr. Bunn goes over that way he is supposed accidentally to upset the table, and the supper things fly all over, and the children laugh and think it's a great joke. The whole scene will be spoiled if Mr. Bunn doesn't turn his somersault.""""Oh, no, they belonged in. You see this was supposed to be a natural scene of Paul and Miss Fillmore meeting on the bridge. They walk along a little way, and part of the plot develops there. So there had to be other persons walking along to make it look natural. How odd it must be if those same persons happen to see the film play later, and recognize themselves in the pictures.""""That porter enjoyed it more than anyone else. He grinned so much that Paul had to tell him to stop, or the top of his head might come off. And laugh! I wish you could have heard him laugh at that. It took us a little longer to get those films, for there was such a crowd. But it was all right. I've had a lovely time!"" cried Alice, her brown eyes brilliant with excitement, and her cheeks flushed."
"""I don't care; he is! And he's in papa's company, so I don't see any harm--especially as it was in daylight, and it was only in one of those dairy lunches, you know. Paul wanted to take me to a better place, but I know he doesn't earn much yet, and I wasn't going to have him waste his money.""""It is interesting,"" agreed Ruth. ""And really it doesn't seem like acting when you don't have any audience except a camera. But I suppose that makes it all the more difficult. Russ was in a little while ago.""As the days went on Mr. DeVere grew to like his new occupation more and more. At first he had talked and mused over the coming time when he could go back to the regular theatre. But his voice showed no tendency to lose its whispering hoarseness, and he was, perforce, compelled to do his acting for the camera. Then came a gradual change of feeling, and he grew really to like his new occupation. Besides, it paid almost as well as a legitimate rôle, and was more certain.The girls and their father enjoyed a private view of the film in which Mr. DeVere was depicted. It was an absorbing play, and while it seemed a bit uncanny, at first, to look at yourself moving about, Mr. DeVere grew accustomed to it.""And it is surprising what faults one can see in onesself,"" he remarked, after the film had been thrown on the screen for him. ""I can pick out a number of places where I can improve in my gestures. And I see places where the action can be more easily and plainly explained to the audience.""""I am glad you do,"" spoke Mr. Pertell. ""It is a good thing to try to improve the movies. They have, in my opinion, a great lesson to teach to the masses, as well as to provide amusement for them. And all we can do, individually, to help, adds to it.They were exacting days that followed. Many dramas had to be filmed, and all the actors and actresses were kept busy. Ruth and Alice spent many afternoons in the studio, growing more and more interested all the while. There was much fun, as well as much hard work, for Mr. Switzer, with his odd expressions and mishaps, was a source of considerable amusement.Then, too, the ""human grouch,"" Pepper Sneed, seemed always to find some new objection to raise, or some dire calamity to predict. And as for Mr. Bunn, he made many protests at rôles he considered incongruous with his dignity.Once he wanted the story of a play so changed that he might give an impersonation of Hamlet in a setting that included a Western mining cabin, and when he was refused by the manager he grew quite indignant.Mr. DeVere had just completed his rôle in a difficult part, and Russ, with his camera, had been shifted over to film another play, a few of the scenes of which were laid in the studio, the others being set out of doors.""That's always the way when you want someone in a hurry,"" stormed the manager. ""Here we are holding things up just because Miss Parker and Miss Dengon aren't here. It wouldn't taken them five minutes to do their parts, either."""
"""No, but two extra young girls I hired for certain parts are missing, and this thing ought to go on. Harrison has an important engagement, and can't wait either. I didn't count on this emergency, though usually I allow for delays. If I only had two girls now--Say!"" he cried, as he looked over at Ruth and Alice. ""They might do it--they might fill in! How about it, Mr. DeVere; would you let them substitute in this drama? It's a simple thing, and with two minutes' coaching they can do it. That will let Harrison get his train, and I can go on with the next scenes. Will you girls try?"" he asked, appealing to them.Mr. DeVere looked troubled. For some time past he had been watching the growing liking of his daughters for the moving pictures, and he was in two minds about the matter. He had seen that this new manner of presenting plays had a great future, not only for the public but for the acting profession. And now, when a chance came for his daughters to get into it, he hardly knew what to say. He had made up his mind that they should never go on the dramatic stage. But this----.""Oh, I don't ask it as a favor. I'm willing to pay for their time. I was to give Miss Parker and Miss Dengon five dollars each for a few minutes of their time to-day, but they have disappointed me. I now offer it to your daughters.""The manager quickly explained what was wanted. The two girls had simple parts, with Mr. Harrison as the chief character. Alice and Ruth soon grasped what was required of them, and, after a little coaching and rehearsing, they were ready.""Now stand over here,"" directed Mr. Pertell, who took personal charge this time, ""and don't pay any attention to the camera. Don't look at it, in fact. Keep your eyes on Mr. Harrison, or on some part of scenery. Just forget everything but what you have to do.""""If you like. Perhaps it will be better, for the first time, to do so,"" suggested Mr. Pertell. ""It may help you to get the 'business' down better. A little more light here!"" he called to the electrician, for in one of the scenes artificial illumination was used. ""Are you all ready, Russ?"" he asked the young operator."
"When it came time for Alice to act the part of a hoydenish character, she was exceedingly natural in it, and her laugh at the simulated discomfiture of Mr. Harrison was so spontaneous that even some of the others joined in.""An' us tryin' as hard as ever we could to get here!"" went on Miss Parker, vigorously chewing gum. ""The nerve of some people is suttinly amazin'! Come on, Ruby, I never did care much for movies anyhow, an' how some folks can stay in 'em is suttinly a mystery to me!""""Business is business--in the movies the same as anywhere else,"" chuckled Mr. Pertell, as he gave Ruth and Alice each a crisp five-dollar bill. ""I am very much obliged to you, in the bargain,"" he went on.""And I want to tell you that you both did most excellently,"" said the manager. ""You have a very good grasp of what is wanted, and you put in the 'business' very naturally. I congratulate you and your father,"" and he nodded to Mr. DeVere.""I suppose that accounts for it,"" observed Mr. Pertell. ""Well, I want to say that I am very much pleased with you, and, if you think you would like to try it again, I can make parts for you in a drama that I am going to film next week.""The work in the film studio was over for the day and the actors and actresses were getting ready to go home. From the time Ruth and Alice had taken the emergency parts Russ had observed Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon casting sharp looks at them.""Jealous!"" mused Russ. And his diagnosis was confirmed a little later, when, as the two former vaudeville performers passed Ruth and Alice, Miss Pennington, with a sharp glance at the latter, murmured loudly enough to be heard:""I'm just going to tell them what I think!"" exclaimed Alice, and there was a hint of real anger in her voice. But she had no chance, for Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon, as though satisfied with what they had done, swept out to the elevator.""Oh, you'll get so you won't mind that a bit!"" went on Mrs. Maguire. ""Sure, I used to eat my heart over it in my younger days, but now I only laugh. It's part of the business. It's a tribute to your acting, my dear, and you ought to take it as such. Don't mind it.""""That's wise,"" commented Mrs. Maguire. ""Though probably he's seen enough of it in his time. But perhaps he wouldn't like to know that it bothered you. Best say nothing to him, my dears. It will wear away soon enough."""
"""Well, I must see what sort of parts Mr. Pertell will cast you for,"" said Mr. DeVere. ""But I am glad you like the work. It may be a great deal better for all of us to be in this than if I was alone in a regular theater. We can always be together now, and certainly my voice doesn't seem to be improving very fast.""This was only too true. Several visits to the physician, and a heroic course of treatment, had resulted in only a slight improvement. The pain in the vocal chords had been lessened, but the huskiness remained, so that it would have been practically impossible for Mr. DeVere to speak his lines in a regular theater. So the moving pictures were suited to him.The DeVere family was now in much better circumstances than when we first made their acquaintance. They had been gradually paying the back bills, the landlord had been appeased, so that there was no danger of dispossession, and there was much happiness in the little flat.A few days after the first appearance of Ruth and Alice before the moving picture camera, in the small rôles they had taken to bridge over an emergency, Mr. Pertell brought them their parts in a new drama. Meanwhile it had been ascertained that the films where the girls filled in had been a success. Ruth and Alice felt a little diffident about going to the studio again, especially after the scene with the jealous actresses.But Miss Dixon and Miss Pennington appeared to have gotten over their pique, and they acted as though they had never said anything to wound or annoy Ruth and Alice. The latter, however, could not forget it, and were rather cool toward their fellow-players.""I knew they would,"" was the grouchy rejoinder. ""They'll have a real quarrel, and both quit, and that'll mean some new members in the company. And just as we are about through rehearsing that piece, and about to film it, too. That means I'll have to do it all over again. I knew something would happen!""""Why, he has cast me--I, who have played all the principal Shakespearean characters--he has cast me--Wellington Bunn--as a waiter in a hotel scene! Where is Mr. Pertell? I refuse to take that character!""""Now see here!"" exclaimed Mr. Pertell, with more anger than he usually displayed. ""You'll take that part, Mr. Bunn, or leave the company! It is an important part, and has to do with the development of the plot. Why, as that waiter you intercept the taking of ten thousand dollars, and prevent the heroine from being abducted. Afterward you become rich, and blossom out as a theatrical manager.""""Mine's jolly. I'm a school girl, always up to some trick or other, and--yes, see here--why in one of my tricks I disclose that the pretended count who's in love with you is only an organ grinder! Oh, that will be fun,"" and she laughed gleefully."
"Mr. DeVere was fully satisfied with the parts assigned to his daughters, and agreed to allow them to enter formally into the work of the moving pictures at a very fair salary for beginners. The others of the company were called together, including Paul Ardite, and the best method of getting the finest results out of the drama was discussed.In the days that followed, Ruth and Alice, as well as the others, did hard work. It is not as easy to go through a moving picture play as it appears merely from seeing the film on the white curtain. Some scenes have to be rehearsed over and over again, and often, after being filmed, some defect results and the work has to be all done once more.Mr. DeVere rehearsed his daughters at home in the intervals of their appearance at the studio, and this redounded to their benefit. They were thus able to do effective work, and Mr. Pertell complimented them on it.The play was soon ready for filming, and Russ was chosen to work the camera. Some of the scenes were out of doors, in a big flower garden, and for this the company was taken to Brooklyn, where a private owner was induced to allow his place to be used for a few minutes. Ruth and Alice enjoyed their part in the flower garden very much.Finally the last rehearsal was had, and the day was set for making the films of the first real, big play in which the two girls had ever taken part. As they were leaving the studio together, on the afternoon of the day before the first ""performance,"" they saw a group of children standing down near the main entrance.It was not without a feeling of nervousness that Ruth and Alice prepared to take their places in the actual depiction of the new play. The rehearsals had not been so trying; but now, when the photographs were to be made, there was a strain on all.But in the movies a false move, a wrong gesture, is at once indelibly registered on the film, to reappear greatly magnified. And though sometimes the incorrect part of the film can be cut out, mistakes are generally costly.This time there was no delay, and the clicking of the camera was heard as Russ turned the handle. Mr. DeVere and his two daughters were not in this first scene, so it gave the girls a chance to lose some of their nervousness--or ""stage fright."" As for Mr. DeVere, he was too much of a veteran actor to mind this. Besides, he had played many parts before the camera now.Mr. Pertell stood with watch in hand, timing the performance. For the play must be gotten on a certain length of film, and if one scene ran over its allotted time it might spoil the next one by curtailing the action.Accordingly some parts, not essential to the play, were ""cut"" to shorten the time. Russ went on turning the crank, getting hundreds of the tiny pictures that afterward would be magnified, and thrown on the screen in dozens of moving picture playhouses, for the Comet Company supplied a large ""circuit.""""No you won't,"" spoke Russ, encouragingly. She stood near him, and flashed him a grateful look. ""I'll be watching you,"" he said, ""and if I see anything wrong I'll stop in an instant, so we won't spoil any film.""""All right! Oh, I just know it's going to be splendid!"" her sister exclaimed. There was the flush of excitement on her cheeks, and though she would not admit, Alice, too, was nervous. So much, she felt, depended on this first real play--so much for herself and her sister. It was thrilling to feel that they might be able to make a comfortable living through the medium of the movies."
"The play went on. Ruth took her part first, and the little drama was enacted. Her father, who was in the scene with her, smiled encouragement, and Russ nodded gaily as he continued to turn the clicking camera.""Yes, sir,"" answered the operator, as he noted from the automatic register at the side of the camera how many feet of film had been run on the new scene. Then, when it came to be developed, it could be eliminated. The figures also showed how much of the thousand-foot reel was left for succeeding scenes.The benefit of the change was at once apparent, and after a moment of rehearsal it was decided on. Again the camera began its clicking and everyone breathed freely once more, Alice most of all, for failure would have meant so much to her.Alice and Ruth had rather difficult parts, and in one scene they held the stage alone, ""plotting"" to disclose the false count. It was in this scene that Alice had some effective work along comedy lines.It seemed to go off very well--at least, as far as the girls could tell. Alice, as a rather hoydenish school girl, home for the summer, played havoc with the admirers of the romantic Ruth, who seemed to fill the rôle to perfection.""Very good!"" observed the manager, after an effective scene in which Alice and Ruth took part. ""You are doing excellent work. If this play is a hit I'll star you two in something more elaborate next week.""The two girls were resting after the performance of the play ""A False Count."" The last scene had been filmed, and the long strips of celluloid, with the hidden pictures, sent to the dark room for development. Not until then could it be told whether the affair had been a success from a mechanical standpoint. And then, later, would come the test before the great public.""Well, you know the moving picture business is something like the Associated Press,"" explained Russ. ""The Associated Press is an organization for getting news. Often news has to be gotten in advance--say a thing like the President's message, or a speech by a big man.""The Associated Press gets a copy in advance, and sends duplicates of it out to the newspapers that take its service. And on each duplicate copy is stamped a notice that it is to be released for publication on a certain day--or at even a certain hour. That is, it can't be used by the newspapers until that time.""It's somewhat like that with moving pictures. The reels of new plays are sent out to the different theaters, and to fix it so a theater quite a distance from New York won't be at a disadvantage with one right here, which would get the film sooner, there is a certain date set for the release of the film. That means that though one theater gets it first it can't use it until the date set, when all the playhouses are supposed to have it.""""Yes,"" went on Russ. ""Of course the best stuff is what is called 'first run,'"" he went on to explain. ""That is, it is a reel of film of a new play, never before shown in a certain city. The best moving picture theaters take the first run, and pay good prices for it. Then, later on, second-rate theaters may get it at a lower price."""
"""Well, we've seen enough of it around the house, with daddy getting ready for some of his plays,"" admitted Alice. ""Oh, I wish I could do it all over again!"" she cried, gliding over to her sister and whirling her off in a little waltz to the tune of a piano that was playing so that the performers in another play, representing a ball room scene, might keep proper time.""Attention!"" called the manager. ""Get some good business into this, now. Mr. Switzer, when you come in, after that scene where you apply for work, and can't get it, you must throw yourself into your chair despondently. Do it as though you had lost all hope. You know what I mean.""""Vot you mean? Dot I should sit in it so?"" and the German actor plumped himself into the chair in question by approaching it so that he could sit on it in astride, in reverse position, folding his arms over the rounded back.Striding into the scene, which had been interrupted to enable this bit of rehearsal to be gone through with, the old Shakespearean actor approached the chair and cast himself into it as though he had lost his last friend, and had no hope left on earth.Mr. Bunn had cast himself into the chair with such ""abandon"" that the chair abandoned him. It fell apart, it disintegrated, it parted company with its legs--all at once--so that chair and actor came to the ground in a heap.""Ach! So. I unterstandt now!"" exclaimed Mr. Switzer. ""I haf your meaning now, of vat 'abandon' is, Mr. Pertell. I am to break der chair ven I sits on it, yes? Dot is 'abandon' a chair. Vot a queer lanquitch der English is, alretty. Vell, brings me annuder chair und I vill abandon it!""So far as could be told by an inspection of the negatives of the first important play in which Ruth and Alice had appeared, it was a success. Of course how it would ""take"" with the public was yet to be learned.Meanwhile other plays were being considered, and Mr. Pertell repeated his promise, that if ""A False Count"" was successful he would give Ruth and Alice real ""star"" parts. They were eager for this, and, now that their father had seen how well they did, he was enthusiastic over them, and very glad to let them go on in the moving picture business.""That's on account of my invention,"" said Russ, proudly. ""I'm glad you noticed it."" Then the girls were more interested. A little later, when the title of the next play was shown, Ruth and Alice could not repress exclamations of pleased surprise. For it was ""A False Count!"""
"It was rather an uncanny experience at first, but they soon became used to it, and gave themselves up to the enjoyment of the little play, made doubly delightful from the fact that they had helped to make it.The two ""moving picture girls,"" as they laughingly called themselves, with Russ, were on their way home from the little theater where they had just witnessed the depiction of themselves on the screen. They had listened with amusement, not unmixed with pride, at the whispered comments on the play in which they had taken part.""That's so!"" exclaimed Ruth. ""But I wish Mr. Pertell could know how well it went. Not on our account,"" she added quickly, ""but on account of his own business, and because dear daddy is in it. And the others, too--they'd be glad to know the audience liked it, I think.""""Don't worry,"" returned Russ. ""Mr. Pertell will know it soon enough. He keeps track of all his films, and he knows which are successful or not. He'll hear of this one the first thing in the morning. The owners of the theaters where our films are used report as to which go the best. And their own re-orders also show that. So you'll be discovered, all right.""""Not a bit too enthusiastic!"" Russ assured her. ""That's what I like to see, and I guess the manager does, too. It would be a good thing if some of the others were a little more enthusiastic. They'd do better acting. Say!"" he broke in, ""what do you say to an ice cream soda? It's warm this evening,"" and he paused before a brilliantly lighted drug store.""Oh, it isn't late,"" he laughed. ""But I want to do a little work on my invention. I've sort of struck a snag, and it's bothering me. I want it as nearly perfect as I can get it, and I've thought of an improvement I can put on it. So I'll say good-night.""""No more work to-night, Dad!"" announced Ruth, firmly, as she saw her father preparing to resume the study of the manuscript containing his part in a new moving picture drama. ""Your eyes must be tired, and you must save them. It won't do to have them spoiled, as well as your voice."""
"""No, I suppose not,"" he answered, somewhat wearily. ""This work is rather trying. I believe I would like to get out in the open for a change. Though I always said I never would do open-air parts in the movies.""""Mr. Pertell will probably tell us when he has his plans perfected,"" Alice returned. ""You know, though, that he promised if this 'A False Count' play should be a success he'd give us a chance in a more pretentious drama. I'm counting on that.""As Russ had predicted, Mr. Pertell was not long in learning of the success of the play in which Ruth and Alice had main parts. In a day or so there came an increased demand for the films of the drama, and the manager was well pleased.""And now I'm going to keep the promise I made you,"" he said to Ruth and Alice. ""I've been holding back on a big drama, waiting until I saw how that one turned out. I didn't have any doubts, though, after I saw you two act. Now I'm going to star you in that. And afterward, well, we'll see what will happen. I've got a lot of ideas I want to try,"" he added.""Then I'll make my plans,"" went on Mr. Pertell, after a confirmatory nod from Mr. DeVere. ""I think you'll like your parts. One of the acts takes place on a yacht. I've hired one for a little trip down the bay, and you can play at being millionaires for a day.""""I'll have your parts ready soon,"" went on the manager. ""I must start some of the other dramas going now,"" and he glanced about the studio. Off in one corner, talking together, were Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon, and, as the two actresses conversed they cast envious glances, from time to time, at Alice and Ruth. They were plainly jealous of the rapid rise of our two friends, but the moving picture girls bore in mind what motherly Mrs. Maguire had told them, and did not worry.""Why, you have been promising that you would put on one of Shakespeare's plays, and give me a chance in Hamlet, and here you go and cast me for one of a gang of counterfeiters. I have to wear a black mask. The public will not know that it is Wellington Bunn playing.""But a little later he was observed to be putting on his mask, and taking his place in the ""den of the counterfeiters,"" as the screen announced the place to be. It was one of the masterpieces of scenery evolved by Pop Snooks. And a little later he transformed the same scene, with a little manipulation, into the cave of a thirteenth century monk. Such was Pop Snooks."
"""Ha! It iss dot I go in a restaurant, und order a meal. Der vaiter he brings me some cheese und I am so thoughtfulness dot I put red pepper and horse radish on it. Den, ven I eat it I jumps ofer der table alretty yet. Dot is a fine part!"" and he laughed gleefully, for Mr. Switzer was a simple soul.A little later Alice and Ruth were given their new parts to study. It was announced that rehearsals would take place in a day or two, and many of the scenes were to be out of doors, some of them taking place on a yacht. Meanwhile Mr. DeVere went through with his rôle in a film drama, Ruth and Alice not being called on.Finally announcement was made that the work of preparation for filming the big drama would be undertaken. This was the most ambitious play yet planned by Mr. Pertell, and he was anxious to make it a success.That the price of success is high was amply proven in the next week. Everyone worked hard at the rehearsals, and none harder than Ruth and Alice. They were determined that their parts should be a credit to the performance. Later they learned that Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon had pleaded for the rôles assigned to them.But Mr. Pertell was true to his promise, and kept Alice and Ruth in their assigned places. The drama was an elaborate one, involving the making of special scenery, and Pop Snooks had to call in several assistants. But he liked that.But at last the rehearsals were complete, including those for the outdoor scenes. Of course the latter were rehearsed in the studio first, so that when the time came to film such as the scenes on the yacht, the pictures could be made without any preliminary trial on the vessel itself. To this end Pop had set up in the studio enough of the deck and fittings of a yacht to enable the performers to familiarize themselves with them.""And now for the real thing!"" exclaimed Russ, as a goodly part of the company, including Mr. DeVere and his daughters, started for the Battery one morning. They were to board the yacht there, and one of the scenes would show the girls going up the gang-plank.Quite a throng of curious people gathered when the film theatrical company prepared to board the vessel which had been chartered for the occasion. The embarking place was near the round building, now used as an Aquarium, but which, in former years, was Castle Garden, the immigrant landing station.The moving picture operator shifted his three-legged machine to one side, and was about to start moving the film, as Ruth, Alice and the others, presumably of a gay yachting party, started up the gang-plank. For a moment there was considerable confusion and excitement. Men in pursuit of the frantic animal had rushed after him, calling warnings to those in the zone of danger. Two policemen ran up to intercept the steed."
"As for the moving picture actresses they hardly knew what to do. If the plunging animal crashed into the gang-plank he might injure a number of the performers, and break the rather frail structure, letting them slip into the water.And indeed the quick-witted, rustic youth had the frantic horse in a firm grip. He seemed to know just how to handle frightened animals, and by the time the two policemen had reached him, the beast, though still restive, had quieted down.""I don't know, constable,"" was the answer, given with a country twang that caused several spectators to smile. ""I jest seen him comin' and I see he was headed for them people what's goin' to Europe, I expect. I didn't want their voyage spoiled, so I jest jumped at his head.""""Good work, all right!"" repeated the first officer. ""I'll take your name, young fellow, for my report,"" and he drew out a notebook. ""I'll also want to find out to whom the horse belongs, but I s'pose the truckman's license number will be a clue.""""Can I go, or do I have to appear in court?"" asked Sandy Apgar. ""I hope I don't, 'caused I'm in a hurry to git back to the farm. I've got a passel of work to do there, with the weather coming on the way it is.""Guess you wouldn't want to do any cartin' as far as Beatonville,"" laughed Sandy. ""Folks out there don't ever move--they jest die and are buried in the same place. And I guess this is my last trip to New York in a long while. I'm jest as much obliged though,"" and patting the nose of the now quieted horse, he moved off through the thinning crowd. But he was not to escape unnoticed.Mr. Pertell had learned, by a hasty talk with Russ, that the horse had been stopped just in time to avoid spoiling any of the film. Russ had continued to make the pictures and the first act of the new drama was a success. The other scenes would take place on board the chartered yacht.""No, this is only a make-believe trip,"" laughed the manager. ""It's for moving pictures. See, there's the chap who was taking the films, and they'd been spoiled if that horse got on the gang-plank. So you see what you did for us.""""Oh, that's just to show them,"" the manager explained. ""But we ought to be under way now. Can you come aboard for a little trip? We'll soon be back, and I want to thank you properly. I haven't time now. Come, take a little trip with us."""
"There were to be a number of scenes on board, but they would not be filmed until the yacht was farther out. Meanwhile, however, the progress of the ship down the bay was to be depicted on the screen, so Russ took pictures from either rail, no members of the company being required in these. Mr. Pertell thus had a chance to talk to Sandy.""Well, he used to ship a lot of asparagus to New York, but maybe that was before your day,"" went on Sandy. ""Pop is too feeble to work now, so I'm running the farm for him. And it--it's sorter hard,"" he added, rather pathetically. ""Especially when you ain't got any too much money. I come to New York to raise some,"" he went on, ""but folks don't seem to want to part with any--especially on a second mortgage.""""Say, Mister, I reckon you've got enough troubles of your own, without bothering with mine,"" said Sandy. ""Besides, maybe Pop wouldn't like me to tell. No, I'll jest make another try somewhere else. But we sure do need cash!""""Oh, maybe pop wouldn't like me to say. Never mind. It was sure good of you to ask me for this ride. The folks at Beatonville won't believe me when I tell 'em. But say, if ever you folks come out there, we'll give you a right good time--at Oak Farm!"" he added, generously. The trip down the bay on the yacht was enjoyed by all, even though much of the time was taken up in depicting scenes from the drama. Sandy Apgar looked on curiously while the drama was being filmed, and when Ruth and Alice were not acting they talked to the young farmer.They found him good-natured and rather simple, yet with a fund of homely wit and philosophy that stood him in good stead. He described Beatonville to them, and the farm where he and his aged parents tried to wrest a living from nature--that was none too kind.""I've had quite a little vacation since I come to New York,"" Sandy said, ""though it did take quite a bit of money. I reckon pop, though, will be disappointed that I can't bring back with me the promise of some cash.""""Yes, Miss. And I guess there ain't many farmers but what do. Leastways, I never met any that was millionaires. Though if the folks back home could see me now they'd think I was one, sittin' here doin' nothin'. It sure is great!""""That's what some city folks said once, when they stopped in their automobile to get a glass of milk,"" replied Sandy. ""We haven't any electric lights, nor even a telephone. So I guess we're old-fashioned, all right."""
"""I should say so,"" laughed Mr. Pertell. ""Well, it may be the very thing I need when I go out on the rural circuit with my company. If it is, I could pay for the use of your farm, and it wouldn't interfere with your getting in the crops. In fact, I would probably want some scenes of harvesting, and the like.""""Money's too scarce to waste on a good time,"" replied the young farmer, cautiously. ""I'll use this to make up what I spent on railroad fare. My trip was a failure, but pop and mom will be glad it didn't cost me as much as I calculated, thanks to you. I hope you will get out to Oak Farm.""""Now we will have the scene in the small boat, where the party puts off to visit friends on the other vessel,"" announced Mr. Pertell. ""They don't actually get there, as the alarm on board this vessel brings them back. But we'll have to show the start. Now, Mr. Sneed, you are to go in the small boat first.""But matters seemed going smoothly enough. The sailors were carefully lowering the small craft, and it was nearly at the surface of the water. Russ, up in the bow of the yacht, where he could get a good view, was making the pictures.Suddenly, when the boat was a few feet from the ripples on the bay, one of the ropes slipped quickly through the davit block. One end of the boat went down quite fast and Pepper Sneed was heard to yell:But with great presence of mind the other sailors lowered away on their rope, so that the other end of the boat went down also, and in another instant it was riding on an even keel. Nothing had happened except that Pepper Sneed had been badly scared.""Excuse me, Mr. Pertell,"" said Alice, when they got back to the studio, and instructions had been given out for the indoor rehearsals next day, ""excuse me, but I could not help overhearing what you said about the possibility of some farm dramas. Do you intend to film some of those?""""Well, then, if this big play proves a success--and I see no reason why it should not--I shall take you and the rest of the company out to the country for the summer. We may go to Oak Farm, or to some other place; but we'll try a circuit of rural dramas, and see how they go.""""I think that will be fine!"" exclaimed Ruth. ""Listen, dear, daddy told me he had some business to attend to downtown, so he won't be home to supper. He suggested that we two go to a restaurant, and I think I'd like it--don't you? It will round out the day!""A short time afterward the girls sat in a quiet restaurant, not far from the moving picture studio. There were not many persons there yet, for it was rather early. Ruth and Alice had taken a cosy little corner, of which there were a number in the place."
"""I'm sure we can get it,"" he was saying. ""It's a nice little patent, and all the movies in the country will want it. It makes the pictures clearer and steadier. I tried to make a deal with him for it, but he turned me down. Now I'm going to get it anyhow, if you'll help.""""Now, Ruth, be sensible,"" went on Alice, as she passed around back of her sister's chair. ""You heard what was said. I'm sure those men have some designs on that patent Russ has worked so hard over. We must tell him about them, and put him on his guard.""""Danger!"" laughed Alice softly, as she came to a position behind the screen, whence she could note who the men going out were. ""There's no danger in a public restaurant like this. And I'm only going to make sure who that man is. Then we'll go tell Russ.""Ruth made no further objection, and turned to watch her sister. The men had come to a halt at the desk of the cashier, to pay their checks, and their backs were toward Alice. An instant later, however, one of them had turned around and faced toward the rear of the restaurant.The two girls drew on their gloves and left the restaurant. As Ruth had expected, the cashier at the desk looked at them curiously as they paid for the meal they had not eaten. But Alice forestalled any open criticism by saying:""Oh, all right,"" answered the young girl at the desk. ""We often give what is left over to charity, and I'm sure the food on your table won't come amiss. If you like I'll speak to the manager, and see if he'll give you a rebate----""But at the Fenmore the girls had their first disappointment, for none of the Dalwoods was at home. Nor did any of the neighbors know where they had gone. For persons in New York, even in the same apartment house, are not very likely to become acquainted with one another, and often families may live in adjoining flats for a long time, without passing beyond the bowing stage. As for keeping track of the comings and goings of their neighbors, it is never thought of, unless something out of the ordinary occurs.""I don't know. I've got to think!"" exclaimed Alice. ""Come in our place and let's sit down a minute. We can make a cup of tea. I was so hungry, and to leave that nice little meal--well, we just had to do it, that's all."""
"""We can write a note and leave it under the door. Then we can leave a note for daddy. He'll be worried when he comes back and finds us gone. That's the best plan, Alice. Leave a note for Russ, and then you and I will try to find him. They may know at the studio where he has gone. Or he may be there yet."" Two notes were quickly written. One was left on the table in the girls' apartment, telling their father that they were going out for a little while, to try to locate Russ on a matter of some importance connected with the moving pictures.""There's no use telling daddy what has happened,"" said Alice. ""He would only worry, and really there's no danger. We are merely going to warn Russ. He'll have to look after the men himself. But daddy would be sure to think we would get into some trouble. So we may as well not bother him.""""They'll be sure to see that,"" remarked Alice. ""And, no matter if only Billy comes home first, he'll know what to do,"" for the story of the men's talk in the restaurant had been briefly set down on the paper.""We can call up the studio on the telephone,"" suggested Alice, as she and her sister reached the street. ""That will be the quickest way. If Russ isn't there they may be able to tell us where he is, or Mr. Pertell may know where the model is--I mean the machine shop where the apparatus is being turned out.""""Because you can't tell but one of those men may be watching this place, and some of the neighbors may be in league with them. Besides, all the telephones here are on party wires, and when you talk over one, some of the other subscribers on the same circuit may listen, for all we can tell. It isn't safe.""""Oh, it just seems to come to me,"" replied Alice, with a laugh. ""Come on,"" she added, after they had walked a little way. ""There's a drug store and there's a telephone booth in it. Do you want to talk to Russ, in case he's there?""Ruth nodded understandingly. But it seemed that Russ was not to be so easily found. Through her receiver Alice could hear Miss Miller ringing the telephones in the different departments of the big studio building. One after the other was tried, from the office to the dark developing rooms, and then the printing rooms. Most of the employees had gone for the day, but such as were present evidently made answer that the young moving picture operator was not there."
"In a few seconds Miss Miller had given the desired information, and then Alice said ""good-bye"" to her, frantically working the receiver hook of her instrument up and down to call the attention of the main central operator.It was Ruth who was directing now, and Alice, after a moment of thought, saw that this was the only thing to do. Quickly they retraced their steps to the apartment house. Without stopping to enter their own flat they knocked on the Dalwood door. A few seconds of anxious waiting brought no answer.""So that's the game; is it?"" he cried. ""Well, I'll stop them! I'm mighty glad you told me. My patent model, the drawings and everything are at Burton's machine shop. It isn't far from here. I'll go right away--in a taxicab. Do you----"" he hesitated a moment. ""Do you want to come?""""I will,"" he exclaimed as he entered his own flat. ""But mother and Billy won't be home until late, anyhow. They're going to stay to supper with relatives. Still, I'll explain in case I should be delayed.""Quickly he dashed off another note for his mother, and then, with the two girls, he hurried down to the street. There was a taxicab stand just around the corner, and the three were quickly on their way to the machine shop, while Ruth and Alice took turns giving more details of the scene in the restaurant.""Yes. And I had no suspicions. You know you had said you might want the model some time in a hurry, to demonstrate to possible buyers, and of course when the boy came with the note I supposed you had sent him. I'm not familiar enough with your handwriting to know it,"" he added.""It all seemed regular,"" went on Mr. Burton. ""I was working away, making some of the finished appliances from your model and drawings, when the boy brought the note. He was a regular messenger boy, I could tell that. And the note only asked for the model--not for any of the finished machines, of which I had two. He didn't even want the drawings, or I might have been suspicious.""""Yes, but I'm not ready. You see the machine isn't perfected yet. I am still working on it. But they can file a prior claim, and get a patent on something so near like mine that I would be refused a patent when I applied."
"""You see I haven't made any formal application yet. Of course, if it came to a question of a lawsuit, I might beat them out. But I have no money to hire lawyers, and they have. The only thing for me to do is to get that model back before they have a chance to use it to make drawings from. And how to do it I don't know.""""I did notice the number,"" he said. ""It isn't often that taxicabs stop out in front here, and I looked from my window as one drew up at the curb. I was working on your patent at the time. I saw the number of the cab, later, as the messenger boy rode off in it with the model.""""I guess I can help you out, friend,"" broke in their own taxicab chauffeur. ""I've got a list of all the cabs in New York, and the companies that run them."" Rapidly he consulted a notebook, and soon had the desired information. The office of the company was not far away, and Russ and the girls were soon speeding toward it. What the next move was to be no one could say.An inquiry over the telephone to the main office of the messenger service, brought the desired information. And soon, in their taxicab Russ, Ruth and Alice were at the sub-station. There the identity of the messenger was soon learned, and he was sent for.Back again they went, to find that the car had just come in, after a long trip. The chauffeur readily gave the address to which he had driven the two men, after the messenger boy had gotten out. It was in an obscure section of Jersey City. Mr. DeVere was rather worried when he reached home, and found his daughters' note. He puzzled over what could have taken them out with Russ, and went across the hall to inquire. By this time Mrs. Dalwood had returned, and found the note her son had left.Then, rather disjointedly, and with many interruptions, the girls told the story of the afternoon and evening, for it was now nearly nine o'clock. Of course Mr. DeVere and Mrs. Dalwood were much worried when they learned what had happened, and the widow was not at her ease when she thought of her son still not out of danger.After Alice and Ruth had gone home in the taxicab he had called for Mr. Pertell, explaining what had occurred. A special officer was engaged, and the three went to the address in Jersey City, where Wolley and Brisket had gone with the model. The place was in a rather disreputable neighborhood. In a back room, which was approached with caution, the two plotters were found with a draughtsman whom they had hired to make drawings of the model.The two scoundrels were taken by surprise and easily overpowered, after a short resistance. The draughtsman was an innocent party, and was allowed to go, after promising to give evidence against Wolley and Brisket. The latter were put under arrest, and with his precious model safe in his possession Russ started for home."
