passage
"In the rather dim light of the gloomy old room the boys and girls looked queer--almost ghostly. They were gathered about a shabby old trunk, and beside this trunk a man was kneeling. As Billie Bradley spoke, the man, who was her father, rose to his feet and thoughtfully brushed the dust from his clothes. Then he stood looking down at the hundreds and hundreds of postage stamps and old coins that filled the queer old trunk.""Yes, you really have made a find this time, Billie,"" he said. ""Of course I'm not an expert, but I'm sure the coins in that old trunk are worth three thousand dollars, and the postage stamps ought to bring at least two thousand more----""""But five thousand dollars!"" interrupted Laura Jordon, in an awed voice. ""Just think of it, Billie! And because your Aunt Beatrice left you this house and everything in it, every last cent of that five thousand belongs to you.""As those readers who have read the first book of this series, entitled ""Billie Bradley and Her Inheritance,"" will probably have gathered, the girls, Billie Bradley, Laura Jordon and Violet Farrington, and their boy relatives and chums, Chet Bradley, Ferd Stowing and Teddy Jordon, were still at the old homestead at Cherry Corners where so many weird and mysterious experiences had befallen them.The young folks had grown up in North Bend, a town of perhaps twenty thousand people, and about forty miles by rail from New York City. The girls had seen the great metropolis several times, though their visits had been all too short to satisfy their eager curiosity.Whether it was her sparkling brown eyes with the imp of mischief always lurking in them, or her merry laugh that made every one want to laugh with her, or the adventurous spirit that made her eager to embark on any kind of lark, it would be hard to tell--perhaps her popularity arose from a combination of all of these. But the fact remains that everybody loved her and she had not an enemy, except, perhaps, Amanda Peabody--but more of _her_ later!Then there was Laura Jordon, Billie's best chum, blue-eyed and golden-haired, who, despite the fact that her father was very wealthy and owned the thriving jewelry factory in North Bend, was not the slightest bit spoiled or conceited. She adored Billie, and although the two would sometimes enter into rather heated discussions, it was usually Laura who gave in to Billie in the end.The last of the trio, but decidedly not the least, was Violet Farrington, who, tall and dark and less hasty and impetuous than the other two, often found the doubtfully blessed office of peacemaker thrust upon her. And though her slowness and tendency to hang back sometimes exasperated her chums, they nevertheless were very fond of her--and showed it.And--Teddy! Teddy, who was the handsomest and gayest of all the boys, had been Billie's friend and playmate ever since they could remember. Either of them would have felt lost without the friendship of the other. Teddy was Laura's brother and had starred in almost all the sports in which the lads of North Bend had taken part--a fact which did not make Billie like him any the less.Just the summer before this story opens, Billie, going back with Violet and Laura to the grammar school from which they had just graduated, had, in a moment of thoughtless skylarking, broken a handsome and expensive statue that belonged to her English teacher--Miss Martha Beggs.The accident was nothing short of a tragedy to Billie, for her father, Martin Bradley, a real estate and insurance agent in North Bend, having most of his capital tied up in property and being at the time engaged in fighting a rather losing fight with the high cost of living was in no position to pay a hundred dollars--which was what the statue was worth.Billie's worry was deepened by the fact that she would not be able to go with Laura and Violet to Three Towers Hall, a boarding school to which she had wanted to go all her life. The high school in North Bend was notoriously poor and inefficient, and the girls had set their hearts on attending Three Towers in the fall. And now, because of the broken statue, Billie could not go.Then had come news of Beatrice Powerson's death. Beatrice Powerson was an aunt of Billie's mother for whom Billie had been named. Then came the strange inheritance which the queer old lady, who had spent her life traveling, had left to Billie--the old homestead at Cherry Corners which dated back to revolutionary times and had been the scene of more than one Indian attack."
"Readers of the first book of this series will remember how the girls and boys had decided to spend their vacation there, the many queer and spooky experiences they had had, and finally the shabby old trunk which Billie had found stowed away in a corner of the attic--a shabby old trunk that contained riches; at least, so it now seemed to the boys and girls. Five thousand dollars in the shape of old coins and postage stamps.And now he had just given the result of his investigation to six pairs of ears. To be exact it had better be made seven, for Mrs. Maria Gilligan, Mrs. Jordon's housekeeper and the girls' chaperone on this expedition, was looking on with interest from the doorway.Five thousand dollars, perhaps more. This almost certainly meant that not only could Billie go to Three Towers Hall, but Chet would be able to go with the other boys to a military academy which was only a little over a mile from Three Towers.""I'll say we are,"" said Ferd Stowing, staring down at the queer little trunk as though he already could see it full to the brim with shining new gold pieces from the mint instead of the old coins and rare postage stamps that were its present contents.""Oh, Daddy, let's hurry!"" she cried; then as her chums stared at her in surprise she rushed over to the trunk and slammed the lid shut. ""What are you waiting for?"" she cried, stamping her foot impatiently as she turned to face them. ""If _you_ want to stand around looking foolish, all right. But _I'm_ going home.""""I was going to suggest,"" said Mr. Bradley, looking at his watch, ""that we catch the eight o'clock train for North Bend. Is that at all possible, Mrs. Gilligan?"" he asked, turning apologetically to Mrs. Gilligan.""Of course it is,"" she cried. ""We girls were beginning to pack anyway. Come on, girls, what we need is action,"" and without giving them a chance to protest she fell upon the girls and dragged them from the room.""Gosh,"" he said, ""I do be sorry to see 'em go. When they first came it sure did turn my heart cold to see three girls an' a woman goin' into that there haunted house. At night it was, too! But it seems they've come out all right, after all. Guess they must 'a' scared the ghosts away. Well, you've sure got to hand it to 'em."" And he shook his head sagely as the springs of the old wagon creaked under him. ""Giddap, Napoleon!"" And a few minutes later wagon and driver were enveloped in the gray mist of the evening.""If we only get the train!"" Such had been Billie's thought throughout the drive to the station. Her mind was on getting home and turning the precious old coins and postage stamps into real money. Then she could arrange about going to Three Towers Hall and about sending her brother to Boxton Military Academy."
"What followed was like a terrible nightmare. Shaken and jolted badly, but not seriously hurt, it took the girls a horrible minute or two to realize what had happened. There had been an accident--a terrible accident. Then hands went out in the blackness and the girls called to each other in strangled whispers that could not be heard above the din and uproar outside.They heard Mr. Bradley shouting above the noise, asking if any one of them was hurt and reassuring them. Gradually they managed to grope their way to his side, guided by his voice, and with an agony of relief in his heart he gathered the three girls to him and heard the voices of Mrs. Gilligan and the boys at his elbow.""Oh, I hope not,"" said Billie, her voice almost lost in the uproar. ""I guess it must have been the forward cars that caught the worst of it. We just escaped."" She shuddered and clasped Laura's hand more tightly.It seemed ages before they finally reached the platform of the car. However, even nightmares come to an end, and they were suddenly startled by having a red light flashed in their faces. And then a friendly Irish voice accosted them in unmistakable brogue.""I don't think so,"" replied Mr. Bradley, surprised to find that his voice was trembling and that the hand he raised to wipe his forehead shook like a leaf. If it had been himself alone who had been in danger--but the young folks!The faces of the boys were white, but they plunged immediately into the work of rescue. Men came running from the farms about. All who could get lanterns had them, and the lights were seen swinging down the roadside or in the ruined cars, searching for any one who might be pinned under the wreckage.Most of the passengers had already been accounted for, but there were one or two who must still be found. Mr. Bradley picked his way through the d√©bris to the front of the train, while Mrs. Gilligan and the girls followed him slowly.""I don't think so,"" Billie answered. ""The damage seems to be mostly at the front of the train. We may have run into another train. Oh, look!"" she cried suddenly, pointing with trembling finger to the wreck of the car in front of them. ""Fire, girls! The car's on fire!""""Billie's trunk will have to take its chance,"" Mr. Bradley yelled back at him. Then he added in a changed voice that made the boys stop struggling for a moment and follow the direction of his gaze. ""Here come the fire engines. Maybe we'll save that trunk after all."""
"They did at last succeed in putting out the fire, however, while the girls stood by in an agony of suspense, and finally some of the train hands were allowed to climb into the sodden train and find what luggage, if any, could be saved.""Claim your baggage at the next town, please,"" he said, and, his hard heart softened perhaps by the sight of Billie's anxious face, added by way of explanation: ""All the baggage will be sent to the next town to be claimed in the morning.""""Three miles, sir,"" he said. ""I reckon you'll have to walk it, as they haven't taxi service around here."" He grinned, but Mr. Bradley's face was sober. He was wondering how he was going to get his charges to the next town.When they reached the village fate chose at last to smile upon them--a very little. They found a comfortable little cottage presided over by a comfortable little farmer's wife who first gave them supper and then led them to the best rooms in her house and tucked the girls in bed as if she had been their own mother.Mrs. Jenkins, the farmer's wife, was as pretty and comely as a shining red apple--and just as neat. She said that her husband had gone to a neighboring town to sell some of their stock and would not be back for a week or two. She was so lonely that her guests were as welcome to her as she and her hospitality were welcome to them.Yet in spite of comfortable beds and snowy sheets, the girls slept little. All night long they tossed and turned, and when occasionally, worn out, they would drop into an uncomfortable doze, they would always wake up with a start and a frightened cry. To her great surprise Billie found that not only her father but the boys were up and had for the past half hour been busily engaged in eating a breakfast prepared for them by the rosy and good-natured farmer's wife.If it had not been for the real cause of her excitement the boys might have found amusing her effort to gulp down her whole breakfast in the time one usually takes to drink a cup of coffee. As it was, they sympathized, and once when she choked and became painfully red in the face, Ferd gravely handed her a glass of water and Teddy gallantly offered to pat her on the back.""Go ahead--sleep,"" she said under her breath. ""It isn't your five thousand dollars."" This was hardly fair, seeing that that five thousand dollars meant almost as much to Laura and Violet as to Billie herself in the happiness it would bring.With one last disgusted look she fled from the room and joined the boys and Mr. Bradley in the hall. Mrs. Jenkins had directed them to the station, and, anxious to waste no further time, they set off at once.""It was hard to tell the extent of the damage,"" said Mr. Bradley, anxious to reassure her, yet afraid to raise her hopes too high. ""However,"" he said, quickening his step a little, ""there's the station right before us, so we ought to find out before long.""""That wouldn't do any good,"" said her father, glancing at the piled-up baggage. ""It would only make more confusion. And still----"" He thought for a moment and then suddenly he strode off down the station and toward the guard who had been friendly the night before.Billie could hear nothing, but she saw enough to make her heart beat faster. Mr. Bradley whispered a few words to the man who was at first inclined to be impatient and made a quick gesture as if to wave Mr. Bradley back to his place in the line.""Look!"" cried Billie, clutching his arm. ""They're going to look for something--probably our trunk. No, they're not. Look how excited he is! And Daddy, too! Oh, Chet, what in the world----"" the last words were a wail, and Chet squeezed her hand warningly."
"Billie could stand the suspense no longer, and she rushed forward, grasping her father's arm. The earnest conversation between the guard and Mr. Bradley and their evident excitement had already attracted the attention of the line of people, and now they watched Billie curiously.""Yes. But only to lose it again,"" said her father, and then went on hurriedly to explain. ""The guard says he saw a trunk here only a little while ago that answers our description, but now it's gone. He remembers seeing a suspicious looking man hanging around, and it's barely possible that the man may have stolen it. He also remembers seeing this fellow drive off in a Ford car just a few minutes ago.""""I'll drive,"" announced Teddy; and before any one could have interfered if they had wanted to, he had jumped into the driver's seat and had thrown in the clutch. Teddy was young, but he knew all about cars.""No, thanks,"" he answered, ""I'd rather stay here and watch for some other missing baggage. Good luck!"" and he waved to them as the big car glided forward under Teddy's touch and shot around a turn in the road.""Don't worry,"" Teddy shouted back. ""No start will help a flivver against a car like this. Say, but she's a beauty! Just listen to that engine!"" But Billie was in no mood to listen to anything except the jingle of queer old coins in a shabby old trunk. Then suddenly there came a yell from Teddy and an exclamation from Mr. Bradley.Even as Teddy spoke, the man in the machine ahead of them looked back. Then abruptly, and to the great surprise of Billie and the boys, he stopped his car and began groping wildly in the bottom of it for something.Then, while every second brought them nearer, the man did an astonishing thing. He lifted a small object, which Billie excitedly recognized as the trunk, and with an effort succeeded in getting it over the side of the car.Then he dropped it in the road and turned for a swift moment to look at his pursuers before he started his car again. It was only a moment, but those in the car behind were near enough to get a good look at his face.""Teddy, look out! If you run over my trunk----"" and Teddy swerved so suddenly that she was nearly thrown from the car. However, Chet caught her and put her safely back in the seat; and in another minute Teddy had brought the big car to a sliding standstill.In the bottom of the tonneau,--Billie and the two boys were using it as a foot rest,--was safely stowed the shabby, but, oh! so precious old trunk, and on Billie's face was the ""smile that wouldn't come off;"" or at least that is what Ferd called it.""We should have followed and caught the thief,"" he was saying for the eleventh time--Billie had counted them. ""It would have been like taking candy from a kid to have caught up with his old flivver, and then we could have landed him in jail, where he belongs."""
"""But we wouldn't have time, Teddy,"" Billie reminded him. ""You know the train guard said there would be a train through about eleven o'clock. And we can't miss it. Besides,"" and she shifted her feet happily on her five thousand dollar footstool, ""what do we care about that old man now that we've got the trunk?""""Isn't that just like a girl,"" cried Teddy, almost running them into a ditch in his indignation. ""I suppose you would be willing to let all the thieves in the world go free if you could only get back what they stole.""As the car swept into the village again Billie had a sudden and rather conscience-stricken memory of her chums. For the first time in her life she had forgotten them completely. But then one doesn't lose five thousand dollars and recover it every day!""I didn't run away. I escaped,"" she explained, making a face at the memory of the crowd. ""I wonder what makes people so curious. I do believe all a person would have to do to collect a crowd would be to stand on a soap box and say, 'Isn't this beautiful weather?'""They all went to the kitchen, where they found Mrs. Jenkins just finishing a batch of golden brown crullers. She greeted the girls with a beaming smile and insisted that Laura and Violet sit down while she got them some breakfast.The girls protested that they were making her too much trouble, but she gave them a cruller--""to stop their mouths,"" she said--and then set cheerily to work to fry some more bacon and eggs, putting in a word now and then and listening with a smile to the girls' merry chatter.""You mustn't scold me when you're hungry,"" Billie said, and the gladness in her voice made the girls look at her eagerly. ""No, I'm not going to tell you a word,"" she said firmly as they started to ply her with questions. ""Not till you've had some breakfast, anyway. Eat, pretty creatures, eat.""Mrs. Jenkins seemed almost as excited as they did, and leaned over the table, one hand clutching the bread knife, while her rosy face fairly beamed. Here was adventure such as rarely came to the village.Laura and Violet left their almost untouched breakfast, mumbled an excuse to Mrs. Jenkins, and rushed with Billie up to the bedroom they had occupied the night before to gather up their things and put on their hats and coats.""No, sir,"" she had said, shaking her head decidedly. ""Do you think I'm going to let you pay me for having a good time? I love the girls and boys, bless 'em, and I hate to see 'em go. Pay me--well, I guess not!""Shyly she kissed Mrs. Jenkins' rosy cheek, and Violet and Laura followed suit. The boys and Mr. Bradley shook hands with her heartily, and then they picked up their belongings and fairly ran down the steps and out at the little white gate.They turned to wave to Mrs. Jenkins, and she waved back at them until they disappeared around the corner; and when she started to go into the house she was surprised to find that there were tears in her eyes."
"The next few days were mostly spent in telling wondering and interested home folks about the ghostly happenings at the old homestead that was Billie's inheritance and in recounting in detail the circumstances that led to the discovery of the treasure trunk.And then one night Mr. Bradley came home with the wonderful news that he had sold most of the contents of the old trunk and had realized four thousand three hundred and fifty dollars--and every cent for Billie!""No, I kept out a few coins and stamps that were especially rare and I'll take them to another dealer. I think,"" and he looked at Billie thoughtfully, ""they ought to bring in quite a little pile more.""""Oh, Daddy, it's like a fairy tale!"" Billie cried, and then added, edging around to where her father stood and looking up at him appealingly: ""You and Mother haven't really said it, Dad, but Chet and I will be able to go to boarding school, won't we?""But Billie, young as she was, was beginning to learn that no matter how perfect a thing seems, there is almost sure to be a fly in the ointment somewhere; and it was not long before she discovered the fly in the present case.It was one beautiful bright day, the kind that only early autumn knows, and the chums were walking down the main street of North Bend eagerly discussing plans and talking of the fun they would have at Three Towers Hall when suddenly Billie espied Miss Beggs, the English teacher whose statue she had broken, coming out of a drug store.With a great wave of happiness that now she could pay for the statue, or at least replace the one she had broken, she hurried forward and spoke to the English teacher as she was about to enter another store.""Over four thousand dollars!"" cried the teacher when Billie stopped for lack of breath. ""Why, Billie, isn't that marvelous? It sounds like a story. What,"" she added, smiling down into the eager face, ""do you intend to do with all that wealth?""""I know you did. But since you had mended it so it looked all right, it was almost as good as new, wasn't it? You mustn't say 'no,'"" she added quickly, as she saw Miss Beggs was about to interrupt, ""for it won't do the slightest bit of good. I'm not going to buy anything for myself till I replace that statue.""""I can see that nobody has a chance to change your mind, Billie Bradley, when it's once made up,"" she said with a smile, then added as the girls turned toward home: ""I know what I shall name my new statue. Her name shall be 'Billie.'""Amanda Peabody was probably the most unpopular girl in North Bend. The girls disliked her as real girls always dislike a sneak and tattle-tale. Amanda was always spying around, minding everybody's business but her own, and making a general nuisance of herself.""Hello!"" she accosted the girls, then turned to Billie with a more pronounced grin. ""I've heard all about the money you found in that awful old house. You must feel like a regular Captain Kidd, don't you?""""Since I never was sure how Captain Kidd felt, I don't know,"" said Billie coolly, although she could feel the blood slowly mounting into her face. Oh, if she could only do what she wanted to, Amanda Peabody wouldn't be smiling very long!""Oh, but it's too awful!"" burst out Billie suddenly. ""Why, girls, it's apt to spoil our whole year! Just think of having that sneak around, prying into all our affairs and reporting every little thing we do."""
"""Well, I won't quarrel with you about it,"" said Billie, calmly adding with a little chuckle: ""If we try to have any midnight feast at Three Towers with sweet Amanda wandering round loose we will have to appoint a guard to stand outside the door and warn us.""""But I don't know what good a guard would do anyway,"" said Laura dolefully. ""There's something creepy about the way Amanda finds out things. You think she's miles away and the next day she tells you more about what you did than you know yourself.""However, their parents sent them to bed early--and not without difficulty was this feat accomplished--on the night before the great day, and the morning found them refreshed and wildly eager for this new adventure.As, in her own little room, Billie regarded her flushed reflection in the mirror it seemed impossible to make herself realize that she was really going to Three Towers Hall at last--Three Towers which had been the height of her ambition from the time she had entered the grammar school.She was beginning to feel quite grown up--which was perhaps the reason she regarded her new and very pretty brown hat with a critical eye and smoothed down her new and very pretty brown dress with hands that trembled with excitement.""Well, I think I'm all ready now,"" she said at last, and gave a little, half-frightened glance around the familiar room. She wondered how it would seem to sleep in a strange place with no mother or father near by.However, she did not feel very grown-up when a moment later she met her mother in the hall and saw traces of tears on her face. For Mother had no new scenes to go to and the departure of her two noisy children would leave the house strangely quiet and subdued.After that Chet came in, wrestled with the same troublesome lump in his throat, told his mother, ""Not to worry, Mumsey, he'd write every day, and she mustn't forget to write for he was going to miss her awfully,"" and then Mr. Bradley joined them and they all started for the station.""Do you suppose Ferd will catch up to us?"" she asked of Teddy. Teddy was looking unusually handsome this morning--at least so Billie thought--and she was surprised to find that he was walking beside her. ""It would be awful if he made us miss the train.""The young folks were so taken up in the leave taking that they failed to notice two girls who got on the train just after them. Even if they had not been able to see the faces of these newcomers, an overheard sentence or two would have given them the clue to their identity.""Never mind,"" said the other with a malicious grin. ""I guess I gave them rather a jolt the other day when I told them I was going to Three Towers too. I guess they thought they owned the place and ought to have it all to themselves.""They were still leaning out of the window, calling to those left on the platform and answering injunctions ""not to get killed"" from their mothers and to ""please be careful and not get into any more scrapes than they could help"" from their fathers, when the guard shouted a warning and the train started off.For a moment they all felt a little lost and queer, though nothing in the world could have made them confess to the feeling. But the little wave of homesickness soon passed off, swallowed up by the vision of the amazing adventure ahead of them.Before the little party had stowed away their baggage and taken off their wraps, several boys and girls they had known at school came over to greet them and talk things over, and Billie, leaning over to rescue a box of chocolates that had fallen at her feet, suddenly looked up and right into the beaming face of Nellie Bane.Nellie was a friend of the chums who had rather expected to go to Three Towers Hall with them at first. But Mr. and Mrs. Bane had suddenly decided to go to Europe and take Nellie with them, which had rather upset Nellie's plans. And now here she was on the train with them.""Glad,"" said Nellie without a moment's hesitation. ""I want to go to Europe, of course. But I can go there any old time, and I was simply wild to go to Three Towers with you girls. You'll never know how jealous I was,"" she ended with a sigh."
"They laughed, and thereupon entered into a spirited conversation that lasted until Ferd interrupted to inquire what they were keeping the chocolates to themselves for, anyway. Did they think they had a corner on the chocolate market? To this Billie answered by holding out the whole box, showing that they had been too busy talking even to open it.""Amanda Peabody,"" he explained. ""She is sitting with another girl who looks as if she might be a second edition of Amanda. There! Away at the end of the car! You surely missed a lot by not seeing them.""Hardly knowing what she was doing, Billie found her hat and coat, put them on, and then sat on the very edge of her seat with her gladstone bag grasped tightly in one hand. Then she looked around at Laura who was sitting in the seat beside her.It was then she got her surprise. For Laura was sitting in almost the same position as herself, perched on the edge of the seat, bag tightly gripped in one hand, pocketbook in the other and--this was the fact that made Billie chuckle--Laura's hat was very much over one eye.""Oh, isn't he funny?"" gibed Laura making a face at him. Then she grabbed wildly at her bag as one of the excited girls seemed bent upon carrying it off with her. ""Say, come back with that,"" she cried. ""Isn't one enough for you?""However, they did succeed at last in getting themselves safely on the station platform. It was a pretty station, and this being their first glimpse of the place where they were going to spend so much time, they looked about them with interest.Molata was the nearest town to Three Towers Hall and Boxton Military Academy. Both of these schools were situated on Lake Molata, for which the town had been named. Most of the inhabitants of Molata were wealthy, and the estates in and about the town were magnificent. There was also a large hotel, filled during the summer season.Even the station was in keeping with the general air of prosperity. In the minute the girls had to look about them, they saw a stone-built waiting room with a red-tiled roof. A beautiful green velvety lawn completely surrounded the station on three sides, while on one side a beautiful fountain sent its sparkling spray high into the clear air. And further back through the trees they caught glimpses of beautiful estates.They found themselves being hustled toward the other end of the station where two conveyances, one from Three Towers Hall and the other from Boxton Military Academy, were waiting to take the girls and boys to their destination.""Yes, and if we're going to,"" Billie added, ""I guess we'd better get started. Come on, girls. Everybody's in but us. Good-bye, Chet! Good-bye, Ferd and Teddy! Please be good and don't get sent home the first week--we wouldn't have anybody to give us that row, you know. Good-bye--good-bye----"""
"""Isn't this a wonderful road?"" said Billie, screwing her head around so that she could look out the window. The machine had two long seats on either side, running from the front to the back of it so that, in turning, Billie accidentally stuck her elbow into the girl next to her.She had not noticed the girl, but now, when the latter spoke, Billie turned around quickly. The girl was Eliza Dilks, Amanda Peabody's chum, and beside her sat Amanda herself looking on with her usual sneering grin.""Well,"" said Billie at last, letting her gaze travel from Eliza's mean face to her ill-fitting shoes--somewhere Billie had heard that people hate to have you look at their feet--""maybe you'd better move. There's lots more room on the other side.""The girls chuckled. Laura said: ""Good for you, Billie,"" under her breath, and Eliza flushed angrily. She seemed about to speak, but as Billie was still gazing steadily at her feet she looked down at them herself and thereby lost the battle.However, the incident had made them miss some of the prettiest scenery in Molata, and it was almost with a feeling of regret that the girls saw the majestic three towers of Three Towers Hall rise before them.A smooth velvety lawn sloped down straight to the water, and the girls cried out at this, their first glimpse of Lake Molata. Through the trees, the water of the lake glistened and shimmered and danced while the soft rippling sound of tiny wavelets lapping at the bank seemed to call to them invitingly.""Miss Walters!"" Always she had seemed to Billie a person to be looked up to--a sort of goddess set apart from ordinary mortals. For Miss Sara Walters had been head of Three Towers Hall for a number of years--always, it seemed to Billie. And now Billie was actually going to see her, talk to her, perhaps even make her take notice of her, Billie, above the others!Miss Walters was only thirty-five, but her hair was snow white and framed her face in thick wavy masses. Her complexion was pink and white, and her dark violet eyes looked almost black under their dark lashes. And her figure was that of a girl of twenty. Miss Walters took the girls into her office, looked up the cards she had made out for them--for of course their names had been sent in some time before as prospective students at Three Towers Hall--and then called in another teacher, Miss Ada Dill, who had part charge of the dormitories.Miss Dill was tall and thin with sharp black eyes and white hair drawn severely back from her forehead. She smiled when Miss Walters introduced her to the girls, but her smile reminded Billie of the smile on the face of a Chinese idol which she and her chums had come upon among the antiques of the old homestead at Cherry Corners. It was merely a crack in her face and the beady black eyes remained unsmiling.""Miss Dill,"" Miss Walters told the girls, ""will show you your places in the dormitories and will give you the hours for meals and such other information as you will need at first. Lunch will be served in half an hour, and after that you may have the rest of the day to yourselves to become acquainted with Three Towers Hall.""They met several girls on their way to the dormitory, and the latter looked at them curiously. The girls learned a little later that these students had spent the summer at Three Towers, although most of the girls had gone home to relatives and friends and would not be back until the next day.""Wasn't that a pretty girl?"" Vi whispered to Billie, as Miss Ada Dill opened the dormitory door and a lovely girl with very pink cheeks and very black hair stopped for a word with the teacher and then hurried past the girls on her way downstairs. ""I wonder who she is."""
"Then they stepped into the long, many-windowed room and looked about them curiously. There were beds, beds, beds and more beds. Everywhere the girls looked they seemed to see nothing but beds. As a matter of fact there were only ten of them, but the girls could have sworn there were at least twice that number.Of course Billie spoke up for herself and Laura and Vi, and after regarding her severely through her glasses for a moment, Miss Dill finally assigned three beds at the further end of the room to the chums.The girls sank down upon their beds and looked about them curiously. There was a little wash basin and a towel rack beside each snowy white bed and on the towel rack hung several small towels with blue and white borders.Below them stretched the velvety lawn dotted with the darker green of shrubbery, while away through the trees glimmered and gleamed the water of Lake Molata. The day was warm for autumn, and a gentle breeze played among the leaves of the great trees bordering the lake, coming to the girls in a soft, rustling whisper. The picture was almost too perfect to be true.At that moment the door opened and the pretty girl that had passed them in the hall entered and shut the door softly behind her. In the bright light of the room she seemed even prettier than she had in the hall, but there was something about her--Billie could hardly have told what, perhaps it was the expression of her mouth--that made Billie instinctively dislike her.The strange girl's eyes rested on Amanda and Eliza where they sat in their corner, talking in whispers, and her lips curled disdainfully. Then she came over to where Billie and her friends were standing.""Hello!"" she said with a quick smile. ""You're the new girls, I suppose, and we might as well get acquainted right away. My name is Rose Belser, and I'm from Brighting,"" mentioning a town several miles the other side of North Bend.""We're awfully glad to know you,"" Billie answered, with her own particular friendly smile. ""I'm Beatrice Bradley, and these are my two chums, Violet Farrington and Laura Jordon. We're from North Bend.""""Why, I'd love to spend the summer here,"" said Vi, thinking of the beautiful country they had glimpsed and the lovely lake where one might row or canoe to his heart's content. ""The country's so pretty, and you have the lake----""""Oh, the lake!"" the girl interrupted impatiently. ""And the country! I'm tired to death of the lake and the country. I want to go to the city where you can wear pretty clothes and go to parties and things.""""Yes. And the sister is worse,"" said the girl, with a little grimace. ""They are Miss Ada and Miss Cora, and Miss Cora is the terror of the Hall. If it weren't for Miss Walters----But say, you'd better hurry,"" she interrupted herself suddenly and jumped to her feet. ""It's almost time for the lunch gong to ring, and if you're late for lunch, Miss Cora will be furious. She has charge of the dining hall, you know. You'd better wash and straighten your hair. Miss Cora looks you through with a gimlet eye."""
"""Oh, dear, we forgot all about lunch, and we must be a sight!"" cried Vi, pulling off her hat and excitedly patting her hair. ""Girls, we haven't any combs--our trunks haven't come up yet. Give me a comb, somebody! Oh, here's one in my grip.""""Well, you'd better get busy and use it,"" Violet retorted, drawing her own comb through her heavy hair, ""or you'll get in bad the very first day. Oh, dear! there's the gong."" She stopped with her comb in the air and gazed in horror at the girls. As for Billie and Laura, they stood as if they had suddenly become paralyzed.""If you'd start in time you'd be ready in time,"" said a nasal voice from the other end of the room, and the girls glanced around quickly. They had been so absorbed in their new experience that for a time they had completely forgotten Amanda and Eliza. But now they turned just in time to see the two girls leaving the room. As she shut the door behind her Amanda gave it a defiant little slam.It was a new experience for Billie Bradley and for Laura and Violet--that hour in the dining hall. The hall itself was an immense room and seemed at first glance to be made up almost entirely of windows. As Rose Belser afterward remarked to the girls, there was one thing that no one at Three Towers Hall had to complain of, and that was lack of light.Most of the girls had already assembled when the chums reached the dining hall. They were standing around in little groups of two or three, talking excitedly, and while the girls were hesitating which group to join Miss Cora Dill swept into the room.""Now you'd better mind your Ps and Qs,"" Rose whispered to them, and the girls regarded with interest the second of the Dill twin sisters who had been called by the disrespectful name of the ""Twin Dill Pickles.""Miss Cora Dill was indeed Miss Ada's counter-part. There was the same thin figure and straight back, the same black eyes and thin-lipped mouth, the only difference being that where Miss Ada's hair was white, Miss Cora's hair still retained some traces of its original brown color.""Goodness, I'm glad there's some way we can tell them apart,"" said Billie to Laura in an under-tone. ""If they were just exactly alike we'd have to do with them the way they do with twin babies--tie a blue ribbon on one and a pink ribbon on the other.""At first the girls were not at all sure whether they were supposed to talk or not, for the presence of thin-lipped Miss Cora at the head of the table threw rather a damper on both their enthusiasm and their appetites.But every once in a while, when the talk and laughter about the table threatened to become too hilarious, the girls were conscious of Miss Cora's voice reminding them that the table was the ""place for decorum--not for rioting.""Billie and her chums were half way down the table, a fact for which they were very thankful. Placed only two or three seats away from Miss Cora, at the head of the table, was Nellie Bane. Nellie seemed to have struck up a sudden friendship with one of the half dozen girls who had spent the summer at the school, and the two were evidently having an interesting conversation.""You will each find a set of rules on your dresser,"" she said. ""And before you do anything else it will be well for each girl to become thoroughly acquainted with them and the penalties for breaking them. After to-day any departure from the rules will meet with the proper punishment."""
"""Oh, you'll soon get used to her,"" Rose assured them. She seemed to have attached herself definitely to the girls, who, although they found her amusing and interesting, would rather have been left to themselves on this first day. ""Everybody dislikes her at first--and Miss Ada, too--but they only laugh at them after awhile. You see,"" she finished as if the girls must understand, ""we have Miss Walters.""""Well, all I have to say,"" said Laura, whose temper had been considerably ruffled by this second of the ""Twin Dill Pickles,"" ""is that it's lucky Miss Walters and not Miss Cora is at the head of things.""When the girls reached the dormitory they looked for the rules, found them, and sat down eagerly to read them over together. First of all they found that the dormitories, eleven in all, were lettered. The letter of their dormitory was ""C.""There were the usual rules about late hours, going outside the grounds without leave, neglecting to wear rubbers in the rain, all with the usual penalties attached. But the one that most interested the girls was the punishment given for keeping lights on after hours.""Three days without recreation and isolation in the dormitory for the duration of that period,"" read Billie indignantly. ""Goodness! I wonder if all that happens to you if you keep your light on five minutes after hours.""""It does if Miss Cora or Miss Ada catches you,"" drawled Rose, from where she was curled up again on the foot of the bed watching the girls with lazy interest. ""Some of the teachers are all right. There's Miss Harris, and Miss Race the math teacher. If they catch you just a few minutes over time they'll give you a lecture and let you off without reporting it to Miss Walters. But if it's any of the others--look out, that's all.""Nellie's new acquaintance was a small fluffy little blonde whom the girls liked right away. Her name was Constance Danvers, called ""Connie"" for short, and the name seemed to suit her exactly. Of course, she and Rose Belser, having spent the preceding year together, knew each other well, but Billie noticed that the two girls did not seem over friendly.""Only,"" thought Billie to herself, as they ran down the stairs, ""I would like to know where those two sneaks are and why they didn't come back to the dormitory. I know they'll _try_ to spoil all our fun, even if they can't _do_ it."" How the girls did enjoy the rest of that afternoon! Connie and Rose showed them the classrooms and lecture rooms, told them little stories about the different teachers and recounted funny incidents of school life that made the girls bubble with laughter.""Too many,"" drawled Rose, sinking down in one of the seats and spreading out her ruffled dress carefully. The girls had been too excited to notice the dress before, but now they saw it was much more elaborate than any they had brought with them, except one or two apiece for party wear.""I wonder if all the girls dress like that for every day,"" thought Billie in a sort of panic, looking down at the pretty little brown cloth dress she had thought so wonderful at home. She wondered if Vi and Laura felt the same way.Around the gymnasium were all sorts of swinging ladders and standing ladders. There were punching bags and medicine balls; in fact, everything calculated to make strong healthy women of the girls who came to Three Towers Hall."
"There was a swimming pool, also, and over this the girls went into raptures. They had had scarcely any opportunity to learn to swim in North Bend, and although on their visits to New York they had never failed--that is, in the summer time--to take a dip, or several of them, in the Atlantic Ocean, they had never learned to swim more than a few strokes at a time.""A swimming pool!"" cried Billie. ""I suppose we might have known we would have one here. Now we can really learn to swim. I wonder,"" and so interested had she been with her own affairs that this was the first time she had even given the boys a thought, ""if Chet and Teddy and Ferd have a swimming pool at Boxton Academy.""""She'll be friendly to almost any girl if she happens to like her brother,"" she thought, and instinctively she glanced at Laura. The latter must have had almost the same thought, for she gave Billie a meaning glance.""Well, there's Billie's brother and mine and a chum of theirs, Ferd Stowing. They came with us as far as Molata. Then they left us for the Academy and we came on here. And we were having such a good time we never thought about them,"" she finished penitently.The girls were eager to look about the grounds of Three Towers after that, but Rose would not let them go till she had found out all about the boys and their ""life history,"" as Billie resentfully said later. After that the girls noticed that she was even more friendly than she had been before.""Oh, well,"" said Billie to herself, feeling strangely comforted by the thought, ""she won't have much of a chance to see the boys, anyway, because we can only leave the grounds on special permission and they won't be able to get away from the Academy to come here very often. I suppose I'm an awful cat,"" she finished ruefully, ""but I'm not going to let her meet any of our boys if I can help it.""""I should say not,"" answered Rose, with a little toss of her head. ""You have to learn to swim in the pool first so that if you upset your boat you won't get drowned. It's their great boast that no girl has ever been drowned at Three Towers.""""Sometimes it's a teacher,"" Connie spoke up. ""But as a rule it's one of the older girls in the first grade who teaches the younger ones. Miss Walters said,"" and her fair face flushed with pleasure, ""that perhaps next semester I shall be appointed as instructor.""""Oh, isn't that great?"" cried Billie heartily, for she was beginning to like Connie Danvers with all her heart. Then, too, she had noticed with a feeling of relief that Connie was not dressed like Rose Belser. She had on a pretty cloth dress very much like Billie's own. ""And she didn't seem crazy to know all about the boys,"" she added, with an added warmth around her heart.Billie flushed with pleasure and Rose Belser looked at her with new interest. For if Rose was not the most popular girl at Three Towers she certainly thought she was and the praise of Billie's friends started her thinking. Could it be possible that here was a rival? But she shook her dark head impatiently. If this Billie Bradley thought she could start anything, why, she, Rose, would show her, that was all!"
"They had come down to a little dock that jutted out into the lake and had been hidden from their view, or at least partly so, by the trees. Now, as they came out upon it, they stood astonished and delighted by the sight that met their eyes.The canoes were each neatly covered with a tarpaulin, but the tarpaulin, drawn tight, revealed the long graceful outline of each beautiful little boat, and the girls fairly ached to launch one of them upon the water.""But who would row when they could canoe?"" cried Billie, for in Billie was a passion for canoes which Chet had always declared must have come from her Indian ancestors. ""I think rowboats are horribly clumsy.""""Oh, we can,"" Rose answered. ""But no one likes it very much. They'd rather do their swimming in the swimming pool. There's a mud bottom to the lake, and the water, though it looks mighty nice, isn't good to drink.""While they were speaking two girls whom the chums remembered having seen in the dining hall but did not know came down to the dock, and, after waving to Rose and Connie, went to a rack and started to take down one of the canoes.One girl with a skill born of experience jumped into the front seat of the canoe, lifted one of the paddles and waited while her companion settled herself in the stern seat. Then they glided from the dock softly, almost silently but for the dip of the paddles in the water, and drifted out toward the middle of the lake. The girls sat up till the very last minute that night, discussing the absorbing happenings of the day. Rose left them to talk to some of the other girls--a fact for which they were thankful--and Nellie and Connie Danvers went to their dormitory, leaving the three chums alone at last.""I tell you what let's do,"" said Billie, patting her brown curls into place before her mirror and noticing with surprise how flushed her face was and how her eyes sparkled. How could she know, being modest, that not only her friends, but almost all the girls that had seen them together, thought her even prettier than Rose Belser.""Well, that's just what I was going to say,"" Billie answered, turning away from the mirror and flinging herself on the bed beside her. ""Only I thought it would be more comfortable if we got into our nighties. It's been a pretty warm day----""""Billie, you're a wonder,"" cried Laura, jumping up and fishing in her bag for her nightgown. ""When it comes to thinking you have it all over us like a tent--as Teddy says,"" she added apologetically, and the girls laughed at her.""Isn't Miss Walters lovely?"" asked Billie, when she was at last curled up happily on the foot of the bed with Vi at the head of it and Laura stretched out full length with a pillow tucked beneath her head.""The only thing that bothers me,"" said Billie, with a little frown, ""is that we didn't go after that man and get him. He may be a regular thief for all we know, and if he is he ought to be in prison where he belongs. Every once in a while,"" her voice lowered and she looked over her shoulder nervously, ""I dream about him, and when I do he always has a mask or something over his eyes, but his codfish mouth is always there sort of grinning at me----""""No, only once or twice,"" said Billie. ""Just the same, I wish we could have caught him. I always have a sort of feeling that if he robs anybody else it will be our fault for not having had him arrested when we had the chance. Of course, he may not be a regular thief at all. But, oh, girls, he was an awful looking thing. And I feel sure some day I'll meet him again."""
"""You said he had red hair, didn't you?"" asked Laura, a delicious little thrill running up and down her spine. ""And little eyes and that broad codfishy mouth. Goodness! I wish I'd been with you when you chased him. It must have been no end of fun.""""Oh, I don't know,"" said Laura, putting the pillow under her head and lying down again. ""Sometimes when I'm very brave I wish something really exciting would happen--you know, a burglary or something. I'd just like to see what I'd do.""Billie woke early that morning and found the sun shining gloriously through the window. It took her a minute or two to realize just where she was. Then she sat up in bed and looked across at her two sleeping chums.""You'd better stop talking and get up,"" Rose called to them, flinging back her black hair and jumping to her feet. ""We have only half an hour to get ready for breakfast, and if you're late and haven't any excuse--well, don't expect any sympathy from Miss Cora, that's all.""There was great excitement in the dining hall, for this was the day when the old students of Three Towers Hall were expected, and the girls who had remained at the school for the summer vacation were eager to renew old friendships.The new girl in question was a nice looking, rather serious girl who wore glasses and looked to the girls--so they said later--as if she might really like to study. She was carrying a grip and had evidently just arrived.While the girls watched, she and Rose turned and started in their direction. For a minute Billie could have sworn Rose did not mean to stop. However, she did stop, and rather reluctantly introduced the stranger to them.""This is Caroline Brant,"" she said, adding as she turned to the strange girl with a queer little smile: ""These are some of the new girls who are in our dorm, Caroline. Billie Bradley, Violet Farrington and Laura Jordon.""Caroline Brant shook hands and smiled a grave smile that seemed ""just made to go with her glasses,"" Laura said afterward. When the girl had passed on with Rose toward the stairway, the chums had a queer sense of comfort--as though they had found at least one good friend at Three Towers Hall.Lunch came and went, and so absorbed were the girls in the fun and excitement of meeting new girls and listening to stories of good times had during the summer that dinner caught them before they knew it and they found that the day was gone.Everybody went to bed early that night, for Miss Walters had sent around an order that all lights should be out by nine o'clock sharp. The next day the real work of the term was to begin, and she wanted all her girls bright and fresh for the start.The next week would have been perfect for the girls, but for one thing. They liked their classrooms, which occupied all the second and third floors, they liked their studies, and they loved most of their teachers--especially Miss Race, the mathematics teacher.The Dill twins never seemed to miss an opportunity to make the girls feel bad. They were sarcastic in class, and seemed to take real delight in hurting the feelings of their pupils whenever it was possible."
"It was only a few days after the opening of the school year when Billie had her first little set-to with Miss Cora Dill. The latter had just finished calling the roll and had pushed the book from her. Then she looked sharply at Billie.""But 'Billie' is a boy's name,"" said Miss Cora tartly, boring Billie through with her black eyes. ""And it is extremely unladylike for a girl to bear a boy's name. Extremely unladylike,"" she repeated, staring at poor Billie, who was as red as a beet and filled with a wild desire to run away and cry.So she just looked up in thin-lipped Miss Cora's face and said very quietly: ""I never thought about my name being unladylike, Miss Cora, and I'm sure it hasn't made any difference with me. Mother says that it is the way one acts that counts.""Rose Belser viewed this new state of affairs calmly at first, then with alarm, and later with dismay. That a new girl should come to Three Towers and immediately begin to shoulder herself into the limelight was unthinkable, impossible, it couldn't be done. And yet Billie Bradley was doing it!After a while she began to draw away from Billie, look indifferent when one of the girls spoke of her praisingly, slighted her in a hundred little ways that Billie herself could hardy put her finger on. And yet she felt it.Billie had one other constant enemy at Three Towers, and that was Miss Cora. Miss Cora never missed a chance to humiliate her--or at least try to humiliate her. But Billie was so happy and having such a wonderful time that she never gave these attempts any more attention than she would so many mosquito bites, thereby fanning Miss Cora's dislike of her.Meanwhile the two Miss Dills grew more and more sour and crabbed until the girls began to wonder ""why they didn't die of it."" Then one noon time Laura came running into the dormitory, her eyes big and round with excitement.""What do you think?"" she cried, while the girls gathered round her. ""I heard Miss Cora and Miss Ada talking together. I was in the lab and they were in the hall and they didn't know I was anywhere around.""""That was about all."" Laura had gone over to the wash basin and was washing her hands hard as though to get some of her dislike of the ""Dill Pickles"" out of her system. ""I was so surprised I couldn't help hearing a couple of sentences. Then I coughed and came out of the lab and they looked as if they'd like to kill me. 'The girls are getting altogether too much to eat,' said Miss Ada."" Laura mimicked her to perfection. ""'Yes,' said Miss Cora, 'we must give them less--a good deal less.'""Several weeks had passed, and this afternoon the five of them, Laura Jordon, Vi, Nellie Bane, Connie Danvers and Billie, were sitting close together at the very farthest end of Billie's dormitory talking over some plans that made them feel delightfully like conspirators."
"For although Caroline Brant had proved a good friend to the chums, especially to Billie, they had tried in vain to draw her into their little escapades. She was what the girls usually referred to scornfully as ""a grind,"" yet, strange to say, they all loved her.She willingly helped them with their lessons, had often coached some of the more backward of them for tests, passing them when otherwise they would have hopelessly flunked, and cheerfully helped them out of scrapes when they needed help.She was just about to tell Rose the plans and invite her to the party when the door opened again and Amanda entered with Eliza Dilks. Amanda was never seen without Eliza trailing along in the background, and for this reason the girls had nicknamed the latter, ""The Shadow.""Wherever anything was going on, especially of a secret nature, Amanda and ""The Shadow"" were sure to be prying about, saying mean little things, forcing the girls to move over to some other place where they could be private for a little while.Then to Rose, still fussing with her hair before the mirror, came the dawn of an idea. It would be hard to do anything to hurt Billie herself, for, whatever her faults, Rose was not a sneak. But she might make use of Amanda----Each girl had been instructed to learn some little piece or poem which she was to recite on the great occasion. Some of the girls protested on the ground that they were poor at memorizing, but Billie had been firm.And Billie, full of energy and enthusiasm, had gone to work and got up a regular program with the names of the girls and the recitations they would give. Laura and Vi had helped her make duplicates of the program so that there was one for each girl.Billie's chums called her a witch, for since Caroline Brant had come to Three Towers Hall she had never been known to take a hand in one adventure, no matter how harmless it may have been. And Rose, growing more and more resentful as she saw even her most faithful followers deserting her for Billie, became more sure that she would have to make use of Amanda and ""The Shadow.""Neither Billie nor any of the other girls knew Caroline Brant's real reason for accepting Billie's invitation. The fact was that Caroline had fallen in love with Billie at first sight, perhaps because she was just the opposite of Caroline herself, and had since become as fond of her as if she had been her younger sister.And then there was that fourth enemy of Billie's, Miss Cora Dill. Caroline knew that if Miss Cora were to catch Billie in any sort of scrape she would never in the world give her the benefit of the doubt.And most of all, Caroline knew that Billie, with her imp of mischief, would be the very last to try to keep out of a scrape, and that sooner or later one of her four enemies would get just the proof she wanted to take to Miss Walters.And all this, nobody seeing Caroline, quiet, reserved, studying furiously for the mid-term examinations that were coming dangerously near, would have guessed at. Nor would they have guessed that Caroline was breaking her rule and going to Billie's party simply to keep Billie from harm. It was a wonder any of the girls could keep their minds on their lessons that morning. As a matter of fact, they recited so poorly for Miss Ada and Miss Cora that the two ""Dill Pickles"" turned sourer than ever and threatened to report them to Miss Walters.These containers held cold meat and pickles from the delicatessen shop near by. There was jelly. Olives and biscuits and fancy cakes with foolish icing on top were there--everything in fact that goes to the making of a first class midnight feast.Miss Ada Dill, making her evening round of the dormitories to see that all was well and every girl in her place, found nothing to arouse her suspicions until she came to Billie's dormitory. Then she paused, started to close the door, opened it again and stood still, intently listening.And it was Billie who, in her eagerness not to be discovered, almost gave the thing away. For Billie was snoring, gently but decidedly snoring, and to Miss Ada's trained ear, the snore did not sound natural."
"Poor little Billie! Afterward she could laugh at it, but at the time it seemed nothing short of a nightmare. She knew that Laura and Vi and Rose and Caroline were awake and waiting for the terrible moment when Miss Ada should discover the conspiracy.If she could only keep on snoring for a minute longer! thought Billie desperately. And then the unbelievable thing happened. Instead of commanding her in no uncertain tones to get out of bed, Miss Ada turned--slowly but surely turned--and marched out of the room.Five ghostly figures sat up in bed, pushed back the bed clothes, and slid silently to the floor. Once on their feet they shed their nightgowns and their dark dresses only made a blurr in the blackness of the room.Caroline, the last to leave the dormitory, stopped for a moment and looked about at the sleeping girls. Then, satisfied that they were really asleep and that none of them suspected the prank, she followed the other girls out into the hall and closed the door carefully behind her.They found their fellow conspirators in dormitory ""F"" already up and stirring. The lights were lit, hampers were out on the table ready to be opened, and the real fun of the party was commencing when the five arrived.""Well, I think you deserve a gold medal,"" said Laura loyally. ""If it had been me----"" this wasn't correct English, but Laura was too excited to notice it--""I'd have giggled or something and given the whole thing away.""Rose had been very quiet, for her, and there was a queer expression in her eyes when she looked at Billie that would have made the latter wonder if she had had time to notice it. However, there was one girl who did notice it, and that was Caroline Brant.Strangely enough, it was Rose who drew the blank that made her ""guardian of the portal"" for the first twenty minutes. At the end of that time the girls would draw again and let another poor unfortunate take her place.Rose was inclined to grumble at her hard luck at first, for she wanted to be in the fun as much as any of the girls. But suddenly there came to her an idea--a way that she might punish Billie for daring to become so popular at Three Towers Hall.Of course, she could not hurt Billie without hurting all the rest of the girls but--her lips shut tight and her eyes narrowed to slits--goodness knew they deserved it. It was they who had helped to make Billie so popular.Then, as she passed Amanda Peabody's cot, just a little jostling to awaken her and the thing would be as good as done. Amanda, seeing the light, would be sure to investigate, and, while she was gone, she, Rose, could undress quickly, put on her gown, and slip into bed. Then when the discovery came--and Rose knew Amanda well enough to be sure there would be a discovery--she would be safe in bed and unsuspected. That is, unless the girls should tell.But how would they know? She could tell them that she had slipped into dormitory ""C"" to get a handkerchief--or something else, she could think that up later--and while she was gone, Amanda had slipped out and given the alarm. It was all very simple."
"But here was her chance, if she was going to do it--and it might be her only one. One of the girls was giving a whispered and funny recitation, and the girls were doubled up with laughter, fairly holding on to themselves to keep from making a noise.""Well, I care a lot, if you don't,"" retorted Caroline, urging the excited girl back toward the lighted dormitory. ""I don't know what you're so mad about anyway,"" she added, as Rose glared at her. ""Your time for playing guard was up, and when I came over to tell you about it I found you were gone.""Caroline was fibbing--or, at least, partly so--but Rose had no way of knowing that. What she did know was that she had made a goose of herself for nothing, and all at once she hated Caroline more than she hated Billie or any one else on earth.But she did not dare show it. The only thing for her to do was to try to pass the thing off the best she could. So when they reached the door she looked up at Caroline with the best smile she could manage and tried hard to keep her voice steady.""I'll stand watch for a while,"" she said, adding as the girls started to protest: ""It's hot in here and it's cool in the hall, and I need cooling off. Will somebody hand me a sandwich once in a while?""The rest of that evening was not very pleasant for either Caroline or Rose. Caroline was wondering whether she ought to tell Billie and the other girls that she had found Rose sneaking, yes, actually sneaking, into the room across the hall when she should have been at her post.""Of course, I don't know that she was going to do anything wrong,"" she kept telling herself, yet in her heart she knew that Rose had been up to some mischief. ""But it isn't fair to Billie not to say anything,"" she worried. ""I know Rose, and she's sure to try to get even some time, and Billie ought to be told to look out."" And all the time she was thinking, her ears were strained for the slightest noise below stairs.And so she stayed on and on, trying to act as if nothing were the matter, laughing and joking with the other girls, eating sandwiches and cake till she was sick of the very sight of them, while all the time she was wondering, wondering, what Caroline was going to do.But all the time she knew that just leaving her post at the door when so much depended upon the girls not being discovered was a terrible thing and one that the girls would find it hard to forgive should they find her out.As the hour hand of the little clock on Nellie's dresser crept near to midnight the girls packed up the fragments of the feast, and, after they had pushed the baskets out of sight under the beds, drew their chairs together to form a semi-circle and began joyfully to tell the most blood-curdling ghost stories they knew.""But I don't know any ghost stories, and I'm no good at making them up,"" she protested when the girls looked at her expectantly. ""I like adventure stories about treasure hunting and robbers and murderers and things----""""We caught one one time on a family fishing trip,"" said one of the girls, taking it for granted that this particular codfish was of the swimming variety, ""and we had fried codfish steaks for a week afterward.""This was almost too much for the girls, who were beginning to think that Billie and Laura and Vi had suddenly gone crazy, but Billie hurried on to explain about the ""Codfish,"" growing more and more interested in her story as she went on.As for the girls, well, they simply hung on her words, and when she came to the part where the thief had dropped her precious trunk in the roadway they exclaimed so loudly that Caroline had to warn them to be quiet. By this time the guard at the door had been removed, as there was little danger of discovery at so late an hour.""But you should have caught him,"" Nellie objected. Though Nellie had heard of Billie's wonderful good fortune in finding the old trunk, she had never heard the details of the part the ""Codfish"" had played in it until to-night. ""It gives me the shivers to think that an awful thing like that, with red hair and a fishy mouth, should be wandering around loose."""
"""Speaking of dreams,"" said Billie, getting to her feet so quickly that she almost upset the girl beside her, ""don't you all think we'd better get back to our dorm? It's after midnight, and--I'm awfully afraid of Miss Ada.""Shivering a little, she crept into bed and drew the covers up under her chin. It would never do to be discovered by Miss Ada at this last minute, and she certainly could not do any good by standing there staring out of the window.Whoever the man was, he had gone now and would not return. But could she be sure of that? Suppose he had been a thief--she shivered and drew the covers over her head. In that case she should have roused Miss Ada and told her the story.For more than an hour she lay, too excited to sleep, shivering at any sudden sound, wondering--wondering. Toward morning she fell asleep, only to dream of picnics where one did nothing but catch codfish and eat them, of a strange man with a stooping figure, running across a lawn bathed in moonlight.Luckily for the girls who had been at the party, there were other girls in dormitory ""C"" who had gone to bed at the usual respectable hour--Amanda Peabody and Eliza Dilks, for instance--and who, as usual, heard the rising bell. If it had not been for them and the noise they made Billie and the others of the five might have slept on till noon.It was Billie, who had slept less than any of them, who whispered a warning to them. She had seen Eliza and Amanda eyeing them suspiciously. It would never do, after having managed the party so successfully, to let the cat out of the bag after the affair was over.One by one they had run back to the dormitories between classes, made the remnants of the feast into small paper bundles, and had smuggled them down to the cellar and deposited them in the big box where all the papers and other rubbish was kept until the man of all work about Three Towers carted it off into the woods to be burnt up.Caroline had been thinking about Rose and the happening of the night before--thinking till her head ached--but she had not yet decided what to do about it. As for Rose--her head ached, too--she knew what she was going to do about it. Some way or other she was going to get even with Billie! And Caroline, too, big snooping, spectacled thing!""It isn't a bit private,"" said Billie, looking so serious that the girls suddenly became serious too. ""It was about something I saw last night after----"" she was about to say ""after the party,"" but as Amanda and her ""Shadow"" had come dangerously near and were listening with all their ears, she decided not to.The only thing the chums did not like about the boarding school was the Twin Dill Pickles. The latter were getting more and more miserly--insisting that the girls were getting too much to eat and that they should be allowed a great deal less liberty. In short, if the twin teachers had had their way Three Towers might have been a prison instead of a boarding school.The girls from North Bend had now become fully settled at the school. They had made a number of other friends, but so far their enemies seemed to be confined to Amanda Peabody and her constant companion, Eliza Dilks. Except Billie, that is, who added Miss Cora Dill and Rose Belser to her enemy list. Amanda was becoming known as the sneak of the school, but for this she did not seem to care.The boys from Boxton Military Academy had been over to see the girls several times. Rules were very strict at Three Towers Hall, and if the lads had not been related the boys could probably never have been admitted at all. But Chet and Teddy could come in, and once or twice they managed to smuggle poor Ferd along."
"Rose Belser had looked and smiled her prettiest--and that was a good deal--the first time she happened to meet the boys and girls together. But as the boys were too much interested in the fun they were going to have to take much notice of her, she had merely tossed her pretty black head and sauntered off in the opposite direction.The girls were quite willing that the boys should race, and away they went up the lake for half a mile or more. Teddy was carrying Billie, and, of course, he exerted himself to the utmost to win the race.They were still a hundred feet or more from the lake shore when they saw what had happened. In their eagerness to see the finish of the race Amanda Peabody and Eliza Dilks had ventured out on a soft bank, holding to some low bushes for that purpose. Bushes and bank had given way suddenly, and both girls had gone floundering into the water and mud up to their waists. Now they had been pulled to safety, and their chums, seeing that they were not hurt, set up a shout of laughter.Also the girls who were lucky enough to be elected to the ""Ghost Club,"" for that was what the society was called, must be popular among their fellow students. There was an unwritten law that membership in the club should not exceed fifteen.Rose Belser was president of the club, while Connie Danvers and several of the other girls with whom Billie and her chums were on the best of terms, were fellow members. Caroline Brant had been asked to join but had refused on the ground that the club took too much time from her studies. It was a compliment to Caroline that, in spite of her refusal, the girls--all except Rose Belser--liked her just the same.Billie and her chums had not been in Three Towers a week before they had heard of the secret club--no one but the members themselves even knew the name of it--and had realized how much all the girls longed to be members of it.And Billie, in a voice she tried hard to keep natural, said that they would not keep her waiting. And when she imparted the mysterious message to Laura and Vi they gaped at her, then pulled her down on a bench--it was noon and they had come out for a bit of sunshine and fresh air before the afternoon lessons--and showered her with questions.""The secret society!"" Vi repeated in an awed voice, while two girls who were passing paused and looked at them curiously. ""Oh, Laura, it couldn't be! Billie, do you think it is?"" She looked eagerly at Billie. Then her gaze traveled on to the two curious girls who were still lingering within earshot, and she sat up so straight that Billie and Laura looked at her in surprise. As usual the loiterers were Amanda and her ""Shadow"" and as they saw Vi's eyes upon them they smiled unpleasantly.""Hello,"" said Amanda coming over to the girls while the ""Shadow"" lingered behind. The latter was not quite as bold as Amanda--nor quite as mean. ""I heard you say something about the secret society. Are you invited?"" The last words were said with such a sneer and the grin on her face was so aggravating that the girls felt their blood begin to boil.""We've stood just about as much as we're going to from you, Amanda,"" she said, her eyes blazing. ""You've done nothing, you and Eliza, but spy upon us ever since we came to Three Towers, and I'll tell you right now we're tired of it."""
"""Oh, you are!"" said Amanda, her grin a little wider, while Laura and Vi, alarmed at what they saw was going to be a real quarrel at last, got up and stood beside Billie. Other girls who had come out on the campus gathered around them curiously. ""Well, what do you think you're going to do about it?""""I don't know yet,"" said Billie, trembling with fury--for usually good-natured, fun-loving Billie had a whirlwind of a temper when it was roused. ""But we'll make you stop your spying and mean tricks if we have to try your stunt and go to Miss Walters about it.""How could she explain to Miss Walters without telling about Amanda? That would be telling tales, and, in spite of her threat, that was the very last thing Billie wanted or intended to do. Beneath Miss Walters' steady gaze she hung her head.""Come, speak up, Beatrice,"" Miss Walters commanded, not unkindly, for, like almost every one in Three Towers Hall, she had come to love reckless, sweet-natured Billie, and even laughed at her pranks in secret. ""I've asked you a question, and my girls are in the habit of answering me.""""Was there a quarrel?"" questioned Miss Walters, her face still grave, for she disliked that kind of thing. ""If you can't tell me about it without telling tales,"" here the faintest of smiles flitted across her face, ""I want you at least to tell me that you are no longer angry and that a scene of this kind will never happen again. Here, Beatrice, shake hands with Amanda and be friends again.""Billie looked more startled at this than at anything that had happened so far. Shake hands with Amanda? Pretend they were friends again? Why, they never had been friends! Instinctively she put her hands behind her back. Then she looked up at Miss Walters appealingly.""Yes, that will do,"" answered Miss Walters, her eyes really smiling now. She was thinking that if she had had a daughter she would have liked her to be like Billie. ""Only remember, I have your word that it will never happen again. Come now, it is almost time for afternoon class,"" and she led the way back across the lawn.The girls followed in groups of two and three while Amanda and the ""Shadow"" brought up the rear. There was a smile on Amanda's face, and for the first time since she had come to Three Towers she was exultant. She had succeeded in making Billie furious, had seen her called to account--gently of course, altogether too gently, for ""Billie was Miss Walters' pet""--but called to account nevertheless and before a crowd of her classmates. That ought to hold her for a while!""You ought to have told Miss Walters about Amanda, Billie,"" Laura said over and over again. ""You shouldn't have let that little old sneak get away with it. Did you see her smile when Miss Walters turned away? Oh, if I could only give her what I want to give her!"" Laura's hands clasped and unclasped nervously as she talked and her eyes snapped."
"""Yes, that's just what she was waiting for,"" said Vi, hardly less furious than Laura. ""If you only hadn't answered her, Billie. Had just looked at her with your nose in the air and turned away. That makes her mad enough to murder you.""""Oh, I know it, I know it,"" said Billie, still ashamed to look any one in the face. She had broken one of the rules and had been reprimanded for it by Miss Walters in public. There was no getting over that. If it had been one of the ""Dill Pickles"" she would not have minded so much. But Miss Walters!""Never mind,"" Vi whispered in her ear. ""Miss Walters doesn't like Amanda any more than we do, and she just scolded you because she had to. And I know she liked the way you refused to tell tales. I saw it in the way she looked at you.""In the excitement of the scene with Amanda the girls had almost forgotten their mysterious engagement for ten o'clock that evening. But when they did think of it again it had the effect of making them forget everything else. It seemed an age while Billie and Laura and Vi stood under the maple tree before anything happened. It really was only about five minutes. Then a sound was heard through the darkness. It was the cracking of a twig.The girls started, and Billie, drawing some bushes aside, peered out in the direction of the sound. What she saw made her draw in her breath sharply and Laura and Vi drew closer, looking over her shoulder.It looked as though each figure had draped itself from head to foot in a flowing sheet with places for the eyes and nose and mouth rudely cut out. The girls, watching in half-frightened silence, were reminded of the ""Ku-Klux Klan"" of post Civil War days, which they had seen once or twice in moving pictures.""Of course. Who else could it be?"" said Billie, trying to make her voice sound natural when the skin on the back of her neck was beginning to crawl. ""For goodness sake, don't let them think you're scared, whatever you do,"" she whispered fiercely, as the first of the white-draped figures reached the woods. ""That's probably just what they're trying to do.""They afterward found out that this was the ""silence test,"" that unless the girls passed this first test they were unworthy to belong to the ""Ghost Club."" And passing the test consisted of doing what the girls were doing now--although they did not know it--just standing still and waiting for the head ""ghost"" to speak."
"For a minute it looked as if the meeting would be broken up, for who could be dignified and ghostly when addressed as ""ma'am""? There was a giggle from among the ghosts, and one or two of them began to double up as if with silent laughter. But once again the head ghost lifted its hand, or what looked more like a wing, under the sheet and her followers straightened up.This was a poser. The girls never had believed in ghosts, but how could they say so to this white-clad group. They had either to tell a fib or offend their visitors. Billie, acting as spokesman, chose the fib.In the silence that followed the girls could almost hear their hearts beat. This was the secret society to which every girl in Three Towers longed to belong, and they, Billie, Laura, Vi, were being asked to join. The last question of the head ghost could mean nothing else.""You understand,"" said the leader then, ""that one cannot change from a human to a ghost in a minute. There are different stages to be gone through. Spider!"" She lifted her hand again and one of the girls separated herself from the group and came forward. As she faced the leader she shivered as if with a chill, raised her hands in the air, and, still shivering horribly, lowered them to her sides again.They had heard of initiations before and what ridiculous things the girls and boys who were lucky or unlucky enough to be initiated had to go through with. But in every case they had heard of the clubs and fraternities had been human ones. The initiation into a ghost club was sure to be much worse.The leader of the ghost club raised her hand again, and three girls sprang forward from the group behind her. Before the girls knew what was happening to them they found their hands pinned behind them while huge sheets were flung over their heads.The girls that were doing all this to them tied something that felt like ropes around their waists, pulled the sheets into shape and the girls found to their great relief that there were eye and nose and mouth holes similar to those in the strange robes worn by the ghosts themselves.They were forced to swallow things that felt like particularly fat and squirmy worms. It was no wonder that the stomachs of the girls threatened to turn inside out. Several times they were on the point of revolt, but always they choked back protests and did as they were told. For to have come so near being members of the secret society of Three Towers and then to lose out at the last minute because they had not nerve enough to go through with the initiation, would have been real tragedy. So they gritted their teeth and went ahead.""Yes, but you haven't, and he probably has."" Laura was dancing with impatience, glancing now over her shoulder at the dark woods, now toward the house, standing out boldly in the moonlight. ""Billie, for goodness sake, don't be so crazy. We can't do anything!"""
"So Billie at last allowed herself to be dragged away. They found the ""ghosts"" talking excitedly about what had happened. And every once in a while a girl would glance nervously over her shoulder into the dark shadows of the woods. For days the girls could think of little else than the initiation into the ""Ghost Club"" and their startling meeting with the ""Codfish."" Whenever they could get together between classes or at noon or before they went to bed, these were the topics of conversation. And of these, the ""Codfish"" held first place.""But what in the world did he want?"" Laura asked wonderingly. ""You wouldn't think he'd come out from the woods at all--especially when there's such a bright moon. He might be sure some one would see him.""""Oh, I don't know,"" said Billie thoughtfully. ""He probably knows the rules of Three Towers and that the girls are all supposed to be in bed before ten o'clock, and I suppose he felt safe enough. We _should_ have been in bed, you know,"" she added, dimpling mischievously.The only one who was not particularly happy was Rose Belser. Of course she had not wanted the girls in the club at first. But the rest of the club did want them, and she was afraid that if she was the only one who voted against them it would make her unpopular with the rest.And all the time the ""Twin Dill Pickles"" were getting so obnoxious that more than once the girls were upon the point of revolt. From day to day it was only Miss Race, the mathematics teacher, who stood between them and open rebellion.For Miss Race was a staunch friend of the girls, and in her heart disliked Miss Ada and Miss Cora as much as they did. Whenever things got a little bit too bad, Miss Race would have a secret conversation with Miss Walters, who in her turn would have a little talk with the two Miss Dills. Then for the space of a day or two the girls would have comparative comfort.There was a good deal of snow the early part of that winter, and sledding parties became more and more frequent. There was a splendid hill for coasting near Three Towers, and here the girls gathered almost every afternoon after classes.Sometimes, very often in fact, there were boys, too, brothers and friends of the girls, boys who attended Boxton Military Academy. It was great sport, even more thrilling than rowing or canoeing had been, so that when Lake Molata froze over the girls were joyful at the prospect of more fun. There would be skating, and Billie Bradley and her two especial friends were splendid skaters.The rest of the girls giggled--all but Rose, who had taken a great liking to handsome Teddy and did not at all fancy the way he always singled out Billie, ""the little cat""--and Billie made a face at Teddy.""I'll think about it,"" she teased, then drew the boys and girls around her while she outlined the course of the race. ""Now,"" she said, ""we'll skate straight ahead till we come to where the lake takes that sudden bend. Then we'll double, and whoever passes the big maple tree first will win. Who's going in this race?"""
"It seemed that nearly everybody wanted to--everybody who could get a partner, that is--and in a minute or two a score of merry young figures were flying over the ice in a gallant effort to make the turn and get back to the old maple first.It was a pretty scene, at least Caroline Brant thought so. But Rose Belser, sitting close beside her, scraping her skates along the ice until she made two ugly little ridges in it, did not agree with her.There was Billie, taking the center of the stage again as usual, and there was Caroline looking after her with a smile. Well, Caroline could smile. She had never been the most popular girl at Three Towers, although most of the girls did like her, at that. Billie wasn't taking _her_ place. And she dug still more viciously at the ice.""I wish they would,"" said Rose savagely, then added with a mean little smile that suddenly reminded Caroline of Amanda Peabody: ""I suppose Billie would like to fall so that Teddy Jordon would have a chance to pick her up.""""Girls, the most awful thing has happened!"" she panted when she came within speaking distance. ""Miss Race was coming home from town a few minutes ago, and suddenly a man stepped out from the bushes near the road and held her up.""At that minute the skaters sped down upon them, Teddy and Billie winning triumphantly by about a yard. Caroline skated over to them, calling her story as she went. It was a minute or two before she could make them understand.Then Caroline told the story all over again, while Nellie shouted to them from the shore--for Nellie had on no skates and did not dare venture out on the ice without them. Before she had finished the boys were tearing wildly for the bank with the girls close behind them.""Don't talk--work,"" cried Teddy, getting rid of his skates and stamping his numbed feet to get the blood back into them. ""We missed that fellow once before, and we're not going to miss him again if we can help it. Ready, fellows?"" The boys stopped at the gate of Three Towers Hall, not knowing just what to do next. All they knew was that Miss Race had been held up and robbed only a few hundred feet from the gate and that the robber had disappeared in the bushes at the left-hand side of the road.""We'll have to spread out,"" Teddy said in an excited voice. ""Probably the fellow doesn't expect to be followed, because he thinks there are only women and girls around Three Towers and he's probably around near here somewhere counting over his loot.""It was right here,"" said Miss Race, her eyes black with excitement. ""And he ran across the road and disappeared in that thick mass of bushes. Then he covered me with his gun and told me to 'beat it while the beating was good.'""""You'd better go back now,"" he said, and Miss Race's eyes twinkled at his grown-up tone. ""There isn't anything more you can do, and if there are any bullets flying around we don't want you to get them. Please,"" he added impatiently, as she did not move."
"""No, I'm going to stay right here,"" she answered him firmly, and when Miss Race spoke in that tone everybody knew that she meant what she said. ""Go along, but don't take too many risks. Remember the man is armed.""As for the boys, they were beginning to despair of ever finding the thief and were calling themselves all sorts of names for ever thinking they would, when suddenly Chet walked out of the woods and almost upon him.With his heart in his mouth--for after all, with all his courage, he was only a boy and the robber was a man, and armed at that--Chet crept forward, fearful each second of stepping on a twig and giving his presence away.""Turn around,"" Chet commanded, then as the man did not move he clicked the trigger meaningly. ""Say, I think you want to taste the lead in this thing,"" he added, and there was something in his tone, boyish though it was, that made the man turn quickly.""Say, cut that out,"" snarled the ""Codfish,"" making as though to spring upon Chet, but the latter waved his pistol and the man evidently changed his mind, for he stood where he was, hands above his head, eyes glaring.""And so there's the pocketbook and the nice fat roll of money you just stole from the Three Towers teacher,"" Chet went on, his glance shifting from the man to the pocketbook with the money stuffed hastily in it where the man had left it on the ground. ""You thought it was easy, didn't you? Well, you didn't know you had me to reckon with."" Chet was boy enough to want to strut a little. Never before had he had a chance to play the real hero. He probably never would have again, so he wanted to make the most of this.Then Chet went mad. To have had the thief and then to lose him! He started off wildly into the woods, but his foot struck against something, and, looking down, he saw the pocketbook with the money still in it.By this time Chet knew he had no chance of catching the ""Codfish,"" who, now that he was discovered, was probably running into hiding as fast as he could, so he turned back with the boys and began excitedly to tell them what had happened.Miss Race greeted rapturously the return of her money. And as for the girls--well, they hung around Chet, showering him with questions and praise until it was really a wonder they did not spoil him entirely.But when the first excitement was over, the boys had gone home, and everything was quiet again, they could not help feeling sorry that Chet had not kept the Codfish when he had him. And Miss Walters, though she said nothing to the girls, was more worried than any of them.But as the days went by the girls found other things to worry about than the Codfish. They were having more and more trouble with Miss Ada and Miss Cora. Then one day there came news that brought the whole matter to a head.""We'll just be prisoners, that's all,"" said Billie, her eyes rebellious. ""I know Miss Cora's hated me from the very first, and now she'll be able to do just about what she pleases to me. But if she gets too funny, I'll--well, I don't know what I'll do,"" she ended rather helplessly.And during the next week the girls' worst fears were realized. All the liberty that they had enjoyed under Miss Walters was taken away from them, and, as Billie had predicted, they were practically prisoners."
"The two Miss Dills had always said that the girls could get along just as well on far less to eat. In fact, Miss Ada was positive they could study better if ""they didn't cram themselves so full of food."" And now they set to work to prove their theory.The afternoon seemed unbearably long, and for the life of them they could not keep their minds on their books. All they could think of was delicious juicy steaks, French-fried potatoes, chicken pie and strawberry short cake.And when girl after girl failed in her recitations, Miss Cora and Miss Ada scolded them so harshly and said such sarcastic things that it brought the angry red to their faces. But, as the girls said later, they were ""almost too hungry to fight back.""""We simply can't stand it,"" Billie went on, her little fists clenched angrily at her side. ""It's all right if they want to take our liberty away. We can stand that for a little while, until Miss Walters comes back. But when they begin to starve us----""""Well, I don't see that it makes any difference why Miss Walters did it,"" Billie broke in, and there was something in her tone that made the girls stop talking and look at her expectantly. ""The fact is, she has left the 'Dill Pickles' in charge and they're trying to starve us to death. Now what I want to know is this: Are we just going to stand around and let them do it? Or are we going to fight?""""Is to raid the pantry and storeroom,"" said Billie, her eyes gleaming. ""We'll probably find plenty of cooked things in the pantry, and if we don't, we'll go on into the storeroom and get canned sardines and vegetables and soup. I know I don't care what I eat, as long as I get enough of it.""The girls were silent a minute, staring at Billie half hopefully, half fearfully. To raid the pantry and storeroom? It had never been done in all the history of Three Towers. It would be open rebellion! And yet they were hungry--terribly hungry--two of them had been faint and sick from lack of food.""Please don't make so much noise,"" she begged. ""We'll be likely to make our raid a great deal easier if we wait until the cooks are gone and the teachers are in bed. We don't care if we are caught, but we don't want to be caught until after we've had something to eat.""The girls realized the common sense in this, but it was all they could do to be patient and wait. The thought of something to eat--all they wanted to eat--after a week of starvation made them ravenous, furiously impatient of delay.Hardly five minutes had passed before the doors of the different dormitories opened, and the girls crept singly or in twos and threes toward the farther end of the hall until all the hundred-odd girls of Three Towers were gathered there except two. Two of them had stayed behind, and so absorbed were the other girls that they never noticed the absence of Amanda Peabody and Eliza Dilks."
"For Amanda and Eliza disliked Billie so bitterly that they would even go hungry for the chance of getting even with her. Miss Ada and Miss Cora would be very glad to know who had been the ring-leader in the rebellion!The sudden glare rather frightened the girls, and they hesitated for a moment--but only a moment. They were terribly hungry, and just across the kitchen was the pantry, and back of that, the storeroom.Next they raided the storeroom. They found tiers upon tiers of canned goods, and Billie, because she was the first to find a can-opener, was pronounced ""official can-opener,"" and opened cans till her arm ached.But how good that stolen food tasted! They ate ravenously. They ate with knives and forks and spoons, and when these ran short, they even ate with their hands. And by and by the brightness came back to their eyes, the color to their cheeks, and they chattered like joyful magpies. The girls stood still, awaiting they did not know what, while Miss Ada and Miss Cora swept into the room followed by the other teachers, Amanda and the Shadow. The Misses Dill carried their noses high in the air, and there was a grim expression around their mouths. But as the girls glanced from them to Miss Race they saw that the latter looked troubled.""Three Towers,"" she said then, ""has never before been the scene of such a disgraceful happening. It is preposterous, unthinkable! I shudder to think of what will happen when Miss Walters hears the truth.""And of course,"" she added, her eyes still fixed upon Billie, ""you girls would never have thought of such a thing if you hadn't been put up to it. Fortunately, I have been able to learn the name of the--person,"" the word held so much of contempt that Billie's face burned, ""who started this disgraceful affair.""Billie had so many defenders that the noise they made completely drowned Miss Cora's voice and prevented her from speaking for several moments. This, of course, only served to make her angrier than before.""I didn't ask you all to talk,"" she said, when at last she could make herself heard. ""It seemed to me I was speaking to Beatrice Bradley. I will ask it once more,"" turning to Billie, who was rather white now. ""Were you or were you not the ring-leader of this affair?""""Then by your own confession,"" she said, something of triumph gleaming in her eyes, ""you have not only broken all the rules of Three Towers but you have incited the rest of the girls to do likewise. Have you anything to say for yourself?""""No,"" said Billie, lifting her head and looking Miss Cora straight in the eyes. ""We have been nearly starved since Miss Walters left, and some of the girls have been sick from hunger."" Her voice rose a little and the color came back to her face as she flung out a challenge like a flag of war. ""I'm sorry, Miss Dill, but if I had to, I would do it all over again."""
"""You have heard what she said,"" Miss Cora Dill turned to the teachers behind her. ""Such insolence can only result in expulsion. Beatrice Bradley, come with me. The rest of you,"" she turned fiercely upon the other girls, ""will go up to your dormitories. To-morrow I will deal with you.""In the dormitories all was confusion. Sleep was out of the question, and the girls gathered in excited groups discussing the terrible thing that had happened to them, half wishing for Miss Walters, yet half afraid to have her come back. Suppose she should side with the ""Dill Pickles""? Then all would indeed be lost.""But Billie doesn't fib,"" said Vi proudly. ""And besides, it wouldn't have done her any good. Amanda and the Shadow had already told, and they were right here in the dorm when we were planning the raid.""Billie had at last been singled out from all the other girls for punishment, would perhaps be expelled from Three Towers Hall, and where she, Rose, should have been happy about it, she was only miserable.Of course she had really had no hand in Billie's disgrace--this time. But she had planned and schemed for it before, and that made her almost as bad in her own eyes as those two wretched sneaks whom all the girls hated and despised. If they could only know what had been in her mind they would hate and despise her, too!Her head felt hot and her lips were feverish. It was a terrible thing to despise oneself. The only way she could ever put things straight again was to find some way of getting Billie out of her scrape. She must think of a plan!""I've thought of that,"" she said, then went on to explain while the girls listened eagerly how she had taken some letters to the mail box for Miss Race, and, happening to glance down, had seen that the top one was addressed to Miss Walters.But in her heart Billie did not believe that. The hope that when Miss Walters was told everything she would side with the girls was the only thing that kept her from being absolutely miserable. For Miss Walters was always fair.Billie had never been afraid of the dark. She was not really afraid of it now. But as the hours crept by and the place became still with the stillness of midnight, she began to feel uneasy and very, very lonesome.The silence was so deep that she was afraid to move for fear of breaking it, but at last, because her limbs were cramping and she was beginning to feel chilled, she rose from the couch where she had been sitting and began moving cautiously about the room.She stubbed her toe against one chair and almost fell over the other, making so much noise that her heart stood still and she looked fearfully over her shoulder. Finally she came over to the couch again and sank down upon it, feeling that she must cry or die."
"But she did not do either, just sat there thinking and thinking what she could do next. She would have to sleep, she supposed, although Miss Cora had not given her any nightgown and there were no bedclothes.Then a happy thought struck her, and she turned down the cover of the couch and found, as she had hoped, that the couch was made up as a bed. There were several rooms like this in Three Towers--rooms used only when there was an overflow of students. Billie remembered having heard the girls speak of them as ""cubby holes.""The girls rose reluctantly, and there was rebellion in their eyes. They were on the verge of revolt, and it needed only one more unfair act on the part of Miss Cora or Miss Ada Dill to start the ball rolling.""I suppose we'd better,"" answered Caroline Brant, her eyes looking tired and red-rimmed under the spectacles. ""We have to eat, anyway. After we get through we can come up here and decide what we're going to do.""""Well, I know one thing we're going to do,"" said Laura fiercely. ""If the Dill Pickles don't let Billie come back to us, or at least tell us where she is, I'm going to set the place on fire, that's all.""Breakfast was gloomier than ever that morning. The girls were heavy-eyed and sullen, and Miss Cora, presiding grimly at the head of the table, looked, as one of the older girls said, ""like a death's head at the feast.""""We simply can't stand it any longer, girls,"" she told them, her black eyes snapping. ""Wasn't that a wonderful breakfast we had this morning? It makes you sick to think of it. And we don't even know whether Billie got as much as we did. We've got to do something right away. We can try to get word to Miss Walters. I have her address, but I don't know how we're ever going to----""She was interrupted by a familiar whistle from somewhere outside, and the girls ran over to the window. Sure enough, there were Chet and Teddy, looking, to the girls, like a couple of heaven-sent messengers, standing underneath the window, skates flung over their shoulders, looking up toward them expectantly.""I had it all figured out last night, girls,"" she said, while they listened eagerly. ""When you told me you knew Miss Walters' address, Rose, I thought of the boys right away. There was just a chance that they might come over this morning or this afternoon. And now they're here.""She told the boys briefly what had happened and begged them to send word to Miss Walters at once. Then they tied the precious piece of paper around an inkwell--who cared for the wreck of a mere inkwell at a time like this?--and threw it out of the window.Teddy picked it up wonderingly and unwound the paper, while Chet peered over his shoulder and the girls watched breathlessly from above. When Teddy came to the part about Billie's capture he was all for storming the castle, meeting the ""Lions in their den, the Pickles in their hall,"" and rescuing the heroine without delay. But Chet held him back."
"After that they had what seemed to be a rather heated argument, but Chet finally got the best of it, and after a wave to the girls, who were fairly hanging out of the dormitory windows, the two boys started off and disappeared around the corner of the building.""Yes,"" said Billie, adding with a shiver: ""And I had a terrible night. But this morning Miss Cora herself brought me some breakfast--I wish you could have seen it--and she was just saying some nice mean things to me when Miss Race called her away for something, said it was important. Miss Cora went out without locking the door. So I didn't stop for anything, I just ran. I had something I wanted to tell you.""""But listen,"" Billie broke in hurriedly. ""I thought of something while I was locked up, and I want to tell you about it before they catch me again. It's about getting news to Miss Walters. The boys will probably be around this morning, and if you could let them know----""""Good!"" she cried. Then her face sobered again and she looked nervously toward the door. ""I suppose Miss Cora will be along in a minute, and she'll want to lock me up again. And I suppose she'll be so mad at my getting away that she won't give me anything to eat now."" The girls expected trouble and they had not long to wait for it. They had left Billie inside the dormitory, had gone into the hall, closed the door after them firmly and had defiantly placed themselves before it.They rather welcomed the sight of Miss Cora, stiff-backed and stern-lipped, bearing down upon them like a tug of war. They had learned in their history, that in ""union there is strength,"" and now they were about to test the truth of it. If one of them felt her courage slipping, all she had to do was to think of the breakfast they had had that morning and, presto, it was all back again.Miss Cora looked as stunned as if she had been hit on the head with a hammer. That one of the girls should have the insolence--the absolute impertinence--to ask her, Miss Cora Dill, where she was going!""Promise--not to lock----?"" gasped Miss Cora. Then she turned upon the girls with blazing eyes. ""You are mad--all of you!"" she said, her voice shaking with fury. ""I will wire Miss Walters at once!"" and she turned away down the hall, her hands so tightly clenched that her nails left little angry red marks where they had bit into the flesh.The girls watched her go--then turned back into the dormitory with a sigh. They had won a victory, and yet they were not happy about it. Except that Billie was free, things were even worse than before."
"The gong for classes rang out through the hall and the girls started and looked at each other questioningly. Several of them began to gather up their books, but Billie, who had been thinking deeply, suddenly sprang to her feet.""Listen, girls,"" she said, and they looked at her questioningly. ""It seems to me there's only one thing left for us to do. We can't go to classes, not after what we've just done, and we can't stay around here till Miss Walters comes. The Pickles will surely starve us to death.""They set about packing in feverish haste, fairly throwing their things into their suitcases. They were afraid of having their plans spoiled at the last minute. And in Molata they could get all they wanted to eat; that is, as long as their money held out.As they reached the lower hall they were met by Miss Ada Dill and Miss Cora, Miss Race and several of the other teachers. The latter had feared trouble when the girls failed to report at classes, and had started out to see what the matter was.And now they saw! Before they could even gasp their amazement the girls swept past them, opened the front door, and ran down the steps to the drive. There were only about a hundred of them, but it seemed to the teachers who watched them go that there were easily twice that number.For Billie, with a gasp of astonishment, had recognized the Codfish, and seeing what he was about to do had darted forward straight in his path. A score of the other girls followed her example, and so quickly was the move made that the man found his escape cut off entirely.Not for nothing had they won medals on the track team, and now, as the thief made his last attempt, his arms were caught in a strong grip and were twisted behind him so suddenly that he cried out with the pain of it.""The game's up, old man,"" he crowed exultantly. Then, turning, he handed the pistol to Billie. ""Keep him covered, old girl,"" he said, ""till I get this strap loose and handcuff the gentleman. That's the girl! Steady, Mr. Codfish--we've got you now.""The Codfish glared at her wildly, hesitated just a minute, but that hesitation cost him his chance. Chet had at last got his skate strap loose, and had bound it tightly about the man's wrists, while Teddy still held his arms tight to prevent a sudden dash into the woods.""Now I guess we've got you,"" cried Teddy jubilantly. ""You will rob our Academy, will you, and expect to get away with it? Now I guess the next thing is to hand you over to the first policeman we meet. Come on now, forward march.""""I'll say he did!"" said Chet indignantly. ""And he got away with a pretty haul, too. That's what we were going to tell you girls about this morning. But say----"" he broke off and looked at them with a funny expression on his face, ""we've been so busy catching the crook that we never thought! Say, where are you going with your suitcases and everything? And--and how did Billie get loose? The last we heard of her, she was locked up."""
"""We ought to meet the sheriff and his hick policemen pretty soon,"" said Chet, keeping his eyes and his pistol fixed unwaveringly on the captive's back, while Teddy gripped his arm with both hands and the girls crowded close behind. ""He pulled off this stunt last night, and Captain Shelling, the owner of our school, sent us to town to notify the police.""""Oh,"" said Billie thoughtfully. ""So that was where you were going this morning when you stopped at the Hall. What's that?"" she added as the sound of voices, somewhat muffled by the storm, reached them.""I hope it's the sheriff,"" said Teddy, hurrying his captive forward through the snow. ""Say, I'm glad we caught this fellow now before he had a chance to make off with what he stole. We may have a chance of getting it back.""The boys eagerly told the story of his capture, giving the girls more credit for their part of it than they deserved, or so the latter protested, and the sheriff and his party listened with delighted grins.""Pretty good work,"" said one of them approvingly. ""You couldn't have done any better if you'd planned it. Well, good day to you, and thanks. We'll soon put this rascal where he won't do more stealing of other people's goods. Get up there, will you?"" and he gave the sullen Codfish a push that sent him staggering up the road in front of them.""Well,"" said another, philosophically chewing a huge cud of tobacco, ""I call it lucky. If those girls hadn't happened along just when they did we wouldn't have got hold of this bird so slick. And who am I, to be quarreling with fate?"" ""Gee, that was some slick work!"" crowed Teddy Jordon exultantly. ""Who'd ever think we would catch the old Codfish. But say----"" he broke off, his face growing sober as he looked at the girls. ""You haven't told us yet just why you're taking this tramp in the snow. What's the idea--a health cure or something?""""No, it isn't a health cure,"" explained Billie, a trifle wearily, for now that the excitement of catching the Codfish was over the girls were beginning to feel cold and hungry and rather forlorn. ""We're just leaving Three Towers, that's all.""""Billie's some class, isn't she?"" Chet took him up eagerly. ""Just look how she jumped in front of the Codfish. She might have been shot, but she never even thought of it. Say,"" he added, his chest swelling visibly with pride, ""I've always thought I'd like a brother; but Billie's as good as a brother, any day."""
"Tired but hopeful, the girls trudged the remaining distance to town and started up the main street toward the one big hotel in Molata. They strung down the street in what seemed an endless line, and people passing stared wonderingly and turned around for another look when the girls had passed them.When they filed into the big summer hotel lobby, how the clerk at the desk and the few men gathered about did stare! A hundred girls, all pretty and daintily dressed, but seeming, by their suitcases and their clothes which were powdered thick with clinging wet snow, to have walked a good distance, were sure to create a sensation.""All right,"" the clerk answered, still unsmiling, while several people had gathered around and were looking on with interest. ""If you don't mind cots I guess I can fix you up all right. It's lucky that it's winter,"" he added, a little twinkle creeping into his nice eyes, ""and that the hotel isn't crowded, or we might have to turn somebody out.""Meanwhile the girls had decided that they were more hungry than they were tired, and so merely stopped to drop their bags in their rooms and brush a little of the clinging snow from their clothing before setting forth in search of food.They had decided to separate into groups and to eat in different places so as not to attract too much attention, and they were gathered on the sidewalk in front of the hotel wondering just what to do next when suddenly one of the girls gave a startled cry.And Miss Walters--for it was indeed she--attracted by the hubbub as were some other passersby, looked at the girls first curiously, then in astounded amazement. To her startled vision it seemed as if all the girls in the world were gathered there on the sidewalk in front of the hotel. And they were her girls--the girls of Three Towers Hall!""Now suppose one of you tell me the meaning of all this,"" said Miss Walters, her blue eyes a little hard and accusing. She had no idea what had happened, but she knew that if the girls were responsible for this unheard of proceeding it would go hard with them. Miss Walters was fair and just, and because she was just she could be sternness itself where any disobedience on the part of the girls was concerned.""Miss Walters,"" she began hesitatingly, as Miss Walters turned a steady gaze upon her, ""I can explain why we are here and everything that has happened since you left--if you will let me,"" she finished rather timidly.""You say that some of the girls were faint and sick from lack of food?"" she asked once incredulously. ""Why, it's--it's incredible. But go on,"" she interrupted herself impatiently. ""What happened then?""When Billie told of the raid, her imprisonment in the little room, her escape, and finally the decision of the girls to leave Three Towers and come to the hotel until Miss Walters' return, the latter jumped to her feet, her face flushing angrily.""I'm glad I came just when I did,"" she said. ""I was tempted to stay longer, but something told me that I might be needed, and that something was right. Come, girls, we'll hire all the taxis in town if we have to, and private automobiles, too, and get back to Three Towers immediately.""""Your rooms?"" Miss Walters asked, then added with a compassionate smile that made her seem more beautiful than ever to the adoring girls: ""Why, of course, you poor children! I forgot that you expected to stay over night. All right, run up and get your bags while I see the room clerk and about getting us back to Three Towers.""""Go up to your dormitories, girls,"" said Miss Walters, hardly glancing at the teachers. ""We will have lunch in half an hour--a real lunch. Just a minute,"" she called, as the girls started jubilantly off. ""I'd like to speak to Beatrice Bradley in my private office immediately."""
"""Sit down, please,"" she said, and when they were all seated she sat down at her desk and regarded them gravely. ""As you know,"" she said, ""an unheard-of thing happened this morning, and I must have the testimony of every one before I can decide one way or the other.""Then very quietly she told of her meeting with the girls that morning and repeated almost word for word the story of what had happened during her absence as told by Billie and supported by the other girls.""Pardon me, Miss Walters,"" Miss Race broke in, and they all turned to her, ""but I can testify that everything that Beatrice Bradley has told you is absolute fact. I don't think that Miss Cora will deny,"" she turned to Miss Cora, who was white with fury, ""that I have time and time again remonstrated with her and Miss Ada for their treatment of the girls.""""Yes, Miss Walters,"" said Miss Cora at last, ""it is true that Miss Race was continually interfering in our government of the girls during your absence. But,"" she added, while her mouth set in a grim line, ""I still maintain that we did nothing during your absence that you yourself would not have done.""""I'm sorry,"" she was saying, looking from Miss Ada to Miss Cora and back again, ""but I can't agree with you. Surely while I have had charge of Three Towers the girls have not gone hungry or become faint and sick from lack of nourishment. Neither have they raided pantries and storerooms and deserted Three Towers _en masse_, Miss Cora."" She paused, and one could have heard a pin drop in the room. ""I am very sorry, but I think that after Monday Three Towers will have no further need of your services, nor of those of Miss Ada. That is all, I think.""She rose by way of dismissal, and the other teachers rose also. Billie, who was nearest the door, slipped out quietly and ran swiftly up the stairs toward her dormitory. Her head was in a whirl, and all she wanted to do was to get with the girls again and tell them the marvelous thing that had happened.The other girls were waiting for her, and as she burst in upon them they carried her off, seated her royally on top of a dresser, and gathered around eagerly, all talking at once and demanding to know what had happened.And it was a real lunch, as Miss Walters had promised--a lunch that disappeared as if by magic, and when it was over the students of Three Towers were really comfortable for the first time in over a week.And everybody was happy, except Miss Ada Dill and Miss Cora; and Amanda Peabody and Eliza Dilks, perhaps. However, even though her attempt had failed this time, Amanda was by no means discouraged. There would be other chances--and then she would get even with Billie Bradley!Rose Belser was happier than she had been since she had first become jealous of Billie. She was happy because she had done her best to set Billie right again, and could look at her pretty reflection in the glass once more without feeling ashamed.It was some time later, and Billie, Vi and Laura were stretched out in comfortable attitudes on Billie's bed in dormitory ""C""--for Miss Walters had declared it a half holiday. And, indeed, after lunch was over there was scarcely any of the day left, anyway.""Girls,"" she cried, plumping herself down between Laura and Vi on the bed, narrowly missing the latter's feet, ""I've just got a letter--there are some for you girls down in the box, too--and what do you think the folks are going to do this summer?""""Mother and Dad are going to open our cottage at Lighthouse Island again--we haven't been there for several summers. My old Uncle Tom runs the lighthouse there, and he's a perfect darling. But this is the real thing,"" she paused and regarded them with sparkling eyes. ""Mother says there will be plenty of room in the cottage for two or three of my school chums if I'd like to have them. Think of that--if I'd like to have them!"""
