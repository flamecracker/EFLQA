passage
"LUCIE scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a very small person.THE path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where Lucie had yellow curls--that little person had PRICKLES!""Who are you?"" said Lucie. ""Have you seen my pocket-handkins?"" The little person made a bob-curtsey--""Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear-starcher!"" And she took something out of a clothes- basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.""What's that thing?"" said Lucie--""that's not by pocket-handkin?"" ""Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!"" And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.Then she took something else off a clothes-horse-- ""That isn't my pinny?"" said Lucie. ""Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash!"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.""WHY, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?"" ""Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it did so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the smell.""""AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch?"" ""They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Tits-mouse --most terrible particular!"" said Mrs. Tiddy-winkle. ""Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes."""
