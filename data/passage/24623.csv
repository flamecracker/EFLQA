passage
"Children, as well as their interested parents, will eagerly welcome this beautiful edition of the one great nursery classic, just as a worthy edition of Shakespeare is welcomed by discriminating adult readers.But some may ask what there is in these simple melodies, attributed to Mother Goose, which gives them so secure and beloved a place in the home, the school and the public library. Is it the humor, the action, the rhythm, or the mystery of the theme which appeals so strongly to critical little minds in each generation of childhood, and even to adult minds so fortunate as to have retained some of the refreshing naiveté of early years?It is useless to try to explain the charm of these nonsense melodies. The children themselves do not know why they love them. No mother can tell us the magic of the spell which seems to be cast over her restless baby as she croons to it a Mother Goose lullaby. No primary teacher quite understands why the mere repetition or singing of a Mother Goose jingle will transform her listless, inattentive class into one all eagerness and attention. But mother and teacher agree that the best of these verses have an even more potent influence than that of innocently diverting and entertaining the child. The healthy moral, so subtly suggested in many of the rhymes, is unconsciously absorbed by the child's receptive mind, helping him to make his own distinction between right and wrong, bravery and cowardice, generosity and selfishness.From a literary standpoint, also, these rhymes have proved of real value in creating a taste for the truly musical in poetry and song. They train the ear and stir the imagination of the child as no other verses do. Many famous poets and writers trace their first inspiration, and love for things literary, back to the nursery songs and fairy tales of their childhood.Teachers well know that children who have reveled in these rhymes and stories, at the time of their strongest appeal, step naturally and appreciatively into the great fields of good literature which are beyond.Knowing these things to be true, we do not hesitate to place this venerable classic on the shelf beside our Shakespeare, and to send our children there for delight and inspiration. They will understand Shakespeare the better for having known and loved Mother Goose.But what about the personality of this classic writer? Was she really Mistress Elizabeth Goose who is said to have lived in Boston about two hundred years ago, and who crooned her nonsense jingles to a large and happy family of grandchildren? We are told that their father, Thomas Fleet, who was a printer by trade, thought to turn an honest penny with his mother-in-law's popular verses, so he published them in a small volume under the title of ""Songs for the Nursery: or, Mother Goose's Melodies."" A goose with a very long neck and a wide-open mouth flew across the title page, at least so the story goes. But we have to believe that it is only a story, for no copy of the book can be found, and nothing but tradition identifies Elizabeth Goose, the Boston grandmother, with the famous rhymester.We might feel sorry to be obliged to discredit this picturesque story of Mother Goose, if her real history were not even more mysterious. We know very little about the beloved patron of childhood, but what we do know is as follows:Mother Goose is most certainly of respectable French origin, for in 1697 a distinguished French writer, Charles Perrault, published in Paris a little book of familiar stories called ""Contes de ma Mère l'Oye,"" or ""Tales of My Mother Goose."" Her identity, however, he leaves a mystery, except that in the frontispiece of his book is pictured an old woman by her fireside telling stories to an eager little family group.This volume contained the only prose tales that have ever been credited to Mother Goose, and they are still among the most popular stories in nursery or school room. The titles are as follows: ""Little Red Riding Hood;"" ""The Sisters Who Dropped From Their Mouths Diamonds and Toads;"" ""Bluebeard;"" ""The Sleeping Beauty;"" ""Puss in Boots;"" ""Cinderella;"" ""Riquet With the Tuft;"" and ""Tom Thumb.""It is through her verses, however, that Mother Goose has won her well-deserved fame. The first collection under her name was published in London about 1765 by John Newbery. It may be, if Oliver Goldsmith were living, he could tell us more about the origin of these verses than we are now ever likely to know. It is more than probable that he himself edited the little volume for John Newbery, and that he wrote the clever preface, ""By a very Great Writer of very Little Books,"" as well as the quaint moral which supplements each rhyme."
"About twenty-five years later this book was reprinted in our country by Isaiah Thomas of Worcester, Massachusetts. Several copies of this edition are preserved, one of which has been photographed and reproduced in facsimile by W. H. Whitmore of Boston. Other publishers also reprinted the English edition, one being done for John Newbery's grandson, Francis Power, in 1791.In 1810 another collection of melodies appeared under the title of ""Gammer Gurton's Garland."" It was quite evidently a rival of Mother Goose, though it contained nearly all of her verses, besides many far less interesting ones gathered from other sources.Gammer Gurton's popularity, however, was short, and Mother Goose was revived about 1825 by a Boston firm, Munroe and Francis. Since that time her fame has never waned. In spite of the present multiplicity of beautiful books for children, they are constantly exhausting large editions of the one universally beloved book of melodies. Some of these volumes have been collected and edited by men of the highest literary judgment and ability, such as Goldsmith (with hardly a doubt), Ritson, Halliwell, Andrew Lang, Charles Eliot Norton, Charles Welsh and Edward Everett Hale. Certainly there is not another collection of juvenile literature which can boast such a list of scholarly editors. The deepest gratitude is due them for their careful and discriminating effort to preserve for the children of future generations this rich heritage of nursery melodies.Many less discriminating editors, however, have ruthlessly mutilated and adapted many of the rhymes to suit their fancy, thinking, possibly, that as Mother Goose is only a title, the verses attributed to her belong to the general public to use as it sees fit. On the contrary, Mother Goose's melodies belong to the children, and no addition or change should be made except by those who are in such close sympathy with the child-heart that they may act with the child's authority.This present edition of ""Mother Goose"" preserves the best of the verses which became so popular in England and America as to first demand their publication. It is the only truly classic edition that has been published in modern times. The two authorities which have been followed are the edition published for John Newbery's grandson in London in 1791, and probably edited by Oliver Goldsmith, and the edition published in Boston in 1833 by Munroe and Francis, called ""The Only True Mother Goose Melodies."" It is from this copy that the following quaint introduction by ""Ma'am Goose"" is quoted.Not all the favorites among the nursery rhymes are here, only those that first helped to make the fame of the fictitious but no less worthy patron of childhood. May her fame and her melodies be lovingly preserved to give joy and inspiration to many future generations of little children. My dear little Blossoms, there are now in this world, and always will be, a great many grannies beside myself, both in petticoats and pantaloons, some a deal younger, to be sure, but all monstrous wise and of my own family name. These old women, who never had chick or child of their own, but who always know how to bring up other people's children, will tell you with long faces that my enchanting, quieting, soothing volume, my all-sufficient anodyne for cross, peevish, won't-be-comforted little bairns, ought be laid aside for more learned books, such as _they_ could select and publish. Fudge! I tell you that all their batterings can't deface my beauties, nor their wise pratings equal my wiser prattlings; and all imitators of my refreshing songs might as well write another Billy Shakespeare as another Mother Goose--we two great poets were born together, and shall go out of the world together. One misty, moisty morning, When cloudy was the weather, I chanced to meet an old man clothed all in leather. He began to compliment, and I began to grin, How do you do, and how do you do? And how do you do again? I like little pussy, her coat is so warm, And if I don't hurt her she'll do me no harm; So I'll not pull her tail, nor drive her away, But pussy and I very gently will play. Pretty John Watts, We are troubled with rats, Will you drive them out of the house? We have mice, too, in plenty, That feast in the pantry, But let them stay And nibble away, What harm in a little brown mouse? Ride away, ride away, Johnny shall ride, And he shall have pussy-cat Tied to one side; And he shall have little dog Tied to the other, And Johnny shall ride To see his grandmother."
"Bah, bah, black sheep, Have you any wool? Yes, marry, have I, Three bags full; One for my master, One for my dame, But none for the little boy Who cries in the lane. Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town, Upstairs and downstairs, in his nightgown; Tapping at the window, crying at the lock: ""Are the babes in their beds, for it's now ten o'clock?"" There was an old woman who lived in a shoe, She had so many children she didn't know what to do. She gave them some broth without any bread, She whipped them all soundly and put them to bed. There was a man and he had naught, And robbers came to rob him; He crept up to the chimney top, And then they thought they had him. But he got down on the other side, And then they could not find him; He ran fourteen miles in fifteen days, And never looked behind him. Pussy-Cat sits by the fire; How can she be fair? In walks the little dog; Says: ""Pussy, are you there? How do you do, Mistress Pussy? Mistress Pussy, how d'ye do?"" ""I thank you kindly, little dog, I fare as well as you!"" There was an old woman lived under the hill, And if she's not gone she lives there still. Baked apples she sold, and cranberry pies, And she's the old woman that never told lies. Sing a song of sixpence, a bag full of rye, Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie; When the pie was opened the birds began to sing, And wasn't this a dainty dish to set before the king? The king was in the parlor counting out his money; The queen was in the kitchen eating bread and honey; The maid was in the garden hanging out the clothes, There came a little blackbird and nipped off her nose. Little Miss Muffet Sat on a tuffet, Eating some curds and whey; There came a great spider, And sat down beside her, And frightened Miss Muffet away. There were two birds sat upon a stone, Fal de ral-al de ral-laddy. One flew away and then there was one, Fal de ral-al de ral-laddy. The other flew after and then there was none, Fal de ral-al de ral-laddy. So the poor stone was left all alone, Fal de ral-al de ral-laddy. One of these little birds back again flew, Fal de ral-al de ral-laddy. The other came after and then there were two, Fal de ral-al de ral-laddy. Says one to the other: ""Pray, how do you do?"" Fal de ral-al de ral-laddy. ""Very well, thank you, and pray how are you?"" Fal de ral-al de ral-laddy. Bye, Baby bunting, Father's gone a-hunting, Mother's gone a-milking, Sister's gone a-silking, And Brother's gone to buy a skin To wrap the Baby bunting in. Little Polly Flinders Sat among the cinders Warming her pretty little toes; Her mother came and caught her, Whipped her little daughter For spoiling her nice new clothes. Four-and-twenty tailors Went to kill a snail; The best man among them Durst not touch her tail; She put out her horns Like a little Kyloe cow. Run, tailors, run, or She'll kill you all just now."
"Little Tom Tucker Sings for his supper. What shall he eat? White bread and butter. How will he cut it Without e'er a knife? How will he marry Without e'er a wife? High diddle diddle, The cat and the fiddle, The cow jumped over the moon; The little dog laughed To see such craft, And the dish ran away with the spoon. Robin and Richard Were two pretty men; They stayed in bed Till the clock struck ten. Then up starts Robin And looks at the sky: ""Oh, brother Richard, The sun's very high. You go before With the bottle and bag, And I will come after On little Jack nag."" I had a little hen, the prettiest ever seen, She washed me the dishes and kept the house clean. She went to the mill to fetch me some flour, And always got home in less than an hour. She baked me my bread, she brewed me my ale, She sat by the fire and told many a fine tale. When I was a little boy I lived by myself, And all the bread and cheese I got I put upon a shelf; The rats and the mice, they made such a strife, I was forced to go to London to buy me a wife. The streets were so broad and the lanes were so narrow, I was forced to bring my wife home in a wheelbarrow; The wheelbarrow broke and my wife had a fall, And down came the wheelbarrow, wife and all. 'Twas once upon a time, when Jenny Wren was young, So daintily she danced and so prettily she sung, Robin Redbreast lost his heart, for he was a gallant bird, So he doffed his hat to Jenny Wren, requesting to be heard. ""O, dearest Jenny Wren, if you will but be mine, You shall feed on cherry pie and drink new currant wine, I'll dress you like a goldfinch or any peacock gay, So, dearest Jen, if you'll be mine let us appoint the day."" Jenny blushed behind her fan and thus declared her mind: ""Since, dearest Bob, I love you well, I take your offer kind; Cherry pie is very nice and so is currant wine, But I must wear my plain brown gown and never go too fine."" Little King Boggen he built a fine hall, Pie-crust and pastry-crust, that was the wall; The windows were made of black puddings and white, And slated with pancakes,--you ne'er saw the like! Miss Jane had a bag and a mouse was in it; She opened the bag, he was out in a minute. The cat saw him jump and run under the table, And the dog said: ""Catch him, Puss, soon as you're able."" Goosey, goosey, gander, where dost thou wander? Upstairs and downstairs and in my lady's chamber; There I met an old man that wouldn't say his prayers, I took him by his hind legs and threw him downstairs. The lion and the unicorn Were fighting for the crown. The lion beat the unicorn All about the town. Some gave them white bread, And some gave them brown; Some gave them plum-cake, And sent them out of town. Old King Cole Was a merry old soul, And a merry old soul was he; He called for his pipe, And he called for his bowl, And he called for his fiddlers three. Bonny lass, pretty lass, Wilt thou be mine? Thou shalt not wash dishes Nor yet serve the swine. Thou shalt sit on a cushion And sew a fine seam, And thou shalt eat strawberries, Sugar and cream. Ding--dong--bell, the cat's in the well. Who put her in? Little Johnny Green. Who pulled her out? Great Johnny Stout. What a naughty boy was that To drown poor pussy cat Who never did him any harm, And killed the mice in his father's barn."
"This pig went to market, That pig stayed at home; This pig had roast meat, That pig had none; This pig went to the barn door, And cried ""week, week,"" for more. Polly, put the kettle on, Polly, put the kettle on, Polly, put the kettle on, We'll all have tea. Sukey, take it off again, Sukey, take it off again, Sukey, take it off again, They're all gone away. The sow came in with the saddle, The little pig rocked the cradle, The dish jumped up on the table To see the pot swallow the ladle. The spit that stood behind the door Threw the pudding-stick on the floor. ""Odsplut!"" said the gridiron, ""Can't you agree? I'm the head constable, Bring them to me!"" Little Robin Redbreast sat upon a tree, Up went the Pussy-Cat, and down went he, Down came Pussy-Cat, away Robin ran; Says little Robin Redbreast: ""Catch me if you can!"" Little Robin Redbreast jumped upon a spade, Pussy-Cat jumped after him, and then he was afraid. Little Robin chirped and sang, and what did Pussy say? Pussy-Cat said: ""Mew, mew, mew,"" and Robin flew away. There was an old woman Sold puddings and pies; She went to the mill, And dust flew in her eyes. While through the streets, To all she meets She ever cries: ""Hot Pies--Hot Pies."" ""Old woman, old woman, shall we go a-shearing?"" ""Speak a little louder, sir, I'm very thick o' hearing."" ""Old woman, old woman, shall I kiss you dearly?"" ""Thank you, kind sir, I hear very clearly."" There was an old woman, and what do you think? She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink; Victuals and drink were the chief of her diet, And yet this old woman could never be quiet. There was a crooked man, And he went a crooked mile, He found a crooked sixpence Against a crooked stile; He bought a crooked cat Which caught a crooked mouse, And they all lived together In a little crooked house. The man in the wilderness Asked me How many strawberries Grew in the sea. I answered him As I thought good, As many red herrings As grew in the wood. As I was going to St. Ives I met seven wives. Every wife had seven sacks, Every sack had seven cats, Every cat had seven kits. Kits, cats, sacks and wives, How many were going to St. Ives? I had a little husband no bigger than my thumb, I put him in a pint pot, and there I bid him drum; I bought a little handkerchief to wipe his little nose, And a pair of little garters to tie his little hose. When good King Arthur ruled his land He was a goodly king; He stole three pecks of barley meal To make a bag-pudding. A bag-pudding the king did make, And stuffed it well with plums, And in it put great lumps of fat As big as my two thumbs. The king and queen did eat thereof, And noblemen beside, And what they could not eat that night The queen next morning fried."
