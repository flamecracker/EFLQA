passage
"When the friends of the Pepper family found that the author was firm in her decision to continue their history no further, they brought their appeals for the details of some of those good times that made the ""little brown house"" an object-lesson.In these appeals, the parents were as vigorous as the young people for a volume of the stories that Polly told, to keep the children happy in those hard days when her story-telling had to be a large factor in their home-life; and also for a book of their plays and exploits, impossible to be embodied in the continued series of their history, so that all who loved the ""Five Little Peppers"" might the better study the influences that shaped their lives.And now the pressure is brought to bear for a book showing the Little Peppers over the ocean, recorded in ""Five Little Peppers Midway."" And the author is very glad to comply again; for foreign travel throws a wholly different side-light upon the Pepper family. So here is the book.It is in no sense to be taken as a story written for a guide-book,--although the author lives in it again her repeated enjoyment of the sights and scenes which are accurately depicted. A ""Baedeker,"" if carefully studied, is really all that is needed as a constant companion to the traveller; while for supplementary helps and suggestions, there are many valuable books along the same line. This volume is given up to the Peppers; and they must live their own lives and tell their own story while abroad just as they choose.As the author has stated many times, her part is ""simply to set down what the Peppers did and said, without trying to make them say or do anything in particular."" And so over the ocean they are just as much the makers of their own history as when they first opened the door of the ""little brown house"" to""No, we can't,"" said Polly, with a dreadful longing at her heart for the charms of a game; ""that is, until we've found Phronsie."" And she ran down the deck. ""Perhaps she is in one of the library corners, though I thought I looked over them all.""""Because""--Polly stopped at the top and looked over her shoulder at him--""Matilda's in her berth. She's awfully seasick. I was to stay with Phronsie, and now I've lost her!"" And the brown head drooped, and Polly clasped her hands tightly together.""Well, anyway, we can't find her, Jasper,"" said Polly, running on. ""And it's all my fault, for I forgot, and left her in the library, and went with Fanny Vanderburgh down to her state-room. O dear me!"" as she sped on.""Well, she's in the library now, most likely,"" said Jasper, cheerfully, hurrying after, ""curled up asleep in a corner."" And they both ran in, expecting to see Phronsie's yellow head snuggled into one of the pillows.But there was no one there except a little old gentleman on one of the sofas back of a table, who held his paper upside down, his big spectacles on the end of his nose, almost tumbling off as he nodded drowsily with the motion of the steamer.""No danger,"" said Jasper, with a glance over at the old gentleman; ""he's just as fast asleep as can be. Here, Polly, I think she's probably tucked up in here."" And he hurried over to the farther side, where the sofa made a generous angle.Just then in stalked a tall boy, who rushed up to the little old gentleman. ""Here, Granddad, wake up."" And he shook his arm smartly. ""You're losing your glasses, and then there'll be a beastly row to pay."""
"""Ha! Ha! tell that to the marines,"" cried Tom, loudly, dancing in derision, ""You've been sleeping like a log. You'd much better go down and get into your state-room. But give me a sovereign first."" He held out his hand as he spoke. ""Hurry up, Granddad!"" he added impatiently.Polly had not taken her eyes off their faces. Now she turned toward Jasper. ""Oh, how very dreadful!"" she gasped--then would have given everything if she had kept still, for the old gentleman whirled around and saw them for the first time.""Sister? I don't know anything about your sister,"" said the old gentleman, irascibly. ""And this room isn't a place for children, I can tell you,"" he added, as if he owned the library and the whole ship.""What I say to my grandson, Tom, and what he says to me, is our own business!"" exclaimed the old gentleman in a passion, thumping the table with his clenched hand. ""And no one else has a right to hear it.""""You would much better,"" said the old man, nodding angrily. ""And you, boy, too; I suppose you think yourself better than my Tom. But you are not--not a bit of it!"" And suddenly he tried to start to his feet, but lurched heavily against the table instead.The old gentleman essayed to wave them off. ""Let me alone,"" he said feebly; ""I'm going after my grandson, Tom."" His voice sank to a whisper, and his head dropped to his breast. ""He's got money--he's always getting it, and I'm going to see what he's doing with it.""It was just the time when everybody seemed to be in the state-rooms, or out on deck in steamer chairs, so Polly sat there at the old man's head, feeling as if every minute were an hour, and he kept gurgling, ""Tom's a bad boy--he gets money all the time, and I'm going to see what he's doing with it,"" with feeble waves of his legs, that put Polly in a fright lest he should roll off the sofa at every lurch of the steamer.""But I don't want Tom to come,"" cried the old gentleman, irritably. ""Who said I wanted him to come? Hey?"" He turned up his head and looked at her, and Polly's hand shook worse than ever when the little snapping eyes were full on her face, and she had all she could do to keep from running out of the room and up on deck where she could breathe freely."
"""I am so sorry,"" she managed to gasp, feeling if she didn't say something, she should surely run. ""Does your head feel better?"" And she smoothed his hot forehead gently just as Phronsie always did Grandpapa's when it ached. And when she thought of Phronsie, then it was all she could do to keep the tears back. Where could she be? And would Jasper never come back?And just then in ran Tom with a great clatter, complaining noisily every step of the way. ""I told you you'd much better get off to your stateroom, Granddad!"" he exclaimed. ""Here, I'll help you down there."" And he laid a hasty hand on the feeble old arm.""And I say no matter,"" retorted Tom, roughly. ""And you ought to come down to your state-room where you belong. Come, Granddad!"" And he tried again to lay hold of his arm. But the little old gentleman sank back, and looked up at Polly again. ""I think I'll stay here,"" he said.""I say,"" began the boy, in an embarrassed way, ""this is dreadfully rough on you,"" and then he looked away from Polly to Jasper. ""And if you knew him as well as I do,"" nodding his head at his Grandfather, ""you wouldn't get in such a funk.""Tom burst into a short laugh and kicked his heel against the table. ""Hoh! hoh! I say, you don't know him; oh, what muffs you are! He's well enough, only he's determined not to go to his state-room where he belongs, but to kick up a row here.""""Very well,"" said Jasper, coolly, ""since you are determined to do nothing for his relief, I shall take it upon myself to summon the doctor."" He stepped to a table a bit further off, and touched the electric button back of it.""It isn't books we want,"" said Jasper, quickly, ""but this old gentleman""--whose head was now heavily sunken on his breast, and whose cheek was quite white--""appears to be very ill, and to need the doctor.""""Well--well--well!"" exclaimed Mr. King, coming in, ""to be sure, it's very stupid in me not to think of looking in the library for both of you before. O dear me--bless me!"" And he came to a dead stop of astonishment."
"""And none too soon, I should say,"" remarked Mr. King, grimly, with a keen glance into the old man's face. ""Raise his feet a little higher, Jasper; put a pillow under them; there, that's it. Well, the doctor should be hurried up."" He glanced quickly around. ""Here, you boy,"" seeing Tom, ""run as you never have run before, and tell the doctor to come quickly.""And then when nobody wanted them, the library seemed to be full of people, and the news spreading out to the decks, many of the passengers got out of their steamer chairs, and tried to swarm into the two doorways.Tom, who never knew how he summoned Dr. Jones, being chiefly occupied in astonishment at finding that he obeyed a command from a perfect stranger, did not come back to the library, but kept himself with the same amazed expression on his face, idly kicking his heels in a quiet corner of the deck near by. He never thought of such a thing as being worried over his Grandfather, for he couldn't remember when the old gentleman hadn't been subject to nervous attacks; but somehow since ""a row,"" as he expressed it, ""had been kicked up,"" it was just as well to stay in the vicinity and see the end of it. But he wasn't going inside--no, not he!After awhile, Tom was just beginning to yawn, and to feel that no one could expect him to waste time like that, and probably his Grandfather was going to sleep it out on the sofa, and the stupid doctor would find that there was nothing the matter, only the old man was nervous. ""And I'm going back to the fellows,"" decided Tom, shaking his long legs.""You must excuse me for wasting no ceremony,"" said Jasper, sternly. It struck Tom that he looked very much like the old gentleman who had told him to _go!_ ""Your Grandfather is very ill; something is the matter with his heart, and the doctor has sent me for you. He says he may not live an hour."" It was necessary to tell the whole of the dreadful truth, for Tom was still staring at him in defiance.""Can't help it,"" said Dr. Jones, curtly; ""he's my patient. So I tell you again it is imperative that you leave this room."" Then he turned back to his work of making the sick man comfortable without taking any more notice of the boy.Tom gave a good long look at as much of his Grandfather's face as he could see, then slunk out, in a dazed condition, trying to make himself as small as possible. Jasper found him a half hour afterward, hanging over the rail away from curious eyes, his head buried on his arms.""And the doctor has gotten him into his state-room, and he is as comfortable as he could be made."" Jasper didn't add that Dr. Jones had asked him to come back, and that the old man was still insisting that Polly should hold his hand.""In that case,"" declared Tom, suddenly twitching up his head, ""I will go down there."" His face was so drawn that Jasper started, and then looked away over the sea, and did not appear to notice the clenched hand down by the boy's side.""I--I--didn't know he was sick."" Tom brought it out in gusts, and his face worked worse than ever in his efforts not to show his distress. The only thing he could do was to double up his hand tighter than ever, as he tried to keep it back of him.""And now I'll go down,"" said Tom, drawing a long breath and starting off. Oh! and Dr. Jones had said the last thing to Jasper as he rushed off with the good news to Tom, ""On no account let that boy see his Grandfather. I won't answer for the consequences if you do."""
"""Tom!"" Jasper took long steps after him. ""Beg your pardon, this is no time for thinking of anything but your Grandfather's life. Dr. Jones said you were not to see him at present."" The truth must be told, for in another moment the boy would have been off on the wings of the wind.""I believe I had that pleasure,"" said the last named, ""as I am not deaf. Come on, fellows; our little boy has got to wait on his Grandpappy. Good-by, kid!"" He snapped his fingers; the other two laughed derisively, and sauntered off down the deck as they came.Meantime the old gentleman, in his large handsome state-room, showed no sign of returning to the consciousness that had come back for a brief moment. And he held to Polly's hand so tightly, as she sat at the head of the berth, that there was no chance of withdrawing her fingers had she so desired. And Father Fisher with whom Dr. Jones had of course made acquaintance, before the steamer fairly sailed, sat there keeping watch too, in a professional way, the ship's doctor having called him in consultation over the case. And Phronsie, who had been in deep penitence because she had wandered off from the library with another little girl, to gaze over the railing upon the steerage children below, thereby missing Polly, was in such woe over it all that she was allowed to cuddle up against Polly's side and hold her other hand. And there she sat as still as a mouse, hardly daring to breathe. And Mr. King, feeling as if, after all, the case was pretty much under his supervision, came softly in at intervals to see that all was well, and that the dreadful boy was kept out.And the passengers all drifted back to their steamer chairs, glad of some new topic to discuss, for the gossip they had brought on board was threadbare now, as they were two days at sea. And the steamer sailed over the blue water that softly lapped the stout vessel's side, careless of the battle that had been waged for a life, even then holding by slender threads. And Fanny Vanderburgh, whose grandfather was a contemporary in the old business days in New York with Mr. King, and who sat with her mother at the next table to the King party, spent most of her time running to Mrs. Pepper's state-room, or interviewing any one who would be able to give her the slightest encouragement as to when she could claim Polly Pepper.""O dear me!"" Fanny cried, on one such occasion, when she happened to run across Jasper. ""I've been down to No. 45 four times this morning, and there's nobody there but that stupid Matilda, and she doesn't know or won't tell when Polly will get through reading to that tiresome old man. And they won't let me go to his state-room. Mrs. Fisher and your father are there, too, or I'd get them to make Polly come out on deck. We all want her for a game of shuffle-board.""Jasper sighed. So did he long for a game of shuffle-board. Then he brought himself up, and said as brightly as he could: ""Mr. Selwyn begs Polly to stay, and won't have any one else read to him, Miss Vanderburgh, so I don't see as it can be helped. He's been very sick, you know.""Jasper turned uneasily. ""Please, Mr. King, do make Polly listen to reason,"" begged Fanny. ""There isn't another girl on board I care to go with--at least not in the way I would with her. The Griswolds are well enough to play games with, and all that; but you know what I mean. Do make her come out with us this morning, and listen to reason,"" she repeated, winding up helplessly."
"""I know it,"" said Jasper, with a twinge at the thought. ""Well, there is nothing more to be said or done, Miss Vanderburgh, since Polly has decided the matter. Only I want you to remember that I think she is just right about it.""Fanny Vanderburgh pouted her pretty lips in vexation. ""At least, don't try to get that dreadful boy into our own set to play games,"" she cried venomously, ""for I won't speak to him. He's a perfect boor. 'Twas only yesterday he brushed by me like a clumsy elephant, and knocked my book out of my hand, and never even picked it up. Think of that, Mr. King!""""I know--that was dreadful,"" assented Jasper, in dismay at the obstacle to the plan he had formed in his own mind, to do that very thing he was now being warned against. ""But you see, Miss Vanderburgh, he's all upset by his Grandfather's sickness.""""And I should think he would be,"" cried Fanny Vanderburgh, with spirit. ""Mrs. Griswold says she's heard him domineering over the old man, and then his Grandfather would snarl and scold like everything. She has the next state-room, you know. I don't see how those Selwyns can afford such a nice cabin,"" continued Fanny, her aristocratic nose in the air, ""they look so poor. Anyway that boy is a perfect beast, Mr. King.""""He's very different now,"" said Jasper, quickly. ""He had no idea his Grandfather was so poorly. Now I'll tell you, Miss Vanderburgh,"" Jasper turned sharply around on his heel so that he faced her. It was necessary with a girl like her to state plainly what he had to say, and to keep to it. ""I am going to ask Tom Selwyn to play games with all us young people. If it distresses you, or any one else, so that you cannot join, of course I will withdraw, and I know Polly will, and we will get up another circle that will play with him.""It was almost impossible to keep from laughing at Fanny's face, but Jasper was very grave as he waited for an answer. ""O dear me, Mr. Jasper,"" she cried, ""haven't I told you I don't really care for any one on board but Polly Pepper, and Mamma doesn't want me to mix up much with those Griswolds?"" She lowered her voice and glanced over her shoulder. ""It would make it so awkward if they should be much in New York, and we should meet. So of course I've got to do as Polly and you do. Don't you see?--it's awfully hard on me, though,"" and she clasped her hands in vexation.""Very well, then,"" said Jasper; ""now that's decided. And seeing it is, why the next thing to do, is to bring Tom down, and we'll get up a game of shuffle-board at once. He's not needed by his Grandfather now."" He didn't think it necessary to add, ""for the old gentleman won't see him, and Tom is forbidden the room by the doctor."""
"Fanny's aristocratic nose went up in alarm, and her whole face was overspread with dismay. It was one thing to anticipate evil, and quite another to find it precipitated upon one. ""I--I don't--believe I can play this morning, Mr. Jasper,"" she began hurriedly, for the first time in her young life finding herself actually embarrassed. She was even twisting her fingers.""Very well,"" said Jasper, coolly, ""then I understand that you will not play with us at any time, for, as we begin to-day, we shall keep on. I will set about getting up another party at once."" He touched his yacht cap lightly, and turned off.""I'll go right down on the lower deck with you now."" Fanny ran after him, her little boot heels clicking excitedly on the hard floor. ""The steward has marked it all for us. I got him to, while I ran to find Polly so as to engage the place,"" she added breathlessly.Fanny swallowed hard the lump in her throat, and tried to look pleasant. ""Do you go and collect the Griswolds,"" cried Jasper, radiantly, ""and I'll be back with Tom,"" and he plunged off. It was all done in a minute. And the thing that had been worrying him--how to get Tom into good shape, and to keep him there--seemed fixed in the best way possible. But Tom wouldn't go. Nothing that Jasper could do or say would move him out of the gloom into which he was cast, and at last Jasper ran down for a hurried game with the party awaiting him, to whom he explained matters in the best way he could.At last, old Mr. Selwyn was able to emerge from his state-room. Mr. King and he were the best of friends by this time, the former always, when Polly read aloud, being one of the listeners. At all such hours, indeed, and whenever Polly went to sit by the invalid, Phronsie would curl up at Polly's side, and fondle the doll that Grandpapa gave her last, which had the honour to take the European trip with the family. Phronsie would smooth the little dress down carefully, and then with her hand in Polly's, she would sit motionless till the reading was over. Mamsie, whose fingers could not be idle, although the big mending basket was left at home, would be over on the sofa, sewing busily; and little Dr. Fisher would run in and out, and beaming at them all through his spectacles, would cry cheerily, ""Well, I declare, you have the most comfortable place on the whole boat, Mr. Selwyn."" Or Dr. Jones, whom Polly thought, next to Papa Fisher, was the very nicest doctor in all the world, would appear suddenly around the curtain, and smile approval through his white teeth. At last on the fifth day out, the old man was helped up to sun himself in his steamer chair on deck. And then he had a perfect coterie around him, oh-ing and ah-ing over his illness, and expressing sympathy in every shape, for since Mr. King and his party took him up, it was quite the thing for all the other passengers to follow suit.When a few hours of this sort of thing had been going on, the old man called abruptly to Polly Pepper, who had left him, seeing he had such good company about him, and had now skipped up with Jasper to toss him a merry word, or to see if his steamer rug was all tucked in snugly around him.""Well, that will do for a start,"" the old gentleman nodded in satisfaction. ""And I'll give you some points later on about the game. Well, and you play backgammon, of course."" He didn't wait for her to answer, but finished, ""These people here drive me almost crazy, asking me how I feel, and what was the matter with me, and all that rubbish. Now, I'm going into the library, and you shall go too, and we'll have a game of backgammon."""
"Jasper began, ""Oh, Polly!"" in dismay, but she broke in, ""Yes, indeed, I do play backgammon, Mr. Selwyn, and it will be fine to have a game."" And together they helped him up and into a cosey corner of the library.Tom Selwyn came up to the door, and standing in its shadow, looked in. Jasper flung himself down on the sofa by the old gentleman's side to watch the game. Suddenly he glanced up, caught sight of Tom, although the latter's head was quickly withdrawn, and jumping up, he dashed after him.""Never you fear,"" assented old Mr. King, ""that child that I saw yesterday can compass anything in the shape of food. Why, it had its mouth full of teeth, Phronsie; it was impossible not to see them when it roared.""""Well, here we are,"" said Mr. King, holding her hand tightly. ""Bless me--are those your toes, young man?"" this to a big chubby-faced boy, whose fat legs lay across the space as he sprawled on the deck; ""just draw them in a bit, will you?--there. Well, now, Phronsie, this way. Here's the party, I believe,"" and he led her over to the other side, where a knot of steerage passengers were huddled together. In the midst sat a woman, chubby faced, and big and square, holding a baby. She had a big red shawl wrapped around her, in the folds of which snuggled the baby, who was contentedly chewing one end of it, while his mother had her eyes on the rest of her offspring, of which there seemed a good many. When the baby saw Phronsie, he stopped chewing the old shawl and grinned, showing all the teeth of which Mr. King had spoken. The other children, tow headed and also chubby, looked at the basket hanging on Phronsie's arm, and also grinned.""I have brought you some fruit,"" said Phronsie, holding out her basket, whereat all the tow headed group except the baby crowded each other dreadfully to see all there was in it. ""I'm sorry the flowers are gone, so I couldn't bring any to-day. May the baby have this?"" holding out a pear by the stem.The baby settled that question by lunging forward and seizing the pear with two fat hands, when he immediately sank into the depths of the old shawl again, all his teeth quite busy at work. Phronsie set down her basket on the deck, and the rest of the brood emptied it to their own satisfaction. Their mother's stolid face lighted up with a broad smile that showed all her teeth, and very white and even they were.""I can hold him just as easy, Grandpapa dear,"" said Phronsie, her lips drooping mournfully. ""See."" And she sat down on a big coil of rope near by and smoothed out her brown gown. ""Please, Grandpapa dear.""""He'll cry,"" said Mr. King, quickly. ""Oh, no, Phronsie, it wouldn't do to take him away from his mother. You see it would be dreadful to set that child to roaring--very dreadful indeed."" Yet he hung over her in distress at the drooping little face."
"""The family seems unusually clean,"" observed Mr. King to himself. ""And the doctor says there's no sickness on board, and it's a very different lot of steerage folks going this way from coming out, all of which I've settled before coming down here,"" he reflected. ""Well, Phronsie--yes--I see no reason why you may not hold the baby if you want to."" And before the words were hardly out of his mouth, the chubby-faced woman had set the fat baby in the middle of the brown gown smoothed out to receive him. He clung to his pear with both hands and ate away with great satisfaction, regardless of his new resting-place.""Just come here!"" Mrs. Griswold, in immaculately fitting garments, evidently made up freshly for steamer use, beckoned with a hasty hand to her husband. ""It's worth getting up to see."" He flung down his novel and tumbled out of his steamer chair. ""Look down there!""""Sh!--don't speak so loud,"" warned Mrs. Griswold, who was doing most of the talking herself. And plucking his sleeve, she emphasised every word with fearful distinctness close to his ear. ""She's got a dirty steerage baby in her lap, and Mr. King is laughing. Well, I never! O dear me, here come the young people!""""I should think not,"" replied Polly, with a little pang at her heart whenever Badgertown was mentioned. ""We used to run around the little brown house, and see how many times we could do it without stopping.""Jasper gave a halloo, and waved his hand, and Polly danced up and down and called, and waved her hands too. And Phronsie gave a little crow of delight. ""See, Grandpapa, there they are; I want Polly--and Jasper, too."" And old Mr. King whirled around. ""O dear me! Come down, both of you,"" which command it did not take them long to obey.""Well, I never did in all my life,"" ejaculated Mrs. Griswold, ""see anything like that. Now if some people""--she didn't say ""we""--""should do anything like that, 'twould be dreadfully erratic and queer. But those Kings can do anything,"" she added, with venom.""Haven't those Pepper children got a good berth?"" exclaimed Mrs. Griswold, unable to keep her eyes off from the small group below. ""And their Mother Pepper, or Fisher, or whatever her name is--I declare it's just like a novel, the way I heard the story from Mrs. Vanderburgh about it all.""""And I wish you'd let me get back to my book, Louisa,"" exclaimed Mr. Griswold, tartly, at the mention of the word ""novel,"" beginning to look longingly at his deserted steamer chair, ""for it's precious little time I get to read on shore. Seems as if I might have a little peace at sea."""
"""We men want to talk sense,"" growled her husband, turning off. But Mrs. Griswold was engrossed in her survey of Mr. King and the doings of his party, and either didn't hear or didn't care what was remarked outside of that interest.Tom Selwyn just then ran up against some one as clumsily as ever. It proved to be the ship's doctor, who surveyed him coldly and passed on. Tom gave a start and swallowed hard, then plunged after him. ""Oh, I say.""""If you can so conduct yourself that your Grandfather will not be excited,"" at last said the doctor,--what an age it seemed to Tom,--""I see no reason why you shouldn't see your Grandfather, and go back to your state-room. But let me tell you, young man, it was a pretty close shave for him the other day. Had he slipped away, you'd have had that on your conscience that would have lasted you for many a day."" With this, and a parting keen glance, he turned on his heel and strode off.In about half an hour, the steerage baby having gone to sleep in Phronsie's arms, the brothers and sisters, finding, after the closest inspection, nothing more to eat in the basket, gathered around the centre of attraction in a small bunch.""Never you fear,"" said old Mr. King, quite comfortable now in the camp-chair one of the sailors had brought in response to a request from Jasper; ""that child knows very well by this time, I should imagine, what noise is.""""Dear, dear!"" echoed Polly, vainly trying to induce the child next to the baby to get into her lap; ""something must be done. Oh, don't you want to hear about a funny cat, children? I'm going to tell them about Grandma Bascom's, Jasper,"" she said, seeing the piteous look in Phronsie's eyes.""Sit down, then,"" said Polly, socially making way for them, ""all of you in a circle, and I'll tell you of that very funny cat."" So the whole bunch of tow-headed children sat down in a ring, and solemnly folded their hands in their laps. Jasper threw himself down where he could edge himself in. Old Mr. King leaned back and surveyed them with great satisfaction. So Polly launched out in her gayest mood, and the big blue eyes in the round faces before her widened, and the mouths flew open, showing the white teeth; and the stolid mother leaned forward, and her eyes and mouth looked just like those of her children, only they were bigger; and at last Polly drew a long breath and wound up with a flourish, ""And that's all.""""Oh, no, Polly, please don't go yet,"" begged Phronsie, in alarm, and patting the baby softly with a gentle little hand. Polly looked off at Grandpapa. He was placidly surveying the water, his eyes occasionally roving over the novel and interesting sights around. On the other side of the deck a returning immigrant was bringing out a jew's-harp, and two or three of his fellow-passengers were preparing to pitch quoits. Old Mr. King was actually smiling at it all. Polly hadn't seen him so contented since they sailed.So Polly flew off on a gay little story about a dog that bade fair to rival Grandma Bascom's cat for cleverness. He belonged to Mr. Atkins who kept store in Badgertown, and the Pepper children used to see a good deal of him, when they took home the sacks and coats that Mamsie sewed for the storekeeper. And in the midst of the story, when the stolid steerage children were actually laughing over the antics of that remarkable dog, Jasper glanced up toward the promenade deck, took a long look, and started to his feet. ""Why, Polly Pepper, see!"" He pointed upward. There, on the curve, were old Mr. Selwyn and Tom walking arm in arm."
"And after that, it was ""My grandson, Thomas,"" on all occasions, the old gentleman introducing the boy to the right and to the left, as he paraded the deck, his old arm within the younger one. And the little, sharp black eyes snapped proudly and the white head was held up, as he laughed and chattered away sociably to the passengers and the ship's crew, at every good opportunity.""Yes, my grandson, Thomas, is going back to school. We've been running about in your country a bit, and the boy's mother went home first with the other children--"" Polly heard him say as the two paused in front of her steamer chair.""Indeed!"" ejaculated Mrs. Vanderburgh, as he addressed her, and raising her eyebrows with a supercilious glance for his plain, unprepossessing appearance. ""Yes, Madam, and glad shall I be to set my foot on Old England again Hey, Tom, my boy, don't you say so?""""Do sit down, Mamma, in your steamer chair,"" begged Fanny; ""I'll tuck you up in your rug."" And she jumped lightly out of her own chair. ""There, that's nice,"" as Mrs. Vanderburgh sank gracefully down, and Fanny patted and pulled the rug into shape. ""Now tell us, wasn't he the most horrible old bore?""Mrs. Vanderburgh glanced into the steamer chair on the other side. It had several books on top of the rug. ""I don't believe he can take that seat,"" she said; ""still, Fanny, I think it would be well for you to change into it, for that old man may take it into his head, when he makes the turn of the deck, to drop into it and give us the whole of his family history.""""Horrors!"" ejaculated Fanny, hopping out of her chair again. ""I'll make sure that he doesn't. And yet I did so want to sit next to Polly Pepper,"" she mourned, ensconcing herself under the neighbouring rug, and putting the books on the floor by her side.""They are terribly common people,"" said Fanny, her aristocratic nose well in the air, ""aren't they, Mamma? And did you ever see such a clumsy thing as that dreadful boy, and such big hands and feet?"" She held up her own hands as she spoke, and played with her rings, and let the jingling bracelets run up and down her wrists.""Fanny, how often must I tell you to wear gloves on shipboard?"" said her mother, in a tone of reproof. ""Nothing spoils the hands so much as a trip at sea. They won't get over it all summer; they're coarsened already,"" and she cast an alarmed glance at the long, slender fingers.Mrs. Vanderburgh hesitated. It wouldn't do to say anything that would reflect against the Peppers--manners, or customs, or bringing up generally. So she leaned over and touched Polly's fingers with her own gloved ones.""Trust me for that,"" said Fanny, with a wise little nod. ""The old man stopped me and asked me something this morning, as I was coming out of the dining room, after breakfast, but I pretended I didn't hear, and I skipped upstairs and almost fell on my nose."""
"""You were fortunate to escape,"" said her mother, with a little laugh. ""Well, let us drop the subject and talk of something else much more important. Polly, my dear."" She turned again and surveyed the young girl at her side. ""You are coming home this autumn, aren't you?""""Thank you; but I couldn't anyway,"" said Polly. Then the colour flew up to her cheek. ""I mean I am in school, you know, Mrs. Vanderburgh, but I thank you, and it is so good of you to want me,"" she added, hurriedly, feeling that she hadn't said the right thing at all.""I do want you very much, my dear child,"" said Mrs. Vanderburgh, ""and I am very sorry you are to remain abroad over the winter, for your Grandfather would be persuaded, I feel quite sure, to have you leave school for a while, and come to us for a visit.""""The Christmas holidays!"" exclaimed Polly, starting forward in her chair. ""Oh, I wouldn't leave home for anything, then, Mrs. Vanderburgh. Why, we have the most beautiful times, and we are all together--the boys come home from school--and it's just too lovely for anything!"" She clasped her hands and sighed--oh, if she could but see Ben and Joel and David but once!""Oh, he will fall into the plan quite readily, I think,"" said Mrs. Vanderburgh, lightly. ""You know we are all very old friends--that is, the families are--Mr. Vanderburgh's father and Mr. King were very intimate. Perhaps you don't know, Polly,""--and Fanny's mamma drew herself up to her extreme height; it was impossible for her to loll back in her chair when talking of her family,--""that we are related to the Earl of Cavendish who owns the old estate in England, and we go back to William the Conqueror; that is, Fanny does on her father's side.""""And my family is just as important,"" said Mrs. Vanderburgh, and she smiled in great satisfaction. ""Really, we could make things very pleasant for you, my child; our set is so exclusive, you could not possibly meet any one but the very best people. Oh, here is your mother."" She smiled enchantingly up at Mrs. Fisher, and held out her hand. ""Do come and sit here with us, my dear Mrs. Fisher,"" she begged, ""then we shall be a delightful group, we two mothers and our daughters.""""No, child--that is, not much,"" said old Mr. King, trying to smooth his brows out. He was thinking--for it kept obtruding at all times and seasons--of that dreadful scrap of paper that Cousin Eunice had imposed upon him at the last minute before they sailed, announcing that she had had her way, and would at last compel acceptance of such a gift as she chose to make to Phronsie Pepper.""Well, it doesn't,"" said Grandpapa; ""that is it won't, now that I have you with me. I was thinking of something unpleasant, Phronsie, and then, to tell you the truth, that old Mr. Selwyn tires me to death. I can't talk to him, and his grandson is a cad.""""Goodness me, child, you ask me too much,"" said Mr. King, quickly; ""oh, a variety of reasons. Well, we must take things as we find them, and do what we can to help matters along; but it seems a hopeless case,--things were in better shape; and now they seem all tangled up again, thanks to that boy.""""Mr. King,"" Tom began very rapidly so that the words ran all over each other, ""I'm no end sorry--don't think hard things of me--it's not my fault this time; Grandfather heard it as well as I--at least, I caught a little and he asked me what it was, and I had to tell him, and it upset him."""
"Old Mr. King stood gazing into the big boy's face in utter bewilderment. ""As I don't know in the least what you are trying to tell me, my boy,"" at last he said, ""I shall have to ask you to repeat it, and go slowly.""""Well, well, it's not worth thinking of,"" at last he said at sight of the flashing eyes before him and the angry light on the young face. ""You take my arm, or I'll take yours, Master Tom,--there, that's better,--and we'll do a bit of a turn on the deck. Your grandfather'll come out of it, for he's busy over the backgammon board. But it was an ugly thing to do just the same."" ""Oh, Polly! Polly!"" Phronsie came running along the deck, and up to the little group playing shuffle-board; ""there's such a very big whale."" And she clasped her hands in great excitement. ""There truly is. Do come and see him.""""I'm sorry he can't breathe,"" said Phronsie, anxiously trying to steer clear of the bunch of steamer chairs whose occupants had suddenly left them, too, to see the whale. ""Poor whale--I'm sorry for him, Polly.""""Yes, indeed; that is, in the whale's case,"" answered Polly, as they ran up to Grandpapa and the rest of their party, and the knots of other passengers, all staring hard at a certain point on the sparkling waste of water.""I thought you were never coming,"" said old Mr. King, moving away from the rail to tuck Polly and Phronsie in where they could get a good view. ""Oh, there he is--there he is--Jasper, look!"" cried Polly.""Oh, Grandpapa, he's coming right here!"" screamed Phronsie, clapping her hands in delight, and hopping up and down,--Polly and Jasper were almost as much excited,--while the passengers ran hither and thither to get a good view, and levelled their big glasses, and oh-ed and ah-ed. And some of them ran to get their cameras. And Mr. Whale seemed to like it, for he spouted and flirted his long tail and dashed into the water and out again to blow, till they were all quite worn out looking at him. At last, with a final plunge, he bade them all good-by and disappeared.Phronsie, after her first scream of delight, had pressed her face close to the rail and held her breath. She did not say a word, but gazed in speechless enjoyment at the antics of the big fish. And Grandpapa had to speak two or three times when the show was all over before she heard him.""Oh, wasn't it splendid!"" exclaimed Polly, tossing back the little rings of brown hair from her brow. ""Well, he's gone; now we must run back, Jasper, and finish our game."" And they were off, the other players following."
"""Well, I'll get into my steamer chair, and you shall sit in my lap, and then I'll tell you about some of them,"" said Mr. King, much gratified. As they moved off, Phronsie clinging to his hand, she looked back and saw two children gazing wistfully after them. ""Grandpapa,"" she whispered, pulling his hand gently to attract attention, ""may that little boy and girl come, too, and hear about your whales?""""Yes, to be sure,"" cried Mr. King. So Phronsie called them, and in a few minutes there was quite a big group around Grandpapa's steamer chair; for when the other children saw what was going on, they stopped, too, and before he knew, there he was perfectly surrounded.""I should very much like to hear what it is all about."" Mrs. Vanderburgh's soft voice broke into a pause, when old Mr. King stopped to rest a bit. ""You must be very fascinating, dear Mr. King; you have no idea how pretty your group is."" She pulled Fanny forward gently into the outer fringe of the circle. ""Pray, what is the subject?""""Oh, I should be charmed,"" cried Mrs. Vanderburgh. ""Fanny dear, draw up that steamer chair to the other side."" But a stout, comfortable-looking woman coming down the deck stopped directly in front of that same chair, and before Fanny could move it, sat down, saying, ""This is my chair, young lady.""""Ugh!"" Mrs. Vanderburgh shrugged her shoulders as she looked at the occupant of the chair, who surveyed her calmly, then fell to reading her book. ""Well, you must just bear it, dear; it's one of the annoyances to be endured on shipboard.""""Lady? Oh, my dear Mr. King!"" Mrs. Vanderburgh gave a soft little laugh. ""It's very good of you to put it that way, I'm sure. Well, now do let us hear that delightful story. Fanny dear, you can sit on part of my chair,"" she added, regardless of the black looks of a gentleman hovering near, who had a sharp glance on the green card hanging to the back of the chair she had appropriated and that bore his name.So Fanny perched on the end of the steamer chair, and Mr. King, not seeing any way out of it, went on in his recital of the whale story, winding up with an account of some wonderful porpoises he had seen, and a variety of other things, until suddenly he turned his head and keenly regarded Fanny's mother.""Oh, no, indeed, I have been charmed every moment,"" protested Mrs. Vanderburgh sitting quite erect. ""You surely have the gift of a _raconteur_, Mr. King,"" she said, gracefully recovering herself. ""O dear me, here is that odious boy and that tiresome old man!"" as Tom Selwyn came up slowly, his Grandfather on his arm.Mr. King put Phronsie gently off from his lap, still keeping her hand in his. ""Now, children, the story-telling is all done, the whales and porpoises are all finished up--so run away."" He touched his sea-cap to Mrs. Vanderburgh and her daughter, then marched up to the old man and Tom."
"Tom shot him a grateful look. Old Mr. Selwyn, who cared most of all for Polly, mumbled out something, but did not seem especially happy. But Mr. King did not appear to notice anything awry, but fell into step, still keeping Phronsie's hand, and they paced off.""Well, Papa isn't here,"" said Fanny, ""and if he were, he'd do something to keep in with Mr. King. I hate and detest those dreadful Selwyns as much as you do, Mamma, but I'm going to cultivate them. See if I don't!""""And I forbid it,"" said her mother, forgetting herself and raising her voice. ""They are low bred and common. And beside that, they are eccentric and queer. Don't you speak to them or notice them in the slightest.""""It seems to me there are more ill-bred, low-lived people on board this boat than it has been my lot to meet on any voyage,"" said Mrs. Vanderburgh, drawing her sea coat around her slight figure and sailing off, her daughter in her wake.Mr. King nodded pleasantly, although deep in his heart he agreed with the choleric old gentleman. ""But as for Polly, why, she's good--good as gold, sir."" There was no mistaking Mr. Selwyn's sentiments there, and his old cheek glowed while giving what to him meant the most wonderful praise to be paid to a person.The little old gentleman squinted hard at the clouds scudding across the blue sky. ""That's so,"" he said at last. ""Well, I'm sorry we are to part,"" he added. ""And, sir, I really wish you would come down to my place with your party and give me a fortnight during your stay in England. I really do, sir, upon me word."" There was no mistaking his earnestness as he thrust out one thin, long-fingered hand. With the other, he set a card within Mr. King's fingers.""I had a fancy to do this thing,"" said the little old gentleman, ""to run across from America in simple fashion, and it pleased the boy, who hates a fuss. And we've gotten rid of all sorts of nuisances by it; interviews, and tiresome people. And I've enjoyed it mightily."" He chuckled away till it seemed as if he were never going to stop. Old Mr. King burst out laughing, too; and the pair were so very jolly that the passengers, grouped together waiting for the Liverpool landing, turned to stare at them.""Just see how intimate Mr. King is with that tiresome, common, old Mr. Selwyn!"" exclaimed Mrs. Vanderburgh to her daughter. ""I never was so surprised at anything in all my life, to see that he keeps it up now, for I thought that aristocratic Horatio King was the most fastidious being alive."""
"""The Kings have awfully nice times,"" grumbled Fanny, picking her gloves discontentedly. ""And you keep me mewed up, and won't let me speak to anybody whose grandfather wasn't born in our set, and I hate and loathe it all.""""You'll be glad when you are a few years older, and I bring you out in society, that I always have been so particular,"" observed Mrs. Vanderburgh, complacently, lifting her head in its dainty bonnet, higher than ever.""I want some nice times and a little fun now,"" whined Fanny, with an envious glance over at Polly and Jasper with the dreadful Selwyn boy between them, and Phronsie running up to join them, and everybody in their party just bubbling over with happiness.""Yes, indeed; I talked for fully half an hour yesterday, but it was no use. And he doesn't seem to know how long he is going to stay in England; 'only a few days,' he said, vaguely, then they go to Holland.""""Why, Fanny Vanderburgh!"" exclaimed her mother, sharply, ""what is the matter with you? You know it was settled long ago, that we should meet Mrs. Van Dyke and Eleanor in Paris at just this very time. It would never do to offend them, particularly when Eleanor is going to marry into the Howard set.""""Yes, that's one thing that I wanted the Kings to go to Paris for,"" said Mrs. Vanderburgh; ""you could be with them. And really they are much more important than any one to get in with. And I'd keep up the friendship with the Van Dykes. But that Mr. King is so obstinate, you can't do anything with him."" A frown settled all across her pretty face, and she beat her foot impatiently on the deck.""You spoil everything, Mamma, with your sets and your stupid people,"" declared Fanny, her passion by no means cooled. ""When I come out in society I'm going to choose my own friends,"" she muttered to herself, and set her lips tightly together.""So you shall,"" cried the little Earl, glancing around on the groups, ""and it's better just here, at all events,"" and he chuckled again. ""Then you really will come?"" and he actually seized Mr. King's hand and wrung it heartily.The Earl of Cavendish stared blankly up out of his sharp little black eyes in utter amazement into the other's face. ""My stay in London is short, only a few days,"" Mr. King was saying, ""and then we go directly to Holland. I thank you all the same--believe me, I appreciate it. It is good of you to ask us,"" he cordially added.The little Earl of Cavendish broke away from him, and took a few hasty steps down the deck to get this new idea fairly into his brain that his invitation had not been accepted. Then he hurried back. ""My dear sir,"" he said, laying his hand on Mr. King's arm, ""will you do me the favour to try to come at some future time--to consider your plans before you return to America, and see if you can't manage to give me this great pleasure of welcoming you to my home? Think of it, I beg, and drop me a line; if at home, I shall always be most glad to have you with me. I should esteem it a privilege."" The Earl of Cavendish was astonished to find himself beseeching the American gentleman without a title. And then they awaked to the fact that the groups of passengers were merging into a solid mass, and a slow procession was beginning to form for the stairway, and the landing episode was well under way."
"""Oh, we are _so_ sorry you are not going to Paris with us,"" cried Mrs. Vanderburgh, while Fanny flew at Polly Pepper and engrossed her hungrily. ""Can't you reconsider it now?"" she asked, with a pretty earnestness.""Yes, we shall; we meet old friends there, and Paris is always delightful."" Mrs. Vanderburgh bit her lip in her vexation. ""I was going to see you and beg you even now to change your plans, while we were on the steamer waiting to land,"" she went on hurriedly, ""but you were bored--I quite pitied you--by that tiresome, common, old Mr. Selwyn.""""I did not know it till this morning,"" Mr. King was explaining, ""but our fellow-passenger, Mr. Selwyn, chose to cross over keeping his real identity unknown, and I must say I admire his taste in the matter; and anyway it was his affair and not mine."" It was a long speech, and at its conclusion Mrs. Vanderburgh was still demanding, ""Who--who?"" in as much of a puzzle as ever.The little doctor came out of his ill temper, but he said ruefully, ""That's all very well, wife, for you and the Hendersons; for you steered pretty clear, I noticed, of that woman. Well, she's gone."" And he smiled cheerfully. ""Now for dinner, for I suppose Mr. King has ordered it.""""All right."" The little doctor was already plunging here and there, tearing off his coat and necktie and boots; and exactly at the time set, he joined the party, with a bright and shining face, as if no Mrs. Vanderburgh, or any one in the least resembling her, had ever crossed his path.""Father always does seem to plan things rightly,"" answered Jasper, with a good degree of pride. ""And then 'it's prime,'"" ""as Joel used to say,"" he was going to add, but thought better of it, as any reference to the boys always set Polly to longing for them.""You do things for him all the while, Polly,"" Jasper made haste to say, as they ran along to keep up with the Parson and Mrs. Henderson's comfortable figures just before them; ""you are all the while doing something for him.""""Yes, indeed,"" said Jasper; ""there always are things that hop up to be done when people keep their eyes open. But don't you worry about your not doing anything for him, Polly. Promise me that."" Jasper took her hand and stopped just a minute to look into her face.""Did he, Jasper?"" cried Polly, well pleased, the colour flying over her cheek, ""that was nice of him, because there isn't anything much I can really do for him. O dear! there is Grandpapa beckoning to us to hurry."" So on they sped, having no breath for words. And presently they were on the boat, and little Dr. Fisher and Mr. Henderson went forward into the saloon, where the rooms reserved beforehand were to be given out, and the rest of the party waited and watched the stream of people of all ages and sizes and nationalities who desired to reach Holland the next morning.To Polly it was a world of delight, and to Jasper, who watched her keenly, it was a revelation to see how nothing escaped her, no matter how noisy and dirty or turbulent the crowd, or how annoying the detention,--it was all a marvel of happiness from beginning to end. And Jasper looking back over the two times he had been before to Europe with his father, although he had never seen Holland, remembered only a sort of dreary drifting about with many pleasant episodes and experiences, it is true, still with the feeling on the whole of the most distinct gladness when their faces were turned homeward and the journeying was over."
"""Mamsie,"" cried Polly, poking her head out from the upper berth of the stuffy little state-room assigned to Mrs. Fisher, Mrs. Henderson, Phronsie, and herself; ""was anything ever so delicious as this boat?--and to think, Mamsie,""--here Polly paused to add as impressively as if the idea had never been voiced before,--""that we are really to see Holland to-morrow."" It seemed to Polly as if she had only breathed twice, and had not turned over once, when there was Mamsie's voice calling her, and there was Mamsie's face looking into hers over the edge of the berth. ""Wake up, Polly, child, you have only about ten minutes to dress in.""""O dear me! what--where?"" exclaimed Polly, springing to a sitting position, thereby giving her brown head a smart thump on the ceiling of the berth, ""where are we, Mamsie? why, it is the middle of the night, isn't it?"" she cried, not stopping to pity her poor head.""We are almost at the Hook of Holland,"" said Mrs. Fisher, busily buttoning Phronsie's shoes. Phronsie sat on the lower berth, her sleepy little legs dangling over the edge, and her sleepy little head going nid-nodding, despite all her efforts to keep herself awake.""I will dress Polly Pepper in a twinkling, Mamsie,"" declared Polly, laughing merrily; ""O dear me, where _is_ my other stocking?"" She stuck out one black foot ready for its boot. ""Is it down there, Mamsie?"" All the while she was shaking the bedclothes violently for any chance glimpse of it in the berth.""Where did you put it last night when you took it off, Polly?"" asked Mrs. Fisher, buttoning away for dear life on Phronsie's shoes. ""There now, Pet, those are done; hop out now, and fly into your clothes.""""But I can't go with only one stocking on,"" said Polly, quite gone in despair now. ""Oh, dear Mrs. Henderson, don't you see it on the floor?"" For that good woman had dropped to her knees, and was busily prowling around among the accumulation of bags and clothing.""I'll help Polly to find it,"" cried Phronsie, now thoroughly awake and dropping her small skirts to get down on the floor by Mrs. Henderson's side. ""Don't feel badly, Polly; I'll find your stocking for you.""""No, Phronsie,"" said her mother, ""you must get into your own clothes. And then Mrs. Henderson is nearly all ready, and you can go out with her, and that will leave more room, so that Polly and I can search more carefully. And the stocking has got to come, for it couldn't walk off of itself,"" she added cheerily as she saw Polly's face. ""Why--what?"" as she happened to look upward. And then Polly looked, too, and there was her stocking dangling from the very high hook where the big hat had been.""You tossed it up there, I suppose, when you shook up the bedclothes so quickly,"" said Mrs. Fisher. ""Well, now,"" as Polly pounced on the stocking, ""see how fast you can hop into your clothes, daughter."" Then she began to put the things for the bags into their places, and Matilda, coming in, finished the work; and Polly flew around, buttoning and tying and patting herself into shape, and by the time that little Dr. Fisher's voice called at the door, ""Well, wife, are you ready?"" there they all were, trim and tidy as ever for a start."
"""Where is it, Grandpapa?"" asked Phronsie, peering around on either side,--Dr. Fisher and Jasper had gone off to attend to the examination of the luggage by the customs inspectors,--and then coming up gently to pull his arm. ""I don't see it anywhere.""""Oh, no, Grandpapa, I haven't,"" began Phronsie, in gentle protestation, ""all my things are in here."" She patted her little bag that hung on her arm, a gift of old Mr. King's for her to carry her very own things in, that yielded her immense satisfaction every time she looked at it, which was very often.""Stay, Polly,"" commanded Mr. King. And, ""Oh, no, I haven't,"" piped Phronsie, as Polly was flying off. ""It's here in my bag,"" patting Grandpapa's gift hanging on her arm. ""I couldn't lose that, Polly,"" she cried in horror at the thought, as Polly hurried back.""Oh, bless me, child!"" exclaimed Mr. King, ""that is the name of the place; at least, to be accurate, it is Hoek van Holland. Now, just as soon as we get fairly started on our way to Rotterdam, I'll tell you all about it, or Polly shall, since she was clever enough to find out what you meant.""""And so I will,"" he promised, very much pleased, for Mr. King dearly loved to be the one to relate the history and anecdotes about the places along which they travelled. And so, when they were steaming off toward Rotterdam, as he sat in the centre of the compartment he had reserved for their use, Phronsie next to him, and Polly and Jasper opposite, he told the whole story. The others tucked themselves in the remaining four seats, and did not lose a word. Matilda and Mr. King's valet, in a second-class compartment, took charge of the luggage.""No, I should think not,"" laughed his father, in high good humour. ""Well, Phronsie, I think you will like the folks on the Island of Marken, for they dress in funny quaint costumes, just as their ancestors did, years upon years ago.""""I can't make them wear anything but what they want to,"" said old Mr. King, with a laugh; ""but don't be troubled, child, you'll see all the wooden shoes you desire, in Rotterdam, and The Hague, too, for that matter.""""Yes, they do, because they are born and brought up to it, although, for the life of me, I don't see how they do it; but you couldn't, child, you'd fall the first minute and break your nose, most likely.""""Grandpapa,"" she said, reaching up to whisper again, ""I'm afraid it will make Araminta feel badly to see me with my beautiful wooden shoes on, when she can't have any. Do you suppose there are little teenty ones, Grandpapa dear, and I might get her a pair?""Phronsie slid down into her place again, and sat quite still lost in thought. So many wooden shoes she couldn't count them was quite beyond her. But Grandpapa's voice roused her. ""And I'll buy a bushel of them, Phronsie, and send them home, so that all your dolls at home can each have a pair. Would that suit you, Pet?""Phronsie screamed with delight and clapped her hands. Polly and Jasper who had changed places, as Dr. Fisher and Mr. Henderson had made them take theirs by one window, now whirled around. ""What is it?"" cried Polly of Phronsie. ""What is it?"""
"""I'm going to have wooden shoes,"" announced Phronsie, in a burst of confidence that included everybody in the compartment, ""for my very own self, and Araminta is going to have a pair, and every single one of my children at home, too. Grandpapa said so.""""Oh, Dr. Fisher, we are not going to fall!"" exclaimed Jasper, in disdain, at the very thought. And ""No, indeed,"" came merrily from Polly. And then they all fell to work admiring the numberless windmills past which their train was speeding toward Rotterdam.""To think it is only six o'clock!"" exclaimed Polly, looking at her little travelling watch that Grandpapa had given her. ""Now, what a fine long day we are going to have, Jasper, for sightseeing in Rotterdam.""As the train came to a standstill, the guards threw open compartment doors, and all the people poured out calling for porters to see to their luggage, and everything was in confusion at once on the platforms.""Indeed, you won't, Miss Polly,"" declared Mr. King, overhearing it, as they waited till all was ready for them to get into the hotel coach,--""we are all going to spend this day at the hotel--first, in getting a good breakfast, and then, dear me, I shall sleep pretty much all of the morning, and I'd advise the rest of you to jump into your beds and get good naps after the experience on that atrocious steamboat last night.""""Well, not exactly into your beds,"" laughed Mr. King, as Jasper, announcing that all was ready, piloted them into the coach, ""but you've got to rest like sensible beings. Make up your mind to that. As for Phronsie,"" and he gallantly lifted her up to the step, ""she's half asleep already. She's got to have a splendid nap, and no mistake.""""I'm not sleepy,"" declared Phronsie, stumbling into the high coach to sit down next to Mother Fisher. ""No, Grandpapa dear, not a bit."" And before anybody knew it, and as soon as the coach wheels spun round, she rolled over into Mamsie's lap. There she was as fast asleep as could be! They had been several days at The Hague, running about in a restful way in the morning, and driving all the long golden afternoons. ""Don't you dare to go into a picture-gallery or a museum until I give the word,"" Grandpapa had laid down the law. ""I'm not going to begin by being all tired out."" So Polly and Jasper had gone sometimes with Mr. King and Phronsie, who had a habit of wandering off by themselves; or, as the case might be, Mr. Henderson would pilot them about till they learnt the ways of the old town. And Mrs. Fisher and Mrs. Henderson would confess now and then that they would much rather take a few stitches and overlook the travelling clothes than do any more sight-seeing. And then again, they would all come together and go about in a big party. All but Dr. Fisher--he was for hospitals every time.""That's what I've come for, wife,"" he would reply to all remonstrance, ""and don't ask me to put my head into a cathedral or a museum."" To Mr. King, ""Land alive, man, I've got to find out how to take care of living bodies before I stare at bones and relics,"" and Mr. King would laugh and let him alone. ""He's incorrigible, that husband of yours, Mrs. Fisher,"" he would add, ""and we must just let him have his way."" And Mamsie would smile, and every night the little doctor would tome from his tramps and medical study, tired but radiant."
"""Don't mind it, Polly,"" said Jasper, her next neighbour, ""I want to do the same thing. And it will do some of those starched and prim people good to hear a little enthusiasm."" Polly knew whom he meant,--some young Englishmen. One of them immediately put up his monocle and regarded her as if she had been a new kind of creature displayed for his benefit. Jasper glared back at him.""Yes, we'll go to Scheveningen this morning,"" repeated Mr. King, smiling approvingly at poor Polly, which caused her to lift her head; ""the carriages are ordered, so as soon as we are through breakfast we will be off.""Polly's face had drooped, too. Mr. King, in looking from one to the other, was dismayed and a good bit annoyed to find that his plan wasn't productive of much happiness after all. He had just opened his mouth to say authoritatively, ""No use, Jasper, either you will go in the way I have provided, or stay at home,"" when Phronsie slipped out of her chair where she happened this morning to be sitting next to Mother Fisher, and running around to his chair, piped out, ""Oh, Grandpapa, if you please, do let us sit up top.""""Oh, yes, yes, Grandpapa, please""--Phronsie beat her hands softly together--""to ride on top; may we, _dear_ Grandpapa?"" That ""dear Grandpapa"" settled it. Jasper never heard such a welcome command as that Mr. King was just issuing. ""Go to the office and countermand the order for the carriages, my son; tell them to put the amount on my bill, the same as if I'd used them, unless they get a chance to let them to some one else. They needn't be the losers. Now then,"" as Jasper bounded off to execute the command, ""get on your bonnets and hats, all of you, and we'll try this wonderful tram-car. I suppose you won't come with us, but will stay behind for the pleasures of some hospital here,"" he added to Dr. Fisher.""Now, then, all scramble up here. Phronsie, you go with me,"" cried old Mr. King, as they stood in _plein_, and the tram-car halted before them. He was surprised to find that he liked this sort of thing, mixing with a crowd and hurrying for seats just like common ordinary individuals. And as he toiled up the winding stairs, Phronsie in front of him, he had an exhilaration already that made him feel almost as young as Polly and Jasper, scampering up the circular stairway at the other end. ""Well, bless me, we are up, aren't we?"" he exclaimed, sitting down and casting a glance around.""Yes, I do, my boy,"" answered his father, frankly. ""Now run off with you, you've planned it well."" So Jasper, made happy for the day, rushed back to his seat. A hand not over clean was laid on it, and a tall individual, who was pouring out very bad provincial French at a fearful rate, was just about to worm himself into it. Polly, who sat next, had turned around to view the scenery from the other side, and hadn't seen his advance.But the Frenchman being there, thought that he could get still further into the seat. So he twisted and edged, but Jasper slipped neatly in, and looked calmly up at him. The Frenchman, unable to get his balance, sat down in Jasper's lap. But he bounded up again, blue with rage."
"Not understanding the language, all might have gone well, but the French person could interpret the expression of the face under the white hair, and he accordingly left a position in front of Jasper to sidle up toward Mr. King's seat in a threatening attitude. At that Jasper got out of his seat again and went to his father's side. Little Dr. Fisher also skipped up.""See here you, Frenchy, stop your parley vousing, and march down those stairs double quick,"" cried the little doctor, standing on his tiptoes and bristling with indignation. His big spectacles had slipped to the end of his nose, his sharp little eyes blazing above them.""Frenchy"" stared at him in amazement, unable to find his tongue. And then he saw another gentleman in the person of the parson, who was just as big as the doctor was small. With one look he glanced around to see if there were any more such specimens. At any rate, it was time to be going, so he took a bee-line for the nearest stairway and plunged down. But he gave the little doctor the compliment of his parting regard.""Well,"" ejaculated Mr. King, when his party had regained their seats and the car started off, ""if this is to be the style of our companions, I think my plan of carriages might be best after all. Eh, my boy?"" with a sly look at Jasper.""Don't let him bother you to see everything, Polly,"" called Grandpapa. ""Take my advice--it's a nuisance to try to compass the whole place on the first visit."" But Polly laughed back, and the advice went over her head, as he very well knew it would.""Was anything ever more beautiful?"" exclaimed Mother Fisher, drawing in long breaths of delight. The little doctor leaned back in his seat, and beamed at her over his big glasses. She began to look rested and young already. ""This journey is the very thing,"" he declared to himself, and his hard-worked hand slipped itself over her toil-worn one as it lay on her lap. She turned to him with a smile.""Just see those beautiful green trees, so soft and trembling,"" she exclaimed, as enthusiastically as Polly herself. ""And what a perfect arch!"" And she bent forward to glance down the shaded avenue. ""Oh, Adoniram!""""But you are always copying off the things into your journal,"" said Jasper, ""afterward. So do I mark my Baedeker; it's the only way to jot things down in any sort of order. One can't be whipping out a note-book every minute. Halloo, here we are at the château of the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar. Look, Polly! look!"""
"As they looked back in the distance to the receding ducal estate, Polly said: ""It isn't one-half as beautiful as this delicious old wood is, Jasper. Just see that perfectly beautiful walk down there and that cunning little trail. Oh, I do so wish we could stay here.""When they left the tram-car at the beginning of the village of Scheveningen they set off on a walk down to the _Curhaus_ and the beach. Old Mr. King, as young as any one, started out on the promenade on the undulating terrace at the top of the Dunes, followed by the rest of his party.Down below ran a level road. ""There is the Boulevard,"" said Grandpapa. ""See, child,"" pointing to it; but Phronsie had no eyes for anything but the hundreds and hundreds of Bath chairs dotting the sands.Polly and Jasper, running in and out of the fascinating shops by the Concert terrace, had minds divided by the desire to stay on the sands, and to explore further the tempting interiors. ""We must get something for the boys,"" she declared, jingling her little silver purse; ""just let us go in this one now, then we'll run after Grandpapa; he's going down on the sands.""""He's going to sit with Phronsie in some of those big sunbonnets of yours, Polly,"" said Jasper. ""There they are,"" pointing to them. ""Well, we'll go in this shop. I want to get a pair of those wooden shoes for Joel."" And they hurried in.""Oh, how fine!"" exclaimed Polly. ""Well, I saw a carved bear I think Davie would like, and--"" the rest was lost in the confusing array of tempting things spread out for their choice by deft shopkeepers.When they emerged, Polly had a china windmill, and an inkstand of Delft ware, and several other things, and Jasper carried all the big bundles. ""O dear me,"" said Polly, ""now we must run, or we sha'n't have much time to stay on the beach; and besides, Grandpapa will worry over us if we're not there.""""We can't run much, loaded down with this,"" said Jasper, looking at his armful and laughing, ""or we'd likely drop half of them, and smash them to pieces. Wait a bit, Polly, I'm going to buy you some fruit."" They stopped at the top of the stone stairway leading down to the sands, where some comely peasant women, fishermen's wives, held great baskets of fruit, and in one hand was a pair of scales. ""Now, then, what will you have, Polly?""""I should say they were; they are black Hamburgs,"" declared Jasper. ""Now, then, my good woman, give us a couple of pounds."" He put down the coin she asked for, and she weighed them out in her scales, and did them up in a piece of a Dutch newspaper.""Well, I declare,"" exclaimed old Mr. King, peering out of his Bath chair, ""if you children aren't loaded down!"" He was eating black Hamburg grapes. Phronsie sat opposite him almost lost in the depth of another Bath chair, similarly occupied. And at a little remove was the remainder of the party, and they all were in Bath chairs, and eating black Hamburg grapes."
"""Oh, I don't want to, I really and truly don't, Jasper,"" Polly made haste to cry. ""I like the sand ever and ever so much better. I only want to see for a minute what it's like to be in one of those funny old things. Then I should want to hop out with all my might, I just know I should.""""I'm of your mind,"" said Jasper, coming back to his seat on the sand again. ""They must be very stuffy, Polly. Well, now you are here, would you like to come back to Scheveningen for a few days, Polly?""""I think I should,"" said Polly, slowly, bringing her gaze around over the sea, to the Dunes, the beach, with the crowds of people of all nationalities, and the peasant folk, ""if we could stay just as long, for all that, at the dear old Hague.""""Well, I don't know,"" said Mr. King, peering up and down Phronsie's Bath chair adorned with the most lively descriptions of the merits of cocoa as a food; ""they're all alike as two peas, except for the matter of the chocolate and cocoa trimmings. But perhaps I can fix it, Phronsie, so that you can have this identical one,"" mentally resolving to do that very thing. ""Well, come, Phronsie, we must go now and get our luncheon."" ""Mamsie, have we been here a whole week in Amsterdam,"" cried Polly, leaning out of the window to look up and down the canal where the many-coloured boats lay, ""beside all those days at Scheveningen? I can't believe it!""""Mamsie,""--Polly suddenly drew in her gaze from the charming old canal and its boats, and sprang to Mrs. Fisher's side,--""do you know, I think it was just the loveliest thing in all the world for Grandpapa to bring dear Mr. and Mrs. Henderson abroad with us? I do, Mamsie.""""Mr. King is always doing good, kind things,"" said Mrs. Fisher, coming out of her revery, as Polly threw herself down on the floor and laid her head in her mother's lap, just as she used to do at home. ""I haven't done this for so long,"" she said, ""and it is so good!""""That is the only drawback about travel,"" observed Mother Fisher, her hand passing soothingly over Polly's head, ""that there never seems to be time for the little home ways that are so good. Now we must make the time and keep it, Polly.""""Indeed we will,"" cried Polly, seizing Mamsie's other hand to cuddle it under her chin, ""and I'm going to begin right now. It makes me think of the little brown house, Mamsie, whenever you smooth my hair. What good times we used to have there!""""Oh, but it was fun!"" said Polly, merrily, ""only I didn't like the old stove when it acted badly. But then came my new stove. Mamsie, wasn't Papa Fisher splendid? And then he saved my eyes. Just think, Mamsie, I never can love him half enough. I wish I could do something for him,"" she mourned, just as she did in the old days.""You do, Polly; you are doing something every day of your life,"" said her mother, reassuringly. ""Never think that you don't do anything. Why, it was only this very morning that your father told me that you were his little helper, and that he depended on you to cheer him up."""
"""Did he say that?"" asked Polly, much gratified, poking up her head to look at her mother. ""Oh, I want to be, but I don't know how to help him. Papa Fisher always seems to be doing something for other people, and not to need anybody to do things for him.""""Ah, Polly, when you have lived longer,"" said Mrs. Fisher, ""you will know that those who are doing things always for other people, are the very ones who need cheering up, for they never complain. Your father, in going about as he does, day after day, to the hospitals and everywhere, where he can learn anything that will make him a better doctor, is working very hard indeed, and yet think how cheerful he is when he comes home! And he says you help to keep him so, Polly."" She bent over and set a kiss on Polly's red cheek.""And you'll find just such a time will come; it never fails to when you watch for it,"" said Mother Fisher, wisely. Just then the door opened, and Phronsie, fresh from the hands of Matilda, who had been changing her gown, came in with Araminta in her arms. When she saw Polly on the floor with her head in Mamsie's lap, she got down by her side and curled up there, too.""Mamsie doesn't mind her bothers,"" said Mrs. Fisher, her other hand going softly over Phronsie's yellow hair, at which Phronsie gave a small sigh of content, and wriggled her toes as they were stretched out straight before her on the carpet, ""if only they grow up a little better every day than they were the day before.""""Mrs. Fisher!"" called Grandpapa's voice at the door. Thereupon Polly and Phronsie sprang to their feet, and a lively race ensued to see which should be there the first to open it. The consequence was that both faces met him at once.""Bless me!"" cried old Mr. King, laughing gaily, as the door flew open, and they both rushed into his arms; ""so you did like to have your old Grandfather come to see you,"" he exclaimed, mightily pleased.""Now, you know those three boys of yours are the most splendid boys that ever were in all this world, and they are working away at home, studying and all that, Joel and David are, and Ben is pegging away at business."" Old Mr. King thought best to go to the heart of the matter at once without any dallying.""Hem--well, we don't talk much about those boys,"" observed the old gentleman, ""because it makes us all homesick after them, and it's best that they should be there, and that we should be here, so that was settled once for all by our coming.""""Well, now, the fact of it is,"" continued old Mr. King, still keeping to the main point with wonderful directness, ""I think the time has come for us to act, which is much better than talking, in my opinion; and I want to do something for those boys.""A small howl of delight from Polly broke the silence. When she heard that, Phronsie gave a little crow. ""Oh, Grandpapa!"" exclaimed Polly, ""do you really mean it?"" and she threw her arms around his neck. Phronsie immediately clambered up and did the same thing.""It's just because I couldn't speak at first,"" said Mrs. Fisher, wiping her eyes; and her voice trembled. ""But it's the very thing; and oh! thank you, sir, for thinking of it. The boys won't be so homesick for us when they get the box. And it will be the best thing in the world for us to keep busy, so we can't worry about them."""
"""Go and call him, then,--he's down in the reading room, writing to the boys,--and bring him up here,"" said old Mr. King. ""No, no, Phronsie, you want to stay and take care of me,"" as Phronsie showed signs of slipping down from his lap to go too.So she got down and set Araminta up straight against the sofa back, and then came and clambered up again into his lap. By this time Polly and Jasper, racing along the hall, had reached Mother Fisher's room.""I shouldn't think that idea was a half-bad one,"" said old Mr. King. ""What do you say, Mrs. Fisher? If we are going to send the box, why isn't it best to begin the work at once? There's never so good a time as now, in my opinion. I'm sure you agree with me.""On Mother Fisher saying ""yes,"" all three of the young people took hold of hands, and danced around the room in glee. For old Mr. King set Phronsie down, with, ""There, go, child, and spin with the others; then all hurry and get your hats on, and we'll be off.""And in less time than it takes to write it, old Mr. King and Mother Fisher and Jasper and Polly and Phronsie all hurried out of the hotel, and began a round of the shops to get the things together for the wonderful box to go home to the boys. And though Polly didn't know it, several other things, that boys wouldn't be supposed to care for in the least, were slyly added to the purchases, when she wasn't looking, to be sent home to the hotel in separate parcels to Mr. King. For Polly was going to have a birthday before very long; though she had quite forgotten it in the excitement over this box for Ben and Joel and David.""It's just like buying things for Christmas, isn't it, Jasper?"" said Polly, as they hung over the show-cases and peered into windows; ""only everything is so funny here. Oh, no, Phronsie, that won't do; it's too big,"" as Phronsie protested that nothing was so nice as a huge Delft plate hanging on the wall. There was a big windmill and several little windmills in the distance along a Dutch canal, and two or three cows in the foreground, and a peasant girl with a basket in her hand. Phronsie stood and gazed at it all the time they were in this particular shop.""I like that little girl,"" she said, ""and those cows; and they are like Deacon Blodgett's cows at home in Badgertown. And Ben would like it, and Joel, and David."" And all Polly could do, she would still say, ""I like it, Polly, and I want Grandpapa to send it.""""Well, I think we would better not try to get her away from the idea,"" said Jasper, with a look at the rapt little face. Phronsie was now kneeling on a Flemish oak chair, and studying the Delft plate with absorbed attention.""No,"" said Polly, with a sigh, ""I suppose it isn't any use to try when she looks like that."" Just then old Mr. King, who had been busy in a farther corner with the proprietor of the shop, picking out some small articles that struck his fancy, turned and called Phronsie. She didn't hear him, being too absorbed. And so he laid down the little silver paper-cutter he was looking at, and came over to see what was the matter.""Dear me! You think they would like it, Phronsie?"" he asked doubtfully, and just on the point of saying, like Polly, ""it's too big, child,"" when he stopped himself and finished up--""and so it pleases you, Phronsie?"""
"""He is going to send it,"" Jasper and Polly said to each other, peering round an angle in the shop at the two. ""Well, it's a mercy it's got a cow on it instead of a cat,"" said Jasper. ""How Joel would howl if Phronsie sent him the picture of a cat!"" Well, the box that went home across the seas to the Pepper boys was a marvel, stuffed in every nook and cranny where there was a possibility that the tiniest parcel could be tucked, until Phronsie, who kept bringing up more bundles, had to be told by Polly and Jasper, who did the packing, that no more could go in.""So you've said for the last hour, Phronsie,"" exclaimed Polly, in despair, and sitting quite straight, her hands in her lap. ""Jasper, what _shall_ we do?"" He was over by the window laying out the long nails that were to fasten the cover on; for no one must touch this precious box, but the loving hands that got it ready.""Oh, we can't,"" began Jasper. Then he turned and saw Phronsie's face. ""Perhaps one might be crowded in,"" he added, with a look at Polly. ""Which one would you rather have Polly make a try at, Phronsie?""""No, only a bit tired, I think,"" answered Jasper. ""Well, now, Phronsie, I think there is just room enough to tuck that parcel in this corner,"" said Jasper, crowding his fingers down in between the various bundles to make a space. ""There, in it pops!"" suiting the action to the word.Well, the box was off, at last, the Pepper children and Jasper seeing it till the very last minute. And old Mr. King was nearly as excited as the young folks, and the Parson and Mrs. Henderson said it reminded them of Christmas times over again, and Mother Fisher and the little doctor were in a great state of happiness.And that night when Polly was in bed, and Mother Fisher came into her room and Phronsie's, which opened into her own, to say ""Good night,"" Polly turned on her pillow. ""Mamsie,"" she said, ""I do so very much wish that we could send a box to the Henderson boys. They must be so homesick for their mother and father.""""You see,"" said Polly, rolling over to get hold of one of Mother Fisher's hands, and speaking very fast, ""of course the Henderson boys are having a good time at dear Deacon Blodgett's, but then their mother and father are away off. Oh, Mamsie!"" She reached over and threw both arms around her mother and hugged her tightly.""I really think it can be done,"" said Mrs. Fisher, ""but I must ask your father first. And now, daughter, go to sleep, like Phronsie."" She glanced over at the other little bed, where Phronsie's yellow head was lost in dreams.As Mother Fisher had said, they were going to the Island of Marken to-morrow; and Polly tumbled asleep with her head full of all the strange things they were to see there, and that Jasper and she had been reading about,--how the people wore the same kind of funny costume that their great-great-ever-so-many-times great-grandfathers and grandmothers had worn; and how the houses were of different colours, and built in different layers or mounds of land, with cunning little windows and scarcely any stairs; and how they were going in the haying season when everybody would be out raking up and gleaning--and--and--Polly was completely lost in her happy dreams.Somebody seemed to be pulling her arm. What! Oh, she remembered they were going to Marken, and she must hurry and get her bath and fly into her clothes. ""Yes, Mamsie!"" she cried, flying up to sit straight in the bed. ""I'll get right up and dress; oh, won't we have fun!"""
"""Polly,"" said Mother Fisher. She had on a dressing-gown, and her black hair was hanging down her back. She looked pale and worried; Polly could see that, although she blinked at the sudden light. ""It isn't morning, but the middle of the night. You must get up this minute. Pull on your shoes; don't stop for stockings, and slip into your wrapper. Don't ask questions,"" as Polly's lips moved.Polly obeyed with an awful feeling at her heart. She glanced at Phronsie's little bed; she was not there! Mrs. Fisher threw the pink wrapper over her head; Polly thrust her arms into the sleeves, feeling as if she were sinking way down. ""Now come."" And Mamsie seized her hand and hurried her through her own room without another word. It was empty. Father Fisher and Phronsie were nowhere to be seen. And now for the first time Polly was conscious of a great noise out in the corridor. It seemed to spread and fasten itself to a number of other noises, and something made Polly feel queerly in her throat as if she should choke. She looked up in her mother's eyes, as they sped through the room.""Oh, Mamsie, not this way; we must find the stairs."" But Mrs. Fisher held her with firmer fingers than ever, and they turned into a narrower hall, up toward a blinking red light that sent a small bright spark out through the thick smoke, and in a minute, or very much less, they were out on the fire-escape, and looking down to hear--for they couldn't see--Jasper's voice calling from below, ""We are all here, Polly,"" and ""Be careful, wife, how you come down,"" from Dr. Fisher.""We are here, dear child,"" said the parson's wife, pressing forward, and then the crowd surged up against them this way and that, and more people came down the fire-escape, and some were screaming and saying they had lost everything, and they must go back for their jewels, and one woman brought down a big feather pillow, and set it carefully on the grass, she was so crazed with fright.Polly remembered her face as she flashed by. She sat at the next table to theirs in the dining room, with a slender, gentle, little old lady whom she called ""Grandmamma."" ""O dear!"" groaned Polly, ""we _must_ help her!""Jasper dashed after the girl, and Polly ran, too. He laid his hand on the arm of the flying figure as she broke through the crowd, but she shook him off like a feather. ""She's up there,"" pointing above, ""and I must get her.""One of the firemen seized her and held her fast. Jasper sprang for the fire-escape. ""_Jasper!_"" called Polly, hoarsely, ""it will kill Grandpapa if you go--oh!"" She turned at a cry from the girl, whose arms were around a bent, shaking, little figure, and they had both sunk to the ground."
"""I brought her down long ago,"" said another fireman, who could speak English, pointing to the white-haired old lady, who, on hearing her granddaughter's voice, had pushed her way through the crowd, as Dr. Fisher hurried up.And then Mr. King and his party gathered his group, and they hurried to another hotel close by, Jasper and Mr. Henderson and Mother Fisher waiting to see to the belongings of the party; for the fire was now subdued, although the guests had to go elsewhere for shelter, and the little doctor was in his element, taking care of the old lady, and then he rushed off to look after a score or more of other fainting women.But nobody was really hurt--the smoke and the panic had been the worst, only the poor thing who had dragged down the feather pillow sat by it till the little doctor, discovering her, called two stout men, who took her up in their arms--she screaming all the while for her treasure--and bore her to a neighbouring house that kindly opened its doors to some of the people so suddenly thrown out of shelter. And it wasn't till near breakfast time that the little doctor came to the hotel that was now their home.""Brain-fever patient,"" he said briefly. ""Wife, I must get a cold plunge, or I'll be having it next."" And when breakfast was really set before their party, he appeared with the others fresh from his bath, and as cheery as if nothing had happened to break his good night's rest.""O dear me! How did you ever get so many things over here, in all this world, and why didn't you let me stay with you?"" Polly had exclaimed in one breath, looking at the array of dresses, sacks, and hats disposed around the room. And Mamsie was kneeling before an open trunk to take out more.""It wasn't best, Polly,"" said her mother, who had longed for Polly as no one knew better than did Mother Fisher herself. ""You were really needed here with Grandpapa and Phronsie. You truly were, my dear.""""No, Mamsie, I really didn't think you could,"" answered Polly, quickly, and running to her, little silk flag and all, to throw her arms around her neck, ""only it's so good to see the dear thing again.""""You may take the things from me, and hang them up somewhere,"" said her mother; ""that will help me the most,"" giving her an armful. ""I don't see how you ever thought of so many things, Mamsie!"" exclaimed Polly going off with her armful.""Oh, Jasper helped me pack them, and then he got the hotel porter to bring over the trunks,"" answered Mother Fisher, her head in the trunk. ""I've locked up our rooms, and got the keys, so I can get the rest by and by.""""But how did you first hear of the fire?"" asked Polly, when they were all finally seated around the breakfast table, little Mrs. Gray--for so the white-haired old lady was called--and her granddaughter Adela being invited to join, ""do tell me, Mamsie, I don't understand,"" she added in a puzzled way.""Marken?"" repeated old Mr. King, looking up from the egg he was carefully breaking for Phronsie so that she might eat it from the shell. ""So we were going there this morning. Well, we won't see that island now for a good many days; at least, till we get over this fright. Beside, we have things to settle here, and to get comfortably fixed. But we'll have that excursion all in good time, never fear.""""Somebody made a good deal of noise down in the corridor,"" said Mother Fisher, ""and your father went out to see what was the matter, and then he came back and told me what to do, and he took Phronsie and went for old Mr. King. But he had sent a porter to warn them in 165, and they would tell the Hendersons in the next room, before he ran upstairs to me."" It was a long speech for Mother Fisher."
"""Mamsie,"" asked Polly, suddenly, after she had leaned across her mother and beamed at the little doctor, which so delighted him that his big spectacles nearly fell off in his plate, ""how _did_ you know where the fire-escape was?""""Oh, that was your father's doings, too,"" said Mother Fisher. She couldn't help but show her pride. ""He told me all about it the first day we got to the hotel. He always does; he says it's better to know these things.""""I can't help it! I really must!"" exclaimed Polly, hopping out of her chair,--there were no other people in the breakfast room beside their party, so really it wasn't so very dreadful after all,--and she ran back of her mother's chair, and threw her arms around the little doctor's neck. ""Oh, Papa Fisher,"" she cried, setting ever so many kisses on his cheeks under the big spectacles, ""you've saved all our lives."" And Polly never knew about a certain shelf in Grandpapa's closet, nor how full it was getting, when Jasper ran every now and then to add the gifts as fast as the different members of the party picked up pretty things in the shops for the coming birthday--now very near. And she actually forgot all about the birthday itself; all her mind being set on the Henderson box, so soon to sail off over the sea.And Mother Fisher would look over at her absorbed face, and smile, to watch her in the shops, picking out things for the Henderson boys; and old Mr. King would send many a keen glance at her, and Jasper had hard work not to exclaim, ""Oh, Polly, father has got you a--"" And then he'd pull himself up, and rush off into some great plan to buy Peletiah Henderson something that a Badgertown boy ought to have. And Phronsie was carefully guarded on all sides these days, lest she should let out the great secret, for, of course, she ought to be in the very centre of all these preparations to celebrate Polly's birthday in Old Amsterdam, so she knew everything just as soon as it was planned. But sometimes, with all this care, the whole thing nearly popped out.""Mr. King!"" It was Mother Fisher who called after him, and her voice didn't sound like hers, for it had an excited little ring. ""Oh, are you going out?"" for she didn't see that he held his hat in his hand till he turned in the corridor.""I can wait just as well if it's anything you want, Mrs. Fisher,"" he said gladly, controlling his surprise at her unusual manner. ""I was only about to run down to the Kalver-straat for a little matter I just thought of for the birthday. Can I do anything for you?"" he begged.""Yes, it's just that,"" said Mrs. Fisher, hurriedly; ""it's about the birthday--I must speak quickly--I've just found out,--"" she glanced up and down the corridor as if fully expecting to see Polly dash around a corner,--""that Adela Gray's birthday is to-morrow--""""The dickens! You don't say so!"" exploded Mr. King. ""Well, now, I call that very clever on your part to have found it out. Very clever indeed, Mrs. Fisher,"" he repeated, beaming at her. ""And just in time, for it would have been a dreadful thing, indeed, to have had that poor little girl left out, and her birthday too! Dear me!"""
"""And we might as well have had no celebration in such a case, for Polly wouldn't have enjoyed a single bit of it--not an atom!"" declared old Mr. King, bringing his walking stick heavily down on the floor.""Polly,"" Mrs. Fisher looked into the brown eyes with a steady glance, and all the hurry was gone out of her voice, ""your father is all right. And now, run away, you and Jasper."" She looked over Polly's shoulder at him as she spoke. ""No, not another word, child."" And away Mrs. Fisher hurried, while old Mr. King slipped off in the opposite direction.""Polly,"" said Jasper, desperately, ""I really think we ought to fix our stamp books. I really do,"" and he took her hand. ""My stamps are all in heaps in the envelopes, and in a mess generally. Come, let's begin now--do."" And he led her back down the corridor.And that afternoon, there was another narrow escape, when it seemed as if the secret really must pop out. Polly, rushing along to the reading room opposite the big dining room, saw Mother Fisher in consultation with the head waiter, and he was saying ""cake,"" and then he stopped suddenly, and Mrs. Fisher turned and saw her. And Mamsie came across the hall, and into the reading room, and sat there a bit, while Polly tossed off a letter to Alexia Rhys, that had been worrying her for days. And there was a funny little smile tucked away in the corners of Mother Fisher's mouth, and Polly thought that things were getting queerer than ever.""I am glad you are writing that letter,"" said Mrs. Fisher, with an approving smile that chased the funny little one all around the strongly curved mouth, ""for Alexia will feel badly not to hear often from you, Polly.""""Take care, Polly,"" warned her mother; ""a carelessly written letter is no compliment, and it gets you in a bad way. Don't hurry so, child,"" as Polly's pen went scratching across the paper at a fearful rate.""But there are so many letters to write to all the girls,"" said Polly, stopping a minute to look at her mother, ""and I've only just got all the letters in my steamer mail-bag answered. I _must_ write to Cathie and Philena, and Amy Garrett too, to-day, Mamsie,"" she added, in distress.""No, Polly, I really didn't,"" Mrs. Fisher made haste to assure her. ""Well, now, mother will tell you what will be the best way for you to do. Write as good a letter as you can to Alexia, and tell her to send it around to all the girls, for a kind of a bulletin, and--""""Oh, Mamsie Fisher,"" cried Polly, not stopping to hear the rest, but deserting the writing table to run and throw her arms around her mother's neck, ""you're the bestest, dearest mother in all this world--oh--oh! Now I sha'n't have but one letter to write! How fine!""""And you must write that one letter very nicely, Polly, and take ever so much pains with it,"" said Mother Fisher, her black eyes shining at the happy solution; ""and that is much better than to hurry off a good many slovenly ones. Besides, it is not well to take your time and strength for too much letter writing, for there are the boys, and Mrs. Whitney and--""""I shall tear this one up,"" declared Polly, running back to get into her chair again. ""O dear me, what a horrible old scrawl,"" she cried, with a very red face. ""I didn't know it did look so bad"" And she tore it clear across the page, and then snipped it into very little bits."
"So Polly took a fresh sheet and set to work; and Mrs. Fisher, seeing her so busily occupied, soon stole out. And there was the head waiter waiting for her in the dining room, and Polly never heard a word they said, although ""cake"" was mentioned a great many times, and several other things too.But the next morning Polly Pepper woke up to the fact that it was her birthday. For there was Mamsie leaning over her pillow, the first thing she saw the minute her eyes were opened. And Phronsie was sitting on the end of the bed with her hands folded in her lap.""You're fifteen,"" repeated Mother Fisher, setting the last little kiss on Polly's cheek,--""and it's the best thing you could possibly do, to sleep over, child. Now, then, Phronsie, let us help her to get dressed.""Wasn't there a merry time, though, for the next half-hour, till Polly had had her bath, and was arrayed, Mother Fisher and Phronsie here, there, and everywhere, helping to tie and to hook Polly's clothes--Phronsie bringing her little silver button-hook that Auntie Whitney gave her, declaring that she should button Polly's boots.So Polly sat down in the low chair, and put out her foot, feeling very queer indeed, and as if she ought to be doing up Phronsie's boots instead. And Phronsie curled up on the floor, and patiently drew every one of the buttons into place, and buttoned them fast. And then on with the other boot.""So you did, Pet,"" cried Polly, sticking out both feet to look at them. ""You buttoned every single one of those buttons up splendidly, Phronsie Pepper. Now my toes will be just as happy all day; oh, you can't think how happy they'll be."" And she seized her, half smothering her with kisses.""Polly will wear a white gown to-night,"" said Mother Fisher, her eyes shining, and the same funny little smile hiding in the corners of her mouth; ""but this morning she would better put on her blue gingham.""""Yes, that's best,"" said Polly, reassuringly, running off to get it out of the big bureau drawer. ""It's all done up spick and span,"" drawing it out. ""Mamsie, don't these Dutch women do up things well, though?""""I used to get them all mussed up just as soon as could be,"" mourned Polly, her cheeks rosy at the remembrance. ""Mamsie, how much trouble I've made you."" She stopped dressing, and sprang over to Mrs. Fisher. Phronsie, trying to button on the waistband, and clinging to it, went stumbling after.""So he shall, old button fly into his hole,"" laughed Phronsie through her tears. And presently she declared it was done. And with a final pat, this time from Mother Fisher's fingers, Polly was released, and the rest of the dressing was soon done.And there, waiting at the end of their corridor, was Jasper, in every conceivable way trying to get the better of his impatience. When he did finally see Polly, he dashed up to her. ""Well, are you really here?""""You needn't be; not a bit of it,"" declared Grandpapa, holding her off at arm's length to scan her rosy face; ""the best thing you could possibly do""--Mamsie's very words. So Polly felt relieved at once. ""And now we will wait for Mrs. Fisher,"" he added, with a glance at the door."
"""Yes, here she is,"" repeated old Mr. King, in great satisfaction, holding Polly fast. ""Well, now, Mrs. Fisher, that you have come, we'll begin our festivities. Our Polly, here, is fifteen years old to-day--only think of that!"" Still he held her fast, and bent his courtly white head to kiss her brown hair.Polly clung to his other hand. ""It can't be a house celebration, Polly, my dear, with a party and all that, but we'll do the best we can. And to add to our pleasure, and to be company for you"" (not a suggestion of the pleasure he was to give), ""why, we've another little girl with us who has chosen this very day for her birthday, too. Adela, come here.""Adela Gray, who had been standing silently, looking on with a sad heart at finding herself with a birthday on her hands, and no one to celebrate it with her, though for that matter all her birthdays had been rather dismal affairs at the best, in the Paris school, now shrank back at Mr. King's sudden summons, and hid behind her grandmother's black gown.And everybody said, ""How fine!"" And they all were smiling at her. And Adela found herself, before she knew it, coming up out of her old despair into brightness and warmth and joy. And she never knew when old Mr. King proclaimed her fourteen years old, and dropped a kiss--yes, he actually did--on her head. And then she found herself on his other side, by the big centre table, that was covered with a large cloth. And Polly made her put her hand under it first, saying, ""Oh, no, Grandpapa, please let Adela pull out the first parcel."" And lo, and behold--she held a neat little white-papered bundle tied with a blue ribbon.""Open it,"" cried Jasper, as she stood stupidly staring at it, in her hand. ""Don't you see it's got your name on it?"" But Adela didn't see anything, she was so dazed. So Jasper had to open it for her. ""We may thank our stars the first parcel happened to be for her,"" he was thinking busily all the time he was untying the ribbon. And there was just what she had wanted for, oh, so long--Mrs. Jameson's little books on Art--her very own, she saw as soon as her trembling fingers opened the cover.After that, the skies might rain down anything in the shape of gifts, as it seemed to be doing for Polly and for her; it didn't matter to Adela; and she found herself, finally, looking over a heap of white papers and tangled ribbons, at Polly Pepper, who was dancing about, and thanking everybody to right and to left.""Let her alone,"" said old Mr. King, hearing her. ""She's thanked me enough. Now then, to breakfast, all of us! Come, Polly--come, Adela--Jasper, you take Mrs. Gray,"" and the others falling in, away they all went down to the big dining room, to their own special table in the centre.""I do so love what Joey sent me, and Ben and Davie,"" breathed Polly, for about the fiftieth time, patting her little money-bag which she had hung on her belt. Then she looked at the new ring on her finger very lovingly, and the other hand stole up to pinch the pin on her trim necktie, and see if it were really there. ""Oh, Jasper, if the boys were only here!"" she whispered, under cover of the chatter and bustle around the table."
"All that wonderful day the sun seemed to shine more brightly than on any other day in the whole long year. And the two girls who had the birthday together, went here and there, arm in arm, to gladden all the tired, and often discontented, eyes of the fellow-travellers they chanced to meet. And when finally it came to the dusk, and Polly and Adela were obliged to say, ""Our birthday is almost all over,"" why then, that was just the very time when Mother Fisher and the little doctor (for he was in the plan, you may be very sure, only he wanted her to make all the arrangements, ""It's more in a woman's way, my dear,"" he had said),--well, then, that was their turn to celebrate the double birthday!""Where are those girls?"" cried the little doctor, fidgeting about, and knocking down a little table in his prancing across the room. Jasper ran and picked it up. ""No harm done,"" he declared, setting the books straight again.""I should say so,"" declared the little doctor; ""still, I'm sorry I floored these,"" with a rueful hand on the books. ""I'd rather smash some other things that I know of than to hurt the feelings of a book. Dear me!""When he saw that this was so, the little doctor began to fidget again, and to wonder where the girls were, and in his impatience he was on the point of prancing off once more across the room, when Jasper said, ""Let us go and find them--you and I.""""Here--where are you two going?"" called Mr. King after them. And this hindered them so that Polly and Adela ran in unnoticed. And there they were on time after all; for it turned out that the little doctor's watch was five minutes ahead.Well, and then they all filed into the big dining room, and there, to be sure, was their special table in the centre, and in the middle of it was a tall Dutch cake, ornamented with all sorts of nuts and fruits and candies, and gay with layers of frosting, edged and trimmed with coloured devices, and on the very tip-top of all was an elaborate figure in sugar of a little Dutch shepherdess. And around this wonderful cake were plates of mottoes, all trimmed in the Dutch fashion--in pink and green and yellow--while two big bunches of posies, lay one at each plate, of the two girls who had a birthday together in Old Amsterdam.""Which means that pretty much the whole business was hers,"" added the little doctor, possessing himself of her hand under cover of the table. ""Well, girls, if you like your birthday party fixings, that's all your mother and I ask. It's Dutch, anyway, and what you won't be likely to get at home; there's so much to be said for it."" And as Mother Fisher observed, they would all enjoy Marken better for the delay, for there would be more time to anticipate the pleasure; and then there was the Henderson box to get ready, for Grandpapa King had not only approved the plan; he had welcomed the idea most heartily. ""It will be a good diversion from our scare,"" he said, when Polly and Jasper laid it before him.""And give us all something to do,"" he added, ""so go ahead, children, and set to work on it."" And Polly and Jasper had flown off with the good news, and every one did ""set to work"" as Grandpapa said, diving into the shops again.Phronsie tried to find the mate to her china cat, that was by this time sailing over the sea to Joel; and it worried her dreadfully, for, try as she would, she never could see another one. And she looked so pale and tired one night that Mr. King asked her, in consternation, as they were all assembled in one corner of the drawing-room, what was the matter.""I wish I could find a cat,"" sighed Phronsie, trying not to be so tired, and wishing the prickles wouldn't run up and down her legs so. ""We've walked and walked, Grandpapa, and the shop wouldn't come, where it must be.""""Oh, that settles it,"" declared Adela, quite joyful that she could help the little Pepper girl in any way, ""at least the pink ribbon round its neck does, for I know where there is a cat exactly like that--that is, the one I saw had green eyes, but everything else is like it--it's sitting upon a shelf in a shop where I was just this very day, Phronsie Pepper.""""To be sure I will,"" promised Adela, just as happy as Phronsie; ""we will go in the morning right after breakfast. May we, Mrs. Fisher?"" looking over to her, where she sat knitting as cosily as if she were in the library at home. ""For I think people who travel, get out of their everyday habits,"" she had said to her husband, before they started, ""and I'm going to pack my knitting basket to keep my hands out of mischief."""
"And old Mr. King had smiled more than once in satisfaction to glance over at Mother Fisher in her cosey corner of an evening, and it made him feel at home immediately, even in the dreariest of hotel parlours, just the very sight of those knitting needles.And so, in between the picture galleries and museums, to which some part of every day was devoted, the Peppers and Jasper and Adela, and old Mr. King, who always went, and Mother Fisher, who sometimes was of the party, the ransacking of the lovely shops took place. And it really seemed as if everything that the Henderson boys could possibly want, was in some of those places--no matter how out-of-the-way--and waiting to be bought to fly over the sea to Badgertown. At last off that box went. Then Polly was quite happy, and could enjoy things all the more, with a mind at rest.""Now we are all ready for Marken,"" she cried that night, after dinner, when the box was on its way to the steamer, ""and I do hope we are going to-morrow."" Jasper and she had a little table between them, and they were having a game of chess.""Oh, how fine!"" exclaimed Polly, unguardedly moving the pawn that held at bay a big white bishop, who immediately swooped down on her queen, and away it went off the board; and ""oh, how perfectly dreadful!"" all in one and the same breath.""What is going over in that corner?"" called Grandpapa's voice, by the big reading table. He had finished his newspaper, and was now ready to talk. So Jasper and Polly explained, and that brought out the subject of Marken, and old Mr. King said yes, it was perfectly true that he had made all the arrangements to go the following day if the weather were fine. So Polly and Jasper swept off the remaining pieces on the chessboard, and packed them away in their box, and ran over to hear all the rest of it that he was now telling to the family.The next day was fine enough to warrant the trip, though not absolutely sunshiny. Old Mr. King wisely deciding that the fun of the expedition would lose its edge if postponed again, said, ""Start!"" So after breakfast they all went down to the Wester dock and embarked on the little steamer bound for the island of Marken in the Zuyder Zee.Polly leaned over the rail and drew in long breaths of delight. ""Come, Adela,"" she called, ""here is a good place;"" for the little old lady was still too much shaken up to make much attempt at travelling, so Polly had begged Mother Fisher and Grandpapa to ask Adela to come with them on their sightseeing trips.Adela ran and kneeled down on the seat by Polly's side and hung over the rail too. ""Don't the houses lean over queerly?"" she said, pointing to the long narrow buildings they were leaving behind. ""They look worse from the water than when we are in the midst of them.""""That's because the city is built on piles, I suppose,"" said Jasper. ""It's mostly sand in Holland, you know, particularly around Amsterdam, and so they had to drive down piles to get something strong enough to put their houses on. That's what--who was it?--oh I know--Erasmus--meant when he said, 'I know a city whose inhabitants dwell on the tops of the trees like rooks.'""""And I think they're ever so much prettier leaning every which way,"" declared Polly. ""We can see plenty of straight houses at home, so it's nice to see crooked ones over here. Oh, Jasper, there's the King's palace!"""
"""Now that's too bad!"" exclaimed Polly in sympathy. Then she turned back uncomfortably, and began to talk of something else. ""I'm not going to,"" she said to herself; ""it isn't my fault she forgot her kodak, and I want every one of my films myself. And I care a great deal more for Marken than for almost any other place."" The next moment Mamsie seemed to say, ""Is that my Polly?"" and although she was at the other end of the boat, Polly's head drooped as if she had heard the words.""I'll divide with you, Polly,"" said Jasper. ""I brought ever so many, and will go shares with my kodak, too."" But Polly made up her mind that Jasper's kodak was to be used for his own special pictures, for she knew he had set his heart on taking certain ones, and a good many of them, too.""The little brown house,"" answered Polly, and her eyes lightened as she seemed to see it before her. ""That's where we used to live, Adela--oh, the sweetest place, you can't think!"" Polly's fingers stopped drumming now, and the colour flew up to her cheek; she forgot all about Adela.""Yes, and we had beautiful plays under it,"" cried Polly, rushing on in remembrance; ""and sometimes when all the work was finished, Mamsie would let us spend the whole afternoon out there. You can't think what perfectly splendid times we had there, Adela Gray!""Adela by this time was beyond words, but stared up at Polly's face speechlessly. ""And what fun it was on baking days, Polly,"" cried Jasper, unable to keep quiet any longer; ""do you remember when I burnt all my cakes around the edges?""""There was a girl coming out of the door of one of them,"" announced Phronsie, climbing up on the seat and putting her arm around Polly's neck. ""Polly, I'd like to live in a windmill; I would,"" she whispered close to her ear. ""Oh, Polly, see the cunning little doll-houses!"" exclaimed Phronsie in a little scream, flying about from Grandpapa at the head of his party on their way up from the boat-landing, and then back to the rear of the procession, which happened to be Polly and Jasper.""It seems almost too bad to step on such clean roads,"" said Polly, getting up on her tiptoes, and stepping gingerly off. When Phronsie saw Polly do that, she got up on her tiptoes too, and tried to get over the ground with her.""I suppose they will,"" said Polly, with a sigh of relief, coming down on to the rest of her feet, which proceeding, Phronsie was very glad to copy. ""And it isn't as nice as it looks to walk on the tips of your toes. Jasper, do see those cunning little windows and those china images inside!""""It seems as if they were all windows,"" said Jasper, scanning the tiny panes shining at them from all the cottages. ""Dear me, the Broek women have something to do, don't they, to keep everything so shiny and clean?""""Jasper, do you suppose the children can have a good time here?"" pursued Polly, anxiously, willing to give up the mud pies, if only reassured on the latter point, which seemed to her a very doubtful one."
"And so he was calling her, as he and the parson had now reached the dairy door, under cover with the dwelling, which seemed much less an object of painstaking care than the house where the cows resided and the cheeses were made.But everything was as neat as a pin in the house, though, and Polly and Jasper concluded they would explore the two rooms, as everybody seemed to be expected to do, after the main object of the visit was accomplished and the dairy inspected.""Dear me,"" Mrs. Fisher was saying, ""if they haven't a carpet on the floor for the cows to walk on!"" And there, surely, were strips of carpeting all down the walks between the rows of stalls, and something that looked like braided hemp in the bottom of the stalls themselves. And everything was tiled where it could be, with little tiles, and all these and every bit of the woodwork itself shone beautifully--it was so clean and polished.""Come, Polly, let us go into the cheese room,"" suggested Jasper, peering in, for everything was connected and under one roof. ""There's a man in there, and he is telling something;"" so they skipped in, while Phronsie was bewailing that there were no cows there, and where were they?This was so much a work of time, Phronsie laying aside one selection after another, each yellow cheese looking so much better on comparison, that at last old Mr. King was almost in despair, and counselled the purchase of the last one that Phronsie set her eyes on. But meantime she had spied one on the upper shelf of all.""Indeed it is,"" assented Grandpapa, and he had the man lift it down and do it up; a piece of a Dutch newspaper again doing duty, when Phronsie held out her arms to receive it. ""You can't carry it, child; give it to me. What in the world shall we do with the thing?"" all this Grandpapa was uttering in one breath.Grandpapa, who had taken the round parcel from her arms, looked from it to her with increasing perplexity. ""Have the goodness to put a string around it, will you?"" he said to the man who was regarding him stolidly, after satisfying himself that the coin Phronsie had drawn out of her purse and put in his hand was a good one.""Yah, yah,"" said the man, and he brought out of one of his pockets a long piece of thick twine. This with much hard breathing accompanying the work, he proceeded to twist and interlace around the paper containing the little yellow cheese in such a way that when it was completed, Phronsie was carrying what looked like a little net basket, for there was a good strong twine handle sticking up, into which she put her small hand in great satisfaction.When they all gathered in the living room of the house that had open doors into the cow-house and dairy, all being under one roof, they found a huge pile of photographs displayed of various views of the premises indoors and out.""Oh, Polly, didn't you get more than that?"" said Jasper, quite disappointed for her, for Polly dearly loved to take photographs. ""Oh, you've let Adela Gray take your kodak,"" he added; ""it's a shame I didn't give you mine. Take it now, Polly,"" he begged, slinging off the leather strap from his shoulder.""No, no,"" said Polly, ""I don't want to, Jasper, and I wanted Adela to take it, and don't let her hear us, she may come back from the other room;""--for Adela had disappeared with the kodak; ""and it's all right, Jasper,"" she finished up incoherently.""The idea of sleeping in one of them!"" exclaimed Mrs. Fisher, inspecting the interior with a sharp eye. ""They're clean enough and as neat as a pink""--with a critical glance along the white lace spread and the immaculate pillow--""but to be shut up in a box like that. I should as soon go to bed in a bureau drawer.""""There are a good many kinds and sorts of Dutch beds, I suppose,"" observed Mrs. Fisher, turning away, ""just as there are a good many American ones; but I hope there aren't many of this particular kind.""When Phronsie heard that, she was equally distressed, and at once decided to present the gift then instead of carrying it back to the hotel for Polly as she had at first intended. So she cast her burden into Polly's hands and piped out, ""It's for you, Polly, a sweet little yellow cheese; you said you wanted it,"" and stood smiling and triumphant."
"When the boat was nearing the island of Marken, the little yellow cheese had been presented with all due formality to one of the sailors who had been specially kind in the matter of securing good seats for Mr. King's party, Polly and Phronsie having held a whispered conference in a retired nook, to come out of it bright and smiling.""And now it has made two people happy, Phronsie,"" Polly had said, when the presentation was well over, and she ended up with a kiss. ""It made me happy in the first place because you thought of me, and then, just think, Pet, that poor sailor, how glad he will be to take it home.""To be sure, there he was on the other side of the boat nearest Marken, with a big group of passengers, intently watching the Marken children running along in their clacking sabots, on the high bank, and holding out their arms, singing something all the while in a shrill, high key.Whiz--spin--went the coins, to fall into the thick stubby grass on the bank. The children, stopping their song in mid-air, scrambled and sprawled all over each other in their efforts to secure the coveted money. So Jasper and Polly threw the bits next time in the other direction. Then there was a shout and a rush, and the same thing was repeated till only a tangle of arms and legs could be seen. But some one of them always got the money.""Look out, Phronsie!"" exclaimed Jasper. ""Your stuivers went into the water. Here, I'll hold you up, then you can throw it farther. There you go,"" swinging her to his shoulder. ""Now, then""--he guided her hand, and away spun the coin.""To be sure,"" said Jasper. ""Well, we must give her some, and that's a fact."" The small girl kept on at a dog-trot along the bank, her eyes fixed on the wonderful people who tossed out such magic wealth, and holding out her arms and singing her shrill song. But when the money was thrown, she was always a bit too late, and the other children, scrambling and scuffling, had pounced upon it, and had made off with it.Polly was already going through the motions of holding up an imaginary apron. And at last the little girl understood by gestures what she could not possibly get into her head by words, so she picked up the skirt of her gown in her sturdy little fists, and one, two, three clinking coins fell safely into it. But the boys racing along in advance soon discovered this successful trick, and completely swarmed around her, howling dreadfully, so she hastened off, happy in her prize, which she huddled up in her gown as she ran.""Isn't this just richness?"" exclaimed Polly, gazing all about her in an ecstasy. ""Oh, Jasper, what pictures we'll take--and do see that woman's cap! and those pot-hooks of hair over her eyes, and that funny, long dangling curl!""""Yes, yes,"" said Polly, ""I'd rather you did first; I truly had, Adela."" She ran after her, for Adela had retreated down the bank, and made as if she were going to follow the party. ""Now, Adela, be good and listen to reason.""So Polly roused out of her dejection and set to work, and presently the hay-makers, and the Marken boys and girls, the funny little houses that looked as if they dropped down pellmell from the clouds and settled where they had dropped--the high ridges along which the men and boys, walking in their full baggy trousers, looked as if they were blown up, and formed a Dutch perspective perfectly awful--all these queer, delightful things were presently imprisoned in the two kodaks."
"""Oh, one more! I must get a good picture of those girls raking hay."" Polly ran off a few steps and sat down on a log to focus. The Marken girls happened to look up, and immediately whirled around and presented their backs to her.""Not so good as that,"" said Polly, sorrowfully. ""Well, it can't be helped."" So she was just going to get up from her log, when the girls, thinking from her attitude that she had given up the idea of taking a picture of them, turned back to their work. As quick as a flash Polly focussed again, and was just touching the button, when a hand came in front of her kodak, and she saw the grinning face of a Marken girl under its pot-hook of hair and with the long, dangling curl on one side, close to her own.""Yes, and I took a picture of the saucy girl while she was trying to stop yours,"" said Jasper. ""So she didn't do much harm, after all. Oh, here is a splendid group! See them standing by that old tumble-down house, Polly,"" he added excitedly.""Well, I had then, but I've begun again,"" said Jasper, recklessly. He walked up to the group and held out his hand, then pointed to his kodak. They smiled and nodded, showing all their teeth, and the mother took the littlest baby, for there seemed to be a very generous number of the smaller members of the family, and sat down with it in her lap on the rickety step. Then they all drew up stiff as sticks, and didn't even wink.""Oh, Polly, I'm so very glad you've come,"" said Phronsie, as Polly and Jasper ran up to a doorway through which they could see their party. Phronsie stood just inside, and appeared to be watching for them. ""There's a woman here who's been showing us things."" There was Mrs. Fisher up by the tiny window, bending over an old woman who had spread out in her lap some white embroidered garments, while a young woman hovered near, smiling and blushing, and very happy at all this notice. And the rest of the party crowded up as close as they could.""They are her daughter's wedding clothes,"" said Mrs. Fisher, ""I do believe."" For, the old woman was working fearfully hard to make them understand, and pointing first to the white garments and then to the young woman. ""Wedding clothes?"" asked Mrs. Fisher, speaking very slowly.The old woman seemed to understand the one word ""wedding,"" for she nodded furiously and smiled well pleased; and then devoted her whole time and energy to the display of the garments. And she even laughed aloud when old Mr. King put some coins in her hard hand.Polly took the time to study her headgear. ""I think there is a round board under the cap,"" she confided to Jasper when once out of doors; ""how else could they be pulled so tight? And they look as hard as a drum."""
"""Well, it's funny anyway,"" she said, ""that all the women and girls dress alike in those queer gowns in two parts, and those embroidered jackets over their waists, and those caps and horrible pot-hooks and long curls.""Jasper followed the direction of Polly's finger. There sat Phronsie on a grassy bank a little above them, with one of the fattest Marken babies in her lap. A variegated group of natives was near by, watching her intently. But Phronsie didn't appear to notice them.""Goodness me! no, child!"" exclaimed Grandpapa, in horror. ""Put her down, Phronsie; she's ever so much too heavy for you, dear."" He put forth a protesting hand, but the tears ran down Phronsie's cheeks and fell on the baby's stiff white cap. At that old Mr. King was quite gone in despair.Phronsie dropped the pudgy little hand, and threw herself into old Mr. King's arms. ""Don't be sick, Grandpapa,"" she wailed, struggling with her tears. ""I'd rather not have my baby, please; I don't want her. Please be all well, Grandpapa, dear.""""Excuse me!"" exclaimed Polly, tumbling back in amazement. ""I wasn't looking. I don't want to see. I only meant to surprise you."" She kept backing off toward the door, the colour all over her round cheek.""Oh, I'm not mad, Adela,"" began Polly, ""only sorry. And it's my fault, Jasper,"" seeing his face darken, ""for I looked over her shoulder. I only wanted to surprise her; and Adela, of course, thought I wanted to see what she was doing.""""Yes,"" said Adela, ""I did think so, Polly Pepper, and I don't want anybody to see it."" With that she huddled the thing, whatever it was, down by her side, and ran out of the room as fast as she could go.""A disagreeable creature,"" began Jasper, hotly; ""and she's been a perfect nuisance all along to take her everywhere. Now we drop her, Polly."" He looked more like his father at this moment than Polly had ever seen him before.Jasper turned on his heel, and walked to the window. When he looked back, the annoyance had dropped out of his face, and he was just saying, ""All right, Polly, it ought to be as you say, I'm sure,"" when Adela Gray rushed into the room and up to Polly, and flung her arms around her neck. ""There, and there, and there!"" and something tumbled into Polly's hands."
"""I didn't want anybody to see it,"" mumbled Adela, ""for I've spoiled it; and I was trying to rub out the spots when you came in, and I made it worse than ever. But I'll give it to you now, Polly; and please tear it up, and I'll make you another.""""It _is_ a good thing,"" said Jasper, taking the drawing from Polly's hand and examining it critically, while Polly threw her arms around Adela, and oh-ed and ah-ed her delight at finding that she could draw and sketch so beautifully; and now to think of having this lovely picture of Phronsie!""I'd rather play on the piano,"" said Adela, ""than do all the drawing in the world. But I can't learn; the music master said there was something the matter with my ear, and I never could tell one note from another by the sound. I do so wish I could play on the piano, Polly Pepper!"" she added discontentedly.""I hope you brought that woman with a basket of vegetables we saw at the market the other day,"" said Polly, as he opened the portfolio. ""Do tell me, Jasper, you did bring that, didn't you?"" beginning to fumble through the pile.So for the next hour, there was great turning over and comparing of sketches, and much talk about vertical lines and graceful curves, and shading and perspective, and expression, and dear knows what all, as the three heads bent over the portfolio. So intent were they all, that no one heard Grandpapa come in, and he sat there in a farther corner, for a good quarter of an hour. At last Polly looked up and saw him.""Oh, Grandpapa!"" she cried, flying off from the group, and carrying Adela's sketch in her hand. ""Just see what a perfectly beautiful picture of Phronsie! Adela Gray made it. She draws splendidly, Grandpapa.""""Nothing could be better, my dear,"" said Grandpapa, blandly; ""it is a fine likeness of Phronsie."" And then he questioned her as to her training in the art, and what she meant to do in the future, and where she intended to study and all that, getting an immense amount of information so artfully that Adela never for an instant suspected his reason. All the time he was holding the sketch of Phronsie in his hand, and intently gazing on it most of the time.""Well,"" he said at last, ""I won't keep you young people any longer,""--for Jasper had thrown down the portfolio and joined the group,--""so run back to your own corner. Dear me,"" pulling out his watch, ""it's only twenty minutes to luncheon. How time does fly, to be sure! To-morrow morning, remember, we are off for Antwerp.""""Well, I do like it very much,"" reiterated Polly. ""I know it's dreadfully dark, but the people in front seem to be stepping right out of the shadows, and to be alive. It seems to me they are just going to come right up toward me, as I sit there.""""And that, after all, I suppose is the best thing one can say of a picture,"" said Jasper. ""And it is always the finest time to look at that picture in the afternoon, you know, so we will go there, Polly, after luncheon."""
"""Metsu was it--Jan--no, Gabriel--Metsu,"" answered Jasper, wrinkling his brows. ""Neither can I remember all those fellows' names. Yes, indeed, you'll find Phronsie won't let us go there without paying respects to her special picture.""""And then I suppose Grandpapa will take us for a last drive in Vondel Park. Oh, what nice times we have had, Jasper King!"" exclaimed Polly, leaning back against the sofa, and clasping her hands restfully. ""I just love Amsterdam! And I hate to leave it!""""Well, you'll go, perhaps, sometime,"" said Polly, with an uncomfortable feeling that she ought not to enjoy the things that Adela hadn't seen. ""And you are going to Antwerp with us to-morrow, anyway,"" she added, brightening up.And that evening Grandpapa sat down by little old Mrs. Gray in the parlour after dinner, and though he began about something as far distant as possible, before long he was talking about Adela, and her wonderful talent. And the most surprising thing about it all was, that the little old lady, not intending to do it in the least, nor really comprehending how much she was telling, soon had him informed on all that he had set his heart on learning--how Adela had just been taken from the Paris school, because the little fortune her father had left, had somehow shrunk up, and there was no more money to keep her there. ""I can't tell how it is, sir,"" she mourned, raising her faded eyes under the widow's cap to the kind old face above her, ""I thought there was enough to educate my grandchild; it wasn't a big sum, but I supposed it was quite sufficient; but now it appears to be almost gone, and I have only just enough to keep me."" She didn't add that the curate, her husband, when he crept into his grave, in the English churchyard, had left her nothing but the memory of his good name, her small means coming as a legacy from some of his grateful friends, they, too, long since dead.Old Mr. King made no comment, only passed on with a few little leading remarks when the information seemed to be on the wane. And then he said he thought he would like a game of backgammon, and he challenged the parson to come on and be beaten. And at an early hour the party broke up. ""For remember,"" said Grandpapa, for about the fiftieth time that day, ""it's Antwerp to-morrow!""So it was at Antwerp that the whole splendid business was concluded. And when the story of it came out, there was a regular jubilee all around. For were not Adela and Adela's grandmother going with the King party around a bit more on the continent, and then off to Paris again, and back to the beloved school--Grandpapa's gift to the girl with the talent, to keep it alive!""It's your duty, Madam,"" said Mr. King, sternly, at which she shrank down farther in her chair. ""Who knows what such talent will do in the world? and it's my duty to see that it is kept alive,--nothing more nor less than a question of duty.""He stamped up and down the room vehemently, and the little old lady protesting that she wanted to do her duty,--she was sure she always did,--the hardest part was over, and old Mr. King chuckled to himself triumphantly.""And now,"" cried Polly, in a transport, when the first surprise was over, and everybody had settled down to the quiet enjoyment of it all, ""we've really and truly got a celebrated artist all to ourselves,"" and she drew herself up in pride.""Oh, well; you will be,"" said Polly, confidently, ""sometime, and then we can say 'yes, we knew her when she was a girl,' and we'll go to picture-galleries the same as we do here, and see your name stuck up in the corners of the very best ones, Adela.""""I say so, too,"" she cried, and deserting the window, they surrounded the centre-table, and soon had the big journals, photographs, and pictures, of every sort and size, the ink bottle, and library paste, scissors, and all the rest of the paraphernalia, spread out on it.""It's good that Grandpapa is lying down and doesn't wish to go out,"" remarked Polly, snipping away at a fearful rate, and pausing only to write down the dates and other bits of information around each picture, as she pasted it in. ""Now we'll have all this morning to finish these books up to to-day."""
"""And none too much for the job,"" said Jasper, sagely. ""I declare I shall feel like enjoying myself twice as well, when once they're up to date. They've been hanging round my conscience every day since I slackened work on them.""""Oh, yes, you would, I think, Polly,"" said Jasper. ""Well, we are at it now, and that's enough. Now says I, I'm on book No. 2!"" And he flapped down the cover of the completed one. ""That's done, thank fortune!""""Yes, and I'm so glad you proposed this way to keep a journal,"" said Polly, ""to have them labelled 'My Notes on My European Journey,' and to have No. 1 green, and No. 2 red, and so on all through the rest of the colours.""""Well, you first thought of cutting out pictures and all sorts of items, and then writing the dates and whatever else we wanted to around the pictures,"" said Jasper. ""I'm sure that's more important than the title of the book, Polly.""But Polly slipped in so many of the beautiful photographs of the ""Descent from the Cross,"" and the other two famous pictures by Rubens, that her red book was closed the third day of their stay in the old town of Antwerp; and the photographs had even overflowed into the yellow book, No. 3.They had a habit, most of their party, of dropping into the Cathedral once a day at least, usually in the morning, and sometimes before service. And then when it was quiet, and before the ordinary throng of sight-seers trailed through, Jasper would hire some chairs of one of the old women who always seem to be part and parcel of European cathedrals; and they would sit down before the painting, its wings spread over the dingy green background, and study what has made so many countless travellers take long and oftentimes wearisome journeys to see.And Polly always wanted to go after that to see the ""Assumption,"" which is the altar-piece, and then the ""Elevation of the Cross,"" both by Rubens. ""And I am sure, Grandpapa,"" she would always say, ""I like them as well as I do the famous painting.""After the Cathedral, which they loved all the more,--""for being perched under its eaves"" (as Polly always said when speaking of the hotel that was for the time being their home),--Polly and Jasper set next in their regard the Musée Plantin-Moretus. They were never tired of running down there to the Marché du Vendredi, until it became a regular question every day at dinner, ""Well, what more have you discovered at the Musée Plantin?""And old Mr. King would often answer, for he was as interested as the young people, ""Marvellous things."" And then he would expatiate on the antique furniture, the paintings, engravings, and tapestries, till the little doctor, fresh from his hospital visitations, would remark that it was just as good as if he had time to visit the place, to hear Grandpapa tell it all. And Adela would bring out her little sketches, which now she was not averse to showing, since everybody was so kind and sympathising, and there would be some little nook or corner of corridor or court that Polly would fall upon and pronounce, ""Just perfect, and how did you get it?""And every afternoon they would go to drive as usual, very often around the docks, which gave them all a good idea of this wonderful port. They were never tired of watching the hydraulic cranes, of inspecting the dry docks; the intertwining railways by which all the docks, large and small, are connected, and the two basins, Le Petit and Le Grand Bassin.But Parson Henderson liked the church of St. Jacques best of all things in Antwerp, and he used to steal away mornings to go there again and again. And he asked Polly and Jasper to go there with him one day, and Polly begged to have Adela go too, and they all came home as enthusiastic as he was.And then suddenly Mr. King would wrench them all off from this delightful study and put his foot down peremptorily. ""No more cathedrals for a time,"" he would declare; ""my old head cannot carry any more just yet."" And he would propose a little in-letting of fun. And then off they would go a-shopping, or to the Zoological Gardens; and they always had concerts, of course, wherever they were, for Polly and Jasper's sakes, if for no other reason. And by and by somebody announced, one fine morning, that they had been in Antwerp a fortnight."
"""No, and I'm not going to have you be,"" observed Mrs. Fisher, sensibly. ""This running about sight-seeing is more tiresome, child, than you think for, and dreadfully unsettling unless you stop to rest a bit. No, Jasper,"" as he knocked at the door, ""Polly can't go out to-day, at least not this morning. I've put her to bed.""And there was another person who wholly agreed with Mother Fisher, and that was old Mr. King. ""If you can stop those young folks from killing themselves running about to see everything, you'll do more than I can, Mrs. Fisher,"" he observed. ""It makes no difference how long I plan to stay in a town, so as to do it restfully, if they won't rest.""Polly fidgeted and turned on her pillow, knowing Mamsie was right, but unable to keep from thinking of the many beautiful plans that Jasper and she had formed for that very morning, till her head spun round and round. ""I can't get to sleep,"" she said at last.""Don't try to,"" said her mother, dropping the heavy wool curtains till the room was quite dark; ""that's the worst thing in the world to do, if you want to rest. Just lie still and don't try to think of anything.""""Never say you can't help anything, Polly,"" said her mother, coming over to the bedside to lay a cool hand on Polly's hot forehead, and then to drop a kiss there; and somehow the kiss did what all Polly's trying had failed to accomplish.""And here's my girl, Polly,"" cried Grandpapa, when she ran down to him, and holding her at arm's length, he gazed into her bright eyes and on her rosy cheeks. ""Well, well, your mother's a clever woman, and no mistake.""It was a long summer morning, and they were sailing up the Rhine, with the delights of Brussels and Cologne behind them, and in between the covers of the purple book, No. 4, Polly had been looking at ruined castles and fortresses, at vine-clad terraces, and châlets, until she turned to Grandpapa with a sigh.""If you've found that out, you've learned the lesson early,"" said old Mr. King, with a laugh. ""As many times as I've been over here, there's nothing that surprises me so much as the presumption with which we travellers all rush about, expecting to compass all there is.""""There's just where you are wrong, Polly, child,"" said old Mr. King. ""And this 'ought to see,' why, it's an old dragon, Polly, lying in wait to destroy. Don't you let it get hold of you, but take my advice and see only what you can make your own and remember. Then you've got it.""""It is registered,"" said Jasper, ""and Mr. Henderson got it out for you, father said; that can't be from one of the girls, Polly,"" as the next layer of paper dropping off, disclosed the name of one of the biggest of big London jewellers across a wooden box.""It must be for you, Polly,"" said Jasper. ""There couldn't be any other Miss Mary Pepper, and besides it is addressed to father's care, and comes through our bankers,--see here."" He stooped, and picked up the outer wrapper; it was torn almost in two, but the name and address was all there.So Polly lifted out the little red leather case, still feeling very much as if she were opening a parcel belonging to some one else, and touching a spring at the end, the top flew up, and there on a white satin bed lay a little green enamelled watch set with diamonds.""Give me the wrapper, Jasper, and the wooden box, if only you'll take the other,"" said Polly, feeling very much depressed at coming into possession of other people's property; and Jasper followed with the little enamelled watch.And Grandpapa was just as much astounded as was Polly herself; and all the family congregating in Mother Fisher's room, the little watch was handed about from one to the other, and everybody stared at everybody else, and the mystery thickened every moment. And the strangest thing about it was that no one opened the little back cover where any one might have read:--"
"""Of all the idiots, Jasper,"" he exclaimed, ""your father is the very worst. I've only just this moment thought to look in here."" He flashed the little watch around in Jasper's face; it was now opened at the back.""Earl or no earl, this piece of foolishness goes back,"" fumed old Mr. King, getting out of his chair, and beginning to march back and forth across the floor as he always did when irritated. ""Yes, sir, the very first thing in the morning,"" he repeated, as vehemently as if Jasper had contradicted him.""Yes, sir, it goes back, I tell you,"" repeated his father, now well wrought up to a passion. ""What right has he to send such a piece of foolishness to my Polly Pepper? I can give her all the watches she needs. And this trumpery,"" pointing to the jewelled gift still lying in Jasper's hand, ""is utterly unfit for a schoolgirl. You know that yourself, Jasper.""""Kind to him!"" snorted his father, ""don't I know that? Of course she was. Polly Pepper would be kind to any one. But that's no reason why the old idiot should presume to give her such a silly and expensive present as that. The man doesn't know anything who would do such a thing. And this one is queerer than the average.""""Eccentric? That's a mild way to put it,"" fumed his father. ""He's odder than Dick's hatband. Heaven save Old England if many of her earls are like him. Well, I shall just write the fellow a decent sort of a note, and then I'll pack the box off to him, and that'll be the end of the matter.""""I'm afraid Polly will be sorry,"" said Jasper, feeling at a standstill so far as finding the right word was concerned, for everything he uttered only seemed to make matters worse. So he said the best thing he could think of, and stopped short.""Sorry?"" Old Mr. King came to a dead stop and glared at him. ""You can't mean that Polly Pepper would like me to keep that watch. It's the last thing on earth that she would want, such a gewgaw as that. Why, the child hates the sight of it already as much as I do.""And the next day Polly wrote a nice little note, thanking the old earl for his gift, and hoping that he was quite well; and with so many other pleasant things in it, that if she could have seen him when he received it, she would have been glad indeed. And then she handed the little red leather case to Mr. King. ""Keep it for me, Grandpapa,"" she said simply."
"""I'm so sorry for people who are not going to Bayreuth, Adela!"" exclaimed Polly, looking out of the compartment window, as the train steamed rapidly on from Nuremberg where they had passed several days of delight revelling in the old town.Adela, with her mind more on those past delights, had less attention for thoughts of music, so she answered absently, ""Yes. Oh, Polly, wasn't that Pentagonal Tower fine? What is it they call it in German?""""Oh, I liked him,"" said Adela, who rejoiced in ugly things if only picturesque, ""and I got into one corner of the cell opposite him, so as to sketch it all as well as I could in such a dark place, and a lady came down the little stairs; you remember them.""""Well, this lady came down the stairs. I could see her where I sat, but she couldn't see me, it was so dark in the cell; and she called to her husband--I guess he was her husband, because he looked so _triste_."" Adela often fell into French, from being so long at the Paris school, and not from affectation in the least. ""And she said, 'Come, Henry, let us see what is in there.' And she took one step in, and peered into that robber-knight's face; you know how he is sitting on a little stool, his black hair all round his face, staring at one.""""Well,"" said Adela, ""the lady gave a little squeal, and tumbled right back into her husband's arms. And I guess she stepped on his toes, for he squealed, too, though in a different way, and he gave her a little push and told her not to be a goose, that the man had been dead a thousand years more or less and couldn't hurt her. So then she stepped back, awfully scared though, I could see that, and then she caught sight of me, and she squealed again and jumped, and she screamed right out, 'Oh, there's another in there, in the corner, and it glared at me.' And I didn't glare at all,"" finished Adela, in disdain. ""And then I guess he was scared, too, for he said, 'That old cell isn't worth seeing, anyway, and I'm going down into the torture chamber,' and they hurried off.""""That was a good idea, to put the old scold into that wooden tub concern,"" said Jasper; ""there was some sense in that. I took a picture of it, and the old tower itself. I got a splendid photograph of it, if it will only develop well,"" he added. ""Oh, but the buildings--was ever anything so fine as those old Nuremberg houses, with their high-peaked gables! I have quantities of them--thanks to my kodak.""""No such good luck,"" groaned old Mr. King, which was proved true. For the first persons who walked into the hotel, as the manager was giving directions that the rooms reserved for their party should be shown them, were Mrs. Vanderburgh and her daughter.""Oh!"" exclaimed Mrs. Vanderburgh, as if her dearest friends were before her, ""how glad I am to see you again, dear Mr. King, and you all."" She swept Mrs. Fisher and Mrs. Henderson lightly in her glance as if toleration only were to be observed toward them. ""We have been perfectly _désolée_ without you, Polly, my dear,"" she went on, with a charming smile. ""Fanny will be happy once more. She has been disconsolate ever since we parted, I assure you.""Polly made some sort of a reply, and greeted Fanny, as of old times, on the steamer; but Mrs. Vanderburgh went on, all smiles and eagerness--so rapidly in her friendly intentions, that it boded ill for the future peace of Mr. King's party. So Mr. King broke into the torrent of words at once, without any more scruple. ""And now, Mrs. Vanderburgh, if you will excuse us, we are quite tired, and are going to our rooms."" And he bowed himself off, and of course his family followed; the next moment Fanny and her mother were alone."
"""If this is to be the way,"" said Mrs. Vanderburgh, with a savage little laugh, ""we might much better have stayed in Paris, for I never should have thought, as you know, Fanny, of coming to this out-of-the-way place, seeing that I don't care for the music, if I hadn't heard them say on the steamer that this was their date here.""""Well, I wish that I was at home,"" declared Fanny, passionately, ""and I never, never will come to Europe, Mamma, again as long as I live. You are always chasing after people who run away from you, and those who like me, you won't let me speak to.""""Well, I shall be thankful for the day when you are once in society,"" said her mother, every shred of self-control now gone; ""and I shall sell my tickets for this old Wagner festival, and go back to Paris to-morrow morning.""""Yes, we are going,"" said Fanny Vanderburgh as they met after dinner in the corridor. Her eyes were swollen, and she twisted her handkerchief in her fingers. ""And I did--did--did--"" here she broke down and sobbed--""so want to hear the Wagner operas.""""Mamma doesn't know anybody here except your party,"" mumbled Fanny, ""and she's upset, and declares that we must go back to Paris to-morrow. Oh, Polly Pepper, I hate Paris,"" she exploded. And then sobbed worse than ever.""How very fine!"" exclaimed Mr. King, approvingly; ""that is the best thing I have heard yet. Always bring me such good news, Polly, and I will lay down my newspapers willingly any time."" And he gave a pleased little laugh.""But, Grandpapa--"" and Polly's face drooped, and there was such a sad little note in her voice, that the laugh dropped out of his. ""Fanny wanted above all things to hear the Wagner operas--just think of losing those!"" Polly clasped her hands, and every bit of colour flew from her cheek.There was an awful pause in which Polly had all she could do to keep from rushing from the room. Then Grandpapa said, ""If you can stand it, Polly, you may do as you like, but I warn you to keep them away from me."" And he went back to his paper.""That was when I was such a little chap,"" said Jasper, ""ages ago,--nine years, Polly Pepper,--just think; so it will be as good as new next year. Father is thinking a good deal of taking you there next summer.""""Why, you can keep on making him comfortable, just as you are doing now, Polly,"" replied Jasper. ""He said yesterday it made him grow younger every minute to look at you. And you know he's never sick now, and he was always having those bad attacks. Don't you remember when we first came to Hingham, Polly?"" as they took their seats.""O dear me, I guess I do, Jasper, and how you saved Phronsie from being carried off by the big organ man,"" and she shivered even now at this lapse of years. ""And all the splendid times at Badgertown and the little brown--""""I'm going over into that vacant seat."" Tom forgot his fear of Polly and his hatred of girls generally, and rushed around the aisle to plunge awkwardly into the seat just back of Jasper. ""I'll stay here till the person comes."" His long arms came in contact with several obstacles, such as sundry backs and shoulders in his progress, but he had no time to consider such small things or to notice the black looks he got in consequence."
"""My grandfather is well now, and he would have sent some message to you if he knew I was to run across you,"" went on Tom, looking at Jasper, but meaning Polly; ""did you get a little trifle he sent you some weeks ago? He's been in a funk about it because he didn't hear.""""Whew!"" whistled Tom; ""oh, beg pardon!"" for several people turned around and stared; so he ducked his head, and was mostly lost to view for a breathing space. When he thought they had forgotten him, he bobbed it up. ""Why, Grandfather picked it out--had a bushel of things sent up from London to choose from, you know, weeks and weeks ago, as soon as he got up to London. That's no end queer.""At this moment Mrs. Vanderburgh, who, seeing Fanny so happy again, concluded to stay on the strength of resurrected hopes of Polly Pepper's friendship, sailed into the opera house, with her daughter. And glancing across the aisle, for their seats were at the side, she caught sight of the party she was looking for, and there was a face she knew, but wasn't looking for.""Fanny,"" she cried, clutching her arm, ""there is Tom Selwyn! Well, now we _are_ in luck!"" And Tom saw her, and again he ducked, but for a different reason. When he raised his head, he glanced cautiously in the direction he dreaded. ""There's that horrible person,"" he whispered in Jasper's ear.Polly was sitting straight, her hands folded in her lap, with no thought for audience, or anything but what she was to see and hear on that wonderful stage. Old Mr. King leaned past Parson Henderson, and gazed with the greatest satisfaction at her absorbed face.Polly never knew that Mamsie, with a happy look in her black eyes, was regarding her intently, too, nor that many a glance was given to the young girl whose colour came and went in her cheek, nor that Jasper sometimes spoke a low word or two. She was lost in the entrancing world of mystery and legend borne upward by the grand music, and she scarcely moved.""Well, Polly."" Old Mr. King was smiling at her and holding out his hand. The curtains had closed for the intermission, and all the people were getting out of their chairs. Polly sat still and drew a long breath. ""Oh, Grandpapa, must we go?""""And what we should do with you if we didn't stop for supper,"" observed Jasper, snapping the case to the opera-glasses, ""I'm sure I don't know, Polly. I spoke to you three times, and you didn't hear me once.""Just then Mrs. Vanderburgh, who hadn't heard any more of the opera than could fit itself into her lively plans for the campaign she laid out to accomplish in siege of Tom Selwyn, pushed and elbowed herself along. ""Of course the earl isn't here--and the boy is alone, and dreadfully taken with Jasper King, so I can manage him. And once getting him, I'll soon have the earl to recognise me as a relation."" Then, oh! visions of the golden dream of bliss when she could visit such titled kin in Old England, and report it all when at home in New York, filled her head. And with her mind eaten up with it, she pushed rudely by a plain, somewhat dowdy-looking woman who obstructed her way."
"""And I must get by,"" answered Mrs. Vanderburgh, interrupting, and wriggling past as well as she could. But the lace on her flowing sleeve catching on the umbrella handle of a stout German coming the other way, she tore it half across. A dark flush of anger rushed over her face, and she vented all her spite on the plain-looking person in her path. ""If you had moved, this wouldn't have happened!"" she exclaimed.""It was impossible for me to do so,"" replied the woman, just as quietly as ever. Just then Tom Selwyn rushed up: ""Mother!"" to the plain-looking woman; ""well, we _did_ get separated! Oh!"" and seeing her companion he plunged back.""Torn my sleeve!"" echoed her mother, irately, ""that's a trifle,"" while Fanny stared in surprise, knowing, by past experience, that much lesser accidents had made black days for her; ""I'm the unluckiest person alive. And think of all the money your father has given me to spend, and it won't do any good. Fanny, I'm going straight back to Paris, as quickly as possible.""""Because you can't,"" echoed Fanny, in her turn, and with a malicious little laugh. ""Don't I know? it's the same old story--those you chase after, run away from you. You've been chasing, Mamma; you needn't tell me.""""Can't,"" said Tom, bobbing his head; ""must stay with my mother. Thought you never would turn around."" Jasper looked his surprise, and involuntarily glanced by Tom. ""Yes, my mother's here; we've got separated, she's gone ahead,"" said Tom, jerking his head toward the nearest exit. ""She says we'll go and see you. Where?""Tom disappeared--rushed off to his mother to jerk himself away to a convenient waiting-place till the disagreeable woman on the steamer had melted into space. Then he flew back, and in incoherent sentences made Mrs. Selwyn comprehend who she was, and the whole situation.The earl's daughter was a true British matron, and preserved a quiet, immovable countenance; only a grim smile passed over it now and then. At last she remarked coolly, as if commenting on the weather, ""I don't believe she will trouble you, my son."" Never a word about the lace episode or the crowding process.""Why, there is Tom!"" exclaimed Jasper, craning his neck as his party were about to sit down. ""Father, Tom Selwyn is here with his mother, and they can't find places, I almost know, and we might have two more chairs easily at our table,"" he hurried it all out."
"So Jasper ran around to his father's chair and explained. The end of it all was, that he soon hurried off, being introduced to Tom's mother, to whom he presented his father's compliments, and would she do him the favour to join their party? And in ten minutes, every one felt well acquainted with the English matron, and entirely forgot that she was an earl's daughter. And Tom acquitted himself well, and got on famously with old Mr. King.""And the Bernese Alps,"" put in Jasper, across the table. ""How is that, Tom, for an outing? Can't you do it?"" For it transpired that Mrs. Selwyn had left the other children, two girls and two smaller boys, with their grandfather, on the English estate. They all called this place home since the father was in a business in Australia that required many long visits, and Tom's mother had decided that he should have a bit of a vacation with her, so they had packed up and off, taking in the Wagner festival first, and here they were. ""Yes,"" after she considered a bit, ""we can do that. Join the party and then over to Lucerne, and perhaps take in the Bernese Alps.""And in the midst of it all, the horn sounded; the intermission was over, chairs were pushed back hastily, and all flocked off. No one must be late, and there must be no noisy or bustling entrances into the opera house.And if Polly Pepper sat entranced through the rest of the matchless performance, Tom Selwyn--three seats back and off to the left--was just as quietly happy. But he wasn't thinking so much of ""Parsifal"" as might have been possible. ""It's no end fine of the little mother to say 'yes,'"" he kept running over and over to himself, with a satisfied glance at the quiet face under the plain, English bonnet.But in the morning, it was ten o'clock before Mr. King's party gathered for breakfast, for Grandpapa always counselled sleeping late when out the night before. And when Polly did slip into her chair, there was a little note lying on her plate.Polly sprang up suddenly and threw her arms around her mother's neck. Her face was wet with tears, and she sobbed out, ""Oh, if I'd done more for her, Mamsie, or been pleasant to Mrs. Vanderburgh, she might have stayed.""""You haven't any call to worry, Polly, child,"" said Mother Fisher, firmly. ""You did all that could be done--and remember one thing, it's very wrong to trouble others as you certainly will if you give way to your feelings in this manner.""""Trust you,"" said Mother Fisher, with a proud look in her black eyes, ""I can trust you ever and always, Polly; and now run to Mr. King and let him see a bright face, for he's worrying about you, Polly.""""But just you and I,"" finished Jasper. ""I declare I don't know. You see we don't stay still long enough in any one place to hire a decent one; and besides, father said, when we started, that it was better for us to rest and travel about without any practising this summer. You know he did, Polly.""""And then they came in,"" added Polly, with a little shiver at the recollection. ""But that big fat man with the black beard was the worst, Jasper."" She glanced around as if she expected to see him coming down the long parlour."
"""And we forgot the music,"" went on Polly, deep in the reminiscence, ""and we wouldn't go back--don't you remember?--until the big fat man with the dreadful black beard had gone, for he'd picked it up and been looking at it.""""Yes, I remember all about it,"" said Jasper; ""dear me, what a time we had! It's enough to make one wish that the summer was all over, and that we were fairly settled in Dresden,"" he added gloomily, as he saw her face.Old Mr. King in a nook behind the curtain, dropped the newspaper in his lap and thought a bit. ""Best to wait till we get to Lucerne,"" he said to himself, nodding his white head; ""then, says I, Polly, my child, you shall have your piano.""Jasper stared, well knowing his father's views in regard to the luggage question. ""The first thing that you must unpack--the very first,"" old Mr. King was saying, ""is your music. Don't wait a minute, Jasper, but go and get it. And then call Polly, and--""""You do just as I say, Jasper,"" commanded his father. ""And tell Polly to get her music; and then do you two go to the little room out of the big parlour, and play to your hearts' content."" And he burst into a hearty laugh at Jasper's face, as he dangled a key at the end of a string, before him.""You go along and do as I tell you,"" said Mr. King, mightily pleased at the success of his little plan. ""And don't you tell Polly Pepper one word until she has taken her music down in the little room,"" as Jasper bounded off on the wings of the wind.But Polly and Jasper wouldn't have cared had they known it, as long as they had their own delightful little music room to themselves--as they played over and over all the dear old pieces, and Polly revelled in everything that she was so afraid she had forgotten.""I really haven't lost it, Jasper!"" she would exclaim radiantly, after finishing a concerto, and dropping her hands idly on the keys. ""And I was _so_ afraid I'd forgotten it entirely. Just think, I haven't played that for three months, Jasper King.""But somebody else, on the other side of the partition between the little music room and the big parlour, had heard, and he pulled his black beard thoughtfully with his long fingers, then pricked up his ears to hear more. And it was funny how, almost every day, whenever the first notes on the piano struck up in Mr. King's little music room, the big fat man, who was so tired with his season of hard work, never seemed to think that he could rest as well as in that particular corner up against that partition. And no matter what book or paper he had in his hand, he always dropped it and fell to pulling his black beard with his long fingers, before the music was finished.And then, ""Oh, Polly, come child, you have played long enough,"" from Mother Fisher on the other side of the partition; or old Mr. King would say, ""No more practising to-day, Miss Polly;"" or Phronsie would pipe out, ""Polly, Grandpapa is going to take us out on the lake; do come, Polly."" And then it was funnier yet to see how suddenly the big fat man with the dreadful black beard seemed to find that particular corner by that partition a very tiresome place. And as the piano clicked down its cover, he would yawn, and get up and say something in very rapid German to himself, and off he would go, forgetting all about his book or newspaper, which, very likely, would tumble to the floor, and flap away by itself till somebody came and picked it up and set it on the sofa.One morning old Mr. King, hurrying along with his batch of English mail to enjoy opening it in the little music room where Jasper and Polly were playing a duet, ran up suddenly against a fat heavy body coming around an opposite angle.""Oh, I beg your pardon, sir,"" exclaimed Mr. King in great distress, the more so as he saw that the stranger's glasses were knocked off his nose by the collision. ""I do trust they are not broken,"" he added, in a concerned tone, endeavouring to pick them up.But the big man was before him. ""Not a beet, not a beet,"" he declared, adjusting them on his nose again. Then he suddenly grasped old Mr. King's hand. ""And I be very glad, sir, _very_ glad indeed, dat I haf roon into you."""
"""If you have nothing more to remark, sir,"" said Mr. King, haughtily, ""perhaps you will be kind enough to stand out of my way, and allow me to pass. And it would be as well for you to observe more care in the future, sir, both in regard to your feet, and your tongue, sir.""""Yes, I am _very_ glad,"" began the big man again, who hadn't even heard Mr. King's tirade, ""for now--"" and he gave his black beard a final twitch, and his eyes suddenly lightened with a smile that ran all over his face, ""I can speak to you of dis ting dat is in my mind. Your--""The big man stared in astonishment into the angry face, the smile dropping out of his own. ""I beg to _ex_cuse myself,"" he said, with a deep bow, and a wave of his long fingers. ""Will you pass?"" and he moved up as tightly as possible to the wall.Old Mr. King went into the little music room in a furious rage, and half an hour afterward Polly and Jasper, pausing to look around, saw him tossing and tumbling his letters and newspapers about on the table, fuming to himself all the while.""I don't know,"" she was just going to say helplessly, but Jasper's face made her see that something must be done. ""Let's go and tell him we are sorry,"" she said; ""that's what Mamsie always liked best if she felt badly.""Mr. King put back his head and laughed long and loud, as he hadn't done for many a day, his ill humour dropping off in the midst of it. ""The letters are all right,"" he said, wiping his eyes, ""never had better news. It was an impertinent fellow I met out there, that's all.""""Don't you worry, my boy; it's all right, the fellow got his quietus; besides, he wasn't worth minding,"" said Mr. King, carelessly. ""Why, here is your mother,"" turning to Polly. ""Now then, Mrs. Fisher, what is it; for I see by your eye some plan is on the carpet.""""Is that really so?"" cried Mr. King, with a little laugh. ""What! not even going to visit one of his beloved hospitals?"" while Polly exclaimed, radiantly, ""Oh, how perfectly elegant! Now we'll have Papa-Doctor for a whole long day!""Phronsie, who had been close to her mother's gown during the delivery of this important news, clasped her hands in a quiet rapture, while Polly exclaimed, ""Now, Grandpapa, can it be the Rigi?"" Jasper echoing the cry heartily.""I suppose it is to be the Rigi,"" assented old Mr. King, leaning back in his chair to survey them all, ""that is, if Mrs. Fisher approves. We'll let you pick out the jaunting place,"" turning to her, ""seeing that it is the doctor's holiday.""""We're to go up the Rigi!"" exclaimed Polly, giving a little whirl, and beginning to dance around the room, repeating, ""We're to go up the Rigi,"" exactly as if nobody knew it, and she was telling perfectly fresh news.""So you shall,"" cried Polly and Jasper together; so they made a little ring of three, and away they went, Polly this time crying, ""Just think, we're going to have the most beautiful sunrise in all this world."""
"And on the other side of the partition, in his accustomed nook in the big parlour, the big fat man with the black beard sat. He pulled this same black beard thoughtfully a bit, when Mr. King was telling about the impertinent fellow. Then he smiled and jabbered away to himself very hard in German; and it wasn't till the King party hurried off to get ready for the Rigi trip, that he got up and sauntered off.""I'm sure I didn't,"" said old Mr. King, carelessly, ""and I'm free to confess I'm honestly glad of it. For if there is one thing I detest more than another, Polly, my girl, it is to hear people, especially women, rave and gush over the scenery.""""Now, I'm glad of that,"" exclaimed Grandpapa, in a tone of the greatest satisfaction, ""for I can ask him about the music masters in Dresden and get his advice, and be all prepared before we go there for the winter to secure the very best.""""And I can see him, and perhaps hear him play,"" breathed Polly, in an awestruck tone, quite lost to scenery and everything else. Jasper leaned forward and stared at her in amazement. Then he slipped out of his seat, and made his way up to them to find out what it was all about.""How did she know?"" he asked, as Polly told all she knew; ""I'm just going to ask her."" But the lady, who had caught snatches of the conversation, though she hadn't heard Mr. King's part of it, very obligingly leaned forward in her seat and told all she knew.And by the time this was done, they all knew that the information was in the American paper printed in Paris, and circulated all over the Continent, and that the lady had read it that very morning just before setting out.So Polly and Jasper ran back obediently, but every step of the toilsome ascent by which the car pushed its way to the wonderful heights above, Polly saw everything with the words, ""Herr Bauricke is at _our_ hotel,"" ringing through her ears; and she sat as in a maze. Jasper was nearly as bad.And then everybody was pouring out of the cars and rushing for the hotel on the summit; all but Mr. King's party and a few others, who had their rooms engaged by telegraphing up. When they reached the big central hall there was a knot of Germans all talking together, and on the outside fringe of this knot, people were standing around and staring at the central figure. Suddenly some one darted away from this outer circle and dashed up to them. It was the lady from their hotel.""I knew you'd want to know,"" she exclaimed breathlessly; ""that's Herr Bauricke himself--he came up on our train--just think of it!--the big man in the middle with the black beard."" She pointed an excited finger at the knot of Germans. Polly got Jasper away into a side corridor by a beseeching little pull on his sleeve. ""Oh, just to think,"" she mourned, ""I called that great man such unpleasant things--that he was big and fat, and--oh, oh!""Herr Bauricke turned his sharp eyes on them for a moment, hesitated, then came directly up, and stopped in front of them. ""I meant--I _in_tended to speak to your grandfader first. Dat not seem best _now_."" The great man was really talking to them, and Polly held her breath, not daring to look into his face, but keeping her gaze on his wonderful fingers. ""My child,"" those wonderful fingers seized her own, and clasped them tightly, ""you have great promise, mind you, you know only a leedle now, and you must work--_work--work_."" He brought it out so sharply, that the last word was fairly shrill. ""But I tink you will,"" he added kindly, dropping his tone. Then he laid her fingers gently in her lap."
"""Dat is right."" Herr Bauricke bobbed his head in approval, so that his spectacles almost fell off. ""I hear dat, in de music she play. No leedle girl play like dat, who doesn't work. I will hear you sometime at de hotel,"" he added abruptly, ""and tell you some tings dat will help you. To-morrow, maybe, when we go down from dis place, eh?""""Eh?"" exclaimed Herr Bauricke, and pushing up his spectacles to stare into her flushed and troubled face. ""Perhaps I not make my meaning clear; I mean I _geef_ you of my time and my best _ad_vice. Now you understand--eh?"" He included Jasper in his puzzled glance.""Yes, sir,"" Jasper made haste to say. ""We do understand; and it is so very good of you, and Polly will accept it, sir."" ""For father will make it all right with him as to the payment,"" he reflected easily.""You not tink me nice looking--so?"" said Herr Bauricke. ""Well, I not tink so myself, eeder. And I scare you maybe, wid dis,"" and he twisted his black beard with his long fingers. ""Ah, so; well, we will forget all dis, leedle girl,"" and he bent down and took Polly's other fingers that hung by her side. ""And eef you not let me come to-morrow to your leedle music room, and tell you sometings to help you learn better, I shall know dat you no like me _now_--eh?""Polly and Jasper rushed off, they scarcely knew how, to Grandpapa, to tell him the wonderful news,--to find him in a truly dreadful state of mind. When they had told their story, he was as much worse as could well be imagined.""Hum!"" Little Dr. Fisher was the first to speak. He took off his big spectacles and wiped them; then put them on his nose and adjusted them carefully, and glared around the group, his gaze resting on old Mr. King's face.""You see I can't allow Herr Bauricke to give any lessons or advice to Polly after this,"" went on Mr. King, hastily. ""Of course he would be paid; but, under the circumstances, it wouldn't do, not in the least. It is quite out of the question,"" he went on, as if some one had been contradicting him. But no one said a word.""Awkward? I should say so,"" frowned Mr. King; ""it's awkward to the last degree. Here's a man who bumps into me in a hotel passage,--though, for that matter, I suppose it's really my fault as much as his,--and I offer to pick up his spectacles that were dropped in the encounter. And he tells me that he is glad that we ran up against each other, for it gives him a chance to tell me what is on his mind. As if I cared what was on his mind, or on the mind of any one else, for that matter,"" he declared, in extreme irritation. ""And I told him to his face that he was an impertinent fellow, and to get out of my way. Yes, I did!"""
"""Can't you see, oh, can't you see,"" exploded the little doctor, mopping up his face with his big handkerchief, ""that your big German was trying to tell you of Polly's playing, and to say something, probably pretty much the same that he has said to her and to Jasper? O dear me, I should like to have been there to see you both,"" ended Dr. Fisher, faintly. Then he went off into another laugh.""Well, he doesn't bear you any malice, apparently,"" said the little doctor, who, having been requested to speak, saw no reason for withholding any opinion he might chance to have, ""for, if he did, he wouldn't have made that handsome offer to Polly.""""That may be; the offer is handsome enough,"" answered Mr. King, ""that is the trouble, it's too handsome. I cannot possibly accept it under the awkward circumstances. No, children,"" he turned to Polly and Jasper, as if they had been beseeching him all the while, ""you needn't ask it, or expect it,"" and he got out of his chair, and stalked from the room.Jasper buried his face in his hands, and a deep gloom settled over the whole party, on all but little Dr. Fisher. He pranced over to Polly and Jasper just as merrily as if nothing dreadful had happened. ""Don't you be afraid, my boy,"" he said; ""your father is a dreadfully sensible man, and there's no manner of doubt but that he will fix this thing up.""And truly Mother Fisher was having a hard time to control herself. That Jasper could see as he lifted his head. And the little doctor also saw, and skipped back across the room to her side. And Phronsie, feeling plunged into the deepest woe by all this dreadful state of affairs, that had come too bewilderingly for her to rally to Grandpapa's side, first began to cry. And then, thinking better of it, went softly out of the door, and no one noticed her when she went--with the tears running down her cheeks.Down the long corridor she hurried, not knowing which way Grandpapa went, but turning into the little reading room, she spied him sitting by the table. The apartment was otherwise empty. He wasn't reading, not even looking at a paper, but sitting bolt upright, and lost in thought.""What? An idiot? Yes, I have been an idiot of the worst kind,"" declared Mr. King, ""and all the rest just as I say; rude and--why, what is the matter, Phronsie?"" for the little arms clutched him so tightly he could hardly breathe.""Oh, Grandpapa,"" she wailed, and drawing away a bit to look at him, he saw her face convulsed with the effort not to cry. ""Don't say such things. You are never naughty, Grandpapa dear; you can't be,"" she gasped.""There, there, there,"" ejaculated old Mr. King, frightened at the effect of his words and patting her yellow hair, at his wits' end what to say. So he broke out, ""Well, now, Phronsie, you must tell me what to do.""Thereupon Phronsie, seeing there was something she could really do to help Grandpapa, came out of her distress enough to sit up quite straight and attentive in his lap. ""You see I spoke rudely to a man, and I called him a fellow, and he was a gentleman, Phronsie; you must remember that.""""But you can tell the gentleman you are sorry,"" said Phronsie. ""Oh, Grandpapa dear, do go and tell him now, this very minute."" She broke away from him again, and sat straight on his knee, while a glad little smile ran all over her face."
"""I can't--you don't understand--O dear me!"" Mr. King set her abruptly on the floor, and took a few turns up and down the room. Phronsie's eyes followed him with a grieved expression. When she saw the distress on his face, she ran up to him and seized his hand, but didn't speak.""But I cannot possibly accept it,"" groaned old Mr. King; ""don't you see, child, after treating him so? Why, how could I? The idea is too monstrous!"" He set off now at such a brisk pace down the room that Phronsie had hard work to keep up with him. But he clung to her hand.""Eh--oh, perhaps,"" assented Mr. King, slowly, and passing a troubled hand across his brow. ""Well, now, Phronsie, you come and sit in my lap again, and we'll talk it over, and you tell me what I ought to do.""""Then the best way is to have it over with as soon as possible,"" said old Mr. King; ""so come on, child, and you can see that the business is done up in good shape."" He gathered her little fingers up in his hand, and setting her once more on the floor, they passed out of the apartment.The door of the private parlour belonging to Mr. King's rooms was flung wide open, and into the gloomy interior, for Mother Fisher and Jasper were still inconsolable, marched old Mr. King. He was arm in arm, so far as the two could at once compass the doorway, with Herr Bauricke; while Phronsie ducked and scuttled in as she could, for the big German, with ever so many honorary degrees to his name, held her hand fast.""Glad to see you!"" exclaimed the little doctor, bubbling over with happiness, and wringing the long fingers extended. ""My wife is overcome with delight,"" which the big German understood very well; and he smiled his knowledge of it, as he looked into her black eyes. ""She is like to mein Frau,"" he thought, having no higher praise. And then he turned quickly to Polly and Jasper. For all that grand old Rigi's summit claimed them, it was some time before Mr. King's party left the little parlour. Herr Bauricke surely didn't want to until he had gotten it settled just what he did mean about Polly's music. That she showed great promise, that some faults in the way she had been taught were there, but it was by no means too late to mend them, that she had spirit and expression and love for the art.""Ah, dat is eet, after all."" Herr Bauricke clasped his long fingers and beamed at her, and then swept the entire party. ""Lofe, ah, how one must lofe eet! Eef not, shame, shame!"" His countenance darkened frightfully, and he fairly glared at them, as he unclasped his hands and swung one over his head, while his black beard vibrated with each word.""Goodness me!"" exclaimed Tom Selwyn, ""it takes a musical man to sling around. I say, Jasper, I'd like to do a bit of boxing or cricketing with him."" But Jasper didn't hear or see anything but Herr Bauricke and Polly; and, indeed, the whole room was given up to the ""musical man"" and his words."
"At last Polly drew a long breath; Grandpapa was taking her hand. ""Let us all go out and explore a bit,"" and off they went, the entire party. And the ""musical man,"" as Tom still continued to call him in private, proved to be as expert in the use of his feet as his fingers, for he led them here, there, and everywhere that promised the least chance of a good view.But Polly saw only the glorious future when, on the morrow, Herr Bauricke would really show her on the piano how best to study and to work! And the rosy glow of sunset wasn't one-half as bright as all her dreams.""Well, I suppose I am looking at it, Phronsie,"" said Polly, with another little laugh, ""but perhaps not in just the right way, for you see, Phronsie, I can't seem to see anything but just the splendid thing that is coming to-morrow. Oh, Phronsie Pepper, just think of that.""""Of course you are,"" declared Polly, warmly, ""just as glad as can be, Phronsie,"" and she threw her arm around her. ""And now I'm going to look at the sunset in the right way, I hope. Isn't it beautiful, child?""""Polly,"" declared Phronsie, suddenly wriggling away from Polly's arm, to stand in front of her with a beaming face, ""I think it's just as beautiful as it can be up top here. I can see right in between that red cloud and that little pink teenty one. And I wish I could just go in, Polly.""""We could go sailing off, oh, ever so far,"" said Polly, swinging her arms to suit the action to the words. ""And you'd be stuck to your rock here, Adela; while, Phronsie, you and I would sit on the edge of a cloud, and let our feet hang over; and oh, Adela, you could sketch us then as we went sailing by.""""How that would look!"" exclaimed Adela, with such a face that Polly burst out into a merry laugh, and Phronsie, joining with her little crow of delight and clapping her hands at the idea of such fun, brought pretty much the whole party around them.""Take care or you'll fall,"" warned Jasper. ""See, your mother is looking worried."" And, truth to tell, Mrs. Fisher, on a point of rocks a little way off with the others, was getting a bit alarmed as she saw the progress of her baby.""I'll take care,"" said Phronsie, sobering down at thought of Mamsie's being troubled, and beginning to pick her way carefully. And Jasper gathered up her fingers in his, thinking of the time when she toiled up and down the long stairway, when she first came to what was now her home, blessed thought! and Polly and he sat down at the foot to watch her.""We aren't really going, Jasper,"" said Phronsie, shaking her head, soberly, ""because you see we can't. But Polly's pretending it all; and we're to sit on the edge and swing our feet. And Adela is going to make a picture of us.""""Whew!"" whistled Jasper. ""And I say, Polly,""--for now they had scrambled up to the two girls,--""isn't there room for us on that cloud too?"" While Tom kicked pebbles, and wished he knew how to talk to girls."
"""Yes, and Mamsie and Papa-Doctor,"" finished Polly, ready for any nonsense, she was just bubbling over so with joy at thought of the morrow and what it would bring. ""Well, it is good the cloud is big,"" squinting up at the radiant sky.""He didn't really think we meant it,"" said Polly, her brown eyes very grave. Would Jasper really persuade him to forget that laugh? ""But he is shy, and he said the first thing that came into his head.""""Yes, oh, I guess so,"" said Polly. ""Well, there, the pretty glow has all faded; see, Phronsie,"" pointing up to the leaden clouds that no one who had failed to see a few moments before could have imagined alive with colour. ""Now we ought to run over to the others, for they'll be going back to the hotel.""""O dear me, I didn't mean to laugh,"" Adela was saying to herself as she fell back in the zig-zag path down the rocks. ""I wish I hadn't--I'll--I'll--"" What she meant to do wasn't very clear in her mind; what she did do, was to run up to her grandmother's and her room, and toss her sketch-book on the table, and herself on the bed, for a good hearty cry.Polly found her there, when they couldn't find her anywhere else, with much searching and running about. Little old Mrs. Gray was worrying dreadfully, so afraid she had been blown from the rocks; for the wind had now risen, and all the travellers were seeking the shelter and warmth of the hotel corridor and parlours.""Oh, Adela, how _could_ you?"" Polly was going to say. And then she thought that would be the very worst thing in all the world, for Adela's shoulders were shaking, and it would only make her cry worse. And besides, Polly remembered how she had sometimes given way in just this fashion, and how much worse she would have been, had it not been for a wise, good mother. So she ran out in the hall. ""I must tell her grandmother,"" she said to herself.""All right."" And Jasper vanished, and Polly went slowly back, wishing she could be downstairs with all the dear people, instead of trying to comfort this dismal girl. The next moment she was kneeling down by the side of the bed, and trying to get hold of one of Adela's hands. But Adela bounced over to the farther side, and she cried out angrily, ""It's all very well for you to say so, because you didn't do it. And everybody likes you. O dear me--tee--hee--boo--hoo!""""Well, I can't just tell you exactly why you can't cry when you want to,"" said Polly, afraid she wasn't going to say the right word, ""but Mamsie could if she were here. I'll go and call her, Adela."" And Polly sprang to her feet. ""She'll come, I know.""""O dear me."" Adela squirmed all over the bed. ""I can't stop--I've always cried as much as I wanted to. O dear me--boo-hoo-hoo! I mean--I'll stop, don't go--"" sopping up her wet face with a nervous hand. ""See, Pol-_ly_!"" for Polly had slipped out of the room. Adela flew off from the bed. ""Polly--Polly, Pol-_ly_!"" she called, in a piteous little tone."
"So Polly stood on her stair while Adela, bemoaning all the way that she didn't look fit to be seen, and that she was a perfect sight, and she couldn't go down among them all, stumbled back into her room. And pretty soon Polly heard a big splash. ""O dear me--oh, what shall I do?""""Just see what I've done,"" exclaimed Adela, holding out one arm. It was dripping wet, and the water was running off in a stream and down to meet a small puddle where the splash had struck on the floor.""That's too bad,"" said Mrs. Fisher; and in a minute Adela's wet arm was free and nicely dried, and a clean waist being found, it was soon on, and then Mother Fisher took up the hairbrush. ""We must have this all nice and smooth,"" she said. And Adela stood still, liking it all very much; and her hair was brushed, much as if she had been Phronsie, and then Mother Fisher released her with a smile. ""There, now you are ready,"" she said.And at dinner Tom Selwyn looked across the table, and when he caught sight of Adela's face, and saw that some one else could feel as badly as he could, and he guessed the reason, he made up his mind what he was going to do next. And as soon as the meal was over, without giving himself time to think, he marched up to Adela. ""Say, I didn't much mind because you laughed, don't you know,"" and held out his hand.""Well, checkers; that's senseless,"" retorted Tom, ""and, besides, you Americans always say 'nice' at everything."" Then he looked at her red eyes and poor little nose, and added kindly, ""Well, never mind, call it checkers, then, I don't care; let's have a game,"" and he rushed for the board.And Adela never once thought how she looked. And she beat Tom twice, and that quite set her up. And then for the next three games he routed her men completely off the board. And, strange to say, she kept her temper, and even smiled at the disaster.""You don't say so,"" exclaimed Mr. King. ""Well, that's doing pretty well, Adela, to get ahead of the English lad. But you don't stand much of a chance this time; Tom's got the game, sure."" And so it proved in less time than it takes to write it.""Your Grandfather has made arrangements for us all to be called,"" said Mrs. Fisher, ""so we won't have to depend on the horn, and now you must go to sleep just as fast as ever you can. Then you'll be as bright as a button in the morning, Polly."" ""Mamsie, what shall we do?"" Polly clasped her hands in despair, and looked down on Phronsie, sleeping away as if she meant to take her own time to wake up, regardless of sunrise on the Rigi. ""O dear me, and she went to bed so early last night on purpose.""""You go right along, Polly,"" said Mother Fisher. ""Put on your golf cape over your jacket, child, it's dreadfully cold out there. I shall stay with Phronsie, for of course we wouldn't leave her alone with Matilda, and all go off for a nice time."""
"""O dear me!"" exclaimed Polly, ""I didn't mean to disobey, Mamsie, I really didn't; I'll go."" And setting a kiss on Mother Fisher's black hair, she ran out on unsteady feet, and with all her comfort gone.When she joined her group it would have been rather hard to distinguish any of them, as everybody was wrapped up in shawls and rugs, if Jasper hadn't been a sort of scout in waiting for her and Mrs. Fisher and Phronsie. And Tom could easily be picked out, for he hung around in Jasper's wake, and besides, he was so very big.""O dear me,"" said Jasper, quite gone in sympathy. Tom Selwyn poked his head forward to hear, but, as it was something quite beyond his powers to help, he thrust his hands into his pockets, and kicked aimlessly on the floor.Little Dr. Fisher, muffled up in a big plaid shawl so that only his spectacles gleamed in between the folds and his cap, suddenly edged up back of Polly, and dropped the folds away from his ears so that he could hear what was going on. And when the group hurried out of the door, into the cold gray dawn, he was skipping down to his wife's room, in the liveliest way imaginable.""Oh, Jasper, I can't tell him,"" gasped Polly, up on the tiptop bunch of rocks, and trying to be glad of the promise of the beautiful sunrise to come, for everybody agreed that it was apparently to be the best one that had gladdened the hearts of travellers for years. Then she whirled around and stared with all her might, ""If there isn't Mamsie coming!""""As true as you live it is!"" cried Jasper, with a good look, and springing down the rocks to help her up. Tom Selwyn plunged after him, getting there first. So in the bustle, nobody answered Mr. King. And he, supposing from the merry chatter that Phronsie was in the midst of it, concluded it best not to interrupt their fun, even if he could make them hear.""Your father made me come, Polly,"" said Mrs. Fisher, coming up between the two boys. ""But I'd so much rather that he saw it."" And her downcast face looked so very much like Polly, that Jasper thought matters hadn't bettered themselves any.Just then a little voice said, ""Oh, isn't that beautiful!"" And whirling around on her rock, Polly saw little Dr. Fisher staggering along with a big bundle in his arms, out of which was peering Phronsie's face.""Give her to me,"" cried Tom Selwyn, of course reaching there first, before either Polly or Jasper; and before Dr. Fisher quite knew how, Phronsie was perched on the broad shoulder, and Tom was prancing up the rocky path as easily as if a bird had lighted on his arm.Everybody echoed, ""Oh-oh!"" then stood hushed to silence. A rosy blush spread from peak to peak, and all the shadows fell away. Everything below, towns, villages, lakes, and forests, stood out in the clear cold dawn, and at last the sun burst forth in all his glory.""Didn't I, though?"" said Jasper; ""who could help it? Wasn't father pleased when he got up to us, Tom, to think you had Phronsie in such good shape? Phronsie, you're in luck,"" pinching as much of her toes as the bundle of blanket would allow; ""you've got the best place of any of us, up on that perch."""
"An hour later, Polly, who couldn't get to sleep again, for a nap before breakfast, went out to the little balcony window just outside her door, where she might sit and write in her journal, and meantime catch any chance view that the grey scudding clouds might afford. In this way she strove to work off the impatience possessing her for the beautiful hour to come after breakfast. ""I can hardly believe it now,"" she thought, and she gave herself a little pinch to see if she were really awake; ""it seems too good to be true to think that the great Professor Bauricke is actually going to tell me how to learn to play well!""""Oh, will you help me? The land! I couldn't set when I'm in such trouble,"" declared the old woman. ""My senses, I should fly off the handle!"" Polly, feeling that she was in the presence of some dreadful calamity, stood quite still. ""You see, me and my sister--she's in highstrikes now in there."" The old woman tossed her head to indicate a room further down the hall, whereat the cap-frills flapped wilder than ever. ""Bein' as it belonged to both of us, she feels as bad as I do, but as I was the one that lost it, why it stands to reason I've got to shake around and get it again. Say, will you help me? You've got a pair of bright eyes as ever I see in a head; and what's the good of 'em if you can't help in trouble like this?""""Don't you know?"" cried the old woman, impatiently. ""Mercy me! how many times shall I tell you? My buzzom pin; it was took of Pa when he was a young man and awful handsome, and I didn't want to leave it in the room when we went out, cause somebody might get in, and they'd be sure to want it, so I pinned it on my nightcap strings and it's gone, and I a-gallivanting round on them rocks, a-looking at the sunrise, and I can see that to home all I want to. I must have been crazy.""""Of course,"" assented the old woman, impatiently. ""Land, your intellects ain't as bright as your eyes. My sakes!--how many times do you expect me to tell you? I've been a-looking and a-peeking everywhere, but my eyes are old, and I don't dare to tell any one to help me, for like enough they'd pick it up when I warn't seein', and slip Pa in their pocket, and I never'd see him again.""""She looks honest; I guess I hain't done no harm to tell her about our buzzom pin,"" said the old woman to herself as Polly disappeared. Mamsie being asleep, Polly could say nothing to her, but feeling that she would allow it if she knew, she threw on her things and ran out to meet the old woman, with a shawl tied over her nightcap and a big long cape on.""I tell you she's in highstrikes,"" said the old woman, going down the hall. ""That's our room, 37, an' I've seen you an' your folks goin' by, so I feel in some ways acquainted. An' if I don't find Pa, I'll be flabbergasted myself.""""Do let us hurry,"" said Polly, her mind now only on Pa. So they went down the stairs and out by the door and up the rocky path just where the old woman said she and sister Car'line took when they went out to see the sunrise."
"""An' I wish we'd kept in bed,"" ejaculated Polly's companion. ""I most lost my teeth out, they chattered so; and so did Car'line hers. But that wouldn't 'a' been nothin' to losin' Pa, cause we could 'a' got more teeth; but how could we 'a' got him took when he was nineteen and so handsome? There! here we stopped, just at this identical spot!""""My land sakes! I never see such a girl for wanting to be told over and over,"" exclaimed the old woman, irritably, picking up first one ample gaiter and then another to warm her cold toes in her hands. ""Haven't I told you he was awful handsome? Well, he had on his blue coat and big brass buttons for one thing, an' his shirt front was ruffled. And--""The old woman clutched her arm and held her fast. ""Don't you say a single word about any boys,"" she commanded. ""I hate boys,"" she exploded, ""they're the worry of our lives, Car'line and mine,--they get into our garden, and steal all our fruit, and they hang on behind our chaise when we ride out, and keep me a-lookin' round an' slashin' the whip at 'em the whole livelong time; O my--_boys!_""""What in the world is Polly Pepper doing up on those rocks?"" cried Jasper, just spying her. ""Come on, Tom, and let's see."" And they seized their caps, and buttoned their jackets against the wind which had just sprung up, and dashed off to see for themselves.And after a while, down came the two searchers--the old woman quite beside herself now, and scolding every bit of the way,--""that she didn't see what bright eyes were for when they couldn't find anything--an' now that Pa'd gone sliding down that mountain, they might as well give up, she an' Car'line""--when a sudden turn in the path brought the boys into view waiting behind the rocks. Then all her fury burst upon them.""See here, now,"" cried Tom, suddenly squaring up to her and looking at the face between the nodding cap-frills, ""we are ready to take a certain amount of abuse, my friend and I, but we won't stand more, I can tell you.""""Was it an old fright with a long nose in a blue coat and ruffles, and as big as a turnip?"" he asked between the shouts. While Polly tried to say, ""Yes, I guess so,"" and Miss Car'line's sister so far overcame her aversion to boys as to seize him by the arm, Tom shook her off like a feather. ""See here, old party,"" he cried, ""that ancient pin of yours is reposing in the hotel office at this blessed moment. Jasper and I,"" indicating his friend, ""ran across it on the rocks up there more than an hour ago, and--"" They had been days at dear Interlaken, walking up and down the _Hoheweg_, of which they never tired, or resting on the benches under the plane and walnut trees opposite their hotel, just sitting still to gaze their fill upon the _Jungfrau_. This was best of all--so Polly and Jasper thought; and Phronsie was content to pass hour after hour there, by Grandpapa's side, and imagine all sorts of pretty pictures and stories in and about the snow-clad heights of the majestic mountain.And the throng of gaily dressed people sojourning in the big hotels, and the stream of tourists, passed and repassed, with many a curious glance at the stately, white-haired old gentleman and the little yellow-haired girl by his side.Mr. King's party had made one or two pleasant little journeys to the Lauterbrunnen Valley, staying there and at Mürren, and to Grindelwald as well; but they came back to sit on the benches by the walnut and the plane trees, in front of the matchless Jungfrau. ""And this is best of all,"" said Polly."
"""In that case, Mrs. Fisher,""--old Mr. King looked down the table-length to Mamsie,--""we must go too; for I don't intend to lose sight of these nice travelling companions until I am obliged to."" Tom's face was one big smile. ""Oh, goody!"" exclaimed Polly, as if she were no older than Phronsie.""You just wait till you get to Zermatt,"" whispered Polly to Phronsie, who, under cover of the talk buzzing around the table, had confided to her that she didn't want to leave her beautiful mountain. ""Grandpapa is going to take us up to the Gorner Grat, and there you can see another mountain,--oh, so near! he says it seems almost as if you could touch it. And it's all covered with snow, Phronsie, too!""""Oh, I suppose so,"" answered Polly, carelessly. Then she looked up and caught Mamsie's eye, and turned back quickly. ""At any rate, Phronsie, it's all peaked on the top--oh, almost as sharp as a needle--and it seems to stick right into the blue sky, and there are lots and lots of other mountains--oh, awfully high,--and the sun shines up there a good deal, and it's too perfectly lovely for anything, Phronsie Pepper.""""It seems as if the whole world were at Zermatt,"" said the parson, looking out from the big piazza crowded with the hotel people, out to the road in front, with every imaginable tourist passing and repassing. Donkeys were being driven up, either loaded down to their utmost with heavy bags and trunks, or else waiting to receive on their patient backs the heavier people. Phronsie never could see the poor animals, without such distress coming in her face that every one in the party considered it his or her bounden duty to comfort and reassure her. So this time it was Tom's turn to do so.""Yes, indeed,"" said Tom, with a gusto, as if he wished he were a donkey, and in just that very spot, ""it gives them a chance to see things, and to hear things, too, don't you know?"" went on Tom, at his wits' end to know how he was going to come out of his sentences.""And so,"" ran on Tom, ""why, we mustn't worry, you and I, if the donkey doesn't. Just think,""--he made a fine diversion by pointing with his knife-blade up to the slender spire of the Matterhorn--""we're going up on a little jaunt to-morrow, to look into that fellow's face.""""No, I won't; it's safe to promise that,"" he said grimly, with a little laugh. ""Good reason why; because I can't. The little mother wouldn't sleep nights just to think of it, and I promised the granddaddy that I wouldn't so much as think of it, and here I am breaking my word; but I can't help it."" He twitched his knife out suddenly, sprawled off from the railing, and took several hasty strides up and down the piazza.""Well, that's all right, Phronsie,"" he said, coming back to get astride the railing again; this time he turned a cold shoulder on Phronsie's ""white needle."" ""Now, to-morrow, we'll have no end of fun."" And he launched forth on so many and so varied delights, that Phronsie's pleased little laugh rang out again and again, bringing rest to many a wearied traveller, tired with the sights, sounds, and scenes of a European journey.""Well, at least,"" said Tom, joining in the laugh, ""you must acknowledge, too, that I go off by myself and pick up my wild flowers and green things, and I'm not bothering round focussing every living thing and pointing my little machine at every freak in nature that I see.""And Phronsie wanted to stay at the Riffelberg just as much; and old Mr. King was on the point of saying, ""Well, we'll come up here for a few days, Phronsie,"" when he remembered Mrs. Selwyn and her boy, and how they must get on. Instead, he cleared his throat, and said, ""We shall see it after dinner, child,"" and Phronsie smiled, well contented.But when she reached the Corner Grat station, and took Grandpapa's hand, and began to ascend the bridle path to the hotel, she couldn't contain herself, and screamed right out, ""Oh, Grandpapa, I'd rather stay here."""
"""You are very much to be envied, sir. I can't help speaking to you and telling you so,"" said a tall, sober-looking gentleman, evidently an English curate off on his vacation, as he caught up with him on the ascent, where they had paused at one of the look-offs, ""for having that child as company, and those other young people.""""You say the truth,"" replied old Mr. King, cordially; ""from the depths of my heart I pity any one who hasn't some children to take along when going abroad. But then they wouldn't be little Peppers,"" he added, under his breath, as he bowed and turned back to the view.The plain, quiet face under the English bonnet turned to Mrs. Fisher as they walked up the path together. ""I cannot begin to tell you what gratitude I am under to you,"" said Tom's mother, ""and to all of you. When I think of my father, I am full of thankfulness. When I look at my boy, the goodness of God just overcomes me in leading me to your party. May I tell you of ourselves some time, when a good opportunity offers for a quiet talk?""""I'd like nothing better,"" said Mother Fisher, heartily. ""If there is one person I like more than another, who isn't of our family, or any of our home friends, it's Mrs. Selwyn,"" she had confided to the little doctor just a few days before. ""She hasn't any nonsense about her, if she is an earl's daughter.""""Earl's daughter,"" sniffed the little doctor, trying to slip a collar button into a refractory binding. ""Dear me, now that's gone--no, 'tisn't--that's luck,"" as the button rolled off into a corner of the bureau-top where it was easily captured.""I guess you'll have to, wife, if it's done at all,"" he answered, resigning himself willingly to her hands; ""the thing slips and slides like all possessed. Well, now, I was going to say that I wouldn't hate a title so much, if there was a grain of common sense went along with it. And that Mrs. Selwyn just saves the whole lot of English nobility, and makes 'em worth speaking to, in my opinion.""And after they had their dinner, and were scattered in groups in the bright sunshine, sitting on the wooden benches by the long tables, or taking photographs, or watching through the big glass some mountain climbers on one of the snowy spurs of the Matterhorn, ""the good opportunity for a quiet talk"" came about.Tom's mother sat down well pleased, and folding her hands in her lap, this earl's daughter, mistress of a dozen languages, as well as mistress of herself on all occasions, began as simply and with as much directness as a child.""Well, you know my father. Let me tell you, aside from the eccentricities, that are mere outside matters, and easily explained, if you understood the whole of his life, a kinder man never lived, nor a more reasonable one. But it was a misfortune that he had to be left so much alone, as since my mother's death a dozen years ago has happened. It pained me much."" A shadow passed over her brow, but it was gone again, and she smiled, and her eyes regained their old placid look. ""I live in Australia with my husband, where my duty is, putting the boys as fast as they were old enough, and the little girls as well, into English schools. But Tom has always been with my father at the vacations, for he is his favourite, as of course was natural, for he is the eldest. And though you might not believe it, Mrs. Fisher, my father was always passionately fond of the boy.""""And here is where his eccentricity became the most dangerous to the peace of mind of our family,"" continued Mrs. Selwyn. ""My father seemed never able to discover that he was doing the lad harm by all sorts of indulgence and familiarity with him, a sort of hail-fellow-well-met way that surprised me more than I can express, when I discovered it on my last return visit to my old home. My father! who never tolerated anything but respect from all of us, who were accustomed to despotic government, I can assure you, was allowing Tom!--well, you were with him on the steamer,"" she broke off abruptly. The placid look was gone again in a flash."
"""Ah,""--the placid look came back as quickly--""that is my only comfort--that you did. For father told the whole, not sparing himself. Now he sees things in the right light; he says because your young people taught it to him. And he was cruelly disappointed because you couldn't come down to visit him in his home.""""And as he couldn't be turned from it, and his health is precarious if he is excited, why, there was nothing to be done about it. And then he insisted that Tom and I come off for a bit of a run on the Continent, the other children being with him. And as my big boy""--here a loving smile went all over the plain face, making it absolutely beautiful--""had worried down deep in his heart over the past, till I was more troubled than I can tell you, why, we came. And then God was good--for then we met you! Oh, Mrs. Fisher!""She drew her hands by a sudden movement away, and put them on Mother Fisher's shoulders. And then that British matron, rarely demonstrative with her own children, even, leaned over and kissed Polly's mother.""Well, it's perfectly splendid to travel to places where we can run and race,"" said Polly, in satisfaction, throwing herself down on the rocks. The others all doing the same thing, Mr. King and the Parson and Mrs. Henderson found them, and pretty soon the group was a big one. ""Well, well, we are all here together, no--where is Mrs. Gray?"" asked Mr. King, presently. ""Dear me, how the summer is going!"" mourned Polly, as they caught on the return journey the last glimpse of the roaring, tumbling Visp, and not all the craning of the necks could compass another view, as the cars drew them away from the rushing river.The magic word, ""Dresden,"" had unlocked visions of months of future delight, bringing back every word of dear Herr Bauricke; all the instruction he had given her, on those happy days at Lucerne, that Polly felt quite sure were engraven deep on her heart to last forever and ever.""I don't care,"" said Polly, recklessly, pushing back the little rings of brown hair from her brow, ""they'll be good enough, the pictures you are going to do, to put into the Louvre, anyway, Adela Gray.""Tom Selwyn had been very sober during all this merry chatter; and now in his seat across the narrow aisle, he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor. His mother looked over at him, and slipping out of her seat, went over to him. ""Any room here, Tom, for mother?"" she said.""Oh, you're the bulliest--I mean--excuse me--you're no end a brick--oh, I mean--I can't say what I mean,"" brought up Tom, in despair. And he ran one long arm around her neck very much to the detriment of her neat collar.When the news was circulated, as it was pretty soon, that the party was not to be broken into at all till Paris was a completed story, the jubilation was such as to satisfy even Tom. And as this particular party had the car entirely to themselves, it wasn't so very dreadful as it seems, and the elder members allowed indulgent smiles at it all.There, in the centre of the market-place, was a ring of little girls, hand-in-hand, singing a little French song, and going round and round in a circle. They were of all ages and sizes, the littlest one in a blue pinafore, being about three years of age, and so chubby she had to be helped along continually by a big girl, evidently her sister. This big sister stopped the ring game, every now and then, to kiss the round face by the side of her gown; an example that was followed by so many of the other girls, that the game seemed to be never quite finished. And once in a while, big sister would pick up the chubby, little, blue-pinafored maiden and carry her through a considerable portion of the game, then down she would put her on her two chubby feet, and away they all circled without any break in the proceedings at all."
"""Oh, they sha'n't!"" declared Polly. ""O dear me!"" as one boy drew near, on the side next to the travellers, and watching his chance, picked at a flying apron or two. But the ring of girls paid no more attention to him, than they had to any other outside matters, being wholly absorbed in the game. So Polly and the others breathed freely again.""They're jealous chaps,"" cried Tom, ""and are vexed because they can't get into the game! Hear them jeer!"" And his long arm went out and picked a jacket-end of an urchin, who, incautiously regarding such quiet travellers as not worth minding, had hovered too near, while trying to tease the girls.""Here, you, sir,"" cried Tom, with a bit of a shake, and a torrent of remarkably good French not to be disregarded; then he burst into a laugh. And the urchin laughed too, thinking this much better fun to tussle with the tall lad, than to hang around a parcel of girls. And presently a woman came and took little blue pinafore off, and then the rest of the girls unclasped their hands, and the ring melted away, and the game was over.Two or three days of rest at Martigny put everybody in good shape, and gave them all a bit of time to pick up on many little things that were behindhand. Tom looked over all his floral treasures, with their last additions made at the Riffelalp, and discarded such as hadn't pressed well. And Jasper and Polly rushed up to date with their journals, and wrote letters home; and Adela worked up her studies and sketches.Tom looked on silently when Polly and Jasper were scraping their pens in a lively fashion in the little writing room of the hotel. ""That's my third letter, Polly,"" announced Jasper, on the other side of the table. ""Now, I am going to begin on Joel's.""Tom cleared his throat, and tried to speak, but the words wouldn't come nicely, so he burst out, ""I say, I wish you'd write to my granddaddy, both of you,"" and then he stood quite still, and very red in the face.""Dare!"" said Tom, delighted to think that no terrible result had really ensued from his words, that after they were out, had scared him mightily. ""Oh, if you knew granddaddy!"" And he sank into a chair by the table, and played with the heap of picture postal cards that Polly was going to address next.""All right,"" said Polly, glad to think there was anything she could really do to please the little old earl, ""but would your mother like it, Tom?"" She stopped slowly in putting her unfinished letter into the little writing-case, and looked at him.""If you think there's a shadow of doubt on that score, I'd best run and ask her now."" Tom got himself out of the chair, and himself from the room, and in an incredibly short space of time, back there he was. ""My mother says, 'Thank Polly for thinking of it; it will do father more good than anything else could possibly do.'""""Yes, she did,"" said Jasper, uncomfortably. Then his face brightened, and he said, ""And she's right, Polly,"" while Polly fished a franc out of Joel's little money-bag that hung at her belt. ""Do get the stamps, please, Jasper, and put them on,"" as he took up her two letters. And she gave the bag a little pat for Joel's sake, wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch."
"""Dear me, you are dreadfully particular about taking two postage stamps, seems to me,"" said Adela, who had taken that time, as she hadn't any letters to write, to work up one of her studies from memory of the Visp.""I mean, the housekeeper--matron--conciergerie--whatever you call the gentle lady who runs this house--was fortunately at our desk where she has the pleasure of making up our bills, and I worked on her feelings till she parted with 'em,"" explained Tom.Phronsie, who hadn't heard what Polly said, her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter, and considering, since it was to be done, it was best to have it over with as soon as possible, fell to scribbling the letters as fast as she could, all of them running down hill.She spoke so sharply that Phronsie started, and a little drop of ink trembling on the point of her pen concluded to hop off. So it did and jumped down on the clean white paper to stare up at them all like a very bad black eye.Phronsie lifted her head where she had burrowed it under Polly's arm. When she saw that Polly's round cheeks were really quite pale, she stopped crying at once. ""Are you sick, Polly?"" she asked, in great concern.While they were wondering over this and were plunged further yet in dismay, Tom came dancing in, waving the unlucky sheet of the Round Robin over his head. ""My mother says,"" he announced in triumph, ""that father will get no end of fun over that if you let it go. It will cheer him up.""""Polly, you always do think of the best things!"" exclaimed Jasper, beaming at her, which made her try harder than ever to smile. ""I wouldn't feel so badly, Polly,"" he managed to whisper, when Phronsie was absorbed with her work; ""he'll like it probably just as father did the gingerbread boy.""""That's three times that boy has gone out,"" announced Adela, ""and he joggles the table awfully when he starts. And he made me cut clear into that edge. See, Polly."" She was trimming the third strip of paper, for the Round Robin was to be pasted together and rolled up when it was all done.""Aren't they so!"" cried Tom, in satisfaction, while Polly oh-ed and ah-ed, and Phronsie dropped her pen suddenly making a second blot; only as good fortune would have it, it was so near the edge that they all on anxious examination decided to trim the paper down, and thus get rid of it.When the letter was finally unrolled and read to Grandpapa, who strayed into the reading room to see what Phronsie was doing, it certainly was a beauty. Picture after picture, cut from railroad guide books, illustrated papers, and it seemed to Jasper gathered as if by magic, with cunning little photographs, broke up the letter, and wound in and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey.""Do,"" cried old Mr. King, in great satisfaction. So he put down the Round Robin, Adela crying out that she wanted her grandmother to see it; and Polly saying that Mamsie, and Papa-Doctor, and the Parson and Mrs. Henderson must see it; ""and most important of all,"" said Jasper, breaking into the conversation, ""Mrs. Selwyn must say if it is all right to go.""Tom bobbed his head and accepted this as a matter of course. ""That's the very reason she understands things like a shot--and knows how to take 'em,"" he said; ""and I tell you, Polly,"" he declared with a burst of confidence that utterly surprised him, ""I'd rather have my mother than any other company I know of; she's awful good fun!""""Take care!"" cried Jasper, as he ran after with Polly and Adela, ""if you dare to tear that, sir!"" while Phronsie at the big table laboured away on her letter, Grandpapa sitting by to watch the proceedings, with the greatest interest."
"Jasper kicked his heel impatiently against one of the pillars where the sweetbrier ran; then he remembered, and stopped suddenly, hoping nobody had heard. ""The best way to fix it is to go where we are put,"" he said at last, trying to speak pleasantly.Meanwhile the horses were being put in the carriages, the stable men were running hither and thither to look to buckle and strap, and a lot of bustle was going on that at any other time would have claimed the boys. Now it fell flat, as a matter of interest.""Halloo--k-lup!"" The drivers gave the queer call clear down in their throats, and hopped to their places on the three conveyances, and with a rattle and a flourish the horses now spun around the fountain in the little courtyard to come up with a swing to the veranda.""Now, then,"" said Grandpapa, who had been overseeing every detail, ""here we are,"" running his eyes over his party; ""that's right,"" in great satisfaction. ""I never saw such a family as I have for being prompt on all occasions. Well then, the first thing I have to do is to get you settled in these carriages the right way.""Old Mrs. Gray, the parson's wife and the parson, and little Dr. Fisher made the next load, and then Grandpapa, perfectly delighted that he had arranged it all so nicely, with Polly and Phronsie, climbed into the third and last carriage, while Tom swung himself up as a fourth.""They say it is a difficult thing to arrange carriage parties with success,"" observed Mr. King. ""I don't find it so in the least,"" he added, complacently, just on the point of telling the driver to give the horses their heads. ""But that is because I've such a fine party on my hands, where each one is willing to oblige, and--""""Oh, no,"" said Jasper; ""it's all fixed, and I'm going to stay here."" And despite all Tom could say, this was the sole reply he got. So back he went, and climbed into old Mr. King's carriage again, with a very rueful face.And the occupants of carriage number one saying the same thing, Grandpapa's conveyance bowled ahead; and he, well pleased to head the procession, felt some of his displeasure at the boy sitting opposite to him dropping off with each revolution of the wheels.Tom wilted miserably under the gaze that still seemed to go through and through him, and Polly looked off at her side of the carriage, wishing the drive over the _Tête Noire_ was all ended. Old Mr. King turned to Phronsie at his side.Polly drew a long breath. ""Something must be done,"" she decided. ""Oh, I know. Why, Grandpapa, we can change before we get to the halfway place,"" she cried suddenly, glad to think of something to say. ""Can't we? And then we can all have different places.""""The very thing!"" exclaimed Mr. King, his countenance lightening. ""Come, Tom, my boy, cheer up. I'll put Jasper and every one else in the right place soon. Here you, stop a bit, will you?""--to the driver."
"""Make him hold up, Tom!"" commanded Mr. King, sharply. And Tom knowing quite well how to accomplish this, Grandpapa soon stood up in the carriage and announced, ""In half an hour, or thereabout, if we come to a good stopping-place, I shall change some of you twelve people about in the carriages. Pass the word along.""""It had to be done,"" he said to himself, ""for the poor child has had no mother to teach her, and it will do her good."" But he felt sorry for himself to be the one to teach the lesson. And so they went over the _Tête Noire_ to catch the first sight of Mont Blanc.""Yes, I am,"" she cried, bobbing her yellow head. ""Grandpapa said so; he really did, Jasper. And I'm going to ride up that long, big mountain on my donkey."" She pointed up and off, but in the wrong direction.""And I'm going to ride my donkey,"" repeated Phronsie, caring little which way she was going, since all roads must of course lead to fairy-land, ""and we're going to see the water that's frozen, and Grandpapa says we are to walk over it; but I'd rather ride my donkey, Jasper,"" confided Phronsie, in a burst of confidence.""O dear me!"" exclaimed Jasper, with a little laugh, ""why, we've only just come, Phronsie! It won't be so very long before we'll be off. Goodness! the time flies so here, it seems to me we sha'n't hardly turn around before those donkeys will be coming into this yard after us to get on their backs.""But Phronsie thought the time had never dragged so in all her small life; and, although she went about hanging to Grandpapa's hand as sweet and patient as ever, all her mind was on the donkeys; and whenever she saw one,--and the street was full, especially at morning and in the late afternoon, of the little beasts of burden, clattering up the stony roads,--she would beg to just go and pat one of the noses, if by chance one of the beasts should stand still long enough to admit of such attention.""Oh, no, Phronsie,"" expostulated old Mr. King, when this pleasing little performance had been indulged in for a half a dozen times. ""You can't pat them all; goodness me, child, the woods are full of them,"" he brought up in dismay.""I hope I'm going to have that dear, sweet little one,"" cried Phronsie, giving up all her mind, since the soft noses couldn't be patted, to happy thoughts of to-morrow's bliss. ""See, Grandpapa,"" she pulled his hand gently, ""to ride up the mountain on.""But Phronsie had her own ideas on the subject, and though on every other occasion agreeing with Grandpapa, she saw good and sufficient reason why every donkey should be entirely different from every other donkey. And when, on the next morning, their procession of donkeys filed solemnly into the hotel yard, she screamed out, ""Oh, Grandpapa, here he is, the very one I wanted! Oh, may I have him? Put me up, do!""""He's the worst one of the whole lot,"" groaned Grandpapa, his eye running over the file, ""I know by the way he puts his vicious old feet down. Phronsie, here is a cunning little fellow,"" he added, artfully trying to lead her to one a few degrees better, he fondly hoped. But Phronsie already had her arms up by her particular donkey's neck, and her cheek laid against his nose, and she was telling him that he was her donkey, for she thought Grandpapa would say ""Yes."" So what else could he do, pray tell, but say ""Yes""? And she mounted the steps, and was seated, her little brown gown pulled out straight, and the saddle girth tightened, and all the other delightful and important details attended to, and then the reins were put in her overjoyed hands."
"She never knew how it was all done, seeing nothing, hearing nothing of the confusion and chatter, of the mounting of the others, her gaze fixed on the long ears before her, and only conscious that her very own donkey was really there, and that she was on his back. And it was not until they started and the guide who held her bridle loped off into an easy pace, by the animal's head, that she aroused from her dream of bliss as a sudden thought struck her. ""What is my donkey's name?"" she asked softly.""Oh, well, we'll find out,"" said Grandpapa. ""Here you, can't you tell the name of that donkey?"" he cried to the guide holding Phronsie's bridle. ""Oh, I forgot, he doesn't understand English,"" and he tried it in French.But this was not much better, for old Mr. King, preferring to use none but the best of French when he employed any, was only succeeding in mystifying the poor man so that he couldn't find his tongue at all, but stared like a clod till the old gentleman's patience was exhausted.At last Jasper, hearing what the trouble was, shouted out something from his position in the rear, that carried the meaning along with it, and Phronsie the next minute was delighted to hear ""Boolah,"" as the guide turned and smiled and showed all his teeth at her, his pleasure was so great at discovering that he could really understand.And so with fun and nonsense and laughter, as soon as they wound around by the little English church and across the meadows, and struck into the pine wood, the whole party of twelve, Grandpapa and all, began to sing snatches from the newest operas down to college songs. For Grandpapa hadn't forgotten his college days when he had sung with the best, and he had the parson on this occasion to keep him company, and the young people, of course, knew all the songs by heart, as what young person doesn't, pray tell! So the bits and snatches rolled out with a gusto, and seemed to echo along the whole mountain side as the procession of sure-footed animals climbed the steep curves.""Na--na,"" one of the guides ran up to her, shaking his head. Adela, fresh from her Paris school had all her French, of the best kind too, at her tongue's end, but she seemed to get on no better than Mr. King.""My French is just bad enough to be useful,"" laughed Jasper. So he untangled the trouble again, and made Adela see that she really must not pull at her bridle, but allow the donkey to go his own gait, for they were all trained to it.""We've all heard you talk French, Jasper, so you needn't feel so cut up if Polly should quote your Monsieur,"" cried Tom, who, strange to say, no matter how far he chanced to ride in the rear, always managed to hear everything.""That's because we are everlastingly turning a corner,"" he explained, when they twitted him for it, ""and as I'm near the end of the line I get the benefit of the doubling and twisting, for the front is always just above me. So don't say anything you don't want me to hear, old fellow,"" he sang out to Jasper on the bridle path ""just above,"" as Tom had said.""Oh, somebody take that child off,"" groaned old Mr. King, accepting the arm of the guide to help him dismount, ""for I can't. Every separate and distinct bone in my body protests against donkeys from this time forth and forevermore. And yet I've got to go down on one,"" he added ruefully.""Well, if you didn't go over the _Mer de Glace_, why, we couldn't any of us go,"" said Jasper, at his wits' end how to manage it without worrying his father, already extremely tired, he could see, ""and that's what we've come up for--""""Wait? Yes, indeed, every blessed one of us,"" declared his father. ""Goodness me, Jasper, what are you thinking of to ask such a question, after this pull up here? Why, we sha'n't stir from this place for an hour.""""I supposed we'd have to wait,"" said Jasper, rushing off over the rocks, feeling how good it was to get down on one's feet again, and run and race. And getting Polly and Tom and Adela, they ran down where the donkeys were tethered and saw them fed, and did a lot of exploring; and it didn't seem any time before an Alpine horn sounded above their heads, and there was Grandpapa, tooting away and calling them to come up and buy their woollen socks; for they were going to start."
"So they scrambled up, and picked out their socks, and, each seizing a pair in one hand and an alpenstock with a long, sharp spike on the end in the other, they ran off down the zigzag path to the glacier, two or three guides helping the others along. At the foot of the rocky path the four drew up.""They're better than a broken neck,"" observed Tom, just meaning to ask Polly if he could put hers on for her. But he was too slow in getting at it, and Jasper was already kneeling on the rocks and doing that very thing.""So am I, Pet,"" he cried, delighted to find that he was apparently as agile as the parson. No one could hope to equal little Dr. Fisher, who was here, there, and everywhere, skipping about among the rocks like a boy let loose from school.""Well, to say the truth, I did,"" answered old Mr. King, with a laugh. ""Now, Phronsie, sit down on that rock, and let the guide tie on your stockings."" So Phronsie's little blue stockings were tied on, and after Grandpapa had gallantly seen that everybody else was served, he had his pulled on over his boots and fastened securely, and the line of march was taken up.""Now be very careful,"" warned Grandpapa, ""and don't venture too near the edge,"" as he paused with Phronsie and the guide. The others, coming up, looked down into a round, green pool of water that seemed to stare up at them, as if to say, ""I am of unknown depth, so beware of me.""""That gives me the 'creeps,' Polly, as you say,"" Mrs. Henderson observed. ""Dear me, I shall never forget how that green water looks;"" and she shivered and edged off farther yet. ""Supposing any one _should_ fall in!""""Well, he'd go down right straight through the globe, seems to me,"" said Tom, with a last look at the pool as they turned off, ""It looks as if it had no end, till one would fetch up on the other side.""Before they reached the other side, the parson's wife had had that stocking pulled on six times, until at last, the guide, finding no more pleasure in a repetition of the performance, took a string from his pocket, and bunching up in his fist a good portion of the stocking heel, he wound the string around it and tied it fast, cut off the string, and returned the rest to his pocket.""Why do you tie up the heel?"" queried Mrs. Henderson. ""I should think it much better to secure it in front."" But he didn't understand, and the rest were quite a good bit in advance, and hating to give trouble, she went on, the stocking heel sticking out a few inches. But she kept it on her foot, so that might be called a success.The little Widow Gray was not going over the _Mauvais Pas_, neither was Mrs. Selwyn, as she had traversed it twice before. So, on reaching the other side, they were just about bidding good-by to the others, when, without a bit of warning, the parson's wife, in turning around, fell flat, and disappeared to the view of some of them behind a boulder of ice.All was confusion in an instant. The guides rushed--everybody rushed--pellmell to the rescue; Tom's long legs, as usual, getting him there first. There she was in a heap, in a depression of ice and snow and water.The little doctor swept them all to one side, as they seated her on one of the boulders of ice. ""Humph! I should think likely,"" at sight of the tied-up stocking heel. ""You stepped on that, and it flung you straight as a die and turned your foot completely over."""
"""Yes,"" said Mrs. Henderson. Then she saw the guide who had tied the stocking looking on with a face of great concern. ""Oh, don't say anything, it makes him feel badly,"" she mumbled, wishing her foot wouldn't ache so.Little Dr. Fisher was rapidly untying the unlucky stocking; and, whipping off the boot, he soon made sure that no ligaments were broken. Then he put on the boot and the woollen sock, being careful to tie it in front over the instep, and whipping out his big handkerchief he proceeded to bandage the ankle in a truly scientific way. ""Now, then, Mrs. Henderson, you are all right to take the walk slowly back to the hotel.""""I think Dr. Fisher ought to go with the other party; he will be needed there,"" Mrs. Selwyn was saying, in her quiet way. ""And I will bathe Mrs. Henderson's foot just as he says it should be done, so good-by,"" and any one looking down with a field glass from the Montanvert hotel, could have seen at this point, two parties, one proceeding to the _Mauvais Pas_ and the _Chapeau_, and the other of three ladies, the parson and a guide, wending their way slowly on the return across the crevasses. Notwithstanding all the glory of the shops, and the tempting array of the jewellery and trinkets of every description therein displayed, after a few days of sailing on the exquisite lake, and some walks and drives, Polly, down deep in her heart, was quite ready to move on from Geneva. And, although she didn't say anything, old Mr. King guessed as much, and broke out suddenly, ""Well, are you ready to start, Polly?""""Why, Polly, you haven't anything for yourself,"" Mother Fisher exclaimed, as Polly ran into her room and told the news--how Grandpapa said they were to pack up and leave in the morning. ""You haven't bought a single thing.""Mrs. Fisher regarded her keenly. ""Well, now, Polly,"" she said, decidedly, ""I shall go down and get that chain we were looking at. For you do need that, and your father and I are going to give it to you.""""Mamsie,"" exclaimed Polly, springing off the bed, and throwing her arms around her mother's neck, ""I shall love that chain, and I shall wear it just all the time because you and Papa-Doctor gave it to me.""""That's just because you are a boy,"" sniffed Adela. ""Oh, Polly, you ought to see the shops! When Mademoiselle has taken us into some, I declare I could stay all day in one. Such dreams of clothes and bonnets! You never saw such bonnets, Polly Pepper, in all your life!"" She lifted her hands, unable to find words enough.""Yes, and the Bois de Boulogne to drive in, that's elegant. Only Mademoiselle won't take us there very often. I wish I was rich, and I'd have a span of long-tailed, grey horses, and drive up and down there every day.""""We'll go there the first day, Polly,"" said Jasper, ""the Louvre, I mean. Well, here we are in Paris!"" And then it was all confusion, for the guards were throwing open the doors to the compartments, and streams of people were meeting on the platform, in what seemed to be inextricable confusion amid a babel of sounds. And it wasn't until Polly was driving up in the big cab with her part of Mr. King's ""family,"" as he called it, through the broad avenues and boulevards, interspersed with occasional squares and gardens, and the beautiful bridges here and there across the Seine, gleaming in the sunshine, that she could realise that they were actually in Paris.And the next day they did go to the Louvre. And Adela, who was to stay a day or two at the hotel with them before going back into her school, was very important, indeed. And she piloted them about, the parson and Mrs. Henderson joining their group; the others, with the exception of the little Widow Gray, who stayed at home to look over Adela's clothes, and take any last stitches, going off by themselves."
"""Oh!"" cried Polly, catching her breath, and standing quite still as she caught sight of the wonderful marble, instinct with life, at the end of the long corridor below stairs. ""Why, she's smiling at us,"" as the afternoon sunshine streamed across the lovely face, to lose itself in the folds of the crimson curtain in the background.""Oh, I haven't seen this half enough,"" began Polly, ""and I've wanted to for so long."" Then she glanced at Adela's face. ""Well, all right,"" she said, and turned off, to come directly into the path of Grandpapa, with Phronsie clinging to his hand, and the rest of his part of the ""family"" standing in silent admiration.""We thought we'd come here first,"" said old Mr. King. ""I don't mean to see anything else to-day. The Venus de Milo is quite enough for me. To-morrow, now, we'll drop in again, and look at some of the pictures.""""There is beauty enough in that statue,"" said a lady, who just passed them, to the gentleman with her, ""to satisfy any one; but living beauty after all is most appealing. Just look at that child's face, Edward.""So Evelyn and Edward continued to gaze at intervals at the living beauty, and Mr. King and his party were absorbed in the marble beauty; and Adela was running over in her mind how she meant to have Polly Pepper all to herself at the visit to the Louvre the next afternoon, when she would show her the pictures she specially liked.But they didn't any of them go to the Louvre that next day, as it happened. It was so beautifully bright and sunshiny, that Grandpapa said it would be wicked to pass the day indoors; so they had all the morning in a walk, and a sail on the Seine,--and that pleased Tom,--and all the afternoon, or nearly all, sitting up in state in carriages, driving up and down the Bois de Boulogne. And _that_ pleased Adela.And when they tired of driving, old Mr. King gave orders for the drivers to rest their horses. And then they all got out of the carriages, and walked about among the beautiful trees, and on the winding, sheltered paths.""It's perfectly lovely off there,"" said Polly, ""and almost like the country,"" with a longing glance off into the green, cool shade beyond. So they strolled off there, separating into little groups; Polly and Jasper in front, and wishing for nothing so much as a race.""Dear me! you are running!"" said Adela, who hadn't got it into her head what for, as she didn't connect the scream with any of their party. And she walked just as fast as she could to catch up with them. As that was impossible, she gave a hasty glance around the shrubbery, and seeing no one to notice her, she broke out into a lively run.""Yes, Phronsie,"" Grandpapa was saying, as the young people had left them, and the others had wandered off to enjoy the quiet, shady paths, ""this place was the old Fôret de Rouvray. It wasn't a very pretty place to come to in those days, what with the robbers and other bad people who infested it. And now let us go and find a seat, child, and I'll show you one or two little pictures I picked up in the shop this morning; and you can send them in your next letter, to Joel and David, if you like.""Old Mr. King took out his pocket-book, and had just opened it, when a man darted out from the thick shrubbery behind him, cast a long, searching glance around, and quick as lightning, threw himself against the stately old gentleman, and seized the pocket-book.Old Mr. King pointed without a word. And Polly and Jasper were close at hand. Polly flew to Phronsie, who was clinging to Grandpapa's hand, and wailing bitterly. ""What is it? Oh! what is it?"" cried Polly."
"Tom saw the fellow slink with the manner of one who knew the ins and outs of the place well,--now gliding, and ducking low in the sparser growth, now making a bold run around some exposed curve, now dashing into a dense part of the wood.A thud of fast-flying feet in his rear didn't divert him an instant from his game, although it might be a rescue party for the thief, in the shape of a partner,--who could tell? And realising, if he caught the man at all, he must do one of his sprints, he covered the ground by a series of flying leaps,--dashed in where he saw his prey rush; one more leap with all his might, and--""I have you!"" cried Tom.The man under him, thrown to the ground by the suddenness of Tom's leap on him, was wriggling and squirming with all the desperation of a trapped creature, when the individual with the flying footsteps hove in sight. It was Jasper. And they had just persuaded the robber that it would be useless to struggle longer against his fate, when the parson, running as he hadn't run for years, appeared to their view. And after him, at such a gait that would have been his fortune, in a professional way, was the little doctor. His hat was gone, and his toes scarcely seemed to touch the ground. He was last at the scene, simply because the news had only just reached him as he sauntered leisurely up to meet Mr. King in his promenade.He was a miserable-looking man--tall, thin, and stoop shouldered--they saw, when they got him on his feet. Unkempt and unwashed, his long, black hair hung around a face sallow in the extreme. And he shook so, as Tom and Jasper marched him back, escorted by the body-guard of the parson and the little doctor, that the two boys put their hands under his arms to help him along.At the words _sergents de ville_ the man shivered from head to foot, and wrenched his hands free from the boys' grasp to tear open his poor coat, and show a bare breast, covered with little, apparently, but the skin drawn over the bones. He didn't attempt to say anything.""Oh, my goodness!"" exclaimed old Mr. King, starting backward and putting up his hands to his face to shut out the sight. ""Cover it up, man--bless me--no need to ask him a question. Why, the fellow is starving.""His little children--four of them--his wife--all starving--hadn't a bit to eat since, he could scarcely say when, it seemed so very long ago since he had eaten last--it all came out in a torrent of words that choked him, and like the true Frenchman that he was, he gestured in a way that told the story with his face and his fingers, as well as with his tongue.A _sergent de ville_ strolled by and looked curiously at the group, but as Mr. King met his eye coolly, and the party seemed intelligent and well able to take care of themselves, it wasn't necessary to tender his services--if they were talking to a worthless vagabond.""Hum--hum--very bad case; very bad case, indeed!"" Mr. King was exploding at intervals, while the torrent was rushing on in execrable French as far as accent went. No one else of the spellbound group could have spoken if there had been occasion for a word. Then he pulled out the pocket-book again, and taking out several franc notes of a good size, he pressed them between the man's dirty fingers. ""Go and get something to eat,"" was all he said, ""and take care of the children."" And for the next few days Phronsie talked about the poor man, and wished they could see his children, and hoped he had bought them some nice things to eat, and worried over him because he was all skin and bones.And then Adela went back to school, happy in the thought of the little pile of sketches she had to show as her summer's work, and with ever so many studies and bits to finish up under Mademoiselle's direction; and little old Mrs. Gray, breathing blessings on Mr. King's head, departed for her English country home.So they wandered away by themselves, having the most blissful of times, and coming home to the hotel, they would gaily relate their adventures; and Phronsie would often carry a little parcel or two, which it was her greatest delight to do; and then the trail of big boxes would follow them as they were sent home to the hotel to tell of their experiences in the shops.""Do you mean a peasant doll to add to the collection?"" asked Polly; for old Mr. King had bought a doll in the national costume in every country in which they had travelled, and they had been packed away, together with the other things as fast as purchased, and sent off home across the sea."
"And sure enough, Mr. King, who knew exactly what kind of a doll he meant to purchase, and had kept his eyes open for it, stumbled upon it by a piece of rare good luck in a shop where he least expected to find it.""Well, I don't know but what you may,"" said Grandpapa, relenting. ""I will call a cab after we get through with this next shop,"" he reflected, ""and it won't hurt her to carry the doll that short distance."" So they came out of the shop, and deciding to take a short cut, they started across the boulevard, he taking the usual precaution to gather Phronsie's hand in his.As they were halfway across the street, with its constant stream of pedestrians and vehicles, a sudden gust of wind flapped the doll's pink silk cape up against Phronsie's eyes, and taking her hand away from Grandpapa's a second to pull down the cape, for she couldn't see, she slipped, and before she knew it, had fallen on top of the doll in the middle of the street.A reckless cabby, driving as only a French cabman can, came dashing down the boulevard directly in her path, while a heavily loaded omnibus going in the opposite direction was trying to get out of his way. Ever so many people screamed; and some one pulled Mr. King back as he started to pick her up. It was all done in an instant, and every person expected to see her killed, when a long, gaunt individual in a shabby coat dashed in among the plunging horses, knocked up the head of the one belonging to the reckless cabby, swung an arm at the other pair to divert their course, and before any one could quite tell how, he picked up Phronsie and bore her to the curbstone. Some one got Mr. King to the same point, too exhausted with fright to utter a word.When he came out of his shock, the shabby man was standing by Phronsie, the crowd that saw nothing in the incident to promise further diversion, having melted away, and she was holding his hand, her little, mud-stained face radiant with happiness. ""Oh, Grandpapa,"" she piped out, ""it's your poor man!""The shabby man hailed a cab, but the cabman jeered at him and whirled by. So the old gentleman held up his hand; Phronsie all this time, strange to say, not mentioning her doll, and Mr. King, who wouldn't have cared if a hundred dolls had been left behind, not giving it a thought. Now she looked anxiously on all sides. ""Oh, where is she, Grandpapa dear?"" she wailed, ""my child; where is she?""""But I want her--I can't go home without my child!"" And Phronsie's lip began to quiver. ""Oh, there she is, Grandpapa!"" and she darted off a few steps, where somebody had set the poor thing on the pavement, propped up against a lamp-post.""Oh, you can't carry her home,"" said Mr. King, in dismay at the muddy object splashed from head to foot, with the smart pink cape that had been the cause of the disaster, now torn clear through the middle, by the hoof of a passing horse. He shuddered at the sight of it. ""Do leave it, Phronsie, child.""""Oh, Grandpapa!"" screamed Phronsie, skipping up and down and clapping her muddy little hands, then she picked up the doll and lifted it toward him. ""Give my child to your little girl, and tell her to take good care of it,"" she said.As Phronsie's French had long been one of Grandpapa's special responsibilities in the morning hours, she spoke it nearly as well as Polly herself, so the man grasped the doll as he had seized the money before.This last was brought out by an excited individual rushing up over the curbstone to get out of the way of a passing dray, and the walking-stick which he swung aloft as a protection, coming into collision with Mr. King's hat, knocked it over his eyes.""It surely does look bad,"" said the old gentleman to himself as he stepped into the cab with Phronsie; ""that man's children are a myth. And I wanted to do something for them, for he saved Phronsie's life!"""
"This being the only idea he could possibly retain all the way home to the hotel, he held her closely within his arm, Phronsie chattering happily all the way, how the little girl she guessed was just receiving the doll, and wondering what name she would give it, and would she wash its face clean at once, and fix the torn and muddy clothes?""Oh, yes, yes, I hope so,"" answered Grandpapa, when she paused for an answer. Jasper came running out as the cab drove into the court. ""Oh!"" he exclaimed, at sight of Phronsie's face, then drove the words on his tongue back again, as he lifted her out.And for the following days, Mr. King never let Phronsie out of his sight. A new and more splendid doll, if possible, was bought, and all sorts and styles of clothes for it, which Phronsie took the greatest delight in caring for, humming happily to herself at the pleasure the poor man's little girl was taking at the same time with her other child.""Grandpapa,"" she said, laying down the doll carefully on the sofa, and going over to the table where Mr. King had just put aside the newspaper, ""I do wish we could go and see that poor man and all his children--why didn't he tell us where he lived?""""The dickens!"" exclaimed old Mr. King, unguardedly, ""because the fellow is an impostor, Phronsie. He saved your life,"" and he seized Phronsie and drew her to his knee, ""but he lied about those children. O dear me!"" And he pulled himself up.""Oh, well, he knew enough what I wanted,"" said Mr. King, who, now that he had let out his belief, was going to support it by all the reasons in his power. ""No, no, Phronsie, it won't do; the fellow was an impostor, and we must just accept the fact, and make the best of it, my child.""""Grandpapa,"" said Phronsie, ""I've given away my child, and she's sick because she fell and hurt her, and there isn't any little girl, and--and--that poor man told a lie!"" And she flung herself up against Grandpapa's waistcoat, and sobbed as if her heart would break.""All you want to,"" promised Grandpapa, recklessly, and only too thankful to have something proposed for a diversion. ""The very thing,"" he added enthusiastically. ""Now, Polly and Phronsie, run and tell all the others to get ready, just as fast as they can, and we'll be off. Goodness me, Jasper, what makes you run into a room in this fashion?""When Mr. King comprehended that the man was found, and that he was ""all right,"" as Jasper vehemently repeated over and over, he communicated that fact to Phronsie, whose delight knew no bounds, and in less time than it takes to write it, Tom, who was the only one of the party to be collected on such short notice, had joined them, and they were bowling along in a big carriage, Jasper as guide, to the spot where the man was waiting.""You see it was just this way,"" Jasper was rapidly telling off. ""I was going down by the Madeleine, and I thought I would bring Phronsie some flowers; so I stopped at the market, and I couldn't find a little pot of primroses I wanted, though I went the whole length; and at last, when I had given up, I saw just one in front of a woman who sat at the very end.""""Well,"" said Jasper, ""I'll tell it as quickly as I can, father. And there were a lot of children, father, all round the woman where she sat on a box, and she was tying in a bunch some flowers that were huddled in her lap, and the children were picking out the good ones for her; and just then a man, who was bending over back of them all, breaking off some little branches from a big green one, straightened up suddenly, and, father, as true as you live,"" cried Jasper, in intense excitement, ""it was your poor man!""""Are all his,"" cried Jasper, ""and he took the money you gave him, and set his wife up in the flower business down in front of the Madeleine. Oh! and Phronsie, the doll you gave him was sitting up on another box, and every once in a while the littlest girl would stop picking out the flowers in her mother's lap, and would run over and wipe its face with her apron."" They were really on their way to see the little old earl, after all! How it came about, Mr. King, even days after it had all been decided, couldn't exactly remember. He recalled several conversations in Paris with Tom's mother, who showed him bits of letters, and one in particular that somehow seemed to be a very potent factor in the plan that, almost before he knew it, came to be made. And when he held out, as hold out he did against the acceptance of the invitation, he found to his utmost surprise that every one, Mother Fisher and all, was decidedly against him."
"""Oh, well,"" he had declared when that came out, ""I might as well give in gracefully first as last."" And he sat down at once and wrote a very handsome note to the little old earl, and that clinched the whole business.And after the week of this visit should be over, for old Mr. King was firmness itself on not accepting a day more, they were to bid good-by to Mrs. Selwyn and Tom, and jaunt about a bit to show a little of Old England to the Hendersons, and then run down to Liverpool to see them off, and at last turn their faces toward Dresden, their winter home--""and to my work!"" said Polly to herself in delight.An old woman, in an immaculate cap and a stiff white apron over her best linsey-woolsey gown which she had donned for the occasion, came out of the lodge and courtesied low to the madam, and held open the big gate.Hobson, who knew very well what Master Tom's fastest gait was, preferred to drive through the park at what he considered the dignified pace. So they rolled on under the stately trees, going miles, it seemed to Polly, who sat on the back seat with Tom.He turned to her, unable to conceal his impatience. ""Anybody would think this pair were worn out old cobs,"" he fumed. ""Polly, you have no idea how they can go, when Hobson lets them out. What are you wasting all this time for, crawling along in this fashion, Hobson, when you know we want to get on?""""Not often,"" said Tom, ""we mostly ride after the fox. You'll ride with the hounds, Polly,"" he cried with enthusiasm. ""We'll have a hunt while you're here, and we always wind up with a breakfast, you know. Oh, we'll have no end of sport."" He hugged his long arms in huge satisfaction.And away--and away over the winding road and underneath the stately trees, rolled the big coach, to be followed by the other carriages, like a dream it seemed to Polly, and more than ever, when at last they stopped in front of a massive pile of buildings with towers and arches and wings.And the little old earl was kissing her rosy cheek in the most courtly fashion, and saying while he shook her hand in his long fingers, ""And how do you do, my dear?"" And Mrs. Selwyn was by his other side. And Tom was screeching out, ""How do you do, Granddaddy!"" And then, ""Oh, Elinor and Mary!"" to two quiet, plain-looking girls standing in the background. And ""Ah, how d'ye kids!"" as the faces of his two small brothers appeared. And Polly forgot all about the fact that she was in an earl's house, and she laughed and chatted; and in two minutes one of Tom's sisters was on either side of her, and the small boys in front, and the little groups were moving in and out of the old hall, as Grandpapa and the rest came in, and the head housekeeper in a black silk gown that seemed quite able to stand alone, and a perfect relay of stiff figures in livery were drawn up underneath the armour hanging on the wall.But the next morning--oh, the next morning!--when Polly tried to compass as much of the thronging attractions as she could, and Jasper was at his wits' end whenever he was appealed to, to decide what he wanted to do first--""cricket,"" or ""punting on the river,"" that ran through the estate, or ""riding through the park, and to the village owned by his grandfather""? ""I always go see the tenantry as soon as I get home,"" said Tom, simply.""So she must--so she must, I was sure of it,"" cried the little old earl, with a series of chuckles. And he busied himself especially with seeing her mounted properly when the party gathered on the lawn in front of the old hall. The hounds were baying and straining at the leashes, impatient to be off; the pink hunting-coats gave dashes of colour as their owners moved about over the broad green sward,--under the oaks,--and Polly felt her heart beat rapidly with the exhilarating sights and sounds. It was only when they were off, and Tom riding up by her side expatiated on the glory of running down the fox and ""being in at the death,"" that the colour died down on her cheek."
"""Oh, Tom!"" she said, reining in her horse. If he hadn't been the possessor of a good disposition, he certainly would have bolted in his disappointment at being pulled up so abruptly. ""It's so cruel to kill the poor fox in that way.""""To kill the fox in this way,"" said Polly, her heart sinking as she thought how dreadful it was for her to object, when visiting, to anything her host might plan. ""O dear me!"" and she looked so distressed that Tom turned comforter at once.""It's so cruel,"" cried Polly, turning to Jasper, with a little pink spot coming in either cheek. ""I ought to have thought of it before, but I didn't; it only seemed so very splendid to be rushing along with the horses and dogs. But to chase that poor fox to death--O dear me!""""We'll go back,"" suggested Tom, in distress; ""don't be afraid, Polly, I'll make it all right with granddaddy."" He concealed as best he might his awful disappointment as the echoes of the horn, the baying of the dogs, and now and then a scrap of chatter or a peal of laughter was borne to them on the wind.""Too bad, Polly, you weren't in at the death,"" said the little old earl, sympathisingly, when at the hunt-breakfast following, the brush dangling to a victorious young lady's belt, had been admired as an extremely fine one. ""Never mind; better luck next time, little girl.""But the fête to the tenantry, oh! that was something like, and more to Polly's taste, when this annual affair, postponed while Tom's mother and Tom were away, took place. For days before, the preparations had been making, the stewards up to their eyes in responsibility to carry out the plans of the little old earl, who meant on this occasion to outdo all his former efforts, and show his American friends how an Englishman treats those under his care.Oh, the big joints of beef, the haunches of venison, the fowls, the meat pies and the gooseberry tarts, the beer and the ale, and the tea for the old women, with nuts and sweeties for the children! Oh, Polly knew about it all, as she went about with the little old earl while he gave his orders, her hand in his, just as if she were no older than Phronsie, and not such a tall, big girl.And Mrs. Selwyn was busy as a bee, and Mother Fisher was just in her element here, in helping her; for flannel petticoats were to be given out, and stuff frocks, and pieces of homespun, and boots and shoes, as prizes for diligent and faithful service; or an order for coals for the coming winter for some poor cottager, or packages of tea, or some other little comfort. And before any of them quite realised it, the days flew by, and in two more of them the King party would be off.""It's perfectly useless to mention it,"" said the little old earl, quite confident in his power to influence old Mr. King to remain when he saw how happily everything was running on. ""My dear sir, you were asked for a fortnight.""""And I accepted for a week,"" retorted Mr. King, ""and I go when that time is up. We've had a visit--I can't express it to you, what a fine time--as near to perfection as it is possible for a visit to be; but day after to-morrow we surely must leave.""Tom was so despondent, as well as the old earl, that it was necessary to cheer him up in some way. ""Just think what a splendid thing for us to be in the midst of that fête for the peasantry,"" exclaimed Polly, with sparkling eyes. ""It's quite too lovely for our last day.""""Oh, nothing could be finer,"" declared Polly, and Jasper joined. So Tom rushed off to the stables to give the orders. And Polly on Meteor was soon flying up and down with the boys, and Elinor and Mary. And the two small lads trotted after on their Shetland ponies, in and out the winding roads of the park confines, without any haunting fear of a poor red fox to be done to death at the end."
