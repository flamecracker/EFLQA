passage
"She had no father and mother, so she had to live with a horrid cross old woman called Black Noggy, who used to scold her every day, and sometimes beat her with a stick, even though she had done nothing naughty.So Little Black Mingo took the chatty and ran down to the river as fast as she could, and began to fill it with water, when Cr-r-rrrack!!! Bang!!! a horrible big Mugger poked its nose up through the bottom of the chatty and said ""Ha ha! Little Mingo, I'm going to eat you up!""Little Black Mingo did not say anything. She turned and ran away as fast as ever she could, and the Mugger ran after her. But the broken chatty round his neck caught his paws, so he could not overtake her.But when she got back to Black Noggy, and told her how the Mugger had broken the chatty, Black Noggy was fearfully angry. ""You naughty girl,"" she said, ""you have broken the chatty yourself, I have a good mind to beat you."" And if she had not been in such a hurry for the water she _would_ have beaten her.Then she went and fetched the great big chatty that the dhobi used to boil the clothes in. ""Take this,"" said she, ""and mind you don't break it, or I _will_ beat you."" ""But I can't carry that when it is full of water,"" said Little Black Mingo.So Little Black Mingo took the dhobi's great big chatty, and started again to go to the river. But first she went to a little bank above the river, and peeped up and down, to see if she could see the old Mugger anywhere. But she could not see him, for he was hiding under the very bank she was standing on, and though his tail stuck out a little she never saw him at all.So Little Black Mingo crept down to the river, and began to fill the big chatty with water. And while she was filling it the Mugger came creeping softly down behind her and caught her by the tail, saying, ""Aha, Little Black Mingo, now I've got you.""""What will you give me, if I don't eat you up?"" said the Mugger. But Little Black Mingo was so poor she had nothing to give. So the Mugger caught her in his great cruel mouth and swam away with her to an island in the middle of the river and set her down beside a huge pile of eggs.Presently she heard a queer little squeaky noise that sounded like ""Squeak, Squeak, Squeak!!! Oh Little Black Mingo, help me or I shall be drowned."" She got up and looked to see what was calling, and she saw a bush coming floating down the river with something wriggling and scrambling about in it, and as it came near she saw that it was a Mongoose that was in the bush. So she waded out as far as she could, and caught hold of the bush and pulled it in, and the poor Mongoose crawled up her arm on to her shoulder, and she carried him to shore.""I'm not afraid of Muggers!"" said the Mongoose; and he sat down and began to crack the eggs, and eat the little muggers as they came out. And he threw the shells into the water, so that the old Mugger should not see that any one had been eating them. But he was careless, and he left one eggshell on the edge, and he was hungry and he ate so many that the pile got much smaller, and when the old Mugger came back he saw at once that some one had been meddling with them."
