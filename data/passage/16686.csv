passage
"P.S. It is so tiresome! Jack wants to build a green-house now, He has found some bits of broken glass, and an old window-frame, and he says he knows how. I tell him there's not glass enough, but he says there's lots, And he's taken all the plants that belong to the bed and put them in pots. We meant to be very kind, But if ever we find Another soft, grey-green, moss-coated, feather-lined nest in a hedge, We have taken a pledge-- Susan, Jemmy, and I--with remorseful tears, at this very minute, That if there are eggs or little birds in it-- Robin or wren, thrush, chaffinch or linnet-- We'll leave them there To their mother's care. There were three of us--Kate, and Susan, and Jem-- And three of them-- I don't know _their_ names, for they couldn't speak, Except with a little imperative squeak, Exactly like Poll, Susan's squeaking doll; But squeaking dolls will lie on the shelves For years and never squeak of themselves: The reason we like little birds so much better than toys Is because they are _really_ alive, and know how to make a noise. There were three of us, and three of them; Kate,--that is I,--and Susan, and Jem. Our mother was busy making a pie, And theirs, we think, was up in the sky; But for all Susan, Jemmy, or I can tell, She may have been getting their dinner as well. They were left to themselves (and so were we) In a nest in the hedge by the willow tree; And when we caught sight of three red little fluff-tufted, hazel-eyed, open-mouthed, pink-throated heads, we all shouted for glee. The way we really did wrong was this: We took them for Mother to kiss, And she told us to put them back; Whilst out on the weeping-willow _their_ mother was crying ""Alack!"" We really heard Both what Mother told us to do, and the voice of the mother-bird. But we three--that is Susan and I and Jem-- Thought we knew better than either of them: And in spite of our mother's command and the poor bird's cry, We determined to bring up her three little nestlings ourselves on the sly. We each took one, It did seem such excellent fun! Susan fed hers on milk and bread, Jem got wriggling worms for his instead. I gave mine meat, For, you know, I thought, ""Poor darling pet! why shouldn't it have roast beef to eat?"" But, oh dear! oh dear! oh dear! how we cried When in spite of milk and bread and worms and roast beef, the little birds died! It's a terrible thing to have heart-ache, I thought mine would break As I heard the mother-bird's moan, And looked at the grey-green, moss-coated, feather-lined nest she had taken such pains to make, And her three little children dead, and as cold as stone. Mother said, and it's sadly true, ""There are some wrong things one can never undo."" And nothing that we could do or say Would bring life back to the birds that day. The bitterest tears that we could weep Wouldn't wake them out of their stiff cold sleep. But then, We--Susan and Jem and I--mean never to be so selfish, and wilful, and cruel again. And we three have buried those other three In a soft, green, moss-covered, flower-lined grave at the foot of the willow tree. And all the leaves which its branches shed We think are tears because they are dead. Hear me now, my hobby-horse, my steed of prancing paces! Time is it that you and I won something more than races. I have got a fine cocked hat, with feathers proudly waving; Out into the world we'll go, both death and danger braving."
"Sally's very kind, for she praised our wash, and she has taken away Victoria's dress to do it again; and I really must say She was right when she said, ""You see, young ladies, a week's wash isn't all play."" Our backs ache, our faces are red, our hands are all wrinkled, and we've rubbed our fingers quite sore; We feel very sorry for Sally every week, and we don't mean to dirty our dresses so much any more. Father is building a new house, but I've had one given to me for my own; Brick red, with a white window, and black where it ought to be glass, and the chimney yellow, like stone. Brother Bill made me the shelves with his tool-box, and the table I had before, and the pestle-and-mortar; And Mother gave me the jam-pot when it was empty; it's rather big, but it's the only pot we have that will really hold water. We--that is I and Jemima, my doll. (For it's a Doll's House, you know, Though some of the things are real, like the nutmeg-grater, but not the wooden plates that stand in a row. _They_ came out of a box of toy tea-things, and I can't think what became of the others; But one never can tell what becomes of anything when one has brothers.) Jemima is much smaller than I am, and, being made of wood, she is thin; She takes up too much room inside, but she can lie outside on the roof without breaking it in. I wish I had a drawing-room to put her in when I want to really cook; I have to have the kitchen-table outside as it is, and the pestle-and-mortar is rather too heavy for it, and everybody can look. There's no front door to the house, because there's no front to have a door in, and beside, If there were, I couldn't play with anything, for I shouldn't know how to get inside. I never heard of a house with only one room, except the cobbler's, and his was a stall. I don't quite know what that is; but it isn't a house, and it served him for parlour and kitchen and all. Father says that whilst he is about it, he thinks he shall add on a wing; And brother Bill says he'll nail my Doll's House on the top of an old tea-chest, which will come to the same thing. Father's house is not finished, though the wing is; for now the builder says it will be all wrong if there isn't another to match; And my house isn't done either, though it's nailed on, for Bill took off the roof to make a new one of thatch. The paint is very much scratched, but he says that's nothing, for it must have had a new coat; And he means to paint it for me, inside and out, when he paints his own boat. There's a sad hole in the floor, but Bill says the wood is as rotten as rotten can be: Which was why he made such a mess of the side with trying to put real glass in the window, through which one can see. Bill says he believes that the shortest plan would be to make a new Doll's House with proper rooms, in the regular way; Which was what the builder said to Father when he wanted to build in the old front; and to-day I heard him tell him the old materials were no good to use and weren't worth the expense of carting away. I don't know when I shall be able to play at dolls again, for all the things are put away in a box; Except Jemima and the pestle-and-mortar, and they're in the bottom drawer with my Sunday frocks. I almost wish I had kept the house as it was before; We managed very well with a painted window and without a front door. I don't know what Father means to do with his house, but if ever mine is finished, I'll never have it altered any more. ""The breeze is on the Blue-bells, The wind is on the lea; Stay out! stay out! my little lad, And chase the wind with me. If you will give yourself to me, Within the fairy ring, At deep midnight, When stars are bright, You'll hear the Blue-bells ring-- D! DI! DIN! DING! On slender stems they swing. ""The rustling wind, the whistling wind, We'll chase him to and fro, We'll chase him up, we'll chase him down To where the King-cups grow; And where old Jack-o'-Lantern waits To light us on our way, And far behind, Upon the wind, The Blue-bells seem to play-- D! DI! DIN! DING! Lest we should go astray."
"""So gay that fairy music, So jubilant those bells, How days and weeks and months go by No happy listener tells! The toad-stools are with sweetmeats spread, The new Moon lends her light, And ringers small Wait, one and all, To ring with all their might-- D! DI! DIN! DING! And welcome you to night."" ""My mother made me promise To be in time for tea, 'Go home! go home!' the breezes say, That sigh along the lea. I dare not give myself away; For what would Mother do? I wish I might Stay out all night At fairy games with you. D! DI! DIN! DING! And hear the bells of blue. ""But Father sleeps beneath the grass, And Mother is alone: And who would fill the pails, and fetch The wood when I am gone? And who, when little Sister ails, Can comfort her, but me? Her cries and tears Would reach my ears Through all the melody-- D! DI! DIN! DING! Of Blue-bells on the lea."" The sun was on the Blue-bells, The lad was on the lea. ""Oh, wondrous bells! Oh, fairy bells! I pray you ring to me. I only did as Mother bade, For tea I did not care, And winds at night Give more delight Than all this noonday glare."" D! DI! DIN! DING! No sound of bells was there."
"""The snow lies o'er the Blue-bells, A storm is on the lea; Our hearth is warm, the fire burns bright, The flames dance merrily. Oh, Mother dear! I would no more That on that summer's day, Within the ring, The Fairy King Had stolen me away-- D! DI! DIN! DING! To where the Blue-bells play. ""Yet when the storm is loudest, At deep midnight I dream, And up and down upon the lea To chase the wind I seem; While by my side, in feathered cap, There runs the Fairy King, And down below, Beneath the snow, We hear the Blue-bells ring-- D! DI! DIN! DING! Such happy dreams they bring!"" When I go to tea with the little Smiths, there are eight of them there, but there's only one of me, Which makes it not so easy to have a fancy tea-party as if there were two or three. I had a tea-party on my birthday, but Joe Smith says it can't have been a regular one, Because as to a tea-party with only one teacup and no teapot, sugar-basin, cream-jug, or slop-basin, he never heard of such a thing under the sun. But it was a very big teacup, and quite full of milk and water, and, you see, There wasn't anybody there who could really drink milk and water except Towser and me. The dolls can only pretend, and then it washes the paint off their lips, And what Charles the canary drinks isn't worth speaking of, for he takes such very small sips. Joe says a kitchen-chair isn't a table; but it has got four legs and a top, so it would be if the back wasn't there; And that does for Charles to perch on, and I have to put the Prince of Wales to lean against it, because his legs have no joints to sit on a chair. That's the small doll. I call him the Prince of Wales because he's the eldest son, you see; For I've taken him for my brother, and he was Mother's doll before I was born, so of course he is older than me. Towser is my real live brother, but I don't think he's as old as the Prince of Wales; He's a perfect darling, though he whisks everything over he comes near, and I tell him I don't know what we should do if we all had tails. His hair curls like mine in front, and grows short like a lion behind, but no one need be frightened, for he's as good as good; And as to roaring like a real menagerie lion, or eating people up, I don't believe he would if he could. He has his tea out of the saucer after I've had mine out of the cup; You see I am sure to leave some for him, but if I let him begin first he would drink it all up. The big doll Godmamma gave me this birthday, and the chair she gave me the year before. (I haven't many toys, but I take great care of them, and every birthday I shall have more and more.) You've no idea what a beautiful doll she is, and when I pinch her in the middle, she can squeak; It quite frightened Towser, for he didn't know that any of us but he and I and Charles were able to speak. I've taken her for my only sister, for of course I may take anybody I choose; I've called her Cinderella, because I'm so fond of the story, and because she's got real shoes. I don't feel so _only_ now there are so many of us; for, counting Cinderella there are five,-- She, and I, and Towser, and Charles, and the Prince of Wales--and three of us are really alive; And four of us can speak, and I'm sure the Prince of Wales is wonderful for his size; For his things (at least he's only got one thing) take off and on, and, though he's nothing but wood, he's got real glass eyes. And perhaps in three birthdays more there may be as many of us as the Smiths, for five and three make eight; I shall be seven years old then (as old as Joe), but I don't like to think too much of it, it's so long to wait. And after all I don't know that I want any more of us: I think I'd rather my sister had a chair Like mine; and the next year I should like a collar for Towser if it wouldn't rub off his hair. And it would be very nice if the Prince of Wales could be dressed like a Field-marshal, for he's got nothing on his legs; And Cinderella's beautifully dressed, and Towser looks quite as if he'd got a fur coat on when he begs. Joe says it's perfectly absurd, and that I can't take a Pomeranian in earnest for my brother; But I don't think he really and truly knows how much Towser and I love each other. I didn't like his saying, ""Well, there's one thing about your lot,--you can always have your own way."" And then he says, ""You can't possibly have fun with four people when you have to pretend what they say."" But, whatever he says, I don't believe I shall ever enjoy a tea-party more than the one that we had on that day."
"Can any one look so wise, and have so little in his head? How long will it be, Papa Poodle, before you have learned to read? You were called Papa Poodle because you took care of me when I was a baby: And now I can read words of three syllables, and you sit with a book before you like a regular gaby. You've not read a word since I put you in that corner ten minutes ago; Bill and I've fought the battle of Waterloo since dinner, and you've not learned BA BE BI BO. Here am I doing the whole British Army by myself, for Bill is obliged to be the French; And I've come away to hear you say your lesson, and left Bill waiting for me in the trench. And there you sit, with a curly white wig, like the Lord Chief Justice, and as grave a face, Looking the very picture of goodness and wisdom, when you're really in the deepest disgrace. Those woolly locks of yours grow thicker and thicker, Papa Poodle. Does the wool tangle inside as well as outside your head? and is it that which makes you such a noodle? You seem so clever at some things, and so stupid at others, and I keep wondering why; But I'm afraid the truth is, Papa Poodle, that you're uncommonly sly. You did no spelling-lessons last week, for you were out from morning till night, Except when you slunk in, like a dirty door-mat on legs, and with one ear bleeding from a fight, Looking as if you'd no notion what o'clock it was, and had come home to see. But _your watch keeps very good meal-time_, Papa Poodle, for you're always at breakfast, and dinner, and tea. No, it's no good your shaking hands and licking me with your tongue,--I know you can do that; But sitting up, and giving paws, and kissing, won't teach you to spell C A T, Cat. I wonder, if I let you off lessons, whether I could teach you to pull the string with your teeth, and fire our new gun? If I could, you might be the Artillery all to yourself, and it would be capital fun. You wag your tail at that, do you? You would like it a great deal better? But I can't bear you to be such a dunce, when you look so wise; and yet I don't believe you'll ever learn a letter. Aunt Jemima is going to make me a new cocked hat out of the next old newspaper, for I want to have a review; But the newspaper after that, Papa Poodle, must be kept to make a fool's cap for you. ""In my young days,"" the grandmother said (Nodding her head, Where cap and curls were as white as snow), ""In my young days, when we used to go Rambling, Scrambling; Each little dirty hand in hand, Like a chain of daisies, a comical band Of neighbours' children, seriously straying, Really and truly going a-Maying, My mother would bid us linger, And lifting a slender, straight forefinger, Would say-- 'Little Kings and Queens of the May, Listen to me! If you want to be Every one of you very good In that beautiful, beautiful, beautiful wood, Where the little birds' heads get so turned with delight, That some of them sing all night: Whatever you pluck, Leave some for good luck; Picked from the stalk, or pulled up by the root, From overhead, or from underfoot, Water-wonders of pond or brook; Wherever you look, And whatever you find-- Leave something behind: Some for the Naïads, Some for the Dryads, And a bit for the Nixies, and the Pixies.'"" ""After all these years,"" the grandame said, Lifting her head, ""I think I can hear my mother's voice Above all other noise, Saying, 'Hearken, my child! There is nothing more destructive and wild, No wild bull with his horns, No wild-briar with clutching thorns, No pig that routs in your garden-bed, No robber with ruthless tread, More reckless and rude, And wasteful of all things lovely and good, Than a child, with the face of a boy and the ways of a bear, Who _doesn't care;_ Or some little ignorant minx Who _never thinks_. Now I never knew so stupid an elf, That he couldn't think and care for himself. Oh, little sisters and little brothers, Think for others, and care for others! And of all that your little fingers find, Leave something behind, For love of those that come after: Some, perchance, to cool tired eyes in the moss that stifled your laughter! Pluck, children, pluck! But leave--for good luck-- Some for the Naïads, And some for the Dryads, And a bit for the Nixies, and the Pixies!'"" ""We were very young,"" the grandmother said, Smiling and shaking her head; ""And when one is young, One listens with half an ear, and speaks with a hasty tongue; So with shouted Yeses, And promises sealed with kisses, Hand-in-hand we started again, A chubby chain, Stretching the whole wide width of the lane; Or in broken links of twos and threes, For greater ease Of rambling, And scrambling, By the stile and the road, That goes to the beautiful, beautiful wood; By the brink of the gloomy pond, To the top of the sunny hill beyond, By hedge and by ditch, by marsh and by mead, By little byways that lead To mysterious bowers; Or to spots where, for those who know, There grow, In certain out-o'-way nooks, rare ferns and uncommon flowers. There were flowers everywhere, Censing the summer air, Till the giddy bees went rolling home To their honeycomb, And when we smelt at our posies, The little fairies inside the flowers rubbed coloured dust on our noses, Or pricked us till we cried aloud for snuffing the dear dog-roses. But above all our noise, I kept thinking I heard my mother's voice. But it may have been only a fairy joke, For she was at home, and I sometimes thought it was really the flowers that spoke. From the Foxglove in its pride, To the Shepherd's Purse by the bare road-side; From the snap-jack heart of the Starwort frail, To meadows full of Milkmaids pale, And Cowslips loved by the nightingale. Rosette of the tasselled Hazel-switch, Sky-blue star of the ditch; Dandelions like mid-day suns; Bindweed that runs; Butter and Eggs with the gaping lips, Sweet Hawthorn that hardens to haws, and Roses that die into hips; Lords-with-their-Ladies cheek-by-jowl, In purple surcoat and pale-green cowl; Family groups of Primroses fair; Orchids rare; Velvet Bee-orchis that never can sting, Butterfly-orchis which never takes wing, Robert-the-Herb with strange sweet scent, And crimson leaf when summer is spent: Clustering neighbourly, All this gay company, Said to us seemingly-- 'Pluck, children, pluck! But leave some for good luck: Some for the Naïads, Some for the Dryads, And a bit for the Nixies, and the Pixies,'"""
"""I was but a maid,"" the grandame said, ""When my mother was dead; And many a time have I stood. In that beautiful wood, To dream that through every woodland noise, Through the cracking Of twigs and the bending of bracken, Through the rustling Of leaves in the breeze, And the bustling Of dark-eyed, tawny-tailed squirrels flitting about the trees, Through the purling and trickling cool Of the streamlet that feeds the pool, I could hear her voice. Should I wonder to hear it? Why? Are the voices of tender wisdom apt to die? And now, though I'm very old, And the air, that used to feel fresh, strikes chilly and cold, On a sunny day when I potter About the garden, or totter To the seat from whence I can see, below, The marsh and the meadows I used to know, Bright with the bloom of the flowers that blossomed there long ago; Then, as if it were yesterday, I fancy I hear them say-- 'Pluck, children, pluck, But leave some for good luck; Picked from the stalk, or pulled up by the root, From overhead, or from underfoot, Water-wonders of pond or brook; Wherever you look, And whatever your little fingers find, Leave something behind: Some for the Naïads, And some for the Dryads, And a bit for the Nixies, and the Pixies.'"" The following note was given in _Aunt Judy's Magazine_, June 1880, when ""Grandmother's Spring"" first appeared:--""It may interest old readers of _Aunt Judy's Magazine_ to know that 'Leave some for the Naïads and the Dryads' was a favourite phrase with Mr. Alfred Gatty, and is not merely the charge of an imaginary mother to her 'blue-eyed banditti.' Whether my mother invented the expression for our benefit, or whether she only quoted it, I do not know. I only remember its use as a check on the indiscriminate 'collecting' and 'grubbing' of a large family; a mystic warning not without force to fetter the same fingers in later life, with all the power of a pious tradition.""--J.H.E. Are you a Giant, great big man, or is your real name Smith? Nurse says you've got a hammer that you hit bad children with. I'm good to-day, and so I've come to see if it is true That you can turn a red-hot rod into a horse's shoe. Why do you make the horses' shoes of iron instead of leather? Is it because they are allowed to go out in bad weather? If horses should be shod with iron, Big Smith, will you shoe mine? For now I may not take him out, excepting when it's fine. Although he's not a real live horse, I'm very fond of him; His harness won't take off and on, but still it's new and trim. His tail is hair, he has four legs, but neither hoofs nor heels; I think he'd seem more like a horse without these yellow wheels. They say that Dapple-grey's not yours, but don't you wish he were? My horse's coat is only paint, but his is soft grey hair; His face is big and kind, like yours, his forelock white as snow-- Shan't you be sorry when you've done his shoes and he must go? I do so wish, Big Smith, that I might come and live with you; To rake the fire, to heat the rods, to hammer two and two. To be so black, and not to have to wash unless I choose; To pat the dear old horses, and to mend their poor old shoes. When all the world is dark at night, you work among the stars, A shining shower of fireworks beat out of red-hot bars. I've seen you beat, I've heard you sing, when I was going to bed; And now your face and arms looked black, and now were glowing red. The more you work, the more you sing, the more the bellows roar; The falling stars, the flying sparks, stream shining more and more. You hit so hard, you look so hot, and yet you never tire; It must be very nice to be allowed to play with fire. I long to beat and sing and shine, as you do, but instead I put away my horse, and Nurse puts me away to bed. I wonder if you go to bed; I often think I'll keep Awake and see, but, though I try, I always fall asleep. I know it's very silly, but I sometimes am afraid Of being in the dark alone, especially in bed. But when I see your forge-light come and go upon the wall, And hear you through the window, I am not afraid at all."
"I often hear a trotting horse, I sometimes hear it stop; I hold my breath--you stay your song--it's at the blacksmith's shop. Before it goes, I'm apt to fall asleep, Big Smith, it's true; But then I dream of hammering that horse's shoes with you! One of a hundred little rills-- Born in the hills, Nourished with dews by the earth, and with tears by the sky, Sang--""Who so mighty as I? The farther I flow The bigger I grow. I, who was born but a little rill, Now turn the big wheel of the mill, Though the surly slave would rather stand still. Old, and weed-hung, and grim, I am not afraid of him; For when I come running and dance on his toes, With a creak and a groan the monster goes. And turns faster and faster, As he learns who is master, Round and round, Till the corn is ground, And the miller smiles as he stands on the bank, And knows he has me to thank. Then when he swings the fine sacks of flour, I feel my power; But when the children enjoy their food, I know I'm not only great but good!"" Furthermore sang the brook-- ""Who loves the beautiful, let him look! Garlanding me in shady spots The Forget-me-nots Are blue as the summer sky: Who so lovely as I? My King-cups of gold Shine from the shade of the alders old, Stars of the stream!-- At the water-rat's threshold they gleam. From below The Frog-bit spreads me its blossoms of snow, And in masses The Willow-herb, the flags, and the grasses, Reeds, rushes, and sedges, Flower and fringe and feather my edges. To be beautiful is not amiss, But to be loved is more than this; And who more sought than I, By all that run or swim or crawl or fly? Sober shell-fish and frivolous gnats, Tawny-eyed water-rats; The poet with rippling rhymes so fluent, Boys with boats playing truant, Cattle wading knee-deep for water; And the flower-plucking parson's daughter. Down in my depths dwell creeping things Who rise from my bosom on rainbow wings, For--too swift for a school-boy's prize-- Hither and thither above me dart the prismatic-hued dragon-flies. At my side the lover lingers, And with lack-a-daisical fingers, The Weeping Willow, woe-begone, Strives to stay me as I run on."" There came an hour When all this beauty and love and power Did seem But a small thing to that Mill Stream. And then his cry Was, ""Why, oh! why Am I thus surrounded With checks and limits, and bounded By bank and border To keep me in order, Against my will? I, who was born to be free and unfettered--a mountain rill! But for these jealous banks, the good Of my gracious and fertilizing flood Might spread to the barren highways, And fill with Forget-me-nots countless neglected byways. Why should the rough-barked Willow for ever lave Her feet in my cooling wave; When the tender and beautiful Beech Faints with midsummer heat in the meadow just out of my reach? Could I but rush with unchecked power, The miller might grind a day's corn in an hour. And what are the ends Of life, but to serve one's friends?"" A day did dawn at last, When the spirits of the storm and the blast, Breaking the bands of the winter's frost and snow, Swept from the mountain source of the stream, and flooded the valley below. Dams were broken and weirs came down; Cottage and mill, country and town, Shared in the general inundation, And the following desolation. Then the Mill Stream rose in its might, And burst out of bounds to left and to right, Rushed to the beautiful Beech, In the meadow far out of reach. But with such torrents the poor tree died, Torn up by the roots, and laid on its side. The cattle swam till they sank, Trying to find a bank. Never more shall the broken water-wheel Grind the corn to make the meal, To make the children's bread. The miller was dead."
"Permit me, Reader, to make my bow, And allow Me to humbly commend to your tender mercies The hero of these simple verses. By domicile, of the British Nation; By birth and family, a Crustacean. One's hero should have a name that rare is; And his was _Homarus_, but--_Vulgaris!_ A Lobster, who dwelt with several others,-- His sisters and brothers,-- In a secluded but happy home, Under the salt sea's foam. It lay At the outermost point of a rocky bay. A sandy, tide-pooly, cliff-bound cove, With a red-roofed fishing village above, Of irregular cottages, perched up high Amid pale yellow poppies next to the sky. Shells and pebbles, and wrack below, And shrimpers shrimping all in a row; Tawny sails and tarry boats, Dark brown nets and old cork floats; Nasty smells at the nicest spots, And blue-jerseyed sailors and--lobster-pots. ""It is sweet to be At home in the deep, deep sea. It is very pleasant to have the power To take the air on dry land for an hour; And when the mid-day midsummer sun Is toasting the fields as brown as a bun, And the sands are baking, it's very nice To feel as cool as a strawberry ice In one's own particular damp sea-cave, Dipping one's feelers in each green wave. It is good, for a very rapacious maw, When storm-tossed morsels come to the claw; And 'the better to see with' down below, To wash one's eyes in the ebb and flow Of the tides that come and the tides that go."" So sang the Lobsters, thankful for their mercies, All but the hero of these simple verses. Now a hero-- If he's worth the grand old name-- Though temperature may change from boiling-point to zero Should keep his temper all the same: Courageous and content in his estate, And proof against the spiteful blows of Fate. It, therefore, troubles me to have to say, That with this Lobster it was never so; Whate'er the weather or the sort of day, No matter if the tide were high or low, Whatever happened he was never pleased, And not himself alone, but all his kindred teased. ""Oh! oh! What a world of woe We flounder about in, here below! Oh dear! oh dear! It is too, too dull, down here! I haven't the slightest patience With any of my relations; I take no interest whatever In things they call curious and clever. And, for love of dear truth I state it, As for my Home--I hate it! I'm convinced I was formed for a larger sphere, And am utterly out of my element here."" Then his brothers and sisters said, Each solemnly shaking his and her head, ""You put your complaints in most beautiful verse, And yet we are sure, That, in spite of all you have to endure, You might go much farther and fare much worse. We wish you could live in a higher sphere, But we think you might live happily here."" ""I don't live, I only exist,"" he said, ""Be pleased to look upon me as dead."" And he swam to his cave, and took to his bed. He sulked so long that the sisters cried, ""Perhaps he has really and truly died."" But the brothers went to the cave to peep, For they said, ""Perhaps he is only asleep."" They found him, far too busy to talk, With a very large piece of bad salt pork. ""Dear Brother, what luck you have had to-day! Can you tell us, pray, Is there any more pork afloat in the bay?"" But not a word would my hero say, Except to repeat, with sad persistence, ""This is not life, it's only existence."""
"I don't think I ever met with a book The evil genius of which was a cook; But it thus befell, In the tale I have the honour to tell; For as he was fretting and fuming about, A fisherman fished my hero out; And in process of time, he heard a voice, Which made him rejoice. The voice was the cook's, and what she said Was, ""He'll soon come out a beautiful red."" He was put in the pot, The water was very hot; The less we say about this the better, It was all fulfilled to the very letter. He did become a beautiful red, But then--which he did not expect--he was dead! Some gentle readers cannot well endure To see the ill end of a bad beginning; And hope against hope for a nicer cure For naughty heroes than to leave off sinning. And yet persisting in behaving badly, Do what one will, does commonly end sadly. But things in general are so much mixed, That every case must stand upon its merits; And folks' opinions are so little fixed, And no one knows the least what he inherits-- I should be glad to shed some parting glory Upon the hero of this simple story. It seems to me a mean end to a ballad, But the truth is, he was made into salad; It's not how one's hero should end his days, In a mayonnaise, But I'm told that he looked exceedingly nice, With cream-coloured sauce, and pale-green lettuce and ice. I confess that if he'd been my relation, This would not afford me any consolation; For I feel (though one likes to speak well of the dead) That it must be said, He need not have died so early lamented, If he'd been content to live contented. Ah! There you are! I was certain I heard a strange voice from afar. Mamma calls me a pup, but I'm wiser than she; One ear cocked and I hear, half an eye and I see; Wide-awake though I doze, not a thing escapes me. Yes! Let me guess: It's the stable-boy's hiss as he wisps down Black Bess. It sounds like a kettle beginning to sing, Or a bee on a pane, or a moth on the wing, Or my master's peg-top, just let loose from the string. Well! Now I smell, I don't know who you are, and I'm puzzled to tell. You look like a fly dressed in very gay clothes, But I blush to have troubled my mid-day repose For a creature not worth half a twitch of my nose. How now? Bow, wow, wow! The insect imagines we're playing, I vow! If I pat you, I promise you'll find it too hard. Be off! when a watch-dog like me is on guard, Big or little, no stranger's allowed in the yard. Eh? ""Come away!"" My dear little master, is that what you say? I am greatly obliged for your kindness and cares, But I really can manage my own small affairs, And banish intruders who give themselves airs. Snap! Yap! yap! yap! You defy me?--you pigmy, you insolent scrap! What!--this to my teeth, that have worried a score Of the biggest rats bred in the granary floor! Come on, and be swallowed! I spare you no more!"
"Help! Yelp! yelp! yelp! Little master, pray save an unfortunate whelp, Who began the attack, but is now in retreat, Having shown all his teeth, just escapes on his feet, And is trusting to you to make safety complete. Oh! Let me go! My poor eye! my poor ear! my poor tail! my poor toe! Pray excuse my remarks, for I meant no such thing. Don't trouble to come--oh, the brute's on the wing! I'd no notion, I'm sure, there were flies that could sting. Dear me! I can't see. My nose burns, my limbs shake, I'm as ill as can be. I was never in such an undignified plight. Mamma told me, and now I suppose she was right; One should know what one's after before one shows fight. Some Homes are where flowers for ever blow, The sun shining hotly the whole year round; But our Home glistens with six months of snow, Where frost without wind heightens every sound. And Home is Home wherever it is, When we're all together and nothing amiss. Yet Willy is old enough to recall A Home forgotten by Eily and me; He says that we left it five years since last Fall, And came sailing, sailing, right over the sea. But Home is Home wherever it is, When we're all together and nothing amiss. Our other Home was for ever green, A green, green isle in a blue, blue sea, With sweet flowers such as we never have seen; And Willy tells all this to Eily and me. But Home is Home wherever it is, When we're all together and nothing amiss. He says, ""What fine fun when we all go back!"" But Canada Home is very good fun When Pat's little sled flies along the smooth track, Or spills in the snowdrift that shines in the sun. For Home is Home wherever it is, When we're all together and nothing amiss. Some day I should dearly love, it is true, To sail to the old Home over the sea; But only if Father and Mother went too, With Willy and Patrick and Eily and me. For Home is Home wherever it is, When we're all together and nothing amiss."
"A little Brook, that babbled under grass, Once saw a Poet pass-- A Poet with long hair and saddened eyes, Who went his weary way with woeful sighs. And on another time, This Brook did hear that Poet read his rueful rhyme. Now in the poem that he read, This Poet said-- ""Oh! little Brook that babblest under grass! (_Ah me! Alack! Ah, well-a-day! Alas!_) Say, are you what you seem? Or is your life, like other lives, a dream? What time your babbling mocks my mortal moods, Fair Naïad of the stream! And are you, in good sooth, Could purblind poesy perceive the truth, A water-sprite, Who sometimes, for man's dangerous delight, Puts on a human form and face, To wear them with a superhuman grace? ""When this poor Poet turns his bending back, (_Ah me! Ah, well-a-day! Alas! Alack!_) Say, shall you rise from out your grassy bed, With wreathed forget-me-nots about your head, And sing and play, And wile some wandering wight out of his way, To lead him with your witcheries astray? (_Ah me! Alas! Alack! Ah, well-a-day!_) Would it be safe for me That fateful form to see?"" (_Alas! Alack! Ah, well-a-day! Ah me!_) So far the Poet read his pleasing strain, Then it began to rain: He closed his book. ""Farewell, fair Nymph!"" he cried, as with a lingering look His homeward way he took; And nevermore that Poet saw that Brook. The Brook passed several days in anxious expectation Of transformation Into a lovely nymph bedecked with flowers; And longed impatiently to prove those powers-- Those dangerous powers--of witchery and wile, That should all mortal men mysteriously beguile; For life as running water lost its charm Before the exciting hope of doing so much harm. And yet the hope seemed vain; Despite the Poet's strain, Though the days came and went, and went and came, The seasons changed, the Brook remained the same. The Brook was almost tired Of vainly hoping to become a Naïad; When on a certain Summer's day, Dame Nature came that way, Busy as usual, With great and small; Who, at the water-side Dipping her clever fingers in the tide, Out of the mud drew creeping things, And, smiling on them, gave them radiant wings. Now when the poor Brook murmured, ""Mother dear!"" Dame Nature bent to hear, And the sad stream poured all its woes into her sympathetic ear, Crying,--""Oh, bounteous Mother! Do not do more for one child than another; If of a dirty grub or two (Dressing them up in royal blue) You make so many shining Demoiselles,[3] Change me as well; Uplift me also from this narrow place, Where life runs on at such a petty pace; Give me a human form, dear Dame, and then See how I'll flit, and flash, and fascinate the race of men!"""
"Then Mother Nature, who is wondrous wise, Did that deluded little Brook advise To be contented with its own fair face, And with a good and cheerful grace, Run, as of yore, on its appointed race, Safe both from giving and receiving harms; Outliving human lives, outlasting human charms. But good advice, however kind, Is thrown away upon a made-up mind, And this was all that babbling Brook would say-- ""Give me a human face and form, if only for a day!"" Then quoth Dame Nature:--""Oh, my foolish child! Ere I fulfil a wish so wild, Since I am kind and you are ignorant, This much I grant: You shall arise from out your grassy bed, And gathered to the waters overhead Shall thus and then Look down and see the world, and all the ways of men!"" Scarce had the Dame Departed to the place from whence she came, When in that very hour, The sun burst forth with most amazing power. Dame Nature bade him blaze, and he obeyed; He drove the fainting flocks into the shade, He ripened all the flowers into seed, He dried the river, and he parched the mead; Then on the Brook he turned his burning eye, Which rose and left its narrow channel dry; And, climbing up by sunbeams to the sky, Became a snow-white cloud, which softly floated by. It was a glorious Autumn day, And all the world with red and gold was gay; When, as this cloud athwart the heavens did pass, Lying below, it saw a Poet on the grass, The very Poet who had such a stir made, To prove the Brook was a fresh-water mermaid. And now, Holding his book above his corrugated brow-- He read aloud, And thus apostrophized the passing cloud: ""Oh, snowy-breasted Fair! Mysterious messenger of upper air! Can you be of those female forms so dread,[4] Who bear the souls of the heroic dead To where undying laurels crown the warrior's head? Or, as you smile and hover, Are you not rather some fond goddess of the skies who waits a mortal lover? And who, ah! who is he? --And what, oh, what!--your message to poor me?""-- So far the Poet. Then he stopped: His book had dropped. But ere the delighted cloud could make reply, Dame Nature hurried by, And it put forth a wild beseeching cry-- ""Give me a human face and form!"" Dame Nature frowned, and all the heavens grew black with storm. But very soon, Upon a frosty winter's noon, The little cloud returned below, Falling in flakes of snow; Falling most softly on the floor most hard Of an old manor-house court-yard. And as it hastened to the earth again, The children sang behind the window-pane: ""Old woman, up yonder, plucking your geese, Quickly pluck them, and quickly cease; Throw down the feathers, and when you have done, We shall have fun--we shall have fun."" The snow had fallen, when with song and shout The girls and boys came out; Six sturdy little men and maids, Carrying heather-brooms, and wooden spades, Who swept and shovelled up the fallen snow, Which whimpered,--""Oh! oh! oh! Oh, Mother, most severe! Pity me lying here, I'm shaken all to pieces with that storm, Raise me and clothe me in a human form."" They swept up much, they shovelled up more, There never was such a snow-man before! They built him bravely with might and main, There never will be such a snow-man again! His legs were big, his body was bigger, They made him a most imposing figure; His eyes were large and as black as coal, For a cinder was placed in each round hole. And the sight of his teeth would have made yours ache, Being simply the teeth of an ancient rake. They smoothed his forehead, they patted his back, There wasn't a single unsightly crack; And when they had given the final pat, They crowned his head with the scare-crow's hat."
"And so The Brook--the Cloud--the Snow, Got its own way after so many days, And did put on a human form and face. But whether The situation pleased it altogether; If it is nice To be a man of snow and ice; Whether it feels Painful, when one congeals; How this man felt When he began to melt; Whether he wore his human form and face With any extraordinary grace; If many mortals fell As victims to the spell; Or if, As he stood, stark and stiff, With a bare broomstick in his arms, And not a trace of transcendental charms, That man of snow Grew wise enough to know That the Brook's hopes were but a Poet's dream, And well content to be again a stream, On the first sunny day, Flowed quietly away; Or what the end was--You must ask the Poet, I don't know it. Our home used to be in a hut in the dear old Camp, with lots of bands and trumpets and bugles and Dead Marches, and three times a day there was a gun, But now we live in View Villa at the top of the village, and it isn't nearly such fun. We never see any soldiers, except one day we saw a Volunteer, and we ran after him as hard as ever we could go, for we thought he looked rather brave; But there's only been one funeral since we came, an ugly black thing with no Dead March or Union Jack, and not even a firing party at the grave. There is a man in uniform to bring the letters, but he's nothing like our old Orderly, Brown; I told him, through the hedge, ""Your facings are dirty, and you'd have to wear your belt if my father was at home,"" and oh, how he did frown! But things can't be expected to go right when Old Father's away, and he's gone to the war; Which is why we play at soldiers and fighting battles more than ever we did before. And I try to keep things together: every morning I have a parade of myself and Dick, To see that we are clean, and to drill him and do sword-exercise with poor Grandpapa's stick. Grandpapa's dead, so he doesn't want it now, and Dick's too young for a real tin sword like mine: He's so young he won't make up his mind whether he'll go into the Artillery or the Line. I want him to be a gunner, for his frock's dark blue, and Captain Powder gave us a wooden gun with an elastic that shoots quite a big ball. It's nonsense Dick's saying he'd like to be a Chaplain, for that's not being a soldier at all. Besides, he always wants to be Drum-Major when we've funerals, to stamp the stick and sing RUM--TUM--TUM-- To the Dead March in _Saul_ (that's the name of the tune, and you play it on a drum). Mary is so good, she might easily be a Chaplain, but of course she can't be anything that wants man; She likes nursing her doll, but when we have battles she moves the lead soldiers about, and does what she can. She never grumbles about not being able to grow up into a General, though I should think it must be a great bore. I asked her what she would do if she were grown up into a woman, and belonged to some one who was wounded in the war,-- She said she'd go out and nurse him: so I said, ""But supposing you couldn't get him better, and he died; how would you behave?"" And she said if she couldn't get a ship to bring him home in, she should stay out there and grow a garden, and make wreaths for his grave. Nurse says we oughtn't to have battles, now Father's gone to battle, but that's just the reason why! And I don't believe one bit what she said about its making Mother cry. Only she does like us to put away our toys on Sunday, so we can't have the soldiers or the gun; But yesterday Dick said, ""I was thinking in church, and I've thought of a game about soldiers, and it's a perfectly Sunday one; It's a Church Parade: you'll have to be a lot of officers and men, Mary'll do for a few wives and families, and I'll be Chaplain to the Forces and pray for everyone at the war."" So he put his nightgown over his knickerbocker suit, and knelt on the Ashantee stool, and Mary and I knelt on the floor. I think it was rather nice of Dick, for he said what put it into his head Was thinking they mightn't have much time for their prayers on active service, and we ought to say them instead. I should have liked to parade the lead soldiers, but I didn't, for Mother says, ""What's the good of being a soldier's son if you can't do as you're bid?"" But we thought there'd be no harm in letting the box be there if we kept on the lid. Dick couldn't pray out of the Prayer-book, because he's backward with being delicate, and he can't read; So he had to make a prayer out of his own head, and I think he did it very well indeed. He began, ""GOD save the Queen, and the Army and the Navy, and the Irregular Forces and the Volunteers! Especially Old Father (he went out with the first draft, and he's a Captain in the Royal Engineers""). But I said, ""I don't think 'GOD save the Queen' is a proper prayer, I think it's only a sort of three cheers."" So he said, ""GOD bless the Generals, and the Colonels, and the Majors, and the Captains, and the Lieutenants, and the Sub-lieutenants, and the Quartermasters, and the non-commissioned officers, and the men; And the bands, and the colours, and the guns, and the horses and the wagons, and the gun-carriage they use for the funerals; and please I should like them all to come home safe again. (Don't, Mary! I haven't finished; it isn't time for you to say Amen.) I haven't prayed for the Chaplains, or the Doctors who help the poor men left groaning on the ground when the victories are won; And I want to pray particularly for the very poor ones who die of fever and miss all the fighting and fun. GOD bless the good soldiers, like Old Father, and Captain Powder, and the men with good-conduct medals; and please let the naughty ones all be forgiven; And if the black men kill our men, send down white angels to take their poor dear souls to Heaven! _Now_ you may both say Amen, and I shall give out hymn four hundred and thirty-seven."" There are eight verses and eight Alleluias, and we can't sing very well, but we did our best, Only Mary would cry in the verse about ""Soon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest!"" But we're both very glad Dick has found out a Sunday game about fighting, for we never had one before; And now we can play at soldiers every day till Old Father comes home from the war."
"Dear children, listen whilst I tell What to a certain Elf befell, Who left his house and sallied forth Adventure seeking, south and north, And west and east, by path and field, Resolved to conquer or to yield. A thimble on his back he carried, With a rose-twig his foes he parried. It was a sunny, bright, spring day, When to the wood he took his way; He knew that in a certain spot A Bumble Bee his nest had got. The Bee was out, the chance was good, But just when grabbing all he could, He heard the Bee behind him humming, And only wished he'd heard him coming! In terror turned the tiny man, And now a famous fight began: The Bee flew round, and buzzed and stung, The Elf his prickly rose-staff swung. Now fiercely here, now wildly there, He hit the Bee or fought the air. At last one weighty blow descended: The Bee was dead--the fight was ended. Exhausted quite, he took a seat. The honey tasted doubly sweet! The thimble-full had been upset, But still there were a few drops yet. He licked his lips and blessed himself, That he was such a lucky Elf, And now might hope to live in clover; But, ah! his troubles were not over! For at that instant, by his side, A beast of fearful form he spied: At first he thought it was a bear, And headlong fell in dire despair. He lost one slipper in the moss, And this was not his only loss. With paws and snout the beast was nimble, And very soon cleared out the thimble. This rifling of his honey-pot Awoke our Elfin's wrath full hot. He made a rope of linden bast, By either end he held it fast, And creeping up behind the beast, Intent upon the honey feast, Before it had the slightest inkling, The rope was round it in a twinkling. The mouse shrieked ""Murder!"" ""Fire!"" and ""Thieves!"" And struggled through the twigs and leaves. It pulled the reins with all its might, Our hero only drew them tight. Upon the mouse's back he leapt, And like a man his seat he kept. His steed was terribly affrighted, But he himself was much delighted. ""Gee up, my little horse!"" he cried, ""I mean to have a glorious ride; So bear me forth with lightning speed, A Knight resolved on doughty deed. The wide world we will gallop round, And clear the hedges at one bound."" The mouse set off, the hero bantered, And out into the world they cantered. At last they rode up to an inn: ""Good Mr. Host, pray who's within?"" ""My daughter serves the customers, Before the fire the Tom-cat purrs."" For further news they did not wait-- The mouse sprang through the garden-gate-- They fled without a look behind them. The question is--Did Thomas find them?"
"I would not have you wake for me, Fair lady, though I love you! And though the night is warm, and all The stars are out above you; And though the dew's so light it could Not hurt your little feet, And nightingales in yonder wood Are singing passing sweet. Yet may my plaintive strain unite And mingle with your dreaming, And through the visions of the night Just interweave my seeming. Yet no! sleep on with fancy free In that untroubled breast; No song of mine, no thought of me, Deserves to break your rest! Maiden with the gipsy look, Dusky locks and russet hue, Open wide thy Sybil's book, Tell my fate and tell it true; Shall I live? or shall I die? Timely wed, or single be? Maiden with the gipsy eye, Read my riddle unto me! Maiden with the gipsy face, If thou canst not tell me all, Tell me thus much, of thy grace, Should I climb, or fear to fall? Should I dare, or dread to dare? Should I speak, or silent be? Maiden with the gipsy hair, Read my riddle unto me! Maiden with the gipsy hair, Deep into thy mirror look, See my love and fortune there, Clearer than in Sybil's book: Let me cross thy slender palm, Let me learn my fate from thee; Maiden with the gipsy charm, Read my riddle unto me. The whispering water rocks the reeds, And, murmuring softly, laps the weeds; And nurses there the falsest bloom That ever wrought a lover's doom. Forget me not! Forget me not! Ah! would I could forget! But, crying still, ""Forget me not,"" Her image haunts me yet. We wander'd by the river's brim, The day grew dusk, the pathway dim; Her eyes like stars dispell'd the gloom, Her gleaming fingers pluck'd the bloom. Forget me not! Forget me not! Ah! would I could forget! But, crying still, ""Forget me not,"" Her image haunts me yet. The pale moon lit her paler face, And coldly watch'd our last embrace, And chill'd her tresses' sunny hue, And stole that flower's turquoise blue. Forget me not! Forget me not! Ah! would I could forget! But, crying still, ""Forget me not,"" Her image haunts me yet."
"The fateful flower droop'd to death, The fair, false maid forswore her faith; But I obey a broken vow, And keep those wither'd blossoms now! Forget me not! Forget me not! Ah! would I could forget! But, crying still, ""Forget me not,"" Her image haunts me yet. Sweet lips that pray'd--""Forget me not!"" Sweet eyes that will not be forgot! Recall your prayer, forego your power, Which binds me by the fatal flower. Forget me not! Forget me not! Ah! would I could forget! But, crying still, ""Forget me not,"" Her image haunts me yet. Elleree! O Elleree! Seeing what none else may see, Dost thou see the man in grey? Dost thou hear the night hounds bay? Elleree! O Elleree! Seventh son of seventh son, All thy thread of life is spun, Thy little race is nearly run, And death awaits for thee! Elleree! O Elleree! Coronach shall wail for thee; Get thee shrived and get thee blest, Get thee ready for thy rest, Elleree! O Elleree! That thou owest quickly give, What thou ownest thou must leave, And those thou lovest best shall grieve, But all in vain for thee! ""Bodach Glas!""[8] the chieftain said, ""All my debts but one are paid, All I love have long been dead, All my hopes on Heaven are stay'd, Death to me can bring no dole;"" Thus the Elleree replied;-- But with ebbing of the tide As sinks the setting sun he died;-- May Christ receive his soul! The night is dark, and yet it is not quite: Those stars are hid that other orbs may shine; Twin stars, whose rays illuminate the night, And cheer her gloom, but only deepen mine; For these fair stars are not what they do seem, But vanish'd eyes remember'd in a dream. The night is dark, and yet it brings no rest; Those eager eyes gaze on and banish sleep; Though flaming Mars has lower'd his crimson crest, And weary Venus pales into the deep, These two with tender shining mock my woe From out the distant heaven of long ago."
"The night is dark, and yet how bright they gleam! Oh! empty vision of a vanish'd light! Sweet eyes! must you for ever be a dream Deep in my heart, and distant from my sight? For could you shine as once you shone before, The stars might hide their rays for evermore! My love she sent a flower to me Of tender hue and fragrance rare, And with it came across the sea A letter kind as she was fair; But when her letter met mine eyes, The flower, the little flower, was dead: And ere I touched the tender prize The hues were dim, the fragrance fled. I sent my love a letter too, In happy hope no more to roam; I bade her bless the vessel true Whose gallant sails should waft me home. But ere my letter reach'd her hand, My love, my little love, was dead, And when the vessel touch'd the land, Fair hope for evermore had fled. What time I left my native land, And bade farewell to my true love, She laid a flower in my hand As azure as the sky above. ""Speed thee well! Speed well!"" She softly whispered, ""Speed well! This flower blue Be token true Of my true heart's true love for you!"" Its tender hue is bright and pure, As heav'n through summer clouds doth show, A pledge though clouds thy way obscure, It shall not be for ever so. ""Speed thee well! Speed well!"" She softly whisper'd, ""Speed well! This flower blue Be token true Of my true heart's true love for you!"" And as I toil through help and harm, And whilst on alien shores I dwell, I wear this flower as a charm, My heart repeats that tender spell: ""Speed thee well! Speed well!"" It softly whispers, ""Speed well! This flower blue Be token true Of my true heart's true love for you!"" How many years ago, love, Since you came courting me? Through oak-tree wood and o'er the lea, With rosy cheeks and waistcoat gay, And mostly not a word to say,-- How many years ago, love, How many years ago? How many years ago, love, Since you to Father spoke? Between your lips a sprig of oak: You were not one with much to say, But Mother spoke for you that day,-- How many years ago, love, How many years ago? So many years ago, love, That soon our time must come To leave our girl without a home;-- She's like her mother, love, you've said: --At her age I had long been wed,-- How many years ago, love, How many years ago? For love of long-ago, love, If John has aught to say, When he comes up to us to-day, (A likely lad, though short of tongue,) Remember, husband, we were young,-- How many years ago, love, How many years ago? I'm weary waiting here, The chill east wind is sighing, The autumn tints are sere, The summer flowers are dying. The river's sullen way Winds on through vacant meadows, The dying light of day Strives vainly with the shadows."
A footstep stirs the leaves! The faded fields seem brighter, The sunset gilds the sheaves, The low'ring clouds look lighter. The river sparkles by, Not all the flowers are falling, There's azure in the sky, And thou, my love, art calling. Over wastes of blasted heather, Where the pine-trees stand together, Evermore my footsteps wander, Evermore the shadows yonder Deepen into gloom. Where there lies a silent lake, No song-bird there its thirst may slake, No sunshine now to whiteness wake The water-lily's bloom. Some sweet spring-time long departed, I and she, the simple-hearted, Bride and bridegroom, maid and lover, Did that gloomy lake discover, Did those lilies see. There we wandered side by side. There it was they said she died. But ah! in this I know they lied! She will return to me! Never, never since that hour Has the lake brought forth a flower. Ever harshly do the sedges Some sad secret from its edges Whisper to the shore. Some sad secret I forget. The lily though will blossom yet: And when it blooms I shall have met My love for evermore. It was on such a night as this, Some long unreal years ago, When all within were wrapp'd in sleep, And all without was wrapp'd in snow, The full moon rising in the east, The old church standing like a ghost, That, shivering in the wintry mist, And breathless with the silent frost, A little lad, I ran to seek my fortune on the main; I marvel now with how much hope and with how little pain! It is of such a night as this, In all the lands where I have been, That memory too faithfully Has painted the familiar scene. By all the shores, on every sea, In luck or loss, by night or day, My highest hope has been to see That home from which I ran away. For this I toil'd, to this I look'd through many a weary year, I marvel now with how much hope, and with how little fear. On such a night at last I came, But they were dead I loved of yore. Ah, Mother, then my heart felt all The pain it should have felt before! I came away, though loth to come, I clung, and yet why should I cling? When all have gone who made it home, It is the shadow, not the thing. A homeless man, once more I seek my fortune on the main: I marvel with how little hope, and with what bitter pain. With bark and bound and frolic round My dog and I together run; While by our side a brook doth glide, And laugh and sparkle in the sun. We ask no more of fortune's store Than thus at our sweet wills to roam: And drink heart's ease from every breeze That blows about the hills of home. As, fancy free, With game and glee, We happy three Dance down the glen. And yet they say that some fine day This vagrant stream may serve a mill; My doggy guard a master's yard; My free heart choose another's will. How this may fare we little care, My dog and I, as still we run! Whilst by our side the brook doth glide, And laugh and sparkle in the sun. For, fancy free, With game and glee, We happy three Dance down the glen.
"You ask me what--since we must part-- You shall bring home to me; Bring back a pure and faithful heart, As true as mine to thee. I ask not wealth nor fame, I only ask for thee, Thyself--and that dear self the same-- My love, bring back to me! You talk of gems from foreign lands, Of treasure, spoil, and prize. Ah, love! I shall not search your hands, But look into your eyes. I ask not wealth nor fame, I only ask for thee, Thyself--and that dear self the same-- My love, bring back to me! You speak of glory and renown, With me to share your pride, Unbroken faith is all the crown I ask for as your bride. I ask not wealth nor fame, I only ask for thee, Thyself--and that dear self the same-- My love, bring back to me! You bid me with hope's eager gaze Behold fair fortune come. I only dream I see your face Beside the hearth at home. I ask not wealth nor fame, I do but ask for thee! Thyself--and that dear self the same-- May God restore to me! If I should wish hereafter that your heart Should beat with one fair memory of me, May Time's hard hand our footsteps guide apart, But lead yours back one spring-time to the Lea. Nodding Anemones, Wind-flowers pale, Bloom with the budding trees, Dancing to every breeze, Mock hopes more fair than these, Love's vows more frail. For then the grass we loved grows green again, And April showers make April woods more fair; But no sun dries the sad salt tears of pain, Or brings back summer lights on faded hair, Nodding Anemones, Wind-flowers pale, Bloom with the budding trees, Dancing to every breeze, Mock hopes more frail than these, Love's vows more frail. The Spring's bright tints no more are seen, And Summer's ample robe of green Is russet-gold and brown; When flowers fall to every breeze And, shed reluctant from the trees, The leaves drop down. A sadness steals about the heart, --And is it thus from youth we part, And life's redundant prime? Must friends like flowers fade away, And life like Nature know decay, And bow to time? And yet such sadness meets rebuke, From every copse in every nook Where Autumn's colours glow; How bright the sky! How full the sheaves! What mellow glories gild the leaves Before they go. Then let us sing the jocund praise, In this bright air, of these bright days, When years our friendships crown; The love that's loveliest when 'tis old-- When tender tints have turned to gold And leaves drop down. Long, long ago, with vows too much forgotten, The Cross of Christ was seal'd on every brow, Ah! slow of heart, that shun the Christian conflict; Rise up at last! The accepted time is now. Soldiers of Jesus! Blest who endure; Stand in the battle; the victory is sure. Hark! hark! the Saviour's voice to each is calling-- ""I bore the Cross of Death in pain for thee; On thee the Cross of daily life is falling: Children! take up the Cross and follow Me."" Soldiers of Jesus! &c."
