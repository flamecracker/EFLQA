passage
"John-ny Wil-son and Ned Brown were play-ing at ball one day, and the ball hit John on the hand: he was ve-ry an-gry, and ran af-ter Ned and beat him ve-ry hard. Just then, a man came by and gave John a box on the ear which made him let go of Ned, and he be-gan to cry. Then the man said, ""You beat that lit-tle boy and for-get how you hurt him, but you do not like it your-self."" Jane North was an i-dle girl; she did not like her book, and when she was told to read her les-son she would cry, and say she want-ed to play with her doll. So her doll was tak-en from her till she had read; but she read ill, and would not learn to write. So she grew up a dunce, and no one lov-ed her. Had each a nice doll, and they took care of them. One day Tom call-ed them to play at ball, and they ran a-way to play, and left the two dolls on a chair. By and by the cat came in the room, and pull-ed the dolls to pieces, think-ing I dare say, that it was fine fun to tear them to bits, and scam-per round the room with poor dol-ly's nose in her mouth.When the girls came back, and saw the nice new dolls all in bits, they be-gan to cry, and to beat poor puss; but their mam-ma said, ""No, you must not beat puss, for you left your dolls a-bout, and the cat did not know that they were not for her to play with. Next time you must be more care-ful of your toys."" Was a kind girl. One day she was out, and a poor girl came to her and said, ""Give me some bread, I have had none to eat all day."" So Ann said, ""I have no bread, but here is six-pence that my mam-ma gave me, take it, and buy some bread.""But Tom thought he knew best, so he went out with no coat on, and he caught a bad cold and cough, and he was put to bed quite ill. Now Jack and Will and Tom were to have had some fine sport on the fro-zen pond in the farm, but Tom was too ill to go. When he was in bed he thought how sil-ly he had been, to think he knew bet-ter than his kind friends; and then he said to him-self, he would try and do all that he was bid when he got well. One day a child want-ed to reach some-thing off the man-tel shelf, and not be-ing tall e-nough, she stood on the fen-der, and her mo-ther said, ""Fan-ny, you must not get on the fen-der, it will turn o-ver, and then you will fall in the fire and be sad-ly burnt.""But Fan-ny was not a good child, and did not al-ways do as she was bid: so when her mo-ther went out of the room, she want-ed to get her fa-ther's watch that lay on the man-tel shelf, and she stood on the fen-der to reach it, but the fen-der turn-ed o-ver, and Fan-ny fell in the hearth and her clothes took fire. She scream-ed loud-ly, but she was not heard for a lit-tle time, and when her mo-ther ran to her, all her clothes were in a blaze; she roll-ed the rug over to put out the flame and then car-ried her to bed. Jack did not love his book; he was i-dle, and was cross when he was sent to school, and one day when he ought to have gone, he play-ed a-bout the mea-dows in-stead; and he met Sam, who was go-ing to school, and he said, ""Come and play with me, Sam, and we will have some fun."" ""Tom, have a game at trap-bat-and-ball.""--""I do not know how to play at it.""--""Well I will teach you, look at me; that is the way, now do it your-self. That is right, you will soon learn to do it fast.""--""Yes, it is not hard to learn: now let us go and have a race. One, two, three, and off!""""Tom, you have won it.""--""Yes, I run bet-ter than you; and you play trap-bat-and-ball bet-ter than I do.""--""I am too hot to run any more, let us sit down and get cool.""--""I am to have a seat put near this tree, should you like one too?"" ""Yes, but I have no wood to make one.""--""Well, we will ask Dick to give you some wood; come now and ask him."""
