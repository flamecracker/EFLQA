passage
"The editor of the new edition of Mother Goose's Melodies knows much more about the curious history of the Boston edition than I do. And the reader will not need, even in these lines of mine, any light on the curious question about Madam Vergoose, or her son-in-law Mr. Fleet, or the Contes de Ma Mere l'Oye, which are so carefully discussed in the preface. All this is admirably discussed also in Mr. William Whitmore's paper published in Albany in 1889, and reprinted in Boston in 1892. In that paper he reproduced in facsimile Isaiah Thomas's edition of Mother Goose published first in 1785.What I want to tell, is of Mother Goose in the nineteenth Century--the Mother Goose on which the old Boston line was brought up--a line now nearly forgotten. But there were days, Gentle Reader, when an excellent body of people in this little Town of Boston grew up all together loving and loved, brought up their children here, loving and loved, and amused those children from babyhood in their own way. The centre of the baby life of this race was Mother Goose's Melodies in the dear little quarto edition, of which a precise copy is in the reader's hands.It is this Mother Goose of which the New Englander, if his age be more than three score years and ten, speaks when he speaks of Mother Goose at all. The historical ear marks in it are rather curious. Perhaps the printing of this very edition may raise up some antiquary who can tell us how it came into existence. I wish I knew. I hope some reader of these lines may know. What I know is this, that when the nineteenth century began, in the years from 1800 to 1820, the impression of what we still called the ""Mother Country"" upon Boston was very strong. The old nurse who took care of me in my babyhood spoke of ""weal"" and ""winegar,"" where my father and mother spoke of veal and vinegar, just as if she had been a London Cockney. Children played the games of English origin, though it were fifty years after the Declaration of Independence. I may say in passing, that within the last dozen years I stopped to hear some North End children sing the song Queen Anne, without the slightest idea, I suppose, of who Queen Anne was, or what was their business with her. Alas, and alas, I did not write down the words of that song on the moment!The truth is that Boston was still a place of foreign commerce. Our ties with London, such as John Adams and other Revolutionaries spoke of so freely, still existed, and a Baby's Song Book like Mother Goose, might still recall, and I suppose repeat, the song of Cockney homes. London Bridge is broken down, Dance over, my Lady Lee, London Bridge is broken down, With a fair Ladye. Will not some of the active literary clubs of St. Ethelburger's Church in Bishopsgate, in East London, tell us what this means: You owe me five shillings, Say the bells of St. Helen's. When will you pay me? Say the bells of Old Bailey. When I grow rich, Say the bells of Shoreditch. Pokers and tongs, Say the bells of St. John's. Kettles and pans, Say the bells of St. Ann's. Half-pence and farthings, Say the bells of St. Martin's. All this was sung to New England children, thank God without note or comment, and with no other explanation. But the American traveler who goes into Baring Brothers', Bishopsgate, with his credit, feels a thrill which the clerk who attends to him does not understand, if one speaks to him of St. Helen's or St. Ann's."
"All this accounts for Mother Goose as Fleet reprinted her baby songs as early as the year 1700. But as the reader will see, somebody had the editing of the baby's text book who was not afraid of his own time. I think that the very latest verses which will be found here are those of Scott's Donald Dhu. Walter Scott wrote this for Campbell's Anthology in 1816. The presence of these verses fixes the latest date of any lines in the collection, except, as Mr. Whitmore has observed, the line ""Boston Town"" is changed into ""Boston City,"" so that must have been written after 1822.But it is interesting to see that no American line of comment seems to have slipped in. There was no lack of nationalism in the air, but I cannot find any reference to a cent[*], a dime, a governor, or a President. Now in the printed handkerchiefs, such as children used to buy on Election Day in the street, I remember the Ballad of John Gilpin ended, Now, let us sing, ""Long live the President And Gilpin, Long live he."" But the wise editor of our Boston Mother Goose had no such fears for the republicanism of his baby hearers. Those were happy years in which the imagination of babies and their older brothers and sisters were permitted to run free.I have asked and asked and have received no answer, as to the artist who made many of the admirable designs which are distinctive in this book. Abel Bowen's[*] name is signed to one, and his initials appear on several. N.D. means Nathaniel Dearborn[+]. One is signed ""Chicket,""[&] but this does not account for the greater number of them. I was the son of a printer and type-founder, so we had a ""type book"" as a classic in our nursery. So I knew even as a little child, that there were pictures in Mother Goose which were put there merely because the block from which they were printed existed in the printer's office. But there were other designs made by some artist of genius; and who was he? He represented the man in the moon, hanging with one arm to the crescent of the moon. That man, whoever he was, is to be ranked among the original artists of the world. He gave to childhood his first and best images of the blackbirds who were baked in the pie.[+][Note from Brett: Nathanial Dearborn (1786-1852) was with the Holland Printing Company and is perhaps most well known (in 2002) for the difficulty he had in setting plates for a 13 cent stamp used in Hawaii (second issue). He also was a printer and author of ""The American Textbook for Making Letters."" He would have been well remembered in Boston at the time of this book.][&][Note from Brett: ""Chicket"" is terribly obscure and the only reference I could possibly find was to a Mr. Chicket who was apparently murdered in a bar (the Brushmakers Arms) in Upham, New Hampshire and supposedly haunts the bar. Whether this has anything to do with the Chicket in the text is highly questionable, but would make for a great story.]This question I have asked again and again, and no man and no woman has answered it. But the chances seem to be that we owe them also to Abel Bowen, the first wood engraver recorded among the engravers in the period after the Revolution. We have specimens of his work more in pictures of landscape or of buildings than in drawings of men and women. But there can be but little doubt that most of the blocks from which the Mother Goose of our childhood were printed were engraved by him, and there seems to be good reason to believe that the designs were by him as well. The pity is that no old portfolio can be found with other designs from his pencil. But, alas, the chances are that they have gone where so many other manuscripts have gone, which would delight the antiquaries."
"I have said that I am not learned in the interesting genealogical discussion of the subject, but I like to call attention to the fact that the English Norwich was the birthplace and home of Fleet, and that it is possible that in the annals of that city light may be gained as to the history of the man in the Moon.I have always thoughtt that the close connection of our maritime people with London had something to do with the names of our streets. The most striking instance is in the name of Cornhill, where this very Thomas Fleet had his book store, and where book stores have been an institution from that day to this. Our Cornhill in its relations to our water front occupies the same conditions which the London Cornhill had and has to the river front in London. The young reader should remember that Washington Street so far as it had one name was called the Main Street. Coming North from our Dover Street, the traveler passed through Orange Street, then through Newbury Street, next through Marlborough Street, which extended from Winter Street to School Street, and then through Cornhill northward to Dock Square. This is precisely as in passing east through what was the Main Street of London of those days, the traveler would have passed through the Cornhill of that thoroughfare. The London Cornhill retains its name. Ours was changed in 1824 to the all-conquering name of Washington, which is now applied to the whole of the ""Main Street"" and ""the Neck"" of the Fathers, as indeed, it is applied by local authorities many miles further.But in familiar conversation, the old name Cornhill was retained for a generation, and indeed, would be understood to-day, if you were speaking to Boston people more than fifty years old. The name Cornhill is now applied to the Market Street of an earlier period.Young readers should remember that Orange Street, Newbury street, and Marlborough Street were names given in honour of the Prince of Orange of the Puritan victory at Newbury, and of the Duke of Marlborough. All of them show what were the Whig and Puritan feelings of the people who gave them. All three of the names in our time have been transferred from the old localities.We are all greatly obliged to Mrs. Harriet Blackstone C. Butler for the pains she has taken to rescue for popular use this interesting memorial of the education of the fathers and mothers of New England. My dear little Blossoms, there are now in this world, and always will be, a great many grannies besides myself, both in petticoats and pantaloons, some a deal younger to be sure; but all monstrous wise, and of my own family name. These old women, who never had chick nor child of their own, but who always know how to bring up other people's children, will tell you with very long faces, that my enchanting, quieting, soothing volume, my all-sufficient anodyne for cross, peevish, won't-be-comforted little bairns, ought to be laid aside for more learned books, such as THEY could select and publish. Fudge! I tell you that all their batterings can't deface my beauties, nor their wise pratings equal my wiser prattlings; and all imitators of my refreshing songs might as well write a new Billy Shakespeare as another Mother Goose--we two great poets were born together, and we shall go out of the world together. MR. EDITOR:--Your correspondent, N.B.S., has so decisively given a QUIETUS to the question as to the birthplace of Cotton Mather, that there is no danger of its ever being revived again. But there is another question of equal importance to many, to the literary world in particular, which should in like manner be put to rest. WHO WAS MOTHER GOOSE? and WHEN were her melodies first given to the world? These are questions which have been often asked, but have never been satisfactorily answered. The recent publication of a book called ""Mother Goose for Old Folks"" has again revived these questions, which serves to show that the subject has not yet lost its interest.Many persons imagine that Mother Goose is a myth,--that no such person ever existed. This is a mistake. MOTHER GOOSE was not only a veritable personage, but was born and resided many years in Boston, where many of her descendants may now be found. The last that bore this ancient paternal cognomen died about the year 1807, and was buried in the Old Granary Burying Ground, where probably lie the remains of the whole blood, if we may judge from the numerous grave-stones which mark their resting place. The family originated in England, but at what time they came to this country is unknown,--but probably about the year 1656. This was the ""Wealthy family of Goose"" which is immortalized by Mr. Bowditch in his book of Suffolk Names, who at the same time has immortalized himself. They were landholders in Boston, so early as 1660. Nearly half the space between West and Winter streets, on Washington street, and extending westerly towards Tremont street, 275 feet belonged to this family, as did also a large tract of land on Essex, Rowe, and Bedford streets, upon which now stand two churches and a large number of dwelling houses. SO MUCH FOR MOTHER GOOSE. Now for her melodies."
"The first book of the kind known to be printed in this country bears the title of ""Songs for the Nursery; or, Mother Goose's Melodies for Children."" Something probably intended to represent a goose with a very long neck and mouth wide open, covered a large part of the title page, at the bottom of which, Printed by T. Fleet[*], at his printing house, Pudding Lane, 1719. Price, two coppers. Several pages were missing, so that the whole number could not be ascertained.[*][Note from Brett: T. Fleet is probably Thomas Fleet (1685-1758) and is referenced by John Fleet Elliot (a descendent). Thomas Fleet was married to Elizabeth Goose (AKA Vertigoose), and is the presumed author. Unfortunately, modern research and research at the time failed to substantiate the existence of this book. This information is culled in part from the introduction to L. Frank Baum's edition of ""Mother Goose"" in 1897. The introduction written by Mr. Baum considered this line of reasoning and this article is referenced by him.]This T. Fleet, according to Isaiah Thomas[*], was a man of considerable talent and of great wit and humor. He was born in England, and was brought up in a printing office in the city of Bristol, where he afterwards worked as a journeyman. Although he was considered a man of sense, he was never thought to be overburdened with religious sentiments; he certainly was not in his latter days. Yet he was MORE than suspected of being actively engaged in the riotous proceedings connected with the trial of Dr. Sacheverell, in Queen Ann's time. In London, Bristol, and many other places, the mobs and riots were of a very serious nature. In London several meeting houses were sacked and pulled down, and the materials and contents made into bonfires, and much valuable property destroyed. Several of the rioters were arrested, tried and convicted. The trials of some of them are now before me. How deeply Fleet was implicated in these disturbances was never known, but being of the same mind with Jack Falstaff, that ""the better part of valor is discretion,"" thought it prudent to put the Ocean between himself and danger. He made his way to this country and arrived in Boston, 1712. Being a man of some enterprise he soon established a printing office in Pudding Lane (now Devonshire Street), where he printed small books, pamphlets, ballads, and such matter as offered. Being industrious and prudent, he gradually accumulated property. It was not long before he became acquainted with the ""wealthy family of Goose,"" a branch of which he had before known in Bristol, and was shortly married to the eldest daughter.[*][Note from Brett: Publisher of an American volume of Mother Goose in 1787, ""Mother Goose's Melody: or Sonnets for the cradle."" This is a reprint of the collection put together by John Newbury (known for the Newbury medal).]By the record of marriages in the City Registrar's office, it appears that in ""1715, June 8, was married by Rev. COTTON MATHER, THOMAS FLEET TO ELIZABETH GOOSE."" The happy couple took up their residence in the same house with the printing office in Pudding lane. In due time their family was increased by the birth of a son and heir. Mother Goose, like all good grandmothers, was in ecstasies at the event; her joy was unbounded; she spent her whole time in the nursery, and in wandering about the house, pouring forth, in not the most melodious strains, the songs and ditties which she had learned in her younger days, greatly to the annoyance of the whole neighborhood--to Fleet in particular, who was a man fond of quiet. It was in vain he exhausted his shafts of wit and ridicule, and every expedient he could devise: it was of no use--the old lady was not thus to be put down; so, like others similarly situated, he was obliged to submit. His shrewdness, however, did not forsake him; from this seeming evil he contrived to educe some good; he conceived the idea of collecting the songs and ditties as they came from his mother, and such as he could gather from other sources, and publishing them for the benefit of the world--not forgetting himself. This he did--and thus ""Mother Goose's Melodies"" were brought forth. The adoption of this title was in derision of his good mother-in-law, and was perfectly characteristic of the man, as he was never known to spare his nearest friends in his raillery, or when he could excite laughter at their expense."
COTTON MATHER AND MOTHER GOOSE thus stand in juxtaposition; and as the former was instrumental in cementing the union, which resulted in placing the latter so conspicuously before the world, it is but just that it should be so,--although the one was a learned man, a most voluminous writer, and published a great many books, some wise and some foolish, it may well be doubted whether any one, or all of them, together, have passed through so many editions,--been read by so many hundreds of thousands, not to say millions,--put so many persons to sleep, or in general done so much good to the world as the simple melodies of the other. There was a mad man, And he had a mad wife, And they lived all in a mad lane! They had three children all at a birth, And they too were mad every one. The father was mad, The mother was mad, The children all mad beside; And upon a mad horse they all of them got, And madly away did ride. Little Robin Redbreast Sat upon a tree, Up went the Pussy-Cat, And down went he; Down came Pussy-Cat, Away Robin ran, Says little Robin Redbreast-- Catch me if you can. Little Robin Redbreast jumped upon a spade, Pussy-Cat jumped after him, and then he was afraid. Little Robin chirped and sung, and what did pussy say? Pussy-Cat said Mew, mew mew,--and Robin flew away. Sing a song of sixpence, a bag full of rye, Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie: When the pie was opened, the birds began to sing; And wasn't this a dainty dish to set before the king? The king was in the parlour, counting out his money; The queen was in the kitchen, eating bread and honey; The maid was in the garden, hanging out the clothes, There came a little blackbird and nipt off her nose. One, Two--buckle my shoe; Three, Four--open the door; Five, Six--pick up sticks; Seven, Eight--lay them straight; Nine, Ten--a good fat hen. Eleven, Twelve--I hope you're well; Thirteen, Fourteen--draw the curtain; Fifteen, Sixteen--the maid's in the kitchen; Seventeen, Eighteen--she's in waiting. Nineteen, Twenty--my stomach's empty. When I was a little boy, I lived by myself, And all the bread and cheese I got I put upon a shelf; The rats and the mice, they made such a strife, I was forced to go to London to buy me a wife. The streets were so broad, and the lanes were so narrow, I was forced to bring my wife home in a wheelbarrow; The wheelbarrow broke, and my wife had a fall, And down came the wheelbarrow, wife and all. 'Twas once upon a time, when Jenny Wren was young, So daintily she danced and so prettily she sung, Robin Redbreast lost his heart, for he was a gallant bird; So he doffed his hat to Jenny Wren, requesting to be heard.O, dearest Jenny Wren, if you will but be mine, You shall feed on cherry-pie and drink new currant wine, I'll dress you like a goldfinch or any peacock gay; So, dearest Jen, if you'll be mine, let us appoint the day.Jenny blushed behind her fan and thus declared her mind: Since, dearest Bob, I love you well, I take your offer kind; Cherry-pie is very nice and so is currant wine, But I must wear my plain brown gown and never go too fine. Richard and Robin were two pretty men; They laid abed till the clock struck ten; Robin starts up and looks at the sky, Oh ho! brother Richard, the sun's very high, Do you go before with the bottle and bag, And I'll follow after on little Jack Nag. There were two birds upon a stone, Fal de ral--al de ral--laddy. One flew away, and then there was one, Fal de ral--al de ral--laddy. The other flew after, and then there was none, Fal de ral--al de ral--laddy. So the poor stone was left all alone, Fal de ral--al de ral--laddy. One of these little birds back again flew, Fal de ral--al de ral--laddy. The other came after, and then there were two, Fal de ral--al de ral--laddy. Says one to the other, Pray how do you do, Fal de ral--al de ral--laddy. Very well, thank you, and pray how are you, Fal de ral--al de ral--laddy. One misty, moisty morning, When cloudy was the weather, I chanced to meet an old man clothed all in leather. He began to compliment, and I began to grin, How do you do, and how do you do? And how do you do again?
There was an old woman tost up in a blanket, Seventy times as high as the moon, What she did there, I cannot tell you, but in her hand she carried a broom. Old woman, old woman, old woman, said I, O whither, O whither, O whither so high? To sweep the cobwebs from the sky, And I shall be back again by and by. The North wind doth blow, And we shall have snow, And what will poor robin do then? Poor thing! He'll sit in the barn And keep himself warm, And hide his head under his wing, Poor thing!This ram was fat behind, sir; this ram was fat before; This ram was ten yards round, sir; indeed he was not more. No more, no more, no more; This ram was ten yards round, sir; indeed he was no more.The horns grew on his head, sir, they were so wondrous high, As I've been plainly told, sir, they reached up to the sky. The sky, the sky, the sky, As I've been plainly told, sir, they reached up to the sky. Lavender blue, and Rosemary green, When I am king, you shall be queen, Call up my maids at four of the clock, Some to the wheel, and some to the rock, Some to make hay, and some to shell corn, And you and I shall keep the bed warm. The lion and the Unicorn Were fighting for the crown-- The lion beat the unicorn All about the town. Some gave them white bread, And some gave them brown, Some gave them plum-cake, And sent them out of town. Little Johnny Pringle had a little Pig. It was very little, so was not very big. As it was playing beneath the shed, In half a minute poor Piggy was dead. So Johnny Pringle he sat down and cried, And Betty Pringle she laid down and died. There is the history of one, two and three, Johnny Pringle, Betty Pringle, and Piggy Wiggie. The little black dog ran round the house, And set the bull a roaring, And drove the monkey in the boat, Who set the oar a rowing, And scared the cock upon the rock, Who cracked his throat with crowing. There was a man in our town And he was wond'rous wise, He jump'd into a bramble-bush, And scratch'd out both his eyes; And when he saw his eyes were out, With all his might and main He jump'd into another bush, And scratch'd them in again. Hen. Cock, cock, cock, cock, I've laid an egg, Am I to gang ba-are-foot? Cock. Hen, hen, hen, hen, I've been up and down, To every shop in town, And cannot find a shoe To fit your foot, If I'd crow my heart out. Pussy sits behind the log, How can she be fair? Then comes in the little dog, Pussy, are you there? So, so, dear mistress Pussy, Pray tell me how you do? I thank you, little dog, I'm very well just now. There was a man and he had naught, And robbers came to rob him; He crept up to the chimney top, And then they thought they had him. But he got down on t'other side, And then they could not find him: He ran fourteen miles in fifteen days, And never look'd behind him.
Ding--dong--bell, the cat's in the well, Who put her in? little Johnny Green. Who pulled her out? great Johnny Stout. What a naughty boy was that, To drown poor pussy cat; Who never did him any harm, And killed the mice in his father's barn. Bonny lass! bonny lass! Will you be mine? You shall neither wash dishes Nor serve the wine, But sit on a cushion and sew up a seam, And you shall have strawberries, sugar, and cream. I won't be my father's Jack, I won't be my father's Jill, I will be the fiddler's wife, And have music when I will. T'other little tune, t'other little tune, Prythee, love, play me t'other little tune. Little lad, little lad, Where were you born? Far off in Lancashire, under a thorn, Where they sup butter-milk With a ram's horn; And a pumpkin scoop'd, With a yellow rim, Is the bonny bowl they breakfast in. Pretty John Watts, We are troubled with rats, Will you drive them out of the house? We have mice too in plenty, That feast in the pantry, But let them stay and nibble away, What harm in a little brown mouse? Taffy was a Welchman, Taffy was a thief, Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef; I went to Taffy's house, Taffy wasn't at home, Taffy came to my house and stole a marrow-bone; I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was in bed, I took the marrow-bone, and beat about his head. Boys and girls, come out to play, The moon does shine as bright as day, Leave your supper, and leave your sleep, And meet your playfellows in the street; Come with a whoop, and come with a call, And come with a good will, or not at all. Up the ladder and down the wall, A halfpenny roll will serve us all. You find milk and I'll find flour, And we'll have pudding in half an hour. Jemmy Jed went into a shed, And made a ted of straw his bed; An owl came out and flew about, And Jimmy Jed up stakes and fled. Wasn't Jimmy Jed a staring fool, Born in the woods to be scar'd by an owl? Oh I am so happy, A little girl said, As she sprang like a lark From her low trundle bed. It is morning, bright morning, Good morning, Papa! Oh give me one kiss, For good morning, Mamma! Trip upon trenchers, And dance upon dishes, My mother sent me for yeast, some yeast, She bid me tread lightly, And come again quickly, For fear the young men would play me some jest. Yet didn't you see, yet didn't you see, What naughty tricks they put upon me? They broke my pitcher, and spilt my water, And huff'd my mother, and chid her daughter, And kissed my sister instead of me. I had a little Doll, The prettiest ever seen, She washed me the dishes, And kept the house clean. She went to the mill To fetch me some flour, And always got it home In less than an hour; She baked me my bread, She brewed me my ale, She sat by the fire And told many a fine tale. Goosey, goosey, gander, where dost thou wander? Up stairs and down stairs, and in my lady's chamber; There I met an old man that would not say his prayers, I took him by his hind legs and threw him down stairs.
