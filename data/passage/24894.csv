passage
"As the _Emperor Moth_[1] sat one evening in May, Fanned by numberless wings in the moon's silver ray, While around him the zephyrs breathed sweetest perfume, Thus he spoke to his dwarf with the _Ragged white plume_:[2] ""That vain Butterfly's Ball, I hear, was most splendid, And, as the world says, very fully attended, Though she never asked us, but assigned as a cause, We were all much too heavy to gallope and waltz. What impertinence this, want of grace to ascribe To the Lord of the whole Lepidopterous tribe; I too'll give a ball, and such folks to chastise, I'll not be at home to these pert butterflies. Bid the _Empress_[3] come hither, and we'll talk about What arrangements to make for a capital rout."" The Empress obeyed her lord's summons with speed, And proceeded her visiting tablets to read, That those of her subjects, whose homage was booked In that coveted record, might not be o'erlooked. Then the _Bufftip_[4] began to write each moth a card, Having one for herself just by way of reward. ""First ask,"" says the Emperor, ""the _Glory of Kent_,[5] On having much beauty my mind is quite bent; The _Belle_, too, _of Brixton_,[6] the _Marvel du Jour_,[7] And the _Peach-blossom_[8] moth you'll invite, I am sure; The _Sphinx_[9] too, shall come, who makes riddles so well, And the _Gipsey_[10] be ready our fortunes to tell; _Mother Shipton_[11] shall chap'rone the lovely _Black I_,[12] And those awkward Greek girls, _Lambda_,[13] _Gamma_,[14] and _Chi_;[15] _Hebrew Character_,[16] too, who for routs has a passion; And I'll ask Mrs. _Gothic_,[17] though she's out of fashion, For I love my old friends, and had rather that they Should partake of our feast, than the idle and gay, Who flutter about without object or reason, Just live for an hour, and last but a season."" How little, alas! do great moths bear in mind, That their tenure of life is of just the same kind. ""You're right,"" said the Empress, ""and truly 'twere shabby, T'exclude from our party poor old Mrs. _Tabby_,[18] And the _Rustics_[19] I'll ask, though not one has a gown In which to appear, save of black, grey, or brown; And some of them go, too, so feathered and flounced, That the _Coxcomb_[20] called _Prominent_, on them pronounced A sentence of censure, quite just, but so tart, That I felt, when I heard it, quite cut to the heart. But now to proceed, Sire, the _Leopard_[21] I vote, Be razed from our list, with that ugly old _Goat_,[22] Who in youth made such terrible use of his jaws, That I dread, I confess, e'en the sight of his claws; And as to his muscles, 'tis said that when counted, To four thousand and just forty-one they amounted; Of Musk too, I'm told, he sheds such perfume, That wherever he goes, he fills the whole room. Exclude him we will, with the old _Dromedary_,[23] The _Elephant_[24] cunning, and _Fox_[25] too, so wary, That though I don't know it for certain, I'm told They cheat at Ecart√©, like Hermes of old. The _Ghost_[26] and _Death's head_,[27] and that terrible host, Would but scare all the guests""--Here the Emperor lost, For a moment, his patience, and cried to his spouse, ""If thus you proceed, ma'am, my anger you'll rouse. Like th' Egyptians of old, I'll have at my feast A figure of death, or his cross-bones at least, To remind all our guests of the limited span That to moths is allotted, as well as to man, And how e'en in the midst of enjoyment's gay hour, We are still in death's stern and inflexible power. So let them have cards, and I'll go and prepare For receiving our friends, the best possible fare."" The Monarch then went with the _Eyed Hawk_,[28] his scout, To search for a spot fit for giving his rout; A green ring he found, the work of a fairy, And thinking it looked both commodious and airy, He called to him _Brimstone_[29] to measure the ground, For another _Geometra_[30] could not be found; Of this workman he knew the correctness full well, What he wrought was as nice as if done by a spell. The spot was judged proper, and erected in haste Were some well fashioned rooms, which displayed his good taste. _Carpet Moths_[31] were appointed to stencil the floor, The _Clothes Moths_[32] with gossamer covered the door; _Mahogany_[33] and _Wainscot_[34] were neither deficient In offering their aid, which proved most efficient, While _Veneers_,[35] both rosy and yellow, were able T'improve, by their help, the decayed supper table. For the crockery, _China Mark_[36] promised to strive, And _Galleria_[37] offered to steal from a hive, Profusion of honey; _Pinguinalis_[38] brought butter, And with wax _Cereana_[39] came all in a flutter. These presents the Emperor gladly accepted, Save Galleria's theft, which with scorn was rejected, So little do moths of great minds patronise The base who by fraud or extortion would rise. In the mean time the Empress her _Swifts_[40] had sent out To deliver the cards for this elegant rout. _Puss_[41] sent an excuse, with the _Kitten_[42] engaged, And the _Eggar_,[43] poor lady, was highly enraged That her numerous offspring requiring her care, Prevented her joining a party so rare. The _Burnets_,[44] _Brown Pinioned_,[45] the _Dingy Brocades_,[46] The _Black Raven Feather_,[47] and sweet _Angle Shades_,[48] Had promised that day with the _Tussock_[49] to dine, A lady of fashion, whose hour was nine; But when they received their dread sovereign's command, They yielded to custom's imperious demand, For moths with us mortals in this do agree, That all parties must bow to a monarch's decree. Lady _Lappet_[50] being ill, the _Poplar Lutestring_[51] The two Misses _Nonpareil_[52] promised to bring; And the _Spectacle Moth_,[53] too near sighted to go, Sent his ward the _Bright Eye_,[54] with the _Flame Furbelow_,[55] Whose young lover, the beautiful, brave _Unicorn_,[56] Had been shot in a duel with the _Red Striped Hawthorn_.[57] Not quite fit to appear, the gallant _Swallow Tail_[58] At the doctors with anger continued to rail, He having been lamed by the awkward _Bulrush_,[59] To the serious alarm of the fair _Maiden's Blush_.[60] The day now arrived, and at nine of the night, The glow-worm being hired the highways to light, The guests 'gan to assemble, and each was announced By the _Herald_,[61] who loudly their names all pronounced. The _Ermine_,[62] a lady of noble degree, Introduced a long train of her large family; Some in _Muslin_,[63] some _Satin_,[64] were chastely arrayed, While the _Emerald_,[65] the _Pearl_,[66] and the _Mocha_[67] displayed Their jewels so costly, that poor _Burnished Brass_[68] Unnoticed was suffered the evening to pass. From the banks of the Niger the _Blackamoor_[69] brought A fat _Moor_,[70] who presented a _Tyger_[71] just caught; An old _Gentlewoman_[72] had promised to bring A musical Miss, who divinely could sing, But whose fair head, no larger than that of a _Dot_,[73] Was filled with the thought of a _True Lover's Knot_;[74] So she hem'd and she ha'd, then unblushingly told, How she caught as she came a most violent cold, And felt such oppression and pain in her throat, That she scarcely dared venture to utter a note; And thus with most Misses of human creation, How often their colds are but mere affectation. The dancing began, and soft music was heard, Provided, 'twas said, by the sweet _Humming Bird_.[75] Old Colonel _Gold Spangle_,[76] his dancing days past, Volunteered with good humour the dances to cast; To the forward Miss _Portland_[77] Captain _Christian_[78] he brought, Who, aided by Mars, the young lady had caught, For moths, like their betters, as I have been told, Are mightily taken with scarlet and gold. The _Foresters_[79] danced, arrayed all in green, With the _Clear Wings_,[80] whose beauty gave life to the scene; The _Mouse_,[81] quite enamoured, entreated in vain The hand of the lovely _Pease Blossom_[82] to gain, And the _Satellite_,[83] though he till now had sat still, Made up to the _Seraph_[84] to dance a quadrille. The _Quakers_,[85] who ne'er had been seen at a ball, With the _Coronets_[86] galloped around the great hall, And the sad _Mourning Widow_,[87] her weeds put away, To waltz with the lustrous _Japan_,[88] now quite gay; While the _Magpie_[89] obtained universal applause, By fluttering a hornpipe upon his hind claws. The _Vapourer_[90] came not, but he was no loss, For wherever he went he was stupid and cross; And his wife, an old dowdy, bereft of all wings, Was unfit to appear as th' associate of Kings; The _Dagger_[91] came armed, and looked all around, But his charmer, Miss _Snout_,[92] was no where to be found, For she had not been asked, and the _Figure of Eight_,[93] With his cousin, the _Sprawler_,[94] joined the party so late, That morn was forth peeping, and the dancing had done, When _Spring Usher_[95] announced the young beautiful _Nun_.[96] The _Gnomana_[97] now indexed the hour of four, The guests were assembled around the great door, Which the _Lacqueys_[98] threw open, and each in his rank Found a seat for himself, and they all ate and drank With a relish that would not disgrace the Guildhall, (To compare for a moment such great things with small,) Where London's Lord Mayor and his Aldermen deign To feast upon turtle, and tipple champagne. Old _Drinker_,[99] the butler, of wine served the best, And a _Footman_[100] was placed at the chair of each guest, In orange, in yellow, or black coats dressed out, For their liveries, 'twas said, were all made for the rout, The Emperor began mirth and glee to inspire, When a loud cry was heard, of ""the chimney's on fire;"" All started in fear from the table to learn If the house was in flames, or likely to burn; Each snatched up a candle, so left the room dark, And the moment was seized by the _Chamomile Shark_[101] To plunder the table. The _Yorkshire Magpie_[102] Strove also with his share of booty to fly, But was stopped by the _Lacqueys_, who then in a trice Demolished themselves every thing that was nice."
"'Midst this glorious confusion a mischievous _Pug_[103] Contrived of the claret to empty each jug, But not unperceived by young _Miss Exclamation_,[104] Who by her loud cries caused immense consternation. Meanwhile came the _Sweep_,[105] with the _Chimney Sweep's Boy_,[106] And two other _Assistants_,[107] who ran to employ Every means they could think of to put out the flame, In which they succeeded, and found that the blame Belonged to the _Housewife_,[108] who had thrown in the fire Some grease, which occasioned the accident dire. The guests in a panic had now left alone The Emperor and Empress their ills to bemoan. Said the Empress, ""My dear, let us never more try With the Butterflies' party so vainly to vie; For what with the heat, the fatigue, and the fright, I never before passed so trying a night; I would not again undergo the vexation Of such a soir√©e, for the wealth of a nation."" ""With you I agree,"" the sage Emperor replied, Who deemed it a lesson to cure them of pride; ""And I trust that the thread of our lives will spin out, Ere we ever again attempt such a rout. Alas! we must own we were never designed To flit in the sunshine, or soar on the wind; Nature's changeless decree has allotted its share To each beast of the field, to each bird of the air, To each reptile that creeps, to each insect that flies; And who dares to rebel against nature but dies?"" [1] _Saturnia pavonia minor._ The caterpillars of these moths are of a beautiful green, with blue spots, and after living together for three weeks, they separate, and disperse themselves in all directions. The Chrysalis is covered with a strongly glutinous matter, which resists not only weather, but the perforation of other insects. The Pavonia Major is the largest of European moths, and, according to Latreille, a manufactory of silk from the cocoons has been established in Germany. [2] _Pterophorus pentadactylus._ Large White Plume. By some called Ragged Robin. The moths of this genus have their wings divided, or formed of feathers united at the base. The chrysalis is black. [9] The attitude of the caterpillars, resembling that of the Sphinx, has given this name to the tribe. The moths of the Sphinx have the peculiar power of erecting their wings, but even these cannot make them meet over the back as butterflies do. Their chief food is the potatoe plant. [10] _Liparis dispar._--The caterpillars of the Gipsey are very destructive to fruit trees, over which they wander during the day, but at night retire into a web like that of a spider. In 1731, they attacked and destroyed most of the oaks in France. [13] [14] [15] _Noctua lambda_, _Noctua gamma_, _Noctua chi._--So named from the spots on their wings resembling these Greek characters. The caterpillars of the Noctua gamma, in 1735, infected the whole of France, and devoured the productions of the kitchen gardens. The common people supposed them to be poisonous, and consequently the use of herbs in making soups was forbidden. [18] _Pyralis genus._--The Tabby is often found in the tea chests in the East India warehouses, where it commits great ravages. It never is met with, however, in a chest that is not cracked, thereby proving its English origin. [20] _Notodonta camelina._--The singular name of Coxcomb Prominent, was given to this moth from the crest on its thorax, which resembles that of a cock. The specific name was bestowed in consequence of two lobes on its upper wings, which it raises when at rest. [21] _Zeuzera √¶sculus._--The caterpillar feeds on the wood of apple trees, but the moth is often found in great abundance in St. James's Park; sixty were gathered there in one morning, but the greater number had been half devoured by the birds. [22] _Cossus ligniperda._--The caterpillar lives in the interior of trees, and has, according to Lyonet, 4041 muscles. It is three years before the insect attains its perfect state. The caterpillar emits a smell much resembling that of musk, and Ray and Linn√¶us both supposed it to be the Cossus mentioned by Pliny, as fattened with flour by the Roman epicures for their tables. Later writers have, however, for many reasons, ascribed this to the larva of the stag beetle."
[24] _Sphinx elpenor._--The caterpillars of the Elephant feed on the plant called Ladies' Bedstraw, (_Galium palustre_), from which they are often shaken by the wind into the water. When this happens, they dexterously turn themselves on their backs, make head and tail meet, and float in this posture till they can contrive to save themselves by clinging to some part of the plant. They possess the power of drawing the head and three first joints within the body at pleasure. The moth flies very late at night, and is rarely caught. [26] _Hepialus humuli._--The male moth is of a beautiful and brilliant white, but the female is yellow. It is fond of feeding on the roots of grass, and from having been often found in church-yards, the tradition has arisen that it inhabits those spots only. The caterpillar is very destructive to hops, by devouring the roots. [27] _Sphinx atropos._--This is called the Death's Head moth from the resemblance of the spot on its thorax to a human skull. It is the largest of the Sphinx tribe, and is vulgarly regarded as the messenger of pestilence and death. When touched it utters a plaintive cry, like that of a bat or mouse. Reaumur says, that a whole convent in France was thrown into consternation, by one of these moths flying into the dormitory. It frequently robs hives, and Huber states, that its cry renders the bees motionless. It breaks from its chrysalis between four and seven in the afternoon, as the Hawk moth of the Lime always appears at noon, and that of the Evening Primrose at sunrise. [30] This genus is so called from the peculiar manner in which the caterpillar moves; it brings the feet of both extremities close together, and the intermediate part of the body rises like an arch, giving it the appearance of measuring the distance it performs. It is said to possess great muscular powers, for it will attach its posterior feet to the twig of a tree, and erect the rest of its body in a vertical position for hours without moving. [32] _Tinea genus._--These are the moths which cause so much destruction to furs, and other articles of clothing. They lay their eggs on the substances which serve them for food. The most effectual method of keeping them away is to pack the materials in a well-closed tin box, and enclose with them a tallow candle. [35] _Crambus carnea._--Rosy veneer. _Crambus arborum._--Yellow satin veneer. They receive their name from the streaks on their wings. They are chiefly found on grasses in flower, and always settled with their heads downwards. [38] _Aglossa pinguinalis._--The food of the caterpillar consists of fat substances, such as butter or lard, in which it will suffer itself to be completely enveloped without injury. It is sometimes said to get into the human stomach, when it causes very dangerous symptoms. [40] _Hepialus genus._--The gold Swift sometimes moves slowly through the air, a few feet from the ground, where it poises itself; at others, vacillates like the pendulum of a clock, and again altering its motion, darts about with great rapidity. [41] _Cerura vinula._--The caterpillar of the Puss has the power of stretching out, or pulling back its head at will, according to its apprehension of danger. Its hinder extremity never touches the ground, but is furnished with two tubes, through which the insect ejects a thin liquor at its pursuers. When near the change into the pupa state, however, the tubes dry up, and it loses this faculty. More male than female moths are to be found, which is contrary to the general rule. [50] _Gastropacha quercifolia._--The caterpillar of this moth also lives through the winter, a fact recently discovered by Mr. Samouelle, from whose obliging communications many of these notes have been derived.
