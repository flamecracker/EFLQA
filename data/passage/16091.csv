""When I go to work, and hire a car like this, and especially stipulate that the ride shall be--rural--you kick on the bumps.""But scarcely had she uttered these words, when a ""bump"" came, with neither time nor opportunity for Nita's ""kick."" In fact, it was remarkable that the old hay wagon did not actually carry out its threat, to roll over in the direction toward which it wobbled.""Oh, it's all right, Sam,"" called back Tavia, ""the only thin member of the party, who might by any chance fall through a hole, is dying from bumps, and we have a good hold on her. If you could see through the hay you would behold the human chain in action,"" and she gave Nita such a jerk that the latter declared the bumps were lovely, and begged to be allowed to do her own experimenting with them.""I hope the old horses are hooked up securely,"" remarked Rose-Mary, whom the girls called Cologne. ""I don't mind making a hill, but I hate to have the wagon make it in solo. I have had a try of that sort.""The ""waltzing horse"" tried to sit down, but the farmer tugged at the lines, and otherwise objected to such conduct, and the unfortunate animal did its best to comply with the orders, which were now being flung at him, not only from the driver but from the girls in the wagon.And the old horses were frightened as well, for they backed, side stepped, and made every possible effort to avoid having the wagon, and its precious load, overturned into the deep river at the very side of the roadway.The girls were becoming more and more alarmed, and only Tavia kept up the jesting. The hill was very steep, the river fairly curled around it, and the horses grew more nervous each moment, under the strain that was being put upon them.Deep in the bed of hay the girls from Glenwood School had ensconsed themselves. The horses were now going at such a pace that it would be rash to attempt to jump from the rick. Nita Brant actually made her way forward, and had now fairly grasped the old driver about the neck. She felt that he must know how to save himself, at least, and she determined to ""take chances"" with him.Tavia did deign to sit up and notice the rate of speed the old horses had acquired. Her dark eyes shot glances of daring admiration, and she reminded her companions that Roman chariot races were ""not in it,"" just then.No need to announce this, for, with the ominous sound, one of the horses broke from its traces, and the other was now dragging the old wagon along by the straps that had withstood the jerks and plunges.Truly they were imprisoned by the uprights of the old-fashioned hayrick! But if they could not jump what could they do? Each face showed its panic of fear. If only the one remaining horse would break loose, it might not be so dangerous to fall over in all that hay!Tavia needed no second invitation. In an instant she had followed Dorothy Dale, and, as they landed in the dusty roadway, shaken up, but not otherwise hurt, the runaway horse, freed from the interference of its mate that had broken loose, continued to drag the hayrick toward the dangerous river, which bubbled over the black and sharp rocks, scarcely concealed by the foam that broke upon them."
"Well might Dorothy exclaim in terror at the fate that seemed imminent for the girls left in the wagon--the girls of Glenwood School--her dearest chums. Those of my readers who are familiar with the previous volumes of this series, will, perhaps, pardon the rather unceremonious manner in which I have just introduced the young ladies of this book. To those who are reading of Dorothy Dale for the first time, a few words of explanation may be necessary. And, in presenting the young ladies of Glenwood School, I must at once apologize for, and criticise Tavia Travers.From the very first book of the series entitled ""Dorothy Dale, a Girl of To-day,"" we find Dorothy striving bravely to induce Tavia to give up her stagey ways. Every predicament in the story was a ""scene"" to Tavia, while but for Dorothy's intervention, and gentle determination, these scenes would have been turned into tragedies for the wily Tavia. Then, in the second book, ""Dorothy Dale at Glenwood School,"" Tavia and the young ladies of that institution got into many a ""scrape"" and, while Dorothy was one of the girls, in the true sense of the word, she managed to discriminate between fun and folly.But what sacrifices Dorothy was actually capable of making for a friend were more clearly related in ""Dorothy Dale's Great Secret,"" where she shielded Tavia from the consequences of her daring and foolish venture, of running away with a theatrical company. Through two more books of the series, ""Dorothy Dale and Her Chums,"" and ""Dorothy Dale's Queer Holidays,"" we find Dorothy still busy trying to reform Tavia, and while in each of the books there is plenty of other work for Dorothy to attend to, it seems that Tavia is her one perpetual charge. What Tavia thinks fun is not always of the safe sort, and what Dorothy thinks necessary Tavia often thinks may be passed by as some subtle joke. So it will be seen that each of these two interesting characters always has her own particular following, while the friendship between Tavia and Dorothy has withstood every possible test.They had been out riding on an improvised chariot--a hayrick of the old-fashioned kind, like a cradle, filled with the fragrant timothy and redtop, when the accident, narrated in the first chapter, took place.As Tavia and Dorothy ran after the wagon containing their friends, while the vehicle swayed from side to side in the road, they saw it give a sudden lurch, and almost topple over on the steep embankment which descended to the river.Dorothy gave a gasp of fear, and Tavia covered her eyes with her hand. The next moment Dorothy saw the driver of the wagon crawling out from a clump of bushes. Guessing that he was not badly hurt, she ran on, for she had halted momentarily when she saw the vehicle sway so dangerously. Together she and Tavia sprang forward, to reach, if possible, before it toppled over, the swaying, bounding wagon.Whether from an unconquerable spirit of fun, or from motives purely humane, Tavia had snatched up armful after armful of the loose hay, which had been spilled out on the road. In doing this she never halted in her running, but stooped over, like some gleaner in a field, urged on by the approach of night.""There comes the man who owns the horse,"" remarked Dorothy, as the frenzied farmer, whip in hand, ran toward the stranger, yelling all sorts of unintelligible things in the way of threats and predictions. He would see to it personally, he declared, that these things would happen to the man who dared ride his used-up horse.""A fight to finish it off,"" exulted Tavia, and Dorothy, for the moment, felt as if she could find it in her heart to despise so frivolous a girl. The next second she remembered Nita, and turned back to the wrecked hayrick.It was some time later, but they were still in the roadway. The farmer had patched up his damaged rig, but would not listen to the girls' appeals to give them a lift toward town. He insisted it was all their fault for laughing and scaring the horses, and he vowed vengeance on the man who really had saved the team from positive destruction in the river.The strange young man, after considerable gusto, all of which was wasted on the farmer, but hugely enjoyed by Tavia at least, had made his way off, leaving the girls discreetly to their woes. No one was actually injured, although, as Nita said, costumes had suffered severely.""Wasn't he queer?"" remarked Cologne, as she shook small bundles of hay from her Glenwood cap and blouse. ""I thought I would laugh outright when he mounted the old horse a second time. He looked like somebody on a variety stage."""
"Tavia almost lolled over on the soft hay, then she gathered it up with conspicuous tenderness, pressed it fondly to her heart, and agreed to start on. Each of the other girls was taking with her, back to the school, a similar souvenir; but Cologne and Dorothy threw theirs over their shoulder, in true rustic fashion, while Nita complained that she was not able to carry hers; though she did manage to bribe Tavia with a promised return of the chocolates to tie hers in with the extra sized bundle that Tavia was lugging along.""And to think that we paid him in advance! It's a wonder we have never had a single lesson in financial economy at gloomy Glenwood. 'How to cheat farmers; or, how to die game in a hayrick!' I must suggest the text to Mrs. Pangborn, our honored principal,"" declared Edna, as she, too, made her way along under the uncertain weight of a bundle of hay.""Never!"" declared Tavia. ""These are to make up the sacrificial altar. If old Pangborn growls--won't allow the doors open--we will do it with a match!"" and she signified that the hay would make a spontaneous blaze in that lamentable instance.""There's a lamb!"" declared Cologne. ""I could do worse than give Mary's pet a treat,"" and she ran to the rail fence, jumped up on one of the queer crossed posts, and called all sorts of names to the surprised sheep, that scarcely stopped grazing to notice the girls outside of the barrier.It was getting dusk, and the sunset did not detract from the unusual scene. Great shafts of gold and scarlet fell down on that old fence, and a prettier sight could scarcely have been worked up, much less imagined.""Run, sheep, run!"" yelled Edna, as the much-terrified girls scattered hither and thither, along the road, fully conscious that they were responsible for the safety of the frantic flock that had broken loose from their pasture.""How are the 'Bo-Peepers'?"" yelled Tavia, with a flourish of a stick meant to represent a shepherdess crook. ""Or do you prefer the old Roman? There will be all kinds of conflagrations when Nero comes!""""But, as a matter of fact,"" began Dorothy seriously, as she stopped, and her companions halted with her, ""what had we best do? We cannot walk into Glenwood Hall with a herd of sheep at our heels,"" for the animals were now following the girls along the road.Tavia, too, saw the strange man as he emerged, seemingly, from nowhere, for she started on a run, laughing uproariously at the herd of sheep that trotted as she increased her pace, turned as she turned, and, in fact, seemed to be at a regular game of ""follow the leader.""Dorothy did not like that. She, in fact, did not fancy this young man's ""apparition"" habit, and she now determined to force Tavia to a sense of her own obligations to reach Glenwood School without further delay.""Girls,"" called Dorothy, ""we really must hurry! Thank you, very much"" (this to the strange man), ""for your kindness this afternoon, but you see now, we have to get back to school. We would not have been out so long but for the fact that this is privilege day--school closes Thursday."""
"The thought that Tavia might have met this man while engaged in her brief and notable stage career, as related in ""Dorothy Dale's Great Secret,"" flashed across Dorothy's mind. With it came a thought of danger--Tavia was scarcely yet cured of her dramatic fever.""Idiots!"" added Dorothy, and she wondered why she so strongly opposed Tavia. ""I'll tell you, Tavia, this business of chatting with strange young men is nothing less than foolish. I can't see where it becomes funny.""Dorothy was accustomed to these outbreaks, and they merely meant a gesture, or whatever fling came with the speech; the words indicated absolutely nothing. She gave Tavia an answering smile. ""Well, dear, we won't quarrel, at least this time. But see that it doesn't happen again.""""I shall be glad to see dear old Dalton,"" replied Dorothy. ""Father and the boys are going with me to settle things up there. Then we will go to Aunt Winnie's. I hope you and I will be able to spend our vacations together. You know I am going to camp with Cologne, and she has included you in the invitation.""""Rose-Mary was particularly anxious that you should come, Tavia,"" declared Dorothy, with emphasis, ""and she has the reputation of never giving an insincere invitation. She likes you, and wants to enjoy you, as well as to have you enjoy yourself.""""Three cheers for the enjoys,"" retorted Tavia, ""and may their shadow never grow less. But say, Dorothy, how did you get out of the scrape? I was a traitor to run, but somehow I couldn't stand for Higley's look. When she puts her alleged features at half mast, and sounds taps, I have to quit.""""There was nothing to hide in our part of the--comedy,"" declared Dorothy. ""Of course, we skipped the man part, and left out the hay cart dump, besides omitting the sheep act, and forgetting the farmer's whip----""""Thanks, pretty maiden. Any more in stock like that?"" and Tavia jumped up to get a look in the glass. ""Tell me, before I shrink--in your opinion,"" she begged, making queer passes before the mirror. ""But say, Doro, do you ever take a look at yourself? I have to say you are simply splendid, and that's putting it mild. The Dalton youths will be suiciding on account of the returned Calla--that lily is the one that stands beings boxed up without food or--atmosphere--for half the year, I believe, hence my comparison: you have withstood Glenwood, and come out of the ring more beautiful than when you entered. Oh, you need not protest! Everybody admits that you are a perfect Dresden, animated, of course,"" and Tavia gazed with unstinted admiration at the girl under the study lamp."
"""Suppose you start in to drag down some of that stuff you insist on taking home, Tavia,"" said Dorothy, indicating the decorations that hung on Tavia's side of the room. ""Then it will be handsome is as----""""Handsome didn't,"" misquoted Tavia. ""I don't mind dragging it down, but I have a mind to get some one to help me. I might give out that we were having a 'doings' and so entice Ned Ebony, and a couple of the others.""""Than I should have used up in expressing the whole art gallery _via_ the Amalgamated Express Company. Now, Doro, I am going to give a dragging-down evening. If you have anything you value, that might get in the drag, take notice,"" and she left the room, to gather in the innocent victims of her plot.Dorothy laughed. She did love Tavia, and once more they were separating from the days and nights spent together at dear old Glenwood. The girls had occupied room ""nineteen"" in spite of the fact that their advance in class entitled them to other quarters, but each loved the apartment, and they had ""grown into it,"" as Tavia remarked.""I believe I had better rescue my things,"" mused Dorothy, ""for there is no telling where the dragging may end,"" and, suiting her act to the words, she promptly put a pile of cushions on the highest chair, and began to take from her side of the room such trinkets as are inconceivably dear to the heart of every schoolgirl.How differently her division of the room was decorated! Tavia had actually drawn a line--clothes line--straight across the room, marking out the territory of each. Dorothy had put up pictures, birds' nests, flags and the home colors, while Tavia had revelled in collapsed footballs, moth-eaten slouch hats, shot through and through, and marked with all sorts of labels, of the college lad variety. Then she had a broken bicycle wheel, in and out of which were laced her hair ribbons and neckties, this contrivance being resorted to in order to save the junk from the regulation pile--it being thus marked as a useful article. There were pictures, too, on Tavia's side of the room, but how they got there one could never guess from a birds-eye view--for the hanging indicated a sudden storm on ""art day,"" without paper-weights. This same blow included the mottoes, and wise sayings; trophies of certain victories in the way of narrow escapes from dismissals, or such mementos as suspicious games outside the school grounds.""No wonder Tavia wants help,"" thought Dorothy, as she hurried to get her own things safely put in the box that stood ready. ""I declare, she has the queerest taste--if such things are included in the taste faculty.""""Enter!"" called Tavia, as she threw open the door, ""and with the kind permission of the fair hostess, proceed to drag. 'Drag if you must this good old bed, but spare my sister's rags, she said,'"" and she deliberately kicked Dorothy's box across the room, while Edna, or Ned, proceeded to ""shoot up"" everything she could reach or at which she could lunge. Cologne, being Dorothy's friend, did the same thing on Tavia's side, Molly Richards, known as Dick, was not particular on which side she dragged, just so long as she got a hold on something.But the warning came too late, for at that very moment Ned had thrown a picture, frame and all, into the box that Dorothy had started to pack the tea set in. There was a crash, and even the reckless girls paused, for the sound of broken china is as abhorrent to any girl as is the bell for class to the Glenwoods.""Oh, no, indeed,"" replied Dorothy, her voice strained, for the set had been a gift from her little brother Roger, and he had used the first money he ever earned to buy it. ""Perhaps I can have it mended.""She recalled how Roger had written that he had a surprise for her; then the arrival of the blue cups and saucers, and the note saying that the boy had sold lemonade, and thus earned his first money. Then, that he had spent the money for that set. And to think that it was ruined, for the crash told the woeful story of many pieces!"
"Dorothy did not feel like finishing her packing. She felt more like having a good cry. She was thinking of home, of her father, the major, then of her brother Joe, older than Roger, and lastly of dear, impetuous Roger himself.""To make amends for our damage,"" continued Cologne. ""Every girl on the floor has contributed to the collection and we venture to present to you the most unique tea set that has ever gone in or out of Glenwood. Here,"" and she set her contribution down, ""is my prettiest piece.""""Speech! Speech!"" came the demand from Tavia's corner, and without further ceremony Dorothy was lifted bodily up on the table and compelled to make a speech. It was a dangerous, undertaking, for the sofa pillows that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere put in so much punctuation that the address might have been put down as a series of stops. However, Dorothy did manage to say something, for which effort she was roundly applauded. After all, the last days of school came and went, and the Glenwood girls had started off for their respective homes before Dorothy had a chance to fully realize that the vacation had really begun, and that each day of that delightful calendar now seemed suspended from the very skies, illumined with the prospects of the very best of good times.Dorothy had promised to spend a greater part of the summer with Rose-Mary Markin at the Markin summer place, a delightful spot on Lake Monadic in Maine. This plan was particularly fortunate, as Mrs. Winthrop White, Dorothy's Aunt Winnie, with whom the Dales had lately made their home, was to go abroad, while Ned and Nat, Dorothy's cousins, had arranged such a varied itinerary for their summer sports, that one might imagine, to hear the schedule, that the particular summer involved must have been of the brand which has neither night nor autumn to mark its limits.But these plans could never interfere with a visit to the Cedars, the White's summer home, and here, on the afternoon of which we write, Dorothy found herself at last surrounded by her family, and submerged in their joyous welcome.""Here, now! No knocking!"" called out the jolly Nat. ""I don't want to be handsome, but I simply refuse to look ten years younger!"" This last was said in imitation of the ""lady-like way"" girls are supposed to have in expressing their compliments.""Here, here!"" called out Major Dale. ""When I was a lad it was considered a crime to keep a mirror in one's room. We used to keep one blind shut to get a reflection on the window pane for the neck-tie business, and we took a chance at the hair-part. But to hear you young ones! What you actually need, boys, is a little of the real thing in training. Why don't you pitch a tent out on your own river here, and go in for roughing it?""""Now that's something like,"" continued Nat, ""and it would do a lot toward patching up a fellow's finances. Let's see. Where's that itinerary? Suppose we make it two weeks at home--on the co-operative."""
"Like the proverbial wildfire, the suggestion spread, until within a short hour the boys, with Dorothy, were out on the river edge, selecting the spot upon which to pitch the ""War Tent""--for war they declared it would be, ""against masculine beauties."" Dorothy found herself so busy planning the boys suits, figuring out what they would require in the way of supplies and furniture, though this last was to be cut down to mere necessities, that she almost felt her own camping days had begun, as Nat expressed it.""Now that comes of having a girl around,"" declared Ned. ""If you had not come, Dorothy, we would never have had that admiration conference, and then we could never have discovered our own beautiful river, for in this case, I don't mind using a correct, and all right adjective, although usually I consider anything adjectivey rather too much of a spread.""He sauntered once more to the river's brink, where a short distance down stream could be seen the _Lebanon_, the family rowboat. Surely the place did warrant the boy extravagant use of ""a correct adjective,"" and did look ""adjectivey"" away into the superlative.Nat found just the spot for the tent, Roger and Joe were racing about like little human greyhounds, intent upon the scent of fun, and Dorothy took time to decide that perhaps this camp would prove as delightful as she expected that one to be, whither, in a few days, she must journey, and leave the dear home-folks, reluctantly, indeed. But then boys' fun always seemed like their idea of Fourth of July--just as noisy and just as unreliable. At the same time they always managed to put it off with a roar, and this roar had already set in for the Blanket Indians of ""Cut-it-out-Camp.""Dorothy had promised her Aunt Winnie not to stay too long away from her, as there were so many things to be discussed before the aunt and her favorite niece should part for the summer. So that, now, Dorothy was hurrying to finish up her part of the camp map, and go back to the Cedars.But Dorothy was gone. She ran along through the twilight-tinted woods, stopping now and then to look at the gray squirrels that capered up and down the trees, some making so bold as to run along the fence at her very side.To call for the boys, Dorothy knew would be worse than useless, for it would simply notify any listener of her fears, so, instead, she walked along boldly enough, even whistling lightly as any Glenwood girl would do ""when in doubt,"" according to the Glenwood code.A queer growl was her answer, and the figure in the Indian suit, with a mask of red cloth, and all sorts of trappings hanging about from belts and straps, actually pointed what seemed to be a real gun at her.Dropping the old-fashioned gun the boy (for such she decided the person was) jumped at her, and grasped her hands, at the same time making an effort to tie them, with a bit of rope from the belt trappings.He had actually succeeded in tying her hands and now held her prisoner with one strong arm about her waist, and with the other hand he was endeavoring to unclasp her beautiful little gold bracelet. Fearing to lose her footing, in her frantic efforts to get free, Dorothy thought quickly. It would be better to lose her jewelry, than to have her life perhaps imperiled.""If you shout--I'll gag you,"" came the astonishing declaration, while the bandit struggled with the bracelet, and almost cut Dorothy's wrist on the knife with which he was trying to cut loose the circlet.Her assailant heard the same voices, and desperately he pulled at the locked bracelet. As he made one final attempt to wrench it from Dorothy's wrist, his knife slipped, and cut clear across his own hand, the blood spurting from a long wound. With a cry he dropped his hold on Dorothy, and attempted to staunch the flow of blood.Freed, Dorothy ran--ran as she felt she had never known she could run! She did not stop to call, although she judged that the boys might be near by; but ran on, across the marshes without any heed to the water, that even splattered up in her face, as she jumped from edge to edge of the rivulets, making her way out to the open roadway. When Dorothy told her folks of what had happened, the boys could scarcely believe the strange story. That any one should actually make such a wild-west attempt at robbery, within reach of the Cedars, certainly did seem incredible. However, there was no disproving the marks on the girl's arms, where they had been rudely tied, nor could any one deny that in the attempt to remove her bracelet her delicate wrist had been badly bruised. At first it was thought best to at once notify the police, but, upon further consideration, Major Dale advised keeping the matter quiet, hoping that some one in the neighborhood would fall upon a clue to the daring young highwayman.""I do hope the mystery will be cleared up before I leave for camp,"" remarked Dorothy, as the family sat in the beautiful library at the Cedars, discussing the strange affair. ""I should never be satisfied with a written account of what may happen, when you find the culprit."""
"""Oh, we can tell you that right now,"" declared Nat, warmly. ""When we find him we will lynch him, burn him at the stake, and have him imprisoned for life. When that sentence shall have been served we will make a fresh charge against him, and perhaps----""""Put him in a reformatory until he is twenty-one,"" finished Ned. ""Well, he deserves it! And to think that we should be almost within call! Dorothy, I am inclined to question the wisdom of your silence. Why didn't you yell like thunder?""""And get all sorts of germs therefrom,"" added Joe. ""Doro, you did just right, and we are thankful that you got off as well as you did,"" and her brother shook his head proudly, as if to say that a mere cousin could hardly know how a closer relative would feel on such a matter.""And I haven't yet told you of the adventure we had at Glenwood, just before school closed,"" went on Dorothy, realizing fully how delighted Roger would be with the tale of the hay wagon accident, as well as that of the scattered sheep. ""We very nearly all lost a week's vacation through it, the principal was so indignant.""With splendid description, and with nothing startling left out, Dorothy went over the story. Even the larger boys became interested, and when she mentioned about the queer man, who sprang from nowhere, and who did things so unlike other people, Ned and Nat exchanged sly glances.""Really,"" said Dorothy, aside to Ned, when she had an opportunity of speaking privately, ""there is something very mysterious about that man. I have an uncanny feeling regarding him, and Cologne told me he had written a letter to Tavia.""""Children,"" called Major Dale, ""if you are going out to look for your bandit, you had best be at it. He will have all his best holding-up-ing done and be off to his cave with the spoils before you--beard him outside of his lair.""Just what Ned was going to confide in Dorothy about the strange man was left unfinished much to Dorothy's disappointment, for she felt that the boys had some important clue as to the identity of the queer character. However, there was no time for further confidences, and she was obliged to run off to her little personal duties, while the boys made ready to explore the woods.They proposed to lie in wait for the bandit for some time, and, if he did not put in an appearance, they planned to explore the woodland for at least half a mile around. They felt sure that they would come upon his tracks not far from the spot where Dorothy had been attacked, for it seemed reasonable to them, that any boy, or man, dressed as he was described to have been gotten up, would not attempt to go far from his hiding place.So they started off. Roger insisted upon going, so Ned took him under his protection, while Joe kept within safe distance of Don Aikins, the young man from Bergen who claimed to be able to do anything, and any one, in the athletic world. He swung his light stick expectantly at the underbrush. Evidently he would be very pleased to have a swing at the boy with the roped-on armor.Meanwhile Dorothy was very anxious. What if the boys should really come upon this daring young villian? What if little Roger should run off, and be overtaken? She almost wished she had never told the whole story, for as she believed it all a wild whim of some foolish boy, she also felt that he would quickly see the danger of his sport. It was the morning after her adventure, and she was able now to regard it with less terror. Still her wrist did pain and she still trembled when she recalled how the knife had slipped, and how easily it could have severed her own vein, instead of severing the skin of the masked bandit."
"She was thinking this all over, while shaking the creases from her lately-packed clothes, brushing the walking skirt, in which she had traveled to North Birchland, and generally putting her things in order, when Mrs. White, gowned for the street, entered the room.""My dear,"" she began, ""I am afraid you will lose the out-door joy of this delightful morning. Why not slip into your riding habit, and take a run on Cricket? He would be so glad to do it himself, poor pony! The boys are so busy with their camping that they forget a young horse wants some fun too.""""I should be glad to, Auntie, but I feel I must get my things straightened out. The night I was packing up, the girls cut up so I had to hurry everything into my boxes in all shapes,"" replied Dorothy. ""But I will take a canter as soon as I have finished,"" and she gathered up the pieces of broken crockery that had remained in her box after the ""fall of China,"" as Tavia designated the accident to her tea set. ""How lovely you do look, Aunt Winnie,"" exclaimed the girl, gazing with sincere admiration at the superb figure in rose broadcloth. ""I do believe you have grown taller!""""It's the style of this gown, my dear. These lines affect the Venus length. Ned declared when he first saw me in this that I was put together in sections--couldn't possibly be all in one piece,"" and she laughed in the deep, velvety tone that, perhaps, more than anything else about her interesting personality, proclaimed her the woman of unmistakable culture.When she was gone, and Dorothy looked out into the inviting sunlight, she hurried with her unpacking, and was soon dressed in the simple tan-colored riding habit, that so well matched herself, as to make her look like a shade of the morning, when she mounted the pretty little bay pony, and set off at a canter along the North Birchland roads.Dismounting, she threw the reins over Cricket's head and allowed him to nibble at the sweet grass. Yes, there were the mandrakes with their finger-shaped leaves. And they were turning yellow. Dorothy gathered a few, then stood up to look about her.""Now I have you,"" she declared, gazing in wonderment at the very good-looking boy who tried in vain to escape from the stirrup in which his boot had stuck. Seeing her opportunity, Dorothy dropped the bridle and crop, and, with both hands, grasped the boy very much in the same manner as he had seized her the day before.""Not just now,"" replied Dorothy, coolly, for she saw that she was quite able to hold him, and that he was really only a very slight young boy. ""I am going to have a try at your game,"" she added, smiling at her versatility.""Well, first I am going to make you secure. See, I just slip this rope around you--you had it all ready with that slip knot,"" and she put it over his head before he had a chance to protest. It fell over his hands, and she pulled the cord tight. Then, as he was standing near the tree, she dropped the rope to his feet, gave it a jerk, and springing around the tree she had him secure with two turns of the hemp, and a knot made after the style of one Nat had showed her how to fashion.Dorothy, however, was determined not to relent, she would hold him a prisoner, she decided, until she found the boys. They would know best what to do. Certainly such a desperado was unsafe to be at large.This was the sequel to the story, Dorothy thought. Would it possibly be safe for her to take the boy's word, and let him go? As he said he would be disgraced, and perhaps her kindness to him might be his clearest lesson."
"""Give them here! Hello, there boys! Did you find him?"" called Dorothy, as that very moment she raised a clump of brush to hide the ""togs"" under, and at the same time she hailed the boys who just turned into the open field from the search through the woods.""Perhaps you both can come to Maine for a stay. Then you would see the great big moose you hear so much about. If they are not to be found alive I am sure we could manage to see some dead,"" said Dorothy. ""Now be good boys, and I'll see if I can arrange that.""She was saying good-bye to her brothers, and a half hour later she had taken her chair in the train bound through New England _en route_ for Maine. The few days spent at home had been so delightful--even her Wild-West adventure had ended up happily, for Royal Drake, the erstwhile bandit, did all he could to make up for his ""crimes,"" and even went so far as to take Dorothy to a big tree, in the hollow of which he had hidden considerable loot, during his try at the ""wild and wooly."" This loot Roy took back to his own home, which had been the first scene of his juvenile depredations. He declared he did get out of a window with the stuff, and otherwise fulfilled the attempt in true desperado fashion, but before Dorothy left him, she felt that he had changed his mind as to the propriety of this line of ""fun.""""I hope I meet Tavia on time,"" Dorothy was thinking, as she neared the station where her companion was expected to board the train. ""If she keeps up her reputation, though, I won't. Something is sure to happen when Tavia goes traveling.""Summer folks were taking themselves and their luggage into the crowded cars. It did seem that the privilege of carrying freight personally was being abused, for old and young were simply bending down under the weight of the stuff for which they struggled to find room in the passenger coaches.""You don't look it. I fancied I saw you sizing up that piece of architecture at the door. Gothic; isn't it?"" and Tavia fell into the chair Dorothy had emptied for her. The ""piece of architecture"" took the sofa at the end of the car, and she appeared to need every bit of it for her hat, and other pieces of luggage.""But look at the glory,"" said Tavia. ""Every eye in the car is on that sofa. My gaze is simply crowded out. Let's want something. Oh, yes. I have lost my--'Porter!'"" called Tavia sweetly, at the same time touching the button at the window. The man in the brass-buttoned uniform turned promptly. ""I have lost my hand bag,"" said Tavia. ""I surely had it when I entered."""
"""Oh, I have it,"" exclaimed the wily one. ""Thank you so much,"" and she smiled clear up and down the aisle. ""I was sure I had it,"" and taking her seat, she managed, in the most conspicuously discreet way, to slip into the porter's palm something shiny.""You might be glad,"" replied Tavia. ""Of all the stupid times--I would have run away but for Johnnie. He took me fishing, and I--wore overalls! Oh, only out in the woods, of course, but it was sport, and I caught fish! It's skirts that hoodoo the catch. I have come to that conclusion.""""_Are_,"" corrected Tavia, ""_are_ dark blue,"" and she wheeled around out toward the aisle just as a young chap in white flannels passed along. He looked down at her in that pardonable way common even in the best style of traveling. Dorothy breathed more easily when he passed out to the next coach.The thought that Cologne might have whispered to Dorothy something about Tavia getting a letter from this man just flashed across her mind. Tavia was always getting into some foolish scrape, and kept Dorothy busy getting her out, and it just occurred to Dorothy that it might not be a bad idea to let Tavia try getting herself out, should she repeat her usual indiscretions of risking too much for the sake of some trifling whim.""There is just a chance that she may be able to make the way train, and switch off at the Junction, then, if she is lucky, she may flag the shore train and get to this spot about midnight. But what would she do then? Better stay out in civilization until daylight.""""Think so? Yes, I like the cap, and it's handy. I've got one for you and one for Tavia--if she ever gets here to claim it,"" and Cologne handed the cap to Dorothy for close inspection. It was a jaunty blue affair with the letters ""C.C."" in gilt. These, Cologne explained, might stand for anything, but they mostly stood for Camp Cologne, or Camp Cozy, or Camp Clamor, although some of the members wanted it Camp Capital, Cologne said.""Don't you think that variety would suit Tavia better than me?"" asked Dorothy. ""I thought you always picked out the real good kind for me, the sort that wear collars all summer,"" and Dorothy laughed at the idea, for the day was warm, and the thought of a stiff collar was rather incongruous.""Well, he must be nice, at any rate,"" replied Cologne, as they turned into a lane, a short cut over the woodland. ""But, say, Dorothy, do you know I believe that fellow--the one who rode the farmer's horse--is out this way? I saw some one who had that same queer gait, and who wore his hat on the side of his head, and I am almost sure it was he. I was not near enough to see his face, but there is something so characteristic about his swing, I am sure I could not be mistaken. Did Tavia tell you anything about the letter?"""
"""Likely she saw something interesting, and determined to make those five minutes grow into ten. She has no respect for time, I know that, and as for the railroads, why it would tickle her to miss a train and make trouble for the next one.""""Yes, we are getting there. Come on, hurry up Jeff"" (this to the horse), ""we must get home by five and we have only three minutes. I promised mother to be back at five, and punctuality is an unbreakable rule of our camp. We made it so because we have always found that tardiness is the ruination of all good summers; even camp life must have rules,"" and Cologne urged the steed to a little faster gait.It was like a picture from an art magazine. The real rafters--no boxed-shaped beams set up like an uncovered porch roof--but rafters, that hung down low, fragrant with the scent of hickory, soft in tint, and brown with the polish and glow of years. Then the big field stone fire-place, with the ""side walk"" all around it, and the pieces of rag carpet!""The mater's idea,"" replied Cologne, enthused with Dorothy's delight. ""There used to be a big house on this farm, but it was burned down. Mother knew the place and we got it. Isn't it a perfect mansion? Mater would not hear of us sleeping in the open--says tents fly away in the night. Let me show you the whole house.""The first floor--for there was a loft--was laid out in a living room, with many luxuries even to a hired, old-fashioned, square piano; the chairs, Cologne explained, had been bought at a second-hand shop along the mountain road; and the man who kept the shop was so surprised to have a call for such odd chairs and tables that Mrs. Markin was able to pick up some splendid pieces for a mere trifle. Then the sleeping rooms, Mrs. Markin's and her daughter's, besides the guest room, were on the first floor, while Jack, the big boy of the family, had his ""bunk"" on the loft, and up there also was a ""bunk"" for any of Jack's friends who might pay him a visit.The first floor rooms were divided by cretonne partitions, or curtains, made secure top and bottom, and the coloring of these screens gave the place an ideal tone in color. The kitchen was outside under a lean-to tent.And the dining room! A broad porch with an uncovered roof. A canvas flap was hung over the roof to be used, or thrown aside, just as the weather ordained. The table was a matter of two ""horses"" and three planks, and the seats were of the same brand, only in a lower grade. The cover was of oilcloth, and the dishes were some wooden and some white enamel.""You see,"" said Cologne, ""Mother did not want us to be working always, so she made the table service a la Indian. We burn most of the dishes when we've used them, and they keep our camp fire going, or rather, they only start it. Then the metal plates are so easy to wash, and so hard to break. Oh, we have camping down to a system! I hope you will like the system.""""Well, come now and have tea--we are to have it alone, you and I, for mother is busy helping Jennie can berries, and Jack is never home until the cows come--we can see herds of them troup over that hill every night."""
"""The only profession that hides the ego,"" broke in Tavia. ""Now that is what I call cozy, to get away from the dear old nosey public. I wonder the whole world does not go in for the stage, and get a chance to walk through the streets, and have folks say, 'Isn't she perfectly sweet!' All the while one could be sticking out her tongue, and otherwise enjoying herself--""""Tavia!"" exclaimed Dorothy. ""Do talk something akin to common sense if you cannot do better. And don't mix up your pronouns. You keep one bobbing through tenses and pronouns as if the thinker were a jack-in-the-box.""""You must not think of such a thing,"" declared Dorothy. ""Since Cologne does not wish you to go in the strange set, you will surely comply, but I do not have to tell you that I am sure you will,"" and she turned away in evident distress.The next morning the three girls started to camp in earnest. Tavia insisted that it was her share of work to fetch one pail of water from the spring, because, she said, she had to stoop down so low, and walk so far the effort was equal to Dorothy's dish-washing or Cologne's muffin-making.Her voice was rather strained, Cologne was annoyed. Tavia jumped up, and, with a most unladylike ""whoop,"" ran from one end of the loft to the other, exclaiming at every new found article of interest. Suddenly she stopped.""And if we take our eyes off it we run the risk of having it under the bed to-night,"" said Tavia. ""Now if only we could shoot a gun,"" and she looked at the line of weapons that decorated the side of the loft.""Wasn't her father a soldier!"" repeated Tavia. ""Cologne you hump down there, and keep your eye on the bear, while we get a gun, and load it. Then if it's all the same to you, I'll do down stairs, and out in the back yard until it is all over. I hate murder close by.""""Not if I can get a gun I happen to know,"" said Dorothy. ""You may both go out in the back yard if you choose. I must try the rifle first--oh, here is one just like father gave Joe his last birthday. I had a mind to borrow it to come out here to Maine woods, but I never dreamed of getting game right in camp.""Dorothy went over to the open window and put the rifle to her shoulder. She pulled the trigger. There was no discharge. Not satisfied with one trial she worked the rifle until there was positively no possibility of any load being in the weapon."
"Over on the wall hung Jack's ammunition box. Cologne was watching at a safe distance. Tavia had gone downstairs by way of a rope that Jack Markin used for descending. Dorothy put the load in, made sure it was all right, then went over to the beast's hiding place. She crouched down and took aim. For several days after the ""hunt"" the girls kept up the joke on themselves. Time after time they threatened to let Jack, and his friend Percy, guess the truth, but Tavia, the most to be feared, did manage to keep the laugh purely feminine.Dorothy and Cologne were gathering berries this morning, while Tavia ran off to a spot where she declared she could get the better kind of fruit, better than any they had yet secured. She turned in back of the big barn, then ran over behind the ice-house, and then she smelled apples, ripe apples.She was still frightened, but a trifle more at ease, since she recognized the man in the big slouch hat. ""Whatever could have brought him here?"" she asked herself. The next moment she was glad--glad that Cologne and Dorothy were out of reach.""The same. I want to tell you""--he stepped up uncomfortably near to her so that his sleeve touched her--""I want to tell you there is a fortune coming to your family, and I can put you on the track to secure it. My uncle Abe""--he seemed to chuckle--""knew about it, he told me, and I had to swear on a Bible covered with blood, that I would never betray his secret!""""Oh, my!"" shuddered Tavia stepping away. ""I don't think I can wait now."" She was thoroughly frightened. ""Couldn't you come down to the camp, and tell me? Then we could talk comfortably. The sun is very hot up here.""""Meet me at the old stone bridge to-morrow at three, and I will convince you of the actuality of this wonderful inheritance--this inheritance which you so long have been deprived of--which you have been fleeced out of by my scheming Uncle Abe!""His eyes flashed, and his voice trembled. Tavia thought she had never before seen such glassy eyes, and the way he fastened them on her gave her a most uncomfortable feeling. She even felt compelled to promise what he asked, and she did so.""No such luck,"" answered Tavia, as the two came up to the apple tree. ""But I did find some splendid apples. Help yourselves. I must sit down for a minute. I've been up the tree--no, up _a_ tree,"" she finished with a laugh that neither of her companions understood."
"""Danger of ignition, I suppose,"" and Tavia's voice was anything but pleasant. ""Oh, there go the Lamberts!"" as an auto swished around the road. ""I must run away and see them some day--just before we go home, when Cologne won't have time, or heart, to scold.""""He's welcome,"" she replied. ""Stagnant good nature doesn't keep well, and I have been keeping mine bottled up ever since you shot that window brush. The shock to my system--"" and she imitated the manner of one affected with nerves.""Yes, it was dreadful on all of us,"" agreed Dorothy, from whom the change in Tavia's manner could not be hidden. ""But you must forget it, and think of the good time we are going to have to-morrow. Think of it! Going out in the real mountains, with real boys for guides! Of course you will have your pick of the boys, Cologne and I must be satisfied with what remains.""Cologne had scarcely spoken since Tavia mentioned the Lamberts, and Dorothy was doing her best to restore good nature and peace to both of her companions. Yet she was greatly annoyed at Tavia's rudeness. Why should she persist in ignoring common courtesy and thus keeping up that Lambert question? After a morning spent in anticipation of the good time Jack had promised (and Jack and his friends did know how to give the girls a good time) something happened just as they were about to start off to the woods.At first the matter was taken as a joke, as it would be quite like Tavia to run off and hide in the hay loft, or in any other outlandish place; but when, after all kinds of calls, and a thorough search of the premises, she failed to be located, there was reasonable alarm among the campers. The Hays girls from Camp Happy-go-Lucky, had joined the party that intended going into the deep woods, so they, too, aided in the search for Tavia.""Don't you worry,"" Jack suggested. ""You will be sure to find out that Tavia has happened to something. She has a faculty for that sort of thing. Let us go off on a day's fun. No use spoiling it all on account of a whim--I am sure it is nothing more.""At this the party set off over the hill to the frog pond. Hazel trudged along with Jack, Brendon Hays divided his attention between Dorothy and Cologne, while a very little young man, Claud Miller, by name, and the midget by reputation, took care of Nathalie Weston, a visitor at Camp Lucky.Not one, except perhaps Cologne, knew the thoughts that stirred Dorothy so riotously. What if Tavia had gone over to Lamberts, and so would incur the displeasure of their hostess? Or, if she had met that queer man? But she could not have done that! Reckless as she was, she could not be unaware of the danger of doing such a fool-hardy thing as that!"
"""Oh, don't run, Claud;"" cautioned Jack. ""It's dreadful on your watch pocket. Just walk over and give my love to the girl who wears the rainbow around her head. Tell her that I saw her and she will guess the rest.""Finally Dorothy broke down, and went to her own room. Cologne followed her, and there, in the secret nook in the big camp farm, the two girls discussed every possible clause of the case, and tried with heroic effort to shed some light on the mystery. Dorothy had always loved her cousins, Ned and Nat, but when they arrived at the camp, the day after Tavia's disappearance, she fancied she had never before fully appreciated them. They came in the _Firebird_, their automobile, and declared that they would camp out in the open Maine woods, cook in the open, make soups of lily bulbs, stirred with the aromatic boughs of the spruce, and otherwise conform to all the glorious hardships peculiar to the pioneers--according to the stories told by said pioneers.""We certainly shall start out at once,"" declared Nat, who was always Tavia's champion, to say nothing of his being her special friend and admirer. ""I have known her to do risky things before, but this is the utmost.""""Now, Doro, dear,"" consoled Cologne, ""you must not look at it that way. It is perfectly surprising what may happen, in a perfectly safe way, after one has found out, while before that time such things seem utterly impossible. Haven't we had lots of that at Glenwood?""""We had a great time in Dalton,"" said Nat, ""the day we went over to see the old place--your old place, Dorothy. The major asked us to go in to look after a leak in the roof, and just as we went into the old plumbing shop we heard a racket. It seems that a fellow named Mortimer Morrison, a stage-struck chap, played a part on the local stage, and while delivering his lines he gave his audience a treat--the real thing in tragics. He went crazy--wild, stark, staring mad! He was an escaped sanitariumite--he got out, found the stage at Dalton, and was having a gay old time when the----"" Nat suddenly stopped. ""What's the matter, coz?"" he asked.Dorothy was sitting on the rustic bench, at the side of the old corn crib, and she went pale as her cousin told the story. Cologne was beside her, and, as Nat asked what the matter was, Cologne grasped Dorothy's trembling hand.""Why the--man! That man! He is the one who saved the team--the one who wrote the letter to Tavia. I found a part of it. She never told me, but it blew open at--my very feet. And that name was on the piece of paper!""""We all knew him--if he is the same one,"" declared Cologne, for Dorothy was too agitated to speak. ""We happened to get in trouble with a hay wagon, and an old team of horses, and he helped us out. Come to think of it he did act queer!"""
"""I was just going to tell you that while we were in the plumbing shop a fellow sauntered by. He wore a hat--like a cowboy, and otherwise looked queer. Well, when the plumber sighted him he rushed to the 'phone and called up the only officer in Dalton--Tavia's father, and told him the lunatic was just sauntering down the road. But from last accounts he was still sauntering--the squire didn't overhaul him.""""It would be impossible to guess to what trick he might resort in order to get Tavia to meet him, or to even become interested in his stage schemes. You know Tavia has a very pardonable weakness for anything theatrical,"" said Dorothy.An hour later Ned and Nat, with Jack and Claud, started out in the _Firebird_, it having been decided that it would be best for all the boys to go together in the auto, as they could then cover any amount of ground, and not have to worry about Dorothy and Cologne. The two girls went their way in the cart, old Jeff, the horse, being looked upon as quite a competent guide.It was really the first good opportunity that Dorothy had had to see the glories of the Maine woods, but what were they to her to-day? What mattered the long lines of spruce, the dainty larch, or the tangled arbor-vitae, to her now?""Suppose we tie Jeff up here, and let him graze, while I go over to that camp""--indicating a white speck between the trees--""and then I may inquire if any one has seen a girl like Tavia pass up Oldtown way?""""Now, Doro, don't go too near the edge of anything. I never saw such edgy-edges as they are up here in Maine. Looks to me as if this part of the world was made last, with the jumping-off places for the men who did the making.""The danger of the spot seemed to fascinate her. Then the thought that perhaps poor, wilful Tavia had fallen down such a place; that perhaps at that very moment, she lay alone, helpless, at the bottom of a cliff!""But there is a road down there,"" Dorothy mused. ""I never would have thought to find a roadway along those rocks. Even the Indians, who very likely, made most of these trails, might easily have found a better and safer road to and from the same woodland ways.""Trundling along the narrow roadway, old Josiah Hobbs and his wife, Samanthy, rode in their farm wagon. They had been to town with berries and in the back of the covered vehicle the empty crates told quite as plainly as the contented smile on the wrinkled faces of the couple, that berries were in demand that morning, and that the Hobbs' kind had met a ready market.""You old skinflint! To cal'late on the half-dead girl,"" and she raised Dorothy's head tenderly. ""But all the same she got to get somewhere, and ours is as near as any other house. Here, take hold,"" she put her arms about the helpless form. ""Mercy on us! Lucky if she don't die before we get her there. Make that horse know he's to go. If that whip won't do, yank up a tree and let him have it.""Dorothy heard a little--she could hear the rumble of the wagon, and she could feel the hard, rough, but kind hand of the woman who smoothed her brow in a motherly way. That in itself was enough to make her close her eyes and feel content."
"After much talk between the farmer and his wife, and many contrary directions, Dorothy was finally enveloped in a nightdress that even Tavia in her palmiest days could not have anticipated. It was big, it was broad, it was long, and it was roomy!Then, outside in the hall room, that was really nothing more nor less than a landing for the unrailed stairs, she thought she could hear the old-fashioned voice of a very old-fashioned man--he wanted to fetch her something, and he didn't seem to care just what.""You loon! How could you tell what she ought to have looked like when her own mother never saw her try? Oh, Josiah,"" and the lines of hardship melted into possibilities, ""wouldn't it have been lovely--if she did--live--to look!""""'Tweren't your fault--nor mine, Samanthy. He knows, and mebby thet's why He sent this 'un. Ain't she purty? And I don't care a durn about the sanitarition folks. Of course--if we've found her--and they want her----""There Dorothy slept. The tin dipper of fresh water was on the wooden chair at her side. The green curtain was drawn down to the very sill of the window. The door was shut--and it was hooked on the outside.How long she slept she could not by any means know, but certainly the sun had sailed around to the window, that wore no curtain, and through which the glint of a fading day cut in like a faithful friend to poor Dorothy Dale.The awful truth forced itself into her fagged brain. She was a prisoner! Why? What had she done? Wasn't that woman kind? And did not the man go to the spring for water? She heard him say so, and he was a feeble old man. Why was she locked--barred in that smothering attic room?""Hush there, now, dearie,"" and she smoothed the hand that lay idly on the red and white quilt, as Dorothy stood beside the bed. ""You'll be all right. Don't you go and get bothered. We've sent fer the doctor, and when he comes, he'll fetch you right home to your maw. But you have got to keep quiet, or else the fever will set in, and then there's no tellin'. I told Josiah that we would do fer you like as if you was our'n, but you must not talk, dearie. You must be mournful still."""
"""I'll leave you a candle--no, I guess I had better jest raise the lattice, and if you wants anything I'll hear you if you knocks. Don't you worry, dearie. Samanthy Hobbs ain't no--well, she ain't, that's all!"" Meanwhile Tavia Travers, the light-hearted, reckless Tavia, realized that she had made a dreadful mistake. It was the second afternoon since she had left the camp, and she was at the railroad station, waiting for something unforseen to develop that would enable her to get back to her friends.""Come with me and I will prove to you that what I say is absolutely correct,"" he declared. ""I have an old uncle out at Breakaway, and he will tell you about the fortune with his own lips--I shall make him do so.""This had convinced Tavia. Surely if they met his sister at the first station, there could be no harm in her going. And though the story about the fortune might be vapory, it was fun to have had such an experience--to actually run away!On they had gone, he telling all sorts of absurd stories about the money, which, he claimed, was actually secreted in his uncle's house. But long before he reached the station at Breakaway Tavia had decided that he was insane--and that _she_ had been insane not to have realized this awful truth before.""When we get to the station I will go on ahead,"" he had said, to her immense relief. ""Then, when I have told uncle you are coming, and I have gotten him into his good clothes--uncle is very vain when there are ladies around--then I shall return for you,"" and he had waved himself like a tall young sapling, in that conceited self-conscious pose peculiar to the stage and to--but Tavia was not sure. Perhaps, after all, he might not be altogether unbalanced.For two long hours she had sat there, then the old station agent hobbled along, and opened the ticket office. Tavia told him something of her plight, but instead of saying that she had come away from her friends on the word of a perfect stranger, she pardonably made the man out to be a distant cousin.""Hum! That fellow with the long hair? Well, I guess they'll git him to-night. He's got loose from the sanitarium on the hill, and there's been a lot of looking for him in the last two weeks. Seems to me he's jest about toured the country,"" said the old man as he dusted the window shelf with his cap. ""I reckon they'll git him now. And you was out with that chap?""Tavia looked out over the gloom that was quickly descending upon the little hamlet. Soon it would be night! No one but that station agent in sight! No place to go, but over the hills to his boarding house, or perhaps to some farm house; where, should she have the courage to make her way through the fields up to a cabin, perhaps fierce dogs, that were already howling and barking, would become more her enemies than would be the cat, and the solitude of the station.""Nice young girls don't often get stranded,"" replied the old man not unreasonably, ""and if I was you I'd keep my trouble purty much to myself. You kin depend upon Sam Dixon. If I say I'll do a thing I'll do it; and no harm will come to you in this here station for a night. Besides, I come over for the ten o'clock train, and I'm back for the milk train before daylight."""
"Something about this speech convinced Tavia she was unfortunate, and it would be best to keep her trouble to herself, for what would strangers care about her predicament? Could she deny that it was through her own fault that she had been thus situated?""I'm goin' along now, and say,"" said the agent, ""if you like I'll just lock the office, and give you the outside door key. There ain't no tramps, but if you should be timid, before I come back, just turn the key in the door.""How Tavia Travers ever choked down the biscuit and the slice of ham that Sam Dixon brought back to her that night--how she actually fondled old gray Switch, and was glad of his friendly purring during that long, dreary night, as she lay cuddled up in the very farthest corner bench--how the night did, after all, go by, and a very gray dawn bring the welcome step or limp of the station agent, only Tavia--poor unfortunate Tavia--could ever know!Sam Dixon had brought her word that she might ride back to his boarding house with him, and share his coffee, but she was to say that she was his niece, and that she was on her way to her grandmother's, ""like little red riding hood,"" chuckled Sam, when he disclosed his plan.Tavia cared little for coffee, but she was weak, and the fear of being again left in the station alone prompted her to accept the well-meant invitation. In fact, she had in her hours of desolation become quite fond of the little old man with the blackthorn cane.Accordingly, when the milk train had pulled out, and the station was again locked, Tavia jumped into the narrow carriage beside the old man, and, asking if he would not like to have her drive, she pulled up the reins, and they started off.Here was a new experience. If only now she could forget the agony that Dorothy must be experiencing, it would not be so dreadful to go at this early morning hour, over the dewy roads, in the ramshackle buggy with her benefactor at her side.""Not so very. You see, it has always been rather rough out this way--lumbermen and the like always puttin' up at Dobson's. That's why I thought you was better off in the station, than to try to make your way about last night. And some of them rough fellows stop at my place--that's Dobson's--so while they're out now is your chance to get a hot drink.""""Yep, he's one of the sort,"" taking care to keep his smile focussed on the man, who although he was going in the opposite direction was able to keep his eye on Tavia. ""You see they are the most suspicious set--takes a man a lifetime to know them, a woman an eternity, and then she has to depend upon their good nature.""Tavia smiled, and hurried the old horse until his ears ""sassed her back."" They jogged along--every moment nature was getting more and more wideawake, until Tavia feared she would really wake up to the magnitude of her own personal offence, everything else seemed so straightforward and so upright!""Oh, that would be splendid!"" exclaimed Tavia. ""I would willingly wait over even if I had a chance to go sooner, for you have been so good to me, Uncle Sam,"" she said warmly. ""I shouldn't want to go until I had done something for you.""""Then it's a bargain. While you're eatin' your coffee, I'll grab up the things, and you kin mend over in the station. We'll stick to the story that you are my niece, and you kin come inside the office and mend all you like, and it ain't nobody's business. You see, sister died last year, and I ain't had nobody to fix up the things for me since.""The house before which he drew up was of the old Colonial type--the posts had been white, and imposing at some time, but they were now neither white nor any other true color. Also, they threatened to topple over on the vines, that so kindly did their part in trying to make the old place look alive.An old man sat on the porch, smoking his pipe. Sam Dixon spoke to him as he passed around the house to get the horse his breakfast. Presently a woman, enveloped in gingham dress, and lost in a gingham sunbonnet, came out and stood in wonderment, looking at Tavia. She glared at her for a moment or two, and then, without speaking a word, entered the house again. This was not a very cordial welcome for Tavia, but she patted the horse, and pretended not to notice the slight. Then Sam came limping along with the oats in a nose bag for Major."
"""Now eat,"" ordered Sam, ""and----"" Then it struck him that he had not fixed on a name for his ""niece."" Tavia saw his embarrassment, but before she could suggest a name, he added, ""Betsy, you and me's hungry too, I reckon. Let's see what Sarah has to eat in the kitchen.""They entered the house, and soon were seated on the old-fashioned hickory chairs, before some steaming cakes, and equally steaming coffee. Tavia was indeed hungry, and she ""fell to,"" as did Sam, without any unnecessary ceremony.What an eternity it seemed since she stole away to that little bridge--she could not bear to think of it now! And what would Dorothy think. Ah, how little Tavia knew what poor Dorothy was thinking at that very moment!""Why, a girl has 'scaped from the hospital. 'Tain't very safe fer a strange girl to be around here now. It might be her,"" and she shot an unmistakable threat at Tavia. ""Ain't never heard you speak, before, of Betsy, Sam. Where's she bin?"" When Dorothy awoke, to find herself still in that attic room, to know that it was not all an awful dream, but a terrible reality, the full meaning her position flooded into her strained mind, like some awful deluge of horror!That the people who held her captive did so for some undefinable reason was perfectly clear; but why they did so, was just as mysterious as was their reason for plying her with coddling words, as if she were a baby.""Well, I may sleep a little more,"" she said, ""and then when daylight comes, I shall be ready to start off. Would you mind handing me my jacket. It has my purse in it, and I want to make sure that it is all right.""""I have no mother,"" insisted Dorothy. ""I told you that my name is Dorothy Dale, and my father is Major Dale of the United States army. If any one attempts to--wrong me, _he_ will see that they are punished.""""Oh, I am sure Mrs. Hobbs you have been kind,"" Dorothy said, in a sobbing voice, ""but you see how dreadfully hard it is to be kept away from one's friends. Why, I don't dare to think how they feel! How my cousins are worrying, and, of course, they have sent word to father. Oh, dear Mrs. Hobbs, help me to get back! Help me to get away to-day, for if I don't--they will think I am--dead!""The woman looked keenly into Dorothy's blue eyes. She smoothed back the pretty, neglected yellow hair, and she brushed the flaming cheek kindly. ""I would not harm you for the world,"" she declared, ""for if you are not the lost girl--you are--an angel!""She could hear the old farmer grumbling. Evidently he was not pleased about something. But Mrs. Hobbs was cautioning him not to speak so loud. Of course they were afraid of being overheard. ""If she opens the window,"" Dorothy decided, ""I'll drop to the piazza roof! Then I can escape! Oh, I must escape!"""
"She dare not, however, make any preparations to get away until after the farmer had gone to town; until after Mrs. Hobbs had opened the window and until after--she hoped this would happen--after Mrs. Hobbs went off to the fields for her berries. ""You kin mend furst rate, Betsy,"" complimented old Sam Dixon, as Tavia plied her needle in the little ticket office, ""and do you know, I've taken quite a shine to you? You might be my niece if you liked. I have a penny or two, and there ain't no pockets in shrouds.""""Even Sam Dixon can't live forever, sis, and you know it's sort of lonely to think, that, when he goes, there won't be no one to think of him, like he thinks of them. That's why I want your name and address. But there comes the train from the city. Would you mind attendin' to the window while I run out with the mail bag?""Well, she might as well be content now. It was too late to get a ticket, too late to say good-bye to Sam, too late to do anything but attend to the people who came in the station after the train pulled out.The speaker, who had just alighted from the train, addressed Tavia, but the latter was so surprised that she caught her finger in the ticket stamper. Before the little window stood a young woman in the garb of a nurse--and she wanted the carriage from the sanitarium.""Well, since you are going to be around here we may as well get acquainted--I shall probably have plenty of calls at the station. I see you are the whole service outfit. The telephone, telegraph, and, I suppose, the--Press Bureau.""""What a charming name--Betsy Dixon! Quite like a--bullet from Molly Pitcher's gun,"" said the nurse. Tavia smiled but failed to catch the significance of that remark. Betsy was a good old name. Why like a war bullet?""Why, Mary Bell!"" replied Miss Bennet. ""How glad I am to see you! And what a surprise! You are the new nurse! And I never knew it. I'm just starting out on such an interesting case! A young girl, the dearest little thing, has escaped from the sanitarium, and I came out with the carriage to hunt her up. We had word last night that an old farmer--named Hobbs--had caught her. It may not be true, but I am going out there to see. It's a lovely ride. Can you come?"""
"Laura Bennet slipped into her friend's coat and took the little Panama hat that Miss Bell handed to her. ""Then you will go after the girl and return her to the sanitarium? It will be your first case. Can you manage it?""Miss Bell got into the wagon with the driver from the sanitarium. Tavia was wishing that the drive had been in the other direction, for then she could have gone in the carriage perhaps, and have caught a train at the switch station. That she was staying so long away from camp now began to worry her. What would Dorothy think!""Why, yes, that's so,"" replied Sam. ""Of course I'd like to keep you, Betsy. You make a first-class assistant agent. But I know how you feel, and I wouldn't have you stay longer than you wanted to. There'll be a train here soon for the Junction, and if you are sure you can make the other--you'll have to flag it with your handkerchief--then, if you get left, there will be no train either way. I don't know as you ought to risk it.""""Oh, I can manage very well,"" she assured him. ""I'll take the train, and get the other from the Junction, all right. I am so much obliged to you. I would love to stay longer, if I could, but perhaps I may be able to come up again while I'm at camp."" She tried to fix up a little, it was so miserable to have had one's clothes on all night.""You feel better now?"" asked the woman. ""I have to go over the hill for berries--we have a great crop to-day, and Josh had to go away on business."" If only Dorothy knew what business! ""Do you think you'll be all right if I fetch you something to read?""""Here's a book. I got it off last year's Christmas tree, but I ain't had no time to read it."" She handed Dorothy a volume bound in red and inscribed ""Myrtle and Ivy."" There was nothing to show whether it was an agricultural guide, a spiritual retreat, or a love song.""Yes, then I'll be off. Only let me tell you one thing dear,"" and the woman came up very close to Dorothy, ""you must promise me not to try to get away until I can take you to the station. Josh has the wagon."""
"Dorothy felt queer--she had reason to be grateful to Mrs. Hobbs, and to give a promise would involve an obligation. Yet she must make her escape. Some disturbance downstairs saved the girl further anxiety on the question of the promise. Mrs. Hobbs ran down to the door, and she did not return.The summer morning hours sent in their greeting through the small window that opened above the porch. Dorothy was nervous, she must leave just as soon as she saw Mrs. Hobbs disappear over the hill, when she would be out of the sight of the house. And her purse was gone! Well, once out on the clear roadway, surely some one would befriend her. What a dreadful thing it was to be a prisoner! And not to know why she was imprisoned! Her beautiful hair had not been combed in two days. Dorothy did the best she could to make it smooth with her side comb, but the depth of the hair, and the size of the comb, made the matter of actual hair-dressing a difficult task. But there was fresh water in the basin, and she could wash, which was one comfort. ""If only I had my purse,"" she thought, ""with my little looking glass. Well, it will scarcely matter how I look--so long as I do not attract attention.""The window frame was that sort that runs to the roof and has not far to go. It was really not half a window, but it was large enough for the girl's slim form to slip through. It was no distance to the roof, then she could slide down the post.She was puzzled and alarmed until she saw a big, green parrot in a cage. And the bird was screeching to the limit of its capacity. Mrs. Hobbs could hear it! Should Dorothy throw a mat from the porch over its cage!Snatching up a stick, Dorothy made an attempt to strike the green thing as it flapped toward her. But she could not hit it! And if she turned to run it would likely settle its claws into her head. Yet she must run! Mrs. Hobbs--""My name is Dorothy Dale, and for some reason I have been--hidden away from my friends,"" said Dorothy bravely. ""I was just about to ask you to assist me to get back to them. I was in camp at Everglade."""
"""Why, of course I will assist you!"" replied the nurse in the most affable manner. ""Get right into the carriage, and we will have you back at camp in no time."" Dorothy hesitated. The nurse consulted a small note book.""Strange, I feel so nervous about falling into traps,"" said Dorothy honestly, looking deeply into the eyes that were investigating every feature of her own fair face. ""But you see I did fall, literally, and----""""Of course, and you were hurt."" Dorothy could not understand that caressing manner. It was identical with that exercised by Mrs. Hobbs. ""Now, come,"" and Dorothy did step into the carriage. ""We will drive along quickly, so that we may reach camp before luncheon. James, hurry your horse.""For a few moments Dorothy felt as if she must collapse. The strain of her escape from the old house, then her fright from the bird, and her fear that Mrs. Hobbs would overtake her. And now to be actually riding back to camp! What would her friends say to her? Oh, how good it would be to relieve them of all their anxiety, and to be really going back well--comparatively well, at any rate. Tavia got off the train at the Junction, but she did not get on the one that went toward Clamberton--it flew by. She waved her handkerchief--she waved her coat, she told herself she waved her soul, but that train simply would not stop.She moved along for a hundred or so of ties, then she threatened to sit down. Tavia was desperate, but even in her present surprising state of mind, the railroad ties were too much for her, and she kept on.""Well, I suppose if I try to walk this thing I shall presently find myself holding a session with some slimy, muddy frogs. Ugh!"" and she looked between the ties at the lurking depths of mud and other things on either side of the railroad embankment. ""I just hate--uncertainties.""The place was very lonely. Tavia realized this. She knew instantly that she was in the woods. It may have been her primitive hatred of the forest that inspired this sentiment, but there was always something about the depths of solitude that made her want to laugh--it was positively funny to her. Something must happen."
"She picked out a few more ties, and came to another and larger culvert. ""Suppose a train should come,"" she gasped. The strain of the past few days was having its natural revenge--reaction. Her depression had soured into hilarity. ""Well, I'll run the bridge--I have always heard it is the only safe way."" She looked up, far beyond the ties. She would have closed her eyes, but that strange feeling of sight-security, which does not depend upon sight, compelled her to look--but not at the ties.Those who knew Tavia would scarcely have recognized her now, could they have viewed her through the glass with which she was magnifying her faults. Tavia had been tried, she had tried herself, and after having had an opportunity to board any of three trains going toward camp, here she was again--stranded!""I'm a first-class simpleton,"" she decided. ""Dorothy was right; always right. I'm a rattle-brain; and they think I am drowned. That is more reasonable, and more charitable, than to think I could be so foolish.""""I guess I couldn't get along very well without Dorothy,"" she went on thinking, as she trudged forward. ""She always kept me together. But at least I'll try to do her training justice now. I'll try to walk back to camp.""A narrow path ran beside the rails. This, Tavia thought had been trodden down by tramps. Beyond, there seemed nothing but woods, and it was getting dusk. Well, there must be houses or huts somewhere, and she would walk on.It moved swiftly--now she could see it was--not a person! But it couldn't be anything else, since there really were no ghosts. But were there really none? Just now Tavia felt as if nothing was certain, not even her own personality.""I love to fly--it is my one ambition in life. But they would never let me, so I just came away by myself; and isn't it sweet of you to meet me away out here? There, did you see that bird? That's the way to fly,"" and the strange girl threw her arms up and down, until Tavia wondered whether she could be fooling, or was really insane.For the moment Tavia felt like running away. Then she thought that would not be wise, for how did she know but that the girl might have the strength they say insane people have; and that she might hit her with a stone, or do something to injure her? Besides, it seemed better to be with her than alone in that woods. Tavia decided she would humor her."
"For some moments they walked along in silence. The two girls were as different in dress and manner as were Dorothy and Tavia, and the latter noticed how much like Dorothy the strange girl was. About the same height, same colored hair, and the same deep, blue eyes.Tavia hoped it was true. She had passed through the stage of sensitiveness, and was now only anxious to get somewhere or near somewhere, for the night. She had made up her mind that she would ask the first person she met to help her, with money or by directing her to shelter. There was no longer any doubt as to her distress--night was coming and she was almost worse than alone, and in the woods.""There! There!"" exclaimed the strange girl. ""There is my flying station! See that precipice?"" pointing to a cliff far out on the ledge of the hill over which they were walking. ""Just over there is my station. I told you I was Bird of Paradise. I am not--I am Madam Fly-Fly, the French balloonist. Now watch me!""Then she turned cautiously, and started down the dangerous descent herself, clutching at brush and bramble as she tried to reach the girl, who might be dead, in the moss and rocks that made such a beautiful setting for the stream rambling on, unmindful of the terror on its brink.""This looks like a path,"" she said. ""Yes, it is a path. See, the brush is trodden down, and the ferns are broken. Oh, some one must have been here lately, and that means that they can not be very far away now!""""No, not exactly ill,"" and Mary Bell had her own very serious doubts about the condition of the young patient--never had she seen a demented girl so perfectly sane. ""But it is best for you to await your own doctor's orders,"" she finished.""You think I am--demented,"" she asked finally. ""But there is some great mistake. I am Dorothy Dale of--Dalton. I was camping at Everglade--and I have had a dreadful time of it since I fell, and was picked up by that old farmer.""Dorothy's eyes were full. She had made up her mind, since her escape from the Hobbs house, that she must wait--wait until those around her saw their mistake. At any rate, it was something to be among intelligent people, if they were nurses and doctors, and as they plainly believed her to be an escaped patient she must wait until some one came to identify her. But now it was very hard, and she was very, very lonely, and very nervous with those poor demented people singing, sighing, laughing and calling from all over the place."
"""I never had a nurse since I had the measles,"" said Dorothy, and she really felt inclined to laugh. ""Would you mind if I sat up at the window? I feel perfectly strong now, and I want to remember what the blessed world is like.""""I should think you would. It is enough to turn one's own head. Oh, I do wish some one who knows me would come! My father and all my folks will be frantic. Is there anything more dreadful than being lost in the Maine woods!""""But nurses cannot make tests,"" answered Miss Bell. ""We have to wait for the dear professional, all-powerful doctors to do that. This is my first day here, and I think I am going to be almost as lonely as you are.""""He has a faculty for inducing people to leave,"" said Miss Bell. ""We hope we will soon be able to catch him--then it is not likely that he will get another chance to exercise that faculty. Three patients left the day that you did.""""It may have been the mark left there by Mrs. Hobbs' parrot,"" said Dorothy, ""or it may be one of the scratches I got when I fell over the cliff. You see, I have been having a dreadful time. But when it is all over I will have something worth talking about, to tell at camp. I hope you will call upon us there. You would not be lonely if you knew our boys.""""But the girl--if she is still at large, she may be dead or injured,"" said Miss Bell, showing more and more that she did not believe Dorothy to be the person wanted in the sanitarium. ""I must ask--did no one here know you--or her? Must we wait for that one doctor?""""It seems to me a perfectly plain case of mistaken identity, and as you knew neither me nor the girl wanted, I do not see how you could have done otherwise than to take me. I am sure I must have looked and acted--demented.""""That _man_ Morrison has been seen,"" she said to the other nurse. ""And two more Mary Harriwells have also been seen. Strange thing how many girls can get demented when _one_ is looked for. But the man--they say he is not safe.""""Tavia Travers,"" repeated Miss Bell. ""A girl who says she is Tavia Travers was seen going along the road with the supposed Mary Harriwell, and of course if she is helping her hide, she may be arrested. Is she a friend of yours?"""
"The girl rested her head against Tavia's shoulder. Whatever compunction Tavia had felt for her part in the unfortunate state of affairs, she felt at ease now in the thought that she had saved this girl. That the hospital men were attending to Morrison, and that he would soon be out of reach of harming her, also consoled Tavia.Tavia wondered if she was doing right or wrong in not making her presence known. Then she thought how hard it would be to have Mary again placed in a sanitarium, and she decided to fight her way alone. But it was getting dark. They could now barely see the men lifting that struggling form into the closely-covered wagon.The strange girl was indeed light in weight. Naturally slight, her sickness had also taken flesh from her, so that when Tavia put her arms about her, and the other threw her arms over Tavia's shoulders, the two trudged along over the rough path, and soon were out on a roadway.""And the queer part of it is,"" said Tavia, ""I am supposed to be a joke--to get and take everything funny. This is certainly no joke. How do you feel, dear? I hope these people will let us in. We may get some camping days after all.""Tavia had lighted a candle that was placed conveniently near the flap, with matches at hand, showing that whoever lived in the tent intended to return at dark, and so had their light ready. Beside this candle was a printed slip of paper. Tavia read: When Miss Bell returned to Dorothy's room in the sanitarium, after her talk over the telephone, Dorothy saw that her anxiety had reached a state of prostration. She seemed convinced that she had taken to the institution the wrong girl, and the dread of disgrace, especially as she was a new nurse in the house, seemed to weigh very heavily upon her. She would come up and look into Dorothy's face, examine the pupils of her eyes, and then go away sighing.Night came, and the nurse lay down to rest. Dorothy pretended to do the same thing, but she had resolved to get out of that sanitarium, without bringing disgrace on this young woman. But the attempt would be fraught with danger. If she were caught, not only would she be returned to the sanitarium, but she knew there was another ward----Dorothy did not permit herself to think of this. ""I am going to get away before daylight,"" she said. ""Then, when the mother of the missing girl comes and I have gotten away, they will not know whether it was her daughter, or me.""""The nurse's clothes!"" thought Dorothy. ""If I could get into Miss Bell's things! They are here--in her suit-case. Then I might walk out! But I would faint if they spoke to me? No, I would not, I must have courage! I must be brave! In getting out I may save my dear folks more anxiety, and I can save this poor little woman!"""
"Every hour the clock struck in the outside hall, but Dorothy heard it in her prison room. Her mind was first forming this plan, and then that, until she felt, if she did not get some sleep, she would never be able to carry out any plan at all. Finally, as the steps and voices in the hall grew fainter, Dorothy did fall asleep, but only to wake with a start just as the clock struck five.A tap sounded at the door. Miss Bell was dressed and waiting. The nurses were going down to breakfast, and as she left Dorothy, with a pleasant word, the other attendant stepped in, picked up a novel, and without noticing Dorothy, any more than if she had been wooden, she sank lazily down in a chair, and started to read.How could Dorothy get on her disguise now? She sighed heavily, and almost gave up her plan. But not quite, for in desperate straits one clings to the proverbial straw, and now Dorothy was clutching frantically at--anything--at hope.""I guess she'll keep,"" Dorothy heard her say, and with that the nurse stepped out of the door, and Dorothy heard a laugh in the hall. But she did not yet dare to move. In another moment the woman returned. ""I have got to go out for a minute,"" she said; ""just take this pill and sleep. You look tired.""That was all the attendant wanted. Quickly she went out, and then Dorothy jumped up. It was but a moment's work to open the suit-case, and slip on the plain, white, linen dress. Then for something on her head. Yes! the cap, there it was all ready to be put on for the day's work. The looking glass reflected a new Dorothy!He looked up at the big clock. ""If it was right--it wouldn't be here,"" he replied with a laugh. ""But don't get lost. You are on duty at seven,"" he went on, ""but I guess a sniff of air won't do you any harm. We all take what we can get in that line.""Over the stone walk she sped. She glanced down the path. The front gate was impossible. Back of the institution she saw a great barn--then water! Oh, if she could but pass the stablemen. They would not be as keen to suspect as would be the guards."
"Every one seemed busy. They were cleaning the horses, and fixing up the big stables. Merry morning words floated through the air, and it seemed to Dorothy that her presence, that of a nurse, as they supposed, was always the signal for some joke, or some frivolous remark. But there was no harm in this, she thought. Inside of stone walls everybody must be akin.Instantly there was confusion, and Dorothy was forgotten. Up on the terrace were patients out in the air with guards, and in that direction dashed the horse, while every man from the stable ran after it.""That's the alarm for me!"" she told herself, ""but they can never see me in this narrow pass. How fortunate that no one saw me take the boat. And I suppose they think I escaped from the front gate during the excitement about the horse.""Dorothy was right in her surmise. So reasonable did it seem that she had passed out by the front gate, when the guards came to the rescue of those in danger from the frightened horse, that no one thought of looking at the rear of the institution.The water was as smooth as glass, and in the sunshine that every moment became more insistant, Dorothy, in her linen dress, paddled away with all the skill she had acquired in dear old Glenwood School lake. She had discarded the nurse's cap, and the coat, and as her own suit was beneath the linen, she was only waiting for an opportunity to discard the skirt.Fortunately, he was so interested in looking at his game that he thought it not worth while to look at whoever might be passing in the skiff; so, once more, Dorothy slid out of danger down the placid stream.In all her trouble she had kept the little watch and her compass, and just now it occurred to her that by consulting the magnetic instrument she could tell whether she was going in the direction of Everglade.How lightly she paddled along! It seemed now that the sanitarium was past finding, for the noise of the bell and the whistle had ceased, and that everything, even the talking of the man to himself as he pulled the deer over his shoulders, was gone, and Dorothy was all alone on the delightful lake, moving toward camp. It all seemed like some horrible dream--all but the thought that she was going back--back to her dear ones, who must be so anxious.She slowed up, to gather some water lilies. ""I'll take them to Cologne,"" she thought. ""I wonder where the girls are? I suppose scouring the country for me. Well, Tavia must have been found, at any rate. Poor foolish Tavia! I hope they have not blamed her.""""Are they after me?"" she thought, and her heart jumped. ""I must have some excuse ready if they question me. I will just say I am from Camp Capital, and have come out for exercise. They may not know how far away our camp is."""
"That was the first time this had occurred to her. But the canoeists were now actually looking very pleasantly at her--two young men. They seemed too well-mannered to speak, and Dorothy wanted so much to speak with them, now that she felt they had no idea of her predicament.""No, not yet, although many have wanted to. But we have so many people lost in these woods every summer, that we feel it is a case of that kind. We suppose the girls, who did not go off together, met later somehow, and in trying to make their way back, got deeper into the woods.""""We have not been to see them,"" said the young man, ""but some of the boys there are friends of ours, and as soon as we have looked this place over, as well as we can do it, we are going up to Everglade. The girl's father is an old soldier, and they say he is still a soldier in this trouble.""Dorothy felt as if she must speak--must ask them to take her back to the camp, wherever it might be. But suppose they should take her for that demented girl? No, she must find her way on alone. Perhaps she could follow them.A signal had been arranged to notify those in the woods if any good news came, and as Major Dale placed his daughter in the arms of Cologne, Mrs. Markin ran out of doors, and blew the big horn, until she had no more breath left.""You must not think of her,"" insisted Mrs. Markin, bringing in some warm tea. ""You have done enough for her. Of course,"" she hurried to add, seeing the look that came into Dorothy's face, ""we will find her, but you are not to leave this camp--well, I don't know when we will let you leave it again.""""I have had a great time exploring,"" said Dorothy, sipping the refreshing tea, ""and I think, Cologne, that there are many kinds of camping days. But if you will only let me go out, I have an idea I know where Tavia might be.""Ned stood looking down at Dorothy, to make sure that she was in the flesh. Mrs. White had not been told of Dorothy's disappearance. They felt, however, that they would have had to notify her had Dorothy remained away until another sundown.She pleaded and begged, and at last Mrs. Markin agreed that it might be best to let her have the freedom of the air. Of course, Dorothy had not yet told all of her story--all the folks knew definitely was that the lost had been found.Wise Dorothy was, of course, not opposed. She belonged to the class of persons who seem to be capable, and who really are, except where their own personal safety or comfort is concerned. They always have a reason and an answer, simply because others do not take the trouble to fathom the motive for this sacrifice. Dorothy had determined to find Tavia, and whatever her excuses, they were all subservient to that motive.The young ladies from the neighboring camp had decided not to go on the water--in fact their chaperon had refused to allow them to go; ""there had been so many horrible accidents around there of late,"" she declared.Major Dale stood upon the bank, and watched his daughter. To the others it might seem like a dream, but to him it was very real. Dorothy had been such a daughter, and even now she was proving herself the Major's ""little corporal."" Nor did Dorothy miss the look that had buried the smile on her father's face."
"""But it is strange how secret some places can be kept,"" said Dorothy, cautiously. ""It seems that they are so afraid of--publicity. There! That looks like the place where the canoeists went ashore. No, it is farther up, near the willow. We must pull in there and search. I do wish I could have--but what is the use of wishing.""A sense of horror stole over Dorothy as she again stepped into the woods, but in her brave way she instantly decided that it was merely a matter of reflection, and the question in hand was not one of memory, but one of facts. Tavia was still somewhere in those woods, or she was--No, she must be in the woods!""Well, we must get her,"" said one of the men. ""She walked right past me, and said 'good morning.' But how was I to know who the new nurse, or the new patient was? The trouble is now with the mother. She is beyond consolation."" The boys from Camp Capital, together with their neighbors, held a consultation there in the woods. They had heard from the sanitarium attendants that, not only had a young girl escaped, and not yet found, but that some weeks previously, a man, ""stage-struck,"" as they put it, had gotten away, and it was to his help that the departure of the girl was attributed. Dorothy, from her hiding place, heard all this, and knew only too well that the man referred to was none other than Morrison.""Oh, he just talks in a rambling way about a girl who, he declares, should have a fortune that his uncle has hidden away. He has really never been entirely off, but one of the kind who rides a hobby, you know,"" said the man. ""His hobby is theatricals.""""But has he an uncle? Might he have taken a girl to that man?"" persisted Ned. ""You see, we have reason to believe that the girl we are in search of, met this man. Now, if he has been captured, what has become of her?""""That's one of the questions we may have to answer before our Board of Inquiry,"" replied the man with no small concern. ""It is easy enough for those lunatics to get away, but to get them back is harder. And the girl's mother is a widow, with all kinds of money.""Dorothy could scarcely keep still. Only the pressure of Cologne's hands kept her from telling what she knew of the story. Then the fear of again being mistaken for Mary Harriwell--that was too great a risk."
"""Yes. The station agent at Lexington tells a story about a girl coming to him and staying in the station alone all night. But he declares she had dark hair and brown eyes, while Mary Harriwell is a blonde. Others about the station agree with him. That girl left for the Junction night before last, and was not picked up dead or alive since. The officials of the road have had searched every inch of the track. Seems that old Sam Dixon is very worried about this because he let the girl go. He did not know just who she was, but to hear him talk you would think it was his daughter. Well, we must go beating farther along. This searching, and with night coming, is no fun. We wish you luck, and if you find your girl let us know.""So the parties separated and then Dorothy was free to leave her hiding place. She longed to tell her friends the strange story, but she knew that the finding of Tavia was the one and only thing to be thought of just then.""Let me!"" suggested Dorothy. ""I can open it, without hurting him,"" and she stooped over her cousin. ""Oh, you poor boy! It has cut right through your shoe. Now, Jack, just hold the end of the chain so that it cannot slip back,"" she ordered. ""Cologne, dear, can you unlace this shoe?""""I heard something!"" declared Dorothy, and the sound came from back of the hill. ""Boys! Boys!"" she shouted, but they were now too far away to answer promptly. ""Don't try to follow, Cologne. I feel that I can run like the wind. I heard Tavia's voice, and I heard it--right--over--there!""As she flew through the woods Cologne, in distress, tried to summon the boys. She feared Dorothy would fall again, over some rock or cliff. But there was no use trying to stop her. She had heard Tavia's voice, and that was enough."
"It was Dorothy who jumped from rock to stone, and over bush and bramble, through that deep dark wood, which now, in the shadow of sunset, threatened again to bring anguish to our young friends. ""I heard you,"" she called. ""Answer again!""Cologne was doing her best to reach Dorothy, but she had made a turn to notify the boys, and was really too surprised, and frightened, to make anything like the progress that her friend was able to make through the rough forest.Dorothy stopped and listened. She had reached a cleared spot, where the branches of a beautiful fir stood out over a greensward, like a natural tower. Without hesitating a moment, Dorothy easily scaled the strong branches, and presently could see from the height of the fir tree a spot--ideal! Yes, and there was something white on it!Glad to get away, Cologne turned, just as the boys came racing over the hill. They stopped, at her raised hand of warning, but Nat would not go back when he heard that Tavia had been found. Softly he made his way along, Ralph following at some distance, while Ned and Jack hurried to the shore near where they had left their boats. They knew that just across the river they would find a camp, in which might be found Dr. Ashton, from New York.""Every girl says that,"" he replied. ""I suppose it would be a first rate thing if a fellow did only know--about a girl like you."" He was doing his best to quiet her, and he knew that to scold is a good sort of treatment for too much nerves.""And put her in the boat--well, I think that will be all right,"" answered the doctor. ""The present trouble is more of a morbid fear than anything else,"" and he put his stethoscope in its case. ""As soon as she feels the fresh air, and realizes that she is out of all harm's way, I think she will----""It was a delightful task to assist the sick girl, realizing what it would mean ultimately. Dorothy insisted that Tavia go on ahead with Cologne, as she had had, Dorothy said, enough of nursing. But Tavia wanted to leave some word at the tent--a written word about its use. To this no one would agree, so she was obliged to go on without doing as she wished.Down the cliffs started the party. Tavia, with Cologne, was soon joined by three of the Hays girls, from the next camp, who, although they had not been allowed to go with the searching party, managed to follow them at a distance, and who had heard of the discovery when the boys went for the doctor.With a word to Mrs. Markin, the major agreed. It was not so long a journey when the straight road was taken--it was the turns and twists that led every one astray. But Major Dale knew the road, and he and Dorothy went merrily on, with words of love and tenderness that only such a father and daughter know how to exchange.Dorothy learned that the boys, Roger and Joe, had not heard a word of her trouble, and she at once determined not to tell even her father all that she had suffered. She had to explain, of course, about being in the sanitarium, but about the Hobbs imprisonment, she decided to say nothing.Reaching the sanitarium, Dorothy shuddered as she asked the guards at the gate if she might see the superintendent, but when the man doffed his cap to the distinguished looking major, Dorothy again gained her composure."
