passage
"""Well, if this yellow fuzz of a head and this pinky peach of a face is like anybody in the world except Patty Farnsworth, I'll give up! Why, she's the image of you,--except when she makes these grotesque grimaces,--like a Chinese Joss.""It was mid-April and the Farnsworths had been married more than a year. On their return from France, they had looked about for a home, and had at last found a fortunate chance to buy at a bargain a beautiful place up in Westchester County. It was near enough to New York for a quick trip and yet it was almost country.The small settlement of Arden was largely composed of fine estates and attractive homes. This one which they had taken was broad and extensive, with hundreds of acres in lawns, gardens and woodland. It was called Wistaria Porch, because of an old wistaria vine which had achieved astounding dimensions and whose blooms in the spring and foliage later were the admiration of the whole countryside.The house itself was modern and of the best Colonial design. Indeed, it was copied in nearly every detail from the finest type of Colonial mansion. Though really too large for such a small family, both Patty and Bill liked spacious rooms and lots of them, so they decided to take it, and shut off such parts as they didn't need. But no rooms were shut off, and they revelled in a great library beside their living-room and drawing-room. They had a cosy breakfast room beside the big dining-room and there were a music room and a billiard room and a den and great hall with a spreading staircase; and the second story was a maze of bedrooms, guest rooms and bathrooms.It took Patty some days even to learn her way round, and she loved every room, hall and passage. There were fascinating windows, great wide and deep ones, and little oriels and dormers. There were unexpected turns and nooks, and there was,--which brought joy to Patty's heart,--plenty of closet space.The whole place was of noble proportions and magnificent size, but Patty's home-making talents brought cosiness to the rooms they themselves used and stateliness and beauty to the more formal apartments.""We must look ahead,"" she told Billee, ""for I expect to spend my whole life here. I don't want to fix a place up just as I like it, and then scoot off and leave it and live somewhere else. And when our daughter begins to have beaux and entertain house parties, we'll need all the room there is.""Patty was a wise and careful buyer. Only worth-while things were selected, not a miscellaneous collection of trumpery junk. So the result to date was charming furniture and appointments, but space for more when desired.Little Billee's taste, too, was excellent, and he and Patty nearly always agreed on their choice. But it was a rule that if either disapproved, the thing in question was not bought. Only such as both sanctioned could come into their home.The house had a wide and hospitable Colonial doorway, with broad fanlight above and columns at either side. Seats, too, flanked the porch, and the carefully trimmed wistaria vine hung gracefully over all. Across both ends of the house ran wide verandahs, with _porte coch√®re_, sun parlour, conservatory and tea-porch breaking the monotony.Patty's own bedroom was an exquisite nest, done up in blue and silver, and her boudoir, opening from it, was a dream of pink and white. Then came the baby's quarters; the day nursery, gay with pictured walls and the sun porch, bright and airy."
"Fleurette was her name, only selected after long thought and much discussion. Bill had stood out for Patricia Fairfield Farnsworth, but Patty declared no child of hers should be saddled with such a burden for life! Then Bill declared it must be a diminutive, in some way, of the mother's name, and as he always called Patty his Blossom Girl, the only suggestion worth considering was something that meant Little Flower. And as their stay in France had made the French language seem less foreign than of yore, they finally chose Fleurette,--the Baby Blossom.Farnsworth was a man of affairs, and had sometimes to go to Washington or other distant cities on business, but not often or for a long stay. And as Patty expressed it, that was a lot better than for him to have to go to New York every day,--as so many men of their acquaintance did.He pulled an old envelope and a pencil from his pockets, and rapidly drew the location with a few hasty strokes, and added a suggestion of an Oriental looking building that was meant for the proposed tea-house.They strolled around through the well-kept vegetable gardens and chicken yards, and came to the garage. Here were the big cars and Patty's own little runabout. Larry, the chauffeur, touched his cap with a respectful smile at Patty, and as Farnsworth talked to the man, Patty stood looking off across the grounds and wondering if any one in the whole world loved a home as she did.""And far across the hills they went To that new world which is the old. And far across the dying day, Beyond its utmost purple rim: Beyond the night, across the day The happy Princess followed him.""""Lose your grandmother! Why, in the right hands, all those faddy things melt into one big bundle of hominess, and you feel as if you'd always had 'em. Soon you'll declare you've never lived without a Japanese tea-garden in your back yard!"" ""I refuse to go a step further! This porch of wistaria is the most wonderful thing I ever saw in all my life! When I heard the name of the place, I thought it was crazy,--but of course I see now it's the only possible name! I don't care what's inside the house,--here I am,--and here I stay!""Then they all strolled through the wide hall and out at the back door on to the tea-porch. This was furnished with white wicker tables and chairs, and indeed, was prepared for immediate use, for a maid was just bringing the cakes and crumpets as the party arrived.""It's just as pretty as the other porch,"" Elise decided, looking critically at the festoons of wistaria, which was on three sides of the house. ""But I'll adopt the first one. Anybody looking for me will find me there--'most always.""""Nonsense!"" and Mona smiled at her husband. ""Don't you believe him, Patty. We go fifty-fifty on everything,--as to decisions, I mean. He gives in to my superior judgment half the time, and I let him have his own foolish way the other half. Follow my plan and you'll live happily, my dear."""
"""Yes,--except Father and Nan,--and a few calls from the neighbours. This is my first house-party. And I do want it to be a success, so I'm going to depend on you all to help me. If I do what I ought not to do,--or leave undone the things which I should ought to do,--check me up,--won't you, please?""In truth, Patty was a born hostess, and without fuss or ostentation always had the comfort of her guests in mind. While not overburdened with a retinue of servants, she had enough to attend to everything she required of them; and her own knowledge and efficiency combined with her tact and real kindliness brought about a state of harmony in her household that might well have been envied by an older and more experienced matron.Mrs. Chase, who had the nominal position of housekeeper, found herself strictly accountable to Patty for all she did, and as she was sensible enough to appreciate Patty's attitude, she successfully fulfilled the requirements of a butler or steward, and had general charge and oversight of all the housekeeping details.""The way to keep house,"" said Patty to Mona and Elise, as she took them away with her, leaving the men to their ""smokes,"" ""is not so much to work yourself as to be able to make others work in the way you want them to.""""That's just it,"" agreed Mona, ""and that's just what I can't do! Why, my servants rode over me so, and were so impudent and lazy, I just gave up housekeeping and went to a hotel to live. We had to,--there was no other way out.""""What a heavenly kiddy!"" Elise exclaimed, ""Oh, Patty, what a daffodil head! Just a blur of yellow fuzz! And such blue eyes! She looks exactly like you! And exactly like Bill, too. Oh, I never saw such a darling baby. Let me take her,--mayn't I?""""My linen closet is a room,"" and Patty led them thither. ""You see, we have such a lot of rooms and,--such a lot of linen,--that I took this little bedroom for a linen press. I had a carpenter put in the shelves and cupboards just as I wanted them,--and here's the result.""""Oh, I've done quite some shopping to get our Lares and Penates together, and Bill let me get whatever I wanted in the house furnishing line. Yes, this linen room is my joy and my pride. See, _this_ cupboard is all curtains. I do love to have fresh curtains as often as I want them.""""Oh, well, you're just as happy,"" laughed Patty. ""I chance to be naturally tidy, and I just love to potter over my things, and keep them in place. Some time I'll show you Baby's wardrobe. Her little things are too dear for anything. But now I'll take you to your rooms. This is yours, Elise. I picked out this one for you, because it's lavender,--and I know that's your favorite colour."""
"It _was_ a beautiful room. A deep seated bay-window, with latticed panes, opened into a profusion of wistaria blooms, and the fragrance filled the whole place. The furniture was of ivory enamel and the appointments were of various harmonious shades of lavender. A _chaise-longue_ was well supplied with lace pillows and a nearby stand and reading-lamp hinted at the comfortable enjoyment of a tempting array of new books.""Of course I did,--with Mrs. Chase to help me. She's a treasure,--she catches on to my ways so quickly. Glad you like it, Elise, honey. Now settle yourself here,--your bags will be up in a minute,--and I'll put Mona in her niche.""""It was here when we bought the house. You see, some rooms were already furnished, when the man decided to sell it. And of these, such as we liked we kept as they were. This is especially fine chintz and also good workmanship, so as it is so imposing in effect, we call it the Royal Suite. Father and Nan adored it, and you and Roger are the next Royal guests.""The chintz was patterned with tropical birds and foliage and as the hangings were many and elaborate the effect _was_ gorgeous. The bathroom was spacious and fully equipped, and as Mona's things had arrived she turned to instruct the maid who was already unpacking them.""Just for a minute, then, for I must go and sort out the rest of my visitors. I am putting Philip and Chick over in the west wing, far removed from the nursery, for I don't want them imagining they are kept awake by the night thoughts of my child. And, I must confess, Fleurette has a way of tuning up in the wee, small hours! However, we had the nursery walls muffled, so I don't think you'll be disturbed. Isn't this outlook fine, Elise?""""And here's your bath,"" Patty opened the door to a bathroom of white-tiled and silver daintiness. ""Now you've time for a tub and a rest before dinner. So I'm going to leave you. Come down at eight,--or sooner, if you like.""""I'm not quite sure, myself. I'm going to get a field-book,--or First Lessons in Godfathering, or something like that. But, anyway, I'm hers! Oh, Patty, she's going to grow up a beauty! Did you ever see such eyes!"" Seated at the head of her own dinner table that evening, Patty felt decidedly in her element. Always of a hospitable nature, always efficient in household matters, she played her r√¥le of hostess with a sweet simplicity and a winning grace that charmed all her guests."
"Farnsworth, opposite her at the big, round table, was a quiet, dignified and well-mannered host. He had not Patty's native ability to entertain, but he was honestly anxious that his guests should be pleased and he did all in his power to help along. Patty had coached him on many minor points, for Little Billee had been brought up in simple surroundings and unaccustomed to what he at first called Patty's frills and fal-lals.But she had convinced him that dainty laces and shining silver were to be used for his daily fare and not merely as ""company fixings,"" and being adaptable, the good-natured man obediently fell in with her wishes.It was her great regret that Bill had no parents, nor indeed any near relatives. An only child, and early orphaned, he had lived a few years with a cousin and then had shifted for himself. A self-made man,--as they are styled,--he had developed fine business ability, and had also managed to acquire a familiarity with the best in literature. Patty was continually astonished by his ready references and his quotations from the works of the best authors.For the purpose he selected the largest room in the house. It had been designed as a drawing-room or ballroom; but Farnsworth said that its location and outlook made it an ideal library. He had an enormous window cut, that filled almost the whole of one side of the room, and which looked out upon a beautiful view, especially at sunset.Then the furnishings were chosen for comfort and ease as well as preserving the dignified effect that should belong to a library. The book cases were filled with the books already owned by the two and new ones were chosen and bought by degrees as they were desired or needed.There were reading chairs, arranged near windows and with handy tables; there were desks, perfectly appointed; racks of new books and magazines; portfolios of pictures, and cosy window seats and _t√™te-√†-t√™tes_.There were a few fine pictures, and many little intimate sketches by worth-while pencils or brushes. And there were treasured books, valuable intrinsically or because of their inscriptions, that Farnsworth had collected here and there.The speaker was Beatrice Gale, a neighbour of the Farnsworths. She was pretty and saucy looking,--a graceful sprite, with a dimpled chin, and soft brown hair, worn in moppy bunches over her ears. She was called Betty by her friends, and Patty and Bill had already acquired that privilege.Of a truth Elise was a little disturbed. For she was of a jealous and self-seeking disposition, and resented any attentions that were not given to her. The advent of this bright and sparkling young girl,--probably three or four years younger than herself, made her suddenly feel neglected, and it displeased her.Mona noticed it, and smiled to herself. But Patty truly regretted it, for she had taken a decided fancy to Beatrice Gale, and as they were neighbours, she knew the girl would be often at Wistaria Porch. And as she had planned to have Elise with her often, also, she saw breakers ahead, unless the two could be reconciled.Patty had hoped,--and thought,--that Philip would marry her cousin, Helen Barlow; but neither of the parties had seen it in that light, and Helen had since married her long persistent wooer, Chester Wilde.""No, thank you, I love the fresh air,"" and Elise waved her white arm upward, and entwined it in the wistaria blossoms. ""I've adopted this porch,--I shall probably be with Patty a lot this summer. You'll come up--now and then?""""Thank you, ma'am. But I won't be in it, when the brother appears on the scene, I fear! So, to make hay while the sun shines, won't you go in and dance with me? I hear the light fantastics tripping in the hall."""
"Phil's reply was lost as they danced away, but Elise realised that it was an eager expression of his desire that they should meet again, and soon, and her demon of jealousy once more up-reared his ugly head.Wistaria Porch was fairly basking in the sunshine, and the flower gardens were already showing their early blooms. The tulip beds were a blaze of bright glory and hyacinths and daffodils added their sweetness and beauty.""Such a heavenly place!"" Patty exclaimed as she and Little Billee strolled along the garden paths in the late afternoon. ""I'm glad we have this week-end to ourselves,--I love to have guests, but once in a while,--you know--""""All right, let's try again. Who's the airiest, fairiest, tiny mite? Who's the pinky-goldiest Smiley-eyes in the whole world? Here she is!"" and big Bill took the baby, from nurse's arms, and flung her high in the air, catching her deftly on her descent, while Patty held her breath in apprehension. She knew perfectly well Bill wouldn't let the child fall,--and yet, accidents had occurred,--and the crowing baby might squirm out of the watchful father's arms.""Now, it's my turn,--give her to me,"" said Patty, at last. Then Bill deposited the child in her mother's arms, and the little one nestled there contentedly. She was a good baby, and rarely cried or fretted. Healthy and strong, she bade fair to become a fine big woman some day, and Patty's leaping mind had already planned out her whole lifetime!""Oh, Lord, no! She was not really my aunt, at all. She was a cousin of my father's and when she took me in, I called her auntie. But they only took me because they wanted my help on the place, and I worked hard for them four years. They gave me no affection, nor even thanks for my services, and as I couldn't learn anything or make any sort of progress in that God-forsaken valley, I left them and shifted for myself.""""Not much to tell. It consisted of a store and post-office,--a church and school,--and forty or fifty small houses. Uncle Thorpe's place was a mile out from the Corners, proper, and I used to trudge back and forth every day for the mail, and for provisions. And part of the time I went to school. The teacher was a nice young girl, but we boys led her a dance! How we _did_ plague her!"" and Bill laughed at the recollection.""The only one I know anything about. Mother's people were English,--none of them over here. No near relatives, anyhow, for she was an only child. Dad was, too, for that matter. Little Zaly,--that's what they called her, is about the last leaf on the tree."""
"""You are,--my lord and master,--you sure are! But, all the same, I must hunt up your little cousin. Of course her father can't come, if he isn't invited. And I'd like to know the child. I might do something for her,--be of some real help to her, I mean. Maybe she's longing to get East and have the advantages I could give her.""Patty tore up two or three letters before she finally composed one that suited her. It was not easy to know what attitude to take toward such a complete stranger, and with no knowledge of what sort of a girl she was writing to. But she at last sent off this:I am the wife of your cousin, William Farnsworth. Though you do not remember him, your father will tell you about him. At any rate, as you are of his kin, I want you to come and make us a visit--that is, if you care to. We have a lovely home, not far from New York City, and I would do my best to make you happy and give you a good time. You may not want to come,--indeed, you may have moved away from your native town, and may never even get this letter. But if you do get it, write me, at any rate, and tell me what you think about a trip East. We both send love and hope to hear from you soon.""You see,"" Patty explained to Bill, as she read the letter to him, ""it may be she can't afford such a trip. But I didn't like to hint at that, so I asked her to write me what she thinks about it. If she thinks she can't spend so much money, then we can offer to get her ticket.""I was so surprised and pleased to get your letter I hardly knew what to do. It seemed as if the dream of my life had at last come true. I've always wanted to go East,--to see New York,--oh, I'm so excited I can hardly write! And dear Cousin William! How kind of him to tell you about me,--for I was a very small baby when he was here. My father has told me all about it. When shall I start? I accept your invitation with joy. I have saved up my money and I have enough, I think, for the ticket. How much does it cost? But I can find out somehow. Father sends his respects and he says I may go. I am all ready. Can't you telegraph me, so I can go soon?"
"""Just what I thought, exactly! But I don't know as we can blame her if she did. The poor child is doubtless unversed in polite correspondence, and she did her best,--but she felt she needed a little more elegance of construction and so forth, and she picked out some dressy phrases from the book.""""Of course; but I'll be ready for her. I'll give her the yellow room. It's big and sunny and has a lovely bath and dressing-room. It's all in order, too, I'll just make some soft lacy pillows and give it some little personal touches and it will be all ready for her. Oh, Billee,--think what a lot we can do for her!""""Now, now, old calamity howler,--I don't want her to be a saint! I hope and expect she'll be a sweet, docile nature, and her lack of culture, if any, I shall try to remedy. Her lack of familiarity with social customs and all that, I _know_ I can remedy. Oh, I expect a busy time with her,--and I know I shall have to be tactful and kind,--but don't you think I can be?""This yellow room, however, was so well adapted for a young girl. There was a long French window that opened on the dearest little balcony, where the wistaria clambered and made a delightful shade. There was an alcove, where stood a Chippendale writing desk, and a revolving book rack. There was a sewing corner, with a fully furnished work-stand; and there was a soft puffy couch, with a pile of down pillows and a fluffy yellow afghan. And yet there was ample room for the bed, with its dimity draperies, and the fascinating toilet table, with its bewildering array of ivory fittings.Uncertain of her guest's tastes, Patty put out few books, only a story or two of general interest and a couple of new magazines. All such matters could be attended to after she had sized up the newcomer.Naturally, she chose azaleas, and some of a lovely soft tint of buff harmonised with pale pink ones. White ones too, with a bit of green foliage, until the room was a bower of beauty. Not overdone, though. Patty never made the mistake of too many flowers,--fond as she was of them.A last affectionate survey of the room convinced her that all was exactly as it should be, and with a happy little sigh of contentment she went down to the porch to await the arrival of the guest, for Farnsworth had gone to the station to meet her, and they were due now at any minute.Up the steps toward her flew a figure which, as Patty afterward described it, seemed like a wild Indian! A slight, wiry figure, rather tall and very awkward, and possessed of a nervous force that expressed itself in muscular activity.""Oh, how do you do?"" the girl cried, explosively. ""You're Cousin Patty,--aren't you?"" But even as she spoke, she stumbled on the steps, pitched forward, falling on Patty, and but for Farnsworth's quick action would have knocked her down."
"She had flashing black eyes, which darted from one object to another in a jerky, inquisitive way. Her scarlet lips parted over white, even teeth, but her lower lip hung, and her half-open mouth gave her an air of ignorance, often accompanied by rude staring.The dress in question was a ""sport suit"" of a large-sized green and black check. It was cheap material, and badly cut, and its ill-fitting coat hung on Azalea's slim shoulders in baggy wrinkles. Her blouse was bright pink Georgette, beaded with scarlet beads, and altogether, perhaps her costume could not have been worse chosen or made up,--at least, from Patty's point of view.She stretched out luxuriously in the long chair, throwing her arms above her head, and crossing her feet, which were dressed with ""gun metal"" stockings and shoes. Her hat was pushed awry, and wisps of hair fell at either side of her face.Off came the hat, and was pitched on the floor. Azalea ran her fingers through her hair, making it a little more disordered than before. It was pretty hair,--or, rather would have been, if it were better cared for. Dark, almost black, with a slight inclination to curl, it was bunched into a tousled knot that was far from picturesque.""Oh, come,"" said Patty, jumping up, for she couldn't stand the girl's uncouth actions another minute. ""Come along with me, Azalea. You must dress for dinner soon,--and some one might come to call now. We'll have tea in your room, if you like.""Farnsworth was silent. The man was really aghast. What had he brought on poor little Patty! He didn't excuse himself with the thought that it was Patty's doing, not his, that Azalea was there at all, but he felt personally to blame for having such a relative and for having her there in their home. He looked helplessly at Patty, with such despair in his kind eyes, that she ran over and kissed him, in spite of the fact that they were not alone.Azalea giggled. ""That's right,"" she said, affably; ""don't mind me! Just go right on spoonin' even when I'm around. I don't mind. And I don't wonder you took to her, Cousin William. She's a peach, for fair,--ain't she?""On her feet, the girl shook herself with a careless abandon of manner, unheeding the fact that a hairpin flew from her loosened hair, and she dropped the handkerchief, gloves and small bag that she had had in her lap.Should she try _now_ to reform the girl,--improve her manners, or at least her general attitude,--or, should she leave her to her own ways for a time, and trust to her observation of other people to show her her own faults?It was almost impossible not to correct some of Azalea's ignorant mistakes, but still more difficult to ignore her over readiness to adapt herself to what she thought was the proper behaviour toward servants.""Be a little careful with Janet,"" she said, pleasantly. ""She's a bit peculiar as to disposition. A splendid maid, and a most capable girl,--but she doesn't like to be ordered about too definitely. You see, she knows her duties so well, and is so efficient, that it's really unnecessary to give her directions."""
"""Please, Azalea,"" and Patty smiled ingratiatingly, ""remember, won't you, that this is my house and these are my servants. I have my own ways of treating them, and I'm going to ask you to work with me,--not against me.""""I daresay,"" laughed Patty, determined not to show her annoyance. ""But it's time to dress for dinner,--or nearly. Come back to your room,--and--wouldn't you like to take a fifteen minute nap? It might refresh you.""""It would _not_! Take a nap in broad daylight! I never heard of such a thing! Oh, well, if I can't speak to that kid let's go back to my room. I'll skittle into my frock and go down to that flowery, bowery piazza again. I like that.""""That will do nicely,"" Patty said, relieved that it was at least white, and not some of the flamboyant effects she saw still in the trunk. ""Janet will press it off for you,--it's rumpled from packing. And then you needn't unpack, dear, Janet will do that for you.""They _were_ a contrast! Patty, dainty, graceful and sweet, was the very antithesis of tall, gawky Azalea, with her countrified dress and badly made black shoes. Her careless air, too, was unattractive,--for it was not the nonchalance of experience, but the unselfconsciousness of sheer ignorance of urban ways and manners.""I believe you would,"" said Bill, smiling at her; ""Patty is a flower-worshipper, Zaly. Zaly's the name your mother called you when you were a tiny mite. Tell me about your father? Was he willing to be left alone?""But Patty's happy face, as she turned it toward her husband, left little doubt as to her state of satisfaction with her life. Though, as she said, she was always busy, it was by her own wish, and she would have been miserable if she had had nothing to do.However, they were not prepared for Azalea's attitude, which was that of self-important bravado. Quite conscious of her shortcomings, the girl's nature was such that she preferred to pretend familiarity with her strange surroundings and she assumed an air of what she considered elegance that was so funny that the others had difficulty to keep from laughing outright.She was especially at great pains to extend her little finger when she raised a glass or cup, having evidently observed the practice among people she admired. This finally resulted in her dropping the glass and spilling water all over her dinner plate.And sure enough, the deft waitress whisked the details of the accident out of sight, spread a large fresh napkin at Azalea's place, set another plate for her, and was passing her the platter of chicken almost before she realised what was going on.""It's great! I never tasted anything like it!"" Whereupon, Azalea took in her fingers a wing and, with both elbows on the table, proceeded to enjoy it in her own informal way. But both little fingers were carefully extended at right angles to the others. She glanced at them now and then, to make sure."
"Her equanimity restored by Patty's kindliness and tact, the girl lapsed into what was, doubtless, her customary way of eating. She displayed undue gusto, smacked her lips at the appearance of a dainty dish and when the dessert proved to be ice cream, she rolled her eyes ceilingward, and patted her chest in a very ecstasy of anticipation.""Restrained? Oh, you mean I eat too much! Well, I have got a big appetite, but to-night I guess I'm specially hungry. Or else your eats are specially good! You don't mind how much I eat, do you, Cousin Patty?""""Of course she doesn't,"" Farnsworth went on, trying to look severe but obliged to smile at Azalea's total unconsciousness of any wrong manners on her part. ""But she does care if you behave like a 'wild and woolly,' although she's too polite to say so!""But the description of Azalea's singing voice was interrupted by the entrance of two young people. Betty Gale and her brother Raymond stepped in at the open French window, and laughingly announced themselves as daring intruders.""You're the real purpose of our visit,"" said Betty, her charming little face alight with gay welcome. ""We adore our neighbours, and they simply worship us,--so we're quite prepared to take any friends or relatives of either of them into our hearts and homes.""Betty Gale's eyes opened wide for a fraction of a second, then she as quickly accepted the situation, and said, cordially, ""I'm sure we shall be friends. And you must like my scapegrace brother, too, if only for my sake.""""My!"" said Azalea again. Her bravado deserted her in the presence of these two merry visitors. They seemed so at ease, so knowing, so carelessly polite, that Azalea felt as if they were beings from some other sphere. The Farnsworths, she knew, made allowance for her because she was a guest in their household, but these people seemed to expect her to be like themselves, and she suddenly realised she couldn't be as they were.A strange contradictory streak in her nature often made her assume an accomplishment she did not possess, and now, knowing she couldn't chat in their lively fashion, she took refuge in an attitude of bold hilarity, and talked loud and fast.""Yes, I shall, too. I'm your nearest neighbour, and it's my right. I suppose you'll give her a luncheon or something, first, and then I'll follow it with a tea, or a dance, or whatever you like. There'll be lots of things for her later on, so I want to get my bid in first. How pretty she is.""""You're a darling, Betty,"" cried Patty, enthusiastically, touched by her friend's kindness, ""but,--well, there's no use mincing matters,--I'm not sure Azalea is quite ready to be presented to society.""""Indeed she isn't!"" put in Farnsworth, ""I want you to understand that she's _my_ cousin,--not Patty's. And, also my wife's quite right,--Azalea is not ready for social functions,--of any sort. You see, Betty, we can't blink the facts,--she's of the West, western,--in the least attractive sense. I'm fond of my home, and unashamed of my people, but all the same, I'm not going to have Patty embarrassed by the ignorance and awkwardness of an untutored guest. And so here's where I set my foot down. We accept no invitations for Azalea until we think she is in trim to make a correct appearance in society."""
"""Why should you be surprised at me? You invited me to come and see you. If I'm not good enough to visit you, I'll go home again. You didn't ask me any questions,--you just said come along,--and I came. I ain't a swell,--like these friends of yours,--but I am your cousin, and you've got no right to scorn me!""""That's so, Bill,"" Patty said, seriously; ""and here's another thing. Betty has met Azalea now,--she knows just what she is. If she still cares to ask her to her house, I shall approve of her going. I want to do all I can for our cousin, and there's no better way to teach people to swim, than to throw them into the water!""""It seems hard on you, Azalea,"" he went on, ""to talk of you like this,--as if you were not present,--but it is so. You need,--I'm not going to hesitate to tell you,--you need a thorough training in matters pertaining to polite society. Unless you are willing to accept our teachings and do your best to profit by them,--I am going to send you back home! For much as I want to be kind and helpful to my young cousin,--I will not even try, if it makes my wife any trouble or embarrassment.""Farnsworth sighed. He had had, as yet, no chance to talk to Patty alone, since their misfit visitor had arrived. He had been firmly resolved to send her home again,--until now, that Patty and Betty seemed willing to take her in hand. If they were, it would be a great injustice to the Western girl not to give her the chance to learn refinement and culture from those two who were so well fitted to teach her.And, anyway,--he continued to muse,--perhaps Azalea's worst faults were superficial. If she could be persuaded to amend her style of talk and her _gauche_ manners, perhaps she was of a true fine nature underneath. His Uncle,--so-called,--and his Aunt Amanda, he remembered as kindly, good-hearted people, of fair education, though lacking in elegance.""Oh, don't take it so seriously,"" cried the vivacious Betty, as she noted Farnsworth's thoughtful face: ""leave the little girl to us for a few weeks,--and you will be surprised at the result! You'll do just as I tell you,--won't you, Azalea?""""I wish you would speak to her,"" Patty sighed. ""Azalea is really a trial. I don't know what to do with her. Sometimes she is so sweet and docile that I think I'm teaching her to be a civilised person, and then she flies off at a tangent and she's as unruly and intractable as she was at first.""""Well, he used to be! It was his special forte. I've had letters from him a dozen pages long. I don't believe he's outgrown his bent of letter writing. Now, listen, to this, Azalea, the next letter you get from him, I want you to show it to me, see? If there's anything in it you don't want me to know about, cut that out,--but show me at least the beginning and the ending,--and a part of a page. You hear me?"""
"""At risk of that awful condition of things, I won't tell you just yet. But you do this. Here's something you can do toward solving the mystery,--and I can't. Find out for sure,--don't ask her, but see for yourself,--if Azalea gets a letter from Horner's Corners addressed in a big, bold Spencerian hand. I remember Uncle Thorpe's handwriting perfectly, and it's unmistakable. I've not seen it since Azalea came.""""No,"" decreed Patty; ""let her alone. It's probably those people she picked up on the train coming here. She has spoken of them to me. Don't let's go out, or we may have to invite them to stay to dinner,--and judging from this long distance view of them, I don't care specially to do so.""Leaving Azalea to entertain her friends without interruption they went out on a porch on the other side of the house. And soon Raymond Gale sauntered over from his home next door and joined them there.At dinner time Azalea appeared. She wore the same frock she had worn all day, and Patty looked at her in amazement. Apparently she had been working hard at something. Her hair was rumpled, her collar awry, and her whole appearance untidy and unpresentable.""If she doesn't, it will be your own fault,"" and Patty took advantage of the opportunity for a word of warning. ""Elise is a person of strong likes and dislikes. If you try to be real nice and courteous she will certainly like you, and if you're rude and blunt, I don't believe she will. Do you care, Azalea, whether she does or not?""Farnsworth, too, shook his head, and glanced at Patty with a sympathetic smile, and then they talked together to the entire exclusion of Azalea, who was so wrapped in her own thoughts that she didn't even notice them.""Here I am!"" she cried, as she stepped from the motor, and flew into Patty's embrace. ""Where's your eccentric cousin I've heard about? But first, where's my godchild? I've brought her the loveliest presents! Let me at her!""""Don't--don't, Elise,"" begged Patty, her voice shaking; ""I don't believe she's kidnapped at all. It's far more likely Azalea took her out for a ride or something. She's crazy over the baby and she always wants to have her to herself, but, she says, Winnie won't let her."""
"Elise voiced her new theory with a fresh burst of grief, and the idea struck a chill to Patty's heart. She took no stock in the kidnapping theory, for Winnie had left the child with Azalea, who would have fought off a horde of marauders before she let them carry off the little one. No, whatever had happened was doubtless Azalea's doing. But Elise's notion of an accident to Fleurette might come somewhere near the truth.""Sometimes,"" vouchsafed Winnie, ""Miss Azalea would toss the baby into the bassinette, instead of laying her down. She always pitched her straight in,--and baby liked it! You see, Miss Thorpe was very gentle with the child, and never missed her aim. But I was fair frightened to watch her.""""Miss Thorpe told me you wanted her to do it, ma'am. She said it was good exercise for the child, and,--you know her father does it,--and,--begging your pardon,--Miss Thorpe is even more skilful than Mr. Farnsworth.""""I'm going to telephone Bill,"" she said, as if thinking aloud,--""but first, I'm going to call up the Gales, and see if Zaly could have taken Fleurette over there. You know Azalea is utterly lawless,--it's impossible to imagine what she will do. Oh, Elise, you've no idea what we go through with that girl! She is a terror! And yet,--well, there is something about her I can't help liking. For one thing, she's so fond of Fleurette. If she has hurt her,--well, Azalea would just about kill herself!""A telephone call to the Gales' produced no information as to the whereabouts of Azalea or the baby. Betty replied that she hadn't seen any one from Wistaria Porch that day, and was thinking of coming over to call.""Well, I think I'll have to call up Bill,"" she said, at last. ""You see, he's fearfully busy today, with a specially important matter, and he probably won't be in his own office, anyway. And I hate to intrude on a directors' meeting,--that is, if there's no necessity. And yet,--it seems as if I must!""So Patty called Farnsworth's office. Bill's business consisted of varied interests. He was a consulting engineer, he was a mining expert, and he was still connected with government work. So, frequently, he could not be found in his office, though he usually left word where Patty could get in touch with him.""Well, Elise,"" she said, forlornly, ""you might as well go to your room, and get your hat off. Come on, I'll go with you,--and I may think of something else to do about Baby. For the present I seem to be at my wits' end."""
"It was all too certain that Azalea had taken her away somewhere. And it might be all right,--it might be that Azalea had merely taken the child out for a walk. She had been known to do this,--but never before without Patty's sanction. Of late, though, Patty had objected to it because she feared that Azalea might not return quickly enough. Twice she had been gone for two or three hours, and though the baby seemed all right, Patty didn't approve of the performance.""That's it,"" she summed up, after telling Elise of this; ""you see, I haven't approved of such long absences and so Zaly just walked off. Of course, she sent Winnie down for the food, in order to get a chance to put on Baby's things, and depart unseen.""""He didn't. He fairly begged me not to invite her here. But I insisted on it. You see, we neither of us had any idea of what she was like. Bill hadn't seen her since she was a baby, and she was different then!""""Oh, I can't. And, to tell you the truth, Elise, I want to help the girl. She's ignorant and inexperienced, but she has a sort of native quickness and wit, and I feel sure if I could teach her for a while, she could learn to be one of us,--and in time become a fine woman.""""Yes, probably,"" said Patty, despairingly. ""Oh, Elise, this suspense is driving me crazy! If I knew that Zaly had her,--and if I knew nothing had happened, I'd feel _so_ relieved. But suppose she did break Fleurette's little arm or leg--""""Yes, it can! I hope it isn't, but do let this be a lesson to you, Patty! Don't ever allow that girl to see the baby again,--much less touch her! I think you and Bill must have taken leave of your senses to give her such freedom! Why, you don't deserve to have that heavenly baby!""""That may be,--and of course, she wouldn't harm the child wilfully. But, as I said, accidents will happen,--and if it's Bill's fault, why,--of course, it's his own child,--and that's different. But Azalea has no business to take chances with other people's children.""""Well, Patty-_maman_,"" he said, as he kissed her, ""how's things today? I had to go over to Philadelphia, on a flying trip,--wish I could have flown, literally,--and hadn't even time to let you know. Then, Rollins told me you had called up several times,--so I skittled home to see what it's all about."""
"""H'm, h'm,--looks bad. But don't worry, little mother, I'm sure nothing has happened to our Little Flower,--I mean nothing of an accidental nature. Azalea is exceedingly fond of the baby, and I can easily imagine her wanting to take her for a ride this beautiful afternoon. It's perfectly wonderful out! There's a soft breeze and the air is delightful--""""No-sir-ee! Zaly is a terror, and a trial in lots of ways, but if she had let that child fall, she would have called Patty and Winnie and the whole household for help, and would have run for the doctor herself! She never would have run away! Not Azalea! She's no coward,--whatever other unpleasant traits she may possess.""""That's so,"" agreed Patty; ""and she truly loves the baby. No, Elise, nothing like that happened,--I'm sure. I see it as Bill does, now. It _is_ a heavenly day,--and Zaly felt pretty sure I wouldn't let her take Baby out by herself, without the nurse,--and she does love to do that,--and so she sneaked off, and made up that yarn about the food in order to get Fleurette's hat and coat on! Oh, she's a manoeuvrer!""""Well, I'm glad you both feel that way about it,"" said Elise; ""of course you know the girl better than I do,--as I've never even seen her! but if she's such a strong-arm, I think I'm rather afraid of her!""""Oh, I imagine you can hold your own against her!"" laughed Patty, happy now, since Bill's reassurance of her darling's safety. ""All the same, I wish Zaly would come home! It's after six! Come on, Elise, let's dress for dinner, and then that will be done.""They went to their rooms, and soon Patty was all dressed and had returned to her post of vantage on the wistaria porch, to look for the return of the lost ones. And at last, through the gathering dusk, she saw a baby carriage being propelled along the roadway.The child was asleep, but Patty lifted her from the pillows and gazed into the little face. Apparently there was nothing wrong, but the golden head cuddled down on Patty's shoulder and the baby slept on.Patty looked, but it seemed to her that the blue eyes drooped from natural weariness, and assuring herself that no bones were broken or out of place, she drew a long sigh of relief and told Winnie to put Fleurette to bed as usual.Patty returned to the porch where Farnsworth was still talking to Azalea. Apparently he had scolded her sharply, for she was crying, and that with Azalea Thorpe was a most unusual performance. She usually resented reproof and talked back in no mild-mannered way. But now she was subdued and even frightened of demeanour, and Patty knew that Bill had done all that was necessary and further reproaches from her were not needed."
"I received your last letter and I am very glad you are having such a nice time. It must be very pleasant at the grand house where you are staying,--and I suppose you are getting grand too. I am very lonesome without you, but I am willing, for I want you to have a good time and get improvement and all that. Remember me kindly to Cousin William and his wife. I like to hear you tell about the baby. She must be a fine child. I am well, and I hope you are, too. With much affection, from your loving The Farnsworths made no difference in their treatment of Azalea, after her escapade. Bill had scolded her severely for taking the baby away without leave, and sternly forbidden her ever to do so again, and the girl had promised she would not.Patty had said nothing to her on the subject, feeling that she could best keep Azalea's friendliness by ignoring the matter, and she was trying very hard to teach the girl the amenities of social life.And Azalea was improving. She behaved much better at table and in the presence of guests. Patty rejoiced at the improvement and, as she took strict care that Azalea should have no opportunity to see Fleurette alone, she feared no repetition of those anxious hours when the baby was missing.Azalea was smiling and in an excited mood, but she looked tired,--almost exhausted, as well. She was flushed, and her hair was rumpled, and her breath came quickly, as if she had been through some violent exercise.""Now, look here! I won't stand for such talk about Patty! You stop it! She's not only your hostess but she's the best friend you ever had or ever will have! She's making you over,--and goodness knows you needed it!""""I don't deny that, Azalea,"" and Elise couldn't help laughing at the defiant air of the speaker. ""I'm not disputing your right to be here. But I do deny your right to say anything whatever against Patty, who is trying her best to do all she can for your pleasure and for your good.""""What! I did nothing of the sort! Why, Elise, I wouldn't do such a thing! I love that kiddy! I wouldn't give her a morsel to eat or drink. I know how careful Nurse and Patty are about that! You must be crazy to think I'd give Baby anything!"""
"""Just what it says! It's a big bazaar,--of course,--and we're going to call it Vanity Fair and sell only gay, dainty, dinky little contraptions, and have all sorts of pretty booths and fancy dances and flower stands, and--oh, everything that Vanity Fair suggests.""The Western girl stood silent. This was the sort of thing that was outside her ken. Though she had been at Wistaria Porch for some weeks now, and had become fairly conversant with the ways of Patty and her friends, this kind of a gay project was to her an unknown field.""You can help us lots, I'm sure, Zaly,"" she said, kindly, ""and you'll have a chance to learn about it all. There's heaps of fun in a Fair, especially when it's all novel to you. It's an old story to us, but _I_ always love anything of the sort. We'll have it here, you see, and it will be a lawn _f√™te_ and a house party and a general hullabaloo!""""Of course,"" Patty went on, partly to the others and partly as if merely thinking aloud for her own benefit, ""there will be all the regulation things,--lemonade well, fortune-telling, society circus and everything, but the idea is to have every one of them just a little bit different from what it has always been before, and have it in harmony with the idea of Vanity Fair.""A pause, and then, again, ""No, I simply can't! Don't ask me--yes, of course,--I know,--but, you see, they said,--oh, I can't tell you now,--I'll write,--well, yes, I'll do _that_!--Oh, of course, _I'll_ be there--but the--the other one--no, no, no!""These remarks were at long intervals and disconnected, but they were clearly heard by the three in the next room, and though no one mentioned it, each thought it a strange conversation for Azalea to take part in.Patty listened thoughtfully, feeling no hesitation in doing so, for she had only Azalea's good at heart and wanted to know anything that might help her understand the mystery that was certainly attached to the girl.""Rubbish! You _don't_ forget. Be sensible, Azalea. You're making a mystery of something. Now if it's anything wrong, I'm going to know about it,--if it's merely a little secret of your own,--a justifiable one,--tell me so, in a convincing way, and I'll stop questioning.""""Gracious, no! I never thought you were that!"" Patty laughed. ""But I do suspect you're up to some flirtation or affair of that sort, and I have a perfect right to inquire into the matter. Why didn't you let us meet your friends that day they called?""""Just what I say. I knew it, the moment I saw it, for the writing on my machine is so familiar to me, I can recognise it instantly. The tail of the y doesn't print, and there are lots of little details that make it recognisable.""""Oh, no; it is as greatly differentiated, almost, as penwriting,--some experts think more so. I mean, it can't be forged successfully, and penwriting can. Well, anyhow, that letter Azalea showed me, as being from her father, was written on my machine. She had no envelope, for of course she couldn't reproduce the proper postmark on an envelope she had herself addressed."""
"""I haven't got it all straightened out yet, myself,--but I shall. Another thing, Azalea is a poor speller, and she herself spells _very_ with two r's. She did in a dinner acceptance she wrote and referred to me for approval. So, when I saw that word misspelled twice in the letter we're talking of, I _knew_ she wrote it,--I mean, it corroborated my belief. Now, Patty, we've a peculiar case to deal with, and we must feel our way. This telephoning business is serious. Of course, Smith is _not_ those people's name! She told you a falsehood. We know she is capable of that! Now to find out what their name is. It isn't too late to call up Gale.""""Azalea, you have a very readable face. I know when you are telling me the truth and when you are not. Now, you are ready to grasp at anything I suggest rather than let me know the real facts of the case. So I am justified in thinking it's something pretty bad. What is it, child? Don't be afraid of me. Did you run away from home?""""Oh, no!"" Azalea looked frightened. Then she burst into tears. ""Wh-what makes you think I'm doing wrong?"" she sobbed; ""I'm not,--I'm oh,--I'm all right!"" Her air of bravado suddenly returned and she looked up defiantly, brushing her tears aside.Farnsworth could, as he said, read her face, and he was quite ready to meet her explanations when she was in a docile mood, but this quick return to her pose of injured innocence roused him to fresh indignation.""Hold on!"" cried Farnsworth, ""not so fast, Zaly. Before you leave me, listen to this. I am not at all satisfied with what you have told me,--or, rather, what you have refused to tell me,--and I am going to write to your father, and ask him why he doesn't write to you.""But he did not. He said, sternly, ""I can't understand you, Azalea. I don't want to misjudge you, but you must admit, yourself, that you're making it very hard for me. Why won't you tell me everything? If Uncle Thorpe disowned you,--cast you off,--or anything like that,--tell me; I'll take your part,--and I'll defend you."""
"""You're a very poor story-teller!"" he exclaimed. ""It is not Brown,--or Green,--or Smith. If you had said some less common name, I might have believed you. But your inventiveness doesn't go far enough. When people want to deceive, it's necessary to frame their falsehoods convincingly. If you had said Mersereau or Herncastle,--I might have swallowed it.""""Because I should have felt sure you didn't invent them. But when you want to conceal a name, and you say Smith or Brown, it doesn't go! Also, you _look_ as if you were fibbing. Why do you do it, Azalea? _Why_?""Farnsworth gave up in despair. ""Very well, Azalea,"" he concluded, ""I shall write to-day to Uncle Thorpe. I tell you this frankly, for _I_ do not do things on the sly. I'm sorry you take the attitude you do, but while I'm waiting to hear from your father, I shall continue to treat you as a guest and a trusted friend. That is all.""As she sat in the big, pleasant hall, she saw Farnsworth come in, go to the library and sit at his desk writing. Apparently this was one of the days when he did not go to New York. Patty came by--spoke cheerily to Azalea as she passed her, and then went on to speak to Bill.The two went out of doors together. Azalea jumped at the chance, and running into the library, glanced over the letters Farnsworth had written. As she had surmised, there was one addressed to Samuel Thorpe, Horner's Corners, Arizona.Then, sitting on her window-seat, she looked out over the beautiful lawns and gardens. She saw Bill and Patty walking about, pausing here and there. She knew they were selecting places for the booths and stands to be used at the forthcoming Fair.Elise was spending a month with Patty, and was going later to the mountains with her own family. They were all anxious, therefore, to get the Fair under way, and to hold it while Elise was still there.So things were being pushed, and the committees were hard at work. There were innumerable errands to the city, and nearly every day the big car went down and returned laden with materials for the work."
"""Yes, of the proper sort. Old Willow china and Sheffield plate. Copper lustre tea-sets and homespun bedspreads. And samplers! Oh, Azalea, I've three or four stunning samplers! One is dated 1812. That ought to bring a fine price.""""Would I? Indeed I would! But you ought to keep that, Azalea. My, what a generous girl you are! You'd give away your head, if it weren't fastened on! No, dear child, keep your grandmother's sampler yourself. Is it a good one?"" Vanity Fair was all that its name implied. By good fortune, the weather was perfect,--ideally pleasant and sunshiny, yet not too warm. Wistaria Porch was transformed into a veritable Fairyland, and it was a bewildering vision of flowers, flags and frivolity by day, and a blaze of illuminated gaiety by night.Azalea had the Indian booth. It was a wigwam, in effect, but it was so bedecked and ornamented that it is doubtful if a real Indian would have recognised it as one. However, it was filled with real Indian wares, and the beautiful baskets and pottery were sure to prove best sellers. Azalea received a large consignment from some place she had sent to in Arizona, and other people had donated appropriate gifts, until the little tent was overflowing.Azalea herself, the attendant on the booth, was in the garb of an Indian princess, a friend of Patty's having lent the costume for the occasion. It was becoming to the girl, and she looked really handsome in the picturesque trappings, and elaborate head-dress.Just before time for the Fair to be opened, Azalea went over to Elise's booth. As she had planned, Elise had a log cabin, and in it she had arranged a motley collection of antiques and heirlooms that were quaint and valuable. It was the design of the Fair to sell really worthwhile things at their full value; and as they expected many wealthy patrons, the committees felt pretty sure of a grand success.""Elise,"" said Azalea, as she appeared at the door of the cabin, ""here's my contribution to your department. I haven't had a chance to give it to you before."" She handed out a parcel, which Elise opened eagerly.It proved to be a sampler,--old, but in fine condition. It was an elaborate one, with many rows of letters, some lines of verse, and several little pictured shapes. There was a beautiful border, and the signature was _Isabel Cutler, 1636!_"
"""I see,"" said Elise, scrutinising the sampler. ""It's a marvel, Azalea. You mustn't sell it at this Fair. It ought to go to a museum. 1636! That's one of the earliest sampler dates! I can't see how it's lain unknown all these years. Who had it before you did?""""It isn't a question of prettiness, or even of a well worked piece. It's the date. And this is genuine,--I can see that. But I can't understand it! Why,--I think this border wasn't used until--I must look it up in my book. That's home in New York. But, there's one thing sure and certain! This doesn't get put in with my bunch of wares! Mr. Greatorex may come this afternoon. He's an expert on these things. He'll know just what it's worth.""""As I told you, Zaly, it's the age that counts,--not the beauty. Run along to your own booth. I'll lay this aside until I can find out about it. But if it's as valuable as I think it is, you mustn't give it to Vanity Fair,--or to anybody. 1636! My!""Azalea looked a little crestfallen. Instead of being glad at the unexpected value ascribed to her gift, she seemed decidedly put out about it. She strolled round by Patty's booth. That enterprising young matron had caused to be built for her use a little child's playhouse. It was just large enough for half a dozen children, and would perhaps hold nearly as many grown people. But it had a good-sized verandah and on this were tables piled with the loveliest fairy-like gossamer garments and comforts for tiny mites of humanity. Such exquisite blankets and afghans and tufted silk coverlets and such dainty frocks and caps and little coats and everything an infant could possibly use, from baskets to bibs and from pillows to porringers."
"Patty, happy as a butterfly, hovered over her treasures. She wore the immaculate white linen garb of a nurse, and very sweet and fair she looked. Later, Fleurette was to grace the booth and attract all observers by her marvellous baby charm.The scene was one of varied attractions. The place itself was lovely with its wealth of flower gardens and shrubbery and the unique and elaborate booths here and there among the trees made a striking picture.Betty was queen of the soda fountain. A really, truly soda fountain had been procured, and it was attended by white uniformed servitors who were trained to the work, but Betty was the presiding genius and invited her customers to sample her beverages, with free advice as to which flavours and combinations she thought the best.She went with Raymond and found a crowd waiting at the booth where the phonograph man was doing business. His plan was to make a record for any customer who cared to sing, recite or soliloquise for him. Mothers gladly brought their infant prodigies to ""speak pieces"" and went away proudly carrying the records that could be played in their homes for years to come. Aspiring young singers made records of their favourite songs. One young girl played the violin for a record.Taking their turn, Raymond and Azalea had what he called an impromptu scrap. A few words of instruction were enough for Azalea's dramatic instinct to grasp his meaning, and they had a lively tiff followed by a sentimental ""making-up"" that was good enough for a vaudeville performance, and which Azalea knew would greatly amuse Patty and Bill when they should hear the record.Instead, frightened by the strangeness of the scene and the noise and laughter of the people all about, Fleurette set up a wail of woe which developed rapidly into a storm of screams and sobs,--indeed, it was a first-class crying spell,--a thing which the good-natured child rarely indulged in.Azalea was a favourite among the young people. She looked a picture in her Indian dress and she was in rare good humour. She tried, too, to be gracious and gentle, and committed no _gaucheries_ and made no ignorant errors.Fleurette graced her mother's booth with her presence, later in the afternoon, and quite redeemed her reputation for good nature, by smiling impartially on everybody, and gurgling a welcome to all who looked at her.Archery was one of the pretty diversions, and at this Azalea excelled. To the surprise of all, she proved exceedingly skilful with the bow and arrow and easily won the prize offered. But she magnanimously refused to accept it, and returned it to be competed for over again.The cabin was not for sale, Elise laughingly informed him, as Mr. Farnsworth intended to keep it a permanent fixture on his own grounds. Also, Elise went on, very few things of value were left on her tables,--but she still had one piece on which she wished to ask his opinion.""Very easily. Here, you can see for yourself. You see how the figures are made,--ordinary cross stitch. Well, as you know, an eight is worked almost exactly the same as a six, except that it has two more stitches on the upper right-hand side. If those two stitches are picked out of an eight, it turns into a six! Now, I'm sure your young eyes can see that two stitches _have_ been picked out in this instance. See the slight mark where the canvas is the least bit drawn? And see, on the back a fresh stitch was necessary to keep the ends from ravelling. It would pass to a careless observer, but to one accustomed to these things the fraud is plainly evident."""
"""I should say very recently. The canvas is faded, of course, but, as you see, the threads beneath where the missing stitches were is quite a shade lighter. Had the picking been done years ago, the canvas would have assumed a uniform tinge,--or nearly so.""Mr. Greatorex smiled. ""Scarcely,"" he said. ""You see, my dear, the earliest known dated sampler is one of 1643 which is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, in England. There are but six or seven known in that century at all. It would be remarkable, therefore, to find a work of art that would antedate all collections, and yet show the patterns and style of work common less than a hundred years ago!""Azalea's own ignorance of the whole matter was so great, that it was not surprising that she thought the mere alteration of the date would make the sampler of greater value. But what broke Elise's heart was the knowledge of Azalea's wilful deception.""Now, Azalea, there's no use in your acting like that! You know perfectly well you can't fool _me_! If you really want to know what I mean, I'll tell you. I mean that you picked out two stitches from the eight to make it look like a six. Didn't you, now?""""It _wasn't_ only for a joke. You hoped you would make me think the sampler two hundred years older than it really is! And you thought that would make it much more valuable. Well, you overreached yourself! There were no samplers made--so far as is known--in 1636. So your trick wouldn't fool anybody!""For Elise had suddenly decided that she didn't want to spoil Patty's Fair by having a quarrel with her guest. So, though a good deal perturbed by the sampler incident, she preferred to drop the subject.""Nonsense! This is your first chance at a career. Don't muff it, now! Why, just your skill at archery is enough to put you over! It's the very place for you! Western doings, riding, shooting, lassoing, all sorts of bareback, daredevil stunts--""""I'm that by reason of your being a guest in my house, and too in view of the fact that you have, apparently, nobody to look after you. Your father has mysteriously disappeared. You've had no word from him since you've been here! So far as I know, you have no other relatives, and so, as your nearest of kin, I propose to look after you,--if you will let me. Don't be foolish, Azalea, dear,"" Farnsworth's voice took on a tender tone, ""_don't_ be antagonistic. I want to help you, not annoy you. Why not look on me as a friend, and let me know all you're about? There can be _no_ reason why I shouldn't."""
"Azalea's attention was attracted by the man who had lately left her. He stood behind Farnsworth and made gestures that informed Azalea she was not to let his presence be known. So she continued to talk to Bill, but also kept the other man in view.His procedure was somewhat strange. He pretended to be holding a baby, cuddling an imaginary child in his arms. Then he tossed the non-existent little one up in the air, and pretended to catch it again.Farnsworth looked at Azalea coldly. ""So you were holding communication with him, over my shoulder! This is a little too much, Azalea, and now the crisis has been reached. Either you give me a full explanation of your business with him, or you bring your visit here to an end. I cannot have you in my house, if you are deceitful and insincere. I stand by my offer; I will listen willingly to your story, and judge you most leniently. I don't really believe you _are_ up to anything wrong. But a secret is always mysterious and I hold that you are too young and inexperienced to have secrets from your elders.""""I have nothing to confess or confide, Cousin William,"" said Azalea, putting on a haughty air. ""I refuse to be accused of wrong-doing, when I am not guilty of it,--and I will bring my visit here to an end at once! I will leave to-morrow!""""Oh, pshaw, Zaly, don't go off so suddenly!"" Farnsworth laughed lightly, for he had said a little more than he meant to, and he realised, too, that this was neither the time nor the place to have such a serious talk with the girl.The Fair drew to a brilliant close. The second evening was even more gay and festive than the first. Everything was sold out,--or, if not, it was disposed of by auction after the time-honoured method of Fairs.""Yes, at times. Oh, he calls me 'most any old thing! He makes up new names for both of us every day! Come along, Zaly, you're dropping from sheer weariness. Time for little girls like you to go beddy!""""Sleep well,"" she said, as she left Azalea in her own room. ""And don't come downstairs in the morning before ten or eleven. I'm sure I shan't. The servants will clear everything up, and Bill will oversee it. I hate the aftermath of a Fair,--don't you?"""
"Smiling at the cajolery, the cook bustled about and soon had an appetising little repast ready. Azalea gratefully accepted the poached egg and the marmalade in addition to what she had requested, and in a short time had finished and prepared to depart.This was her secret. For years she had wanted to be a moving-picture actress, and she had hoped before she left Arizona for New York that she might get an opportunity to take up the work. She had expected to begin with minor parts, and hoped by her skill and earnest efforts to attain eminence.On the train, coming East, she had formed an acquaintance with Mr. Bixby and his wife, who were in the business. As their studio was not far from the Farnsworth home, Azalea had made plans with them to engage in the work.But Mrs. Bixby was a busy lady, and she said, ""Not now, dearie. You skittle home, and to-morrow maybe I can take a couple hours off to hear your tale of woe. You know you've already told me your swagger relatives would throw a fit if they knew what you were up to. Well, I guess it's about fit time!""Azalea disliked her style of speech, but Mrs. Bixby was kind hearted, and she had hoped to have her for a confidante. However, there was no chance then, for Mrs. Bixby hustled her off to the trolley-car, and Azalea went home to Wistaria Porch.Both Patty and Bill were somewhat suspicious of her and would naturally question her as to where she had been all day. She was tempted to tell them the whole truth and throw herself on their mercy, and but for one thing she would have done so. This was the fact that she had previously taken the baby, Fleurette, over to the studios and had used the child in the pictures.Azalea would not have done it, if it had occurred to her at first how the parents would resent such use of their child. But Mr. Bixby had needed a very young baby in a certain picture and Azalea, anxious to please, had offered to bring Fleurette over. She was herself so devoted to the little one and so careful of her, she felt no fear of any harm coming to her. Nor did it, for the infant was good and tractable, and did all that was required of her without any trouble. However, little was required except for her to coo and gurgle in one scene, and to lie quietly asleep in another.But there was one more short scene where Azalea had to rescue the baby from a burning house. To be sure the flames were artificial and there was no danger from the fire, but the baby was thrown from an upper window, and caught by Azalea, who stood down on the ground.Azalea, however, positively refused to take Fleurette again to the studio. She knew how she would be censured, should it be found out, and now Nurse Winnie and the two Farnsworths, as well as Elise, were all watching for anything mysterious that Azalea might do.She felt almost as if she were living over a slumbering volcano, that might at any moment blow her up. For Elise, she felt sure, would not keep the sampler incident to herself, and if Farnsworth heard of it he would be newly angry at that deception.Indeed, she practically decided, as she rode in the trolley-car, that if they were hard on her when she reached home, she _would_ run away. Of a wayward disposition and without really good early training, Azalea thought only of herself, and selfishly desired her own advancement without thought or regard for other people.Mona and Roger Farrington were there, and Philip Van Reypen and Chick Channing. This quartette had motored up from New York to dine, and Patty had already persuaded them to say they would stay over night."
"""You certainly are a great little old hostess, Patty!"" exclaimed Roger Farrington, as they seated themselves at table. ""I liked you heaps as a girl, but as mistress of a fine house you are even more charming.""""Thank you, Sir Hubert Stanley!"" smiled Patty; ""and I'm glad to admit that I learned a lot about managing a house from your gifted wife. Do you remember, Mona, how we kept house down at 'Red Chimneys'?""""Mustn't talk so before folks,"" she said, reprovingly. ""Now, people all, what shall we do with this lovely evening? It's moonlight, so any who are romantically inclined can ramble about the place, and flirt in the arbours,--while those who prefer can play bridge or--the piano. Or just sit and chat.""""Yes, I know; and there _is_ something queer going on. It may be that when Azalea goes off for a day or part of a day, that's where she goes. But I can hardly believe it. And why does she keep it so secret?""""And we certainly would _not_! I don't think it can be possible, Mona. But don't say anything to anybody,--not even to Little Billee,--until I can talk to Azalea, myself. I can do lots with her, alone, but not if anybody else is present.""""Well, I don't,"" Patty sighed. ""I like Azalea for lots of things,--she's good company and kind-hearted,--and she's devoted to Baby,--but I _can't_ like those free and easy manners! But she's a whole lot better than when she first came! Then she was _really_ a wild Indian! I've been able to tone her down a little.""Patty made a wry face. ""No, she isn't grateful. People never are grateful for that sort of thing. And she doesn't even _know_ she's different! I've had to train her without her own knowledge! But she's chameleon-like, in some ways, and she picks up a lot just from being with mannerly people.""""She does indeed! She's quite correct now,--in her actual doings. It's only in some burst of enthusiasm that she oversteps the bounds of propriety. Well, that's all. I thought I'd tell you,--for it isn't right that you shouldn't know. And there's no mistake. There's only one Azalea Thorpe."""
"""No; she didn't have a star part,--not even a named part. She was one of a crowd,--cowboys, ranch girls, and a general horde of 'woollies.' Don't accuse her of it, Patty; get around her and see what she says.""""'Star of the West.' It was a good play, but I was most interested in the girl I speak of. She was really your double,--but she did things that I don't believe you could compass,--athletic as you are.""This, she knew, was the first picture released in which she had taken a part. It was only a small part, but she had done well, the manager said, and that had been the reason for her further advancement.""Yes, they would. You don't know Bill. He's good and generous and kind,--but he hates anything like deceit,--and almost worse, he hates the whole moving-picture racket. I don't mean the pictures themselves, exactly,--but the idea of anybody of his being in them. And, oh, Ray,--it isn't only myself,--but I took--I took--""""Yes, I did. It didn't seem any harm, at first, and then, one day when I brought her home,--she was sleepy,--unusually so, I mean, and Nurse said she had been given soothing sirup,--and--I found out afterward she had! Mrs. Bixby had given her some, to keep her quiet in the picture, you know. Of course, I never dreamed of such a thing,--why, Ray, that little girl is as dear to me,--almost,--as she is to Patty! I wouldn't harm a hair of her blessed little curly head! And I'd never have allowed a drop of that sirup, if I'd known it! But I just gave her to Mrs. Bixby to hold, while I changed my costume,--Mrs. Bixby seems a good woman--""""You don't know anything about such things. I don't know much, but I know they must never have a bit of that stuff! Anyway, Ray?--we must go in now,--don't give my secret away until I give you permission, will you?""For the girl on the screen had flung herself, bareback, on a vicious, bucking pony, and holding on by his mane, went through the most hairbreadth escapes, yet was not thrown. Indeed, she finally tamed the wild creature, and dashed madly off on her errand. This was the rescue of a baby who had been left behind, when those who should have looked after the child were themselves fleeing from a cyclone.The baby, left to the care of servants, was in a lightly built house that rocked in the blasts. It threatened to collapse at any minute, and Azalea, racing against time, in the face of the gale, spurred on her flying steed, and reached the house just as it crashed to ruins.He thought little of the baby's danger, knowing the methods of making pictures, but he was lost in admiration of Azalea, her fine athletic figure, and her free, strong motions, as she battled with the winds and triumphantly snatched the baby from harm.Then, the child in one arm, she flung herself again on the pony's back, the animal prancing wildly, but tractable beneath Azalea's determined guidance, and they were off like the wind itself to a place of safety. The wild ride was picturesque, if frightful, and there was a burst of applause from the spectators, as Azalea, panting, exhausted, but safe, at last reached her goal, and leaning down from the horse, placed the baby in the arms of its weeping, distracted mother."
"Azalea's beauty was of the sort that needs excitement or physical exertion to bring out its best effects and as she stood beside the quivering, spent horse, her own heart beating quickly, her own breath coming hard, she was a picture of vivid beauty.Her dress was disordered, her hair hung in loosened coils, her collar was half torn off by the wind, but the happy smile and the justifiable pride in her success lighted up her countenance till it was fairly radiant.Patty and Mona had come to the theatre later than Azalea, and had been given seats on the other side of the large house. The darkness, too, made it unlikely that they should see each other, and so Azalea remained in blissful ignorance of Patty's presence.""Yes, she's a real beauty,--of the true breezy, Western type. But, Mona, what _will_ Bill say? I do believe I shall feel more lenient about it all than he will! He is conservative, you know, for all his Western bringing up. Oh, my gracious, Mona, _what's_ she doing now?""And then--when at last Azalea emerged from the tumbled-down ruin of the little old house, with a baby in her arms, Patty gave a cry of startled fear, and then clapped her hand over her mouth, lest her dismay be too evident to those sitting near by.Mona felt it must be true. To be sure she couldn't really recognise Fleurette's face, but she was certain that Patty's mother heart could make no mistake, and it was small wonder that she was overcome at seeing her child in such scenes.""Oh, hush, Mona! you don't know what I'm suffering! I guess if your baby had been taken off and put through such awful doings, you'd know what I feel! My baby,--my little flower baby! In that awful crashing, tumbling down old shanty! Oh, I _can't_ stand it!""""I can't make it out,"" Mona mused. ""If her father were dead, she'd have no reason to conceal the fact. Nor if he had remarried. And if he has done anything disgraceful--maybe that's it, Bill! Maybe he's in jail!""""I've thought of that, Mona, and, of course, it's a possibility. That would explain her not getting letters, and her unwillingness to tell the reason. But,--somehow, it isn't very plausible. Why shouldn't she confide in me? I've begged her to,--and no matter what Uncle Thorpe may have done, it's no real reflection on Azalea.""""And I just thought,"" Mona went on, ""that I'd tell you before Patty did,--for,--oh, well, this is my real reason,--Patty is so wrought up and so wild over the Fleurette matter that she can't judge Azalea fairly,--and I don't want to have injustice done to her at this stage of the game. For, Bill, Azalea has real talent,--real dramatic genius, _I_ think, and if there's no reason against it,--except conventional ones,--I think she ought to be allowed to become a motion-picture actress. She's bound to make good,--she has the right sort of a face for the screen,--beautiful, mobile, expressive, and really, a speaking countenance. Why, she'd make fame and fortune, I'm positive."""
"""I knew you'd say that! And I know Patty will say--oh, good Heavens, I don't know _what_ Patty will say! But I do know this; she would have been sensible and would have felt just as I do about it, if it hadn't been for the Fleurette part of it. Before the baby appeared on the screen Patty was really delighted with Azalea. She was enthusiastic about her talent and her beauty,--really, Bill, she looked very beautiful in the pictures.""""That's just what I'm doing! I'm glad you've got it through your head at last. And I ask this of you, old friend. Whatever you do or say to Azalea, think it well over beforehand. If you talk to Patty, as she is feeling now you'll both be ready to tar and feather poor Zaly; and, truly, she doesn't deserve it! Please, Bill, go slow,--and be just. Be generous if you can,--but at any rate, be just. That's all I ask. And you can't be just if you act on impulse,--so, go slow. Will you?""""Yes, Mona,--there's my hand on it We're not often over-impulsive,--Patty and I,--but in this case we may be,--might have been,--if you hadn't warned me. You're a good girl, Mona, and I thank you for your foresight and real kindness,""Farnsworth sat looking at her, his blue eyes full of a contented admiration. To this simple-minded, big-hearted man, his wife and child represented the whole world. All he had, all he owned, he valued only for the pleasure it might mean to them.""Of course I know,"" and Patty wagged a wise head at him. ""First, because you're not sufficiently surprised,--she told you all about it! And second, because you're not furious at Azalea! Mona has talked you around to her way of thinking,--which is, that Azalea is a genius,--and that--""Patty was feeling decidedly better about the whole matter. Having sat for nearly an hour, holding and fondling her idolised child, she realised that whatever Fleurette had gone through, she was safe now,--and that whatever was to be done to Azalea by way of punishment, was more Bill's affair than hers.""You don't care two cents for your wonder-child! Your own little buttercup,--your daffy-downdilly baby!"" she cried, in pretended reproof, and then Farnsworth took Fleurette and tossed her about until she squealed with glee.""_Our_ relative, I should advise her to go in for the thing seriously; but,--I may be over-conservative,--even snobbish, but I do hate to have our cousin's portrait all over the fences and ashbarrels, and in all the Sunday papers, and--"""
"""I don't mind that publicity so much as I do the possible effects on Azalea's life. I don't know that the career of a 'movie' star is as full of dangerous pitfalls as the theatrical line, but--I hate to see Azalea subjected to them,--for her own sake.""""Of course, I'll take up the matter of Fleurette with Azalea, separately,"" Farnsworth went on. ""But even if she's determined on her career, I feel sure we can persuade her to leave her little assistant out of it!""""Oh, well, they'll weed them out. Some of them are awful cunning,--and one is a first-class crying spell! They never could get but one of Fleurette crying, she's such a good-natured kiddy. All right, Chick,--start it off.""She and Phil had gone for the sort of walk they both loved,--along woodland paths, cross-lots, now and then back on the highroad, and if they got too far to walk back, prepared to return by train or trolley.The two were congenial spirits, which fact had rather surprised Van Reypen's friends. For he was a conservative, fastidious aristocrat, and though Azalea's rough edges had been rubbed down a bit by Patty's training, she was still of a very different type from the Van Reypen stock.""It was. Patty gives them rides in turn. Now, Winnie the nurse was in, and so it must be her Sunday out. And, of course, Patty is home there with the baby,--she never leaves her if Winnie's away, but still--I feel as if I must go home to look after that child!""As they passed the Gales' place, on their way from the car-line to the house, Van Reypen said, ""Guess I'll stop here a minute if you don't mind. I left my pet pipe here yesterday. Skip along home, and I'll follow.""""I know you _are_,--and mighty quick, too,"" he retorted, in a low voice, but tones of great determination. ""I know everybody is out,--you are practically alone in the house, and I know you're coming with me,--willing or not! It won't hurt the baby a mite,--I've my little car out in the road,--and if you _don't_ consent,--I'll--""The Gale house also was on the other side of the Farnsworth house, and so, indeed, if Azalea chose to call for help, it would do no good. Doubtless Phil would be along shortly, but there was no telling, for there was always a merry crowd on the Gale's piazza and he would stay there talking for a time.Azalea had wild thoughts of running away,--anywhere,--but she knew the futility of such a plan. Merritt was a big and strong man, and though Azalea was a swift runner, she could not get a start without his intervening.""Don't talk rubbish,"" he said, shortly; ""you know as well as I do, it won't hurt the child. In fact, I came to get her to-day, myself, because I knew her nurse was out,--and I saw you go off,--and later, all the rest of the bunch. If _you_ hadn't come back,--confound you! I'd have had that child over there by this time!""Azalea gasped. So her premonition had been a true one after all! Had she not returned, Merritt would have easily overcome Janet and taken the baby off with him. She knew they would not harm Fleurette,--indeed, would be most careful of her. Unless, perhaps, they should give her soothing-sirup again. Well they'd get no chance, for Azalea was determined the baby should not be taken from her, and she most certainly was not going herself."
"""No; and that's what I told Mr. Merritt,"" went on Azalea. ""But he is tricky, and I felt pretty sure he'd try underhand means to get the baby. I've kept watch night and day, and I've always been certain that Fleurette was either in Winnie's care or Patty's. Patty wouldn't trust her with _me_ any more.""""When I went away from the house to-day, Patty was at home, so, though I knew it was Winnie's day off, I felt all right about Baby. Then,--while we were out walking, I saw Winnie go by,--and soon after I felt a--a sort of presentiment that I _must_ go home. I couldn't tell why,--only I felt I must come back to the house at once. So I did,--and everything seemed to be all right. I decided I had been foolishly nervous about it,--and I took Fleurette down on the porch for a little while.""Then that man came and demanded her! I was alone, except for Janet,--who is no good in an emergency,--and Mr. Merritt was very determined. If I hadn't thought of the phonograph I don't know what I should have done, for that man is quite capable of taking Baby away from my arms by main force. But I happened to think I could fool him,--as I couldn't combat him,--so I put on the crying record to make him think we were still in the library,--and I scooted over to Gales' with the baby as fast as I could run. Then I came back--""""I know it,--and I'm never going to do it again! I've had enough! I wanted to make it my career,--but,"" she hesitated, ""that was before I knew you--you nice people. I--I never knew _really_ nice people before,--my Western friends are--are different. But I want to be like you,"" her troubled glance took in Patty and Bill and then drifted to the others; and her face was wistful and only lighted up as she looked at Van Reypen. He smiled encouragingly at her, and she continued.""Not at all,"" Azalea declared; ""I wasn't mixed up with anybody unpleasant at all. In fact, I talked to no one but the Bixbys and Mr. Merritt. Mrs. Bixby was most kind and looked after me as a mother might have done,--though I never knew a mother's care.""The pretty face grew sad, and the whole attitude of Azalea was so penitent and full of resolve to be more like the people she admired that all of Patty's lingering resentment fled away. She put the baby in her father's arms, and she flew over to Azalea and gave her an embrace of full and free forgiveness and affection.""It's all right, Zaly,"" she said, smiling at her, ""you _did_ cut up jinks with my baby,--but when you came home to look after her,--even when you thought I was here,--and when you put up such a great game to rescue her from the enemy's clutches,--and succeeded,--well,--_I'm_ for _you_!""""I'm glad of it,"" returned Azalea, simply. ""I was too ignorant to know that there were no samplers made at that earlier date,--and to tell the truth, I didn't think much about it,--I just did it hastily,--on a sudden impulse,--because I wanted to give Elise something worth-while for her booth at the fair.""""Oh, come off, all of you,"" he said, laughingly, ""this isn't a court of inquiry, and we're not sitting in judgment on Azalea. She has properly admitted all her escapades, and she's been forgiven by the ones most interested, now let's call it a day,--and talk about something else."""
"""All right,--let's talk about the 'Star of the West,'"" cried the irrepressible Ray Gale. ""Now the secret's out, there's no harm in mentioning it. You _must_ see that picture, Farnsworth, and then you'll be begging Azalea to go back to screen work!""""Never,"" said Azalea, her face shining with happiness that she was forgiven and reinstated in general favour, ""I've had my lesson. No more films for me! From now on, I'm going to be goody-girl,--and behave like nice ladies,--like Patty and Betty--and Elise.""Poor Elise was of an unfortunate disposition, and envy and jealousy were her besetting sins. She had never liked Azalea for the reason that the Western girl, with her frank, untutored ways, often usurped Elise's place in the limelight, and Miss Farrington greatly objected to that.It was with malicious purpose that Elise had brought up the subject of the sampler, and when she found it passed over as of little moment, she was angry at herself for having raised the question at all.""Oh, come, now, Elise,"" said Farnsworth, laughing at this tempest in a teapot, ""play fair. We all like you, and we all like Azalea, whether she models herself on you or not; so let's all love one another,--and let it go at that!""""Yes,"" said Patty, ""and now, my fellow lovers and loveresses, I must take my small daughter in and send her to sleepy-by, and the rest of you have just about half an hour before it's time to dress for dinner. The two Gales may consider themselves invited,--if they will honour us.""""Delighted,"" replied Betty, ""though not overwhelmingly surprised at the invitation. Howsumever, we must fly back home for some purple and fine linen, and then we'll return anon. I'm usually returning here, anon! I wonder what I ever did, Patty, before you came here to live as our hospitable neighbours!""""It woke me up,"" she said, reminiscently, ""when that man tried to take Fleurette from my arms. I would have fought him like a tiger if I hadn't suddenly realised that the way to fix _him_ was by strategy. I just happened to think that by means of the record I could fool him into believing we were in the library, when really we were flying to refuge. I knew he wouldn't come in as long as he felt sure we were there, for he was watching out for the Farnsworths' return. So, I tried the scheme, and it worked!""""Well, for one thing, you've been very kind to me. I was in a sorry position to-day, and you and Cousin William backed me up so beautifully, that I pulled through. If you hadn't I'd have collapsed and given up the game, in sheer fright.""""Betty was reserving decision, too; and but for the strong support of you and Cousin William,--yes, and Ray Gale,--I shouldn't have come off so well. But I deserved any fate. I _have_ been bad,--and though I am sorry,--that doesn't wipe it all out.""Azalea Thorpe couldn't believe her ears. What Van Reypen was saying seemed as if it could have but one meaning,--yet that was impossible! Philip Van Reypen, the high-born, aristocratic Philip, couldn't be seriously interested in a crude, ignorant Western girl!"
"""Thank you, Phil,"" she said, resolving to accept his words as a sign of friendship, ""you're awfully good to me, and your friendship counts. I begin to think friendship is the one thing in life that does count. And it is the friends I have made--lately,--here,--that have made me see,--made me realise my own unworthiness,--and when I say that, I mean it.""""I won't let you mean it!"" he cried, ""I won't let you call yourself unworthy. For you count with me,--Azalea, more than the whole world! More than anything or everything in the world. Can't I count that way with you,--can't I, Azalea?""""Don't you know what I mean, Brownie? Listen, and I will tell you, then. I love you, dear,--I love you."" He held her hands in his own and gazed into her face. ""I can't tell you when it came or how,--but suddenly--I knew it! I knew I loved you, and should always love you. Tell me,--tell me, Azalea, that you can learn to love me.""""Not just at once, dear,--I can't hope for that. But, can't you learn,--can't you try to learn--If I help you? Brownie,--that's all my own name for you,--isn't it, you nutbrown maid! Brownie, darling,--you _must_ love me. I can't bear it if you don't!""""I see that I've a right to care for the girl if I choose, and as you are her nearest relative, that I know of, I come to you for sanction of my suit. Aside from your rather inexplicable astonishment--have you any real objection to me as a new cousin-in-law?""""I hope she'll be pleased. It's no secret that I adored Patty and tried my best to cut you out,--but, not having succeeded in that, I've been glad to be the friend of both of you, and we've had lots of good times, all together. But,--well, I never expected to know another real whole-hearted love,--and then along comes this splendid girl,--this daughter of your own big, beautiful, breezy West, and before I know it, she has taken my heart by storm!""""I know enough. If you mean her escapades with the picture people or her innocent joke about the patchwork sampler,--I don't care about those little things. She has a wonderful big, noble nature, that will respond quickly to loving care and gentle advice. And,--I _think_ she cares for me, but--""""Of course she cares for you! What girl wouldn't! Don't underestimate yourself or your attractions, Phil. But I'll speak plainly; you're a big man in lots of ways,--beside physically. You're an aristocrat,--of an old family,--and you're very rich. Now,--Azalea--"""
"""Please don't talk of my birth or wealth as assets. I offer Azalea a heart full of love, and a constant care for her happiness and well-being. If she does care for me, I want your permission to try to win her. I have broached the subject--""""I don't know. And it may be nothing. But,--her only near relative, so far as I know, is her father. A man I knew years ago,--a cousin of mine,--and a decent, hard-working, plain man. Now, Zaly has not had a single letter from him since she has been here.""""That he's in jail? That's the idea that haunts my brain. I can't think of any other explanation for his continued silence,--and for Azalea's mysterious disinclination to talk about him. Why, Phil, she forged a letter,--wrote one to herself,--and pretended to me that it was from her father!""""Poor child! How unhappy she must be over it. If she cares for me, Bill, I'll take all that load off her poor little shoulders. I'll get her to tell me the truth, and then we'll see what can be done. But, in any case, or whatever her father may be, it won't affect my love for the girl herself. My idea of birth and breeding is that it gives one an opportunity to be tolerant and generous toward others of fewer advantages. To me, Azalea stands alone,--her family connections, whatever they may be, I accept gladly, for her dear sake.""""I know; it _is_ pretty sudden. But, she somehow bowled me over all at once. Her brave attitude to-day, when she told her little story, her sweet acceptance of Elise's remarks, made in petty spite, and her whole big spirit of fearless determination to go into the picture work,--only to have it spoiled entirely by the wicked acts of that villain Merritt,--I tell you, Farnsworth, she's a girl of a thousand! I read her, I understand her better than you do, and I see far beneath her untaught, outward manner the real girl,--the sterling traits of a fine character.""""All right, Phil, go in and win! You have my blessing,--and when Patty revives from her first shock of surprise, she'll bless you, too. It was Patty's work, getting Azalea here,--and Patty has tried every way in the world to help and improve her--""""But you must find out about her father. It's queer that she acts so mysterious about him. And, so far as I know, she's had no letters from anybody back home,--her home is at Horner's Corners. Awful place!"""
"The two men went out to join the others on the porch. Both were in thoughtful mood. Van Reypen full of his new happiness, and eager to see Azalea again, Farnsworth still amazed, and a little uncomfortable over the whole matter. He felt a responsibility for Azalea, and yet, if Phil was willing to take her without further knowledge of her family,--why should he, Bill, object?""I know! Betty Gale. And I'm _so_ glad, Phil. I know you used to like me,--and I was and am fond of you,--but you needn't think I resent your loving another. I'm honestly glad, and I wish you all the happiness in the world!""""Patty, stop! I won't let you talk like that! I admit I'm blind to her faults,--if she has any,--for I'm desperately in love,--but I do look to you and Bill for sympathy and approval. And I don't want any of that King Cophetua talk, either! Just because I happen to be born under a family tree, and happen to have as much money as I want,--that's no reason for implying that those are my chief attractions. I can give Azalea more worth-while things than that! I can give her the love and adoration that is every woman's desire and right,--I can give her loving care and help,--I can--""""Oh, Phil, how splendid you are! You make me 'most wish--"" But Patty's honest blue eyes wouldn't let her say the words. ""No, I don't wish anything of the sort! You are a splendid man, and I do appreciate you, but I have my Bill, and he's all the world to me. Now, I'm more than glad you've found a your fate at last,--but--Azalea!""It wasn't until the others were seated at the table that Azalea come into the dining-room. She looked quite unlike her usual self, and was very quiet. Her face showed a pathetic, wistful expression, but her eyes were cast down, and now and then the corners of her scarlet mouth trembled.""You've answered me!"" cried Van Reypen, his eyes shining with gladness, ""if you love me,--nothing else matters! And you can't love me 'too much'! I want all there is of your love,--your dear love! Is it really mine?""""It's really yours, as far as it's in my power to give it,--but,"" and Azalea's face grew very sad, ""I can't give it to you,--out of consideration of your rights. I can't love you, Philip, I mustn't let myself even think of it!"""
"""Help me out,"" he said, in a low tone. ""Azalea has gone to her room, and there is certainly something troubling her. Go to her, Patty,--find out what it all means,--and if it is any foolishness about 'unworthiness' or that rubbish, try to make her see that I want her just as she is. I don't care a hang about her ancestors or her father or anything in the whole world, but just Azalea Thorpe!""For Azalea, annoyed at the intrusion, stood, hands clenched, and eyes scowling, and she said angrily, ""I don't think people ought to come into other people's rooms, uninvited! I don't call _that_ good manners!""""Oh, yes, stand up for her,--every one has gone mad over our 'heroine'! I call it disgraceful to be mixed up with that movie concern, and let me tell you, Azalea Thorpe, if you think Mr. Van Reypen is going to overlook or forget that, you're greatly mistaken! You know, Patty,--our Western friend here, is already aspiring toward Philip--""Then the notes were shown to the other two guests, Elise and Channing, for the departure of Azalea could not be kept secret, and of course they must immediately put forth every possible effort to find her.""Hush, Elise,"" said Farnsworth, sternly. ""I know you don't like Azalea, but I must ask you not to talk against her while you are under my roof. Whatever she is, she is my kin,--and I shall start at once in search of her, and learn the secret,--the mystery of her life. She _has_ acted 'queer,' I freely admit it, but I, for one, believe she is all right and whatever is troubling her is not her fault or wrong-doing.""The result of the inquiry was that the cook, who was around early, had seen Azalea start away from the house at about six o'clock. She had not thought it strange at all, for Azalea often went for a long walk before breakfast. Cook said that Azalea wore a travelling suit and carried a fair-sized bag.""Never mind the why and wherefore,"" returned Phil, ""but, as you say, where would she probably go? Not over to the Gales', of course, that's too near home. I am ready to declare that she went to the moving-picture studios.""""Nonsense, Elise,"" laughed Channing; ""she loves that man like a cat loves hot soap! I know better than that. But I think she may have gone over there to see Mrs. Bixby. That woman has been kind to Azalea, and I feel sure that's where she'd go.""But Farnsworth was not at all sanguine as to the bringing back of Azalea. He knew her, in some ways, far better than Van Reypen did, and he felt sure that when Azalea decided to go away, she would not be easily found.Van Reypen was not quite sure she was telling him the truth, but his deep anxiety so stirred the motherly heart of Mrs. Bixby that she assured him earnestly that her statements were absolutely true, and that she was as anxious to find the missing girl as her friends were.All the morning they searched the grounds and the neighbourhood; they ransacked Azalea's belongings in hope of some old letter or clue of some sort. But nothing gave so much as a hint of anything that could have happened to her, that made her go away.This involved speech brought a laugh, but Philip went on; ""I think she would. Azalea is more sensitive than you thought her. None of you understand her,--well, except Patty,--and her poor little heart was broken by your criticisms and continual reproofs. Suppose she isn't quite as well up in the airs and graces of society as you all are,--she has other traits that make up for that--"""
"""To my home in New York City."" She gave him the address. ""You see, Miss Adams came here because she knows Miss Frawley,--we live together--but Miss Frawley is out of town,--and I persuaded Miss Adams to stay with me until her return. I can't make out the trouble, but I have learned the address of the Farnsworths and--oh, well, I may as well tell you, Miss Adams talked in her sleep. She arrived here utterly exhausted, and on the verge of nervous prostration. But, it may be, some sleep will set her nerves right, if the cause of the trouble can be removed. And,--I know I am intruding,--but I can't help thinking that it's a lovers' quarrel, and _you_ can set it right!""""Come along, Patty,"" Van Reypen cried, as he hung up the receiver, ""come on, Bill! I've found her! She's assumed the name of Alice Adams,--and she's with a sweet-voiced lady named Grayson. Come on,--I'll tell you the rest as we go.""They didn't break the speed laws, as their car flew down to New York, but it was only because that would have meant delay in reaching their goal. About mid-afternoon they arrived at Miss Grayson's apartment and surprised Azalea by entering the room where she sat.With a tired little sigh, Azalea put her hand in his. ""How did you find me?"" she began, but Van Reypen said, ""Never mind that, now. You just come back home with us,--and first thank Miss Grayson prettily for her kindness to you.""""I am a wicked girl,"" the pathetic little voice went on. ""I lived in Homer's Corners,--and I lived with the woman who keeps the post-office there. I've been an orphan since I was four, and this woman brought me up,--though it scarcely could be called that, for she only looked on me as her assistant in the office and in her house.""Well, one day a letter came for Azalea Thorpe. Now, the Thorpes moved away from Horner's Corners two years ago, and we never knew their new address. The few letters that came for them were sent to the Dead Letter Office. This one would have been, but for the fact that it was unsealed.""It had been sealed, but the envelope was all unstuck, and--I read the letter. I own up to it,--I know it was wrong,--but I didn't know then _how_ wrong. You see, I wasn't taught much about honour and right. It is only since I have been with good people that I realise what an awful thing I did. When I read it, I couldn't help thinking what a pity for that wonderful invitation to her to make a visit in the East, to be wasted! And the more I thought, the more I was possessed of an idea that I might personate Azalea Thorpe and have the visit myself. Oh, if you _knew_ how I hated the place where I lived,--how I hated the home I had,--how I wanted to get out into the great world, and have my chance! And, yes, I wanted to be a moving-picture actress. I was _sure_ I could do better than the pictures I saw in that little town, and--well, the more I thought about it,--the more it seemed an easy and plausible thing to do."
