passage
"""You see it is just this way,"" Amy twisted her fingers together, drew her breath hard, and rushed on nervously; ""Jack--he's my brother, you know--promised me--I never told you--if I would only learn to play on the piano, he'd take me to Europe with him next time, and now he's coming to-morrow, and--and, oh! what shall I do?""""Now, Amy,"" said Polly kindly, getting down on her knees beside the girl where she had thrown herself on the broad lounge, ""you must just understand, dear, that I cannot help you unless you will have self-control and be a little woman yourself.""""You told me I would be sorry if I didn't practice,"" mourned Amy, dragging her wet little handkerchief between her fingers, ""but I didn't suppose Jack was coming for six months, and I'd have time to catch up, and now--oh dear me!"" and she burrowed deeper into Miss Salisbury's big sofa-pillow.""I can almost play that horrible 'Chopin,'"" said Amy irrelevantly; ""that is, I could, if--oh Miss Pepper,"" she broke off suddenly and brought her flushed face very near to the one above her, ""could you help me play it--just hear me, you know, and tell me things you did, over again, about it, if I practice all the afternoon? Could you?""""But you don't understand,"" cried Polly, vexed with herself that she couldn't help her annoyance from being seen. ""I shall put some one else out if I give up my evening. I have an engagement, Amy. No, I don't see how I can do it, child; I'm sorry."" And then before she knew how, she put both arms around the little figure. ""Don't cry, dear, I suppose I must. I'll get out of the other thing. Yes, fly at Chopin, and keep your courage up, and I'll be over at seven. Then to-morrow Brother Jack will say 'How fine!' and off you'll go over the seas!""Outside, Polly, after enlisting Miss Salisbury's favor for the evening's plan, was hurrying along the pavement, calling herself an hundred foolish names for helping an idle girl out of a scrape. ""And to think of losing the only chance to hear D'Albert,"" she mourned. ""Well, it's done now, and can't be helped. Even Jasper when he hears of it, will think me a silly, I suppose. Now to make my peace with Pickering.""She turned down the avenue running out from the street that had the honor to contain ""Miss Salisbury's Boarding and Day School for Young Ladies,"" and met face to face, suddenly, a young man, about whose joy at meeting her, there could be no doubt.""Take care how you talk against this,"" cried Polly, hugging it closer. ""Indeed you shall not touch it, till you are glad that I am a music teacher. Oh, I must tell you--I was on my way to your house because I was afraid you wouldn't understand a note. I can't go to-night.""""Why, I must give it up,"" cried Polly nervously; ""don't ask me--or perhaps I ought to tell you, Pickering, then you'll see I can't help myself."" And Polly rapidly unfolded her plan for the evening, omitting all details as to Amy's careless waste of her lessons despite all efforts to make her practice. At the end of the recital, Pickering Dodge came to a full pause on the sidewalk, regardless of all passers-by, and turned a glowering face on Polly, who was forced to stand still also, and look at him."
"""I don't know,"" said poor Polly, who had lost the first flush of enthusiasm over her plan, and to whom nothing now seemed so delightful as the sight and sound of D'Albert and his wonderful melody. ""Well, it's done, so don't tempt me to feel badly, Pickering.""""Then,"" said Polly, all her tears dried, ""I must go with you, if you hold me to it."" She raised her head, and looked him full in the eyes. ""I will be ready,"" and she moved off with her most superb air, without deigning a good-by.""Alexia!"" exclaimed Pickering angrily. ""Indeed I will not. I don't want any one if I can't have you, Polly."" He was really miserable now, and needed comfort, so she turned around and administered it as only Polly could.By the time the talk was over, she hurried off with a radiant face, and Pickering with an expression only one remove from that of absolute gloom, retraced his steps to lay one of ""the lovely seats"" for the D'Albert concert, before Miss Rhys, for her acceptance.Phronsie came slowly down the hall to meet Polly as usual; this day with one of her company white gowns on. Polly always knew when these were donned that something unusual was to be expected from the daily routine of the household.""So you must be,"" said Phronsie, with a little sigh, ""for you were so long in coming home. Well, do hurry now, Polly."" This last as Polly was skipping over the stairs to her own room to freshen up a bit. Then Phronsie turned into the dining-room to be quite sure that the butler had made the belated luncheon as fine as Polly could desire it.""She didn't ask why I had on this gown,"" mused Phronsie, softly disposing again the flowers at Polly's plate, ""and it's funny, I think, for Polly always sees everything;"" and she began to look troubled at once.""This is just as splendid as it can be,"" cried Polly, coming in, and picking up one of the roses at her plate. ""Phronsie, you are just a dear to have everything so nice,"" and she fastened it at her belt. ""Why, dear me! You've a fine gown on! What is going to happen?""""But I do,"" said Phronsie, forgetting her age, to hop up and down on the rug, ""we've a letter while you were at the school, and I wasn't to tell you suddenly, so I put on one of my nice gowns, so you would know.""""He is--he is!"" cried Phronsie in a little scream; ""you've guessed it, Polly. And Mamsie said--she's gone down town with Grandpapa; he's going to get tickets for the concert to-night, so that you can all go together, even if you can't sit together, and she said that""--""Well, I'm all right now,"" said Polly, her brow clearing; ""the bad has gone at last, I hope, to stay away, Phronsie. Now I must hurry and eat this nice luncheon you've fixed for me;"" and she sprang toward the table.""No; I've given it up,"" said Polly, sitting down and beginning on her chop and toast. ""Bless you, dear, you've given me an orchid,"" glancing down between her mouthfuls to the bouquet at her plate; ""you should have saved them all for Jasper."""
"Phronsie smiled with great satisfaction at this, and went off. At a quarter of seven, Polly, in a storm of remonstrance from all but one, hurried off to help poor Amy Loughead through her Slough of Despond.Jasper alone, just arrived for dinner, was the only one who remained silent when the storm of disapproval broke forth over Polly and her doings. After the first astonished exclamation, he had absolutely refused to say anything save ""Polly knows best.""""I don't know how to thank you,"" said Polly out in the wide hall, where he hurried to meet her, as she ran downstairs with her plainest walking things on, ""for I don't believe they would have let me go. I never saw Mamsie feel so, Jasper."" And now Polly could not keep the tears back.""I made it all right with father,"" said Jasper, ""as soon as I heard of your plan; and Mr. Alstyne is on his way over to take my place; at least he ought to be in response to my note. Don't worry, Polly; come.""""Don't spoil it,"" advised Alexia coolly, with a sidelong gaze at his face. ""Well, of course I mean everybody except Polly; and I'm sure, Pickering, it isn't my fault that she didn't come; Polly always was queer about some things.""""And now she is queerer than ever,"" said Alexia, glad to think that the dainty blue affair on her head, she called a bonnet, was already doing its work, as she heard a lady in the seat back of them, question if it were not one of the newest of Madame Marchaud's creations. So she sat more erect, and played nonchalantly with her fan. ""Yes, and it's all because of those dreadfully horrid music lessons.""""You are--I wish you could see your face; it's as black as a thunder cloud,"" said Alexia, with the consciousness that her own was as calm as a June morning. ""And I'm sure if you don't want to attract people to our conversation, you might at least look a little pleasanter.""Pickering threw two or three nervous glances on either side, to prove her words, and was by no means reassured to see the countenance of Billy Harlow, one of his young business friends, across the aisle, suffused with an attempt to appear as if he hadn't been a witness to the little by-play.""You needn't,"" said Alexia, swinging her fan with an even hand, and still smiling sweetly, this time including in it Billy, who had no girl with him. ""I really could endure life at home better than this bliss."" And then D'Albert came on the stage, and it was the proper thing to keep quiet, so the hostilities died down.""Yes, she is,"" said Alexia sharply, ""at the Exeter--we can't stop her; she says she's proud to do it, and it shows the girls' wonderful ability; and all that sort of thing--and--and--oh dear me! after she's once done that, she'll always be 'Miss Pepper the music teacher.' Isn't it horrid!""""He didn't really mean to pull your hair, Jasper,"" said Phronsie in a worried way; and getting up from the floor where she had been deserted by the baby, she hurried over to the two flying around in the center of the room.""Oh! I hope he does,"" said old Mr. King cheerfully, coming in and sitting down in his favorite chair. ""I'm sure it speaks well for the young man's powers of self-defense, if he gives Jasper a good tweak.""""Father!"" cried Jasper in pretended astonishment. ""Well, King-Fisher, as popular opinion is against me, I'll set you down again, and nurse my poor scalp,"" and down went the white bundle again to the floor, Phronsie going back to her post as nurse."
"""No, indeed,"" again said Mr. King. ""Come here, you little scamp,"" catching the baby out of Polly's hand, to set him on his other knee; ""there now, speak up like a man, and tell your sister that you are not particular about the time you have your Tree.""And the baby crowed, and seized Phronsie's floating yellow hair with both hands, and they all got in one another's way to rescue it; and Mrs. Pepper hurried in again, this time for Baby; and he was kissed all around, Phronsie giving him two for fear he might think she was hurt; and one of the maids popped in with ""There is a gentleman in the reception room to see Miss Mary.""""Doesn't the fellow know better than to come when we are home for the Christmas holidays?"" grumbled Joel. Jasper looked as if he could say as much, but instead, walked to the window, and looked out silently.""Beg pardon for troubling you,"" said a tall young man, getting off from the divan to meet her, as she hurried into the reception room, ""but you were good enough to say that I might talk with you about my sister, and really I am very much at sea to know what to do with her, Miss Pepper.""""She has a little,"" confessed Polly, ""but not dreadfully. And I do think, Mr. Loughead, now that you have come, and that she sees how much you want her to study and practice, she will really do better. I do, indeed,"" said Polly earnestly.Outside she could hear the ""two boys,"" as she still called them, and Grandpapa's voice in animated consultation over the ways and means, she knew as well as if she were there, of spending the holidays, and it seemed as if she could never sit in the reception room another moment longer, but that she must fly out to them.""I know it."" Polly's heart leaped guiltily. Oh! how could she think of holidays and good times, while this poor little girl, but fifteen, had only a dreary sense of boarding-school life to mean home to her. ""And oh! I do think,"" Polly hastened to say, and she clasped her hands as Phronsie would have done, ""it has made all the difference in the world to her. And she does just lovely--so much better, I mean, than other girls would in her place. I do really, Mr. Loughead,"" repeated Polly.""And no sister,"" added Jack, as if to himself. ""How is a fellow like me--why, I am twenty-five, Miss Pepper, and I've been knocking about the world ever since I was her age; my uncle took me then to Australia, into his business--how am I ever to 'understand,' as you call it, that girl?""""And you must make her the very best friend you have in all this world, and let her see that you are glad that she is your sister, and tell her things, and never, never scold."" Then Polly stopped, and the color flew up to the waves of brown hair on her brow.""Oh! I've said enough,"" said Polly, with a gasp, and beginning to wish she could be anywhere out of the range of those great black eyes. ""Do forgive me,"" she begged; ""I didn't mean to say anything to hurt you.""""No, no,"" cried Polly, getting out of her chair, ""I didn't mean so, indeed I didn't, Mr. Loughead. Oh! what have I said? I think you have done beautifully. How could you help things when you were not here? Oh! Mr. Loughead, I do hope you will forgive me. I have only made matters worse, I'm afraid,"" and poor Polly's face drooped."
"Jasper, seeing that an answer was expected of him, drew himself up, and said quickly, ""Oh! he's the brother of that girl at the Salisbury School, father. You know Polly goes over there to help her practice.""""And Polly tried to help Amy, and make the best of her. And the brother asked if he might have a talk some time about his sister. Polly couldn't help telling him 'yes,'"" said Jasper, but with a pang at the handsome stranger's delight as she said it.And in came Polly, looking like a rose; and following her a tall young man, with large, black eyes, whom she immediately led up to Mr. King's chair. ""Grandpapa,"" she said, ""this is Mr. Loughead, Amy's brother, you know""--And Jasper went forward and put out his hand, as an old acquaintance of the evening before, and Joel was introduced, and mumbled something about ""Glad to know you,"" immediately retreating into the corner, and then there was a pause, which Polly broke by crying: ""O, Grandpapa! I am going to ask Amy to play at Dunraven for Phronsie's poor children. Why, where is Phronsie?"" looking around the room.""Capital, capital,"" pronounced the old gentleman quite as if he had proposed it. And before any one knew how it had come about, there was Jack Loughead talking over the run down to Bedford with them all on Christmas morning, as a matter of course, and as if it had been the annual affair to him, that it was to all the others.""Quite a fine young man,"" said Mr. King, when Jack had at last run off with a bright smile and word for all, ""and Phronsie will be so pleased to think of his doing all this for her poor children. Bless her! Well, David, my man, are you back so soon?""""Impossible!"" exclaimed old Mr. King, pulling out his watch. ""Er--bless me! the boy is right. Now, Polly, my child, you and I must put off our engagement till afternoon. Then we'll have our Christmasing!""""The worst thing that could possibly happen,"" said Mr. King irritably; ""Phronsie's box of dolls is left behind."" Then he began to fume up and down the platform, wholly lost to everything but his indignation.And then, most of the little knots heard the commotion, and came hurrying up with ""What is it?"" and ""Oh dear, what's the matter?"" in time to hear Polly groan, ""And Joe thought so much of going down to Dunraven with us!""""Well, where is he?"" cried Jasper, whirling around to look in all directions; while Ben took a few long strides to peer around the station, and David and the other ""Harvard Fresh."" who had been invited to keep him company, ran, one up, and the other down, the long platform."
"""See here now,"" shouted old Mr. King so sharply that all the flying feet were arrested at once, ""every one of you come back! Goodness me, the idea of the Bedford party being scattered to the four winds in this fashion!""""Oh dear--dear!"" Polly was yet wailing. Then she remembered, and threw her arms around Phronsie who was standing quite still by her side. ""Phronsie, precious pet,"" and she picked up her pretty stuff gown to kneel on the platform-floor to look into the little face, ""don't feel badly, dear. Joel will come on the next train.""""Perhaps the train will be late,"" suggested Mrs. Dyce, who, as Mary Taylor, never could bear to see Phronsie unhappy. ""Hamilton, if you don't do something to help that child, I shall be sorry I married you,"" she whispered in her husband's ear.""Well, it may be our luck to have it late enough,"" said Jasper, with a glance at Polly, ""as it's Christmas day and a big train; so he may possibly get here--he'll find a cabby that can make good time,"" he added, with a forlorn attempt at comfort.""Here comes the train!"" cried Alexia. The warning bell struck, and the rush of travelers from the waiting-room, began. ""Oh dear me!"" Then she forgot all about her late unpleasantness with Pickering Dodge, and running up to him, she seized his arm, ""Oh, Pickering, do make the conductor wait for that horrid boy.""But no one could pretend, with any sort of success, that Joel wasn't missed; and Polly had all that she could do to chase away the sorrowful expression of Phronsie's little face. And everybody tried his and her best to make it as festive a time as possible; and the other passengers nudged one another, and sent many an envious glance at the merry party.""It's Mr. King's family going down to Bedford,"" said the conductor to one inquiring mind. ""I take 'em every year,"" proudly. ""He's powerful rich; but this ain't his affair. It all b'longs to that little girl with the big hat."" Then he dashed off, and called a station; and after the stopping and moving of the train again, he came back and sat on the arm of the seat to finish his account.""You see, there was an old lady, a cousin of the old gentleman's, and she made a will in favor of this child with the big hat."" The conductor pointed his thumb at Phronsie, leaning over Mr. King's shoulder, the better to hear a wonderful story he was concocting for her benefit. ""Why, she's got some two or three millions.""""Yes--the old lady was tough, but""--he dashed off again, called a station, slammed the door, and was back in position in less time than it takes to tell it--""she was took sudden, while Mr. King's folks was in Europe, and now that child has turned a handsome old place down yonder""--he pointed with his thumb in the direction of Bedford-- ""Dunraven Lodge, the old lady always called it, into a sort of a Home, and she's chucked it full of children, mostly those whose fathers and mothers are dead; and every Christmas Day Mr. King takes down a big crowd, and""--""Just like you,"" greeted Alexia, running down the broad oaken stairs. ""Here, he's come!"" to Polly, appearing at the head. ""We were finishing the tree, and we heard the noise. Dear me, Joe, I should think it was a cyclone,"" as she joined the group, Polly close behind."
"Joel felt well repaid for losing the jolly run down, and the grand _entree_ into Dunraven, his soul loved, but he covered up what he thought, by pulling Phronsie into the middle of the hall. ""Come on, Phron,"" he said, ""for a spin like old times.""At the mere mention of such a possibility as the Tree not being ready, everybody started; the last one in the procession, picking up the doll-box, their movements somewhat quickened, as loud calls were now set up above stairs, for ""Polly--Polly!""""Come on,"" sang out Joel, who had paid his respects in a flying fashion to Grandpapa's sofa, and leaping the stairs. ""Goodness me, Alexia, I should think you did spill this frost. Why didn't you go over more ground?""""I don't believe we can save one bit,"" mourned Alexia, peering up the stair-length, each step sparkling with myriad little frosty gems, as if Jack Frost himself had sprinkled it with a Christmas hand. ""Oh, dear, why did you come in with such a noise, Joe Pepper?""""Oh, Joe, don't stop; we want you for the Tree,"" begged Polly. ""Phronsie has been waiting downstairs all this time for you to come. Let one of the maids do it;"" Joe already had his head in a closet he knew of old, opening into the big hall.""I believe so,"" said Jack, laughing. ""Here, give me the broom. I'm no help about a Tree; I'll have the stuff up there soon,"" and before Joel knew it, he was racing over the back stairs, wondering how it was he had let that disagreeable Jack Loughead get hold of that broom.""It makes me think of our first Tree, in some way,"" said Polly softly, with glistening eyes, looking up at the beautiful branching spruce, its countless arms shaking out brilliant pendants, and gay with streamers and candles, wherever a decoration could be placed, the whole tipped with a shining star. ""Oh, Bensie, can you ever forget that?""""I wish you wouldn't begin about that Little Brown House, and what elegant times you had in it,"" exclaimed Alexia, twitching at a present Joel had just tied on, to be sure it was secure; ""I shall think this Tree is perfectly horrid, if you do, Polly Pepper.""""And weren't the gilt balls pretty?"" cried Polly, quite gone now in the reminiscences, though her fingers kept on at their task; ""you did cover those nuts beautifully, Bensie. I don't see how you could, with such snips of paper.""""Well, we all marched into the 'Provision Room,'"" went on Polly, her cheeks aglow, ""expecting to see our Tree just as we had left it; all but Ben, he was going to jump into the window at the right time, when the first thing""--""I couldn't help it, I was so surprised,"" said Polly, with shining eyes. ""There was a most beautiful Tree, full of just everything; and there was Mamsie, almost crying, she was so happy; and there was Cherry singing away in his cage, and the corner of the room was all a-bloom with flowers, and""--By this time, Alexia had dropped the present she was holding, and had run back to Polly's side again, and somehow most of the other workers followed her example, the circle of listeners closing around the little bunch of Peppers. ""And Jasper sent a Christmas greeting, beside the Tree,"" Polly ended, ""and it was perfectly lovely.""""Well, you would better take hold of hands and dance down to the recitation room,"" said Parson Henderson's deep voice, as he suddenly appeared in their midst, ""the children are all ready to give their carols. Come.""""Dear me, Phronsie,"" cried the old gentleman, whirling around in his big chair to look at her, ""why, they aren't all in, child,"" glancing down the aisle where Jasper as chief usher with Ben and the others were busily settling the children. ""Bless me, what is Joel doing?""Polly, who caught the last words, looked down reproachfully at him from the platform where Phronsie always insisted that she should sit close to her. ""Can't help it,"" Joel telegraphed back, ""I can't stop her crying."""
"""She wants to see me,"" said Phronsie, putting her cool cheek against the dark little one; ""it's the new child that came yesterday,"" and she took her off from Joel's shoulder, and staggered back to her seat by Polly's side.""Yes,"" said Phronsie, ""I've tied a big doll on it for you my very own self."" Then she put her lips on the dark little cheek. ""Now you must get down, for I have to talk to the children, and tell them all about things, and why they have a Christmas.""""Now you see, Joel,"" began old Mr. King harshly. Phronsie laid a soft hand on his arm. ""Please, Grandpapa dear, may she have a little cricket up here? She feels lonely down with the other children, for she's only just come.""Phronsie, having seated her burden on the cricket at her feet, got out of her own chair, and took one step toward the platform edge, beginning, ""Dear children."" But the small creature left behind clutched the floating hem of the white gown, and screamed harder than ever.""Bless me!"" ejaculated Mr. King in great distress. ""Here, will somebody take this child down where she belongs?"" While Polly with flushed cheeks, leaned over, and tried to unclasp the little black fingers.And before anybody quite knew how it was done, there was the new child sitting on her cricket, and huddled up against the soft folds of Phronsie's white gown, while Phronsie, standing close to the platform edge, began again, ""Dear children, you know this is Christmas Day--your very own Christmas Day. And every Christmas Day since you came to the Home, I have told you the story of the dear beautiful Lady; and every single Christmas I am going to tell it to you again, so that you will never, never forget her.""Here Phronsie turned, and pointed up to a large, full-length portrait of Mrs. Chatterton hanging on the wall over the platform. It was painted in her youth by a celebrated French artist, and represented a beautiful young woman in a yellow satin gown, whose rich folds of lace fell away from perfectly molded neck and arms.""Because without her I could not have had it,"" said Phronsie. ""You must always remember that, children. Now say it."" She stood very patiently, her hands folded together, and waited to hear them repeat it.""I thank her for the beautiful Tree,"" shouted the children, craning their necks away from the portrait to get a glimpse of the curtain-veiled Tree in the other room. ""Please can't we have it now?"" begged several voices.""No; not until you all hear the story. Well, now, God took the beautiful Lady away to Heaven; but she is always going to be here too,"" again Phronsie pointed to the portrait, ""just as long as there is any Home. And she is going to smile at you, because you are all going to be good children and try to study and learn all that dear Mr. Henderson teaches you; and you are going to obey every single thing that dear Mrs. Henderson tells you, just as soon as she speaks,"" said Phronsie slowly, and turning her head to look at the different rows.""I hope we'll be forgiven for sitting here and listening to old lady Chatterton's praises,"" whispered Mrs. Hamilton Dyce to her husband. ""It makes me feel dreadfully wicked to swallow it all without a protest."""
"""So on this Christmas Day,"" Phronsie was saying in clear tones, ""you are to remember that you wouldn't have had this Tree but for the beautiful Lady; and on every single other day, you must remember that you wouldn't ever have had this Home; not a bit of any of it""--here she turned and looked around the picture-hung walls, and out of the long windows to the dark pines and firs of the broad lawn, tossing their snow-laden branches, ""but for the beautiful lady. And you must every one of you help to make this Home just the very best Home that ever was. Will you?"" And then she smiled down into their faces while she waited for her answer.""And now you all want to thank Miss Phronsie for her kind words, we know,"" Jasper cried at this point, hurrying into the middle of the aisle, ""and so, children, you may all stand up and say 'Thank you,' and wave your handkerchiefs.""Up flew all the rows of children to their feet, and a cloud of tiny white squares of cambric fluttered in the air, and the children kept piping out, ""Thank you--Thank you."" And old Mr. King began a cheer for Phronsie, and another for the children; and then somebody down at the end of the long hall set up another for Mr. King, and somebody else started one for Mr. Henderson, and another for Mrs. Henderson, and there was plenty of noise, and high above it all rang the peals of happy, childish laughter. And when it was all done, everybody pausing to take breath, then Amy Loughead sent out the finest march ever heard, from the grand piano, and Polly and Jasper and all the rest marshaled the children into a procession, and Phronsie clinging to old Mr. King's hand on the one side, and holding fast to the small black palm on the other, away they all went, the visitors falling into line, around and around the big hall, till at last--oh! at last, they turned into the Enchanted Land that held the wonderful Christmas Tree. And when they were all before it, and Phronsie in the center, she lifted her hand, and the room became so still one could hear a pin drop. And then the little children who had sung the carols in the morning stepped forward and began, ""It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old""--And then Jasper and the others slowly drew aside the white curtain; and oh! the dazzling, beautiful apparition that greeted every one's eyes! No one could stop the children's noisy delight, and the best of it was, that no one wanted to. So for the next few moments it was exactly like the merry time over the Tree in the ""Provision Room"" of the Little Brown House years ago, just as Polly had said; only there was ever so much more of it, because there were ever so many more children to make it!And Polly and Ben were like children again themselves; and David and Joel were everywhere helping on the fun; in which excitement the other Harvard man and even Livingston Bayley were not ashamed to take a most active part, as Jasper, who had borrowed Santa Claus' attire for this occasion, now made his appearance with a most astonishing bow. And then the presents began to fly from the Tree, and Jack Loughead seemed to be all arms, for he was so tall he could reach down the hanging gifts from the higher branches, so that he was in great demand; and Pickering Dodge, one eye on all of Polly's movements, worked furiously, and Alexia Rhys and Cathie Harrison didn't give themselves hardly time to breathe; and there was quite enough for Mr. Alstyne and the Cabots and Hamilton Dyce to do, and everybody else, for that matter, to pass around the presents. And in the midst of it all, a big doll, resplendent in a red satin gown, and an astonishing hat, was untied from the tree.""Susan, this is your very own child,"" said Phronsie, turning to the little colored girl at her side. ""Now you won't feel lonely ever, will you?"" and she laid the doll carefully into the outstretched arms.""Grandpapa,"" cried Polly, coming up to old Mr. King and Phronsie, with a basket of mottoes and bonbons enough to satisfy the demands of the most exacting Children's Home, ""we ought to get our paper caps on.""""Bless me!"" ejaculated old Mr. King, pulling out his watch, ""it can't be time to march. Ah, it's a quarter of four this minute. Here, child,"" to Phronsie, ""pick out your bonbon so that I can snap it with you.""Phronsie gravely regarded the pretty bonbons in Polly's basket. ""I must pick out yours first, Grandpapa,"" she said slowly, lifting a silver paper-and-lace arrangement with a bunch of forget-me-nots in the center. ""I think this is pretty.""""So it is; most beautiful, dear,"" said the old gentleman, in great satisfaction. ""Now we must crack it, I suppose."" So he took hold of one end, and Phronsie held fast to the other of the bonbon, and a sharp little report gave the signal for all the bonbons to be opened. Thereupon, everybody, old and young, hurried to secure one, and great was the snapping and cracking that now followed."
"""Oh, Grandpapa, isn't your cap pretty?"" exclaimed Phronsie in pleased surprise, drawing forth a pink and yellow crinkled tissue bit. ""See,"" smoothing it out with a gentle hand, ""it's a crown, Grandpapa!""""It is so very nice, dear Grandpapa,"" she said, coming back to his side. So old Mr. King stood up, with quite a regal air, and Phronsie had a little blue and white paper bonnet tied under her chin by Grandpapa's own hand. And caps were flying on to all the heads, and each right hand held a tinkling little bell that had swung right merrily on a green branch-tip. And away to Amy Loughead's second march--on and on, jangling their bells, the procession went, through the long hall, till old Mr. King and Phronsie who led, turned down the broad staircase, and into the dining-room; and here the guests stood on either side of the doorway while the little Home children passed up through their midst.And there were two long tables, one for the Home children, with a place for Phronsie at its head, and another for old Mr. King at the foot. And the other table was for the older people; both gay with Christmas holly, and sweet with flowers. And when all were seated, and a hush fell upon the big room, Phronsie lifted her hand.Oh, this Christmas feast at Dunraven! It surpassed all the other Dunraven Christmases on record; everybody said so. And at last, when no one could possibly eat more, all the merry roomful, young and old, must have a holly sprig fastened to the coat, or gown, or apron, and the procession was formed to march back to the hall; and Mr. Jack Loughead's stereopticon flashed out the most beautiful pictures, that his bright descriptions explained to the delighted children; and then games and romps, and more bonbons, and favors and flowers; and at last the sleighs and barges for Mr. King's party were drawn up in the moonlight, at the door of Dunraven, and the Christmas at the Home was only a beautiful memory.""Why, I don't understand,"" began Polly, in the midst of trying to make Phronsie see that it was not necessary to go back and comfort Susan with another good-by, and turning a bewildered face up at him.""Oh, no, no,"" cried Polly hastily, ""if you really thought I promised you, Mr. Bayley, I will go, thank you,"" and without a backward glance at the others, she moved off to the gay little cutter where the horse stood shaking his bells impatiently.Polly kept saying to herself, ""Oh, dear, dear, what could I have said to make him think I would go with him?"" And Livingston Bayley smiled happily to himself under the collar of his driving coat; and the sparkling snow cut into little crystals by the horse's flying feet, dashed into their faces, and the scraps of laughter and merry nonsense from the other sleighs, made Polly want nothing so much as to cower down into the corner of the big fur robes, for a good cry.""This is a vastly better road,"" said Mr. Bayley, and instead of turning back, he flicked the horse lightly with his whip. ""You'll say, Miss Mary, that it's much better this way."" He tried to laugh. ""Isn't the sleighing superb?""""Oh, yes--oh dear me!"" cried poor Polly, straining her eyes to catch a sight of the last vehicle with its merry load. ""Indeed, Mr. Bayley, I'm afraid we sha'n't get to the depot in time. There may be drifts on this road, or something to delay us.""""Oh, no, indeed!"" cried Livingston Bayley confidently, now smiling again at his forethought in driving over this very identical piece of roadway, when the preparations for the Christmas festivity were keeping all the other people busy at Dunraven, and leaving him free to provide himself with sleighing facilities for the evening. ""Don't be troubled, I know all about it; I assure you, Miss Mary, we shall reach the depot as soon as the rest of the party do, for it's really a shorter cut.""Still Polly peered into the unbroken whiteness of the thoroughfare, lined by the snow-laden pines and spruces, all inextricably mixed as the sleigh spun by. It was too late to turn back now, she knew; the best that could be done, was to hurry on--and she began to count the hoof-beats and to speculate how long it would be before they would see the lights of the little station, and find the lost party again."
"""I might have spoken to a great many other girls,"" Livingston Bayley was saying, ""and I really don't know why I didn't choose one of them. Another man in my place would, and you must do me the justice to acknowledge it; 'pon me word, you must, Miss Mary.""Polly tore off her gaze from the snowy fields where the branches of the trees were making little zigzag paths in the moonlight, to fasten it on as much of his face as was visible between his cap and his high collar.""And I really shouldn't think you would play with me,"" declared Mr. Bayley, nervously fingering the whip-handle, ""I shouldn't, don't you know, because you are not the sort of girl to do that thing. 'Pon me word, you're not, Miss Mary.""""And I've done what no other fellow would, I'm sure,"" he said incoherently, ""in my place, kept constant, don't you know, to one idea. Been with other girls, of course, but only really made up my mind to marry you. 'Pon me word, I didn't, Miss Mary.""""And you've brought me out, away from the rest of the party, to tell me this,"" exclaimed Polly, springing forward to sit erect with flashing eyes. ""How good of you, Mr. Bayley, to announce your intention to marry me.""""You can't blame me,"" cried Mr. Bayley in an injured way. ""That cad of a Loughead means to speak soon--'pon me word, the fellow does. And I've never changed my mind about it since I made it up, even when you began to give music lessons.""""Don't put it that way,"" he began deprecatingly. ""I couldn't help it, don't you know, for I liked you awfully from the first, and always intended to marry you. You shall have everything in the world that you want, and go everywhere. And my family, you know, has an _entree_ to any society that's worth anything.""""I wouldn't marry you,"" cried Polly stormily, ""if you could give me all the gold in the world; and as for family,"" here she sat quite erect with shining eyes, ""the Peppers have always been the loveliest people that ever lived--the very loveliest--oh""--she broke off suddenly, starting forward--""there's something on the road; see, Mr. Bayley!""And spinning along, the horse now making up his mind to get to the depot in time, they both saw a big wagon out of which protruded two or three bags evidently containing apples and potatoes; one of the wheels determining to perform no more service for its master, was resting independently on the snowy thoroughfare, for horse and driver were gone.But this was not so easy a matter; for the farmer's wagon had stopped in the narrowest part of the road, either side shelving off, under its treacherous covering of snow. At last, after all sorts of ineffectual attempts on Mr. Bayley's part to induce the horse to stir a step, Polly desperately laid her hand on the bridle. ""Let me try,"" she said. ""There, you good creature,"" patting the horse's nose; ""come, that's a dear old fellow,"" and they never knew quite how, but in the course of time, they were all on the other side of the wreck, and Mr. Livingston Bayley was helping her into the sleigh, and showering her with profuse apologies for the whole thing.And presently a swift turn brought the twinkling lights of the little station to view, and there was the entire party calling to them as they now spied their approach, to ""Hurry up!"" and there also was the train, holding its breath in curbed impatience to be off.""Dear me!"" exclaimed Polly, turning off in dismay, ""it seems so--so unfair to Mr. Bayley. Mightn't it be just as if he hadn't spoken, Mamsie?"" She came back now to her mother's side, and looked anxiously into the black eyes."
"""Oh! I don't--I couldn't ever in all this world keep anything from Father Fisher,"" declared Polly vehemently, ""only,"" and the color flew in rosy waves over her face, ""this doesn't seem like my secret, Mamsie. And Mr. Bayley would feel so badly to have it known,"" and her head drooped.Mrs. Fisher's lip curled. ""No more do I like it,"" she said curtly. ""In the first place to speak to you at all; and then to take such a way to do it; it wasn't a nice thing at all, child, for Mr. Bayley to do,"" here Mrs. Fisher walked to the window, her irritation getting the better of her, so that Polly might not see her face.""He should have spoken to your father or to Mr. King,"" said Mrs. Fisher, coming back to face Polly, ""but I presume the young man didn't know any better, or at least, he didn't think, and that's enough to say about that. But as for not telling Mr. King about it, why, it isn't to be thought of for a minute. So I best have it over with at once."" And with a reassuring smile at Polly she went out, and closed the door.""Oh, dear me,"" cried poor Polly, left alone; and springing out of her chair, she began to pace the floor. ""Now it will be perfectly dreadful for Mr. Bayley. Grandpapa will be very angry; he never liked him; and now he can't help showing what he feels. Oh! why did Mr. Bayley speak.""For the room grew suddenly so dark to her that she wavered and would have fallen had he not caught her. ""I won't faint,"" she cried, ""Jasper, don't be afraid. There, I'm all right. Now, oh, what can I do?""For the second time, everything seemed to turn black before her eyes, but Polly said bravely, ""Yes, I'll go, Jasper."" And presently, they hardly knew how, the two found themselves at old Mr. King's door.The old gentleman was walking up and down his apartment, fuming at every step. ""The presumption of the fellow! How did he dare without speaking to me! Oh, eh, Polly""--and then he caught sight of Jasper, back of her.""Dear Grandpapa,"" cried Polly, going unsteadily to the old gentleman's side, and taking his hand in both of hers. ""Oh, we must tell you something very bad, and we don't know how to tell it, Grandpapa."" She looked up piteously into his face.""No questions are to be asked, Jasper,"" said his father. ""Be so good as to see that Philip packs quickly, and that you are ready. And now, Polly,"" the old gentleman turned to her, ""I want to take you along, child, if your mother is willing. Will you go?"""
"""If that isn't perfectly dreadful,"" cried Alexia Rhys, throwing her muff into a chair, and herself on an ottoman. ""Why, we were going to make up a theater party for to-morrow night. Mrs. Fisher, and now Polly is gone.""""And there is her Recital--what will she do about that?"" cried Alexia, rushing on in her complaint. ""Perhaps she'll give it up, after all,"" she added, brightening. ""Now I most know she will, Mrs. Fisher,"" and she started up and began to pirouette around the room.""Of course she has had to postpone it,"" said Mrs. Fisher, looking after her, ""and she told Joel to write the notes to the pupils explaining matters. But never you fear, Alexia, that Polly will give up that Recital for good and all,"" she added, with a wise nod at her.""Come on, girls,"" said Alexia, rushing on. ""Now that's what I admire Mrs. Fisher for,"" she said, when they were well in the hall, ""she shows when she's not pleased, and when she likes what a body does, as well.""Joel sat back of the writing table, a mass of Polly's note paper and envelopes sprawled before him, his head on his hands and his elbows on the table. Back of him paced Pickering Dodge with a worried expression of countenance.""I'll help you clear the table,"" cried Pickering; ""do let me. I can't write those notes, but I can get the place ready;"" and he began to pile the books on a chair. As he went around to Alexia's place she looked up and fixed her gaze past him, not noticing his attempt to speak.Alexia made an uneasy gesture, scrawled two or three words, then threw down her pen and got out of her chair. ""It's no use,"" she cried, running up to Pickering, who, his hands in his pockets, had his back to them all, and was looking out of the window. ""I can't let myself do anything till I've said I'm sorry I was so cross,"" and she put out her hand.""And I'm glad enough to have it made up,"" declared Pickering decidedly. ""It's bad enough to have so much trouble in the world, without getting into fights with people you've known ever since you can remember.""""Well, just let me kiss you, dear, then,"" said Mrs. Whitney with a wan little smile. ""Oh, Polly,"" when the kiss and two or three others had been dropped on the rosy cheek, ""you are sure you can stay with me?""""You are a dear blessed comfort, Polly,"" said Mrs. Whitney, turning on her pillow with a sigh of relief. ""Now I do believe I shall get up very soon. But Jasper must go back; it won't do for him to stay away any longer from his business. Promise me, Polly, that you will make him see that he ought to go.""""Oh, I am a relation,"" said the girl coolly, ""and I told the man at the door that I should come in; and he said then I must wait, for I could not see Mr. King now, and he put me up in that little reception room, but I just walked out to meet the first person coming in the hall. Will you be so kind as to arrange it?""""I'll see,"" said Polly, who couldn't help smiling, ""what I can do for you; but you mustn't be disappointed if Grandpapa doesn't feel able to see you. He is very much occupied, you know, with his daughter's ill""--"
"""Yes, sir; and my father is very ill."" For a moment her voice trembled, but she quickly recovered herself. ""It isn't money I want, Mr. King,"" and she threw her head back proudly, ""but oh, will you come and see father?""Mr. King looked at her again, then over at Polly. ""Bring her in here,"" he said, pointing to the same little reception room that Charlotte had deserted, ""I want you to stay, too, Polly,"" and the door closed upon them.""She'll be no end of bother to you, I know,"" said Jasper. ""And you must take her everywhere, Polly, and look out for her. What was father thinking of?"" He could not conceal his annoyance, and Polly put aside her own dismayed feelings at the new programme, to help him into his usual serene mood.""But he's sick because he has worried so, I do believe,"" Polly went on, ""for you ought to have seen his face when we took Charlotte home, and Grandpapa talked with him, and asked him to let Charlotte pass the rest of the winter with us. Oh, I am glad, Jasper, for I do like Charlotte.""""Never mind,"" said Polly brightly, with a little pang at her heart for the nice times with the girls that now must be shared with another. ""Grandpapa thought he ought to do it, I suppose, and that's enough.""""Perhaps we sha'n't want to,"" said Polly merrily, ""for Charlotte may turn out perfectly lovely; I do believe she's going to."" And then she remembered her promise to Mrs. Whitney, and she began: ""Aunty is worrying about your staying away so long from your business, Jasper, and she wants you to go back.""A shade passed over his face. ""I suppose I ought to go, Polly,"" he said, and he pulled a letter from his pocket and held it out to her, ""I was going to show this to you, only the other matter came up.""""We need your services very much"" [the letter ran] ""and cannot wait longer for your return. We are very sorry to be so imperative, but the rush of work at this time of the year, makes it necessary for all our force to be in place.""You see they are getting all the books planned out, and put in shape for the next year; and business just rushes,"" cried Jasper, with shining eyes, showing his eagerness to be in the midst of the bustle of manufacture.""Well, you see the business of selling is a good part of it done by salesmen, who travel with samples and take advance orders,"" said Jasper, finding it quite jolly to explain business intricacies to such an eager listener.""And when I get back I shall be plunged at once into all the thick of the manufacturing work,"" he went on, straightening himself up; ""Mr. Marlowe is as good as he can be, and he has waited now longer than he ought to.""""Yes--yes, I do,"" declared Polly. ""Doctor Palfrey said this morning that all danger was over now from inflammation, and really it worries her dreadfully to think of your being here any longer. It really does hurt her, Jasper,"" repeated Polly emphatically.""See here, Jasper,"" said Mr. Whitney, happening along at this minute, ""here's a nice piece of work. Percy declares that he shall be made miserable to go back to college to-morrow. His mother is able now for him to be settled at his studies; won't you run up and persuade him--that's a good fellow.""""Now you see how much better I'm off,"" observed Van, coming in to perch on the edge of the bed while Percy was hurrying all sorts of garments into the trunk with a quick hand. ""I tell you, Percy, I struck good luck when I chose father's business. Now I don't have to run like a dog at the beck of a lot of professors."""
"""No, you'd rather sit up with your glasses stuck on your nose, and learn how to dole out the law; that's you, Percy. I say, I wouldn't try to keep the things on,"" with a laugh as he saw his brother's ineffectual efforts to pack, and yet give the attention to his eyeglasses that they seemed to demand.Van opened his mouth to toss back a teasing reply, when Percy opened up on him. ""I'd as soon take my chances with her, on the suppers and other things, as to have yours. What would Polly say to see you going for me like this, I'd like to know?""That evening Jasper and Percy, who went together for a good part of the way, had just driven to the station, when the bell rang and a housemaid presently laid before Polly a card, at sight of which all the color deserted her cheek. ""Oh, I can't see him,"" she declared involuntarily.""Humph! well, upon my word, this speaks well for the young man's perseverance. I'm very tired, but I see nothing for it but that I must respond to this;"" and he threw aside the paper and got up to his feet.""Well, then, child, you must leave me to settle with him,"" said the old gentleman with dignity. ""Don't worry; I sha'n't forget myself, nor what is due to a Bayley,"" with a short laugh. And then she heard him go into the drawing-room and close the door.""Well, Polly, child, I don't believe he will trouble you in this way again, my dear,"" he said in a satisfied way, looking at her over the table. ""He wanted to leave the question open; thought it impossible that you could refuse him utterly, and was willing to wait; and asked permission to send flowers, and all that sort of thing. But I made the young man see exactly how the matter stood, and that's all that need be said about it. It's done with now and forever."" And then he took up his paper and began to read.""Mamsie,"" said Phronsie, that very evening as she was getting ready for bed, and pausing in the doorway of her little room that led out of Mother Fisher's, ""do you suppose we can bear it another day without Polly?""""Why, yes, Phronsie,"" said Mother Fisher, giving another gentle rock to Baby's cradle, ""of course we can, because we must. That isn't like you, dear, to want Polly back till Aunty has got through needing her.""""And now maybe God will let Grandpapa and Polly come back pretty soon,"" said Phronsie slowly, going off toward her own little room. And presently Mrs. Fisher heard her say, ""Good-night, Mamsie dear, I'm in bed.""And in another minute in rushed the little doctor, seized his medicine case, saying as he did so, ""I sha'n't come back here, wife, if it is diphtheria, but go to my office and change my clothes. There's considerable of the disease around. Good-night, child."" He stopped to kiss Phronsie, who lifted a pale, troubled face to his. ""Don't worry; I guess Helen will be all right,"" and he dashed off again.""But he wouldn't ever do it, I know,"" said Phronsie confidently; ""I'm going to ask Him not to, and tell Him over again about Helen's being the very only one that Mrs. Fargo has in all the world."" So she slipped to the floor, and went into her own room again and closed the door. ""Dear Jesus,"" she said, kneeling by her little white bed, ""please don't take Helen away, because her mother has only just Helen. And please make dear papa give her the right things, so that she will live at home, and not go to Heaven yet. Amen."""
"""Everything is beautiful, King dear,"" she would say on such little flying visits to the nursery. ""Grandpapa and Polly, I do think, will be home pretty soon; and Helen is going to get well, because you know I asked God to let her, and he wouldn't ever, in all this world, take her away from her mother. He wouldn't, King,"" she added confidentially in Baby's small ear.All day long the turreted Fargo mansion gleamed brightly in the glancing sunlight, giving no hint of the battle for a life going on within. Mrs. Fisher knew when her husband sent for the most celebrated doctor for throat diseases; knew when he came; and knew also when each hour those who were fighting the foe, were driven back baffled. And several times she attempted to tell Phronsie something of the shadow hanging over the little playmate's home. But Phronsie invariably put aside all her attempts with a gentle persistence, always saying, ""He wouldn't, you know, Mamsie.""""The light is out, Mamsie,"" she called, ""in Helen's room. But I suppose she is asleep."" And presently Mrs. Fisher, stealing in, with unshed tears in her eyes, found her own child safe--folded in restful slumber, her hand tucked under her cheek.And all that day she said nothing; even when Mother Fisher begged her to come and talk it over with her, Phronsie would say, ""I can't, Mamsie dear, it won't talk itself."" But she was gentle and sweet with Baby, and never relaxed any effort for his amusement. And at last, when they were folding Helen away lovingly in flowers, from all who had loved her, Mrs. Fisher wrote in despair to Polly, telling her all about it, and adding, ""You must come home, if only for a few days, or Phronsie will be sick.""And Polly had nothing for it but to help him off, and Charlotte's father being ever so much better, she joined them; and as soon as it was a possible thing, there they were at home, and Thomas was driving them up at his best speed, to the carriage porch.""Well, we mustn't forget Charlotte,"" cried Polly, darting back to a tall girl with light hair and very pale blue eyes, standing composedly in one corner of the hall, and watching the whole thing closely. ""Mamsie, dear, here she is,"" taking her hand to draw her to Mrs. Fisher.""Now, then, Phronsie,"" she said, gathering her up close in her arms, ""tell me all about it, Pet. Just think,"" and Polly set warm kisses on the pale little cheek, ""how long it is since you and I have had a good talk.""Phronsie sat quite still, and folded and unfolded her hands in her lap. ""Why did God take away Helen?"" she asked suddenly, lifting her head. ""Oh, Polly, it wasn't nice of him,"" she added, a strange look coming into her brown eyes.""Phronsie""--cried Polly; then she stopped abruptly. ""Oh, what can I say? I don't know, dearie; it's just this way; we don't know why God does things. But we love him, and we feel it's right. Oh, Phronsie, don't look so. There, there,"" and she drew her close to her, in a loving, hungry clasp. ""I told you I didn't think I could say the right things to you,"" she went on hurriedly, ""but, Phronsie, I know God did just right in taking Helen to heaven. Just think how beautiful it must be there, and so many little children are there. And Helen is so happy. Oh, Phronsie, when I think of that, I am glad she is gone."""
"Polly drew a long breath, and shut her lips. ""But, Phronsie, don't you see,"" she cried presently, ""it may be that Mrs. Fargo wouldn't ever want to go to Heaven unless Helen was there to meet her? It may be, Phronsie; and that would be very dreadful, you know. And God loved Mrs. Fargo so that he took Helen, and he is going to keep her happy every single minute while she is waiting and getting ready for her mother.""""Yes, dear,"" said Polly, ""I think it is, Phronsie,"" and her cheeks glowed. ""Oh, can't you see how much nicer it is in God to make Mrs. Fargo happy for always with Helen, instead of just a little bit of a while down here?""Phronsie went over to the window and looked up at the winter sky. ""It is a long way off,"" she said, but the bitter tone had gone, and it was a grieved little voice that added, ""and Mrs. Fargo can't see Helen.""""Well, you can write her little notes and you can help her to see that God did just right in taking Helen away,"" said Polly; ""and that would be the very best thing you could do, Phronsie, for Mrs. Fargo; the very loveliest thing in all this world.""""I really and truly do, Phronsie,"" said Polly softly. Then she leaned over and threw both arms around Phronsie's neck. ""Oh, Phronsie, can't you see--I never thought of it till now--but He has given you somebody else instead of Helen, to love and to do things for?""""There's Charlotte,"" cried Polly, going on rapidly as she released Phronsie. ""Oh, Phronsie, you can't think; it's been dreadfully hard and dull always for her at home, with those two stiff great-aunts pecking at her.""""You see,"" began Polly, ""Charlotte's mother has always been too ill to have nice times; she couldn't go out, you know, very much, nor keep the house, and so the two great-aunts came to live with them. Well, pretty soon they began to feel as if they owned the house, and Charlotte, and everybody in it.""""And Charlotte's father, Mr. Alexander Chatterton, couldn't stop it; and beside, he was away on business most of the time, and Charlotte didn't complain--oh, she behaved very nice about it; Phronsie, her father told Grandpapa all about it; and by and by her mother died, and then things got worse and worse; but Mr. Chatterton never knew half how bad it was. But when he was sick it all came out, and it worried him so that he got very bad indeed, and then he sent for Grandpapa--Charlotte couldn't stop him; he made her go. You see he was afraid he was going to die, and he couldn't bear to have things so very dreadful for Charlotte.""""Oh no, indeed! he was almost well when we came away; it was only his worrying over Charlotte that made him so bad. Oh, you ought to have seen him, Phronsie, when Grandpapa offered to take Charlotte home with us for the winter. He was so happy he almost cried.""""Oh, girls--girls!"" she suddenly screamed, and jumping up, nearly oversetting Polly, she raced over the remaining stairs to the bottom, where she danced up and down the wide hall, ""Polly isn't going back--she isn't--she isn't,"" she kept declaring.""Well, yes, I know all you would say, Polly. But I've also had a letter from Mason, and I was just going to show it to you."" He pulled out of his vest pocket another envelope corresponding to the one in Polly's hand, which he waved at her.Polly didn't hear a word, for she was reading busily: ""Marian says 'don't let Polly come back on any account. It worries me dreadfully to think of all that she is giving up; and I will be brave, and do without her. She must not come back.'"""
"""Yes. Now this is good to see you!"" exclaimed Jasper, joyfully leaping from his chair to seize Pickering's hand. ""Well, what brought you? There's nothing wrong?"" he asked, anxiously scanning Pickering's face.""No, she's all right, only""--Pickering turned impatiently off from the chair Jasper pulled forward with a hasty hand, and stalked to the other side of the little room. ""She's--she's--well, she's so hard to come at nowadays. Everybody has a chance for a word with her but old friends. And now the Recital is in full blast.""""I believe so,"" said Pickering in a gloomy way. ""The girls are wild over it; you can't hear anything else talked about at home. But,"" he broke off abruptly, ""got a cigar, Jasper?"" and he began to hunt the mantel among the few home-things spread around to enliven the hotel apartment.""I forgot you don't smoke,"" said Pickering with a sigh. ""Dear me! how will you bear trouble when it comes, old chap?"" He came back to the table, and thrust his hands in his pockets, looking dismally at Jasper.""He's a gentleman,"" observed Buttons, on the way downstairs, Pickering treading his heels. ""He ain't like the rest of 'em that boards here. They orders me around with a 'Here, you!' or a 'Hoi, there, boy!' They're gents; he's the whole word--a first-class gentleman, Mr. King is,"" he repeated.Whew--puff! floated the rings of cigar smoke over Pickering's head. ""And I can't stand it, and I won't, waiting any longer to tell her so. Why, man,"" he turned savagely now on Jasper, ""I've loved her for years, and must I be bullied and badgered out of my rights by men who have only just been introduced to her--say?""""Yes, 'tis,"" declared Pickering, nodding again, ""and I don't like it. You know as well as I do,"" squaring around on Jasper, ""that he don't care a rap about his sister's getting on; he's only thinking of Polly, and _I_ love her.""""Yes. You've got to help me. I can't stand it, waiting around any longer. It has almost killed me as it is."" Pickering threw his head on the chair-back and took savage pulls at the cigar between his teeth."
"""Why, you can tell Polly how it is; you're her brother, or as good as one; and she'll see it from you. And you must hurry about it, too, for I expect that Loughead will turn up soon. He means mischief, he does.""""See here, Pick,"" cried Jasper, getting out of his chair hastily to face Pickering, ""you don't know what you are asking. Why, I couldn't do it. The very idea; I never heard of such a thing! You--you must speak to Polly yourself.""""I can't,"" said Pickering, in a burst, and bringing up his head suddenly. ""She won't give me the ghost of a chance. There's always those girls around her; and she's been away an age at Mrs. Whitney's. And everlastingly somebody is sick or getting hurt, and they won't have anybody but Polly. You know how it is yourself, Jasper,"" and he turned on him an injured countenance.""Well, don't come to me,"" cried Jasper, beginning to pace the floor irritably. ""I couldn't ever speak on such a subject to Polly. Beside it would be the very way to set her against you. It would any girl; can't you see it, Pick?"" he added, brightening up.""Oh, somebody in the establishment, I don't know who, had a finger-ache, I suppose,"" said Pickering, carelessly throwing away his cigar end and lighting a fresh one, ""and wanted Polly. Never mind why; she couldn't come down, she sent word. So I gave up in despair. See here now, Jasper, you must help me out.""""Well, there's a great end of our friendship,"" exclaimed Pickering, red with anger, and he jumped to his feet. ""Do you mean to say, Jasper King, that you won't do such a simple thing for me as to say a word to your sister Polly, when I tell you it's all up with me if you don't speak that word--say?""""You oughtn't to ask such a thing; it's despicable in you,"" cried Jasper, aghast to find his anger rising at each word. ""And if you insist in making such a request when I tell you that I cannot speak to Polly for you, why, I shall be forced to repeat what I said at first, that I won't have anything to do with it.""""Well, what is it?"" asked Miss Salisbury, settling her glasses for a look at her former pupil. ""You mustn't hinder me; I'm on my way to the recitation room,"" and her hand made a movement toward her watch.""If Polly Pepper needs me in any way, why, I must stop,"" said the principal of the ""Young Ladies' Select Boarding and Day School,"" ""but I don't see how she can need me, Alexia,"" she added in perplexity, ""Polly is fully capable of taking care of herself.""""I am quite at a loss to guess,"" said Miss Salisbury calmly, ""and I must say, Alexia, I am very much pained by your failure to profit by my instructions. To think that one of my young ladies, especially one on whom I have spent so much care and attention as yourself, should be so careless in speech and manner, as you are constantly. 'Gone and done'--oh, Alexia!"" she exclaimed in a grieved way."
"""Oh, I know,"" cried Alexia imperturbably, ""you did your best, dear Miss Salisbury, and it isn't your fault that I'm not fine. But oh, don't waste the time, please, over me, when I want to tell you about Polly.""""What is it about Polly?"" demanded Miss Salisbury, fingering her watch-chain nervously. ""Really, Alexia, I think Polly would do very well if you didn't try so hard to take possession of her. I quite pity her,"" she added frankly.Alexia burst into a laugh. ""It's the only way to catch a glimpse of her. Miss Salisbury,"" she cried, ""for everybody is trying to take possession of Polly Pepper. And now--oh, it's getting perfectly dreadful!""""Oh, Miss Salisbury,"" cried Alexia in alarm, ""wait just a minute, do, dear Miss Salisbury,"" she cried, throwing her arms around her, thereby endangering the glasses set upon the fine Roman nose, ""there can't any one help in this but just you.""""I know it,"" cried Alexia penitently, ""you've just been a dear, always, Miss Salisbury, to me. If you hadn't, why, I don't know what I should have done, for I had nobody but aunt,"" with a little pathetic sniff, ""to look after me.""""My dear Alexia,"" cried Miss Salisbury, quite softened, ""don't feel so. You are very dear to me. You always were,"" patting her hand. ""And so what is it that you want to tell me now? Pray be quick, dear.""""Well, Polly is just hateful to herself,"" declared Alexia, ""and if it wasn't for us girls, she'd--oh, dear me! I don't know what would happen. What do you suppose, Miss Salisbury, she's gone and--oh dear, I didn't mean to--but what do you suppose Polly has just done?""Before Miss Salisbury could reply, Alexia rushed on frantically. ""If you'll believe me, Polly has gone and asked that Charlotte Chatterton to sing at her Recital; just think of that!"" exclaimed Alexia, quite gone at the enormity of such a blunder.""Oh, frightfully well,"" said Alexia, ""that's just the trouble. And now Polly's Recital will all be part of that Chatterton girl's glory. And it was to be so swell!"" And Alexia sank into a chair, and waved back and forth in grief.""And now you won't make Polly see that Charlotte Chatterton ought not to be stuck into that Recital?"" cried Alexia wildly. ""Oh, dear me! and you are the only one that can bring Polly to her senses--oh, dear me!"""
"""I didn't--that is, I'm sorry,"" said Cathie. ""But, anyway, I want to say I ought to have been ashamed to act so about that Chatterton girl. Where should I have been if Polly Pepper hadn't taken me up?""She looked down the long aisle to a seat in the corner. ""There's where I sat,"" pointing to it, ""and you all know it, for a whole week, and I thought I should die; I did,"" tragically, ""without any one speaking to me. And one day Polly Pepper came up and asked wouldn't I come to her house to the Bee you were all going to get up to fit out that horrible old poor white family down South. And I wanted to get up and scream, I was so glad.""""And I suppose we must be nice to that Chatterton girl now, if she does break up our fun,"" said Alexia with a sigh, getting out of her chair. ""Come on, girls; let us go and tell Polly it's just heavenly that Charlotte is to sing.""""Now remember, girls,"" cried Alexia, rushing at the toilet table to bestow frantic twitches at the fluffy waves of hair over her forehead, ""that we must applaud the very minute that she gets through singing. Oh dear me, just look at my bangs; they are perfect frights. Hateful things!"" with another pull at the offending locks.""The idea!"" exclaimed Alexia, with an injured expression, ""when I never have my own way. Why, I give up and give up the whole time to somebody. Well, never mind; let's talk about the Recital. Oh, it's going to be quite elegant for Polly Pepper. There's a regular society cram in the Hall.""""I was down at Dunraven at the Christmas splurge,"" said Alexia, ""and you were not, Clem. That's all I shall say,"" and she leisurely disposed herself in a big chair, and began to draw on her gloves, with the air of one who could reveal volumes were she so disposed.""I should think the shock of being asked to enter that family, would kill any girl, to begin with,"" said Clem. ""Why, he goes back to William the Conqueror, doesn't he? And there's an earl in the family, and I don't know what else. And then beside, there's his mother; the idea of sitting opposite to her at the table every single day--oh dear me! I know I should drop my knife and fork and things, from pure fright.""""You weren't with us when we promised, my dear,"" answered Alexia, ""and I'll rise and explain. You see we don't any of us like that Charlotte Chatterton; not a single one of us. She's a perfect stick, I think.""""So do I,"" said another girl; ""this is the way she walks."" Thereupon followed a representation given to the life, of Charlotte Chatterton's method of getting her long figure over the ground, which brought subdued peals of laughter from the girls looking on."
"""And she has no more feeling than an oyster,"" pursued Alexia, when she had recovered her breath, ""or she might see that Polly was just giving up all her fun and ours too, by dragging her into everything that is going on.""""It's bad enough to be called an oyster, without having old sponge fastened to one,"" said Sally Moore, coming away from the mirror, thereby occasioning another rush for that useful dressing-room appointment.""Well, she is both of those very things,"" declared Alexia, ""nevertheless we must applaud her dreadfully when she's finished singing. That's what we promised each other, Frances. It will please Polly, you know.""""Your hands are just as cold as ice,"" said Polly, gathering up Amy's shaking little palms into her own. ""There now, we'll see if we can't coax them into playing order,"" rubbing them between her own warm ones.""I am so sorry that I cannot keep my engagement to play the duet with Miss Porter, but the doctor has just been here, and he says I must not go out. I should have written this morning that I had a sore throat, but I thought I could manage to go. I'm so sorry--oh, Miss Pepper, I'm so sorry!""I may be a stick, and an oyster, and an old sponge, and everybody wish me out of the way, but I'm not such a villain as to bother her now by telling her I won't sing. If they only won't applaud!"" She shut her teeth tightly, and turned back again.""I do not seem to teach you successfully,"" said Polly very slowly, ""so it would be no use to continue the lessons."" And she put aside the clinging hands. ""You may stay here, Amy; I am coming, Ben,"" looking over at him.""I'll play,"" cried Amy Loughead desperately. ""I'd rather, oh, dear me, if they were bears and gorillas looking on--and I just know I shall die--but I'd rather, Miss Pepper, than to have you give me up.""Charlotte clasped her hands tightly together so that an ominous rent appeared in one of her pretty gloves. ""I'll sing,"" she kept saying to herself all the way out to the platform, ""oh, I'll sing--I'll sing."" And later on, while looking down into the eyes of the girls waiting to applaud, ""I'll sing--I'll sing,"" she had to declare to herself till her name was announced.Polly, looking down into Jasper's face, saw him smile over to his father, and nod in a pleased surprise; and she was aghast to feel a faint little wish begin to grow in her heart, that Charlotte Chatterton had not been asked to sing.""Of course Jasper is surprised, as he has never heard her sing,"" said Polly to herself, ""and her voice is so beautiful in this big hall, oh, it's so very beautiful!"" as Charlotte came back, apparently not hearing the expressions of delight that rang over the concert-room.""That Chatterton girl will be all the rage now,"" whispered Alexia savagely to Clem who sat next to her. ""Look at Mrs. Cabot. She has her 'I'll-take-you-up-and-patronize-you air' on, and I know she's making up her mind to give Charlotte a musicale.""Other people also, scattered here and there in the hall, were making up their minds to introduce Miss Chatterton to their friends; as a girl with such a wonderful voice, it would be quite worth one's while to bring out.Polly, by this time, explaining to the audience, the failure of Miss Anderson to take her part in the duet, caught little ends of the whispers going on beneath her, such as ""Perfectly exquisite."" ""Most wonderful range."" ""Shall certainly ask her to sing."" And again she saw Jasper's beaming face, while Ben took no pains to conceal his delight. And she sat down to the piano mechanically, and began in a dazed way to help Miss Porter through with the duet that was to have been one of the finest things on the carefully prepared programme."
"Polly straightened up, sent Mamsie down a bright smile that made Mrs. Fisher nod, and flash back one in return, then bent all her energies to making that duet speak its message through the concert-room. People who had rather languished in their chairs, now gathered themselves up with fresh interest, and clapped their hands at the brilliant passages, and exclaimed over the ability of the music teacher who could change an apparent failure to such a glorious success. Everybody said it was wonderful; and when the duet was over, the house rang with the charming noise by which the gratified friends tried to express their delight. But Polly saw only Mamsie's eyes, filled with joy.Meantime, Charlotte Chatterton had hurried out to the dressing-room, tossing on her walking things with a quick hand; and held fast for a minute as she crept out into the broad passage, by the duet now in full progress, she went softly down the stairs.""Oh, I shall fly crazy to hear them go on,"" cried Alexia to a little bunch of girls back of the crowd; ""will nothing stop them?"" wringing her hands angrily together. ""It's all Chatterton, Chatterton now; and after Polly's magnificent playing too. Oh dear me, I knew it would be so!""""Oh, she's gone home,"" answered Alexia, stepping forward hastily--""Hasn't she, girls?"" appealing to them. ""She must have; she went out like a shot. Don't, Polly, how can you?"" she begged, turning back to twitch Polly's arm, ""you've done enough, I should think.""""And Charlotte really surprised us all,"" he went on gaily. ""Why, Polly, who would think that we have--or you rather, for you have done it all--the honor to bring out a nightingale! Here, let me do that for you."" He was fairly bubbling over with delight, and as he essayed to take the music out of Polly's hand, he laughed again. ""Dear me, how stupid I am,"" as a piece fluttered to the floor.""Yes, indeed,"" assented Jasper enthusiastically, as he recovered the piece. ""Just splendidly! I didn't know she had so much music in her. Oh, here comes a horde of congratulations, Polly."" He threw her the brightest of smiles as he moved to make way for a group of friends hurrying up to shower Polly with compliments, and every one had something delightful to add of Charlotte Chatterton's singing.""Now somebody is going to carry her off,"" grumbled Alexia; ""hurry up, girls, let's see who it is."" So they ran as lightly as Polly herself, after her, down the steps, only in time to see old Mr. King help her into the carriage with Mrs. Fisher and Phronsie, and drive rapidly off.""Stuff and nonsense!"" exclaimed Alexia angrily. ""What is the matter with Polly, Jasper? She grows worse and worse. Why can't she let Charlotte Chatterton alone, pray tell. I, for one, should think mischief enough had been done by that girl."""
"""To hear people praise to the very skies that Chatterton girl,"" cried Alexia in a passion--she was actually stamping her foot now--""oh, oh! why don't some of you say something?"" she cried, appealing suddenly to the girls. ""You all feel as I do about Polly's pushing forward that girl; and there you stand and make me do all the talking.""Jasper looked grave at once. ""There is no occasion for any one to exert herself to talk over this,"" he said. ""It is Polly's affair, and hers alone."" He raised his hat to her, and to the rest of the group, and walked off.""Oh, no, Phronsie,"" said Polly reassuringly, ""there couldn't be anything in there with Charlotte. I'll try,"" and she laid a quick hand on the knob. ""Oh, Charlotte, do open the door; you are worrying us all so,"" called Polly imploringly.""Let me smooth your hair,"" begged Phronsie, standing on tiptoe; ""do bend down just a very little, please. There, that's it,"" patting Charlotte's head with both hands; ""now you look very nice; you really do--doesn't she, Polly.""""Assuredly,"" said old Mr. King with great satisfaction in Polly's pleasure, and at her success in drawing Charlotte out. And then he thought no more about it, and the bell ringing and Mr. Alstyne coming in, he went off into the library for a quiet chat.And after this, there were no more quiet days for Charlotte Chatterton. Everybody who was musical, wanted to revel in her voice; and everybody who wasn't, wanted the same thing because it was so talked about. So she was asked to sing at musicales and receptions without end, until Alexia exclaimed at last, ""They are all raving, stark-mad over her, and it's all Polly's own fault, the whole of it.""Phronsie laid down the note she was writing to Mrs. Fargo, a fortnight later, and said to herself, ""I would better do it now, I think,"" and going out, she went deliberately to old Mr. King's room, and rapped at the door.""So you did, dear,"" said Mr. King, highly gratified, and pushing away his writing table, he held out his hand. ""Now, then, Phronsie, you are never going to be too big, you know, to sit on my knee, so hop up now.""""Charlotte poor?"" repeated the old gentleman. ""Why, no, not exactly; her father isn't rich, but Charlotte, I think, may do very well, especially as I intend to keep her here for a while, and then I shall never let her suffer, Phronsie; never, indeed.""""But Cousin Eunice didn't think so, else she'd have left it to Charlotte,"" said Mr. King abruptly, ""and she did choose to leave it to you. So there's an end of it, Phronsie. I didn't want you to have it, but the thing was fixed, and I couldn't help myself. And neither can we do anything now, but take matters as they are.""""I do think,"" said Phronsie, without taking her eyes from his face, ""that maybe Mrs. Chatterton is sorry now, and wishes that she had left some money to Charlotte. Don't you suppose so, Grandpapa?"" and one hand stole up to his neck."
"For answer, Mr. King set her down hastily on the floor, and took two or three turns up and down the room. Phronsie stood a moment quite still where he left her, then she ran up to him and slipped her hand within his.Still no answer. So Phronsie went up and down silently by his side for a few more turns. Then she spoke again. ""Does it make you sorry, Grandpapa dear, to have me want Charlotte to have the money with me?"" she asked timidly.""Blame you? Why, Grandpapa, I couldn't."" Phronsie drew a long breath, then threw herself convulsively into his arms, her face working hard in her efforts not to cry. But it was no use, and Mr. King caught her in time to see the quick drops roll down Phronsie's cheek and to feel them fall on his hand.""Oh, dear me!"" he cried in great distress, ""there, there, child, you shall give away the whole if you wish; I've enough for you without it--only don't cry, Phronsie. You may do anything you like, dear. There,"" mopping up her wet little face with his handkerchief, ""now that's a good child; Phronsie, you are not going to cry, of course not. There, do smile a bit; that's my girl now,"" as a faint light stole into Phronsie's eyes. ""I didn't mean you'd really blame me, only""--""Well, I won't, child,"" promised Mr. King, holding her close. ""And now, Phronsie, I'll tell you; I'll think of all this that you and I have talked over, and I'll let you know by and by what you ought to do about it, and you mustn't say anything about it to anybody, not to a single soul, child. It shall be just a secret between you and me.""""Well, well, perhaps I shouldn't say quite that,"" said Mr. King, correcting himself. ""But, well, now, Phronsie, you run back to your play, child, and I'll set to work at once to think out this matter.""""Indeed you are not, Pickering,"" cried Mr. Cabot quickly, the color rising to his cheek. ""There, there, my sister's boy shall never say that. But come in, come in."" He laid hold of Pickering's arm and gently forced him into the little room.""I'm not going to lecture you, my boy,"" said Mr. Cabot, closing the door, then going to the mantel to lean one elbow on it, a favorite attitude of his, while he scanned his nephew. ""But something worse than common has come to you. Can I help in any way?""""I've seen this thing, whatever it is, coming upon you for sometime,"" said Mr. Cabot, too nervous to notice the entreaty in Pickering's voice and manner, ""and I cannot wait any longer to find out the trouble. It's my right, Pickering; you have no father to see to you, and I've always wanted to have the best success be yours."" He turned away his head now, a break coming in his voice."
"""You have, Uncle, you have,"" assented Pickering, brought out a trifle from his distress, ""but then I'm not equal to the strain my relatives put upon me. Not worth it, either,"" he added, relapsing into his gloom. Then he shoved his chair so that he could not look his uncle in the face, and bent a steady glance out of the window.""Well, I can't say but that I was a good deal disturbed at one time,"" said Mr. Cabot frankly; ""but never mind that now, you are through,"" and he heaved a sigh of relief, ""and nicely established with Van Metre and Cartwright. It's the best law firm in the town, Pickering."" Mr. Cabot brought his elbow off from the mantel enough to smite his palms together smartly in enthusiasm. ""I got you in there.""""For Heaven's sake, Pickering!"" cried his uncle, darting in front of the chair and its restless occupant, ""don't say that again. It's enough to make a man go to the bad, to lose hope. What have you been doing lately? Do you gamble?""""What do you take me for?"" demanded Pickering, starting to his feet with flashing eyes, and throwing open his top-coat as if the weight oppressed him. ""I've been a lazy dog all my life, and a good-for-naught; but I hope I've not sunk to that.""""Oh, nothing, nothing--I'm sure I didn't mean,"" cried Mr. Cabot, starting back suddenly in astonishment. ""Dear me, Pickering,"" taking off his eyeglasses to blow his nose, ""you needn't pick me up so violently. I've been much worried about you,"" settling his glasses again for another look at his nephew. ""And I can't tolerate any thoughts I cannot speak.""""And I am very much relieved to find that my fears are groundless--that you've been about nothing that my sister or I should be ashamed of,"" and he picked up courage to step forward gingerly and pat the young man on the shoulder. ""You are in trouble, though, and I insist on knowing what it is.""""Never mind,"" said Mr. Cabot indulgently, ""you are over-wrought this morning. My boy,"" and he came over and clapped his nephew on the back approvingly, ""that's the best thing you ever told me; you make me very happy, and""--Ben stared after him with puzzled eyes as he shot down the long store; and all that afternoon he could not get Pickering and his strange ways out of his mind, and on the edge of the twilight, jumping out of his car at the corner nearest home, he buttoned up his coat and rushed on, regardless that Billy Harlowe was making frantic endeavors to overtake him.""What's got into the old chap,"" said Ben to himself, pushing on doggedly with the air of a man who has thoughts of his own to think out. ""I declare, if I should know Pickering Dodge lately; I can't tell where to find him.""And with no light on his puzzle, Ben turned into the stone gateway, and strode up to the east porch to let himself in as usual, with his latch key. As he was fitting it absently, all the while his mind more intent on Pickering and his changed demeanor than on his own affairs, he heard a little rustling noise that made him turn his head to see a tall figure spring down the veranda floor in haste to gain the quickest angle.""Don't speak!"" begged Charlotte hastily, and coming up to him. ""Somebody will hear you. I came out here to walk up and down--I shall die in that house; and I am going home to-morrow."" She nervously twisted her handkerchief around her fingers, and Ben still looking at her closely, saw that she had been crying."
"""Charlotte, what are you talking about?"" he cried, opening his honest blue eyes wide at her. ""Why, I thought you had ever so much sense, and that you were way ahead of other girls, except Polly,"" he added, quite as a matter of course.""Look here,"" Ben took out his key and tucked it into his pocket, then faced Charlotte, ""take a turn up and down, Charlotte; you'll pull out of your bad fit; you're homesick."" Ben's honest face glowed with pity as he looked at her.""You don't know it, but you are,"" said Ben imperturbably; ""when people begin to talk about other folks being loved and happy and all that, they're always jealous. Why in the world don't you think how everybody is loving you and wanting to make you happy?"" It was quite a long speech for Ben, and he was overcome with astonishment at himself for having made it.""And it's a pity that they should now,"" said Ben. ""I tell you, Charlotte, if you never say anything like this again, I'll believe that you're the girl I thought you, with plenty of sense, and all that. There, give us your hand. Hurry up, now; here comes Phronsie.""""And it's going to be lovely, and not rain any of the time; and we are to take Jasper a box full of everything,"" she announced in great excitement. ""We began to pack it the very minute that Grandpapa told us we were to go.""""Well, I don't know what to make of him,"" said Ben; ""he's been queer for a week now, more or less, and to-day he wouldn't speak to me; just shot off telling me to let him alone;"" and Ben rapidly laid before Polly the little scene of the morning in the store.""Now, Ben,"" said Polly, when it was all over, ""I know really that something dreadful is the matter with Pickering, and I shall send him a note to come here to-night. He must tell us what it is. I'm going to write it now."" And Polly sped off to her room, followed by Phronsie.Ben went slowly down the hall to get ready for dinner. ""I don't know how it is,"" he said, ""but everything seems to be getting mixed up in this house, and all our good, quiet times gone. And now what can Charlotte have heard to make her want to go home?""Ben sat straight in his chair, and nodded back at her. ""I can't tell her now that Pick is not what I'm stewing over,"" he said to himself, ""and I can't tell her any time, either, for Charlotte has heard something that makes her think Polly is bothered by her being here. I must just fuss at it myself till I straighten it out.""""Nonsense, Felicia,"" said Mr. Cabot, ""as if I'd get him out of that office, when it was such a piece of work to fasten him in there. Well, to make a long story short, he loves Polly Pepper. Think of that, Felicia!"" And Mr. Cabot, in his joy, got out of the chair and began to rush up and down the room, rubbing his hands together in glee.""O, Mr. Cabot--Mr. Cabot,"" cried his wife, flying after him, ""you don't mean to say that Pickering and Polly are betrothed? Was ever anything so lovely! Oh! never mind about dinner; I couldn't eat a mouthful. I must go right around there, and get my arms around that dear girl. Tell Biggs to put the horses in at once."""
"""Do order the carriage,"" begged Mrs. Cabot, with dancing eyes. ""I can't wait an instant, but I must tell Polly how glad we are. And of course you'll come too, Mr. Cabot. Oh, dear, it's such blessed news!""""Well, I want to tell you something,"" began Polly radiantly, thinking it better to cheer him up a bit with her news before getting at the root of his trouble. ""Do you know that Grandpapa is going to take us all to-morrow to see Jasper? It's to be a surprise party.""""Don't tell me that it was any of Jasper's doings,"" cried Polly vehemently, clasping her hands tightly together, so afraid she might say something to make the matter worse. ""I know, Pickering, it was quite your own fault if you won't speak.""""If you've broken friendship with Jasper, I'm quite, quite sure it is your own fault,"" hotly declared Polly again; ""Jasper never turned away from a friend in his life."" And Polly broke off suddenly and walked down the long room, aghast to find how angry she was at each step.""No more had you a right to tell, Polly,"" said her mother, ""if that is the case,"" and she turned a cheerful face toward her; ""I can trust my girl, that she won't keep anything that is her own, away from me. There, there;"" and she smoothed Polly's brown hair with her hand. ""How I used to be always telling you to brush your hair, and now how nice it looks, Polly,"" she added approvingly.""Fly-away hair, when it's taken care of as it ought to be,"" observed Mrs. Fisher, ""is one thing, and when it's all sixes and sevens because a girl doesn't have time to brush it, is another. Your hair is all right now, Polly, There, go, child;"" and she dismissed her with a final loving pat. ""I can trust you, and when your worry gets too big for you, why, bring it to mother.""So Polly, up in her own room at last, crept into a corner, and there went over every word, bitterly lamenting what she had done. At last she could endure it no longer, and she sprang up. ""I'll write a note to Pickering and say I am sorry,"" she cried to herself. ""Maybe Ben will take it to him. O, dear! I forgot; Ben is vexed with him; but perhaps he will leave it at the door. Any way, I'll ask him.""""Come in, Polly,"" cried Ben, his blue eyes glowing with welcome. ""That's all right; you don't interrupt us. Charlotte and I were having a bit of a talk, but we're through. Now what's the matter?"" with a good look at Polly's face.""Yes; couldn't help it--he was rushing out the door like a whirlwind, and we came together on the steps,"" said Ben, with a burst of laughter at the remembrance, ""and we spoke before we meant to; couldn't help it, you know; just ran into each other--and he read your note, and then he flew into the house, and was gone a moment or two, and came back mumbling it was all his fault, and he'd written; that you'd understand, or something of that sort, and he gave me this note to carry back; and I guess Pick is all right, Polly."" Ben drew a long breath of relief after he got through; he was so unaccustomed to long speeches."
"""Won't Jasper be surprised?"" Phronsie kept exclaiming over and over, when they were once fairly in the cars; much to old Mr. King's delight, who never tired of congratulating himself on planning the outing. ""Grandpapa dear, I do think it was, oh! so lovely in you to take us all.""""So it seems,"" said the old gentleman. ""Well, now, Phronsie,"" glancing around at the rest of his party, ""everything is moving on well, and I believe I'll take a bit of a nap; that is, if that youngster,"" with a nod toward the end of the car, ""will allow me to.""""I don't believe that baby will cry any more,"" said Phronsie, with a hopeful glance whence the disturbing sounds came, ""he can't, Grandpapa; he's cried so much. Now do lean your head back; I'm going to put this rug under it;"" and Phronsie began to pull out a traveling blanket from the roll.Polly, across the car aisle, laid down her book, and clambered out her seat. ""Let me take baby,"" she said, coming up unsteadily to the pale little woman who was endeavoring to pacify a stout, red-cheeked boy a year old, just beginning on a fresh series of roars.""Indeed he won't,"" laughed Polly merrily. Hearing this, Johnny stopped beating the window in the vain effort to get out, and deliberately looked Polly over. ""I like babies,"" added Polly, ""and if you'll let me,"" to the little mother, ""I'm going to play with this one."" And without waiting for an answer, she sat down in the end of the seat, and held out her hands alluringly to Johnny.""Young lady, there are babies and babies,"" observed the old gentleman solemnly, and leaning over the back of the seat, he regarded Polly over his spectacles with pitying eyes, ""and I'd advise you to have nothing to do with this particular one.""But Johnny was already scrambling all over Polly's traveling gown, and she was laughing at him. And presently the pale little woman was stretched comfortably on the opposite seat, her eyes closed restfully.""Well done!"" cried the old gentleman; ""I'll read my paper while the calm spell lasts;"" as the train rumbled on, the sound only broken by Johnny's delighted little gurgles, as Polly played ""Rabbit and Fox"" for his delectation.She leaned her troubled face against the window-side, her chin resting on her hand, and gave herself up to the old thoughts. ""What did Ben say?"" she cried suddenly, flying away from the window so abruptly that she involuntarily glanced around to be quite sure that none of her fellow-passengers were laughing at her. ""'You may be sure, Charlotte, if you keep on the lookout, there will a time come for you to help Polly.' That's what he said, and I'll hold fast to it.""On and on the train rumbled. The little mother woke up with a new light in her eyes, and a pink color on her cheeks. ""I haven't had such a sleep in weeks,"" she said gratefully. Then she leaned forward.She would have taken the thin hand in hers, but Johnny's uneasy breathing showed him still contesting every inch of progress the ""children's sandman"" was making toward him, and she didn't dare to move.""It does me good,"" said the little woman, ""somehow, I must tell you, Miss. And now I'm going to Fall River. Somebody told me I'd get work there in the Print Mills. You see, I haven't any father nor mother, nor anybody belonging to Johnny's father nor me."""
"""No'm,"" said the little woman; ""but it's a big mill, they say, and has to have lots of women in it, and there must be a place for me. I do think that times are going to be good now for Johnny and me, and""--A crash like that when the lightning begins on deadly work; a surging, helpless tossing from side to side, when the hands strike blindly out on either side for something to cling to; a sudden fall, down, down, to unknown depths; a confused medley of shouts, and one long shuddering scream. A roaring sound close to her ear made Polly start, and open her eyes. Johnny's fat arms were clutched around her neck so tightly she could scarcely breathe, while he was screaming as hard as he could.And Phronsie running up, with streaming hair and white cheeks, threw glad arms around her neck. ""Oh, Polly, are you hurt?"" And Ben seized her, but at that she winced; and her left arm fell heavily to her side.Polly followed the glance, then off to the broken car, one end of which lay in ruins across the rails, and to the crowds of people running to the scene, in the midst of which was the fearful hush that proclaimed death.""Oh! do come and help,"" called Polly, and before they knew it, she was dashing off, and running over the grass, up to the track. ""There was a woman--Johnny's mother,"" she cried, pushing her way into the crowd, Phronsie and Ben and Pickering close behind--""in the seat opposite me.""Two or three men were picking up a still figure they had just pried out from the ruins of the car-end, dropped helplessly on its side, just as it fell when the fatal blow came. ""Let me see her,"" said Polly hoarsely. They turned the face obediently; there was a long, terrible gash on the forehead that showed death to have come instantly to Johnny's mother, and that ""good times"" had already begun for her, and her weary feet were safely at rest in the Heavenly Home.Polly drew a long breath, and bending suddenly dropped a kiss on the peaceful cheek; then she drew out her handkerchief, and softly laid it over the dead face. ""Take her to that farmhouse."" She pointed to a large white house off in the fields. ""I will go there--but I must help here first.""""There was an old gentleman in the seat back of me,"" cried Polly, in distress. ""Hasn't any one seen him?"" running up and down the track; ""an old gentleman with a black velvet cap""--amid shouts of ""Keep out--the car is taking fire. Don't go near it.""""Has no one seen him?"" called Polly, in a voice so clear and piercing that it rose above the babel of the crowd, and the groans of one or two injured people drawn out from the ruin, and lying on the bank, waiting the surgeon's arrival. ""Then he must be in the car. Oh, Ben--come, we must get him out!"" and she sprang back toward the broken car end.But a rough grasp on her shoulder seized her as the words left her mouth. ""Come out of here, Miss, or you'll be killed,"" and Polly was being borne off by rescuers who had seen her rush with the two young men, in amongst the ruin. ""I tell you,"" cried Polly, struggling to get free, ""there is an old gentleman buried in there; I saw his hand."""
"""Everybody is out, Miss,"" and they carried her off. But Ben and Pickering were already in a race with the flames, for the possession of the old gentleman, whose body, after the car seat was removed, could plainly be seen.""Hand the axe,"" cried Ben. Already the car was at a stifling heat, and the roar of the flames grew perilously near. Would no one come to help them? Must they die like animals in a trap? Well, the work was to be done. Two--three ringing blows breaking away a heavy beam, quick, agile pulling up of the broken window frame, and in the very teeth of the flames, young arms bore out the old body.""At good Farmer Higby's,"" said Polly. And then he saw that her arm was in a sling. ""That's nothing,"" she finished, meeting his look, ""it's all fixed as good as can be, and has nothing to do but get well--has it, Ben?""""Yes,"" said Ben, ""don't talk about it,"" with a gasp--""Polly says that she is so glad it isn't her right arm,"" he added, with an attempt at cheerfulness. ""And the doctor promises it will be all right soon. It's lucky there is a good one here.""""No, only stunned. There, do get back,"" said Ben, pushing Pickering well under the blankets again, ""the doctor says on no account are you to get up until he came. Do keep still; he'll be here presently,"" with a glance at Mrs. Higby's chimney clock.""The doctor--who cares for him!"" cried Pickering, nevertheless he scrambled back again, and allowed Ben to tuck him in tightly. And presently in came Polly, and after her, a bright apple-cheeked woman bearing a tray, on which steamed a bowl of gruel.And in less time than it takes to tell it, Pickering was bolstered up against his pillows, and obediently opening his mouth at the right times to admit of the spoonfuls Polly held out to him. And Phronsie came in and perched on the foot of the four-poster, gravely watching it all. And old Mr. King followed, drawing up the easy chair to the bedside, where he could oversee the whole thing. And before it was over, the door opened, and a young man, with a professional air, looked in and said in great satisfaction, ""That's good,"" coming up to the bed and putting out his hand to Pickering.A thrill went over Phronsie, which she tried her best to conceal, and she turned quite pale. Polly smiled at her as she went over toward the door, followed by the doctor, old Mr. King and Ben. Pickering Dodge clenched his hand under the bedclothes, and looked after them, then steadfastly gazed at the large flowers blooming with reckless abandon up and down over the dark-green wall-paper.""Phronsie,"" said Polly, hearing her footsteps joining the others out in the hall, ""will you go in and see how Charlotte is getting on with Johnny? Do, dear,"" she whispered in Phronsie's ear, as she gained her side.""Seems's if I sha'n't ever get over the shock,"" she said to herself, looking off to the railroad track, shining in the morning sunlight. ""To look up from my sewing and see--la! and 'twas the first time I ever sat down to that rag-rug since I had to drop it and run over and take care of Simon, when they brought me word he was 'most cut to pieces in the mowing machine. My senses! I'm afraid to finish the thing."""
"""I want to get out in the woods and holler,"" she declared; ""seems's if then I'd feel better. To look up, expecting to see the cars coming along real lively and pleasant, just as they always do so sociable-like when I'm sewing, and then--oh, dear me!"" she wrung her fat hands together, ""there, all of a sudden, were two of 'em bumping together, one end smashed into kindling wood, and t'other end sticking up straight in the air. Oh! my senses, I don't wonder I thought I was going crazy, and that I let the rug fly and jumped into the middle of the floor, till I heard the screaming, and I run to help, and there was that poor soul they were bringing here, and she dead as a stone. Oh, dear, dear!""Mrs. Higby turned away so that she could not see the shining railroad track, and looked off over the meadow, while a happier expression came over her features. ""I'm awful tickled this house is big,"" she said, with a good degree of comfort, ""so's Jotham and me could take 'em in. Now I'm glad we didn't sell last spring, when Mary Ann was married, and move down to the village. Seems's if Providence was in it. Gracious, see that man running here! I hope there ain't anything else happened!"" and with her old flutter upon her, Mrs. Higby turned to meet a young man advancing to the door-stone, with more speed than was ordinarily exhibited by the natives of Brierly.""Yes,"" said Mrs. Higby; ""what do you want? Do excuse me,"" all in the same breath, ""but I'm all upset; there was an awful railroad accident along here yesterday. You haven't come to tell of anything else bad, have you?"" And she was sharper than ever.""No,"" said the young man, ""my friends are here; you took them in so kindly. Do show me the way to them."" He was quite imperative now, moving over the flat stone, and into the square entry like one accustomed to being obeyed. ""Which way?"" he asked, glancing up the stairs.""Well, well,"" said old Mr. King, trying to speak cheerfully, but only succeeding in a nervous effort, ""this isn't just the most successful way to give you a surprise party, Jasper, but it's the best we could do. And we had to send you a telegram, for fear you'd see it in the papers. So you thought you'd come on and see for yourself, eh?"" as Jasper showed no inclination to talk.Pickering Dodge still lay, gazing at the sprawling flowers on the wall, and doing his best not to count them. The door opened suddenly. ""Well, well, old fellow."" Jasper came up to the bedside with the air of one who had been in the habit of running in every little while. ""It's good to see you again, Pick,"" he added, affectionately, laying his hand, that good right hand, on the nervous one playing with the coverlids."
"""Don't say any more,"" said Pickering, his face flushing, ""and I know it's all up with me, any way, Jasper."" And he turned pale again. ""We pulled an old fellow out of the wreck, at least Ben did the most of it--Polly wanted us to; and who do you suppose he is? Why, Jack Loughead's uncle. Of course _he_'ll be here soon, and it's easy to see the end.""Pickering scrambled back into bed, fuming every instant. ""To lie like a log here, while that fellow dashes around carrying everything before him--it's--it's--abominable and atrocious! Let me out, I say!"" And he dashed toward the edge of the bed, nearly knocking Jasper over.""Hold on, there,"" cried Jasper, pinning down the clothes with a firm hand, ""don't you see""--while Pickering struggled to toss them back ""Take care, you'll tear this quilt!--that I'll help you on to your feet all in good time? And if you behave yourself, you'll be around, and a match for any Jack Loughead under the heavens. There, now, will you be still?""""Send that dunce of a doctor to me as soon as you can,"" said Pickering, rolling back suddenly once more, into the hollow made in the center of the four-poster. ""Dear me, he's sweet on Polly too!"" he groaned under the clothes.""Whew!"" exclaimed Jasper, pulling out his handkerchief to wipe his forehead. ""I won't agree to hold you in bed again, Pick. I'll send the doctor,"" he added, going out, ""but you see that you don't lose your head while I'm gone.""""I'll promise nothing,"" said Pickering softly to himself, the moment the door closed, and slipping neatly out of bed, he tiptoed over and turned the key in the lock. ""There,"" snapping his fingers in the air, ""as if I'd have that idiot of a doctor around me."" Then he proceeded to dress himself very rapidly, but with painstaking care.""I'm all right,"" and he gave himself a final shake; ""that doctor would have made a fool of me and kept me in bed, like enough, for a week. And with that Jack Loughead here!"" He gave a swift glance into the cracked looking-glass hanging over the high shelf, and with another pull at his necktie-end, unlocked the door and went out.""Yes,"" returned Jack Loughead. Pickering was made no more steady in his mind, nor on his feet, by seeing the other's evident uneasiness, but he covered it up by a careless ""Well, I suppose you have come to look up your uncle, hey?""""Oh, look us over, and see for yourself,"" said Pickering, beginning to feel faintish, and as if he would like to sit down. And then the door at the end of the hall was opened, and out came all the others and the doctor, who was saying, ""I'll just step in and look at the young man, though he's doing well enough--oh, my gracious!""""Thank you, I am doing well enough,"" said Pickering, with his best society manner on, and extending his hand, ""much obliged, I'm sure; what I should have done without you, I don't know, of course; send in your bill, and I shall be only too happy to make it all right."""
"""Oh! my cuff-button rolled in here somewhere,"" said David, emerging crab-wise, and lifting a red face. ""Give us a hand, Joe, and help pull out the bed. Plague on this room for being such a box! There!"" with an impatient shove.Joel burst into a fit of laughter, and then stared; it was such an unusual thing to see a frown on David's placid face. ""What's come over you, any way? Stand out of the way; I'll have this bed over there in a jiffy,"" rolling it into the center of the small room as he spoke.""Yes, I'm going to the Parrotts' to dinner,"" said David, hurrying off for the whisk broom to remove the last speck of dust from his dress suit. ""Of course you've forgotten it, Joe, though I don't suppose you'd go, any way.""David let another little frown settle on his face. ""No, I didn't forget that, Joe, but I do wish you'd think it possible to take a Thursday evening off once in a while for the sake of your friends, if for no other reason.""""Well, I can't,"" said Joel, getting down on all-fours to hunt for the button, ""so don't let's go over old arguments. Where in time is that thing? oh""--and he came up bright and shining to his feet, holding the button between his thumb and finger. ""My compliments to you,"" presenting it to David. ""There, stick it in before it gets lost again, and hurry off; you look pretty as a pink.""""Stop your nonsense, Joe,"" cried David sharply, who hated being reminded of his girlish beauty. ""Well, I'll make the usual excuses for you. Good-by,"" and not forgetting to pick up his walking stick with his hat, he ran off on his way to the florist's for the _boutonniere_ that must go on before he presented himself at the Parrotts' dinner party.Joel shoved back the bed into position with one long thrust that would have been a godsend to a lagging boat crew; then dashed to the table and sat down, doggedly throwing open the first book that came to hand.""I'd rather chop wood,"" he exclaimed in the old way, leaning his head on his hands. ""Whew! weren't those good days, though, in the little brown house, when we had all outdoors to work in!"" He dropped his arms to pinch the muscles of one with his other fingers. ""Isn't that beautiful?"" he said affectionately. Then he swung them over his head, tilting back his chair restfully.And by the time that Davie was handing in Miss Lulu Parrott to dinner Joel clapped together his last book, threw on his hat, and rushed out to a hasty supper at Commons, _en route_ to the Christian Association meeting."
"Johnson not getting out of his chair, Joel went in and laid hold of his arm. ""It's no use, Johnson,"" he said, ""I can't talk to you here; it's too hot and close. And I do want a walk, so let's have it together. There, button up your coat,"" as they were well out in the hall, and Johnson flung his hat on his head with a reckless hand.As they hurried down the steps they ran against a crowd of college boys. Johnson shrank up miserably against the stone fence, and tried to look as small as possible. Glances of recognition passed, and Joel spoke to right and left as the boys went by. But a few hisses, low and insistent, were all he got.""All right. He'll stay away late, then; the Parrotts always have music or a dance after their dinners. Come on."" The last speaker rolled up his sleeves, and boxed imaginary rounds in a scientific manner in the air.Joel, back in his own room, threw himself in his easy chair, first turning down the gas. ""Just so much less of a bill for Grandpapa. Our debt is rolling up fast enough without burning up the money. Dear me, if Johnson drinks after this, I shall be in despair."" He threw up his long legs, and rested them on the mantel, while he thrust his hands in his pockets, to think the better.""Now--now!"" Two or three swifter than the others, darted for the chair, but Joel was not in it. On the other side of it, looking at them, his hands out of his pockets, he stood, saying, ""What do you want?""""Come on, fellows!"" Dobbs looked back and winked to the others. ""Now!"" there was a shoulder-to-shoulder rush; a wild tangle of arms, followed by a wilder tangle of legs, and Joel was through the ranks, his black eyes blazing, and tossing his black hair from his forehead.""It's for Mamsie now, sure--and for Polly!"" he said, setting his teeth hard. On they came. But Joel, in rushing through as before, was so mindful of stepping over Bingley carefully, that it lost him an instant; and a grasp firm as iron, was on his arm. The others rallied, and closed around him.""Unhand me!"" yelled Joel, beating them off. But he might as well have fought tigers, unless he could knock off, with cruel aim, the one hanging to his arm. It was no time to mince matters, and Joel, only careful to avoid the face, struck a terrible blow that felled Dobbs flat."
"""I suppose so,"" said Joel, still swinging his arms for practice; ""probably you'll wait for me with kindly intent some dark night behind a tree, as you know I don't carry a pistol. Why don't you have it out now? Come on if you want to.""""There'll be a row over this,"" said one or two, consulting together; ""as long as those thin-skinned fellows don't get up,"" pointing to the floor, ""we must wait."" Suddenly the door was unlocked, and the whole crew stampeded.""And you didn't,"" said Bingley, wincing with the pain, as Joel slowly drew him to his feet; ""it wasn't your stinger of a blow, Pepper, but some of those dastardly cads stepped all over me; I could feel them hoofing me. There, set me in that chair, and I'll draw a long breath if I can.""""Let him alone, Pepper,"" advised Bingley; ""a mean, low-lived chap like that isn't hurt; you couldn't kill him,"" as Joel looked out anxiously to watch Dobbs' progress along the hall, at last following him along a bit.""I got no more, I presume, than was good for me,"" said Bingley, feeling the bump under his ear. ""And don't you worry, Pepper, for your mind must be toned up to meet those fellows. They'll be at some neat little game to pay you up for this, you may rest assured.""Bingley turned a pair of bright eyes on him. ""Thank you,"" he said, ""but Davina will be in soon, and things will have to be explained a little, and I'm not quite up to it to-night. No, I must go,"" moving to the door; ""I don't feel like making a pretty speech, Pepper,"" he said, hesitating a bit, ""or I'd express something of what's on my mind. But I think you understand.""""Oh, we're awfully proud of him,"" said Bingley, leaning heavily on the table, ""of course, and trot him out behind his back for praises and all that, but when it comes to giving up that sweet name--that's another thing,"" he added regretfully. ""However, I'll do it, and make the other fellows, if I can.""""Here's a telegram,"" said David, waving a yellow sheet at him. ""I just met the boy bringing it up. The folks were going to see Jasper--on a surprise party; something happened to the cars, and Polly has her arm broken--but that's all,"" delivered David, aghast at Joel's face.""Yes, Polly,"" said David; ""don't look so, Joe,"" he begged, feeling his own cheeks getting white, ""it's only broken--it can't be bad, for we are not to go, Grandpapa says; see,"" shaking the telegram at him.""But I shall go--we both must,"" declared Joel passionately, beginning to rush for his hat behind the door; ""the idea--Polly hurt, and we not to go! Come on, Dave, we can catch the midnight train,"" looking at his watch. Jack Loughead marched into his uncle's room. ""Well--well--well,"" exclaimed the old gentleman with a prolonged look, and sitting straight in his chair. ""So this really is you, Jack? I must say, I am surprised.""""But that little girl there,"" pointing toward the next room, where the talking seemed to be going on busily, ""insisted that I was buried in the smash-up, so they tell me, and she made them come and look for me. None too soon, I take it, by all accounts."" The old gentleman placidly tore off two or three grapes from the bunch in the basketful, put at his elbow, and ate them leisurely."
"""Phronsie? Who's talking of Phronsie?"" cried his uncle, pushing back the fruit-basket. ""It was the other one--Polly; she wouldn't let them give over till they pulled me out. So the two young men tell me; very well-meaning chaps, too, they are, Jack.""So Jack drew up his chair, as bidden; and presently the financial head of the Bradbury & Graeme Company, and the enterprising young member who was the principal part of ""Company,"" were apparently lost to all else in the world, but their own concerns.The doctor, washing his hands of such a troublesome patient, had just run downstairs, jumped into his little old gig in displeasure, and was now half across a rut worn in the open meadow, dignified by the name of the ""Short Road.""""Really ought?"" repeated Pickering, in high disdain; ""as if I'd put myself again under that quack's thumb. No, sir!"" and snapping his fingers derisively at Ben, he straightened up jauntily on his somewhat uncertain feet. ""All I want is a little air,"" stumbling off to the window.As they disappeared, Ben ran over to Pickering, and was aghast to find that the face laid against the window-casing was deathly white, and that all his shaking of the broad shoulders could not make Pickering open his eyes.""Excuse me!"" Ben rushed in without knocking upon the Bradbury & Graeme Company. ""Do you mind""--to Jack--""I'm awfully sorry to ask it, but I can't leave him. Will you run to the doctor's and fetch him? Mrs. Higby, the landlady downstairs, you know, will tell you where to find him."" Ben was all out of breath when he got through, and stood looking at young Loughead.""See here,"" cried old Mr. Loughead suddenly, as Ben was rushing out, ""can't I see your sister? I'm horribly lonesome,"" turning in his chair; ""that is, if her arm will let her come,"" he added, as a second thought struck him. ""Don't ask her if you think she's in pain.""""It's so nice,"" said Polly, sitting down on one of Mrs. Higby's spare-room ottomans, on which that lady had worked a remarkable cat in blue worsted reposing on a bit of green sward, ""to think that everybody is getting on so well,"" and she hugged her lame arm rapturously.Polly started. ""Out in the meadow,"" she said softly. ""Mrs. Higby wanted it here instead of in the churchyard. It is under a beautiful oak-tree, Mr. Loughead, and Mr. Higby is going to make a fence around it, and Grandpapa is to put""--""Up the stone, I suppose you mean,"" interrupted the old gentleman. ""Well, and when that's done, why, what can be said upon it, pray tell? You don't know a thing about it--who in Christendom the woman was--not a thing."""
"""Johnny's mother,"" said Polly sorrowfully, the corners of her mouth drooping; ""that's going to be on it, and Grandpapa is to have the letters cut, telling about the accident; and Mrs. Higby hopes that sometime somebody will come to inquire about it. But I don't believe anybody ever will come in all this world,"" added Polly softly, ""because there is no one left who belongs to Johnny,"" and she told the story the pale little mother had just finished when the car went over.Old Mr. Loughead ""hemmed,"" and exclaimed impatiently, and fidgeted in his chair, all through the recital. When it was over, and Polly sat quite still, ""What are you going to do with that horrible boy?"" he asked sharply. ""Almshouse, I suppose, eh?""""Oh! I didn't mean our home,"" explained Polly, obliged to interrupt him, he was becoming so furious. ""Johnny is going down to Dunraven, to the Children's Home,"" and then she began on the story of Phronsie's company of children, and how they lived, and who they were, with many little side stories of this small creature, who was ""too cunning for anything,"" and that funny little boy, till the old gentleman sat helplessly listening in abject silence. And the latch was lifted, and young Mr. Loughead put his head in the doorway, looking as if he had finished a long tramp.""Come in, Jack,"" said his uncle, finding his tongue. ""We've a whole orphan asylum in here, and I don't know what all; every charity you ever heard of, rolled into one. Do come in, and see if you can make head or tail to it.""""Oh! Mr. Loughead knows all about it,"" cried Polly brightly, while her cheeks glowed, ""for he went down to Dunraven with us at Christmas, and he showed the children stereopticon pictures, and told them such nice stories of places that he had seen.""""Softly, softly, child,"" he warned; ""you'll hurt it,"" tenderly covering the poor arm with his right hand, while he fumbled in his pocket with the other, for his handkerchief. ""Dear me!"" and he blew his nose violently. ""Yes; well, you're sure you're all right except this?"" and he held Polly at arm's length and scanned her closely.""Come, come!"" ejaculated Mr. King, appearing in the doorway; ""this isn't just the way to take possession of Mr. Loughead's apartment. Jasper, I don't see what you were thinking of. Come, Fisher, my room is next; this way.""And twilight settled down on the old square white house, and on the new-made grave under the oak in the meadow; and Brierly people, by twos and threes, came to inquire for ""the sick young man,"" going away with saddened faces. And a messenger from the telegraph office drove up just as Mr. Higby was pulling on the boots to his tired feet for a long walk to the village, handing in the message:And the next day Pickering's calls were incessant for ""Polly, Polly,"" sometimes upbraiding her as the brown eyes were fastened piteously on his wild face; and then begging her to just smile at him and remember how he had loved her all these years. ""And now I am going to die,"" he would cry.""O, Polly! Polly!"" Mrs. Cabot would wring her hands and beg at such times, a world of entreaty in her voice. And then old Mr. King would interfere, carrying Polly off, and declaring it was beyond all reason for her to be so annoyed."
"And Phronsie would climb up on the bed and lay her cool little hand gently on the hot forehead. Then the sick boy's cries would drop into unintelligible murmurs, while his fingers picked aimlessly at the coverlet.But the quiet only ushered in worse ravings when Pickering lived over once more the horror of the train-wrecking, and then it took many strong arms to hold him in his bed. ""Come on, Ben,"" he would shout, struggling hard; ""leave him alone--we shall be caught--the fire! the fire!"" until his strength died away, and he sank to a deathly stupor.Phronsie sat down to write a letter to Mrs. Fargo. One like it was dropped every morning into the basket set on Mrs. Higby's front entry table, ready for the neighbor's boy to take to the village post-office.[wrote Phronsie, looking off from the wooden cradle that Mrs. Higby had dragged down from its cobwebby corner under the garret eaves, with the remark, ""I guess Johnny'll sleep well; all the Higbys since the first one, has been rocked in it.""] I must tell you that dear Pickering isn't any better. [Then she glanced back again, and softly jogged the cradle, as Johnny turned over with a long sigh.] And Papa Fisher and the other doctor don't think he is going to get well. And Mrs. Cabot cries all the time, and Polly cries sometimes too. And we don't know what to do. But I guess God will take care of us. And Charlotte is going to take Johnny down to the Dunraven Home in a day or two. She says she can, though I know she don't like babies, especially boy-babies; she said so once. And so he will be happy. And that's all I can write to-day, Mrs. Fargo, because every minute I'm afraid Polly will want me.I think God meant that I was to have Johnny for my very own. So won't you give him to me, dear? Let Charlotte bring him soon, please, for my heart is hungry for a baby to hold. I will make him happy all my life, Phronsie, so I know you will give him to""Pickering will like these,"" she said to herself in great satisfaction, and surveying her torn frock with composure, ""for they are the very first, Mrs. Higby,"" addressing that individual standing over by the sink in the corner. ""Please may I wash my hands? I had to go clear far down by the brook to get them.""""Land!"" exclaimed Mrs. Higby, in a voice spent with feeling, ""I couldn't, 'cause I was afraid I sh'd burst out crying, and I didn't want you to see my face. O, dear! he's had a poor spell since you went out flowerin' for him, and your pa and Dr. Bryce say he's dyin'. O, dear!"""
"But old Mr. King put up his hand as he turned in his chair, at the foot of the bed, and Phronsie saw that his face was white and drawn. And Dr. Bryce turned also, looking off a minute from the watch that he held, as if he were going to bid her go away.""I am not afraid, Grandpapa,"" said Phronsie, her mouth to his ear, ""and I think Pickering would like me to be here. I brought him some flowers."" She moved the hand holding the bunch, so that the old gentleman could see it. ""He likes wild flowers, and I promised to get the first ones I could.""""Yes, yes, child,"" said the old gentleman, allowing her to slip to the floor. The group around the bedside parted to let her pass, and then Phronsie saw Polly. Mrs. Cabot was holding Polly's well hand, while her head was on Polly's shoulder.Phronsie's little heart seemed to stop beating as she reached the bedside. She had not thought that she would be afraid, but it was so different to be standing there looking down upon the pillow where Pickering lay so still and white, and with closed eyes, looking as if he had already gone away from them. She glanced up in a startled way and saw Dr. Fisher at the head of the bed; he was holding Pickering's wrist. ""Yes,"" he motioned, ""put them down.""""I'm dying--I'm not afraid,"" suddenly said Pickering's white lips. Dr. Fisher sprang and put a spoonful of stimulant to them, while Mrs. Cabot buried her face yet deeper on Polly's shoulder, her husband turning on his heel, to pace the floor and groan. ""Polly, Polly!"" called Pickering quite distinctly, in a tone of anguish.""It has come,"" said Dr. Fisher in a low voice to Mr. Cabot; ""tell your wife,"" and he bent a professional ear over the white face on the pillow, while Dr. Bryce hurried forward; then brought his head up quickly, a peculiar light in the sharp eyes back of the spectacles. ""He is sleeping!""Polly was sitting, a half-hour by the bedside, Pickering's thin fingers still tightly grasping her hand. They had made her comfortable in an easy chair, Jasper bringing one of Mrs. Higby's biggest cushions for her to lean her head against. He now stood at the side of her chair, Phronsie curled up on the floor at her feet.He shook his head, resting his hand on the back of the chair. Polly tried to smile up a bit of comfort into his eyes. ""Jasper loved Pickering so,"" she said to herself, ""that he cannot leave him; but oh! he looks so dreadfully, I wish he would go and rest,"" and she began to have a worried look at once.""Oh! you know quite well what I mean, Miss Chatterton,"" declared Mrs. Cabot, in her distress losing her habitually polite manner. ""Why, everybody knows that Pickering has loved Polly since they were boy and girl together.""""And now, why, it's just a Providence, I do believe--that is, if he gets well--that brought all this about, for of course Polly must be touched by it. She must!"" brought up Mrs. Cabot quite jubilantly."
"""Of course it is--but then, sometimes it isn't,"" said Mrs. Cabot nervously. ""Well, any way, Polly has almost as good as promised to marry Pickering,"" she finished triumphantly--""so--and you are very cruel to talk to me in this way, Miss Chatterton.""""Then I'm sure Providence hasn't had anything to do with this,"" said Charlotte shortly, ""and Polly shall never be tormented into thinking it her duty either,"" and she turned off to pick up a new gown ""in the works"" for Johnny.""What you think duty, Miss Chatterton, wouldn't be Polly Pepper's idea of duty in the least,"" said Mrs. Cabot, getting back into the refuge of her society manner again, now that her confidence in Polly grew every moment, ""so we will talk no more about it if you please,"" she added icily, as she went toward the door. ""Only mark my words, my dear boy and that dear girl will be engaged, and quite the appropriate match it will be too, and please every one.""""You must go back, my boy,"" said old Mr. King two days later. ""It's just knocking you up to stay,"" studying Jasper's face keenly. ""Goodness me! I should think you'd fallen off a dozen pounds. Upon my word I should, my boy,"" he repeated with great concern.""You will do nothing of the kind,"" declared Mr. King testily. ""What can you do here, pray tell, by staying? You would be quite a muff in a few more days, Jasper,"" he added, ""you are so down-hearted now. No, I insist that you go now.""""How you talk, Jasper!"" cried his father in astonishment. ""You know quite well that I am only thinking of your own good. What's got into you--but I suppose this confounded hospital we're in, has made you lose your head.""""Thank you, father,"" said Jasper, recovering himself by a great effort, ""for putting it so, and I beg you to forgive me for my hasty words."" He came up to the old gentleman and put out his hand quickly, ""Do forgive me, father.""""Forgive you? Of course I will, though I don't know when you've spoken to me like that, Jasper,"" said his father, not yet able to shake himself free from his bewilderment. ""Well, well, that's enough to say about that,"" seeing Jasper's face, ""and now get back to your work, my boy, as soon as you can, and you'll thank me for sending you off. And as soon as Pickering Dodge is able to be moved home, why, the rest of us will finish our trip, and give you that surprise party--eh, Jasper?"" and Mr. King tried to laugh in the old way, but it was pretty hard work.""Well, now, Polly,"" said Dr. Fisher, a week after as he held her at arm's length, and brought his spectacles to bear upon her face, ""remember what I say, child; you are to take care of yourself, and let Mrs. Cabot look out for things. It will do the woman good to have something to do,"" he added, dropping his voice. ""I don't like to carry home your face, child; it won't do; you're getting tired out, and your mother will be sure to find it out. I really ought to stay and take care of you,"" and the little doctor began to look troubled at once.""It isn't your arm, Polly, that worries me,"" said Father Fisher; ""that's first-rate, and I shouldn't wonder if it turned out better perhaps for breaking, but it's something different, and it quite puzzles me; you look so down-hearted, child."""
"""Do I?"" said Polly, standing quite straight, and rubbing her forehead with her well hand; ""there, now, I will get the puckers and wrinkles out. There, Papa Fisher, are they all gone?"" She smiled as cheerily as ever, but the little man shook his head, then took off his spectacles, wiped them, and set them back on his nose.He interrupted her as she clung to his arm. ""I know that, but what can I do? If you'd only promise now, Polly,"" he added artfully, ""that you won't tire yourself all out trying to suit Mrs. Cabot's whims--why, I'd think about taking back what I said about sending your mother down.""""Yes,"" said Dr. Fisher, glad to see Polly's color back again, and to have her beg him for some favor. So the next half-hour or so they were very cheery--just like old times; just as if there had been no sickness and the shadow of a loss upon them in the past days.""Though why we should be always acting as if we were in the midst of it now, I don't see,"" said the little doctor at last. ""We're all straightened out, thank God, and Pickering mending so fast that he's a perfect marvel. It would be a sin and a shame for us to be in the dumps forever. Well, now, Polly, remember. Whew! hear that youngster!"" This last being brought out by Johnny's lusty shouts in the next room. ""I don't envy Mrs. Fargo her bargain, and I do pity myself having to see him safely there.""""Oh! Charlotte will take all the care of him,"" said Polly quickly. ""She's just beautiful with him; you don't know how beautiful, Papa Fisher, because you've been so busy, since you've been here, and Charlotte has kept him away from everybody so he needn't worry any one. And isn't it lovely that he is to have such a beautiful home?"" added Polly with shining eyes.""It's just this,"" said Charlotte, plunging on desperately; ""Polly, don't let Mrs. Cabot pick at you and talk about duty. Oh! I hate to hear her speak the word,"" exploded Charlotte, with a volume of wrath in her tone.""Oh! she may--never mind how--she's quite peculiar, you know,"" said Charlotte, finding her way less clear with each word. ""Never mind, Polly; only just fight her if she begins on what is your duty; if she does, then fight her tooth and nail.""Charlotte turned on her in horror. ""O, never!"" she cried. ""Don't you do it, Polly Pepper. Just as sure as she says you ought to do it, you may know it would be the worst thing in all the world. Promise me, Polly, that you won't do it."""
"But Charlotte was too far gone in anxiety to see anything, and she could only reiterate, ""Do promise, Polly, do; there's Mr. Higby calling us; the carriage is at the door. Do, Polly! I never will ask you anything else if you'll only promise me this.""But Polly could only shake her head, and say, ""I ought not,"" and then Johnny had to be kissed and wrenched from Phronsie, who insisted on carrying him downstairs to set him in the carriage, and Mrs. Cabot came in, and old Mr. King wanted a last word with Charlotte, so that at last she was in Mr. Higby's carryall, shut in on the back seat looking out over Johnny's head, with a pair of very hopeless eyes. But her lips said, ""Do, Polly!""""I shall tell Mrs. Fisher, and beg her to come right down here,"" determined Charlotte Chatterton to herself, ""just as soon as I get in the house. That is exactly what I shall do,"" she declared savagely, as Mr. Higby whipped up the mare for the quarter-mile drive to the little station. ""Halloo, King, Mr. Marlowe wants you."" Jasper, his hands full of papers, hurried down the long warehouse, through the piles of books, fresh from the bindery, stacked closely to the ceiling. The busy packers who were filling the boxes, looked up as he threaded his way between them. ""Mr. Marlowe is down there,"" indicating the direction with a nod, while the hands kept mechanically at their task.""And Jacob Bendel writes that the edition we gave him of _History of Great Cities_ to print will be shipped to us within a fortnight, when his contract was to be filled on Thursday. Of course we lose all the Chicago orders by this delay.""""Oh! a strike among the printers; his best men have gone out, and he's at the mercy of a lot of inferior workmen who are being intimidated by the strikers; but he thinks he can get the edition to us in ten days or so.""Mr. Marlowe leaned against an empty packing case and viewed the assistant foreman of the manufacturing department calmly, with the air of a man to whom disappointments were in the usual order of things.""They are full and running over with work. I inquired there yesterday; we may want a little extra done as the rush over those Primary Readers is coming on. No, I can't think of a place where we could crowd it in, if we took it away from Bendel.""""I think I'll send you down to New York to see Bendel, and find out how things are. I don't get any satisfaction from letters,"" said Mr. Marlowe in a minute. ""Beside you can attend to some other matters; and then there is that Troy job; you can do that.""""If Mr. Green thinks any mistake has been made, let him come to us,"" said Mr. Marlowe coolly. ""You tell Parker to send a note to that effect; courteously written, of course, but to the point. We don't go running around after people who think mistakes are made. Let them bring their grievances here, if they have any. Is that all that detains you?""""Come this way; I'll give you instructions what to say to Bendel,"" and Mr. Marlowe led the way out to a quiet corner of the warehouse, where he sat down by a desk, and rapidly laid the points of the business before his assistant.""Sister Marian will say it's all right,"" said Jasper, a trifle impatiently, and feeling the loss of every moment a thing to be atoned for. ""Mr. Marlowe is loaded up with trouble of all kinds. Now I must go."""
"""I'm well enough,"" said Jasper abruptly. ""Tell sister Marian I will write her very soon,"" pulling out his watch; ""good-by,"" and he was lost in the crowd surging down Broadway. Mr. Whitney standing still a moment to look after him, turned, and went directly to his office.""That call on Hendryx & Co. can wait,"" he muttered to himself on the way, ""but Jasper can't. The boy looks badly, and his father ought to know it; although it seems funny enough for me to be meddling with Jasper's affairs. But I won't leave anything to worry about afterward; they can't say I ought to have told them.""So a letter went out by next mail from Mr. Whitney's office, saying that Jasper looked poorly enough when he was met in New York; that he seemed incapable of breathing any other air than that saturated with business; that he had evidently mistaken his vocation when he chose to be a publisher. ""Beside, there isn't any money now in the publishing business,"" added Mr. Whitney as a clincher; ""there are too many of the fellows cutting each other's throats to make it pay; and books are slaughtered right and left, and Jasper much better get into some other business, in my opinion.""Meanwhile Jasper finished, to the letter, the instructions for Jacob Bendel, did up the other matters entrusted to him, and set out on his Troy expedition. Here he was detained a day or two, Mr. Marlowe's instructions being to wait over and telegraph if the business could not be adjusted satisfactorily. But the fourth day after leaving home, Jasper, just from the night express, mounted the stairs to his hotel in the early morning, his bag in his hand, and the expression on his face of a man who has accomplished what he set out to do.""Yes; dear me, Jasper, with all the worries I have had lately, it does seem a pity that you couldn't take care of yourself. It really does,"" repeated Mr. King, his feelings nowise soothed by picking up his watch and finding it half-past six o'clock. When he made sure of the time, he set down the watch quickly, and stared at Jasper worse than ever.""Now, father,"" said Jasper, ""there's a mistake somewhere, but never mind now; you must get back to bed again. I don't know when you've been up at this hour."" He tried to laugh, while he laid his hand on the old gentleman's arm. ""Do get back to bed, father.""""It certainly is a most outrageous hour in which to arise,"" remarked his father, not able to suppress a yawn, ""and I don't mind if I do turn in--but where will you sleep, Jasper?"" whirling around on his son. ""I've come to look after you, and I shouldn't begin very well to monopolize your bed,"" with a short laugh.""If you say so, then I will,"" said the old gentleman, ""and you are too tired to talk before you've had a nap."" So he lay down on the bed, Jasper dutifully tucking him up, and presently his regular breathing told that he had picked up the threads of his broken slumber.Jasper threw himself on the lounge, but unable to close his eyes, his gaze fell on a sheet of paper, lying on the floor just within reach. It was impossible to avoid reading the words: ""And Jasper better get into some other business, in my opinion,"" and signed ""Mason Whitney.""Jasper jumped to his feet and strode up and down the room in growing indignation; then seized his hat and darted out to cool himself off before his father should awake. When he returned, old Mr. King was half-dressed, and berating Buttons for his failure to have the morning paper at the door.So after a meal in which Jasper, by skillful management of all conversational topics, allowed no chance word of business to intrude, old Mr. King and he started for the publishing house of D. Marlowe & Co., Jasper filling up all gaps that might suggest time for certain questions that seemed to be trembling on the tip of Mr. King's tongue, while that gentleman was making a running commentary to himself something in this wise: ""Just like Mason; send me off here when there is not the slightest need of it. The boy is well enough; quite well enough,"" he added, in his energy speaking the last words aloud.""What is it, father?"" Jasper paused in the midst of a descriptive fire concerning the new buildings going up on either hand, with many side stories of the men who were erecting them; and he paused for an answer."
"""Hem, hem! well, we shall see,"" observed Mr. King drily, determined not to yield too easily. ""You've been at it only six months. You know the old adage, Jasper: 'You must summer and winter' a thing before you decide.""""Hoity, toity! well, that is for me to decide, I take it,"" responded his father. ""You've never disobeyed me yet, Jasper, and I don't believe you ever will. And if I think it's best for you to change your business, of course you'll do it.""Jasper's brow darkened, and he closed his lips tightly for a moment. Then something Polly said once when his father was in a particularly determined mood, came to his mind: ""You better make him happy, Jasper, any way."" That ""any way"" carried the day now.""I don't know as I should be at all pleased to have you leave the publishing business, Jasper,"" said old Mr. King, veering around quickly. ""I can't tell till I've seen just how it suits you. But I am going to the root of the matter, now that I am here. Oh! is this the place?"" as they came up against a large window, behind whose plate glass, rows and rows of books in all styles of bindings, met the view of the passer-by.""This is it,"" said Jasper, with a thrill that he was part of the ""it,"" and the satisfaction in his completed commission, that had been lost by his father's words, now bounded high again. ""Now then, father, you must meet Mr. Marlowe,"" turning up the steps.Old Mr. King walked down the store-length as if he owned the whole with several others of its kind thrown in, and on Jasper's pausing before a small office-door, marked ""private,"" heard him say through its open window, ""Good-morning, Mr. Marlowe.""""He has business men with him; they'll be through in a quarter of an hour,"" Jasper brought out in distress that was by no means lightened by the knowledge that half of the clerks through the long salesroom were becoming acquainted with the conversation.""I want no books,"" said the old gentleman, now thoroughly determined, by this time looking in the open window of the private office. ""Good-morning, sir,"" stiffly to the middle-aged gentleman sitting before the desk.""Jasper,"" cried Mr. King, taking short, quick steps to where Jasper stood, ""give me a sheet of paper so that I may write to this fellow, and take you out of his contemptible trade--or stay, I will write from the hotel,"" and he started for the door.""And that you could tolerate such impertinence to me,"" continued Mr. King with growing anger, ""is more than I can understand; but since you've come into trade it's vastly changed you. If you do not choose to come to the hotel with me, I must go alone,"" which with great dignity he now proceeded to do.The business man turned around and gave a significant look to a knot of the salesmen, but happening to catch Jasper's eye, he said, ""It's a fine day, King,"" carelessly, and passed out, but not before ""Stuck-up old money-bag"" fell upon the old gentleman's ear.""We would better go to the hotel now, I think, father,"" said Jasper quietly. ""Frank,"" to the nearest salesman, ""will you tell Mr. Marlowe when it is ten minutes past,"" glancing at the clock, ""that I was obliged to go with my father, but I will be back at ten o'clock?"""
"""You need give yourself no such trouble, Jasper, as all this,"" said his father decidedly; ""I will wait if it is absolutely necessary that you see him,"" with a patronizing wave of his gloved hand toward the private office.Mr. Marlowe's hands were mechanically adjusting the loose papers on his desk, so as not to lose an instant's time as Mr. King and Jasper came up, but he turned a face, over which a bright smile shot suddenly, lighting up the gray eyes, then quickly whirled around in his office chair. ""Glad to see you,"" he said, putting out a cordial right hand.""I have come, sir,"" said Mr. King, as he settled his courtly old figure in the chair Jasper had put for him beside the desk, ""to see you about my son; I am not satisfied with his appearance, nor, I am sorry to say, with his surroundings.""""Permit me to say, sir,"" Mr. King broke out, finding to his astonishment it was not an easy matter to talk to this imperturbable man entrenched behind his own desk, ""that I am disappointed in the atmosphere in which I find my son. It smells of trade, sir, too much to suit my fancy.""""And as for the manufacturing department,"" continued Jasper, finding it more difficult to keep still, ""it was the only place for me; I had to begin at the bottom, if I'm ever to be a publisher--which is what my work is to be--""All this while Mr. Marlowe still played with the little articles on his desk, sitting very quietly and watching the two. He now threw them down with an abrupt movement, whirled the revolving chair around suddenly and sent a lightning-like glance of stern inquiry toward old Mr. King.""My intentions are,"" said the old gentleman, in a lofty way, ""to take my son out of the business--entirely out, sir,"" he waved his hand in a stately and comprehensive manner; then glanced to see the effect on the head of the house.""I had intended,"" he went on condescendingly, ""to have my son put in a large interest in the business, supposing it turned out to be the proper one for him. In fact, his and my financial support would have made it one of the finest publishing houses in the world.""Mr. Marlowe bowed. ""Thank you,"" he said politely. ""James,"" turning to the window opening into the book-keeping department, ""make out Jasper King's account and settle at once. I believe you wish to go as soon as you can, do you not,"" to Jasper, ""that is, after you have given me the report of the business you did on the trip?""""Jasper,"" Mr. Marlowe stopped a moment and seemed to swallow something in his throat, then went on, ""your father wishes it, and you will make him happy""--Jasper started at Polly's own words--""that's enough for one life time. I'm sorry to lose you, my boy,"" he suddenly grasped Jasper's hand, ""but allow me to say, sir,"" turning to old Mr. King, ""that for you and your money I have very little consideration. You don't own enough to make it worth while for the house of David Marlowe & Co. to extend an invitation to you to enter it. And now, if you will excuse me, I will hear Jasper's account of the business he was sent on.""""I hope you'll believe,"" began Jasper brokenly, feeling as if the whole world were going awry, ""that this strange idea was never gained from me. Why, I _love_ the business."" His gray eyes glowed as he spoke the word.""My boy,"" Mr. Marlowe's face was alight with feeling, ""don't explain, I understand it all; you've the misfortune to be born into a rich family, and your father probably never had to raise his hand to earn a penny. He isn't to be blamed, only I did hope""--""That I was different,"" finished Jasper, his head drooping a bit with the shame of it. ""Oh, Mr. Marlowe, father is so splendid--he's just a magnificent man,"" he added, the head coming up, with Jasper's old habit of throwing it back, ""if you only knew him and he could have shown you his old self.""""Don't I know it,"" responded Mr. Marlowe heartily, ""and I also know that you must stick by him. Only I did hope--and now I will finish what I was going to say--that you could stay and help me, for you are after my own heart, Jasper,"" he added abruptly, a rare tremble in his voice.And then, as if nothing but the ordinary business had occurred, Jasper sat down and went carefully over every detail of the commission he had been sent on, heard Mr. Marlowe's terse, ""That's good, Jasper; you've done it all well,"" and passed out for the last time, from the private office, and joined his father in silence, for the walk to the hotel."
"Down in the audience sprinkled here and there, or in the galleries, were some of the D. Marlowe & Co. salesmen and workers staring often up at him, and the handsome white-haired old gentleman by his side.""There's that old snob,"" they would exclaim at first recognition, to their companions, ""look at him,"" and under pretense of gazing at the stage, the opera glasses would be turned on the box. ""Looks as if he owned the whole town, eh?""""Yes,"" said every one of the men, only seeing the old gentleman, ""but he's too toploftical to live""--or something to that effect--and then they would forget all about it till the companion's opera glasses leveled in the same direction, brought the conversation around to the old topic.""Yes,"" said the salesman, and a real regret passed over his careless face, ""and it's a shame, for no one would have thought he owned a penny; he was just digging at the business all the time, like the rest of us.""""I shall have a cab and go by myself. You'll go to bed, or I'll call in the doctor. Goodness me, Jasper, you don't look like the same boy that started out in business six months ago; you're all worn out.""Jasper said nothing, only redoubled his efforts on the breakfast before him that now assumed colossal proportions, and as if it could never be eaten in the world, hoping to persuade his father into allowing him to go on the tour of inspection. But it was no use. Mr. King on finishing his morning repast, stalked out to the office, and ordered a carriage, and presently departed, with last injunctions to Jasper, ""to lie down and take things easy.""""Well, I will ask you something, then,"" said Jack Loughead coolly. ""I'm a business man, King, and I must come to the point in a business way. First, let me tell you that Uncle and I start for Australia in a fortnight;"" Jasper drew a long breath of relief. ""Yes, I must get back; and you will see that I cannot go without,"" Jack Loughead paused--then went on abruptly. ""Does Miss Pepper care for Pickering Dodge?""""How do I know--how can I tell?"" cried Jasper desperately, and springing from his chair, he began to pace the floor again. ""Excuse me, Loughead, I'm not myself to-day. I've left D. Marlowe & Co. and""--""Yes, I know,"" interrupted Jack, and drawing a long breath of relief on his part at being able to speak on this subject now that the ice was broken; ""well, I'm glad, of course, King, if you didn't care to stay,"" he said.""But I did,"" cried Jasper, stopping short, to emphasize this. ""Mr. Marlowe is a royal man, through and through, and I'd work for him all my life. But my father thought best not; that's enough,"" he added in the abruptest fashion, beginning to walk again.""Yes, I know,"" repeated Jack Loughead, ""nothing breaks a man up like wrenching him from his work. King,"" he sprang to his feet and joined Jasper walking on by his side down the room, ""you are Miss Pepper's brother, or as good as one. Can you tell me if I shall wrong Pickering Dodge if I speak to her?""Jasper was saved from answering by old Mr. King coming in with a ""Oh, how d'ye, Loughead? Well, well, Jasper, you've had a good nap, I take it."" And then all three went down to luncheon, and Jasper managed not to be left alone with Jack Loughead until at the last when he said, ""I shall go and tell the whole story to Mrs. Fisher; of course I must speak to her first."""
"""What's the matter?"" cried David, running lightly back to stand in front of Percy. ""Dear me, Percy, you have lost your eyeglasses!"" with a glance at the other's flushed face; ""wait, I'll find the things.""""Shades of the departed specs,"" cried David, also sitting straight and peering with his keen blue eyes in a birdlike way along the sward. ""It's a mysteri--oh, Great Caesar!"" then he fell on his back on the campus, and rolled and laughed, to bring up red and shining, only to tumble over and roll again.Percy's hand flew up to his thick mane of brown hair, that not all his disgust and tireless training could persuade to lie smoothly, when he picked off his beloved glasses, after an angry twitch or two.""Goodness sake, you are yarning yourself,"" retorted Percy indignantly, ""to pretend that you don't know that last night a dozen or more fellows called on Joe, and he handled 'em without gloves, so that Bingley and Dobbs can't hardly step to-day.""""Dobbs heads it, as he did the first one,"" said Percy; ""they've changed their tactics, and will get at Joe on their way home from that confounded meeting. Dave, can't you keep him from that?"" and Percy, forgetting himself, peered anxiously over his glasses.""You're an idiot,"" cried Percy, in a passion, ""a stupid, blind old donkey! Joe will be mauled dreadfully,"" he howled, beating his hands together in distress; ""no help for it but to keep him away from that old association meeting.""David's feet by this time were flying over the Campus, so that Percy was obliged to shout the remainder of the sentence after him. The consequence was that several heads were popped out of as many windows in the long gray dormitory fronting the Campus, their owners all engaged in the pleasing duty of staring at Percy and the flying figure across the grass.""Now I'm in for it, for there's Dobbs, I vow,"" exclaimed Percy to himself, in dismay; ""he'll guess I've given Dave warning,"" and he tried to strike a careless attitude, picking off his glasses to hold them up and gaze long and earnestly through them into the nearest tree.Percy, maddened by the failure of his plan to divert suspicion, now lost his head entirely, and sticking his eyeglasses on again, ran off like lightning to his room, followed by ""Little coward, we'll treat you too--Look out!""""No, I don't,"" answered his father, in his crispest fashion. ""No one needs me there; Mrs. Cabot is a host in herself, and those boys may--who knows? At any rate, I must see how they are getting on, so we will go as soon as you can get your things packed and sent home,"" and the old gentleman glanced around the room at the various keepsakes and family adornings that Jasper had brought with him to make life less lonely while he made a business man of himself.""Very well, father,"" said Jasper, he could not trust himself to say more; and for the first time had to hurry away that his father might not see his face. But old Mr. King was the farthest removed from carrying the look of a person holding any interest whatever in Jasper's trouble, for he went on to say, ""And I do hope you will get it over with as quickly as possible, Jasper, so that we may be off,"" then he fell to reading the evening paper with great gusto.Once out in the park, a half-mile away, his hands thrust in their pockets, Jasper slackened his pace, and breathed freer. Before him seemed to be the little brown house; it was the first time he had seen Mrs. Pepper--and they had just finished their long talk, when the mother had thanked him for rescuing Phronsie from the organ-grinder. The five little Peppers were begging him to come over again to see them, but Mrs. Pepper laid her hand on his arm. ""Be sure, Jasper,"" she warned, ""that your father is willing."" He could see her black eyes looking down into his face. What would she say now?Jasper threw himself down on one of the seats under a friendly tree. ""At least, Polly, you sha'n't be ashamed of me,"" he said in a moment or two, ""and dear Mrs. Fisher,"" then he walked quietly off to make the last preparations that his father had ordered."
"""Well, now, Charlotte,"" said Mrs. Fisher, ""you needn't worry, not a single bit,"" and she went on calmly sorting out the small flannel petticoats in her lap. ""That is rather thin,"" she said, holding up one between her eyes and the light; ""King Fisher, how you do kick things out!""""And there's that dreadful, hateful Mrs. Cabot,"" she cried, plunging back, her pale eyes afire. ""Oh! I feel so wicked, Mrs. Fisher, whenever I think of her, I'd like to tear her, I would, for picking at Polly,"" she declared with venom.""Now, just see here, Charlotte,"" cried Mother Fisher, casting aside the flannel petticoats to look up, ""you must just put your mind off from all this; I should never know you, my girl, you are always so sensible and quiet. Why, Charlotte, what has gotten into you?""""That's just it,"" cried Charlotte, a pink passion in her sallow cheeks, ""everybody thinks because I don't rant every day, that I haven't any more feeling than a stick or a stone. Oh! do excuse me, Mrs. Fisher, but I love Polly so!"" And she flung herself down on her knees, burying her face among the little flannel petticoats in Mother Fisher's lap.""Certainly not; and she's no more likely to marry him than you are,"" said Mrs. Fisher coolly, giving gentle pats to Charlotte's head, while King Fisher screamed and twitched his mother's gown in anger to see the petting going on.""Well, now I have two babies,"" said Mother Fisher, with a smile, lifting him up to her lap, where he amused himself by beating on Charlotte's head with both fat fists, till his mother seized them with one hand, while she gently smoothed the girl's hair with the other. ""Polly can be trusted anywhere; and when she is in too much of a dilemma, then she brings everything to mother.""""Charlotte, I don't mind telling you that I am dreadfully sorry that Grandpapa has taken Jasper away from his business."" She sat King Fisher abruptly on the floor, all the little petticoats tumbling after him, and walked away so that Charlotte could not see her face. ""Poor Jasper, he loved his work so.""""And that's just it,"" gasped Charlotte, somehow finding her feet to hurry over to Mrs. Fisher, ""Jasper has lost his work, and now oh dear!--oh! can't you see, Mrs. Fisher""--and then frightened at her boldness, she ran back to Baby.""Charlotte Chatterton!"" exclaimed Mrs. Fisher. There was something so dreadful in her tone, that Charlotte, without a word, ran out of the room--to meet little Dr. Fisher hurrying upstairs with his hands full of letters. ""A whole budget from Brierly,"" he announced joyfully; ""two for you, my girl,"" casting them into her hands. ""And the folks are coming home next week; that is, our folks--good news--eh, Charlotte?"" then he sped on to find his wife.And at dinner Charlotte, sitting pale and immovable amidst all the chat, let the news of Mr. and Mrs. Mason Whitney's and Dick's determination to come on to greet the arrivals from the Brierly farmhouse, fall on apparently unheeding ears.""Adoniram,"" exclaimed Mrs. Fisher across the table, for the first time in her life looking as if she would like to step on his toes. The little doctor stared at her a moment--""Oh--er--never mind, my dear,"" he cried abruptly, turning to Charlotte. ""I suppose you do not feel well.""""I have a letter from Mr. King--a very long one; he is going to see Joel and David,"" Mother Fisher made haste to say; ""I hope he hasn't heard anything wrong about them,"" and a little anxious pucker came on her forehead."
"""And now,"" said Mother Fisher, dropping her arms and resuming her usual cheery manner, ""you and I, Charlotte, have got to put our minds on getting ready for the Whitneys and the home-coming, and we must make it just the brightest time that ever was. I'm no good at thinking up ways to celebrate,"" added Mrs. Fisher, with a little laugh, ""Polly always did that; so you must do it for me, you and the doctor, Charlotte. And you better run in to his office now and make a beginning, for next week will come before we know it,"" and with a motherly pat, and a ""run along, child,"" Mrs. Fisher waited to see Charlotte well on the way before she turned to her own duties.""Come in!"" cried little Dr. Fisher, as she rapped at the office door. ""Oh, it's you, Charlotte,"" with a sigh of relief; ""I'm sure I don't feel much like dragging on my boots and going off to the Land's End to-night, on a call.""""Mrs. Fisher thought I ought to come and see you, sir, about getting up a plan to celebrate the home-coming next week,"" said Charlotte, feeling her heart bounding already with delight. Would they really all be together in a week?""Now that's something like,"" exclaimed Dr. Fisher joyfully, and pushing aside with a reckless hand his books and vials on the table; ""sit down, do, Charlotte; there,"" as Charlotte settled her long figure in the opposite chair. ""Now then!""""Nor I either,"" confessed the little doctor in an equal tremor, ""Polly was always great at those things. But I suppose that's the reason my wife set us two together, Charlotte, for she's the wisest of women, and perhaps we ought to learn how to get up celebrations.""""How would it do,"" asked Charlotte suddenly, ""to invite everybody after they have gotten over the first of the home-coming--after dinner, I mean--into the drawing-room, and then tell them that we are not smart enough to think up things, and ask them to give a recitation apiece, or something of that sort?""""You'll sing,"" declared the little doctor decidedly, ""we could never be tired of hearing you; and for the rest, I have a notion that this might suit. See here,"" and he threw himself into his office chair, and looked Charlotte squarely in the face, ""why not ask Alexia and Cathie and the others, to take hold and get up some fandango--eh?""""It might be the best thing in the world,"" said Charlotte slowly. ""Those girls act splendidly; they've had little plays so often, and Polly has drilled them, that they'll know just how to go to work, and it will please Polly. Oh, yes, do let us have that,"" she cried, beginning to wax quite enthusiastic.""That's good!"" cried Dr. Fisher, bringing his hands together with a joyful clap; and getting out of his chair he began to skip up and down like a boy. ""And let Amy Loughead do the piano music, do; that will please Polly to see how the child has gone ahead. I can't hardly believe Miss Salisbury; she tells me the chit practices every minute she can save from other things. Be sure to have her asked, Charlotte, child.""""And you are to sing,"" cried the little doctor jubilantly. ""Now we are all capitally fixed. It takes you and me to get up celebrations, doesn't it?"" and he stood as tall as he could and beamed at her. ""I'd go over as early as I could, Charlotte,"" he advised, ""and tell those girls, because you know a week isn't much to get ready in.""And after breakfast, the next morning, she tied her hat on, and not trusting herself to think of her expedition, actually ran down the long carriage drive to the avenue--then walking at her best pace, she stood before Alexia Rhys' door and rang the bell.""There, now, I can't go back,"" she said to herself, and in a minute or two she was in the reception room, and Alexia Rhys was running over the stairs and standing with a puzzled expression on her face, before her."
"""Yes,"" said Charlotte Chatterton, ""I came to ask if you would get up something nice to celebrate the home-coming of all the family from Brierly; and Mr. Whitney's family are to come too, next week. Will you, Miss Rhys?""""I didn't at first,"" said Charlotte Chatterton, ""but I do now, Miss Rhys--oh! very much, you and Miss Harrison, and all those girls--you can get up something beautiful; and Dr. Fisher and I don't in the least know how, and we want you to do it."" Then she sat quite still.""Well, I declare!"" cried Alexia Rhys, unable to find another word. Then she looked out of the window. ""Oh, here's Clem,"" and, rushing out, Charlotte could hear a whispered consultation with, ""Did you ever?"" and ""I'm awfully ashamed,"" while Clem's voice said, ""So am I.""""I'm awfully ashamed, Miss Chatterton,"" said Clem Forsythe, going straight to Charlotte's chair and putting out her hand; ""we girls haven't been right to you since you came, and I, for one, want to ask your pardon.""A tall figure sprawled in the biggest chair, his long legs carried up to the mantel, where his boots neatly reposed; while a cloud of smoke filling the room, made Mr. King cough violently in spite of himself.""'Tis a nasty air,"" said the tall young man, getting his legs down in haste from the mantel, and himself out of the chair, though with much difficulty; ""take a glass of water, sir,"" hobbling over to a side table, and pouring one out, to work his way with it to old Mr. King.""Thank you,"" said the old gentleman, when he could speak, and accepting it quickly, ""you say truly, the air is beastly,"" glancing around the room in displeasure at the plentiful signs of its inmates' idea of having a good time at college. ""Are Joel and David Pepper soon to be in?"" As he spoke, he lifted up the cover of a French novel thrown on the lounge near him, and dropped it quickly as he read the title.""I should rather think we had,"" said Bingley, ""why, all of us know about you, sir."" Here he got out of his chair again. ""You won't care to, after you know all, but I should like to shake hands with you, sir.""""Most certainly,"" responded the old gentleman heartily, ""although your room isn't to your credit."" Thereupon he bestowed a courtly hand-shake upon the young man, with the utmost cordiality, making Bingley, who seemed to have a good deal of trouble with his legs, to retreat to his chair in a high state of satisfaction.""It was mean of me to ask you such a favor, sir,"" said Bingley, gazing up at the ceiling, ""before I had told you all, but I couldn't help it, some way, and I knew you wouldn't touch my hand after you'd heard. Well, I was one of a gang who went to Joe Pepper's room last week for the purpose of lamming him.""""See here, now,"" cried that individual, tearing his gaze from the ceiling, to send a sharp glance at the white-haired old gentleman, ""Joe is all right; straight as a brick. You can bet your money on that, sir.""""Oh--oh!"" cried Mr. King, more and more horrified, ""is this what you all come to college for? I should consider, sir,"" very sternly, ""it a place to keep up the dignity of one's family in, and that of such a venerable institution,"" waving both shapely hands to include the entire pile of buildings by which they were surrounded.""Sit down again, do, sir,"" he begged involuntarily, ""and I will tell you all about it,"" and Mr. King, resuming his chair, presently had a graphic account of Joel's course in college, with a description of the trouble in his room, till the whole thing was laid bare.""How I wish I had been here to see my boy,"" exclaimed the old gentleman, with sparkling eyes; ""I might have helped him a bit."" He stretched out a handsome fist and looked at it as admiringly as any college athlete could view his own. ""Well,"" dropping his arm, ""I am interrupting you, Mr.""--groping for the name."
"""Oh, I'm so sorry,"" mourned Mr. King; ""I have known his father ever since we were boys; he's capital stock. Well, go on, Mr. Bingley, and let me know what this young rascal is up to,"" he added, with extreme irritation.""He is going to have his men close in on Joe in the middle of the park. Pepper often comes that way to 'Old Brick'--short, you know, for 'Old Brick Dormitory'--with a poor miserable cuss--excuse me, sir--he's trying to get up on to sober legs. There are twenty fellows pledged to do the job, I've found out.""""Ah!"" Old Mr. King sat quite straight. ""Thank you, Mr. Bingley,"" he said, getting out of his chair. He didn't offer to shake hands, and Bingley, though pretending not to notice any omission of that sort, felt considerably crest-fallen about it.Old Mr. King fumed to himself all the way down the stairs, becoming more angry with each step. When he reached the lower hall he turned and passed through the building instead of going out, and meeting a young collegian on a run, asked, ""Have the goodness to tell me, sir, does Mr. Ingoldsby Dobbs room in this building?""""No. 23-4-5 in the extension,"" said the undergraduate, not slackening speed, and pointing the direction. So the old gentleman climbed the staircase to the wing, and presently rapped on the door marked 23.Uproarious shouts of laughter greeted him as he opened the door in response to a loud ""Come in!"" The noise stopped as suddenly as it was possible for the inmates of the room to check it when they saw the visitor, but not before ""We'll season Pepper well and make the deacon howl!"" came distinctly to his ears.""Good afternoon, young gentlemen,"" said old Mr. King, bowing his white head; and holding his hat in his hand, he advanced to the table, around which sat six or eight of them. ""I beg of you not to go,"" as some of them made a sudden movement to leave; ""I should like to see you all, though I called especially upon Mr. Ingoldsby Dobbs.""A tall, wiry youth with sallow face and high-bred nose, disentangled himself from the group and came forward. ""I don't remember where I have met you, sir,"" he said, yet extending his hand, with his best manner on.""I am very thankful to say I never have met you before, young man,"" observed Mr. King coolly, not seeing the slender hand waiting for his, ""your father honors me with his friendship. This may tell you who I am,"" and he threw a card upon the table.""Glad to see you--sit down, won't you?"" he mumbled, dragging up a comfortable chair. ""Any friend of father's is welcome here,"" he went on awkwardly, while the rest of the men stared at him, one of them exclaiming under his breath, ""First time Dobbs' cheek deserted him, I'll wager.""The old gentleman looked first into Ingoldsby Dobbs' thin face, then surveyed them all quite leisurely. ""I understand you paid my grandson, Joel Pepper, a call a short time since, when instead of abusing him, some of you got your deserts.""Old Mr. King turned on them. ""Silence!"" he commanded. ""My grandson Joel doesn't know I am here. I heard the story since my arrival. If any one says one word against him, I'll cane him from the top of the stairs to the bottom,"" and he looked as if he could do it."
"The old gentleman completely ignored him, addressing his words to the crowd. ""There are four men in this class who are going to be protected from your insults. Those are my three grandsons and Mr. Robert Bingley; and this is to be done without appealing to the college authorities either. That puts a stop to your fine plan, Mr. Dobbs,"" at last looking at him, ""and any other idea of the same sort your fertile brain may chance to think up. The first intimation of any hostility, and your father and the fathers of these men here with you,"" waving his hand at them all, ""and of the others in this interesting plan, will be informed, and you will be dealt with exactly like any other disturber of the peace--villains in college or out of it ought to be served to the same punishment, in my opinion. Now have any of you remarks to make?""For the first time in her life Phronsie seemed unable to answer Polly, and she stood quite still, her gaze fastened on the big-flowered muslin curtain that swung back and forth in the breeze that came through the open window.""Mamsie wouldn't ever allow you to be annoyed about anything,"" said Polly, with increasing irritation, ""and if Mrs. Cabot has said anything to you, Phronsie, to make you feel badly, why, I must know it. Don't you see, child, that I really ought to be told?""Phronsie folded her hands tightly together, trying to keep them quiet, and her cheeks turned so very white that Polly hastened to put her well arm around her, saying quickly, ""There, there, child, you needn't tell me now if you don't want to. Wait a bit.""""What perfect nonsense!"" exclaimed Polly, recovering herself, and trying to laugh, ""well, Phronsie, child, didn't you know better than to believe any story that Mrs. Cabot might tell? How in the world could she know of Jasper's affairs, pray tell?"" and she laughed again, this time quite gaily.""Ah, but,"" said Phronsie, shaking her head, ""she had a letter from Mr. Cabot; it came in this morning's mail; she opened it and said out loud this dreadful thing about Jasper, and then she saw me, and she said I was not to tell you.""""I am going to make Mrs. Cabot tell me everything she knows,"" said Polly hoarsely, and not looking back; ""she shall let me have every syllable. It can't be true!"" She threw wide the door of Mrs. Higby's ""keeping-room"" where that lady was engaged in putting a patch on the chintz-covered sofa, and talking gossip with a neighbor at the same time.""I thought as this was a-going so fast, Mr. Higby sets it out so, and we were all so comfortable to-day, I'd get at it kinder early,"" said Mrs. Higby apologetically; ""anything I can do, Miss Polly?"" she asked, flying away from her patch, and dropping her scissors on the floor.""Now 'twas something you wanted me for,"" cried Mrs. Higby, ambling toward the door, ""I ain't a mite busy, Miss Polly; that old patch can wait. La! I can tell Mr. Higby to set on the other end till I get time to attend to it. What was it, Miss Polly?""""I don't know a thing about it,"" cried Mrs. Cabot in a frightened way, ""only Mr. Cabot writes that Mr. King has made Jasper leave Mr. Marlowe. That's all I know about it, Polly,"" she added desperately, ""and I wish Mr. Cabot had been asleep before he wrote it. Phronsie, oh! get a glass of water; be quick, child!"" as Polly sank down on the old stone floor of the porch."
"""Well, if I didn't know that in a year's time Jasper will come to me and say, 'I thank you!' I should never have gone through with the job in the world,"" said his father, when he came out of his amusement. ""It isn't the pleasantest piece of work a man could select, 'to meddle,' as you call it, with another's affairs.""His father laughed again, and leaned out of his chair to pinch his son's ear, but Dick, resenting this indignity, retreated to a safe position, declaring, ""And I'm going to be one when I'm through college--so!""""Dear me, Polly,"" exclaimed Mrs. Cabot, before Mrs. Higby could answer, and putting shaking hands on Polly's shoulders, ""I never was so frightened in my life! I thought your arm was worse--and you so near well! O, dear! are you sure you are right?"" peering around into her face. ""Here comes Phronsie with the water--that's good!""Polly took the glass and smiled up reassuringly into Phronsie's troubled face. ""Oh! how good that is, Phronsie,"" she cried. ""There now, I'm all right. Don't let Grandpapa or Jasper know,"" and she sprang to her feet, while Mrs. Higby hurried off to see if her preparations for dinner were all right, now that Mr. King had come back a day sooner than he wrote he intended.""Phronsie, you go and meet them; do, dear,"" begged Polly; and as Phronsie ran off obediently, Polly walked up and down the porch with hasty steps, holding her hands as tightly locked together as the injured arm would allow. ""Oh! if I only had time to think--but I ought to try, even if I don't say just exactly the right words, for Mr. Marlowe may not be able to take him back if I wait,"" and then Grandpapa came hurrying out with, ""Where's Polly?"" and she was kissed and her cheeks patted--he not seeming to notice anything amiss in her--he was so glad to get back; and through it all, Polly saw only Jasper's face, and, although everything seemed to turn around before her, she made up her mind that she would tell Grandpapa just what she thought, and beg him to change his mind, the very first instant she could.And so, before the first greetings of the homecoming were fairly over, Polly, afraid her courage would give out if she waited a moment longer, put her hand on Mr. King's arm. ""What is it, dear?"" asked the old gentleman, busy with Phronsie, who hung around his neck, while she tried to tell him everything that had happened during his absence; and he peered over her shoulder into Polly's face.""So you shall, Phronsie,"" declared old Mr. King, drawing her off beyond Polly's reach. ""There, now you and I will get into this quiet corner,"" and he sat down and drew Phronsie to his knee. ""Now, Pet, so you are glad to get your old Grandpapa home, eh?""Polly, in an agony at being misunderstood, followed, and without stopping to think, she threw her arms around Phronsie and cried, ""O, Phronsie! do trust me, dear, and let Grandpapa go. I must see him now!""Mr. King gave Polly's burning cheeks a keen glance, then he set Phronsie on the floor abruptly. ""Phronsie, see, dear, Polly really needs me. Come, child,"" and he gathered up Polly's hand into his own, and marched out of the room with her."
"Polly, not caring where she went, but with the words she must speak weighing heavily on her mind, followed him unsteadily into the parlor, and while he threw open a blind or two to light up the gloom that usually hung over Mrs. Higby's best room, she busied herself trying to think how she should begin.""There, now, my dear,"" said Mr. King, coming up to her, and drawing her off to a big haircloth sofa, standing stiffly against the wall, ""we will sit down here, and then we can go over it comfortably together and settle what is on your mind,"" he added, feeling immensely gratified at the impending confidence.""Grandpapa,"" cried Polly in desperation, and springing from the sofa, where he had placed her by his side, to stand in front of him, ""I don't know where to begin. Oh! do help me."" She clasped her hands, and stood the picture of distress, unable to say another word.Polly started at his tone of reproach, and threw her well arm around his neck, exactly as Phronsie would have done, which so pleased the old gentleman that it was easier for her to begin again to tell him what was on her mind. But when she had gotten as far as ""It's just this""--she stopped again.""Well, now, Polly,"" said Mr. King, sitting straight on the sofa, with displeasure, ""I must say, I am surprised at you. I should never think this was you, Polly, never in all the world,"" which so unnerved her, that she plunged at once into what she had set herself to do, saying the most dreadful thing that was possible.""Hoity-toity! Well, I must say, Polly,"" exclaimed the old gentleman in the greatest displeasure, and rising abruptly from the sofa, brushing her aside as he did so, ""that I never have been so surprised in my life, as to have you come to teach me my duty. Right? Of course it is--it must be, if I wish it. I have always looked out for Jasper's good,"" with that he walked up and down the parlor, fuming at every step, and looking so very dreadful, that Polly, rooted to the spot, had only to stand still, and watch him in despair.""If you could have seen Jasper, the way he was when I found him,"" said Mr. King, tired at last of vituperating, and coming up to Polly sternly, ""you would be glad to have me get him out of the wretched business. It smelt so of trade, and everybody was grossly familiar; while that Mr. Marlowe--I have no words for him, Polly. He insulted me.""""Jasper's ideas of what a gentleman should be, and mine, are very different,"" exploded the old gentleman, beginning to walk up and down the parlor again. ""I tell you, Polly, that my boy is sadly changed since he went into that contemptible trade.""""Loves his work? Well, he shouldn't,"" cried Mr. King in extreme irritation. ""It's no sort of a work for him to love, brought up as he has been. A profession is the only thing for him. Now he studies law""--""O, Grandpapa!"" cried Polly, quite white now, and she precipitated herself in front of the old gentleman's angry feet, ""Jasper just hates the law. I know, for he has often said so; and if you do fasten him down all his life to what he don't like, and make him be a lawyer, it will kill him. He'll do it, Grandpapa""--Polly rushed on, regardless of the lightning gleam of anger in the sharp eyes above her; and, although she knew that after this she should never be the same Polly to him as of old, she kept on steadily--""because you want him to; he'll do anything to please you, and make you happy, Grandpapa, and he won't say anything, but it will kill him; it surely will, for he loves his work with Mr. Marlowe so."" Then Polly stopped, aghast at the effect of her words."
"""He shall never go back to Mr. Marlowe with my consent,"" declared the old gentleman stiffly, his anger rising again, ""and you have displeased me very much, Polly Pepper, by all this. Now you may go; and remember, not another word about Jasper and his work. I will arrange everything concerning him without interference."" And Polly, not knowing how crept out of Mrs. Higby's parlor, and shut the door.""Polly!"" somebody called, as she hurried on unsteady feet over the stairs to her own little room that she had begged under the farmhouse eaves. But she didn't even answer, only rushed on, and locked the door behind her. Then she threw herself on her knees by the bed, and buried her face in her hands. This was worse than the day so long ago when she sat in the old rocking-chair in the little brown house, with eyes bound closely to shut out all outside things; and all of them had been afraid she was going to be blind. For now she felt sure that she had spoiled whatever chance there might have been for Jasper. ""Oh! why did I speak--why did I?"" she cried, over and over in her distress, as she buried her face deeper yet in Mrs. Higby's gay patch bedquilt.After a while--Polly never could tell how long she had staid there--somebody rapped at the door. It was Phronsie; and she cried in a grieved little voice, ""Polly, are you here? I've been under the apple-trees--and just everywhere for you. Do let me in.""And then the dinner-bell rang, and Polly, who was never known to be late at a meal, heard Mrs. Higby come out into the hall again, and shake the big bell till it seemed to fill the whole farmhouse with its noise.""Oh! I can't go down--I can't!"" moaned poor Polly to herself, quite lost to everything but the dreadful distress at the mischief she had wrought. And then Phronsie came again, this time imploring, with tears--for Polly felt quite sure that she could hear her crying--that Polly would only open the door, ""and let me see you just once, Polly!""""I don't want any dinner,"" said Polly over and over. ""I just must be alone a little while,"" and at last she spoke quickly to Mrs. Cabot's persistent pleadings, ""Have the goodness, Mrs. Cabot, not to call me again."" And then she was sorry the minute she had spoken the words, and she opened her door a little crack to call after Mrs. Cabot, as she sailed downstairs in great displeasure, ""Oh! do forgive me, dear Mrs. Cabot, for speaking so. I am very sorry, but I cannot come down just yet.""It was in the middle of the afternoon, and Polly, exhausted by weeping, had fallen asleep just where she was, on her knees by the bed, her head on the gay bedquilt, when a low knock on the door startled her and made her rub her eyes and listen.""What, Polly?"" he cried, trying not to show how he felt at sight of the swollen eyelids and downcast face. Meanwhile he drew her out gently into the hall. ""There, let us sit down here,"" pausing before the wide window-seat; ""it's quiet here, and nobody will be likely to come here."" He waited till Polly sat down, then made a place for himself beside her."
"""O, Jasper! I thought perhaps I could help you. I never knew till this morning, just before you came, that you had lost your place. Mrs. Cabot had a letter from her husband, and she told me. And I spoke to Grandpapa and begged him to let you go back, and, O, Jasper!"" here Polly's tears, despite all her efforts to keep them back, fell in a shower, ""you can't guess how dreadfully Grandpapa feels, and he says--oh! he says that you are to study law, and never, never go back to Mr. Marlowe."" ""So I do love my work,"" cried Jasper in a glow, ""but, Polly,"" and he sprang to his feet and walked away so that she couldn't see his face, ""I thought that you were going to say something about yourself.""""I shall have to go,"" said Jasper, drawing his breath hard, and looking at her steadily. ""You know you yourself told me long ago to make my father happy any way, Polly."" He smiled as he emphasized the last word.""Polly!"" exclaimed Jasper, in such a tone that she stopped to look at him in astonishment. ""There, now, I'll tell you all about it,"" he added with his usual manner, and sitting down beside her again, ""and then you'll see that nothing on earth made any difference to father. This was the way of it,"" and Jasper proceeded to lay before her every detail of Mr. King's visit to him, and all the circumstances at the store, not omitting Mr. Whitney's part in the affair, as shown by the letter that Jasper had seen.""Oh! Mason thought he was doing me the greatest favor in the world, I don't doubt,"" answered Jasper. ""You know, Polly, he never could bear to hear of the publishing business, and he was so disappointed when I wouldn't go into the law.""""I think so,"" said Jasper, with a laugh; feeling surprisingly light-hearted, it was so beautiful to be talking it all over with Polly, ""but the trouble is, Mason don't. Well, and then came that dreadful misunderstanding about Mr. Marlowe; that hurt me worse than all. O, Polly! if you only knew the man,"" and Jasper relapsed into gloom once more.""No,"" said Jasper, ""absolutely nothing. When father once makes up his mind about anything, it's made up for all time. I must just lose the friendship of that man, as well as my place."" With that his gloom deepened, and Polly, feeling powerless to utter a word, slipped her hand within his as it lay on his knee.""O, Polly!"" and she threw her arms hungrily around Polly and hugged her closely. ""O, dear!"" letting her arms fall, ""I wasn't to stop a minute. Grandpapa wants you to drive with him, Polly, and you are to go right down as soon as you get your hat on."""
"""Oh! I couldn't eat a morsel,"" protested Polly from her little room, ""and don't ask Grandpapa to wait an instant, whatever you do, Phronsie. See, I'm ready,"" and she ran out into the hall, putting on her hat as she spoke.But when she came out to the back piazza, Phronsie following her with the glass, and begging her to drink up the rest left in it, old Mr. King, standing by the little old-fashioned chaise, received her exactly as if nothing had happened.""Well, I declare, Polly,"" he said, turning to her with a smile, ""I never saw anybody get ready so quickly as you can. There, hop in, child,"" and he put aside her dress from the wheel in his most courtly manner possible.All sorts of things Mr. King talked of in the cheeriest manner possible, just as if Polly and he were in the habit of taking a drive like this every morning; and he never seemed to notice her swollen eyelids, or whether she answered, but kept on bravely with the conversation. At last Polly, at something he said, laughed in her old merry fashion; then Mr. King drew a long breath, and relaxed his efforts.""I declare, Polly,"" he said, leaning back in a comfortable way against the old cushion, and allowing the neighbor's horse, hired for the occasion, to amble along in its own fashion, ""now we are so cosy, I believe I'll tell you a secret.""""Yes; about as far as---say, well, to the place where Jasper has been all winter. The fact is, Polly,"" went on Mr. King very rapidly, as if with the fear that if he stopped he would not be able to finish at all, ""I want you to look over the ground--Jasper's work, I mean. It seems an abominable place to me--a perfectly abominable one,"" confided the old gentleman in a burst of feeling, ""but there,"" pulling himself up, ""maybe I'm not the one to say it. You see, Polly, I never did a stroke of work in my life, and I really can't tell how working-places ought to look. And I suppose a working man like Mr. Marlowe might be different from me, and yet be a decent sort of a person, after all. Well, will you go?"" he asked abruptly.""There--there, Polly, child,"" said the old gentleman, ""no more of that, else we shall have a scene, and that's what I never did like, dear, you know. Well, will you go with me--you haven't said yes yet.""""Well, I much rather have you here in this carriage with me,"" said the old gentleman composedly. ""Now that's settled that we are going, Polly. Of course I asked the doctor; I sent down a letter to him after dinner, to ask if your arm would let you take a little journey with me, and of course he said 'yes,' like a sensible man. Why shouldn't he, pray tell--when we were all going home in a day or two? Now, of course, that must be postponed a bit.""""Now, Polly,"" Mr. King shifted his position a bit, so that he might see her the better, ""perhaps Mr. Marlowe won't take Jasper back. Judging from what I know of the man, I don't think he will,"" and the old gentleman's face, despite his extreme care, began to look troubled at once.""Well, we'll start early to-morrow morning on our little trip, Polly,"" said the old gentleman, catching her infectious spirit, and giving the old horse a fillip with the whip. ""Meantime, not a word, my dear, of our little plan!""And the next morning, although everybody was nearly devoured by curiosity, no one dared to ask questions; so old Mr. King and Polly, with two well-filled portmanteaus, departed for a journey of apparently a few days; and Polly didn't dare to trust herself alone with Jasper, but ran a race with him around all the angles of the old farmhouse, always cleverly disappearing with a merry laugh when there was the least chance of his overtaking her and cornering her for an explanation.And Pickering Dodge, in his invalid chair drawn close to the window, heard the merry preparations for the journey, and fretfully declared ""that people seem to be happy, with never a thought for a poor dog like me,"" while old Mr. Loughead, who, despite Doctor Bryce's verdict, had never seemed quite well enough in his own estimation for his departure from the ""Higby hospital,"" on the contrary brightened up, exclaiming, ""Now, that is something like--to hear Miss Polly laugh like that--bless her!""""Good-by to you, my boy,"" said Mr. King, laying a soft palm over the thin fingers on Pickering's knee. ""Now see that you get up a little more vigor by the time we are back. Goodness! all you want is a trifle more backbone. Why, an old fellow like me would beat you there, I do believe. I am surprised at you,"" cried the old gentleman, shaking his fingers at Mr. Loughead, with whom he was on the best of terms, but never feeling the necessity to weigh his words, ""that you, being chief nurse, don't set up with that boy and make him get on his feet quicker."""
"""So I could do,"" cried old Mr. Loughead, whose chief object in life since Pickering had been pronounced out of danger, had been to browbeat the trained nurse, and usurp the authority in Pickering's sick-room, ""if Mrs. Cabot would keep out, or take it into her head to return home. To state it mildly,"" continued the old gentleman, not lowering his tone in the least, ""that lady doesn't seem to be gifted with the qualities of a nurse. Providence never intended that she should be one, in my opinion.""""Well, Amy, child,"" cried Jack, when they had gone through with the preliminaries always religiously observed on his visits: how she had progressed in her music under the new teacher Miss Pepper had recommended during her enforced absence, and how far she had pleased Miss Salisbury, and all the other things an elder brother who had come to his conscience rather late, would be apt to look into. ""And so you really think you are getting on in your practice?""""That's shabby in me,"" declared Jack, with remorse; and getting off the sofa, to his feet, he dutifully spread the music on the rack, and paid his little sister such attention, that she was soon smilingly launched into the new piece, and lost to everything else but her own melody.So the two turned their backs on the piano; and pretty soon, Amy, her hand in her brother's big brown palm, was nestled up against him, and hearing a confidence that made her small soul swell with delight.""Amy,"" said Jack, putting his arm closer around her, ""when Miss Pepper had the courage to tell me of my duty to you, I made up my mind that you should never want for anything that my hand could supply.""""And I never have,"" cried little Amy, poking her head up from its nest to look at him. ""All the girls say you are just splendid to me; that they never saw such a brother; and I don't believe they ever did, Jack,"" she added proudly.""So now, what I am about to do,"" said Jack, speaking with great effort, ""isn't to bring anything but the greatest happiness to you, Amy, as well as to me. If only I can secure it!"" he added under his breath.""What are you going to do, Jack?"" demanded Amy, springing away from him to stare into his bronzed face. ""Oh! I know; you are going to Europe again, and will take me this time--oh! goody, goody!"" She screamed like a child, clapping her hands gaily.""Hush, Amy,"" cried Jack, trying to speak lightly, ""or Miss Salisbury will come in, and send me off, saying I spoil your manners. There, come back here to me; I can talk better then,"" and he drew her to his side again. ""No, it is something much more beautiful than any trip to Europe would be.""This time Amy sprang to the middle of the floor of Miss Salisbury's small reception-room. ""Marry you, Brother Jack!"" she screamed. ""Oh! how perfectly elegant! It's too lovely for anything--oh! my darling Miss Pepper,"" and so on, till Jack couldn't make her hear a word.""I know it,"" said Amy, stopping instantly, and creeping humbly back to the sofa; ""Miss Pepper was always telling me how to stop screaming at everything I liked; and not to cry at things I didn't like,"" she confessed frankly."
"""I thought so,"" said Jack. ""Well, now, Amy, I must tell you that I went to see Mrs. Fisher to-day, to ask her if I may speak to Miss Pepper. And she gives me full permission; and so I shall go to Brierly to-morrow, and try my fate.""""Of course it has,"" cried Alexia gustily. ""Dear me,"" in a tone of horror, ""did you suppose that we'd let Polly Pepper go on year after year getting up perfectly elegant things for us, and then we not celebrate for her, when she comes home, and with a broken arm, too? The idea, Clem!""""Alexia, you are enough to drive anybody wild,"" cried Sally Moore; ""it's bad enough to know there isn't an idea in all our heads put together, without having you tell us of it every minute. Cathie Harrison, why don't you say something, instead of staring that wall out of countenance?""""I don't know in the least how to help,"" said Charlotte Chatterton slowly, and leaning her elbows on her knees she rested her head in her hands. ""I never got up a play or tableau, nor anything of the kind in my life; and we never celebrated anything either; there was never anything to celebrate--but I should think perhaps it would be better not to try to do great things.""""Why, Miss Chatterton,"" exclaimed Alexia Rhys, in great disapproval, and starting forward in the pretty pink-trimmed basket chair. ""I'm perfectly surprised at you--nothing can be too good for Polly Pepper. We must get up something perfectly magnificent, or else I shall die!"" she cried tragically.""Nothing can be too good for Polly,"" repeated Charlotte, taking her head out of her hands and looking at Alexia, ""but isn't it better not to try to be too grand, and have something simple, because, whatever we do, Polly must always have had things so much nicer.""Charlotte gave a short laugh, but with a little bitter edge to it. Why would the girls who now seemed to be so glad to have her in the center of all their plans, persist in calling her Miss Chatterton? It gave her a chill every time, and she fairly hated the name.""And now since we are going to follow your advice,"" went on Alexia, ""be so good as to tell us a little bit more. Now what shall we do in the way of a simple, appropriate fandango--a perfect idyl of a thing, you know?""""At Christmas ages ago, when special honor was done to entertain the King wherever he was lodged,"" went on Charlotte, ""there was a Lord of Misrule, who gathered together a company of ladies and gentlemen, who rummaged the old castles for grotesque costumes and furbelows. And then masked, they all came in and marched before the King, and danced, oh--everything--we might have Minuets and Highland Flings, and all the rest. And they did everything the Lord of Misrule directed, and""--There was a little pause. ""Oh! we didn't know as you'd like it,"" broke in Alexia hastily, ""you are so tall, and you never seem in a hurry, nor as if you cared a straw about being like a girl, and we didn't dare. But now, oh, Charlotte--Charlotte!"" And she gave her a hug that well repaid Charlotte for all the past.""If Charlotte can breathe after that,"" said Clem, turning on Charlotte a pair of glowing eyes, ""she'll do well. We are just as glad to call you Charlotte, aren't we, girls,"" whirling around on the group, ""as Alexia, for all her bear-hug."""
"""Well, now, girls,"" said Alexia, running over to give Clem a small shake, ""let's to business. There isn't any time to waste. Charlotte Chatterton, will you tell us the rest of it, and who will be the Lord of Misrule?--dear me, if we only had Joel here!""""Let's go and ask him now!"" cried Alexia, who wasn't anything if not energetic; and running to her closet, she picked off her hat from the shelf and tossed it on her head. ""Oh, how slow you are, girls--do hurry!"" as the others flew to the bed where their different head-gear had been thrown.""Bother! supposing it is,"" exclaimed Alexia, in front of her pink-and-white draped mirror, while she ran the long hat pins through her fluffy hair, ""it's as important to take care of us girls, as if we were a lot of patients. We shall be, if we don't get this fixed. Come on, girls!"" she seized a lace scarf from some mysterious corner, and pranced to the door, shaking her gloves at the group.""Oh! dear--dear, it's perfectly dreadful to be with such good people! There, now, Charlotte, don't look like that,"" rushing up to the tall girl and standing on tiptoe to drop a kiss on the sallow cheek--""we won't go; we'll stay at home and be martyrs,"" and she began to tear off her hat with a tragic air.Doctor Fisher's office hours were not only over, but the little doctor assured one and all of the eager group that precipitated themselves upon him, that nothing would give him greater delight than to be a Lord of Misrule at the celebration to be gotten up for the home-coming.""And it's a very appropriate way to celebrate, my dears,"" he said, beaming at them over his large spectacles; ""for it will be for the coming of the King; King by name as well as nature,"" and he laughed enjoyably at his own pun. ""And I'm sure nobody ever did rule his kingdom so well as our Grandpapa. So let's have a splendid mummery, or masquing, or whatever you call it; and in my opinion, you were very smart to think it up.""""Now, Polly,"" exclaimed old Mr. King, drawing her back an instant before stepping into Farmer Higby's big carryall, waiting at the station as the train came in, ""you mustn't even look as if you had any secret on your mind--oh, come now, that won't do, my dear,"" turning her around to study the dancing eyes and rosy cheeks. ""I can't take you home looking like that, I really can't, my dear.""""Well, you must be careful to keep away from everybody as much as you can,"" he whispered, as he helped her into the ancient vehicle, ""and whatever you do, don't say much to Jasper, or you'll surely let the whole thing out,"" and he got in beside her. ""There, drive on, do, Mr. Higby.""""You'll tell Jasper that he is to go back to Mr. Marlowe?"" Polly leaned over and was guilty of whispering behind Farmer Higby's broad back. ""Oh, Grandpapa! you won't keep him waiting to know that, will you?"" she begged anxiously."
"""No; that shall be at once, as soon as I see my boy,"" replied the old gentleman; ""but, the rest, Polly; how Mr. Marlowe is coming to look in upon us at our own home, and to meet us the very evening we arrive--that's to be kept as dark as possible.""""For if I can't have the surprise party I started for,"" declared the old gentleman to himself, ""I'll have a jollification at the other end."" So he had telegraphed to Mrs. Fisher an additional message to his many letters, all on the same subject--""Have what celebration you like, and invite whom you like. And let it be gay, for the College boys have got leave, and they bring a friend.""And at such intervals when he could take his mind from Jasper and his affairs, it afforded Mr. King infinite delight to tap a certain letter in his breast pocket, that opened, might have revealed in bold characters, a great deal of gratitude for his kindness in inviting the writer on with Joel, which was gladly accepted and signed Robert Bingley.""Goodness me! couldn't they go fishing any other day?"" cried the old gentleman irascibly. ""Well, I suppose there's no help for it. Ah! Loughead, that you?"" extending a cordial hand to the tall figure waiting at the end of the porch till the family greetings were over; ""glad to see you.""Mrs. Cabot, who evidently did not regard him in the friendliest of lights, turned her back upon him, keeping her arm around Polly. ""Pickering is waiting to see you,"" she said, and trying to draw her off.So Polly, despite Mrs. Cabot's calls ""Come, Polly,"" nodded to Grandpapa, who said, ""All right, child, don't be gone long,"" and moved off with Jack Loughead ""down the lane,"" fresh with spring blossoms and gay with bird songs.""I don't know how,"" said Jack Loughead, after a moment's pause, during which Polly had lifted her face to look at him wonderingly, ""to tell you. I have never been among ladies, and my mother died when I was fifteen; since that I have been working hard, and known no other life. You have been so kind to Amy,"" he said suddenly, as if there were a refuge in the words.""Oh!"" cried Polly, with cheeks aflame, ""don't make me think of that time. How could I speak so, and to you, who know so much more of duty than I ever could imagine? Pray forget it, Mr. Loughead,"" she begged.""For--for, I do like you so much--so very much,"" cried poor Polly, wishing the birds wouldn't sing so loud. ""You have taught me so much, oh, so much, I can't tell you, Mr. Loughead, about being true and noble, and""--""Jasper,"" said Mrs. Cabot in great irritation, when Jasper and Phronsie wandered into Mrs. Farmer Higby's neat kitchen a half-hour later, with torn garments and muddy shoes, ""they got home while you were away, and that tiresome Mr. Loughead came a little before them; and he made Polly go to walk with him; actually made her!"" Mrs. Cabot leaned her jeweled hands on Mrs. Higby's spotless pine table, and regarded him in great distress.""One thing, King,"" said Jack gratefully, ""will you have an eye to my uncle? He won't come with me now, but insists on going with your father who kindly invited us both to go home with you all. And when he is ready, just telegraph me and I will meet him at New York.""""You have been so very good to us,"" continued Phronsie, shaking her yellow head decidedly. ""I love you, Mrs. Higby, very much indeed."" With that she clasped the farmer's wife around her stout waist and held her closely."
"""I've come in here,"" said Phronsie, reflectively peering around at the spotless kitchen floor, ""with muddy boots on and spoiled it; and I've talked when you wanted to weigh out things, and make cake, and once, don't you remember, Mrs. Higby, I left the pantry door open and the cat got in and ate up part of the custard pudding.""""You're not old,"" cried Phronsie, wriggling enough out of Mrs. Higby's arms to look at the round red cheeks and bright eyes. ""Oh, Mrs. Higby! and you're just as nice!"" With that she clasped her impulsively around the neck. ""And Pickering likes you too, Mrs. Higby,"" continued Phronsie, ""he says you're as good as gold.""""You don't say so!"" cried Mrs. Farmer Higby, intensely gratified; ""well, he's as nice a boy as ever lived, I'm sure, and I'm just as tickled as I can be that that fever was broke up so sudden, for you see, Phronsie, he's got the making of being a right smart man yet.""""Grandpapa is going to have Pickering go home with us,"" said Phronsie, confidentially, and edging away from the farmer's wife to facilitate conversation. ""And he's going to stay at our house with us till he gets nice and strong.""""Well, I'm dreadful glad of that,"" declared Mrs. Higby heartily, ""for that a'nt of his--well, there, Phronsie, she ain't to my taste; she is such a making sort of woman--she comes in here and she wants to make me do this, and do that, till I'm most out of my wits, and I'd like to take my broom and say 'scat' as I do to the cat,"" and a black frown settled on Mrs. Higby's pleasant face.""Oh! she loves him well enough,"" answered Mrs. Higby, ""but she fusses over him so, and wants her way all the same. It would be good if she thought somebody else knew something once in a while,"" and she began to splash in the dish-pan vigorously to make up for lost time, quickly heaping up a pile of dishes to drain on the little old tray.Upstairs Jasper and his father were going over again all the incidents of Mr. King's and Polly's trip, that the old gentleman was willing to communicate, and Jasper, despite his eagerness to know all the whys and wherefores, held himself in check as well as he could, scarcely realizing that he was really to go back to Mr. Marlowe's.And Polly and Mrs. Cabot were busily packing, with the aid of a farmer's daughter who lived near, while Polly, who dearly loved to do it all herself, was forced to stand by and direct matters; and old Mr. Loughead divided his time between stalking out to the piazza where Pickering was slowly pacing back and forth in his ""constitutional,"" to insist that he shouldn't ""walks his legs off,"" and calling Polly from her work, ""just to help me a bit, my dear""--when he got into a tight place over the packing that he insisted should be done by none but his own two hands.And the whole farmhouse was soon thrown into such a bustle and ferment, that any one looking in would have known without the telling, that ""Mr. King's family are going home."" And after a day or so of all this, Farmer Higby carried a wagon-load of trunks down to the little station, and his wife drove the carryall, in the back of which Pickering was carefully tucked with Mrs. Cabot, who insisted on being beside him, and old Mr. Loughead in front--the others of the party merrily following in a large old vehicle of no particular pattern whatever--and before anybody could hardly realize it, the train came rushing in, and there were hurried good-bys, and hand-shakes, and they were off--Phronsie crying as she held to her, ""I wish you were going too, I do, dear Mrs. Higby."" And the farmer and his wife were left on the platform, staring after them with sorry eyes.""Well, now, Phronsie,"" said Mr. King, as they quieted down, and Phronsie turned back after the last look at the little station, ""I think it is time to answer your question, so as to let you go home without anything on your mind.""""And the girls,"" finished Polly, craning her neck to look out the car window at a knot of them restlessly curbing their impatience on the platform as the train moved into the station and--""why, Mamsie. Oh, Jasper! how slow we are!""Pickering Dodge shook his long legs impatiently as he got out of his seat. ""Don't try to help me, Mr. Loughead,"" he said testily, as the old gentleman offered his arm; ""I'm not sick now. No, thanks, I'll go out alone.""""Nonsense!"" exclaimed Jasper, yet feeling his heart bound at the merry din as Polly was surrounded, and the babel of voices waxed louder; for everybody was now out of the car but Pickering and himself--""here we are now,"" as they neared the car step.Alexia Rhys, back on the platform hanging to Polly who had one hand in Mother Fisher's at the expense of all the other girls who couldn't get the chance, looked up and saw Pickering Dodge, and dropping Polly's arm she ran lightly across the stream of passengers and put out her hand."
"Pickering shot her an astonished glance, then he said gratefully, ""Thank you, Alexia,"" and he actually let her help him down the steps, which so astonished her that it took away her breath and left her without a word to say.And the rest was all bustle and confusion--Mr. King declaring it was worse than a boarding-school--everybody talking together--and Jasper ran off to see to the luggage for the whole party, followed by Ben trying to help. And old Mr. Loughead had to be introduced all around, and little Doctor Fisher tried to get them all settled in the carriages, but at last gave it up in despair.And old Turner was waiting at the steps as the carriage rolled up the winding drive, with a monstrous bouquet of his choicest blossoms for Polly, and one exactly like it only a little smaller, for Phronsie; and Prince came rushing out getting in every one's way and nearly devouring Phronsie; and there was King Fisher running away on toddling feet from his nurse to meet them, screaming with all his might; and Mrs. Fargo with Johnny in her arms crowing with delight--all stood on the broad stone porch.And no one ever hinted a suspicion that the college boys were steaming along as fast as they could, for the evening's festivities; and old Mr. King appeared superbly indifferent to the fact that Mr. Marlowe was waiting at a hotel for that hour to arrive; and everybody rushed off to get ready for dinner, with the exception of Polly and Jasper and Phronsie.""No, of course I won't,"" said Polly, with a little laugh, ""but it won't be many weeks, you dear""--this to the piano, as she unwillingly got up from the music-stool, and let Jasper lead her off--""before you and I have all our good times together!""""Isn't it?"" cried Jasper, with feeling, ""there never was anything so nice! Mrs. Fisher, may I sit down by you here?"" and he went over to her where she sat on the sofa--it was the same big comfortable affair where Joel had flung himself, when he declared he could not keep on at school; and where Mamsie had often sat when the children brought her their troubles, declaring it was easier to tell her everything on the roomy, old-fashioned sofa, than anywhere else.""Now isn't this nice!"" breathed Polly, lifting her head out of her mother's lap to look at him on Mamsie's other side. ""Now, Jasper, you begin, and we'll tell her all about it, as we always do, you know, when we get home from places.""""I waited because I thought I ought,"" said Jasper, trying not to speak too quickly. ""It seemed at one time as if you were going to be happy, and I should spoil it, Polly, if I spoke; but now--oh, Polly!"" He put out his hand, and Polly instinctively laid her own warm palm within it. ""Do you think you could love me--I've loved you ever since the Little Brown House days, dear!""Old Mr. King walked proudly down the long drawing-room with Polly on his arm. Everybody was in the highest possible spirits. The Lord of Misrule had made a triumphant entree, covering himself with glory and winning great applause for his long train of masquers; whose costumes if not gotten up on strict historical lines, made up any lack by the variety of other contrivances, each one following his own sweet will in dressing. They had gone through with the minuet and the pantomimes; and Charlotte, in a peaked hat and a big flowered brocade gown rich with tambour lace, had sung ""like a nightingale,"" as more than one declared, and now the room was in a buzz of applause.Old Mr. King took this time to walk up and down the long room with Polly several times quite pompously; and once in a while the little Lord of Misrule would rush up to them, say something very earnest, seize Polly's hand and give it a shake and then dart away; which proceeding Joel would imitate, at such times leaving Robert Bingley to his own devices--until Joel, evidently struck by remorse, would as suddenly fly back and introduce his college friend violently to right and left, to make up for lost time.""That's three times you've introduced me to that girl in blue,"" said Bingley, on one of these occasions, when he could get Joel aside for a minute. ""Do let me alone--I was having a good enough time where I was.""So she hurried across the room as fast as her high-heeled slippers would let her. ""Polly--Polly, did you really like it all?"" she asked breathlessly. ""Oh! dear me, this ruff will be the death of me,"" picking at it with impatient fingers.""Well, it nearly killed us,"" declared Alexia, fanning herself violently, ""and this old ruff will end me. There!"" and she made a little break in the starched affair under her chin, ""that's one degree less of misery."""
