passage
"At the very first of our story, Susy was more than six years old, and Prudy was between three and four. Susy could sew quite well for a girl of her age, and had a stint every day. Prudy always thought it very fine to do just as Susy did, so she teased her mother to let _her_ have some patchwork, too, and Mrs. Parlin gave her a few calico pieces, just to keep her little fingers out of mischief.One morning she sat in her rocking-chair, doing what she thought was a ""_stint_."" She kept running to her mother with every stitch, saying, ""Will that do?"" Her mother was very busy, and said, ""My little daughter must not come to me."" So Prudy sat down near the door, and began to sew with all her might; but soon her little baby sister came along, looking so cunning, that Prudy dropped her needle, and went to hugging her.""O, dear! I wish somebody would pity me!"" But her mother was so busy frying doughnuts that she could not stop to talk much; and the next thing she saw of Prudy she was at the farther end of the room, while her patchwork lay on the spice box.When Mrs. Parlin had finished her doughnuts, she said, ""Pussy, you can't keep still two minutes. Now, if you want to sew this patchwork for grandma's quilt, I'll tell you what I shall do. There's an empty hogshead in the back kitchen, and I'll lift you into that, and you can't climb out. I'll lift you out when your stint is done.""""O, what a funny little house,"" said Prudy, when she was inside; and as she spoke, her voice startled her--it was so loud and hollow. ""I'll talk some more,"" thought she, ""it makes such a queer noise.--'Old Mrs. Hogshead, I thought I'd come and see you, and bring my work. I like your house, ma'am, only I should think you'd want some windows. I s'pose you know who I am, Mrs. Hogshead? My name is Prudy. My mother didn't put me in here because I was a naughty girl, for I haven't done nothing--nor nothing--nor nothing. Do you want to hear some singing?One day the children wanted to go and play in the ""new house,"" which was not quite done. Mrs. Parlin was almost afraid little Prudy might get hurt, for there were a great many loose boards and tools lying about, and the carpenters, who were at work on the house, had all gone away to see some soldiers. But at last she said they might go if Susy would be very careful of her little sister.I dare say Susy meant to watch Prudy with great care, but after a while she got to thinking of something else. The little one wanted to play ""catch,"" but Susy saw a great deal more sport in building block houses.""Now I know ever so much more than you do,"" said Susy. ""I used to wash dishes and scour knives when I was four years old, and that was the time I learned you to walk, Prudy; so you ought to play with me, and be goody.""""Then I will; but them blocks is too big, Susy. If I had _a axe_ I'd chop 'em: I'll go get _a axe_."" Little Prudy trotted off, and Susy never looked up from her play, and did not notice that she was gone a long while."
"By and by Mrs. Parlin thought she would go and see what the children were doing; so she put on her bonnet and went over to the ""new house."" Susy was still busy with her blocks, but she looked up at the sound of her mother's footsteps.They looked, and what did they see? Prudy herself standing on the highest beam of the house! She had climbed three ladders to get there. Her mother had heard her say the day before that ""she didn't want to shut up her eyes and die, and be all deaded up--she meant to have her hands and face clean, and go up to heaven on a ladder.""While she was begging Him to tell her what to do, a sudden thought flashed across her mind. She dared not speak, lest the sound of her voice should startle the child; but she had a bunch of keys in her pocket, and she jingled the keys, holding them up as high as possible, that Prudy might see what they were.Then she walked along the beam, and turned about to come down the ladders. Mrs. Parlin held her breath, and shut her eyes. She dared not look up, for she knew that if Prudy should take one false step, she must fall and be dashed in pieces!But Prudy was not wise enough to fear any thing. O, no. She was only thinking very eagerly about crimson jellies and fruit cake. She crept down the ladders without a thought of danger--no more afraid than a fly that creeps down the window-pane.The air was so still that the sound of every step was plainly heard, as her little feet went pat,--pat,--on the ladder rounds. God was taking care of her,--yes, at length the last round was reached--she had got down--she was safe!""O, mamma, what you crying for?"" said little Prudy, clinging about her neck. ""Ain't I your little comfort?--there, now, you know what you _speaked_ about! You said you'd get some cake and verserves for me and Susy.""""But, mamma, if you are willing, I'd rather not sit with Prudy, now, certainly. She says such queer things. Why, to-day she said she had grandma's rheumatism in her back, and wanted me to look at her _tongue_ and see if she hadn't. Why, mother, as true as I live, she shut up her eyes and put out her tongue right there in school, and of course we girls couldn't help laughing!""Mrs. Parlin began to think it was a foolish plan to let Prudy take her knitting-work. I was going to mention something she did the last day she carried it. She got tired of knitting, tired of twisting her pretty curls round her finger, and tired of looking at pictures.""Let's guess riddles,"" she whispered to Nancy Glover, who sat on the bench beside her. ""I can make up riddles just as easy! There's something in this room, in Miss Parker's watch-pocket, goes _tick--tick_. Now guess that:--that's a riddle."""
"All at once Prudy happened to look at Nancy's ear, and thought, ""What funny little holes folks have in their ears! I s'pose they go clear through. I guess I'll put my knitting-needle right through Nannie's ear while she's a-studyin'. The needle will look so funny stickin' out at the other end!""O, such sharp screams as Nannie gave! The teacher was frightened; but when she found that Nannie was not so _very_ badly hurt after all, she felt easier about her, and began to talk to little Prudy, asking her ""why she didn't sit still, like a lady, and _mind_?""When Miss Parker called out the next class in spelling, Nannie sat with her head down, feeling very cross. ""I don't like you, Prudy,"" said she. ""You 'most killed me! I'll pay you for this, now you see!""Miss Parker had to call Nannie by name before she would go to her class. She was three or four years older than Prudy, and ought to have known better than to be angry with such a little child. She should have forgotten all about it: that would have been the best way. But instead of that, she kept thinking,--When little Prudy spoke so sweetly, Nancy didn't know what to say; so she said nothing. They went into the school-house and took their seats, Nancy keeping the corner of her apron rolled up all the while.Then what should Nancy do, but take out of her apron _a wee bit of a toad_, and drop it in Prudy's mouth! I can't see how she dared do such a thing; but she did it. She had found the toad in the street, and picked it up to frighten little Prudy.""I guess so,"" sobbed Prudy. ""And it was alive--just as alive as could be! O, O!--Nancy, she told me to shut up my eyes, you know, and I didn't see the toad till it hopped right up in my mouth,--and _then_ I didn't see it! O, O!"" This was about the last of Prudy's going to school. In the first place she was very tired of it, in the second place it was vacation, and in the third place the whole family were going to Willowbrook on a visit.It was very pleasant at grandpa Parlin's at any time. Such a stout swing in the big oil-nut tree! Such a beautiful garden, with a summer-house in it! Such a nice cosy seat in the trees! So many ""cubby holes"" all about to hide in!"
"But this summer I speak of was pleasanter than ever; for the Western cousins, Grace and Horace Clifford, had come from Indiana to visit their friends in Maine. The Parlin children had not seen them for two years; but Grace and Susy became fast friends in a very short time, while little Prudy was thrown one side for Horace to take care of when he could stop.After a while Grace, and Horace, and Susy came down stairs, and then there was a great time. As soon as breakfast was over, kind aunt Madge promised to make out a list of the little folks to be invited.""I want to tell you something, Horace,"" said aunt Madge, stroking his hair. ""Mr. Allen is going out to North Pond with some other gentleman, fishing, and I begged him to let you go; and he said he would, though he wouldn't take the girls for any thing.""Aunt Madge shook her curly head. ""I guess you mustn't have a party,"" said she, ""if you slight good little girls because they are poor. Why, I should ask her a great deal quicker, because it isn't often she has any thing nice to eat at home.""Such a time as there was to get ready for that party! Aunt Madge and aunt Louise worked with all their might, cooking nice things, and the children were too happy to keep still. Susy's mother had gone back to Portland.Grace didn't shake Prudy, only because she didn't dare to. In a few minutes all the little girls had come, and the whole party went into the front yard to play. Aunt Madge made believe she was a little girl, and played ""Ring Round Rosy,"" ""Catch,"" and ""Button,"" as hard as any body. When they had played till they were all out of breath, aunt Louise sent them to the summer-house in the garden to rest, while she and aunt Madge set the table in the front yard. O, the apple puffs, and lemon tarts, and little seed cakes, and frosted cake, and candy, looked so good to poor little Abby Grant! Then the raspberries, like red coral, and the white currants, like round pearls! Then the flowers, fresh from the garden!The children sat on the double steps of the long piazza to eat their supper. They had plenty of room, and it was nice fun to peep round the great white pillars at their neighbors' plates, and whisper to one another, ""I'm having a grand time, ain't you?"" ""What splendid cake!"" ""Don't you wish you lived here?""""No, she is quite out of sorts,"" said grandma. ""So if you must go somewhere, you may take your little baskets and go out in the meadow on the other side of the cornfield. Only take good care of Prudy; now remember.""""That is all because she cries so much, I presume,"" said Grace, looking at poor Prudy rather sternly. ""I did hope, Susy, that when Horace went down to the 'crick' fishing, you and I might go off by ourselves, and have a nice time for once. But here is 'little Pitcher' right at our heels. We never can have any peace. Little Miss Somebody thinks she must follow, of course."""
"""O, I know it,"" said Susy, in the tone of one who has made up her mind for the worst. ""I suppose we've got to stay here, though. We could go up in the Pines now if it wasn't for Prudy, and they are real thick up there.""""No, indeed,"" said Susy, eating a dry strawberry. ""He keeps sheep, and goes round talking to himself. I ain't a bit afraid of him. What could we little girls do to his grass, I'd like to know? It isn't as if we were great, rude boys, is it, Grace?""So the girls made the best of it, and helped little ""Mother Bunch"" up the long, steep hill. Prudy had one hearty cry before the long walk was over. ""Her nose fell on a rock,"" she said; but as it was only grazed a little, she soon forgot about it.""Ah,"" said he, talking to himself, and not appearing to notice the girls, ""I never would have thought that these little children--ah, would have come into my field--ah, and trampled down my grass! I shall hate--ah, to cut off their little ears--ah, and see the blood running down!""I suppose it was not two minutes before the children had left that field, pulling the screaming Prudy through the bars as roughly as if she had been a sack of wool instead of flesh and blood,--their hair flying in the wind, and their poor little hearts pounding against their sides like trip-hammers. If the field had been on fire they could not have run faster, dragging helpless Prudy, who screamed all the way at the very top of her voice.Susy and Prudy had thrown away their pretty little baskets. Grace had pushed hers up her arm, and her sleeve was soaking in the red juice of the bruised strawberries, while little streams of juice were trickling down her nice, buff-colored dress, ruining it entirely.Aunt Madge brought some water, but her fingers were not steady, and the glass trembled against the child's hot lips. She watched till Prudy dozed again, and then stole softly down stairs to get a ""night candle,"" and to tell her mother she was really afraid Prudy was going to be sick.Aunt Madge tried to hope so, but she hardly slept a wink, for Prudy tossed and twisted all night. Sometimes she thought she was picking berries on the tufted coverlet. Sometimes she cried out that ""the crazy man was coming with a axe.""You may be sure that Grace and Susy were far from happy that day. When they noticed that their grandmother grew more and more uneasy, and when they saw the doctor's gig at the gate, their hearts were very heavy.Mrs. Parlin took off her spectacles to wipe them. ""My dear children,"" said she, gravely, ""I am ready to forgive you with all my heart; but I hope that before this you have asked pardon of your dear Father in heaven. That is the first thing, you know.""""O God,"" sobbed she, ""I should think you would hate me, I have acted so bad! O, can you forgive me, and not take Prudy? I never will do so again! I didn't mean any thing when I said she was always round. O, _don't_ let her die and be put in the ground! Please don't, dear God! Seems to me I love her the best of any body. When we have any fuss, it's always me that's to blame."""
"Here Susy's prayer was drowned in sobs; but her heart felt a little lighter because she had told her kind Father just how she felt, and if it was best for Prudy to get well, she was sure he would save her.But Prudy did not know any body ""to-morrow,"" nor the next day, nor the next. O, the long, weary time that they watched by her bed! The terrible disease seemed to be drinking up her life. Her cheeks looked as if fierce fires were hidden in them, and when she raved so wildly her eyes shone like flames.But God did not mean that Prudy should die. At last, after many days, the fever died out like a fire when it has burned the wood all down to cinders. Then there was a pale little girl left, who looked as if a breath would blow her away like white ashes. I think a little baby, that tips over if you touch it, could not be weaker than Prudy was when she began to get well.Her father and mother, and the whole family, were full of joy, and Grace and Susy went to their cosy seat in the trees to talk over the pretty things they were going to make for Prudy when she should be well enough to enjoy them.""No, I won't,"" said Prudy, trying to stop. ""I was a-talkin' to myself, and I said, 'I won't cry no more,' and then I cried. I don't like to stay in this country, grandma, 'thout I can have somethin' to eat!""""Well,"" said grandma, ""I don't know, You may be thinking all day what you would like best. Not to _eat_, dear, but to _keep_, remember. Now I must go down stairs--but here come Grace and Susy, so you won't be lonesome.""They were dressed in a very funny rig. Susy looked a great deal wiser than an owl, out of a pair of spectacles without any eyes, and a flaring cap. Grace had stuck some false hair on her head, and a bonnet that looked as if a wagon wheel had rolled over it.Here the two visitors turned away their heads to laugh. ""What do you s'pose my present will be?"" said Prudy, forgetting their play. ""Look here, Susy, I could take that vase now, and smash it right down on the floor, and break it, and grandma wouldn't scold--'cause I'm sick, you know.""Prudy almost forgot how hungry she was when she was seated in her little carriage and wheeled about the pleasant yard. She had an idea that the trees and the flowers in the garden were having good times, and the open windows of the house looked as if they were laughing. But she did not say much, and when aunt Madge asked her what made her so quiet, she said she was ""a-thinkin'."" And the most of her small thoughts were about her present.""O, dear, dear, dear!"" cried Prudy, clapping her hands, ""what a cunning little piggy-wiggy! He looks nice enough to eat right up! I never did see such a darling! O, he winks his eyes--see him! He ain't dead, is he? Not a mite?"""
"Grandpa was very kind, but there was one thing he would not consent to--he would not let the pig come into the house. But as he said he would be sure to take good care of it, and give it sweet milk to drink, Prudy did not mind so much.When she grew stronger she fed it herself, and the pretty creature knew her, and was glad to see her, Prudy thought. Now she had a great many presents that summer, but none that pleased her half so well as the little pet pig. One morning, after Prudy was quite well, aunt Madge told her she might go into the garden and get some currants. While she was picking with all her might, and breathing very fast, she saw Horace close by, on the other side of the fence, with a pole in his hand.""O, ho!"" cried Horace, trailing his long pole, ""you can't say 'em skipping about, and I shouldn't care, if I was you. But you ought to know how to fish, Miss. Don't you wish you could drop in your line, and catch 'em the way I do?""""O, my stars!"" cried Horace, laughing, ""you ought to live 'out west,' you're such a cunning little spud. Come, now, here's another fish-pole for you. I'll show you how to catch one, and I bet 'twill be a pollywog--you're just big enough.""""Poh!"" said Horace, ""no you needn't; I have to hurry. Grandma _always_ likes it when you go with me, Prudy, because you see I'm a boy, and she knows I can take care of you twice as well as Grace and Susy can.""""Well, that's smart!"" said Horace, picking her up. ""There, you sit down next time, and I'll prop up the pole with a rock--this way. There, now, you hold it a little easy, and when you feel a nibble you let me know.""""Now, look here,"" said Horace, rather vexed, ""you're a little too bad. You made me drop my line just when I was going to have a nibble. Wait till you feel the string wiggle, and then speak, but don't scream.""The children sat still for a few minutes longer, and no sound was heard but now and then a wagon going over the bridge. But they might as well have dropped their lines in the sand for all the fish they caught. Horace began to wish he had gone to school.The river was quite high, and this was one of the logs that had drifted down from the ""Rips."" Prudy was really afraid to walk on it, because it was ""so round,"" but not liking to be laughed at, she crept on her hands and knees to the very end of the log, trembling all the way.I do not know what Horace thought then, but he had to think fast. If he had been older he might have plunged in after Prudy, but he was only a little boy, seven years old, so he ran for the house. O, how he ran!"
"""Has she just been saved from death only to be drowned?"" was one of the quick thoughts that rushed across aunt Madge's dizzy brain. ""I shall be too late! too late! And her mother gone! God forgive me! It is I who should have watched her!""Mr. Allen leaped the fence at a bound, and ran down the bank. The child was out of the water, struggling to climb the bank, but slipping back at every step. She was dripping wet, and covered with sand.""The log kept jiggling,"" said she, ""and I couldn't hold on, but I did. I thought my father would say I was a nice little girl not to get drowned, and let the fishes eat me up, and so I kept a-holdin' on.""""O, won't you forgive him?"" said Prudy, looking up into Mrs. Clifford's face; ""won't you forgive him, aunt 'Ria? he feels so bad; and he didn't catch a fish, and he didn't mean to,--and--'twas the log that jiggled.""""A fairy story?"" repeated aunt Madge. ""I don't know about that. I told a little boy a fairy story once, and he went right off and whispered to his mother that I was a very wicked lady, for that story wasn't true, not a bit; and if a baby six months old should hear it, he wouldn't believe a word of it!""""Yes, they called me little Madge sometimes, and sometimes Maggie. When I was about as old as our Susy, I happened to go into the back-room one day, and saw uncle Edward's hatchet lying on the meat-block. I knew I had no right to touch it, but it came into my head that I would try to break open the clams. The hatchet, instead of cracking the shells, came down with full force on my foot! I had on thick boots, but it cut through my right boot deep into the bone. O, how I screamed!""""Yes, indeed! Why, when I went into the kitchen, my footsteps were tracked with little pools of blood, oozing out of my boot. Sister Maria screamed out,--'O, look at Maggie! She's cut her foot with that hatchet!'""""Well, they sent for the doctor in great haste, and then tried to pull off my boot; but my foot was so badly swollen, and bleeding so fast, that it took a great while. I can't tell how long, for I fainted. When the doctor saw the wound they said he looked very sober."""
"""'So, so, little girl,' said he (that was after I came to myself), 'you thought you'd make me a good job while you were about it. There's no half-way work about you. You are the child that had the tip of a finger clipped off in the corn-sheller, hey?'""""'So, so,' said he. 'Very well, never mind how 'twas done, but keep your foot still, little one, and we'll talk about the hatchet another time. Mrs. Parlin, if it goes to bleeding again, be sure to send for me.'""""It was ever so long before I could walk a step. Every time any body spoke of my hurt, I said, 'Why, I was just coming into the house with those clams, and my foot slipped, and I fell and hit me on something. I don't know whether it was a hatchet or a stick of wood; but I never touched the hatchet!'""""I didn't know what that meant, but he laughed so that I knew he was making sport of me. I knew nobody believed me. The hatchet had been found red with blood, and mother looked, O, so sad! but I had told that falsehood so many times that it did seem as if I hadn't any courage left to tell the truth. It had grown to be very easy to keep saying, I never _touched_ the hatchet.'""""Whenever father looked at me, I felt just as if he was thinking, 'Margaret doesn't tell the truth;' and when mother spoke my name quick, I was afraid she was going to say something about the hatchet.""""I got well, only I limped a little. Then it was almost time to think of making presents for the Christmas tree. I didn't like to have Christmas come while I was feeling so. People are so good that day, I thought. That is the time when every body loves you, and spends money for you. I wanted to confess, and feel _clean_; but then I had told that lie over so many times that I thought I _couldn't_ take it back.""""I talked it over with myself a great while though, and at last said I, 'I _will_; I'll do it!' First, I asked God to forgive me and help me, and when I had got as far as that, the thing was half done, children.""""Forgive! I guess he did! My dear child, it was just what he had been waiting to do! And, O, I can tell you he talked to me in such a way about the awful sin of lying, that I never, never forgot it, and shan't, if I live to be a hundred years old.""""My father had forgiven me: I was sure God had forgiven me too; and after that, I felt as if I could look people in the face once more, and I had a splendid time Christmas.--I believe that's about all the _story_ there is to it, children.""""And I was a coward, and didn't dare tell you, auntie. I thought maybe you'd forget I had it, and some time when you asked for it, I was going to say, 'Hadn't you better take a pair of tongs and see if it isn't in the water barrel?'"""
"""She isn't any worse than me, auntie,"" said Grace. ""Ma asked me how the mud came on my handkerchief, and I said Prudy wiped my boots with it. And so she did, auntie, but I told her to; and wasn't I such a coward for laying it off on little Prudy? I am ashamed--you may believe I am.""""I am glad you have told me the whole truth now,"" replied aunt Madge, ""though it does make me feel sad, too, for it's too much like my hatchet story. O, do remember from this time, children, and never, never, _dare_ be _cowards_ again!""""Well, I don't know but I'd as soon tell a story as not,"" replied Grace, pushing back her curls; ""I reckon Pincher wants to hear one, he begins to wag his tail. I can't make up any thing as I go along, but I can tell a sober, true story.""""Didn't I ever tell you about our school-dog out West, aunt Madge? You see it was so queer. I don't know where in the world he came from. He had one of his eyes put out, and was 'most blind out of the other, and only a stump of a tail, and didn't know how to get his living like other dogs.""""O dear, it was so funny he should take it into his head to come to school, now wasn't it, auntie? He knew Miss All'n just as well as could be, and used to go with the rest of the scholars to meet her every morning; and when she patted him on the head, and said 'Good old doggie,' it did seem like he'd fly out of his wits.""""Then when she rang the bell he trotted in just as proud, hanging down his head as meek as could be. He thought she rang the bell for him as much as any of the rest of the scholars. His seat was right by the stove on the floor--it _wasn't_ a seat, I mean; and he just lay there the whole living time, and slept and snored--you see he was so old, auntie! But then we all loved him, we just loved him so! O dear me, it's as much as I can do to keep from crying, and I don't know how _any body_ could help it!""""What was I talking about--O, he used to walk round under the seats just as sly sometimes, and put his nose into the dinner baskets. I tell you he liked cake, that dog did, and he liked meat and mince pie. You see he could _smell_, for his nose was as good as ever it was, and the girls used to cry sometimes when he picked out the nice things.""""But then we just loved him so, you know, auntie! Why, we thought he was just as good as any body. He never bit nor growled, that dog didn't, not a mite. There wasn't one of us but he loved,--'specially Miss All'n.""""I'll tell you how it was. Sometimes he got locked up all night. He'd be asleep, you know, by the stove, or else under the seats, and Miss All'n would forget, and suppose he was gone with the rest of the scholars.""""Well, he was a darling old dog, if he _did_ chew up the books! I just about know he got hungry in the night, or he never would have thought of it. How did _he_ know it was wrong? he didn't know one letter from another. He spoiled Jenny Snell's spelling-book, I know, and lots of readers and things; but what if he did, auntie, now what of it?"""
"""Miss All'n cried. She lifted up the lid of her desk, and hid her head, but we all knew she was crying. You see we had such a time about it. We thought he was going to carry the dog off to some place, and take care of him like he was his master, or may be shut him up, or something that way; but, do you believe, he just _shot_ that dog right in the yard!""""Yes, auntie, I reckon it was! We all cried like we should kill ourselves, and put our fingers in our ears; for we heard the man when he fired the gun,--I mean we heard the gun when the man fired it,--and _then_ it was of no use; but we stopped our ears, and Miss All'n hid her face, and cried--and cried--and cried!""""O dear me, it did seem like we didn't any of us want to go to school any more, if we couldn't see our old dog coming to meet us, and rub his head against our dresses. And it was just as lonesome,--now it was _so_, auntie.""""You'd ought to see my pa's horse out West, auntie; there ain't a Yankee horse can hold a candle to him; I'll leave it to Pincher. His name is Sancho, and my ma sends him to market mornings, early, with the basket, and puts some money in, and a note to the butcher, and that horse comes back, sir, just as fast as he can trot, sir, and he has the meat there all wrapped up, and just has the basket in his teeth, this way.""""Once there was goin' to be three balls, and Cindrilla didn't have no mother, and her father didn't have no wife, so he married him one. And there was goin' to be three great big balls, and Cindrilla asked her mother if she couldn't go, and her mother said, No, indeed; she hadn't nothin' to wear. And then they started off, and her grandma came,--O, I forgot, the woman was wicked, and she made her little girls sit in the parlor, all dressed up spandy clean, and she made Cindrilla sit in the coal-hod.""""And then there was some bugs round there, and they was six horses, and she got in and rode on to the ball, and her shoes come off, and then the king married her, and she had the other shoe in her pocket, and he married her right off, and they're all safe now.""""O dear suz! I was going to tell a story, a fairy story. It was going to be a real good one, about 'The Bravest of Lion's Castle,' and I couldn't think of a thing to say, and now Prudy has drove it all out of my head.""""O dear,"" said poor aunt Louise to her sister, ""what shall I do all this long day with three noisy children? I'm afraid some of them will get drowned, or run over, or break their necks. You see if something awful doesn't happen before we get back.""""Well, you ought to love your aunt _Mig_, all of you,"" said aunt Louise, laughing, ""for I do believe she thinks you children are as lovely as little white rose-buds.--Come, are you all ready? Then run along, and I'll follow after.""They had such a pleasant walk through the streets of the beautiful village, in the ""sunshine, calm and sweet!"" Grace thought the trees met overhead just as if they were clasping hands, and playing a game of ""King's Cruise"" for every body to ""march through.""""Dear little souls,"" said she, ""come right into the house, and let me take off your things. I've been looking for you these two hours. This is my little nephew, Lonnie Adams.--Shake hands with the little girls, my dear.""It was so pleasant in aunt Martha's shaded parlor, and the children took such delight in looking at the books and pictures, that they were all sorry when aunt Louise ""got nervous,"" and thought it was time they went off somewhere to play.So all over the house and grounds they went in a very few minutes, and at last came to a stand-still in Bridget's chamber over the kitchen, tired enough to sit down a while--all but Prudy, who ""didn't have any kind of _tiredness_ about her.""""Let me take it,"" cried Lonnie, seizing it out of Prudy's hand, ""I'm going to put it up at auction. I'm Mr. Nelson, riding horseback,"" said he, jumping up on a stand. ""I'm ringin' a bell. 'O yes! O yes! O yes! Auction at two o'clock! Who'll buy my fine, fresh ink?'"""
"Poor little Susy had to go home in the noonday sun, hanging down her head like a guilty child, and crying all the way. Some of the tears were for her soiled clothes, some for her auntie's sharp words, and some for the nice dinner she had left.Tears came into aunt Madge's kind gray eyes, and she made up her mind that the poor child should be comforted. So she quietly put away the silk dress she was so anxious to finish, and after dinner took the fresh, tidy, happy little Susy across the fields to aunt Martha's again, where the unlucky day was finished very happily after all.""The truth is, Louise,"" said aunt Madge that night, after their return, ""_Lonnie_ spilled that ink, and Susy was not at all to blame. You scolded her without mercy for being careless, and she bore it all because she would not break her promise to that cowardly boy.""""You _have_ been unjust,"" said aunt Madge. ""Only think what a trifling thing it is for a little child to soil her dress! and what a great thing to have her keep her word! Susy has a tender heart, and it grieves her to be unjustly scolded; but she would bear it all rather than tell a falsehood. For my part I am proud of such a noble, truthful little niece.""""I think,"" answered the child, ""you ought to call me to you and say, 'You been a-singin' to the table, Prudy.' Then I'll say 'Yes'm;' and you'll say, 'Prudy, go right out in the kitchen, and don't let me see you till you come back pleasant.'""""A picnic!"" screamed all the voices in chorus. It was almost too good to believe. Grace clapped her hands and laughed. Susy ran about the room like a crazy thing. Prudy hopped up and down, and Horace tried to stand on his head.""Now scamper, every one of you,"" said aunt Madge, ""for I must go right to cooking.--Let's see, you shall have some cunning little sandwiches, some hard-boiled eggs; and what else can you think of, Louise?""""The note says, 'the Misses Parlin,'"" said aunt Louise, gravely. ""That might mean your grandmother, but it doesn't! I take it to mean _the young ladies_, Madge (or Mig) and Louise, your beautiful aunties, who are often called 'the Misses Parlin.' Of course it _can't_ mean two little slips of girls in short dresses!""""It's not true, children, not one word; she's only joking,"" said aunt Madge, laughing and shaking the egg-beater at her sister. ""I'm really ashamed of your aunt Louise for trying to tease you. What _do_ you suppose any body wants of old grown-up folks at your nice little party? There, there, don't laugh _quite_ so loud. Run away, and stay away, if you want me ever to do any thing.""In a few moments the children were playing out of doors in high spirits, and Prudy had told the workmen, in her pretty, lisping way, ""that every one of we children were invited to a _jispy_ supper; had a ticket come a-purpose, so of course we should _have_ to go!"""
"""They ought to be snipped from now till next Christmas,"" said aunt Louise, laughing in spite of herself to see the little one set to work with thumb and finger, trying to do her own punishing. ""There, there, go off, and be a good girl.""Prudy's bright spirits rose again at these words, and she thought she would keep on trying to make herself useful. It was aunt Madge she wanted to help--good aunt Madge, who was so busy cooking for the gypsy supper.Now aunt Madge had fed little Daffy before sunrise, and he was as yellow and happy as a canary can be. But silly little Prudy trotted off after a piece of sponge cake, climbed into a chair, opened the cage door, and swung the cake before his eyes.Prudy ran, in great fright, to tell aunt Madge, and when she opened the door, the cat got in; and such a time as there was, you may imagine. Kitty rushed for the canary, aunt Louise rushed for the kitty, and aunt Madge for the bird. At last, Daffy was caught, and safe in his little home, with only the loss of a few tiny feathers.""O,"" cried Prudy, eagerly, ""wouldn't you rather snip my hands? You can snip 'em with a piece o' whalebone, you know, and switch me all over with a switch, and do _every thing_ to me, if you'll only let me go to the party!""""O, I begin to understand,"" said aunt Madge, laughing heartily. ""So you didn't mean to be a naughty girl after all. I am very glad of that, Prudy, for I couldn't tell what to make of you. But you must never touch the cage again. Little girls that want to _help_, must ask somebody to tell them what to do. There, now, kiss me, dear, and I'll forgive you, and we won't say any more about your being naughty, if you'll only remember next time.""I don't know which felt most at home in those woods, the birds or the children. It wasn't at all like having a party in a parlor, where there are chairs and rugs in the way; and where you can't run and jump without being afraid of hurting something. No, there wasn't any danger of scratching the varnish off the trees, nor any danger of soiling the soft carpet of the earth.""Now, you're a little pink of a dear,"" said Ruth. ""Let's see,"" added she, feeling anxious to say something, for she thought Prudy would want to be amused, ""do you love your aunt Madge any? _I_ think she's very good and nice.""After watching Prudy to the child's vexation for about two hours, Ruth forgot all about her, and it so happened that the little thing strayed off with Horace and his friend Gilbert, whom he called ""Grasshopper,"" to a little clearing in the wood.It is a sad fact that ""Grasshopper"" had a bunch of matches in his pocket, and the boys meant to build a fire. Horace gathered the dry sticks and crossed them, so all Grasshopper had to do was to strike a match, and the fire was soon crackling briskly.Horace said no more, but went quietly to work and whittled some long splinters, on which he stuck the fish and set them to roasting. True, they got badly scorched and dreadfully smoked, but that was not all that happened. A spark flying out caught Prudy's gingham dress, and set it in flames in a second.Whether the boys would have known what to do, I can't say; but just then Sam Walker, a good-natured colored man, came up and put out the flames before Prudy fairly knew there were any. Then he brought water from a spring and drowned the bonfire, and gave the boys ""a piece of his mind."""
"All the while poor Prudy was running off into the thickest part of the wood, crying bitterly. Sam ran after her, and caught her up, as if she had been a stray lamb; and though she struggled hard, he carried her to the picnic ground, where the large girls were just spreading the table for supper.""No'm, I ain't cryin',"" sobbed Prudy. ""I ain't crying any thing about that;"" and every word seemed to be shaken out, as if there was a little earthquake at her heart--""_there--is--black folks!_ O, he is just as--_black_!""After much soothing, and a good deal of candy, Prudy was comforted, and the supper went off famously. The children were all polite and well-behaved, ""even the boys,"" as Ruth said; and though they all had keen appetites, nobody was greedy.""He's quite a good man,"" answered aunt Madge, trying not to smile, ""and has had a great deal of trouble. I can't stop to tell you, and you wouldn't understand; but I dare say he has cried ever so much, Prudy, and felt worse than you can think, all because he is black; and some people don't like black men."" The beautiful summer was passing away very fast. Only a few days more till autumn. A little longer, and the cousins must separate; so, for the time that was left, they clung all the more closely together.I have called it a beautiful summer; so it was, but there is one sorrowful thing I have not said much about. There was one trouble which always made the children feel sad when they stopped to think of it.""O auntie,"" cried Prudy, eager with a new thought, ""won't you tell me where them raisins is--the ones you didn't put in the pudding? Tell me, O, do, do! If you will, I won't touch 'em, true as the world.""""Why do you cry so, my dearest auntie in the world?"" said Prudy, climbing into a chair, and throwing her arms around her auntie's neck, while the raisins dropped to the floor; ""is Mr. 'Gustus Allen dead?""""No,"" said aunt Madge, hugging little Prudy as if she was good for the heartache, ""the baby is a _great deal worse_, darling! Tell the children I will send them some dinner up in the trees, and don't let Horace come into the house. You know he means to keep still, but his boots make so much noise.""Prudy gathered up the raisins, and went out quietly, her happy little face looking very sober. But the ""bird-child"" could not be sad long at a time, and she had hardly climbed the steps into the trees, and given away the clusters of raisins, before the sick baby was almost forgotten.""O, no, no!"" cried Prudy, holding him back, and speaking very fast, ""he's a great deal _wusser_, and auntie said your boots was so big she'd send the dinner out here; and then she cried like every thing.""""So you have,"" said Grace. ""I heard ma say the other day you'd always been good to little brother. O Susy, you ought to have seen how Harry used to jump when he'd hear Horace open the door; he always expected a frolic!""And so the children chatted and played quietly all day long, sometimes breaking off in the midst of a game to talk about the baby. It seemed like a very strange day. The sky looked so calm and peaceful that you could almost fancy it was keeping still to listen to something a great way off. The quiet trees might have been dreaming of heaven, Susy thought. Horace begged her now to tell that fairy story about ""The Bravest of Lion's Castle;"" but Susy said it made her feel wicked to think of fairy stories _that_ day, though she couldn't tell why."
"After they had finished their supper, aunt Madge said, ""You may all follow me into the nursery; I have something to tell you.--Our dear little pale baby, who has been sick day and night all this long summer, will never feel sick or cry any more. God has taken him to heaven to be a little angel.""All but Prudy knew that she spoke of death. Grace flung herself on the floor and wept aloud. Horace rushed up stairs into the back chamber, without saying a word to any body; and Susy buried her face in the sofa-pillows, whispering, ""O God, don't let it be so; it isn't true, is it?""Why every body should weep was more than Prudy could tell; but she thought it must be right to do as the rest did, and by bedtime she was sobbing as if her heart would break. She afterwards said to Susy,--Aunt Madge was puzzled, and hardly knew what to say, for it is not easy to make such very little children know the difference between the body, which goes back to dust, and the spirit, which goes to God who gave it.But by and by, when days passed, and there was no longer a baby in the house, Prudy began to think of him as one of the angels. And one morning she told a beautiful dream which she thought she had had, though she sometimes called her _thoughts_ dreams.""O,"" said she, ""I dreamed about my angel! He had stars all round his head, and he _flowed_ in the air like a bird. There was ever so many little angels with him, and some of 'em sang. They didn't sing _sorry_; they was singing, 'The Little Boy that died.' And, aunt 'Ria, I guess you wouldn't cry if you could see how happy they were!"" It was now autumn. The trees couldn't keep green any longer, for their time had come; so they just made the best of it, like sad faces laughing through tears, and glowed and flushed in a perfect blaze of glory, making believe they were having splendid times all by themselves, and didn't care for what was coming.""O Susy,"" sobbed Grace, ""don't you forget these good times! Remember to write, no matter how it looks. I wish I hadn't got to go 'way off out West. I never did have such times in any place as we've had here at grandma's.""""Nor I either,"" said Susy, looking sorrowfully at the barn, the seat in the trees, and the clover patch. ""Remember, you're coming back in just two years. Won't it be splendid?--O dear, but two years is 'most forever!"" added Susy, suddenly breaking down.Nobody knew whether Horace cried or not, for nobody saw him till dinner time, but then he looked very sober indeed. He and Grasshopper had been building a fort, he said; and after he had told so much, he seemed not to care about talking. He felt captain of a little company, and such a brave soldier that he would not even say he felt sorry Prudy was gone.Mrs. Clifford said she should be very glad, indeed, to have a visit from both the children, and who knew but it might happen so? for Mr. Parlin, Susy's father, often took journeys out West on business."
"This idea struck Grace very pleasantly, and she had a strong hope of the visit in a minute. In two minutes she had a firm belief in it; and the last we see of Grace and Horace in this book, they are sitting on the piazza, eagerly talking about the next winter, when they shall both go to the cars to meet uncle Edward and the children.I think you was real good to write me a letter. I had just as lief kiss you as not if you _wasn't_ my father; and aunt Madge says she'll answer it, 'cause you couldn't read my writing; _but_ I hain't got any pig! He was a pinky winky little thing, but grandpa kept a keepin' him eatin', and he got so big once when I was gone that they had to kill him.I've got my presents, but they ain't took off the tree yet. Mother gave me a tea-set. O, I wish you could see it, 'cause you wouldn't break a single thing. And I had a doll, and lots of candy and books, and a new dress, and a scarf, and some shiny shoes.I'm glad you wrote me that darling letter. I can't think of any thing to think of. The skeeters bit me when I was to grandma's. I hate _live_ skeeters. They might be flies, and I wouldn't care then. They used to get into my skin just as easy, and sting me all up.Susy fastened her tooth to the door-latch once. It got so loose it shook in her mouth, and it hurt her so I had to cry. But _my_ teeth are drove in real hard. I mean it hurt her when 'twas pulled, that's what I mean. ""Sophie May's excellent pen has perhaps never written anything more pleasing to children, especially little girls, than 'Dotty Dimple.' If the little reader follows Dotty through these dozen chapters--from her visit to her grandmother to the swing under the trees--he or she will say: 'It has been a treat to read about Dotty Dimple, she's so cunning.'""--_Herald of Gospel Liberty._ ""Dotty's trip was jolly. In the cars, where she saw so many people that she thought there'd be nobody left in any of the houses, she offers to hold somebody's baby, and when it begins to cry she stuffs pop-corn into its mouth, nearly choking it to death. Afterwards, in pulling a man's hair, she is horrified at seeing his wig come off, and gasps out,'Oh, dear, dear, dear, I didn't know your hair was so tender!' Altogether, she is the cunningest chick that ever lived.""--_Oxford Press._ ""This little book is as full of spice as any of its predecessors, and well sustains the author's reputation as the very cleverest of all writers of this species of children's books. Were there any doubt on this point, the matter might be easily tested by inquiry in half the households in the city, where the book is being revelled over.""--_Boston Home Journal._"
"""Miss Dotty is a peremptory little body, with a great deal of human nature in her, who wins our hearts by her comic speeches and funny ways. She complains of being _bewitched_ by people, and the wind 'blows her out,' and she thinks if her comrade dies in the snow-storm she will be 'dreadfully 'shamed of it,' and has rather a lively time with all her trials in going to school.""--_New York Citizen._ ""'Charming Dotty Dimple,' as she is so universally styled, has become decidedly a favorite with young and old, who are alike pleased with her funny sayings and doings. 'Dotty at Play' will be found very attractive, and the children, especially the girls, will be delighted with her adventures.""--_Boston Express._ ""This is the final volume of the 'Dotty Dimple' Series. It relates how little Flyaway provisioned herself with cookies and spectacles and got lost on a little hill while seeking to mount to heaven, and what a precious alarm there was until she was found, and the subsequent joy at her recovery, with lots of quaint speeches and funny incidents.""--_North American._ ""This is a book for the little ones of the nursery or play-room. It introduces all the old favorites of the Prudy and Dotty books, with new characters and funny incidents. It is a charming book, wholesome and sweet in every respect, and cannot fail to interest children under twelve years of age.""--_Christian Register._ ""How she kept it, why she kept it, and what a good time she had playing cook, and washerwoman, and ironer, is told as only Sophie May can tell stories. All the funny sayings and doings of the queerest and cunningest little woman ever tucked away in the covers of a book will please little folks and grown people alike.""--_Press._ ""Tells of a little mite of a girl, who gets into every conceivable kind of scrape and out again with lightning rapidity through the whole pretty little book. How she nearly drowns her bosom friend, and afterwards saves her by a very remarkable display of little-girl courage. How she gets left by a train of cars, and loses her kitten and finds it again, and is presented with a baby sister 'come down from heaven,' with lots of smart and funny sayings.""--_Boston Traveller._ ""Grandmother Parlen when a little girl is the subject. Of course that was ever so long ago, when there were no lucifer matches, and steel and tinder were used to light fires; when soda and saleratus had never been heard of, but people made their pearl ash by soaking burnt crackers in water; when the dressmaker and the tailor and the shoemaker went from house to house twice a year to make the dresses and coats of the family.""--_Transcript._ ""The story of Grandfather Parlen's little-boy life, of the days of knee breeches and cocked hats, full of odd incidents, queer and quaint sayings, and the customs of 'ye olden time.' These stories of Sophie May's are so charmingly written that older folks may well amuse themselves by reading them. The same warm sympathy with childhood, the earnest naturalness, the novel charm of the preceding volumes will be found in this.""--_Christian Messenger._ ""One of the queerest of the Prudy family. Read the chapter heads and you will see just how much fun there must be in it: 'Fly's Heart,' 'Taking a Nap,' 'Going to the Fair,' 'The Dimple Dot,' 'The Hole in the Home,' 'The Little Bachelor,' 'Fly's Bluebeard,' 'Playing Mamma,' 'Butter Spots,' 'Polly's Secret,' 'The Snow Man,' 'The Owl and the Humming-Bird,' 'Talks of Hunting Deer,' and 'The Parlen Patchwork.'"" ""Flaxie Frizzle is the successor of Dotty Dimple, Little Prudy, Flyaway, and the other charming child creations of that inimitable writer for children, Sophie May. There never was a healthy, fun-loving child born into this world that, at one stage or another of its growth, wouldn't be entertained with Sophie May's books. For that matter, it is not safe for older folks to look into them, unless they intend to read them through. 'Flaxie Frizzle' will be found as bright and pleasant reading as the others.""--_Boston Journal._"
"""Sophie May understands children. Her books are not books about them merely. She seems to know precisely how they feel, and she sets them before us, living and breathing in her pages. Flaxie Frizzle is a darling, and her sisters, brothers, and cousins are just the sort of little folks with whom careful mothers would like their boys and girls to associate. The story is a bright, breezy, wholesome narrative, and it is full of mirth and gayety, while its moral teaching is excellent.""--_Sunday-School Times._ ""Little Flaxie will secure a warm place in the hearts of all at once. Here is her little picture: Her name was Mary Gray, but they called her Flaxie Frizzle, because she had light curly hair that frizzled; and she had a curly nose,--that is, her nose curled up at the end a wee bit, just enough to make it look cunning. Her cheeks were rosy red, 'and she was so fat that when Mr. Snow, the postmaster, saw her, he said, ""How d'ye do, Mother Bunch?""'""--_Boston Home Journal._ ""'Kittyleen'--one of the 'Flaxie Frizzle' series--is a genuinely helpful as well as delightfully entertaining story. The nine-year-old Flaxie is worried, beloved, and disciplined by a bewitching three-year-old tormenter, whose accomplished mother allows her to prey upon the neighbors. 'Everybody felt the care of Mrs. Garland's children. There were six of them, and their mother was always painting china. She did it beautifully, with graceful vines trailing over it, and golden butterflies ready to alight on sprays of lovely flowers. Sometimes the neighbors thought it would be a fine thing if she would keep her little ones at home rather more; but if she had done that she could not have painted china.'""--_Chicago Tribune._ ""Miss Penn Shirley is a very graceful interpreter of child-life. She thoroughly understands how to reach out to the tender chord of the little one's feelings, and to interest her in the noble life of her young companions. Her stories are full of bright lessons, but they do not take on the character of moralizing sermons. Her keen observation and ready sympathy teach her how to deal with the little ones in helping them to understand the lessons of life. Her stories are simple and unaffected.""--_Boston Herald._ ""One of the freshest and most delightful, because the most natural, of the stories of the year for children is 'Little Miss Weezy,' by Penn Shirley. It relates the oddities, the mischief, the adventures, and the misadventures of a tiny two-year-old maiden, full of life and spirit, and capable of the most unexpected freaks and pranks. The book is full of humor, and is written with a delicate sympathy with the feelings of children which will make it pleasing to children and parents alike. Really good child literature is not over-plenty, despite the multitude of books that come daily from the press; and it is pleasing to welcome a new author whose first volume, like this one of Penn Shirley, adds promise of future good work to actual present merit.""--_Boston Courier._ ""We should like to see the person who thinks it 'easy enough to write for children' attempt a book like the 'Miss Weezy' stories. Excepting Sophie May's childish classics, we don't know of anything published as bright as the sayings and doings of the little Louise and her friends. Their pranks and capers are no more like Dotty Dimple's than those of one bright child are like another's, but they are just as 'cute' as those of the little folks that play in your yard or around your neighbor's doorsteps.""--_Journal of Education._"
