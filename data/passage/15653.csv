passage
"""She very probably will miss her train, we will miss her at the station, she will take a ride up with old Bill Mason, stay talking to him until dinner is too cold to wait any longer; then--then--well, she may steal in through a window and give you a midnight scare, just for a joke. That's my recollection of Miss Tavia.""""Quit! quit there! Easy with young ladies' names! You don't have to--to put her up for the registry,"" and the last speaker swung around in mock challenge, with his fist very close to his brother's aristocratic nose.The three were Dorothy, Ned and Nat. Dorothy Dale was the ""coz,"" a very pretty and attractive young girl, while her two good-looking cousins, Ned the elder and Nat the jollier, were sons of Mrs. Winthrop White, of North Birchland.Dorothy, with her father, Major Dale, and her two brothers, Joe and Roger, the latter about two years younger than his brother, who was not yet in his 'teens, made her home with Major Dale's sister, Mrs. White, where they had lived for the past few years. It was now holiday time, and Dorothy was awaiting the arrival of her chum, Tavia Travers, of Dalton, the former home of the Dales.We may say Dorothy was waiting, but the boys were--well, they may have had to wait until Miss Tavia got there, but one of them, Nat, evidently did not find ""waiting"" very pleasant employment. The fact was, Tavia was a very good friend of Nat, and because of this his brother enjoyed teasing Dorothy about her chum's shortcomings, especially when Nat was within hearing.The two boys had now assumed attitudes generally supposed to be the very best possible in preparation for a fistic encounter, and Dorothy had just jumped upon a chair to be able to reach her taller cousin and prevent anything serious happening, when a very gentle voice from the doorway interrupted the little scene.So stately, so tall, so queenly, and gowned in such a simple yet attractive house robe. Youth may have its glories, but surely mature womanhood has its compensations, for a queenly woman, in the ease and luxury of home costume, is to the eye of love and to the eyes of discriminating persons the most beautiful of all the pictures that femininity is capable of inspiring.Mrs. White's Christian name was Ruth, but the Dale children, having another aunt of that name, had always called this one Aunt Winnie, a sort of contraction from the name of Mrs. White's late husband--Winthrop.This afternoon, when our story opens, was one of those tiresome ""strips of time,"" with nothing to mark it as different from any other occasion, but, as Nat expressed it, ""everything seemed to be hanging around, waiting for Christmas, like New York, on Sunday, waiting for Monday.""The little party were vainly trying to make themselves happy in the library, where every reasonable comfort and luxury surrounded them, for The Cedars, as this country estate was called, was a very beautiful place, its interior arrangements reflected not only ample means, but a display of the finely original and cultured taste for which Mrs. White was famous.So on this afternoon the wintry winds outside accentuated the comforts within, and our friends, while restless and naturally impatient for the arrival of Tavia, could not but appreciate their happy circumstances.You may not all be acquainted with the books of this series, in which are related many important events in the lives of Dorothy Dale, her family and her friends, so something about the volumes that precede this will not be out of place.In the first book, ""Dorothy Dale; a Girl of To-day,"" was told of Dorothy's home life in the little village of Dalton. There Dorothy and her friend Tavia grew like two flowers in the same garden--very different from each other, but both necessary to the beauty of the spot.The dangers of the country to children who venture too far out in the fields and woods were shown in the startling experience Dorothy and Tavia had when Miles Anderson, a cunning lunatic, followed them from place to place, terrifying them with the idea of obtaining from Dorothy some information which would enable him to get control of some money left to a little orphan--Nellie Burlock.There were jolly girls at Glenwood, and some strange ""doings"" took place, all of which went to show that a girl need not go to college to have plenty of fun out of her schooldays, but that the boarding-school, or seminary, is well qualified to afford all the ""prank possibilities"" of real, grown-up school life.In ""Dorothy Dale's Great Secret,"" the third of the series, there is shown what it means for a girl to be allowed too much liberty; to grow ambitious before she has grown wise; to act imprudently, and then to have to suffer the consequences.The book immediately preceding this volume, entitled ""Dorothy Dale and her Chums,"" tells the story of Dorothy, Tavia, Urania, a gypsy girl, and Miette, a little French lass. Dorothy had plenty of trouble trying to civilize Urania, and quite as much trying to save Miette some strange hardships. Dorothy was instrumental in bringing Miette into her own family rights, and if she did not entirely succeed in ""taming"" Urania, she at least improved her marvelously.In all four of the preceding books the friends, whose acquaintance some of you are forming for the first time, played their respective parts as best they might, and now, as we find them on this wintry afternoon, they are ready to take part in other scenes, no less interesting, I hope.Ned and Nat were always going to ""fight,"" but they never actually did get at it. In fact, they were both blessed with a reasonable amount of good nature, and this, coupled with correct training, was destined to make them men of patience and common sense."
"Dorothy smoothed the cushions of the divan as her aunt advanced into the room. Ned and Nat both attempted to poke the same log in the open grate with the same poker, and the blaze that most unexpectedly shot up at this interference with a well-regulated fire, attending strictly to its own affairs, caused both young men to leap quickly back out of reach of a shower of sparks.""Whew!"" exclaimed Nat, falling over an ottoman that Dorothy had been lately sitting on, and landing very ungracefully at his mother's feet. ""Mother, I adore you!"" he suddenly exclaimed as he found himself in a suppliant attitude. ""Only,"" he went on ruefully, rubbing his shins, ""I did not intend to adore you quite so hard.""""_If_ we are going to meet her!"" exclaimed Nat, interrupting his pretty cousin, and putting a great deal of emphasis on the first word. ""There's no 'if' in this deal. We are going,"" and he sprang up and continued springing until he reached his own room, where he proceeded to ""slick up some,"" as he expressed it, while Ned, and Dorothy, too, prepared for the run to the depot in the Fire Bird, as speedy an automobile as could be found in all the country around North Birchland.""Oh, you feel her presence near,"" joked Ned. ""Well, if she comes on time this trip there may be some hope for the poor wretch who may expect her to make good when he has fixed it up with the parson, the organist and--""""No?"" questioned Ned in surprise. ""Glad to hear it. Here, Nat, take this wheel while I make a note of it. A little thing like that is worth remembering,"" and he pretended to take out a notebook and jot it down.When the train glided into the station, with a shrill screeching protest from the sparking wheels and brakes, and when quite a number of persons had alighted and gone their several ways, Dorothy and Nat, who had peered hopefully and anxiously at each passenger, looked rather ruefully at each other. Tavia had not come.Finally the train started up again, the private carriages and hired hacks had been driven off with scores of passengers and their baggage. Then, and not until she had looked up and down the deserted platforms, did Dorothy admit to Nat:But Ned simply had to laugh--he couldn't help it, and when Dorothy and Nat took their places again in the machine Ned was chuckling and gasping in a manner that threatened to do serious damage to his entire vocal apparatus.A tiny dog, of the much-admired, white-silk variety, was barking vigorously at the Fire Bird on account of the danger to which it had been subjected by the fat tires. And the dog's mistress, Mrs. Broadbent, nicknamed ""Brocade"" on account of her weakness for old-time silks and satins, was saying things about the auto party in much the same sort of aggrieved tones that the favorite dog was using.""Yes, I am afraid Tavia does not care for the conventionalities of polite society,"" remarked Mrs. White. ""In fact, I almost suspect she enjoys disregarding them. But never mind! we must not condemn her unheard."" It must not be understood that Nat was a very silly boy. Not at all. He did like Tavia, but he liked his own sweet cousin Dorothy, and would have been just as disappointed, if not more so, had it been Dorothy who had missed her train and not Tavia."
"But the fact that all seemed to need Tavia to finish up the holiday plans, and that now she had not come put Nat in a very restless mood, and when the dinner, which was served immediately upon the return from the depot, was over, Nat decided he would find something to do that would occupy his time until the eight o'clock train, when, of course, they would again go to the station.Electricity was this young man's ""hobby,"" and he had already fitted up the cellar with all sorts of wires and attachments for regulating the household affairs, such as turning on the heat by touching a button in the stable where the hired man, John, had his quarters, and lighting the gas in the coal-cellar by touching a button at the cook's elbow; in fact, Nat really did arrange a number of most convenient contrivances, but the family, all except Joe and Roger, thought his talent misapplied. They insisted he ought to study ""railroading.""""Come on, boys,"" said Nat to the youngsters, when, dinner being over, Major Dale and his sister, Mrs. White, went to ""figure out Christmas secrets,"" and Dorothy turned to the piano to put in her time until the hour for going out again, ""come on, and we'll rig up something.""Instantly both little fellows were at Nat's heels, through the back hall to the cellar-way, where Nat stopped to don his overalls, for he always insisted that the first principle of true mechanics was ""good, stout overalls.""Nor were the clothes protectors unbecoming to Nat. In fact, he looked the ideal workman, except he was not exactly of the muscular build, being decidedly tall, and having such a crop of light, bushy hair.""I'll show you how to make gas,"" said Nat as his two young cousins waited impatiently to hear the program announced. ""We can produce a very superior article by the mere use of bark from a white birch tree, and a common clay pipe. You cut the bark up into little pieces with a pair of scissors, fill the bowl of the pipe, and then make a cover or plug for the bowl by using clay or a mixture of salt, ashes and water. Stick the bowl of the pipe in the stove or furnace like this,"" and he opened the door of the big heater; ""the fire causes the birchbark to give off a gas, it comes up into the pipestem, and can be lighted at the end, thus--""""Well, I guess we had better give up the gas business,"" said Nat impatiently, ""and you kids might as well go out and interview the night air."" And with this he threw down the long-stemmed pipe, which broke into a dozen pieces. Then, while the younger boys made their way back to the kitchen, Nat started for the yard.""Let the girl sit down,"" interrupted Major Dale, who left his armchair to welcome Tavia. ""My, but you are cold! No, don't go too near the fire. Sit here on the couch. Children, run off and fetch a hot drink,"" he added, for he saw that Tavia was indeed too cold to be safe from possible harmful consequences.Nat was not proud, but he had not calculated on being in overalls when he met Tavia. Ned nearly went in kinks at his brother's discomfiture. Dorothy and Mrs. White had hurried off to fetch warm drinks for Tavia.""You'll have to get up a 'visitor alarm,' I guess, Nat,"" said Joe, noting Tavia's plight and Nat's embarrassment. ""If we had heard the dump-cart on the drive we would not have kept her so long out in the cold.""""I would have welcomed even a collision if some one only had to walk back home my way,"" said Tavia. ""But to be put off a train at such a place! Why, I just made a bolt for the first black speck I could see with a light in it. It turned out to be a farmhouse, and I simply told the man he must hitch up and drive me here.""""Do you mean to say you rode from Gransville in a cart? And we have let the man go away without giving him a warm drink or anything! Why, Ned, call up the stable and see if John can catch the fellow; he may not be out on the road yet,"" and at the major's order the three boys hurried to overtake the man, Roger and Joe wrapping quickly in their warm coats and running out toward the drive, while Ned 'phoned the stable for John to stop the cart if he could do so."
"This interruption left Dorothy and Mrs. White with Tavia, for the major, too, had left the room, and presently, when Tavia had ""thawed out"" sufficiently to move about, she went with Dorothy to the alcove room, one of the twin guest chambers in the suite always given Dorothy and Tavia the girls were at The Cedars.""Like it? I suppose it's all rumples and crumples after the cart. But really, Doro, if I had had only some one to talk to, I believe I should have enjoyed it. It was too funny! The man had a mouth without any backstop in it--""""All right, Doro, I'm ready. But say!"" and Tavia stood still for a moment ""You look--like--a picture in that princess. I do wish I could wear a 'clinger,' but I'm too fat. You have gotten--ahem--prettier in the short time since I saw you at school. But I don't wonder. Oh, that abominable old school!""""And that was the very time that your worry was properly placed,"" said Tavia, ""for something did happen to me. In the first place, I knew I would have bad luck, for I dropped my comb while I was dressing.""Dorothy looked annoyed. She did not mind Tavia's usual queer sayings, but she knew perfectly well that her aunt would not like such vulgar expressions. The boys might smile, but even they knew a girl should not forget to be ladylike in an attempt to be funny.""Almost,"" continued Tavia. ""The blackness seemed to be coming down in chunks. Well, I finally reached the old shack and bribed the man into hitching up the cart. Of course, it was awfully cold, and he didn't relish the drive.""""See here, children,"" exclaimed Mrs. White, leaving her place on the cushioned leather couch and going toward the library, ""if you do not stop telling ghost stories you will have the most dreadful dreams.""With the arrival of Tavia at The Cedars Dorothy felt her Christmas vacation had actually begun, for the days spent in expecting her guest were almost wasted in the little preparations that Dorothy always loved to make to welcome Tavia. But now the real holiday had come, and it was with hearts and heads filled with a joyous anticipation that the young folks at The Cedars finally consented to go to bed that night and start out on the morrow to fulfil at least some of the many plans already arranged as part of the Christmas holiday.""We had better go to town and get some of the shopping over with,"" suggested Dorothy to Tavia, when they had convinced the boys that it was too cold to go auto riding, and that this was the very best day in the week to do Christmas buying.""All right, Doro,"" answered Tavia. ""You're the coacher. I'll go wherever you like, only please don't ask me to select anything to go out to Glenwood--I want to forget there is such a place as Glenwood School.""""Then I'm just going to divide with you,"" declared Dorothy, for she knew perfectly well that Tavia was not in the circumstances that she herself enjoyed, surmised that indeed Tavia did have to spend her holiday money for some needed articles."
"""Then all the more reason that you should be reimbursed,"" insisted Dorothy. ""I don't want to know anything about it, but you must let me share with you. Why, what fun would I have giving and buying, with you just looking on?""""I didn't want to take her money,"" Tavia tried to tell herself, ""and I was willing to tell her all about it, but she wouldn't listen. Now, if only I can manage to get Nat to keep quiet. But, at any rate, I did not mean to deceive Dorothy.""But all the same Tavia did not relish the handling of Dorothy's Christmas savings, and somehow she took little interest in all the possible gifts Dorothy made notes of, in preparation for the day's shopping in the city.""I will have to tell Nat, I suppose,"" she was thinking, as she finally picked up the little shopping bag and was ready to start off with Dorothy. ""I'll tell him to-night--but I do hate to. I wish Doro would not be so over-generous,"" and she crushed the money in the leather case and put it securely within the satchel.Meanwhile, Tavia was struggling with her conscience. She had accepted Dorothy's money reluctantly, it might have been, but at the same time she had taken it. And she told Dorothy her own money was spent for--Tavia jerked her fox fur boa impatiently. How complicated the whole thing was getting! What difference did it make to Dorothy for what the five dollars had been expended? It was Tavia's own money. Her mother--""Dear me!"" sighed the girl secretly. ""That makes it so much worse! Mother did try so hard to save that money for me so that I might not always have to depend upon the goodness of Dorothy and her folks.""""I'll just tell her the whole thing when we get on the train,"" she promised herself. ""If there is one thing I simply cannot stand it is a secret that threatens to pop out every time one turns around,"" and with that satisfying assurance Tavia was able to put aside her worry for the time being, and was soon sitting comfortably beside Dorothy in the city express, awake at last to the joys of holiday shopping and the prospect of being able, after all, to get some gifts for dear ones, ""and perhaps,"" she pondered, ""the old five dollars will stop haunting me.""Tavia wanted to tell Dorothy what had become of the precious Christmas money. In fact, she was on the very point of unburdening her mind when the attention of both girls was directed to a frail little woman, who occupied the seat directly opposite them.As if by some magnetic attraction both Tavia and Dorothy discovered that this woman was watching them very closely. In fact, she had her eyes so fastened on Dorothy's money, which Dorothy had been counting in her lap, that it actually appeared the woman must be unconscious of her own actions.""I must get a little more ribbon for Aunt Winnie's bag,"" she began, ""and I must not forget about Joe's magnifying glass. He is so fond of his nature work at school it will be useful as well as enjoyable. Then Roger's steam engine. I wonder do boys ever outgrow steam engines?"""
"""Then we will get them both alike,"" said Dorothy, all enthusiasm. ""The boys are both the same age, and what one would like the other would love. Oh, isn't it just splendid to have little brothers to get toys for? After all, the toys are the best part of Christmas.""Tavia wanted to speak then--it was the time to tell Dorothy, the very opportunity for confessing the whole miserable affair. But what would Dorothy think? She never made such blunders, if it might be called by so charitable a name. And Dorothy had always warned her against writing letters to strangers. Oh, if she had only taken that advice! If she had only been satisfied with that sacred five dollars, money so dearly saved by her good mother! How many things that mother might have bought for herself, for Johnnie, or for Tavia's father, Squire Travers, with that fresh, clean five-dollar bill! But with what a world of love the indulgent mother had, instead, placed the note in Tavia's hand, with the remark:Attaching no significance to the remark, although Tavia turned about uneasily, Dorothy put away her shopping notes, and as the train slacked up under the great iron sheds of the city depot the girls made their way through the crowds, out into the wintry day, along the broad pavements, where the shop windows beamed in all their splendor of holiday goods and Christmas finery.Then the face of her little brother Johnnie seemed to come before Tavia's bewildered eyes. How he beamed when she promised him that engine! And how fondly he kissed her when she declared it would make real steam! But she had her own five dollars at that time. That was before she had made--the mistake.""I wish I had had a chance to caution Nat,"" thought the girl, as Dorothy made her way into the big department store. ""I will have to tell him, first thing when I get back. But what ever will he think of me?""""Tavia! Tavia!"" called Dorothy, who by this time was scanning the mechanical toys on the great center tables. ""Why don't you come and see? We will be crowded away from the best things if you don't hurry.""""She hardly looks well enough off to be buying mechanical toys,"" agreed Dorothy. ""But Christmas goods seem to attract every one. See, isn't this cute?"" and she held up a small tin automobile, the details of which revealed to what a nicety the real machine could be made in miniature."
"Toy automobiles and steam engines were soon forgotten, for Dorothy and Tavia were anxious to free themselves from the jostling throng of eager shoppers, and from the risk of the deliberate elbowing of the little woman in black.""Oh, dear!"" sighed Dorothy, ""I did intend to go right on with our list. And now we have to stop and wait. What can she mean by always keeping in our tracks? Perhaps she is weak and has not the strength to make her own way through the crowds.""""I know she wears them, which shows she is fond of them,"" replied Dorothy, ""and I do think in her kind of lovely white hair pretty combs are so attractive. I want one with a band of enameled forget-me-nots.""With some remorse in her heart for the mother who had made such sacrifices to give her daughter ""her own Christmas money,"" Tavila looked for the little neck pin for Mrs. Travers. It must be carefully selected, with a view to economy as well as with the purpose of obtaining the best possible value for the money.Tavia felt the rebuke--she had spoken loud enough to attract attention, and people did stare. At the same time it was not comfortable to be carried with the tide and be unable to direct one's own movements.""Suppose we go to the rest room and look over the list,"" suggested Dorothy. ""I feel we have not begun to shop yet, although we have been in this store almost an hour. It will straighten us out to start fresh."" There were no preliminaries and less ceremony about searching Dorothy. Within the office she was confronted by the superintendent of the store, and then the woman detective explained that a valuable ring had been taken from a tray on the counter, and she had reason to believe Dorothy or Tavia knew something about the missing article.Dorothy almost forgot her own predicament in trying to calm Tavia. She assured her it would be all right--was all a mistake, and, after all, what would it matter? When the detective would be satisfied they knew nothing about the ring--But this assertion had no effect upon the store people. They were evidently accustomed to persons making ready excuses, and paid no heed to Dorothy's appealing eyes, her flaming cheeks, or her general astonishment.""A woman has been following us all day,"" added Tavia, ""and at the jewelry counter she almost pushed me through the case. I am positive she stole the ring, and got scared, or something. Then she must have tossed it in Dorothy's bag.""He questioned her sharply as to the actions of Dorothy and Tavia while they were in her department. Did they appear hurried, or did they seem to crowd others? These and like questions were put to the clerk. Dorothy felt by this time that the whole thing was a farce. How could they help crowding? And why would they not appear in a hurry, when there were not half enough clerks to attend to the customers?"
"""This young lady,"" she said, still with her eyes fixed upon Dorothy, ""could not possibly have taken the ring. I waited on these girls myself, and noticed they never left their stand at the counter. The tray with that ring in it was at the extreme other end of the case.""At this the woman detective, quick to see the possible turn in her case, hurried to strengthen her evidence. She picked up the telephone and called for another clerk from the jewelry counter. But her eagerness to fix the blame on Dorothy became all the more apparent and did not serve to help her case in the eyes of the superintendent.Tavia showed her impatience--she could see no reason why they should be thus detained unjustly. Dorothy had lost her fear now, and appeared satisfied to await developments. Miss Allen's manner was reassuring.""My name is Dorothy Dale,"" she began clearly, ""and I tell you, honestly, I know nothing about this ring. I never looked at a ring at the counter, and never touched an article except those in the tray with the small pins. I feel you must believe me, but if you are not satisfied you may call up my father, Major Dale, of The Cedars, North Birchland. He will give you any security you may demand.""The speech was just like Dorothy, unexpected, simple, clear in its avowals, and sharp in its purpose. The superintendent looked pleased and Miss Allen smiled. Miss Berg was frightened--she had made a mistake, but the woman detective seemed to know, and she had followed her leading. The detective turned away to hide her disgust.""Well,"" said the superintendent, ""I am satisfied to drop the matter. I believe you, but should I be mistaken in the matter I am willing to let it drop at any rate because of your youth. You may go, young ladies."" Then he continued to the employes: ""Be careful not to leave tempting goods under the hands of a Christmas throng.""""Miss Dearing,"" said the superintendent, addressing her, ""be very careful to cause no false arrests. It appears in this case you have missed the actual culprit, and followed a line pointed out by the clerks.""""Well, you are the coolest kid,"" began Tavia with a loving little tug at Dorothy's arm. ""You go to pieces on small things, but seem to glory in a good big scrape. I would simply have hauled off and landed one on that high-up lady's pug nose.""Dorothy laughed at Tavia's attempt to cover up the experience with her joke. She knew Tavia did not really want to use common slang, but understood her way of teasing and jesting under pretense that Dorothy would be shocked and give her a ""good scolding."" But this time Dorothy disappointed her--she was too well pleased to get out of ""the scrape,"" and had no intention of checking Tavia's suddenly-freed spirits.""And if she did do wrong I cannot imagine why she would keep after us,"" objected Dorothy. ""I am sure if she had anything to do with the ring she would be glad of a chance to get out of the store. Dear, I fancy every one is looking at me!"" as some one turned at the sound of Dorothy's voice. ""It must be awful to be tempted and actually do wrong."""
"That night Dorothy Dale retired to her own cozy little room with her head swathed in cooling cloths. The excitement of the day had cost her more than mere experience and an unexplainable interest in the pale little woman in black.When the whole matter had been discussed, Major Dale was naturally indignant, and declared in plain terms that the unwarranted zeal some detectives evinced in trying to convict supposed wrongdoers without sufficient evidence would some day bring these selfsame sleuths into serious trouble.Mrs. White, too, was annoyed and anxious. Dorothy was not the type of girl who would soon forget her experience. The boys, even to little Roger, declared the whole thing an outrage, and they wanted to go right to town and tell somebody so.""Tavia's ghost?"" repeated his sister. ""Oh, you mean the ghost Tavia was telling us about. Well, I am sure to be better, and then we may have a chance to prove that there is absolutely no such thing in this world as ghosts,"" and with a fond embrace Dorothy dismissed the boy with the yellow hair, so like her own, and eyes just as blue. Surely Roger and Dorothy belonged to the Dales, while Joe, with his dark, rich coloring, was like the other branch of their family.It was not an easy matter, however, for Dorothy to actually get to sleep that night. So many thoughts crowded her brain: Tavia was acting queerly about something, and it was perfectly plain to everybody she wanted to talk to Nat alone, directly after the evening meal. Tavia was not a silly girl--she would never risk such criticism if something quite serious did not make it necessary. Then how that woman in black looked at Tavia when they entered the train for home! She had to take the same train to get back from town; that was easily understood, as few trains passed in and out to the city, even in holiday time. But why did she sit opposite them again?So Dorothy's thoughts ran riot, and her head ached proportionately. Finally she heard Tavia steal into the room; felt she was looking down to see if slumber had come; then, being satisfied that Dorothy was actually asleep, she went out and turned the hall light very low.Dorothy was asleep. She dreamed of everything--the superintendent's office, of Miss Allen's sweet face, of how confused the other clerk became--it was all perfectly clear yet so closely interwoven as to be inextricable, after the manner of most feverish dreams.""Then turn right over before you get too wide awake,"" advised Tavia. ""Here is some lemonade Aunt Winnie said you were to drink."" Tavia always called Mrs. White Aunt Winnie. ""And you are to remain in bed for breakfast. Oh, for an aristocratic head that would ache! And oh, for one dear, long, luscious, lumpy day in bed! With meals à la tray, and beef tea in the intervals. But I must not talk you awake. There,"" and she kissed her friend lightly, ""I'll tumble in, for I really am dead tired."""
"But Tavia's head did not ache. She ""tumbled in"" as she promised, but did not immediately try to sleep. She was, instead, trying to arrange some things clearly before her much-confused faculties--trying to decide what she should write home. She had her mother's pin and Johnnie's steam engine, thanks to Dorothy's good nature, but what about paying Dorothy back? Where was the money to come from, and what possible explanation could she make? Tell her she had not spent her own five dollars, but instead had mailed it to a strange woman in a strange place, on the printed promise that in place of five she would get--Closing the door softly, Tavia took from the blue envelope a printed slip. She looked it over critically, then with a look of utter disgust replaced it in the envelope, and folding that so it would fit into a very small compass, put it away again.""And to think I should have gotten Nat into such a thing!"" she was thinking. ""It was good of him to be so nice about it--but, all the same, I did feel awfully, and I wish this very minute I was at home in my own shabby little room, next to Johnnie's.""Tavia rarely cried, but this time she felt there was simply nothing else left to do. Bravely she struggled to choke her sobs; then at last fixing her mind successfully upon a plan to straighten out her difficulties (or, at least, she thought it would adjust them), the girl with the tear-stained, hazel eyes and the much-tangled, bronze braids, found herself forgetting where she was, what she was thinking about, whether she was Nat or Dorothy.""Likely,"" answered Dorothy, ""but I am anxious to get the tree, and if we do not get it before the storm comes we will have to take a boughten one. But I do so love a hand-picked tree. It has always been a part of our Christmas to get one.""But the severe cold of the morning precluded the idea of an auto ride in search of the tree, and the time was spent in many little preparations for the holiday--odds and ends that ever hang on, in spite of the most carefully-laid plans to get through in good time.Joe and Roger went off to the skating-pond directly after luncheon, and Dorothy, eager to get the tree before the storm should break (for every one said it would surely snow before nightfall), proposed the trip to the woods.""I did hope to get one for little Ben,"" confessed Dorothy. ""He is always so delighted when I tell him how things grow away out in the woods. Poor little chap! Isn't it a pity he can never hope to be better?""""I thought you particularly wanted to see the ghost?"" teased Nat. ""There, what's that? I am sure I saw something up in the castle. Come on, let's get out and try the old knocker. If some of the antique fellows knew old brass affair was on that door they would come over and get the door.""""It certainly said some thing,"" his brother added. ""Well, I suppose we will have to please the ladies and turn out,"" he finished. Then Dorothy and Nat climbed back into the car, and the pretty Christmas tree was left behind with the other queer things in Tanglewood Park."
"That evening the boys had no end of fun teasing the girls. That Dorothy and Tavia should have been so easily frightened, that Tavia should have ""turned turtle,"" as Ned put it, and that Dorothy ""should have run under fire,"" and left the coveted tree behind, seemed to the boys beyond explanation.Listening to their telling of the affair, Major Dale became interested, and soon discovered that the old Mayberry Mansion, in Tanglewood Park, was none other than the former home of a veteran of the war, who had been in the same regiment with the major.""I knew him well,"" volunteered Dorothy's father. ""He was a fine fellow, but always a little queer. Seems to me he had a sister or step-sister. Her name was--Pumfret. Yes, that was it. I always thought it such a queer name, and many a time saw it written by the captain on his letters home.""""Indeed, I'm not the least bit afraid,"" declared his cousin. ""I did hear something like a scream, and I don't believe in ghosts. Therefore I should very much like to have a chance to investigate the matter.""There was, however, some whispering between the boys before they left the room. Then Nat stayed behind and detained the girls--he had something very important to consult them about. Ned and the younger boys went directly upstairs.A half hour might have passed, during which time Nat seemed at his wits' end in his efforts to keep the girls interested. Finally Dorothy jumped up and declared she was going upstairs. Tavia followed, but Nat managed to reach the second landing in advance of them by going up the servants' stairs.Between the two alcove rooms, occupied by Dorothy and Tavia, was a long wardrobe closet. Into this both girls put such belongings as might not be used daily--a sort of ""dress-up"" clothes' closet. It was in this closet that street apparel was placed, so that on the night of the auto ride both Dorothy and Tavia had something to hang on the padded hooks there.A moment later she followed Dorothy out to the hall closet. Dorothy had stepped back to make room for her chum. Tavia pushed some garments rather roughly aside to make a place for the heavy cloak, thrusting her arm well into the depths of the closet. No sooner had she done so than she jumped back, uttering a scream of fright.Dorothy did not pause to turn up the lights. She swung around and fled with Tavia, who continued to scream, while Dorothy, too, uttered frightened cries. There were calls sounding throughout the house--voices anxiously demanding to know what the matter was. The girls ran down the front stairs, and then swung around and darted up the rear flight that they might reach the room of the boys without passing the closet which contained something that had frightened them so terribly.But somehow the boys could not seem to hurry. Dorothy and Tavia were almost in hysterics before Ned finally opened the door, just as if nothing had happened. He was fully dressed, and it did seem as if he might have responded more quickly to the frightened summons."
"""A man--a man--in the hall closet--he nearly grabbed me!"" cried Tavia, ""I put my arm in--to hang up my cloak--I shoved the clothes aside--then I--I felt--something--terrible. Then I'm sure I saw--oh, for pity's sake get help--don't go alone--he may kill all of us!""""Oh, come on,"" exclaimed Ned as he stepped out into the hall. ""I guess we can manage a little thing like this. Come on; we'll see what it is that frightened you. Likely it was only Tavia's excited imagination.""At this he lightly shook off Dorothy's detaining hand, and started down the long hall toward the closet. Nat and the other boys were in the hall now, and in spite of her terror Dorothy noticed that they were all dressed, though it was supposed they had all retired--especially Roger and Joe, who should have been asleep long ago.Each seemed to attribute the success of the ""ghost"" to his own particular talent in that line, and when finally Mrs. White insisted that every one go to bed, echoes of laughter would peal out from behind closed doors, and the girls promised to get even, if they had to do so out in Tanglewood Park, ""where the real ghost would not stand for any nonsense."" Again Dorothy invited Tavia to go to the city with her, but Tavia refused on the plea that her head threatened to ache, and she thought it best to stay at home. So on the morning following the boys' joke with the stuffed man, Dorothy got ready early and hurried for the business train to the city.She reached the station just in time--merely had her ticket bought when the train steamed in--and making her way among the crowds of men, she was able to reach a seat in one of the coaches where a few women were scattered in with the many gentlemen who patronized the express.""I saw when she dropped the envelope in the train that her name was Travers, and I thought if she would call on me I might be able to help her in a little business matter. It is of rather a delicate nature,"" the woman added, smiling, ""so you will excuse me for being so mysterious.""As she read the card it flashed through Dorothy's mind that after all the woman might simply be trying to get trade. There seemed to be some connection between Tavia's envelope and the business advertised on Miss Brooks' card. But whatever could she want of Tavia? Surely she could not imagine a young girl needing the services of an expert penman?""I saw your trouble in the store the other day,"" Miss Brooks ventured, ""and was so sorry for you. I did want to help you--to tell that young woman detective just what I thought. But experience has taught me that it is not always best to interfere in such cases. It often only adds to the difficulty.""Dorothy could not find words in which to reply. Whatever she might say would either seem stupid or perhaps suspicious. And of the subtle ways of women ""sharpers"" Dorothy had often heard. It was, she decided, almost impossible to be sufficiently alert to offset their cunning. Perhaps this woman was one of that class--an adept at it.Dorothy knew the Griswold to be a rest resort, a sort of sanitarium where fashionable people went to recuperate from home or social duties. This Miss Brooks did not appear to be in the circumstances of those who frequented the Griswold, the girl thought."
"""I thought so,"" went on her companion. ""Well, she is evidently impetuous; that is why I feel I may help her. Ordinarily I would not interfere--it is really a trifle risky for me, but she seems so young; and--well, I'll take my chances this time.""Dorothy was completely mystified. She could not guess at any business or circumstances which might occasion such remarks. But somehow she felt that the woman spoke with knowledge of something about Tavia. What that something might be Dorothy was absolutely at a loss to conjecture.The train was slacking up as it steamed into the big, arched station. Here Miss Brooks would go her way, while Dorothy would be left to think over the unexpected happenings of the brief railroad journey.There seemed to Dorothy something almost patronizing in the stranger's manner as she bade her good-by. Perhaps she did pity her--but why? What was wrong, or what might happen on this day's shopping venture?""I really do believe I'm getting queer myself,"" mused the girl, trying vainly to shake off her fears and suspicions. ""Well, so many queer things do manage to happen in a single holiday vacation I don't wonder that I catch the germ; it must be infectious.""Dorothy was now almost as greatly mystified as she had been when the woman on the train spoke of Tavia. But Miss Allen went to wait on another customer, and when Dorothy had finally succeeded in selecting some trinkets she left the counter with Miss Allen's words ringing in her ears.""But your motto will not stand the test,"" declared Dorothy. ""I happen to know--I found out to-day. Going in on the train I 'loafed' all the way, and the process tired me. Coming out I was tired from shopping, and that tire rested me.""""Well, if you're all right, I'm glad I'm crazy,"" declared Tavia facetiously. ""There's just one thing I want to get to heaven for--one great, long, delicious loaf! If I cannot rest without labor, then please pass along the 'loaf.'""""Likely,"" replied Dorothy; ""but he did not occupy the entire ten coaches, although he managed to circulate through them rather successfully. But I did not refer to him. I sat in the same seat with--our little woman in black!""""So many queer things contrived to happen,"" continued Dorothy, noting the slight agitation her chum betrayed. ""The clerk at the jewelry counter--Miss Allen, the pleasant girl--told me the woman detective, Miss Dearing, had been discharged.""""It is a little early, but they say express packages are always sure to be delayed at this season, and I would simply not live through it if Johnnie did not have his steam engine for Christmas morning. It was awfully sweet of you, Doro, to lend me that money."""
"Tavia's brow was clouded. What an opportunity for her confession! Why did she so dread to tell Dorothy what her own five dollars had gone for? Nat said it would positively leak out some day. Yet he promised not to tell.""Why,"" stammered Tavia, ""I don't know that I will go at all. Such a wild-goose chase! I am really not so curious as some might think me. I can overcome a desire for further knowledge of that peaked little thing. In fact, she makes me--creepy.""""I must sew the ribbons on Aunt Winnie's bag,"" went on Dorothy pleasantly after a pause. ""Don't you think it pretty?"" and she displayed a small bag made of white oiled silk and fitted up with all the little pockets needed in traveling. One for the wet sponge, another for the toothbrush, then a place for soap; in fact, a place for everything necessary in the emergency of traveling.Dorothy could not help thinking that so urgent a matter as one which required that attention would scarcely be so easily forgotten, but when Tavia left the room she put her little gifts away and soon forgot all about Tavia's sudden determination to seek Nat. Dorothy had so many other more interesting things to dwell upon.""But I do hope she will not sit up late,"" came the thought, when some time after Tavia's exit Dorothy remembered that no sound had since indicated that her chum had come toward the room. ""Aunt Winnie does not like these little late conferences.""Meanwhile, Tavia was talking very seriously to Nat. She had told him about Dorothy's message from the strange woman, and he had suggested that the handwriting expert might in some way be connected with the Chicago firm to which Tavia had written, and through which she had made her financial--mistake. ""I have it all planned,"" announced Mrs. White the next morning. ""The boys are to go for evergreens, and the girls are to assist me here. It is rather early, but it is best to have the greens on time.""Ned and Nat groaned. It would be dull enough to go for evergreens, but with the possibility of ""a scare in the woods"" for Dorothy and Tavia it might be bearable, whereas, if the girls would be obliged to remain at home--Ned and Nat thought seriously over the prospect of hunting evergreens with two ""kids."" They liked their little cousins--in fact, were very fond of them--but it did seem to the larger boys that there would not be much fun in scouring the woods for greens, and answering small boys' questions, unlimited.""Whew!"" whistled the handsome Roland as soon as the party got away from The Cedars. ""What a stunner your blonde cousin is, Ned! Seems to me you might have prepared a fellow. I almost had a spell when she came to greet me."""
"Now, Ned White never relished hearing other fellows admire Dorothy. It was a strange fact that while he knew Dorothy to be pretty he was never prepared to hear others say so. Nat picked up the end of Roland's remark. He knew Ned would not say anything very agreeable to it.""Guess that's it,"" answered Tom. ""But certainly those two girls are equal to putting you through a lively holiday. Wish we had a pair like them down to The Elms for this spell. Gee--I just dread this Christmas stuff. Aunts and uncles have my bedroom lined with 'secret packages' already. I went on the 'collar button crawl' this morning, and nearly fainted when I saw the stuff under my bed. Aunt Molly runs some kind of a charity jinks, you know, and she has picked out my room as the safest place to hide her trash.""""I see something like a cabin over there,"" said Joe, pointing to a corner in the woods where great oak trees towered above all others in the grove. Even in December some brown leaves clung to these giants of the forest, that now rustled a gentle welcome to the boys in the Fire Bird.Roger was back with the bag of charcoal, and now they all entered the old hut. The place had evidently been long ago left to the squirrels and wood birds, but it was clean, save for the refuse of dry leaves and bits of bark, remnants of other winters, when the broken windows accepted what the winds chose to hurl in and scatter about the old woodchopper's cabin.""We don't light the fire there,"" said Nat ""Better pick that up and dump it on the fireplace. Isn't this great, though? Glad I came! Fellows, help yourselves,"" and he stretched out on a rude board bench that lined one side of the place.It occurred to Roger that some boys, big ones at that, might be just as silly as girls--in fact, more silly than most girls, for when they said foolish things they invariably took the trouble to laugh at their own attempts. Now, thought Roger, girls never do that. Close upon the heels of that thought sprang into the little fellow's heart the wish that Dorothy might have been along. She would know just how to arrange the dinner so that the big fellows did not get the best pieces.""A woodchopper's cabin,"" Ned replied. ""There was fine wood in these parts some years ago, before the telephone company bought up all the tall trees. Uncle Frank--Major Dale, you know--was telling us only the other night about it. Some ten years ago a telephone inspector came out here and bargained for the whole grove--that is, all the good, sound trees. Then the woodchoppers went back to Canada.""An old grate had been found about the place, and upon this the sliced bacon was spread, while the potatoes were dropped directly into the embers. Norah had thought of everything, even paper napkins and picnic knives and forks. There was, too, a bottle of olives and some cold ham in the very bottom of the basket."
"""I'm first there,"" put in Tom. ""I met her at the kitchen door as I went around for the oil can. And I must say I rather like that shade of hair. Our shortstop had it, and he claimed it was classic--called it mahogany, too.""It was a queer sort of picnic--a ""smoker,"" Tom insisted, for something happened with the fire that caused the smoke to flare back into the cabin instead of going peaceably out of the little chimney. But the boys did not mind that--they were too interested in the meal. Even Norah's good nature could scarcely estimate on a dinner of this kind. Eating seemed to cause hunger, instead of allaying the sensation.All agreed the spot would be ideal for a summer camp, and when they had entered the Fire Bird and swung again out upon the wagon road, some of the party rather blamed the kind of holiday that required greens, when such a fine day might have been spent in the woodchopper's cabin. Ned White thought he knew all the roads about Ferndale and the Birchlands, but on this afternoon he stumbled with his party into a perfectly strange byway. It did not seem to lead to any place in particular, but was one of those wagon roads cut through private property and public places alike, without regard to direction or terminus.""Now, see here,"" interrupted Roland. ""I've got a dinner date to-night. Sort of a 'return of the prodigal,' you know. I can't be late. So please don't go too far from Mother Earth. If necessary we can get the greens some other day.""""All right,"" agreed Ned. ""If we can't make the park in half an hour we'll turn back. But I wonder some of you smart ones did not think of it before. There certainly were plenty of green bushes out there.""Under the heavy trees it was almost like night, and it was not an easy task to distinguish one bush from another, especially as Roland kept hurrying everybody, in his anxiety to be on time at the dinner party.Joe and Roger secured some fine branches of the spruces that Dorothy had wished for, Ned got quite a supply of pine branches, which he declared, ""could go up just as they were,"" while the other boys devoted themselves to the laurel hunt. Finally a large hedge of this all-winter green shrub was discovered, and in a short time the Fire Bird was loaded up with a splendid supply of Christmas evergreens.A light carriage entered the driveway. The woman stopped to give some directions. The driver seemed to hesitate. She was urging him to go toward the castle, and he evidently wanted to go out on the main road.""That woman doesn't look as if she could throw anything--not even her voice,"" remarked Roland, when the carriage had passed. ""But I fancy the old colored fellow is about ready to 'throw a fit,' at any rate."""
"""Let us out here,"" said Tom as Ned prepared to run into The Elms. ""We can get our blood in circulation before we reach the fire. Whew! it is cold! Well, say, we've had an awfully jolly time, fellows. Hope we can make it up to you--""""Norah's got a beau!"" called back Nat as the Fire Bird rolled into The Cedars and the carload of evergreens was stopped at the door. Dorothy, Tavia and Mrs. White stood in rapt surprise and admiration over the ""greenstuff"" that had been gathered, in spite of all the difficulties which had been encountered in the attempt.""Well, I'm just a little glad of it, Doro, for the fact is I think I might inveigle him into taking care of me at the 'doings.' Now, I happen to know he fancies you, and my only chance is that you may turn him down.""Dorothy laughed merrily. She was no prude, and made no pretense of being one. She enjoyed most of the nonsense that girls between fifteen and eighteen years of age usually enjoy. The strange young men, Tom Jennings and Roland Scott, whom the White boys had taken to the woods on the ""evergreen hunt,"" called that very morning--came to make their ""party call,"" they said.Finally Tom came to the rescue by telling about the ""ghost scream."" Tavia was much interested, but Dorothy laughed at the idea. She had any amount of explanations to offer for the queer occurrence, but none of them was accepted as being plausible.Then Dorothy told the visitors of the Christmas plans--at least, she attempted to tell them, but was interrupted by the coming of Ned and Nat. So the girls were excused and the boys left to their own resources.""And Mr. Scott might be something on the Christmas tree,"" returned Dorothy. ""In a pretty, striped dress he would make a dear little cornucopia, his blond head sticking out of the top like a sweet little doll.""""But college boys are old enough to be engaged,"" said Dorothy, ""and perhaps we will get no more of their attention than was bestowed upon us to-day,"" and she made a wry face to express her fears on that score.Tavia's love for idleness was no hidden sin--she seemed to glory in it. But occasionally it betrayed her good intentions. She really did intend to put the pretty blue lining in the dainty darning bag which Mrs. White was making as a gift for old Mrs. Brown, the family mender. Now the chatter about the college boys had completely driven the task from her mind.As Mrs. White appeared in the hall Tavia grasped the neglected little article. Dorothy had been sewing as she talked. She loved to do certain kinds of stitches, particularly those of floss silk on fine flannel, and this morning she had almost finished the shawl for John's wife's new baby."
"Mrs. White had been out, and was just returning. She wore her handsome prune-colored gown, with her mink-tail furs, and both Dorothy and Tavia looked up in undisguised admiration as she entered the room.""Well, it is finally settled,"" Mrs. White began. ""I do think these charity affairs are growing more complicated every year. I have not told you all about it yet; in fact, I could not do so until this morning's meeting was over. Now it is all arranged, so I must tell you about it.""""No, my dear. We had chocolate at Mrs. Davis's. There, now, I am quite comfortable,"" and as Dorothy laid the wraps aside her aunt settled among the blue cushions, which, as Nat said, ""grew in Dorothy's room.""""And we are to select the scenes,"" went on Mrs. White, ""so you may start in to think of Mother Goose just as soon as you like. For my part, all I can remember is the old woman who lived in a shoe, and I am going to get the boys to make me a shoe big enough to hold all the small children in the Birchlands.""""And let me be the mother?"" asked Tavia. ""I want to whip those Mahon children, and this would be my chance. They ran a pole out in the road against my wheel last fall, and you may remember the consequences.""""Why, of course, my dear, there are to be boys. Who ever heard of a hospital benefit without them. We have to raise one hundred dollars this year. And I feel the whole responsibility, as I am the local member of the board of directors. I hope some day we will be able to have a hospital of our own. Supporting a ward in a city institution is not very satisfactory.""""Oh, that is quite natural for you to think that way,"" teased Mrs. White. ""But haven't you taken into consideration Mr. Scott and Mr. Jennings? Why, they are capable of impersonating a number of characters. Think it all up, girls, and you will help me greatly. I have asked Ned to fetch a Mother Goose book from the village, and this evening we will devote our time to selecting the characters.""Dorothy was glad to get acquainted with Tom. Somehow he made her think of soldiers, of fearless brave men like Major Dale, and perhaps her Uncle Winthrop White, who had died away off in a foreign country, fighting for science. Perhaps he was of this type when at college.Nor did it take Tom long to discover what sort of conversation would interest Dorothy. He talked of his school, and asked about Glenwood. Then she introduced the Mother Goose subject, and he told of a college play his class had given wherein all the characters were taken by the students."
"""Then I'm going to get Ned to let me come over,"" said her companion. ""It will help fill in; our folks are just choked to death in Christmas stuff. Aunt Emily is interested in the hospital benefit, too, I believe.""""Oh, are they?"" remarked Tom in seeming earnestness. ""Well, to tell you the truth I have given up attempting to judge of girls' looks lately. It seems to me to be all a question of hair--how deep it can be piled up.""""Oh, I forgot,"" exclaimed Tavia suddenly. ""I have an engagement for this afternoon. I ought to go back, Ned. It must be lunch-time."" And, as she spoke, Dorothy remembered that the day was Thursday, and that Tavia was to go on that day to see Miss Estelle Brooks, the little woman in black. ""You must contrive to help me, Nat,"" urged Tavia, when, an hour or so later, she managed to get a word alone with him. ""I can never deliberately go off alone on an afternoon like this, when every one is so busy.""""Seems to understand it, at any rate. It won't do any harm to talk with her. I'll manage to get the machine out, and then, all in a flash, you ask if I won't take you, pretending you did not plan it. I don't see any other way out of it.""""Oh, never mind me,"" replied the youth good-naturedly. ""Guess I'm big enough to take care of myself. Clear off, now, and when you hear three toots you will know that is the signal. I'll get ready under pretense of going into town for something, and it won't take long to get out to Ferndale.""Tavia ran back to where Dorothy and Mrs. White were busy putting bows of bright ribbon on gifts, and sealing up parcels with the Merry Christmas stamps. Her cheeks were blazing and her eyes dancing from pent-up nervous strain. She grew more nervous each moment. Surely Dorothy would notice it, she thought. And then, too, Dorothy had told her Miss Brooks had asked to see her on Thursday. Would she remember that now?""And do you fool yourself that you are deceiving her?"" asked the cousin. ""I'll bet she comes pretty near guessing it all, and for my part I cannot see why you do not up and tell her. It is no great crime to--"""
"The Griswold was a large, stone building, originally intended to be used as a handsome private residence, but of late years converted into a rest-resort or sanitarium. Tavia mounted the broad steps timidly and touched the old-fashioned knocker. In a moment a butler appeared and took her card for Miss Brooks, while Tavia waited in the spacious reception-room. She noticed that this apartment was almost overcrowded with gilt-framed pictures, some paintings, others evidently family portraits.Presently Miss Brooks entered. She wore a simple, close-fitting black gown, and Tavia felt instinctively that this little woman possessed a powerful personality. She was even inclined to fear her, although this sentiment might be a matter of nervous excitement rather than the result of well-founded antipathy.Tavia smiled and murmured something as she followed Miss Brooks up the soft, carpeted stairs. At the first landing the woman opened a door, and motioned Tavia to step in. The room was large and well-furnished after the regulation boarding-house plan--dressing-table, desk, couch-bed, and curtained bookcase, but no article of furniture indicated any line of business that might be carried on in the room, Tavia observed.""Well, I asked you to come, Miss Travers, because I felt I could help you. I make few friends--the world played me false long ago--but when I see a young girl like you in danger, I am not too bitter to warn her.""""You no doubt think me a strange woman--every one does--but I have a motive in traveling about. I had a very dear sister whom I lost years ago. Lately I have learned that she died in this section of the country. She left a child--a baby girl--and I hope some day I may find that child."" Miss Brooks paused to cover her eyes with her slim hand. Tavia noticed that her hands were white and shapely. After a moment's hesitation Miss Brooks continued in the same business-like voice she had at first assumed.""As I have said, I think I can help you."" She crossed to the dressing-table, opened a drawer and took from it a large envelope. From this envelope she unfolded a sheet of closely typewritten paper. This she showed to Tavia.""You are astonished that I should have your letter,"" said the woman. ""But so-called confidential correspondence travels many miles these days. I address letters and do penwork for business firms, and have received your letter among hundreds of others.""""Oh!"" and the woman's eyebrows went up in surprise. ""Yes, I see. Nathaniel White,"" and she ran her fingers through a package of coupons. ""Of course, he belongs here. He is one of the gentlemen from The Cedars?"""
"""I had not the slightest intention of speaking to him, child. In fact, it would not do for me to make known my business to the patrons of this house. You see, I came here, as I was told this was one of the oldest-established sanitariums in the State, and I hoped, in a vague way, to hear something of my poor sister Marie.""""The only way I might be of service to you,"" said Miss Brooks, as she folded up the letter, ""would be by giving you some advice. You see, I cannot betray a firm I am employed by. But the method I would advise you to follow is being used every day by--victims. It is merely a matter of threatening to expose the scheme--they know the business is unlawful.""""All the more reason why they would pay attention to your letter,"" argued Miss Brooks. ""But, of course, if you feel that way about it, all I can say is that you know how easily a young girl may be deceived, and, in the future, avoid such alluring promises. You could never expect any return from that sort of advertising.""Tavia was on her feet to go. She was disappointed. She felt the advice painfully unnecessary. In making mistakes she boasted of the faculty of always finding a new one--she never was known to repeat a downright error.""Well, Tavia,"" said Nat not unkindly, but with more determination than it was usual for him to show, ""I don't believe in letting money go as easily as all that, and if there is any possibility of us recovering it, it is 'up to us' to try. You know I am no 'knocker,' but I would rather have my 'tenner' than that slip of baby-blue paper.""Tavia did not answer. She was beginning to feel the consequences of her error. She never could stand being thus obligated to Nat--and she a guest at his house! Her humiliation was crushing. Nat had never spoken to her that way before.All the Christmas preparations had lost interest for Tavia now, and when, that afternoon, Dorothy and Mrs. White went on with their work of love, she sat up in her own room writing and re-writing a letter. Finally it read: ""DEAR OLD MUMSEY: I hope you have received your pin, and that you have carefully hidden away Johnnie's steam engine. I know he will be delighted with it. Now, mumsey, dear, I have a great favor to ask. Could you possibly let me have five dollars more? I will send it back before my holiday is over, because I only want to lend it to some one, and I am sure to get it back. But, you see, no one has ever asked such a favor of me before, and I do wish I could accommodate them. Don't say anything to dad about it, but just send it along if you possibly can, and I will surely send it back very soon. I am having a lovely time, but feel I ought to be home with you all for my real Christmas."
"""I am sure,"" retaliated Dorothy, ""they will know yours instantly. But it is a pity we have to make them living pictures. You will hardly be able to refrain from actually putting in your thumb if we provide one of Norah's pies.""""And what a perfectly darling 'Little Jack Horner!'"" added Tavia, for the characters were being selected with a view to making them as ridiculous as possible, and Tom would make a very funny ""Jack Horner."" Tom surveyed his thumb in anticipation.Roland and Tavia were assigned ""Jack Spratt and His Wife."" Roland could be made up to look very lean, indeed, and Tavia was just stout enough to be ""practical for building purposes."" Her face was of the broad, good-natured type, and so her figure could readily be built up to correspond.Nat insisted on being ""Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater,"" and wanted to have the privilege of selecting the pretty Eva Brownlie to put in the pumpkin shell, ""for,"" argued Nat, ""that is the only way any fellow will ever be able to keep the wily Eva.""This was how it was with Roland, and on account of the trifling accident the party was obliged to break up before all the arrangements had been completed, and Tom had to assist Roland back to The Elms.From that time on ""the play was the thing"" at The Cedars, and, indeed, the whole little village of North Birchland seemed deeply interested in the affair to be held for the Hillside Hospital benefit. Naturally, there was considerable rivalry when the parts were assigned, but Mrs. White, with the other ladies on the board of managers, understood and expected this, so they were ready to meet the objections of some and the requests of others.Roland was there, as Ned had promised, ""spry and as pretty as ever."" He appeared to ""hang around Dorothy,"" but she was too busy to notice the attention. Tavia, however, did not miss observing the young man's attempts to attract Dorothy, and she also noted that the same matter seemed distasteful to Ned.Tom had a way of helping every one. He laughed with all the girls, and had plenty of jollity left for the boys--he was considered an ""all-around good fellow."" Naturally, Dorothy felt at ease with him, but Edith Brownlie made no pretense of hiding her intentions--she wanted to be in a picture with Tom.To this Ned readily agreed, with the result that the rehearsal of the part caused no end of merriment. Agnes was a jolly girl, and showed a decided preference for the White boys--those from Ferndale never appeared to interest the wealthy Agnes.When the rehearsal was finally over Dorothy was very tired, for she felt a personal interest in the affair, as it was almost entirely in Mrs. White's hands. The others had all congregated about Mrs. Brownlie's tea-table, where that lady was dispensing the refreshing beverage, but Dorothy sank down for a few moments in a secluded corner of the parlor where the practice had been held.Presently she thought she heard something stir near her, then she distinctly heard a sob. Brushing aside the heavy portière, Dorothy found little Mary Manning, her face hidden in her hands, and her whole slender form shaking convulsively.It then occurred to Dorothy that surely enough no one had thought of Mary, for from the time when the parts were given out until all the rehearsal was over Mary had never once either been seen or heard from. She was poor, not pretty, and not popular, but since she belonged to the auxiliary it was certainly too bad to have overlooked her.""Well, we must give you a pretty part,"" promised Dorothy. ""And I tell you, just come over to The Cedars to-morrow and Aunt Winnie--Mrs. White--will have it all made out for you. There, now, don't cry another tear. Come out to the tea-room with me and forget all your troubles. No, your eyes are not red. Come along,"" and she slipped her arm through that of little Mary, while she led the child out to the party of gay young folks, there to entertain her and bring to the queer little girl that sort of enjoyment which often follows acute grief--a reaction as uncontrollable as had been the bitterness which had caused the sorrow."
"It was very near Christmas, and events were crowding about The Cedars. Dorothy, as usual, had assumed more than her share of responsibility, for Tavia somehow acted queerly. She spent much time running back and forth to the post-office, and it was evident to all that she and Nat were not the friends they had been previously. Besides this, Ned had spoken to Dorothy, and had actually asked her not to ""flirt"" with those college boys!This was unlike Ned, and a positive shock to Dorothy. To be sure, he chose the word ""flirt"" indifferently, but to Dorothy it had an ugly sound, and that night, after all her worries at the rehearsal, she went to bed with a pair of very red eyes.Perhaps it was the rush and excitement that caused every one to be so irritable and to so misunderstand things. Certainly Tavia had some worry, and Ned did not act like himself, while Nat looked miserable. It would be a queer holiday unless things mended promptly.She wanted to be alone--to think about what Ned had said, to look over everything carefully, and see if he had any excuse for such a remark. Had she acted foolishly? Could her innocent freedom with Tom Jennings be misunderstood? Was it not possible for a girl to act naturally after she had passed the age of fifteen years?Her head filled with such thoughts as these, in all the power that they may assume when first encountered by a young girl, Dorothy hurried along. She would simply tell Ned all about it, she decided. He surely would understand that she never dreamed of ""flirting.""""I guess we will have pleasant weather,"" Dorothy hurried to say vaguely. ""I hope so, at any rate, for we must depend considerably upon the weather for the success of our hospital entertainment. You know, we are to have one.""""I know,"" she went on, ""that Miss Travers is greatly worried over a matter of money. I advised her how she could be relieved of that worry, but in spite of my advice I have reason to think that she has only made matters worse by writing to her folks at home and asking them for more money.""""Yes; I am sorry to seem a meddler, but I feel that she will greatly complicate matters unless you are clever enough to step in and interfere. It is the old story of the tangled web; Miss Travers had no idea of doing anything--irregular. She simply did as thousands of others do, though I must say boys are usually the victims. A girl rarely takes such chances.""""Well, I must confess it may be difficult, but I see no other way to get her out of her troubles, for she is surely multiplying them. The latest phase of her difficulty I may tell you of without any risk of betraying professional confidence,"" and Miss Brooks smiled faintly. ""She has lately written to her father and to her mother for money--urging some trifling excuse. Letters intended for her have fallen into her father's hands. He is a lawyer, or in some way connected with legal affairs, is he not?"""
"""Oh, yes, that's it. Well, he has put two and two together, and has sent the last letter she wrote him out to a firm in Chicago, asking them to state clearly, and at once, what their business has been with his daughter, as he has reason to believe that it is because of this business that his daughter is worried about money and is trying to get it for some secret purpose. You see, he has inferred that she is trying to get the money on account of her dealings with this firm. The letters written to her show that.""""In one of two ways. Either get ten dollars for her in some way that she may return the money to her parents if they have already sent it, or induce her to write at once to her father, telling him frankly all about the matter and stating that she does not now require the ten dollars. She evidently wants that amount to pay some one who has lost on her account.""Dorothy smiled and bowed, but her anxiety had promptly written the lines of care on her fair young face, and even the aged postmaster did not fail to ask her if anything was wrong at The Cedars when he handed her the mail.That afternoon the Fire Bird brought the evergreens from The Cedars--those which had been gathered some few days before and had since been stored carefully in the garage--and an additional supply came from Ferndale, the result of an enterprising expedition to the woods, under the management of Miss Agnes Sinclair.Little Mary Mahon was the first to come--in accordance with Dorothy's arrangements, for Mary was to rehearse her part before the others would get there, and just what her number would be was to be kept secret.The Brownlie girls, Eva and Edith, understood the remark Dorothy made as she entered, and so left the parlors entirely at her disposal, even locking the door from the hall and throwing open the library to accommodate any one who might come before Mary's ""practice"" was over.A recitation had been selected for Mary--one that afforded ample opportunity for the child's natural talent to act--for she had talent, and both Mrs. White and Dorothy were delighted with the prospect of what the queer child would add to the program.The recitation chosen for her was ""Guilty or Not Guilty?"" and it seemed to suit her strangely. Of course, when a child is almost constantly in the company of aged persons, and takes no pleasure in play, besides being over-studious, she is bound to be ""queer.""When Dorothy threw open the parlor door after the rehearsal her face was radiant. She was pleased--delighted with Mary, and the girls waiting to be admitted to the ""hall"" exchanged knowing glances when Dorothy told them the room was ready.Tom and Roland were there, Agnes Sinclair, Mabel Hastings, Ned, and Nat, of course; Tavia was with Eva Brownlie, chatting as if there was nothing else to be done that evening; Betty Bindley managed to get her dainty little self secure with Harold Osborne (Handsome Harold, they called him), and other members of the auxiliary and their friends were there ready to begin the work of rehearsing and decorating.Besides the pictures there was to be music--the Brownlie girls played the violin beautifully, and Dorothy was an acknowledged pianist; then Agnes Sinclair was to entertain with monologues, and the boys were to have a vocal double quartette.""Come,"" he said very kindly, ""I've got a quiet job for you. You usually get too much of the all-around business. Let us run a race making the wreath, or strings, I suppose you want. Here, Ned,"" he called across the room, ""get your stuff and your girl, and I'll race you for a mile of green string.""Tavia protested, of course, and soon the room was in an uproar. Finally the ladies insisted the wreaths should be put up, and when the chairs and stepladders had been brought the boys began festooning the long strings of green about the room, over windows and doors, and about the finely-fluted posts that marked the arches.""Here, Dorothy,"" called Tom. ""You are not to work. This sofa is especially provided for our comfort. Here, sit down,"" and taking her arm, he attempted to lead her away from the ladder upon which Ned stood.A moment later Ned swayed toward her. She had released her hold of the rope, and the sudden easing of the strain which the youth put upon it caused him to lose his balance. He swayed still farther away from the ladder, and thrust out his hands to grasp the rungs. He dropped the rope, and as Dorothy gave a frightened scream he crashed to the floor, right at her feet, narrowly missing striking her."
"Tavia wanted to stay, but not even Dorothy was accorded that privilege. Tom remained with Mrs. White, and Nat went for the Fire Bird, in which to take his brother and mother home, there being no room for the others in it now.""That must depend entirely upon ourselves,"" insisted the practical Dorothy. ""But we will have trouble in getting some one to take Ned's place-- Oh, dear, if I had only--but there's no use lamenting."" And when Roland said good-night at the door Dorothy went directly to her own room--she was too much depressed to join the family's expression of anxieties.If the play was a success she had hoped to get little Bennie Baglin into the hospital. He suffered so, and surely could be helped, if not cured, by proper treatment. But the hospital would only accept patients from the Birchlands according as money was contributed from the place, and it would cost considerable to have an incurable (as Bennie was) taken in.""Now just keep quiet, and don't attempt to move unaided,"" said the doctor, ""and we'll see how it is in the morning. I think, Mrs. White, you might make him comfortable to-night on this floor. It will be safer.""Acting on the doctor's advice, the injured young man was made comfortable in the library for the night. Nat wanted to stay with him--there were plenty of divans and couches that might be used in the emergency--but Mrs. White insisted upon caring for the boy herself. She noticed he was becoming feverish, and so hurried the others off to bed that the house might be quiet.How strangely depressing was the house now with the gloom of sickness upon it! The awful uncertainty of an accident, what the result might be, how serious or trifling--every possibility seemed weighted with terrible consequences.Dorothy fell upon her knees beside her bed. Her heart was very full, everything seemed dark and gloomy now. All the difficulties of yesterday were engulfed in that one sorrow--Ned's accident. Dorothy seemed unable to pray, and in her sadness came the thought of her own unwilling part in the little tragedy.""Yes, and no. Father has--misunderstood some letters of mine. He found them since I came away--and he blames me-- Oh, Doro!"" and Tavia covered her face with her hands. ""How I wish I had told you before!""Tavia was sobbing bitterly. Instantly there came to Dorothy's mind the thought of Miss Brooks' warning, her advice to tell Tavia before it was too late, before all the harm was done. And had she delayed too long? Even that one day might have been sufficient time in which the threatened danger had become a certainty.""Oh, but it is! I never should have done such a thing. I knew better, and I tried to convince myself that I did not. Then I should never have taken your money. Oh, Doro, I deceived you, and I have deceived everybody!"""
"""I don't want to hear or know anything more about that--person. She is evidently trying to cover up her little mistake in putting a ring in the wrong bag. She knows absolutely nothing about me--she is merely guessing.""Tavia felt she was making bad worse; it was not a time to attempt further deception. But somehow the idea of Miss Brooks speaking to Dorothy angered her--she was the one to do that. Then followed the accusing voice of conscience:""She told me nothing,"" interrupted Dorothy, ""but that you had made some mistake in a money matter and then suggested that the way for you to rectify it would be to write to your father and tell him all about it.""""Now, Tavia,"" began Dorothy, assuming a voice at once commanding and kind, ""it is utterly useless for you to take that view of the matter. If you dislike Miss Brooks' interference, pay no attention to it. Do what you think best. Look the whole question squarely in the face, and then decide.""""One thing is certain,"" Dorothy told herself. ""Tavia must not go home. In her state of mind, and with her temper, there is no telling what she might do--leave home, or something else dreadful. If I could only see Squire Travers first,"" she argued, ""I am sure I could manage it some way.""How long she lay there she had no idea of computing--it was not now a question of time, although the night must be far advanced, but to the perplexed girl everything about her seemed to surge in one great sea of difficulties.""I wonder how Ned is?"" she thought. ""If only he is not seriously hurt. The doctor said if he slept, and no fever arose, he would do well. I wonder how I can find out. I might slip downstairs and listen.""She drew her heavy blue robe around her, put on her slippers and softly opened the door. There was no light in the upper hall, and a turn from the first flight of stairs hid the dim light below. Directly at this turn a push-button connected with an electric drop lamp, and this button Dorothy touched as she passed.At the broad window-seat she hesitated for a moment, looked out at the clear, wintry night, and then slipped down the stairs so lightly that even the cushioned velvet carpet took no impress of her footfall.Involuntarily she turned toward the vestibule. A strange sensation of some one watching her from without possessed her, terrified her, and at the same instant a light tap sounded upon the plate-glass door.Summoning all her self-control Dorothy moved toward the front door. Only the glass and a thin lace drapery separated her from without, as the storm door had been left open. Some one stood within the small entrance hall--the shadow was clearly outlined."
"""I had no idea of startling you,"" began Tom, without waiting for her to speak, ""but I have been so anxious! I've been watching the house, and when I saw the light flash upstairs I felt as if something must have happened. The doctor said by midnight--""""Oh, no, indeed,"" Tom replied in an undertone. ""I had no idea of disturbing any one. I thought just to look around the house and see if all was well. I am on my way home from the telegraph office. Aunt Margaret thought of an important message which she insisted had to go out to-night.""A glimmer of light stole under Tavia's door. Dorothy tapped lightly, but opened the door unbidden. She found her chum bent over pen and paper, but as Dorothy came in Tavia dropped the pen and looked up in surprise.""Tavia,"" began Dorothy, ""I came to coax you to stay--you must not go home to-morrow. I will telegraph your father. He was always so--kind to me. And when he hears all about it--about Ned and all--I am sure he will not be angry."" How the following day passed Dorothy did not want to remember. From the early morning, when she sent the telegram to Mr. Travers, stating that Tavia could not possibly leave, and that a letter to follow would explain, until the hour set for the charity performance, the girl was in one continuous whirl of excitement.In the excitement and emergency Tavia had marshaled all her individual forces, and proved herself worthy to be a friend and chum of Dorothy Dale. With her change of heart--her resolution to ""stick to Dorothy""--there seemed to come to her a new power, or, at least, it was a return of the power with which she had previously been accredited.The characters which Ned was to have impersonated were divided among the other young men, it being necessary of course, to ""double up"" on three or four parts. Agnes Sinclair openly deplored her loss of a partner, but the others smiled incredulously when she said she preferred to play with Ned and ""hated that big bear, Tom Scott.""Then when Roland attempted to do ""There was a Man in Our Town,"" another of Ned's parts, his efforts were so absurd and so utterly unlike what the tableau was expected to be, that it was decided to make it ""I Had a Little Husband, no Bigger than my Thumb."" Roland certainly looked diminutive enough to fit into a pint pot, and also seemed qualified to do as he might be told with the drum.No more delightful weather could have been wished for. It was clear and cold, while outside a big silvery moon threw a fairy-like illumination over the scene, and filtered in through the big windows of the drawing-room of the home of Mrs. Justin Brownlie.Dorothy laughed her light, happy laugh. After all, perhaps everything would come out right--it was such a relief to feel that Ned would soon be better. The worry about him was the very worst part of her troubles. Then, suddenly, like the recurrence of an unpleasant dream, the thought of Tom's midnight visit flashed before her mind.""Tom's the sort of fellow who dares to do right, no matter what happens. He would as soon call at midnight as midday, if the occasion warranted it. And that's saying a good deal for Tom--from me,"" she concluded."
"Nat was waiting at the door. He took particular pains to be nice to Tavia. In fact, most of the difficulties that had for some weeks been accumulating about The Cedars seemed to take wings with the occurrence of Ned's accident. The oft-quoted saying about an ""ill wind"" was once more being verified, although it was hard for Ned to be left at home.""Of course,"" replied Dorothy, smiling. ""He's getting better. But it was hard to leave him alone with his hurt--and Norah. Not that Norah is to be classed with the injuries,"" she hurried to add, laughing merrily.The girls, with their violins, were already in place. Dorothy felt some embarrassment in facing a room filled with those she considered critical spectators, for the best society of all the Birchlands, as well as cultured persons from Ferndale near by, had come to the entertainment.The Brownlie girls played the violins. Dorothy gave them the ""A"" note, and they put their instruments in tune, with that weird, fascinating combination of chords which prelude the opening strains of enthralling music. Then they began.Tavia was shaking with nervousness when the curtain was pulled together, and when, in response to an imperative demand from the audience, it was parted again, Tavia could scarcely keep from laughing outright. It was one of the difficult pictures, but the girl's talent for theatricals stood her in good stead, while, as for Roland, he seemed too lazy to make any blunders.Tom, as ""Jack Horner,"" came next. Fat! Numbers in the audience insisted that he was the original ""Roly-poly,"" but the big paper-covered pie precluded all further argument. Tom held his thumb in that pie as faithfully as ever a real, picture Jack Horner did. He had to pose for a second view, and at that the throng was not satisfied, but Nat declared that one encore was enough.She wore a light-blue skirt, with a dark bodice, and a big, soft straw hat, tossed back on her head, did not hide the beauty of her abundant locks. Her crook had fallen from her hand, and rested at the bottom of the little mound of hay. It was a delightful representation, and Dorothy seemed actually painted upon the canvas, so naturally did she sleep. Mrs. Brownlie nodded approvingly to Mrs. White. Dorothy's picture was not only pretty, but it artistically perfect.The audience seemed loath to disturb the little scene by applause, and instead of answering to an encore Dorothy was obliged to keep her Bo-Peep attitude for the length of time that it would have required to present her tableau a second time.It was a depiction of ""Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater,"" with Eva's fair head sticking out of an immense paper pumpkin shell. Nat's face, in the character of Peter, was in a most satisfactory smile, consequent, probably, upon his ability to ""keep her very well,"" and it was surely a very funny picture. Eva assumed a distressed look, and was thankful that only her face had to act, for the quarters of the pumpkin shell were rather limited.As the ""Man all Tattered and Tom,"" Tom was a veritable scarecrow, with a fringe of rags all over him, and the familiar battered hat well turned down to conceal any accidental smile that might detract from his serious pose. He was bending over Agnes in the regulation picture-lover attitude, and as the curtains were pulled together Tom did what any other young man on earth might have done--he kissed the Maiden all Forlorn."
"The incident, trifling as it was, somewhat marred the good humor of the players. Roland came near falling for a second time in his ""Jack be Nimble."" As it was, the big candlestick did topple over just as the curtain bell sounded. Then Edith Brownlie looked decidedly miserable as ""The Queen was in the Kitchen, Eating Bread and Honey."" She liked Tom Scott--everybody knew that--and now Tom, in addition to having lately favored Dorothy, had kissed Agnes! Of course, the girls, and boys too, teased the sensitive Edith, and she lost interest in her picture.Dorothy was delighted at Mary's success. The girl was her ""find,"" and it was she who had taught her how to use her voice so well in the pathetic lines. True, she found an apt pupil in Mary, and Dorothy was but too glad to accord her the entire triumph, when the recitationist bowed again in response to the hearty applause and retired.""I believe she does,"" replied Mrs. White, making a place for Dr. Baker to sit down beside her. ""My niece Dorothy is much interested in the child--she seems to have a faculty for discovering genius, has Dorothy.""""Well, I have not seen little Mary for some years, but there is no mistaking her. Her mother, an actress, died in one of the charity wards of the hospital, and I am afraid the child has inherited the fatal malady from her mother. She looks now like a consumptive.""""I suspect that your pretty niece brought this child out with the sole purpose of making her happy,"" said Dr. Baker, ""and she evidently has no idea how much real happiness she is destined to confer on her. Perhaps a month later it would have been too late to save her. Now I think we can, though there is a flush on her cheeks that I do not like.""The curtains were separated to disclose the last number. It was a tableau of all the girls and boys, posing as the ""Haymakers."" It made a beautiful picture, the girls in their gaily-colored dresses, with great, broad-brimmed hats, and the boys dressed in equally rural costumes.Dorothy was so glad that it was all over--that this was the last picture. Agnes stood next to her. The curtains were drawn, and then separated again in response to insistent applause. There was a moment more of posing, and then it was all over. Had Agnes actually struck her, Dorothy could not have been more surprised. In the excitement and confusion of the finish of the performance, there was neither the time nor the opportunity for Dorothy to resent such a remark. But after she had reached The Cedars and her quiet, little room, the words seemed to burn themselves into her mind. How dared any one to speak so to her--a mere schoolgirl, with no thoughts of love?""Why, you dear, precious baby!"" she exclaimed at length, as she placed her hand caressingly on Dorothy's head. ""Doesn't everybody know what Agnes thinks of Tom? She is old enough to have such thoughts, and her reason for inflicting them on you, my dear, is merely a consequence of you--of you doing the work that older girls usually do. I should not have allowed you to take so much responsibility, Dorothy. We know, however,"" continued Mrs. White very gently, ""that the pretty Agnes admires Mr. Scott very much. So you must excuse her seeming indiscretion."""
"Dorothy's mind was instantly relieved. If Agnes did like Tom, of course she might have thought he was neglecting her for Dorothy. And he had only been trying to help Dorothy--there were so many things to do.""Oh, dear!"" exclaimed Tavia, when the door had closed on Mrs. White and the two girls were alone in Dorothy's room, ""I'm so frightened, Doro, dear. I should have gone home. What am I going to say to my father?""""Like her? I should, say she fairly loved her, but then, you see, a sister of hers had a baby girl once,"" and Tavia laughed to cover up the mistake she had made in mentioning the affairs of Miss Brooks. ""There, Doro, dear, I'm going now. To-morrow is another day, as your aunt says,"" finished Tavia, kissing Dorothy fondly and leaving her chum to think over all the matters that now confused her tired, weary brain.The entertainment had been so engrossing that all the thoughts of Tanglewood Park and the mystery concerning it had entirely escaped Dorothy's memory for the time being. But Roger had determined to know all about that ""scream,"" and only yesterday he had had a long talk with old Abe down at the station; a long, serious talk. Abe told the little fellow that there ""sure was a ghost up at the castle,"" and when Joe, who was with Roger, asked about the lady the old liveryman had driven up there, Abe rolled up his eyes in an unpleasant fashion, and declared that the lady was a ""near-ghost"" herself.The boy tossed the missives down and ran off. Dorothy glanced over her mail. There were several letters from her school friends, as she could tell by the writing, and some from acquaintances in Dalton. Then this one--who could it be from?--postmarked in a city from which she had never received any mail, and the address written in a strange hand. ""MY DEAR MISS DALE--This letter will undoubtedly surprise you. It is a strange Christmas letter for me to have to write. You may have forgotten my name, but I am the woman detective whom you met in Boardman's. I hardly know how to pen the words, but--_I put that ring into your bag_! ""But even pity seems bitter to me now--life has all gone wrong, and only the thought of your innocent face, and the black guilt I tried to fasten on you, has given me the strength to write this letter.She hurried upstairs to read the letter again in seclusion. The positive tone of sorrow in the missive touched her heart. There certainly did seem many things to do, but here was plainly an emergency case. If she could manage to go to the city, obtain Miss Dearing's address from the store, go to see her, and then stop at Dalton on her way back--""Then came the recollection that she really knew nothing to tell Squire Travers--she really did not know what Tavia's trouble was. All the girl's conversation on that point amounted to nothing more than inferences, vague and uncertain.""Just like a girl. We couldn't possibly buy trees last week, because--they would not be hand-picked. This week why can't we buy them and--hang the handpicked,"" he finished. ""Now, do you understand, little girl, that the tree is to be in the near-infant ward in the hospital?"""
"Certainly the morning had passed--and the afternoon would no doubt be equally short. Dorothy hurried to get her warm wraps, called to Tavia, and was at the lunch-table before Nat had returned from the garage, whence he brought the Fire Bird.Tavia looked almost happy. Somehow, since she determined to ""stick to Dorothy,"" much of her apparent trouble seemed to have disappeared. She was brighter than she had been for days, and even Nat threw off the restraint he had shown toward her lately. At The Elms they picked up Tom, with Roland's regrets, and with a dangerous-looking hatchet in hand--to bag the game with.""And buggies ride bugs,"" put in Nat, shifting the lever for more speed. ""Well, it's up to us to get there first, and then we may shoot up the whole woods if we like. The girls may--may sit under a shady tree.""The deep gloom of an approaching storm made this proposal sound quite ridiculous, and Dorothy declared she would prefer sitting in the Fire Bird at a safe distance from the shooting. Tavia threatened to crawl under the seat, and even vowed she would leave the car at once if the hatchet and revolver were not at once put away--""out of her sight!""Talk of the play, and of Ned's condition, occupied much of the remaining time consumed in the run to the woods, and when the tall chestnut trees of Tanglewood Park finally faced the strip of road the Fire Bird was covering, snowflakes were beginning to fall. And so fiercely did the winds blow, that presently Nat had all he could do to manage the machine.""Of scaring,"" interrupted Tom, laughing. ""Well, there is no immediate cause for alarm in either direction,"" he went on, ""but I think it will be a good idea to get out of this gale as quickly as possible.""It surely was a gale now, and the wind seemed so solidified with the biting specks of snow, that Dorothy and Tavia were quite satisfied to bury their frost-bitten faces deep in the fur of muffs and scarfs, while the young men turned up their overcoat collars and turned down the flaps of the heavy auto caps, none too heavy, however, to keep out the discomforts of the newly arrived blizzard.Straight for the drive to the castle Nat directed the machine, and by the time the old broken-down steps of the once spacious porch were reached, even Tavia was glad to jump out of the Fire Bird and get her breath in a secluded part of the old balcony.""Well, we can't try it now, at any rate,"" replied Tom. ""What do you say to exploring?"" and he went to the great, old oak door. ""Open! Well, that's luck,"" and as he spoke he pushed back the portal, although it seemed about to fall, rather than swing on the rusty hinges.The girls waited almost breathless--there was something so uncanny about the place. But presently boyish shouts and merry calls from within assured them that no trouble had been encountered, and it was Dorothy who proposed that they follow and seek refuge from the winds, that found the girls' ears and noses, in spite of the shelter of the old porch and the protection of furs and wraps.The young men were racing about from room to room, but the girls were not so keen on investigating. Dorothy did walk through the great long parlors and admire the handsome Italian marble mantels, and the library with inlaid floor was also explored, but Tavia kept as near as possible to the front door--ready to run, she explained.""Why, there's nothing to be afraid of,"" said Dorothy, now quite at ease. ""The boys are in the very top of the house, over in the tower, and I am sure if there was anything to fear, they would have discovered it by this time.""""Oh, come up and see the gallery room,"" called Nat from the top of the stair-well. ""If we don't bring the boys out here and have some doings! This is the swellest kind of a place. Come on up, girls. Nary a ghost nor a ghostie in the diggings."""
"He slid down the baluster rail in spite of Dorothy's protest, for the floor below was of mosaics, and the rail might not be safe. But Tom landed without accident, and presently was looking for a passageway to the cellar.""Things down there!"" he said. ""I could even smell them, and they did not seem musty, either. Besides, look at everything. Nothing cut up or damaged, like an old, deserted place. Some one may hang out here.""Nat put his hand on the pocket, from which his diminutive revolver could be seen to be outlined, and when the front door was opened a gust of wind and snow forced him, as well as Tom, back into shelter.""Suppose we run the machine into the shed and start off to walk?"" suggested Nat, now rather uncomfortable because of Tom's hint about the cellar. ""It will be better for the girls, at any rate. There's a farmhouse at the turn into Glendale.""It did not take long for the party to follow out this proposal, and in spite of the wind and snow the four young people started bravely off, Nat supporting Dorothy, while Tom put his strong arm about the uncertain Tavia--uncertain because she not only slipped continually, but threatened to do so in between the actual occurrences.No sooner had he uttered the words than he slipped, Dorothy fell with him, Tom and Tavia tumbled, full drive, after them, and all were plunged into a hole deep enough to terrify the girls and even to alarm the boys.Nat hurried to the Fire Bird, and was not disappointed in his quest, for he brought back to the waiting ones a bundle of such food as the thoughtful Norah made a practice of slipping into the car when the young folks went for a long run.Nat brought the machine lamps and placed one on either corner of the broad, low mantel in the dining-room. It was not difficult to know this room from the others, for frescoed mottoes, still clear enough to be made out, invited all strangers, as well as those who roofed therein, to ""eat, drink and be merry,"" and otherwise.The joke brought forth a very feeble laugh, but even that was better than the groans Tavia had been indulging in. Perhaps an hour passed while our friends were trying to ""make the best of it,"" and then, after putting by the remnants of the lunch for future use, the boys fairly exhausted themselves doing ""stunts"" calculated to amuse the girls and make them forget the terrors around them.""Now, I'll just tell you,"" declared Nat. ""There's a sort of couch under each of those posts in the parlor. Tavia take one and Dorothy the other, Tom and I will stand guard. You may as well rest, even if you cannot sleep, for even in the morning it's going to be heavy traveling.""At first the girls declared they, too, would stand guard, but when Tom added his reasoning to that of Nat's and the tired ones realised that if they had to walk through the snow in the morning they surely would have to rest their weary muscles, they finally consented to ""stretch out"" on the low seat that marked the archway from parlor to parlor. It did seem absurd, in spite of the fact that they were snowbound in a ""haunted house."" The big automobile lamps glared brilliantly from the mantel, and Tom, with Nat, found another place to rest--on the long, low bench that formed a really artistic seat at the foot of the broad stairway.""Many a gay fellow has rested here, between the dances, don't you think?"" asked Nat. ""I fancy I hear the other fellow and his girl coming down the stairs at this moment."" He threw himself back in a mocking attitude, while Tom bowed to the ""girl coming down the stairs."""
"Dorothy was dreaming that the men in the boats on the Italian marble mantel were coming to rescue her. Tavia had a weakness for brilliant nightmares, and she dreamed that the crystal chandeliers were coming--coming down, to strike her directly in the face.""Oh, the foolish fellow,"" replied the major. ""I had the greatest time to get him here, once he found out I was coming to the castle. He vowed he saw lights, and heard screams. He's the fellow who drove the woman out here--Abe, you know.""""That scream came from a human being,"" spoke the major finally. ""We must investigate at once. Here, Abe, you take this lamp."" Trembling as if he had the ague, the old colored man took the lamp from the mantel. ""Tom, you have an ax. Nat, your gun may be handy. Now, girls, don't be alarmed. We are too many for any one here. Just sit there in that corner while we look about.""At a glance it was plain he was in hiding in the wretched place, and the surroundings showed he had food and some of life's necessities within reach, although the very rats, whose presence were painfully evident, must have enjoyed a keener advantage in the mansion, once proud of the name ""Mayberry.""Assured that the specter was a man and nothing more nor less, Tom had hurried back to reassure the girls. Nat turned his attention to old Abe, and, between scolding and explaining, finally succeeded in quieting the colored man's fears. But the major kept close to the lunatic--for such he took Captain Mayberry to be.""And don't you remember me?"" he kept asking, satisfied that a gleam of recognition did pass over the wrinkled face that now peered out into the glare of the lamp from the Fire Bird. ""Come! We are hungry, and you are too, I'll wager. Let's have mess. Rations are plenty to-night.""""Not a bit of it. Here, sit down on this seat,"" and Major Dale motioned to Tom. ""This young man will stay by you to keep you company while we prepare the mess. Perhaps you will show us how to get water? And have you any way of lighting up?"""
"Into the latter vehicle Captain Mayberry was almost lifted, wrapped in every conceivable sort of warm covering that could be found in his strange quarters. A heavy, and formerly handsome fur coat, besides thick, woolly scarfs and great old army boots had been dug out from queer hiding places, and these were heaped and piled upon the captain until scarcely the outline of his pinched face was left to the danger of the winter morning.On either side of Captain Mayberry sat Major Dale and Tom Scott, while old Abe was directed to drive this party to the railroad station, as it had been decided that the sick or insane man should at once be taken to the hospital for treatment.""To think,"" whispered Dorothy to Tavia as they started off, ""that our hospital play should have enabled us to send the poor old man directly to the Institution. We never dreamed who would be our first patient.""""Oh, indeed he is too weak to be violent,"" responded Dorothy. ""And I rather think he will enjoy the ride. He said he made it a habit to go out every day, just about nightfall. He had sense enough to know he must have fresh air or die.""Tired from the night's vigil, the occupants of the Fire Bird soon wearied of conversation, and the drive behind the stage coach was made in silence, save for the creaking of the snow on the frosty roads, and the occasional sounds of an early morning team bound for the town along the old turnpike.At the Four Corners the Fire Bird cut ahead of the coach, and with a merry call to the captain, the major, Tom and even to old Abe, the occupants of the car soon left behind them the carry-all, as well as the road to Tanglewood Park.Arriving at The Cedars, in spite of all protests, Dorothy and Tavia were ""put to bed,"" while Norah brought from the kitchen great bowls of beef tea, declaring each young lady should drink at least a quart, ""to save them from nemonie,"" and that the hot foot baths they had would be repeated unless the girls were soon sound asleep.But that afternoon, when Major Dale was expected to return from his trip to the hospital, and Dorothy and Tavia were sufficiently rested to be down at the station waiting to meet them, the appearance of Miss Brooks brought Tavia suddenly back to the realization of her own predicament.The little woman ran into the station just in time to obtain her ticket for a late city train, and had not a moment to spare, so that there was no opportunity of either Dorothy or Tavia exchanging a word with her.""Tavia!"" exclaimed Dorothy, her voice ringing with indignation. ""You must never again speak that way of Miss Brooks. We did wrong to suspect her for a moment. She had absolutely nothing to do with the ring.""""Well, you really must not ask, because, Tavia, dear, I know the person was terribly pressed, somehow, and it does not seem right for me to spread the story of her misfortune. I haven't even told Aunt Winnie.""""There's the surrey,"" announced Dorothy, as Nat drove up. ""We walked down, it was so delightful in the snow. But Aunt Winnie insisted we should not take out the big sleigh. She says the horses are always so skittish when first put to the cutter, and she was afraid of some other accident.""And it may as well be told now that when Agnes Sinclair and Tom Scott stopped at the post-office that very evening Tom posted a number of little notes for Agnes--an informal tea was to be given at Ferndale.""I have been wondering why Mrs. Sinclair had not called to see Ned,"" commented Mrs. White when Dorothy handed her the cards. ""This explains it, of course. Dorothy, what did I tell you? See how well trained my eyes are."""
"""Just to throw you off the scent, of course,"" finished Mrs. White. ""Well, I am glad we are going to have an engagement for the holidays. It will make a little round of gaieties for the young folks. Dorothy, you may give Agnes her first shower.""Ned was recovering rapidly, and he too joined in suggesting plans for the ""handing around of Agnes."" He insisted it was up to him and Nat to give Tom a sendoff, and finally did obtain Mrs. White's permission to give a bachelor dinner in the coach house. They wanted the affair given where there would be no objection to either noise or ""muss,"" as Nat put it, so the coach house was decided upon.""Plans, plans, nothing but plans,"" sang Tavia. ""I wish some one would make plans for me. I would like to elope this very evening. I am not particular about having a partner in the going away; a railroad ticket would answer.""""Angry? More likely to be scared to death. I could not believe the old stage driver that you had really brought him to a hospital. Well, I must be going."" She was almost at the door. ""Don't mention my name to him, if you please.""""You are Miss Pumfret, I know,"" she began, without waiting for her father's introduction. ""Isn't it perfectly splendid?--the news from Captain Mayberry, I mean. He seemed as pleased as a child when I promised him a merry Christmas, and to-morrow morning I am going into the hospital to make sure he gets it. Won't you come with me? He will be delighted to see you, I am sure.""Little Miss Pumfret glared at Dorothy. Then she stepped back and sank down on the hall seat. ""Well,"" she exclaimed finally, ""I'm an old-fashioned woman. Never was used to youngsters' interference, but I like your cheek (this was said with evident sincerity and no idea of being frivolous). I've just a good mind--""Yes, it was late, but Dorothy still had Tavia to console--if only she could insist upon Tavia spending Christmas at The Cedars--Dorothy had unlimited faith in the magic of the day before Christmas. Nat called to her as she started up to Tavia's room.""Thanks!"" she spoke up, all the tears evidently gone. ""But if it's all the same to both of you, I would prefer that you keep your pretty saying for Christmas. I'm just dead tired, and fully expect to be asleep in exactly ten minutes."""
"""Good-night,"" added Dorothy, ""and don't forget you are to attend to everything to-morrow while I am in the city. See what it is to be on a charity committee! I'll have to have a substitute help with all the most important things--there's heaps to be done yet.""""To bed! To bed, every one!"" called Mrs. White, and then both troubles and pleasant anticipations for a happy ending to the queer holiday became hopelessly tangled in the dreams of the young folks at The Cedars.""Take care that Tavia does not worry,"" Dorothy cautioned the young man. ""I know she has a trouble, and I am sure somehow it will be all adjusted by to-night. I depend upon the witches of Christmas Eve.""The next moment Dorothy drew back to allow brother and sister their own happy moment--Jane Pumfret had the old white-haired man in her arms, was embracing him like a child, and the nurse smiled in complete satisfaction as she, too, stepped aside with Dorothy.Down the broad marble steps, that seemed to exude everything antiseptic and sterilized, Dorothy hurried along after the head nurse. Into a large hall, then across this into a small waiting-room they passed.""Oh, here you are!"" exclaimed the little woman pleasantly. ""I was just telling Nick what a girl you are. Perhaps you can tell us how to go about getting him into the private ward. He liked it first-rate here,"" she hurried to explain, ""but there's no sense in keeping this bed from some one who may need it.""""That will do nicely,"" answered the nurse, smiling. ""Your friend has been taken into the observation ward. She will remain there until her case is diagnosed. It was providential that you spoke when you did, or she might have fainted in the street if we had turned her away, and we are not allowed to take patients who apply as she did, unless they are vouched for. You see, it was well you happened to know her."" ""No, I'm not a bit excited,"" pleaded Miss Dearing when the nurse cautioned her to keep quiet. ""I'm only happy. I was dying long before I came here, and now I can rest in a bed, and perhaps I will have the courage to get well again.""""No, but you have brought it. When I look at your fair face-- Don't you know, that was why I put the ring in your bag?"" she asked suddenly. ""I knew your face would clear you before any accuser in the world.""""And from that moment some evil genius followed me. I did it because other detectives had been praised for making arrests, and I had made none. I could not afford to lose my place, for my mother--was dying. She died, thank God, before she knew her daughter had lied for her, had herself actually been accused of stealing--stealing to earn a dollar!"""
"It was actually noon-time, and Dorothy had to hurry back to The Cedars. Miss Pumfret and the captain were still talking about old family affairs, and seemed supremely happy as she left them. The captain, explained the nurse, was suffering more from neglect than any specific ailment, and he had already responded remarkably to treatment.""She is not very strong, and I am going to take her south at once,"" went on Miss Brooks, while Mary fairly beamed with delight. She was so splendid in her new fur coat; and to think she really had a relative!""And there is something else,"" said Miss Brooks, ""The matter--about Miss Travers. I received a letter this morning from the firm, refunding her money. Of course, I had urged them to do so. I would not even address envelopes for a house that would deliberately rob young girls.""""I agree with you,"" answered Miss Brooks, ""but you did not go into it with that understanding. Neither did I offer to address their envelopes with a thorough understanding of their methods. I simply was trying to find an address, and I made use of every means I considered legitimate. Here is your money--and your friend's. The address I was looking for came in person,"" and once more she folded her arms about Mary.""The money!"" exclaimed Tavia, looking at the check in a dazed sort of way, ""This is your money, Dorothy,"" she said, reading the check--""yours and Nat's. I gambled mother's, and spent yours, then I bought Christmas presents.""""Borrowed from me? Why, I gave you that--outright. It was my Christmas in advance. Just jump into your things, and come down to send a telegram home. Send them five dollars by wire--they will get it in the morning. There is no present like the one that comes on Christmas morning, you know.""""Dorothy!"" exclaimed Tavia, ""I can't oppose you this time. I know that five dollars will make my father and my mother know that I--but it would be deceiving them,"" she broke off. ""I am not fit to even send the gift.""Dorothy did get peace, and great happiness, too. Yet there were many happenings still in store for her, and what some of them were will be told in another book, to be called ""Dorothy Dale's Camping Days."" It was a never-to-be-forgotten outing and one that produced some astonishing results."
