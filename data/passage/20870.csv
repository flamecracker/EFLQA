passage
"Bess, Belle and Cora were holding this whispered conversation. It was Belle, the timid, who wanted to cry, and it was Cora who had really seen the man--got the good look. Bess did say she wished the boys were around, but Bess had great confidence in those boys, and this remark, when a man was actually sneaking around Clover Cottage, was perfectly pardonable.The motor girls had just returned from a delightful afternoon ride along the shore road at Lookout Beach. Bess and Belle Robinson, otherwise Elizabeth and Isabel, the twins, were in their little car--the _Flyaway_--and Cora Kimball was driving her fine, four-cylinder touring affair, both machines having just pulled up in front of Clover Cottage, the summer home of the Robinsons.""Yes, they had to drop some mail in the box. We won't attempt to go in until they come. At any rate, I have a little something to do to the _Whirlwind_,"" and Cora pulled off her gloves, and started to get a wrench out of the tool box.They all took seats upon the broad piazza, after the boys, by a casual look, were satisfied that no intruder was about the grounds. Belle kept close to Ed--he was the largest of the young men--but Cora and Bess showed no signs of fear.""No joking,"" went on Cora, ""when we came up the road we did see a fellow sneaking around the cottage. I'm not exactly afraid, ahem! but I may as well admit that I am glad you boys appeared just now, and I hope the interloper caught a glimpse, ahem! of your manly forms.""The three boys jumped up as if some one had touched a spring. Ed was taller, Walter was stouter and Jack was--well, he was quicker. Bess noticed that, and did not hesitate to say so in making her special report of the trio.The incident merely furnished sport for the boys. A burglar hunt was no uncommon thing at Clover Cottage, and this one was no more promising that had been a dozen others. Belle did not venture in with the searching party. She had her fears, as usual. Cora by reputation was not timid, and she had that reputation to maintain just now. As a matter of fact, she knew perfectly well that the man who took the trouble to crawl around the house had some sinister motive in doing so. Bess had not really seen him do it, so when she went in, along with the boys, she had scarcely any fear of running down either a sneak thief or a tramp, both varieties of undesirable citizens being common enough at the watering place.It did not strike Cora Kimball just then that she had a particular part to play in the impending drama which was to involve herself and her friends. In the first volume of the series, entitled ""The Motor Girls,"" Cora found it her duty to unravel the mystery of the road, when a wallet, empty, but which should have contained a small fortune in bonds, was actually found in the tool box of her own car. Then in the next volume, ""The Motor Girls on a Tour,"" Cora again had the lines of the leading lady, for it fell to her lot to ""keep the promise"" that restored little Wren, the cripple, to her own, both in money and in health. In the third book of the series, ""The Motor Girls at Lookout Beach,"" it was Cora again who had to unearth the mystery, and now----""Oh, mad at us! Cora Kimball!"" and her brother threatened to injure his beauty on the matting rug. ""If I had only the least idea that you didn't like us, I would have packed the whole crowd off to the bungalow."""
"""Quit!"" shouted Walter. ""I have it on good authority that when a girl's brother is along, and when there are twins in the same party, and when there are two fellows, near twins, in aforesaid same party, that makes a cross-finger combination on the chaperon. She doesn't have to come along.""Walter was looking his very best, which was always good, for the brown boy was now browner than ever, with the tan of beach sand and sun. Bess wore a most becoming linen gown, with just a rim of embroidered pink around her plump neck, and she, too, looked charming. Then Belle--Belle always wore dainty things, she was so perfectly blonde and so bisquelike. Her gown was of the simplest silvery stuff that Jack described as cloudy. Cora, after her auto trip of the afternoon, had ""freshed up"" in dazzling white. She loved contrast, and invariably, after driving, would don something directly opposite to that required for motoring. Her dark hair looked blacker than usual against the fleecy white, and her face was strictly handsome. Cora Kimball had grown from pretty to handsome just as naturally as a bud unfolds into a flower, with the attending dignity.""I don't see why we shouldn't go,"" replied Cora, ""especially as the boys cannot have the launch for another evening. But I suppose that would mean a second change of dress,"" with a look at the flimsy costumes about her.""It is--on the catalogue. But after a day's sun like to-day we just put our ham and eggs on the corrugated iron roof, and they are done to a turn in the morning, with nice little ridge patterns on them.""Nor were the wraps lacking in beauty or usefulness. Cora had a family shawl--the kind that defies description outside of the French-English fashion papers. It was of the Paisley order, and did not seem to be cut any place; at the same time it fell in folds about her arms and neck with some invisible fastenings. Her hood was made from a piece of the same wonderfully embroidered stuff--a big red star, with the points drawn in. Bess and Belle both wore pretty cloaks of eiderdown. Bess was in pink and Belle in blue.""Yes, I like it,"" admitted Cora. ""As long as you are bent on a romantic evening, we may as well have the little love song,"" and she slipped the strap of her guitar case over her arm as they started off.It was delightful on the water. The smaller bay opened into another and provided safe motor boating. The tide was slowly receding, and as the party glided along, little moonlight-tipped waves seemed to caress the launch. Jack and Cora were playing, Bess and Belle were humming, while Walter was ""breathing sounds"" that could scarcely be classified, and Ed was content to run the motor.But this time even skillful handling of oars would not move the launch. Ed ran the motor at full speed ahead and reversed, but the boat remained on the bar, which now, as the tide rapidly lowered, could be plainly seen in the moonlight."
"""Hard to say,"" replied Ed, in rather a mournful tone. ""If we had gone down the bay, we would not have been alone, but I thought this upper end so much more attractive to-night. However, we need not despair. We can wait for the tide.""""Easy there! No need for artificial respiration or barrel-rolling just yet,"" declared Jack. ""In fact, if we had a bit of water, we'd be thankful. Let me work the engine, Ed. Maybe I can give luck a turn and get more push out of it.""""No, 'Love's Luxury,'"" asserted Walter, as he made a comical move toward Belle. But Belle was disconsolate, and she only looked at the moon. It was almost funny, but the humor was entirely lost on the frightened girl.Jack tried to persuade his friend not to take the risk, but Walter was determined; so, unobservedly divesting himself of his heaviest garments, he dropped over the side of the launch and was soon stroking for the shore.""Girls, do you imagine we would sit here calmly and try to quiet you if there was anything actually wrong?"" asked Cora. ""Why don't you give the boys credit, once in a while, for having a little common sense?""""Something always does happen when it is expected,"" Cora told her, ""but let us hope it will be nothing worse than what we already are conscious of. It was splendid of Walter to go, and I am sure he will return safely.""Then quiet settled upon the party. It was, indeed, a gloomy prospect. Stranded--Walter swimming in the bay--and nothing but sky above and water beyond them, just far enough away to be out of the reach of the launch.""There he goes! It's a porpoise!"" cried Jack. ""No danger of one of those hog-fish going near a man. They're as timid as mice. Just see him go! There ought to be a lot of others, for they generally go in schools. Maybe this one was kept in because he couldn't spell 'book,' and is just getting home.""Cora breathed a sigh of relief at Jack's joking tone. She didn't care to see the big fish swim--she was only too glad that he was going, and that he was of the harmless species described by Jack. The others watched the porpoise as he made his way out to the open sea."
"The relief from anxiety put the girls in better spirits. Bess and Belle wondered if Nettie had returned, and speculated whether, on finding them gone, she might have notified the police. Cora was thinking about what sort of lifeboat Walter would return with, while Ed and Jack were content to look and listen.The merry voices that could now be heard were reassuring indeed. Nearer and nearer they came, until the girls actually became interested to the extent of arranging side combs and otherwise attending to little niceties, dear to the heart of all girls.When their launch pulled up to the dock that night, an anxious party greeted them. Nettie had returned from the city, and upon finding the cottage deserted had waited a reasonable length of time before consulting the neighbors. Then she found that the young folks had gone sailing.Of course, she learned that such a party had gone out, but in what direction no one along the beach front seemed to know. The upper bay course was the last thing thought of, and, when Nettie did succeed in hiring a fisherman to set out and search, he went down the cove opposite to the course taken by Ed in his motor boat.In half an hour the fisherman returned, and, as luck would have it, he brought with him Walter's cap, which had fallen overboard as the youth started out from the stalled motor boat, and so drifted in the other direction.In the rapid time that bad news always flies, the report became circulated that a sailing party was lost. Hazel and Paul Hastings, two friends of the motor girls, heard the report at their cottage, and hurried down to the little wharf, where they found Nettie in the deepest distress.Just as Paul was about to set out himself, the launch chugged in, with the party laughing and singing, Cora playing that same tune, and with our friends was the little lady from the bungalow, she who had rescued Walter, and who went with him to the succor of the stranded ones on the sand bar.Miss Robbins, it developed, was a young doctor, stopping up the river in a bungalow with her mother. Her boat was towed by the launch when they came in, and, although she wanted to row back, the others would not listen to such a proposition.""It won't take half an hour to get to the garage and bring my car right down here,"" insisted Walter, ""unless you prefer walking up to the cottage with the young ladies, and I can run over there for you. I will have you back in your bungalow in ten minutes more.""""That's a lot more,"" said Cora, with a laugh. ""I like her, too. It seems to me almost providential. We are going to the Berkshires, she wants to go, we can't get a mother to take us, so a young doctor ought to be the----""Bess and Belle would then be alone with Ed. Of course, Nettie was about, and they might sit on the porch until the others returned. Jack jumped in with Walter, while Cora and Miss Robbins took the second seat. The car was not Walter's runabout, but a larger machine from the garage.Walter felt this was the very kind of a girl he had dreamed of. She might not be pretty, but when she tossed the bath robe out to him as he was virtually washed up at her door, tossed it out while she ran to get her own wraps to join him in the rescue, he felt instantly that this girl was a ""find."" Then, when she spoke of going to the Berkshires, he was further convinced, and now, when she told of building a bungalow--what an acquisition such a woman would be!""Well we never have been afraid,"" replied Miss Robbins, ""as I am pretty good with a revolver, but there seems to be some tramps around here lately. One visited us this morning before breakfast, and mother remarked he was not at all a pleasant sort of customer."""
"""They did, but he was beyond chase when they arrived. That's the one thing uncertain about boys--their presence when one wants them,"" and Cora stepped out of the machine to allow Miss Robbins room to pass.""Oh!"" said Cora simply. But she did not add that this description tallied somewhat with that of the man she had seen about Clover Cottage. She particularly saw the boots, but many clammers wear them that way.Cora crept out of bed and left Belle trembling there. She only advanced a few steps when the sounds in the hall again startled her. The stairs certainly creaked. There was no cat, no dog. Some one was walking on those steps.Cora realized that discretion was the better part of valor. It would be foolhardy to run out in the hall, even with the cocked revolver in her hand. If she could only touch the button of the electric hall light! She stepped out cautiously. Something seemed very near, yet, at that moment, there was no sound, just that feeling of some one near.In all this time she could not give a word to the three frightened girls who were screaming and shouting for help. Nettie had run down from the third floor, Belle was threatening to die, and Bess was doing her best to make the boys down at the bungalow hear her cries.""No, indeed, but I guess I hurt him a little. He limped off rather unsteadily. I had no idea of hitting him, but just as I fired toward the window he darted into it. I could not help it. He should have surrendered.""""Couldn't have, when he was able to get away,"" declared Nettie. ""But I just wish you had! The idea of a mean man sneaking around here! Likely he's taken the silver. I didn't bring it up last night!""""Well, that was not your fault, Nettie,"" Bess said. ""We had so much excitement last night you are not responsible. Besides, you wanted to go down for it, and I said not to bother. But I hope he didn't take grandma's spoons."""
"""Again I'll agree, if it makes you feel better,"" replied Cora. ""But, you see, mother has been away so much, and Jack is always at college, so that I am rather educated in this sort of thing,"" and as she glanced at her watch on the dresser the other girls could not help admiring her prudent courage.""Strange, the neighbors did not hear the shots,"" the maid said. ""But it is just as well. We might have had to entertain people more troublesome than burglars. I'm going down stairs. I must look about the spoons. Mrs. Robinson will be so angry----""The fact that she had been intrusted with the care of the table silver, during the absence of Mrs. Robinson, gave the girl grave anxiety, and, although Bess was willing to say it was partly her fault that the silver had not been brought upstairs that night, Nettie felt none the less guilty.""We have got to make a quiet search first,"" said Jack, after hearing the story. ""No use putting the officers on until we get a look over the neighborhood. From Cora's version of the affair he could not have gone very far.""""Don't let that worry you,"" encouraged Ed. ""I rather guess his legs are used to balls and bullets. But here come the fellows. So long, girls,"" as he started off to meet Walter and Jack. ""If we don't get the spoons we will get something.""Nettie was already searching and beating the ground from under the hall window out into the field, and then into the street. She had found one spoon, and she had also found a spot that showed where some one had lately been lying in the tall grass.""I had to! Think of three helpless girls--and a desperate man. Why, if I showed fright, I am sure we might have all been chloroformed or something. Why, what's this? I declare! a chloroform bottle! There! And it's from the town drug store! Well, now, wasn't it lucky I had the revolver?"" She picked up a small phial.Meanwhile, Ed, Jack and Walter had done considerable searching. They followed what they took to be a trail, down over the railroad tracks, through swamps, and they finally brought up at an abandoned gypsy camp!"
"The remains of food and of a campfire showed that his surmise was correct, and Jack made bold enough to pull down an old horse blanket that hung to the ground from the low limbs of a tree. ""Hello! Who are you?"" exclaimed Jack, for back of the improvised curtain lay a man asleep!Ed and Walter had his arms secure before he had a chance to sit upright. Jack whipped out a strap, and while the fellow vigorously protested and exerted a desperate effort to free himself, the young men made him their prisoner.Jack had gone. The officer, after hearing the story, decided to ask Cora to go to the swamp to identify the man. With this intention the two stopped at the cottage, and Cora promised to hurry along after them down to the abandoned camp.This was agreed upon, and when Jack and the Constable had gone toward the camp, Cora, without telling Bess or Belle, who did not happen to see the man with Jack, slipped into a linen outing suit and started for the country police station.The road led cross-cut through a lot. There were trees in the very heart of this big meadow, and when Cora reached a clump of birches she was suddenly startled to see an old woman shuffling after her. Cora stopped instantly. It was broad daylight, so she had no thought of fear.Cora was pale and frightened. Jack and Ed had already reached the office of the country squire, where that official had taken the sulky prisoner. Walter went back to the cottage to assure the young girls there that everything would ultimately be all right.From under dark, shaggy eyebrows the man stared at Cora. He seemed to know of the gypsy woman's threat, and was adding to it all the savagery that looks and scowls could impart. But Cora was not to be thus intimidated--to give in to such lawbreakers.""The next time I saw the person, whom I take to be this man, was last night, about midnight. I was aroused from sleep, and upon making a light in the hall I saw a man under the window. The next moment he jumped out, and again I saw the figure under the window.""""Certainly, certainly,"" agreed the squire politely. ""I am much obliged for her testimony. I guess we will hold Tony for the grand jury. Gypsies in this county have to be careful, or they lose their rights to come in here. I think, myself, we would be better off without them.""Officer Cummings was a big man and accustomed to handling prisoners as rough and as ugly as this one. The two steel cells back of the fire house were often occupied by rough fishermen and clammers who forgot the law at the seaside place, and it was always Tom Cummings who put them in ""the pen."""
"As he passed down the stone steps he brushed past Cora. Whether intentionally or otherwise, the man shoved the girl so that she was obliged to jump down at the side of the step. Jack saw it and so did Ed, but big Tom winked at them and merely hurried the prisoner along. Cora only smiled. Why should the man not be rude when her evidence had accused him of a serious crime--that of breaking and entering?""She took the eleven o'clock train,"" said Cora. ""I saw her going to the station as I came up the street. Oh, I wouldn't bother with the poor old woman. This man is her brother, and naturally she wants to keep him out of trouble.""""Dear me! I did think something else would happen to prevent us from getting off,"" said Bess, as she and Belle, with Cora, actually started out to get the autos ready for the tour to the Berkshires. ""And to think that Miss Robbins can go with us!""""I just feel that we are going to have the jolliest of good times,"" remarked Bess, as they started down the road. ""I never care what route we take. Isn't it fine that the boys attended to all that arrest and police business for us?""""Very fine,"" agreed Cora, ""but I like to have my say now about our plans. We are going to take the main road along the New York side. We will touch Bridgeport and Waterbury. You might like to know that much.""Mrs. Robinson had taken a notion that her twins were outgrowing their twinship, consequently their outfits for the mountain trip had been made exactly alike in material and effect. The result was, the boys purposely mixed the girls up, asking Belle what made her so thin, for instance, when they knew perfectly well that she was always thin, and that it was Bess who had to own to being stout.The twins' costumes were of hunter-green corduroy, with knitted green caps. Cora wore mole-color cloth, with a toque to match, and as they now stood before the garage, waiting the coming of the others, who had stopped at the post office, many admiring eyes turned in their direction.Miss Robbins was to travel in Cora's car, with Cora and Hazel Hastings. The boys had tried to alter this plan, they declaring one boy, at least, should go in the big car, but Cora argued that the _Whirlwind_ was distinctly a girl's auto, and only girls should travel in it. This put Jack in his own runabout and Walter and Ed in the _Comet_. The Robinson girls, of course, were not to be separated, as the _Flyaway_ seemed to know all about the twins, and the twins knew all about the _Flyaway_.The weather was uncertain, and the fog horn at the point lighthouse had blown all night, so that the girls were naturally apprehensive. Only Cora's car was canopied, so that should it rain they would be obliged to stop and wait for clear weather.Nevertheless it was a very jolly party that now waited at the garage for the machines to be run out. The boys went inside and attended to the very last of the preparations, while Cora, too, insisted upon looking over her machine before starting off."
"Cora had thrown in the third speed, and was now bending over her wheel in real man fashion. They were getting out on the country roads, where all expected to make good time. Bess also threw on her full speed, following Cora's lead, and the boys, of course, gave the speeding signal on their horns.""That is where good friends come in,"" said Miss Robbins. ""This trip is a perfect delight to me. And, really, it will fix me up wonderfully for what I have to undertake this fall. You see, we have just closed the bungalow, mother has gone home, and that left me free to go to the Berkshires and have a little pleasure, together with attending to some business. I have a very old patient there. I have to call on her before she leaves the hills.""A woman sat in the back of one of the vehicles. She poked her head out and glared at the approaching machines. Then she was seen to wave a red handkerchief so that the persons in the next wagon could distinctly see it.Belle was thoroughly frightened. Hazel did not know what to make of the occurrence, but to Cora and to Bess, who had so lately learned something of queer gypsy ways, the matter looked more serious, now that there was time to think of it.They had just partaken of a very agreeable lunch by the roadside, all arranged and prepared by the boys, with endless burned potatoes down on the menu as ""fresh roasted,"" when the lowering clouds gave Dame Nature's warning. Next the thunder roared about what it might do, and then our friends hurried away from the scene. The run brought them some way on the direct road to the Berkshires, and in one of those spots where it would seem the ark must have tipped, and dropped a human being or two, the young people found a small country community.""No more traveling to-day,"" remarked Cora, as, after a wait of two hours, she ventured to observe the future possible weather. ""It looks as if it would rain all there was above, and then start in to scoop up some from the ocean. Did you ever see such clouds?""Miss Robbins found in the hotel a sick baby to take up her time, and she inveigled Bess into helping her, while the wornout and worried mother took some rest. The little one, a darling girl of four years, had taken cold, and had the most troublesome of troubles--an earache--so that she cried constantly, until Miss Robbins eased the pain.But Walter had some claim on medical attendance, for when the storm was seen to be coming up he had eaten more stuff from the lunch basket than just one Walter could comfortably store away, and the headache that followed was not mere pretense.So the rainy afternoon at Restover Hotel was not idle in incident. It was almost tea time when Cora had a chance to speak with her brother privately. She beckoned him to a corner of the porch where the rain could not find them; neither could any of their friends.""That's just what I would like to find out,"" replied the sister. ""It seems to me they would hardly have stopped a couple of girls to ask road directions or anything like that, when so many wagons, easier to halt than automobiles, had also passed by them.""""She must have been a beaut. I should like to have met her witchship. But, Cora dear, don't worry. We boys are not going to run away again, and if we see the gypsies we will see them first and last."""
"""But there are bands of them all over the hills, and I have always heard that they have some weird way of notifying each band of any important news in the colony. Now, you see, Jack, the arrest of that man would be very important to them. They are as loyal to each other as the royalty.""""React! That's the trouble. What we do with nerve we must repeat without nerve. Now, what do you think of your brother as a public lecturer?"" and Jack laughed at his own attempt to explain the reaction that Cora really felt.Every one was looking for some one. In the excitement the guests at the hotel were rushing about shouting for friends and relatives, while smoke, black and heavy, poured up the stairs from the basement.Jack, Ed and Walter were among the first to get out and use the fire extinguishers. There were plenty of these about the hotel, but on account of the injury to the men who were working in the kitchen at the time of the explosion, and owing to the fact that all the guests in the hotel just then were girls and women, the men having gone to the city, there really were not enough persons to cope with the flames that followed the lightning.""Quick!"" shouted Cora, ""we can get the buckets. Bess take that one,"" pointing to the pail that hung on the wall, and which was filled with water. ""Belle, run around and find another! Regina is with the injured men, so we cannot have her, but there is a girl! Won't you please get a bucket from the hall?"" this to a very much frightened young lady. ""The fire extinguishers seem to be all emptied, and the men are beating back the flames from the stairway.""In a remarkably short time more than a dozen frightened girls and women had formed a bucket brigade under Cora's direction, and as fast as they could get the pails they handed them, filled and again refilled, to the boys, who were now doing all in their power to keep the fire from spreading to the dining-room floor.""Yes, three,"" and Jack, his shirt sleeves rolled up, and looking like the earnest worker he was, dashed again down a step into the dense smoke to splash the pail of water on the smouldering but now well-wetted woodwork.Ed and Walter had carried the cook and the dishwasher out from the kitchen immediately after the explosion of the boiler, and the other injured ones were in the little cottage adjoining the hotel, where Miss Robbins was binding up their burns and making good use of her skill and the materials that she carried in her emergency case.Ed rushed out, and in a short time had the _Whirlwind_ at the door. Jack and Walter were still busy with the fire, but they stopped when he called them, and together all three carried Jim tenderly out, and when Ed got in first they put the man in his arms. Cora also had been summoned, and without as much as waiting for her cap, but, getting into the cloak that Bess threw from the hall rack, she cranked up, and was at the wheel, following the directions for the nearest way to a hospital in Waterbury.They were riding back to Restover. Ed insisted upon driving the car, although Cora declared that she was not the least tired. The trip to the hospital had been made at a very high rate of speed, as the unconscious man seemed in imminent danger, and Cora's hands now trembled visibly from their work at the wheel of the _Whirlwind_.""The heavy beams and metal ceiling. I guess they have had fires before in that hotel, for the ceiling was practically of iron. I just wonder what the boys are doing about now. I fancy Walter has turned nurse to assist Miss Robbins."""
"""He certainly deserves to be chief; he did good work. When a gas tank--a small affair--started to hiss in the servants' dining room, Jack grabbed up a big palm and dumped the contents of the flower pot into the tank. It was a small thing they heated coffee on, and when, the next moment, the tank broke it was surprised to find itself buried under a bed of sand, with flowers on the grave.""""Jim. The management of that sort of place goes into the shape of bills and accounts, settled every month. Some New York company owns the place. It was a failure, and they leased it to a local man. That's why there will be no one to look after things now.""Cora and Ed left the car and went into the store. They bought all sorts of canned goods, although Cora declared they would have to be eaten raw. Then they bought bacon and eggs. Ed insisted on that, no matter, he said, if they had to come to town again and take back to Restover a gas stove. He insisted that no well-regulated emergency feed ever went without bacon and eggs. Bread and butter they procured for fifty persons. Some cake for the ladies, Ed suggested. Pork and beans, canned, Cora thought might do for breakfast, even if they had to be eaten from the cans. Then the last thought, and by no means the most trifling, was wooden plates and tin cups. The bill footed up to ten dollars, and Ed insisted that the man make out the bill as paid and marked for the Restover Hotel.As was anticipated, hunger prevailed, and when it was found that stores of eatables were in the tonneau of the _Whirlwind_ even the most helpless, nervous ladies at the hotel wanted to help get the refreshments into the house.In the dining room on the second floor were two chandeliers. Under these were, of course, tables, and before the anxious ones had time to settle their fears there stood on these tables Cora, Bess and Belle, and on the other Ed, Jack and Walter. Each of our friends had in his or her hand something that answered to the pan or pot brand of utensil, and in the pan or pot, which was held over the gas, was something that began to ""talk-talk"" out loud of good things to eat, sizzling and crisping.""I guess driving them machines makes them smart,"" said another guest, as she took the pan Cora handed down and gingerly slopped the stuff over on a wooden plate. ""I guess it is a good thing to know how to drive an automobile. Makes you right smart! Whew! but that was hot!"" and she put the overheated fingers into her mouth.""See here!"" called out Ed, ""this is no pancake party. I am not going to stay up here cooking all night. I am going down to eat. We have enough of tomatoes warmed to fill the wash bowl, and I love canned tomatoes if they are out of a washbowl. We washed the bowl, and sterilized it, and it's as good as a soup tureen."""
"His initiative was followed by the others, and presently the less timid of the guests had put food into pans and taken up their places on the tables to do their cooking, while it seemed that all at once every one ""fell to"" and procured something to eat.They were on the road again, and Miss Robbins, the physician, the business woman, the chaperon, had stayed behind to take care of those who had been injured in the explosion. There were good doctors within call, but she simply would stay, and saw no reason why the girls should not go on alone. To her the idea of being obligated to them was not to be thought of when a matter like professional business came up. Of course, this was a general disappointment, for the girls would never have entrusted themselves to her patronage if they had not felt certain that she would keep her word with them. However, the fact was that they were on the road again, and Regina Robbins was happy on the sunny porch of the big hotel, incidentally attending to a cut or two on one man's face and a bad-looking burn on the arm of another.Bess and Belle were driving along, ""their faces as long as fiddles,"" as Cora said. The boys had taken the lead, and they were having their own trouble trying to convince Walter that Miss Robbins had ""dumped"" the girls, and that it was a ""low-down trick.""The _Whirlwind_ glided along apparently happy under the firm hand of its fair owner. The _Flyaway_ seemed, too, to be glad of a chance to get away again, and as Bess threw in the third speed, according to commands from Jack, who was leading, the little silver machine darted away like an arrow freed from the bow.Several miles were covered in silence, and then they came to a signboard. It told that the main road was closed, and that they must take to a side road--a highway that was fairly good, but much more lonely.Just ahead the glare of the _Comet_ could be seen as it plunged into a deep turn in a deeper lined wood. Jack, in his _Get-There_, was after the first, and then the girls had difficulty even in getting a responding sound from the toots and the blasts which all were continually sounding.""I always thought folks carried them to ornament the cars,"" said Hazel, with an attempt at good nature, ""but it seems that a cobbler is the thing we ought to carry for an ornament. We really don't need him, but we do need new shoes.""The pump was gotten, after which, with much exertion, the shoe was on the rim, and then the blowing began. This was not so easily accomplished as had been the other parts of the mechanical operation. First Bess pumped, then Belle tried it. Hazel was sure she could do it, for she often blew up Paul's bicycle, but this tire would not blow full.It was an hour later when the boys came back. They had discovered the loss of the girls when they had gone so far ahead that it took some time to return. The race was too much for them. They were obliged to admit that, in its interest, they had forgotten the girls.""I'm not so sure,"" said Cora eagerly. ""I am afraid that there's something wrong other than the 'busted' tire. I was just about to look when you gentlemen returned. But will you please finish pumping first?""But that was only the beginning, and the end was that night came on and made faces at a very desolate party of young people, stalled miles from nowhere, with nothing but remorse of conscience to keep off the damp, night air.Jack went around literally kicking himself, demanding to know whether they hadn't done the same thing before, and dumped those poor girls in a graveyard at midnight. When would boys learn that girls can't be trusted out of sight, and so, while the boys are supposed to be the girls' brothers, these same brothers must forego sport of the racing brand?"
"Jack really felt the situation keenly. There was no way out of it, the girls could not get to a town even in the able-bodied cars, for Cora would no more leave her _Whirlwind_ there in the darkness than she would have left Bess or Belle. Then, when it was proposed that one of the boys stay to guard the machine, and the others of the party go along to some place, the objection of ""no Miss Robbins"" robbed the distracted young men of their last argument.""We can lock you in the tonneau of Cora's car,"" suggested Ed, ""and when the gypsies come they can't 'gyp' you. They may take all of us, but no power on earth, not even palm reading, can move that monster.""The idea that she really could be locked up in the car gave Belle some comfort, although Bess and Hazel were holding a most secret convention over under a tree, where the last rays of light lingered as day hurried along.""Well, I hope we have seen the last of them. I'm going to stay in the open, in the _Flyaway_. I'd rather do it than be cooped up with the girls in the tonneau, and there will be room for Bess, Belle and Hazel inside the _Whirlwind_. It won't be so bad--a night in the wide open.""With this positive assurance, the young ladies proceeded to make themselves comfortable in their novel quarters. Cora curled up in the _Flyaway_, and the _Comet_, with Ed and Jack ""sitting up in a lying-down posture,"" as they expressed it, was placed just where the young men could hear the girls whisper should any gypsies appear, or rather be scented. The first man to do picket duty, Walter, was in the _Get-There_, directly out in the road, so that presently it seemed a night in the wide open might be a novelty rather than a misfortune.Some time must have passed. Belle declared she was not asleep. Bess vowed she was still asleep. Hazel begged both girls to keep quiet, but the light of the gas lamps from the _Get-There_ was bobbing about, and the flash of a new revolver was reflected in the night.A more frightened set of girls than were our young friends that night could scarcely be imagined. Although Cora did tramp around after Ed and his lamp, with her pistol in her hand, she was trembling, and had good reason to be alarmed. As for Bess and Belle, they were, as Hazel said, ""tied up in a knot"" on the bottom of Cora's car, too terrified to cry. Hazel herself felt no inclination to explore on her own account, but was actually walking on Jack's heels, as he poked the motor lamp in and out of possible hiding places, seeking the mysterious shadow that had been seen to move and had been heard to rustle in the grass.""Well, girls, of course you are frightened,"" began Ed. ""What do you say to all crowding into the _Whirlwind_ and talking it out the rest of the night? We could make noise enough to scare away a dozen tramps.""No more thought of Miss Robbins! It was now a matter of doing the best they could to restore something of the girls' lost nerves. And Ed, Jack and Walter undertook the task with considerable more seriousness than it had occurred to the much-alarmed girls it might be necessary to give the matter.Ed and Walter took their places outside ""on the box,"" and when the three other cars were lined up close the dark, dreary night under the trees, with the prospect of a man crawling around with malice aforethought, brightened up some. Even the moon peeked through the trees to make things look more pleasant, and to Belle company had never been so delightful before. She actually laughed at everything Jack said, and agreed that it would be fun to live in a motor houseboat."
"It was the same little sister Jack often told stories to, and the same black head that now was so glad to rest where many other evenings it had rested, when the mother was out and the sister did not like to ""go to bed all alone, please, Jackie dear!""By this time a big motor car had slowed up at the side of the other cars. The chauffeur alighted and, with all the chivalry of the road, asked what the trouble was. Leaving out the scare and the hat part, the boys soon told of their difficulty and the young ladies' plight, whereat an old gentleman, the only occupant of the car, insisted that the young ladies get in with him, and that his man, Benson, be allowed to tow the stalled car out of the hills. They decided to do this, agreeing that they had had enough of ""camping out.""""Well, you can depend upon Benson. See that! He's got the car hitched already! Never saw a fellow like Benson,"" and Mr. Rand spread the robe over the knees of Belle and Cora, with whom he sat, while Hazel had taken the small chair. ""Keep warm,"" he told her. ""Night air out here is trickish. I always take plenty of robes along.""Hazel assured him that she had every comfort, and then they heard Ed toot the horn of the _Flyaway_, as he and Bess started off in the lead. Walter was in his _Comet_, and when Jack was sure that everything was in readiness for the _Whirlwind_ to be towed after the big six-cylinder machine, he jumped into his _Get-There_, and presently the whole party was off again, going toward Lenox.There was a catch in his voice this time, and while the three girls instantly felt that ""the bars were down again,"" and that they really did have a chaperon in the person of this delightful gentleman, still it would have seemed rude to break the effect of his last remark.""A fire!"" repeated Mr. Rand. ""At a hotel! The Restover, I'm sure. Why, that is my hotel. I mean I am one of the owners, and on my way up I met the woman doctor. So she was your chaperon! Well, I declare! Now, that's what I call a coincidence. That young woman--let me see. She was nursing the head waiter. Ha, ha! a good fellow to nurse. Always keep in with the head waiter.""""A bird, eh?"" and Mr. Rand laughed again. ""Well, say,"" and his voice went down into the intimate key, ""I wouldn't be surprised if your chaperon gave up her business. I heard some remarks about how very devoted she was to that head waiter."""
"""Oh, Jim, wasn't it? Why, he is getting along! By crackie!"" and he slapped his knee again, ""I have it! It was you who took Jim to the hospital! Now, I see! A motor girl with black hair and a maroon machine! Now, I have, more than ever, reason to be your friend, Miss Kimball. Jim has been with me for years, and had he died as the result of an accident at Restover--well, I shouldn't have gotten over it easily.""""But you babies have been awake all night,"" said Mr. Rand suddenly. ""Now, couldn't you just tuck in somehow and sleep a wink or two? You won't get a chance when you see Betty. She's a regular phonograph--friendship's her key.""""Then it's settled. You are each to go to sleep instantly, and if those fellows blow that horn again, I won't let them in to Betty's party,"" and Mr. Rand, in his wonderful, fatherly way, seemed to tuck each girl into a perfectly comfortable bed. ""Now sleep! No more----""Now, here it was less than a year from the time of her dear mother's death, and on her own birthday, of course, she would not have a party, but when Daddy came in with his arms full of company and bundles, as Betty put it, of course she turned right in and had an impromptu party--just to make Daddy happy.It was an easy matter to gather in a few of the nearby cottagers, of whom there were many very pleasant samples, and so, when the evening following the midnight tow arrived, the party from Chelton found themselves rested and ready for the festivities. As usual, Walter was devoted to Betty. Jack liked her, Ed admired her, but Walter claimed her--that was his way. She was a pretty girl of rather an unusual type, accounted for, her father declared, by the fact that her mother was an Irish beauty, and gave to Betty that wonderful golden-red hair, the hazel eyes and the indescribable complexion that is said to come from generations of buttermilk.Belle and Bess found it necessary to take up with some very pleasant chaps from a nearby hotel, while Cora and Hazel made themselves agreeable with two friends of Mr. Rand's--boys from New York, who had many mutual acquaintances with Chelton folks and, therefore, could talk of other things than gears and gasoline.Mr. Rand was on the side porch, and when the drawing-room conversation waited for the next remark, his voice might be heard in a very animated discussion. Cora sat near a French window, and she heard:The threat of the old gypsy woman rang in Cora's ears. She could see her raise that brown finger and hear her say: ""If you harm Salvo, harm shall be upon your head."" Cora had testified against Salvo. A hat known to belong to a member of the tribe was later found at midnight under Cora's car, miles from the town where the robbery had been committed. Were they following her?"
"""And to-morrow,"" faltered Walter, ""we pass on. I wish we had decided to stay in the Berkshires, but of course the girls must make the White Mountains,"" and he fell back in his chair as if overwhelmed. ""I fancy Bess is ambitious to climb Mount Washington.""""But the season wanes,"" remarked Cora, ""and we must keep to our itinerary. Now that my machine has been overhauled I anticipate a royal run. Betty, can't you come with us? Mr. Rand says you have been here all summer----""""Why, go, of course; it would be the very thing for you. And then, don't you see, I shouldn't have to give up my job as chaperon,"" and he clapped his hands on his knees and chuckled with a relish that all enjoyed.""Personal. Oh, all right--take Betty,"" and Walter emitted a most unmusical brawl. ""Of course, you and Ed are keeping the contract. You are doing as you please. Behold Ed now, carrying Cora over a pebble----""The young men were exploring the woods in the White Mountains. The girls were racing about in absolute delight over the ferns, while Mr. Rand, who had actually taken the ""jaunt"" from the hotel afoot, sat on a huge stone comparing notes with his muscles, and with the inactive years of discretion and indiscretion.""But it's the home town, and Cora knows her name is on some committee,"" replied Ed. ""I guess we will get enough of these wilds in a week. At any rate, all Cora does care for is the car--she would rather motor than eat.""""Are you so tired? Poor dad! I didn't think the walk was too much. But you do feel it!"" and she sat down on a soft clump of grass at his feet. ""Well, as soon as the girls get their ferns and things they want to take home for specimens, we will start back. If you really are tired, we could get a carriage at the foot of the hill.""""And have you youngsters laugh at me! Never! I would die walking first,"" and Mr. Rand stretched himself to show how near death he really was. ""Now, I tell you, we will all take the bus back. That would be more like it."""
"This suggestion was rapidly spread among the woodland party, and when the girls did finally consent to desert the growing things and leave a ""speck of something for the rabbits to eat,"" as Jack put it, the start for the hotel was made.All this time the woman was standing directly in Cora's way. The path was very narrow, and on either side was close brushwood. Cora stepped in the bushes in order to get out to the road, and as she did she stumbled and fell.""I'll help her up,"" the woman exclaimed, when she saw that Ed was angry enough to thrust her to the edge of the pathway. ""I see a fine fortune in her eyes. They are black, her hair is black, and she has the appearance of the girl who runs an automobile. Oh, yes, I remember!"" and she now turned away satisfied. ""These girls ride much. But she--she is their leader!""Ed was hailing the driver of the bus--""Silent Bill,"" they called him, because he was never known to keep still, not even at his grandmother's funeral. Silent Bill lost no time in getting his horses headed right, also in starting out to describe the wonders and beauties of the White Mountains.That evening there was to be a hop at the hotel. As many of the patrons were soon leaving for home, it was expected that the affair would be entered into with all the energy that could be summoned from the last of the season. There would not be another big affair until the next summer, so all must ""make hay"" while the lights held out.Our friends had some trouble in finding just the correct wearing things in the small auto trunks, but pretty girls can so safely depend upon youth and good manners that simple frocks were pressed literally and physically for the occasion, whereas many of the all-season guests at the Tip-Top were not so self-reliant. Motor-made complexions, and the eyes that go with that peculiar form of beauty, formed a combination beyond dispute.Cora wore her pale yellow poplin, Betty was in all white, of course; Bess looked like an apple blossom in something pinkish, and Belle was the evening star in her dainty blue. Hazel ""had on"" a light green affair. We say ""had on,"" for that's the way Hazel had of wearing things--she hated the bother of fixing up.The young men were not expected to have evening ""togs"" in their runabout traps, but they did have some really good-looking, fresh, summer flannels that made them appear just as well dressed and much better looking than some of the ""swells"" in their regular dress suits.""Indeed!"" and the little lady flounced off. ""Now you may fill in that girl's card over there--the red-headed one. She has been looking at you most all evening, and I have promised at least four dances.""After the ""Paul Jones,"" a feature of the Tip-Top affairs, had been danced, every one wanted to cool off or down, according to the temperature desired. Cora was with Ed. They had drifted out on a side porch. Without any preamble one of the waiters touched Ed on the arm and told him there was a message for him waiting in the office."
"""No, give the alarm first, and look afterward,"" insisted Ed. ""The thing that counts is to find her; people's nerves may rest afterwards. I think we had best call the hotel manager. That message sent me was a fake. It was an envelope addressed to me, and contained nothing but a blank paper. It was a game to get me away from Cora!""Jack felt as if something was gripping at his heart. Cora gone! Could it be possible that anything had really happened to her? Could she have been kidnapped? No, she must be somewhere with some of the girls.""A young lady has just disappeared from the west-end porch,"" began Ed, rather awkwardly, ""and I fear that something strange has happened to her. I was called in here by this fake message""--he produced a slip of blank paper--""and while I was in here she disappeared.""They passed through the halls, where knots of the guests were strolling about passing the time between the dances--all apparently happy and contented. But Jack and Ed! What would be the outcome of their anxiety?""Some one has been in here, or some one here has made away with a lot of the silver and with money from the men's pockets,"" replied the chef indignantly. ""We have got to find out who is the culprit. I won't stand for that sort of thing.""""We must first institute a thorough search,"" declared Mr. Blake. ""You men form an outside posse. Be quick. Search every inch of the grounds. Max, no more kitchen duty to-night. Here, Ben, you ring the hall bell. That will bring the porters together. Then, Dave""--to a handsome young Englishman--""I put you in charge. That young lady must be found tonight.""Belle was obliged to call for a doctor. Nor was it any case of imagined nerves. The excitement of the big ball had been enough, the disappearance of Cora was more than her weak heart could stand. Bess tried to be brave, but to lose Cora! Then she recalled the face at the window."
"""Here, porter,"" called Mr. Rand, when he had heard all the details that could be given, ""get me a donkey--a good, lively donkey. I can manage one of the little beasts better than I can a horse. I used to ride one in Egypt. I'll go over the hills if it is midnight.""But how suddenly all had been thrown into a panic of fear at the loss of Cora! Not a girl to play pranks, in spite of some whispers about the hotel, those most concerned knew that Cora Kimball was at least being held a prisoner against her will somewhere; by whom, or with whom, no one could conjecture.""You deserve something, too,"" and the older woman, speaking to a young girl, gave the latter a blow with a whip. The girl winced, and showed her white teeth. She would some day break away from Mother Hull.They were riding in a gypsy wagon through the mountains, and it was one hour after Cora Kimball had been taken away from the porch of the Tip-Top. The drivers of the wagon were the most desperate members of the North Woods gypsy clan, and they had not the slightest fear that the searchers, who were actually almost flashing their lights in to the very wagon that bore Cora away, could ever discover her whereabouts.The night seemed blacker and darker at each turn. Shouts from the searchers occasionally reached the ears of those within the wagon, and once Mr. Rand on his donkey might have seen them but for the trickery of the driver, who pulled his horses into some shadowy bushes and waited for the searchers to pass.Cora tossed on her bed of straw. The chloroform kept her quiet, but she knew and felt that she was being borne away somewhere into that dark and lonely night. She could remember now how Ed had gone inside the hotel, and he had not come back! He would be back presently, and yes, she would try to sleep until he returned!Cora opened her eyes. Standing over her was a woman--or was it a dream? A woman with flowing hair, beautiful, dark eyes, a band of gold like a crown about her head, and shimmering, dazzling stuff on her gown. Was Cora really awake?The moments were becoming more real to Cora, but with consciousness came that awful sickness and that dizziness. She looked at the woman in the flowing red robes. Who could she be? Surely she was beautiful, and her face was kind and her manner sweet.""Do you mind if I smoke?"" asked the woman. ""I am Helka, the gypsy queen. That is, they call me that, although I am really Lillian, and I never had any fancy for this queening."" She smiled bitterly. The girl entered again with a tray and a small silver case. ""The water is for my friend,"" said the queen, and the girl walked over to Cora. ""Do you think you are strong enough to take milk? Perhaps you would like lime in it."""
"""With Ed? I wish they had kidnapped Ed, although you are very nice, and when I heard them putting you in the dark room, where we put the bad gypsy girls, I insisted upon them bringing you right here. I had some trouble, Sam is a rough one, but I conquered. And let me tell you something."" She stooped very low and whispered, ""Trust me! Don't ask any questions when the girls are around. You may have everything but freedom!""Cora turned and buried her face in the cushions. She realized that she had been abducted, and was being held a prisoner in this strange place. But she must--she felt she must--do as the woman told her. Just a few tears from sheer nervousness, then she would be brave.She picked up an instrument and fingered it. It seemed like the harp, but it was not much larger than a guitar. The chords were very sweet, very deep and melodious. She was a skilled musician; even in her distress Cora could not fail to notice that.""I haven't any new music,"" said the queen. ""They promised to fetch me some, but this trouble has kept the whole band busy. Now, how do you like this?"" She swept her white fingers over the strings like some fairy playing with a wind-harp. ""That is my favorite composition.""Cora's heart was beating wildly. She could not sleep, although her eyes were so heavy, and her head ached fiercely. The reaction from that powerful drug was setting in, and with that condition came all the protests of an outraged nature. She tossed on her couch. The gypsy queen heard her.""Oh, I cannot help it,"" she sobbed. ""If only I could die!"" Then she stopped and touched the gentle hand that was stroking her brow. ""You must not mind what I say to-night. It has all been so terrible,"" she finished."
"""But I like you, and will be your friend,"" assured the voice as the other leaned so closely toward her. ""Yet, I cannot blame you for suffering. It is only natural. Let me give you some mineral water. That may soothe your nerves.""The light was turned higher, and the form in the white robe flitted over to a cabinet. Cora could see that this gypsy wore a thin, silky robe. It was as white as snow, and in it the young woman looked some living statue.""Oh, as for that, I am glad to have something to do. I have always read of the glory of nursing. Now I may try it. I am very vain and selfish. All I do I do for my own glory. If you are better, and I have made you so, I will be quite satisfied.""The gypsy sat down beside Cora. Without touching her face she was passing her hands before Cora's eyes. The latter wondered if this might not be unsafe. Suppose the gypsy should hypnotize her into sleep and that she might not be able to awaken? Yet the sensation was so soothing! Cora thought, then stopped thinking. Sleep was coming almost as it had come when the man seized her.""Would you?"" asked Helka of Cora. ""I have a good bathroom, and there is plenty of water."" She smiled and showed that wonderful set of teeth. Cora thought she had never before seen such human pearls.The girl slipped her hand in her blouse and produced a paper. The queen grasped it eagerly. ""Oh, yes,"" she said, ""I knew he would write. Good David!"" and she tore open the envelope. Cora watched her face and guessed that the missive was from the lover. Lena went out to bring the breakfast things."
"""Not since they suspect. It was then they bought the two fierce dogs. I would never dare pass them. Sometimes they ask me to take a ride in the big wagon, but I never could ride in that. You see, I am not all a gypsy. My father was a sort of Polish nobleman and my mother was part English. She became interested in the great question of the poor, and so left society for this--the free life. My father was also a reformer, and they were married twice--to make sure. It is my father's money that keeps me like this, and, of course, the tribe does not want to lose me.""""I met him when I rode like a queen in an open chariot in a procession. That is, he saw me, and, like the queens in the old stories, he managed to get a note to me. Then I had him come to the park we were quartered in. And since then--but it does seem so long!""Cora was silent. Presently the girl returned and placed the linen tablecloth on the floor. Following her came the other girl, with a tray of things. It was strange to see them set the table on the floor, but Cora remembered that this was a custom of the wanderers. When the breakfast had been arranged, the queen slipped down beside her coffee like a creature devoid of bones.She was very graceful and agile--like some animal of the forest. Cora took her place, with limbs crossed, and felt like a Turk. But the repast was not uninviting. The berries were fresh, and the milk was in a clean bowl; in fact, everything showed that the queen's money had bought the service.They talked and ate. Helka was very gay, the letter must have contained cheering news, and Cora was reminded how much she would have loved to have had a single word from one of her dear ones. But she must hope and wait.""Do take some water cress,"" pressed the strange hostess, possibly noting that Cora ate little. ""I think this cress in America is one of your real luxuries. We have never before camped at a place where it could be gathered fresh from the spring."" Daintily she laid some on the green salad on a thin slice of the fresh bread, and after offering the salt and pepper, placed the really ""civilized"" sandwich on the small plate beside Cora. ""There is just one thing I should love to go into the world for,"" said the queen. ""I would love to have my meals at a hotel. I am savagely fond of eating."""
"""We had such a splendid hotel,"" answered Cora with a sigh. ""It seems a mockery that I cannot invite you there with me--that even I cannot go myself. I keep turning the matter over and over in my mind, and the more I think the more impossible it all seems.""""Nothing is impossible in Gypsy land,"" replied the queen, helping herself to some berries. ""And it may even not be impossible to do as you suggest. But we must wait,"" and she smiled prettily. ""You have a very great habit of haste; feverish haste, the books call it. I believe it is worse for one's complexion than are cigarettes. Let me begin making a Gypsy of you by teaching you to wait. You have a great deal to wait for.""Cora glanced around her to avoid the eyes of the speaker. Surely she did have a great deal to wait for. ""Do you stay in doors all the time?"" she asked, glad to think of some leading question. ""I should think that would hurt your complexion.""""We often walk in the grounds. You see, we own almost all the woods, but I am afraid they will not trust you yet. You will have to promise me that you will not try to escape if I ask that you be allowed to walk with me soon,"" said Helka.Cora was now strong enough in nerve and will to observe her surroundings. The room was very large, and was undoubtedly used formerly as a billiard parlor, for it was situated in the top of the big house, and on all sides were windows, even a colored glass skylight in the roof. The floors were of hardwood and covered partially with foreign rugs. There were low divans, but no tables nor chairs. The whole scene was akin to that described as oriental. Lena returned with the robes for Cora, and laid them on a divan. Then she adjusted a screen, thus forming a dressing room in one corner. This corner was hung with an oblong mirror, framed in wonderful ebony. Helka saw that this attracted Cora's attention.""I am glad you are dark; it will make it easier, and the tribe will think you are safer. I really would like to get you back to your friends, but then I should lose you. And I don't see, either, how it ever could be managed unless they want to let you go."""
"The new tribe! That might mean more freedom for Helka. But she must be cautious--this old woman was the backbone of all the tribes, and every word she spoke might mean good or evil to all the American gypsies. She was all-powerful, in spite of Helka's pretended power.The woman shook her head. All the while her eyes were searching for Cora, and she knew very well that the stolen girl was back of that screen. She wanted to see her, to know what she looked like in daylight; also to know how she was behaving.""You are always warning,"" and Helka laughed. ""I am afraid, Mother Hull, that we will begin to doubt your warnings. This young girl makes an admirable gypsy, yet you warned me so much before she came.""Helka opened the cigar box. ""Cigarettes, I suppose,"" she said. Then she smiled. ""Why, it's a present--a bracelet. I suppose Sam found this as he finds everything else he sends me--in other people's pockets. Well, it is pretty, and I shall keep it. I love bracelets.""""Well, now, dear, you must not be impatient. See, I am reforming. I have not smoked today. And that is something that has not occurred in years. If you should make a lady out of a savage, would you think your time ill spent?""His voice broke and he turned his head away. The two young men were seated on the big piazza of the Tip-Top. It was just a week since the disappearance of Cora, and, of course, Mrs. Kimball had been notified by cable. She would return to America by the first steamer, but would not reach New York for some days yet. In the meantime Mr. Rand, who had turned out to be such a good friend in need, had advised Mrs. Kimball to wait a few days more before starting. He hoped and felt sure that some news of the girl would have been discovered by that time.""Yes, Mr. Rand insisted that she is the proper person, and it seems there is some reasonable explanation for her conduct. At any rate, it is well we will have some one we know. Oh, dear, Belle is so hysterical!"" and Hazel herself was almost in tears."
"""She is wonderfully clever, and it seems she did not mean to desert us at all. There is some sort of story back of her attention to the wounded ones at Restover,"" said Bess, who had been sitting at a little desk, busy with some mail.In the hotel office they met two detectives sent by Mr. Rand. They explained that they would have to have a picture of Cora to use in the press, for the purpose of getting help from the public by any possible identification.At first Jack objected, but Ed showed him that this move was necessary. So it was, with other matters, very painful for the young man to arrange with the strangers, where his sister's private life was concerned. Jack soon disposed of his part of the interview. He declared that Cora had no gentleman friends other than his own companions; also that she had never had any romantic notions about the stage or such sensational matters. In seeking all the information they could possibly obtain, that might assist in getting at a clew, the detectives, of course, were obliged to ask these and other questions.""Well, we are still at it, and will report to you every day,"" said the elder man. ""We have put our best men on the case, and have the hearty coöperation of all the newspaper men. They know how to follow up clews.""""There was something in it,"" contradicted the detective, ""but the trouble was we could not get further than the old gypsy woman's threat. She had told your sister to beware of interfering with that jailed fellow, Salvo. I believed there was some connection between her disappearance and that case, but, after talking to every one who knew anything about the gypsy band, we had to drop that clew for a time. There are no more of the tribe anywhere in the county, as far as we can learn.""""And they have not been around here since the day they moved away, when we were travelling over the mountains,"" went on Jack. ""Of course you have, as you say, taken care of all the ends, but the arrest of that fellow seems the most reasonable motive.""Jack and Ed exchanged glances. There was a girl, an Ida Giles, of whom, in the other books of this series, we were obliged to record some very unpleasant things. She was an enemy of Cora's. But the detective's idea was absurd. Ida Giles would have no part in any such conspiracy.""Now, Ed, please stop that,"" interrupted Jack. ""We have told you that it didn't matter whom she was with, the thing would have happened just the same. Any one would have fallen a victim to the false message.""Again for the detectives' information the strange man who called Ed into the hotel office was described. But of what avail was that? He was easier to hide than was Cora, and both were safely hidden, it seemed.Finally, having exhausted their skill in the way of obtaining clews, the officers left, while the two young men, alone once more, were struggling to pull themselves together, that the girls might still have hope that there was a possibility of some favorable news."
"Hazel, Betty and Bess had withdrawn. What a relief it was already to have some one who just knew how to control Belle. It had been so difficult for the young girls to try to console her, and her nerves had worked so sadly upon their own.""I suppose you thought I was a perfectly dreadful young woman,"" said Dr. Robbins cheerily. ""But you did not know (she sighed effectively) that every one has her own troubles, while a doctor has her own and a whole lot of others.""The tactful young doctor had planned to tell her story as much for the purpose of diverting Belle's mind as for any other reason. She called to the girls, who were in an adjoining room. How the strain of that one dreadful week had told upon their fresh young faces! Bess had almost lost her peach-blow; Hazel, never highly colored, but always bright of eye, showed signs even of pallor; Betty had put on too much color, that characteristic of the excitable disposition when the skin is the thermometer of the nerves, and her eyes not only sparkled, but actually glittered. All this was instantly apparent to the trained eye of the young doctor.""Yes, really. It is a strange story, but for three years mother and I have tried every means to find Leland. He was such a beautiful young fellow, and such a joy to us, but he got interested in social problems, and got to thinking that the poor were always oppressed, and all that sort of thing. Well, he had just finished college, and we hoped for such great things, when, after some warning enthusiasm, he disappeared.""""Well, we thought at first he was drowned, for he used to sit for hours on the beach talking to fishermen. But I never thought he had met with any such misfortune. Leland is one of the individuals born to live. He is too healthy, too splendid, a chap to up and die. Of course, mother thought he must be dead, or he would not keep her in anxiety, but that is the way these reformer minds usually work--spare your own and lose the cause.""""He went down there among the foreigners to study actual conditions. Did you ever hear of anything so idiotic? But that is his hobby. He has been into all kinds of labor during these three long, sorrowful years.""""I could not blame you for so doing. I had been enjoined to secrecy the very moment poor Leland laid his eyes on me. He begged me not even to send word to mother, as he said it would spoil the research of an entire year if he had to stop his work before the summer was entirely over.""""Oh, indeed he is,"" declared Miss Robbins. ""He is younger than I, and when I went to college he promised to do all sorts of stunts to prove my problems. He even wanted to try living, or dying, on one sort of food; wanted to remain up without sleeping until he fell over; wanted to sleep in dark cellars to see what effect that would have; in fact, I thought we would have to lock him up with a bodyguard to save his life, he was so enthusiastic about my profession. And as to anti-vivisection! Why, at one time he had twenty-five cats and four dogs in our small city yard to save them from the possible fate of some of their kind. I tell you, we had our hands full with pretty Leland."""
"""Well, you may some day, if he ever consents to become civilized again,"" said Dr. Robbins. ""You see, he may take to the lecture platform, but very likely the platform will be against his principles. He will want to shout from the housetops!""""But you have promised not to try to escape while you are in my charge,"" Helka reminded her. ""And surely you will keep that promise!"" There was alarm in her voice. Helka had not told Cora all of her fears.""My dear, the situation is very complex. You see, I have a respectable lover, and I live every day in hopes of some time joining him. Should our band get into disrepute, which it surely would do if discovered here, I should feel disgraced. Besides""--and she looked very serious--""there are other reasons why I cannot make any desperate move for freedom.""Helka gave Cora a choice of the dresses, and she took the black costume. There was scarcely any perceptible difference in their sizes, and when gowned Helka declared Cora looked ""_chic_."" Helka herself looked quite the society lady, her tight-fitting brown costume suiting her admirably.""We will have Lena with us--that is, she will be supposed to be with us. Then--but you must wait and see. It is rather odd, but it is better than being indoors."" Helka rang her bell and Lena appeared.It was the first time Cora had been out in the hall, and she looked around in wonderment. It was dark and dirty, so different from Helka's apartment. Lena led the way. There were three flights of stairs.Down the steps and at last on the ground! Cora's feet fairly tingled. Helka tripped along lightly ahead of her. Two ordinary-looking men were working on the grounds. The place seemed just like any other country house that might be old and somewhat neglected, but there was not the slightest evidence of it being an abode of crime or of gypsies.""Our guard,"" whispered Helka. ""They will not speak to us, but they never take their eyes off us. I don't mind them, but I hate the dogs. They never call them unless they fear I might speak with a stranger."""
"A roadway was not too distant to be seen. If only some one would come along, thought Cora, some one who might hear her voice! But if she should shout! They might both be attacked by those savage dogs.""Why, Helka! You leave me nothing to say for my fair-eyed friends. They have eyes, every one of them. Here are Betty's,"" and she grasped a sprig of a wonderful blue blossom. ""And here are dear, darling Belle's,"" picking up a spray of myrtle in bloom, ""and here are the brown eyes of Bess,"" at which remark the eyes of Cora Kimball could hardly look at the late, brown daisy, because of a mist of tears.""But Ed's?"" and at this Helka smiled prettily. ""I had an idea that Ed's eyes were sort of composite. A bit of love, that would be blue,"" and she picked up a late violet, ""a bit of faith, gray for that,"" and she found a spray of wild geranium, ""and a bit of black for steadfast honor. There! I must find a black-eyed Susan,"" and at this she actually ran away from Cora, and left the frightened girl with the men and dogs too close to her heels for comfort.For a moment Cora wanted to scream. She was too nervous to remember that she had been promised security by Helka: all she knew, and all she felt, was danger, and danger to her was now a thing unbearable.The other girl, running nymph-like through the woods, turned at the call, and putting her hands in trumpet shape to her lips, answered as do school girls and boys when out of reach of the more conventional forms of conversation.""If we could poison the dogs, and then slide down from one of these windows in the dark, perhaps we could get away,"" said Helka. ""But what would happen when we found ourselves out in the dark woods? If they found us----""""And so handsome and so strong! He is like some grand old prince--his hair is like corn-silk and his eyes are like the blue sky,"" and Helka, as she reclined, with her chin in her hands, upon her couch, almost forgot that Cora was with her.""Lena will fetch the stuff to-morrow morning, and they will be dead by night. Then we will tie a rope to the window-sill or some strong place, and we will slip down. Oh, Helka, I will go down first, and go out first, and if they do not miss me, they will not miss you. It will be safe to follow me as quickly as you see I am off!""""Then we must both sleep, and be strong. Tomorrow we will be very good to every one. I will be well, and if I cannot eat I will pretend to. Lately I have almost choked on my food."" Cora sipped the milk and then fell back exhausted."
"""And we must take care of ourselves! Well, that may be. At any rate, I am glad I did not die. Oh, Helka, if you only could know my brother Jack. He is the noblest boy! And our girls! You know, we are called the motor girls, don't you?""""From my mother's old letters. She told me as much as she wanted me to know. She said I was not all a gypsy, but I might choose my life when I grew up. She left me with a very kind gypsy nurse, but when she died--they took me to that horrible Mother Hull.""""You don't mean to say that you are going on some dangerous trip in the mountains--yes, I hear, in the mountains--to help some foolish girl? I know you did not say foolish; I said that. Leland, listen to me. Do you hear? All right. Now, listen. Don't you dare to go away again and not tell me exactly where you are going. I have only just--yes, I know all about your ideas. I am sure she is charming and worthy and all that, but----""""Don't you fear, little girl,"" and there was an unmistakable note of tenderness in Mr. Rand's voice. ""One who means well usually does well, however strange may be his methods. The first thing to do is to see if we can get him again at the Restover.""Without waiting for her answer, the gentleman rushed out in the hall himself, and was presently calling up that hotel. As he happened to be one of the owners of the summer house, it was not difficult for him to get direct communication and answers. But the man asked for was gone. Had just gone. Had just caught a north-bound train--the express.Belle, Bess, Betty and Hazel had just returned from a melancholy ramble. Belle was better--really better now than some of her companions, who had been bearing up well under the strain--but all the young faces were very sad. The boys had telephoned that they had some hope for developments in the clew they had gone away to investigate, but that was very meager encouragement. The boys always had hope--over the 'phone. Dr. Robbins told them part of the story."
"""Oh, the idea!"" exclaimed Belle. ""Isn't that like a tale of the olden times--for a young man to run away to rescue a lady! Now, what in the world is she being rescued from? Exactly. That's the impossible Leland. Never says who she is, what she is, or what about her. Now, as if we could put a story like that together!"" She sank back as if mentally exhausted from the effort to ""put it together.""He handed her one little green booklet. She glanced over it and mumbled a lot of stuff through which she had to pass in order to get at what was wanted. Then she paused. ""Oh, yes, there's a place on the Woodland Branch railroad called Hemlock Grove. Of course, that must be around the corner from Hemlock Bend.""They all agreed that it must be. Then to take the trip--they would not wait for three days. Mr. Rand said that would be absurd, but when the boys should return to the hotel, which would be that afternoon, they would all start out in their cars. They would make a double hunt--for Cora and for Leland.""I just feel now that something will happen,"" declared the optimistic Betty. ""If four girls and four boys, besides the best man in New England, to wit, my daddy, cannot find them, then, indeed, they are lost.""""Then we will take that road and search every inch of it,"" declared Bess, also inspecting the gloves. ""The dear old things!"" and she actually pressed them to her lips. ""I feel as if you had brought us a message from Cora.""It was a brave effort, for the girls felt anything but certain. So many hopes had arisen and been dashed down! so many clews had been followed, only to be abandoned! so many messages had been sent in vain!But with such hope as they could muster up the party in four automobiles started out from the Tip-Top. Without exception every guest was interested in the case, and as the motorists chugged off many were the wishes of good luck that were wafted after them."
"Another disappointment would seem too cruel. Walter declared he could pick a trail they had never yet followed. Betty said she knew a very dark and dangerous pass, where she had lost her bracelet. Belle wanted to go by the river road, so that when it was actually left to Bess to decide, as she was next in authority to Cora in the Motor Girls' Club, she spoke for the way through the woods, straight up into a rough and shaggy pass.""I am too anxious to see,"" objected her sister. ""The rest are all within calling distance. See, there are the boys. Let us hurry into the side road. Whoever they are, they have had wagons up here.""It required careful driving to cover the pass, for the roadway was newly made, and by no means well-finished. Great stones continually rolled out from under the big, rubber wheels, and Bess was on the alert to use the emergency brake, although the road was somewhat up hill. She feared the motor would stop and that they might back down.""Well,"" said Mr. Rand finally, ""we are looking for somebody. You haven't happened to hear or to have seen anything of a young girl in these parts, a girl--who might have gotten lost in the woods; have you?""""I have heard that a girl was lost,"" replied the man. ""But I'm one of the forest rangers and I keep pretty close to my post at this time of the season, watching for fires. There are so many young folks camping and reckless with matches. Is there no trace of her? The missing girl from the hotel, is the one you mean, isn't it?""""There are no camps in the woods this year,"" the man assured him. ""We have kept them out of this particular clearing by law. There are a lot of them scattered about in the mountains, but as far as I could find there is no camp deep in the woods. You see every summer someone gets lost in these woods, and we don't like the gypsies to have the first chance of finding them. But sit down,"" and he cleared the bench of the water pail. ""You must have had a weary search.""""I am not the least bit afraid; in fact, I think I shall just sing to show them I feel secure,"" and Cora snatched up the guitar. She fingered it tenderly, then let it rest for a moment in her arms. ""Did Lena say it was all right?""""When it is very dark, and all are in bed, I will fasten the rope to the big nail that Lena fetched. Then I shall try it from this side, and if it holds me I will slip down. Then I shall run. When you no longer hear the leaves rustle, or if you can hear the whistle I will give you as a signal, then you must come."""
"""Then I will sing,"" said Cora. ""See, the stars are coming out. The night will help us. I have marked every turn in the path. I pretended to be moving the stones from the grass, and I was placing them where I could feel them--in the dark.""The girls were speaking in subdued tones. A single word might betray them if overheard. Yet they were too nervous to remain silent, and Helka seemed so impressed, so agitated, at the thought of leaving, forever, her strange life.""Yes, that is so. Well, I have never prayed, that has always seemed a weak sort of way to struggle,"" said the queen, ""but it seems to me now that I must seek strength from some One more powerful than those of earth. There _must_ be such a power.""""Indeed there is,"" replied Cora. ""But now let us be happy. See the stars, how they glitter,"" and she turned back the drapery from the window. ""And see, we shall have a great, big, bright moon to show us our way.""""Perhaps that little, frowsy Christine. She seems to stay out of nights. I heard her last night when you were sleeping. I really think she came in very late, crept upstairs, and then I am sure she tried this door.""""She belongs to another tribe and has only come here lately,"" said Helka. ""I have always suspected she was sent to spy on me. If it were not just to-night--this very night--I would call her to an account.""A long line of automobiles had rumbled along the narrow road. Not a horn sounded, not one of the cars gave any warning. It was night in the White Mountains, and besides the party from the Tip-Top, who had been searching from late that afternoon, there were also, on Mr. Rand's orders, two officers in a runabout.Now, the one great difficulty of this searching tour was that of not sounding the horns, consequently they had to feel their way, as on almost any part of the mountain roads there might be stray cottagers, or campers, or rustics, in danger of being run down.Giant trees threw formidable shadows, and smaller ones whispered the secrets of the wood. But the girls and boys, and the women and men were too seriously bent upon their work to notice any signs so unimportant.Every man, young and old, in the party took out his revolver and had it in readiness. Then, in a solid line, they deliberately walked up to the old house--through the path lined with boxwood over the little flower garden."
