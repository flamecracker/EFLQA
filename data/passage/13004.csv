"Introduction Goop! Goop! Goop! Window-Smoochers Visiting A Low Trick Picking and Stealing When to Go Loyalty ""Ain't"" Indolence Nell the Nibbler The Law of Hospitality Justice The Flower Hospital A Puzzle Puppy Goops Frankness Exaggeration The Duty of the Strong Noise! Noise! Noise! Walking with Papa Stealing Rides Piano Torture Untidy Goops At Table A Goop Party How to Eat Soup Inquisitiveness Baby's Apology Don't Be Good In the Street Write Right! Sick Furniture Wet Feet Borrowed Plumes Dress Quickly! The Goop Picnic Danger! Book-Manners The Reason Why Poor Mother! In Goop Attire Cheating Impossible Children, although you might expect My manners to be quite correct (For since I fancy I can teach, I ought to practice what I preach), 'Tis true that I have often braved My mother's wrath, and misbehaved! And almost every single rule I broke, before I went to school! For that is how I learned the way To teach you etiquette to-day. So when you chance to take a look At all the maxims in the book, You'll see that most of them are true, I found them out, and so will you, For if you are as GOOP derided, You may perhaps reform, as I did! Little Goops are marking On the window pane; I forbid, in vain! Noses, when they're greasy, Leave a smooch so easy! Rub it out again! I shall have to scold them, For I've often told them, Kindly, to refrain! The meanest trick I ever knew Was one I know _you_ never do. I saw a Goop once try to do it, And there was nothing funny to it. He pulled a chair from under me As I was sitting down; but he Was sent to bed, and rightly, too. It was a _horrid_ thing to do! When you go a-calling, Never stay too late; You will wear your welcome out If you hesitate! Just before they're tired of you, Just before they yawn, Before they think you are a Goop, And wish that you were gone, While they're laughing with you, While they like you so, While they want to keep you,-- _That's_ the time to go! When you are talking, I expect You'd better hold your head erect! Please look me squarely in the eye Unless you're telling me a lie. For if you crouch and look askance, Regarding me with sidelong glance, I'll think it is a Goop I see Who is _afraid_ to look at me! ""Won't you walk a little farther?"" Said a Goop to his Papa; ""It is really quite delightful, And we haven't travelled far; Wont you walk a little farther, There's a house I'd like to see! Won't you walk a little farther, Till we reach that cherry-tree?"""
"""Won't you carry me? I'm tired!"" Whined a Goop to his Papa; ""And my feet are sore and weary, And we've gone so _very_ far! Won't you carry me? I'm tired! And I _can't_ walk back alone! Won't you carry me? I'm tired!"" And the Goop began to groan. Why is it Goops must always wish To touch _each_ apple on the dish? Why do they never neatly fold Their napkins until they are told? Why do they play with food, and bite Such awful mouthfuls? Is it right? Why do they tilt back in their chairs? _Because they're Goops!_ So no one cares! Peelings on the sidewalk, Apple-cores and all, Kick them in the gutter; Save some one a fall! Barrel hoops, glass, and cans, And wires in the street, Kick them in the gutter; You'll save some horse's feet! And when they were done, and they'd had all their fun, They proved they were Goops, or were blind; For they picked up their wraps and they left all their scraps For the _next_ picnic party to find! Goop! Goop! Goop! I wish you'd wash your face! Goop! Goop! Goop! Your hands are a disgrace! Goop! Goop! Goop! Put things back in their place! I wish you were polite, Instead of a Goop! Goop! Goop!"
"When a Goop goes out to visit, 'T isn't very pleasant, is it, To hear him ask his friends for things to eat? And to hear the little sinner Say he wants to stay to dinner Is a piece of impoliteness hard to beat! ""_Mother said that I could stay_ _If you asked me!_"" is the way That a Goop will make them ask him to remain. It is better to be slighted Than to stay when not invited, For they _never_ ask a Goop to come again! There was a Goop who lay in bed Till half-past eight, the sleepy-head! He couldn't find his stockings, for He'd thrown them somewhere on the floor! He couldn't find his reading-book; He had forgotten where to look! His breakfast grew so very cold, This lazy Goop began to scold; And then he blamed his mother, kind! ""_You made me late to school_!"" he whined. There is a very simple rule That every one should know; You may not hear of it in school, But everywhere you go, In every land where people dwell, And men are good and true, You'll find they understand it well, And so I'll tell it you: _To every one who gives me food, Or shares his home with me, I owe a debt of gratitude, And I must loyal be. I may not laugh at him, or say Of him a word unkind; His friendliness I must repay, And to his faults be blind!_ I dreamed I found a sunlit room Filled with a delicate perfume, Where, moaning their sweet lives away, A thousand lovely flowers lay. They drooped, so pale, and wan, and weak, With hardly strength enough to speak, With stems so crushed and leaves so torn It was too dreadful to be borne! And one white lily raised her head From off her snowy flower bed. And sighed, ""_Please tell the children, oh! They should not treat the flowers so! They plucked us when we were so gay, And then they threw us all away To wither in the sun all day! We all must fade, but we'll forgive If they'll let other flowers live_!"" I thought I saw a little Goop Who hung behind a cart; I looked again. He'd fallen off! It gave me _such_ a start! ""If he were killed, some day,"" I said, ""'Twould break his mother's heart!"" I think you are a Goop, because You never shut your bureau drawers, You do not close the door! You leave your water in the bowl, You put your peelings in the coal! I've told you _that_ before! ""Please come to my party!"" said Jenny to Prue; ""I'm going to have Willy, and Nelly, and you; I'm going to have candy and cake and ice-cream, We'll play _Hunt-the-Slipper_, we'll laugh and we'll scream. We'll dress up in caps, we'll have stories and tricks, And you won't have to go till a quarter past six!"" But alas! When she mentioned her party, at tea, Her mother said, ""No! It can't possibly be!"" So Jane had to go and explain to her friends, And that is how many a Goop party ends! Just speak to your mother _before_ you invite, And then it's more likely to happen all right!"
"If you were writing with your nose, You'd _have_ to curl up, I suppose, And lay your head upon your hand; But now, I cannot understand, For you are writing with your pen! So sit erect, and smile again! You need not scowl because you write, Nor hold your fingers _quite_ so tight! And if you gnaw the holder so, They'll take you for a Goop, you know! One of them grew chilly; Said he felt so ill he Knew he'd caught a cold, and coughed a lot! The other was so warm he Said he _liked_ it stormy! Which of them was Goop, and which was not? All your life you'll have to dress, Every single day (unless You should happen to be sick), Why not learn to do it quick? Hang your clothes the proper way, So you'll find them fresh next day; Treat them with a little care, Fold them neatly on a chair; So, without a bit of worry, You can dress in quite a hurry. Think of the slovenly Goops, before You strew your clothing on the floor! Ink, ink! What do you think! You're sure to be stained, if you play with the ink! You're sure to get black, if you play with the ink-well, Before you begin it, just stop once, and think well! All over your fingers, all over your face, All over your clothes, and all over the place! Your mother'll be angry, your father'll say, ""_There! I said not to touch it; you said you'd take care!_"" Everybody liked Ezekiel. Why? You could scarcely find his equal. Why? If he made a mistake, He said he was wrong; If he went on an errand, He wasn't gone long; He never would bully, Although he was strong! Everybody hated Mello. Why? He was such a surly fellow. Why? If you asked him for candy, He'd hide his away; He never would play What the rest wished to play; He would say _horrid_ words That he oughtn't to say! I'll make you a dress of a towel, And trim it all over with soap, With a sponge for a hat And a wet one, at that! And _then_ you'll be happy, I hope! You may act like a Goop, if you please, In garments constructed like these!"
