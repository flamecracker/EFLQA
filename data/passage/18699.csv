passage
"""Oh, Alice! Be careful! Look out!"" exclaimed the other occupant of the pleasant little room, a room made habitable by the articles of tasteful adornment in it, rather than by the location of the apartment, or the place itself. There was a ""homey"" air about it.""It's an old hat from now on!"" broke in the younger girl, not opening her eyes. ""It's spoiled anyhow. Some of the water from that parlor scene, where Mr. Bunn upset the globe of gold fish, splashed on it, and the spots never will come out.""""It doesn't matter. Mr. Pertell is going to buy me a new one. He said it was up to the company to do that, especially as I did so well in that burning room scene the other day. There!"" and the girl on the couch raised her small fist and plumped it full on the crown of the chic little toque she was wearing.""Ruth DeVere--Lady Clarissa--Se√±orita Alamondi! Whatever you like, only let me--alone! I've posed and acted and otherwise contorted myself before at least five thousand feet of film today, and I'm not going to be disturbed now, just for the sake of a hat that is as good as paid for anyhow, so 'please go 'way and let me sleep,'"" and Alice murmured the chorus of a once popular song.Ruth sighed. Somehow, looking at her gentle and refined face, one understood that a sigh, from her, was the only possible answer under the circumstances. Not that the girl on the couch, with closed eyes, was unrefined. But there was a wholesome air of good health about her that caused one to think of a ""jolly good fellow,"" rather than a girl who needed to be helped on and off trolley cars.""You _are_ tired,"" commented Ruth, after a pause. ""Shall I make you a cup of tea, dear? Or we could go over to Mrs. Dalton's, if you like. You know she told us always to come in when we came from the theatre, and have tea.""""Well, we are getting more than our share of them this season. I wish Mr. Pertell would swing to a good American drama again. Say, didn't we have fun at Rocky Ranch?"" and as she asked this some of the weariness seemed to slip off Alice as a discarded garment is let fall. She sat up, her eyes flashing with fun, and her cheeks that had been pale were now suffused with a heightened color."
"""That _was_ rather scary,"" assented Alice. ""But it was outdoors, and that was what I love. Oh, I can just smell that wonderful air yet!"" and she breathed in a long breath. A look of annoyance passed over her face, and she made a gesture of disapproval, ""wrinkling"" her nose.""I _think_ there is some cheese,"" went on Ruth, following her younger sister. ""But don't make the rarebit as you did last time. It was so tough that Russ said it would do very well to half sole his rubber boots.""""That was because I put the milk in too suddenly. I won't do it that way this time. Come on, we'll get up a nice little tea for daddy. He's sure to be tired also. They had to film that big scene of the accusation over three times before Mr. Pertell was satisfied.""""Guess he doesn't call much _trouble_ where _you_ are concerned,"" said Alice significantly, cutting up some chunks of cheese which she put in a double boiler with some lumps of butter. ""He said if you wanted a book to give you some of the details of the country, where that English play was supposed to take place, you were going to have it.""""It's awfully good of him,"" murmured Ruth. ""I just casually mentioned that I'd like to know something about the people of that section, and he offered to get a book he had once heard of. But I didn't want him to make such a fuss over it.""The girls busied themselves getting tea. The kettle was soon singing on the gas stove, the crisp odor of toast had replaced the heavier one of cabbage, and the rarebit was almost ready to serve, when a step was heard out in the hall of the apartment house where the DeVere family had their New York home.""Oh, nothing so much,"" her father said in weary tones. ""I suppose I shouldn't make such a fuss over it. But Mr. Pertell has finally decided to film the great marine drama, and that means we shall have to go out on the water, more or less. And with my sore throat that isn't just the best thing in the world for me."" Hosmer DeVere's words and manner alike were alarming to his daughters. Seldom had they seen him so moved, especially over such a seemingly simple matter as the announcement of a new moving picture drama. He and the girls, in common with the other members of the Comet Film Company, had to portray many different scenes in the course of a season's work, and though some of it was distasteful, it was seldom objected to by anyone, unless perhaps by Pepper Sneed, the ""grouch,"" or perhaps by Mr. Wellington Bunn, an actor of the old school, who could not reconcile himself to the silent drama.""I certainly hope it won't be real,"" Mr. DeVere said, ""But--Oh, well, I suppose I may as well admit the truth. You'll probably call me fussy and all that, and laugh at the superstition of an old actor. But you know we have our traditions, though I am free to confess that I have lost many of them since entering on this moving picture work. But I had a dream about this same shipwreck, and that was before I knew we were to be in it, for I might mention that Mr. Pertell has included you girls in the drama, and has prominent parts selected for you."""
"""Oh, Daddy! Now don't tell a depressing dream before tea!"" begged Alice, slipping her arms about his neck, and imprinting a kiss on a spot, which, if it were not already bald, was fast becoming so. ""Wait until after supper--the rarebit will spoil if we don't eat it at once. Wait, Daddy dear!""Ruth and Alice DeVere were moving picture girls, which you have probably guessed already. That is, they were actresses for the silent film dramas that make so much for enjoyment nowadays. Mr. DeVere was also an actor in the same company. He had been a semi-tragedian of the ""old school,"" but his voice had failed, because of a throat ailment, and he could no longer declaim his lines over the footlights. He was in distress until it was suggested to him that he take up moving picture work.This suggestion came from young Russ Dalwood, who, with his widowed mother and little brother, lived across the hall from the DeVere family, in the Fenmore Apartment on one of the West Sixty streets of New York. Russ had invented a new attachment for a moving picture camera, and he himself was a camera operator of ability.At first Mr. DeVere had refused to consider moving picture work, but he finally consented, and even allowed his daughters to take their parts in the silent drama. In the initial book of the series, ""The Moving Picture Girls,"" I related their first experiences.All was not smooth sailing. Though Mr. Frank Pertell, manager of the Comet Film Company, was a most agreeable man, the other members of the theatrical company were like those of any other organization--some were liked, and some were not. Among the former, at least from the standpoint of Ruth and Alice, was Russ; Paul Ardite, who played juvenile leads; Pop Snooks, the property man and one who did all the odd tasks; and Carl Switzer, a round-faced German, who was funny without knowing it.But neither Ruth nor Alice cared much for Laura Dixon and Pearl Pennington, two former vaudeville actresses who thought they were conferring a favor on the cameras to pose for moving pictures. Mr. Bunn, an actor of the kind styled ""Hams"", was in like case.Mr. Bunn was always bemoaning the fact that he had left the ""legitimate"" drama with a chance of playing ""Hamlet"", to take up moving picture work. But he might have been glad--especially on paydays--for he had made more out of camera work than he could have done on the regular stage.Pepper Sneed was never satisfied. He was of a gloomy nature, and always looking for trouble. Sometimes he found it, and for a time he was happy in saying ""I told you so."" But more often he proved a dismal failure as a predicter of calamities.After the girls' first introduction to the camera they went to Oak Farm where a series of pictures were taken, and, incidentally, a mystery was cleared up. Getting snowbound was another experience for our friends, but they forgot the cruelties of Winter in the happy days under the palms. And they had only recently come back from Rocky Ranch, where a number of Western dramas had been filmed, when the little scene of our opening chapter took place.Those of you who have read the previous books of this series do not need to be told much about moving pictures. And even those who select this volume as their first venture in becoming acquainted with our heroines must well know how the film pictures look from the front of the screen."
"To the uninitiated I might say that in making picture plays a company, somewhat like a regular theatrical organization, is gotten together. The play is decided upon, but instead of the acts taking place before an audience they are enacted before a camera and a man who acts as director, or manager.Some of the action takes place out of doors, amid the surroundings of nature, but most interior scenes are ""filmed,"" or taken, in the studio, under the brilliant glare of electric lights. The pictures are taken in succession on a narrow strip of celluloid film, of the same nature as those in any camera. The strips are of a standard length of one thousand feet, though some plays may ""split,"" and take only half a ""reel"" while others will fill several.When the film has been exposed, it is developed in a dark tank, and from that one ""master"" film, any number of ""positives"" can be made for use in the projecting machines. Doubtless you know that the same machine which takes the pictures does not show them on the screen.""Well, my dream was very vivid,"" Mr. DeVere said. ""I don't usually believe in omens, but this one impressed me. I dreamed we were all at sea, on a vessel in a storm, and, somehow, we became separated. I saw you girls going down with the ship, while I was taken up on a life raft.""""Oh, not at all! It was excellent!"" he exclaimed. ""I would perhaps, have thought nothing of my dream had not Mr. Pertell, a short time ago, told me something of his plans for the future. He spoke of a great marine drama he had in prospect, and we are to have prominent parts in it. But I was startled when he told me that one scene--the great one, in fact--was to be a shipwreck. He has engaged an old vessel for this purpose, and he is going to sink it with all on board.""""Oh, it will be Summer before we get to the shipwreck part,"" went on Mr. DeVere. ""But what worries me is my dream in connection with the drama. I almost told Mr. Pertell we would have nothing to do with it.""""Oh, Father! You can't do that!"" exclaimed Ruth. She, as housekeeper, knew how much money was required in these days of the high cost of living. Though Mr. DeVere and his daughters received fair salaries, there were many expenses to be met, and if they refused present engagements they might not find it so easy to get others.""Your idea is that a man's mind is in his stomach, isn't it, daughter,"" laughed her father. ""Well, I will have some of the dessert. Oh, but I almost forgot, you will have to go down an hour earlier in the morning to the studio.""""A heavy day's work on, and Mr. Pertell wants to sketch out the preliminary scenes of the marine drama. We are actually going to sea, I believe, and he has engaged some old sailors, or at least one so far, to give it a proper nautical flavor. It's only for tomorrow that we have to go earlier than usual."""
"""Oh, I didn't actually want you to give it up,"" her father remonstrated. ""Perhaps I was foolish even to mention it. But I can't forget it--I can't!"" and he seemed to look through the walls of the room on some distant and fateful scene.There were busy times for all next day, in the studio of the moving picture concern. In the big room brilliant with electric lights as well as from the illumination that came through a sky-glass, there were several scenes from different dramas being filmed at the same time.When Ruth and Alice DeVere entered with their father, Mr. Pertell, the manager of the Comet company, was engaged off to one side, evidently instructing a man in what he must do before the camera. The man was a sailor, and it needed but a glance to show that he was a real one, and not ""made up"" for the occasion.""You see,"" said Mr. Pertell, ""you come into the shipping office, and pretend to hand over the papers. But you slip the clerk the wrong ones, and while he is examining them you reach over behind him and take the documents you want.""""Stealin' is what I call it, and it can't be called by another name to my way of thinkin'. It won't do, sir, it won't do! Jack Jepson got into trouble once, but he isn't goin' to do it again. No sir! That stealin' won't do for Jack Jepson. You've got to get someone else to sign them articles for you. No stealin' for Jack Jepson!"" and the figure of the old sailor turned and, with a rolling gait, he started across the big studio room.If any figure came between the scene and the camera with the pictures it was imprinting on the sensitive celluloid film (at the rate of sixteen per second) part of the elaborate work would have to be done over again. And as one of the characters in the little play was a celebrated dancer, whose time was paid for at an almost unbelieveable sum per hour, it would mean a heavy expense.""Avast there! Belay!"" cried Russ Dalwood, who was not at that moment engaged at the crank of some camera. He used the same sea terms the old man himself had uttered, but this salt-water ""lingo,"" or translation of the command to halt, had no effect either.Then came an interruption at a most opportune time. Just ahead of the sailor a scene from a Wild West drama was being enacted. A group of cowboys were engaged in a quarrel in the bunk house, which had been set up in the studio. The outdoor scenes of the little play were to be made later, for it is the custom in this business to make all the scenes, taking place in one locality, at the same time, regardless of their sequence in the finished play. Later the film is cut up into strips, pasted together with the proper headings, or captions, and the finished play results.And just as the old sailor, who called himself Jack Jepson, was about to step in front of the ball room scene camera, to the frantic horror of the operator, one of the cowboys, following out his lines, drew his revolver, and fired a blank cartridge at the ""villain."""
"""Mutiny!"" he fairly roared. ""What is this! Who's firin' a shot across my bows? All hands on deck t' repel boarders! Avast there!"" and he stood looking around in bewilderment, while the smoke from the revolver floated upward.""Come here!"" called Mr. Pertell running forward, and grasping the arm of the sailor before he could get away to step in front of any of the other moving picture machines. ""You don't understand, Mr. Jepson. I merely want you to----""""Yes, I reckon I heard you say what you wanted me to do. Now look here! I don't know much about you, but you come over t' our Sailors' Snug Harbor, an' you took some pictures. That was all right, I'm not captain there an' I haven't anything t' say. You said you wanted an old able-bodied man for certain work, an' I volunteered. I didn't know where the voyage was, but I signed on, an' come here; didn't I?""""No, you listen to me, first!"" exclaimed the old salt, shaking a thickened and roughened finger at the manager. ""I come here, willin' to do anything from slushin' th' mast, or holystonin' th' decks t' furlin' sail in a blow. But what do I get; eh? I ask you what do I get? Why an order to steal shippin' papers, that's what I get! An' that's a serious crime. I'm not goin' t' be mixed up with it. No sir! Not for Jack Jepson!"" and he tried to break away.""Well, it's mighty poor business for any man t' be in; that's my opinion. I was raised honest, an', man and boy, I've lived honest for fifty years, with one exception, an' that wasn't my fault, and now----"""
"""Oh, I forgot. He's going to act with you and your sister, Miss DeVere,"" said the manager. ""Come over and be introduced. You too, Mr. DeVere. He's to have a part in our great sea drama, that is, if I can ever get it started. I began explaining to Jepson, here, about taking the papers which have to do with the case, but he can't----""""Well, Miss,"" said the sailor, ""you look honest. I would believe what you'd tell me, for I know you couldn't do no wrong. Perhaps I was a bit hasty, but you see this is all new to me--this play-actin', an' shootin' at folks unexpected like. I wouldn't have tried it, only the captain at the Sailors' Snug Harbor, over on Staten Island, where I'm berthed, asked me as a favor to come here. But I don't like it!""Ruth started toward the old sailor. To her surprise her sister Alice was now in earnest conversation with him. Jack Jepson seemed to have warmed to Alice at once. And Ruth heard him saying, as she approached:""Well, Miss, you see it was this way. There was a mutiny, an' I was accused, but I wasn't guilty. There was a mystery about it when the captain disappeared, an' that mystery hasn't been solved yet, though I'd give a good bit if it were. It's hangin' over me like a nightmare, Miss. Now I'll tell you all about it, if I don't tire you.""""I think I had better defer my explanations a while,"" Ruth told herself. ""Perhaps he will be in a bettor frame of mind to listen, after he has talked with Alice. What a wonderful way she has of making friends!"" the older girl mused as she looked at the interested and flushed face of her pretty sister. At that moment Alice glanced up and caught Ruth's gaze on her.The old sailor looked up quickly, stopping in his progress toward a bench, whither Alice was leading him. It was in a quiet corner of the studio, some distance away from the various little groups that, in three-sided rooms (before the open part of which cameras were placed, and over which big lights hissed) were going through their parts in the silent dramas.""Avast there! Belay! Hold on!"" exclaimed the sailor, his voice ringing out through the studio, above the tones of those actors who, to give greater verisimilitude to their work were talking their parts, as well as going through them. They smiled at the old salt's energy."
"""Oh, that's my name--at least the Jepson part of it is. But I don't like the mister. I'm not used to it. The only time of late years when I was called Mister was when I was up before the lawyers, and I didn't like it then. Jest please call me Jack Jepson, an' 'twill sound more natural. I ask it as a favor, Miss,"" and he looked from Ruth to Alice.""Why of course we'll call you Jack,"" assented the latter. ""It will sound nicer anyhow, I think,"" she added. ""Now go on with your story. You said there was a mystery in it. Has it anything to do with--buried treasure?"" and Alice leaned forward eagerly.""I just mentioned treasure,"" Alice said with a little laugh, and a glance toward where Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon, having a rest from their moving picture work, were curiously eyeing the old sailor and the two girls.""Well, I was second mate aboard a five masted schooner engaged in the lumber business,"" went on Jack Jepson. ""We were going down to South America, in ballast t' bring back a cargo of hard woods, an' off the Hole in the Wall th' trouble started.""Well, some of th' hands laid it to the grub, an' others t' th' hard work of sailing th' craft,"" went on Jack. ""She was a mighty poor schooner in ballast, an' owing t' storms an' rough weather we had t' be takin' in or lettin' out reefs all th' while. It wasn't so bad up t' th' time we got off th' Hole in th' Wall, but from then on it was fierce!""I'd heard rumors that th' crew was goin' t' mutiny an' demand that we put in at some port, an' get better grub, an' more hands, for we was short of sailors. But I didn't pay much attention to th' underhand talk until it was too late. Then, all at once, when we had got away down about off Anegada, th' mutiny broke in full force. The men riz up, an' overpowered th' officers--th' captain was made a prisoner in his cabin, an' I was given my choice of joinin' th' mutineers or walkin' th' plank.""""Of course I didn't want t' walk no plank,"" resumed the sailor, ""so I temporized. I thought maybe I could beat th' mutineers after all. So I pretended t' join 'em. Things got pretty bad. Many of 'em was for puttin' th' captain away--tossin' him overboard, an' there was a fight about it. Matters got t' such a pass that pistols were fired, an' th' captain would have been shot, an' killed, only a fellow named Mike Tullane, a rough character, an' one of the leaders of th' mutiny, stepped up sudden like an' saved th' captain's life by knockin' aside th' ruffian's gun.""Well, of course there was a fight then, but Mike seemed t' come out all right, bein' a leader, an' havin' th' men pretty well with him. Anyhow, th' mutineers were in charge of th' ship, an' off Anegada, one of th' little British Islands of the West Indies, we were put about t' run for port. Jest what was t' be done no one seemed to know. After the men got th' ship they didn't know what to do with her."
"""Then came th' mystery. One night th' captain an' Mike Tullane disappeared. They was seen in th' cabin, talkin' together, an' some of th' hot-headed ones thought Mike was goin' back on his pals. They was for makin' him walk th' plank.""I mean that night he an' th' captain disappeared,"" Jack said. ""They couldn't be found anywhere. No boat was taken, so they couldn't have gotten off in one of them craft, an' we wasn't near enough land t' make swimmin' safe. But they totally disappeared, an' that was th' mystery. Whether they had a fight, an' jumped overboard together in th' darkness, no one ever knowed, for them mutineers didn't keep extra good watch.""But anyhow they was gone--mysteriously missin' as they say in the paper. That sort of took the heart out of some of th' mutineers and they got careless. First we knew a British vessel overhauled us, and, not likin' th' looks of things, began to ask questions. Of course there wasn't any captain, such as there should be on a ship, an' that made it look suspicious. Th' worst of it was that nobody could say where the captain was. None of us knew.""Then th' story of th' mutiny came out, of course, an' it was all up. The Britisher took charge of us. I was arrested as the ringleader of the mutiny, an' put in chains! An' I had no more to do with it than a baby, Miss. No more than a baby!"" and Jack Jepson looked from Ruth to Alice, his blue eyes expressing the indignation he had felt at the time. During the silence that followed the rather sudden ending of the old salt's story, Ruth and Alice looked at each other with wonder in their eyes. On all sides of them could be heard the clicking of the moving picture cameras, the loud directions issued by the men who were managing the different little dramas, and occasionally the sound of shots from the cowboy play that was going on in front of where our friends were seated on the bench, though at some distance away, for the studio was large.""That's all there is to any mystery, Miss,"" he said. ""A mystery is a mystery, an' if it isn't solved, it's a mystery still, an' nobody can make any more of it. Th' captain and Mike Tullane completely disappeared, an' were never heard of afterward. That's th' mystery, an' all there is to it, jest as I told you.""""Well, I escaped, Miss. It may not be a very nice thing to confess, but I escaped. Th' British ship took us to a jail on some island--I forget th' name of it. Anyhow I was locked up, an' so were a lot of th' others. We were tried, an' I was accused of startin' th' mutiny. Some of th' worst men on th' ship put th' blame on me, an' I wasn't a bit guilty. But it was no use in denyin' it. They was all banded together t' accuse me t' save themselves. I was found guilty, though I wasn't at all, an' I was sentenced to a long imprisonment. I just escaped hanging by a hair, for mutiny on th' high seas is a serious crime."
"""But I was innocent, an' I knew it, an' when I found th' trial goin' against me, I took a chance that offered, an' planned t' escape. I found a French vessel puttin' t' sea an' as they was short handed I signed on. Since then I've been in many vessels, but I always keep away from English ones, and from English ports, for I would be arrested the minute I set my foot on shore in one. A big reward is out for me.""""Not unless some of them involved was to confess, Miss. An' land knows where those fellers are now. They've disappeared with th' captain an' Mike Tullane. Of course if I could find either one of them, I could prove my innocence, an' then I'd be free t' go where I pleased. But I've about given _that_ up, Miss.""So I sort of come t' anchor in th' Sailors' Snug Harbor, an' when I heard about this movin' picture business, and th' chance it gave t' make a little money, I took it. But when it comes t' doin' some crime for it, I draws th' line. As I said, I've always lived honest, man and boy, for many years, an' that one charge is th' only one against me. I'm not goin' t' take them papers, and substitute false ones.""""But you don't exactly understand,"" Ruth said with a smile. ""I am going to explain it to you. Mr. Pertell said I might. Now here is the story we are supposed to act out; and, mind you, it is only _supposing_--make believe, as we children used to say.""""Not the least in the world,"" said Ruth. ""It is just a game, played for the amusement of the public. I'll explain,"" and from the typewritten scenario she held she went over the outlines of the big marine drama, as one of the authors of the Comet company had written it. As she gave the details, the simple, kindly face of the sailor cleared. His doubts vanished.""I'm not takin' any chances, Miss,"" was the answer. And though it might seem to an outsider that it would be safe, under those circumstances, for Jepson to visit British ports, if he kept away from the island where he had been imprisoned, he could not see it that way.""Well, how is the great marine drama coming on?"" he asked, his voice being more hoarse than usual. He had done some talking, as he found it helped to give a better idea of the characters he portrayed, but it was not necessary, in these picture plays, to get his voice ""over the footlights.""""No, no, Mr. Bunn, you must not do it that way,"" the manager was saying. ""When Ardite, in the character of the young outlaw, shoots at you, stand up without flinching. That's your part--to be indifferent to gunfire."""
"""Oh, that's my part, is it? Just to be shot at!"" cried the old ""Ham"" actor. ""Well, it's a mighty poor part, that's all I've got to say! It will be the last time I ever take a part like that. Oh, why did I ever leave the legitimate stage?""""Now Mr. Bunn, stand up and be shot at!"" commanded Mr. Pertell. ""Come, come! We can't lose all day on this little play. I've got to get busy on the marine drama, and I want some of you in that. Ready with that gun now, Paul!""""Yes, shoot him!"" murmured Mr. Pepper Sneed, the human grouch. ""Aim it right at him. Of course they are only blank cartridges,"" he added cheerfully, ""but if the wadding hits you Bunn, lockjaw is almost sure to follow. Go on and shoot. I know something will happen,"" and he looked as though he would be disappointed if his prophesy were not borne out. ""Go on, shoot!""""No, you'll not withdraw!"" cried Mr. Pertell. ""We've got half the film run off with you on, and you've got to stick it out. Go on, Paul. And, Mr. Sneed, you needn't trouble to stand here and look on, as you're not in this cast. You have a--depressing effect.""Mr. Sneed certainly did. However, he moved away, and the play went on. It was successfully filmed, and then Mr. Pertell was free to take up, where he had left off, the discussion of the preliminaries of the marine drama. ""Out on The Deep"" it was to be called.""I can save you the trouble,"" the manager went on. ""I'll outline it briefly for you. 'Out on the Deep,' is, as you can tell by the name, a marine story. Part of it will take place in a sailors' home. That will be the Snug Harbor, where I found Jack Jepson. We will go over to Staten Island some day and film those scenes."
"""Yes, a real schooner. It isn't a very good one, but it will answer our purpose, especially as we have to wreck her, and she will be a total loss. I had to pay pretty high for her, too. But I think it will be worth it. The shipwreck scenes, in the storm, ought to be great. And now, as I have decided to postpone the rehearsal of the play for a while, I think it would be a good plan for some of us to go and look at the _Mary Ellen_, and get familiar with her layout.""""That's just what I mean, sir! Oh, I forgot you don't know. But I told these young ladies about me being in a mutiny, an' I'm under suspicion in connection with it still. I can't go in an English port, and that's a nice blight to put on a man!"" he said indignantly.""That's it!"" cried Jack. ""If I could only find one of them, or if some of th' real mutineers would confess, it would clear me an' I could be free t' roam wherever I wanted t' in th' world. But it's too much t' hope for that. But you said th' name of th' vessel we was t' make believe be shipwrecked on was th' _Mary Ellen_, sir,"" and he turned to the manager. ""The _Mary Ellen_ was the name of the craft where the mutiny occurred. Could it be--"" he paused, hope showing on his eager face.""No, there's hardly a chance that this is the same one,"" said Mr. Pertell. ""_Mary Ellen_ is a common name for vessels,"" he went on, ""and there must be scores with it painted on their bows. I don't know anything about the vessel I have bought, but I doubt if she was ever in a mutiny. She is a very old craft, and isn't really fit for service now. But her owners say she will do for what I want. We are going to take her to Southern waters, and the main scenes of the drama will be photographed aboard her, and around her.""""Over in Erie Basin,"" answered the manager. ""I am having her fitted up, and a crew is being engaged. Of course it will be some time before we sail, but I want to get everything in readiness. So suppose we take a run over there now, and look at her.""""I don't like to ask you, Mr. DeVere,"" he said, ""to do anything that will be bad for your health. But I certainly need your services, and those of your daughters, in this sea drama. Otherwise I would not ask you to run any risks with your throat."
"""No, I think so myself,"" the old actor admitted. ""It may even do me good. I will doctor up in the meanwhile. And I realize that if I do not go, my daughters cannot. I would not like to have them miss this fine opportunity.""Mr. Pertell saw that the other plays under way in the studio were running smoothly, and then prepared to take Mr. DeVere, his daughters, and the old sailor over to Erie Basin, to inspect the _Mary Ellen_, as she lay in her slip, being refitted for another voyage--her last--for she was to rest beneath the waves when she had played her part in the moving picture play.""This is the fifth time we've done that act,"" Paul called to Alice in an aside as she passed. ""And all because Mr. Bunn is so fussy. They'll take him out, if he isn't careful. Where are you going, Alice?""The _Mary Ellen_ certainly did not present a very trim appearance as the little party went aboard her at the dock in Erie Basin. The decks were cluttered up with an assortment of ropes, planks, casks, boxes and other things, so that it was impossible to move about without great care. On coming in sight of the craft Jack Jepson's face wore a look of expectancy.""Yes, I know, Miss Alice. But, masts or no masts there's somethin' about this craft that's strangely familiar. I'm sure I've been on her before, and yet--no, it can't be--three masts can't make five, no matter how you count.""""Well, this is the ship,"" said Mr. Pertell to his guests. ""This will be our home when we get her fitted up in ship-shape. I don't know much about such things myself, so I've given Captain Brisco full charge. He is to get her in readiness.""""Why, Miss, this isn't anythin'--nothin' at all!"" cried Jack Jepson. ""With a few of my old shipmates I could get this craft ready for a voyage in half a day--that is, if she's all right below th' water line,"" he added as an afterthought.As they stood looking about the deck a man came up from below. From his appearance he was unmistakably a sailor, and one in authority. He issued several orders, on hearing which a number of men bestirred themselves, and then, catching sight of the little party, he called out in rough tones.""We are on a little tour of inspection,"" the manager went on. ""These are some of my principle moving picture actors, and I want them to get familiar with the ship. And, Captain Brisco, this is an old salt who will be with us. He is to be second mate, I believe. Jack Jepson, let me present you to Captain Brisco."""
"For an instant only did the commander of the _Mary Ellen_ show signs of perturbation. He recovered himself with an effort, hardly obvious to the moving picture girls who were watching. It was as though a cloud had passed over the sun so quickly as to give an observer no time to glance up and see it, before the shadow was gone. Then Captain Brisco smiled.""I think you've made a mistake, my man,"" he said, with the air of one used to commanding. ""I'm sure I don't know you, whether or not you think you have had the pleasure of my acquaintance. How about it?""""This is the sailor who will be one of your mates on our little trip,"" explained Mr. Pertell. ""You said you would need officers, even for a short voyage such as we intend making, so I picked up Jack Jepson. Do you think he'll do?""""Never mind now,"" interposed Captain Brisco. ""There are a thousand and one things to do, and nothing seems to be going right. Lay aloft there, some of you!"" he cried to a group of men. ""Get those halyards reeved and straightened out. Think we're going to lie here all Summer? Lively now! I think I could use you, if you've any knack of handling men,"" he added in lower tones, turning to Jack. ""It's slow work, getting fitted out.""""I could come any time,"" Jepson answered, and Alice noted that the old sailor gazed furtively now and then at the captain. It was as though he wanted to impress his memory with the face of the commander. ""I'm over in Sailors' Snug Harbor,"" Jepson went on, ""I came over to do some actin'----""""Yes, this play acting business is new to me, too,"" said Captain Brisco. ""But I suppose I can get used to it. Seems rather queer to go to all this work and expense,"" he went on to Mr. Pertell, ""just to fit a schooner out, and then sink her. It's a waste of good money, I should say.""""We'll get our money back, never fear, if the film turns out all right,"" said Mr. Pertell. ""Now how are you coming on? That's what I came to see. I want some of my principal actors to get familiar with the ship, so I brought them down. I started with Jepson, up in the studio,"" he added in a lower voice, for the benefit of Captain Brisco, ""but he balked, I'll tell you about it later. He can stay and help you if you like."""
"""Sort of funny thinking he knew you, wasn't it?"" commented Mr. Pertell, while Alice, Ruth and Mr. DeVere looked on with interest at the various activities connected with getting the _Mary Ellen_ ready for sea.""Oh, not at all queer,"" answered Captain Brisco, quickly. ""I have commanded so many men and ships in my day that I must be familiar by name, at least, to hundreds of sailors. But I never saw this Jepson before. However, he seems to be a good, honest soul.""And while the captain and manager sought a quiet corner, where they might converse, and go over the plot of the great marine drama, Alice and Ruth wandered about the ship. The sailors who were fitting her out looked curiously at the girls as they went to and fro. Mr. DeVere found a sheltered spot where he said he would wait until Mr. Pertell was finished with the captain.""Isn't it perfectly wonderful, to think we're going to be on board this schooner!"" exclaimed Alice to her sister. ""And are we going to sleep here and eat here, Jack?"" she asked, as the old sailor came toward them.""Well, Miss, if you goes on a voyage you can't walk off th' ship whenever you want to, you know, to get a berth, and some grub. I mean something to eat and a place to sleep,"" he quickly translated. ""You has to stay right on board until the voyage ends.""""No, sir,"" was the respectful answer. Jack seemed to have acquired new dignity since coming aboard; and it was noticeable, a little later, that he took more pains with his talk, being more grammatical, and pronouncing his words better, as befitted a mate.""This way,"" directed Jack, as he started for the companionway. Meanwhile Mr. Pertell and Captain Brisco having settled on certain details, called Mr. DeVere into consultation, since that actor was to have a prominent part in the scenes that would take place aboard the ship.Jack Jepson led his two pretty charges below, where some men were also at work. They inspected the sleeping quarters, the galley and other parts of the ship. Then, at the suggestion of Alice they penetrated to the men's quarters--the forecastle, or ""fo'cas'l,"" as Jack pronounced it, sailor-fashion.""Oh, nothin'--nothin'--,"" answered Jack Jepson. ""Only, oh, well, I s'pose it's all right,"" he went on. But as he led the way forward Ruth noticed a look of worriment on the face of the old sailor. It was so evident that it startled her--the more so as she heard him murmur: Ruth took advantage of the first opportunity to question Sailor Jack Jepson. The memory of that look on his face haunted her. But it was not until they had come from the _Mary Ellen_ that Ruth found her chance."
"While on board, arrangements had been made for taking some of the preliminary scenes of the marine drama, and Mr. Pertell urged Captain Brisco to hasten, as much as he could, the preparations for the voyage.""Wrong? No, Miss, not exactly wrong. But some of them fellers didn't seem to know their business in repairin' a ship, that was all. But we aren't goin' on much of a voyage, so I don't s'pose it matters--much.""""Oh, I believe I forgot to tell you people, but we are also to have a motorboat in connection with the _Mary Ellen_. A big, powerful gasoline craft, she is, called the _Ajax_. She'll follow us, part of the time, for some of the pictures have to be taken from a distance, as she trails along at the stern. We'll have plenty of time for rehearsal, though.""""Well, I didn't mean it,"" he said, though he spoke with an obvious effort. ""I meant it would be much more company--company for you folks as aren't used to sailin' the seas. That's all, Miss. Oh, no, there's no real danger--that is there won't be to _you_, as long as old Jack Jepson can ward it off,"" he murmured under his breath.The little party went back to the studio, and, after lunch, some of the easiest and less important scenes in the marine drama were rehearsed. Sailor Jack soon understood what was wanted of him, and did very well. Ruth and Alice took pleasure in coaching the honest, simple old salt. His too-conscientious scruples about doing a seemingly wrongful act were overcome when it was explained to him, and he went through the scene in the studio shipping office very well.""And that will be all you'll have to do for a few days,"" Manager Pertell told him. ""You will not be needed to take part in any scenes until we get ready for the second act. Meanwhile you had better arrange to stay aboard the _Mary Ellen_, while she is in the Erie Basin, and help Captain Brisco.""""That I will! Aye, aye, sir!"" exclaimed Jack. ""And it'll be a relief to be where I can feel the heave of a deck, even if the craft is anchored, and to smell the real salt water again. I'll go aboard as soon as I can get back to the Snug Harbor, and stow my dunnage in a bag.""Meanwhile there was hard work for the moving picture girls and Mr. DeVere. A company engaged in the making of films does not content itself with merely producing one big play. There are any number of small reels that are needed, as ""fillers."" Some of them are called ""split reels,"" meaning that there are two plays, or sketches, on each one. And in the intervals of going through scenes in ""Out on The Deep,"" or rehearsing for them, Ruth and Alice took part, with others of the Comet organization, in the making of many pictures."
"Several weeks went by in this way. Spring was gradually turning into Summer, to the delight of the girls, who loved the outdoors. Of course they loved Winter, too, for they had many outdoor scenes to take part in then, since snow effects are always easy to photograph.""And when we get out on the deep blue sea,"" the younger girl added, ""it will be ideal. Oh, I can hardly wait for the _Mary Ellen_ to start on her last voyage. Isn't it too bad she has to be sunk?"" she asked.Meanwhile work on refitting the schooner had gone on apace. The moving picture girls, and their friends, had paid several visits to her, and found Captain Brisco, Jack Jepson and the others hard at work making the vessel a semblance of her former self.Then came a day when many members of the theatrical company, including Jack Jepson, who now enjoyed that distinction, were taken down to the seacoast, some distance from New York. They went in a tug specially hired for the occasion.""Some of the scenes of the marine drama take place on the seacoast,"" explained Mr. Pertell. ""I want to get them now, when we have the chance. I need a rocky shore, and this is the nearest one we can reach. Get ready now. We have rehearsed these scenes, you remember.""Nor did Ruth and Alice have an easy time. They had to scramble over rocks, they had to escape from smugglers, they had to hide in caves, and once Alice had to fall down on the rocks, and pretend to be hurt. It was a very real fall, too, and she did not have to make much of a pretense at limping. ""Well, that's very good, so far,"" said Mr. Pertell, when there came a lull in the taking of the preliminary scenes of the marine film. ""A little more life wouldn't have hurt any, but the conditions aren't just the best. It was fairly well done.""""Huh! Fairly well done!"" exclaimed Pepper Sneed. ""I wonder what he wants, anyhow? I nearly broke my neck scrambling over those rocks, and the skin is all gone from the palms of my hands, and all he says is that it was 'fairly well done!' I wonder what he wants, anyhow?""""Ha! He vants dot you shouldt altogedder preak your neck, ain't it?"" put in Mr. Switzer. ""Dot vould be a real funny picture, alretty yet!"" he went on in his favorite character of a Dutch comedian. ""Preak your neck, Mr. Sneed, und let Russ make der picture."""
"""Ha! I think I see myself!"" exclaimed the ""grouch,"" as he looked for a seaweed-cushioned rock whereon to sit. ""There's been a lot of trouble today, but, mark my words, there'll be more before we have finished. That's all I've got to say,"" and by the sour look on his face anyone would have thought that he rejoiced in his prediction of trouble to come.""Oh, Pepper is sure the world is going to come to an end before the public has a chance to see him in his great rescue act of 'Out on The Deep,' I guess,"" replied Paul Ardite. ""Cheer up!"" he added. ""The worst is yet to come.""""Oh, Alice, are you hurt?"" asked Ruth quickly, as she saw her sister limping toward her, for the little scene in which Alice had slipped and hurt her ankle, had taken place when Ruth was busy in another part of the play, farther down the shore line.""Because you have some important parts yet to do,"" the manager continued. He was not as heartless as this sounds. Really he was most kind and considerate. Yet he knew the pictures must be made and the present was the best time. If there were a delay, there was no telling what might intervene.He knew that Alice herself realized this. She would not give up unless positively unable to go on. The general public little realizes how often those who entertain them do so under positive pain and suffering. Of course moving picture scenes can be postponed more easily than can those in a real theatre. But the general rule holds good for the movies, as for the legitimate. ""The show must go on!"" That is the watchword of manager and player alike. ""The show must go on!""""I have a bottle of arnica with me,"" said Mrs. Maguire, the ""old lady"" of the company. ""I heard we were to do some rock-scrambling today and I brought it along. I'll rub some of it on your ankle,"" she said to Alice.Behind a screen of rocks Mrs. Maguire removed Alice's shoe and stocking, and the motherly old lady and Ruth bathed the injured foot. It was not as bad as Alice had feared, and when it was bound up again she found she could use it by ""favoring"" it slightly. She would not have to take part in a scene for nearly an hour, and she took advantage of the rest afforded by the wait."
"Meanwhile Mr. DeVere and some other members of the company were going through their parts. An old fisherman's hut had been found, a little way down the beach, and for a small sum of money the grizzled old salt had agreed to vacate for the morning, and allow the moving picture actors to use his home as the background for several scenes.This is a secret of more than one film. The producer takes advantage of things as he finds them. Often, after a film has all been planned, and the pictures are being taken, a chance accident, or incident, will suggest an advantageous change, and it is made on the spot. Later the film is ""cut"" or added to, so that the change fits in.Again, on going to the outdoor scene called for in the scenario, the manager may see a background that suits him better than one he intended using. On the spot he will stop and have the act take place there, altering, or adapting, the plot of the story to fit. And many an accident has been turned to good account in making a film. But these are secrets known only to the initiated, and the public that sees the finished picture in some theatre little realizes how much chance had to do with its making.Scene after scene was ""filmed,"" Russ and his camera associates grinding away at the machines. It was not easy work, for the wind and spray often interfered with the clearness of the picture. But of course that only added to the reality of it when the finished picture was shown.""Now for that scene on the far rocks,"" called Mr. Pertell when he had brought to a satisfactory conclusion a difficult part of the drama. ""Are you able to go out there, Miss DeVere?"" and he looked anxiously at Alice.A ""close-up"" view, I might explain, is one taken with the person, or subject, very close to the camera, so that it appears very large--larger than usual. For instance, it might be necessary, in some play, to show a certain ring. The hand of the person, with the ring on the finger would be held close to the camera, so that the resultant picture on the screen would show every detail of the ring clearly. You have often seen such views in moving pictures, though you may not have known what they were technically called.The ""rock scene"" that was to be filmed now was to take place out on a little rocky group some distance from shore. It was reached by a long, narrow rocky ledge that curved out into the bay. Alice, Ruth and Paul were to be in this picture, and Russ would plant his camera on the rocky ledge, between the actors and the shore.""All ready,"" called Mr. Pertell, who, with a copy of the scenario in his hand stood back of Russ to direct matters. ""You are all supposed to be talking together, and then Paul discovers a sail out on the bay. You register surprise, Paul.""""Well, we'll have time enough,"" Mr. Pertell said, with a look at the sun, which is a sort of god to photographers. Without its beams little can be done. ""I'll go back and help you,"" said the manager who used to be an expert operator himself before he rose in the ranks.""All right. We'll stay here,"" announced Alice. ""I don't want to make that trip again with my lame ankle,"" and she sat down in a niche of the rocks. The others followed her example. The minutes passed quickly in pleasant talk, but presently Paul jumped to his feet. There was alarm in his action."
"""Oh dear!"" exclaimed Ruth. It seemed a silly, futile thing to say, but, perhaps, very natural under the circumstances. Ruth arose, and put her arms about her sister, who tottered a little as she stood upright.""It isn't that you would get wet,"" Paul answered. ""But the rocks were slippery enough as they were. Covered with water, as they now are between us and the shore, I'm afraid you'd slip off, especially as your ankle will give you a twinge if you twist it.""""But you might both slip in,"" objected Paul. ""And the water is quite deep on either side of this ledge of rocks. You see the ocean washes in against them, and scoops out the sand. So that there is a deep channel, ten feet or more, right alongside of the ledge of rocks. If you fell in there----""""They'll be back!"" Paul interrupted. ""Probably Mr. Pertell just thought of some scene he could get, and he took them off down the beach to put them all in it. They'll be back in a little while, and then we can signal to them.""""There will be no need of that,"" Paul said. ""They are sure to come back and see our plight soon. I can't see what's keeping Russ. He promised to come back as soon as he fixed up another camera. It's very strange.""Later they learned that when Russ and Mr. Pertell got back to the beach, leaving, as they supposed Ruth, her sister and Paul safe on the rocks, Pop Snooks, the veteran property man, discovered a certain nook that would answer for an important scene in the play. Wishing to take advantage of it at once, while the light was good, Mr. Pertell ordered the entire company over there to go through the prescribed ""business."" He took Russ and the two other camera operators with him, to make sure of getting at least one film.That is why the beach opposite the rocks where the three were marooned by the rising tide, was deserted just then. For the time both Mr. Pertell and Russ forgot their three friends, or, if they thought of them at all, it was to think that they were perfectly safe, and would come to no harm by waiting a bit.A few minutes later Russ and Jack had shoved out the fisherman's craft, and were quickly rowing toward the rocks. The tide was now so high that Paul and the two girls stood ankle-deep in the water that completely covered the rocks.There was very little that was not ""grist"" which came to the ""mill"" of Mr. Pertell's cameras. The film began to unreel and before they knew it Paul, Ruth and Alice were being depicted in the rescue scene, which, when it was projected on the screen, made a series of effective pictures."
"There was little real harm done save for wet feet and startled nerves. Sufficient harm, one might think, but Ruth and Alice were beginning to forget they had nerves, so many were the strange acts they were called upon to perform in their moving picture work.As the company had brought along several changes of costume, there were dry shoes for the three marooned ones, and then, as it was too late to finish the scene on the rocks, they went back to New York. Some other day would have to be devoted, at least in part, to completing that film.In the days that followed, work on the _Mary Ellen_ went on apace. She was almost ready for her voyage to sea. The big motorboat, _Ajax_, was also being put in readiness. While Jack Jepson and the others were busy at the schooner there were also busy scenes at the studio, where Mr. DeVere and his daughters took part in many film plays. Nearly all the studio scenes for ""Out on The Deep,"" had been completed.""But we must get that river attack before we start on the voyage,"" said Mr. Pertell one day. This ""river attack"" showed one phase of the big marine drama. Ruth and Alice, in company with Mr. Bunn, as an old 'longshoreman, were supposed to be rowed across a river to escape harbor thieves. To get good local color the location of the scene was fixed on the Jersey side of the Hudson river, above the Palisades. Thither those of the company required in the scene journeyed one day.All went well until the time when Mr. Bunn, rather against his will, was rowing Ruth and Alice toward shore. They were being pursued by some rough men in a second boat. It is needless to say that the ""rough men,"" were also moving picture actors.""Fine! That's fine!"" cried the enthusiastic manager, when suddenly, from a road that ran along the shore, there sprang a number of country officers. They had their clubs in one hand and had drawn their revolvers.""Surrender! Surrender!"" cried the leading officer to the ""villains,"" who were pursuing Mr. Bunn and the girls. ""Surrender! We've got you covered! We seen you chasin' these parties! Surrender!"" and the police rushed toward the actors. Just what idea the local police had in mind when they rushed forward would be hard to say. Evidently, however, they believed they were intent on rescuing the girls from some imminent peril, for the leader of the officers, showing not a little fear, even in the heroic role he was playing, fired a shot into the air, and cried:"
"""That's enough! Stop!"" called Mr. Pertell, and Ruth, Alice and the others who were making strenuous efforts (seemingly) to escape, came to a halt. Many times before they had heard that command which meant that something was going wrong, and that they might as well stop at once without wasting effort.""Oh, I thought they were part of the picture!"" exclaimed Ruth. And so she had. Often, to make a moving picture seem more realistic, a manager will not tell the actors all he has prepared. Thus he gets the element of surprise. Both Ruth and Alice, in this case, thought the local police had been brought into the scene at the last moment to add a touch of reality to the play. But, as it turned out, it was almost too much reality.""What do we mean? Ha! That's a good one! Listen to him, boys! What do we mean? Why we mean to arrest these scoundrels, and we've done it, too!"" he added proudly, with a wave of his hand toward the persons his men had made prisoners.""Mistake! Ha! I guess not!"" cried the officer. ""We don't make mistakes up here! One of my men seen something queer goin' on out in the river, and come and told me. Then I seen your boats puttin' off, and I knew something was wrong. So I got my forces together, and we waited for these fellows. We've got 'em, too! Every one of 'em!"" he added proudly. ""Lock 'em up, men!"" he ordered. ""We'll show these fellows what Jersey justice is like. Take 'em away."""
"""Wait! I'll explain!"" cried the manager. ""It's for the moving pictures!"" he added. ""This is only a pretended attack and pursuit. Ask the young ladies themselves,"" he said, motioning to Ruth and Alice who were now smiling. Certainly they did not seem to be in any great alarm or distress over their recent adventure. Their appearance must have caused the officer to doubt the wisdom of his course.""Why, the police. We could have them try to stop the pursuers but get worsted in the encounter, and the roughs could keep right on after the girls. In that way we won't have to waste much film. Just go on with the picture from the point where these policemen came in.""Whether it was this appeal to justice and fair play, or because he and his men were anxious to get into a moving picture, was not made clear; but the captain and the policemen consented to do their parts.""A little red! A little!"" fairly howled the grouch. ""Say it will be black and blue tomorrow. One of those policeman hit me in the eye with his elbow. It was an awful blow. I shouldn't wonder but that I went blind. Never again will I take part in anything as tough as this. I know I'll be laid up for a week,"" and with this gloomy thought he limped off, for he had been rather roughly handled in the m√™l√©e. ""Well, I think this will do,"" Mr. Pertell announced, as the members of his company gathered on the shore of the Hudson, ready to go back to the larger boat, whence they had come in the two small ones, to depict the pursuit. ""It came out better than I expected when I saw that crowd of policemen charging down on us.""""You had a little extra work, doing part of the scene over again, so we'll give you all a little bonus,"" said the manager. ""We'll get back to the studio now. There are a few scenes I want to make before we start off on our trip to sea.""""So she is,"" said Mr. Pertell, ""if she hadn't been, our company never could have afforded to buy her just to make a shipwreck of her. But she is perfectly safe for what traveling we shall do. Brisco has assured me of that, and has seen to it. What sort of a yarn was Jepson giving you?"" and Mr. Pertell seemed a bit annoyed."
"""No, oh, no! Nothing like that!"" exclaimed the actor quickly. ""I was just wondering about her. I shouldn't like to take any chances you know,"" and he glanced over toward his daughters who had no part in this conversation.In the days that followed there was plenty of work for the moving picture girls in the film studio. They had to take part in several little dramas that had to be completed before the sea scenes in the ocean play were undertaken.""No, not exactly to see her, though we could pay a visit if we liked. But you know we are to have a big motorboat follow us in the ocean scenes--I'm to take pictures from it, in fact--and that motorboat--the _Ajax_--is over in the Basin, near the old schooner. I thought maybe you'd like to take a look at her.""""I'm sorry we can't go for a trip in her,"" went on Russ, ""but she isn't in shape yet. I have to go over to give some directions about building a platform for setting the camera on, and I thought we might combine business and pleasure.""So, after lunch the four young people started for the place where the _Ajax_ was being overhauled, not far from the dock of the _Mary Ellen_. On the way they talked of their plans when they should be at sea. It had been given out at the studio that they would all go aboard the _Mary Ellen_, which would be headed for the Florida coast. Somewhere off that peninsula, just where had not been decided, the moving pictures would be made, and the shipwreck would take place. The details had not yet been perfected.""No, but speaking seriously,"" went on Russ, ""the _Ajax_ will be cradled on the deck of the schooner; that is, the motorboat will be set in two V shaped affairs, called cradles. That's to prevent her rolling off into the high seas.""""Well, you know we have to wait for a storm, to get some of the scenes,"" Russ said. ""Of course the weather often gets pretty bad in these Southern waters, in spite of their peaceful name,"" he continued, ""but I don't suppose Mr. Pertell will venture out far from the harbor in a bad blow. Even a little wind will kick up enough sea to make it look pretty rough in a picture.""""Not much, I guess. It's an old sort of tub, but pretty steady in the water, Mr. Pertell said. That's what I want for taking pictures. It won't do to have her rolling and pitching. Well, let's go aboard, and see how they're coming on.""The _Ajax_ was, as Russ had said, rather a tub, but it was a large, comfortable boat, and was capable of going on quite a cruise. There was a partially enclosed cabin, and many comforts and conveniences. But just for the present purpose, everything was being subordinated to the taking of moving pictures."
"""That's it, yes. You see I can't tell when I'll have to shift, to make allowances for what the actors and actresses will do. There's no telling about these moving picture people,"" and Russ gave Ruth and Alice, as well as Paul, a laughing look as though to indicate that they were very temperamental, and hard to get along with.Paul and Russ showed Ruth and Alice over the big motorboat, and then leaving the three to their own devices for a while, the young camera operator went into details of the work with the head mechanic. Russ was told that the _Ajax_ would be ready in plenty of time for him. He expressed himself as satisfied with the progress made, though he made one or two slight changes in the platform, built on the forward deck of the craft, where he was to stand when he took the pictures of the shipwreck.""It's Jack Jepson,"" whispered Alice to her companions. ""We'll give him a surprise. Keep quiet now. His back is toward me and I'll tiptoe up behind him and put my hands over his eyes. I'll make him guess who it is. He'll think some British suffragette has taken him on that silly charge of mutiny,"" she went on.The old sailor was evidently not aware that visitors were in the cabin, for they had made little noise in descending the companion stairs, and what little they had caused was drowned by the distant noise of carpenters' hammers.""It ought to be hereabouts, if it's anywhere, and I'm sure it is. I can't be mistaken. They have cut her down, and made a lot of changes, but they can't fool me. I was suspicious when I first came aboard, and I'm more so every minute. I'm going to find out for sure, while I have the chance. Let me think now.""He leaned up against a bulkhead, while Alice glanced back at her friends in some surprise. What meant the words they had overheard? The old sailor seemed strangely excited, and he was passing his hand over the paneling of the cabin as though in search of something long forgotten, or dimly remembered. Ruth, Alice, Paul and Russ remained silent and unseen witnesses of the little scene being enacted before them. It was like some section taken from a moving picture drama, though they could not guess what the plot was, nor what the outcome would be.""What are you doing here, Mr. Jepson?"" asked Captain Brisco, and there was sarcasm in the title he bestowed on his mate, for since he was third in command, having been given the post of second mate, the old salt was entitled to be called Mister.""I beg your pardon,"" Captain Brisco said, as the others stepped closer to Russ, so they could be discerned. ""I didn't know who it was. I am glad to see you. That's a paint-remover you smell. It is irritating. I am very glad to see you."""
"""Oh, yes, I'm to carry the _Ajax_ on deck, I believe,"" the commander said. ""Well, you'll find us all pretty busy here,"" he went on. ""Mr. Jepson, will you kindly go forward and see how the men are coming on with that caulking?""""He won't be on _my_ account,"" Captain Brisco assured the young operator. ""A few more details, and we'll be ready for sea. About time, too, for this good weather won't hold any too long down among those West Indian islands.""""There has been a slight change in the plans,"" the captain said. ""Mr. Pertell and I decided on it. I believe it is not generally known yet, but there is no secret about it. I told him he could get better results by going a little farther south than merely along the Florida coast, down toward some of the West Indies, and he agreed with me.""""The West Indies,"" mused Alice as she followed the others about the refinished schooner. ""I wonder if we will get near the 'Hole in the Wall' that Jack told about? I'd like to see it, but I suppose a hole in the water is a pretty hard thing to find.""Alice wondered whether she would see the old sailor before they went ashore again. She had taken quite a fancy to him, as had Ruth, and the old salt, on his part, seemed to like the moving picture girls more than any other members of the Comet Film Company.""I wonder what he was doing all alone there in the cabin?"" mused Alice as she hung back a little while the others were examining some changes that had been made in the dining-cabin. ""It seemed as though he were trying to discover some secret panel, a passage or hiding place, or something like that. And Captain Brisco certainly was rather brusque about it. I do hope there won't be any quarreling or mutiny aboard the _Mary Ellen_ when we put out to sea.""The _Mary Ellen_ was indeed assuming a ""ship-shape"" appearance. The litter that had obstructed her decks on the first visit had given place to a semblance of neatness. The craft had been newly painted and she glistened in the sun, her brass work having been highly polished.""A few more days and we'll pull out of here,"" announced Captain Brisco, as they went up on deck. ""Then I suppose you folks will begin to cut up all sorts of capers,"" and he smiled indulgently. He seemed to have recovered his good nature, or, rather, perhaps, to have summoned some of it to be used on this occasion.""You needn't bother to mend those valves,"" the commander said. ""We shan't need the pumps anyhow, and there's no use putting too much time and work on the old hulk. Pertell told me to get her ready for sea so she'd last a reasonable length of time. They're going to wreck her anyhow, you know."""
"""Let 'em go!"" the commander ordered. ""Now about those stays,"" and he and the sailor plunged into a mass of technical details in which the moving picture girls were not interested, nor, I am sure, would you be, my readers.In spite of all the work that had been done on the _Mary Ellen_, she was still far from being a fine ship. Many things were left undone, as they would not show in a picture. As the captain had said, Mr. Pertell was not desirous of putting too much time or expense on her, just to send her to the bottom after a few days' use. Still the craft had to be rendered seaworthy, as some views were to be taken showing her progress down the coast to the Florida Straits.""I was looking for Jack, to say good-bye. There he is over there,"" and she pointed to the old man polishing the brass work of the binnacle in front of the steering wheel. ""I'm going over and speak to him,"" she added.Jack Jepson had his back toward Alice, and was not aware of her approach. She heard him murmuring to himself, and the words sounded strange to her--as strange as the first ones she had overheard from him that day.Then he heard the footfall of Alice on the deck, and turned quickly. He smiled at her, and the smile was in strange contrast to his rather ominous words. As Alice knew very little about the sea or boats, she paid no attention.""Oh, well, nothing, Miss Alice. You wouldn't understand. I'm glad to see you. This isn't a mate's work, properly speakin',"" he said, as he indicated the box of polish, ""but then we haven't started discipline yet. We'll do that at sea.""A week later the entire moving picture company that was to take part in the marine drama assembled at the dock where the _Mary Ellen_ had been refitted for her last voyage. Stores and provisions had been put aboard, the _Ajax_ lay stowed in the cradle on deck, and the members of the company, the moving picture operators and the manager and his assistants, had sent their baggage aboard. There was plenty of extra film.The man flung himself on the gangplank which was separated from the dock by some little distance. He scrambled aboard, and just then, Alice, standing near Jack Jepson, heard the old sailor utter an exclamation of surprise, and murmur: Alice was so impressed with what she had heard sailor Jack say, that, in spite of the desire to give all her attention to the start of the voyage, destined to be so momentous, she looked first at Jepson and then at the new arrival. The latter appeared to be an ordinary sailor, but there was a commanding air about him, as though he were used to having his own way. But he was sufficiently subservient to Captain Brisco, saluting the commander in formal fashion.""He knows that man who just came aboard,"" decided Alice, ""and there is something queer about it all. In fact there is something queer about this vessel and Captain Brisco. I feel as though I were in the midst of a mystery. I'm going to see if I can't solve it."""
"That was Alice's way. She always did like to solve puzzles, from the time when she was a small child, and she went at this one in much the same way as had been her habit in the case of the simple ones in the juvenile papers she took when a little girl.""There's something between Captain Brisco, Jack Jepson and this new man,"" Alice decided. ""Jack is afraid of being recognized, and yet he wants to make sure who this new man is. Can it have anything to do with the mutiny, I wonder?""Ruth was some distance off, talking to her father. Mr. DeVere, in spite of the warmth of the day, had a light silk scarf about his throat, which had pained him during the night. The other members of the company were scattered about the schooner which was being towed out to sea. Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon were waving to some young men who had come to see them off. Mr. Wellington Bunn's face wore a glum look. Perhaps he saw no chance of doing anything with his favorite role of Hamlet in this marine story that was soon to be enacted.""I say there, Mr. Jepson,"" ordered the commander, ""will you go forward, and see how the bitts are standing up under the strain of that hawser? I don't want them to pull out, and they're none too strong. Lively now!""""And that is another queer part of it,"" mused Alice. ""That new man is supposed to be a common sailor--he must be, as all the offices, from captain down, are filled. And yet Captain Brisco treats him as an equal. I can't understand it.""None of the others of the moving picture company appeared to find anything odd in the reception of the man who had almost been left. In fact, save for Alice and Jack Jepson, no one paid any attention to him. As the captain and the new man whom he had addressed as ""Hen Lacomb"" went below, the attention of Alice was taken by Ruth.""Don't you think, dear,"" her sister said, ""that we had better get our possessions in order. I understand that some pictures are to be taken aboard the schooner here, and we will want to get our costumes out where we can easily reach them.""""What in the world are you talking about?"" asked Ruth in some surprise. ""Do you mean that young man who was waving to Miss Dixon?"" for a certain youth seemed very loath to bid farewell to the former variety actress.The schooner was well out from the dock now, and the pilot was in charge, so there was nothing for Captain Brisco to do for the present. He had gone to his cabin, and the stranger, or, rather, Hen Lacomb, to give him the name bestowed on him, was with the commander.""You must have some of your new roles on the brain,"" went on Ruth. ""I know I've been doing a lot of thinking over mine. They are nearly all nice ones, I'm glad to say, but I don't like the parts we have to take in the shipwreck. Fancy having actually to jump into the water."""
"The plan of the shipwreck included the jumping overboard of some of the company, and their rescue in small boats, or by the motorboat _Ajax_, that would follow, with Russ in it taking the moving pictures of the ""thrilling scenes.""Ruth and Alice had comfortable, if rather restricted, quarters in a small cabin containing two bunks. Their father was near them, and the other members of the company had rooms scattered about. The ship's crew, of course, berthed forward, and the two mates, of whom Jack Jepson was one, were quartered with the captain. Alice wondered what would be the standing of Hen Lacomb.She learned a little later when she saw him taking his bag ""aft."" That meant he was to be treated as an officer. There is all the difference in the world on a sailing ship, whether a man bunks ""forward"" or ""aft."" In the latter case he is either an officer or a passenger, and in the former case he is classed as a member of the crew, a ""foremast hand,"" and, as such, has no authority.""Hen Lacomb is evidently someone in power,"" decided Alice, though she said nothing to her sister or father, or even Jack. She managed to learn, by judicious questions, that Hen, as she began to think of him, was a friend of Captain Brisco, and a sort of passenger-helper on the _Mary Ellen_.In brief the plan was this. The schooner, under her own sail, would proceed to the warm West Indian waters and clime, and there, when suitable surroundings were found, the taking of the main scenes in the big drama would begin.I shall not weary you with an account of the trip down. In spite of her age, the schooner proved a good sailor, for she had been well refitted, even if she was to be wrecked. Day after day passed and the sun shone warmer as they came farther and farther south.They passed Key West, but did not dock, and kept on. Alice wondered if they would come near the ""Hole in the Wall,"" but she did not like to ask, for fear of making trouble for Jack. She did not know how much of his story he wanted known to those aboard the ship.It was a warm, sunny day, and Mr. Pertell had announced that he would begin some of the more important scenes of the drama in a short time. The _Mary Ellen_ was plowing through the blue waters, bending over under a good wind. Nearly all the members of the company were out on deck, under awnings. Alice saw Jack Jepson at some work on the port rail, and noticed Hen Lacomb and the captain stroll toward him. The two latter seemed to converse for a few minutes, when suddenly there was a heavy lurch and roll to the craft. Alice DeVere was not an ordinary sort of girl. She may have been, once, but that was before her advent in moving pictures. There had been times when a sudden emergency would cause her to feel faint, if not actually to succumb to that interesting ailment, which is so useful, especially in stories and books.But Alice, who was the nearest to the scene of what had just happened, neither fainted, nor became unduly excited. She had seen too many emergencies in the work of taking moving pictures to become ""rattled,"" which is not used in a slangy sense at all, but merely to indicate that one's nerves vibrate too rapidly. Consequently, after her first scream, Alice was almost as calm and collected as could be expected of a veteran sailor."
"Meanwhile Captain Brisco had bawled out an order to the helmsman to bring the ship up in the wind. A sailor had tossed overboard a life-ring, and then came to help Lacomb lower the boat, for Alice found it beyond her strength, eager as she was.""There aren't any around here!"" declared Russ. He did not know whether there were or not, but he said that to make the girls feel more comfortable. After all, if there were sharks, whatever he said would be of no effect, and it was better to take the best view of it, he thought.""Lower away!"" cried Hen Lacomb, and the boat went down to the water. Two sailors, beside himself, slid down the ropes into it, and took the oars. They cast off the davit blocks, and began rowing toward the bobbing head. Old Jack could swim well, it seemed, in spite of his age. The water was warm, and it was broad daylight, so he was in comparatively little danger--except from sharks and from the fact that he had on his clothes, which would soon become soaked and hamper him.But no sharks appeared; that menacing triangular fin which marks them was not seen cutting the water, and no big twelve-foot man-eater was observed to turn on his back in order to bring his curious, under-shot mouth with its rows of keen teeth to bear on poor Jack Jepson.If a shark had appeared, it would probably have put an end to the plans of Mr. Pertell to have his company give an idea of shipwreck by leaping into the water. No one would have jumped into those waters had they been shark-infested. But, as I have said, none of the tigers of the deep showed, and, a little later, Jack was being lifted into the small boat. They had reached him just when his strength was about exhausted.Miss Dixon looked angry and flounced back to her cabin with her chum. Jack and his rescuers were hoisted up in the boat, the other sailors hauling on the ropes, the blocks of which were hooked fast to rings in the bow and stern posts of the rowing craft.""Well, you tried to leave us rather suddenly,"" said Mr. Pertell. ""Don't go trying that again, Jack--at least until we finish making the pictures,"" he went on with a whimsical smile. ""You're in too many important scenes to be lost that way.""""Why, I was standing near the rail,"" Jack explained, ""talkin' to Mr. Lacomb, here,"" and he indicated the strange man, ""when, all at once the ship gives a lurch, and--well, I went over, that's all I guess,"" and he looked at Lacomb, as though to get him to confirm the account.""No one has said it was your fault,"" broke in the commander quickly. ""I was giving you a copy of the sailing orders for the day. I wouldn't have bothered you if I had known a puff of wind and a big wave were coming along together, to snatch the wheel out of your grip. But it wasn't your fault. However, no harm is done. You had better get below, Mr. Jepson, and put on some dry clothes. Mr. Lacomb will stand watch until you feel all right again."""
"""I was too much excited to think about that,"" Russ admitted. ""Besides, we are going to have plenty of rescue stuff in a few days, and this wasn't a particularly thrilling one. Poor old Jack! I wonder how it feels to fall overboard?""""Accidents will happen, but they don't always end so luckily,"" the captain went on. Jack Jepson had passed up on deck, and Alice, not feeling in the mood for talking, passed to her cabin. Captain Brisco, after a moment of hesitation, went up on deck again, and, had anyone observed him, they would have seen him in close conversation with Hen Lacomb. The two men spoke in low tones.Jack Jepson was soon himself again, and on duty as though nothing had happened. But he had created a very queer state of mind in Alice DeVere. Her suspicious were increased, and she asked herself a multitude of questions she could not answer. Nor dared she repeat them, even to her sister.""If he were tossed overboard, who did it?"" she asked herself. ""And why? The only one near him was Lacomb, and what object could he have in wanting to drown Jack? Oh, I can't understand it! I _must_ ask Jack what he meant.""That afternoon there began the taking of some of the more important scenes of the marine drama. These scenes were those that had to be filmed on the ship itself, and they kept everyone busy. Besides, Alice did not want to make too obvious an effort to talk to the old salt, as she feared Captain Brisco would become suspicious. There was a nameless mystery in the air that had its effect on Alice. Ruth noticed a difference in her sister, and questioned her about it, but Alice was able to say it was due to the difficult and exacting work of the new drama, and, in part, it was.Several days passed, and she had had no chance to speak to Jack. Each day was filled with work, or rehearsals, and some of the films had to be taken several times, due to the uncertain footing on the deck of the ship, which produced awkward motions on the part of the actors.""Well, I know something about the locality here,"" the old sailor answered, and he looked at Alice with a friendly wink. ""I shouldn't want to go ashore at the place where I escaped from after that mutiny,"" he went on. ""They might not want to let me go again.""""Sail ho!"" repeated Jack Jepson. ""Over there, Captain!"" and he pointed, and extended the telescope. Alice noticed that the hand of the old salt trembled, though usually he was as steady as the proverbial surgeon."
"""Yes, they want to take some of their pictures!"" It was evident to Alice, from the tone of voice in which Captain Brisco spoke, that he had little sympathy with the work of the film actors. But he had been hired to do his part with the ship, and must carry out his agreement with Mr. Pertell.The captain handed back the glass, and went to consult with the manager about making a landing. They were near several small islands, any one of which would probably do as a background for some of the picture-play scenes.""To prevent scurvy, Miss. Lime juice, potatoes or anything like that will keep sailors from the scurvy disease, Miss. They found it out, the Britishers did, and made their ships carry such stuff. Lime juice is easier to stow away than potatoes, and every sailor had to have his share.""Scurvy is a bad disease, Miss. It's terrible, and though lots of fun was made of the lime juice British ships, they done their duty, Miss. It got so other nations had to fall into line. And, though lime juice isn't as needful as it was, 'cause they have other things that do as well, perhaps, I always think of a Britisher as a lime-juicer.""""They might be, Miss,"" he said in a whisper, looking cautiously around. ""You see that charge isn't dead, and then there's the one of escapin' from an English prison. They might overlook the mutiny, especially as they may not have all their witnesses now--some of 'em may be dead. But an English prison officer never forgets, nor forgives, an escape, and the law doesn't either. If they was to see me, I'd be taken back to stand the charges ag'in me.""""I know Miss, but they might remember me, even if I have changed a lot. And this is mostly English waters around here. English islands, too. It was somewhere about here I was imprisoned. Before I set foot on land, I'm going to find out if it's English, and if it is, I'm goin' to stay on board. I'm not goin' to take any chances.""""Don't worry,"" advised Alice. ""There isn't one chance in a thousand that you would be recognized after these years. In the first place, you have changed a lot. And, in the second place, probably the English officers who arrested you, and the others, are in some other part of the world now. Why do you think they may be on that steamer?""""Well, things don't change down here as much as you might think,"" replied Jack, as he and Alice watched the steamer coming nearer. ""And an Englishman is less likely to change than anybody else, Miss. He'll often stay in the same berth until he dies. So it's likely some of the same officers who were around here when I was arrested are here yet. And they may be on that vessel."""
"--""Oh, yes, it's often done,"" the sailor assured her. ""This certainly was the old _Halcyon_, as she was called when the mutineers had her, and anyone who had sailed in her would know it. A sailor's eye can't be deceived. There's others on board as know it, too.""""Hush, Miss, if you please! Not so loud! Yes, others who were in the mutiny, but who got off scott free, while I was the one to suffer. But they're tryin' to keep under cover. There's a game afoot, but I'll spoil it if I can--that is, if this British steamer don't make trouble for me.""Alice's head seemed to swim. She was getting into the depths of the mystery now with a vengeance. What did it all mean? To what did Jack have reference? Could it be that Captain Brisco, and the man with whom he was so friendly, were in a plot?""I don't know how, but I'm sure they could,"" said Jack, rather unreasonably. ""And you mark my words. They'll see us and in spite of our change of rig, they will want to speak us. A sailor never forgets a ship. Of course there may be no officers on that steamer who would know the old _Halcyon_, but ag'in, there may be. I'm afeered, Miss.""As the _Mary Ellen_ lay almost motionless on the sea, for she had been brought up sharply, the steamer approached. It was so calm that she could come quite close without danger of a collision. A man, evidently an officer, hailed through a megaphone. Jack dared not desert his place as lookout.""_Mary Ellen_ ahoy!"" called the second officer. ""If you didn't used to be the _Halcyon_, I miss my guess. And there's a man aboard you I want! There he stands!"" and he pointed an accusing finger at Jack Jepson."
"""I won't!"" declared Captain Brisco, and for the moment the heart of Alice warmed to him. She fancied she had misjudged him. But as she looked at him, she saw a look on his face that made her doubt. It was a look that made his words seem insincere. And when the moving picture girl saw the captain speaking in an aside to Hen Lacomb, her doubts were redoubled.""This is a pretty how-d'-do!"" blustered Captain Brisco. ""They're going to leave me short-handed, and just at a time when I'm likely to need every man I can get, too,"" and he cast an anxious look around the horizon. It had suddenly become quite dark. A bank of clouds, slate colored, and fringed with an ominous yellow, had gathered in the west, and there was a moaning in the air as though a far-off wind were sending a message to those in peril to beware of its breath.The sea, too, had a glassy look. The big waves rose sullenly, and sank back into troughs, with an oily smooth motion as though they resented being thus confined. It was like the action of some raging beast in leash. There was a curious oppressiveness in the air, too, and more than one found difficulty in breathing.""It's those Britishers! They recognized this ship as the one on which the mutiny occurred. She's been built over--the ship I mean--but the steamer knew her--I mean some officer did. And they're going to take Jack away. You know he told us how he broke out of jail, after he was locked up on an unjust charge. Well, they want him for that, but he doesn't want him to go--at least he pretends he doesn't.""""But what does it all mean--that enmity you say Captain Brisco has against Jack?"" Ruth asked Alice, for Alice spoke about the time Jack had fallen overboard, and mentioned how the sailor had said he was tossed over the rail.""I don't know what it means,"" the younger girl replied. ""It is all queer and mysterious, and it's getting worse. But I think there is some secret between Captain Brisco and that Hen Lacomb that Jack has found out, and they're afraid he'll tell. That's why I think they would be glad to see him taken away--no matter what happened to him. It's all very well for Captain Brisco to say he doesn't want Jack to go, but I believe he's glad this happened.""Meanwhile Jack Jepson remained as lookout on the _Mary Ellen_, though there was no need of him there, for the schooner was now merely drifting, with sails aback, and the steamer, too, was at the call of the wind and currents.""Come on, mate!"" hoarsely whispered a sailor to Jack. ""Slip below, mate, and we'll hide you. If they try to take you, we'll stand 'em off. I don't like the Britishers anyhow. I was shanghaied into one of their lime-juicers once, an' I never forgot it! Slip below!"""
"""No, I'll take my medicine!"" said Jack grimly. ""Might as well get it done with. This thing has been hangin' over my head a number of years now, and I'll be glad to hear the last of it. It's a terrible thing for an innocent man.""""Perhaps some way may be found for clearing you,"" suggested Alice. ""I'll speak to my father. He knows some prominent lawyers in New York, and they will induce the government to take up your case. Go quietly, Jack, and we'll do all we can for you.""""Oh, pshaw! Perhaps it is!"" sighed her companion, and the two of them, who had been taking surreptitious glances in mirrors, enclosed in the flaps of their bags, ceased ""primping,"" until they could be sure whether or not there was any object in it.It did seem so, for there were no signs yet, of one being lowered over the side, though Captain Brisco, after the command to lay to, had ordered his accommodation ladder lowered to receive the visitors.""We won't send a boat right away. A hurricane is sweeping up fast, and this is a bad locality in which to be caught,"" called one of the steamer's officers through a megaphone. ""We'll have to get out of here, and so had you better. There's no sea-room here. We'll pick you up later, and don't forget you are in English waters, and subject to our orders. We're going to have that man!"" Events aboard the _Mary Ellen_ did not transpire at all slowly. In a comparatively short space of time she had been converted from an old hulk into a good sailing vessel, she had put to sea with a party of moving picture workers, including a sailor accused of mutiny, who had broken jail. She had been stopped by the English ship, and now the old schooner was starting to scud before the blast of a hurricane. For the time being the accusation against Jack Jepson was forgotten.""Lively now, everyone!"" cried Captain Brisco. ""When a storm breaks down here, it isn't any child's play. Double reefs in all sails, and two men at the wheel. Lash everything fast, pass life-lines, and passengers keep below.""The billows that had been rolling with oily smoothness now began to show little feathery crests of foam, and they were following one another with greater quickness, as if impatient to be at their shattering work.The wind seemed most ominous of all. It was as though it came from afar off, down behind the horizon line that showed black, with a fringe of angry yellow in the west. A low, mumbling, roaring, moaning wind it was, that whistled mournfully through the rigging of the schooner, and howled down the companionways."
"""And I just love a blow. I've never seen one at sea, and, as this may be the only chance I'll get, I'm not going to miss it. Stay up with me, Ruth. Don't be like those sillies, and go below,"" and she motioned to Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon who were scurrying for cover, as the wind and the sea increased.""Oh, don't be nervous!"" broke in Alice. ""Here, I'll ask Mr. Blake,"" and she stopped the first mate who was hurrying to and fro directing the men at their work of making everything snug below and aloft.""I--I think so,"" he said. ""Yes, surely,"" he added quickly. ""We will ride out the storm, never fear. It hasn't gotten here yet, and we may only get the outer edge of it. But you must excuse me now,"" and he hastened along the deck.""Yes, but look at that!"" and the older sister pointed to the west. There had been a rapid change. There was more yellow in the clouds now and less blackness, though there was enough of that ominous color too. ""Doesn't it scare you, Alice?""""All right, I'll have the boat over at once,"" and the commander gave the necessary orders for lowering the _Ajax_ over the side. This had been provided for when she was cradled, so there was little delay at this task.""No, you are just to stand around on deck, and look a bit anxious. You are supposed to be an old-time passenger packet you know, on a long voyage, and you are running away from the storm. We don't want many feet of this film--just enough to indicate what is to come. The real shipwreck--that is the imitation of it--will come later, when this storm blows over. Get on the side where the motorboat will be,"" the manager directed, ""and line up along the rail.""While Russ was ""loading"" his camera, Ruth and Alice watched the sailors getting the _Ajax_ ready. The engine had been tested, and seemed to work well. Jack Jepson came along with a small keg of water, and a bundle done up in a piece of sail cloth.""It's a rule of th' sea,"" said old Jack, ""never to put a boat over the side without provisioning and watering her. You never can tell what will happen on th' ocean. I've seen boats put out just for a little row around, and a fog would come up, and they'd be away nearly a week. And when they didn't have any water or food aboard--well, Miss, them's not nice things to talk about to ladies,"" he said simply. And Alice understood."
"""Nonsense!"" the manager ejaculated. ""There's no danger! You are going only a short distance away from the schooner, to get some views of her as she rides the waves. It will make a good film, the coming storm, and the waters rising and falling. Get aboard, Mr. Sneed, and do whatever Russ wants you to. He'll be busy with the camera so you will have to steer, and run the engine. The last won't bother you though, for it has a self-starter on and a gear clutch. You'll be in no danger.""Mr. Sneed did not seem anxious to go. However, orders were orders, and members of the company, even Mr. Wellington Bunn, thought twice before refusing Mr. Pertell. So, when Russ came up with his cameras, bringing two in case of emergency, Mr. Sneed was already in the boat, which was rising and falling at the foot of the accommodation ladder over the side of the schooner.""Let her go, Pepper!"" called Russ to his actor-helper and the motor whirred, as the _Ajax_ started away from the side of the schooner. Russ, setting his camera up on the platform made for it in the bow, began grinding at the crank, taking many views of the pitching, tossing schooner as it rose and fell on the bosom of the heaving ocean.""Something sure _will_, if you don't keep her headed up into the seas,"" declared Russ. ""We'll be swamped, that's what will happen. Steady now. I'm getting some good ones,"" and he worked away at the camera, while the schooner sailed farther and farther away. Russ wanted to give the idea of distance on the film.""Oh, not much longer now,"" was the answer. ""I have about all they'll want, I guess. This is only a sort of 'cut-in' effect, anyhow--a preliminary to the grand performance that is to come later. Poor old _Mary Ellen_, we'll soon see the last of her, I expect.""""Well, it won't be for long,"" Russ said. ""It will be all over in a few minutes--I mean the shipwreck proper, though there'll be a lot of rescue scenes, and then the castaways on an island, and all that sort of thing. Put me over a little more to the left, Pepper. I can get a fine view that way, with the light shining on the passengers at the rail.""""It does look as though it were going to burst,"" Russ agreed, as he looked up from the ""finder"" of his machine long enough to take a glimpse at the weather. ""Mr. Pertell said he'd signal us with a flag when he thought we had enough, but I don't see anything of a signal, do you?"""
"""No,"" answered the gloomy actor, who had not been needed in the present scenes. ""And I wish I _could_ see it. It's getting too rough out here for me, even if we have a good boat,"" and he adjusted the gasoline feed to give a little more power to the engine.""Well, it's getting almost too dark to get any more pictures, anyhow,"" Russ declared. ""We sure are in for a blow. It's coming up fast too. We'd better get back to the ship without waiting for a signal. They may have hoisted one, that we didn't see.""""Humph! You're away off!"" declared his companion. ""The last I saw her, and I was headed right for her, she was over there,"" and he indicated a direction differing from that Russ had shown by at least forty-five degrees.The motorboat _Ajax_ was chugging over the heaving water at good speed, but as far as the eyes of either of her occupants could see, she might have been driving straight into the utter desolation of a vast ocean, for not an object was in sight.The wind had again taken up that nerve-racking moaning and groaning sound, as of an unseen giant in distress, and the spray from the crests of the waves blew in the faces of the two young men, as they crouched down behind the shelter of the half-cabin.It seemed as though the storm had begun, had halted in its purpose, or had gone off momentarily in some other direction, and was now headed back, to sweep destruction down on those aboard the _Mary Ellen_, and the two in the motorboat.That was a question Russ and Mr. Sneed asked of themselves over and over again as they drove into the very teeth of the storm. They had to head into it, as in the small boat no other course would have been safe. Fortunately the _Ajax_ was built dory-fashion, with high bow and stern, after the pattern of the skiffs in which the fishermen of the New Foundland banks go out in heavy weather.""What are you going to do?"" asked Mr. Sneed, as Russ increased the speed of the engine, so that the small craft fairly tore up the inclined hills of green waters, which the waves represented, and slid down them with sickening speed on the other slope.Russ agreed to this, and, standing up, so their voices would carry better, and bracing themselves against the tumbling, swaying motion of the craft, they sent out a cry for aid--and yet not so much a cry for aid, as they were not yet in distress, but a cry for direction.""If I could only see where to steer,"" Russ exclaimed, when they had paused in their yelling, well-nigh exhausted, ""it wouldn't be so bad! But I can't see a thing. It's getting darker every minute. I never saw such a funny storm.""""That's it!"" Russ cried. ""Why didn't I think of that before? She's running away from us. She can't help it, though, for she must scud before this storm. We've got to increase our speed to catch up to her. The wind and our engine ought to be more than a match for her sails alone. I'll put on more speed."""
"The speakers were Alice and Ruth DeVere respectively, and they were leaning over the rail of the _Mary Ellen_, peering off into the swirl of driving mists, and across the heaving waters toward where the motorboat had been last seen.""Yes, I think Russ has enough pictures,"" Mr. Pertell said in answer to the remark of Alice. ""I think you all looked sufficiently distressful. If the scenes of the shipwreck itself go as well as the first part of the drama has gone, we'll have a fine film.""But just then, when there was a partial calm before another burst of fury on the part of the storm, something occurred that threw the ship into a flurry of excitement for a time. The sailors were making some changes in the craft's canvas, when suddenly the throat and peak halyards of the mainsail either parted, or, coming loose from the cleats, came down on the run. The effect was to lower the sail so quickly, and in such a fashion, with the wind blowing hard against it, that there was a crash, a banging and booming of the canvas, and the boom and gaff. The first mate, who was standing near the mast, was knocked down, narrowly escaping going overboard.""Up with her now! Up with her!"" the second mate cried, as he gave orders for hoisting the sail again, for the schooner was not under proper control with the main canvas down, and a storm coming up rapidly. The sail had been reefed, so the gaff had not fallen as far as otherwise would have been the case.""What's the matter?"" shouted Captain Brisco who came up from his cabin with Hen Lacomb. The two were seldom apart of late. A glance served to tell the commander what had happened. He saw that Jack Jepson had matters well in hand, and though Alice guessed that Captain Brisco had no love for his second mate, the commander knew seamanship when he saw it.""But the motorboat!"" cried Ruth, who had conquered her desire to flee to the cabin, and hide her eyes and ears from such nerve-racking sights and sounds. ""Where is the _Ajax_--and Mr. Sneed--and--Russ?"" she faltered.""But we _must_ wait for him!"" Ruth cried, getting excited. ""We can't go off and leave them in that motorboat, on the ocean, in a storm! We must wait!"" She started toward Captain Brisco, with her hands held out appealingly.She knew enough about the technical side of moving pictures to realize that for some time, it had been too dark to take any film. Russ must have known that, too, and would have started back for the schooner. But if he had, where was he now?"
"""Look here!"" cried Captain Brisco. ""You are the owner of this schooner, it is true, and as such you are my superior, but the law gives me supreme command of this craft at sea, unless I'm dead, or otherwise deposed. And I tell you I won't risk all these lives by trying to beat back in the teeth of this wind, to pick up a motorboat. It would be worse than criminal--worse than wicked to do it. It would endanger all on board!""""I'm doing all I can,"" Captain Brisco replied. ""I'll shorten sail down to the minimum; that will keep us before the wind, and out of the trough of the sea! More I can't do. We must depend on them to pick us up. They ought to be able to do it. You told me Dalwood could manage a boat."" Confusion on board a ship in a storm may be real confusion and riot, or it may only seem so to those not used to the sea. Often what is a hopelessly tangled mass of sails, ropes, spars and gears to the landsman, is as clear to a sailor as a skein of yarn is to an experienced knitter, who can ply her needles in the dark.There was a tangle of ropes, a banging and slamming of canvas, which, stretched taut and to its utmost, was as stiff as a board. There was a rattling of blocks and the creaking of the boom-crotches against the masts. The squeak of the gaffs higher up added to the din.""Lower away! Lower away!"" the commander cried, ordering even the already doubly-reefed sails gotten down, so the powerful wind would have less resistance. Even with the small area of canvas shown, the craft was being heeled over until the scuppers--or the holes by which water runs off the deck--dipped under the waves, and there was plenty of sea aboard.""Set that storm jib!"" came the next order, when the main sails had been furled, and that was no easy task with the sharp pitching and tossing of the schooner. Not a very seamanlike job was made of it, but there was no time for the finer touches. The sails were just clewed up to prevent them from blowing away, until more time could be devoted to them.The storm jib, which is the sail furthest front on a vessel, unless it be a flying jib, was set to give her enough way so she would respond to the helm, for it was necessary to keep the craft before the wind, and head on to the seas--that is, the big waves must be cut and broken by the sharp prow, or bow, for had they come at the schooner sideways, she would have been swamped instantly.Even the small area of the storm jib was hardly necessary. The _Mary Ellen_, in that blow, would have scudded along fairly well ""under bare poles,"" that is with no sails set at all. Even Captain Brisco had his doubts about the storm jib resisting. It might pull away from the holding ropes at any moment. But its loss would do no harm, for it would only be blown out to sea, and there were enough spare sails."
"So, as I have said, order came out of confusion, but even the order was somewhat confused, at least to the members of the moving picture company. They had been ordered below, and had managed, somehow, to get there, though more than one received bumps and bruises on the pitching, tossing companionway.It seemed quieter up on deck now, for the sailors had ceased rushing about adjusting the canvas, though there was still plenty of noise. There was the rattle and bang of blocks, the whipping about of ends of ropes, the slap, now and then, of the storm jib, as it was whipped back and forth. Now and then a heavy sea would fall on deck with a crash.""Well, there won't be any emergency--at least not for a while,"" the commander said grimly ""We are doing very well. If you want to be uncomfortable do so, and put on those cork jackets. But there is no need of it. I'll give you plenty of warning if the ship is likely to founder, and we'll lower the boats.""""Well, of course there always is, in a storm at sea. But we are in no more danger than hundreds of others. This is a wooden ship, and it will be a long time sinking, even if it gets to that point, which is far off. We haven't leaked a drop yet, and we're running before the storm nicely. You need have no fears.""""Not now, at least,"" the captain replied. ""I have done everything possible, and the only thing now is to run before the storm. We are in good shape. The _Mary Ellen_ is a better craft than I gave her credit for being. The only thing to do is to wait, and hope for the best.""""Yes, enough for all hands. They are provisioned and watered, and are staunch craft. My men have orders to stand by in case of any real danger, and put the small boats over. But we will stick to the ship until the last, though that is not saying, mind you, that we will have to desert her.""""But I could do nothing else,"" resumed Captain Brisco. ""As I told you, a vessel can't remain stationary on the sea. We had to move on before the gale. And, as I also said, the motorboat has a better chance of going where she wants to than have we, who must depend on our sails. I have no doubt but that the two in the _Ajax_ are safe.""With the racing of the engine, indicating to Russ that the propeller had dropped off into the sea, he at once shut off the power. Without the resistance of the screw the machine would soon have racked itself to pieces."
"The storm which at that moment was enveloping the _Mary Ellen_ was, at the same time, buffeting about the smaller motorboat. When she lost headway by the stopping of her engine she no longer took the seas head, or bow, on. She fell into the trough, and was in imminent danger of being swamped.But when the storm grew worse, and the tiny craft was buffeted about, shipping considerable water, even stout-hearted Russ was not as hopeful as he had been. He had stowed the camera in a safe place, and put the films in a water-tight box well forward. Then the only thing to do was to wait. In vain he scanned the sea through the storm for a sight of the schooner. He could catch no glimpse of her.The storm was constantly growing worse. As old Jack had said, the schooner had actually been caught in the very vortex of it, but the whirling motion, imparted by the meeting of two different wind currents, had been the saving of the craft. She had been shunted to the outer edge, as a cork, going around in a whirlpool, is sometimes tossed to safety by the very violence of the motion.All that night they scudded before the storm, not knowing where they were, and when morning came there was a wild and tumultuous waste of waters all about them. Alice ventured up on deck, against the advice of her father and sister.As she came near the mainmast, there was a sudden veer to the craft, a snapping, splintering sound, and the mast, with its gear of sail, boom and gaff crashed over the side, smashing the stout bulwarks.""You shouldn't have come up!"" he shouted in her ear, as he fairly carried her along the sloping deck. He had to shout to be heard above the roar of the wind, the pounding of the broken mast against the side of the schooner, and the swish of the salt water whipped into spray by the powerful gale.Jack set Alice down at the head of the companionway, and indicated by gestures, rather than words, that she was to go below. As she descended the sloping stairs, holding to the rope rail to prevent stumbling, she saw Captain Brisco spring forward. Whatever else he was, the commander did not shrink from any emergency.He and several other sailors had seized axes as soon as the result of the crash was seen, and now sprang to the broken bulwarks, over which the mainmast lay, the jagged end of it in the water, pounding against the side of the schooner at every roll, and threatening to punch a hole in her as a battering ram punctures a wall.""Strike hard, men!"" called Jack, and the sound of their axes followed. Ropes were severed with a blow, but the wire shrouds were tougher, and it was not until several minutes had passed that the mast, with its tangle of sails and ropes, was chopped free to float away on the crest of a billow.Pausing only for a moment, the sailors who had labored so valiantly at cutting loose the broken mast, sprang to get more sail on the craft. She was deprived of the reefed, or shortened, one that had been on the stick which was now overboard, and the jib was not enough to hold her head to the waves.Alice really did not know whether there was any danger or not from the fall of the mast. She had often read of such things happening, and she remembered that the masts were always ""cut away."" So she supposed, as long as this was being done, that the proper course was being followed.""Oh, yes, of course!"" Paul exclaimed. ""Not enough glue on it--Oh yes!"" and he had to turn away to keep from smiling at the idea of a mast,--that is the most firmly set of anything on a ship, (being indeed almost an integral part of it)--the idea of that being stayed with glue was enough to make almost anyone smile, even in the midst of danger."
"The sounds on the deck gradually became more quiet. The danger seemed to be over for the time being. The moving picture actors and actresses crowded around Alice to hear her story of the accident. She carefully avoided mentioning her own peril, but she resolved to properly thank old Jack later. Just now Alice did not want her father to worry. His throat was troubling him, because of the amount of salt spray in the air.On deck Captain Brisco and Jack Jepson took charge of matters until the wreckage had been cleared away. And a lot of wreckage there was. The _Mary Ellen_ looked little like the trim, schooner that had left New York a few weeks before.As the day advanced, the storm lulled slightly, but it was still rough. Those of the moving picture company who ventured up on deck went below again with white, scared faces at the sight of the wreckage of the mainmast. For it did look doleful.Then when a great wave struck the craft, washing over her from stem to stern, the work of the ocean and the storm elements seemed completed. The _Mary Ellen_ staggered under the blow like some living thing, and she did not rise to it as buoyantly as she had before. Jack Jepson was a brave man. He proved it then by standing unflinchingly in front of the angry captain, when shrinking back might have meant a blow that would have brought about a general fight. Seeing him standing there fearlessly, made Captain Brisco pause. And that gave the others time for action.""I never started a mutiny before, and I'm not trying to do so now!"" retorted Jack, and he seemed to have lost much of his timid simplicity. ""I tell you the ship is sinking, and we had best take to the boats while there is time.""""You know what I mean,"" replied Jack, and there was significance in his voice. ""I won't say anything about putting to sea in a ship that wasn't fit--with masts that were nothin' but dry rot, and with pumps that only half work at best. And I won't say anything about your plot--there isn't time now. But I will say----""""Look here!"" stormed Captain Brisco, and his voice was almost in keeping with the howl of the gale all about them, and almost as raucous as the salty spray that flew over everything. ""Look here! Who is captain of this ship?""""Then if I'm captain, I'm going to be obeyed!"" came next. ""I order you below, Jepson. You're no longer mate of this craft. You're deposed! Hen Lacomb, I hereby appoint you first mate until my regular one recovers, and you, Hankinson, you're second mate. Lively now. Jepson, go below, and if he makes any more trouble, Hen, clap him in irons,"" he added significantly."
"""Father, won't you say something! Mr. Pertell, you're not going to permit this, are you? I'm sure Jack Jepson is honest and that he is faithfully warning us. Don't let him be put down this way. Ask him what he means by a plot!""""Ask him?"" cried the old salt, pointing an accusing finger at the captain. ""Ask him, and if he doesn't tell you, I will. Talk about a mutiny! It wouldn't be half as bad as his plot for getting possession of this vessel.""""Yes, you and Hen Lacomb!"" cried Jack, who seemed to have acquired a new boldness. ""I charge you with plotting to make a fizzle of the shipwreck these picture people planned. You were going to pretend the vessel was sinking, before the time set for the pictures, and you were going to get them to abandon the schooner. Then you and Lacomb were going to come back to the ship later, take her to some secret port, fit her out again and use her for your own purposes.""That's the plot! That's what I overheard you and Lacomb plannin', and when you suspected I knew, you thought I'd be better off in the sea. That's how I happened to go overboard. I was thrown! That's what I charge you with. Deny it if ye dare!"" and he pointed an accusing finger at the two men. ""You threw me overboard, Hen Lacomb! And Captain Brisco planned to have you do it!""""Yes, and I have the proof!"" cried Jack. ""Here's the agreement you made Lacomb sign. You were afraid to trust to him unless he made a promise in writing, and here it is. I found it in the secret compartment in your cabin. Your cabin that used to be mine in the old _Mary Ellen_. That's how I made sure this ship was the old one I used to serve on, made over. I found this agreement! It's the proof of what I say. Deny it if you can."""
"""Why--why--"" stammered the captain. ""Do you dare--"" but it seemed he could not get any farther. He glanced at Hen Lacomb who stood near him. A meaning look passed between the two men, and Hen started edging around toward Jack Jepson.""And I say she has a hole stove in her, an' unless it's stopped we'll be at the bottom in a few hours!"" cried Jack. ""The mast knocked a hole in her and she's takin' water fast. The pumps are no good, but they can be fixed with a little work on 'em.""""Jack, take charge,"" said Mr. Pertell. ""Select as mates whoever you want. We'll go into this matter of the plot later. Just now we must save the ship if we can. Everything must give way to that. Do you accept?""""Oh, noddings dit happen,"" was the reply. ""It iss only vat might haf happenet. He vas getting so close by Jack dot Jack might fall ofer board again, und ve don't vant to lose our new captain so soon yet,"" explained Mr. Switzer cheerfully.He thus made light of the affair, but later it came out that Hen Lacomb had evidently had the intention of at least trying to pitch Jack overboard, as the easiest solution of the trouble of Captain Brisco and his crony.""This is enough!"" cried Mr. Pertell. ""Jack, you're captain. Do what you like to insure the safety of us and the ship. Captain Brisco is no longer in command of this vessel,"" the manager went on to a wondering group of sailors. ""I call for three cheers for Captain Jack Jepson!""""We've got to try to stop that leak first of all!"" said Jack, as he carefully put in his pocket the paper he had claimed was an agreement between Brisco and his crony. ""I appoint Jim West as first mate and Frank Snyder as second!"" the new captain went on. ""Come below, you two, and we'll see what we can do. We've got to mend the pumps. Keep her about as she is,"" he ordered the steersman."
"And so it proved--at least the _Mary Ellen_ was not doomed to go to the bottom at once. The storm still raged with seemingly unabated violence, but the sailors, under the direction of Captain Jepson, got a heavy piece of canvas over the worst leak, and then the repaired pumps kept the water in the hold down to a normal level.The failure of the pumps to work, until Jack and the men fixed them was due to criminal negligence on the part of Brisco. He put to sea with this necessary part of a ship in poor condition, not thinking they would be needed.Brisco was a desperate man, and so was Lacomb. They had been involved in more than one shady transaction, and though both may have been aboard with Jack, during the mutiny, they successfully covered their tracks.Brisco and Lacomb sulked below, and, for the time being, no effort was made to bring them up and set them to work, though every hand was needed. Some of the members of the film company turned in and helped. It was thought better not to incite a fight.The sea anchor which Russ had rigged provided the necessary drag and steerage way, and the boat's head was kept to the waves. Her high bow, and covered fore-part, enabled her to ride seas that would have swamped another craft of like size. And her dory-build added to her safety. The bank fishermen know well how to shape a boat to meet heavy seas.If any of you know anything about motor-boats, you know that the shaft which passes through the stuffing box, and to which shaft the propeller is fastened, is joined to the shaft of the engine by a coupling, or sleeve. If you take two lead pencils, and thrust an end of each into each end of a hollow, brass pencil holder, you will get an idea of what I mean. One pencil will represent the shaft to which the propeller is fastened, and the other the engine shaft. The brass holder is the coupling, or sleeve. In order that the shafts will be held rigidly together, turning at the same time, set screws in the sleeve are tightly turned down on the shaft, binding both in the sleeve.It was the set screws on the propeller shaft that had loosed, allowing the sleeve to slip uselessly around, that had caused all the trouble. With a wrench Russ tightened the screws. He tested them, and, finding them firm, started the engine. A moment later the _Ajax_ was moving over the waves under her own power.On and on she rushed. Hour after hour passed, but the gale showed no signs of abating. The two young men were weary and disheartened, when, as there came a little rift in the clouds Russ, who stood up to look about, gave a yell. Russ had been running the motor at moderate speed, for he did not know just how long the supply of gasoline would last, and he did not know as yet what might be before him and his companion in distress. But the sight of the steamer gave him hope, and he turned on full speed.The _Ajax_ was a powerful craft, though even a mighty steamer would not have found it easy to make headway in that sea and in that gale. The motor craft responded gallantly, and shot up on the crest of each wave, sliding down the opposite side as though she were going to investigate the uttermost depths of Father Neptune's caverns.""You will when we both come on top of a wave at the same time,"" was the answer. ""You see we lie so low in the water she can't see us, and we can't glimpse her until we're both on a crest together. She's off to the east there. Watch and you'll see her. Look now!"""
"At that moment the _Ajax_ rose on a mighty wave, which lifted her high toward the sky, in which were now rifted clouds. Mr. Sneed glanced to where Russ pointed, and saw the long, black hull of a steamer, from whose stacks belched forth clouds of smoke, showing that her engines were being driven at top speed to overcome the storm.""I meant to. I really did. I'm sorry!"" the other exclaimed, contritely enough. Really he was a different sort of Mr. Sneed from the ""human grouch"" who often made matters so unpleasant for members of the Comet Film Company. Since he and Russ had so nearly faced death, Mr. Sneed was much braver and more cheerful.""That's what I'm going to do, if we can get to her,"" Russ said. ""It's going to be nip and tuck, for she's going fast and she won't see us, as we're so low in the water. She's not heading in our direction, either, but I'll go after her on a long slant, and maybe I can reach her, or get near enough to make her see us. This is a pretty fast boat.""They were speeding over the waves, now down in a hollow, and again on the crest. Sometimes they would lose sight of the steamer altogether, and again they would catch a fleeting glimpse of her. And, when they did, she seemed farther off than ever.In spite of their brave front, Russ and his companion were sufficiently miserable. Their boat constantly shipped water, and they had to use the hand force pump, which, fortunately, was in the craft. A pump was connected with the cylinder cooling apparatus, designed to free the cockpit of bilge water, but the pump would not work.Russ and Mr. Sneed were wet through, for the cabin could not be entirely closed against the spray. And they had nothing to eat except cold victuals. There was a gasoline stove aboard, but there was nothing to cook, for only an emergency ration had been put in the craft, and that was more because of a whim on the part of Jack Jepson, than because he really thought it would be needed.But more than once as they drank of the water, and nibbled the hard biscuits, or crackers, in the water-tight box, Russ and his companion blessed the forethought of honest Jack Jepson--I beg his pardon, Captain Jepson it was now, though neither Russ nor Mr. Sneed knew that.More than once, as they urged their craft on a long slant toward the steamer, they almost gave up hope. But it sprang up again, and finally, as a break in the clouds let out a little rift of light, someone on the watch aboard the steamer saw the fluttering signal.It did not prove to be the English steamer. Instead it was a powerful fruiter, hailing from New York, and Russ and Mr. Sneed were soon aboard, the _Ajax_ being hoisted to her deck. Then she resumed her course, but it was a different one.So the search began. It lasted three days, during which the storm nearly blew itself out. And on the morning of the fourth day, when the sullen sea was trying to calm itself, and when the wind had died down to a moderate gale, the lookout of the _Sirius_ called out:"
"Instantly there was commotion and excitement on board the _Sirius_, for Russ and Mr. Sneed had told their story of the starting out to make a pictured shipwreck, which shipwreck had evidently, now, become real.A little later, the _Sirius_ stood by. And high time, too. As a last resort, when it was found that the repaired pumps could not keep the water down in the hold, so big was the leak, the signal of distress had been hoisted. And, after many anxious hours, it had been thus providentially answered.Then a thought came to Mr. Pertell. The weather had cleared. The schooner would keep afloat a few hours more. Why not make the pictures of the shipwreck now? It would be his only chance. True, they would not be just as planned, but they would be better than losing all the efforts that had been made.It was rather an exciting time, the passengers dropping overboard from the sinking schooner, and being rescued in boats. Russ, on board the _Ajax_, which was again put into the sea, worked the camera. The _Mary Ellen_ made a more realistic wreck than had been hoped for. Former Captain Brisco and Hen Lacomb, alone, refused to take any part in the drama.""There she goes!"" said Alice softly, as, with a final lurch, and a blowing up of her decks, from the compressed air under them, the old craft, bow first went beneath the waves. Russ took the final pictures.On his first trip to the schooner, Jack had recognized Brisco as an unscrupulous man who had been engaged in several shady ship transactions. But Brisco denied his identity, and Jack pretended to have been mistaken, in order to throw him off his guard. Brisco was also, Jack said, one of the mutineers of the _Halcyon_, but the plotter denied this, and Jack admitted he may have been mistaken.Then came the advent of Hen Lacomb, whom Jepson recognized as a fellow plotter with Brisco. The evil men knew him, too, after a bit, but they counted on the charge of mutiny hanging over him to make him keep quiet, and not reveal their plot.Brisco and Lacomb plotted to get the schooner for themselves. They were not really going to endanger the lives of the passengers or crew, but their game was to only pretend to sink the ship, and to raise such an alarm that she would be hastily abandoned. Then they would come back to her later, salvage her, and use her for their own ends.Jack Jepson had overheard this plot, and, as he had said, found the incriminating document signed by Lacomb. This was hidden in a secret compartment in what had formerly been his bunk, when the schooner was the _Halcyon_.When Brisco and Lacomb discovered that Jepson knew their secret, they tried to get rid of him, by a seeming accident. But Fate interfered with their plans, and the storm made a big change. Then came the deposing of Captain Brisco, and the rest of the story is known to my readers."
