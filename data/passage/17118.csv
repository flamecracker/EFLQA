passage
"Half a score of actors and actresses moved quickly to their appointed places, while overhead, and at the sides of them hissed powerful electric lights, and in front of them stood a moving picture camera, ready to be operated by a pleasant-faced young man.""Begin!"" called the manager, sharply, and the play proceeded, while the young moving picture operator clicked away at the handle of his camera, the long strip of film moving behind the lens with a whirring sound, and registering views of the pantomime of the actors and actresses at the rate of sixteen a second.""Where are we going next?"" asked the elderly actor before mentioned. He spoke in very hoarse voice, and it was evident that he had some throat affection. In fact, it was the ailment which had forced him to give up acting in the ""legitimate,"" and take to the ""movies.""""We are going to Florida--the land of the palms!"" announced the manager. ""You know I spoke of tentative plans for a drama down there when we were in the backwoods. Now I have everything arranged, and we will leave on a steamer for St. Augustine one week from to-day.""""One moment, if you please!"" interrupted a middle-aged actor whose face seemed to indicate that he lived more on vinegar than on the milk of human kindness. ""We are not _all_ going, if you please, Mr. Pertell.""""Do you call alligators lovely?"" asked Mr. Pepper Sneed, who was known as ""the actor with the grouch."" He was always finding fault. ""Lovely alligators!"" he sneered. ""If you want to go to Florida, and be eaten by an alligator--go. I'll not!""""Now look here!"" exclaimed Mr. Pertell. ""That's all nonsense. We are going where there are no alligators; but I'll pay anyone who is injured in the slightest by one of the saurians a thousand dollars!""""Oh, yes, plenty of time, Mr. Towne,"" answered Mr. Pertell. Claude Towne was a new member of the company, rather a ""dudish"" sort of chap, and not, as yet, very well liked. He dressed in what he considered the ""height of fashion.""The week that followed was a busy one for every member of the Comet Film Company. Not that they were required to do much acting in front of the camera; for, after the outdoor scenes in connection with the current play were made, Russ Dalwood, the operator, packed up his belongings ready for the Florida trip."
"The others were doing the same thing, and Mr. Pertell was kept busy arranging for transportation, and hotel accommodations, and for the taking care of such films as he would send back from the interior of Florida, since none would be developed there. This work would have to be done, and positives printed for the projecting machines, in New York. This custom was generally followed when the company went out of town.The moving picture company were gathered together in one place on the deck, and they waved to other members of the company who were not to make the trip, for Mr. Pertell employed a large number of actors, and only a comparatively few of them were going to Florida. The others would continue to work in New York.The steamer moved slowly away from the dock, in charge of a fussy tug, but presently she began forging ahead under her own steam, moving slowly at first. Soon, however, the vessel was well down the harbor.Alice and Ruth DeVere, with Russ Dalwood and Paul Ardite, were standing amidships, on the port side, looking down into the water. A little in advance of them stood Mr. Towne and Miss Pennington. The latter had been much in the new actor's company of late.The mirth of Miss Dixon and Miss Pennington seemed to increase rather than diminish, and Mr. Towne was now fairly roaring with merriment. He laughed so hard, in fact, that he coughed, and leaned back against the rail for support.And then something happened. Just how no one could explain, but Mr. Towne went overboard, his arms and legs wildly waving, and his cane flying far out into the river. He struck the water with a splash, just as one of the deckhands yelled:Wild and excited were the cries that followed the accident. Russ and Paul were among the first to act, the former getting a life preserver from one of the racks, while Paul caught up one of the round, white life rings and tossed it far out toward a commotion in the water that indicated where Mr. Towne had disappeared. They had to throw the articles toward the stern of the steamer, as she was in motion, and Mr. Towne was soon some distance astern.The initial volume was entitled ""The Moving Picture Girls; Or, First Appearances in Photo Dramas."" In that was related how Hosmer DeVere, a talented actor, suddenly lost his voice, through the return of a former throat ailment. He was unable to go in his part in a legitimate drama, and, through the suggestion of Russ Dalwood, who lived in the same apartment house with the DeVeres, in New York, Mr. DeVere took up moving picture acting.His two daughters, Ruth, aged seventeen, and Alice, aged fifteen, also became engaged in the work, and later they were instrumental in doing Russ Dalwood a great service in connection with a valuable patent he had evolved for a moving picture machine.The second volume was called ""The Moving Picture Girls at Oak Farm; Or, Queer Happenings While Taking Rural Plays."" In that book was told how the acquaintance was made of Sandy Apgar, who ran a farm in New Jersey. As Mr. Pertell was looking for some country scenes to use in connection with his moving picture dramas, he took his entire company out to Oak Farm, hiring it from the Apgars.""The Moving Picture Girls Snowbound; Or, The Proof on the Film,"" was the title of the third book. As its name indicates, the girls and other members of the company were really snowbound. After the summer at Oak Farm, and the fall spent in New York, Mr. Pertell decided to make some dramas in the backwoods of New England, where there was much snow and ice. And for a time there was almost too much snow, for Elk Lodge, where the company of players was housed, was almost buried by a blizzard.Before going to the backwoods, Mr. DeVere had been much annoyed, and alarmed, by an unjust demand, and how a certain illegal suit against an electric car company was called off, through a discovery made by Ruth and Alice, you may read of in the book."
"Many beautiful films were made at Elk Lodge, and some wonderful pictures of snow and ice scenes resulted from the trip to the backwoods. Then the company returned to New York, and now we find them _en route_ for Florida, when the accident to Mr. Towne occurred.Mr. DeVere and his two daughters lived in the Fenmore Apartment house, in New York City. Across the hall lived Mrs. Sarah Dalwood, and her sons, Russ and Billy, the latter aged about twelve. The Dalwoods and the DeVeres became very friendly, and Russ thought there never was a girl like Ruth. Paul Ardite, the younger leading man of the Comet Film Company, thought the same thing of Alice.Frank Pertell was the manager and chief owner of the film company. He had a large studio in New York, where all indoor scenes of the plays were enacted, and where the films were made for rental to the various chains of moving picture theaters throughout the country.Wellington Bunn and Pepper Sneed were the ones who made the most trouble for the manager. Mr. Bunn was an former Shakespearean actor. With his tall hat and frock coat--which costume he was seldom without--Mr. Bunn was a typical tragedian of the old school.Mr. Sneed was different. He had no particular ambition toward stardom, but he disliked hard work, and he was rather superstitious. Then, too, he was always looking for trouble and often finding it. In short, he was the ""grouch"" of the company.Mrs. Margaret Maguire was a motherly member of the troupe. She played ""old woman"" parts with real feeling, perhaps the more so as her two grandchildren, Tommy and Nellie, were dependent upon her. The youngsters usually went with the company, and were taken on the Florida trip. Occasionally they acted small parts.Pearl Pennington and Laura Dixon were former vaudeville actresses who had gone into the ""movies."" Some said it was because they failed to longer draw on the stage. Whether or not this was so, it was certain that the two had very large ideas of their own abilities. They cared little for Ruth and Alice, and the latter had few interests in common with Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon. Paul Ardite has been mentioned. With the exception of Mr. Towne the players had been associated together for some time.""That's good,"" declared Alice. She had not turned her head away as had her sister. In fact, in spite of being two years younger than Ruth, Alice often showed more spirit. She was of an impulsive nature, and Mr. DeVere used to say she was very like her dead mother. Ruth was tall and fair, and of a romantic nature. Alice was more practical."
"This order was given by one of the officers as the boat containing the rescued actor came close to the ship's side. The sailors stood ready to hoist the boat to the davits again, when the tackle blocks should have been made fast by the hooks to the ring bolts at bow and stern.""There, I guess that will do,"" remarked Russ, as he saw that there was no more film left in the camera. ""Now, Mr. Pertell, you'll have to get some story written around these scenes. Add more to them, and you'll have a good reel.""""What for?"" asked Mr. Pertell, in surprise. ""I haven't seen them, of course--can't until they're developed, and that won't be for some time. But I should say the rescue pictures would make a fine film.""""Do you suppose for one instant--er, ah--that I am going to let the public see me like this?"" and Mr. Towne glanced at his wet and dripping garments--garments that, but a short time ago, had been a walking testimonial of the tailor's art. Now they were wet and misshapen.""Why, you can't expect a man who has just been rescued from New York Bay to look as though he came out of a band-box; can you, dear man?"" asked Mr. Pertell. ""Of course you look wet--the public will expect to see you wet--dripping with water, in fact. Water always comes out well in the movies, anyhow. Of course the public wants to see you wet!""""But I don't want them to!"" protested the actor. ""I have never been shown in pictures except when I was well dressed, and I do not propose to begin now. I will pose for you as soon as I get dry clothes on, but not in--these!"" and he made a despairing motion toward his ruined garments.""I can sympathize with you, my dear fellow,"" murmured Mr. Bunn, who was as careful of his dignity, in a way, as was the other. ""They have made me do the most idiotic things in some of the dramas,"" the older man went on. ""I have had to play fireman, and ride in donkey carts, slide down hill and all such foolishness--all to the great detriment of my dignity.""""Yes, this moving picture business is horrid,"" agreed Mr. Towne, who was dripping water at every step. ""But what is a chap to do? I tried the other sort of drama--on the stage, you know; but I did not seem to have the temperament for it.""The excitement caused by the mishap to Mr. Towne soon subsided. The steamer got on her way again, once the small boat had been hoisted up, and several tugs and motor craft that had gathered to give aid, if needed, went on their courses."
"Ruth and Alice had done much traveling with their father when he was engaged in the legitimate drama, for he was with a number of road companies, that went from place to place. Water journeys were, however, rather a novelty to them, and now that the excitement of the rescue was over they went about the ship, looking at the various sights.The _Tarsus_ was not a big vessel, but it was a new and substantial craft engaged in the coast trade. A fairly large passenger list was carried and, as this was the winter season, many tourists were heading for the sunny South--the warm beaches of the coast, or the interior where the palms waved their graceful branches in the orange-scented breezes.""Much better, I think,"" he said. His voice was always hoarse now, totally unlike the vibrant tones in which he was used to speak his lines. ""The pain seems less. I have hopes that the warm air of Florida may improve, and even cure it, in connection with the medicine I am taking.""""I might,"" he replied with a smile at her; ""but I do not know that I would. I am beginning to like this silent 'drama.' It is a rest from the hard work we old actors used to have to do. There is much less strain. And if I went back to the legitimate, I would have to take you with me,"" he added.""Assuredly, they have been a great blessing to us,"" observed Ruth, quietly. ""I do not know what we would have done without them, when you were stricken the second time,"" and she looked fondly at her father. She thought of the dark days, not so far back, when troubles seemed multiplying, when there was no money, and when debts pressed. Now all seemed sunshine.""Yes, it would be a poor return to the movies, to desert them after all they did for us,"" agreed Mr. DeVere. ""That is, as long as they care for us--those audiences who sit in the dark and watch us play our little parts on the lighted canvas. A queer proceeding--very queer.Down the bay, out through the Narrows and so on out to sea passed the _Tarsus_, carrying the moving picture players. The day was cold, and a storm threatened, but soon the frigid winter of the North would be left behind. This was a comforting thought to all, though Alice declared that she liked cold weather best.Mr. Towne came up on deck, again faultlessly attired. His unexpected bath had not harmed him, in spite of the fact that it was cold, for he had at once taken warm drinks, and been put to bed, for a time, in hot blankets.""Why here's an item from some place in Florida. It says that two girls went out in a motor boat, to gather specimens of rare swamp flowers, and have not been heard of since. It is feared they may have been upset and drowned, or that alligators attacked them. Oh, how dreadful!""""I don't imagine it could be,"" reasoned Alice. ""They did not look like girls who would be bold enough to go off after swamp blooms. But think of the poor girls, whoever they are, out all alone at night, with maybe alligators around their boat! Oh, I hope we don't have to go too far into the wilds."""
"Ruth sat for some moments in silence after she had read in the paper the short account of the missing girls. She had come to a pause in arranging her luxuriant hair for the night and, with it only half combed, leaned back in the small chair the stateroom afforded. Alice was reclining on her berth.""Look after yourself, my dear. With your hair down that way, and that sweet and innocent look on your face, and in your eyes--you are much more in need of looking after than I. Someone is sure to fall in love with you, and then--""Ruth could not but smile, though the serious look did not leave her face. She was very like her father. The least little matter out of the ordinary affected him, and usually on the sad, instead of on the ""glad"" side. He, like Ruth, was of a romantic type, inclined to anticipate too much. Alice was more matter of fact, not to say frivolous, though she could be very sensible at times.""I know you didn't, and it was mean of me to talk that way,"" and a plump, bare arm stole around the other's neck, while a hand was run through the golden hair. ""But, don't let's think so much about them. Perhaps they are not those two girls we met, after all.""""Not necessarily. Maybe it's only an unfounded rumor. Russ says newspaper men often 'plant' a story like this off in some obscure place, and then use it as the basis for one of those lurid stories in the Sunday supplements.""I shouldn't wonder a bit but what this was one of those cases. So, sister mine, go to sleep in peace, and in the morning you'll have forgotten all about it. Only don't let's tell any one, for some of the company, like Mr. Sneed, might make trouble for Mr. Pertell, saying alligators were there.""""I've always wanted an alligator bag, and I never could afford it. Now's my chance. But we may never get far enough into the interior for that. By the way, where did it say those girls started from? I didn't half read it.""""Hardly!"" laughed Alice. ""Hand me that cold cream, please, the salt air has chapped my face. Oh, say, did you notice how much color Laura had on to-day? If ever there was a 'hand-made' complexion hers was!"""
"""Can't! Daddy has the stateroom on one side, and Mr. Pertell the other, and they're both sound sleepers. But I've finished anyhow. You put out the light,"" and with a bound, having completed her toilette, Alice was in her berth.In order that there might be no trouble among the members of the moving picture company over the statement made in the newspaper that perhaps the two girls had fallen victims to alligators, Ruth, next morning, carefully cut out the item, and put it away among her things.They breakfasted in their staterooms, but it was noticed that the trays came out about as well filled as they went in, from which it might be gathered that they were not altogether free from the toll the sea exacts from most travelers.""My, how charming you look!"" observed Paul to Alice as he joined her on deck, and arranged her steamer chair out of the wind. She had on a new jacket, and a little toque, the brown fur of which matched her eyes, and brought out, in contrast, the damask of her cheeks.""I'm glad you appreciate her,"" Alice said. Really, Ruth made a picture, for she had on a long white cloak, and with a turban trimmed with ermine, and her fair hair and blue eyes, she looked like some Siberian princess, if they have princesses there, and I suppose they must.In the afternoon, while Ruth and Alice were reclining luxuriously in their steamer chairs, they observed one of the officers come up from below, and run toward the bridge. There was something in his manner that startled Alice, and she sat up suddenly, exclaiming:She did not finish, for another officer came on the run from forward, and he, too, sought the bridge. Then the two girls saw curling up from one of the hatchways on the lower forward deck, a little wisp of smoke, and immediately afterward there sounded through the ship the clanging of bells. Panics start so easily, especially at the mere mention of the word ""fire,"" that it is no wonder there was at once an incipient one aboard the _Tarsus_. But the captain, who was a veteran, acted promptly and efficiently.Some of the sailors had made a rush for the boats, but the captain, coming down from the bridge on the run, flung himself in front of the excited men. He pushed one or two of them aside so violently that they fell to the deck. Then the commander, in a voice that rang out above the startled calls, cried out:""Now get back to your places--every one of you!"" he ordered the sailors. ""You ought to be ashamed of yourselves, to leave your mates to answer the fire call alone,"" and he pointed to where a number of hands were about the hatchway, from which smoke was still coming. But the wind was taking it away from the ship now, which was the reason why the vessel had been turned around.Nearly all the passengers were now gathered on deck, as were most of the sailors, but the latter were engaged in fighting the fire through the forward hatchway. Those who were not needed at that particular place were at the other fire stations, in readiness for any emergency.The _Tarsus_ now lay motionless on the ocean, rolling to and fro slowly under the influence of a gentle swell. There was scarcely any wind, and the smoke, which had constantly grown thicker and blacker, even with the efforts made to subdue the flames, arose in a straight pillar of cloud.""I mean just what I say!"" went on the commander, and there was no mistaking his sincerity. ""There is no danger--at present,"" he continued. ""There is a slight fire among the cargo in one of the small forward holds. But it is cut off from the rest of the ship by fire-proof doors, and we are flooding that compartment. The fire will be out shortly, I expect."
"""So there is absolutely no need of taking to the boats. Later on, if there should be, I will give you ample warning, and I might add that we carry a sufficient complement of boats and life rafts to accommodate all. And should we take to the boats, the weather is in our favor. So you see you should not worry.""""The fire cannot possibly get beyond control before morning, even if it is not put out,"" the captain replied. ""So there will be no need of boats in the night. Even if there were, we have powerful searchlights, and each boat carries her own storage battery lighting plant. Now, please be reasonable.""""I am glad you did not,"" returned the captain, gravely. ""I would not have an audience see what cowards some of my men were to so far forget themselves. That is better forgotten. Doubtless they were mad with fear. But I am glad you did not get that picture.""There was some relaxation of the tension following the captain's little speech, but even yet there were serious faces among the passengers, as the volume of smoke seemed to grow instead of diminish. Captain Falcon, too, was observed to be laboring under a strain.""Oh, I think so,"" answered Paul, quickly. ""He would have no object in deceiving us, and let matters go so long that it would be necessary to take a risk in getting to the boats. If he did that he might be censured by the owners. I think he really believes there is no danger. And when he thinks otherwise he will give us ample warning.""They looked in and saw the operator with the telephone receivers on his ears, while with nervous fingers he pressed the key that made and broke the circuit, thus sending out from the wire aerials between the masts the dots and dashes that, flying through the air, were received on other aerials and translated from meaningless clicks into words fraught with meaning.""Yes,"" nodded the commander. And while the vivid blue spark shot from the revolving wheel to the connection, where it was made and interrupted as the operator pressed the key, or allowed it to spring up, Russ made a short film. The young man who was sending a message looked up as he finished and smiled at the group observing him.The fighting of the fire still went on, though little of it could be observed now. There were no flames to be seen, but doubtless, down in the hold, where the cargo burned, there were angry, red tongues of fire. But the compartment was kept closed. It was now nearly full of water, the captain reported, and the fire must soon be extinguished.Dinner was not a very cheerful meal, but all managed to eat something. And the night was an uneasy one. What sleep there was came only in catnaps, for there was the constant noise of the pumps, and the running about of the sailors on the decks."
"The _Tarsus_ was still motionless, save only as she rolled with the sea, which was still calm. Captain Falcon found that to proceed would be to drive the smoke aft into the cabins, and he did not want to do this. So he had the main engines shut down.""Not necessarily,"" the captain replied. ""I have come to put the matter plainly to you. The fire gained, in the night, and it reached the engine room compartment. We are, therefore, temporarily disabled, and cannot proceed, as we could have done had not this occurred. For we had the first blaze out.""Thank you!"" exclaimed the commander, evidently greatly pleased with this mark of confidence. ""At the same time I stand ready to lower boats for those who may wish it. The sea is comparatively calm, and you will have to use boats anyhow, if you are taken off by the _Bell_.""""By wireless. I was only waiting for your decision to write out the message. She has been expecting a call from us, but she has probably drifted farther off than she was last evening. I will summon her.""A little later the wireless began crackling out its call to the unseen _Bell_, and preparations were made to lower away the boats promptly, in case the fire should suddenly gain greater headway. Then there was nothing to do but wait, and fight the flames.""Let them go,"" decided Captain Falcon, in a low voice to the moving picture manager. ""I can send them away in a boat, with some sailors, and tell my men to row slowly, so as not to take them too far away from us. Then, when the _Bell_ comes up, they can go aboard her, if our fire is not out by then. Let them go.""""There's no danger; you'll be saved more by staying here than by going with them,"" said Mr. Pertell. ""Besides, you might soil your clothing if you went in the small boat. Another ship is coming for us.""""She's coming!"" cried the operator, as he gave the dispatch to the captain. Russ, who had enough of the pictures of Mr. Bunn and Mr. Sneed leaving in the boat, filmed the captain in the act of receiving this message of good cheer. Later it was worked into a stirring drama, called ""The Burning Ship.""With all else that was going on, the work of fighting the blaze in the hold was not for a moment given up. Water and live steam were turned in among the cargo, the pumping apparatus fortunately not having been disabled when the rest of the machinery went out of commission."
"""Oh, but they look so small, and they hold so little. How can one get enough to eat in them?"" asked Miss Dixon, clasping her hands, and looking with her rather effective eyes, first at Mr. Towne, and then at Paul.""Ha! You dakes along vot you eat!"" exclaimed the German. ""Pretzels iss fine! Haf one!"" and he extended a handful of small ones. Since the company had been snowbound he had always a few in his pocket. He called them his ""mascots.""""Let's go see if there is any further report by wireless from the _Bell_,"" suggested Ruth, who saw kindling wrath in the eyes of her sister. Alice never could get along well with the two actresses, and she was very likely to say something that might lead to a quarrel.""So will I,"" echoed Mr. Towne. In spite of his affected mannerisms, he could be ""nice,"" at times. It was Ruth who had said this, but then Ruth had such a kind heart that she generally found a good quality in nearly everyone, whatever their failings.""Don't be alarmed!"" Captain Falcon exhorted them, but, even as he spoke, there came a second dull rumbling, a trembling of the vessel, and another explosion, louder than the first. There were screams from frightened women and children, and a number of men passengers made a rush for the boats, as the sailors had done before. ""Stand back!"" cried Captain Falcon, and again his hand went to his pocket as though to draw a weapon. ""Stand back! The same rule applies to you men passengers as to the sailors. Women and children first! Do you hear? Stand back!""""But they are not,"" the commander insisted. ""They are only slight explosions of coal gas in some of the bunkers. The fire is slowly eating into them but the explosions are not heavy enough to cause any serious damage to the ship.""The _Bell_ will soon be up to us. In fact, we could see her now, were it not for the slight haze. And, as it is evident that you will have to be taken off in her, I am going to lower the boats, and let you row away from this ship."
"""You will be picked up by the _Bell_ as soon as she gets here, and, in any event, you would have to take to the small boats. So you might as well start. I will have all your baggage brought on deck ready for transfer,"" he added to the moving picture manager.""I am going to stick by the ship!"" he answered, and there was a proud ring in his voice. ""I believe I can save her, and then we'll make repairs, and get to port under our own steam. I want to save the owners salvage, if I can.""The work of getting the passengers and their baggage into the boats was soon under way. There was some confusion, not a little evidence of fright on the part of many, and some tears. But among the bravest were little Tommie and Nellie. They thought it all a lark, and probably, in their case, it was the bliss of ignorance.Then the young operator busied himself with making a film that was afterward said to be one of the best in the world showing a rescue from a burning ship. And the beauty of it was that it was real. There was no posing, and the ship was not an old hulk chartered for the occasion, and set fire to, as has been done more than once.As the women and children were first helped to the boats, and the craft then carefully lowered to the sea, Russ took picture after picture. Fortunately the sea and weather were both calm, and, after the first little fright, no one made any disturbance.The boat containing Mr. Bunn and Mr. Sneed had returned part way to the ship, the sailors having heard the explosions, and desiring to aid in the work of saving the passengers if there was any need, for their craft could hold many more.Boat after boat was loaded and lowered away, and not an accident marred the work. True, Mrs. Maguire, in her anxiety to see that Nellie and Tommy were safe, nearly fell overboard, but a burly sailor caught her just in time.Russ spoke simply, but he well knew the danger he ran in remaining until the last boat was sent away. The ship might be in no real danger; even as Captain Falcon had said; but, on the other hand, the fire might have spread more than the commander realized. But Russ, like many another picture operator, was not afraid to do his duty as he saw it, even in the face of danger.Sweeping up through the mist came the ship that had responded to the wireless calls for aid. On she came at full speed, and when she caught sight of the _Tarsus_ she sent out a reassuring blast from her great whistle. It was answered in kind.""Oh, now we're all right, Daddy!"" cried Ruth, as she nestled close to her father. Mr. DeVere had been allowed to go in the boat with his daughters, as there was plenty of room, and all the other women had been provided for.The _Bell_ came as close as was safe, and a little later the small boats rowed to her accommodation ladder, which had been lowered. Then began the risky work of getting from the small boats to this ladder, and so aboard the _Bell_. For there was now a little sea on, and the boats rose and fell to a considerable degree."
"But the sailors were skillful, and soon all the passengers and baggage were transferred. Russ was the last to leave the _Tarsus_, and the last to go aboard the _Bell_, for he wanted every view he could get.Back to the burning vessel--perhaps, for all they knew, back to their doom--rowed the sailors of the _Tarsus_. The chief mate of the _Bell_, at the request of his commander, went to consult with Captain Falcon. On returning, the mate reported that Captain Falcon felt he could get the fire under control, and also make repairs to enable him to get his ship to port.But it is a pleasure to record that, after a hard fight, Captain Falcon and his men did subdue the flames, and, after harder work, temporary repairs enabled them to limp into port. Thus the commander saved his ship, and also avoided the payment, on the part of the owners, of heavy salvage. Later he was suitably rewarded by his superiors.But accommodations were found for all, though the quarters were rather cramped. The _Bell_ was bound direct for St. Augustine, and in due season, and without further mishap, the moving picture company reached that oldest city in the United States.Alice and Ruth were standing in the doorway of the hotel to which the moving picture company had been taken. They were looking out into the ladies' court--into a sun-lit and palm-girded garden, wherein a fountain played, the water falling with a musical tinkling.""And the best part of it is that we're getting _paid_ for it!"" observed a voice behind the two girls. They turned, with a start, for they had lost themselves in a dreaming reverie, to find Russ and Paul smiling at them. It was Paul who spoke.""Alice,"" warned Ruth, gently. She was endeavoring to wean her sister from the habit of using slang expressions; but Alice always boasted that she liked to take ""short cuts,"" and that slang--that is, her refined variety--offered the best method of accomplishing this very desirable object.Indeed, Mr. Pertell had not spared expense in taking out his moving picture company. And he had a method in going to one of the largest and finest hotels in St. Augustine. He intended to stage some scenes of one of the Southern plays there, and having his actors and actresses right in the hotel made it much more practical.It was the morning after their arrival and Mr. Pertell was not quite ready to proceed with making films. The fire aboard the _Tarsus_, and the necessity of taking another vessel, had rather upset everyone, so a day or so of rest had been decided upon.""There are lots of places to see,"" suggested Paul. ""This is the oldest city in the United States. I've got some guide books up in my room, and a lot of views. We'll pick out some points of interest and visit them.""""We'll have plenty of chance to see the sights,"" remarked Russ. ""I understand there are to be a number of films made in the city and vicinity, so you'll probably have to act out around Fort Marion and at Fort Mantanzas, as well as in the slave market. I'll be with you in a minute. I just want to get my little hand camera, to make a few snap-shots."""
"""Just to freshen up,"" as Alice put it, though really there was no need in her case, nor on the part of Ruth, either. The day was perfect--like summer--and the girls, knowing they were coming to the land of the palm and orange blossom, had brought suitable dresses.The darker beauty of Alice was well set off by her dress of light tan pongee with maroon trimming, and her sparkling brown eyes were dancing with life, and the love of life, as she came out to join her sister and the young men.""There you go!"" cried Alice. ""First you know you'll want to go off and live the simple life under a palm tree, with bananas for lunch and oranges for dinner. And when your--er--your hero--we'll say, comes riding on that milk-white steed I so despise, you'll be so thin that he won't know you.""Thus Ruth and Alice exclaimed as they entered the orange grove, a short distance from the city gates. And indeed the scene that greeted them, and the sweet odors, might well call for this praise and desire from even the most _blasé_ tourist.Ruth and Alice assumed graceful poses, and soon their likenesses were registered on the film. Russ never tired of taking pictures, and when he was not making moving ones he was using his small hand camera. How many times he had taken the likeness of Ruth it would be hard to estimate.""Somebody has said,"" went on the man, ""that you need to lean over a bathtub to eat an orange this way, but it's worth while. You get a little smeared up doing it; but you can wash in the spring over there,"" and he pointed to one amid a pile of stones.""Now, all you've got to do is to run your mouth along that strip,"" he directed, ""and you get all the juice--that is, all you don't miss. It takes a little practice; but I've got some black boys that can get every drop. Watch!""""Same here!"" put in Russ, and they cut their oranges as the man had done. The latter then prepared one each for Ruth and Alice, and amid much laughter--the girls and the young men leaning far over so as not to drip the juice on their clothes--they finished the delicious fruit.Laughing over the new way of eating oranges, but voting that it was worth while, even if it was a bit ""smeary,"" the young folks washed their hands and faces, and kept on through the grove, growing more and more glad at every step that they had come to Florida.""The waters rise and fall without any particular cause. Sometimes they are higher than at others, and none of the other wells, or springs, in this vicinity do that. So you see it may be miraculous after all.""""We'll all be young together,"" said Alice. Though she and her sister were not very chummy with the two former vaudeville actresses, they were not exactly unfriendly. And who could be unfriendly in that beautiful spot, and on the reputed site of the Fountain of Youth?""Poor Ponce de Leon,"" sighed Ruth. ""How disappointed he must have been when he found out that his life was slipping away in spite of the Fountain of Youth. I wonder if he really believed he had found it?"""
"""The Indians told him this was the fountain,"" said Paul, who had been reading history. ""Near this fountain was found a large coquina cross. The cross was located by the discovery of a silver casque, which contained documents telling of the matter, and one seems to fix the date of the first visit of Ponce de Leon to Florida. That was in 1513, according to the documents found in the casque.""I'll read you what one of the old documents said,"" went on Paul. ""'As we bore down upon him we found him to be an Indian, in a skin boat with a skin sail, running to a point twenty feet in the air, with a bow at the top. In the boat, which I describe in my descriptive image, I went ashore with the Indian. We landed near a spring that they call the Fountain of Youth; there they had a temple built where they worshipped the sun, and there I built a cross out of coquina, which is a natural formation of the sea, and I laid it with the rising and setting sun. In the heart of the cross I placed a descriptive image of myself, and took possession in the name of our beloved Catholic King.'Russ, back at the hotel, found that the manager had decided to make as the first film one showing some of his players at Fort Marion, and he wanted Russ to go out there with him and plan the scenario, which would be undertaken in a day or two.Arrangements having been made, the company one morning went to the old fort and there Russ filmed many scenes. The play was to be called ""The Spanish Prisoner,"" the background of the old fort being most effective.The players were filmed, going through their various parts on what was once the drawbridge in front of the portcullis, near the old watchtower on the stairway that was originally an inclined way, by which artillery was hauled up to the _terre plein_.The girl finally made her way to what had been the old guard room and dungeon. In the guard room was a table and some chairs, for the fort is in charge of a detachment from the United States Army, and accommodations are provided for visitors.As she rose she heard a noise near the doorway by which she had entered. Turning quickly, expecting to see one of the company, she was horrified to see by the light which entered through a barred window, an aged colored man facing her. He did not approach, but bowing before her exclaimed in quavering tones:""Den I find yo', my Missie! Old Jake look eberywhere fo' you,' but he find yo'! I knowed I'd find yo' some day, an' now I has, but it's been a pow'ful long time, honey! A long time!"" and with outstretched hands, as he took a battered hat from his head, he approached her. Alice screamed and got behind the table.His bearing was most deferential, as of some old slave toward a cherished mistress. His manner was gentle and, after advancing a short distance toward her, he stopped, bowed again, placed his battered hat over his heart, and said:And, without another word, he turned and shuffled out. But he had no sooner reached the entrance to the dungeon than Alice, who had remained behind the table, not knowing whether to go out or not, saw the old colored man seized by a soldier--one of those detailed at the fort.""Great Scott! Have you been bothering some of the women visitors?"" cried the soldier and, wheeling about on his heel, he hurried into the dungeon, which Alice had just decided to leave. He met her coming out, and by her agitated manner must have guessed that something had happened."
"""Oh, no, that's all right,"" interrupted the soldier. ""We want the visitors to go about as they please, alone or in company. Old Jake's as harmless as a kitten. He isn't just right up here,"" he said, touching his head, and speaking in low tones.""He's perfectly harmless,"" went on the soldier, looking out to see the aged negro shuffling off. ""You see, he used to be a slave in some Southern family,"" the army man explained. ""He was given his freedom, but never took it, and they say he went insane when his mistress died. He had taken care of her since she was a baby, and he took it very much to heart.""""Yes, we all like him around here,"" the soldier continued. ""He has a notion now that his 'little mistress,' as he calls her, is only lost, and he keeps searching for her. Sometimes he scares the lady visitors, so we try to keep him out of the lonely parts of the fort. But he must have slipped in here when no one was watching. I'll give him a good lecture.""""Well, I guess I'll have to, if you ask me that way, Miss,"" said the soldier with the air and manner of a Southern colonel. ""We can't refuse the ladies anything, you know,"" and he bowed and smiled in a frank manner that pleased Alice.""You may well say that, Miss. But it isn't so bad now as it must have been in the old days. It's a queer world, that men would make such a place to put a fellow creature in,"" and with this somewhat philosophical remark the soldier saluted again, as Alice bade him good-bye.The making of moving pictures was soon over for the day, and the company returned to the hotel. Some of the members went to their rooms, while the others sat about in the beautiful tropical garden, listening to the mingled music of the band and the fountain.""No, but it's out near the fort. Mr. Pertell is arranging for a motor boat race, with you girls in rival boats. You know there is a speed course on Mantanzas Bay, and he's hired two of the fast boats. It's going to be a regular race, for the two fellows who run the boats are real water rivals.""Mr. Pertell has induced them to act the parts for him, and there'll be some fun. Part of our company is to be in one boat, and part in the other, and some will be on the fort wall, outside the old moat, watching the boats come up. It ought to make a dandy picture.""""I'm sure it will,"" declared Ruth, who was always interested in the mechanical end, as well as in the artistic side. Russ had taught her considerable about the technical part of the business of making moving pictures.""There's no telling,"" Russ went on. ""As I said, the men who own the boats are real rivals, so each will do his best to come out ahead. There'll be no fake about this--if you'll excuse the use of slang,"" he added."
"The use of the dock of the St. Augustine Power Boat Club had been loaned for the making of the moving picture, and next day, with such of his company as were to go in the boats, Mr. Pertell went to the float. Others of the players took their places on the wall of the fort.The motor boats were powerful and handsome craft. The skippers of each were at the wheel as the players took their places, and each boat carried a blackened and greasy mechanician, as looking after high-powered motors was no simple matter. The staccato explosions of the motor boats, the cheers of the spectators, of whom there were many; the clicking of the camera operated by Russ, and the shouts of the picture-players themselves as they went through the ""business"" prescribed for this act of the play, made the scene a gay one.""Yes, and I am selfish enough to wish that it will stay with you a little longer,"" the manager said. ""That is, only so that you will not leave me and go back to the legitimate,"" he added, quickly. ""For I want you in moving pictures. I have some other plans when we finish work here, and you and your daughters will be much needed.""The boats sped on, the rival skippers striving to gain the lead. The men in charge of the motors, too, did everything in their power, in the way of changing the gasoline mixture, or by means of copious oiling, to get one more revolution out of their engines. But the boats seemed very evenly matched. A big wave was thrown up on either bow of each boat.Russ, after getting pictures of the start, had gone with his camera, by a short cut, to a little promontory on shore, where he got other views of the boats racing through the water. Then he went farther on and, getting into another motor boat, took his place near the finish line, to film the end of the race.Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon, who, with Ruth, were in the other boat, looked glum. As for Ruth she was of that gentle nature which is willing to lose, that others may enjoy even a brief pleasure, and she rejoiced in the delight of her sister.Once they were in the water Mr. Bunn and Mr. Sneed acted their parts well, and the result was a good film. Then, once more aboard the boats, a start was made for the fort, where the final act was to take place.But Mr. Towne's anxiety for his garments was wasted, for at that moment Mr. Sneed, taking off his coat, wrung some water from it, and of this a considerable quantity splashed on the light suit of Mr. Towne.Pop Snooks, the property man, who had little to do when outdoor scenes were being made, was busy with the other moving picture camera on the fort wall, and presently, on the arrival of the company at that place, the final scenes were filmed.One act in a play took place at the alligator ""farm,"" on Anastasia Island. There Ruth and Alice saw 'gators in all stages, from tiny ones just emerging from the shell, to big fourteen-foot ones--regular ""man-eaters"" they were told.""Hush! Yes. You know we agreed to say nothing about it, for fear of causing undue alarm. Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon might refuse to go, you know,"" she went on in a low voice, ""and that would make trouble for Mr. Pertell.""""Our destination will be Lake Kissimmee,"" proceeded Mr. Pertell. ""We will take some pictures on the lake, some on the Kissimmee River, that connects the lake of that name with Lake Okeechobee, and then we'll go a little way into the wilds, on various streams."""
"""Beg pardon,"" said Claude Towne, during a pause in which Mr. Pertell was consulting some notes he had jotted down, in order to make matters more clear to his players. ""Beg pardon, my dear sir, but are we going to a _very_ wild part of this country?""""I'd advise you to,"" remarked Mr. Pertell, with an assumption of gravity. ""The Seminole Indians, to which I refer, are a very ancient and proud race, I understand, and doubtless a dress suit would appeal to them. They are the first families of Florida!""""You know my offer--a thousand dollars a big bite,"" laughed the manager. ""But I don't fancy we shall see half as many as you saw out at the alligator farm. They are being hunted too fiercely for their skins to allow many to be around loose. Don't worry about them.""And now, friends, if you please, get ready for the trip to Lake Kissimmee. Russ, see to it that you have plenty of film, for we won't be able to get any out there. Now I leave you to make your arrangements.""There was a buzz and a hum of excitement as the players talked over what lay before them. Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon rather shared the disappointment of Mr. Towne that there was no ""society"" at the place where they were going. But Ruth and Alice, aside from a little feeling of apprehension, and of regret at the fate of the two girls of whom they had read, rather welcomed the coming change.Final visits were paid to points of interest in St. Augustine. It would be some time before they would see it again, as Mr. Pertell intended remaining in the interior for several weeks, and then going back to New York by a different route.Mr. Pertell and Russ had much to do to get ready for the trip. A motor boat had been arranged for to meet the party at Sycamore, where the headquarters would be for most of the work in the wilds of Florida. On this it was planned to take trips on Lake Kissimmee, and the river of that name.""At that little Spanish shop we pass every day. Oh, she has some of the most gorgeous things there, and some of the most beautiful! I wish my purse were as long as my desires. But I got this very reasonably.""The trip to Sycamore from St. Augustine was rather tedious and tiresome. The railways in the interior of Florida were not like some of the fast lines, and there was not always the luxury of a parlor car.On the trip Russ managed to get a series of films showing different scenes, and at one lonely railroad station, where they had to wait several hours for a connecting train, a little scene was improvised that later was worked into a play.The few ""natives"" around the place were much excited at some of the things the players did, and when Paul ""saved"" Mr. Towne from being run down by a freight train that came along, one grizzled old man was so worked up, thinking it all real, that he wanted to run for a doctor, when Mr. Towne pretended to be hurt.Ruth and Alice were among the first to go down to the parlor to await the ringing of the dinner gong. They strolled up to the desk, to ask the clerk if there was any mail for them, since word had been left at the hotel in St. Augustine to forward any letters."
"""Have they made any search for them?"" inquired Ruth, looking over her shoulder almost apprehensively, as though she, herself, were out in some swamp, surrounded by perils of all sorts. But only the lighted parlor met her gaze.""We did not exactly know them,"" replied Ruth, slowly. ""We met them in the train when we were going to the New England backwoods to get moving pictures last winter. One of them had a headache--I think it was Helen.""""Some sort of orchid,"" was the hotel man's answer. ""I don't know much about such things myself, but Mr. Madison, the girls' father, is quite a naturalist, and I guess they take after him. He collects birds, bugs and flowers, and the girls used to help him.""As I heard the story, he has been for a long time searching for a rare orchid that is said to grow around here. He never could find it until one day, by chance, an old colored man came in with a crumpled and wilted specimen, mixed in with some other stuff he had. Mr. Madison saw it, and grew excited at once, wanting to know where it had come from.""Well, Mr. Madison was about to start off on a little expedition, when he was taken ill. He was much disappointed, as some naturalist society had offered him a big prize for a specimen of this particular plant.""Then the girls, wishing to help their father, said they would go in search of it. They owned a good-sized motor boat, and had often gone off before, remaining several days at a time. They know how to take care of themselves.""""And lost they are,"" concluded the clerk. ""Not a word has been heard of them since they set off into the wilds. When they did not come back, after several days, Mr. Madison organized a searching party. But, beyond a few traces of the girls, nothing could be found.""The hotel at Sycamore was nothing to boast of, but it answered fairly well as the moving picture company would be outdoors practically all the time, as Mr. Pertell pointed out. The weather was like early Summer--most delightful--and it was a temptation to wander out under the stately, graceful palms, which cast a grateful shade.There were not many other guests at the hostelry, and interest centered in the company of players. They were asked many questions as to what they did, and how they did it, and when Russ set up his camera for the first time, merely to try it, and get the effect of light and shade, he was surrounded by a curious throng.The scenery around Sycamore was most wonderful--at least, so Ruth and Alice thought. It was not that it was grand or imposing--for it was anything but that. Florida is a low-lying country with many lakes and swamps. But the vegetation was so luxuriant, and the palms, the big trees festooned with Spanish moss and the ferns were so beautiful, that it was a constant delight to the girls.There are few rapid streams around the vicinity of Sycamore, most of them being sluggish to the point of swampiness. And a short distance away from the hotel, on some of the creeks and bayous, one could imagine oneself in some impenetrable jungle, so still and quiet was it."
"""I have chartered a small steamer,"" said the manager. ""At first I decided we could use a large motor boat, and make the trips back and forth from the hotel each day, to get to the various places. But I find that distances are longer than I calculated on, and it might be inconvenient, at times, to come back to the hotel. So I have engaged a good-sized, flat-bottomed stern-wheeler, and we can spend several days at a time on her if need be.""The _Magnolia_, which was the name of the steamer, arrived two days later. It proved to be an old, comfortable craft, with a wheezy engine, burning wood. At the stern was a paddle wheel, so placed because of the character of the waters to be navigated. The boat only drew about a foot, and could go in very shallow streams.""The first part of this play takes place aboard here,"" went on the manager. ""The action is simple, as you can see from the scenarios I have distributed. Some acts will take place on shore, and when the time comes for that the boat will be sent over to the bank and be tied up. Now then, Russ, get ready to film them. Mr. DeVere, you are in this first act; also Miss Ruth and Miss Dixon. Are you up in your parts?""The company of players was out on the steamer, moving slowly up a quiet stream, one of the tributaries of the Kissimmee River. On either side of the swamp-like stream were tall trees, from which hung, in graceful festoons, streamers of the peculiar growth known as Spanish moss. In the background were palms and other semi-tropical plants. But the growth along the stream itself was so luxuriant that little could be seen except along the banks.Now and then the quietude, which was unmarred, save by the gentle puffing of the engine, would be disturbed by some big bird, as it forsook its station on a fallen log, startled by the invasion of its domain. Again there would be a splash in the water.For a description of how moving pictures are taken, developed, printed and thrown on the screen in the theater by means of a projecting machine, the reader is referred to the previous books of this series.""That will do for this part of the drama,"" announced Mr. Pertell, when an hour or more had been spent in taking various films. ""We will now go ashore. Put her over there,"" he called to the man in the pilot house on deck, pointing to a place where, back of the moss-fringed row of trees, could be seen some stately palms.The rather clumsy boat turned slowly toward shore, and a little later had ""poked her nose,"" as Russ expressed it, against a luxuriant growth of tropical vegetation, in the midst of some low palms and gigantic ferns.It was a lonely spot, and just what Mr. Pertell wanted for this particular play. On the way up the stream they had passed several small settlements, and the population, consisting mostly of colored folk, had rushed down to the crude landings to stare with big eyes at the passing steamer.""Oh, but we can't go through there!"" complained Mr. Bunn, who, in attempting to make his way into the deeper part of the woods, had suffered the loss of his tall hat several times, low branches having knocked it off.This was done, and the moving picture players found it no trouble at all to make their way along the hewn path to where a little grove of palms, in a pretty glade, offered the proper scenic background for the pictures."
"The play concerned the elopement of a pretty Southern girl, the pursuit by her father, her subsequent marriage, and the forgiveness of her parents. One of the scenes showed the young couple fleeing through the wilderness, and coming to rest beneath the palms, while the pursuers searched in vain for them.""You're one of the lovers who has been disappointed by the elopement, Mr. Towne,"" said Mr. Pertell, in giving his directions. ""When I give the word you must come running along there, so the camera will show you alone.""""Oh, run faster!"" commanded Mr. Pertell, impatiently. ""Act as though you meant it. Put some spirit in it. You are supposed to be desperate because your sweetheart has gone off with another man. You look as though you didn't care!""Thereupon Mr. Towne tried to ""register"" anger, and succeeded fairly well. But in doing so he forgot to ""mind his steps,"" and a moment later, in running along the edge of the muddy stream he slipped, and the next moment, in all the glory of his white suit, he splashed into the mud.But moving picture work is not at all easy, and actors and actresses have to do more disagreeable and dangerous ""stunts"" than merely falling into a muddy stream. The demand of the public for realism often goes to extremes, and more than once performers have risked their lives at the behest of some enthusiastic manager.But aside from getting wet and muddy, which conditions could be remedied by a bath and dry clothes, the actor suffered no great hardship, except to his pride, and perhaps he had too much of that, anyhow.The young actor groaned, but there was nothing for it but to obey. He climbed out of the ditch, his once immaculate suit dripping mud from every point, and then he began the pretended chase again, seeking to find the escaping lovers.Of course this was the farcical element, but managers have found that this is much needed in plays, and though many of them would prefer to eliminate the ""horse-play"" the audiences seem to demand it, and managers are prone to cater to the tastes of their audiences when they find it pays.""I'd never consent to it,"" declared Mr. Sneed. ""This business is bad enough as it is,"" he complained, ""without deliberately making it worse. I presume he'll want me to try and catch an alligator next, or drive a sea cow to pasture.""""The manatee,"" explained Mr. Sneed. ""They are curious animals. They browse around on the bottom of Florida rivers, and sea inlets, as cows do on shore, eating grass. We'll probably see some down here.""""Not as a rule,"" answered the grouchy actor, who seemed to have taken a sudden interest in this matter. ""They might upset a small boat if they accidently bumped into it, for often they grow to be fourteen feet long, and are like a whale in shape.""""Manatees are not especially wild,"" laughed Mr. Sneed, it being one of the few occasions when he did indulge in mirth. ""In fact, the earlier forms of manatee were called _Sirenia_, and were considered to be the origin of the belief in mermaids. For they carried their little ones in their fore-flippers, almost as a human mother might do in her arms, and when swimming along would raise their heads out of water, so that they had a faint resemblance to a swimming woman."""
"""Now hold on, Mr. Bunn!"" said Mr. Pertell, quickly. ""I am not asking you to do much. You need not get in the bog deeper than up to your knees. That will answer very well. You can pretend it is a sort of quicksand bog and that you are sinking deeper and deeper. You call for help, and Mr. Switzer comes to get you out.""""I think this one will do,"" said the manager, pointing to one where Mr. Towne had fallen into the mud. ""You will come along, pretending to look for the fleeing lovers, and you will unwittingly wade out into the bog. There you will struggle to release yourself, but you will be unable to, and will call for help. Mr. Switzer, who is also on the trail, will respond and he will wade out and save you.""""That's so. It will be better!"" said the manager. ""I didn't think of that. I'll have Towne do it. He can come along on the film right after he's pulled himself out of the ditch. Fix it up that way, Russ.""Accordingly, after some intervening scenes had been filmed to make the action of the story, as revised, more plausible, Russ moved his camera near the bog hole, ready to get views of Mr. Bunn, when he should stumble into it, and also Mr. Towne, when the latter came to the rescue.""Hold on! Stop the camera!"" cried the manager, sharply. ""That won't do at all. This must be spontaneous. Run right along, and don't stop when you see the bog hole. Plunge right into it. Why, it isn't up to your knees, Mr. Bunn, and the weather is hot.""Mr. Bunn continued to sink in the bog. He pulled and struggled to get out, apparently without success. Then his tall hat fell off from the violence of his exertions, and he barely saved it from a muddy bath."
"It was true, then. The frantic appeals of Mr. Bunn were not in the interests of acting for moving pictures, but because he felt himself in actual danger. None of his friends had thought of that, until the man from the steamer offered confirmation. They had all thought the actor was doing a realistic bit of work.""I certainly do,"" answered the steamer hand. ""There are a lot of those bogs around here, and he's stumbled into one. He's going down every minute, too, and if you don't get him out soon you never will.""""Now we'll have you out!"" cried Mr. DeVere, as he flung one end of the novel rope to the actor in the bog. Mr. Bunn caught it, and, at the direction of Mr. Pertell, looped it about his chest, just under his arms.With the skirt-rope about him, and his friends pulling on it, Mr. Bunn's hand were free. Seeing this, and realizing that the more force that was applied, up to a certain point, the sooner would the actor be freed, Ruth cried:""It would be too late,"" declared Alice. Then, as she looked about the little clearing where the accident had taken place she saw, dangling from a tree, a long vine of some creeping plant. There were several stems twined together.""Thank the Lord for that!"" exclaimed Mr. Pertell, reverently, as he saw that his employe was safe. ""I should never have forgiven myself if--if anything had happened to you. For it was my suggestion that you go in the bog. My dear man, can you forgive me?"" and he held out his hand to Mr. Bunn, while his voice grew husky, and there was a suspicious moisture in his eye.""That's all right,"" responded Mr. Bunn, generously, and he seemed to have added something to his nature through his nerve-racking experience. He had been near death, or at least the possibility of it, and it had meant much to him.""Don't blame yourself, Mr. Pertell,"" he went on. ""I went into the hole with my eyes open. Neither of us knew the quicksand was there. And I suppose we must accept with this business the risks that go with it.""""I can't help regretting, though,"" said Mr. Pertell, as they were on their way back to the steamer, ""that we didn't get a moving picture of that. It would have made a great film--better even than the one I had planned.""""Yes,"" went on the young operator, ""when I saw that there were enough of you hauling Mr. Bunn out, I thought I might as well take advantage of the situation and get pictures. So I have the whole rescue scene here,"" and he tapped his moving picture camera."
"A day or so later the film, in which Mr. Bunn had figured in the quicksand, was finished, and then came the announcement that they would proceed on down the river to a new location, so as to get a different scenic background for the filming of a new drama.Some of the scenes of this took place on the steamer, and then, when the captain announced that he would have to tie up for half a day to enable the ""roustabouts"" to go ashore and cut wood for the boiler, Mr. Pertell said:""All right,"" agreed Paul, and with a splash the little anchor went over the side. The boat swung around and then became stationary. Russ was grinding away at the camera when, suddenly, the boat he was filming, with its occupants, began moving up stream.She had her wish a moment later, and it was rather more than she bargained for since the sea cow, in an effort to get rid of the rope that was twisted about its flipper, turned about with a swirl in the water, not unlike that made by the propeller of a motor boat, and came head-on for the craft it was unwittingly towing.On it surged toward the craft, and Paul, seizing an oar, prepared to attack. Russ called to his rowers to be ready to rescue the girls and the young actor if necessary, and then, with the desire for a good film ever uppermost in his mind, he continued to grind away at the camera crank.Paul did not answer, but jabbed with his oar at the manatee and struck it on the head. The sea cow dived, and this produced the desired result, for the rope slipped off its flipper, and it was free. It went under the boat, rubbed along on the keel with its back a short distance, causing Ruth and Alice to scream as their craft careened, and then vanished for good.""I don't know just how we can incorporate that scene in this drama,"" he admitted; ""but I suppose Mr. Pertell can find a way. He generally does. Now, if you girls are up to it, we'll finish with the regular play. I'll have to slip in some new film, though.""The players were out in the palm forest. It was several days after the episode of the manatee, and the steamer, with a plentiful supply of wood fuel, had gone up another sluggish stream, some miles farther on.Ruth looked and saw a tawny beast with laid-back ears and twitching tail, stretched on a big limb a short distance above the ground, and right over the two children, who were innocently prattling away, and looking at the flowers they had gathered.Alice thought for a moment. The animal in the tree had apparently not seen them--its attention was fixed on the two children. Then, as the girls watched, they saw it move slightly, while its tail twitched faster.""No, let me!"" exclaimed his sister, and the two got up with that suddenness which seems so natural to children, and sped across a little glade, out from under the tree, with its dangerous beast toward a clump of ferns and flowers.Before they had a chance to look and see who it was that had called, a shot rang out and the beast, which had been running along, crouched low like a cat after a bird, seemed to crumple up. Then it turned a complete somersault, and a moment later lay motionless.Tommy and Nellie, hearing the report of the gun, paused in their rush after the bright flowers, and then, as they saw the big animal not far from them, they uttered cries of fear, and clung to each other.Alice paused but a moment to look at the individual who had in such timely and effective fashion come to the rescue. She saw a tall, gaunt man, attired in ragged clothes, bending forward with ready rifle, to be prepared to take a second shot if necessary.""Wa'al, I reckon he _might_ have clawed 'em a bit,"" admitted the man with the gun. ""And perhaps it's jest as well I come along when I did. You folks live around here? Don't seem like I've met you befo'."""
"""We're a company of moving picture actresses and actors,"" explained Alice, while Ruth, making a detour to avoid the dead body of the animal, went to Tommy and Nellie, who were still holding on to each other.""Excuse me, Miss; but that ain't a bear,"" said the hunter, with a pull at his ragged cap that was meant for a bow. ""It's a bobcat--mountain lion some folks calls 'em--and I don't know as I ever saw one around this neighborhood before. Mostly they're farther to the no'th. This must be a stray one.""""Oh, no, Miss. I didn't mean it that way at all,"" said the man. ""I beg your pardon, I'm sure. But a bobcat won't hardly ever attack a grown person, unless it's cornered. I reckon this one must have been riled about suthin' and thought to claw up the tots a bit. I happened to be around, so I jest natcherally plunked him--beggin' your pardon for mentionin' the matter.""""You come along with us,"" the manager urged. ""I want to get a film of alligator hunting, and I'll make it worth your while to do some of your stunts before the camera. I'll pay you well, and you can have all the alligators you shoot.""So Jed became attached to the moving picture outfit, and a cheerful and valuable addition he proved. For he knew the country like a book, and offered valuable suggestions as to where new and striking scenic backgrounds could be obtained.An uneventful week followed the episode of the bobcat. The _Magnolia_ went up and down sluggish streams and bayous, while the company of players acted their parts, or rested beneath the palms and under the graceful Spanish moss.A little later the four young people, with the alligator hunter, set out in a big rowboat. Russ took with him a small moving picture camera, as he generally did, even when he had no special object in view.They rowed up the stream in which the _Magnolia_ was resting, her bow against a fern bank, and presently the party was in a solitude that was almost oppressive. There was neither sign nor sound of human being, and the steamer was lost to sight around a bend in the stream. Had there been any convenient mode of running away Ruth and Alice would certainly have taken advantage of it just then. But they were out in a boat, in the middle of a wide, sluggish stream, and all about them, swimming, diving, coming up and crawling over a long sand-bar, were alligators--alligators on all sides. They were surrounded by them now, and the girls would no more have gotten out of the boat, even if there had been a bridge nearby on which to walk to shore, than they would have dived overboard.As for Russ he said nothing. But he was busy focusing the small moving picture camera on the unusual scene. True, he had views of the saurians at the alligator farm near St. Augustine, but this was different. The views he was now getting showed the big, repulsive creatures in their natural haunts.""Well, that's what I was countin' on, Miss,"" he replied. ""I can't exactly get a 'gator without shootin' him. They won't come when you call 'em, you know. But if it's goin' to distress you, Miss, why of course I can--"""
"""Oh, no!"" she cried hastily. ""Of course I don't want to deprive you of making a living. That was selfish of me. Only I was afraid if you shot from the boat it might upset, and if we were thrown into the water with all those horrid things--ugh!""""I guess you're right, Miss,"" assented Jed. ""It will be better not to shoot from the boat, especially as we've got a pretty good load in, and my gun is a heavy one, though it don't recoil such an awful lot. Now we'll take you girls back to the steamer, and then I'll come here and make a bag--an alligator bag, you might say,"" he added with grim humor.""Well, perhaps not,"" admitted the younger girl, more readily than her sister had hoped. ""Shooting alligators is not exactly nice work, I suppose, however much it needs to be done, for we have to have their skins for leather.""Ruth and Alice had lost much of their first fear, and really the only danger now was lest one of the big saurians upset the boat, which it might easily do, by coming up under it. The alligators showed no disposition to make an attack. Indeed, most of them swam past the boat without noticing it, though a few of the smaller ones scuttled off when they came up and eyed the craft and its occupants.""I thought it was the tail that was the dangerous part of an alligator,"" said Russ, who now had all the pictures he wanted for the present, though he intended coming back with the larger camera and filming the alligator hunt.""Well, I've read lots of stories to the effect that an alligator or crocodile could swing his tail around and knock a man or dog into his mouth with one sweep, but I don't believe it,"" the hunter said. ""Of course that big tail could do damage if it was properly used, and you didn't get out of the way in time. In India I reckon the crocodiles are dangerous, if what you read is true; but I don't reckon a Florida alligator nor crocodile ever ate a man.""""That's a mistake,"" said Jed. ""There are both alligators and crocodiles in Florida, and some of the crocodiles grow to be nearly fifteen feet long. There ain't so much difference between crocodiles and alligators as folks think. The main point is that a crocodile's head is more pointed than an alligator's.""""Wa'al, I grant you they ain't none of 'em beauties,"" returned the hunter, with a chuckle, ""though I have heard of some folks takin' home little alligators for pets. I'd as soon have a pet bumblebee!"" and he laughed heartily.The two girls were becoming almost indifferent to the alligators now, though in turning about for the return trip to the steamer they several times bumped into the clumsy creatures, and once the craft careened dangerously, causing Alice and Ruth to scream.There was considerable excitement aboard the _Magnolia_ when the party returned with word about the alligators, and when Paul and Russ went back with Jed, Russ taking a large camera, another boatload of men with guns was made up for the hunt.""Well, I can't go on with you folks any longer,"" said Jed that night, as Mr. Pertell, aboard the _Magnolia_, was talking of further plans. ""I've got to stay and take care of my alligator skins,"" he added. ""It means big money to me."" Pushing her bow up sluggish streams--up rivers that flowed under arching trees, heavy with the gray moss, went the _Magnolia_. The party of moving picture players had been on the move for three days now, without a stop for taking of pictures, save those Russ made of the negroes cutting wood for the boilers. No dramas were to be made until they reached a certain wild and uninhabited part of Florida, of which Mr. Pertell had heard, and which he thought would be just right for his purpose."
"They had left the vicinity of the alligator hunt, and were pushing on into the interior. In reality it was not so many miles from Sycamore, but it seemed a great way, so lonely was it in the palm forests and cypress swamps.""Oh, why--er--my deah fellah! Of course I do--at times. I find--I really find I have to give a great deal of consideration--at times--to the suit samples my tailor sends me. And really I shall not be sorry to get back to deah old N'York and renew my wardrobe.""Then silence once more settled down over the company on the upper deck of the _Magnolia_. An awning protected them from the hot sun, and really it was very pleasant traveling that way. Of course it was lonesome and the solitude was depressing. For days they would see nothing save perhaps the boat of some solitary fisherman, or alligator hunter.Occasionally they saw some of the big saurians themselves, as they slipped into the water from some log, or sand bar, on the approach of the steamer. Now and then some wild water fowl would dart across the bows of the boat, uttering its harsh cries.Russ got a number of fine nature films, but the real work of making dramas would not take place for another day or two. Meals were served aboard, though once or twice, when a long stop had to be made for the cutting of fuel, a shore party was made up.""I think this will about suit us,"" said Mr. Pertell, one evening, as the _Magnolia_ made a turn in the stream, and came to a place where another sluggish river joined it. ""This is the spot spoken of by Jed, and the surrounding country will give us just the scenery we want, I think. We will tie up here for the night, and you and I will make an examination to-morrow, Russ.""It was so warm that supper really was almost a waste of effort on the part of the cook that evening, for few ate much. Then came a comfortable time spent on the deck, while the night wind cooled the day-heated air.""Oh, isn't this positively stifling!"" complained Miss Pennington as she dropped into a chair beside Ruth. ""How do you ever stand it? I've bathed my face in cologne, and done everything I can think of to cool off.""During the next few days every member of the company, from Mr. DeVere to Tommy and Nellie, had their share of work. There were romantic plays filmed, and in these Ruth had good parts. As for Alice she rejoiced when she had humorous ""stunts"" to do.Some comic films were made, and in a few of these Mr. Sneed and Mr. Towne had to do ""stunts"" such as falling in the mud and water, or toppling down hills head over heels. But Mr. Pertell was careful to warn them not to run dangerous risks.Mr. DeVere, as usual, did more dignified work, and Mr. Bunn was delighted when told that he might do a bit of Shakespeare. And to do him credit, he acted well, much better than some of his associates had supposed he could."
"""I have a new idea for to-day,"" said Mr. Pertell one morning, as the day's work was about to start. ""In one drama I wish to show a little picnic scene, with two girls and their mother. You will be the mother, Mrs. Maguire, and with Ruth and Alice will go off up a side stream in a boat. Russ will go along, of course, to manage the camera, and I think I'll send Paul to help row the boat. Take a gun along, Paul, for you can pretend to shoot some game for the lunch.""You will also have a regular picnic lunch along--real food, by the way, and you will spread it out in some picturesque spot and eat."" Mr. Pertell then went on giving directions for the acting of the drama that was to center around the little picnic. Ruth began to cry quietly--she really could not help it. Alice felt like following her example, but the younger girl had the saving grace of humor. Not that Ruth actually lacked it, but it was not so near the surface, nor so easily called into action.""Why, it won't be so bad,"" put in the jolly Irish woman. ""We've got a roomy boat, thank goodness. We can lie down on the rugs, with our rubber coats for protection against the dew. We have some food left, and the moon will soon be up, for it's clearing fast. Then, in the morning, we can find our way back to the steamer.""There were some heavy rugs in the boat, having been brought along to use in the picnic scene in the woods. While Paul arranged these in the bottom of the craft, and put some cushions against the seats so that Mrs. Maguire and the two girls could lean against them, Russ prepared the coffee. A jug of drinking water had been brought along, for the water of the creeks and river was not considered good. Then, with an alcohol stove, set up on a seat, a steaming pot of coffee was soon made.Fortunately the boat was a roomy one, and the lost ones were not as uncomfortable as might have been imagined, with the rugs and cushions and the piece of canvas, as well as their raincoats, for covering.""Well, we'll have to stand watch and watch, of course. And we will have the gun ready. It's all loaded. No telling what might happen. A bobcat might take a notion to come aboard, or an alligator might nose us out. We'll have to be on the watch.""Ruth and Alice declared it was out of the question, and for a long time they remained wide awake. Mrs. Maguire, who had traveled with many road companies, and had often slept under adverse circumstances, did manage to doze off. Russ had first watch, and Paul was tired enough to fall into a slumber.""It's a wild beast, that's all,"" said Paul, though his voice was not steady as usual. For the cry, coming out of the darkness, perhaps from a spot where some animal crouched, ready to spring down on them, was not reassuring."
"""I believe I may have touched him,"" admitted Russ, not a little proudly. ""There was a big charge of shot in that cartridge, and it probably scattered. He can't be badly hurt though, but it may make him go serenade someone else. We've had enough.""The howls grew fainter, and there was a crashing in the bushes and tree limbs that told of the retreat of some creature. Finally these sounds ceased, and once more there was silence and darkness, illuminated only by the lantern and the faint glow of the smudge-fire.Searching about with the lantern Russ and Paul managed to get enough dry wood to start a blaze. It was a tiny one at first, but as the wood dried out the flames grew apace until there was a really good camp fire.""It isn't half so lonesome now,"" added Ruth. She tried to be cheerful--as cheerful as Alice seemed, though really both girls, in their hearts, were worrying over the effect their absence would have on their father. Breakfast, on the shore of the sluggish and swamp-like stream where the big rowboat was moored, was a meagre meal, indeed. For after a moment of consideration it was decided not to use up all the food that remained.And so the ""rations"" were divided into two parts, though with all there would not have been enough for one substantial meal. Fortunately, however, the coffee was plentiful. The cook, when told to put up a lunch for the picnic party that was to figure in the moving pictures, had been very liberal, otherwise there would have been no food left now. And in the matter of coffee enough had been put in to make several large pots full.The embers of the camp fire kindled in the night were blown into flame, and soon a genial blaze was leaping upward under the big trees. The refugees gathered about it and ate the scanty meal, drinking several cups of coffee.The girls had freshened themselves by washing at the side of the brook which flowed from the spring, and then having arranged their hair, with the aid of their side combs, and a pocket mirror Alice carried, they looked, as Paul said, ""as sweet as magnolia blossoms.""""Well, it can't be so very far off,"" spoke Russ, evasively. ""The trouble is there are so many twists and turns to these creeks and rivers that we lost our way. I wish I had thought to bring a compass but, since we didn't, we'll have to go by the sun. I think the steamer lies in that general neighborhood,"" and he pointed in a south-easterly direction.The blankets and cushions were arranged in the craft to make comfortable places for the girls and Mrs. Maguire, and then the remains of the food, and the coffee outfit, having been stowed away, Paul and Russ took the oars, and once more the refugees were under way.As nearly as possible, allowing for the twists and turns of the stream, the course was in the direction Russ and Paul had agreed upon as being the best. From time to time, as they rowed on, they paused to listen for any hails which would probably be given by the searching party from the steamer.Now and then they would see alligators in the waters up or down which they rowed, but the saurians showed no disposition to molest the boat. And Russ had too few cartridges to wish to waste any on the creatures.""And yet it may be within a comparatively short distance of us,"" said Russ, as cheerfully as he could. ""Only the woods are so dense that we can't see it, and if our voices and the sounds of the gun carry to the _Magnolia_ those aboard can't tell from which direction they come."""
"""I think not,"" said Russ. ""The boat is really easiest and best for us."" He did not say so, but he thought that if they had to spend another night in the open the boat would be absolutely necessary. So they remained aboard.""Whist! And it's laughin' we'll be at ourselves in a little while--to think we were scared!"" she cried, with a forced Irish brogue. ""We'll be soon aboard the steamer tellin' what good times we had, an' the others will be wishin' they'd been along.""Thus came the excited calls from those in the rowing craft, as it drifted toward the hut on shore--a palm leaf hut that seemed crudely made. Russ and Paul had ceased rowing at the sight of the motor boat, and now their own craft was merely drifting.""Yes?"" agreed Paul, half-questioningly. ""And yet isn't it queer we don't see some sign of life?"" he asked, in a low voice. ""We have made noise enough, but no one has come out of that hut. And the hut itself doesn't seem like a very permanent sort of residence; does it?""He and Paul resumed their rowing and a little later were close beside the moored motor boat. It was a large craft, and well appointed, though now it showed signs of being weather-beaten; it was scratched and marred. But it seemed to be in good running order.With Russ and Paul in the lead the little party made their way to the palm leaf hut. It was ingeniously made--a glance showed that. A palm tree had been taken for the centre pole, and about this had been tied layer after layer of palm leaves, so laid as to shed the rain.The hut was circular, and at the outer edge of the roof poles had been driven into the ground to support it. There was a small opening, which necessitated stooping to enter, and this doorway, if such it could be called, was covered by a sort of curtain of palm leaves, made in layers and fastened together with withes and wild leaves, laced in and out.""I don't know who has been here,"" said Russ, ""but it's the sort of a hut a native might build--possibly a Seminole Indian. Or some hunters may have it to stay a few nights in a spot where they could get alligators, or whatever game they were after. The fact that the boat is here seems to show they haven't gone for good.""A closer examination of the hut showed two rude bunks, made of sticks, raised slightly above the surface of the ground. The bunks were covered with thick layers of Spanish moss, and were evidently far from being uncomfortable. A few blankets showed that the occupants did not lack for a little comfort."
"There were a few cooking utensils scattered about, and outside, the ashes of a camp fire, made between stones--a sort of oven--showed how the meals were prepared. But there was little evidence of food, save a few empty tins.""There are evidently two persons staying here,"" observed Russ, as he looked at a packing box, which served as a table, and noted two tin plates, and two knives, forks and spoons. ""It must be real jolly, camping this way.""""That is so, and we may as well face the issue,"" said Russ, somewhat gravely. ""And now that we have found a sign of human beings, who can possibly tell us which way to go to find the steamer, it would be foolish to waste this chance. If we go off by ourselves again we may get farther and farther away from the _Magnolia_.""""I believe we will give a few signals,"" agreed Russ. ""And I can spare a couple of cartridges. I only wish I could see something worth eating to shoot at. Then I could be killing two birds with one stone--giving a signal and providing a meal.""Again came an unmistakable answer. Now was heard a crashing in the underbrush that told of the approach of someone, and, a moment later there came into view, on the far side of the clearing, where stood the palm leaf hut, two girls, one with a gun over her shoulder, and the other with a brace of birds hanging from her waist.""Ruth--Alice DeVere!"" came the simultaneous cry from the lost girls--now the _found_ girls. ""Oh, how did you ever get here?"" asked Helen Madison, for it was really she and her sister. Alice had recognized them first, and Ruth knew them a moment later.""Your steamer--no!"" half-sobbed Mabel. ""Oh, it is awful! We have been lost a long time--it seems a month, but of course it isn't. We can't find our way out of this wilderness. It is a labyrinth, and we dare not go far from this hut for fear we shall never find it again. It has been terrible. But if you are lost you cannot help us. What shall we do?""""Let us eat first,"" suggested Russ, practically. ""You have some birds there. I fancy you are as hungry as we are. We have some crackers and coffee. We'll get up a meal and then decide what to do. Come, Paul, we're the commissary department."""
"""Oh, but we must hear your story!"" cried Ruth to the lost girls, after she had presented Mrs. Maguire and the boys. ""We read about you in the paper, and we heard of you from the hotel clerk in Sycamore.""""There isn't much to tell,"" said Mabel. ""We started off after wild orchids. Well, we became lost, and in trying to find our way back we wandered farther and farther into the swamp. We had our motor boat, as you see, and quite a quantity of provisions, which was lucky for us. We tried our best to get out, but could not.""Finally we found this spot--the hut was already here, built by alligator hunters, very likely. We appropriated it, and the small quantity of food it contained. Since then we have lived on that and what we could shoot. Fortunately game was plentiful, but we have so longed for some bread and coffee. I am dying for a cup.""By degrees, and with each one telling a part, the story of the moving picture players was related. They told how they had looked in vain for their steamer. Mabel and Helen Madison also went more into details, giving some of their trying experiences in the swamps and bayous.""Kin I show yo' all a way outen dish yeah woods? I shore kin, honey lamb! I knows dish yeah place laik a book, even if I cain't read. Where all does yo' all want t' go? Oh, wait a minute, though. Hole on! I done got t' ax yo' all some questions. Hab yo' all seen any photographers round 'bout yeah?""""Yais, sah! I done passed a steamer yist'day, an' dey all on board was monstrous peeved 'cause dey done lost der photographer. Yo' all know--he takes dese pictures dat twinkle laik stars--yo' know, slidin' pictures, I guess dey calls 'em.""""We can go in the motor boat!"" cried Mabel. ""Oh, how glad I am that we have it. There's gasoline enough, I think, and there is a powerful searchlight. Oh, Helen, we're found--we're found!"" and she fell to sobbing on her sister's shoulder."
