Second upon the re-printing of Dr. _Crisp's_ Sermon.Answ. _Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven Image, or any likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth beneath, or that is in the Water under the Earth: thou shalt not bow down thy self to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and showing mercy unto thousands, of them that love me and keep my Commandements._Answ. _Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy, six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattel, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six dayes the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath-day, and hallowed it_.Answ. _Thou shalt not Covet thy Neighbour's House, thou shalt not Covet thy Neighbours Wife, nor his Man-servant, nor his Maid-servant, nor his Oxe, nor his Ass, nor any thing that is thy Neighbour's.__Answ._ John 3. 16. _God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have Everlasting Life._ John 6. 37. _Him that comes unto me, I will in no wise cast out._ I Tim. 1. 15. _This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that_ Jesus Christ _came into the World to save sinners._ _Answ._ 1.
