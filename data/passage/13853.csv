passage
"1st.--_That the Word Method is the most natural and practicable,_ because words are representatives of objects, actions, etc., while letters, or sounds, in the abstract, convey no meaning to the pupil, and are devoid of interest.2d.--_That words of ordinary length are as easily learned as short ones, provided they are familiar to the pupil_. No teacher will doubt the statement that a pupil will learn the word ""mamma'"" as easily as ""says"" or ""eyes.""3d.--_That frequent ""Reviews"" are essential to the rapid and thorough advancement of pupils_. By this means the words imperfectly learned are again brought to their attention and thoroughly memorized. That these ""Reviews"" ought to take up the new words in a different order and arrangement, in order to test the ability of the pupil to recognize them in any situation. That as soon as the vocabulary is large enough they should be written in the form of a new exercise, as on pp. 36, 44, 52, 60, and 68 of this book. 4th.--_That thorough and systematic drill in Spelling is absolutely necessary_. That the ""Reading Reviews"" should be so constructed as to contain all the new words used in the lessons they were intended to review, and no others, so that they can be used for ""Written or Dictation Spelling."" That the pronunciation of the words in the ""Spelling Reviews"" should be indicated by the diacritical marks of Webster, so that they can be used for either ""Oral Spelling"" or ""Phonic Drill.""5th.--_That the ""Script"" from which the pupil gets his first and most lasting impressions should be of large size and accurate form_, and not of the nondescript character usually found in books of this class. That it should be free from superfluous line and flourish, and yet have grace and beauty. That it should be adapted for both copying and reading.7th.--_That the lessons of a book of this grade should not average more than seven ""new words.""_ That all such words should appear at the commencement of lessons, and be familiar to the pupil. That this method secures careful gradation, and is in marked contrast with the old custom of having from fifteen to twenty-five.8th.--_That ""Outline Drawings"" of the objects first presented to pupils should be made in the presence of the class_, as it stimulates them to draw, and thus makes easy and profitable the copying of the ""Script Exercises.""9th.--_That the schoolbook of to-day must be beautifully and copiously illustrated_. That there must be variety as well as excellence, both in drawing and engraving. That well-known and famous artists must be secured, such as Harper, Fredericks, Church, Lippincott, Eytinge, White, Beard, Weldon, Thulstrup, Cary, Moser, Weaver, and Share; and such engravers as Karst, Wigand, French, Held, Davis, Hellawell, etc.Ō to̤ mē mȳ (mī) wē to͞o hăt trēe⃥ c̵ăts one (wŭn) tw⃥o̤ (to͞o) new (nū) pụt māy⃥ răts thrēe⃥ fōu⃥r snōw⃥ dŏll⃥ līke⃥ tāke⃥ rīde⃥ wĭŧh flōo⃥r (flōr) ḡo͝od ḡāve⃥ fīve⃥ ŧhōs̝e⃥ ŧhăt ŧhe̱y⃥ vĕr'y̆ bĩrds̝ pret'ty̆ (prĭt'ty̆) mȧm mä'ĭf ĭts băc⃥k slĕd hō fûr ō'vẽr ḡĩrls̝ ḡō shē sŏft hûrt ŭp out boys̝ hăve⃥ ŏff⃥ now lo͝ok c̵ăt⃥ch dĭd whȳ ḡĭve⃥ sma̤ll⃥ băd hĭll⃥ rāçe⃥ (rās) kĭt'ty̆ sa̤w⃥ down Rōv'ẽr hēre⃥ mĕr'ry̆ŭs bē nō lĕt ăm fŭn of (ŏv) ȧwāy⃥' ḡŭn ḡlăd bēa⃥t Roy Nĕd nēa⃥r pŏnd mōre⃥ märch so͞on y⃥o⃥ūr frŏm whạt c̵ȯme⃥ (kŭm) ma'ny̆ (mĕn'y̆) rŭb'-a-dŭb hănd ŧhêre⃥ sȯme⃥ (sŭm) drŭm ăp'ple⃥ whêre⃥ ăp'ple⃥s̝bȳ shĭp bo͝ok wĭngs̝ bŭt sāi⃥l c̵āme⃥ Mā'ry̆ ōld wĕll⃥ ĭn'to̤ dĭsh'ĕs̝ măn nīçe⃥ dēa⃥r ŭn'dẽr ȧsk lĕft hīde⃥ wa̤'tẽr hăy⃥ hōld māde⃥ fŭn'ny̆ sĭx fo͞od chĭc⃥k c̵âre⃥ fôr fēe⃥d chĭc⃥ks k⃥nōw⃥ toys̝flȳ trȳ sāy⃥ rĕd a̤ll⃥ hĭm dȯe⃥s̝ (dŭz) nōs̝e⃥ māke⃥ hĕld c̵ōld e⃥ȳe⃥s̝ (īz) hīg⃥h⃥ (hī) kīte⃥ fụll⃥ ēa⃥ch fēa⃥r trăc⃥k sīde⃥ Jĭll⃥ Jăc⃥k stēe⃥r fa̤ll⃥ c̵lēa⃥r Fī'dō wa̤rm pŭp'pĭe⃥s̝ frōze⃥ strĭng kīte⃥s stärt strŏng sēe⃥m ȯŧh'ẽr (ŭŧh'ẽr) thĭnk hụr räh⃥'sō hä hĭd ūs̝e⃥ tŭb spȳ c̵ăp said (sĕd) sĭc⃥k fīnd pȧss⃥ w⃥ho̤ sēe⃥k ŧhĕn shŭt ŧhăn bȧth bärn kēe⃥p shăll⃥ Frĕd whĭp w⃥răp mŭst stănd blăc⃥k y⃥o⃥ūrs̝ pō'ny̆ whīle⃥ sha̤w⃥l sĭs'tẽr plēa⃥s̝e⃥ ḡō'ĭng fȧst'ẽr Frăṉkfrō ḡlōw⃥ hīnd c̵a̤u⃥g⃥h⃥t ȧ ḡō' tīme⃥ wẽre⃥ ȧ frāi⃥d' sĩr lŏng spīe⃥d a̤l'way⃥s̝ c̵ŭt sĭlk hōlds̝ mous'ĭe⃥ lĕḡs̝ be⃥âr dȧnçe⃥ c̵ȯm'ĭng dŏḡs̝ pa̤w⃥s̝ thĭngs̝ rŭn'nĭng fĕll⃥ stĭc⃥k stănds̝ hŭnt'ĭngā as in lāke ē as in bē ŏ as in bŏx ă "" "" ăt ĕ "" "" lĕt ū "" "" ūs̝e ä "" "" fär ẽ "" "" hẽr ŭ "" "" ŭp a̤ "" "" a̤ll ī "" "" īçe û "" "" fûr â "" "" c̵âre ĭ "" "" ĭn o͞o "" "" to͞o ȧ "" "" ȧsk ō "" "" sō o͝o "" "" lo͝okb as in băd m as in mē y as in yĕs d "" "" do̤ n "" "" nō z "" "" frōze f "" "" fŏx p "" "" pụt ng "" "" sĭng ḡ "" "" ḡō r "" "" răt ch "" "" chĭc̵k h "" "" hē s "" "" sō sh "" "" shē j "" "" jŭst t "" "" to͞o th "" "" thĭṉk k "" "" kīte v "" "" vĕry̆ th "" "" thē l "" "" lĕt w "" "" wē wh (hw), "" whạt"
