passage
"What dreams the flower cups enfold Within their fragrant leaves, Of meadow-ways grown fair with spring, Soft mists that April weaves; And cottage gardens where the scent Of flowers is with the wood-smoke blent.The ceaseless ripple of the brook, Babbling against the broken arch, The little firwood's tasselled spires, The cloud of verdure on the larch; The gold-green glimmer of the woods, Where tender twilight always broods.O late and sweet, too sweet, too late! What nightingale will sing to thee? The empty nest, the shivering tree, The dead leaves by the garden gate, And cawing crows for thee will wait, O sweet and late!Where wert thou when the soft June nights Were faint with perfume, glad with song? Where wert thou when the days were long And steeped in Summer's young delights? What hopest thou now but checks and slights, Brief days, lone nights?Stay, there's a gleam of Winter wheat Far on the hill; down in the woods A very heaven of stillness broods; And through the mellow sun's worn heat, Lo! tender pulses round thee beat, O late and sweet! There's beauty all around our paths, if but our watchful eyes Can trace it midst familiar things and through their lowly guise; We may find it when a hedgerow showers its blossoms o'er our way, Or a cottage window sparkles forth in the last red light of day.The violet's fragile petals Enfolded a heart of gold, And a deeper wealth of perfume, Than the tiny cup could hold; So the great wind roaring above Sent a tiny zephyr down, To drift aside the sheltering bloom, And bereave her of her crown.It stole the familiar scent, To give to the burdened heart With only a cold north wind In the world to take its part; The flower died in the bleak March air, And the heart went on its way; The violet's life was blooming there, And melting the snows away.Dear, do not die! Of cypresses and grassy graves sing I-- I hang with wreaths of song death's grief-grown cross, And weep, to music, for Life's infinite loss, And make the sweetest verse of bitterest woe, --I know the way because I love you so; But I have written griefs that I have known In other's heart's blood, never in my own. If _you_ died what more could be sung or said? I could not sing of Death if you were dead.Dear, do not love! Do not love _me_, keep still aloof, above! While you and Love in far-off glory stand Clear sounds the voice, and harp responds to hand. But if you loved me--if you came quite near And set Love 'mid life's common things and dear-- Mute would the voice be, Love would be too fair To waste upon the wide world's empty air, And, songless, I should droop and vainly pine-- I could not sing of Love if you were mine!Waking, I dream of thy life that shall be Never by sorrow made weary; Earth shall be soft with love for thee, Down-lined the nest of my dearie. Millions of flowers to gladden thy way, Springing from seeds that my heart sets to-day. Sleep, darling baby, baby!Sleeping, dream thou of the Spirit of Spring-- Of sweets and of scents she is bringing; Just for the flowers' sake thrushes will sing, Flowers blow for love of the singing. In the world's harmony take thou thy part, So shall the springtide bloom in thy heart! Sleep, darling baby, baby! Now comes the first chill whisper of the end, While yet the woods are green and skies are blue; While under loads of corn great waggons bend, And sunshine makes us glad the whole day through. The trees are full of leaf and of delight, Yet through them sighs the forecast of the time When the lean branches shall be wondrous, white With winter's lovely radiant frost and rime.The fallen leaves as yet are hardly missed, The rest will fade--until the woods are bare, And the dim glades where summer lovers kissed, Forget how leafy and divine they were. And in our souls come whispers of despair, ""Failure again--failure for evermore! Leaves only for one summer's space are fair, No flower can live to see the fruit it bore."""
