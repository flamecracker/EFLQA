This busy, dusty wind that blows Along the cruel streets, Right to the heart of violets goes, And robs them of their sweets. And as along the cruel street The keen wind robs the flowers, So the cold kindness that we meet Blights these poor hearts of ours. But if you tend with warmth, you know, Your violets, they give Sweet scent again, as if to show How glad they are to live. We think if some one loved us too Our hearts would break to prove By all that we could say or do, How glad we were to love! Dream footsteps wandering past us in our sleep, A restless presence stirring with the light, The cry of waters where the snow was white, A violet's whisper where dead leaves lay deep; The dim wood's music makes a sudden leap, Broken notes, blending in a wild delight, And lo! the whole world changes in our sight. Promise is ended--we must turn and reap Fulfilment, for the Spring with all her wealth Is with us, and compels us to her will. Yet if the sun-dawn we should shun by stealth Yearning for shadows and the darkened hours, Sweet Lord, be pitiful, remembering still One lieth low beneath the budding flowers. Never a hand on the cottage door To call me forth in the evening light, My days grow old, and I watch no more The cowslips gold and the may-buds white. Primroses nestle beneath the hedge Where we kissed and wept and said good-bye-- For twenty years I have watched them bud, For twenty years I have seen them die. Yet now that the Spring once more has turned The sea to silver, the earth to gold, I shall watch no more from the primrose lane, Where I waited and watched in the days of old. Yet the children weave me their daisy chains, The woodland music is sweet and clear, Though the footsteps have wandered beyond recall, That I watched and waited so long to hear! My best beloved, the Spring is fair, The woods are green and life is good, Come out with me and let us tread By field and fold and sweet wet wood-- The wind-flower blanches all the copse, With hyacinth the hedge is blue, And every wakened leaf is fair, But not so fair as you! The black-birds sing on hazel boughs Beneath the overarching trees, The cuckoo's distant song is borne Across the meadow by the breeze, The thrush's song is sweetest far But saddens as the hours go by. You hear? The nightingale's in love, But not so much as I! Then rain, and after, moonshine cold and fair, And scent of earth, sweet with the evening rain, And slow soft speech beneath the rain-washed trees, Ah, that such things should never come again! Ah me, how pleasant to go down From the forlorn and faded town To Kentish wood and fold and lane, And breathe God's blessed air again; Where glorious yellow corn-fields blaze And nuts hang over woodland ways. To pick the sweet keen-scented hops, (See from each pole a dream-wreath drops) To toil all day in pure clear air, Laughter and sunshine everywhere-- With reddening woods and sweet wet soil And well-earned rest and honest toil. Where do we fly, under deep dark sky? Over the moors we go, Over the pool where quiet and cool Bulrush and sedges grow-- And what was the loveliest thing we met? Ah--we forget! We remember though all the firelit glow Of a great hearth's gleam and glare, And we looked for a space at each happy face And the love that was written there. And that, of all we have looked on yet-- We least forget! Oh what a day! all yellow and gray, And so dark, so dreary, so foggy and thick, That if I should meet In the street My sweet-- I might pass her by! Risk that? Not I! Take me home out of danger then! Quick, feet, quick.
