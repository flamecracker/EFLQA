She put her hand to the drop to be sure she had not been mistaken, then turned in dismay to her companions.If she had said the world was coming to an end her companions could not have looked more startled. Then Billie Bradley cocked an eye at what she could see of the sky through the trees and held out one hand experimentally.Violet Farrington was always a little wistful when in trouble, like a small girl who can never understand why she is being punished. But just now this wistfulness irritated Billie Bradley, who was very much given to quick action herself, and she turned upon Vi rather snappily.And it must be admitted that the girls were in rather a trying situation. Their botany teacher at Three Towers Hall, where they were students, had sent them into the woods to gather some rare ferns which they were to use in the botany class the next day.They had gathered the ferns, turned to go back to Three Towers, and found, to their absolute dismay, that they did not know which way to go. There was no getting over the fact. They were absolutely and completely lost!For almost an hour now they had been wandering around and around, getting deeper into the woods every minute, until they had finally begun to feel really frightened. Suppose they couldn't find Three Towers before dusk? Suppose they should be forced to stay in the woods all night? These and a hundred other thoughts had chased themselves through their heads, but they had said nothing of their fears to each other. The girls were thoroughly ""game.""But now had come this new complication. It had begun to rain. Hopelessly lost in the woods and a storm coming on! It was a situation to try the patience of a saint. And the girls were not saints. They were just happy, fun-loving, lovable specimens of young American girlhood who could upon occasion show rather alarming flashes of temper.""Goodness, Billie, what an idea!"" said Vi breathlessly. ""I never even thought about his escaping. And I suppose,"" she added, beginning to feel deliciously goose-fleshy, ""that we'd be the very first ones he'd go for. Revenge, you know--that's what they are always after in the stories.""""I hate to interrupt you,"" Laura broke in as sarcastically as she could. ""But if you two want to stand there all day talking about the Codfish and revenge, you can, but I'm going to find some way out of this place. Goodness, I felt another drop. And there's another!"""
"""Well, we certainly won't find it by standing still,"" snapped Billie. ""Come on. I feel it in my bones that Three Towers is somewhere off in this direction."" And she led the way into the woods, the girls following dispiritedly.In the first book of this series, entitled, ""Billie Bradley and Her Inheritance,"" Billie had been left an old homestead at Cherry Corners in the upper part of New York State. The strange legacy had come to Billie from an eccentric aunt, Beatrice Powerson, for whom Billie had been named. For Billie's real name was not Billie at all, but Beatrice.It will be remembered that the girls had decided to spend their vacation there, and that the boys, Billie's brother Chetwood, Laura's brother Teddy, and another boy, Ferd Stowing, had joined them there and that queer and exciting adventures had followed.The most wonderful thing of all had been the finding of the shabby old trunk in the attic whose contents of rare old coins and postage stamps had brought Billie in nearly five thousand dollars in cash. The money had enabled Billie to replace a statue which she had accidentally broken a little while before and had also given her the chance to go to Three Towers Hall, a good boarding school, and Chet the opportunity to go to the Boxton Military Academy, which was only a little over a mile from Three Towers Hall.In North Bend, where the girls had always lived, there lived also two other girls, Amanda Peabody and Eliza Dilks. These girls were sneaks and tattletales of the worst order and were thoroughly disliked by all the girls and boys with whom they had come in contact.When the chums had heard that Amanda was to accompany them to Three Towers they were absolutely dismayed, for they expected that she would spoil all the fun. Amanda had done her best to live up to the expectations of the girls, but try as she would, she had not been able to spoil entirely the fun. And this very failure had, of course, made her and her chum, Eliza Dilks, furious.Both Three Towers Hall and Boxton Military Academy had been built on the banks of the beautiful Lake Molata, and the girls and boys had spent many happy hours rowing upon the lake in the fall and skating upon it in the winter.But the most amazing thing that had happened to them at Three Towers had been the capture of the man the girls called ""The Codfish."" This rascal had attempted to steal Billie's precious trunk in the beginning, but Billie and the boys had given chase in an automobile and had succeeded in recovering the trunk. They had also succeeded in getting a good look at the man, whose hair was red, eyes little and close together, mouth wide and loose-lipped. It was this last feature that had given the thief his name with the boys and girls. For the mouth certainly resembled that of a codfish.Later the ""Codfish"" had turned up again near Three Towers Hall, had robbed one of the teachers of her purse when she was returning from town, and had later succeeded in making off with a great many valuables from Boxton Military Academy.The girls never forgot how, with the aid of the boys, they had captured the Codfish and turned him over to the police. Though, as Laura said, the thief had been in jail for some time, the chums had never stopped thinking and wondering about him. But never before had the possibility of his escaping been thought of.They glanced often and uneasily into the shadowy woodland and drew closer together as if for protection. The rain was beginning to come a little faster now, and their clothes felt damp. Even Billie's courage was beginning to fail.""It isn't apt to be the Codfish,"" returned Billie. ""But whoever it is, I think we'd better be careful. We'll go up to it softly and look about a bit. Please don't any one speak until we're sure it's all right."""
"It was a strange thing and strangely made, this remote little shelter in the woods. It probably had some sort of framework of wood inside, but all the girls could see from the outside was a rude structure entirely covered by moss and interwoven twigs. In fact, unless one looked closely, one might think that the little hut was no hut at all, but part of the foliage itself.The girls could find no windows, but as they moved cautiously around the hut Billie came upon a small door. The latter was hardly more than four feet high, and the girls would have to stoop considerably to get through it.If all wishes could be fulfilled as quickly as that of Laura's there would be few unsatisfied people in the world, for before it was out of her mouth Billie uttered a sharp cry of pain, and, lifting a smarting ankle in her hand, began to rub it gently.""Oh for goodness sake, keep still,"" cried Billie, from which it will be seen that Billie was not in the best of tempers. ""This place must be full of stuff. Goodness, why didn't we think to bring matches with us!""""So that's what you found--matches,"" cried Billie joyfully, while Laura just kept on gaping. ""Oh, Vi, you're a darling, and I forgive you for scaring us almost to death. Come on, light another one so we can see where we are.""Vi obediently lighted another match, a box of which she had found quite by accident, and the girls looked about them curiously. And as they looked their curiosity and wonder grew. Billie was wild with impatience when the match in Vi's hand flickered and went out again.The match flared up in Billie's hand, and this time it was her turn to make a discovery. The discovery was a pair of thick white candles, each set in a white china dish and pushed to one end of a rudely-made table.The interior of the place was made of rough boards, rudely thrown together as if by an amateur. Why the person who had made the little cabin had not laid boards for his floor, nobody could tell. Perhaps he had run short of lumber or perhaps he preferred the hard earth floor.""No, we don't,"" said Laura shortly, wishing that the very mention of the Codfish would not send the cold chills all over her. ""Goodness, just listen to that rain,"" she added, shivering. ""I guess we're in for a night of it.""The noise that Vi had heard was a slow measured step that sounded to the girls' overwrought nerves more like the stealthy creeping of an animal than the tread of a man. But whoever or whatever it was, it was coming steadily toward the hut--that much was certain.Some one was coming through the door, some one who had to bend so much that for a startled moment the girls were not at all sure but what it was an animal, after all, and not a man that they had to reckon with.Then the visitor stood up and they saw with real relief that it was a man after all. As a matter of fact, after the first startled minute it was the newcomer who seemed frightened and the girls who tried to make him feel at home.He was a queer looking man. He was tall, over six feet, and so thin that the skin seemed to be drawn over the bones. His shoulders slumped and his arms hung loosely, whether from weariness or discouragement or laziness, the girls found it impossible to tell."
"But it was his eyes that they noticed even in that moment of excitement. They were big, much too big for his thin face, and so dark that they seemed deep-sunken. And the expression was something that the girls remembered long afterward. It was brooding, haunted, mysterious, with a little touch of wildness that frightened the girls. Yet his mouth was kind, very kind, and looking at it, the girls ceased to be afraid.Suppose the man was not quite right in his mind? She had a horror of crazy people. But what sane man would build himself a cabin in the woods like this in the first place, and then go roaming around in the rain without any protection?If he was not crazy he was probably a criminal of some sort, and neither thought made Billie feel very comfortable. Three girls alone in the woods with a crazy man or a criminal, with the darkness coming on----""No, I don't think it will stop raining for some time,"" he said, seeming to realize that Billie had asked a question which he had not answered. ""And it is getting pretty dark outside. You say you are lost?""Again the girls had that strange feeling of mystery surrounding the man. He walked over to the other end of the room and before the girls' amazed eyes took out what they had thought to be part of the table.Then the man asked quite a lot of other questions and the girls answered him as best they could. The man continued to look at them so queerly that Billie was convinced that there was something wrong with him. But what was it? Oh, if only the storm would let up, so they could start back to the school!The girls searched frantically about, knowing that their botany teacher would reprimand them if they did not bring back the ferns, and finally found them on the floor where somebody had brushed them in the excitement.While they had thought the man was still in the hut he had come softly up behind them and had overheard the last, at any rate, of what they had said. Billie, as usual, was the first to recover herself.""Goodness, I guess he must be a crazy criminal,"" thought Billie plaintively, as she and her chums followed their leader, stumbling on over rocks and roots that sometimes bruised their ankles painfully. ""I suppose there are some people that are both. Anyway, he must be a criminal, or he wouldn't have been so mad about my knowing his name.""The rest of that strange journey seemed interminable. There were times when the girls were sure the man who called himself Hugo Billings was not taking them toward Three Towers Hall at all. It seemed impossible that they could have wandered such a long way into the woods.Then suddenly their feet struck a hard-beaten path and they almost cried aloud with relief. For they recognized the path and knew that the open road was not far off. Once on the open road, they could find their way alone."
"""I won't go any farther with you,"" he said, and there was something in his manner of speaking that made them see again in imagination the tired slump of his shoulders, the wild, haunted look in his eyes. ""I don't like the road. But you can find it easily from here. Then turn to your right. Three Towers is hardly half a mile up the road. Good night.""He turned with abruptness and started back the way they had come. But impulsively Billie ran to him, calling to him to stop. Yet when he did stop and turned to look at her she had not the slightest idea in the world what she had intended to say--if indeed she had really intended to say anything.After that it did not take the girls long to reach the road. They felt, someway, as if they must have dreamed their adventure, it had all been so strange and unreal. And yet they knew they had never been more awake in their lives.For once the others were willing to do as the most timid of the trio wished, and they hurried along in silence till they saw, with hearts full of thankfulness, the lights of Three Towers Hall shine out on the road before them.""I've heard of people being lost before,"" said Billie, as they ran up the steps that led to the handsomest door in the world, or at least so they thought it at that moment. ""But now I know that what they said about it wasn't half bad enough.""But Laura was wrong. The girls did really believe the story of Hugo Billings and the hut and became tremendously excited about it. At first they were all for making up an expedition and going to see it--the only drawback being that the chums could not have directed them to it if they would.And they would not have wished to, anyway. They had rather good reason to believe that Hugo Billings would not want a lot of curious girls spying about his quarters, and, being sorry for him and grateful to him for helping them out of their fix, they absolutely refused to have anything to do with the idea.They were late for supper, but that only made their appetites better, and as they were favorites of the cook they were given an extra share of everything and ate ravenously, impatient of the questions flung at them by the curious girls.For the ""Dill Pickles"" were two elderly spinsters who had been teachers at Three Towers Hall when Billie and her chums had first arrived. Their tartness and strictness and miserliness had made the life of the girls in the school uncomfortable for some time.And then had come the climax. Miss Walters, having been called away for a week or two, Miss Ada Dill and Miss Cora Dill, disrespectfully dubbed by the girls the twin ""Dill Pickles,"" had things in their own hands and proceeded to make the life of the girls unbearable. They had taken away their liberty, and then had half starved them by cutting down on the meals until finally the girls had rebelled.With Billie in the lead, they had marched out of Three Towers Hall one day, bag and baggage, to stay in a hotel in the town of Molata until Miss Walters should get back. Miss Walters, coming home unexpectedly, had met the girls in town, accompanied them back to Three Towers and, as one of the girls slangily described it, ""had given the Dill Pickles all that was coming to them.""In other words, the Misses Dill had been discharged and the girls had come off victorious. Now there were two new teachers in their place who were as different from the Dill Pickles as night is from day. All the girls loved them, especially a Miss Arbuckle who had succeeded Miss Cora Dill in presiding over the dining hall."
"After they had eaten all they could possibly contain, the girls retired to their dormitories, where they changed their clothes, still damp from their adventure, for comfortable, warm night gowns, and held court, all the girls gathering in their dormitory to hear of their adventures, for nearly an hour.At the end of that time the bell for ""lights-out"" rang, and the chums found to their surprise that for once they were not sorry. What with the adventure itself and the number of questions they had answered, they were tired out and longed for the comfort of their beds. It was the spring of the year, a time when every normal boy and girl becomes restless for new scenes, new adventures. The girls at Three Towers Hall heard the mysterious call and longed through hot days of study to respond to it.The teachers felt the restlessness in the air and strove to keep the girls to their lessons by making them more interesting. But it was of no use. The girls studied because they had to, not, except in a few scattered cases, because they wanted to.One of the exceptions to the rule was Caroline Brant, a natural student and a serious girl, who had set herself the rather hopeless task of watching over Billie Bradley and keeping her out of scrapes. For Billie, with her love of adventure and excitement, was forever getting into some sort of scrape.But these days it would have taken half a dozen Caroline Brants to have kept Billie in the traces. Billie was as wild as an unbroken colt, and just as impatient of control. And Laura and Vi were almost as bad.But the thing that set their blood racing was the thought of what was in store for them after they had gained their freedom. Connie Danvers had given the girls an invitation to visit during their vacation her father's bungalow on Lighthouse Island, a romantic spot off the Maine coast.The chums had written to their parents about spending their vacation on the island, and the latter had consented on one condition. And that condition was that the girls should make a good record for themselves at Three Towers Hall. And it is greatly to be feared that it was only this unreasonable--to the girls--condition that kept them at their studies at all.It was Saturday morning, and Billie, all alone in one of the study halls, was finishing her preparation for Monday's classes. She always got rid of this task on Saturday morning, so as to have her Saturday afternoon and Sunday free. She had never succeeded in winning Laura and Vi over to her method, so that on their part there was usually a wild scramble to prepare Monday's lessons on Sunday afternoon.As Billie, books in hand and a satisfied feeling in her heart, came out of the study room, she very nearly ran into Miss Arbuckle. Miss Arbuckle seemed in a great hurry about something, and the tip of her nose and her eyes were red as though she had been crying.""Why, what's the matter?"" asked Billie, for Billie was not at all tactful when any one was in trouble. Her impulse was to jump in and help, whether one really wanted her help or not. But everybody that knew Billie forgave her her lack of tact and loved her for the desire to help.""I wish you could,"" said Miss Arbuckle, with a little sigh. ""But that would be too good to be true. It was only an old family album, Billie. But there were pictures in it that I prize above everything I own. Oh, well,"" she gave a little shrug of her shoulders as if to end the matter. ""I'll get over it. I've had to get over worse things. But,"" she smiled and patted Billie's shoulder fondly, ""I didn't mean to burden your young shoulders with my troubles. Just run along and forget all about it."""
"""Funny thing to get so upset about,"" she said to herself, as she slowly climbed the steps to her dormitory. ""A picture album! I don't believe I'd ever get my nose and eyes all red over one. Just the same, I'd like to find it and give it back to her. Good Miss Arbuckle! After the Dill Pickles, she seems like an angel.""Laura and Vi and a dark-haired, pink-cheeked girl were sitting on one of the beds in one corner of the dormitory, alternately talking and gazing dreamily out of the window to Lake Molata, where it gleamed and shimmered in the morning sunlight at the end of a sloping lawn.The dark-haired, pink-cheeked girl was Rose Belser. Rose Belser, being jealous of Billie's immense popularity at Three Towers Hall the term before, had done her best to get the new girl into trouble, only to be won over to Billie's side in the end. Now she was as firm a friend of Billie's as any girl in Three Towers Hall.""Well!"" was Laura's greeting as Billie sauntered toward them. ""Methinks 'tis time you arrived, sweet damsel. Goodness!"" she added, dropping her lazy tone and sitting up with a bounce, ""I don't see why you have to go and spoil the whole morning with your beastly old studying. Think of the fun we could have had.""""Well, but think of the fun we're going to have this afternoon,"" Billie flung back airily, stopping before the mirror to tuck some wisps of hair into place, while the girls, even Rose, who was as pretty as a picture herself, watched her admiringly. ""It's almost lunch time.""""Say, she's calling us names again,"" cried Laura, making a dive for Billie. But Billie was already flying down the steps two at a time, and when Billie once got a head start, no one, at least no one in Three Towers Hall, had a chance of catching up with her.It seemed to be Billie's day for bumping into people--for at the foot of the stairs she had to clutch the banister to keep from colliding with Miss Walters, the beautiful and much loved head of the school.""Why yes, don't you remember?"" she said. ""We had it in English class the other day. Incorrigible means wicked, you know--bad. You can't reform 'em, you know--incorrigibles."" The last word was mumbled through a mouthful of soup.A little while later the girls swung joyfully out upon the road, bound for town and shopping and perhaps some ice cream and--oh, just a jolly good time of the kind girls know so well how to have, especially in the spring of the year.""Because,"" said Billie, her cheeks aglow with the heat and exercise, her brown hair clinging in little damp ringlets to her forehead, and her eyes bright with health and the love of life, ""then she could have had a good time to-day instead of staying at home in a stuffy room and writing a cartload of letters. She says if she doesn't write them, she'll never dare face her friends when she gets home."""
"""She's a darling,"" said Laura, executing a little skip in the road that sent the dust flying all about them. ""Just think--if we hadn't met her we wouldn't be looking forward to Lighthouse Island and a dear old uncle who owns the light----""Connie Danver's Uncle Tom attended the lighthouse, and, living there all the year around, had become as much of a fixture as the island itself. Connie loved this uncle of hers, and had told the girls enough about him to rouse their curiosity and make them very eager to meet him.""I wonder why,"" she said, as she turned slowly away in response to the urging of the girls, ""nothing ever seems the same in the sunlight. The other night when we were running along that path we were scared to death, and now----""First they went shopping. Laura had need of a ribbon girdle. Although they all knew that a blue one would be bought in the end, as blue was the color that would go best with the dress with which the girdle was to be worn, the merits and beauties of a green one and a lavender one were discussed and comparisons made with the blue one over and over, all from very love of the indecision and, more truly, the joy that looking at the dainty, pretty colors gave them.""Yes,"" added Teddy, putting his hand in his pocket, ""just hear the money jingle. A nice big check from Dad in just appreciation of his absent son! What do you girls say to an ice-cream spree? No less than three apiece, with all this unwonted wealth.""It was just as well that they had made this decision, for the sun was beginning to sink in the west and the supper hour at Three Towers Hall was rather early. As they started toward home, having said good-bye to the boys, the girls quickened their pace.It was not till they were nearing the path which, to Billie at least, had been surrounded by a mysterious halo since the adventure of the other night that the girls slowed up. Then it was Billie who did the slowing up.""Girls,"" she said in a hushed voice, ""I suppose you'll laugh at me, but I'd just love to follow that path into the woods a little way. You don't need to come if you don't want to. You can wait for me here in the road.""""Oh, no,"" said Laura, with a little sigh of resignation. ""If you are going to be crazy we might as well be crazy with you. Come on, Vi, if we didn't go along, she would probably get lost all over again--just for the fun of it.""She went only as far as the end of the path, and when the other girls reached her she was peering off into the forest as if she hoped to see the mysterious hut--although she knew as well as Laura and Vi that they had walked some distance through the woods the other night before they had finally reached the path.But Billie's eyes were shining, and she was all eagerness as she picked the old-fashioned volume up and began turning over the pages. She was thinking of poor Miss Arbuckle's red nose and eyes of that morning and of how different the teacher's face would look when she, Billie, returned the album.""Well, I wish I knew what you were talking about,"" said Vi plaintively, and Billie briefly told of her meeting with Miss Arbuckle in the morning and of the teacher's grief at losing her precious album.""Silly, it doesn't make any difference how old it is,"" said Vi as they started back along the path, Billie holding on tight to the book. ""It may have pictures in it she wants to save. It may be--what is it they call 'em?--an heirloom or something. And Mother says heirlooms are precious."""
"""Well, I know one that isn't,"" said Laura, with a little grimace. ""Mother has a wreath made out of hair of different members of the family. She says it's precious, too; but I notice she keeps it in the darkest corner of the attic.""""But how did she come to lose it there?"" asked Laura, as the road could be seen dimly through the trees. ""The woods seem a funny place. Girls,"" and Laura's eyes began to shine excitedly, ""it's a mystery!""""Why, it does seem kind of queer,"" Billie admitted, adding quickly as Laura was about to turn upon Vi with a whoop of triumph. ""But I don't think it's very mysterious. Probably Miss Arbuckle just wanted to be alone or something, and so she brought the album out into the woods to look it over by herself. I like to do it sometimes myself--with a book I mean. Just sneak off where nobody can find me and read and read until I get so tired I fall asleep.""""Well, but you can't look at pictures in a shabby old album until you feel so tired you fall asleep,"" grumbled Laura, feeling like a cat that has just had a saucer of rich cream snatched from under its nose. ""You girls wouldn't know a mystery if you fell over it.""""Maybe not,"" admitted Billie good-naturedly, her face brightening as she added, contentedly: ""But I do know one thing, and that is that Miss Arbuckle is going to be very glad when she sees this old album again!""And she was right. When they reached Three Towers Hall Laura and Vi went upstairs to the dormitory to wash up and get ready for supper while Billie stopped at Miss Arbuckle's door, eager to tell her the good news at once.She rapped gently, and, receiving no reply, softly pushed the door open. Miss Arbuckle was standing by the window looking out, and somehow Billie knew, even before the teacher turned around, that she had been crying again.The tired droop of the shoulders, the air of discouragement--suddenly there flashed across Billie's mind a different picture, the picture of a tall lank man with stooped shoulders and dark, deep-set eyes, looking at her strangely.Perhaps because they both seemed so very sad. Yes, that must be it. Then her face brightened as she felt the bulky album under her arm. Here was something that would make Miss Arbuckle smile, at least.""Oh, it's--it's you,"" she stammered, adding with an apologetic smile that made her look more natural: ""I'm a little nervous to-day--a little upset. What is it, Billie? Why didn't you knock?"" The last words were said in Miss Arbuckle's calm, slightly dry voice, and Billie began to feel more natural herself. She had been frightened when Miss Arbuckle swung around upon her.""I did,"" she answered. ""Knock, I mean. But you didn't hear me. I found something of yours, Miss Arbuckle."" Her eyes fell to the volume she still carried under her arm, and Miss Arbuckle, following the direction of her gaze, recognized her album."
"She gave a little choked cry, and her face grew so white that Billie ran to her, fearing she hardly knew what. But she had no need to worry, for although fear sometimes kills, joy never does, and in a minute Miss Arbuckle's eager hands were clutching the volume, her fingers trembling as they rapidly turned over the leaves.""Yes, here they are, here they are,"" she cried suddenly, and Billie, peeping over her shoulder, looked down at the pictured faces of three of the most beautiful children she had ever seen. ""My darlings, my darlings,"" Miss Arbuckle was saying over and over again. Then suddenly her head dropped to the open page and her shoulders shook with the sobs that tore themselves from her.""My little children!"" Miss Arbuckle cried out sobbingly. ""My precious little babies! I couldn't lose your pictures after losing you. They were all I had left of you, and I couldn't lose them, I couldn't--I couldn't----""Billie opened the door, and, stepping out into the hall, closed it softly after her. She brushed her hand across her eyes, for there were tears in them, and her feet felt shaky as she started up the stairs.""Well, I--I never!"" she told herself unsteadily. ""First she nearly scares me to death. And then she cries and talks about her children, and says she's lost them. Goodness, I shouldn't wonder but that Laura is right after all. There certainly is something mighty strange about it.""""That's all right,"" said Laura, in response to the girls' gibes. ""I'll get in some clever work, with nothing but a silly old photograph album as a clue, or a motive--oh, well, I don't know just what the album is yet, but an album is worse than commonplace, it is plumb foolish as a center around which to work. Oh, ho! Great Lady Detective! Solves most marvelous and intricate mystery with only the slightest of clues, an old photograph album, to point the way! Oh, ho!""The head of Boxton Military Academy was Captain Shelling, a splendid example of army officer whom all the students loved and admired. They did not know it, but there was not one of the boys in the school who did not hope that some day he might be like Captain Shelling.The girls knew that visitors were allowed, and they were beginning to wonder a little uneasily whether they were to be invited or not when one afternoon the boys turned up and settled the question for them very satisfactorily.It was Saturday afternoon, just a week after the finding of Miss Arbuckle's album, and the girls, Laura, Billie, Vi and Connie, were wandering arm in arm about the beautiful campus of Three Towers Hall when a familiar hail came to them from the direction of the road.For while they had been at the Academy, the boys had made a friend. His name was Paul Martinson, and he was tall and strongly built and--yes, even Billie had to admit it--almost as good looking as Teddy!"
"If Billie said that about any one it was pretty sure to be true. For Billie and Teddy Jordon had been chums and playmates since they could remember, and Billie had always been sure that Teddy must be the very best looking boy in the world, not even excepting her brother Chet, of whom she was very fond.But Billie was not the only one who had found Paul Martinson good looking. Connie had liked him, and had said innocently one day after the boys had gone that Paul Martinson looked like the hero in a story book she was reading.As for Paul Martinson, he had shown a liking for Billie that somehow made Teddy uncomfortable. Teddy was very much surprised to find how uncomfortable it did make him. Billie was a ""good little chum and all that, but that didn't say that another fellow couldn't speak to her."" But just the same he had acted so queerly two or three times lately that Billie had bothered him exceedingly asking him what the matter with him was and telling him to ""cheer up, it wasn't somebody's funeral, you know."" Billie had been puzzled over his answer to that. He had muttered something about ""it's not anybody's funeral yet, maybe, but everything had to start sometime.""When Billie had innocently told Laura about it she was still more puzzled at the way Laura had acted. Instead of being sensible, she had suddenly buried her face in the pillow--they had been sitting on Billie's bed, exchanging confidences--and fairly shook with laughter.""Well, what in the world----"" Billie had begun rather resentfully, when Laura had interrupted her with an hysterical: ""For goodness sake, Billie, I never thought you could be so dense. But you are. You're absolutely crazy, and so is Teddy, and so is everybody!""But when they reached the dock there was never a craft of any kind to be seen except those far out upon the glistening water of the lake. Of course the beautiful weather was responsible for this, for all the girls who had not lessons to do or errands in town had made a bee line--as Ferd Stowing expressed it--straight down to the lake.""Oh, well, this will do,"" said Teddy, sitting down on the edge of the little dock so that his feet could hang over and reaching up a hand for Billie. ""Come along, everybody. We can look at the water, anyway.""The girls and boys scrambled down obediently and there was great excitement when Connie's foot slipped and she very nearly tumbled into the lake. Paul Martinson steadied her, and she thanked him with a little blush that made Laura look at her wickedly.""How beautifully pink your complexion is in the warm weather, Connie,"" she said innocently, adding with a little look that made Connie want to shake her: ""It can't be anything _but_ the heat, can it? You haven't a fever, or something?""""Say, stop your rowing, girls, and listen to me,"" Teddy interrupted, picking a pebble from the dock and throwing it far out into the gleaming water, where it dropped with a little splash. ""Our famous parade of cadets comes off next week. You're going to be on deck, aren't you?"" The great day came at last and found the girls in a fever of mingled excitement and fear. Excitement because of the great advent; fear, because the sky had been overcast since early morning and it looked as if the whole thing might have to be postponed on account of rain.""And if there is anything I hate,"" complained Laura, moving restlessly from her mirror over to the window and back again, ""it's to be all prepared for a thing and then have it spoiled at the last minute by rain."""
"""Well, I guess you don't hate it any more than the rest of us,"" said Billie, her thoughts on the pretty pink flowered dress she had decided to wear to the parade. It was not only a pretty dress, but was very becoming. Both Teddy and Chet had told her so. ""And the boys would be terribly disappointed,"" she added.""Now I know you're a joy killer,"" she said; ""for if Amanda Peabody and The Shadow (the name the girls had given Eliza Dilks because she always followed Amanda as closely as a shadow does) succeeded in getting themselves invited to any sort of affair where we girls were to be, they would be sure to do something annoying.""""They are going to be there, just the same,"" said Billie, and the two girls looked at her in surprise. ""They told me so,"" she said, in answer to the unspoken question. ""They have some sort of relatives among the boys at the Academy, and these relatives didn't have sense enough not to invite them.""""Humph!"" grunted Laura, ""Amanda probably hinted around till the boys couldn't help inviting her. Look--oh, look!"" she cried in such a different tone that the girls stared at her. ""The sun!"" she said. ""Oh, it's going to clear up, it's going to clear up!""The girls had an hour in which to get ready, and they were ready and waiting before half that time was up. The Three Towers Hall carryall was to call for the girls who had been lucky enough to receive invitations from the cadets of Boxton Military Academy, and as the girls, looking like gay-colored butterflies in their summery dresses, gathered on the steps of the school there were so many of them that it began to look as if the carryall would have to make two trips.For Amanda and her chum were dressed in their Sunday best--poplin dresses with a huge, gorgeous flower design that made the pretty, delicate-colored dresses of the other girls look pale and washed-out by comparison. If Amanda's and Eliza's desire was to be the most noticeable and talked-of girls on the parade, they were certainly going to succeed. The talk had begun already!""Girls,"" she cried, ""stop your quarreling. Look! We're at the Academy. And--look--look----"" Words failed her, and she just stared wonderingly at the sight that met her eyes. It was true, none of them had ever seen anything like it before.Booths of all sorts and colors were distributed over the parade ground, leaving free only the part where the cadets were to march. Girls in bright-colored dresses and boys in trim uniforms were already walking about making brilliant patches of color against the green of the parade ground.There were girls and matrons in the costume of French peasants wandering in and out among the visitors, carrying little baskets filled with ribbon-tied packages. Some of these packages contained candy, some just little foolish things to make the young folks laugh, favors to take away with them and remember the day by.The parade of cadets was the most wonderful part of it all, of course, and the girls stood through it, their hearts beating wildly, a delicious wave of patriotism thrilling to their finger tips. And when it was over the girls looked at Teddy and Chet and Ferd and Paul with a new respect that the boys liked but did not understand at all."
"""Yes, I noticed you were here first,"" the woman answered, and handed Billie her ice cream over Eliza's head while Eliza, with a glance at Billie that should have killed her on the spot, turned sullenly and walked away.And indeed what could have been better fun than this dance on a smooth floor so large that it did not seem crowded, to the best of music, with a partner who was a perfect dancer, and--though Billie did not say this to herself--by a girl who was herself as light and graceful a dancer as was on the floor?All things must end, even the most perfect day in a lifetime, as Vi called it, and finally the girls had been tucked into the carryall and were once more back at Three Towers Hall, ready, with a new day, to take up the routine of school life once more.The graduates were running around excitedly in the last preparations for graduation with the strange look on their young faces that most graduates have, half exultation at the thought of their success, half grief at being forced to leave the school, the friends they had made, the scenes they had loved.Just the day before the one set for graduation Teddy ran over to tell the girls some wonderful news. He was able to see only Billie, for the other girls had been busy with their lessons. But that was very satisfactory to Teddy.""Paul Martinson's father gave him a beautiful big motor boat--a cruising motor boat,"" she told the girls. ""Paul got the highest average in his class this term, you know, and his father has given him the motor boat as a sort of prize.""""It hasn't much to do with us,"" said Billie, her face pink with excitement. ""But it has a great deal to do with the boys. Paul Martinson has asked Chet and Ferd and Teddy to go with him and his father on a cruise this summer.""""Oh, but that's just what it doesn't mean!"" Billie interrupted eagerly. ""Don't you see? Why, Teddy said that it would be the easiest thing in the world to stop off at Lighthouse Island some time and see us girls.""They did not have as much time to think about it as they would have liked, however, in the busy excited hours that followed. Right after the graduating exercises all the girls were to start for their homes, except the few who expected to spend the summer at Three Towers Hall.Many of the relatives and friends of the graduates were expected, so that preparations had to be made for them also. The graduating exercises were to be held earlier at Boxton Military Academy than at Three Towers Hall, so that the three North Bend boys hoped to get away in time to attend--not the exercises themselves--but the singing on the steps of Three Towers Hall by all the students of the school, which was one of the most important parts of the ceremony.The exercises that had been looked forward to for so long and that had taken weeks of preparation to perfect, were over at last. The graduates realized with a sinking of the heart that they were no longer students of Three Towers Hall.There was still the mass singing on the steps, to be sure, but that was simply the last barrier to be crossed before they stepped out on the open road, leaving Three Towers Hall with its pleasing associations behind them forever.As the girls, in their simple white dresses, gathered on the steps of the school with the visitors, fathers and mothers and boys in uniform, scattered about on the campus below them, and began to sing in their clear, girlish voices, there was hardly a dry eye anywhere.""Billie,"" said the teacher hurriedly, ""I have never thanked you rightly for the great favor you did in returning my album to me. But I love you for it, dear. God bless you,"" and before Billie could think of a word to say in reply, the teacher had turned, slipped through one of the doors and disappeared.Billie stood staring after Miss Arbuckle, lost in thought about her, until Laura and Vi, hurrying up, caught her by the arm and hustled her through the front door, down the steps and into the waiting carryall. The carryall, by the way, was to make many trips that day, even though a great many of the girls had automobiles belonging to their relatives or friends which would take them straight to their destination.""Good-bye, Three Towers, for a little time, at least,"" cried Billie, while she felt a curious lump in her throat. She was terribly afraid she was going to cry, so she stopped talking and turned to stare out of the window."
"""You bet--he's some boy,"" added Teddy heartily, forgetting for the moment that there had been times when he had longed to throw Paul Martinson into the lake--or some deeper place--because he had talked too much to Billie.But here was a beautiful long train ride before him when he could talk to Billie--or any one else--all he liked without having any Paul Martinson trying to ""butt in"" all the time. No wonder he was friends with all the world.""He went home with his dad,"" Chet explained. ""Of course he was crazy to see his motor boat, and then he had to make arrangements for our cruise. Oh boy, think of cruising around the coast in a motor boat!""""That reminds me,"" said Laura, turning upon Billie accusingly. ""What were you doing standing in the hall just now and looking as though you had lost your last friend when Vi and I came along and woke you up? Come on, 'fess up.""She leaned far out the window, smiled and waved her hand to the man, who was standing moodily by the roadside. At sight of her he straightened up and an answering smile flashed across his thin face, making him look so different that the girls were amazed. A few hours later a train puffed noisily into the familiar station at North Bend, and as it came to a stop three boys and three girls tumbled down the steps of a car and literally ran into the arms of their waiting families.At least, the girls did; the boys considered themselves far too dignified. However, they soon forgot dignity and everything else in a noisy and joyful recital of all the good times they had had during their year of absence.Of course there had been others from the Military Academy and Three Towers Hall on the train whose friends and relatives had also come to meet them so that it was a very much excited crowd that wound its way up the ordinarily quiet main street of North Bend.Gradually the crowd separated into little groups, each going its separate way to its separate home, and so at last, after many promises between the boys and girls to ""call each other up right after dinner,"" the Bradley family found itself alone.""Well,"" said Mr. Bradley, beaming proudly upon his children, who seemed to him to have grown at least twice as large during their absence, and three times as handsome, ""you thought you _would_ come back to your poor old country relations, did you? Your mother and I,"" he glanced fondly at his wife, ""thought perhaps you had forgotten us by this time.""""We weren't very much worried, though,"" said Mrs. Bradley, looking so lovely in her happiness that Billie had to snuggle close to her to make sure she was real. For Mrs. Bradley was really a very beautiful woman, as well as a very sweet one, and Billie was growing more like her every day.""And there's the darling old house,"" breathed Billie happily, ""looking just the same as it did when I left it. Mother dear, and, Dad----"" here she reached a hand out to her father----""I think I'm the very happiest girl in all the world.""For a day or two after that it seemed the best thing in the world just to be at home again. But the third day the girls began to feel a little bit restless. They were longing to be off to Lighthouse Island with Connie Danvers. But they had not heard from Connie yet, and until they did there was nothing to be done but get things in shape and wait.""Certainly not,"" was Billie's quick reply. ""Connie isn't that kind of a girl. Besides all the arrangements have been made. It is more than likely she has been so busy with a number of details that she has simply forgotten to write or telegraph."""
"Then one day, over a week later, when they had begun to think that Connie had forgotten about them, a telegram came from her, saying that she was starting for North Bend the day after the next and she would be in on the six o'clock train. Would somebody please be there to meet her? Her mother and father had gone on ahead to Lighthouse Island to get everything ready for the girls when they arrived.Would they be there to meet her! Billie was so excited that she couldn't eat her supper, and as soon as she could get away from the table she rushed over to Laura's home to tell her the joyful news. From there the pair called up Vi and invited her to come and celebrate.""I know,"" said Mrs. Jordon, putting an arm lightly about her young daughter's shoulders. ""I was the same way at your age, dear. Mother had to send away my friends and put me to bed regularly every week or so. Now it's my turn, that's all.""For some reason or other they did not talk very much. They did not seem to find anything to say. Billie had never been alone like this with Teddy before, and she was wondering why it made her tongue-tied.""I say, Billie,"" began Teddy, clearing his throat and looking down at her sideways--for all the world, as Billie thought, as if she were a mouse trap and might go off any minute--""is it really settled that you are going to start day after to-morrow?""""Yes. And isn't it wonderful?"" cried Billie, finding her voice as the blissful prospect opened up before her again. ""I've never stayed at the seashore more than a day or two, Teddy, in my life, and now just think of spending the whole summer there. I can't believe yet that it isn't a dream.""""Oh, of course I know all about that,"" returned Billie, with the air of one who could not possibly be taught anything. ""Connie says her Uncle Tom knows of a darling little inlet where the water's so calm it's almost like a swimming pool. Of course we'll do most of our swimming there. Oh, Teddy, you ought to see my new bathing suit!"" She was rattling on rapturously when Teddy interrupted with a queer sort of question.""Why no. That is, I don't think so,"" answered Billie, knitting her brows in an effort to think whether Connie had ever said anything on this point. She had never even thought to ask if ""Uncle Tom"" was married. ""Why, no, of course he can't be,"" she answered herself and Teddy at the same time. ""If he was married he wouldn't be living in that old lighthouse all alone. And Connie said he did live there all alone. I remember that."""
"She nodded her head with satisfaction, but, strangely enough, Teddy did not seem to be satisfied at all. He just stalked along beside her in a sort of gloomy silence while she glanced up at him now and then with a mischievous hint of a laugh dancing about her pretty mouth.""Teddy, where are you going?"" she asked a minute later, as they reached the sidewalk that led to her house and instead of stopping Teddy stalked straight on. ""I don't live down at the corner you know.""""No wonder you went past,"" said Billie mischievously. Then as they paused at the foot of the steps she looked up at him with an imp of laughter showing all the dimples about her mouth. ""What were you thinking so hard about, Teddy?"" she dared him.Then he fled, leaving Billie to get into the house as best she could. But Billie did not mind. She was chuckling to herself and thinking how funny and foolish and--yes--awfully nice Teddy could be--sometimes.Billie was in a fever of excitement even before the stream of people began to pour from the train, and when she saw Connie she made a wild dash for her that very nearly bowled over a couple of unfortunate men who were in the path.Poor Chet tried his best to edge his way in and speak a word to Connie on his own account--for Chet liked Connie Danvers very much--but he could not do any more than shake hands with her over Billie's shoulder and mumble one or two words which neither of the girls understood.""They won't speak to you,"" he grumbled to himself as he brought up the rear with Connie's suitcase and a hat box, ""and the only time they know you're alive is when they want a baggage truck or something. Catch me ever coming to meet one of Billie's friends again.""He was relieved when Vi and Laura came running up all flushed with their hurry to ""spill over Connie"" some more, as Chet disgustedly put it and he had a chance to slip down a side street and ""beat it"" for home.""Connie, you do look sweet,"" Vi cried, as they all four tried to walk abreast along a sidewalk that was not very wide--the result being that Laura, who was on the end, walked half the time on the curb and the rest of the time in the gutter. ""Is that a new hat? And, oh, I know you've got a new dress!""""Oh, we are a mess,"" said Laura, balancing nicely between the curb and the gutter. ""We've got on our oldest dresses because everything we own is packed except the things we're going to wear to-morrow.""""To-morrow!"" That was the magic word that unlocked the gates and let through a flood of conversation consisting of excited questions and answers and joyful exclamations that lasted until they reached Billie's house.""I'll say so,"" Billie sang back gayly, and then led her guest up the porch steps and into the house, where her mother was waiting to receive them. Mrs. Bradley and Connie fell in love with each other at first sight--which was the last thing needed to make Billie absolutely happy.Then they talked of the things that had happened at Three Towers Hall--of the ""Dill Pickles"" and of Amanda Peabody and Eliza Dilks. And last, but not least, they talked in hushed tones of the mysterious little hut in the woods and the strange man who lived there and wove fern baskets and other things for a living.""It really must be a mystery,"" Connie was saying, snuggling deeper into the covers and staring at Billie's pretty face and tousled hair weirdly illumined by the pale moonlight that sifted through the window, when there came a tap on the door. And right upon the tap came Mrs. Bradley, wearing a loose robe that made her look mysteriously lovely in the dim light. She sat down on the edge of the bed and regarded the girls smilingly."
"""Then it's time you were,"" she said, adding, with a little laugh: ""If I hear a sound in here ten minutes from now, I'm coming after you with a broomstick. Remember,"" she added, laughing back at them from the doorway, ""I give you just ten minutes.""Five minutes passed, and the girls who could ""never go to sleep,"" felt their eyelids grow heavy and a delicious drowsiness steal over them. Once Connie roused herself enough to say sleepily: ""We'll just have to form that Detective Club, Billie, you know.""Fat Deborah, nicknamed ""Debbie,"" who had been the cook in the Bradley family for years, and who thought that gave her the right to tell the whole family what was expected of them, from Billie up to Mr. Bradley himself, cooked them a breakfast of ham and eggs and cereal and toast and corn bread, grumbling to herself all the time.""Scand'lous, I calls it,"" Debbie confided to the pan of corn bread she was busily cutting into golden brown pieces. ""Don' know what Miz Bradley 'lows she's thinkin' on, nohow. But these am scand'lous days--they sho is."" Whereupon she put on a white apron and her dignity and marched into the dining room.Yet in spite of her disapproval, Debbie gave the young ""scalawags"" the best breakfast she could make, and from the way the young ""scalawags"" did justice to it, one might have thought they did not expect to get any more to eat for a week at least.Then they went upstairs to pack bags with the last minute things. Billie and Connie went over the whole list backward to be sure they had not forgotten a toothbrush ""or something."" To them it was a very important list.And down they went, taking two steps at a time. Billie opened the door just as the two girls and Teddy came up the steps. Chet, who had run out, attracted by the noise, and was looking over Billie's shoulder, caught sight of Teddy and the load he carried and emitted a whoop of joy.The girls' trunks had been sent down the day before, so that all they had to do was to check them at the station. Connie, of course, had had her trunk checked right through to the station nearest their destination.""Oh, I'm so glad!"" cried Billie, her eyes shining. ""It will be a lark to have you boys drop in on us some morning when we don't expect you. Oh, it's just grand! We'll be sure to be watching for all of you.""""Aha!"" she cried triumphantly, waving the little brown rectangle aloft. ""Candy! Where'd you get it, Billie Bradley?"" She turned swiftly upon Billie, whose face was the color of a particularly gorgeous beet. Vi and Connie looked on delightedly.""Goodness! anybody would think it was a crime to have candy,"" cried Billie indignantly. ""You give it to me, Laura, or----"" She made a grab for her property, but Laura snatched it back out of her reach."
"Across the aisle from them there was a parrot--a great green and red parrot that at that moment was hanging by its claws to the roof of its cage and was still emitting the raucous squawks that sounded like the talking of a hundred pirates all rolled into one.She found what she was looking for--a heavy black cloth, and, with a sigh of relief, flung it across the cage. Immediately the parrot's uproar subsided to a muttering and a moment later stopped altogether.Passengers who had craned their necks dropped back in their seats chuckling, picked up magazines or papers or whatever they had been reading where they had left off, and peace settled over the car again. For all save the girls, that is.For the elderly woman--who most certainly _was_ an old maid--had been terribly embarrassed over the bird's outbreak and began explaining to the girls how she happened to have it in her possession, what troubles she had already had with it, how glad she would be when she delivered the bird to her brother, who was its rightful owner, and so on until the girls became desperate enough to throw things at her.""Isn't there some way we can stop her!"" whispered Vi in Connie's ear, while Billie and Laura were listening to the woman's chatter with forced smiles and polite ""yeses and nos."" ""If I have to listen to that voice another minute I'll scream--I know I shall.""""Thank goodness we've escaped,"" sighed Billie, as her eyes wandered eagerly down the bill of fare, for Billie was very hungry. ""What will you have, girls? I could eat everything on the card without stopping to breathe.""They bought magazines and tried to read them, but finally gave up the attempt. What was the use of reading about other people's adventures when a far more thrilling one was in store for them at Lighthouse Island?""Goodness, isn't that enough?"" said Billie, turning on her. ""Why, just being at the seashore is an adventure. Just think, I've never in my life been inside a really truly lighthouse. It's going to be just wonderful, Connie.""""And aren't the boys coming in their motor boat, too?"" added Vi eagerly. ""Why, they will probably take us for a sail around the point and everything. Connie, how can you say we're not going to have any adventures?""There was silence for a little while after that while the girls took up their magazines again and turned the pages listlessly. At the end of another half hour they gave up the attempt entirely and leaned their heads wearily against the backs of the seats, fixing their eyes upon the ever-changing scenery that fled past them.""For goodness sake, what made you think of that now?"" asked Laura a little peevishly. ""I'm so tired I don't want to form clubs or anything else. All I want is to get out somewhere where I can stretch my legs, get some supper, and go to bed. I'm dead."""
"""Oh, everything,"" answered Billie, getting more excited as she spoke. ""Hugo Billings in the first place. And then finding Miss Arbuckle's album in the woods. And the children. Girls, I'm just sure they are mysteries--and real ones, too.""""I'm just as sure as you are, Billie, that there's something funny about it,"" she said. ""But if we really had wanted to solve the mystery, we should have stayed at Three Towers. The first thing they do in detective stories is to shadow the people they suspect. And how can we do that, I'd like to know, when we're running straight away from them?""""Well, I think maybe we'll manage to enjoy ourselves, even without mysteries,"" said Billie gayly. Nevertheless, she could not help thinking to herself: ""Oh, dear, I do wish there was some way I could find out about Miss Arbuckle and those lovely children and poor lonely, sad Hugo Billings. I should like to help if I only knew how!""""What's the matter?"" she asked sleepily, but some one, she thought it was Laura, shook her impatiently, and some one else--she was wide awake enough now to be sure this was Vi--put a hat on her head and pushed it so far over her eyes that she temporarily went blind again.A little anger was the best thing that could have come to Billie. It was about the only thing in the world that would have gotten her wide awake just then. And it was very necessary that she should be wide awake, for the train was just drawing into the station where they were to get off to take the boat to Lighthouse Island.She took the bag thrust into her hands by Laura, and the girls hurried out into the aisle that was crowded with people. A minute more, and they found themselves on a platform down which people hurried and porters rolled their baggage trucks and where every one seemed intent upon making as much noise as possible.Billie and Laura and Vi felt very much bewildered, for they had never done any traveling except in the company of some older person; but with a confidence that surprised them, Connie took command of the situation. For Connie had traveled this route several times, and everything about it was familiar to her.""Give me your trunk checks,"" she ordered, adding, as the girls obediently fumbled in their pocketbooks: ""We'll have to hustle if we want to get our trunks straightened out and get on board ourselves before the boat starts. What's the matter, Vi, you haven't lost your check, have you?""The boat that plied from the mainland to Lighthouse Island and one or two more small islands scattered about near the coast was a small but tidy little vessel that was really capable of better speed than most people gave her credit for. She was painted a sort of dingy white, and large black letters along her bow proclaimed her to be none other than the _Mary Ann_.And now as the girls, with several other passengers, stepped on board and felt the cool breeze upon their faces they breathed deep of the salty air and gazed wonderingly out over the majestic ocean rolling on and on in unbroken swells toward the distant horizon.Gone was all the fatigue of the long train ride. They forgot that their lungs were full of soft coal dirt, that their hands were grimy, and their faces, too. They were completely under the spell of that great, mysterious tyrant--the ocean.""It will be worse than that after you've been here a little while,"" laughed Connie. ""Mother says that it seems as if she never can give me enough to eat when we come out to the seashore, so she has given up trying."""
"""That's the clams you smell,"" chuckled Connie. ""They always have some on board the _Mary Ann_ to sell to the islanders--if they haven't the sense to catch them themselves. We never need to buy any,"" she added, proudly. ""Uncle Tom keeps us supplied with all we want. Look!"" she cried suddenly, pointing to a small island which loomed directly ahead of them, looking in the grey mist of evening like only a darker shadow against the shifting background. ""That's our island--see? And there's the light,"" she added, as a sudden beacon flashed out at them, sending a ruddy light out over the dark water.""I should say there is,"" Connie answered gravely. ""In a storm especially. You see, the water is very shallow around here and if a big ship runs in too close to shore she's apt to get on a shoal. That isn't so bad in clear weather--although a ship did get stuck on the shoal here not so very long ago and she was pretty much damaged when they got her off. But in a storm----""""Why, Uncle Tom says,"" Connie was very serious, ""that if a ship were driven upon the shoal in a gale--and we have terrible storms around here--it would probably come with such force that its bottom would be pretty nearly crushed in and the people on board might die before any one could get out there to rescue them.""""No,"" said Connie. ""There was a terrible wreck here a long time ago--before they built the lighthouse. But Uncle Tom says no one will ever know just how many lives have been saved because of the good old light. To hear him talk to it you would think it was alive.""Connie led the way as she had done ever since they had left North Bend. She scrambled quickly out upon the pier and the chums, following more slowly, were in time to see Connie rapturously embrace first a lady and then a gentleman standing near by.""If you young ladies will give me your checks,"" he said--and the girls knew they were going to love him because his voice sounded so kind--""I'll attend to your trunks and you can go on up to the house.""It was really getting very dark, and the girls could not make out what she looked like, but they could see that she was small and graceful and her voice--well, her voice had a gay lilt that made one want to laugh even though all she said was ""what a pleasant day it is."" No wonder, with that father and mother, Connie was such a darling.""Why, no, we're not very tired,"" Billie said in answer to Mrs. Danvers' question. ""We were on the train, but the minute we got on board the boat we seemed to forget all about it. It's this beautiful salt air, I suppose,"" and she sniffed happily at the soft, salt-laden breeze that came wandering up from the sea.""You are right, there,"" said Connie. ""I remember only too well when I was on Chatter Island we had to climb over the rocks all the way, and one day I twisted my ankle most dreadfully--so badly, in fact, that I was laid up for three days while all the other girls were having the best time ever.""But the girls were not so much interested in what was on the island as they were in what was beyond it. The ocean--the great dark, mysterious ocean drew their eyes irresistibly and set their minds to wandering. And as the days passed they were to feel the spell of it more and more."
"""Be careful where you step,"" Mrs. Danvers called back to them, and the girls saw that she was picking her steps very carefully. ""There are two or three boards missing, and I can't get Mr. Danvers to do the repairing. He spends whole days,"" she added, turning plaintively to Connie, ""up in that old lighthouse just talking to your Uncle Tom. I don't know whether it's your Uncle Tom's conversation he finds so fascinating or his clam chowder.""She opened the door as she spoke and the girls had a vision of a comfortable, gayly lighted room all wicker chairs and chintz cushions and chintz hangings, a room pretty and cozy, a room that seemed to be beckoning and inviting the girls to come in and make themselves at home.Which they did--immediately. All except Billie, who stepped back a moment and gazed off through the dusk to the light in the lighthouse tower glowing its warning to the travelers over the dark highways of the sea.They found Mrs. Danvers and Laura and Vi in a large room as pretty and comfortable as the room downstairs, though not quite so elaborate. Laura and Vi were busily engaged in making themselves entirely at home.""So you're Billie Bradley,"" she said, her hazel eyes searching Billie's brown ones. ""Connie said you were the most popular girl at Three Towers and that all the girls loved you. I can't say that I blame them, my dear,"" giving Billie's flushed cheek a gay little pat. ""I'm not very sure but what I may do it myself. Now here----"" And she went on to give directions while Billie followed her with wondering eyes. How could a woman who was old enough to be Connie's mother look so absolutely and entirely like a girl of twenty? She was not even dignified like most of the mothers Billie knew--she did not even try to be. Connie treated her as she would an older and much loved sister. One only needed to be with them three minutes to see that mother and daughter adored each other and were the very best chums in the world. And right then and there Billie began adoring too.""Now I'll run downstairs and get something on the table for you girls to eat, for I know you must be starving,"" said Mrs. Danvers, or rather ""Connie's mother,"" as Billie called her from that day on. ""Don't stop to fix up, girls, for there won't be a soul here to-night but Daddy and me--and we don't care. Hurry now. If you are not downstairs by the time I have dinner on the table I'll eat it all myself, every bit."" With that she was gone into the next room, leaving a trail of laughter behind her that made Billie's heart laugh in sympathy.""Connie,"" she said, sitting down on the edge of the bed and regarding her chum soberly as she opened her bag and drew out a brush and comb, ""I'm simply crazy about your mother. She's so young and pretty and--and--happy. Does she ever do anything but laugh?""""Not often,"" said Connie, adding with a little chuckle: ""But when she does stop laughing you'd better look out for 'breakers ahead,' as Uncle Tom says. Mother's French you know, and she has a temper--about once a year. But for goodness sake, stop talking, Billie, and get ready. You've got a patch of dirt under one eye. What's that I smell? It's clam chowder!"""
"Connie was right, gloriously right. It was clam chowder--the kind of clam chowder one dreams about--come true. Uncle Tom had made it just that very afternoon and had brought it over in a huge bucket that was always used for such occasions.Connie's mother had served them other things beside clam chowder. There were pork chops and apple sauce, there were muffins and honey and apple pie, and when they had finished, the once full table looked as if a swarm of locusts had been at it.And now, having done his duty, he had sauntered into the dining room to get acquainted with the girls and smoke a cigar. He and Mrs. Danvers had had their dinner earlier, because, as Mrs. Danvers laughingly explained, ""she had been famished and could not wait,"" so that now there was nothing to do but watch the girls enjoy themselves.The dining room was like all the other rooms in the cottage, cheerful and cozy and tastefully furnished, and as the girls looked about them happily they felt that they must have known the house and its owners all their lives.Mr. Danvers was many years older than his wife, and he looked even older than he was. But he was a handsome man, and the touch of gray in the hair at his temples only made him look more distinguished. He adored his wife, and his eyes followed her wherever she went.They did not protest very much, for they were tired and the prospect of bed was very alluring. To-morrow--well, to-morrow they would go exploring. Perhaps they might even be permitted to visit the lighthouse and Uncle Tom. Speaking of Uncle Tom made Billie think of the clam chowder, and although she could not have eaten another scrap if she had tried, her mouth watered at the memory.""Oh, this feels good,"" sighed Billie, as Connie turned down the covers and she crawled thankfully into bed. ""I didn't know I was so awfully tired. And that dinner! Connie, does your mother always serve dinners like that?""""Yes,"" said Connie, flinging her thick braid over her shoulder and crossing the room to turn out the light. ""Mother's an awfully good cook, and although we have a maid to do the heavy work Mother does all the cooking herself.""""What a foolish thing to say,"" she cried. ""I'll shake you, Connie Danvers, if you ever say a thing like that again. We could have stayed at Three Towers if we had wanted to solve mysteries more than we wanted to come here, couldn't we?""""No,"" said Connie, with a shake of her head. ""Of course I didn't mean just that. Just the same,"" she added longingly, ""I am awfully anxious to find out about Miss Arbuckle and her album and--that strange man--everything.""""You perfectly silly goose,"" said Connie then, her bewilderment changing to indignation. ""Now I know who wants to be shaken. Lie down here, Billie, and see if you can act sensibly. Sorry I asked you!"" she exploded indignantly. ""Why, who ever heard of such a thing!"""
"""Well, of course I do. So do all the rest of you,"" Connie shot back. ""But as to being sorry I asked you, why, I've a good mind----"" She rose threateningly in the bed and Billie put out a pleading hand, saying with a chuckle:Then gradually the soft lapping of waves upon the beach soothed her into a sort of doze where tall thin men and shabby picture albums and queer little huts were all confused and jumbled together. Only one thing stood out clearly, and that was the great searchlight, twinkling, winking, glowing, sending its friendly message far out upon the sea. The next morning the girls were up with the sun. They were in hilarious spirits and made so much noise that Mrs. Danvers, busily getting breakfast in the kitchen below, smiled to herself and hugged a big collie that at that moment strolled leisurely into the room.The big collie's name was Bruce, and he belonged to Uncle Tom of the lighthouse. But although Uncle Tom was his master and was first in his dog's heart, Connie's mother was his very next best beloved and Bruce spent his time nearly equally between the lighthouse and Uncle Tom and the cottage and Connie's mother.""Bruce darling,"" said Connie's mother, as she lifted a pan of biscuits and shoved it into the oven, ""it's a perfectly gorgeous morning and a perfectly gorgeous world and you're a perfectly gorgeous dog. Now don't deny it. You know you are! How about it?""""Bruce, just suppose you had spoiled it!"" she scolded, as she slipped the pan into the oven after its fellow. ""Don't you know that I have four hungry girls to feed, to say nothing of a great big husband----""""Warm! Well, I should say I was!"" said Connie's mother, sweeping a stray lock of hair back out of her eyes. ""But what do I care when it's such a wonderful world? Haven't I got my baby back again, and three others as well? They're sweet girls, aren't they, John? And Billie Bradley is going to be a beauty.""""Well, I know some one else who is a beauty,"" said Mr. Danvers, looking admiringly at his wife's rosy face and wide-apart, laughing eyes, adding with a smile: ""Even though she has a big patch of flour under one eye.""""Oh!"" cried Connie's mother, and wiped her face vigorously with a pink and white checked apron. ""Now just for that,"" she said, turning to her husband, who was still lounging in the doorway, ""I'm going to put you out. And Bruce, too. I have enough to do without having a husband who makes fun of me and a dog who sticks his tail into everything under my feet all the time. Hurry on,"" and she pushed her protesting, laughing husband and the reluctant dog out through the open door and into the brilliant sunshine beyond."
"""She put us out, Bruce,"" said Mr. Danvers laying a caressing hand on the dog's beautiful head as he walked gravely along beside him. ""But we love her just the same, don't we?"" And Bruce's answer was to press close to Mr. Danvers and wave his tail enthusiastically.Hardly had Mrs. Danvers had time to put the bacon in the oven to keep warm and break the eggs into the pan when there was a sound of skirmishing on the stairs, and a moment later a whirlwind broke in upon her.""Mother, Mother, Mother, everything smells good!"" cried Connie, dancing over to her mother and hugging her so energetically that she almost sent the eggs, pan and all, on the floor. ""Is there anything we can do to help?""""Yes--go away,"" cried Connie's mother, seeing with dismay that one of the eggs in the pan was broken--and Connie's mother prided herself upon serving perfect eggs. Then, as she saw the surprise in the girls' faces, she relented, left the eggs to their fate, and hugged them all.But Billie had jumped to the rescue, and when the eggs were turned out on the platter with the bacon surrounding them on four sides, they did not look ""awful"" at all, but just about the most appetizing things the girls had ever laid hungry eyes on.""They were just coming back,"" she told her mother, as she sank into her seat and reached for a biscuit. ""Daddy said he smelled the biscuits and they drew him with----What was it you said they drew you with, Daddy?""""Irresistible force?"" asked Mr. Danvers, as he greeted the girls and took his seat at the head of the table. ""Now, if they only taste as they smell----"" He smiled at his wife across the table and she handed him a plate full of the golden brown biscuits.""Oh, please, excuse me; I forgot to introduce him,"" cried Mrs. Danvers, dimpling and laying her hand lightly on the dog's head. ""This is Robert Bruce, and he's a thoroughbred and belongs to Uncle Tom, and lives over at the lighthouse.""""Any time you like,"" answered Mrs. Danvers, her heart warming to their girlish enthusiasm. She was falling in love with Connie's friends more and more every minute. ""Uncle Tom receives visitors at all hours of the day.""Good as the breakfast was, the girls found themselves hurrying through it, so eager were they to see the lighthouse and Uncle Tom. They took Bruce with them at Mrs. Danvers' request, for she was going to be very busy and the big dog did have a habit of getting in the way.As the girls swung along the boardwalk they had a wild desire to shout with the sheer joy of living. Everything looked so different by daylight. It was not half so thrilling and mysterious, but it was much more beautiful. Uncle Tom was undeniably glad to see them. He was sitting in the little room at the base of the tower which was his living room, smoking a great corn-cob pipe and idly turning over the pages of a book.""Well, well!"" he cried, his great voice filling the room like thunder, ""here's my little girl come back to me again. I was beginning to think you'd deserted your uncle in his old age, Connie, lass. When did you get back? And who are these other very pretty young ladies you have with you?"""
"""Yes, yes, so she did,"" said Uncle Tom in the same hearty tones that seemed to fill the little room and--the girls could almost have sworn to it--make it tremble. ""But my memory is getting worse and worse, Connie, lass,"" he added, with a doleful shake of the head that was belied by the merry twinkle in his eyes. ""Let me see now, what was it their names were?""Then laughingly Connie introduced the girls and Uncle Tom had some funny personal little thing to say to each one of them so that by the time the introductions were over they were all laughing merrily and feeling very well acquainted.""I suppose you will be wanting to see the tower,"" said Uncle Tom, after he had shown them all around the quaint little room and introduced them to some of his treasures--queer racks and shells and pebbles that he had picked up in his wanderings. ""Everybody always wants to climb the tower, and it's mighty hard on a poor old fellow with a weak back, let me tell you."" And again the doleful shake of the head was belied by the twinkle in his eyes.""Oh, we're in no hurry, please,"" put in Billie, turning from one of the small-paned, outward-opening windows that looked straight out upon the ocean. ""I think this is the darlingest room I ever saw. I could spend days and days just looking around here.""Connie's Uncle Tom stood six feet two in his stocking feet and was broad in proportion. He had a shock of reddish brown hair that was becoming slightly streaked with gray, but his face was clean shaven. His features were rugged, rather than handsome, but his eyes were large and red-brown to match his hair and with an everlasting humor in them that made everybody love him who knew him.""No, you wouldn't,"" Uncle Tom interrupted, taking up his pipe and puffing at it thoughtfully. ""It's mighty nice in the day time, I'll admit. Then it's a mighty pretty, homey place. But at night, especially on a stormy night, it's different. The wind wails round here like a tortured ghost, the waves beat upon the rock foundation of the tower like savage beasts trying to tear it apart, and the tower itself seems to quiver and tremble. And you start to wonder--"" the girls had gathered closer to him, for his voice was grave and his eyes had stopped laughing--""about the ships away out there in the fury of the storm, some of them crippled, distressed, sinking perhaps. And you get to thinking about the men and women, and little children maybe, on board and wondering how many will be alive when the storm dies down. I tell you it grips you by the throat, it makes your eyes ache with pity, and you curse the storm that's bringing disaster along with it.""His hands were clenched, his face was hard and stern, and the girls felt thrilled, stirred, as they had never been before. But suddenly he jumped to his feet, went over to the window and stood there looking out for a moment. And when he came back he was smiling so naturally that the girls caught themselves wondering if they had not dreamed what had gone before.""I didn't mean to give you a lecture,"" he told them gayly. And with strange reluctance they shook off the spell and smiled with him. ""Come on, let's take a look at the tower, and then I'll give you some clam chowder. Would you like some clam chowder?""They were too fresh from breakfast to be wildly enthusiastic even over clam chowder just then, but they knew the time would come soon when they would be hungry again, so they assented happily and followed the broad back of Uncle Tom up the winding tower steps.They went downstairs with Uncle Tom and listened to his yarns, with Bruce curled happily up at his master's feet, until the thought of the clam chowder he had promised them became insistent and Connie asked him pointblank whether he had forgotten all about it."
"Uncle Tom indignantly denied the latter imputation, and set about preparing the chowder immediately, the girls offering eager but inexperienced help. Bruce tried to help, too, but only succeeded, as usual, in getting himself in the way.And after that came bliss! The girls succeeded in devouring a huge pot of delicious chowder--it was better than that they had had the night before, because it was freshly made--and it was after three o'clock before they finally tore themselves from the lighthouse and Uncle Tom and started for the Danvers' bungalow.""Especially if you give us clam chowder every time,"" Billie laughed back at him over her shoulder. ""Good-bye, Bruce."" She turned once more before they lost sight of the lighthouse keeper, and there he was, towering in the doorway, his dog at his side, smoking his corn cob pipe and gazing thoughtfully out to sea.Billie tried hard to think of something crushing to say in reply, but before she could speak Connie gave an excited little skip that very nearly landed her in the sand a couple of feet below the boardwalk.""No,"" said Connie gravely. ""No, that isn't it. You see,"" she lowered her voice a little and spoke slowly, ""Uncle Tom lost somebody in a wreck once. She was a very lovely girl, it is said, and Uncle Tom was engaged to marry her.""""Why, it's positively dreadful!"" Laura declared one morning, feeling ruefully of her waistline which she was quite certain had expanded at least two inches. ""I've simply got to stop eating, or something.""""Stop eating!"" echoed Billie, taking up a handful of sand and letting it sift slowly through her fingers. ""Well, maybe you can do it, Laura dear, but I certainly can't--not with Connie's mother doing the cooking.""It was right after breakfast, and the girls had jumped into their bathing suits, as they did at almost the same time every morning, and were waiting impatiently for the hour to pass that Mrs. Danvers had insisted must pass before they went in swimming after breakfast.""Well, but I'm sure it is the boys. You said so yourself,"" retorted Billie impatiently, her eyes fixed on the mysterious spot dancing and bobbing on the glistening water. ""And they certainly won't know what to do if there isn't a soul here to meet them.""""Well, we can be, if we rush,"" broke in Connie. ""The boat won't reach the dock for fifteen or twenty minutes anyway, because it's still a long way off. We may be able to throw some clothes on and be back by that time.""The boys would have declared it could not be done. But the girls proved that it could. They were panting when they reached the house, stopped just long enough to explain to the surprised Mrs. Danvers and then scurried upstairs, and with eager fingers tore off their bathing suits and substituted their ordinary clothes.As a matter of fact, they were pretty much out of the last-named article when they reached the dock again. But the great thing was that they had succeeded in getting there before whoever was in that motor boat made a landing."
"It was, but the girls were just then too much interested in finding out who was in the boat to pay very much attention to its beauty. The graceful craft swung around toward them, the motor was shut off, and the boat glided easily in to the dock.There was a whoop from the deck of the motor boat, a shout of, ""Say, fellows, look who's here!"" and the next moment three sportily clad young figures leaped out on the dock and made a dash for the girls, leaving the fourth member of their party protesting vigorously.The fourth member was none other than Paul Martinson, and, being the owner and captain of the handsome motor boat, he had no intention of following the other boys and leaving his craft to wander out to sea.Meanwhile Chet had hugged his sister and Teddy had hugged his sister and Ferd had declared longingly that he wished he had a sister to hug, it made him feel lonesome, and there was laughter and noise and confusion generally.It was a good fifty feet in length and had a cabin in which one could stand up if one were not very tall. There were bunks running along both sides of the cabin that looked like leather-cushioned divans in the daytime and could be turned into the most comfortable of beds at night.""But isn't this some deck! Did your mother do this too, Paul?"" asked Laura, her eyes traveling admiringly from the pretty wicker lounging chairs to the gayly striped awning and brilliant deck rail that shown like gold in the dazzling sun. ""Why, Paul, I never knew a motor boat could be so pretty and comfy.""""That's just what we were going to do when we saw you coming,"" Billie confided, thinking how exceedingly handsome he looked in his white trousers and dark coat. Then she told him of the wild scramble they had had to get dressed, and she looked so pretty in the telling of it that he did not hear much of what she was saying to him for looking at her.And the way it disappeared before those ravenous girls and boys made even Mr. Danvers hold up his hands in consternation. But Connie's mother laughed happily, pressed them to eat everything up, ""for it would only spoil,"" and looked more than ever like Connie's older sister.That night the boys were put up in a spare room which contained one bed and two cots which Connie's mother always kept stowed away for emergencies. For the cottage on Lighthouse Island was a popular place with Mrs. Danvers' relatives and friends, and she often had unexpected company.Was that Billie, she wondered, who gazed back at her from the mirror? For this girl was surely prettier than Billie ever had been. Her eyes were shining, her cheeks were flushed under their tan, and her hair, a little tumbled by the breeze from the sea, made an unexpectedly pretty frame for a very lovely face.The next day the girls insisted that the boys take them out in their motor boat. The boys protested a little, for the sun was acting rather queerly--going under a cloud and staying there sometimes for half an hour on a stretch.As they clambered aboard _The Shelling_--Paul had named his craft after Captain Shelling, the master of Boxton Military Academy,--the sun went under a cloud again, and this cloud was bigger and blacker than any that had swallowed it before. But Laura's taunt still rang in Paul's ears, and he said nothing.""No, I don't think it's going to rain,"" Paul answered, his hands on the wheel, his eyes rather anxiously fixed on the water ahead. ""But I do think we're going to have one of those sudden heavy mists that come off the coast here. Dad said to look out for them, because they're thick enough to cut, and if you get caught in one you can't see your hand before your face.""""Of course,"" said Paul impatiently, noticing that the fog was growing thicker and blacker every moment. ""There's always danger of running into something when you get yourself lost in a fog. And it's the little boat that gets the worst of it,"" he added gloomily."
"""Say, can't you try being cheerful for a change?"" cried Teddy indignantly, for he had noticed how white Billie was getting and was trying his best to think of something to say that would make her laugh. ""There's no use of singing a funeral song yet, you know.""""No, and there's no use in starting a dance, either,"" retorted Paul, wondering how much longer he would be able to keep his course. ""We're in a mighty bad fix, and no harm can be done by everybody knowing it. I can't possibly get back to the island--or the mainland either--before this fog settles down upon us.""It took a minute or two for this to sink in. There was no doubt about it. He was telling them that in a few minutes they would be lost in this horrible fog. And that might mean--they shivered and turned dismayed faces to each other.It became impossible for Paul to steer, and all there was to do was to sit still and wait and hope for the best. Fog horns were sounding all about, some seeming so close that the girls fully expected to see some great shape loom up through the mist, bearing down upon them.For a long time nobody spoke--they were too busy listening to the weird meanings of the fog horns and wondering how they could have escaped a collision so long. For a while Paul had kept the engine running in the hope that he might be able to keep to his course and eventually get to Lighthouse Island. But he had decided that this only made a collision more likely, and so had shut it off. And now they had been floating for what seemed hours to the miserable boys and girls.""Oh, dear,"" she said, apropos of nothing at all, ""now I suppose we'll have to die and never solve our mystery after all."" She sighed plaintively, and the girls had a wild desire to shout with laughter and cry at the same time. For a moment the girls were too terrified to speak. And the next moment they could not have spoken if they had wanted to, for _The Shelling_ collided so suddenly with whatever it was that had risen out of the mist that they had all they could do to keep from being thrown to the deck.""Say, how's this for luck, fellows?"" he cried. ""I thought it was another boat and that we were bound for Davy Jones' locker sure, and here it's the dock instead. Say, talk about luck! I'll say it's grand!""""I guess we did come pretty close to it,"" said Teddy soberly, staring out into the heavy mist that still showed no sign of lifting. ""I don't know about the rest of you, but I do know that I'm mighty glad to be on the good old ground again. It beats the water, just now.""""Never mind us as long as you saved your boat,"" said Ferd with a chuckle. ""Come on, folks. It's mighty damp out here. I'll be glad when we can get under cover and dry out a bit. Gee, but I'll say I'm some wet."""
"""Do you know we forgot something?"" she asked. Then she pointed to the untouched lunch hamper which Mrs. Danvers had heaped high with good things. This was still standing close to the railing on the deck of _The Shelling_ where the boys had put it when they climbed aboard.When they reached the cottage they found Connie's mother almost beside herself with anxiety and Connie's father doing his best to soothe her. So that when the young folks came in the door looking rather damp and bedraggled but safe, Mrs. Danvers cried out joyfully, ran to them, and hugged them one after another till she was completely and rapturously out of breath.""You precious kiddies!"" she cried, standing back and regarding them with shining eyes. ""You will never know how horribly worried Dad and I have been. You poor children, why, you are soaked through! And,"" as her eyes fell on the basket, ""you don't mean to tell me you haven't had any lunch. Oh dear, oh dear! Run into the library, the lot of you. Daddy made a fire thinking if we ever did get you back you'd need some drying out--and you can be starting in on sandwiches while I make you some hot chocolate. Now run along--quick."" And she disappeared into the kitchen while the young folks went on into the library.Mrs. Danvers came in a few minutes later with the chocolate, and, oh, how that hot drink did taste! She demanded to know all about everything. They told her, speaking one at a time, two at a time, and all at once, till it was a wonder she could make any sense out of it at all. But when she and her husband did realize how terribly close the young folks had been to disaster they looked very sober and in their hearts thanked Providence for guiding them back to safety.""I'm afraid so,"" said Paul, also turning to look at her. ""We've had a bully good time and we'd like to stay longer, but you see I promised Dad I'd pick him up a little farther along the coast and I can't do it unless we start to-morrow.""""Well, we don't have to worry about that now, anyway,"" said Teddy, stretching his long legs out contentedly toward the fire. ""Let's enjoy ourselves while we can. By the way,"" he added, turning to Billie, and Billie thought that Teddy was getting better looking every minute--or was it the firelight? ""What did you girls mean by speaking of a mystery? We haven't heard a word about any mystery.""Then with the help of the girls she told the boys all about the man who lived in a hut in the woods and called himself Hugo Billings, and also about Miss Arbuckle and the album she had been so overjoyed to recover. The boys listened with an interest that fast changed to excitement.""Well, I should say there was something queer about it!"" Ferd Stowing broke out at last. ""Especially about the man who lives in the woods and makes fern baskets. He's either crazy or he's a thief or something."""
"But the boys were decided--saying that since the mist had lifted they had really no excuse for staying longer, and as Paul was evidently very anxious to get to his father, Mrs. Danvers had nothing else to do but to give in.""It's true, the fog has lifted,"" she admitted, gazing up anxiously at an overcast sky, ""but after a calm like this we are sure to have a storm--how much of one it's hard to tell. Well, go on. But promise me to stay close to the mainland and to put in to shore if the weather man looks too threatening.""""Matter enough,"" said Uncle Tom, turning to scowl up at the overcast sky. ""It's as much as those youngsters' lives are worth for them to set out to-day. Why, there's a storm on the way,"" and he fixed his eyes gravely on the girls, ""such as this old Maine coast hasn't seen for years. Why, every captain who can read the signs is going to make straight for the nearest port, or if he is too far away to make port before the storm breaks, he's going to get down on his knees and pray the good Lord to make his old ship staunch enough to stand the test. It will be upon us by night."" His eyes sought the wild dreary waste of water and he spoke as though to himself. ""Lord, how I dread to-night!""""I don't see how we can very well help it,"" said Vi, with a little shiver and cuddling up close to Billie on the window seat and slipping a hand into hers. ""Oh--h!"" and she clapped her hand to her ears as the wind rose to a wailing scream and the windows all over the house shook and rattled with the impact.""I guess Uncle Tom was right,"" said Connie, from somewhere out of the darkness. ""Dad says, too, that this is the worst summer storm we have had around these parts for years. Oh, I do hope the boys are safe somewhere on shore.""""I don't think we need worry about them,"" said Mr. Danvers. Or rather he started to say it, but at that moment the wind rose with insane fury, bringing the rain with it in driving torrents that beat swishingly upon the sand and drove viciously against the windows.""The storm was a long time in coming,"" he said. ""The boys had plenty of warning. Paul is very cautious, and I know he wouldn't go on in the face of such danger. But,"" and he turned toward the window again, ""heaven help the ship that can't make port to-night.""""That's almost exactly what Uncle Tom said,"" remarked Connie, and then there was silence in the little room again while outside the storm raged and the light from the lighthouse tower sent its warning far out over the foam-crested waves.""Poor Uncle Tom!"" murmured Billie to herself as, in her little white nightie, she stood at the window looking out toward the lighthouse tower. ""All alone out there. What was it he said? 'You think of the men and the women and the little children out there on the sinking ships, and you curse the storm that's bringing disaster along with it.' Poor, poor Uncle Tom! I wonder if he _is_ thinking of--her."""
"Toward morning the girls were awakened from an uneasy sleep by a strange white light flashed suddenly in their eyes. They stumbled out of bed, dazed by the suddenness with which they had been awakened and stared out into the black night.""The searchlight,"" cried Connie, running over to the window, her eyes wide with horror. ""Billie, that's the signal to the life-savers. And there goes the siren,"" she groaned, clapping her hands over her ears as the moan of the siren rose wailingly into the night. ""It's a wreck! Billie--oh--oh!""""Never mind what you were dreaming,"" cried Billie, beginning to pull on her clothes with trembling hands. ""If it is a wreck, girls, we may be able to do something to help. Oh, where is my other stocking? Did any one see it? Never mind, here it is. Oh, hurry, girls; please, hurry.""""But what are you going to do, kiddies?"" asked Mrs. Danvers, taking a step toward them. ""The life-savers will be coming soon--perhaps they are at work now--and they will do all that can be done. Why are you putting on your coats?""""Oh, please, please don't make us stay at home,"" begged Billie, turning an earnest, troubled face to Connie's mother. ""We may not be able to do anything to help, but we shall at least be there if we should be needed.""""You darling, darling kiddies,"" she cried. ""Run along then if you must. Only,"" she stopped at the doorway to look earnestly back at them, ""don't go any farther than the lighthouse until Dad and I come. We'll be along right away.""The girls ran down the stairs, and Connie opened the front door with hands that fumbled nervously at the lock. As the door swung open the wind sprang at them like a living thing, taking their breath, making them stagger back into the hall. Foot by foot they fought their way through the storm, conscious that other hurrying forms passed them from time to time. Their minds were fixed upon one thing. They must get to Uncle Tom. He would be able to tell them everything and perhaps let them know how they could help.The Point was black with people all gesticulating and pointing excitedly out toward a great shape which, looming grayly against the lifting blackness of the sky, staggered and swayed like a drunken thing in the grip of the gigantic foam-tipped waves."
"""Oh,"" moaned Connie, ""it's just as I thought! There's Uncle Tom. Come on, Billie."" And she elbowed her way through the crowd to where Uncle Tom stood, his great height making him conspicuous among the other men, bawling out directions to the life-savers who were just making ready to launch their staunch little boats.""Say, do you call this hurrying?"" Uncle Tom was crying, his eyes traveling from the life-savers to the wreck and back again. ""Don't you see she's just hanging on by her eyelashes? Another sea like that and you won't have a chance to save anybody. Good boys--that's the idea. Bend your backs, my lads. God help you--and them!"" he added under his breath, his eyes on the laboring vessel.Then followed a struggle of human might against the will of the overpowering elements--a struggle that the girls never forgot. On, on, fought the gallant men in the staunch little boats. On, on toward the quivering giant that hung on the edge of destruction--her fate the fate of all the lives on board.The storm that had beaten her on to the treacherous shoal was now doing its best to loosen her hold upon it. And that hold was the one slender thread that kept alive the hope of the passengers on board.If the pounding waves once succeeded in pushing her back into the deeper water of the channel, nothing could save her. The great hole ripped in her side by the impact with the shoal would fill with water, and in five minutes there would be nothing left but the swirling water to mark the spot where she had been.""Oh, oh, it can't be, it can't be! Those boats will never reach her in time. Oh, isn't there something somebody can do?"" She turned pleadingly to Uncle Tom, but the look on his face startled her and she followed his set gaze out to sea.The great ship hesitated a moment, trembled convulsively through all her frame, then her stern reared heavenward as though protesting against her fate, and slowly, majestically, she sank from view beneath the swirling waters.""Yes; but Uncle Tom says that when a ship sinks like that it is hard to save anybody,"" said Connie, twisting her handkerchief into a damp little ball. ""Girls,"" she said, turning upon them eyes that were wide with horror, ""it makes me crazy to think of it. Out there, those people are drowning!""And as she reached it she drew in her breath sharply and brushed a hand across her eyes to make sure she was not dreaming. On the thing that was not a piece of driftwood at all, but looked like a sort of crudely and hastily constructed raft, were lashed three small, unconscious little forms.""I don't know,"" said Billie, dropping to her knees beside the three pitiful little figures. Two of them were girls, twins evidently, and the third was a smaller child, a boy. Something in their baby attitudes, perhaps their very helplessness, stung Billie to sudden action."
"""Help me get them loose!"" she cried to the other girls, who were still staring stupidly. ""I don't know whether they're dead or not yet. But they will be if we don't hurry. Oh, girls, stop staring and help me!""""There! At last!"" cried Billie, flinging the rope aside and trying to lift one of the little girls. She found it surprisingly easy, for the child was pitifully thin. She staggered to her feet, holding the little form tight to her.Laura and Vi each took one of the children and Connie offered to help whoever gave out first. Then they started back to the lighthouse. Luckily for them, the wind was at their backs, or they never could have made the trip back. It did not take Uncle Tom very long, experienced as he was, to bring the three children back to consciousness. As it was, they had been more affected by the cold and the fright than anything else, for the raft, crude as it was, had kept them above the surface of the waves and saved their lives.""Oh, they are alive, bless 'em,"" cried Billie, jumping to her feet. But the quick action seemed to terrify the children, and they cried out in alarm. In a minute Billie was back on her knees beside them, looking at them wonderingly.""Why, what's the matter?"" she asked, putting out her hand to the little boy, who shrank away from her and raised an arm before his eyes. ""Why, honey, did you really think Billie would hurt a nice little boy like you?""Uncle Tom had spread a large rug on the floor and had laid the children on it while he worked over them. Up to this time he had been on his knees beside the girls, but now he got to his feet and looked down at them soberly.""Somebody's been mistreating 'em,"" he said, his eyes on the three cowering, pathetic little figures. ""Poor little mites--poor little mites! Found 'em on a sort of raft, you say? Washed up by the waves?""The girls nodded, and Billie, putting a tender arm around the little fellow, succeeded in drawing him up close to her while Laura and Vi tried to do the same with the little girls. Connie was watching her Uncle Tom.""Oh, I'm glad,"" said Billie, hugging the little boy to her and smoothing his damp hair back from his forehead. The child had stopped crying and had snuggled close to Billie, lying very still like a little kitten who has found shelter and comfort in the midst of a wilderness. The soft little confiding warmth of him very suddenly made Billie want to cry. ""Your mother will know what to do,"" she said to Connie."
"""Oh, kiddies, what a fright you gave us!"" cried Connie's mother, looking very pale and tired as she leaned against the door post while Mr. Danvers patted her hand gently and tried not to look too much relieved. ""Where did you go? Why, girls----"" She stopped short in absolute amazement and bewilderment as she caught sight of Laura and Vi and Billie on the floor, each with a child clasped in her arms. ""Where did you get them?""She did not wait for an answer. She flew across the room and, dropping to her knees, gazed at the children who at this new intrusion had started away from the girls and regarded her with wide, doubtful eyes.""Why, you precious little scared babies, you!"" she cried, pushing the girls away and gathering the children to her. ""I don't know where you came from, but what you need is mothering. Where did they come from?"" she asked, looking up at Uncle Tom.""From out there,"" said Uncle Tom gravely, waving his hand toward the spot where the ship had gone down. Then he quickly told her and Mr. Danvers what the girls had told him. They did not interrupt. Only, when he had finished, Mrs. Danvers was crying and not trying to hide it.""Oh, those poor, poor people!"" she sobbed. ""And these poor little frightened, miserable children all, all there is left. Oh, I'll never get over the horror of it. Never, never! John,"" she added, looking up at her husband with one of those quick changes of mood that the girls had learned to expect in her, ""will you and Tom help me get the children home? They mustn't be left like this in dripping clothes. They'll catch their death of cold. What they need is a hot bath and something to eat, and then bed. Poor little sweethearts, they are just dropping for sleep.""So the strange procession started for the bungalow, the girls, tired out with nerve strain and excitement, bringing up the rear. But they did not know they were tired. The mystery of the three strange little waifs washed up to them by the sea had done a good deal to erase even the horror of the wreck.""And we haven't the slightest idea in the world who they really are or whom they belong to,"" Connie was saying as they turned in at the walk. ""It is a mystery, girls, a _real_ mystery this time. And I don't know how we'll solve it."""
"And then eyes grew drowsy, tired little heads nodded, and Connie's mother, with a look at Mr. Danvers, who had been hovering in the background all the time, picked up one of the little girls and started for the stairs.But Billie did not find the answer for several days. Meanwhile they had received word from the boys that they had put into port the afternoon of the great storm and had not been able to go out again until a couple of days later. No news concerning the three waifs had come in.The boys had promised to return in a couple of weeks and give the girls a regular ""ride in the motor boat."" If it had not been for the waifs who had so strangely been entrusted to them, the girls would have looked forward more eagerly to the return of the boys.As it was, they were too busy taking care of the sweet little girls and beautiful little boy and falling in love with them to think much of the boys one way or another except to be deeply thankful that they had escaped disaster in the storm.It was one night after the girls had gone to bed. They had been laughing over some of the cunning things the children had been doing, and Laura had been wondering how they would go about finding the relatives of the children--if they had any--when suddenly Billie sat up in bed with a look of astonishment on her face.As soon as she could get away Billie flew upstairs to write her letter, leaving the others still at the table. The children had already had their breakfast--for like all children they woke up with the birds--and were out playing on the front porch.""Why, I never heard anything like it!"" said Connie's mother to her equally astonished husband. ""It seems like a fairy tale. But, oh, I do hope it is true--for the kiddies' sake and for that of that poor Miss Arbuckle.""Again and again Mrs. Danvers had tried to question the children about their parents and where they lived, but the little things had seemed to be thrown into such terror at the very first questions and had refused so absolutely to say a word that might lead to the discovery of their relatives that she had been forced to give up in despair. Just the very night before Mr. Danvers had decided to go over to the mainland and put an advertisement in all the leading papers.""Although I rather dread to find their guardians,"" he had confided to his wife that night, as they had stood looking down at the sweet little sleeping faces. ""I'm falling in love with them. It's like having Connie a baby all over again.""""No,"" he said, stooping down to pat the little boy's dark head. ""I'll give Billie a chance to clear up her mystery first."" And with a smile at Billie he swung off down the walk while with quickened hearts the girls and Mrs. Danvers watched him go.""Yes. But he's coming back,"" said Billie, catching the little fellow up and kissing his soft rosy cheek. Then she looked at the girls and her eyes filled with tears. ""Oh, girls,"" she cried, ""I don't see how I'm going to give him up!""Then followed days of anxious waiting for the girls. Every night when the mail came in on the _Mary Ann_ they were at the dock to meet it. But though they searched for a letter postmarked Molata with eager eyes, day after day went by and still there was no word from Miss Arbuckle."
"The letter was such a mixture of joy and hope and fear that sometimes the girls had hard work making anything out of it. However, this much was clear: Miss Arbuckle intended to leave Molata Friday night--and this was Friday night--and would probably be at Lighthouse Island Saturday morning. And to-morrow was Saturday!""She says,"" Billie finished, her voice trembling with excitement, ""that the reason she didn't write to us before was because she was out of town and didn't receive my letter for almost a week after it reached Three Towers Hall. She says----""""But who is the man with her?"" cried Laura suddenly, as Miss Arbuckle waved to them from the upper deck and then started down the narrow winding stairway, followed by a tall, rather stoop-shouldered man who seemed to the girls to have something vaguely familiar about him.""He may not be with her,"" Billie answered. But suddenly she gasped. Miss Arbuckle had stepped upon the dock with hands outstretched to the girls, and as the tall man followed her Billie got her first full look at his face.Then she introduced her companion to the girls as ""my brother"" and once more the girls thought they must be losing their minds. But this time Miss Arbuckle did not seem to notice their bewilderment, for her whole mind was on the object that had brought her here.""Mary! My Mary!"" he cried in his baby voice, and ran as fast as his little legs could carry him straight into Miss Arbuckle's arms. Then the little girls ran to her, and Miss Arbuckle dropped down in the sand and hugged them and kissed them and cried over them.""Talk about mysteries----"" Connie was beginning when Connie's mother and Miss Arbuckle came in with the clamoring, excited children. And to say that Miss Arbuckle's face was radiant would not have been describing it at all.""Oh girls, girls!"" she cried, looking around at them, while her eyes filled with tears, ""do you know what you've done for me--do you? But of course you don't,"" she answered herself, sitting down on the couch while the children climbed up and snuggled against her. ""And that's what I want to tell you.""""You see,"" the teacher began while the girls gathered around eagerly, ""only a few months ago Hugo--my brother--and I were very happy. That was before the dreadful thing happened that changed everything for us. I was nurse and governess,"" she hugged the children to her and they gazed up at her fondly, ""to these children at the same house where Hugo was head gardener. Our employers were very wealthy people, and, having too many social duties to care for their children, Hugo and I sort of took the place of their father and mother. Indeed we loved them as if they belonged to us.""""But that wasn't enough--Hugo and I weren't sorrow-stricken enough,"" she went on, a trace of bitterness creeping into her voice. ""But they--Mr. and Mrs. Beltz--must accuse us--us--of a plot to kidnap the children. They accused us openly, and Hugo and I, being afraid they had enough circumstantial evidence to convict us, innocent though we were, fled from the house."
"""That's about all,"" she said, with a sigh. ""Hugo built himself a little refuge in the woods and made fern baskets, selling enough to make him a scanty living, and I went as a teacher and house matron to Three Towers Hall. That is why,"" she turned to Billie, who was staring at her fascinated, ""I was so desperate when I lost the album, and why,"" she added, with a smile, ""I acted so foolishly when you returned it.""""But I don't--not quite,"" put in Connie's mother, her pretty forehead puckered thoughtfully. ""Of course you didn't kidnap the children,"" turning to Miss Arbuckle, ""but it is equally certain that somebody must have done it.""""And then the ship went down before they could follow,"" said Billie, adding, as she turned earnestly to the teacher: ""Oh, Miss Arbuckle, it was awful--that poor ship out there going down with all the people on board!""""Yes, it must have been horrible. I read about it in the papers,"" nodded Miss Arbuckle soberly. Then a great light broke over her face as she looked down at the three children who were still not much more than babies. ""But some good comes of almost everything. I have my precious children now, and I can take them back to their family and prove my innocence--and Hugo's. Oh I'm so happy--I'm so happy!""""Yes, my dear,"" she said, a joyful light in her eyes that made her quite a different person. ""Hugo will probably go back to his old position, but I--oh, I could not desert Three Towers now after all you girls have done for me.""She did not notice that the little boy whom Miss Arbuckle had called Davy stopped at the foot of the stairs and crept softly back to her, she did not know he was anywhere around, till a soft little hand was slipped into hers and a baby voice said plaintively:""Yes, I'm glad he--_they_ are coming,"" stammered Billie, and the others laughed at her confusion. Then suddenly she wiped away the last trace of her tears and her eyes began to shine, making her look like the Billie the girls knew and loved best. ""We _will_ have some good times when the boys come, girls. Why,"" as if making a surprising discovery, ""our fun has just begun!""And that Billie was speaking the truth and that there were more adventures in store for the boys and girls than even the girls dreamed of on that beautiful summer day, will be shown in the next volume of the series.In the due course of time the three Beltz children were restored to their parents. It was learned that they had been kidnapped by three men who had thought to make a large sum of money out of their scoundrelly game. But all three kidnappers had lost their lives in the wreck.At first it was supposed that many had gone down in the foundering of the _Daniel Boley_, as the ship was named. But later on it was learned that three small boats had got away in safety and the survivors had been picked up by a vessel bound for Halifax. So the loss of life was, after all, small.Mr. and Mrs. Beltz were heartily ashamed of having suspected Miss Arbuckle and her brother of wrong doing, and they offered both their positions back at increased salaries. Hugo returned to the Beltz estate, but not so his sister.""I love the children very, very much,"" said Miss Arbuckle. ""But I also love Three Towers Hall and the girls there. I shall remain at the school."" And she did, much to the delight of Billie and her chums."

How Billie went there, accompanied by some of her chums, and what queer things happened, go to make up a story no girl will want to miss.Three-Towers Hall was a boarding school for girls. For a short time after Billie arrived there all went well. But then the head of the school had to go on a long journey and she left the girls in charge of two teachers, sisters, who believed in severe discipline and in very, very plain food and little of it--and then there was a row! The girls wired for the head to come back--and all ended happily.One of Billie's friends owned a summer bungalow on Lighthouse Island, near the coast.
