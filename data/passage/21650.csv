When you're tired of walking, call ""Hi! Conductor, stop!"" And he'll give you such a jolly ride, for twopence, on the top. Sometimes by the 'bus's side small boys will run a mile, Turning round just like the wheels, and hungry all the while:-- ""We've not had any breakfast,--won't you toss us down a brown?""-- That's what they call a penny in the streets of London Town. In summer when the sun is high, And children's lips are parched and dry, An ice is just the thing to try. So this young man who comes, 'tis plain, From Saffron Hill or Leather Lane, A store of pence will quickly gain. ""A lemon ice for me,"" says Fred; Cries Sue, ""No, have a cream instead."" ""A raspberry!"" shouts Newsboy Ned. ""What fun! Although we're now in June, It feels""--says Ned--""this afternoon, Like eating winter with a spoon!"" This is Covent Garden, What a lively scene! Here are flowers so pretty, There are leaves so green. These are busy buyers, Busy sellers those, Selling, buying, selling, Everything that grows. Fruits and lovely blossoms Hither come each day, Fresh from _other_ gardens Many miles away. Cabbages potatoes, Pears and apples too, Grapes, and pines, and peaches, All are here on view. So the air is scented With the pleasant fruits, With the bright-hued nosegays, And the springing roots. For the little street-boys, Walking up and down, It's almost like the country Brought to London Town. ""Toys! toys! Penny Toys! Toys for girls, and toys for boys! Toys for dots who scarce can crawl, Toys for youngsters stout and tall, Toys for prince and peasant too, Toys, my dears, for all of you! Toys for girls and toys for boys! Toys! toys! Penny Toys!"""
"That is how the toyman talks, As through London Town he walks; Bawling out his toyman's song, While he slowly moves along, On the pavement with a tray Which is filled, from day to day, With new toys to catch the eye Of the youthful passer-by. Sometimes it's a great big spider, Like that Miss Muffet had beside her; Sometimes it's a bat that flies, Or a baby doll that cries; Sometimes it's a frog that leaps, Or a crocodile that creeps: But whatever toy is shown, For a penny it's your own. Orange-girl Kitty Roams to and fro; All through the city She's known high and low. When the sun's shining, When the rain falls, Never repining,-- ""Fine fruit!"" Kitty calls. Chimney Sweeps' Day, Blackbird is gay, Here he is singing, you see, in the ""May."" He has feathers as black as a chimney sweep's coat, So on Chimney Sweeps' Day he must pipe a glad note. Cried the drake to the ducks, ""Here's a boy with a bun, Come, make haste! we shall have quite a feast!"" ""Would you mind,"" said a swan, ""if we shared in the fun?"" ""O dear no!"" said he; ""not in the least!"" It was surely through fear, not politeness at all, That the drake made so civil a speech, For that one penny bun, after all, was so small, There was hardly a mouthful for each! From the ducks and the swans on the lake, to next page-- A much quieter scene--you may pass: Though Westminster Cloisters are hoary with age, Yet green is their velvety grass, And cheerily bright are their gables and peaks, As they glow in the westering sun: 'Tis some house in the Cloisters yon schoolboy seeks-- Don't you wonder, now, which is the one? In all the land A pile so grand Is scarcely found As this. Around Its old grey walls The shadow falls Of bygone years, And so one fears To raise one's tone, When one is shown Some ancient tomb, Half hid in gloom. Beneath such stones There rest the bones Of monarchs bold, Whose story's told For you and me In history. From kings of men We wander; then We're quickly brought To kings of thought, For poets lie Interred hard by. Here, too, repose The bones of those Who fought the foe Long, long ago. Brave knights were they; And in the fray They kept from shame The English name, And proved in fight Great Britain's might. Where they are laid Their rest is made As sweet as prayer By music rare: Over their head The sleeping dead Can daily hear The anthem clear Floating along Like angel's song, Until it dies Like angel's sighs. Goodness gracious! What a noise Baby Bunting's bent on making; It is quite enough to set All the heads around him aching. Still we're sure that Baby has Many griefs if we could see 'em, For with other babes he's come Miles and miles to the Museum. Baby Bunting thought, of course, When he said good bye to mother, That he'd pass in through the gates With big sister and big brother. But poor Baby finds, alas, That his little hopes have flitted, For the nasty notice says ""Babes in arms are not admitted."" If you want to see all sorts of wonderful things, Stuffed crocodiles, mammoths, and sloths, Hairy ducks with four feet, and fishes with wings, Fat beetles, and strange spotted moths; Away we go to the famous Zoo' With Bertie, and Nellie, and Dick, and Sue. And we feel quite ready to jump for glee When the wonderful birds and beasts we see. The pelican solemn with monster beak, And the plump little penguin round and sleek, Have set us laughing--Ha, ha! Ho! ho! And you'll laugh too, if you look below. To the monkey-house then we make our way, Where the monkeys chatter, and climb, and play; At the snakes we peep, then onward stroll, To talk to the parrots, and ""scratch a poll,"" And after all that, there will still be time On the patient elephant's back to climb."
"Don't forget at the Zoo' To take a good view Of the funny old bear, Who climbs out of his lair Up a pole--Look, he's here, With his figure so queer, And his thick clumsy paws, And his bun-seeking jaws. On the end of a stick Place a bun--""Now quick, Master Bertie""--and, snap!-- What an awful red trap!-- The bun's out of sight, But one more will delight Father Bruin up there, For his appetite's rare, And he never says ""No"" To a dozen or so. ""Milk o! Milk o!"" Each morn she cries, And little sleepers Ope their eyes, And wonder if pure milk is sold By Betty here, for they've been told That London milk (How people talk!) Is only water Mixed with chalk! You've heard about the muffin man, the muffin man, the muffin man, You've heard about the muffin man who lives in Drury Lane? Well, here you see that muffin man-- that celebrated muffin man, And if you try his muffins, you'll be sure to buy again. They were once ""Street Arabs,"" hungry, ill-clad, And in very sore danger of going to the bad; But now!--one might think that their fortunes were made, They're so proud to belong to the Shoeblack Brigade. In the famous Guildhall Mayor and Alderman all Meet to banquet and feast, And it's whispered that they Aren't inclined in the least From the table to stray: For they're fond of good cheer, And they meet with it here, Where the wine Is so fine, And still better than that, Where the turtle's rich fat Tempts the guests when they dine. Turtle soup's very good, And a favourite food, With the banqueters all Who frequent the Guildhall. Two giants so tall Guard the famous Guildhall. (Gog is one, and the other Is Magog his brother.) Well, these giants so tall Watch the feast, but can't call For a crumb, As they're dumb, And not living at all! Else 'twould seem scarcely fair, That when good things were by, Gog and Magog should stare From their pedestals high, For if placed at a table At least they'd look able, To dine there and then Like two live Aldermen! He calls ""Meat, meat!"" All down the street; And dogs ""bow-wow,"" And cats ""mi-ow,"" While kittens sly Come purring by, As if to say-- ""Do serve us, pray, The first of all, For we're so small."" The man throws bits Of meat to kits, And cats, and dogs; Then on he jogs, And down the street Still cries ""Meat, meat!"" In Guildford Street, great London Town, Is a Nursery, bigger than ever has been: When each child grows up and leaves its walls, Another new baby that day is seen In the Foundling cots. Each little babe Has no baby sister or baby brother, And never shall know the anxious care And tender touch of a loving mother. But ""Our Father,"" who gives their ""daily bread"" To all of His creatures, caused kindly men To build this home for famishing babes From many a poverty-stricken den: And here they are fed, and clothed, and taught, And lift their voices in prayer and praise; And here every Sunday the people flock To hear the Anthem the Foundlings raise. ""Flowers sweet and fair, Sir, Flowers that any Princess might wear, Sir-- A bunch for a penny!"" Many a bunch Must the flower-woman sell, To buy food for herself, And her children as well. Upon the broad Embankment You'll find a curious sight,-- The children play around it From morning until night; And crowds of grown-up people Come here to see it too, 'Tis Cleopatra's Needle Folks gather thus to view. In Mother's pretty work-box There's no such needle shown; This needle, brought from Egypt, Is nothing but a stone. How silently it watches Old Thames go gliding by! ""You're very old,"" the River says, ""But not so old as I."" Think you it longs for Egypt, This wondrous solemn stone, That stands and gazes at us Each day so sad and lone? Ah yes! when London's sleeping, If monuments can dream, It longs for Egypt's palm-trees, And Nile's slow murmuring stream."
