passage
"""There, there, little woman! light of my eyes, and core of my heart! if you don't stop this pretty soon, I very much fear I shall be compelled to join you,"" Edward Travilla said, between a laugh and a sigh, drawing Zoe closer to him, laying her head against his breast, and kissing her tenderly on lip and cheek and brow. ""I shall begin to think you already regret having staid behind with me.""""No, no, no!"" she cried, dashing away her tears, then putting her arms about his neck, and returning his caresses with ardor of affection. ""Dear Ned, you know you're more than all the rest of the world to your silly little wife. But it seems lonely just at first, to have them all gone at once, especially mamma; and to think we'll not see her again for months! I do believe you'd cry yourself, if you were a girl.""""Altogether likely,"" he said, laughing, and giving her another hug; ""but, being a man, it wouldn't do at all to allow my feelings to overcome me in that manner. Besides, with my darling little wife still left me, I'd be an ungrateful wretch to repine at the absence of other dear ones.""""What a neat little speech, Ned!"" she exclaimed, lifting her head to look up into his face, and laughing through her tears--for her eyes had filled again. ""Well, you know I can't help feeling a little lonely and sad just at first; but, for all that, I wouldn't for the world be anywhere else than here in your arms:"" and with a sigh of content and thankfulness, she let her pretty head drop upon his breast again.Then, wiping her eyes, ""I sha'n't cry any more; for, if I'm not the happiest woman in the world, I ought to be. And what a nice time we shall have together, dear Ned! each wholly devoted to the other all winter long. I have it all planned out: while you are out about the plantation in the mornings, I'll attend to my housekeeping and my studies; and in the afternoons and evenings,--after I've recited,--we can write our letters, or entertain ourselves and each other with music or books; you can read to me while I work, you know.""""True enough,"" he said, laughing. ""Well, then, we'll try to get a little first, and cultivate it carefully afterward. I must go now, love,"" he added, releasing her: ""the men need some directions from me, in regard to their work.""""And the women some from me,"" said Zoe. ""Oh! you needn't laugh, Ned,"" shaking her finger at him, as he turned in the doorway to give her an amused glance: ""perhaps some of these days you'll find out that I am really an accomplished housewife, capable of giving orders and directions too.""She lingered there for a little, trying on a morning-dress they were making for her, then repaired to her boudoir, intent upon beginning her studies, which had been rather neglected of late, in the excitement of the preparations for the departure of the greater part of the family for a winter at Viamede.But she had scarcely taken out her books, when the sound of wheels on the avenue attracted her attention; and glancing from the window, she saw the Roselands carriage draw up at the front entrance, and Ella Conly alight from it, and run up the veranda steps.She hastily replaced the books in the drawer from which she had taken them,--for she had a feeling, only half acknowledged even to herself, of repugnance to having Ella know of her studies,--Ella, who had graduated from boarding-school, and evidently felt herself thoroughly educated,--and hurried down to meet and welcome her guest.""I told Cal and Art, I thought you'd be sure to feel dreadfully lonely to-day, after seeing everybody but Ned start off on a long journey, and so I'd come and spend the day with you,"" said Ella, when the two had exchanged kisses, and inquiries after each other's health.""Take this easy-chair, won't you?"" she said, wheeling it a little nearer the grate; ""and Dinah shall carry away your wraps when it suits you to doff them. I wish cousins Cal and Art would invite themselves to dine with us too."""
"""Well, I don't know: there's something to be said on both sides of that question,"" laughed Ella. ""I can tell you, Art would make a mighty good husband; and it's very handy, in ease of sickness, to have the doctor in the house.""Ella laughed. ""Yes,"" she said, ""doctors do have a hard life; but, if you say so to Art, he always says he has never regretted having chosen the medical profession, because it affords so many opportunities for doing good. It's plain he makes that the business of his life. I'm proud of Art. I don't believe there's a better man anywhere. I was sick last summer, and you wouldn't believe how kindly he nursed me.""""You can't tell me any thing about him that I should think too good to believe,"" said Zoe. ""He's our family doctor, you remember; and, of course, we are all attached to him on that account, as well as because of the relationship.""""Yes, to be sure. There, Dinah, you may carry away my hat and cloak,"" Ella said, divesting herself of them as she spoke, ""but leave the satchel. I brought my fancy-work, Zoe: one has to be industrious now, as Christmas is coming. I decided to embroider a pair of slippers for each of my three brothers. Walter does not expect to get home; so I made his first, as they had to travel so far. I'm nearly done with Art's, and then I have Cal's to do.""The two spent a pleasant morning chatting together over their fancy-work, saying nothing very wise, perhaps, but neither did they say any thing harmful: an innocent jest now and again, something--usually laudatory--about some member of the family connection, and remarks and directions about their work, formed the staple of their talk.""Business kept my husband, and love for him and his society kept me,"" returned Zoe, with a look and smile that altogether belied any suspicion Ella might have had that she was fretting over the disappointment.""Well, I don't believe I should have been willing to stay behind, even in your place. I've always had a longing to spend a winter there visiting my sister Isa, and my cousins Elsie and Molly. Cal and Art say, perhaps one or both of them may go on to spend two or three weeks this winter; and in that case I shall go along.""""Perhaps we may go at the same time, and what a nice party we will make!"" said Zoe. ""There,"" glancing from the window, ""I see my husband coming, and I want to run out and speak to him. Will you excuse me a moment?"" and scarcely waiting for a reply, she ran gayly away.""Ah! I hope you have had a pleasant time together--not too much troubled by fear of a lecture from the old tyrant who bears your lessons,"" he said laughingly, as he bent his head to press a kiss of ardent affection upon the rosy lips she held up to him.Zoe had feared the hours when Edward was unavoidably absent from her side would be very lonely now while the other members of the Ion family were away; but she did not find it so; her studies, and the work of making various pretty things for Christmas gifts, keeping her very busy.And, when he was with her, time flew on very rapid wings. She had grown quite industrious, and generally plied her needle in the evenings while he read or talked to her. But occasionally he would take the embroidery, or whatever it was, out of her hands, and toss it aside, saying she was trying her eyes by such constant use; and, besides, he wanted her undivided attention."
"This was when they were alone: but very frequently they had company to spend the day, afternoon, or evening; for Ion had always been noted for its hospitality; and scarcely a week passed in which they did not pay a visit to the Oaks, the Laurels, the Pines, or Roselands.Also a brisk correspondence was carried on with the absent members of the family. And Zoe's housekeeping cares and duties were just enough to be an agreeable variety in her occupations: every day, too, when the weather permitted, she walked or rode out with her husband.It was a disappointment that Edward found himself too busy to make the hoped-for trip to Viamede at Christmas-time; yet Zoe did not fret over it, and really enjoyed the holidays extremely, giving and receiving numerous handsome presents, and, with Edward's assistance, making it a merry and happy time for the servants and other dependants, as well as for the relatives and friends still in the neighborhood.The necessary shopping, with Edward to help her, and the packing and sending off of the Christmas-boxes to Viamede, to the college-boys,--Herbert and Harold,--and numerous other relatives and friends far and near, Zoe thought altogether the most delightful business she had ever taken in hand.""No, I did not know, or suspect, that we had nearly so many,"" she interrupted, laughing: ""no wonder letters go astray when people are not particular to give the names of both county and State. But what were you going to say about driving over there?""""I must see a gentleman on business, who will be there to meet the five-o'clock train, and leave on it; and, in order to be certain of seeing him, I must be there at least fifteen or twenty minutes before it is due. Shall I have the pleasure of my wife's company in the carriage? I have ordered it to be at the door by fifteen or twenty minutes past four, which will give us plenty of time, as it is an easy matter to drive from here to Union in ten minutes.""""You are the best little woman about that,"" he returned, with an appreciative look and smile. ""I don't remember that you have ever yet kept me waiting, when told beforehand at what time I intended to start.""""Not gladder than I am to have you,"" he said, with a very lover-like glance and smile. ""I always enjoy your society, and am always proud to show my friends and acquaintances what a dear little wife I have. I dare say I'm looked upon as a very fortunate fellow in that respect, and sometimes envied on account of having drawn such a prize in the matrimonial lottery.""""In spite of the coin being such as you have a right to help yourself to whenever you will?"" she returned with a merry laugh. ""O Ned, my lover-husband!"" she added, laying her head on his breast, ""I am so happy in belonging to you, and I can never love you enough for all your goodness to me!""""But I owe every thing to you,"" she responded with emotion. ""If you had not come to my aid when my dear father was taken from me, what would have become of me, a mere child, without a near relative in the world, alone and destitute in a foreign land?""""But I loved you, dearest. I sought my own happiness, as well as yours, in asking you to be my wife. So you need never feel burdened by the idea that you are under any special obligation to me, to whom you are the very sunshine of life.""""Dear Ned, how very kind in you to say so,"" she responded, gazing with ardent affection into his eyes; ""but it isn't burdensome to be under obligation to you, any more than it is a trial to be ruled by you,"" she added, with playful tenderness; ""and I love to think of all your goodness to me.""It was five minutes past four by Zoe's watch, and she just about to go to her dressing-room to put on her hat and cloak, when visitors were announced,--some ladies who always made a lengthened call at Ion; so she at once resigned herself to the loss of her anticipated drive with her husband.They were friends whose visits were prized and enjoyed, though their coming just at this time was causing Zoe a real disappointment. However, Edward's promise of a drive with him at a later hour so far made amends for it, that she could truthfully express pleasure in seeing her guests.Edward chatted with them for a few moments, then, excusing himself on the plea of business that could not be deferred, left them to be entertained by Zoe, while he entered his waiting carriage, and went on his way to the village, where he expected to meet his business acquaintance. Edward had met and held his desired interview with his business acquaintance, seen him aboard his train, and was standing watching it as it steamed away and disappeared in the distance, when a feminine voice, close at hand, suddenly accosted him."
"""By inviting me to Ion to spend the night,"" she returned laughingly. ""I've missed my train, and was quite in despair at the thought of staying alone over night in one of the miserable little hotels of this miserable little village. So I was delighted to see your carriage standing there, and you yourself beside it; for, knowing you to be one of the most hospitable of men, I am sure you will be moved to pity, and take me home with you.""Edward's heart sank at thought of Zoe, but, seeing no way out of the dilemma, ""Certainly,"" he said, and helped his self-invited guest to a seat in his carriage, placed himself by her side, and bade the coachman drive on to Ion.""Now, really, this is very good in you, Mr. Travilla,"" remarked Miss Deane: ""there is no place I like better to visit than Ion, and I begin to think it was rather a fortunate mishap--missing my train.""""Very unfortunate for me, I fear,"" sighed Edward to himself. ""The loss of her drive will be a great disappointment to Zoe, and the sight of such a guest far from making it up to her. I am thankful the visit is to be for only a night.""Aloud he said, ""I fear you will find it less pleasant than on former occasions,--in fact, rather lonely; as all the family are absent--spending the winter at Viamede, my mother's Louisiana plantation--except my wife and myself.""Zoe's callers had left; and she, having donned hat and cloak, not to keep her husband a single moment, was at the window watching for his coming, when the carriage came driving up the avenue, and drew up at the door.She hurried out, expecting to find no one there but himself, and to be at once handed to a seat in the vehicle, and the next minute be speeding away with him, enjoying her drive all the more for the little disappointment that had preceded it.""How do you do, my dear Mrs. Travilla? I hope you are glad to see me?"" laughed the intruder, holding out a delicately gloved hand, ""your husband has played the Good Samaritan to me to-night--saving me from having to stay in one of those wretched little hotels in the village till two o'clock to-morrow morning.""""I am in usual health, thank you. Will you walk in?"" returned Zoe in a freezing tone, and utterly ignoring the offered hand. ""Will you step into the parlor? or would you prefer being shown to your room first?""""No, Zoe, I should be very far from approving of that,"" he answered gravely: ""but while it was right and truthful not to express pleasure which you did not feel, at her coming, you might, on the other hand, have avoided absolute rudeness; you might have shaken hands with her, and asked after her health and that of her father's family.""""I treated her as well as she deserved; and it does not make her any the more welcome to me, that she has already been the means of drawing down upon me a reproof from my husband's lips,"" Zoe said in tremulous tones, and turning away from him with her eyes full of tears.""And I wanted my drive with you so badly,"" she murmured, half hiding her face on his breast; ""but she has robbed us of that, and--O Ned! is she to come between us again, and make us quarrel, and be so dreadfully unhappy?"" Her voice was full of tears and sobs before she had ended.""No, no; I could not endure that any more than you,"" he said with emotion, and clasping her very close: ""and it is only for to-night you will have to bear the annoyance of her presence; she is to leave in the morning.""They were cordially welcomed, asked to tea, and staid the evening, greatly relieving Zoe in the matter of entertaining her unwelcome guest, who devoted herself to the doctor, and left Edward to his wife and cousin, a condition of things decidedly agreeable to Zoe.""We are going to have a heavy storm. I think,"" remarked Arthur, glancing upward: ""there is not a star to be seen, and the wind blows almost a gale. I hope no patient of mine will want the doctor very badly to-night,"" he added with a slight laugh. ""Step in out of the wind, cousin Zoe, or you may be the very one to send for me."""
"""No, no; never hesitate when there is a real necessity,"" he returned, speaking from his seat in the carriage, where he had already taken his place beside his sister, whom Edward had handed in. ""Good-night, and hurry in, both of you, for my sake if not for your own.""""Zoe, love, don't allow yourself to grow bitter and sarcastic,"" Edward said, turning toward her, laying a hand lightly, affectionately, upon her shoulder, and gazing down into her eyes with a look of grave concern.""She always sets Ned to scolding me,"" was the bitter thought in her heart as she went slowly back to the parlor, where they had left Miss Deane, Edward following, sighing inwardly at the change in his darling always wrought by that unwelcome presence in the house.""How the wind roars down the chimney!"" Miss Deane remarked as her host and hostess re-entered the room, where she was comfortably seated in an easy-chair beside the glowing grate. ""I fear to-morrow will prove a stormy day; but in that case I shall feel all the more delighted with my comfortable quarters here,--all the more grateful to you, Mr. Travilla, for saving me from a long detention in one of those miserable little country taverns, where I should have died of _ennui_.""""You are not displeased with me, dear?"" Zoe asked, lifting her eyes inquiringly to her husband's face as she stood before their dressing-room fire with his arm about her waist: ""you are looking so very grave.""""No, dearest, I am not disposed to find fault with you,"" he said, softly caressing her hair and cheek with his disengaged hand; ""though I should be glad if you could be a trifle more cordial to our uninvited guest.""""It's my nature to act just as I feel; and, if there's a creature on earth I thoroughly detest, it is she!"" returned the child-wife with almost passionate vehemence. ""I know she hates me,--for all her purring manner and sweet tones and words,--and that she likes nothing better than to make trouble between my husband and me.""""My dear child, you really must try not to be so uncharitable and suspicious,"" Edward said in a slightly reproving tone. ""I do not perceive any such designs or any hypocrisy in her conduct toward you.""""No: men are as blind as a bat in their intercourse with such women; never can see through their designs; always take them to be as sweet and amiable as they pretend to be. It takes a woman to understand her own sex.""""I hope not, indeed, love,"" he responded; ""but let us resolve, that, if it does, we will try to bear the infliction patiently, and give our self-invited guest no right to accuse us of a lack of hospitality toward her. Let us not forget or disobey the Bible injunction, to 'use hospitality one to another without grudging.'""""And that is all I ask, love. Your perfect freedom from any thing approaching to deceit is one of your greatest charms, in your husband's eyes,"" he said, tenderly caressing her. ""It would, I am sure, be quite impossible for me to love a wife in whose absolute truth and sincerity I had not entire confidence.""""Suppose they should,"" she said, turning slightly pale, as with sudden pain. ""O Ned! if I live, I must some day grow old and gray and wrinkled, my eyes dim and sunken: shall you love me then, darling?""""Better than ever, love,"" he whispered, holding her closer to his heart; ""for how long we shall have lived and loved together! We shall have come to be as one indeed, each with hardly a thought or feeling unshared by the other."" Zoe's sleep that night was profound and refreshing, and she woke in perfect health and vigor of body and mind; but the first sound that smote upon her ear--the dashing of sleet against the window-pane--sent a pang of disappointment and dismay to her heart.""Quite, I am afraid. If she should offer to go,"" he added mischievously, ""we will not be more urgent against it than politeness demands, and, if she persists, will not refuse the use of the close carriage as far as the depot."""
"Zoe was not far wrong in her estimate of her guest. Miss Deane was both insincere and a thoroughly selfish person, caring nothing for the comfort or happiness of others. She had perceived Zoe's antipathy from the first day of their acquaintance, and took a revengeful, malicious delight in tormenting her; and she had sufficient penetration to see that the most effectual way to accomplish her end was through Edward. The young wife's ardent and jealous affection for her husband was very evident; plainly, it was pain to her to see him show Miss Deane the slightest attention, or seem interested in any thing she did or said; therefore the intruder put forth every effort to interest him, and monopolize his attention, and at the same time contrived to draw out into exhibition the most unamiable traits in Zoe's character, doing it so adroitly that Edward did not perceive her agency in the matter, and thought Zoe alone to blame. To him Miss Deane's behavior appeared unexceptionable, her manner most polite and courteous, Zoe's just the reverse.Zoe began each day with heroic resolve to be patient and forbearing, sweet-tempered and polite, toward her tormentor, and ended it with a deep sense of humiliating failure, and of having lost something of the high esteem and admiration in which her almost idolized husband had been wont to hold her.Feeling that, more or less of change in her manner toward him was inevitable; less sure than formerly of his entire approval and ardent affection, a certain timidity and hesitation crept into her manner of approaching him, even when they were quite alone together; she grew sad, silent, and reserved: and he, thinking her sullen and jealous without reason, ceased to lavish endearments upon her, and, more than that, half unconsciously allowed both his looks and tones to express disapprobation and reproof.The storm kept Edward in the house: at another time that would have been a joy to Zoe, but now it only added to her troubles, affording constant opportunity to the wily foe to carry out her evil designs.On the evening of the second day from the setting in of the storm, Miss Deane challenged Edward to a game of chess. He accepted at once, and with an air of quiet satisfaction brought out the board, and placed the men.Miss Deane was a more than ordinarily skilful player, and so was he; indeed, so well matched were they, that neither found it an easy matter to checkmate the other: and that first game proved a long one,--so long that Zoe, who had watched its progress with some interest in the beginning, eager to see Edward win, at length grew so weary as to find it difficult to keep her eyes open, or refrain from yawning.""Certainly: that will be decidedly best,"" she promptly replied, following the direction of his glance. ""I feel so fresh, and have enjoyed myself so much, that I had no idea of the hour, and am quite ashamed of having kept my youthful hostess up so late,"" she added, looking sweetly at Zoe. ""Very young people need a large amount of sleep, and can't keep up health and strength without it.""""Sour grapes,"" he said lightly: ""she will never see twenty-five again, and would give a great deal for your youth. And since you are exactly the age to suit me, why should you care a fig for her sneers?""Putting his arm round her waist, and drawing her to him, ""I don't want a piece of perfection for my wife,"" he said; ""she would be decidedly too great a contrast to her husband: and I have never yet seen the woman or girl I should be willing to take in exchange for the one belonging to me. And I'm very sure such a one doesn't exist.""""I'm afraid she will stay for that, even if the storm is over,"" sighed Zoe. ""Dear me! I don't see how anybody can have the face to stay where she is self-invited, and must know she isn't a welcome guest to the lady of the house. I'd go through any storm rather than prolong a visit under such circumstances.""""You would never have put yourself in such a position,"" Edward said. ""But I wish you could manage to treat her with a little more cordiality. I should feel more comfortable. I could not avoid bringing her here, as you know; nor can I send her away in such inclement weather, or, indeed, at all, till she offers to go; and your want of courtesy toward her--to put it mildly--is a constant mortification to me.""""Why don't you say at once that you are ashamed of me?"" she exclaimed, tears starting to her eyes again, as with a determined effort she freed herself from his grasp, and moved away to the farther side of the room.On waking, she found that Edward had risen before her; she heard him moving about in the dressing-room; then he came to the door, looked in, and, seeing her eyes open, said, ""Ah, so you are awake! I hope you slept well? I'm sorry for your sake that it is still storming."""
"""The worst of it is, that she manages to make me appear so unamiable and unattractive in my husband's eyes,"" she sighed to herself. ""But I'll foil her efforts,"" she added, between her shut teeth, springing up, and beginning her toilet as she spoke: ""he likes to have me bright and cheery, and well and becomingly dressed, and so I will be.""But the bright, joyous expression of her face suddenly changed to one of anger and chagrin as she caught the sound of his and Miss Deane's voices in the hall below, and, looking over the balustrade, saw them go into the library together.She hastened to do so, but, before she reached the foot of the stairway, the breakfast-bell rang; and, instead of going into the library, she passed on directly to the dining-room, and, as the other two entered a moment later, gave Miss Deane a cold ""Good-morning,"" and Edward a half reproachful, half pleading look, which he, however, returned with one so kind and re-assuring that she immediately recovered her spirits, and was able to do the honors of the table with ease and grace.Coming upon her in that room alone, an hour later, just as she had dismissed Aunt Dicey with her orders for the day, ""Little wife,"" he said, bending down to give her the coveted caress, ""I owe you an explanation.""""Still, I think it best to explain,"" he said. ""I had finished attending to the little matters I spoke of,--writing a note, and giving some directions to Uncle Ben,--and was on my way back to our apartments, when Miss Deane met me on the stairway, and asked if I would go into the library with her, and help her to look up a certain passage in one of Shakspeare's plays, which she wished to quote in a letter she was writing. She was anxious to have it perfectly correct, she said, and would be extremely obliged for my assistance in finding it.""""I know, dear, that you try not to be; and it shall be my care to avoid giving you the least occasion. And I do again earnestly assure you, you need have no fear that the first place in my heart will not always be yours.""""I don't know how I can help you out of it,"" he said, after a moment's consideration, ""unless by shutting myself up alone,--to attend to correspondence or something,--and leaving you to entertain her by yourself. Shall I do that?""This proved a worse day to her than either of the preceding ones. Miss Deane succeeded several times in rousing her to an exhibition of temper that very much mortified and displeased Edward; and his manner, when they retired that night to their private apartments, was many degrees colder than it had been in the morning. He considered himself forbearing in refraining from remark to Zoe on her behavior; while she said to herself, she would rather he would scold her, and have done with it, than keep on looking like a thunder-cloud, and not speaking at all. He was not more disgusted with her conduct than she was herself, and she would own it in a minute if he would but say a kind word to open the way.""Oh,"" cried Miss Deane, ""do see the sun! Now I shall no longer need to encroach upon your hospitality, my kind entertainers. I can go home by this afternoon's train, if you, Mr. Travilla, will be so very good as to take or send me to the depot.""Yet she pitied her pain, and was anxious to do what she could for her relief. She hastened to the medicine-closet in search of remedies; while Edward and Uncle Ben gently lifted the sufferer, carried her in, and laid her on the sofa.Also a messenger was at once despatched for Dr. Conly. Zoe stationed herself at a front window of the drawing-room to watch for his coming. Presently Edward came to her side. ""Zoe,"" he said, ""can't you go to Miss Deane?""""She has plenty of helpers about her,--Christine, Aunt Dicey, and a servant-maid or two,--who will do all they can to relieve her. If I could do any thing more, I would; but I can't, and should only be in the way. You forget what a mere child you have always considered me, and that I have had no experience in nursing.""""There's the doctor,"" said Zoe. ""You'd better consult with him about his patient; and, if he thinks my presence in her room will hasten her recovery, she shall have all I can give her of it, that we may get her out of the house as soon as possible."""
"Zoe remained where she was, shedding some tears of mingled anger and grief, then hastily endeavoring to remove their traces; for Arthur would be sure to step into the parlor, to see her before leaving, if it were but for a moment.""It is a severe sprain,"" he said: ""she will not be able to bear her weight upon that ankle for six weeks."" Then seeing Zoe's look of dismay, shrewdly guessing at the cause, he hastened to add, ""But she might be sent home in an ambulance a few days hence, without the least injury.""""I'll do so,"" said Arthur, rising to go; ""but I have a long drive to take, in another direction, before returning to Roselands. And you must remember,"" he added with a smile, ""that I lend her for only a few days. Cal and I wouldn't know how to do without her very long.""Zoe colored angrily. ""I don't care who knows it,"" she retorted, with a little toss of her head. ""I did not think it _necessary_ to let Arthur into the secret, as you call it (I don't consider it one), but neither did I see any objection to his knowing about it.""Then, after a moment's silence, in which Zoe's face was turned from him so that he could not see its expression, ""Won't you go now, and ask if Miss Deane is any easier? Surely, as her hostess, you should do so much.""""No, I won't! I'll do all I can to make her comfortable; I'll provide her with society more agreeable to her than mine; I'll see that she has interesting reading-matter, if she wants it; I'll do any thing and every thing I can, except that; but you needn't ask that of me.""He was dumb with astonishment and pain. ""What has come over her?"" he asked himself. ""She has always before been so delighted to go any and every where with me. Have I been too ready to reprove her of late? I have thought myself rather forbearing, considering how much ill-temper she has shown. She has had provocation, to be sure; but it is high time she learned to exercise some self-control. Yet perhaps I should have been more sympathizing, more forbearing and affectionate.""He had stepped into his carriage, and was driving down the avenue. He passed through the great gates, and turned into the road, still thinking of Zoe, and mentally reviewing their behavior toward each other since the unfortunate day in which Miss Deane had crossed their threshold.The conclusion he presently arrived at was, that he had not been altogether blameless; that, if his reproofs had been given in more loving fashion, they would have been received in a better spirit; that he had not been faithful to his promise always to try ""love and coaxing"" with the impulsive, sensitive child-wife, who, he doubted not, loved him with her whole heart; and, once convinced of that, he determined to say so on his return, and make it up with her.True, it seemed to him that she ought to make the first advances toward an adjustment of their slight differences (quarrels they could scarcely be called; a slight coldness, a cessation of accustomed manifestations of conjugal affection, a few sharp or impatient words on each side), but he would be too generous to wait for that; he loved her dearly enough to sacrifice his pride to some extent; he could better afford that than the sight of her unhappiness.In the mean time Zoe was bitterly repenting of the rebuff she had given him. He had hardly closed the door when she started up, and ran to it to call him back, apologize for her curt refusal to go with him, and ask if she might still accept his invitation. But it was too late: he was already beyond hearing.She could not refrain from another cry, and was very angry with herself for her petulance. She regretted the loss of the drive, too, which would have been a real treat after the week of confinement to the house."
"""Ah! you have come at last!"" was the salutation she received on entering the room where Miss Deane lay on a sofa, with the injured limb propped upon pillows. ""I began to fear,"" sweetly, ""that your delicate nerves had given way under the sight of my sufferings.""""My nerves are not delicate,"" returned Zoe coldly; ""in fact, I never discovered that I had any; so please do not trouble yourself with anxiety on that account. I trust the applications have relieved you somewhat.""""No, not at all,"" said Zoe; ""at least, not so far as I am concerned."" Miss Deane looked her incredulity and surprise, and Zoe explained,--""I think I may as well be perfectly frank with you,"" she said. ""You have not worn out your welcome with me, because I had none for you when you came. How could I, knowing that you invariably make trouble between my husband and myself?""""I prefer truth and sincerity."" said Zoe, ""I shall do all I can to make you comfortable while you are here; and, if you choose to avoid the line of conduct I have objected to, we may learn to like each other. I very well know that you do not love me now.""""Since frankness is in fashion at this moment,"" was the contemptuous retort, ""I will own that there is no love lost between us. Stay,"" as Zoe was about to leave the room, ""let me give you a piece of disinterested advice. Learn to control your quick temper, and show yourself more amiable, or you may find one of these days, when it is too late, that you have lost your husband's heart.""Lose the love of her idolized husband? That would be worse than death. But it should never be: he loved her dearly now (it could not be possible that these last few wretched days had robbed her quite of the devoted affection she had known beyond a doubt to be hers before); and she would tell him, as soon as he came in, how sorry she was for the conduct that had vexed him, and never, no, never again, would she do or say any thing to displease him, or lower herself in his estimation.""Gone,"" Ella responded, moving on into the hall. ""Come, let's go into the parlor, and sit down, and I'll tell you all I know about it. Why, Zoe,"" as she turned and caught sight of her companion's face, ""you are as pale as death, and look ready to faint! There's nothing to be scared about, and you mustn't mind my nonsense.""""Nothing, child, nothing, except that we met cousin Horace on our way here, and he carried Ned off to Union. They had to hurry to catch a train, in order to be in time for some business matter in the city, I didn't understand what: so Ned couldn't wait to write the least bit of a note to tell you about it; and he told me to explain every thing to you, and say you were not to fret or worry, not even if he shouldn't get home to-night; for he might not be able to finish up the business in time for even the last train that would bring him.""The color had come back to Zoe's cheek, but her countenance was still distressed; and as Ella concluded, two scalding tears rolled quickly down her face, and plashed upon the small white hands lying clasped in her lap.""Yes,"" said Zoe, with a not very successful effort to smile through her tears: ""who wouldn't be, in my place? I owe every thing to Ned, and he pets and indulges me to the greatest extent. Besides, he is so good, noble, and true, that any woman might be proud to be his wife.""""Yes: I admit every word of it; but all that doesn't explain your tears,"" returned Ella, half sympathizingly, half teasingly. ""Now, I should have supposed that anybody who could boast of such a piece of perfection for a husband would be very happy."""
"""I'm afraid I'm very silly, and have been making you very uncomfortable,"" said Zoe, hastily wiping away her tears, ""and it's a great shame; particularly, considering that you have kindly come on purpose to help me through with a disagreeable task.""Apologies are quite uncalled for,"" returned Ella lightly, as they went up-stairs together. ""I have always had a good time at Ion, and don't believe this is going to be an exception to the general rule. But do you know,"" lowering her voice a little, ""I don't propose to spend nearly all my time with that hateful Miss Deane. I never could bear her.""They were now in the room Ella was to occupy, and she was taking off her hat and cloak. ""Oh, never mind! I was delighted to come anyhow,"" she answered gayly, as she threw aside the latter garment, and took possession of an easy-chair beside the open fire. ""To tell you a secret,"" she went on laughingly, ""I like my cousins Ned and Zoe Travilla immensely, and am always glad of an excuse to pay them a visit. But that Miss Deane,--oh! she's just _too sweet_ for _any thing!_"" making a grimace expressive of disgust and aversion, ""and a consummate, incorrigible flirt: any one of the male sex can be made to serve her turn, from a boy of sixteen to a man of seventy-five.""""Sour grapes,"" laughed Ella. ""I wouldn't let it vex me in the least: it's all to hide her envy of you, because you are really young, and married too. I know very well she's dreadfully afraid of being called an old maid.""""Shall we go down now?"" she asked. ""It is nearly dinner-time; and we shall have to dine alone unless some one drops in unexpectedly,"" she added, as they left the room together, and passed down the stairs, arm in arm.""I should think Art had sufficient penetration to see through her,"" said Zoe. ""But no; on second thoughts, I'm not so sure; for Ned will have it that it's more than half my imagination when I say she sneers at me.""To the girl-wife the message seemed but cold and formal. ""So different from the way he talks to me when he is not vexed or displeased, as he hardly ever is,"" she whispered to herself with starting tears during the solitary drive back to Ion. ""I know it's silly--telegrams can't be loving and kind: it wouldn't do, of course--but I can't help feeling as if he is angry with me, because there's not a bit of love in what he says. And, oh, dear! to think he may be away two nights, and I'm longing so to tell him how sorry I am for being so cross this morning, and before that, too, and to have him take me in his arms and kiss me, and say all is right between us, that I don't know how to wait a single minute!""But when the two had retired to their respective apartments, Zoe felt very lonely, and said to herself that she would rather have Edward there, even silent and displeased, as he had been for several days past, than be without him.""Oh, dear!"" she sighed half aloud, as she opened her eyes, and glanced round the room, ""what shall I do if he doesn't come to-day? I'll have to stand it, of course; but what does a woman do who has no husband?"" And for the first time she began to feel some sympathy for Miss Deane, as a lonely maiden lady.She thought a good deal about her unwelcome guest while attending to the duties of the toilet, and determined to treat her with all possible kindness during the remainder of her enforced stay at Ion. So, meeting, on her way to the breakfast-room, the old negress who had been given charge of Miss Deane through the night, she stopped her, and asked how her patient was."
"""Jes' pow'ful cross dis hyar mawnin', Miss Zoe,"" was the reply, in a tone of disgust. ""Dar isn't one ob de fambly dat would be makin' half de fuss ef dey'd sprained bofe dey's ankles. Doan ye go nigh her, honey, fear she bite yo' head off.""""She's pow'ful cross,"" repeated Aunt Phillis: ""she done gone call dis chile up time an' again fru de night; an' when I ax her, 'Whar yo' misery at?' she say, 'In my ankle, ob c'ose, yo' ole fool you! Cayn't yo' hab nuff sense to change de dressin'?'""""Perhaps so,"" returned her cousin, laughing; ""yet I don't think that can be all that ails me, for I have heard married women express the same opinion quite frequently. What shall we do with ourselves to-day, Zoe? I've no notion of devoting myself exclusively to Miss Deane's entertainment, especially if she is really as cross as reported.""""No, indeed! I couldn't bear to let you, even if you were willing,"" replied Zoe with decision. ""I consented to your taking my place in that, only because I supposed you found her agreeable; while to me she is any thing else.""""Yes; but, on the other hand, I should lose all the enjoyment of looking forward through the whole day, to seeing him this evening. Following your plan, I shouldn't have half so happy a day as if I keep to my own.""""In hopes of finding a note from Ned, I suppose. I don't believe there can be one there that would bring you later news than yesterday's telegram. But I have no objection to making sure, and would as soon ride in that direction as any other.""It was a cheering idea to Zoe: she brightened up at once, and in the afternoon drove over the same road, feeling almost certain Edward would be on the incoming train, due about the time she would reach the village, or rather at the time she had planned to be there. Ella, who had asked to accompany her, was slow with her dressing, taxing Zoe's patience pretty severely by thus causing ten minutes' detention.""No, I dare say not,"" returned the latter, trying to speak with perfect pleasantness of tone and manner; ""and he isn't one of the impatient ones, who can never bear to be kept waiting a minute, like myself,"" she added with a smile. ""Now, Uncle Ben, drive pretty fast, so that we won't be so very far behind time.""""No, nor have I,"" said Ella; ""and we ought to have heard it fully five minutes before it got in. There may have been a detention. That is nothing very unusual,"" she hastened to add, as she saw that Zoe had suddenly grown very pale.""I suppose the train must have got in some time ago,--perhaps before we left Ion,"" replied Ella, in a re-assuring tone; ""and all the passengers have dispersed to their homes, or wherever they were going.""""Dar doan' 'pear to be nobody 'bout dis hyar depot,"" remarked Uncle Ben reflectively; ""but I reckon dar's somebody comin' to 'splain de mattah. Wha's de 'casion ob dis mos' onusual state ob t'ings?"" he added, as a woman, who been watching the carriage and its occupants, the open door of a neighboring house, came miming in their direction.""Dunno, Miss,"" was the reply; ""but,"" pointing up the road, ""it's out dat way, 'bout a mile, I reckon. Yo see, de kyars was a comin' fas' dis way, and 'nudder ole injine whiskin' 'long dat way, and dey bofe comes togedder wid a big crash, breakin' de kyars, and de injines bofe of em, till dey's good for nuffin' but kin'lin' wood; and de folks what's ridin' in de kyars is all broke up too, dey says; and de doctahs and body""--"
"She lifted her head; and her eye instantly fell upon a little group, scarcely a yard distant, consisting of several men, among whom she recognized Dr. Conly, gathered about an apparently insensible form lying on the ground.Ella and Ben saw it too. She suddenly caught the reins from his hands: he sprang from the carriage, and, lifting Zoe in his strong arms as if she had been but a child, set her on her feet, and supported her to the side of the prostrate man; the little crowd respectfully making way for her, at the words spoken by Ben in a voice half choked with emotion, ""Hit's Marse Ed'ard's wife, gen'lemen.""There was no response, no movement, not the quiver of an eyelid; and she lifted her grief-stricken face to that of the doctor, with a look of anguished inquiry in the beautiful eyes fit to move a heart of stone.""Not much, but I feel strangely confused. I should like to be taken home as soon as possible. But not to the neglect of any one who may have been more seriously hurt than I,"" he added, feebly raising his head to look about him.""There, I positively forbid any more talking,"" said Arthur, with a mixture of authority and playfulness. ""Here is the ambulance. Help me to lift him in, men,"" to the by-standers. ""And you, cousin Zoe, get into your carriage, and drive on behind it, or ahead if you choose.""Zoe would not stir till she had seen Edward put into the ambulance, and made as comfortable for his ride home as circumstances would permit. Then, as the vehicle moved slowly off, she hurried to her carriage.""Arthur is perfectly truthful,"" asserted Ella, with some warmth. ""He may keep his opinions to himself at times, but he never builds people up with false hopes. So cheer up, coz,"" she added, squeezing Zoe's hand affectionately.""I know that what you say of cousin Arthur is all true,"" sobbed Zoe; ""but I could see he had fears as well as hopes: and--and--Ned doesn't seem a bit like himself; he has such a dazed look, as if not quite in his right mind."" Christine and Aunt Phillis, who had been left in charge of Miss Deane, had had a sore trial of patience in waiting upon her, humoring her whims, listening to her fretting and complaints, and trying to soothe and entertain her. She was extremely irritable, and seemed determined not to be pleased with any thing they could do for her.""Yes, Miss, Ise alluz t'ought Miss Zoe hab pretty manners and a pretty face,"" replied Aunt Phillis; ""but dere is ladies what habn't none, an' doan' git pleased wid nuffin' nor nobody, an eayn't stan' no misery nowhars 'bout deirselves, but jes' keep frettin' and concessantly displainin' 'bout dis t'ing and dat, like dey hasn't got nuffin' to be thankful for.""But they were already out of hearing. ""I was never so shamefully treated anywhere as I am here,"" muttered the angry lady, sinking back upon her pillows. ""I'll leave this house to-morrow, if it is a possible thing, and never darken its doors again.""""Well, I'm sure I hope Mr. Travilla won't die,"" responded Miss Deane, ""or prove to be permanently injured in any way.--Ah, Christine!"" as the latter re-entered the room: ""what is all this story about a railroad accident? Is Mr. Travilla killed?""Ella was with her, and now and then tried to speak a comforting word, which Zoe scarcely seemed to hear. She sat with her hands clasped in her lap, listening intently to catch every sound from the room where her injured husband lay. She looked pale and anxious, and occasionally a tear would roll quickly down her cheek.""That does not necessarily follow,"" Arthur said, taking her hand, and holding it in a kindly pressure. ""But you must be more composed, or,"" playfully, ""I shall be compelled to exert my authority so far as to forbid you to go to him."""
"""My dear little cousin,"" he said in a tenderly sympathizing tone, ""I wish to do all in my power to relieve your anxiety, but am as yet in some doubt myself as to the extent of his injuries. He is a good deal shaken and bruised; but, as I have said before, there are no broken bones; and, unless there should be some internal injury which I have not yet discovered, he is likely to recover entirely in a few days or weeks.""""Try not to meet trouble half way, little cousin,"" he said gently. ""'Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,' and 'As thy days, so shall thy strength be.' It is God's promise to all who put their trust in him, and cannot fail; all his promises are yea and amen in Christ Jesus.""""I certainly do,"" he responded in cheerful accents. ""And now, if you will wipe away your tears, and promise to be very good and quiet, I will take you to him. He was asking for you when I left the room.""""Of course Mrs. Travilla should give all her attention to her husband now,"" she remarked; ""and I shall be only in the way. One disabled person is quite enough to have in a house at one time. So if you, doctor, will be so kind as to have the ambulance sent out for me directly after breakfast, I'll be much obliged.""Zoe's poor heart was longing to pour itself out into her husband's ear in words of contrition, penitence, and love; and only the fear of injuring him enabled her to restrain her feelings, and remain calm and quiet, kneeling there close by his side, with her hand in his. She couldn't rest till she told him how very, very sorry she was for the petulance of the past few days, and especially for the cold rejection of his invitation to accompany him on his drive to Roselands, how firmly resolved never again to give him like cause to be displeased with her, and how dearly she loved him.It was hard; yet there was strong consolation in the certainty that his dear love was still hers. She read it in his eyes, as they gazed fondly into hers; felt it in the tender pressure of his hand; heard it in the tones of his voice, as he called her his ""darling, his own precious little wife.""Yet she was tormented with the fear that his accident had affected his mind and memory for the time, so that he had forgotten the unkindness of the morning; and that, when returning health and vigor should recall the facts to his remembrance, he would again treat her with the coldness and displeasure merited by her behavior.She did not want to leave him to take either food or rest; but Arthur insisted that she should go down to tea, and later to bed, leaving Edward in his care; and she finally yielded to his persuasions, and exertion of medical authority.She objected that it was quite useless to go to bed; she was positively sure she could not sleep a wink: but her head had scarcely touched the pillow before she fell into a profound slumber, for she was quite worn out with anxiety and grief.She must learn as speedily as possible how Edward was; not worse, surely, for Arthur had promised faithfully to call her at once if there should be any unfavorable change during the night. Still, a light tap at the door made her start, and turn pale; and she opened it with a trembling hand.Ella stood there with a bright, smiling countenance. ""Good-morning, coz,"" she said gayly. ""I bring you good news,--two pieces of it. Ned is almost himself again; Arthur is entirely satisfied that there is no serious injury,--internal or otherwise; and Miss Deane has already set out for her home, leaving me to give you her adieus. Now are you not happy?""""Oh, yes, yes!"" she sobbed. ""And I didn't deserve it; for I was so cross to you day before yesterday, when you asked me to go with you: and I'd been cross for days before that. Can you, will you, forgive me, dear Ned?""""It is so good in you to say that,"" she sobbed. ""Oh, if you had been killed, as I thought for one minute you were, I could never have had an hour of peace or comfort in this world! Those unkind words would have been the last I ever spoke to you; and I should never have been able to forget them, or the sad look that your face must have worn as you turned away. I didn't see it, for I had rudely turned my back to you; but I could imagine it: for I knew you must have been hurt, and grieved too."""
"""So I was, little wife,"" he said tenderly, and passing his hand caressingly over her hair and cheek: ""but a few moments' honest retrospect showed me that I was not blameless, had not been as forbearing and affectionate in my treatment of my darling little wife, for the past few days, as I ought to have been; and I resolved to tell her so, on the first opportunity.""""Because it reflects the light and joy in my heart,"" she returned. ""Wouldn't it be strange if I were not happy in knowing that my husband is not seriously hurt? Oh, we have been so happy together, that I have often feared it could not last!""""There seems every reasonable prospect that it will,"" Arthur said, as they seated themselves at the table. ""You are both young and healthy, your tastes are congenial, and you have enough of this world's goods to enable you to live free from carking cares and exhausting labors.""Zoe was in so great haste to return to Edward, that she could scarce refrain from eating her breakfast more rapidly than was consistent with either politeness toward her guests or a due regard for her own health: but she tried to restrain her impatience; and Arthur, who perceived and sympathized with it, exerted himself for her entertainment, telling amusing anecdotes, and making mirth-provoking remarks.Ella, perceiving his designs, joined in, in the same strain. Zoe presently entered into their mood, and they seemed, as in fact they were, a light-hearted and happy little breakfast party; both Arthur and Ella feeling greatly relieved by the favorable change in their cousin, not for Zoe's sake alone, but also because of their own affection for him.Edward no longer needed Arthur as nurse: indeed, Zoe claimed the right to a monopoly of the, to her, sweet task of waiting upon him, and attending to all his wants. So Arthur resigned in that capacity, but was to continue his visits as physician.""Arthur has condemned me to lie here for a full week,"" he said. ""It would seem a weary while in the prospect, but for the thought of having, through it all, the sweet companionship of my darling little wife.""""Dear Ned, how good in you to say so!"" she murmured, kneeling beside the bed, and laying her cheek to his. ""I don't believe there's another creature in the world that thinks my society of much account.""""If you are right in that, which I very much doubt,"" he said with a smile of incredulity, ""it only shows their want of taste, and makes no difference to us, does it, love, since we are all the world to each other?""""I am sure it makes no difference to me,"" she responded: ""if you love, and are pleased with, me, it's very little I care what anybody else may think or say about me. But, oh! isn't it nice to be alone together again?""""Yes, dearest, I expect to employ you in all those capacities by and by; but at present, I want nothing but to have you sit by my side, and talk to me, while I hold your hand, and feast my eyes on the face that is to me the dearest in all the world.""At that, the pretty face was suffused with blushes and smiles. ""I'm so happy! so very happy!"" she murmured, stealing an arm round his neck. ""It is such a change from yesterday, when for a little while, I--I thought you--were gone, and--and without my having had a chance to ask your forgiveness.""""No,"" he said, with emotion, and drawing her closer to him; ""we should not have parted so; we had promised each other we would not; and I should have gone to you and made it up with you before leaving the house.""""Thank God that we are spared to each other!"" he said with fervent gratitude. ""And now, dear wife, let us try to forget that there has been ever any coldness or clashing between us. Let us enjoy the present, and be as happy in each other as if no cloud, even the slightest, had ever come over our intercourse as husband and wife."""
"""Yes,"" she said. Then, lifting her face, and gazing earnestly into his, ""How pale and exhausted you look!"" she cried in alarm. ""I have talked, and let you talk, too much and too excitingly. I'm afraid cousin Arthur will say I am but a poor sort of nurse. Now,"" withdrawing herself from his embrace, and gently re-arranging his pillows, and smoothing the bed-clothes, ""shut your eyes, and try to sleep. I'll stay close beside you, and be as quiet as a mouse.""With a faint smile, he did as he was bidden; and she fulfilled her promise to the letter, watching beside him with love and solicitude for two hours, till his eyes again unclosed, and met hers, gazing so tenderly upon him, with an answering look of ardent affection.""I know you to be the most devoted of nurses, when it is I who require your services,"" he returned, with a tenderly appreciative smile. ""You are the best of little wives. But you must be very weary, and I want you now to go and take some exercise in the open air.""""Well,"" she said laughing, ""it won't hurt me if it does: you can't hurt me in that way any more; for do you know, Ned,"" and she bent lovingly over him, pressing a kiss upon his forehead, ""I have become such a silly thing, that I actually enjoy obeying you,--when you don't order me as if you thought I wouldn't do as you wish, and you meant to force me to it.""She rang for refreshment, saw him take it, then left him for a short time in the care of old Aunt Phillis, while she donned riding hat and habit, mounted her pony, and flew over several miles of road and back again.""'I love to tell the story Of unseen things above, Of Jesus and his glory, Of Jesus and his love. I love to tell the story, Because I know it's true: It satisfies my longings As nothing else can do.""I love to tell the story: More wonderful it seems, Than all the golden fancies Of all our golden dreams. I love to tell the story, It did so much for me; And that is just the reason I tell it now to thee.""I love to tell the story; 'Tis pleasant to repeat What seems, each time I tell it, More wonderfully sweet. I love to tell the story, For some have never heard The message of salvation From God's own Holy Word.""I love to tell the story; For those who know it best, Seem hungering and thirsting To hear it like the rest. And when in scenes of glory, I sing the new, new song, 'Twill be the old, old story, That I have loved so long.'""""O Ned! why, why do you look so at me?"" she asked, with a sudden burst of tears, and dropping her face on the pillow beside his. He had been holding her hand while she sang; he kept it still, and, laying his other one gently on her head, ""Zoe, my darling,"" he said, in tones tremulous with emotion, ""it is the one longing desire of my heart that you may learn the full sweetness of that old, old story. O love! sometimes the thought, 'What if my precious wife should miss heaven, and our union be only for time, and not for eternity,' sends so keen a pang to my heart, that I know not how to endure it.""""Ah, my darling!"" he sighed, ""that hope is but as a spider's web. Do you not remember that passage in Ezekiel, 'Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord God'? And it is repeated again and again, 'Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.' Zoe, dear, no righteousness but the imputed righteousness of Christ can save the soul from death. He offers it to you, love; and will you continue to reject it?"""
"""Do you not?"" he asked, in some surprise. ""I will try to make it plain. Jesus offers you a full and free salvation, purchased by what he has done and suffered in your stead, that 'God might be just, and yet the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus.'""Oh! you know I just come and acknowledge that I've been hateful and cross, and say how sorry I am, and that I don't mean to behave so any more, and ask you to forgive and love me; and, dear Ned, you are always so willing and ready to do that, you hardly wait till I've said my say, before you put your arms round me, and hug and kiss me, and it's all right between us.""""Yes, dearest; and God, our heavenly Father, is far more ready to receive and forgive us when we turn to him with sorrow for our sins, confessing them and pleading for pardon in the name, and for the sake, of his dear Son, our Saviour,"" ""I'm afraid I don't feel half so sorry as I ought.""""'By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.' So you see, we have to go to Jesus for it all,--for repentance, for faith, for salvation from the guilt and love of sin, and from eternal death.""The plan of salvation is very simple,--its very simplicity seems to stumble many; they don't know how to believe that it is offered them as a free gift; they think they must do something to merit it; but it cannot be bought, it is 'without money and without price.' 'Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely,' Come to Jesus, dear one; come now, for only the present moment is yours; delay is most dangerous, for the invitation may be withdrawn at any time.""Edward read aloud his mother's announcement of the fact. ""Yes,"" said Zoe. ""Betty tells me the same thing. O Ned! how sorry I am for poor Vi! It would be hard enough for her if she had the captain with her, to help bear the burden and responsibility, and to share in her grief if they should die.""Arthur did so: the children were worse than at the date of the letters. He had just received his summons, and would obey it immediately, taking the next train; had called to tell them, and see how Edward was.""She is a very good little wife, and tolerably obedient,"" laughed Edward. ""Really, would you believe it? she told me once she actually enjoyed obeying--under certain circumstances; and so, I suppose, should I. Zoe, you mustn't be too hard on me.""Betty's was a long one, giving a full account, from her point of view, of the contest between Mr. Dinsmore and Lulu Raymond in regard to her refusal to take music-lessons of Signor Foresti after he had struck her. None of the family had mentioned the affair in their letters, even Rosie feeling that she had no warrant to do so; and the story was both new and interesting to Zoe.""Lulu is certainly the most ungovernable child I have ever seen or heard of,"" he remarked, at its conclusion. ""I often wonder at the patience and forbearance grandpa and mamma have shown toward her. In their place, I should have had her banished to a boarding-school long ago, one at a distance, too, so that she could not trouble me, even during holidays.""A second letter from Betty, received a fort-night later, told how it had ended: though Betty, not being in Lulu's confidence as Evelyn was, knew nothing of Capt. Raymond's letter to his daughter, or of Lulu's confession in reply to it; so her story ended with the statement that Lulu had at last submitted, been restored to favor, and was at Magnolia Hall with Evelyn as a companion, all the children who were in health having been banished from Viamede to save them from the danger of catching the dreaded fever.""It must be a very anxious time for them,--the family at Viamede, I mean,"" remarked Edward musingly. ""And poor, dear Vi is so young to have such burdens to bear. What a blessing that she has mamma with her!"""
"""Yes,"" said Zoe. ""And, oh! I hope the children will get well, they are such darlings, both Gracie and the baby. I feel very sorry they are so ill, and yet I can't help rejoicing that my dear husband is able to sit up again.""I think not,"" he answered, smiling down into her eyes. ""It will do them no good for us to make ourselves unhappy. We will sympathize with, and pray for, them, but at the same time be thankful and joyful because of all God's goodness to us and them. 'Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.' 'Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation.'""""You have certainly obeyed that last injunction,"" remarked Zoe, looking at him with affectionate admiration; ""so patient and cheerful as you have been ever since your injury! Many a man would have grumbled and growled from morning to night; while you have been so pleasant, it was a privilege to wait on you.""""Ah!"" he said, ""'a wilful woman will have her way,' I see: there never was a truer saying. No, that won't do,"" as she seated herself with the desk on her lap: ""put it on the table. I can't have you bending over to write on your lap, and so growing round-shouldered, especially in my service.""She ran to him at that, put her arms round his neck, and laid her cheek to his. ""No, Ned, I can't have you say that,"" she murmured, ""you who are so good and wise, while I am such a silly and faulty thing, not at all worthy to be your wife. Whatever made you marry me?""""Dear Ned, my own dear husband!"" she said, hugging him tighter. ""Words could never tell how much I love you, or how I rejoice in your love for me: you are truly my other, my best, half, and I don't know how I could live without you.""""Our mutual love is a cause for great gratitude to God,"" he said reverently. ""There are so many miserably unhappy couples, I feel that I can never be thankful enough for the little wife who suits me so entirely.""""You are my very greatest earthly blessing,"" she replied, lifting her head, and gazing into his face with eyes shining with joy and love; ""and your words make me very, very happy. Now,"" releasing herself from his embrace, ""it's time to attend to business, isn't it? I am ready to write if you will dictate."" And she seated herself before the desk, and took up her pen.It was not a lengthened epistle. He began with an acknowledgment of the receipt of his mother's letter, expressed his sympathy in the sorrow and suffering at Viamede, gave a brief account of his accident, consequent illness, and partial recovery, highly eulogizing Zoe as the best of wives and nurses.""Then let me,"" he said. ""If you will hold the desk on the arm of my chair for five minutes, and give me the pen, I can finish up the thing easily, and without the least danger of hurting my precious self."""
"She did as directed. ""There, now lie back in your chair, and rest,"" she said, when he had finished his note, and signed his name. ""You do look a little tired,"" she added, with an anxious glance at him as she returned the desk to the table.""Oh, no! I was only thinking that mamma, judging of her by myself, would not be half satisfied with such a bare statement of facts, and that I had better write a supplement, giving her more of the particulars.""He complied, lying back at his ease, and amusing himself with watching her, admiring the graceful pose of her figure, the pretty face bending over the paper, and the small, white, shapely hand that was gliding swiftly back and forth.He took both her hands in his, and, gazing with mock gravity up into her face as she stood over him, ""What a little tyrant you are developing into!"" he remarked, knitting his brows. ""Will you order the carriage, and take a drive in my company?""""What a remarkable mixture of tyranny and submission,"" he exclaimed, laughing, as he pulled her down to put his arm round her, and kiss her first on one cheek, then on the other. ""I'll tell you what we'll do: you finish that letter, read it to me, and take the benefit of my able criticisms; then I'll try to get a nap while you take your drive or walk, whichever you prefer.""""That will do nicely,"" she said, returning his caresses; ""if you will be pleased to let me go, I'll order the carriage, finish the letter in five minutes, hear the able criticisms, put my patient to bed, and be off for my drive.""From this time forward, till the children were considered out of danger, and Edward was able to go about and attend to his affairs as usual, there were daily letters and telegrams passing between Viamede and Ion. Then Dr. Conly came home, and almost immediately on his arrival drove over to Ion to see for himself if his patient there had entirely recovered, and to carry some messages and tokens of affection from the absent members of the family.""All in health, except, of course, the two little ones who have been so ill,"" he said, taking the chair Edward drew forward for him; ""and them we consider out of danger, with the careful attention they are sure to have.""""She made the most of her delegated authority,"" remarked Edward gravely. ""I was allowed no will of my own, till I had so entirely recovered from my injuries that she had no longer the shadow of an excuse for depriving me of my liberty.""""It is a lovely place,"" he said. ""I expected to be disappointed after the glowing accounts I had heard, but I feel like saying, 'The half has not been told me;'"" and he plunged into an enthusiastic description of the mansion, its grounds, and the surrounding country.""Yes: letters came from him the day before I started for home. Fortunately, they had been able to keep the report from Vi and little Gracie; but May and Lulu had heard it, and were terribly distressed, I was told.""""Ah, yes! I remember now that Betty told me there had been some trouble between uncle Horace and Lulu in regard to her taking lessons of a music-teacher whom she greatly disliked; that, because of her obstinate refusal, he had banished her from Viamede, entering her as a boarder at the academy the children were all attending; but that her distress of mind over the illness of her little sisters, and the sad report about her father, had led her to submit.""""No,"" assented Edward; ""but it is evident to those who know her well, nevertheless. She tries hard to conceal the fact, and has wonderful patience with the wilful passionate child, really loving her for her father's sake."" Edward and Zoe now began to look forward to the return of the family as a desirable event not very far in the future. They had been extremely happy in each other during almost the whole time of separation from the rest; but now they were hungering for a sight of ""mamma's sweet face,"" and would by no means object to a glimpse of those of grandparents, sisters, and children.At length a letter was received, fixing the date of the intended departure from Viamede, and stating by what train the party would probably reach the neighboring village of Union, where carriages must be in readiness to receive and convey them to Ion.And now Edward and Zoe began counting the days: the little matron put on more housewifely airs than was her wont, and was in great glee over her preparations for a grand reception and welcoming feast to the loved travellers.Edward laughingly asserted that he was almost, if not quite, as much under her orders at that time as when left in her charge by the doctor, and could have no peace but in showing himself entirely submissive, and ready to carry out all her schemes and wishes."
"It was the last of April: lovely spring weather had come, and the head gardeners and their subordinates of both places found much to do in making all trim and neat against the expected arrival of the respective owners; and of these matters Edward took a general oversight.""Ya'as, Miss Zoe,"" he answered, with a broad grin of satisfaction; ""dat's what I'se been a workin' for, an' spects to hab sho', kase Miss Elsie, she doan' nebber grudge nuffin' in de way ob praise nor ob wages, when yo's done yo' bes', ob co'se; an' dis chile done do dat, sho's yo' bawn.""""Yes, I'm sure you have, Cuff,"" said Edward kindly: ""the flowers look very flourishing; there's not a dead leaf or a weed to be seen anywhere; the walks are clean and smooth as a floor; nothing amiss anywhere, so far as I can perceive.""Edward hastened to re-assure her. ""Altogether, good news, isn't it?"" he said. ""We can be quite ready, I am sure, and will escape some hours of waiting; while they will gain time for rest and refreshment before the arrival of the family party who are to gather here from the Oaks, Roselands, the Laurels, and the Pines.""""Oh, yes, yes! it is ever so nice! and I'm as glad as I can be,"" she cried rapturously. ""Now let us make haste to get our breakfast, and then attend to the finishing touches needed by the house and our own persons.""""Stay,"" said Edward, detaining her as she was starting up the steps into the veranda. ""We should send word to Fairview, but it will be time enough after breakfast. Suppose we ride over there immediately upon leaving the table, and carry the news ourselves? The air and exercise will do you good.""They were very gay over their breakfast and during their ride; for they were young, healthy, happy in each other; the morning air was delicious, and not a cloud was to be perceived in either the natural sky above their heads, or in that of their future; all was bright and joyous, and they seemed to have naught to do with sorrow or care, or any of the evils that oppressed the hearts and darkened the lives of many of their fellow-creatures.They were cantering homeward as they talked. Arrived there, Zoe set to work at the pleasant task of adorning the house--""mamma's"" boudoir in particular--with beautiful and sweet-scented flowers, and contrived to be delightfully busy in their arrangement till some little time after Edward had gone with the carriages to meet and bring home the travellers.""No, mamma, not that, though willing enough to resign my position to you,"" was the gay rejoinder. ""But my delight is altogether because you are so dear and sweet, that everybody must be the happier for your presence.""Lulu had been on her very best behavior ever since the termination of the controversy between Mr. Dinsmore and herself in regard to her tuition by Signor Foresti; and she had returned to Ion full of good resolutions, promising herself, that, if permitted to continue to live at Ion, she would henceforward be submissive, obedient, and very determined in her efforts to control her unruly temper.But was she to be allowed to stay there? No objection had been raised by any of the family; but remembering her father's repeated warning, that, if she proved troublesome to these kind friends, he would feel compelled to take her away from Ion, and send her to a boarding-school, she awaited his decision with much secret apprehension.It was quite too soon to look for a response to her confession, written from Magnolia Hall, or a letter from him to her mamma, grandma Elsie, or grandpa Dinsmore, giving his verdict in regard to her; and, at times, she found the suspense very hard to bear.Thus far, Evelyn Leland had been the sole confidant of her doubts, fears, and anxieties on the subject; not even Max having been made acquainted with the contents of either her father's letter to her, or her reply to it.But, on the evening of this day, Grace and baby Elsie were fast asleep, the one in bed, the other in her dainty crib, at an early hour; and Violet bethought her of Lulu in connection with the expected assembling of a large family party.She found her already dressed,--suitably and tastefully too,--and sitting by a window in an attitude of dejection, her elbow on the sill, her head on her hand; but she was not looking out; her eyes were downcast, and her countenance was sad.""Ok, no, no, mamma Vi! it's not that. I should be very glad to get back, if I were only sure of being allowed to stay,"" Lulu answered, lifting her head, and hastily wiping a tear out of the corner of her eye. ""But I--I'm dreadfully afraid papa will say I can't; that I must be sent away somewhere, because of having been so disobedient and obstinate."""
"""Thank you for saying that, mamma Vi. I have been trying with all my might,--asking God to help me too,"" she added low and reverentially; ""but papa doesn't know that, and he has been very near banishing me two or three times before. Oh, I don't know how to wait to hear from him! I wish a letter would come!""Violet explained the cause; and Elsie said, very kindly, ""I don't want you sent away, Lulu, dear. No one could desire a better behaved child than you have been of late; and I have written to your father to tell him so, and ask that you may stay with us still. So cheer up, and hope for the best, little girl,"" she added, with a smile and an affectionate kiss.Lulu had risen, and was standing by Elsie's side. As the latter bent down to bestow the caress, her arms were thrown impulsively about her neck with a glad, grateful exclamation, ""O grandma Elsie! how good you are to me! I don't know how you could want to keep me here, when I've been so bad and troublesome so many times.""""I trust you have been so for the very last time, dear child,"" Elsie responded. ""Think how it will rejoice your father's heart if he learns that you have at length conquered in the fight with your naturally quick, wilful temper, which has been the cause of so much distress to both him and yourself.""""I do think of it very often, grandma Elsie,"" Lulu returned, with a sigh that seemed to come from the depths of her heart. ""And I do want to please papa, and make him happy: but,--oh, dear! when something happens to make me angry, I forget all about it and my good resolutions till it's too late; the first thing I know, I've been acting like a fury, and disgracing myself and him.""""Yes,"" sobbed Evelyn; ""but I could hardly feel more fully orphaned if my mother were dead. And papa has not been gone a year. Oh, how could she! how could she! You see, aunt Elsie, she talks of my joining her as soon as I am my own mistress; but how can I ever think of it now?""""Dear auntie, you and uncle have made it a very happy home to me,"" returned Evelyn gratefully, wiping away her tears as she spoke, and forcing a rather sad sort of smile. ""I should be as sorry to leave it as you could possibly be to have me do so.""Evelyn was of a very quiet temperament, rarely indulging in bursts of emotion of any kind; and Elsie soon succeeded in restoring her to calmness, though her eyes still showed traces of tears; and her expressive features again wore the look of gentle sadness that was their wont in the first weeks of her sojourn at Fairview, but which had gradually changed to one of cheerfulness and content.""Of course, you shall do just as you like, dear child,"" was the kindly response; ""but it is only to be a family party, and you need not be mixed up with any fun or frolic,--I don't suppose there will be any thing of the kind going on,--and you will probably enjoy a private chat with your bosom-friend, Lulu. You know, there are plenty of corners where you can get together by yourselves. I think you would find it lonely staying here, and Lulu would not half enjoy her evening without you.""""You are right, auntie: I will go,"" Evelyn answered, more cheerfully than she had spoken since reading her letter. ""I will dress at once, but shall not need any help except advice about what I shall wear.""""O Max! you forget that mamma Vi does not approve of slang,"" she said. ""But I don't deserve a bit of praise for confessing, because I had to. Papa wrote to me that he was sure I'd been misbehaving,--though nobody had told him a single word about it,--and that I must write at once, and tell him every thing."""
"""Well, I'm glad you did; and I hope he won't be hard on you, Lu. Still, I wouldn't like to be in your place, for papa can be quite severe when he thinks it necessary. I wouldn't fret, though,"" he added in a consolatory tone, ""because there's no use trying to cross the bridge before you come to it, 'specially when you mayn't come at all.""""Why, of course I should,"" he said. ""We've gone through a good deal together, and you know we've always been rather fond of each other, considering that we're brother and sister,"" he added laughingly. ""Ah, here comes Eva!"" and he lifted his hat with a profound bow as a turn in the walk brought them face to face with her.""Yes: it is even prettier than Fairview, I have always thought. But that's a sweet place too and aunt Elsie and uncle Lester are delightful to live with. I only wish I was as sure as you are of such a sweet home.""She ended with so profound a sigh, that Lulu turned a surprised, inquiring look upon her, asking, ""Have you had any bad news, Eva? I know you have been looking anxiously for a letter from your mother.""""No, it was not that--not now. Mamma knows that, because of the way papa made his will, I must stay with uncle Lester till I come of age. She talks of my going to her then; but I cannot,--oh, I never can! for,--Lulu, she's married again, to an Italian count; and it is not a year since my dear, dear father was taken from us.""""Indeed, I've no idea of doing that,"" Eva said indignantly. ""I only hope he may never cross my path; and so I--feel as if my mother is lost to me. You are far better off than I, Lulu: you have your own dear father still living, and aunt Vi is so lovely and sweet.""This interval of waiting lasted for over two months, a longer period of silence on the part of the husband and father than usual; but, as they learned afterward, letters had been delayed in both going and coming.With a swelling heart he read of the sore trial she had been passing through, in the severe illness of Gracie and the babe. Deeply he regretted not having been there to lighten her burdens with his sympathy and help in the nursing; and though, at the time of writing, she was able to report that the little sufferers were considered out of danger, he could not repress a fear, amid his thankfulness, that there might be a relapse, or the dread disease might leave behind it, as it so often does, some lasting ill effect.He sighed deeply as he laid it down after a careful perusal, during which his face had grown stern and troubled, and, rising, paced the cabin to and fro, his hands in his pockets, his head bowed on his breast, which again and again heaved with a deep-drawn sigh.""What I am to do with that child, I do not know,"" he groaned within himself. ""If I could make a home for her, and have her constantly with me, I might perhaps be able to train her up aright, and help her to learn the hard lesson how to rule her own spirit.""I could not do that, however, without resigning from the service; and that would be giving up my only means of earning a livelihood for her as well as the others and myself. That is not to be thought of: nor could I forsake the service without heartfelt regret, were I a millionnaire.""The captain was a man of prayer. Some moments were spent on his knees, asking guidance and help for himself, and a change of heart for his wayward little daughter; then, again seating himself at his writing-table, he opened yet another letter, one whose superscription he recognized as that of a business agent in one of our far Western States.That sheet of paper was the bearer of most strange, unlooked-for tidings: a tract of wild land, bought by him for a trifle years before, and long considered of little or no value, had suddenly become--by the discovery that it contained rich mineral deposits, and the consequent opening of mines, and laying out of a town upon it--worth many thousands, perhaps millions of money."
"And he--Capt. Raymond--was the undisputed owner of it all,--of wealth beyond his wildest dreams. He could scarce believe it: it seemed impossible. Yet it was undoubtedly true; and a bright vision of a lovely home, with wife and children about him, rose up before his mind's eye, and filled him with joy and gratitude to the Giver of all good.But stay! could he now, in the prime of life, forsake the service for which he had been educated, and to which he had already given many of his best years? Could he be content to bid a final farewell to the glorious old ocean so long his home, so beautiful and lovable in its varied moods, and settle down upon the unchanging land, quite reconciled to its sameness? Would he not find in himself an insatiable longing to be again upon the ever restless sea, treading once more the deck of his gallant ship, monarch of her little world, director of all her movements?It was not a question to be decided in a moment; it required time for thought; a careful consideration of seemingly conflicting duties; a careful balancing of inclinations and interests, and for seeking counsel of his best, his almighty and all-wise, Friend.At Ion, as the summer heats approached, the question was mooted, ""Where shall we spend the next two or three months?"" After some discussion, it was decided that all should go North to Cape May for a time: afterward they would break up into smaller parties, and scatter to different points of interest, as they might fancy.Lulu's heart beat very fast at sight of them. She had been full of delight at the prospect of her Northern trip, especially the visit to be paid with Evelyn to her former home; the latter having in their private talks dwelt much upon its many attractions, and the life she had led there in the sweet companionship of her beloved father.""Would there be any thing in papa's letter to prevent the carrying out of the cherished plans?"" Lulu asked herself as, in fear and trembling, she watched Violet opening with eager fingers the packet handed her at the breakfast-table.""MY DEAR LITTLE DAUGHTER [it ran],--The story of your misconduct has given a very sad heart to the father who loves you so dearly. I forgive you, my child, but can no longer let you remain at Ion to be a trouble and torment to our kind friends there. I shall remove you elsewhere as soon as I can settle upon a suitable place. In the mean time, if you are truly sorry for the past, you will, I am sure, earnestly strive to be patient, submissive and obedient to those who have you in charge.""And that's all; just that I am to go away, nobody knows where; to be separated from Max and Gracie and every one else that I care for: and when papa comes home, maybe he won't visit me at all; or, if he does, it will be for only a little bit, because, of course, he will want to spend most of his leave where the others are. Oh, dear! oh, dear! I wish I'd been good! I wish I'd been born sweet-tempered and patient, like Gracie. I wonder if papa will ever, _ever_ let me come back!The captain's letter to his wife made the same announcement of his intentions in regard to Lulu; adding, that, for the present he would have her disposed of as should seem best to them--Mr. Dinsmore, his daughter, and Violet herself--upon consultation together; he had entire confidence, he said, in their wisdom and their kind feeling toward his wayward, troublesome, yet still beloved child; so that he could trust her to their tender mercies without hesitation.He went on to say (and, ah, with what a smile of exultation and delight those words were penned!), that ""there was a possibility that he might be with them again in the fall, long enough to find a suitable home for Lulu; and, in the mean time, would they kindly seize any opportunity that presented itself, to make inquiries in regard to such a place?""Finding Violet alone in her dressing-room, giving the captain's missive another perusal, ""Mamma Vi,"" she said, ""what--what does papa tell you about me?"" She spoke hesitatingly, her head drooping, her cheeks hot with blushes. ""I mean, what does he say is to be done with me?"""
"Violet pitied the child from the bottom of her heart. ""I wish, dear,"" she said, ""that I could tell you he consented to mamma's request to let us try you here a little longer; but--doesn't he say something about it in his note to you?""""Yes, mamma Vi,"" Lulu answered chokingly: ""he says he can't let me stay here any longer, to be such a trouble and torment to you all, and will put me somewhere else as soon as he can find a suitable place; but he doesn't say what is to be done with me just now.""Violet was quite moved by the child's emotion. ""You have been a dear good girl of late, and we feel glad to take you with us,"" she said, drawing her to her side, and giving her an affectionate kiss. ""Your father says there is a possibility that he may be at home with us again for a while, in the fall; he expects to settle you somewhere then: but if you continue to be so good, perhaps he may relent, and allow you still to have a home with us. I am quite sure that such a child as you have been for the last two or three months, would be heartily welcome to us all.""""It's ever so good in you to say that, mamma Vi,"" returned the little girl, furtively wiping her eyes; ""and I'm determined to try with all my might. I'd want to do it to please papa, even if I knew there wasn't one bit of hope of his letting me stay. I don't think there is much, because, if he decides a thing positively, he's very apt to stick to it.""""Yes, I know; but he will doubtless take into account that circumstances alter cases,"" Violet answered lightly, and with a pleasant smile. ""And at all events, you may be quite sure that whatever small influence I may possess will be exerted in your behalf.""""Yes,"" she said; and in he rushed, with a face full of excitement. ""Lu, I've been looking everywhere for you!"" he cried. ""What do you think? just see that!"" and he held up a bit of paper, waving it triumphantly in the air, while he capered round the room in an ecstasy of delight.Lulu looked astounded for an instant; then the tears welled up into her eyes as she said falteringly, ""I--don't deserve it; and--I thought papa was so vexed with me, I should never have expected he'd give me a single cent.""""He's just a splendid father, that's what he is!"" cried Max, with another bound of exultant delight. ""He says that if we go to the mountains, and grandpa thinks I can be trusted with a gun, I'm to have one of the best that can be bought; and, if I'm a splendid boy all the time, when he comes home I shall have a fine pony of my own.""Still, she wondered within herself, for a moment, if her husband had in some way become a little richer than he was when last he described his circumstances to her. Had he had a legacy from some lately deceased relative or friend? (surely no one could be more deserving of such remembrance) or an increase of pay? But no, he would surely have told her if either of those things had happened; and with that thought, the subject was dismissed from her mind.He had not told her of his good fortune--the sudden, unexpected change in his circumstances: he wanted to keep it secret till he could see the shining of her eyes, the lighting up of her face, as she learned that their long separations were a thing of the past; that in future they would have a home of their own, and be as constantly together as Lester and Elsie, Edward and Zoe.""Dear child, I know you would,"" Violet said. ""But take what he has sent, and be happy with it; that is what he desires you to do; and I think you need have no fear that he will want for any thing because of having sent it to you.""""Oh! I know all about that,"" laughed Max. ""Papa explained it to me the last time he was at home: I just write my name on the back of that, and take it to a bank, and they'll give me the fifty dollars."""
"""What,--the money? Not till after we go North. Grandpa Dinsmore says it will be best to wait till then, as we won't care to spend any of it here. O Lu!--you are going along, I suppose?--what does papa say about--about what you told him in your last letter?""""But perhaps papa may change his mind, if you keep on being as good as you have been ever since you left that school,"" he added. ""But you haven't told me yet whether you are still to go North with us, or not.""Lulu had her greatly desired visit to Cliff Cottage, and enjoyed it nearly as much as she had hoped to; a good deal less than she would if she could have quite forgotten her past misconduct, and its impending consequences.As matters stood, she could seldom entirely banish the thought that the time was daily drawing nearer when her father's sentence would be carried out, to her sad exclusion from the pleasant family circle of which she had now been so long a member.She experienced the truth of the saying, that blessings brighten as they take their flight, and would have given much to undo the past, so that she might prove herself worthy of a continuance of those she had rated so far below their real value, that, in spite of her father's repeated warnings, she had wantonly thrown them away.She kept her promise to Violet, and strove earnestly to deserve a repeal of her sentence, though her hope of gaining it was very faint. All summer long she had exercised sufficient control over her temper to avoid any outbursts of passion, and generally had behaved quite amiably.By the 1st of October the two families were again at home at Ion and Fairview, pursuing the even tenor of their way, Lulu with them, as of old, no new home having yet been found for her. No one had cared to make much effort in that direction. It was just as well, Mr. Dinsmore, Elsie his daughter, and Violet thought, simply to let things take their course till her father should return, and take matters into his own hands.But Lulu had been so amiable and docile for months past, that no one was in haste to be rid of her presence. Even Rosie was quite friendly with her, had ceased to tease and vex her; and mutual forbearance had given each a better opinion of the other than she had formerly entertained.But Lulu grew self-confident, and began to relax her vigilance: it was so long since her temper had got decidedly the better of her, that she thought it conquered, or so nearly so that she need not be continually on the watch against it.Unfortunately it happened again and again that something belonging to Lulu attracted his attention, and was seriously damaged or totally destroyed by his teeth and claws. He chewed up a pair of kid gloves belonging to her; and it did not mend matters that Rosie laughed as though it were a good joke, and then told her it was her own fault for not putting them in their proper place when she took them off: he tore her garden-hat into shreds; he upset her inkstand; tumbled over her work-basket, tangling the spools of sewing-silk and cotton; jumped upon her with muddy paws, soiling a new dress and handsome sash; and at last capped the climax by defacing a book of engravings, belonging to Mr. Dinsmore, which she had carelessly left in his way.""He deserves a great deal more than I gave him,"" retorted Lulu, quivering with passion; ""and if you don't want him hurt, you'll have to keep him out of mischief. Just look what he has done to this book!""For a moment each girlish head drooped in silence, hot blushes dyeing their cheeks; then Lulu, lifting hers, said, ""I'm very sorry, grandpa Dinsmore. I oughtn't to have brought this book out here; but it wouldn't have come to any harm if it hadn't been for that troublesome dog, that's as full of mischief as he can be. I don't believe it was more than five minutes that I left the book lying there on the settee; and when I ran back to get it, and put it away in its place, he had torn out a leaf, and nibbled and soiled the cover, as you see.""That would take a good while, child,"" Mr. Dinsmore answered. ""It is a great pity you were so careless. But I'll not scold you, since you are so penitent, and so ready to make all the amends in your power. Rosie, you really must try to restrain the mischievous propensities of your pet.""""I do, grandpa,"" she said, flashing an angry glance at Lulu; ""but I can't keep him in sight every minute; and, if people will leave things in his way, I think they are more to blame than he is if he spoils them.""""Yes, sir; but I don't wish to keep you waiting; papa wouldn't wish it. He sends his children pocket-money every once in a while, and I'd ask him to keep back what he considered my share till it would count up to as much as the price of the book."""
"""Well, child, that is honorable and right,"" Mr. Dinsmore said in a pleasanter tone; ""but I think we will let the matter rest now till your father comes, which I trust will be before a very great while.""Rosie, knowing that her grandfather was quite capable of carrying out his threat, lacking neither the ability nor the will to do so, curtailed the liberty of her pet, and exerted herself to keep him out of mischief.A stop would have been put to the ""fun"" if the older people of the family had happened to be aware of what was going on; but the dog always seemed to seize the opportunity when none of them were by, and Lulu scorned to tell tales.""Because I heard her tell her mother she didn't; that she meant to drive over to Roselands with grandpa Dinsmore instead; that he had told her he expected to go there to see Cal about some business matter, and would take her with him. So you see, her pony won't be wanted; and grandma Elsie has often said we could have it whenever it wasn't in use or tired, and of course it must be quite fresh this morning.""Then Rosie, glancing from the window, and seeing her pony at the door, ready saddled and bridled, suddenly decided to take a ride, ran to her room, donned riding hat and habit, and was down again a little in advance of Lulu.""That happened very well, because he is here now all ready for me,"" returned Rosie, laughing, as she vaulted into the saddle, hardly giving Max a chance to help her. ""Lu can have him another time. Come, will you go with me?""So he sprang upon his waiting steed; and as Lulu, ready dressed for her ride, and eager to take it, stepped out upon the veranda, she just caught a glimpse of the two horses and their riders disappearing down the avenue.There were several servants standing near, one of them little Elsie's nurse, an old negress, Aunt Dinah, who, having lived in the family for more than twenty years, felt herself privileged to speak her mind upon occasion, particularly to its younger members.""You've no call to put in your word, and I'm not going to be lectured and reproved by a servant!"" retorted Lulu passionately; and turning quickly away, she strode to the head of the short flight of steps leading down into the avenue, and stood there leaning against a pillar, with her back toward the other occupants of the veranda. Her left arm was round the pillar, and in her right hand she held her little riding-whip.Instantly a sound of something falling, accompanied by a faint, frightened little cry, and chorus of shrieks of dismay from older voices flashed upon her the terrible knowledge that she had sent her baby sister rolling down the steps to the hard gravel-walk below.Violet's agonized cry, as she came rushing from the open doorway, ""My baby! oh, my baby! she's killed!"" roused her: and she saw Dinah pick up the little creature from the ground, and place it in its mother's arms, where it lay limp and white, like a dead thing, without sense or motion; the whole household, young and old, black and white, gathering round in wild excitement and grief.She shuddered as she caught a glimpse of its deathlike face, then put her hand over her eyes to shut out the fearful sight. She felt as if she were turning to stone with a sense of the awful thing she had done in her mad passion; then suddenly seized with an overwhelming desire to hide herself from all these eyes, that would presently be gazing accusingly and threateningly at her, she hurried away to her own room, and shut and locked herself in.Her riding-whip was still in her hand. She tossed it on to the window-sill, tore off her gloves, hat, and habit, and threw them aside, then, dropping on her knees beside the bed, buried her face in the clothes, sobbing wildly, ""Oh, I've killed my little sister! my own dear little baby sister! What shall I do? what shall I do?""Moments passed that seemed like hours: faint sounds came up from below. She heard steps and voices, and, ""Was that mamma Vi crying,--crying as if her heart would break? saying over and over again, 'My baby's dead! my baby's dead! killed by her sister, her cruel, passionate sister!' Would they come and take her (Lulu) to jail? Would they try her for murder, and hang her? Oh! then papa's heart would break, losing two of his children in such dreadful ways."
"""Yes: there's nobody else here,"" said the child. ""I came to tell you the baby isn't dead; but the doctor has come, and, I believe, he doesn't feel sure she won't die. O Lu! how could you?"" she asked with a burst of sobs.Then, with a fresh burst of tears and sobs, ""But she's dreadfully hurt, the dear little thing! I heard the doctor tell grandpa Dinsmore he was afraid she'd never get over it; but he mustn't let mamma know yet, 'cause maybe she might.""She stood still, listening intently, Grace doing the same. They had seemed to hear a familiar step that they had not heard for many a long month; yes, there it was again: and with a low cry of joy, Grace bounded to the door, threw it open, but closed it quickly behind her, and sprang into her father's arms.""My darling, my precious little daughter!"" he said, clasping her close, and showering kisses on her face. ""Where is every one? you are the first I have seen, and--why, how you have been crying! What is wrong?""Fairly stunned by the sudden dreadful announcement, he silently submitted himself to her guidance, and suffered her to lead him into the nursery, where Violet sat in a low chair with the apparently dying babe on her lap, her mother, grandfather and his wife, and the doctor, grouped about her.He bent down and kissed the sweet, tremulous lips, his features working with emotion, ""My wife, my dear love, what--what is this? what ails our little one?"" he asked in anguished accents, turning his eyes upon the waxen baby face; and, bending still lower, he softly touched his lips to its forehead.""Oh, do not ask me, love!"" she said entreatingly, and he reluctantly yielded to her request; but light began to dawn upon him, sending an added pang to his heart; suddenly he remembered Lulu's former jealousy of the baby, her displeasure at its birth; and with a thrill of horror, he asked himself if this could be her work.He passed on through the upper hall and down the stairs, then on out to the veranda, where he found a group of servants--of whom Aunt Dicey was one--excitedly discussing the very occurrence he wished to inquire about.They gave a graphic description of the rage Lulu was thrown into at the sight of Rosie galloping away on the pony she had expected to ride, repeated her angry retort in reply to Aunt Dinah's reproof, and told, without any extenuation of the hard facts, how the baby girl, escaping from her nurse's watchful care for a moment, had toddled along to her sister, caught at her skirts for support, and received a savage kick, that sent her down the steps to the gravel-walk below.The captain heard the story with ever increasing, burning indignation. Lulu's act seemed the very wantonness of cruelty,--a most cowardly attack of a big, strong girl upon a tiny, helpless creature, who had an indisputable claim upon her tenderest protecting care.By the time the story had come to an end, he was exceedingly angry with Lulu; he felt that in this instance it would be no painful task to him to chastise her with extreme severity; in fact, he dared not go to her at once, lest he should do her some injury; he had never yet punished a child in anger; he had often resolved that he never would, but would always wait till the feeling of love for the delinquent was uppermost in his heart, so that he could be entirely sure his motive was a desire for the reformation of the offender, and not the gratification of his own passion.Feeling that he had a battle to fight with himself ere he dared venture to discipline his child, and that he must have solitude for it, he strode away down the avenue, turned into a part of the grounds but little frequented, and there paced back and forth, his arms folded on his breast, his head bent, his heart going up in silent prayer for strength to rule his own spirit, for patience and wisdom according to his need.Then he strove to recall all that was lovable about his wayward little daughter, and to think of every possible excuse for the dreadful deed she had done, yet without being able to find any that deserved the name.The expression of his countenance told them that he was already informed of the sad occurrence of the morning; and Edward said with heartfelt sympathy, ""It is but a sad home-coming for you, captain, but let us try to hope for the best: it is possible the little darling has not received any lasting injury.""""Yes,"" said Zoe, ""I did. Violet and I happened to be at the window of the little reception-room overlooking the veranda, and were watching the little creature as she toddled along, and""--But Zoe paused, suddenly remembering that her listener was the father of Lulu as well as of her poor little victim."
"""And Lulu, giving the tender, toddling thing a savage kick, caused the dreadful catastrophe?"" he groaned, turning away his face. ""You need not have feared to tell me. I had already heard it from the servants who were eye-witnesses, and I only wanted further and undoubtedly reliable testimony.""""I think,"" said Edward, ""that Lulu really had no idea what it was she was kicking at. I happened to be out in the grounds, and coming round the corner of the house just in time to catch her look of horror and despair as she half turned her head and saw the baby fall.""""Oh, of course!"" she returned, laughing, then sobering down with a sudden recollection of the sorrow in the house. ""But, O Ned! how heartless we are to be joking and laughing when poor Vi and the captain are in such distress!""""I shall try to do what is best for her, my little girl, though I very much doubt if that is exemption from punishment,"" he said with an involuntary sigh. ""But if she is in haste to see me,"" he added, ""there is nothing, so far as I am aware, to prevent her from coming to me.""Hours, that to Lulu seemed like weeks or months. Alone in her room, in an agony of remorse and fear, she waited and watched and listened for her father's coming, longing for, and yet dreading it, more than words could express.Naturally of a very impatient temperament, suspense and passive waiting were well-nigh intolerable to her. By turns she walked the floor, fell on her knees by the bedside, and buried her face in a pillow, or threw herself into a chair by table or window, and hid it on her folded arms.Yet, when at last the expected step drew near, she shuddered, trembled, and turned pale with affright, and, starting to her feet, looked this way and that with a wild impulse to flee: then, as the door opened, she dropped into her chair again, and covered her face with her shaking hands.""Miserable child!"" he said at length, ""do you know what your terrible temper has wrought?--that in your mad passion you have nearly or quite killed your little sister? that, even should she live, she may be a life-long sufferer, in consequence of your fiendish act?""""You deserve it,"" he said: ""indeed, I could not possibly inflict a worse punishment than your conduct merits. But what is the use of punishing you? nothing reforms you! I am in despair of you! You seem determined to make yourself a curse to me instead of the blessing I once esteemed you. What am I to do with you? Will you compel me to cage or chain you up like a wild beast, lest you do some one a fatal injury?""""Oh!"" she moaned, ""it's worse than if he had beaten me half to death! he thinks I'm too bad, even to be punished; because nothing will make me good: he says I'm a curse to him, so he must hate me; though he used to love me dearly, and I loved him so too! I suppose everybody hates me now, and always will. I wish I was dead and out of their way. But, oh! no, I don't; for I'm not fit to die. Oh! what shall I do? I wish it was I that was hurt instead of the baby. I'd like to go away and hide from everybody that knows me; then I shouldn't be a curse and trouble to papa or any of them."""
"She lifted her head, and looked about her. It was growing dusk. Quick as a flash came the thought that now was her time; now, while almost everybody was so taken up with the critical condition of the injured little one; now, before the servants had lighted the lamps in rooms and halls.Always impulsive, and now full of mental distress, she did not pause a moment to consider, but, snatching up a hat and coat lying conveniently at hand, stole noiselessly from the room, putting them on as she went.She gained a side-door without meeting any one; and the grounds seemed deserted as she passed round the house and entered the avenue, down which she ran with swift footsteps, after one hasty glance around to make sure that she was not seen.But the next instant some one had caught her: a hand was on her shoulder, and a stern, astonished voice cried, ""Lulu! is it possible this can be you? What are you doing out here in the public road alone, and in the darkness of evening? Where were you going?""A servant had brought in a light during Lulu's absence; and now, looking timidly up at her father, she saw his face for the first time since they had bidden each other farewell a year before. It struck her as not only very pale, stern, and grief-stricken, but very much older and more deeply lined than she remembered it: she did not know that the change had been wrought almost entirely in the last few hours, yet recognized it with a pang nevertheless.""Papa is growing old,"" she thought: ""are there gray hairs in his head, I wonder?"" Then there came dimly to her recollection some Bible words about bringing a father's gray hairs down with sorrow to the grave. ""Was her misconduct killing her father?"" She burst into an agony of sobs and tears at the thought.""Take off that hat and coat, get your night-dress, and make yourself ready for bed,"" he commanded, then, stepping to the table, sat down, drew the lamp nearer, opened her Bible, lying there, and slowly turned over the leaves as if in search of some particular passage, while she moved slowly about the room, tremblingly and tearfully obeying his order.""Lucilla,"" he said, and his accents were not stern, though very grave and sad, ""you cannot have forgotten that I have repeatedly and positively forbidden you to go wandering alone about unfrequented streets and roads, even in broad daylight; yet you attempted to do that very thing to-night in the darkness, which, of course, makes it much worse.""""Supposing I did desire to be rid of you,--which is very far from being the case,--I should have no right to let you go; for you are my own child, whom God has given to me to take care of, provide for, and train up for his service. You and I belong to each other as parent and child: you have no right to run away from my care and authority, and I have none to let you do so. In fact, I feel compelled to punish the attempt quite severely, lest there should be a repetition of it.""""It was an act of daring, wilful disobedience,"" he said, ""and I must punish you for it. Also, for the fury of passion indulged in this morning. Read this, and this, aloud,"" he added, pointing to the open page; and she obeyed, reading faltering, sobbingly,--""'Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.' ... 'Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.'""""Yes, papa; and--and I--I--'most want you to whip me for hurting the baby so. I suppose nobody believes I'm sorry, but I am. I could beat myself for it, though I didn't know it was the baby pulling at my skirt. I thought it was Rosie's dog."""
"""It is not exactly for hurting the baby,"" he said; ""if you had done that by accident, I should never think of punishing you for it: but for the fury of passion that betrayed you into doing it, I must punish you very severely.""You can never enter heaven unless you gain the victory over that, as well as every other sin: and, my daughter, there are but two places to choose from as our eternal home,--heaven and hell; and I must use every effort to deliver your soul from going to that last--dreadful place!""He rose, stepped to the window where her little riding-whip still lay, came back to her; and for the next few minutes she forgot mental distress in sharp, physical pain, as the stinging, though not heavy, blows fell thick and fast on her thinly covered back and shoulders.When he had finished, he sat down again, and drew the weeping, writhing child in between his knees, put his arm about her in tender, fatherly fashion, and made her lay her head on his shoulder; but he said not a word. Perhaps his heart was too full for speech.Presently Lulu's arm crept round his neck. ""Papa,"" she sobbed, ""I--I do love you, and I--I'm glad you wouldn't let me run away,--and that you try to save me from losing my soul. But oh, I _can't_ be good! I wish, I _wish_ I _could!_"" she ended, with a bitter, despairing cry.He did so, making her kneel beside him, while, with his arm still about her, he poured out a prayer so earnest and tender, so exactly describing her feelings and her needs, that she could join in it with all her heart. He prayed like one talking to his Father and Friend, who he knew was both able and willing to do great things for him and his.""No; but I never before had so little reason to bestow a caress on you,"" he said. ""When I heard of your deed of this morning, I felt that I ought not to show you any mark of favor, at least not until I had given you the punishment you so richly deserved. Do you not think I was right?""""Strange!"" he said; ""but I suppose you were forgotten in the excitement and anxiety every one in the house has felt ever since the baby's sad fall. And they may have felt it unnecessary to bring any thing to you, as you were quite able to go to the dining-room for it.""""I have already punished you in what I consider a better way, because it could not injure your health,"" he said; ""while going a long time without food would be almost sure to do so. It is not my intention ever to punish my children in a way to do them injury. Present pain is all I am at all willing to inflict, and that only for their good.""""If I did not love you, if you were not my own dear child,"" he said, laying his hand on her head as he stood by her side, ""I don't think I could be at the trouble and pain of disciplining you as I have to-night. But eat your supper: I can't stay with you much longer, and I want to see you in bed before I go.""""Do you hear that?"" he asked. ""Now, suppose I had let you go when I caught you trying to run away, how would you feel, alone out of doors, in the darkness and storm, no shelter, no home, no friends, no father to take care of you, and provide for your wants?""""O papa! it would be very, very dreadful!"" she sobbed, putting her arm round his neck as he bent over her. ""I'm very glad you brought me back, even to punish me so severely; and I don't think I'll ever want to run away again.""""I trust not,"" he said, kissing her good-night; ""and you must not leave this room till I give you permission. I intend that you shall spend some days in solitude,--except when I see fit to come to you,--that you may have plenty of time and opportunity to think over your sinful conduct and its dire consequences."""
"""Nor I of you, dearest,"" he answered, bending down to kiss her pale cheek, then taking a seat close beside her; ""but I had to seek solitude for a time while fighting a battle with myself. Since that I have been with Lulu.""""I cannot yet,"" returned Violet, a hard look that he had never seen there before stealing over her face; ""and that is an added distress, for 'if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.' I think I can if my baby recovers; but should it--be taken away--or--or, worse by far, live to be a constant sufferer--oh, how can I ever forgive the author of that suffering! Pray for me, my dear husband,"" she sobbed, laying her head on his shoulder.""Perhaps it may aid the effort, if I tell you Lulu did not intentionally harm her little sister, and is greatly distressed at her state. She thought it was Rosie's dog pulling at her skirts; and I own that that explanation makes the sad affair a little less heart-rending to me, though I could not accept it as any excuse for an act done in a fury of passion, and have punished her very severely for it; that is, for her passion. I think it is right, under the circumstances, that you should know that I have, and that it is my fixed purpose to keep her in solitary confinement, at least so long as the baby continues in a critical condition.""""Oh! I am glad to know it was not done purposely,"" Violet exclaimed,--though in a tone hardly raised above a whisper,--lifting her tearful eyes to his face with a look of something like relief: ""knowing that, I begin to feel that it may be possible to forgive and forget, especially if the consequences do not prove lasting,"" she added with a sob, and turning her eyes to the little wan face on the pillow. ""But I certainly take no delight in the severity of her punishment: in fact, I fear it may destroy any little affection she has had for her baby sister.""""No,"" he said, ""I am not at all apprehensive of that. When she found I was about to punish her, she said she almost wanted me to; that she felt like beating herself for hurting the baby, then went on to explain her mistake,--thinking it was the dog tugging at her dress,--and I then gave her fully to understand, that the chastisement was not for hurting the baby, but for indulging in such a fury of passion, a fault that I have punished her for on more than one former occasion; telling her, too, that I intended to chastise her every time I knew of her being guilty of it.""""Yes, my child, so far as to keep her in solitude, that she may have plenty of time to think about what she has brought upon herself and others by the indulgence of an ungovernable temper. She needs to have the lesson impressed upon her as deeply as possible.""""So am I, daughter,"" he said; ""but I think, that to see that she has the full benefit of this sad lesson, will be the greatest kindness I can do her. And my little Grace must try to believe that papa knows best.Leaving him, she went to Violet, put her arms about her neck, and said in her sweet, childish treble, ""Dear mamma, don't feel so dreadfully about baby: I've been asking God to make her quite, quite well; and I do believe he will.""""My husband, my dear, dear husband,"" she murmured, ""I am so glad to have you here! I cannot tell you how I longed for you when the children were so ill. Oh, if we could only be together always, as Lester and Elsie, Edward and Zoe, are!""""It is even so: I mean all I have said,"" he answered to the look. ""I have sent in my resignation: it has been accepted, and I have come home--no, I have come _here_ to _make_ a home for you and my children, hoping to live in it with you and them for the rest of my days.""Her face had grown radiant. ""Oh! can it be true?"" she cried, half under her breath; for even in her glad surprise, the thought of her suffering babe and its critical condition was present with her: ""are we not to be forced apart again in a few days or weeks? not to go on spending more than half our lives at a distance from each other?""""It cost me a struggle to give up the service,"" he said in conclusion; ""and perhaps I might not have decided as I did, but for the thought that, if I should be needed by my country at some future day, I could offer her my services; and the thought that, at present, wife and children needed me more, probably, than she. I felt that Lulu, in particular, needed my oversight and training; that the task of bringing her up was too difficult, too trying, to be left to other hands than those of her father; and I feel that still more sensibly since hearing of this day's doings,"" he added in a tone of heartfelt sorrow.""I think you are right,"" Violet said. ""She is more willing to submit to your authority than to that of anybody else; as, indeed, she ought to be: and in a home that she will feel is really her own, her father's house, and with him constantly at hand, to watch over, and help her to correct her faults, there is hope, I think, that she may grow to be all you desire."""
"""No, oh, no!"" she answered earnestly. ""I have great hopes of her, with her father at hand to help her in the struggle with her temper; for I am sure she does struggle against it; and I must acknowledge, that, for months past, she has been as good and lovable a child as one could desire. I don't know a more lovable one than she is when her temper does not get the better of her; and, as Gracie says, whenever it does, 'she gets sorry very soon.'""""My darling,"" he said, pressing the hand he held, ""you are most kind to be so ready to see what is commendable in my wayward child. I cannot reasonably expect even you to look at her with her father's partial eyes. And dearly as I certainly do love her, I have been exceedingly angry with her to-day; so angry, that, for a time, I dared not trust myself to go near her, I, who ought to have unlimited patience with her, knowing, as I do, that she inherits her temper from me.""""I don't know how to believe that, my dear, good husband,"" Violet said, gazing up into his face with fond, admiring eyes; ""for I have never seen any evidence of it. If you have such a temper, you have certainly gained complete mastery of it. And that may well give us hope for Lulu.""""I do not despair of her,"" he said; ""though I was near doing so to-day--for a time--after hearing a full account of her passionate behavior--her savage assault, as it seemed to be, upon her baby sister.""""Oh!"" moaned Violet, bending over the little one with fast-falling tears,--for it was moaning as if in pain,--""my baby, my poor, precious baby! how gladly mamma would bear all your suffering for you, if she could! O Levis! what shall we do if she is taken from us?""""Dear wife, I hope we may not be called to endure that trial,"" he said; ""but, in any case, we have the gracious promise, 'As thy days, so shall thy strength be.' And that blessed assurance, for our consolation, in regard to her, 'He shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom.'""""Nor I; but we will try to leave it all with Him. We will rejoice if she is spared to us; and, if not, we will be glad to know that she is so safe, so happy with Him--gathered with His arm, carried in His bosom.""""I took a nap on purpose to be able to sit up to-night,"" Elsie said; ""also, I am less exhausted by mental distress than her mother is, dearly as I love her. Can you not trust her to me, with the doctor sharing my vigil?""The morning brought a slight change for the better, yet no certainty of recovery; but even that barely perceptible improvement, joined to the delightful prospect of always having her husband at home, cheered Violet greatly.The captain hoped to buy or build in the near neighborhood of Ion, that Violet need not be separated from her mother,--a separation he was most desirous to avoid on his own account, also; for he entertained a very high regard and warm affection for his mother-in-law, averring that it would be scarcely possible for him to love her better were he her own son.He had resigned to Violet the pleasure of telling the joyful news to her mother and the whole family, except his children; reserving to himself the right to communicate the glad tidings to them when, and in what way, he should deem best.At a very early hour in the morning, Elsie and the doctor came to the relief of the watchers. Arthur noted and announced the improvement, thus reviving hope in the anxious hearts of the parents; and before retiring for a few hours' rest and sleep, Violet whispered to them the news that had gladdened her heart in spite of its heavy load of grief and fear.Pain, mental and physical, kept Lulu awake a good while after her father left her; but at length she fell into a deep sleep, which lasted far beyond her customary hour for rising, the house being very still, because of the baby's illness, and the blinds down in her room, so that there was neither light nor noise to rouse her.Her first thoughts on awaking were a little confused: then, as with a flash, all the events of yesterday came to her remembrance, bringing with them bitter upbraidings of conscience, and torturing anxieties and fears.If that were so, how could she ever look him, or anybody else, in the face again? And what would be done to her? was there any danger that she would be put in prison? oh! that would be far worse than being sent to a boarding-school, even where the people were as strict and as disagreeable as possible!"
"All the time she was attending to the duties of the toilet, these thoughts and feelings were in her mind and heart; and her fingers trembled so that it was with difficulty she could manage buttons and hooks and eyes, or stick in a pin.Glancing at the little clock on the mantel, when at last she was quite dressed, and ready for her breakfast, she saw that it was more than an hour past the usual time for that meal; yet no one had been near her, and she was very hungry; but, even if her father had not forbidden her to leave the room, she would have preferred the pangs of hunger to showing her face in the dining-room.""Dar it am,"" she remarked, when she had set it on the table. ""I s'pose mos' likely yo' kin eat ef de precious little darlin' is mos' killed by means ob yo' bein' in a passion an' kickin' ob her--de sweet honey!--down de steps.""""How dared Agnes--a mulatto servant-girl,--talk so to her! But was the baby really dying? Would papa never come to tell her the truth about it? She wouldn't believe any thing so dreadful till she heard it from him: very likely Agnes was only trying to torment her, and make her as miserable as possible.""She had sunk, trembling, into a chair, feeling as if she should never want to eat again; but with that last thought, her hopes revived, hunger once more asserted its sway, and she ate her breakfast with a good deal of appetite and relish.But, when hunger was appeased, fears and anxieties renewed their assault: she grew half distracted with them, as hour after hour passed on, and no one came near her except another maid, to take away the breakfast-dishes and tidy the room.On her, Lulu turned her back, holding an open book in her hand, and pretending to be deeply absorbed in its contents, though not a word of the sense was she taking in; for, intense as was her desire to learn the baby's condition, she would not risk any more such stabs to her sensitiveness and pride as had been given by Agnes.This one came, did her work, and went away again in silence; but all the time she was in the room, Lulu felt that she was casting glances of disgust and disfavor at her. She could not breathe freely till the girl had left the room. On leaving the breakfast-room, Violet hastened back to the nursery; but the captain, calling Max and Grace into her boudoir, said, as he took the little girl on his knee, and motioned Max to sit by his side,--""Yes,"" he sighed: ""we cannot feel other than sad, while she is suffering and in danger. But she is a trifle better this morning, and we will hope the improvement may continue till she is entirely restored.""""She's such a darling!"" said Max; ""just the brightest, cutest baby that ever was seen! Mamma Vi has taught her to know your photograph; and, whenever she sees it, she says, 'Papa,' as plainly as I can. She calls me too, and Lu. Oh! I don't know how Lulu could""--He broke off, without finishing his sentence.""No,"" sighed the captain: ""I am quite sure she had no intention of harming her little sister, yet she is responsible for it as the consequence of indulging in a fit of rage; she feels that: and I hope the distress of mind she is now suffering because of the dreadful deed she has done in her passion, will be such a lesson to her, that she will learn to rule her own spirit in future.""""No. I have not told her yet; and I intend to keep her in ignorance of it for some days, as part of her deserved punishment. I do not want her to have any thing to divert her mind from the consideration of the great sin and danger of such indulgence of temper.""""I am very glad of that, papa,"" said Max feelingly; ""for though I do mean to be always a good son to you, if I ever should do any thing very, very bad, I'd not be afraid to confess it to you. I could stand punishment, you know; but I don't think I could bear to have you give up being fond of me.""A warm pressure of the lad's hand was the captain's only reply at first; but presently he said, ""I trust you will always be perfectly open with me, my dear boy. You don't think, do you, that you could have a better--more disinterested--earthly friend than your father?"""
"""Then make me your confidant,"" his father said, with a smile and look that spoke volumes of fatherly pride and affection; ""let me into all your secrets. Now that I am to be with you constantly, I shall take a deeper interest than ever in all that concerns you,--if that be possible,--in your studies, your sports, your thoughts and feelings. You may always be sure of my sympathy, and such help as I can give in every right and wise undertaking.""""I'll do that, papa!"" Max exclaimed with a sudden, glad, lighting-up of the face. ""Why, it'll be as good as having the brother I've often wished for!"" he added with a pleased laugh; ""better, in some ways, anyhow; for you'll be so much wiser than any boy, and keep me out of scrapes with your good advice.""Max had averted his face to hide his amusement at his little sister's question in regard to her father's friendship for herself, for the timid, sensitive little girl could hardly bear to be laughed at; but now he turned to his father again with the query,--""I don't know yet, Max,"" the captain answered; ""but I hope to be able to buy or build somewhere in this neighborhood, as I should be loath to take your mamma far away from her mother,--myself either, for that matter; and I presume you would all prefer to live near these kind friends?""""I am quite willing you should know that am able now to do without the pay, some land belonging to me in the Far West having so risen in value as to afford me sufficient means for the proper support of my family, and education of my children.""""Oh, that is good!"" cried Max, clapping his hands in delight. ""And if it is used up by the time I'm grown and educated, I hope I'll be able to take care of you, and provide for you as you do now for me.""""Thank you, my dear boy,"" the captain said with feeling; ""the day may come when you will be the stay and staff of my old age; but, however that may be, you may be sure that nothing can add more to your father's happiness than seeing you growing up to honorable and Christian manhood.""""I have not quite decided that question, and your wishes will have great weight with me in making the decision. I shall keep Lulu at home, and educate her myself,--act as her tutor, I mean,--and if my boy would like to become my pupil also""--""Yes,"" sighed Grace; ""how I do wish she had! Oh, I'm so sorry for her, that she doesn't know this about papa going to stay with us all the time! 'Sides, she's 'specting to be sent away somewhere; and how dreadfully she must feel! Papa's punishing her very hard, and very long; but of course he knows best, and he loves her.""""Yes, I'm sure he does,"" assented Max: ""so he won't give her any more punishment than he thinks she needs. It'll be a fine thing for her, and all the rest of us too, if this hard lesson teaches her never to get into a passion again."" She had been longing for his coming, moving restlessly about the room, feeling that she could not endure the suspense another moment; had at length thrown herself into a chair beside the window, and, as was her wont in times of over-wrought feeling, buried her face on her folded arms, laid on the window-sill.""I don't doubt it, daughter,"" he said; ""but a bitter lesson we all have to learn is, that we cannot undo the evil deeds we have done. Oh! let this dreadful occurrence be a warning to you to keep a tight rein upon your quick temper.""""I am sure that he has already done so, if you have asked with your heart, and for Jesus' sake. But we will ask him again for that, and to give you strength to fight against your evil nature as you never have fought, and to conquer.""""Certainly,"" he said, looking down at her very kindly, as he took her hand, and held it in a warm, affectionate clasp. ""Child, you have not lost your father's love. You are very dear to me, in spite of all your naughtiness."""
"""Oh! is that all?"" she gasped, the color coming back to her face, which had grown deadly pale. ""I thought it was the sheriff coming to put me in jail for hurting the baby. Will they do it, papa? Oh! you won't let them, will you?"" she cried entreatingly.""I could not protect you from the law,"" he said, in a moved tone; ""but I think there is no danger that it will interfere. You did not hurt your sister intentionally, and she is still living. You are very young too; and, doubtless, everybody will think your punishment should be left to me, your father.""He was silent for a moment; then he said, ""I know you are suffering very much from remorse; this is a bitter lesson to you; let it be a lasting one. I can relieve you of the fear of punishment from the law of the land; there is no danger of that now: but, if you do not lay this lesson to heart, there may come a time when that danger will be real; for there is no knowing what awful deed such an ungovernable temper as yours may lead you to commit.""Then it shall be conquered!"" she cried vehemently. ""I will fight it with all my might. And you will help me, papa, all you can, won't you, by watching me, and warning me when you see I'm beginning to get angry, and punishing me for the least little bit of a passion? But oh, I forget that you can't stay with me, or take me with you!"" she cried with a fresh burst of sobs and tears. ""Must you go back to your ship soon?""""Not very soon,"" he said; ""and I gladly promise to help you all I can in every way. I can do it with my prayers, even when not close beside you. But, my child, the struggle must be your own; all I can do will be of no avail unless you fight the battle yourself with all your strength.He carried her carefully, tenderly along, holding her close, as something precious that he began to fear might slip from his grasp. She had always been a strong, healthy child, and heretofore he had scarcely thought of sickness in connection with her; but now he was alarmed at her state.""No; very little,"" he answered, taking off her hat, and laying his cool hand on her forehead. ""Your head is very hot. I'll take off your coat, and lay you on the bed; and I want you to stay there for the rest of the day; go to sleep if you can.""""I cannot now, daughter,"" he said, smoothing her hair caressingly. ""I must go back to your mamma and the baby. But I will come in again to bid you good-night, and see that you are as comfortable as I can make you. Can you eat some supper?"""
"As Capt. Raymond passed through the hall on which Lulu's room opened, a little girl, dressed in deep mourning, rose from the broad, low sill of the front window, where she had been sitting waiting for the last few minutes, and came forward to meet him. She was a rather delicate-looking, sweet-faced child, with large dark eyes, full of intelligence.""Yes, sir: we--uncle Lester, aunt Elsie, little Ned, and I--have been away visiting at some distance, and did not hear of--of the baby's bad fall till we came home this afternoon. We are all so sorry, so very sorry! Aunt Elsie is with aunt Vi now; and I--oh! please, sir, may I go to Lulu?""""My dear little girl, I should like to say yes, for your sake,--and Lulu's too,--but for the present I think best not to allow her to see any one,"" he said in a kindly tone, and affectionately pressing the little hand she had put into his. ""But,"" seeing the disappointment in her face, ""I entirely approve of the intimacy, and hope it will be kept up; for I think it has been of benefit to Lulu.""""Thank you, sir,"" she returned, coloring with pleasure. ""But Lulu told me you had quite determined to send her away from here: I hope you will reconsider, and--let her stay,"" with a very coaxing look up into his face.""I will. I have left the navy, and expect to settle down in this neighborhood. In that case, you and Lulu will not be separated; for my strongest reason for the change was, that I might have her constantly with me, and train her up as I think she should be trained; as perhaps no one but her father can train her.""Evelyn's face had grown very bright. ""Oh, how delighted, how happy Lu will be when she hears it!"" she exclaimed; ""for, do you know, sir, she thinks there is nobody in the world to compare to her father?""A door had opened and closed: a step was coming down the hall, and a cheerful voice in his rear said, ""Captain, I have good news for you: there has been a great, a really wonderful change for the better in the last hour; the child will live, and I hope, I believe, entirely recover from the injuries caused by her fall.""Before the doctor's sentence was finished, the captain had turned, and caught his hand in a vice-like grasp: his eyes filled, his breast heaved with emotions too big for utterance; he shook the hand warmly, dropped it, and, without a word, hurried into the nursery.""Relieve her mind as speedily as possible with the good news of the certainty of the baby's recovery, and, if you choose, the other glad tidings you brought us yesterday,"" Arthur answered. ""The mental strain of the past two days has evidently been too much for her: she must have suffered greatly from grief, remorse, and terror. Relief from those will be the best medicine she could have, and probably work a speedy cure. Good-evening.""""Yes, baby is very much better; in fact, quite out of danger, the doctor thinks. And you? have you not slept?"" he asked, bending over her in tender solicitude; for she had fallen back on her pillow, and was sobbing as if her heart would break, weeping for joy as she had before wept with sorrow, remorse, and penitence.""I think--I believe you are going to be a very great blessing to me, my own darling,"" he answered in tones tremulous with emotion. ""I fear I was hard and cruel in what I said when I came to you that first time last night.""Then he covered her up with tender care, and left her, weary and exhausted with the mental suffering of the last two days, but with a heart singing for joy over his restored affection and the assurance of the baby's final recovery."
"""Papa,"" they said, coming hastily forward, ""may we go in to see Lulu now?"" Max adding, ""I was too angry with her at first to want to see her, but I've got over that now."" Grace: ""And mayn't she know now that we're going to keep you always at home?"" taking his hand in both of hers, and looking up coaxingly into his face.""As many as you like, my boy, when I have time to listen; though I don't promise to answer them all to your entire satisfaction,"" his father replied, as he passed on into the nursery, taking Grace with him.""Poor thing!"" Evelyn exclaimed, tears springing to her eyes. ""I should think it must have been almost enough to set her crazy. But how happy she will be when she hears that your father isn't going away again, and means to keep her at home with him.""""I've often envied boys that could live at home with their fathers; though,"" he added with a happy laugh, ""I've said to myself many a time, that mine was enough nicer than theirs to make up for having to do without him so much of the time; at least, I'd never have been willing to swap fathers with one of 'em. No, indeed!""""Very nice people, I think: the wife and mother is a very lovely woman, and the four children--a boy and three girls--are, I presume, neither better nor worse than my own four. The gentleman, who will teach you himself, along with the others, and have the particular care and oversight of you, is perhaps rather stern and severe with any one who ventures to disobey his orders; but I am quite certain, that, if you are good and obedient, he will be very kind and indulgent, possibly a trifle more indulgent than he ought to be.""""No, no, papa! I don't want to stay here! I don't want to see anybody here again, except Max and Gracie; because I'm so ashamed of--of what I've done. I couldn't look any of them in the face, for I know they must despise me.""""I trust it will not have that effect,"" he said, ""I hesitated a little about telling you to-night, lest it might interfere with your rest; but you seemed so unhappy about your future prospects, that I felt I must relieve you of the fear of being sent away among strangers.""""I don't know, yet,"" he said. ""I have not had time to look about in search of house or land; but I hope to be able to buy or build a house somewhere in this region, as near Ion as a pleasant location can be found.""""I think that plan might answer quite well,"" he said with a smile. ""I had no idea you were such a business woman. Probably that is what we will do, for I am as anxious to get to housekeeping as even you can be.""""Because my heavenly Father has prospered me, and given me money enough of my own (or, rather, lent it to me; for all we have belongs to him, and is only lent to us for a time) to provide all that is necessary for my family, and educate my children.""Well, I suppose you children would prefer to be left to yourselves for a while; so I will leave you. You may talk fifteen minutes together, but no longer; as it is your bedtime now, Gracie's at least.""""I hope my children have not been so thoroughly spoiled by living in the midst of wealth and luxury, that they could not content themselves with a moderately large house, and plain furniture?"" he said gravely.""And I,"" he responded, smiling affectionately upon them, ""would prefer such a home with my children about me, to earth's grandest palace without them. Millions of money could not buy one of my treasures!"""
"""'God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us,'"" quoted the captain. ""If God so loved me, while yet his enemy, a rebel against his rightful authority, I may well love my own children in spite of all their faults, even were those faults more and greater by far than they are.""""And the wonderful love of God for us should constrain us to hate and forsake all sin,"" said his father. ""The Bible bids us to 'be followers of God as dear children.' And oh, how we should hate sin when we remember that it crucified our Lord!""Their father entered heartily into their pleasure, and encouraged them to express themselves freely, until the clock, striking nine, reminded him that more than the allotted time for the interview had passed. Then he bade them say good-night, and go to their beds, promising that they should have other opportunities for saying all they wished on the subject.""Thank you, mother,"" he said: ""you are very kind to take any interest in Lulu after what has occurred. No, she is not quite well: the mental distress of the last two days has been very great, and has exhausted her physically. It could not, of course, be otherwise, unless she were quite heartless. She is full of remorse for her passion and its consequences, and my only consolation is the hope that this terrible lesson may prove a lasting one to her.""""I hope so, indeed,"" Elsie said, with emotion. ""Yes, she must have suffered greatly; for she is a warm-hearted, affectionate child, and would not, I am sure, have intentionally done her baby sister an injury.""""And so deeply ashamed is she, that she knows not how to face the family, or any one of them, and therefore entreats me to allow her to seclude herself in her own room till I can take her to the home I hope to make for my wife and children ere long.""""Poor child!"" sighed Elsie. ""Tell her, Levis, that she need not shrink from us as if we were not sinners, as well as herself. Shall I go in to-morrow morning, and have a talk with her before breakfast?""""It will be a great kindness,"" he said, flushing with pleasure, ""and make it much easier for her to show herself afterwards at the table. But I ought to ask if you are willing to see her there in her accustomed seat?""The captain grasped it warmly. ""Thank you, mother, for those kind and hopeful words,"" he said with emotion. ""For the last year or two, she has been alternately my joy and my despair; and I am resolved to leave no effort untried to rescue her from the dominion of her fierce temper.""The task would doubtless have been far easier could I have undertaken it years ago, in her early infancy. But I trust it is not yet too late to accomplish it, with the help and the wisdom I may have in answer to prayer.""No, I am sure it is by no means a hopeless undertaking, looking where you do for needed strength and wisdom; and I rejoice almost as much for Lulu's sake as for Vi's, that you have now come among us to stay. I will try to see her in the morning, and do what I can to make it easy for her to join the family circle again.""And now good-night. I must not keep you longer from the wife who grudges every moment that you are absent from her side,"" she concluded, with a smile as sweet and beautiful as that of her girlhood's days.While the captain and his mother-in-law held this little conversation in the upper hall, Zoe and Rosie were promenading the veranda, arm in arm. They had been talking of Violet and her baby, rejoicing together over its improved condition."
"""How dreadful the last two days have been to poor Vi!"" exclaimed Rosie, ""even in spite of the home-coming of her husband, which has always before this made her so happy. In fact, it has been a dreadful time to all of us; and nobody to blame except that bad-tempered Lulu.""It's quite trying to me, that I've had to send him away, and can't have him about any more till Lulu's gone. I'll be sorry to have Vi leave Ion, but rejoiced to be rid of Lulu. I wonder if the captain still intends to send her away? I sincerely hope so, for Vi's sake. Poor little Elsie may be killed outright the next time Lulu has an opportunity to vent her spite upon her.""""O Rosie! how can you talk so?"" exclaimed Zoe. ""haven't you heard that Lulu says she thought it was your dog she was kicking at? and that she has been really sick with distress about the baby? As to sending her away to be trained and taught by strangers--her father has no idea of doing it: in fact,--so Vi told Ned,--the conviction that Lulu needed his constant oversight and control had a great deal to do in leading him to resign from the service and come home to live.""""I do wish papa would come for me. I can't bear to go down alone to breakfast,"" Lulu was saying to herself the next morning, when a light step in the hall without caught her ear: then there was a tap at the door; and, opening it, she found the lady of the house standing on the threshold.""Good-morning, grandma Elsie,"" murmured Lulu, blushing deeply, and casting down her eyes: ""you are very kind to come to see me, and to kiss me too, when I have been so bad. Please take a chair,"" she added, drawing one forward.""Thank you, dear; but I would rather sit on the sofa yonder, with you by my side,"" Elsie said, taking Lulu's hand, and leading her to it, then, when they had seated themselves, putting the other arm about the child's waist, and drawing her close to her side. ""I feel that I have been neglecting you,"" she went on; ""but my thoughts have been much taken up with other things, and""--""O grandma Elsie!"" cried Lulu, bursting into tears. ""I didn't deserve that you should show me the least kindness, or think of me at all except as a very bad, disagreeable girl. I should think you'd want to turn me out of your house, and say I should never come into it again.""""No, dear child, I have no such feeling toward you: if I had, should I not be very much like that wicked servant to whom his lord had forgiven a debt of ten thousand talents, yet who refused to have compassion on his fellow-servant who owed him a hundred pence? I should, indeed; for my sins against God have been far greater, and more heinous, than yours against me or mine.""""But papa said he must punish me all the same, because it was being in a passion that made me do it. Grandma Elsie, if you had such a dreadful temper as mine, wouldn't you be discouraged about ever conquering it?""""No, my child, not while I could find such words as these in the Bible: 'O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself: but in Me is thine help.' 'Thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins.' 'He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.' 'God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.'"""
"""'The God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.' 'And they that stumbled are girded with strength.' You cannot doubt that you are included in the invitation, for it is, 'Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.' And the time to come is now: 'Now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.'""The breakfast-bell rang at that moment; and grandma Elsie, rising, took Lulu's hand, saying, ""Come, my dear, you need not shrink from joining us at the table: no one will be disposed to treat you unkindly.""As she spoke, the door opened, and Capt. Raymond and Violet came in. They exchanged morning greetings with their mother; while Lulu, with eyes cast down, and cheeks aflame, half shrank behind her, ashamed and afraid to meet Violet's gaze.The worst was over to Lulu in having seen Violet, yet it was quite an ordeal to her to face the rest of the large family; but each one spoke pleasantly to her. Rosie alone bestowed so much an unkind look upon her, and that was wasted; for Lulu, expecting it from that quarter more than any other, constantly averted her gaze from Rosie, keeping her eyes down, or turned in another direction.""Yes, so Miss Elliott told me yesterday,"" replied Arthur. ""She was slightly indisposed, and sent for me, and, while telling of her ailments, remarked that she was very lonely since her sister Margaret had married and gone, leaving her sole occupant--not taking servants into account--of that large house, with its extensive grounds. So she had at last decided, she said, to comply with her sister's urgent request to sell the place, and take up her abode with them.""She had thought of advertising, and asked my advice about it. Of course, I thought at once of you and Vi, captain, told her I knew of a gentleman who might like to become a purchaser, and that I would promise her a call from him to-day to look at the place. Will you redeem my promise?""""I hardly like to leave my baby yet,"" she answered dubiously. ""But if you should feel entirely satisfied with the house, the grounds, and the price asked for them, you could not please me better than by making the purchase.""""And with carriages and horses, bicycles, tricycles, and telephones, we may feel ourselves very near neighbors indeed,"" remarked Edward. ""When the weather is too inclement for mamma or Vi to venture out, they can talk together by the hour through the telephone, if they wish.""Both ardently wished their father would propose taking them along; he did not: but when Dr. Conly said, with a kindly glance at Grace, ""There will be room in my carriage for a little friend of mine, if papa is willing to let her go with us,"" he at once said,--""The estate was formerly very large,"" Arthur went on,--""some thousands of acres,--and the family was a very wealthy one; but, like many others, they lost heavily by the war, and were compelled to part with one portion of the estate after another, till little more than the homestead was left; and now it seems that it, too, must go.""""I think Miss Elliott does not feel compelled to part with it, and would still live on there, if it were not for the loneliness of the situation, and a natural desire to be with her sister, the only remaining member of their once large family, besides herself.""""The place is a good deal run down,"" remarked Arthur. ""They have not had the means to keep it up, I suppose; but if it comes into your hands, captain, you can soon set matters right in regard to that; and I, for one, shall greatly enjoy seeing the improvement.""""Papa, I'd just love to have this for our home!"" cried Gracie, flushing with pleasure as she glanced here and there, and then up into his face with an eager, questioning look, ""Won't you buy it, papa?"" coaxingly.They had reached the house, and were presently ushered into the presence of its owner. She was desirous to sell, the captain to buy,--willing also to give not only a fair, but a liberal, price; so it took but a short time for them to come to an agreement."
"He bought the land, house, furniture, every thing just as it stood; was promised possession in two weeks, and accorded the privilege of at once beginning any repairs or alterations he might deem desirable.The furniture had evidently been very handsome in its day, and would do quite well, he thought, to begin with: much of it might, with re-upholstering and varnishing, please Violet as well as any that could be bought elsewhere. He was eager to bring her to look at it, the house and the grounds.These last delighted both himself and Grace, although lawn and gardens were far from being as trim and neat as those of Ion and Fairview: there was an air of neglect about the whole place, but that could soon be remedied.The bit of woodland was beautiful; and through it, and across lawn and gardens, ran a little stream of clear, sparkling water,--a pretty feature in the landscape, without being deep enough to be dangerous to the little ones.He would reply only by a kind smile, or a word or two of assent. She did not understand all the talk in the library after they had finished their round, and when they left was still in some doubt as to her father's intentions.""No, indeed!"" he replied, bending down to kiss her cheek. ""If I had another new little girl given me, I should want to hold fast to my little Gracie too; and you shall keep all your dollies as long as you please.""Their talk was principally of the new home in prospect. Lulu had only driven past Woodburn several times; but Max had been taken there once by Dr. Conly, with whom he was almost as great a favorite as his sister Grace, and had seen not only the grounds, but one or two rooms of the mansion.""I do, though: I love you dearly, and should have gone to your room yesterday if your papa had not refused to allow it,"" responded Evelyn, repeating her caress. ""Come in and rest, both of you: aunt Elsie told me to ask you.""""No,--come to think of it,--I don't believe he did,"" said Max. ""Besides, it must be pretty near school-time; so if you are ready, Eva, and want to walk, we'll start back directly, and be glad to take you with us.""""Of course not: you couldn't be so cruel toward any baby, but especially your own sweet little sister,"" was the gentle, sweet-toned reply. ""I am rejoiced, especially for you, my dears, and for your mamma, that your father is going to settle down here; for I know it will add greatly to your happiness, he is such a good husband and father, and you will so enjoy having a home of your own.""""Oh, how nice that would be!"" she exclaimed. ""I've been there with aunt Elsie, and it's just a lovely place! It has a rather neglected look now; but it wouldn't take long to remedy that, and then it would be quite as handsome as Ion or Fairview, or any other place about here. Aren't you happy, Lu?""Evelyn sighed again. ""The only part I regret,"" she remarked, ""is that we have to give up being together in our studies,--you and I. Unless,"" she added the next moment, as if struck by a sudden thought, ""your father would take me as a pupil too. But I wouldn't dare to ask it.""""Yes; and he had such a kind, fatherly manner toward me, that I fell in love with him at once. I believe I'd be glad to have him adopt me if he was badly in want of another daughter about my age,"" she added, with a merry look and smile.""I believe he'd be the gainer if he could swap me off for you,"" said Lulu, catching her friend's tone; ""but I'm very happy in feeling quite sure he would rather have me, bad as I am, just because I am his own."""
"Lulu's thoughts were so full of other things, she found great difficulty in fixing them upon her lessons. But saying to herself that it would be much too bad to fail in her first recitations to her father, she exerted her strong will to the utmost, and succeeded. She was quite ready for him when, at length, he came in.""I prefer that you should not be, except when I am present,"" he returned gravely. ""I want to keep you with me as much as possible; and would rather have you alone, or with Evelyn, Max, and Gracie only, when I am not with you.""When the recitations were finished, ""Papa,"" she said, with an affectionate, admiring look up into his face, ""I think you are a _very_ nice teacher: you make every thing so clear and plain, and so interesting. I'm so glad you're the gentleman who is to have charge of me,"" she added with a happy laugh.""So am I,"" he said, caressing her. ""I am very glad, very thankful, to be able to take charge of all my own children; and whatever I may lack in experience and ability as a teacher, I hope to make up in the deep interest I shall always feel in the welfare and progress of my pupils.""She then told him of Evelyn's wish, concluding With, ""Won't you, dear papa? I'd like it so much, and Eva is such a good girl you wouldn't have a bit of trouble managing her. She's just as different from me as possible.""""Quite a recommendation; and if I were as sure of proving a competent teacher, I should not hesitate to grant your request. But it is a new business to me, and perhaps it would not be wise for me to undertake the tuition of more than my own three at present. However,"" he added, seeing her look of disappointment, ""I will take the matter into consideration.""""Papa, I spoiled one of those valuable books of engravings belonging to grandpa Dinsmore; no, I didn't exactly spoil it myself, but I took it out on the veranda without leave, and carelessly left it where Rosie's dog could get at it; and he scratched and gnawed and tore it, till it is almost ruined.""""I shall replace it at once,"" he said. ""I am sorry you were so careless, and particularly that you took the book out there without permission; but that was not half so bad as flying into a passion, even if you hurt nothing or no one but yourself.""""Papa, I'm ever so sorry you'll have to pay so much money to replace that book,"" she said. ""But--you often give me some pocket-money, and--won't you please keep all you would give me till it counts up enough to pay for the book?""""It is a right feeling, a feeling that pleases me, which prompts you to make that request,"" he said in a kind tone, and pressing his lips to her cheek; ""and probably another time I may let you pay for such a piece of carelessness, but you need not in this instance. I feel rich enough to spare the money quite easily for that and an increase in my children's weekly allowance. What is yours now?""He laughed at that. ""Now,"" he said, ""you shall have a dollar every week, unless I should have to withdraw it on account of some sort of bad behavior on your part. Max is to have the same; Gracie half a dollar till she is a little older: and you are all to keep an account of your spendings.""""One of these is for you: the others are for your brother and sister,"" he said. ""See, there is a blank space for every day in the week; and, Whenever you lay out any money, you must write down in the proper place what it was that you bought, and how much it cost.""""Once in a while: probably, whenever I hand you your allowance, I shall look over your account for the week that is just past, and tell you what I think of the way you have laid out your money, in order to help you to learn to spend it judiciously.""""This is for you, this for Grace,"" the captain answered, bestowing them as he spoke, then went on to repeat substantially what he had just been saying to Lulu, and to replenish their purses as he had hers."
"Evelyn looked on, well pleased. ""Now your allowance is just the same as mine, and I am so glad,"" she said to Lulu. ""I have never kept an account; but I think it must be a good plan, and I mean to after this.""""People have different ideas about that,"" was the reply. ""In Old-Testament times, the rule was one-tenth of all; and I think most people should not give less now: many are able to give a great deal more. I hope each of you will be glad to give as much as that.""He opened Lulu's Bible, lying on the table, and read aloud, ""'He who soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly; and he who soweth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity; for God loveth a cheerful giver.'""""I'll give a tenth of all,"" said Lulu. ""I mean to buy a little purse on purpose to keep my tenth in, and I'll put two of these dimes in it. That will be the tenth of the two dollars you've given me, won't it, papa?""There was a simultaneous and joyful assent from his own three: then Evelyn said, ""Thank you, sir. I should like it extremely, if I can get permission. Aunt Elsie expects me home to dinner; but I will go now to the telephone, and ask if I may stay and accept your invitation.""Evelyn had no difficulty in gaining permission to stay at Ion for the rest of the day, or go anywhere Capt. Raymond might propose to take her; and he found but little difficulty in persuading Violet to accompany him in a drive that would take her from her baby for an hour or two, the little one being so much better that she did not fear to leave it in charge of her mother and the nurse, thinking it might die before her return.There was a simultaneous exclamation of surprise as they saw, not the Ion family carriage, but a new and very handsome one, with a pair of fine match-horses, which none of them had ever seen before, drawn up at the foot of the veranda-steps, while, a few feet beyond, a servant held the bridle of a beautiful, spirited pony, whose long mane, gracefully arched neck, and glossy coat, struck them all with admiration.Max wheeled about, dashed down the avenue at a rapid gallop, turned, and came back at an easy canter; his father and sisters, Violet also, watching him in proud delight, he was so handsome, and sat his pony so well.""Ah! that will do,"" his father said when the lad was within easy hearing-distance: ""these fellows,"" glancing at the horses attached to the carriage, ""are getting too restless to stand any longer; so you may finish your exhibition at another time. I have seen enough to feel that you are quite equal to the management of your pony.""""I 'spect I know where we're going,"" remarked Grace gleefully, and with an arch smile up into her father's face, as she noticed the direction they were taking on turning out of the avenue into the high-road.""I don't think they have,"" he said, ""except such parts of them as dry twigs and fallen branches, that could be picked up from the ground, or now and then a tree that it was thought best to cut down, or that fell of itself. But you know, there is a pretty little brook running across the estate, and in Scotland such a stream is called a burn; so, having a wood and a burn, Woodburn is a very appropriate name.""""Even papa doesn't know nearly every thing, little daughter,"" he said, stroking and patting the small hand she had laid on his knee, ""so it would be quite out of place for him to laugh at you for asking a sensible question. We should never be ashamed to ask for information that we need. It is much wiser than to remain in ignorance for fear of being laughed at.""Besides these, a tiny apartment in a tower, communicating with Lulu's bedroom, was given to her. The sitting-room opened into the hall also, so that it was not necessary to pass through one bedroom to reach the other.""Then, if you please, papa, I'll take those over Lu's, and thank you very much. But as you have already given me several things that my sisters haven't got,--a gun, a watch, and that splendid pony,--I think it would be quite fair that they should have better and prettier furniture in their rooms than I in mine."""
"""That makes no difference, Max,"" his father answered with a pleased laugh. ""I should hardly want the girls to have guns, but watches and ponies they shall have by the time they are as old as you are now.""Though, in common with all the rest, deeply interested in the new home, Max was not sorry when his father and Violet decided that it was time to return to Ion; for he was eager to show his pony to grandma Elsie, Zoe, and Rosie, who had not yet seen it.He reached Ion some minutes in advance of the carriage, found nearly all of the family who had remained at home on the veranda, and greatly enjoyed their exclamations of surprise and admiration at sight of his steed.Those who were in it were a gay and happy party, who, all the way as they came, had been discussing plans for making the new home more convenient, comfortable, and beautiful, and for the life they were to live in it.""In both morals and art?"" said the captain, looking smilingly at her. ""I should think so, judging from what my wife is; and surely, it is reasonable to expect a child to be, to some extent, a reflection of its surroundings; refined or vulgar, according to the style of faces--living or pictured--it is constantly gazing upon, etc. But, however that may be, we will try to keep upon the safe side, furnishing only what must have a good influence, so far as it has any at all.""""Lulu looks as if she did not know how to wait so long,"" Violet said, smiling kindly on the little girl. ""Can't you take her and Max and Gracie to-morrow, and again on Monday? Surely, they can select some things for their own rooms, with you to help them.""""No. I want your taste as well as my own and theirs, and Lulu must learn to wait: it is a lesson she needs,"" he added, looking down at her with grave kindliness, and pressing affectionately the hand she had slipped into his.""Now, captain, if my taste and judgment were considered equal to Vi's, and Lulu might be spared that lesson,"" remarked Zoe laughingly, ""I'd offer to go in her place,--Vi's, I mean. I think it would be great fun to help choose pictures, carpets, and furniture.""""Thank you, Zoe; that is a kind offer,"" said Violet: ""and if mamma thinks it an enjoyable errand, and will consent to supplement your taste and judgment with hers, they will be a good deal more than equal to mine,"" she concluded, with a smiling glance at her mother.""I am quite of Zoe's opinion as to the pleasantness of the object of the expedition, Vi,"" Elsie said, ""and quite at the service of the captain and yourself, to go, or to take your place in watching over baby while you go; and I think you will find it necessary to spend more than one or two days in the work of selecting what you will want for the furnishing of your home.""""I dare say you are right about that, mother,"" said the captain; ""and as it seems to be the desire of all parties that the work should be begun to-morrow, I think I will take the children and as many of you ladies as may like to accompany us.""""Papa, mayn't we drive to the city in the new carriage?"" pleaded Lulu. ""I'd like it ever so much better than going in the cars; and then we can drive from one store to another, without having to take the street-cars or a hack.""""He has always been used to kind treatment, I was told, and has nothing vicious in his disposition,"" the captain continued, puffing at his cigar, and pacing the veranda with measured tread, Max keeping close at his side: ""so I think he will always give you satisfaction, if you are gentle and kind, never ill-treating him in any way.""Then, with an arch look up into his father's face,--a full moon making it light enough for each to see the other's countenance quite distinctly,--""Papa, you are very generous to me, but you never offer me a cigar.""""Yes, sir: I'll obey; and, in fact, I have no desire to smoke again: it was just one cigar I tried; and it made me so deathly sick, that I've never wanted another. I wouldn't have done it, papa, if you had ever forbidden me; but--but you had never said any thing to me on the subject, and I'd seen""--Max hesitated, and left his sentence unfinished.""Well, my son, I can hardly blame you for that; but there are some things a man may do with impunity, that a boy may not. Tobacco is said to be far more injurious to one who has not attained his growth, than to an adult. But it is not seldom injurious to the latter also: some seem to use it with no bad effect, but it has wrought horrible suffering for many. I am sorry I ever formed the habit, and I would save you from the same regret, or something worse: indeed, so anxious am I to do so, that I would much rather hand you a thousand dollars than a cigar, if I thought you would smoke it."""
"""Oh, no, papa! don't do it for my sake,"" said Max. ""Cousin Arthur told me that when a man had smoked for years, it cost him a good deal of suffering to give it up; and I couldn't bear to see you suffer so. I'll refrain all the same, without your stopping.""""I don't doubt that you would, my dear boy; and I fully appreciate the affection for me that prompts you to talk in that way,"" the captain said: ""but I have set a bad example quite long enough, not to my own son alone, but to other people's; and whatever I may have to endure in breaking off from the bad habit, will be no more than I deserve for contracting it. I should be very sorry, Max, to have you feel that you have a coward for a father,--a man who would shrink from the course he felt to be right, rather than endure pain, mental or physical.""The corners of the captain's lips twitched; but his tones were grave enough as he said, ""I don't want you to do any fighting on my account, Max; and if anybody slanders me, I shall try to live it down.""There is another thing I want to talk to you about,"" he went on presently, ""and that is the danger of tampering with intoxicating drinks. The only safe plan is to let them entirely alone. I am thankful to be able to say that I have not set you a bad example in that direction. My good mother taught me to 'touch not, taste not, handle not;' and I have never taken so much as a glass of wine; though there have been times, my boy, when it required some moral courage to stand out against the persuasions, and especially the ridicule, of my companions.""""I suppose it would add greatly to your enjoyment to have her with you,"" he said reflectively. ""Yes, you may ask her; or I will do so, early in the morning, through the telephone, if the weather is such that we can go.""She hastened to array herself in suitable attire for her trip to the city,--having consulted grandma Elsie on the subject the night before,--and had just finished when she heard her father's step in the hall.""I hope it will,"" he said; then, as she looked up in surprise, ""The apostle says, 'When I am weak, then am I strong.' When we feel our own weakness, and look to God for help, then we are strong with a strength far greater than our own; but when we grow self-confident, and trust in our own strength, we are very apt to find it but weakness.""I intend that your taste shall be consulted, my child,"" he said; ""but I cannot promise that you shall have, in every case, exactly what you most prefer. You might select carpets, curtains, and upholstery of material and colors that would wear poorly, or fade very soon. Therefore we must take grandma Elsie into our counsels, and get her help in deciding what to take; for I am sure you would like neither to have your rooms disfigured with faded, worn-out furnishings, or to put your father to the expense of refurnishing for you very soon.""""Papa,"" she said, looking up at him with eyes shining with filial love, ""how kind you were to reason with me in that nice way, instead of saying sternly, as you might have done, 'Now, Lulu, if you are naughty about the choice of things for furnishing your rooms, you sha'n't have any thing pretty for them, and when we get home I'll punish you severely!'""Her father, on his part, was extremely indulgent toward all three of his children, in every case in which he felt that it was right and wise to be so, sparing no reasonable expense to gratify their tastes and wishes. But in several matters they yielded readily to his or grandma Elsie's better judgment; indeed, always, when asked to do so, seeming, too, well satisfied with the final decision.They returned home, a very happy set of children, except, in Lulu's case, when memory recalled the passionate outburst of the early part of the week with its dire consequences: that remembrance would be a sore spot in her heart, and a bitter humiliation, for many a day, probably for the rest of her life.""Yes, indeed!"" they both replied. ""Oh, we have ever so many beautiful things! Papa and grandma Elsie helped us to choose them; so, of course, they are all just right,"" added Lulu, looking gratefully from one to the other.""Never mind: you are sure to be appreciated in one quarter,"" said Edward, coming up at that moment, catching her round the waist, and bestowing a hearty kiss upon each cheek. ""I have been lost without my wife all day.""""Would you advise me to do likewise, and for the same reason, lady mine?"" he asked, drawing her caressingly aside from the little group now busily occupied in telling and hearing about the day's purchases."
"""No, sir,"" she said, tossing back her curls, and looking up into his face with a bewitchingly saucy smile: ""you'd better not attempt it, lest there should be mutiny in the camp. When you go, I go too.""""Turn about, fair play,"" he said, knitting his brows. ""I claim the privilege of being quite as independent as you are--when you can't plead delegated authority from the doctor;"" and, drawing her hand within his arm, he led her away to their private apartments.She joined the group on the veranda, her husband receiving her with a glad smile and tender caress, and standing by his side, her hand on his shoulder, his arm half supporting her slight, girlish form, listened with lively interest to the story his children were telling so eagerly, of papa's kindness and generosity to them, and the many lovely things bought to make beautiful and attractive the rooms in the new home that were to be especially theirs.He let them talk without restraint for some moments, then said pleasantly, ""Now, my dears, it is time for you to go and make yourselves neat for the tea-table. Any thing more you think of that would be likely to interest Rosie and Walter, you can tell them afterwards.""When the excitement of telling about their purchases, and all the day's experiences, was over, the children found themselves very weary,--the two little girls at least: Max wouldn't acknowledge that he was at all fatigued, but was quite willing to comply with his father's suggestion that it would be wise for him, as well as for his sisters, to go early to bed.""Because--because--I--I'm afraid people have heard about--about how bad I was the other day; and--so I--I can't bear to go where I'll--be seen by strangers. No, I mean by folks out of the house that know who I am, and what happened the other day.""""'Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is,' the Bible says; so I cannot allow you to absent yourself from the services of the sanctuary when you are able to attend.""I mean to, papa; I'd be ashamed to be naughty after all you have done for me, and given me to-day: and I mean to be pleasant about going to church to-morrow; though it'll be ever so hard, and I'm sure you wouldn't want to go if you were me.""""No, daughter, it is sometimes very far from being easy and pleasant for me to do what I feel to be my duty; for instance, when it is to inflict pain upon you, or another of my dear children, or deny you some indulgence that you crave. I should like to grant your request of to-night, if I could feel that it would be right; but I cannot, and therefore must deny it.""She ventured upon no further entreaty, knowing it would be altogether useless, and quite as much from love to her father, and a real desire to please him, as from fear of punishment, behaved herself as well as possible.He took her hand, and led her to the nursery. The baby was awake, sitting in its nurse's lap, and looking bright, but so much thinner and paler than before her fall, that tears sprang to Lulu's eyes, and she could scarce refrain from sobbing aloud.""Lu, Lu!"" the little one repeated in her sweet baby voice; and Lulu hugged her close, kissing her again and again, and saying softly, ""You dear, sweet darling; sister loves you, indeed, indeed she does!""The captain looked on, his heart swelling with joy and thankfulness over the evident mutual affection of the two; for there had been a time when he feared Lulu would never love the child of her step-mother as she did Max and Grace.After that they were told lessons must be taken up again: and Lulu passed most of her time in her own room, generally engaged in preparing her tasks for her father to hear in the evening; for he was now so busy with the improvements being carried forward at Woodburn, that very often he could not attend to her recitations till after tea.She continued to think him the kindest and most interesting teacher she had ever had; while he found, to his surprise, that he had a liking for the occupation, aside from his fatherly interest in his pupil: and Max and Grace, listening to Lulu's report, grew anxious for the time when they could share her privileges.But their waiting-time would not be very long. As soon as Miss Elliott's stipulated two weeks had expired, she would leave Woodburn, and they would take possession immediately. Their father and his young wife were quite as eager as they to begin the new order of things. The moving to Woodburn was not a formidable affair, there being little to carry from Ion besides the personal belongings of parents and children; and, indeed, nearly every thing, even of that kind, had been sent over beforehand.Miss Elliott went one morning; and the Raymonds drove over scarcely an hour later, to find the greater part of the house in perfect order, a full staff of competent servants, and an excellent dinner in course of preparation.They had all supposed the work of renovation and improvement was not to be begun till after the departure of Miss Elliott; but they found it not only begun, but finished; the new papers they had chosen were already on the walls, the carpets down, the curtains up, mirrors and pictures hung, and furniture in place.Violet was greatly pleased; the children were wild with delight; every thing was so dainty and fresh, there was such an air of elegance and refinement about the appointments of each room, that all were charmed with the effect.Capt. Raymond went to the library to busy himself with some correspondence first, afterwards with books and papers. He had one of these last in his hand, a pile of them on the table before him, when, from the open doorway into the hall, Lulu's voice asked,--"
"""No, hardly,"" he returned, joining in her mirth: ""so much sleep in the daytime would be apt to interfere with your night's rest. I want you all to have sufficient sleep in the twenty-four hours to keep you in health of body and mind, but should be very sorry to have you become sluggards,--so fond of your beds as to waste time in drowsing there, that should be spent in the exercise and training of body or mind. What have you been doing besides napping?""""That is to be a part of your education,"" he said. ""I want my daughters to become thorough housekeepers, conversant with all the details of every branch of the business. Gracie is not old enough or strong enough to begin that part of her training yet, but you are; so you must take care of your rooms yourself, except when something more than sweeping, dusting, and bed-making is needed.""""I'd like well enough to do it sometimes, papa,"" she said, looking a little crestfallen; ""but I don't like to be tied down to doing it every day, because some days I shall want to be busy at something else; and besides, it is so much like being a servant.""""My little girl, that isn't a right kind of pride; honest labor is no disgrace; and 'Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work,' is as much a command of God as the 'In it (the sabbath) thou shalt not do any work.'""""But, papa, who is to teach me how to take care of my rooms? Not mamma Vi, I suppose? I never saw her do any such work; and--would you want me taught by one of the servants?"" she queried, blushing vividly.""No,"" he said: ""I have a better plan than that. I have engaged Christine to be housekeeper here, and she will instruct you in all housewifely arts. She is a lady in education and manners, and you need feel it no degradation to be instructed by her.""""Oh, that will be nice! and I'll try to learn to do the work well, and to like it, too, to please you, my own, dear papa,"" she said, looking up lovingly into his face, her own growing very bright again.""You asked just now,"" he went on, ""if your mamma Vi would teach you these things. When I asked her to become my wife, I promised that she should have no care or responsibility in the matter of training and looking after the welfare of the three children I then had; because her mother objected, that she was too young for such a burden: so now that I can live at home with my children, and have no business that need interfere, I shall do my best to be father and mother both to them.""""How nice, papa!"" she exclaimed joyfully. ""Oh, I do think we ought to be the happiest children in the world, with such a dear, kind father, and such a lovely home! But""--her face clouded, and she sighed deeply.""I fully intend to do all in my power to that end,"" he said in a tender tone; ""but, my beloved child, the hardest part of the battle must inevitably be your own. You must watch and pray against that, your besetting sin, never allowing yourself to be a moment off your guard.""""To that end, I have just been examining some of the reading-matter which has been provided for them in my absence; and, so far as I have made myself acquainted with it, I decidedly approve it, as I expected I should; having all confidence in those who chose it for you,--grandpa Dinsmore and grandma Elsie.""Oh, yes, indeed, papa! we are all very fond of it, and find a great deal of useful information in it. I wouldn't be without it for a great deal, nor Max wouldn't either; and Gracie likes the part for the little folks ever so much.""""Oh! is there something more to see?"" exclaimed Grace, running to her father, and putting her hand in his. ""Oh, it's ever so nice to have such a beautiful home, and so many beautiful new things to look at!"""
"The room he had selected for the purpose was in a wing attached to the main building at the end farthest removed from Violet's apartments; for he did not want her to be disturbed by any noise the children might make, or them to feel constrained to keep very quiet when not engaged in study or recitation. There was a simultaneous burst of delight from the three, as he threw open the door, and ushered them in. Every thing had been done to render that as attractive as any other part of the mansion: the windows reached almost from floor to ceiling, some opening on to the veranda, one looking directly out upon lawn and flower-garden, with a glimpse of the wood and the brook beyond; a handsome rug covered the centre of the stained and polished floor. In an open fireplace a bright wood fire was blazing, an easy-chair on each side of it; and a sofa on the farther side of the room seemed to invite to repose: but the handsome writing-table, and three pretty rosewood desks, were suggestive of work to be done ere the occupants of the room might feel entitled to rest. The walls were tinted a delicate gray, an excellent background for the pictures that adorned them here and there: most of these were marine views,--that over the fireplace, a very large and fine one, of a storm at sea.On the mantel-shelf were heaped sea-mosses, shells, and coral; but the tiles below it represented Scripture scenes. Blinds and curtains shaded the windows; and the broad, low sills were cushioned, making pleasant places to sit in.""They are exactly alike,"" he said. ""I thought of having yours made a trifle lower than the others, but concluded to give you a foot-rest instead, as you will soon grow tall enough to want it the height it now is. Max and Lulu, shall we give your little sister the first choice, as she is the youngest?""""You may have your choice--we will put it to vote--whether we will begin to-morrow morning, or not till Monday,"" replied their father; ""to-morrow, you will remember, is Thursday: we will begin school regularly at nine o'clock each morning; and it is to last four hours, not including five or ten minutes at the end of every hour for rest.""""Wait till you are sure,"" said his father: ""there's to be no idling, no half attention to study, in those hours; you are to give your whole minds to your lessons, and I shall be very strict in exacting perfect recitations.""""No, not at all. I shall very much prefer to have you give the sense in your own words: then I shall know that you understand the meaning of the text, and are not repeating sounds merely like a parrot; that you have not been going over the words without trying to take in the ideas they are meant to express.""""If you fail to do so, after giving your best efforts to the task, your teacher will always be ready to explain to the best of his ability,"" was the smiling rejoinder. ""But remember, all of you, that I intend you to use your own brains with as little assistance from other people's as possible. Mind as well as body grows strong by exercise.""""Yes, it was here,"" he said, as he ushered them in, ""but I have had it altered and fitted up expressly for my children's use: you see, it is a little away from the house, so that the noise of saws and hammers will not be likely to prove an annoyance to your mamma and visitors. See, this is a workroom furnished with fret and scroll saws, and every sort of tool that I know of which would be likely to prove useful to you, Max and Lulu.""He opened an inner door as he spoke, and showed a playroom as completely fitted up for its intended use as the room they were in. It was about the same size as the workroom, the two occupying the whole of the small building.A pretty carpet covered the floor, a few pictures hung on the delicately tinted walls; there were chairs and a sofa of suitable size for the comfort of the intended occupants, and smaller ones on which Gracie's numerous dolls were seated; a cupboard with glass doors showed sets of toy china dishes, and all the accessories for dinner and tea table; there were also a bureau, wash-stand, and table corresponding in size with the rest of the furniture; and the captain, pulling open the drawers of the first named, showed them well stocked with material of various kinds, suitable for making into new garments for the dolls, and with all the necessary implements,--needles, thread, thimbles, scissors, etc.Her father pointed to a register. ""There is a cellar underneath, and a furnace in it,"" he said. ""I thought that the safest way to heat these rooms for the use of very little people. I do not want to expose you to any danger of setting yourselves on fire.""Christine had come to assume her duties as housekeeper at Woodburn; Alma was to make her home there while still continuing to sew for the families at Ion and Fairview--an arrangement which suited the sisters admirably.""Lots ob folks comin' to-night, honey, and grand doin's gwine on in de kitchen and de dinin'-room. Dere's a long table sot out in de bigges' dinin'-room, and heaps and heaps ob splendiferous china dishes, wid fruits and flowahs painted onto 'em, and silverware bright as de sun, and glass dishes dat sparkle like Miss Elsie's di'mon's; and in de kitchen dey's cookin' turkeys and chickens, and wild game ob warious kinds, and oysters in warious styles; 'sides all de pastry and cakes and fruits and ices, and--oh, I cayn't begin to tell yo' all de good things the captain has perwided! dere wasn't never nuffin' grander at Ion or Wiamede or de Oaks, or any ob de grand places belongin' to our fam'lies."""
"""So she does,"" said Lulu, coming hurrying in from her room, arrayed in her pretty cashmere, and with a wide, rich sash-ribbon in her hand. ""Now, Agnes, if you will please tie my sash, I'll be 'done finished' too.""Their father opened the door, and stepped in just in time to hear her words, and, glancing smilingly from one to the other, said, ""To papa's eyes, both his dear little girls look sweet and lovable. Agnes, their appearance does you credit. Now, my darlings, we will go down to tea, for there is the bell.""""And I wish to keep you so,"" he said pleasantly; ""but you may rest assured that I shall not deny you any enjoyment I think it safe to grant you. Now sit down and be quiet till the blessing has been asked,""--for they had reached the dining-room, and found Violet and Max there waiting for them.Lulu had overheard a good deal of the glowing account of the coming feast to which Agnes had treated Grace, and, when at liberty to speak again, asked, in a rather discontented tone, if she and Max were not to have any share in the good supper being prepared for the expected guests.""It's good enough for a king, sir,"" returned the lad heartily, glancing over the table as he spoke,--""the nicest of bread and butter, plenty of rich milk and cream, canned peaches and plums, and splendid gingerbread. Why, Lu, what more could you ask?""There were cordial, affectionate greetings for each of the others also: then, when outdoor garments had been laid aside, all were conducted over the house, to be shown the improvements already made, and told of those still in contemplation.It was a great delight to Lulu and Grace to exhibit their pretty rooms to Evelyn and Rosie, and hear their expressions of surprise and admiration; and the pleasure was repeated several times, as the little folks from the Laurels, the Oaks, and the Pines arrived, and in succession went the same round.""I am pleased with all I have seen, Vi; but this room is especially charming to me,"" grandma Elsie said, when Violet led her a second time into the nursery, the rest of the Ion party having passed on down to the parlors. ""Baby should be a merry, happy child, if pleasant, cheerful surroundings can make her so.""""As I do mine,"" Elsie responded, a bright, sweet smile lighting up her face. ""I love you, my Vi, and all your brothers and sisters, very dearly,--each with a love differing somewhat in kind from that given to the others, but not at all in intensity.""They lingered a moment longer, watching the young sleeper: then with a parting injunction to the nurse to be very careful of her, not leaving her alone for an instant, they went down-stairs again, and rejoined the rest of the company.""Why, no!"" cried Max, as with sudden recollection. Then hurrying to his father, who was talking on the other side of the room to Dr. Conly, and Mr. Horace Dinsmore of the Oaks, he stood waiting respectfully for an opportunity to speak.""Ah, sure enough! We must have them lighted first. Send Scipio out to put a lamp in each. Then the ladies' wraps will have to be brought down, for they would be in danger of taking cold going even that short distance without.""""So we will go in divisions,"" said Mr. Dinsmore. ""There are thirty of us--not counting the Woodburn family proper: we will make five divisions, six in each, in addition to the guide and exhibiter. Does everybody consent?""The rest of the evening passed off very pleasantly. The feast was enjoyed, every dish being pronounced a success: the Woodburn children were satisfied with the share of it allowed them,--all the more, perhaps, that a like care was exercised by the parents and guardians of the other young folks in respect to their indulgence of appetite.""Yes, you may be sure I'll come the first minute I can,"" Eva answered gayly. ""I expect to have a lovely time with you in those beautiful rooms, and I've had a lovely time to-night. Good-by,"" giving her friend a hearty embrace."
"""Not a whit better than I ought to be, my darling,"" he responded, bending to kiss the sweet, upturned face. ""I have taken you from a tender mother and a most luxurious home, and it must be my care to see that you lose nothing by the transplantation--sweet and delicate flower that you are!""""Well, what if we do? isn't it the very best sort of a society for husband and wife to form? Levis, am I to have no duties in this house? none of the cares and labors that the mistress of an establishment is usually expected to assume?""""You shall have no care of housekeeping that I can save you from,"" he said. ""I undertake that, with Christine as my head assistant; though you, of course, are mistress, with the right to give orders and directions whenever you will--to housekeeper, servants, children, even to your husband if you see fit,"" he concluded with a humorous look and smile.""Certainly, love; I intend to be as good and faithful a father to her as I know how to be: but you are her mother, and will do a mother's part by her, I know. Then, there are wifely duties which you would not wish to delegate to any one else.""""I know it, sweet wife. Ah!"" glancing at his watch, ""I must tear myself away now from your dear society, and attend to the duties of employer and teacher. I have some directions to give both _employees_ and children.""When the tasks had been assigned to each, ""Now children,"" he said, ""I am going to leave you for a while. I can do so without fear that you will take advantage of my absence to idle away your time; for I know that you are honorable and trustworthy, also obedient. I have seldom known any one of you to disobey an order from me.""""Thank you, papa,"" Max said, answering for both himself and sisters, and coloring with pleasure as he spoke. ""We'll try to deserve your praise and your confidence. But are we to consider ourselves forbidden to speak at all to each other while you are gone?"" Lulu's temper was not conquered, but she was more successful than formerly in combating it. The terrible lesson she had had in the injury to her baby sister, consequent upon her outburst of passion, could not easily be forgotten: the bitter recollection was often a great restraint upon her, and her father's loving watchfulness saved her many a time, when, without it, she would have fallen; he kept her with him almost constantly when at home,--and he was rarely absent,--scarcely allowed her to go anywhere off the estate without him, and seemed never for a moment to forget her and her special temptation: the slightest elevation in the tones of her voice was sure to catch his ear; and a warning look generally proved sufficient to put her on her guard, and check the rising storm of anger.There were several reasons why it was--as she often asserted--easier to be good with him than with Mr. Dinsmore: he was more patient and sympathizing, less ready to speak with stern authority, though he could be stern enough when he deemed it necessary. Besides, he was her father, whom she greatly reverenced and dearly loved, and who had, as she expressed it, a right to rule her and to punish her when she deserved it.Her father, glancing up from the letter he was writing, saw an ominous frown on her brow, as she bent over her slate, setting down figures upon it, and quickly erasing them again, with a sort of feverish haste, shrugging her shoulders fretfully, and pushing her arithmetic peevishly aside with the free hand.""Yes, just now. When you think you have been out the specified number of minutes, you may come back; but I shall not find fault with you if you are not quite punctual, as you will not have a timepiece with you.""""Ah! I see you feel better,"" her father remarked, smiling kindly upon her; ""and I have finished my letter, so have time to talk with you. Max and Gracie, you may take your turn at a run in the fresh air now."""
"""It's these vulgar fractions, papa,"" she said, giving herself an impatient shake. ""I don't wonder they call them vulgar, for they're so hateful! I can't understand the rule, and I can't get the examples right. I wish you wouldn't make me learn them.""""If you hadn't done it, papa, or if you had spoken sternly to me, as grandpa Dinsmore would have done in your place, I'd have been in a great passion in a minute. I was feeling like just picking up my slate, and dashing it to pieces against the corner of the desk.""He went on, ""Anger is great folly. The Bible says, 'Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.' It seems to be the sort of foolishness that, more than any other, is bound in the heart of this child of mine. It seems, too, that nothing but 'the rod of correction' will drive it out.""Some weeks later--it was on an afternoon early in December--Lulu and Grace were in their own little sitting-room, busied in the manufacture of some small gifts for ""papa and Maxie,"" who were, of course, to be kept in profound ignorance on the subject till the time for presentation; therefore, the young workers sat with locked doors; and when presently Maxie's boyish footsteps were heard rapidly approaching, their materials were hastily gathered up, thrust into a closet close at hand, and the key turned upon them. Then Lulu ran and opened the door.""Hollo!"" cried Max, in a perfectly good-humored tone, ""what do you lock a fellow out for? It looks as if you're up to some mischief. I just came to tell you there's company in the parlor, and they've asked for you, both of you.""The children all felt rather flattered by the call, because the Oaks young people were older than themselves. Horace, Frank, and Maud were all older than Max, and Sydney was between him and Lulu in age.With the Dinsmore girls, the Raymonds were quite well acquainted, having seen them frequently at Ion, and sometimes met them elsewhere; but the boys, who had been away at school, were comparative strangers.Violet was in the parlor chatting pleasantly with her young cousins, the call being intended for her also; and her cheerful presence set her little step-daughters more at their ease than they would otherwise have been.""It is to be a young people's party, you must all understand,"" said Maud, who seemed to be the chief speaker, ""and so the captain and cousin Vi are not invited: not that cousin Vi is not young, you know, for she is that; but there are to be no married folks asked.""There is to be the usual Christmas-eve party at Ion for all the family connection, Christmas-tree and all that, and the grand dinner-party on Christmas Day; then all the boys and girls of the connection are invited to the Oaks to stay till the next Saturday evening.The invitation was declined with thanks; ""they had other calls to make, and must be going presently:"" but they sat for some minutes longer, the whole four joining in an animated description of various diversions planned for the entertainment of their expected guests, and repeating again and again that they hoped Max and his sisters would be permitted to come.""Let me hear about it,"" he said, sitting down, and allowing Lulu to take possession of one knee, Gracie of the other; ""but speak one at a time. Max, you are the eldest: we will let you have the first turn.""""I am glad my little Gracie does not care to go,"" he said, caressing the child as he spoke, ""because she is too feeble and too young to be so long among comparative strangers, without papa or mamma to take care of her. I am sorry Lulu does want to accept the invitation, as there is an insuperable objection to letting her do so.""""You cannot go, Lucilla,"" he said gravely, and with some sternness of tone. ""Max,"" in answer to the eagerly questioning look in the lad's eyes, ""if you are particularly desirous to go, you have my permission.""Lulu was silenced for the time; but after tea, going into the library, and finding her father sitting there alone, she went up to him, and in her most coaxing tones said, ""O papa! won't you _please_ let me go? I'll be""--"
"She felt sorely disappointed, angry, and rebellious; but, as her father had said, a few moments' reflection showed her the reason of his refusal to allow her to accept the invitation to the Oaks: and, as she glanced round her rooms at the many pretty things his indulgent kindness had supplied, her anger changed to penitence and love.""Of course, papa was right,"" she sighed to herself, as she moved about, getting ready for bed; ""and it wasn't because he doesn't love to see me happy; and I wish, oh, _how_ I wish, I'd been good about it!""""I hope you did not neglect to kneel down and ask forgiveness of God?"" he said inquiringly, in a gentle, tender tone, bending over her, and smoothing her hair as he spoke. ""You do not need to be told, that, when you are rebellious and disobedient to your earthly father, you are so toward your heavenly Father also; because he bids you 'honor thy father and thy mother.'""""Yes,"" he said, giving her a kiss. ""I am sorry to have to deprive you of the pleasure of accepting that invitation, but I cannot yet trust you anywhere away from me; and it was to spare your feelings that I did not state my reason before your mamma and brother and sister.""""Thank you, dear papa: I'd like to go ever so much, but I don't deserve to,"" she said humbly, ""or to have any Christmas gifts. If I were you, and had such a bad child, I wouldn't give her a single thing.""It was a joyful surprise to Lulu when, at the breakfast-table the next morning, her father said, ""Children, your mamma and I are going to drive into the city, and will take you all along: and, as I suppose you would like to do some Christmas shopping, I shall advance your next week's allowance,--perhaps furnish something over,"" he added, with a kindly smile.When family worship was over, the captain handed a little roll of bank-notes to each, saying, ""Now run away, and get yourselves ready for your ride. Put on your warmest clothing, for the wind is sharp.""""Papa,"" she said, rushing up to him, where he sat beside a table, with some papers before him, and throwing her arm round his neck, ""dear papa! you are just too good and kind to me! Oh, I don't mean to be disobedient, wilful, or passionate ever again!""""I am rejoiced to hear you say that, my dear little daughter,"" he replied, putting his arm round her, hugging her close, and kissing her tenderly; ""and I do not think I shall ever regret any thing I have done for you or either of the others. It is, to me, the greatest pleasure in life to do whatever I can to make my children happy."" The morning of the twenty-fourth found Grace almost too ill, with a heavy cold, to be out of bed; and it was quite evident that she would not be able to go to the Christmas-eve party at Ion, or the dinner on Christmas Day.The captain was just finishing his morning toilet when Lulu knocked at his dressing-room door. She had come with the news of Grace's illness, and he followed her at once to the bedside of the sick child.""I am glad indeed that my little daughters love each other so dearly,"" the captain said, kissing first one and then the other. ""Well, we will see what can be done. If it were not for the disappointment to your mamma, I should stay at home with you, my darlings; as it is, I shall spend at least a part of the evening with you.""""I confess that I am a little troubled about Gracie,"" he replied: ""she seems to have taken a very heavy cold. I shall send at once for the doctor. And, of course, she has to be disappointed in her expectations for this evening.""""Then, let us all stay at home,"" returned Violet promptly. ""I could not enjoy myself, leaving the poor darling at home, sick. Besides,"" glancing from the window, ""do you see? it is snowing fast, and I should not like to expose baby to the storm. So I propose that we change our plans entirely, and have a private Christmas of our own,"" she went on in a lively tone. ""What do you say to it, my dear?"""
"The little girls, shut up in their own apartments,--Grace reclining on a couch, Lulu with her as constant companion, and making every exertion for her entertainment, while papa, mamma, and Maxie came running in now and then to ask how she was,--knew nothing of messages sent back and forth through the telephone, of packages of various shapes and sizes brought into the house, of mysterious goings and comings, and much time spent by papa, mamma, Maxie, Christine, and others in a certain large room, hitherto but little used.Grace frequently fell asleep: then Lulu would darken the room, go into the adjoining one, leaving the door ajar, so that she could hear the slightest movement her little sick sister might make on waking, and amuse herself with a book or her own thoughts.Their meals were brought to them, and set out in their sitting-room upon a little round table, covered with a snowy damask cloth, whereon were arranged a set of dainty china dishes of a size just suited to the occasion, and toothsome viands such as ""papa"" deemed they might eat and enjoy without danger to health.""Ah! she is a good deal better,"" Dr. Conly said, when he had examined his little patient. ""Hardly well enough yet to go to Ion,"" he added with a humorous look and smile; ""but I think, if well wrapped up, she may venture a trip down-stairs in papa's arms, and even stay a little while, if she finds the change to the parlor a pleasant one.""So a large shawl was brought, and carefully wrapped about Gracie's little slender figure; and she made the short journey in her father's strong arms, the doctor and Lulu going on before, hand in hand, chatting and laughing merrily.Then what a surprise for the little girls! A large, handsome Christmas-tree, loaded with beautiful things, burst upon their astonished sight, and was greeted by them with exclamations of wonder and delight.""Oh! oh! oh! it's the very prettiest Christmas-tree we ever saw! And we didn't know we were to have any at all! And how many, _many_ lovely things are on it! Papa, papa, how good and kind you are to us!""""Who, papa?"" asked Gracie, laying her head on his shoulder, and gazing with delighted eyes, beginning to single out one beautiful object from another as she sent her glances up and down, here and there.""They're ever so good and kind! they always are,"" she said in grateful tones. ""Oh!"" for the first time perceiving that Violet stood near her with the baby in her arms, ""mamma and baby too! and how pleased baby looks at the tree!"" for the little one was stretching her arms toward it, and cooing and smiling, her pretty blue eyes shining with delight.They were very numerous,--nearly everybody having given to nearly everybody else,--and many of those received by the parents and children were very handsome. But their father's gift--a tiny watch to each, to help them to be punctual with all their duties, he said--was what gave the greatest amount of pleasure to Lulu and Grace.The weather being still too severe for the little ones to be taken out, the captain and Violet went to Ion only for a call, and returned early in the day, bringing a portion of the party that usually gathered there, to dine with them at Woodburn.But Lulu's rebellious feeling about it was a thing of the past. She told Evelyn frankly her father's reason for refusing his consent, adding that she felt that he was right, and that he was so dear, so kind and indulgent in every thing that he thought best to allow, that she was now entirely satisfied to stay at home; particularly as Gracie was not well, and needed her nursing.Grace went early to bed and to sleep. Max and Evelyn had gone to the Oaks: there were only grown people in the parlors now; and Lulu did not care to be there, even if she had not wanted to be near her sleeping sister."
