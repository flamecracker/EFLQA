passage
"On the quiet sedgy bank of a stagnant pool, and under the shadow of rank reeds and bulrushes, sat two frogs. They had retired from the shoal, who were disporting themselves in the water, and were earnestly talking. The elder of the two, an old matron, addressing the younger, who, by-the-by, was her son, said,--""Ah, my son!"" continued the old lady, ""I see that, like most young frogs, you are very obstinate, and will not listen to reason. But why on earth you should wish to go gadding after a poor, hungry little mouse, is more than I can tell--you with your beautiful legs and speckled coat, born to a splendid estate of reeds and water, the heir of nine bulrushes and a water-lily. I thought you were more of a frog.""""You are no better than a tadpole!"" said his mother, getting very angry at last; and no sooner were the words out of her lips, than up jumped Master Froggy in a passion, and taking his opera-hat under his arm, off he went at a rapid pace, singing at the top of his voice, so as to hide his rage,--Froggy had not walked very far before he saw, jogging on before him, a brown little fellow in a long-tail coat and Blucher boots, who carried an old cotton umbrella. ""Dear me,"" thought the Frog, ""that looks like my friend Mr. Rat;"" and sure enough so it was.So Mousey drew some beer, and they sat down very cosily; and soon were chatting so comfortably, that Master Froggy thought he should soon get rid of his bashfulness, and then should be able to ask pretty Mrs. Mousey to marry him. Presently their little hostess proposed a song, and called upon Froggy to oblige; but, ""Really,"" he replied, ""I must be excused, for the fog last night gave me such a cold that I'm as hoarse as a hog."" He didn't forget that he had been singing ""Rowley, powley,"" as he came along, but he was afraid that his voice was not good enough for his company.So she sang a pretty little song she had just composed, and a very charming ditty it was--rather shrill, perhaps, but very well sung indeed. After this, I need hardly tell you that they enjoyed themselves amazingly. Perhaps Mr. Rat drank rather too much beer; but altogether it was a very pleasant little party, and Froggy had so far got over his bashfulness as to squeeze Mrs. Mousey's paw once or twice rather tenderly.Slowly and cautiously they crept on towards Mrs. Mousey's cottage, till at an unexpected moment, and just as Mrs. Mouse was going to get a fresh mug of beer, in tumbled the Cat and her kittens. Down went the Rat under the Cat's paw--up in a corner the two kittens got the Mouse.""Holla!"" says the Frog; ""this won't do! Perhaps they'll be after me in a minute. I must be off home to my mother."" And sure enough off he went (trembling like a leaf), but as rapidly as he could. ""Oh, why did I ever leave home?"" said this foolish Frog: ""I should have been safe enough with my mother. I'll never leave home again. Never! never! never!"""
