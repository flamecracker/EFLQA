"NAN SHERWOOD AT PINE CAMP Or The Old Lumberman's Secret NAN SHERWOOD AT LAKEVIEW HALL Or The Mystery of the Haunted Boathouse NAN SHERWOOD'S WINTER HOLIDAYS Or Rescuing the Runaways NAN SHERWOOD AT ROSE RANCH Or The Old Mexican's Treasure NAN SHERWOOD AT PALM BEACH Or Strange Adventures Among the Orange Groves The three girls bent eagerly over Mrs. Bragley as she opened one paper after another 66 Nan's eyes were following the figures of two men strolling down the deck 140 He pushed Nan from him with such force that she stumbled and fell 216""And you're the girl that said coasting time would never, _never_ come,"" laughed her chum, Bess Harley, who was walking beside her with her hand on a rope attached to a bobsled that four girls were drawing.Before them stretched Lake Huron, extending farther than their eyes could see. For a long distance out from shore the lake seemed frozen solid. A small island rose above the ice about half a mile distant, and this was the limit fixed upon for the coasters. The cove between the foot of the hill and the island had a glassy coating of ice that had been swept and scraped and served for skating as well as coasting.""Much safer than that,"" interposed Professor Krenner, the teacher of mathematics and architectural drawing at the Lakeview Hall school that the girls were attending. ""You can be sure that neither Dr. Prescott nor I would take any chances on that score. A heavy logging team went over it yesterday, and the ice didn't even creak, let alone crack. And every day that passes of this kind of weather makes it thicker and stronger.""The professor's kindly eyes twinkled as he looked from one to the other of the rosy-cheeked, sparkling-eyed girls, bubbling over with fun and vitality. He had just come up from the queer little cabin in which he lived at the edge of the lake. It was part of his work to supervise the coasting and, as far as possible, keep it free from accident.About his sole diversion was playing on a key bugle, and the long-drawn-out notes of the instrument, sometimes lively and sometimes in a minor strain, were familiar sounds to the girls, and often an occasion of jesting.Professor Krenner held the bugle in his hand now, and after glancing at his watch, he raised the instrument to his lips and blew a clear call that had the effect of hastening the steps of some of the groups that were coming toward the hill from the Hall, the roof of which could be seen over the tops of the trees.Outdoor sports were made much of at Lakeview Hall, not only in the catalogue designed for the perusal of parents, but in actual fact. ""A sound mind in a sound body"" was Dr. Beulah Prescott's aim for her pupils, and exercise was as obligatory as lessons. None was excused without an adequate reason, and the group upon the hill grew in numbers until it seemed as though all the members of the school were present except the smaller girls, who had a slide of their own.""For goodness' sake, don't ever let Linda Riggs hear you say anything like that, Laura Polk,"" admonished Bess. ""She's so conceited that she wouldn't know it was sarcasm. She'd think it was a tribute drawn from an unwilling admirer.""A tall girl, wearing expensive furs and having a supercilious air, came along with two or three companions. It was noticeable that she left to them the work of drawing the bobsled, while she sauntered along, ostentatiously adjusting her furs as though she sought to call attention to their quality.""I never get anywhere early,"" snapped Linda. ""It isn't good form. When I go to the theater I always get in late. I always have the best seat that money can buy reserved for me, so what's the use of hurrying? Of course it's different when one has to go early and scramble for a seat.""""That may be your habit in Chicago, but it isn't in favor here, Miss Riggs,"" said Professor Krenner dryly. ""But now that all seem to be here, we'll start the races. You understand that all sleds are to keep three minutes apart so as to avoid accident. The course is straight out on the lake, and the best two out of three trials win the race. Miss Sherwood, since you are nearest the starting line, suppose you get your sled in position to lead off. Not so fast, Miss Riggs,"" he went on, as Linda tried to shove her sled to the crest of the hill. ""I said Miss Sherwood was to go first."""
"""I don't see why I should have to wait,"" pouted Linda, as she reluctantly drew back her sled before the decided look in the professor's eye. ""Hateful old thing,"" she remarked in a low voice to her special friend and intimate, Cora Courtney. ""He favors Sherwood because she attends his poky old lectures on architectural drawing and pretends she likes them.""""I shouldn't be surprised if that were just it,"" replied Cora, who made a habit of agreeing with the rich friend whose friendship often proved profitable to Cora. She had no money herself but clung closely to those who had.There would have been little dissent from Rhoda's verdict, for Linda had few real friends among the girls of Lakeview Hall. She was purse-proud and vulgar, and, though her money gave her a certain prestige among the shallow and unthinking, she lacked the qualities of mind and heart to endear herself to any one.By this time the girls who were going with Nan had taken their places on the sled. It was a new one that Nan had received as a present from her father, and it had not yet been tested. Nan had named it the _Silver Arrow_, and she had high hopes that its speed would justify the name.Nan sat at the head, with the steering wheel in her hands. The wind had brought the roses to her cheeks, and her clear eyes shone like stars. Behind her in order sat Bess Harley, Rhoda Hammond, Grace Mason and Laura Polk, each girl holding tightly to the belt of the girl in front.Professor Krenner lifted the bugle to his lips and gave a clear, sonorous blast that served at the same time as a signal for starting and as a warning to any one who might be crossing the path at the foot of the hill.There were delighted and at the same time somewhat fearful squeals from the girls, as the wind whistled past their ears while the sled flew on at a speed that quickly reached a mile a minute. They held on to each other for dear life, but Nan had no eyes or thought for anything except that shining ribbon of path.She made the turn at the foot of the hill, the sled yielding to her slightest touch, and she only breathed freely when it shot out on the lake and there were no further obstacles to circumvent or fear.They took their skates from their shoulders and adjusted them with nimble fingers. It was the work of only a few moments. Then they rose, patted down their dresses and struck out for the shore, drawing the sled behind them.They had to keep a wary lookout for the other sleds. One came rushing along with its laughing crew, but they could see at a glance that it was not making the speed that their own had reached. Just as they reached the edge of the lake, another sled flew past, and amid the bevy of girls on it they discerned Linda Riggs.It may have been due to the more slippery condition of the hill caused by the sleds that had already passed over it, but there was no doubt in the minds of the girls that the bobsled was going even more swiftly than it had at first. They were almost frightened at the speed it developed, and yet they were delighted, for they had set their minds on beating their earlier mark.Halfway down the hill they passed Linda and her group, who had drawn up at one side to let them pass. Even at that breakneck rate of speed they could see the sneer on Linda's lips as she recognized the sled and its crew.She looked up as she heard them scream. Terror and bewilderment came into her face. She started back, then forward. Then, utterly paralyzed with fright, she stood helpless in the path of the bobsled that was rushing toward her with the speed of an express train."
"She swerved the sled in that direction. She could have made it if the woman had remained where she was. But just then she backed a step to the right. The sled struck her and hurled her aside, and she went down with a scream. The collision changed the direction of the bobsled, and by the merest fraction it escaped striking a tree. Nan, however, despite her mental anguish, kept her head and dexterously guided it into the glade, where it found soft snow and gradually came to a stop.""Here, Bess,"" directed Nan, ""you hold her head while I see if any bones are broken. And you other girls take turns in chafing her hands. If she lives near here we'll take her home and send for a doctor. If not, we'll take her up to the Hall.""The others followed Nan's directions and worked with frantic energy. And while the girls are trying to revive the unconscious stranger, it may be well for the sake of those who have not yet read the earlier volumes of this series to tell who Nan Sherwood is, and what experiences and adventures she and her friends have had up to the time at which the present story opens.Mr. Sherwood was a foreman in the Atwater Mills in Tillbury, and ""Papa Sherwood"" and ""Momsey"" and Nan were a devoted and happy family in their pretty little cottage on Amity Street. Then the mills shut down for an indefinite length of time. The Sherwoods, with others even less well able to face the future, were staring poverty and the loss of their pretty home in the face, when suddenly, in the case of the Sherwoods, fortune took a hand and sent relief in the shape of a legacy from a distant relative of Mrs. Sherwood's.To settle the business in connection with this legacy, Mr. and Mrs. Sherwood were called to Scotland. To the grief of all three, it was necessary that Nan should be left behind, but it was arranged that she should stay with her Uncle Henry, her father's brother, in a lumber camp in the Michigan Peninsula. What exciting adventures Nan had there and what she accomplished for good, can be found in the first volume of this series, entitled: ""Nan Sherwood at Pine Camp; or, The Old Lumberman's Secret.""Nan's best girl friend in Tillbury was Bess Harley. Bess was looking forward to going to school at Lakeview Hall, and, never having known any lack of money, could not understand why Nan would not say that she, too, would go. When the loss of Mr. Sherwood's position made even Bess see that it would be out of the question for Nan to go, she was inconsolable, for she was devoted to her friend, and rather dependent on her.Nan Sherwood herself wanted to go to Lakeview Hall more than she had told either Bess or her parents, and when the legacy from Scotland made this possible the two girls were delighted and went wild with joy.What they did at the Hall, the plucky spirit Nan showed on more than one occasion, and the friends they made are told of in the volume entitled: ""Nan Sherwood at Lakeview Hall; or, The Mystery of the Haunted Boathouse.""Among the girls Nan and Bess met at Lakeview Hall was Grace Mason of Chicago. In ""Nan Sherwood's Winter Holidays; or, Rescuing the Runaways"" is described the visit that Nan and Bess made to the Mason home during the midwinter holidays. It is a record of parties and girlish fun, but in the midst of this Nan succeeded in helping two foolish girls who had run far away from home.On the opening of Lakeview Hall after those winter holidays a new girl came to the school. She was from the far West, and she did not at first understand or enter into the fun of the other girls. For a while she was without friends there, but gradually Nan Sherwood's sympathy and tact worked a change and Rhoda Hammond became one with the other girls.She was not only grateful to Nan, but she became very fond of her. By this time Mr. Sherwood was well established in a business of his own, so when Rhoda asked Nan and Bess and Grace Mason and her brother Walter to go with her to her home in the West on a ranch, Nan, as well as the others, was able to accept. What exciting adventures the young people had at Rose Ranch, how staunchly they faced peril on one or two occasions, and what novel pleasures came to them, are all told of in ""Nan Sherwood at Rose Ranch; or, The Old Mexican's Treasure."""
"The ministrations of the excited girls to the poor woman soon produced an effect. The woman stirred uneasily, groaned, and at length opened her eyes, to the infinite relief of the girls, who had feared they had been participants in a tragedy.""No,"" said Nan, ""it isn't broken, I think; but it is very badly sprained. Now, girls, wrap her up well and then take hold of the ropes and we'll get her home just as soon as we possibly can. You live on the Milltown road, you say?"" she went on, turning to the sufferer. ""About how far is your home from here?""""You can show us the way then,"" said Nan, setting the example to the others by taking hold of the rope. ""Come along, girls, and we'll get there as soon as we can. Bess, hadn't you better go up the hill and tell the professor all about this, and then hurry and catch up with us?"" The road was rather a difficult one, and several small hills had to be surmounted. The girls took turns in having one of them walk beside the sled with her hand steadying their passenger, who at times protested feebly against all the trouble she was making. She volunteered the information that her name was Sarah Bragley, that she was a widow, and that she had no kith or kin in the world as far as she knew. These facts redoubled the pity of the girls, and they mentally resolved that as long as they were at Lakeview Hall they would do all they could to make life more bearable for the frail and forlorn woman who had been brought into their lives in a way so unexpected and so nearly tragic.""It's all right,"" she announced. ""I told Professor Krenner, and he told us to do all that we could, no matter how long it took, and said that he would explain the whole thing to Dr. Prescott. And Linda Riggs was there, and what do you think she said? But I'll tell you about that some other time,"" she said, as she saw a spasm of pain come over the injured woman's face. ""Here, let me get hold of that rope and we'll get on faster.""In a few minutes more they were before the tiny house, which seemed to consist of several rooms on one floor and a single room above. Everything about it suggested straitened means, and yet the girls noticed that the small windows were clean and hung with fresh dimity curtains, and that there were little flower boxes on the sills inside.Nan did as she was told. She found herself in what evidently served as a living-room and dining-room and kitchen combined. In a little room opening off to the right, she caught a glimpse of a bed. There was a wood stove with the embers of a fire in it, and the room was still fairly warm. Everything was as scrupulously neat as her first impression from without had led her to expect. But the scanty and worn furniture showed a desperate struggle with poverty that touched the girl's heart.Under Nan's directions, the girls lifted Mrs. Bragley from the sled and gently deposited her in the one rocking chair that the apartment contained, first, however, placing a cushion in it to make it more comfortable.""There's plenty of it in the little woodshed at the back,"" was the answer. ""The neighbors always cut enough for me to last me through the winter. But it's a shame that you should have to go for it,"" she called after Nan, who had already started for the woodshed."
"In a few minutes a cheerful fire was roaring in the stove. Then, following the directions of Mrs. Bragley, they found some tea and brewed it, and set out a little lunch which they pressed the woman to eat. The food and tea refreshed and revived her, and, as her shyness wore off, she talked with them freely.Nan found some arnica with which she bathed the injured ankle, and then they helped their patient to undress and get into bed. And having done this, and seen that she was as comfortable as it was possible to make her, the girls withdrew into a corner to hold, as Nan expressed it, a ""committee meeting to discuss ways and means.""""And the next,"" continued Nan, ""is to find a nurse. The poor thing is utterly helpless just now with that hurt ankle. She can't even keep up the fire, and the weather's so cold she'd freeze to death if the fire went out.""""Well, we haven't,"" replied Nan. ""So I'll tell you what we'll do. Bess and I will stay here and try to make our patient as comfortable as we can. The rest of you girls had better go right up to the Hall and tell Dr. Prescott all about it. She'll have a doctor here in less than no time, and she or Mrs. Cupp will know of some nurse they can get in the town. We'll stay here anyway until they come. But the afternoon's going fast, and you want to hurry as much as you can. It will probably be dark anyhow when the doctor and the nurse get here, and, as we don't know the road very well, we don't want to be too late in getting back to the Hall.""""Don't talk such nonsense,"" said Nan, though a slight flush had risen to her cheeks at her chum's raillery. ""But, girls, before you go there's one other thing; and that is, the matter of money. I don't suppose,"" she went on, lowering her voice lest the invalid should hear, ""that the poor woman has anything of any account. How much money have you girls with you?""""And now, shoo!"" commanded Nan, as she opened the door to hasten their exit. ""And see how quickly you can get the nurse and the doctor here. Don't bother about the sled. We'll bring that along when we come, or send over after it to-morrow.""""Rather poorly,"" was the answer. ""My ankle's hurting me a good deal. And then I have a sort of all-gone feeling. But I suppose that's on account of the shock. But I'll be all right by to-morrow,"" the woman hurried to say bravely."
"""Don't worry about anything,"" she urged. ""There won't be any expense. It's our fault that you are hurt, and the very least we can do is to see that it doesn't cost you anything to get well. You just leave it to us, please.""""How good you are!"" she said brokenly. ""There was a time when I had money enough to get along comfortably, but that was before my husband died. He thought that he was leaving me enough to take care of me for the rest of my life. But somehow or other I guess I've been cheated out of it or lost it somehow. It's all mixed up in my mind, and I don't exactly know the rights of it. I never did have any head for business, anyhow.""""There, there,"" said Nan soothingly, as she feared that her patient was getting excited. ""You can tell us all about it some other time. Let me fix your pillows now and you try to get some sleep before the doctor comes.""""Just a bit of luck that I was able to get here so soon,"" the doctor responded. ""I was just going out on another call when a girl rang me up from the school and told me of the accident. She was so excited that she stuttered, but I managed to make out what she was driving at and hurried over at once. Where is the patient?""""I'll drop in again to-morrow,"" he said. ""Sorry that I can't take you girls back and drop you at the Hall, but she oughtn't to be left alone. I can take one of you, though,"" and he looked inquiringly from one to the other.He had not been gone five minutes when there was a sound of sleighbells, and a cutter, drawn by a spirited horse, dashed up to the gate. The girls peered through the windows, but in the dark, which had now fully settled down, could not identify the newcomer. A moment later there as a knock at the door, and, on opening it, Walter Mason came in with a rush, accompanied more sedately by an elderly woman with a kindly, capable face.Walter Mason was a frank, fine-looking young man, with whom the girls had become acquainted through his sister Grace. Nan and he had been thrown much together, especially during the visit that Nan had made to Grace at the Mason home in Chicago, and a mutual liking had developed that had grown stronger with time. The girls had often teased Nan about Walter, but she had parried their thrusts good-naturedly, and stoutly maintained that Walter was simply a nice boy and good company. But she was undeniably glad to see him, though she tried to explain to herself that it was the prospect of soon getting back to the Hall that pleased her.""We stopped on our way through the village,"" he explained, as he placed the packages on the table, ""and Mrs. Ellis picked out the things that we ought to bring along. Here they are. And now if you girls will get your things on, I'll hustle you over to the Hall. You must be awfully hungry."""
"They had not thought of that, but now that he spoke of it they realized that he was right. They went in and spoke cheerily to Mrs. Bragley, promising to be over the next day to see how she was getting along, and then, followed by her tears and blessings, they put on their wraps and furs and with a cordial farewell to the nurse they hurried off, not, however, until Walter had brought in and stacked up enough firewood to last for several days.""It surely was,"" agreed Bess, with a little shiver that was not due to the cold. ""It was lucky for us that Nan kept her head. The rest of us were screaming, but Nan didn't make a sound. If she'd steered an inch to the right or to the left from what she did, we'd have gone into a tree, and that would have been the end of us.""""Thanks just as much,"" was Nan's response, as she and Bess ran up the steps, ""but I imagine you've done more than your share already. Who paid for all those good things you brought over in your sleigh? Answer me that.""Another moment and he was off with a farewell wave of the hand, and Nan and Bess entered the Hall, where they speedily found themselves the center of a chattering bevy of girls, all trying to talk at once.The rest of the girls had already had their supper, but there was plenty left, and Nan and Bess did full justice to it. They had scarcely finished when, a message came to Nan that Dr. Prescott, the head of the school, wished to see her.""I always feel nervous when I hear that Doctor Beulah wants to see me,"" remarked Laura, the madcap of the school. ""But perhaps Nan has a better conscience than I usually have. Run along now, Nan, and take your medicine, and then come back and tell us all about it.""Dr. Beulah Prescott was a woman of culture and marked executive ability. For many years she had been the head of the school, and had won for it an enviable position among institutions of its kind. She had a large and valuable clientele, which was constantly expanding.She was an extremely good-looking woman, and exquisitely groomed and dressed, although with an utter absence of ostentation. She knew the value of appearance, especially before the critical eyes of her schoolgirls, and never allowed herself to be seen at a disadvantage. Her rule was mild, but just and firm, and all the girls knew that she was not to be trifled with. Behind her back they often referred to her as Doctor Beulah, but none permitted herself any familiarity in her presence. Her poise was perfect. No one had ever seen her angry or flustered. When she did not inspire ardent affection, she always commanded the genuine respect of her pupils.""It was a very narrow escape,"" she commented, when Nan had finished. ""I am thankful beyond words that none of the girls was hurt or killed, as they so easily might have been. And I want to congratulate you on the way you played your part. I notice you left that out of your story, but others have already told me how cool and clear-headed you were through it all. I'm glad that you happened to be steering."""
"""I differ with you there,"" replied Dr. Prescott, with a smile. ""But we won't discuss that. What must be done is to make the coasting safer in the future. After this, I will have some one stationed at that crossing to warn passers-by. As for that poor woman, I will see that all the expenses of her illness are paid and that she is compensated besides for the fright and pain she has undergone.""""That is true,"" was the response. ""Her husband was a hard-working man and had saved up some money. But he was inclined to invest his savings in rather risky enterprises, and I imagine he was swindled out of most of it. It seems to me that I have heard something of that kind, though I don't recall it clearly.""""None whatever,"" rejoined Dr. Prescott. ""In fact, I shall be very glad to have you do so, provided, of course, that you don't let it interfere with your school work. You can go now, Nan. You must be tired after the strain and excitement of this afternoon, and I would suggest that you go to bed early.""""I suppose you are disappointed,"" laughed Nan, as she threw herself into a chair. ""It would have been delightfully exciting if she had, wouldn't it? But talking of eating, let me have some of those chocolates, you stingy thing.""""Well,"" began Grace, ""mother and dad have been thinking about it for some time, but they wouldn't tell us about it until the last minute because they wanted to surprise us. Just as soon as I got the news, I flew right over here to tell you girls about it.""""I don't know yet,"" answered Grace slowly. ""The holidays last for only two weeks, you know, and mother and dad are so anxious that I shouldn't lose anything of my school course that they'll probably send me back at the end of the two weeks, though they may stay a little longer. I only wish the holidays were four weeks long instead of two.""""Just think of what _fun_ you can have there,"" remarked Bess Harley. ""I suppose you'll play tennis. What joy to be able to play tennis and get your nose sunburned in the middle of winter. Think of you playing tennis in Palm Beach sunshine while we are shivering around fires.""In a twinkling two motionless forms lay in Nan's bed. Rhoda had switched off the light, and the high backs of chairs and sofa hid crouching figures, while the almost too regular breathing of the supposed sleepers was the only sound to be heard when the door opened and the severe and angular form of Mrs. Cupp stood outlined in the dim light from the corridor.If she could have heard the bursts of smothered laughter as the lights were turned on and Laura and Bess, almost exhausted by their efforts to keep up that steady breathing, tumbled from the bed and the others rose from their hiding places and shook and stretched themselves to get the cramps out of their limbs!""Yes, sweetheart,"" said Rhoda meekly, as she flopped down into the nearest seat at hand. ""That is really a most interesting and all-important question, and we will come to that anon. But first I want to remark that I feel as though we had been nearly caught at a regular spread."""
"""Spread! Where have I heard that word before?"" exclaimed Laura dramatically. ""Isn't it time we had a regular one? I tell you what, girls, let's celebrate by having a real honest-to-goodness spread. There's a reason.""""I should say as much!"" agreed Rhoda. ""The idea of Grace Mason needing a new summer outfit. What's the objection to that lovely crêpe de chine that made me green with envy when you wore it last summer?""""Since you are resurrecting the old gowns so vigorously,"" laughed Grace, ""I begin to think I may get through without so many new things after all, especially as the old gowns will be new to the people I shall meet at Palm Beach. Of course mother will have a dressmaker, and she'll alter and freshen up and make a few new things. But she can't do such a very great deal in the little time from now to the holidays. If it was any other place than Palm Beach, I wouldn't even think about dress. But it's such a very swell place, you know, girls, and I don't want to feel out of place while I'm there. Of course you know how I feel.""""Oh, girls, girls!"" cried Grace, ""you make me impatient to be there at this very minute. There's one thing,"" she added quizzically, ""if no other orange blossoms ever come my way, I'll at least have had those.""""No need for you to worry about that,"" returned Laura, ""with that young Palm Beach millionaire--or is it billionaire?--waiting to greet you and some day crown that fair brow of thine with fragrant orange blooms. Methinks I can already smell their fragrance and hear the strains of the justly celebrated wedding march of Mendelssohn.""""Oh, dear,"" sighed Nan musingly, ""doesn't it seem a shame that everybody can't have wonderful things? If only a very small part of the surplus wealth could be divided among those who are struggling just to live, what a different world this would be. It doesn't seem right that so many people should have everything and others have little else than work and worry. Those people at Palm Beach have wealth, luxury, everything to make life splendid, while others have so little. Things certainly are uneven in this world. Take Mrs. Bragley, for instance.""""Get an icicle for her,"" answered Rhoda, and a moment later brought to view an icicle she had broken away from a projection above the window. The icicle was all of a foot and a half long and an inch or more in thickness.""Palm Beach,"" echoed Bess disgustedly, as she reluctantly slipped out of her warm bed and reached for her bathrobe. ""It reminds me of it--it's so different. When that horrid old rising gong sounded, I was dreaming that I was there standing on the beach ready for a swim. I can feel that warm sand about my feet now,"" and she gave her cold little feet a vicious shove into her far from warm bedroom slippers."
"They found Grace and Rhoda already in the lower hall, and knew by their flushed faces that last night's news was still the fascinating topic of conversation. All joined in, and were soon so absorbed that Laura's voice made them start.""I did,"" replied Laura, chuckling at the remembrance. ""I dreamed I was standing on one of those great broad piazzas. The moon was shining so brightly that the palm trees stood out clearly, and the gleam of the spray could be plainly seen as the breakers came rolling up on the beach. The air was warm and delightful, and I was thinking how happy I was to be there and of you unlucky girls shivering here at Lakeview Hall, when a gong clanged, some one shouted 'fire,' and smoke came pouring out of the hotel windows. I was so frightened I woke up and found that old rising gong getting in its work. I tell you, girls, I was mad enough to bite somebody.""Several times while the girls were chatting, Linda Riggs and Cora Courtney had passed very close to them in an effort to hear what they were so excitedly talking about. But the girls had purposely lowered their voices till, when the two passed, they were talking in whispers. It was a great satisfaction to get Linda so keyed up with curiosity.""That's something I never did,"" sneered Linda; ""nearly kill any one. Of course, I'm glad no serious harm came to the woman. I don't want to see her hurt. But what fun it would have been, to see Nan Sherwood up in court for manslaughter.""""Of course, Linda Riggs, I know what makes you say those horrid things about Nan. It's because she beat you in the race yesterday. And that wasn't the last time, either. She'll always beat you, because she's worth a dozen of you.""Lessons rather dragged that morning. The girls were impatient to get together and talk. A thousand things they had heard and read of the glories of Palm Beach came between them and the printed page, and questions that burned to be asked would persist in pushing their lessons from their minds. Everybody was relieved by the ripple of laughter that went round the class when Laura, a question of capital cities coming up, slipped and said that the capital of Florida was the Royal Poinciana.The girls who were in the secret of Grace's forthcoming trip giggled and looked meaningly at each other, and the recitation went on. But the slowest quarter hours will pass at last, and on this day they merged into hours and finally brought three o'clock and freedom.""But first,"" said Bess, snatching up a small bonbon dish from the table, ""we've got to have funds, and 'the collection will now be taken.' My, but you girls are generous!"" she exclaimed exultantly, after she had counted up the donations. ""Mrs. Bragley is going to have _some_ spread!""The committee of three went around by way of the town in order to purchase materials for the surprise spread for the woman they had run down. When the basket was filled they fairly reveled in the attractiveness of its contents. Boxes of crisp delicate crackers, tumblers of jelly, jars of imported strawberries and cherries, a bunch of California grapes that Rhoda said she was sure would weigh three pounds, and some unusually fine Florida oranges. Piling the basket on the sled that they had brought with them, they started gaily off, dragging it behind them."
"""Well, dearie,"" answered the woman, evidently pleased with Rhoda's interest, ""some years ago my husband thought he saw his way to make a little fortune for us. He heard of a company in Florida that was developing orange lands, and it looked so good to him that he bought a share in it. He thought he was going to make money enough out of it to make us safe for life. But nothing ever came of it.""""Let me see,"" mused Mrs. Bragley, wrinkling her brow with the effort to remember. ""It was somewhere in Florida, but I can't remember the name. It was--it was--I can't just think. Not that it matters much, anyhow, but I hate to forget things that way. Sun--sun--Sunny Slopes. That's what the name was.""The three girls bent eagerly over Mrs. Bragley as she opened one paper after the other, prospectuses, several of them, highly colored illustrated leaflets and descriptive circulars. Then came a certificate for forty shares in the Sunny Slopes Development Company. The only individual name on any of the papers seemed to be that of Jacob Pacomb, who, it appeared, was the manager and the developer of the tract.""That wouldn't be very likely,"" objected Nan. ""Some one would probably have settled up the business or taken it over and kept on with it. In either case, the letters would almost surely have been answered.""""I have thought of all that,"" the woman replied; ""and that is why I think it must have been all a fraud. If I had been able to spare the money I would have taken a trip to Florida and looked into the matter myself, but I never felt that I could afford it.""""It is too bad you couldn't have gone,"" said Rhoda thoughtfully; ""for if there was fraud you would then at least have found it out and could have had somebody punished. It looks to me that, knowing you were a widow and without means to look into things, they have deliberately held back any money that might have been coming to you and cheated you out of your rights.""The girls had been so interested in the papers and the story that went with them that they had thought of nothing else. Now Nan, suddenly glancing up, noticed that the old face looked white and tired. She rose at once.""I'll do worse than snowball you if you don't clear out, and that mighty quick,"" cried the blacksmith. ""I know what you came in this place for--you came to steal horseshoes and then sell 'em over to Beavertown.""As they made their way back to the school the girls talked over the matter of Mrs. Bragley's property. They came across Grace in the hall, and, bearing her off to Nan's room, told her the story of Sunny Slopes.""Why!"" exclaimed Grace, as a thought suddenly struck her, ""I'll have dad look that up while we're down at Palm Beach. You know he's a lawyer. Maybe Sunny Slopes isn't far from where we'll be staying. I'll get him to see what he can do."""
"That night had been set for the ""spread,"" and the girls went early to their rooms to get their lessons for the next day out of the way. A most unusual and unnatural silence reigned in Nan's room for nearly two hours. It was broken by a book snapping shut as Bess sprang to her feet, exclaiming with satisfaction:""Do you know, girls,"" she said in a low tone, ""I met Linda Riggs as I was coming through the hall, and her eyes were two big bundles of curiosity when she saw the things in my arms. I shouldn't be surprised----""""Blessings!"" echoed Nan. ""Well, I should say they were,"" she added, as, one after another, a big layer cake, a small fruit cake, some cakes prettily iced, bottles of choice olives, salted almonds and peanuts, jars of jelly and marmalade, fruit, and a big package of fresh assorted bonbons were drawn from the box.""Why in the world,"" said Grace as she set the plates and cups and saucers on the table, ""did we go and buy all these things? If we'd only known what that box was going to hold we wouldn't have needed half of them.""""No matter, the sandwiches and ice cream will come in well,"" said Laura. ""That is,"" she added, ""if there's anything of the ice cream left. I put it outside the minute we got it here, but it's had a long time to wait.""""Here it is,"" replied Rhoda, as she accommodatingly handed over a small glass bowl from which Bess helped herself to a generous double spoonful. One swallow of her cocoa, and she began to sputter and gasp, and finally made a frantic grab for a tumbler of water.The girls wanted to shout with laughter, but caution made them smother it as much as possible. And just at this juncture, the door opened part way without even one little warning squeak, and a severe voice said: The girls, their laughter quenched, gazed at each other for a few seconds with stupefaction. Then Nan sprang to the door, opened it, and caught sight of a silently scurrying figure that could not by any means be confounded with Mrs. Cupp's angular form or slow, measured movements.With increased hilarity the feast went on. The ice cream was brought in and found to be in a very creditable state of preservation, and the layer cake and small iced cakes were very soon being gobbled up.""You will go to your rooms, young ladies, and you will all report at Dr. Prescott's room to-morrow morning at ten o'clock,"" she decreed, and, turning, moved majestically down the corridor, leaving black consternation behind her.""You are ready to admit, I presume, that you have broken one of the rules of the school. That I can understand. But that you should have been guilty of disrespect to one of the officers of the school is quite another and more serious thing. Have you any explanation to offer?""""That puts things in a better light,"" said Dr. Prescott, when Nan had finished. ""But to make you more careful in future and to remind you that the rules of Lakeview Hall are made to be observed, not ignored, I will forbid you all to go outside the grounds for three full days. You can go now to your recitations.""The girls bowed and withdrew, and for the rest of the morning they were unusually quiet. At noon they gathered in Laura's room, dropped into the nearest chairs at hand, and looked at each other lugubriously."
"""Surely, Bess,"" assented Nan, with obliging readiness. ""It's down in my trunk. I'll go right down to the basement to-morrow after we finish our English recitation at twelve o'clock and get it for you.""During this conversation their door had been standing open, and Linda Riggs, who was passing (she made occasion often to pass Nan's door), heard every word. An exultant look came into her face, and she hurried off to find Cora. She told her eagerly that at last she knew just how and when she was going to get even with that much-hated Nan Sherwood.""I'm going to give her the scare of her life,"" replied Linda. ""The idea came to me the other day when I was in the trunk room in the basement. The steam started to blow off with such a whistle close to my ears that it made me almost jump out of my skin. I feel sure that if the steam can only be held down for a little while and then go off with a rush it will be ten times louder. If that could be made to happen just as Sherwood was going past, it would scare her out of a year's growth. She'd think her last hour had come. The trouble has been that I never knew just when she'd be there. But I know now. I just heard her say. She's in for the biggest fright of her life. How does it strike you?""""Easily,"" said Linda, with a confident ring in her voice. ""After the janitor has fixed up the fires for the day to-morrow morning he'll not be in the basement. I'll slip down before Sherwood is due to get there and tie down the valve. That'll keep the steam confined and make the shriek that much louder when it's let loose. I'll hide behind the woodpile, and just when Sherwood is opposite the furnace, I'll cut the string and--_voila_.""""Nonsense,"" retorted Linda. ""I'll take all the risk, if there is any. But there won't be. I've planned it out too carefully to make any mistake about it. It's too good a chance to get even with Nan Sherwood to let it go by.""""Oh, what's the use of talking to you!"" exclaimed Linda angrily. ""You haven't got enough sense to understand. I wish I hadn't told you a word about it,"" and she turned her back upon her chum and refused to say another word."
"Meanwhile, the well-ordered routine of Lakeview Hall was proceeding as usual. The hands of the great clock in the English recitation room pointed to a quarter of twelve, and sidelong looks were being cast at it in pleasurable anticipation of the noon hour.The English teacher ran to one of the doors of her recitation room and held it fast. But there was another door in the room, and toward this the frightened girls poured in a mad stampede. Just outside was the stairway with several sharp turns, and if the fugitives jammed up on one of the landings it might mean maiming or death for some of them.Quick as a flash, Nan Sherwood acted. She sprang to the danger door, slammed it shut and put her back against it. The tide surged up against her. The younger girls clawed at her, scratched her hands, did all in their power to force her away from the door. But she held her place with desperation, though her clothes were torn, and her hands were bleeding.Just then help came. Rhoda Hammond and Bess Harley caught hold of Linda and pulled her away. They thrust her into a seat and held her down, while Laura and others of the older girls pacified and soothed the younger ones.The worst was over. The steam had thinned out and drifted away. The pupils slowly went back to their seats at the command of the teacher and sat there, sobbing and moaning and weak from excitement. But the panic had been quelled.Just then, Dr. Prescott, who from the moment of the first alarm had been in other parts of the building, helping to quell the excitement, entered the room. She took her stand beside the teacher and held with her a brief conversation in which she learned what had occurred in the room. Then she spoke a few quiet words of assurance, telling the girls that there had not been, and was not now, any danger and warmly commending the bravery and self-control of the teacher and the older girls. She then dismissed them.A refreshing half-hour in their rooms did the girls a world of good, and when the lunch gong sounded they gathered about the table in something like their normal spirits. It is true that none ate very much, but tongues flew fast in comment and conjecture.""What do you think I heard downstairs!"" she cried before she was fairly in the room. ""Doctor Beulah thinks that it wasn't an accident at all, but that the whole thing was caused by some one tampering with the boiler.""Knowing as they did that an examination of the steam plant had been going on, and their interest and curiosity quickened by the rumors they had heard, it was not long before every seat was filled and all eyes turned expectantly on Dr. Prescott. She sat there, rather pale, but dignified and well poised.""A thorough examination has shown us,"" she began, ""that the steam plant is very badly damaged, though we hope that it may be possible to repair it in a short time. But the investigation,"" she went on, ""has revealed the almost unbelievable fact that there was no accident, but a deliberate plan or trick. Who conceived it or why, is not yet known, but we will spare no effort to find the guilty party and bring him or her to punishment. I am very thankful that the injury was confined to the steam plant and that no one was hurt, as might easily have been the case."
"""I am very proud of the presence of mind and bravery shown by the teachers and many of the students. Many of the younger girls and all the older ones, with one shameful exception""--she paused, and all eyes were turned on Linda, who sat cowering in her seat--""showed remarkable self-possession, and I take this opportunity to thank them all. I hesitate to mention any names, but I must single out Nan Sherwood, who, by her prompt action and cool courage, contributed in so large a measure to avert the dreadful consequences of a panic.""As the girls left the assembly hall they broke out into a Babel of excited comment. Dr. Prescott, crossing the hall on the way to her office, placed her arm over Nan's shoulders and thanked her personally. Nan's heart swelled at the earnest words of praise, for Dr. Prescott's good opinion was highly valued.School without heat in weather that came close to the zero mark was not very enticing, and it was glad news to all the girls when it was announced that, owing to the injury to the steam plant, which was greater than was at first thought, the school term would end nearly a week ahead of time pending extensive repairs. Those who were going home were directed to begin to pack at once, and those who were not would be provided with quarters in the village.Bess gladly acquiesced, and the two girls were off. They were delighted to find Mrs. Bragley sitting up and able to get around a little with a cane. She greeted them gratefully and was profuse in her thanks for all the care they had shown her. And she was intensely interested in their story of the explosion at the school.""And now,"" said Nan, after they had chatted for a while, ""how about those papers? We are going home sooner than we thought, and if you will give them to me I will show them to Grace Mason's father. He is a very able lawyer and will get to the bottom of this orange grove if any one can.""""My name is Thompson,"" the visitor said, as he rose and bowed. ""I came from Florida to see you on a business matter. I'm sorry to learn that you are not well, and I'd put the matter off, only that I have arrangements made to get back home as soon as possible.""""Laws me!"" ejaculated the widow in some excitement. ""And here it was only a little while ago I was saying that I never expected to hear from it. I wrote and wrote and never heard a word from it. I began to think,"" she went on a little apologetically, ""that there might be some fraud or something of that kind about it.""""I'm very glad to hear that,"" said the simple-hearted old woman. ""He wrote such beautiful letters to us when he was asking us to put our money into the property that I thought he must be a nice man. I'm very sorry that I ever had an unkind thought about him. I'm so glad to know that things are all right. I need the money so badly. And my poor husband always thought there would be a whole lot of money come from it.""""Quite right, quite right,"" he said. ""There ought to have been a big profit from it. Everybody thought so, and nobody felt more sure of it than Mr. Pacomb himself. He thought so well of it that he put every cent of his own money into it."""
"""No,"" he said, ""that's the unfortunate thing about it. You see, Mrs. Bragley, the thing didn't turn out as we had hoped and expected. The land was right in the orange belt, and we had every reason to believe that it would yield big results. But for some reason or other it didn't. The ground couldn't have been adapted to it. You never can tell about orange groves.""""Oh, no, not all,"" the stranger hastened to say. ""There is still a little money for you, if you want to sell what interest you have in the property. Of course the property has proved practically worthless. But the man who has a country estate bordering on the property is willing to pay the company a small sum just to round out his estate, and your interest in it we calculate would be about two hundred dollars. In fact,"" he went on with a burst of generosity, and at the same time taking a roll of bills from his pocket, ""Mr. Pacomb would be willing to give you two hundred dollars to settle the matter up at once.""He began to count out the bills, as if the matter had been agreed upon. It was a long time since Mrs. Bragley had seen so much money, and in her straitened circumstances two hundred dollars seemed like a fortune. The visitor had counted on the influence exerted by the sight of the money, and he was not disappointed.""Well, Mrs. Bragley,"" he said, ""it's for you to do what you choose in this matter. It's too bad for you to lose this two hundred dollars when you might just as well have it as not. Suppose I see this young lady and tell her that you want the papers back.""""I wish you would,"" replied the old lady. Then she gave the man Nan's name and told him where she thought he could find her. He scribbled the name and address in a notebook, and a little later hurried away.""That young woman from the school may be a sharp one,"" he murmured as he strode up and down the little depot platform. ""I'll have to use either force or diplomacy in getting those papers from her. I mustn't let her think they are valuable. I wonder what I can do next? It's too bad I promised to go to Chicago to attend that sale. But I can't afford to miss that."" He mused for a moment. ""Wonder if I couldn't get Davis and Jensen to do this job for me? They are hanging around doing nothing and would do almost anything for the price of a meal. Yes, I'll see Davis and Jensen and set them on the girl's track."""
"Several days passed quickly, and then came great news. The first item was a notification from Dr. Prescott that since the steam plant had required far more extensive repairs than at first had seemed necessary, the reopening would be deferred for several weeks beyond the usual time. And following this closely came a letter to each of the girls from Grace Mason. They _must_ go with her to Palm Beach. The ""must"" was underscored. She would take no denial. They would have such a perfectly gorgeous time if they could only come along. Please, please, _please!_ They simply _must_, and that was all there was about it.Nan and Bess were filled with delight and excitement. But they had to reckon with their parents, who were reluctant to spare their girls after having them with them for so short a time. But the girls coaxed and wheedled, as girls will, and the parents finally yielded, as parents will. In the next few days the matter was settled and hurried preparations were begun.More than once they had to pinch themselves to make sure they were not dreaming. Palm Beach! Land of summer, land of flowers, land of beauty! And they--Nan Sherwood and Bess Harley--were actually going to dwell for a time in that earthly Paradise!Nan breathed the words to herself. She had seen these men before since coming home from school. They had leered at her when on an errand to the drugstore, and one of them had acted as if he wanted to speak to her while she was at the depot asking for a timetable. But a man friend had come up to greet her and the stranger had slunk away.Nan was seated on an overturned suitcase on the porch of the little ""dwelling in amity."" Her hands were clasped tightly in front of her to keep her from jumping up and running off madly somewhere, anywhere--just to relieve her tremendous excitement.Never in her life had it seemed so hard to keep still. Her trunk had gone to the station, her bag was packed, and everything was ready to catch the ten-o'clock train for New York. From there she and Bess were to take the boat, which was to carry them swiftly down the coast to Jacksonville, the gateway to Florida.Everything was in readiness that is save Momsey. All that separated her from that desirable state was one small and pretty fur hat which Momsey was just now fitting on in front of the mirror in the little sitting-room.But it did take a long time just to put on one hat, thought Nan with a sigh. Momsey never used to be so slow. Then, unable to bear it a moment longer, she jumped to her feet and peeped in at the door of the little ""dwelling in amity."""
"What she saw made her pause, a smothered exclamation on her lips, her eyes dancing. For Papa Sherwood was there with Momsey and he was looking at her with as much admiration in his eyes as though they had been married only one year, instead of--oh, Nan couldn't remember how many!""That trip overseas was just what you needed to make a girl of you again, Momsey,"" Papa Sherwood was saying in a tone that matched his look. ""You might be our Nan's older sister. And isn't that a new hat?""""Excuse me,"" she said, her eyes dancing. ""Far be it from me to be in the way of anything--and, Momsey, you do look wonderful in that hat--but you know that train won't wait all day. Oh, Momsey! Papa Sherwood!""--she waltzed in upon them and hugged them gaily--""isn't it perfectly, wonderfully gorgeous?""""What now?"" repeated Nan breathlessly. ""What now? Why, Florida--Jacksonville--Palm Beach! No, don't look at me as though I had gone crazy. I'm only raving. Come on, come on, you slow pokes."" She half pushed her laughing parents toward the door. ""You can carry the suitcase, Papa Sherwood, and I'll carry the hat box. There's only one other bundle, and I'll take that one and Momsey can bring up the rear with the lunch. I wonder what Bess will say when she sees the lunch,"" she chuckled, as her father carefully locked the door of the little house and put the key in his pocket.""Well, I think I know what she will say when she tastes it,"" said her father as all three started down the street toward the more pretentious house where Bess lived. ""For Momsey put up the lunch with her own hands--and I saw what went into it.""Both Momsey and Papa Sherwood had to admit that Bess was very pretty indeed in the bright winter sunlight, but each privately thought that their Nan, with her sparkling brown eyes and flushed cheeks, was, in her own way, even prettier than Bess.""Hello, you folks!"" called Bess as she reached them, out of breath from exercise and excitement. ""I thought you were never coming. Goodness! what are you carrying two grips for? One is enough for me."" Then, without waiting for a reply, she raced on to another question. ""And that box! What's in it, Nan?"" She gazed suspiciously at Nan's mischievous face. ""It looks like a lunch box. It never is!"""
"Momsey would not go inside, as the minutes to train time were getting very few, so after a short disappearance Mrs. Harley joined them and they started toward the station together. The two girls, Nan and Bess, lead the way, swinging their bags and talking excitedly.""If you are,"" said Bess, eyeing her judicially, ""nobody would ever know it. That's just the trouble with you,"" she added plaintively, ""you are always hiding things and having secrets from me when you know very well that no one ought ever to have a secret from her chum.""""Well, you are a silly,"" said Nan absently, as her eyes wandered down the double line of shining rails to the spot where they disappeared in the distance. ""I wonder if that mean old train is going to be late after all.""""No, there it is! There it is, Nan!"" cried Bess, suddenly dancing wildly up and down the platform. ""Oh, tell the folks to hurry. Mother has my hat box. I never, never could go to Palm Beach without that hat."" And she ran back toward the older folks, waving her bag at them frantically while Nan looked after her laughingly.""Goodness! Anybody would think you were going away to stay forever,"" gasped Bess, as she tried to disengage herself from a tangle of bag and hat box and umbrella. ""For goodness' sake, look out, Nan. We are moving."" This, because Nan stuck her head far out of the window to get a last look at the dear folks on the platform.""I know we're moving,"" sighed Nan, as she turned from the window and began patiently to separate Bess from her belongings and stow the articles away in the wire basket overhead. ""I always have a funny feeling as if I were leaving half of me behind every time I say good-bye to Momsey and Papa Sherwood.""""I should say not!"" exclaimed Nan, as she thought of how many wonderful things had happened since that day when she had started out for the great north woods with Uncle Henry. ""But, oh, Bess,"" she added, turning happy eyes upon her chum, ""we never went on quite such a wonderful journey as this--not even when we went to Rose Ranch.""""Bess! How you talk!"" cried the girl from Tillbury, turning a shocked gaze upon her friend. For Nan Sherwood never failed to be shocked at Elizabeth's very evident love of money and what it could buy. ""If it were only money we cared for we might have made friends with Linda Riggs, I suppose. I heard her say something about going to Europe next summer, and I shouldn't wonder if she would take Cora Courtney and one or two more of her satellites with her. Perhaps if we had been very good, she might have asked us."""
"""Well, it would have been fun,"" said Bess, wickedly enjoying the shocked look that deepened on Nan's face. ""Cheer up, Nan,"" she added with one of her sudden changes of mood. ""You know very well how I hate Linda. However,"" she continued, ""I suppose we really ought to be grateful to her now."" Nan could not help laughing at this speech of her chum's, and she turned her chair about to face Bess. Nan did not like riding backward in a train very much herself, but as Bess had declared she ""simply couldn't stand it,"" it was unselfish Nan, as usual, who did the unpleasant thing.""I don't see why you say that Linda did that awful thing up at school,"" she said. ""We haven't the slightest proof in the world that she was the guilty one. That handkerchief you found didn't really prove anything.""""Of course we don't know that she did it,"" she said, opening the box and offering it to Nan. ""But you know very well there isn't another girl in the school who is mean enough to think of such a thing.""""Y-yes,"" answered Nan doubtfully, as she pushed the candy over toward its owner. ""But on the other hand, I never thought Linda had nerve enough to do anything like that. Why, she might have been dreadfully hurt herself!""""Isn't that just like Nan Sherwood!"" cried Bess, regarding her chum with a mixture of fondness and irritation. ""Always making excuses for everybody! I suppose if we had caught Linda in the act, you would still say it must have been somebody else.""""Hardly as bad as that,"" said Nan, with a little laugh, adding, while a cloud passed over her face: ""Goodness knows I have more reason than any of the rest of the girls for disliking Linda. She never accused any one but me of stealing. I only hope,"" she added, ""that we don't meet her somewhere on this trip.""""If I did,"" said Nan ruefully, ""I would get right off this train and go back to Tillbury, much as I have counted on this trip. No, honey,"" she added, laughing at her own extravagance, ""there's no need of your getting excited, for I have no idea that we shall meet Linda at Palm Beach. Only she has the most disconcerting way of popping up in places where you least expect her.""""Well, all I have to say,"" returned Bess, biting fiercely into a fresh chocolate and wishing it were Linda instead, ""is that I wish you wouldn't put such uncomfortable ideas into my head. Here I was just about forgetting Linda, and you have to lug her into the limelight again.""""Cheer up,"" she said, with a chuckle, ""I've done all the 'lugging' I'm going to for a little while. And in the meantime,"" she added, her voice thrilling with anticipation, ""let's think of something really pleasant--Palm Beach, for instance.""""Now you are talking!"" cried Bess approvingly. ""I have to pinch myself about every five minutes to realize that I'm really going there. I wonder if it is really as gay as people say it is. That's where all the actresses go, you know. And millionaires and authors----"""
"""You haven't come yet,"" Nan reminded her, her eyes sparkling. ""I didn't say _all_ the men were bald-headed,"" she added, in an attempt to soothe her outraged companion. ""But dad says most of them are--especially the millionaires.""""That's in the movies,"" Nan interrupted with a chuckle. ""Papa Sherwood says that if all the men had hair like the movie heroes they would have to spend all their energy growing it and wouldn't have time to attend to their brains. And then where would their millions be?""""Well,"" said Bess, unable to find an answer to this queer question, yet still indignant, nevertheless, ""you needn't go to work to spoil all my illusions. I don't believe you have a speck of romance anywhere about you, Nan Sherwood.""For a while after that the happy girls forgot to talk and sat staring contentedly out at the flying landscape while the train pounded on heavily over the rails, singing its everlasting ""catch 'em up, catch 'em up, catch 'em up.""""Oh, don't be such a silly,"" laughed Nan. ""Of course we are going to find something else. There's the ocean and the palm trees. They say the scenery is perfectly gorgeous and the two big hotels wonderful, and there'll be the crowds and crowds of people. And then we shall meet Grace and Walter----""""Of course I am,"" admitted Bess with suspicious promptness. ""Walter is jolly good fun, especially when he has his _Bargain Rush_ with him. But lately the rest of us girls--even Grace--have to hang on to his coat-tails to keep him from going off alone with you. He doesn't seem to know there's any one else around. Oh, you don't need to look so surprised, Miss Innocence,"" she added, as Nan regarded her with wide-open eyes. ""You know it just as well as the rest of us.""""Oh--oh--I never heard of such a thing!"" cried Nan, and her amazement was unfeigned. ""I think you are perfectly horrid. Why, Walter has always been lovely to all of us. And as to his going off with me alone--why, that's nonsense, and you know it, Bess Harley!"" Nan's amazement was rapidly giving way to indignation. ""Walter has never gone off anywhere alone with me, never!""""I don't think you are nice,"" she said in a low voice. ""If Walter has been any nicer to me than he has to any one else, I surely haven't noticed it. And now you've gone and spoiled everything. I won't want to go anywhere with him now just because I will be afraid you girls are saying silly things. And Walter's such awfully good fun!"" The last was very much in the nature of a wail, and Bess's heart, which was never very hard at any time, softened and she slipped over to Nan's chair and put an arm about her chum."
"""Move over,"" she commanded. ""It's lucky neither of us is very fat or we couldn't both sit in one chair. That's right,"" as Nan obediently ""moved over"" but still kept her face to the window. ""Now say you forgive me for being such an old bear. After all, honey,"" and she patted Nan's shoulder soothingly, ""I suppose it isn't your fault if Walter likes you best.""""All right,"" agreed Bess soothingly. But it was lucky Nan could not see the twinkle in her eye. ""Have it your own way, Nan. Only stop turning your back to me. It isn't polite. And, oh!"" she added, with a little sigh, ""I'm hungry.""It was eight o'clock when they went into the sleeping car, as they had been unable to secure a berth in Tillbury, and had had to telegraph ahead to have one reserved on a coach which was attached to the train further along the line.Being together they had thought to have a good ""talk-fest,"" as Bess called it. But alas! both were so tired out that they fell asleep almost before they knew it. And neither woke up until morning, when they were rolling into New York City. In her impatience Bess Harley thought she had never known a crowd to move so slowly. Of course all the people on the train were getting out at New York, for the simple reason that the train did not go any farther.At any other time the girls would have been tremendously pleased about going to New York. But now, with the even more wonderful prospect of Florida looming up, New York appealed to them simply as a means to an end.""For goodness' sake, Nan Sherwood, I wonder you don't have a record made of that question and then turn it on every five minutes or so,"" said Bess, whose temper was beginning to be ruffled by the delay. ""That's all I hear from morning to night. 'Are you sure you have everything?' I think I'll try it on you and see how you like it.""""Oh, I'd love it,"" cried Nan, with such fervor that Bess looked at her in surprise. ""It's this bag,"" explained Nan, looking down at her own handsome suitcase. ""I'm certain it will be stolen or I'll lose it or something before we can get to Florida.""""Well, it is an expensive suitcase,"" Bess admitted, as the fat man at the front of the car finished his argument with the conductor and the line of passengers moved slowly on toward the door. ""But you never used to lie awake at night worrying about it."""
"""I believe they are,"" said Nan seriously, as, with bag clutched tightly in her hand, she started with Bess down the long bustling platform. ""Anyway, I want to do my best to help the poor woman. I felt dreadfully sorry for her.""The girls had supposed they had become accustomed to the noise and confusion of a big city during their visit in Chicago, but as they stepped from the great Pennsylvania Station on to the crowded New York street they felt disconcertingly like startled country girls arriving in the city for the first time.""Well, I think we'll have our choice of taxis,"" remarked Bess, with a chuckle, as several chauffeurs standing by or sitting in cabs drawn up along the curb espied the well-dressed girls and immediately set up a cry of ""Taxi, taxi! Right this way, lady!""Looking as if she had been used to riding around in taxicabs in strange and noisy cities all her life, Nan walked forward, still clutching the precious bag that held Mrs. Bragley's papers and calmly selected a brilliant yellow cab whose driver opened the door to her respectfully.Bess followed, all eyes and ears for the noise and confusion of the street. Nan gave instructions to the chauffeur, who touched his cap, slammed the door shut on the girls and sprang to his seat in front.""I think you are just wonderful, Nan Sherwood,"" said Bess, when they were gliding swiftly off through the bewildering traffic. ""I was frightened to death when all those men started shouting at us at once. I wanted to run back into the station and hide. But _you_ didn't, and of course _I_ didn't, and here we are!"" She gave an excited little bounce on the seat. ""Only,"" she added reproachfully, ""I don't see why you picked out a yellow taxi. You know I hate yellow.""""Goodness! I didn't even notice the color,"" said Nan, feeling her suitcase with one foot to be sure it was still there. ""If you will just tell me what color you like best I'll send a note to the governor and ask him to have them painted that way.""""How sweet of you,"" mocked Bess, and a moment later grasped her chum's arm in fright. ""Did you see that?"" she cried, as the driver put on his brakes and they stopped within about two inches of the back of a great lumbering truck. ""I'm afraid this driver is going to kill us before ever we can get to the dock.""""Never mind, honey,"" said Nan soothingly, though she herself had been considerably startled at the close call. ""Papa Sherwood says all the drivers are like that in New York, and yet there are very few accidents. We must be near the dock, anyway.""""Now,"" she said, proudly exhibiting her purchase to Nan when the car was once more bumping onward over cobblestones toward the dock, ""we sha'n't starve on our trip, anyway. Oh, look, Nan; we're there!"" she cried, pointing excitedly out of the window. ""See that thing over there that looks like something between a cave and a barn with a sign over it? That must be the entrance to one of the docks. Yes, see the people going in? And there's another and another. Oh, oh!"""
"""My, what a joy killer you are, Nan Sherwood,"" sighed Bess, as she rebelliously stuffed the bag of oranges into her already over-filled suitcase. ""What are a few oranges more or less at a glorious time like this?""""Yes, Miss,"" said the man, as he started the car again. ""See that dock over yonder? That's it."" And he swung the machine about in a semicircle and headed for one of the openings which Bess had described as ""something between a cave and a barn.""Nan seized the opportunity to make good her escape, and Bess, following close upon her heels, whispered dramatically in her ear: ""Take care, woman! You shall not again escape me. Next time I will spit thee like a goose."" As the machine drove away several street urchins came running toward the girls, begging the privilege of carrying their bags. Nan would have refused, the bags being not at all heavy and the walk to the end of the dock from the entrance not very far, but Bess nudged her sharply.So Nan obeyed and reluctantly handed over to one of the eager street urchins the handsome bag which contained, among other things, Mrs. Bragley's papers. Bess had already loaded the small boy with her own belongings, and it seemed impossible to Nan that the lad could be able to carry it all.As the girls emerged from the long, tunnel-like entrance into the bright sunshine of the dock they quickened their steps instinctively. The steamship _Dorian_, which was to carry them to Florida, was already waiting for the passengers.There were a great many docks like the kind upon which she and Bess were standing, and they stretched out into the harbor like so many legs of an octopus, cleaving the brilliant water with dark ugly gashes.""Oh, Bess!"" she cried as the boy tipped his cap and started on, ""how could I ever have done such a thing? Why, if I had lost this bag I never would have dared face Mrs. Bragley again. Never in this wide world!""It was perhaps fortunate for the girls' peace of mind that they did not notice two men who were closely behind them. One of the men was fat and short and had little eyes and a bald head, which he was now mopping vigorously with a rather soiled handkerchief.His companion was his complete opposite. He was tall and thin, with a severe, straight line for a mouth and long, nervous hands, and had a habit of caressing his beardless chin as though a beard had once grown there.As the tall thin man, whom his companion called Jensen, overheard Nan's startled reference to Mrs. Bragley's papers, he put a hand upon the fat man's arm and nodded once with a sort of jerk of satisfaction.As they, in turn, stepped upon the deck, the short man looked up at his tall companion and said rather enigmatically: ""Sometimes I wonder, Jensen, whether you are a great man, or a great fool. It's certainly great to have them on this trip to Florida with us.""Although the girls knew nothing of this strange conversation, Nan was extremely careful to stow her bag away in a corner of their stateroom and piled several things on it and about it so that it could not be easily seen by curious eyes.""Oh, please hush,"" said Nan, rising quickly from her knees and coming over to Bess. ""I don't know what has gotten into me lately, Bess dear,"" she said, speaking so earnestly that her chum regarded her in surprise; ""but ever since I took charge of those papers I have had the strangest impression that I am being watched."""
"""Nan!"" cried Bess, looking uneasily over her shoulder, ""what a terrible thing. But, of course, it's only imagination,"" she added easily, for it was instinct with Bess to cast aside anything that threatened to worry her or interfere with her fun. ""I told you the old papers were getting on your nerves.""""Well, for goodness' sake get them off then,"" commanded Bess, bouncing impatiently on a berth. ""I never saw such a girl to take everybody else's troubles on her own shoulders. I'll be glad when you turn the papers over to Mr. Mason.""There are very few girls who can withstand an appeal like that, and Bess was not one of them. A smile replaced the frown immediately and the next minute she was chatting merrily about their crowded little stateroom and the two narrow berths, one above the other, wondering with a grimace whether they would be seasick or not, and so, on and on, till Nan's momentary depression forsook her and she felt again the thrill that had quickened her blood as they had stood on the dock, gazing out over the harbor.Yet, almost unknown to Nan herself, there lingered in the back of her mind a strange, uneasy premonition of trouble to come, and again and again her eyes sought the spot where the bag with Mrs. Bragley's papers stowed safely inside lay hidden.""I wonder which one of us is going to take the upper berth,"" Bess chattered gaily on. ""You had better, Nan, because you're thinner than I. And then if the berth should cave in it wouldn't hurt you so much because there would be something soft to fall on. It's a snug little place, isn't it?""""That's Linda's fault. She shouldn't have wrecked the heating system at school in the Palm Beach season. If it had been in December now, or March, there wouldn't have been such a crowd and we could have had a real honest to goodness stateroom, instead of this two-by-one hole in the wall.""""Elizabeth, how shocking,"" laughed Nan. ""You must have been taking lessons from Walter."" And then, for no apparent reason at all, or perhaps because of the expression in her chum's eyes as they rested upon her, Nan became suddenly confused and hurriedly changed the subject. It was a wonderful journey, that one to Jacksonville, and one the girls never forgot. At first the weather was unpleasant, cold and blowy, but toward the afternoon of the second day the gentle winds of the south fanned them with their welcoming breath, and heavy wraps began to feel burdensome.""I--I don't think it is going to be so awful bad,"" Nan had declared. And she had been right. By noon of the second day the sea was quite smooth. Neither of the girls felt a bit of seasickness and both were glad to go on deck and enjoy the sunshine.""It's wonderful,"" breathed Nan happily. ""It seemed so silly to pack all my summer things when the wind was blowing like mad and it was ten above zero in Tillbury. But now I'm mighty glad we did. Whew, isn't this coat warm!"""
"""Cheer up,"" cried Bess gaily. ""Maybe by to-night it will be so warm we can put all our winter things in storage and blossom out in silk georgette and white flannels like veritable butterflies from a crystal--I mean chrysalis. Nan, are you listening to me?"" she demanded severely, for Nan's eyes had deserted the long line of lazy combers and were following the figures of two men, one long and one short, who were strolling slowly down the deck.""That's just what I do mean,"" said Nan soberly. ""I didn't want to worry you, Bess, so I didn't tell you. But something happened last night----"" She stopped suddenly, for the two men were coming back again, apparently absorbed in conversation.""You remember we went down to the dining-room together,"" Nan went on in a low tone, ""and I suddenly remembered that we had forgotten to lock the door. I was a little frightened, for I thought of Mrs. Bragley's papers and our jewelry, and I almost ran back.""Well, for a minute I just stood there,"" said Nan, her eyes searching nervously for the reappearance of the two men on deck. ""I guess I was just too surprised or frightened to speak, for the shadow on the door was that of a man, and he was trying the door!""""Of course he did--although he said he didn't,"" said Nan grimly. ""When I pulled the door open suddenly and stood looking at him he acted as if I was a ghost or something. He did for a minute, that is. Then he straightened up and sort of put on a smile--you know, the way you would put on a coat to cover up a soiled dress or something----""""Why, Nan, I never----"" Bess began indignantly, then interrupted herself again. ""Never mind me,"" she begged. ""You've got me so excited that I don't know just what I'm saying. What happened then, Nan? Didn't you say something?""""He was the meanest man I ever saw--his looks I mean,"" said Nan, apparently not noticing her chum's interruption. ""If you could have seen him as I opened the door, you would feel just the way I do. He had probably seen us going down to dinner and thought it was a good chance to get into the stateroom and steal----""""But, Nan! what could he have wanted to steal from us? It isn't as though we had one of those handsome staterooms down below that cost a fortune to hire even for a night. We haven't anything so very valuable.""""I know you didn't. But I did,"" said Nan decidedly. She then added under her breath as the two men turned a corner and again headed down the deck toward them: ""Don't say anything. Wait until these men have passed and then look at them, the tall, thin one in particular."""
"Bess was about to exclaim, but Nan silenced her with a look and they waited quietly while the strangers once more sauntered past them. Evidently they were taking a prolonged constitutional about the deck.""Yes. And one of them, the tall, thin one with a slit for a mouth, is the man who tried to enter our stateroom,"" said Nan earnestly. ""I'm just telling you this so that you will be more careful to lock our stateroom door whenever you go in or out.""""Goodness--Gracious--Agnes!"" gasped Bess, mimicking Procrastination Boggs in her agitation. ""You are actually making me nervous, Nan Sherwood. Lock the door, indeed! As if we were afraid of being murdered in our beds! Why, I sha'n't sleep a wink to-night. I never heard of such a thing.""""You needn't look at me as if I were to blame,"" said Nan with spirit. ""I didn't ask that horrid thin thing and his little fat friend to follow us all over and nearly give me heart failure. I'll be glad when this trip is over, I'll tell you that.""""The one thing that makes me feel good,"" said Nan thoughtfully, as if speaking to herself, ""is that the papers must be worth something or these horrid men wouldn't be so anxious to get them back. Maybe we shall find that poor Mrs. Bragley is a rich woman yet.""""You needn't laugh, Miss Smarty,"" Bess had retorted, straightening up defiantly with a large wad of the cotton still in her hand and a telltale tuft of it protruding from the keyhole. ""I'm not going to have any skinny old man with a funny mouth looking in at me while I sleep, I can tell you! Nan Sherwood,"" she added threateningly, as Nan went off into a gale of uncontrollable mirth, ""if you don't stop laughing, I'll stuff the rest of this cotton down your throat, and I just hope you'll choke.""""Oh, Bess! Elizabeth Harley!"" gasped Nan. ""You look so foolish standing there with that wad of cotton in your hand. And the keyholes look as if they had the earache. Oh, oh!"" and she went off again into half hysterical laughter.""Goodness! you would make an Egyptian mummy laugh, Nan Sherwood,"" said Bess, as she wiped away the tears of mirth. ""Who ever heard of keyholes having the earache! Just the same,"" she added more soberly, as she started to unfasten her dress, ""you have got me terribly worried about those men. I know I'll dream of them all night."""
"""Those old papers,"" she murmured to herself. ""I should have turned them over to Mr. Mason, or put them in the ship's safe. I don't see why I make myself keep them, unless it is that I want to prove to myself that I have _some_ backbone.""Nan was not satisfied and looked all around the stateroom, thinking a mouse might be wandering around. But no mouse was found, and at last both girls retired again. But Nan did not sleep very well and was glad when the rising sun proclaimed another day at hand.Nan, swinging one bare foot experimentally over the edge of her berth, felt it caught and held tight by an invisible hand. She peered over the edge of the berth at the imminent risk of falling over herself and breaking her neck, and found, as she had expected, that Bess was her captor. The latter was holding on to her foot with one hand and rubbing her eyes sleepily with the other.""You aren't the only one,"" said Nan, as she swung her other foot over the edge of the berth and felt gingerly for a footing on the one below. ""I didn't sleep very well myself. But never mind,"" she added, as she slipped safely to the floor, unharmed by her perilous descent. ""We'll forget all about such little things as sleepless nights when we get out on deck. Have you forgotten that we reach Florida to-day?""""Gracious, Nan,"" she cried reproachfully, as she began to drag the comb impatiently through her tumbled curls, ""you scared me so with those men and Mrs. Bragley's horrible papers that I forgot everything else. Fancy! A few hours more and we shall be in Florida!""Immediately this thought put all other thoughts to flight in the mind of careless but lovable Bess Harley, and she would have left the door of their stateroom wide open had not Nan reminded her to close it and turn the key in the lock.The girls ate breakfast hurriedly, and when they came out on deck it was after eight o'clock. That gave them just time to pack their few belongings before the _Dorian_ steamed up the St. Johns River into the busy harbor of Jacksonville.Bess's prediction had come true. Over night the weather had become so delightfully mild that heavy clothing was not only unnecessary, but very uncomfortable, and the girls had donned white suits and white hats with stockings and shoes to match. They were looking distinctly attractive--and knew it. At least Bess did. And it must be admitted that even modest Nan had been surprised and not a little pleased by her radiant reflection in the tiny mirror in their stateroom.And now, though they knew that the last minute packing should be done first, they still lingered by the rail, gazing over the brilliantly calm water to where the tropically beautiful Florida coast stood out boldly against the skyline.""What wonderful, wonderful weather!"" sighed Nan, as they finally deserted the rail and made their way through the excited crowd--for nearly every one on board the _Dorian_ had come out on deck, clad in white flannels and other summery attire, eager to get their first glimpse of Florida--and on toward their stateroom.The two girls were almost upon the thin man and his companion before they were discovered. Then the fat man nudged his friend sharply, and before the girls could blink the men had slipped around the corner of the cabin and were lost to view among the crowd."
"""I know all that,"" said Nan a trifle impatiently. For several days her nerves had been under a considerable strain and the effort to think and act for Bess as well as herself was beginning to tell on her. ""It wouldn't have done us the slightest good in the world to have gone after him. We never could have found him.""""We-el,"" said Bess irresolutely, sitting down on the edge of the berth and staring blackly at the opposite wall, ""I suppose you are right, Nan Sherwood. You usually are. But I do know one thing."" She stirred impatiently and mechanically straightened her pretty white hat. ""And that is that I won't enjoy myself one bit till we make those men stop following us around and trying to get into our room with skeleton keys. I suppose that is what he had. Oh, dear, it does seem as if something were always happening to take the joy out of life!""""I should say not!"" said Bess vehemently. ""I wouldn't stay on this old boat another night after what happened this morning--not for anything. I hope,"" she added, as she slammed her brush into her suitcase, ""that we sha'n't see any more of those horrid men after we once get on shore.""That they were after the papers that had been entrusted to her care by poor, confiding Sarah Bragley, she had little doubt. And the fact that whoever these men were, they were desperately anxious to recover the papers showing the widow's title to the tract of land in Florida, fostered Nan's belief that the property must be of considerable value and automatically strengthened her determination to hold on to the papers at all cost.""Hurry up,"" she cried, handing Nan her suitcase and fairly pushing her out on the deck. ""From the noise everybody is making, I guess we're there. For goodness' sake, Nan!"" she exclaimed as her chum switched her suitcase from one hand to the other, so that it would be between Bess and herself, ""don't bump that bag into me--especially right behind the knees. You are apt to make me sit down suddenly.""""You couldn't. There's too much of a crowd,"" laughed Nan, then added in a lower tone, while her eyes nervously searched the crowd about her: ""Please help me to look out for my bag, honey. I'm awfully afraid I might lose it."" The two girls saw nothing more of the men who had played such a mysterious part in their trip, and before they had started, with hundreds of other gaily dressed people, down the gangplank of the _Dorian_ they had almost forgotten their strange adventure.""I just can't keep my feet still,"" Bess confided to her chum, as they filed slowly down the gangplank. ""Isn't this the most wonderful day you ever saw in your life, Nan? Just think, this kind of weather in _February_! It does me good,"" she added, her eyes sparkling, ""to think of all the other girls at home going around with furs on and thick coats and complaining of the cold. Oh, how I wish I could see them now."""
"""Elizabeth! what a mean disposition,"" said Nan demurely, adding with a twinkle in her eyes, while she tried hard to keep her feet from fox-trotting away with her down the gangplank: ""Though I would like to send a little note to Linda and tell her to be careful not to go out in the cold. It might make her nose red. Oh, Bess, look down there!"" She leaned forward suddenly, her eyes shining with eagerness. ""Isn't that Grace? And Walter----""""Out in Connecticut. I went there to visit a distant relative of my dad. It was a little side line and our train ran into a freight. We knocked open a car full of chickens and what do you think? Those chickens scattered far and wide. I'll bet many a family is having chicken dinner on the sly this week!""""Oh, yes, several were more or less bruised and one man had an arm broken. But everybody was thankful, for they said it might have been much worse. But it certainly was funny to see those chickens scattering in every direction over the snow-covered fields,"" and Rhoda laughed at the recollection.But it was! For at that moment the youngest of the much over-dressed women in the group turned with a laugh to speak to someone behind her, and the girls found themselves face to face with their schoolgirl enemy, Linda Riggs.For all their dislike of the girl, the chums would have spoken to her. But Linda stared at them coolly for a second, and then deliberately turned her back upon them and began to speak to a tall, gray-haired man at her right, who the girls instinctively felt must be her father, the railroad president.""Yes, I would look pretty, wouldn't I?"" laughed Nan, all her wrath vanishing on the instant, although her dislike of purse-proud Linda was more real than ever, ""announcing my arrival in Jacksonville by a street fight?""She forgot all about her perplexity a few moments later, however, when Walter helped Nan and Bess and Grace into the roomy tonneau of his big car, put Rhoda in the front seat, squeezed himself in behind the wheel, and started the motor.""Why, it is almost as noisy and crowded as New York,"" said Bess, wide-eyed, as Walter skilfully threaded his way through the heavy traffic. ""And we thought that was simply awful. Walter, please be careful.""""Don't worry,"" Walter sang back, grazing the rear wheel of another machine by the very narrowest margin possible. ""If we did hit anything, we wouldn't be the ones to get hurt. This old bus could stop an express train.""""We're stopping at the Hampton,"" she said, the Hampton being one of the largest and most important of all the large and important hotels in Jacksonville. ""Mother has engaged a perfectly lovely room for you girls. Rhoda and I room together. It is just for one night, you know, for we are going to take the train for Palm Beach to-morrow morning."""
"""More bliss,"" cried Bess, adding, as a cloud suddenly darkened her face: ""I do hope we don't run across Linda any more. I declare, if I ever hear her say another word against you, Nancy Sherwood, I shall just have to kill her, that's all.""""Well, I must say I do wish she would stay home where she belongs,"" said Nan with a troubled frown. ""Wherever we go she seems sure to turn up and spoil everything--or try to. I wonder if Cora is with her,"" she added. ""I didn't see her at the dock.""""Humph, you don't think she would be at the dock, do you?"" asked Walter, joining in the conversation. ""Cora is a regular lady's maid to Linda now, so Grace says. She must be a funny kind of girl to stand for that sort of thing.""""Oh, Cora isn't so bad,"" said Nan. ""I imagine she would like to break away from Linda, but she doesn't know just how to do it. Is this where we get out, Walter?"" she asked, as the car slowed down before a building that looked more like a palace than a hotel.""This is where we get out,"" replied Walter, jumping from his seat and running around to open the door for the girls. ""Right this way, ladies. Follow me and you'll wear diamonds. Here, boy!"" he spoke to a loitering colored boy who stood at the hotel entrance. ""Carry these grips up to three-twenty. The hat boxes, too. I suppose you want the hat boxes,"" he said, turning to the girls with a grin. Walter was frankly bewildered by this time. But he obediently took a long look at the short, fat man and the long, thin one. Then, as they disappeared around a corner, he turned back to Nan and led her toward the hotel entrance.""Why, Nan, you are trembling,"" he said, as they followed the colored boy through a handsome courtyard and between rows of beautiful palm trees. ""I never knew you to be like this before. What's the matter? If either of those men have bothered you,"" he added, glowering fiercely, ""I'll wring their necks.""""I don't want you to wring anybody's neck,"" she said, as they passed through another big door and stopped before an elevator. ""Only please, Walter,"" she looked up at him appealingly, ""watch out for them and let me know if you see them again. They are following us."""
"They reached it, however, and the girls stepped out into a handsome corridor and were preceded by the velvet-footed bellboy past interminable closed doors, to be stopped finally before one particular door, closed like the rest, but evidently belonging, for the space of a day and night at least, to Nan and Bess.Walter dismissed the boy with a tip, and, drawing a long key from his pocket, inserted it in the door. A moment more and they had stepped into a beautiful room, all blue and gold, and with deep, lacily curtained windows and twin beds set over in one corner, with a small table and a reading lamp beside each one.Nan felt unreasonably angry, but she was not given very much time to nurse the feeling. Grace was upon her like a young whirlwind, dragging her over to one of the beds and demanding in no uncertain tone what she had to say in explanation of her queer conduct a few minutes before. Rhoda sat down on the other side of Nan, her face eagerly flushed.Nan obediently went over the whole story. She told where she was carrying Mrs. Bragley's papers, and of her, Nan's, strange impression of being watched ever since the papers had come into her possession.Then while Grace and Rhoda's eyes became wider and wider she told of the two men they had met on the boat and the tall one's evident desire to get into their cabin, for some reason known only to himself. And lastly she related how on that very morning they had found the mysterious men in suspicious proximity to their stateroom again and how the two had disappeared upon catching sight of the girls.""You speak as if you liked it,"" she said impatiently. ""It is lots of fun, I must say, to have Nan so worked up and nervous all the time that you can't say boo to her without making her jump. If those old men don't get arrested or something pretty soon,"" she added, turning back to the mirror, ""I'll have to do something desperate, that's all.""""Please don't,"" said Nan, with a laugh. ""Enough is happening, goodness knows, without you starting something, too. Oh, come on, girls,"" she added, jumping up and flinging off her hat and coat. ""I'll find out something definite about Mrs. Bragley's property before long, I hope, and then I'll be able to get rid of these horrid old papers. In the meantime, here we are in Jacksonville, and to-morrow we start for Palm Beach and everything is wonderful and lovely. Who's that?"" A tap had sounded on the door and the girls started. ""You open it, Bess. I have my hands full.""That afternoon they went out right after lunch to see Jacksonville. The Mason's car was waiting for them outside as they stepped out upon the sidewalk in front of the hotel, but Nan was surprised to find Mr. Mason instead of the lawyer's son behind the wheel.Nan, who was following her chums into the big car, stopped short at this strange apparition and uttered an exclamation of surprise. The others followed the direction of her glance, and Bess stood up excitedly.""Do you like it?"" asked the boy proudly, as the nose of the impertinent-looking little runabout stopped short within about two inches of the back of the big car. ""Dad said he was afraid I would smash the jumbo, so he bought this little toy for me. Some class, isn't it?"""
"The little car had a surprisingly deep, wide tonneau, and Nan sank back in it luxuriously. She was conscious of the admiring scrutiny of spectators, and then Walter did a few skilful things to the machine and it started purringly forward after the big car, both for all the world like a full-grown horse and its colt.Jacksonville itself seemed to them very much like any busy, thriving city--except that there were more hotels. But when they came to the outskirts of the city they were charmed and wanted to go on forever.Having lived all their lives in a temperate climate, the tropical beauty of the Florida country entranced them and they exclaimed again and again as beautiful new panoramas opened before them. The moss-hung live oaks especially drew exclamations of wonder from Nan.Nan obeyed, but, strangely enough, felt none of the uneasiness that she had felt on board the boat and in the hotel. There was something about the luxurious comfort of the car and Walter's reassuring presence that made her feel quite safe.""Sunny Slopes, Sunny Slopes,"" Walter repeated thoughtfully. ""The name sounds rather familiar to me. I tell you what I'll do,"" he said, turning to Nan with sudden decision. ""Dad knows the names of nearly all the places through here. And if this Sunny Slopes is anywhere near Palm Beach we'll drive over in the car. How does that suit you?""""Goodness! I think Linda must be following us, too,"" Bess grumbled to Nan, looking blackly after their schoolmate as she walked haughtily down the car aisle. ""To look at her you would think she owned the world at least. Oh, if I could only prove that it was she who damaged the heating plant up at school, wouldn't it be a wonderful chance to get even with her?""""Come on back,"" the boy invited. ""Dad's got chairs for the whole crowd where we can get the finest view. But he said we had better grab 'em quick, because there's no knowing how long they will last in this crowd.""That would not have been so bad, had not Linda chosen to ignore the girls so pointedly, brushing past with her head held in the air and a manner which said very plainly, ""Who are those little specks of dust over there? Know them? Why, of course not!"" Finally Bess felt as though she could not stand it a moment longer.Perhaps it was just as well for all concerned that Linda stopped her bad-mannered performance shortly after that, for Bess could not have been restrained much longer. With this annoyance removed, they had opportunity to enjoy the ride to the full.Mr. Mason proved a very interesting companion, for he knew the names of the places they passed and told the girls funny stories about things that had happened in each one of them until they were tired out from the laughter.""I never knew there were so many resorts in the world,"" sighed Nan, leaning back lazily in her chair. ""The only place I really ever connected with Florida was Palm Beach. But it seems that is only one of about a million."""
"""Mr. Mason,"" spoke up Bess, with a wicked little look at Nan, ""is it true that most of the people who go to Palm Beach are either bald-headed millionaires or fussy women who just go there to show off their clothes?""""No, my dear,"" said the gentleman finally, a humorous twist in the corners of his mouth. ""I can't say that all the guests at Palm Beach are of the particular varieties you have mentioned. There are bald-headed millionaires, of course, and plenty of fussy, over-dressed women, but the people that I have mostly met in the hotels have struck me as being nice folks, very much like ourselves----""""I included the whole family,"" said Mr. Mason gravely. ""The millionaires,"" he went on, ""don't come to the hotels as a rule. They build themselves beautiful bungalows along the shore and take their recreation mostly in private clubs.""""Is that a hotel over there?"" asked Nan of Grace, as they allowed themselves to be swept on by the merry crowd. Bess and Rhoda were coming slowly along behind them. ""That immense yellow building with the green blinds?""""Oh, are we?"" asked Nan faintly, as she gazed up at the Royal Poinciana Hotel, which was six stories in height and seemed to cover several acres of ground. ""Goodness, it seems as if the whole world ought to be able to get in there. And what's that?"" she went on, pointing to another yellow building with green blinds. ""Its twin?""""Come ahead, folks,"" said Mr. Mason, engineering his flock up the steps of the hotel to the porch. ""Let's get cooled and brushed up a bit, and then we can come out and see the sights. This is the biggest crowd I have ever found here,"" he added, as they entered the darkened, cool lobby of the hotel with a conscious sigh of relief, ""and that is saying a good deal."" The signing of the hotel register was not an easy task, for there were many other guests waiting to do the same thing. Mr. Mason finally managed it, however, and he and his rather large family were whirled up in a roomy elevator to the fifth floor and were shown to their rooms by a well-mannered and friendly bellboy.Nan and Bess were delighted with their room, for it was large and airy and commanded a beautiful view of Lake Worth, upon which the Royal Poinciana Hotel is situated. Grace's and Rhoda's room also faced the lake.""The _Bargain Rush_ is down there somewhere,"" said Grace, as she and Nan ran across the room to peek over Bess's shoulder. ""Dad made an awful fuss about having it shipped all the way, but Walter said he didn't want to come if he couldn't have it.""""The ocean is in back of us, silly,"" Nan informed her. ""Didn't you notice the beautiful beach down there as we came along? There were people in bathing, too. Oh, don't I wish I could go in myself this very minute. Just think of it--surf bathing in February!"""
"Together with other girls and boys and men and women, all, like themselves, on pleasure bent, the girls made their way down to the lobby of the great hotel. Seeing nothing of Walter there, they rather timidly stepped out upon the veranda.The size of it made them gasp, and for a moment they just stood staring stupidly at the seemingly endless vista of chairs and tables and people--Nan and the others were sure there were millions of people.They might have stood there forever, had not Nan become suddenly aware of the admiring glances of several of the crowd that thronged the piazza. For the four modishly dressed girls formed a very pretty and striking picture.""So here you are,"" said the boy, his face lighting up with pleasure at the unexpected sight of the girls. ""Right this way, ladies. Say,"" he added, as they started down the steps together, ""you're looking great, girls. It isn't every fellow who has the chance to escort four pippins at Palm Beach.""There were the golf links between the two hotels, and men who ""looked old enough to know better,"" to quote Bess, were wandering over the velvet green sward with faithful caddies trailing along in the rear.""Look!"" cried Grace, a moment later, pointing to some beautiful level tennis courts where several animated sets of singles were in progress. ""You can't say we don't give you every kind of amusement here, Nan.""""It's wonderful,"" sighed Nan happily. ""I'm glad now that I thought to pack my racket before I started. My, how I would like to be out there now."" For Nan was a tennis enthusiast, and really could play the game well.They must have wandered on for a long time, for the sun was getting low when they finally turned to go back. They had passed ""cottages"" which must have cost their owners a small fortune to build and several small fortunes to maintain.""If you break in, Bess, you may get into trouble,"" said Walter, with a twinkle in his eye. ""What if several of the millionaires proposed to you at once? You wouldn't know which one to take, you know you wouldn't."" Nan played tennis with Walter the next day, and what is more, she beat him, four out of six. She declared later that it must have been either pure luck, or the fact that Walter was so dazed with surprise at finding that it was possible for a girl to beat him that he had given her two sets before he had recovered from the shock.The other girls were interested in the game also, although of the three, Grace was by far the best player. Lazy Bess much preferred reading a magazine on the immense piazza of the hotel to chasing a ball around in the hot sun.There were so many wonderful things to occupy their attention that a week flew by before they knew it. Almost without sensing it, the girls had drifted into the routine of gay activities that prevailed at the resort.There was usually a brisk walk before breakfast. That is, there was for Nan, Rhoda, Grace and Walter. Bess was often too tired after the gaiety of the day before to get up before breakfast to take anything so uninteresting as a walk."
"Then came breakfast, an event in itself, for the food was delicious, especially to such ravenous appetites as the girls and Walter brought back to it, and the beautiful dining-room of the hotel was a treat to the eye.After breakfast the majority of the guests sallied forth to the delights of motoring or sailing or tennis, while the others either lingered on the porch or sauntered over to the golf links to play a game of golf, or, if anglers, went out on a fishing excursion.Later in the morning, somewhere between eleven o'clock and noon, was the hour for bathing. Then all who cared to go in the water made a dash for the ocean, and had a cool, invigorating plunge before luncheon. This was the hour that Nan liked best of all.At night the girls loved to have dinner in the Garden Grill, for the place itself was a romantic dream of beauty with its palm trees and boxes of shrubs. And the music--the music carried them far away from the present on golden wings of melody and made them forget that there was anything sordid or unpleasant in all the world.Of course they met Linda Riggs occasionally. It would have been impossible for them not to have done so. But as the disagreeable girl continued consistently to ignore them, the chums just as consistently adopted the same attitude.They met several other girls of about their own age, and two of these girls had their brothers with them, and these youths had two chums along--so none of the girls wanted for partners when it came to dancing or playing tennis. In fact, sometimes they had ""more partners than were really needed,"" as Bess put it.One day all of them went for a horseback ride. This put Rhoda in her element, and, seated on a fine, spirited steed, the girl from Rose Ranch gave as fine an exhibition of horsemanship as had been seen at Palm Beach for a long time.""No such luck, I'm afraid,"" said the boy. ""But I'll ask her anyway,"" and he did, with the result that he and Rhoda went out half a dozen times, and the girl from Rose Ranch taught him many of her best riding tricks.""Let's go over and make sure,"" said Nan, and they started to skirt the floor, hugging the wall to escape the dancers, for the floor was already crowded with them. But when they reached the spot where Linda and her companion had been, the latter were gone, and, try as they would, the girls could not find them.They told Bess and Grace about it later, and they agreed that the incident looked queer, to say the least. However, they had so many things to think about in the days that followed, that Linda slipped entirely from their minds.One morning the girls decided to forego their usual game of tennis and take an early dip instead. Nan had complained of an ache in the muscles of her right arm, and as the trouble almost undoubtedly came from overstrain, Walter had insisted that she take ""a day off.""""Goodness!"" said Bess with a shiver, ""I think I will let you girls go in and I'll stay here. Experience has taught me that the beautiful green ocean about these parts isn't always as balmy and warm as it's reported to be.""""No, you don't,"" said Nan decidedly. ""You know very well it spoils all the fun if one of us backs out. Come on, Rhoda, you take the other arm. One--two--three--go!"" and Bess was hurried, half laughing and half angry and wholly protesting, down to the water's edge and promptly ducked under a foam-tipped, hungry, man-eating wave."
"The hour being so early, the girls had that particular portion of Old Man Ocean almost to themselves. There were a few early bathers, however, and among these was a man with a long, thin face and a mouth that was set in a hard, straight line.Nan, doing the crawl with her head under water, came up directly in front of this unpleasant-looking person and was so startled and surprised in consequence that she almost forgot to keep herself afloat.""Nan Sherwood, is it serious this time, or is this only another of your attacks?"" asked Bess impatiently. ""Here you are the one who dragged us into the water at this early hour, and now you want to spoil all the fun by breaking up the party. For goodness' sake, listen to reason,"" she wailed, as Nan, with a determined shake of her red-capped head, started in toward shore.As for Nan, she did not wait to see whether the girls were following her or not, but ran posthaste to her bathhouse, where she exchanged her bathing suit for more formal attire. Then she hurried on to the hotel.She had not seen this man since his arrival at Palm Beach, and the sudden appearance of his face so close to hers in the water had startled her horribly. Her first thought had been of the documents in her suitcase and her one desire to get to them as soon as possible.""Oh, what a fool I was not to give those papers to Mr. Mason, or have them placed in the hotel safe,"" she scolded to herself. She called herself several kinds of a goose as she ran down the quiet corridor to her room. As she stood before the door a slight noise within sent her heart suddenly into her mouth, and she hesitated before turning the knob.Then, with desperate courage, she flung the door wide and stepped into the room. Before her bed a tall, thin man was standing, and on the bed was a bag, her bag, partly open, with the contents showing!The voice held a frightened note, and its owner was evidently running along the corridor toward Nan's open door. The man said something under his breath, released Nan's wrists, and darted toward the window.Nan, conscious of a stabbing pain in her wrists, followed him, but not in time to stop his flight. She saw him disappear down the fire escape and then, with a little stifled sob, turned back into the room and found herself face to face with her startled chums. When Nan told her story to the Masons a little later they were not only indignant but very genuinely worried. Walter declared that he would ""catch that man and wring his neck before the day was up,"" which boast, though extremely extravagant, brought strange comfort to Nan, shocked as she had been by the events of the morning.""If that's the way you feel,"" Mr. Mason decided sympathetically, ""it seems to me the best thing to do is to get to Sunny Slopes as soon as possible, take a look at this land, and employ an attorney, if need be, to be sure her title is clear. Then if this man is illegally trying to wrest the land from its rightful owner, we will employ a detective and see that the fellow is brought to justice. I want to lift the load from these young shoulders,"" he said, looking down at Nan with the nice smile that made everybody like him. ""They are too young to carry the troubles of other people yet.""""But Dad,"" he said, turning to his father accusingly, ""you certainly can't mean that you are going to let that man wander around loose so that he can worry Nan all he wants to. Why, this is four or five times already that he has nearly frightened her to death. Why,"" he continued, waxing more excited as he thought about it and glaring at the anxious group of people as though it were in some way all their fault, ""he isn't going to stop when he so nearly got what he wanted to-day. He may come back again to-night----"""
"""That is very unlikely,"" Mr. Mason broke in, in a cheerful, matter-of-fact tone. ""He knows that we are on our guard now. For all he can tell, we may have detectives in every corridor and he will be very careful how he ventures near Nan's room to-night. No, he will try some other way since this one has failed. And in a day or two we will motor down to Sunny Slopes and relieve Nan's mind about this woman's property.""In spite of Mr. Mason's very reasonable conviction that the man would not return to Nan's room, the girls were nervous that night, especially Bess, and they were all glad when the sun, creeping in through the window, announced that another beautiful day had begun.They were to play a tennis match that day, Rhoda and Walter against Nan and Grace, and naturally they all had set their hearts upon winning. Bess had begged off on the ground that it was too warm to play.Nan struck weakly at the ball, which landed ignominiously in the net and then dropped her racket with a little cry of pain. The girls and Walter ran to her anxiously, Walter jumping the net and scooping up the ball as he came.""Oh-h!"" she said impulsively, ""that must be where the man grabbed me so tight yesterday. I'm dreadfully sorry to spoil your game,"" she added, thinking, as always, more of every one else than of herself.""I tell you what we'll do,"" said Walter, with sudden inspiration. ""We'll take some fishing tackle--Grace and I have enough to go round--and go out in the little old _Bargain Rush_ to a place I know of where the fish just come trotting up begging to be caught. How about it, girls? Are you on?""It seemed that they were, enthusiastically so, and half an hour later Grace was declaring that she was sorry about poor Nan's wrist, of course, but if this wasn't better than playing a hot game of tennis and probably getting beaten, her name wasn't Grace Mason, that's all.Walter was right about the fish--they seemed to enjoy being caught, and when, almost at noon time, they came back to the hotel with Walter bringing up the rear with the result of the morning's sport proudly displayed, strangers followed them with envious eyes and people they knew stopped them to ask where they had found the fish.As for Nan, she tried hard to enter into the old round of gaieties with her usual enthusiasm, for she knew that to show how worried she was would only spoil the fun of her friends. But to herself she acknowledged that she would not really be able to enjoy anything again until the mystery of those dangerous papers in her bag was finally cleared up and she was free from espionage once more.Walter seemed to be the only one who really understood her state of mind and when she pleaded a headache that afternoon and broke an engagement with the girls to go to the cocoanut grove for tea, it was Walter who silenced their protests and took her himself up to her room.""I'm awfully sorry about this,"" he said, taking the wrist, which had been rubbed with liniment and neatly bandaged by Mrs. Mason, in one of his sunburned hands and patting it awkwardly. ""Does it ache very much now?""""N-no. It doesn't ache at all,"" said Nan, adding quickly to cover her confusion as she drew her hand away, ""I think you had better go down to the girls now, Walter. They will think you've deserted them.""""Oh, well,"" said Bess, flouncing over to her closet and taking out a pretty white net and blue satin dress, ""I suppose you will have your own way, Nan. But one way or another, that old Mrs. Bragley and her miserable papers have just spoiled our trip. I wish she was in Jericho!"""
"They were standing in one corner of the veranda of the Royal Poinciana. The veranda looked strangely deserted that night, the dance being at its height in the ballroom within, and it being still a little early for the inevitable drifting of couples from the heat of the ballroom to the cool breezes of the porch.Nan thought so, too, and a moment later they were running hand in hand through the garden to the spot where the _Bargain Rush_ waited. They scrambled on board, Walter started the engine, and they drifted out into the magic stillness of the night.""Now tell me,"" said Walter after a while, his eyes shifting from the moonlit waters of the lake to Nan where she sat curled up in one of the chairs, gazing dreamily out over the shadowy water, ""isn't this better than dancing?""The unknown motorist was evidently amusing himself at the expense of those less daring than himself, and he raced up and down the lake several times. But soon a larger motor boat put out and bore down upon him.Nan and Walter continued their ride in the moonlight, and soon the unpleasant incident was forgotten. They talked of their good times at Palm Beach, and then the youth referred to what Nan proposed to do for Mrs. Bragley.""Yes. You see Bess and the others think I am so--so--well, so scared I can't keep them in my possession. Well,"" Nan drew a deep breath, ""I am scared. But, just the same, I'm not so scared as all that--and I'm going to prove it to them, so there!"" Mr. Mason, by inquiry, had found out that the district known as Sunny Slopes was about sixty miles from Palm Beach, and the next morning they set off by motor for the place, Mrs. Mason having declared to her husband the night before that ""it was of no use to put the thing off any longer. The girl's nerves were all on edge over that queer widow's mysterious papers. He may not have noticed it, but she had been watching Nan very closely.""So it came about that a big machine, carrying Mr. and Mrs. Mason, Nan and Bess and Rhoda, and enough luggage to last them at a hotel for a few days, and a torpedo-shaped little car bearing Walter and Grace set out bright and early to make the trip to Sunny Slopes.Walter had taken it for granted that Nan would ride with him, and had seemed inclined to sulk when she decidedly refused. For Nan had taken herself very severely to task when she had reached her room the night before. She had broken her rule never to go anywhere with Walter unless the girls were along, and she would never, never do it again. She was particularly hard on herself to-day--and on poor Walter--because of the fact that she had enjoyed that dreamlike sail over the moonlight waters of Lake Worth more than she had ever enjoyed anything before.They had made careful inquiries concerning the route, and once the houses and bungalows were left behind they ""hit it up"" to a very respectable rate of speed. The roads, for the most part, were very good, and the only spots covered where they had to be careful were where there had been washouts.They reached Sunny Slopes about noon, and decided--at least their ravenous appetites decided for them--that they had better have something to eat before they inquired further into the mystery of Mrs. Bragley's papers.Nan was the only one who seemed very much excited, and the others did not notice that the girl scarcely touched her lunch. It seemed an age to her before the meal was finished and Mr. Mason declared that they were ready to make their investigations.Nan and her friends would have been very much surprised had they known that they were being followed on their trip to Sunny Slopes, yet such was a fact. The two men who had tried so hard to gain possession of Sarah Bragley's documents were growing desperate.So now as they crowded out of the restaurant--it was the first one they had come to, and they had been too hungry to argue about its elegance or lack of it--and climbed into the cars again, Nan could hardly keep still in her eagerness to know the truth at once.""Sunny Slopes begins about a mile from here,"" said Mr. Mason. ""It covers quite a bit of territory, I am told. While one end is quite barren, the other end is excellent for orange growing and is covered with bearing trees."""
"""It surely is,"" Mr. Mason called back to her, adding in a voice that showed his rising excitement: ""Your widow's property ought to be somewhere in here, Nan. I think I'll stop the car and we can go forward on foot.""""Goodness!"" said Bess, as Grace and Walter drew up behind the big car and ran around and joined them, ""it looks as if they had all been drawn after the same pattern--the trees, I mean. Did you ever see anything so symmetrical in all your life?""It was the first time any of them, except the Masons, had been close to an orange grove, and they all went forward for a closer look at it. The grove was set quite a way back from the road and seemed to cover many acres of ground, stretching symmetrically back as far as the eye could see.From his examination of the documents carried by Nan, Mr. Mason had jotted down a number of facts and figures. Now the lawyer walked forward slowly and presently examined a number of stone markers he found set in the ground. Then he walked to a side road and read the signs thereon. A smile of satisfaction crossed his face.""These are most certainly the orange groves mentioned in her documents,"" he said gravely. ""How much of it she owns will have to be determined by an attorney. But I guess,"" he added, looking down at Nan with a kindly smile, ""that the property she holds here is worth a tidy sum, several thousand dollars at least. Of course the orange grove itself is worth a fortune.""Nan never afterward knew just how it happened, but some way or other, among the orange trees, she managed to get separated from the rest of the party. She was so engrossed with happy thoughts of the success of her plan to help Mrs. Bragley and so absorbed in imagining the woman's surprise and joy at the news she was about to receive that it was some time before she woke up to the fact that she was alone.The predicament--if indeed it was one--did not particularly worry her, for she knew that she could find her way back to the road easily enough and that there was no possibility in the world of her becoming really lost.As she stood reveling in the tropical beauty of the scene and smiling happily to herself, a thought suddenly flashed through her mind that banished the smile from her lips and brought an anxious frown to her brow.""Not so fast! Not so fast!"" said a voice beside her, and the next moment a man darted out from the shelter of the trees and stepped directly in her path. He was, as Nan knew the minute she heard his voice, the tall, thin man with the straight line for a mouth, with whom she had had so many unpleasant meetings before. His face showed a desperate expression.""None of that, my little lady,"" said the sneering voice. ""You are not going to get away from us this time until we get what we want. Just a little document or two is all we want. Quick now--hand it over.""Before Nan could move a soft, fat hand was pressed over her mouth from behind and she twisted about to find that her second captor was the short, fat man who had been the companion of her more dangerous enemy on the boat.""It won't do you any good to call names, Miss. You get those papers for us. And don't you dare to hand 'em to any of your friends either. If you do--well, you'll be sorry. We are out for those papers, and we are bound to have 'em."""
"A familiar shout roused Nan, and she sat up, pushing the hair back from her face, and instinctively straightened her dress. She picked up her hat, which had fallen off when she fell, and she pushed this down over her soft hair as she stumbled to her feet.This time she broke down completely and Walter ran to her, putting a protecting arm about her, glancing about him at the same time as if he hoped to see the men who had frightened her and wreak vengeance then and there.""You couldn't catch them--they have had too much of a start,"" she said. Then, with a shudder of remembrance, she drew herself from Walter's grasp and looked at him wildly. ""Walter!"" she cried. ""There are all our bags in the auto--Mrs. Bragley's papers--and those--those--beasts around loose! Oh--oh----"" Before she had finished she had started toward the road on a run with Walter in close pursuit.They met the rest of the anxious party on the way, but nothing less than an earthquake could have stopped Nan then. She waved to them and Walter shouted something unintelligible as he raced past, and they had nothing else to do but to follow the young lunatics--for that is what they called them.When Mr. and Mrs. Mason and the girls arrived at the spot where they had left their car they found Walter and Nan sitting on the running board and Nan holding something in her hand which she waved wildly at them.""So they gave you forty-eight hours, did they?"" asked Mr. Mason, his mouth tightening in a grim line. ""Well, I'll give them just twenty-four hours before they land in jail. Come on, let us get back to the town. I want to set some wheels in motion.""He and his son went back into the orange grove and there spent the best part of half an hour trying to get some trace of Nan's assailants. They found some footprints and followed these, but presently the marks were lost in crossing a brook.The girls plied Nan with questions on the way back, but she was too worn out with her terrible experience to answer them. The reaction was upon her, and all she wanted to do was crawl off in a corner somewhere and think things out.""I don't think Linda would have spoken to us, and I'm sure we weren't going to,"" Grace took up the story, ""but Cora stopped, and so Linda really had to. I imagine they are none too friendly from the way they acted to each other.""""It's strange we haven't seen Cora but once before if she has been with Linda all the time,"" Bess added excitedly, for this new development had evidently quite driven Nan's trouble from her mind. ""We've seen Linda innumerable times.""""Probably Linda has been making more of a lady's maid of Cora than usual,"" said Nan, putting a hand to her forehead, which was beginning to throb dully. ""And lady's maids aren't very often seen with their mistresses, you know.""For the short time he had been at work on the case he had made really remarkable strides. He had found out first of all, through an attorney in Sunny Slopes, that Mrs. Bragley's papers were perfectly legal and that she owned a sixth interest in the orange grove, which was worth a little over thirty thousand dollars. This gave the widow five thousand dollars--a veritable fortune to the poor woman."
"""I've made inquiries,"" said Mr. Mason significantly. ""And I've found out that people out here don't think very much of Mr. Jacob Pacomb and his business methods. I haven't the slightest doubt in the world,"" he added earnestly, ""but what Pacomb has been behind all these attempts to get the papers from you, Nan.""Bess, Grace and Rhoda slept well that night, for they were tired out with excitement, but Nan scarcely closed her eyes. Again and again the incidents of the day came vividly back to her and she would start up nervously at the slightest sound.""For goodness' sake, Nan Sherwood,"" Bess scolded, all the time hovering anxiously over her, ""I always said that that old woman's horrible papers would be the death of you, and from the way you look this morning I guess I'm a good prophet. Here we come to Florida for a good time, and look what we get!""Bess refused on the ground that she had to write some letters, but the other three said they would go. Mr. Mason had taken charge of Mrs. Bragley's papers, so that there was that much less for Nan to worry about. She was thankful for this, as she rather listlessly climbed into the back seat with Grace and Rhoda.Then an impish sprite of mischief whispered in her ear and her eyes danced merrily. On that chance meeting with Cora and Linda in the hall Cora had told her and Grace that they were staying in a suite of rooms on the third floor, and had asked them to come to see her and Linda.She heard voices raised in altercation within, and paused before knocking. Then she heard Nan's name spoken in Linda's unpleasant tones, and, quite unintentionally, she stood a moment playing eavesdropper.""I tell you, she is a thief!"" Linda was saying, in a voice that showed she was in one of her frequent rages. ""Nan Sherwood has been acting funny ever since she came to Palm Beach, and that's why I've followed her here to see what she is up to.""""Well, I'll tell you one thing,"" Cora shot back, and Bess was curiously reminded of the turning worm. ""I don't believe Nan Sherwood is any thief. I think she's a mighty nice girl. And every time I think of the mean trick you played on her, and how you nearly wrecked the school as well----""Mr. Riggs, who was not at all the pompous, conceited man that the girls at Lakeview Hall had come to think him, looked after Cora for a moment in surprise, then turned smilingly back to the two girls and asked Linda to introduce him to her friend.For one electric moment it looked as though Linda were about to refuse. Then what little common sense she had coming to her rescue, she sullenly did as she was bid and Mr. Riggs began to ask a few casual questions of Bess about how she liked Florida, if she had been there before, and other questions, which Bess answered mechanically. Her eyes were upon Linda as she stood at a window with her back to the room, her fingers beating a nervous tattoo on the windowsill.""Please, Bess,"" she begged, lowering her voice so that her father would not hear, ""don't tell on me! No one at Lakeview Hall knows that I--I did that. And no one will unless you tell them. Please, Bess!""When Mr. Mason came in that night they questioned him eagerly, but he had no real news to tell them. He had been able to prove nothing definite against Jacob Pacomb, and as yet had found no trace of the men who had so frightened Nan."
"And Nan, away down in her heart, was still frightened, there could be no doubt of that. The man had threatened her, had given her forty-eight hours to turn over the papers, and more than twenty-four hours of that time had already passed! If they did not succeed in tracing the scoundrels and handing them over to justice in the next twenty-four hours, what might not happen!Both Rhoda and Grace shared her uneasiness, and lazy Bess grumbled mightily at the loss of sleep consequent upon it. There is no doubt but what the girls would have rested a great deal easier that night had they known that a house detective, well paid for his services, kept watch outside Nan's door till dawn crept in at the windows.After breakfast they wandered into the lobby of the hotel to see if there was any mail for them. Nan had not heard from Papa Sherwood or Momsey for almost a week, and she was beginning to feel neglected indeed. If only she could have them with her now, to advise and help her in this predicament!""Here's a letter for you, Nan,"" Grace interrupted her rather unhappy thoughts. ""And here's another, with a Lakeview postmark. Must be from one of the girls at school. One for you, too, Rhoda. Looks like Procrastination's handwriting.""But Nan was already running across the lobby, unmindful of staring eyes, all her fear turned to anger at these men who dared appear in public after the cowardly attack they had made upon her. She darted in front of them and blocked their way, her eyes blazing and her body tense.The short, fat man started at sight of her and drew back. But black rage darkened his companion's face and he made a gesture as though to push Nan out of the way. He might have done it, too, and made his escape easily, for the curious people who had gathered in the lobby seemed paralyzed with amazement, had not Rhoda suddenly appeared at her chum's side, a little flame of white-hot indignation.""These girls are crazy,"" cried the tall man, turning furiously upon the newcomer, while his fat companion took out an immense silk handkerchief and nervously wiped his forehead. ""If you don't get them out of the way and lock them up, I'll sue your place----""Clear and startling, the voice rang out above the confusion, and the two men, without waiting to see who their new enemy was, made a dash for the open door, which was still only defended by Nan and Rhoda.For a moment, Nan and Rhoda, left outside of the circle around the men, could see nothing of what happened. But presently Mr. Mason--it was he who, coming suddenly upon the scene in the lobby, had demanded the arrest of the men--pushed his way through the crowd and beckoned to Nan. She went with him, and Rhoda followed close behind. Grace and Bess had already pushed their way into the crowd.The house detective, who had been in consultation with Mr. Mason when the thing happened, had taken the two men into custody. The tall, thin scoundrel, who had appeared in Nan's dreams for many restless nights, stood there sullenly, glowering around fiercely at the curious faces while his companion used his handkerchief more vehemently and seemed to be growing more nervous with every minute that passed.""Well,"" said the detective, turning grimly to his prisoners, while the crowd, not having the slightest idea what the commotion was about, but with a keen love of the dramatic, edged closer, ""I reckon the little lady's testimony is sufficient to send you two up for quite a little vacation.""""So you've turned stool pigeon, too, as well as crook?"" drawled the detective, while Nan and Mr. Mason exchanged a triumphant look. ""Yes, I reckon we do want Jacob Pacomb, too. We've been wanting him for a long while. But since this is the first chance we've had to get the goods on him, we won't waste any time doing it. Will one of you gentlemen call up the police station?"""
"But at the mention of the police station, the fat man broke down completely and, evidently nursing some false hope that by telling all he knew he might get off easy himself, he babbled unceasingly until the police patrol drew up before the door. His companion stood off by himself, with apparently no interest whatever in the proceedings.""Fine,"" said the detective, rising and patting the short man on the back as two policemen made their way into the lobby and saluted him. ""Now you can tell the rest of your story to the judge. Will you come with us, sir?"" he asked, turning to Mr. Mason as the policeman took the men in charge. ""We may need your testimony to round up Jacob Pacomb.""Nan smiled back at him, and then as the crowd, its curiosity satisfied, began to disperse, she sank down into one of the comfortable chairs and looked weakly up at her excited chums. Then for the first time she noticed Walter--and the fact that he was holding her hand.It was not till the girls were alone in their room that they remembered the unopened morning mail. Nan had been holding her letters tight in her hand through all the excitement. They opened them without much interest, for even letters could hardly hope to compete with the excitement of this morning.One of Nan's letters was from Momsey, and she put it away with a tender smile, for she always saved the best till the last. Then she opened the other letter, which was from Laura Polk, and immediately her indifference changed to interest.In the letter, which Nan read aloud, Laura recounted excitedly to Nan how Dr. Prescott had found that Linda was responsible for the wrecking of the steam plant and that Linda's father would undoubtedly be asked to pay the bill for repairs.""One of the servants saw Linda down there with some rope. She was taken sick and went home for a while, and did not know anything about the trouble at the school. But she is well now and ready to go back to her work, and in talking to Doctor Beulah the story came out.""It seemed that at the time he had sold the property to Mrs. Bragley's husband, Pacomb had made five other grants, and, now that the property had proved more valuable than he had hoped for, he was trying underhand means to recover it.The spirit did not move them for several days, however, for Sunny Slopes was a pretty place and the surrounding country beautiful. Also Nan had telegraphed the joyful news to Mrs. Bragley and, since she had given the address of the hotel where they were staying, she was eager to receive a letter in answer from the widow before they went back to the Royal Poinciana.At last the expected letter came from Mrs. Bragley, and the girls gathered around Nan eagerly as she read it aloud. One had only to read the first line to tell that the old woman was overjoyed at her good fortune. The letter fairly overflowed with gratitude to Nan for what she had done. ""It has lifted a weight from my shoulders, my dear, such as you will never know,"" the letter finished. ""At least I hope and pray that you may not. And if the time ever comes when you need help, don't be afraid to come to a lonely old woman, who will be proud and happy to pay back a little of the debt she owes you.""""That's worth every disagreeable thing we went through, isn't it, girls?"" Nan asked, looking up at them with shining eyes. ""Isn't it wonderful to be able to make somebody just a little bit happier because they have met you?"""
