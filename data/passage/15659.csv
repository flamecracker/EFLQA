passage
"In the ""Beacon Second Reader"" the author has chosen for his stories only those of recognized literary merit; and while it has been necessary to rearrange and sometimes rewrite them for the purpose of simplification, yet he has endeavored to retain the spirit which has served to endear these ancient tales to the children of all ages. The fairy story appeals particularly to children who are in the second school year. It has been proved by our ablest psychologists that at about this period of development, children are especially susceptible to the stimulus of the old folklore. They are in fact passing through the stage which corresponds to the dawn of the human race, when demons, dragons, fairies, and hobgoblins were as firmly believed in as rivers and mountains.As a test of this theory the author asked hundreds of second-grade and third-grade school children to recall the stories which they had read during the preceding year, and to express their preferences. The choice of more than ninety per cent proved to be either folklore stories, pure and simple, or such tales as contained the folklore element. To be sure, children like other stories, but they respond at once with sparkling eyes and animated voices when the fairy tale is suggested. How unwise, therefore, it is to neglect this powerful stimulus which lies ready at our hands! Even a pupil who is naturally slow will wade painfully and laboriously through a fairy story, while he would throw down in disgust an account of the sprouting of the bean or the mining of coal.It can hardly be questioned, moreover, that the real culture which the child derives from these literary classics is far greater than that which he would gain from the ""information"" stories so common in the average second and third readers.

Once a trap was baited With a piece of cheese; It tickled so a little mouse, It almost made him sneeze. An old rat said, ""There's danger, Be careful where you go!"" ""Nonsense!"" said the other, ""I don't think you know!"" So he walked in boldly-- Nobody in sight-- First he took a nibble, Then he took a bite; Close the trap together Snapped as quick as wink, Catching mousey fast there, 'Cause he didn't think. Once there was a robin, Lived outside the door, Who wanted to go inside And hop upon the floor. ""No, no,"" said the mother, ""You must stay with me; Little birds are safest Sitting in a tree."" ""I don't care,"" said Robin, And gave his tail a fling, ""I don't think the old folks Know quite everything."" Down he flew, and kitty seized him Before he'd time to blink; ""Oh,"" he cried, ""I'm sorry, But I didn't think."" Suppose, my little lady, Your doll should break her head, Could you make it whole by crying Till your eyes and nose are red? And wouldn't it be better far To treat it as a joke, And say you're glad 'twas Dolly's, And not your head that broke? Suppose you're dressed for walking, And the rain comes pouring down, Will it clear off any sooner Because you scold and frown? And wouldn't it be nicer For you to smile than pout, And so make sunshine in the house When there is none without? Suppose your task, my little man, Is very hard to get, Will it make it any easier For you to sit and fret? And wouldn't it be wiser Than waiting like a dunce, To go to work in earnest, And learn the thing at once?""You would be sad, too,"" said the cat, ""if you were in my place; for now that I am getting old and cannot catch mice, they wish to drown me. I have run away, but how I am going to live, I do not know."""
"What does little birdie say, In her nest at peep of day? Let me fly, says little birdie, Mother, let me fly away. Birdie, rest a little longer, Till the little wings are stronger. So she rests a little longer, Then she flies away. What does little baby say, In her bed at peep of day? Baby says, like little birdie, Let me rise and fly away. Baby, sleep a little longer, Till the little limbs are stronger. If she sleeps a little longer, Baby too shall fly away.""There is your spinning wheel, and here is the straw. If you do not spin all of it into gold by morning, your head shall be cut off. But if you do spin the gold, I will marry you and make you my queen.""Soon I came upon a little house, in front of which a fire was burning. Around this fire danced a little man. He wore a pointed cap, and had a long nose and bandy legs. As he went hopping and jumping about, first on one leg and then on the other, he sang: Over in the meadow, In the sand, in the sun, Lived an old mother toad And her little toadie one. ""Wink!"" said the mother; ""I wink,"" said the one; So she winked and she blinked In the sand, in the sun. Over in the meadow, Where the stream runs blue, Lived an old mother fish And her little fishes two. ""Swim!"" said the mother; ""We swim,"" said the two; So they swam and they leaped Where the stream runs blue. Over in the meadow, In a hole in a tree, Lived a mother bluebird And her little birdies three. ""Sing!"" said the mother; ""We sing,"" said the three; So they sang and were glad In the hole in the tree. Over in the meadow, In a snug beehive, Lived a mother honeybee And her little honeys five. ""Buzz!"" said the mother; ""We buzz,"" said the five; So they buzzed and they hummed In the snug beehive. Over in the meadow, Where the clear pools shine, Lived a green mother frog, And her little froggies nine. ""Croak!"" said the mother; ""We croak,"" said the nine; So they croaked and they splashed Where the clear pools shine."
"Over in the meadow, In a sly little den, Lived a gray mother spider And her little spiders ten. ""Spin!"" said the mother; ""We spin,"" said the ten; So they spun lace webs In their sly little den. Where are you going, you little pig? ""I'm leaving my mother, I'm growing so big."" So big, young pig! So young, so big! What! leaving your mother, you foolish young pig? Where are you going, you little pig? ""I've got a new spade, and I'm going to dig."" To dig, little pig! A little pig dig! Well, I never saw a pig with a spade, that could dig! Where are you going, you little pig? ""I'm going to have a nice ride in a gig."" In a gig, little pig! What! a pig in a gig! Well, I never yet saw a pig ride in a gig! Where are you going, you little pig? ""I'm going to the ball to dance a fine jig."" A jig, little pig! A pig dance a jig! Well, I never before saw a pig dance a jig! We took a saw and several nails, And water in the nursery pails; And Tom said, ""Let us also take An apple and a slice of cake,""-- Which was enough for Tom and me To go a-sailing on, till tea. I would call to the stars To keep out of the way, Lest we should rock over their toes; And then I would rock Till the dawn of the day, And see where the pretty moon goes. And there we would stay In the beautiful skies, And through the bright clouds we would roam; We would see the sun set, And see the sun rise, And on the next rainbow come home.At length an old man said, ""Men of Lintz, you know that the men of Andernach are lazy. They like to lie late in their beds. If we attack the city at sunrise, we shall capture it before they can get their eyes open."""
"While Margery (for that was her real name) was yet a little girl her father became very poor. He was so poor that at last he and Margery's mother and Margery and her little brother were all turned out of doors. They did not have a roof to cover their heads.Their sorrow would have made you pity them, but it would have done your heart good to see how fond they were of each other. They always went about hand in hand, and when you saw one you were sure to see the other.They were both very ragged, and though Tommy had two shoes, Margery had but one. They had nothing, poor little things, to live upon but what kind people gave to them. Each night they lay on the hay in just such a barn as you see here.Mr. Smith had a friend who was a very wealthy man. When he heard the story about Margery and Tommy, this man gave Mr. Smith some money to buy little Margery a new pair of shoes and Tommy a new suit of clothes. Can you see Tommy in the picture wearing his new clothes?The next morning the shoemaker came in with Margery's new shoes. She put them on in great glee and ran out to Mrs. Smith crying, ""Two shoes, two shoes. See goody two shoes!"" This she did to all the people she met, so that soon she was known far and wide as Goody Two Shoes.She then made the little tots spell words with her wooden letters. Take the word ""plum-pudding"" (and who can think of a better one!); the first little child picked up the letter p, the next l, the next u, the next m, and so on, until the whole word was spelled.The next place Margery came to was Gaffer Cook's house. Here a number of poor children all came around her at once. These children had been to her school longer than the first little tots, and could read words and lines.Some time after this a poor lamb had lost his mother, and the farmer was about to kill him. Margery bought him and took him home with her to play with the children. This lamb she called Will, and a pretty fellow he was. Do look at him. See him run and play with the children.Another gentleman, Sir Charles Jones, having heard of Margery's good sense, offered her a home if she would teach his daughter. In fact he finally fell in love with Margery, and they were married in the great church. And what do you think! On her wedding day, while the bells were ringing, Margery's brother Tommy came home. He had become the captain of a great ship. He had sailed to many lands, and he brought her all kinds of presents. Do you think she deserved to be very happy?"
"David looked at him without fear and said, ""You come against me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield, but I come to you in the name of the Lord. This day will he give you into my hand. I will kill you and take your head from you, and I will give the bodies of the Philistines to the birds and the beasts.""The earlier tables are introduced in order that the teacher may have them for rapid review work with her slower pupils, and also for those pupils entering the class without any previous phonetic training.felt tilt elm elk self kilt sick rich loft link silk lank test gilt dish
