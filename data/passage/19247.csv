passage
"Katie Clifford was a very bright child. She almost knew enough to keep out of fire and water, but not quite. She looked like other little girls, only so wise,--O, so very wise!--that you couldn't tell her any news about the earth, or the sun, moon, and stars, for she knew all about it ""byfore.""Her hair was soft and flying like corn-silk, and when the wind took it you would think it meant to blow it off like a dandelion top. She was so light and breezy, and so little for her age, that her father said ""they must put a cent in her pocket to keep her from flying away;"" so, after that, the family began to call her _Flyaway_. She thought it was her name, and that when people said ""Katie,"" it was a gentle way they had of scolding.Everybody petted her. Her brother Horace put his heart right under her feet, and she danced over it. Her ""uncle Eddard"" said ""she drove round the world in a little chariot, and all her friends were harnessed to it, only they didn't know it.""Her shoulders were very little, but they bore a crushing weight of care. From the time she began to talk, she took upon herself the burden of the whole family. When Mrs. Clifford had a headache, Flyaway was so full of pity that nothing could keep her from climbing upon the sufferer, stroking her face, and saying, ""O, my _dee_ mamma,"" or perhaps breaking the camphor bottle over her nose.She sat at table in a high chair beside her father, and might have learned good manners if it had not been for the care she felt of Horace. She could scarcely attend to her own little knife and fork, because she was so busy watching her brother. She wished to see for herself that he was sitting straight, and not leaning his elbows on the table. If he made any mistake she cried, ""Hollis!"" in a tone as sweet as a wind-harp, though she meant it to be terribly severe, adding to the effect by shaking the corn-silk on her head in high displeasure. If she could correct him she thought she had done as much good in the family as if she had behaved well herself. He received all rebukes very meekly, with a ""Thank you, little Topknot. What would be done here without you to preserve order?""It is strange to think of, but the first thing she really knew for a certainty, she was standing in a yellow chair, in her grandmother Parlin's kitchen! It was as if she had always been asleep till that minute. People did say she had once been a baby, but she could not recollect that, ""it was so MANY years ago.""Her mind, you see, had always been as soft as a bag of feathers; and nothing that she did, or that any one else did, made much impression. But now something remarkable was taking place, and she would never forget it.It was this: she was grinding coffee. How prettily it pattered down on the floor! What did it look like? O, like snuff, that people sneezed with. This was housework. Next thing they would ask her to wash dishes and set the table. She would grow larger and larger, and Gracie would grow littler and littler; and O, how nice it would be when she could do all the work, and Gracie had to sit in mamma's lap and be rocked!"
"While she stood musing thus, with a dreamy smile, and turning the handle of the mill as fast as it would go round, somebody sprang at her very unexpectedly. It was Ruth, the kitchen-girl. She seized Katie by the shoulders, carried her through the air, and set her on her feet in the sink.Katie had often heard about Job; she supposed it was something dreadful, like a lion, or a whale. She looked up at Ruth, and saw her black eyes flashing and the rosy color trembling in her cheeks. Cruel Ruth! She did not know Katie was her best friend, working and helping get dinner as fast as she could. ""Ruthie,"" sobbed she, ""you didn't ask please.""This was as harsh language as Katie dared use; but she frowned fearfully, and a tuft of hair, rising from her head like a waterspout, made her look so fierce that Ruth seemed to be frightened, and ran away with her apron up to her face.Mrs. Clifford sent for some fresh stockings and shoes. Her baby-daughter was so often falling into mischief that she thought very little about it. She did not know this was a remarkable occasion, and the baby had to-day begun to remember. She did not know that if Flyaway should live to be an old lady, she would sometimes say to her grandchildren,--""The very first thing I have any recollection of, dears, is grinding coffee in your great-grandmamma's kitchen at Willowbrook. The girl, Ruth Dillon, took me up by the shoulders, carried me through the air, and set me in the sink, and then I pumped water over myself.""But the next thing that really did happen to Miss Thistleblow Flyaway, though she went right off and forgot it, was this: She persuaded her mother to write a letter for her to ""Dotty Dimpwill."" As it was her first letter, I will copy it. ""There wasn't any _dead_ little kittens. She gave me a cookie, and I eated it, and I told her to give me another to bring home, 'cause I liked her cookies; they was curly cookies. [Got it wroted, mamma?] The little Parlins came the next week. One Sunday morning Dotty Dimple stood before the glass, putting on her hat for church. Katie came and peeped in with her, opening her small mouth and drawing her lips over her teeth, as her grandfather did when he shaved.Strange such an innocent-looking child could be so sly! She ran down the path with Horace, kissing her little hand to everybody for good by, all the while thinking how she could steal off to church without being seen.""My dee gamma, I so solly you's sick!"" said she, stroking Mrs. Parlin's face, and picking open her eyelids. But after patting and ""pooring"" the dear lady for some time, she thought she had made her ""all well,"" and then was anxious to get away. Mrs. Parlin wished to keep her up stairs as long as possible, because Ruth had a toothache.Grandma smiled, and wondered if people, in the good old Bible days, were in the habit of using pet names, and if Pharaoh's daughter ever called the Hebrew boy ""Mosey."" She was about to begin another story, when Flyaway said, ""Guess I'll go out, now,"" and slid off the bed. There was an orange on the table. She took it, held it behind her, and walked quickly to the door. Looking back, she saw that her grandmother was watching her."
"Down stairs she pattered. The moment Ruth had kissed her, and turned away to make a poultice, she crept into the nursery, and put on Horace's straw hat. Then she took from a corner an old cane of her grandfather's, and from the paper-rack a daily newspaper, and started out in great glee. The ""Journal"" she hugged to her heart, and her short dress she held up to her waist, ""'Cause I s'pect I mus' keep it out o' the mud,"" said she, as anxiously as any lady with a train.""Naughty fing! Wisht I hadn't took you, to-day, you act so bad!"" said she, picking herself up for the fifth time, and slinging the ""naughty fing"" across her shoulder like a gun. When she came to the meeting-house there was not a soul to be seen. ""Guess they's eatin' dinner in here,"" decided Flyaway, after looking about for a few seconds. ""Guess I'll go up chamer, see where the folks is.""Up stairs she clattered, hitting the balusters with her cane. Good Mr. Lee was preaching from the text, ""Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,"" and people could not imagine who was naughty enough to make such a noise outside--thump, thump, thump.She trembled, and was about to run away with her newspaper and cane; but her eyes, in roving wildly about, fell upon grandpa Parlin and all the rest of them, in a pew very near the pulpit. Then she thought it must be all right, and, taking courage, she marched slowly up the aisle, swinging the cane right and left.Everybody looked up in surprise as the droll little figure crept by. Grandpa frowned through his spectacles, and aunt Louise shook her head; but Horace hid his face in a hymn-book and Dotty Dimple actually smiled.She longed to take up the morsel of naughtiness, called Katie, in her thumb and finger, shake it, and carry it out. But there was a twinkle in the little one's eye that might mean mischief; she did not dare touch her.Aunt Louise was sadly mortified, and so were Susy and Prudy. They dared not look up, for they thought everybody was gazing straight at the Parlin pew, and laughing at their crazy little relative. Horace and Dotty Dimple did not care in the least; they thought it very funny.""Yes um, I will,"" replied poor brow-beaten Flyaway, and held up her head again with the best of them. Perhaps she had been naughty; perhaps folks were going to snip her fingers; but ""Hollis"" was on her side now and forever. She began to feel quite contented. She had got inside the church at last, and was very well pleased with it. It was even queerer than she had expected.""Great red curtains ahind him,"" added she, still conversing with her own little brain. ""Lots o' great big bubbles on the walls all round. Big's a tea-kiddle! Lamps, I s'pose. There's that table. Where's the cups and saucers for the supper? And the tea-pot?"
"""All the bodies everywhere had their bonnets on; why for? Didn't say a word, and the prayer-man kep' a-talkin' all the time; why for? Flywer didn't talk; no indeed. Folks mus'n't. If folks did, then the man would come down out the chimley and tell the other bodies to carry 'em home. 'Cause it's the holy Sabber-day,--and _that's_ what is it.""Flyaway's airy brain went dancing round and round. She slid away from Horace's shoulder, spread her little length upon the seat, closed her wondering, tired eyes, and sailed off to Noddle's Island. A fly, buzzing in from out doors, had long been trying to settle on Flyaway's restless nose. He never did settle: Horace kept guard with a palm-leaf fan, and ""all the other bodies"" in the pew sat as still as if they had been nailed down; so anxious were they to keep the little sleeper safely harbored at Noddle's Island.""Yes, um,"" replied the little culprit, with her mouth full, and feeling very brave as long as the door was shut between her and her jailer. ""Yes, um, I've thought it all up,--defful solly. _But_ you won't never shut me up no more, gamma Parlin!"" About ten o'clock one morning, Flyaway was sitting in the little green chamber with Dotty Dimple and Jennie Vance, bathing her doll's feet in a glass of water. Dinah had a dreadful headache, and her forehead was bandaged with a red ribbon.""The Charlie boy likes canny seeds; I'll send him some,"" said she, pinning a paper of sugared spices to the window curtain, and drawing it up by means of the tassel. ""O, dear, um don't go high enough. Charlie won't get 'em.""""Why, I shouldn't think, now, 'twas any larger than the head of a pin,"" said Dotty, with decision; ""s'poses heaven is top o' this room! Why, Jennie Vance, I _persume_ it's ever so much further off 'n Mount Blue--don't you?""Flyaway turned round with one of her wise looks. She thought she did understand; at any rate she was catching every word, and stowing it away in her little bit of a brain for safe keeping. Heaven was on Mount Blue. She had learned so much.Her little heart was ready to bleed; and this wasn't the first time, either. Those great big girls were always running away from her, and calling her ""goosies"" and ""snips;"" and now they meant to climb to heaven, where Charlie was, and leave her behind.""But I won't stay down here in this place; I'll go to heaven too, now, _cerdily_!"" She sprang from the pillow and stood on one foot, like a strong-minded little robin that will not be trifled with by a worm. ""I'll go too, now, cerdily.""Having made up her mind, she hurried as fast as she could, and tucked a stick of candy in her pocket, also the bottle of soap suds, and two thirds of a ""curly cookie"" shaped like a leaf. ""Charlie would be so glad to see Fly-wer!"" She purred like a contented kitten as she thought about it. ""'Haps they've got a _bossy-cat_ up there, and a piggy, and a swing. O, my shole!"""
"For she fancied somebody standing at the door of heaven holding out his hand like the ticket-man at the depot. She found her mother's purse in the writing-desk, and scattered its contents into the wash-bowl, then picked out the wettest ""skipt,"" a five-dollar bill, and tucked it into her bosom. This would make it all right at the door of heaven.""Now my spetty-curls,"" she added, hunting in the ""uppest drawer"" till she found the eyeless spectacles used for playing ""old lady."" With these on, Flyaway thought she could see the way a great deal better. Horace's boots would help her up hill; so she jumped into those, and clattered down the back stairs with Dinah under her arm.There was nobody in the kitchen, for Ruthie was down cellar sweeping. Flyaway caught her shaker off the ""short nail,"" and stole out without being seen. Sitting in the sun on the piazza was the ""blue"" kittie. ""Finkin' 'bout a mouse, I spect,"" said little Flyaway, seizing her and blowing open her eyes like a couple of rosebuds.""Um's on the toppest hill,"" said she, looking at the far-off mountains, reaching up against the blue sky. One mountain was much higher than the others, and on that she fixed her eye. It was Mount Blue, and was really twenty miles away. If Flyaway should ever reach that cloud-capped peak, it was not her wee, wee feet which would carry her there. But the baby had no idea of distances. She went out of the yard as fast as the big boots would allow. She felt as brave as a little fly trying to walk the whole length of the Chinese Wall.Dinah did not care anything about the family feelings of the ""worms;"" so she kept her red silk mouth shut; but she grew very heavy--so heavy, indeed, that once her little mother dropped her in the sand, but picking her up, shook her and trudged on. Presently she dropped something else, and this time it was the kitty. Flyaway turned about in dismay.""Um won't walk,"" said she; but, before she had time to pull off the second one, a dog came along and frightened her so she tried to run, though she only hopped on one foot, and dragged the other. She did not know what the matter was till she fell down and the boot came off of itself, after which she could walk very well. What cared she that both ""Hollis's"" new boots were left in the road, ready to be crushed by wagon wheels?Sometimes she remembered she was going to heaven, and sometimes she forgot it. She was on the way to the ""Pines,"" and many little flowers grew by the road-side. She began to pick a few, but the thorns on the raspberry bushes tore her tender hands, and one of the naughty branches caught Dinah by the frizzly hair, and carried her under. What did Flyaway spy behind the bushes? Dotty Dimple and Jennie Vance. They were eating wintergreen leaves; they did not see her. Flyaway kept as still as if she were sitting for a photograph, picked up Dinah, gave her a hug, and crept on."
"She went so quietly that nobody heard her. When she was out of sight she purred for joy. She had got ahead of the girls on the way to heaven! She took the stick of candy out of her pocket and nibbled it to celebrate the occasion. ""A little hump-backed bumblebee"" saw her do it. He wanted some too, and followed Flyaway as if she had been a moving honeysuckle. For half a mile or more she ""gaed"" and she ""gaed,"" all the while nibbling the candy; but now she was growing very tired, and did it to comfort herself. Suddenly she remembered it was Charlie's candy. She held it up to her tearful eyes.The hungry bumblebee, who was just behind her, thought this was his last chance: so he pounced down upon Charlie's candy; and being cross, and not knowing Flyaway from any other little girl, he stung her on the thumb. Then how she cried, ""'Orny 'ting me! 'Orny 'ting me!"" for she had been treated just so before by a hornet. ""O my dee mamma! My dee mamma!"" It now occurred to little Flyaway, with a sudden pang, that she must have come to the end of the world. ""Yes, cerdily!"" The world was full of folks and houses,--this place was nothing but trees. The world had horses and wagons in it,--this place hadn't. ""O dee!""Where was the hill gone, on the top of which stood that big house they called heaven,--the house where Charlie lived and played in the garden? Why, that hill had just walked off, and the house too! She parted the bushes and peeped through. Nothing to be seen but trees. Flyaway began to cry from sheer fright, as well as pain. ""'Tis a defful day! I can't _stay_ in this day!""More trouble had come to her than she knew how to bear; but worst of all was the cruel stab of the bumblebee. She pitied her aching ""fum,"" and kissed it herself to make it feel better; but all in vain; ""the pain kept on and on;"" the ""fum"" grew big as fast as the candy had grown little.She was dreadfully hungry. ""When _was_ it be dinner time?"" She would not have been in the least surprised, but very much pleased, if a bird had flown down with a plate of roast lamb in his bill, and set it on the ground before her. Simple little Flyaway! Or if her far-away mother had sprung out from behind a tree with a bed in her arms, the tired baby would have jumped into the bed and asked no questions."
"Some one had come for her. Perhaps it was Charlie, and they meant to give her a ride up to heaven. A flash of light, and then another crash. Flyaway understood it then. It was logs. People were rolling logs up in the sky, on the blue floor. She had seen logs in a mill. Such a noise!Then she dropped fast asleep, and somebody came right down out of the clouds and gave her a peach turnover as big as a dinner basket, or so she thought. Just as she was about to cut it, she was awakened by the rain dripping into her eyes. She started up, exclaiming, ""If you pees um, I want some cheese um.""""O, Diny,"" sobbed she, turning to her unfeeling dolly for sympathy. ""I's free years old, and you's one years old. Don't you want to go to heaven, Diny, and sit in God's lap? What a great big lap he must have!""After a while the clouds had poured out all the rain there was in them, and left the sky as clear as it was before; but by that time the sun had gone to bed, and the little birds too, sending out their good nights from tree to tree. Then the new moon came, and peeped over the shoulder of a hill at Flyaway. She sprang out from the bushes like a rabbit.Now you may be sure all this could not happen without causing great alarm at grandpa Parlin's. When the dinner bell rang, everybody asked, twice over, ""Why, where is little Fly?"" and Dotty Dimple answered, as innocently as if it were none of her affairs,--Grandma held up a warning finger. ""I declare,"" said aunt Louise, very much agitated, ""I never shall consent to have Maria go out of town again, and leave Katie with us. If she will try to swim in the watering-trough, she is just as likely to take a walk on the ridgepole of the house.""Horace darted out of the room with a ghastly face, but came back looking relieved. He had been up in the attic, and climbed through the scuttle, without finding any human Fly on the roof, or on the dizzy tops of the chimneys, either.No; the last that could be remembered, she had been playing by herself in the green chamber, soaking Dinah's feet in a glass of water. The ""blue kitty,"" the only creature who had anything to tell, sat washing her face on the kitchen hearth, and yawning sleepily. Fly's shaker was gone from the ""short nail,"" and aunt Louise discovered some bank-bills in a wash-bowl,--""Fly's work, of course."" But this was all they knew."
"""I always thought there would be a last time,"" said poor Mrs. Dr. Gray, putting on her black bonnet, and joining Grace and Susy. ""That child seems to me like a little spirit, or a fairy, and I never thought she would live long. She and Charlie were too lovely for this world.""But aunt Martha had not seen her, nor had any one else. Horace and Abner went up to the Pines, but the forest beyond they never thought of exploring; it did not seem probable that such a small child could have strolled to such a distance as that.""There's one thing we haven't thought of,"" said Abner, shaking the drops from his hat and looking up at the sky, which had cleared again; ""we haven't thought of the railroad surveyors! They are round the town everywhere with their compasses and spy-glasses.""""I wish I had known before there was a child missing,"" he said. ""I saw the figure of a little girl, through my glass, not an hour ago. It was a long way beyond the Pines, and I wondered how such a baby happened up there; but I had so much else to think of that it passed out of my mind.""""Didn't yun away; I's goin' up to heaven see Charlie,"" replied Flyaway, suddenly remembering the object of her journey, and gazing around at Abner, Dr. Gray, and the other people, with eyes full of wonder. ""Where's the toppest hill? I's goin' up, carry Charlie some canny.""Flyaway was too tired to ask any more questions. She let first one person carry her, and then another, sometimes holding up her swollen thumb, and murmuring, ""'Orny 'ting me--tell my mamma."" And after that she was asleep again.Dotty Dimple, Susy, and Prudy were pacing the piazza when the party arrived, but poor grandma was on the sofa in the parlor, quite overcome with anxiety and fatigue, and Miss Polly Whiting was mournfully fanning her with a black feather fan. The sound of voices roused Mrs. Parlin. ""Safe! safe!"" was the cry. Dotty Dimple rushed in, shouting, ""A railroad savage found her! a railroad savage found her!""In another moment the runaway was in her grandmother's lap. All she could say was, ""'Orny 'ting me on my fum! 'Orny 'ting me on my fum!"" For this one little bite of a bee seemed greater to Flyaway Clifford than all the dangers she had passed. If grandma would only kiss her ""fum,"" it was no matter about going to heaven, or even being undressed.But after she had had a bowl of bread and milk, and been nicely bathed, she forgot her sufferings, and laughed in her sleep. She was dreaming how Charlie came to the door of heaven and helped her up the steps."
"A whole year passed. Dotty Dimple became a school-girl, with a ""bosom friend"" and a pearl ring. Prudy, who called herself ""the middle-aged sister,"" grew tall and slender. Katie was four years old, and just a little heavier, so she no longer needed a cent in her pocket to keep her from blowing away.""O, you cunning little cousin!"" said Dotty, embracing her rapturously; ""I wish you loved me half as well as I love you; that's what I wish. I told Tate Penny you were prettier than Tid; and so you are. Such red cheeks! But what makes one cheek redder than the other?""Abner laughed in his hearty fashion. ""Some of the old mischief left there yet,"" said he, catching Flyaway and tossing her to the ceiling. ""Have you come here this summer to keep the whole house in commotion? Remember the Charlie boy--don't you--that had the meal-bags tied to his feet?""""So you did, surely,"" said a woman who had just come in at the back door, and begun to drop kisses, as sad as tears, on Flyaway's forehead. ""Do you know who this is?"" Flyaway looked up with a sweet smile, but her mind had lost all impression of her melancholy friend, Miss Whiting. ""Look again,"" said the sad-eyed stranger, who did not like to have even a little child forget her; ""you used to call me the 'Polly woman.'""Miss Polly laughed drearily. ""So you don't remember how I took you out of the watering-trough, you sweet lamb! 'I's tryin' to swim,' you said; 'and _that's_ what is it.' Here's a summer-sweeting for you, dear; do you like them?""At the same time she allowed herself to be taken in Miss Polly's lap, and won that tender-hearted woman's love by putting her arms round her neck, and saying, ""Let me kiss you so you'll feel all better. What makes you have tears in your eyes?--tell me.""""We're good friends--I knew we should be,"" said Miss Polly, quite cheerily. ""Look out of the window, and see that swing. How many times I've pushed you and Dotty in that swing when it seemed as if it would break my back!""""There,"" said she, ""I've dropped a stitch in my side; it never agrees with me to laugh. I must be going right home, too; but there is one thing more I want to ask you, Katie; do you remember how you ran away, one day, and frightened the whole house, trying to climb up to heaven?""""O, now I 'member,"" said Katie, suddenly. ""I 'member the bee as plain as 'tever 'twas!"" And she curled her lip with contempt for that small Flyaway, of long ago--that silly baby who had thought heaven was on a hill."
"""Don't you call that small, right under my hand a-beatin'?"" said she. ""'Bout's big as a bird, Miss Polly. Little round ball for a head, little mites o' eyes; but you won't care--you can see _just_ as well.""""Didn't you know it?"" cried Katie, finding she had startled Miss Polly. ""Didn't you know you's goin' to be little, and fly in the air just so?"" throwing up her arms. ""I want to go dreffully, for there's a gold harp o' music up there, and I'll play on it: it'll be mine.""""Hush!"" said Miss Polly, gravely; ""you shouldn't joke upon such serious subjects. Good by, children. Your house is full of company, and I didn't come to stay. Here's a bag of thoroughwort I've been picking for your grandmother; you may give it to her with my love, and tell her my side is worse. I shall be in to-morrow.""""O, O,"" cried Grace, dropping her knife and fork, and patting her hands softly under the table, ""isn't it so nice to be at Willowbrook again, taking supper together? Doesn't it remind you of pleasant things, Susy, to eat grandma's cream toast?""It had been Mrs. Parlin's custom, once or twice every summer, to allow the children to take the large, heavy rag-bag to the store, and sell its contents for little articles, which they divided among themselves. Sometimes the price of the rags amounted to half or three quarters of a dollar, and there was a regular carnival of figs, candy, and fire-crackers.""Yes, to be sure,"" replied Susy, faintly, though not without a pang, for she still retained a childish fondness for jujube paste, and was not allowed a great abundance of pocket-money. ""Yes, to be sure, let the _little_ girls have our share.""""Yes, grandma,"" said Dotty, twisting her front hair joyfully; ""but here in the country they want little girls to have good times--don't they? Why don't everybody move into the country, do you s'pose? Lots of bare spots round here,--nothing on 'em but cows.""When Dotty returned with the spectacles, Jennie Vance came with her, pouting a little at the cool reception she had met, and thinking Miss Dimple hardly polite because she was too much interested in an old rag-bag to pay proper attention to visitors.Dotty caught her grandmother's arm. ""Please, grandma, don't sweep 'em into the bag; let us look some more. I've just found a big Lisle glove; if I can find another, then Abner can go blackberrying; he says his hands are ever so tender.""Flyaway, having climbed upon the table, had rolled herself into some mosquito netting, like a caterpillar in a cocoon. They were all so much interested, that grandma, in the kindness of her heart, did not like to disturb them."
"A sudden idea came to Jennie. Whose money was this? Mrs. Parlin's? No; hadn't Mrs. Parlin looked over the rags once, and said the children might have what was left? ""'You are welcome to all the treasures you can find;' that was what she said,"" repeated Jennie to herself. ""I'm the one that found this treasure,--not Dotty, not Flyaway. This is honest, and I do not lie when I say it.""Jennie began to tremble, and a hot color flew into her cheeks, and added new lustre to her black eyes. ""If I could only make Flyaway forget it,"" thought she, with a whirling sensation of anger towards the innocent child, who knew no better than to proclaim aloud every piece of news she heard. ""I'll make her forget it."" Jenny hastily concealed the money in the neck of her dress.""Can't Hollis come, 'thout me watching him?"" returned Flyaway, winking slowly again, for her sweet little soul was stirred with wrath. The memory of the ""skipt"" had indeed been driven away, and she could only think,--And Jennie was thinking, ""She never'll remember the money now, or, if she does, I don't believe Mrs. Parlin will pay any attention to what she says."" Jennie was still very much excited, and wondered why she trembled so.""I don't mean to keep it unless it's perfectly proper,"" thought she; ""I guess I know the eighth commandment fast enough. I shan't keep it unless Dotty thinks best. I'll tell her, and see what she says.""""O, you needn't preach to me. You wasn't the one that found it. If I'd truly been a thief, or if I hadn't been a thief, it would have been right for me to keep it, and perfectly proper, and not said a word to you, either; so there.""""Of course I did. Wouldn't it surprise her, when she wasn't expecting it? And Flyaway, too,--something for her. We wouldn't keep anything for ourselves, only just enough to buy clothes and such things as we really need."" Flyaway had only been climbing the outside of the staircase, and would have done very well, if some one had not rung the door-bell, and startled her so that she fell from the very top stair to the floor. It was feared, at first, that several bones were broken and her intellect injured for life; but after crying fifteen minutes, she seemed to feel nearly as well as before.The person who rang the door-bell was Mrs. Vance's girl Susan, who called for Jennie to go home and try on a frock. Jennie did not return, and Dotty had a sense of uneasiness all day. The guilty secret of the three dollars weighed upon her mind. Should she, or should she not, tell her grandmother?"
"""I don't know but Jennie would do something to my things if I told,"" thought she; ""but then I never promised a word. Here it is four o'clock. Who knows but she's gone and spent that money, and my grandmother never'll know what's 'come of it?""This possibility was very alarming. ""Jennie Vance doesn't seem to have any little whisper inside of _her_ heart, that ticks like a watch; but _I_ have. _My_ conscience pricks; so I know that perhaps it's my duty to go and tell.""Dotty drew herself up virtuously and looked in the glass. There she seemed to see an angelic little girl, whose only wish was to do just right--a little girl as much purer than Jennie Vance, as a lily is purer than a very ugly toadstool.Well, Miss Dotty, there is some truth in the picture. Jennie is not a good child; but neither are you an angel. There is more wickedness in your proud little heart than you will ever begin to find out. And wait a minute. Who teaches you all you know of right and wrong? Is it your mother? Suppose she had died, as did Jennie's mamma, when you were a toddling baby?""Yes'm,"" replied Dotty, trying to read her grandmother's face, and feeling a little alarmed by its solemnity. ""What you going to do, grandma? Not put Jennie in the lockup--are you? 'Cause if you do--O, don't you! She said 'twas her sharp eyes, and she didn't mean to steal, and 'twasn't your pockets, and she promised she'd give me half--yes, she truly did, grandma.""Then Mrs. Parlin folded the sheet she was making, put on her best shawl and bonnet, and kid gloves, and taking her sun umbrella, set out for a walk. There was a look in her face which made her little granddaughter think it would not be proper to ask any questions.While Jennie, with the kind assistance of Prudy, was hunting for Dotty, Mrs. Parlin was in Judge Vance's parlor, talking with Jennie's step-mother. Mrs. Vance was shocked to hear of her daughter's conduct, for she loved her and wished her to do right.""I know just what sort of training Jennie has had from Serena Pond,"" said Mrs. Parlin; ""it was most unfortunate. But you are so faithful with her, my dear Mrs. Vance, that I do believe she will outgrow all those early influences.""""I keep hoping so,"" said Mrs. Vance, repressing a sigh; ""I take it very kindly of you, Mrs. Parlin, that you should come to me with this affair. I shall not allow Jennie to go to your house very often. You do not like to wound my feelings, but I am sure you cannot wish to have your little granddaughter very intimate with a child who is sly and untruthful.""""My dear lady,"" said grandma Parlin, taking Mrs. Vance's hand, and pressing it warmly; ""since we are talking so freely together, and I know you are too generous to be offended, I will confess to you that if Jennie persists in concealing this money, I would prefer not to have Dotty play with her very much; at least while her mother is not here to have the care of her."" It was hard for Mrs. Parlin to say this, and she added presently,--"
"Wretched little Jennie! The new blue and white frock, just finished by her dress-maker, covered a heart filled with mortification. Dotty Dimple would not talk to her. It seemed as if Dotty had climbed to the top of a high mountain, and was looking down, down upon her.Dotty did feel very exalted to-day; but there was another reason why she would not talk with Jennie: she might have to confess that grandma knew about the money; and then what a scene there would be! So Dotty set her lips together, and sewed as if she was afraid somebody would freeze to death before she could finish her patchwork quilt.Mrs. Clifford, who did not understand the cause of Dotty's lofty mood, took pity on Jennie, and tried to amuse her. After a while, Dotty came softly along, and sat down close to her aunt Maria, ready to listen to the story of the ""Pappoose,"" though she had heard it fifty times before.""I don't know, ma'am, I'm sure,"" replied Jennie, looking hard at the sofa. She longed to make an open confession, and get rid of the troublesome money, but had not the courage to do it without some help from Dotty.But Dotty continued as unapproachable as the Pope of Rome. Eight o'clock came, and the two unhappy little girls went slowly up stairs to bed. Dotty, in her lofty pride, tried to make her little friend feel herself a sinner; while Jennie, ready to hide herself in the potato-bin for shame, was, at the same time, very angry with the self-satisfied Miss Dimple. She was awed by her superior goodness, but did not love her any the better for it. Why should she? Dotty's goodness lackedThe money lay on the floor, and neither of the proud girls would pick it up. Jennie, who always prayed at her mother's knee, forgot her prayer to-night, and climbed into bed without it. But Dotty, feeling more than ever how much better she was than her little friend, knelt beside a chair, and prayed in a loud voice. First, she repeated the ""Lord's Prayer,"" then ""Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,"" and ""Now I lay me down to sleep."" She was not talking to her heavenly Father, but to Jennie, and ended her petitions thus:-- ""The wickedest girl in this town!"" Jennie's eyes flashed in the dark like a couple of fireflies. At first she was too angry to speak; and when words did come, they were too weak. She wanted words that were so strong, and bitter, and fierce, that they would make Dotty quail. But all she could say was,--Dotty made no reply, but rolled over to the front of the bed, and Jennie pushed herself to the back of it. There the little creatures lay in silence, each on an edge of the bedstead, and a whole mattress between. Sleep did not come at once.About nine o'clock grandma Parlin came quietly into the room with a lamp. A smile crept round the corners of her mouth, as she saw the little girls sleeping so widely apart, their faces turned away from each other."
"The light awoke Jennie, who had only just fallen asleep. ""Now is the time,"" said she to herself; and without waiting for a second thought, which would have been a worse one, she sprang out of bed, and caught Mrs. Parlin by the skirts.""That money is yours, Mrs. Parlin,"" said she, bravely. ""Yours; I found it in the rag-bag. Something naughty came into me this morning, and made me want to keep it; but I'm ever so sorry, and never'll do it again. Will you forgive me?""Then grandma Parlin seated herself in a rocking-chair, took Jennie right into her lap, and talked to her a long while in the sweetest way. Jennie curled her head into the good woman's neck, and sobbed out all her wretchedness.""She knew she _was_ worse than Dotty, though. She wished,--O, dear, as true as she lived,--she wished she was dead and buried, and drowned in the Red Sea, and the grass over her grave, and shut up in jail, and everything else.""""No 'm,"" Jennie said; ""it wasn't right to take fruit-cake without leave, or tell wrong stories either; she wouldn't any more. Yes'm, she would try to be good--she never had tried much.--Yes 'm, she would ask God to help her. Should you suppose He would do it?""Yes 'm, she would ask Him not to let her have much temptation. She did believe she would rather be a good girl--a real good girl, like Prudy, _not like Dotty_!--than to have a velvet dress with spangles all over it.""Step by step Dotty came down from the mountain-top, and, before breakfast was ready, had led her visitor through the morning dew to the playhouse under the trees, chatting all the way as if nothing had happened.""I'm ashamed of it now,"" said Abner to Ruth, ""though I didn't tell anybody but you. I wish you'd mix a pitcher of sweetened water, and let me take it out to the field to old Daniel. I feel as if I wanted to make it up to him some way.""Ruth laughed; and when Abner came into the house at ten o'clock, she had a pitcher of molasses and water ready for him, also a plate of cherry turnovers. Flyaway insisted upon toddling over the ground with one of the turnovers in her apron.Flyaway said no more, but she pressed her eyelids together again, and felt that she had been trifled with. Half an hour afterwards Prudy heard her repeating, slowly, to herself, ""Folks--does--tell--lies.""""Wait a minute, cousin Dotty,"" said Mrs. Clifford; ""Flyaway must put on a clean frock; she is not coming home with you, but you are to leave her at aunt Martha's. I shall meet her there at dinner time.""""O, then, if you spurn me and my offer, good by. I suppose my little Topknot goes for _surplusage_,"" said Horace, who liked now and then to puzzle Dotty with a new word. He meant that Flyaway was of no use, but rather in the way.""No, she needn't do any such thing,"" returned Dotty. ""Jump in, Fly, and sit on the bag."" And off moved the gay little party, ""the middle-aged sister"" laughing so she could hardly push, Flyaway dancing up and down on the rag-bag, like a humming-bird balancing itself on a twig; Grace and Susy looking down from the ""green chamber"" window, and saying to each other, with wounded family pride, ""_Should_ you think grandma would allow it?"" Out in the street the young rag-merchants were greeted by a cow lowing dismally. Flyaway, in her rustic carriage, felt as secure as the fabled ""kid on the roof of a house;"" so she called out, ""Don't cry, old cow; I 'shamed o' you."""
"In her earnestness the little girl pushed the bag to one side, and Prudy and Dotty, shaking with laughter, tipped over the wheelbarrow. No harm was done except to give Flyaway a dust-bath in her nice clean frock. Just as they were struggling with the bag, to get it in again, they were overtaken by a droll-looking equipage. It was a long house on wheels, and instantly reminded Dotty of Noah's ark.""Bravo!"" exclaimed Mr. Bradley, the merchant, as he came out and dragged the rag-bag into the store; ""so you've taken the business into your own hands, my little women? Ah, this is a progressive age! Walk in--walk in.""""Take some seats, young ladies,"" said Mr. Bradley, placing three chairs in a row, and bowing as if to the most distinguished visitors. Two or three men, who were lounging about the counter, looked on with a smile. Dotty was very well satisfied, for she enjoyed attention; but Prudy, who was older, and had a more delicate sense of propriety, blushed and cast down her eyes. She had thought nothing of driving a wheelbarrow through the street, but now, for the first time, a feeling of mortification came over her. If Mr. Bradley would only keep quiet!""A fine morning, my young friends! Rather warm, to be sure. And so you have brought rags to sell? Would you like the money for them, or do you think we can make a trade with some articles out of the store?""There was a smile on James's face as he drove the plug into the barrel. Prudy saw it through the open door, and it went to her heart. The cream beer was excellent, but Prudy did not relish it. She and Dotty had been whispering together.""Because,"" added Dotty, who wished to have everything clearly explained, ""because we want to have our tin-types taken, sir. We saw a saloon riding on wheels, and we thought we'd go there, and see if the man wasn't ready to take pictures.""Flyaway fluttered around for a minute, and then alighted upon her favorite sweet-meats, ""_pepnits_."" She chose for her portion a large amount of these, an harmonica, and a sugar pig, which Dotty assured her was not ""colored."" ""Nothing but pink dots, and those you can pick off.""""The rags came to seventy-five cents, and this young lady has now had her third; here is the remainder,"" said Mr. Bradley, smiling as he gave each of the little Parlins some money, and bowed them out of the store.Down the beautiful shaded street walked the three little rag-pedlers; and it did seem as if they were met by all the people in town, from the minister down to the barefoot boys going fishing. At last they arrived at the house on wheels.The windows were closed, and the odor of chemicals was so stifling, that the children almost gasped for breath. The artist seemed glad to see them, made no remarks about the wheelbarrow, though he must have noticed it, and said he would be ready in a few minutes. While they waited, they walked about the room, looking at the pictures on the walls."
"""See,"" said Dotty; ""there is Abby Grant, with her hair frizzed. Prudy"" (in a low whisper), ""you don't s'pose he will carry us off--do you? I forgot about the wheels, or I wouldn't have come! O, see that little boy; hands as big as my father's! Here comes Jennie Vance; I'm going to call her in.""Now Jennie was a handsome child, and knew it well; but Dotty took her wail in earnest. ""Why, Jennie,"" said she, with ready sympathy, ""I don't think you're so _very_ homely; not half so homely, any way, as some of the girls at Portland.""Jennie frowned and bit her thumb. Prudy smiled ""behind her mouth,"" but Dotty was serenely unconscious that she had given offence. By this time the artist was ready, and thought it best to try Flyaway first; for he had had enough experience with children to see at a glance that this one would be as difficult to ""take"" as a bird on the wing. Prudy made sure the wheelbarrow was safe, and then turned to arrange her little cousin.His tone was firm; he hoped to awe her into quietness. Flyaway was frightened, and clung to Prudy for protection. ""Don't the gemplum love little gee--urls?"" said she, in a voice as low and sad as a dying dove's.Mr. Poindexter laughed: it was impossible to be vexed with such a gentle child as Flyaway. ""Really, my young friends,"" said he, rubbing his stained fingers through his hair, ""I believe I shall be obliged to give it up for the present. Have the child's mother come with her to-morrow, and we'll do better, I am sure.""The children looked up street and down street. No wheelbarrow in sight. ""We must go to aunt Martha's, and then come back and hunt for it, if we have to go without our dinners,"" they said. They took Flyaway between them, and marched her off. She was almost as passive as a rag baby, ready to drop down anywhere, and fall asleep. ""'Cause I _am_ so tired,"" said she.Aunt Martha cordially invited the two cousins to dine. They thanked her, but no, they must find the wheelbarrow. ""We shan't say, certain positive, that bugglers took it, but we s'pose so,"" said Dotty, softening her judgment, as she remembered her mistake about the ""screw-up pencil."" They went home through the broiling sun, but found no trace of the wheelbarrow. Flyaway was very much sleepier than either of her cousins, and really did not know where she was, or what she was doing. Lonnie Adams, a boy of Horace's age, tried to interest her. He made believe the old cat was a sheep, killed her with an iron spoon, and hung her up by the hind legs for mutton, all which Pussy bore like a lamb, for she had been killed a great many times, and was used to it. But it did not please Flyaway; neither did aunt Martha's collection of shells and pictures call forth a single smile. There was a beautiful clock in the parlor, and the pendulum was in the form of a little boy swinging; but Flyaway would not have cared if it had been a gallows, and the boy hanging there dead."
"Uncle John took her on his knee, asked her what her name was, where she lived, and whom she loved best; but she only answered she ""didn't know."" She might have been Daniel in the lions' den, or Joseph in the pit, for all the difference to her.When Mrs. Clifford came, she was surprised to find the child fast asleep. She would not have her wakened for dinner; so Flyaway missed her ""secretary."" But when it was three o'clock, and she still slept, Mrs. Clifford feared something was wrong, and decided to take her home. Uncle John had ""Lightning Dodger"" harnessed, and brought around to the door.""Yes 'm,"" replied Flyaway, faintly. She did not understand a word any one said; it all sounded as indistinct as the roaring of a sea-shell. By the time she was lifted into her mother's arms in the carriage, she was nodding again. When they reached home she scarcely spoke, but, dropping upon the sofa, went on with her dreams. It was odd for Flyaway to take a nap in the daytime, and such a long one as this!""Very good, mother--don't you think so? I would be glad to have as truthful a likeness of our little Katie; but she must be taken asleep. I wonder, by the way, if there wasn't something in the air of the saloon which made the children all so languid?""Flyaway made no reply except to curl her head under Mrs. Clifford's arm, like a frightened chicken under its mother's wing. Mrs. Clifford looked troubled. She was afraid the little one could not be made to understand it. Horace came to her aid.So that was settled; and Flyaway decided to write off the whole story, and send to her father--a mixture of little sharp zigzags, curves, and dots. When Horace asked her what these meant, she said ""she couldn't 'member now; but papa would know.""There was another matter which troubled grandma Parlin somewhat. Dotty had gone to the store, after dinner, with two ten-cent pieces in her porte-monnaie. She had bought for herself some jujube paste, but in returning had lost the other dime.Ah, grandma Parlin, you little knew what you were undertaking when you called Dotty Dimple into the back parlor next morning, and began to talk about that money! Children's minds are strange things. They are like bottles with very small necks; and when you pour in an idea, you must pour very slowly, a drop at a time, or it all runs over. Dotty did not know much more about money than Flyaway.""Dotty, I am not going to say any more about it now. You may think it over to-day, and decide for yourself whether you are following the Golden Rule. Or, if you choose, you may wait and talk with your mother."""
"Flyaway sat on the kitchen floor, feeding Dinah with a roasted apple. As often as Dinah refused a teaspoonful, she put it into her own mouth, saying, with a wise nod, ""My child, she's sick; hasn't any _appletite_.""""It's pitiful 'bout the rain, Dotty; but you mustn't scold when God sended it,"" said Flyaway, dropping the feeble Dinah, and pursuing her cousin round the room with a pin. In a minute they were both laughing gayly, till Flyaway caught herself on her little rocking-chair, and ""got a _torn_ in her apron."" That ended the sport.""What shall I do to make myself happy?"" said Dotty, musingly; for she wished to put off all thought of Prudy's money. ""I should like to roll out some thimble-cookies, but Ruthie hasn't much patience this morning. I never dare do things when her lips are squeezed together so.""But Flyaway dared do things. She took up the kitty, and played to her on the ""music,"" till Ruth's ears were ""on edge."" After this the harmonica fell into a dish of soft soap, and in cleaning it with ashes and a sponge, the holes became stopped.Flyaway's next dash was into the sink cupboard, where she found a wooden bowl of sand. This she dragged out, and filling her ""nipperkin"" with water, carried them both to Ruth, saying, in her sweet, pleading way,--When they entered the nursery, Miss Polly was standing before the mirror, arranging her black cap, and weaving into her collar a square black breast-pin, which aunt Louise said looked like a gravestone. Flyaway peeped in too, placing her smooth pink cheek beside Miss Polly's wrinkled one.""I couldn't tell you,"" replied the good lady, giving a pat to her cap, and settling the bows carefully; ""but if you had asked how I happened to grow old before my time, I should say I'd had such a hard chance through life, and trouble always leaves its mark.""""Why, you little heartless thing! But that is always the way with children; their parents set their lives by them, but not a 'thank you' do they get for their love! Try a pinch,"" continued she, offering her snuff-box to the little folks, who both declined. This Polly thought was strange. They must like snuff if they followed the natural bent of their noses.""Yes, yes; just so,"" said Miss Polly, who talked to the simplest infants just as she did to grown people. ""One of these days you will look back, and see how happy you are now, and be sorry you didn't prize your parents while you had them.""Flyaway rested her rosy cheek on Polly's knee, and watched the gray knitting-work as it came out of the basket. She did not understand the sad woman's words, but was attracted by her loving nature, and liked to sit near her, a minute at a time, and have her hair stroked.""Bigger 'n' larger 'n' yours; only but I can't find it,"" said Flyaway, carefully twisting around her dainty white arm, which Polly kissed, and said was as sweet as a peach. ""Bigger 'n' larger 'n' yours. Where's it gone to? O, I feegot--'twas on my _sleeve_, and I never put it on to-day."""
"""You're a droll child, not to know the difference between scars and dirt! When I was almost as young and quite as innocent, that wicked little boy bit me, and I shall carry the marks of his teeth to my grave."" With another lingering glance at the purple mark, Polly drew down her sleeve, sighed, and began to knit again.""Bound to Mrs. Potter till I was eighteen years old. Her husband kept public house. They made a perfect slave of me. When I was twelve years old I had to milk three cows, besides spinning my day's work on the flax-wheel. And very often all I had for supper was brown bread and skim milk. I didn't have any grandfather's house to go to, with a seat in the trees, and a boat on the water, and a swing, and a summer house, and a _crocky-set_ (croquet set). Not I!""""I had to scour all the knives too. I did it by drawing them back and forth into a sand-bank back of the house. This Isaac I speak of was a lazy boy, and very unkind to me; but his mother wouldn't hear a word against him. One day I brushed a traveller's coat, and got a silver quarter for my trouble. I thought everything of that quarter. I had never had so much money before in my life. I had half a mind to put it in the Savings Bank; 'and who knows,' thought I, 'but I can add more to it, one of these days, and buy my time.'""""Yes; but one day Isaac found my money,--I kept it in an old tobacco-box,--and, just to hector me, he kept tossing it up in the air, till all of a sudden it fell through a crack in the floor; and that was the last I saw of it.""""Naughty, careless boy!"" echoed Flyaway. ""Here he is!"" holding up a paper doll shaped very much like a whale, with the fin divided for legs, the ears of a cat, and the arms of a windmill. ""Here he is!""""He didn't look much like that,"" said Polly, laughing. ""He had plenty of money of his own, and I tried to make him give me back a quarter; but do you believe he wouldn't, not even a ninepence? And when I teased him, that was the time he bit my arm.""""What do you say, Dotty Parlin? You, a child that goes to Sabbath school! Don't you know it is a sin to steal a pin? And if we lose or injure other people's things, and don't make it up to them, we're as good as thieves."""
"""I advise you to lose no time about it, then; that is the cause of your blues, I guess. We can't be happy out of the line of our duty,"" sighed Miss Polly, who regarded herself as a pattern of cheerfulness. Prudy scorned to take the ten cents. ""Did you think your 'middle-aged' sister would do such a thing, when she has more money than you have, Dotty Dimple? If you're only sorry, that's all I ask. I didn't like to have you laugh, as if you didn't care.""""Dotty Dimple isn't the best girl that ever lived. She had to be talked to and talked to, before she was willing to do right. She isn't any better than Jennie Vance, after all. Why did she pray that naughty prayer, just to make Jennie feel bad? God must have thought it was very strange!""""What a happy group!"" said Mrs. Clifford, looking up from her sewing. She had forgotten Polly Whiting, who was mournfully toeing off a sock for Horace, while he sat on the floor, at her feet, mending her double-covered basket.It was a quiet, busy, cheerful day. Dotty forgot to complain of the weather. Just before supper Flyaway jumped down from her grandpapa's knee, where she had been talking to him through his ""conversation-tube,"" and ran to the window.""Will He?"" said Flyaway, smiling through tears; ""but 'haps He'll forget how it looks. Musn't I save a piece of my nail, mamma, and lay it up on the shelf, so He can see it, and make the other one like it?""Yes, and who was that little girl getting down just after her? Her hat covered her eyes. ""It isn't Tate Penny!"" Why, to be sure it was! There was her dimpled chin; and if that wasn't proof enough, there was the wart on her thumb!To think such a glorious thing as this could happen to Dotty! and she not the best girl in the world either! A visit from her bosom friend! ""Aunt 'Ria, do you understand? Aunt Louise? Gracie? This is _Tate Penny_!"""
