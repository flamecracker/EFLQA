passage
"A carrion crow sat on an oak, Watching a tailor shape his cloak. ""Wife, bring me my old bent bow, That I may shoot yon carrion crow."" The tailor he shot and missed his mark, And shot his own sow quite through the heart. ""Wife, wife, bring brandy in a spoon, For our old sow is in a swoon.""_Hen._ Cock, cock, I have la-a-ayed! _Cock._ Hen, hen, that's well sa-a-ayed! _Hen._ Although I have to go bare-footed every day-a-ay! _Cock._ (_Con spirito._) Sell your eggs and buy shoes! Sell your eggs and buy shoes!I had a little husband No bigger than my thumb; I put him in a pint pot, And there I bade him drum. I bought a little horse That galloped up and down; I bridled him, and saddled him, And sent him out of town. I gave him a pair of garters, To tie up his little hose, And a little silk handkerchief, To wipe his little nose.King Cole was a merry old soul, And a merry old soul was he. He called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl, And he called for his fiddlers three Every fiddler had a fiddle, And a very fine fiddle had he; Twee, tweedle dee, tweedle dee, went the fiddlers. Oh, there's none so rare As can compare With King Cole and his fiddlers three!Once I saw a little bird, Come hop, hop, hop; So I cried, ""Little bird, Will you stop, stop, stop?"" And was going to the window, To say, ""How do you do?"" When he shook his little tail, And far away he flew.""Where are you going, my pretty maid?"" ""I'm going a milking, sir,"" she said. ""May I go with you, my pretty maid?"" ""You're kindly welcome, sir,"" she said. ""What is your father, my pretty maid?"" ""My father's a farmer, sir,"" she said. ""Say will you marry me, my pretty maid?"" ""Yes, if you please, kind sir,"" she said. ""What is your fortune, my pretty maid?"" ""My face is my fortune, sir,"" she said. ""Then, I won't marry you, my pretty maid!"" ""Nobody asked you, sir,"" she said."
