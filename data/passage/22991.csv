passage
"""Just because you wear an officer's uniform,"" retorted the boy, beginning to lose his temper and gazing fearlessly into the pale blue eyes of the other, ""is no sign you know more than we do. You may think that helmet and those stripes on your arm give you more brains than the common run of people, but it isn't so! I say I protest!""""And much good your protest may do you at this time and place,"" was the calm answer. Then, drawing his eyebrows down until the blue eyes were scarcely able to peer beneath them, he continued: ""I, Heinrich von Liebknecht, Captain in His Imperial Majesty's army in command of a detachment sent forward to capture this city, have decided that it is better that you remain with us. There is nothing more to say.""""Jimmie,"" cautioned another lad, stepping forward and laying a hand on the arm of the red-headed boy, ""perhaps it would be better to say no more just at this time. There must be some way out of this.""""Silence!"" commanded the man who had called himself von Liebknecht. ""The decision has been made. I leave you now, but will return in a few moments. By that time you will have said farewell to your friends and be ready to accompany me for service under the Kaiser!""Just as the door was closing behind the departing man Jimmie permitted himself to wrinkle his freckled nose in that direction and accompanied the gesture with a motion indicative of great disgust and contempt well known to many.The scene was one unusual in the extreme. Four young boys were standing in a room from which the ceiling had been partly removed by an exploding shell from a cannon. They were in one of the houses that had only partly escaped destruction during the bombardment of Peremysl by the Germans on that memorable first day of June, 1915.Three of the boys were about eighteen years of age and wore the well-known uniforms of the Boy Scouts of America. The eldest, Ned Nestor, was slightly older than the others and wore insignia that denoted his rank as patrol leader of the Wolf Patrol, New York City.Jack Bosworth and Harry Stevens stood beside Ned, their uniforms slightly the worse for wear, due to the extremely active experiences they had just undergone. These boys were members of the Black Bear Patrol of New York City, and were fast friends of Ned Nestor and his red-headed chum, Jimmie McGraw, the fourth member of the group.Just now Jimmie was not wearing the Boy Scout uniform. Instead he was dressed in the uniform of a Russian Cossack, and this was the immediate reason for the controversy that had arisen between the boy and the German officer. Those of our readers who have followed the adventures of the boys as related in previous volumes of this series, and particularly that entitled ""Boy Scouts with the Cossacks, or Poland Recaptured,"" will at once recall the exciting circumstances that resulted in Jimmie's donning the Cossack uniform and the reason for the presence of the four boys in Peremysl at this time.""They say clothes don't make the man,"" replied Ned, ""but in a great many cases clothes are like one's reputation--they play an important part in other people's estimate of us. In this case, for instance, the Germans have just captured this city from the Russians. You are discovered wearing a Russian Cossack uniform, and they naturally and almost excusably conclude that the wearer of the uniform is a subject of the country it represents.""""Yes, Jimmie,"" put in Harry Stevens, ""you see it pays to 'Be Prepared,' just as our motto says. We never can tell just when we'll be required to depend upon our reputation or our uniform for a favorable opinion from those who see us or hear of us.""""That's all very well,"" interrupted Jack Bosworth, ""but how are we to get Jimmie out of this predicament? General or Captain von Liebknecht seems to think that he's going to make a German soldier out of Jimmie just to keep him out of harm's way, and I don't like it."""
"""I'm afraid that wouldn't work, boys,"" he said presently. ""We would only be caught at it and all tried for spies, and maybe find ourselves in a worse predicament than we now are. Perhaps the German officer will listen to reason when he returns.""But, though Ned endeavored by every art of conversation at his command to influence the German Captain to change his mind, that individual insisted that since Jimmie had been found in the captured city wearing the uniform of a Russian Cossack he must be treated as one. The only alternative he would admit was that Jimmie must give evidence of his claim that he was not a Russian by enlisting in the German army.""So,"" decided the German, ""you haf been to riding horses accustomed. Goot. You shall now ride a horse for der Kaiser, und,"" he added meaningly, ""you shall do it vell. You may now say goot bye to dese odder poys und come mit me. Der oath ve vill administer.""Thunderstruck at the proceedings, but unable to render any assistance to their comrade, the three lads watched Jimmie disappear through the doorway. Then, as they were left quite alone, they turned to one another with an air of dejection.""In the first place, boys,"" answered Ned, ""I'm mighty glad to hear you ask questions like that. It shows me that you are ready for action instead of wanting to sit down and give way to despair. I'm ready for action this minute if I could only decide what should be done.""""What if he does?"" inquired Harry. ""Where would he slip to, and where shall we get to help him? It seems to me that every minute counts now. If they get him into a cavalry regiment they'll want to be on the move right away. At times like these, with Germany fighting the whole of Europe, they can't afford to let a regiment remain idle.""""That's very true,"" nodded Ned thoughtfully. ""Germany has won a victory over Russia, and that may relieve some of her forces in the east, at least temporarily, until Russia gathers enough of an army to make another assault. In that case they might send the cavalry regiment toward the western front in Prance or Belgium, where Germany is meeting the French, English and other troops.""""Well,"" began Ned, glancing at his comrades, ""it seems almost too bold a thing to try just at first thought, but I can't think of anything better than to try to get away from this place in the Eagle, and then watch our chance to kidnap Jimmie from those fellows.""With one accord the three lads moved toward the door. Ned glanced around the partially wrecked apartment in the hope of discovering something that would be of use to them in their endeavor to help Jimmie escape. An object in one corner caught his attention.Quickly joining Jack, Ned and Harry saw Jimmie standing in the street, surrounded by German soldiers wearing the uniforms of Uhlans. Directly behind the lad stood one of the soldiers with the muzzle of a gun pressed against Jimmie's back. Before him an officer stood, apparently administering some form of oath. The three boys could see Jimmie's lips move in response to the prompting of the officer."
"Ned, without replying to either lad, was busily scraping away the refuse from the corner. Almost concealed by the litter, he had seen a huge ring in the floor and, naturally concluding that it was fitted into a trap door, had begun an investigation for the purpose of discovering if the door led to a passage that might afford a means of escape for the lads. The proximity of the approaching soldiers made their need of some haven of refuge an imperative one.Presently Ned discovered the outlines of the trap door, which he had correctly surmised to be in that spot. The location of the debris favored the quick plan that had formulated in Ned's fertile brain. He rose to his feet and gave a quick glance about the room.Without wasting time or effort in conversation, the lad quickly pointed toward a table that lay upturned not far from the trap door. Signalling to his comrades for assistance, he darted toward the object and began dragging it to a position directly over the trap door.Jack and Harry, divining his intention, hastened to assist Ned. Their united efforts soon placed the table in position. It was the work of but a moment to raise the trap door and prop it up with a short piece of wood from the wreckage strewn about. Making the well-known signal used by railroad men in the United States as a sign for a fireman to shovel more coal into the firebox, Ned urged the others to descend into the darkness that yawned mysteriously at their feet.Harry and Ned, impatiently waiting for Jack to pass through the door, heard him drop to a floor below and give a startled cry. Then they prepared to follow just as the tramp of many feet resounded through the passage outside the room. Harry slipped into the opening and in turn dropped out of sight. Ned followed feet first and for an instant hung from the sill.Grasping the stick that had been used as a prop, Ned gave a mighty wrench backward and fell. He said afterward that it seemed as if he had taken a full week to drop from his position to the floor below. In reality the drop was not a great one. The distance was, however, greater than the height of any of the three boys, and explained their inability to gain a foothold before releasing their hold upon the floor above. For a moment Ned was unable to regain his breath.Harry's question brought Ned and Jack to a realization of the fact that the room they had so recently quitted was occupied by the soldiers from whom they had tried to escape. Footsteps echoed along the stout floor, and the boys could hear sounds indicating that pieces of furniture were being hurriedly overturned.The noises above them gradually lessened. Presently they ceased altogether, and the boys could hear footsteps clattering along the floor in the direction they assumed the door to be. Directly quiet reigned in the place.""There certainly are, and lots of them,"" was the positive answer. ""When I dropped into this place I think I dropped onto one, and must have crushed him before he had time to squeal. I heard others running.""Acting on this suggestion, the boys clasped hands and moved slowly about, feeling their way cautiously with their feet. They seemed to be in a cellar with a solid stone floor that had been made quite smooth."
"In a short time the boy had succeeded in producing the desired shavings from the board Harry had discovered. Gathering these carefully in his hands, he held them ready to receive the flame from Harry's match. All three lads eagerly gathered closer together as Harry prepared to strike the match that would give them the desired ability to see. Harry's hand trembled a trifle in spite of his effort at self-control. His first effort was unsuccessful.""That's peculiar!"" declared Jack with emphasis. ""Just think of all the matches used every day in the United States by thousands and thousands of people who never think of saving them. We have used a whole lot of matches ourselves needlessly, and now we want just one as badly as we ever wanted anything. It's fierce!""With trembling hands the lad took the shavings from Jack's hand. Carefully shielding the tiny flame from possible draughts of air, the boy held the point of one of the thin pieces of wood over the flare. In a moment it had caught fire. Licking up the curl, the flame gradually leaped from one piece of wood to another until the entire handful was ablaze. The dancing light played upon the three faces and sent a glow out into the surrounding blackness. Harry deposited the burning shavings upon the floor, where the fire was soon transmitted to the larger piece of wood Jack had used in whittling.When the soldier who had been holding his rifle at Jimmie's back lowered the weapon and the ceremony of administering the oath of allegiance to the Kaiser had been completed, the red-headed Boy Scout who had been masquerading under a Cossack uniform breathed a deep sigh of relief that but faintly expressed his sentiments.In spite of the seriousness of the situation, Jimmie maintained a mental reservation that little less than contradicted his words so recently spoken. He felt that it would be only policy to obey the orders of those in superior force, since he could see no advantage to be gained by a flat refusal. His thoughts rapidly compassed the situation, and he recognized the fact that the invading horde of Germans were in no mood to consider dispassionately the matter of a boy more or less who was found under the circumstances in which they had discovered Jimmie.During all the time that he had been repeating the words after the officer the boy had been mentally conjecturing a means of escape whereby he might rejoin his chums and be fairly sure of the escape of the entire party from the hands of the army that had so recently captured Peremysl and who were now engaged in bringing order out of the apparent chaos that reigned.Then he began to believe that it was not the intention of the German Captain to allow the boys to leave the country. The thought was a very disquieting one. In entertaining it, Jimmie felt himself fully justified in taking any possible course of escape.""Well, my lad,"" began the Captain, addressing Jimmie in a not unkindly tone, the while his blue eyes regarded the lad with an amused glance, ""now that you are a full-fledged Uhlan and your comrades are on their way home, you will be fitted out with a new uniform by the proper department. See that you select a good strong one, for we have plenty of rough work ahead of us. Yes?""A brief order spoken in the German language to an orderly nearby resulted in that individual signing to Jimmie. Obediently the lad followed his new guide. Past groups of soldiers who were, by their fair hair, round cheeks, blue eyes and general stocky build, members of the German army, the boy and his conductor took their way."
"Not far down the street they came upon several wagons in charge of a commissioned officer, before whom the guide stopped with a very formal salute. After receiving a recognition of his salute the guide explained his errand. A laughing response greeted his explanation of circumstances. The officer called one of his aides, and the work of outfitting the erstwhile Cossack began.Jimmie discovered that the wagons were veritable stores on wheels, and was greatly surprised at the neatness and order with which the large assortment of goods were disposed. No difficulty was experienced in securing clothing of the proper dimensions, and Jimmie soon stood forth to all external appearances as loyal and brave a Uhlan as ever followed the banner of the Emperor or stuck a lance into a dummy at riding exercise. He could not restrain a laugh at the peculiar round cap that was fitted to his head.The guide followed with great interest Jimmie's motion of pointing into his open mouth and gazed delightedly at the patting of the stomach. Apparently, however, he could discover nothing amiss with the belt buckle or any of the accoutrements that adorned the person of the new-found recruit. He shook his head in a negative way.""Ach, Ich say, old scout,"" he stated, ""Ich would like some brodt haben, und sauer kraut, und wiener wurst, and kaffee, and pumpernickel, und kaffekuchen, und Kolbfleisch, und--oh, whatever you have handy.""""And I say, dumbhead, Heute Ganse Braten!"" Jimmie added vigorously. ""There!"" he declared in an undertone, ""I know I saw that sign in Dick Stein's restaurant on the north side in Chicago one time when I was there, and I asked the man what it meant. He said it was German for 'We have roast goose to-day,' and I'd like a little of that, too.""""Maybe you didn't, and again maybe you did,"" retorted the lad rather tartly. ""If you keep on playing your monkey shines on me, you'll get me sore pretty soon, and I'll be tempted to cloud up and rain all over you. And there'll be considerable dunder und blitzen along with the cyclonic disturbance in the atmosphere,"" he added.""Great frozen hot boxes!"" cried Jimmie in a despairing tone. ""I don't see how, with all the scarcity of ivory in the market, the billiard ball makers let you roam about at large so long. Why,"" he added with rising indignation, ""you're giving the exact symptoms of a chap who is ossified from the shoulders to the sky! Of course I want to eat, and I'd be de-lighted to perform that simple operation now.""""Say,"" retorted Jimmie, ""just let me have your name and the address of any relatives you want notified in case of accident. Something is going to blow up pretty soon, and when the explosion is over they'll go around with a sponge to gather up the pieces of the innocent bystanders. Among those present was a former waiter at Dick Stein's.""""Well, if you'll just be good enough to get me one of those nice large German pancakes that we used to get at Stein's, with a couple of cups of coffee and a little 'T' bone steak well done, with some fried potatoes and a side order of cauliflower in cream, some cold slaw, a little lettuce, some lentils, and a small platter of sauer kraut, I'll try to worry along until mess time. Can't we eat at all?""Jimmie followed with much interest, taking note of everything as he went along. Here he saw a group of soldiers resting after some evidently heavy work. There another group were arranging their accoutrements and polishing their weapons as they rested in the shade of a broken wall that had withstood the heavy hammering of the immense German guns during the days of bombardment of the city."
"Everywhere was activity, indicating to Jimmie that not only were the Germans investing the city and preparing it for their occupation, but that other preparations were under way. This could only mean to the lad that the commander of the invading forces was preparing to press the advantage he had gained by following the Russian army he had driven from Peremysl and attempt to administer a crushing blow.""All right; I vote yes on the amendment,"" persisted Jimmie, feeling that by a little maneuvering he could learn something from his guide. ""From what the Captain said while we were in the house and you were on the street, I understand that your regiment will be one of the first to be tolled off to pursue the Russians. Maybe he'll send me with them. I do hope so, for that will give me a chance to get a whack at them in payment for the hard treatment I received.""As he glanced about in search of his guide he discovered the German stuffing the discarded Cossack uniform into the furnace underneath a huge kettle. With a startled cry Jimmie grasped frantically at his breast. Then he darted forward and snatched the clothing from the fire.""Well, if you're a friend, step forward and let us see what you look like,"" challenged Ned, turning in the direction from whence the strange voice proceeded. ""You needn't be afraid to show your face.""As the lad spoke he peered eagerly toward the blackness surrounding himself and his chums. Owing to the faintness of the flame from their small fire, the darkness lying about them like a dense pall was too great for his eyes to pierce. Try as he might, he could not distinguish even the faintest outline of the stranger.""Perhaps,"" was the dry response from the utter darkness. ""But,"" went on the stranger, ""you'd have a beautiful time doing it. There's only one way out of this place except by the trap door through which you came. Unless you're regular little derricks you can't move all that rubbish piled on top of the trap door, and you'd not be apt to discover the underground exit if you had the eyes of a hawk and an electric light plant besides. Better come along.""""I rather feel as if we ought not to go with this fellow unless he's willing to show himself and let us get an idea who he is,"" Ned stated in a hesitating way. ""Perhaps you boys are right, but I don't feel at all easy about it. Maybe he's trying to get us into a trap.""""You're right there,"" put in Jack, ""but on the other hand we're in a bad fix, and Jimmie's outside and needs us. This fellow's coming may be just the chance for escape that we are wanting. Suppose we follow him as he suggests and all the while remember our motto to 'Be Prepared.' Wouldn't that be the proper course?""""Suspicious still, I see,"" laughed the other. ""Well, follow this light, and be careful how you step. There may be irregularities in the floor that you'll have to discover for yourselves. It won't be safe to do any talking for a while. The Germans are watchful."""
The three boys were startled to observe a circle of light appear upon the stone floor of the apartment at some little distance from the spot where they were standing. It appeared to emanate from an electric searchlight held in the hands of the stranger.Ned thought that he could faintly discern the feet of the person carrying the light, but was unable to learn anything of the character of the person. He was torn between his desire to escape from the apartment and the wish to learn the identity of the stranger.In spite of his efforts at self-control, Ned's muscles trembled and he found it difficult to walk steadily. Assuming that his chums were in like plight, the lad summoned all his courage and reached out a reassuring hand to the others. The contact with his friends seemed to restore the equilibrium that had been Ned's most valuable asset in times of stress and danger in his many adventures.Long afterwards the boy declared that in all his experiences that compassed many strange and hazardous enterprises in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, China and other countries he had never felt so keenly the need of aid as he did at that moment.Not for long, however, were the boys permitted to consider the peril of their position. Almost instantly they heard a faint grating sound directly in front of them. A cold draught of damp, musty air struck their faces, and they understood that a door had been opened into some other apartment. The odor of the incoming air told them plainly that the next apartment was also underground, and they surmised that it had not recently been occupied.Unhesitatingly the lads advanced. Jack had taken but a couple of steps before he collided with some solid object. The shock of contact brought forth a grunt of surprise. At the same moment Harry went through a similar experience. Ned met no resistance and nearly lost his hold of the others before he recovered his balance.Jack and Harry fell in behind their Scout Master obediently, and the little party began groping its way along. Ned reached out a hand on either side as he went forward. His hands came in contact with walls that appeared to be made of stone. The dampness had gathered in great drops on the surface. A slime had been deposited that made Ned shudder as he felt it. He knew, however, that this was no time to permit an interruption through squeamishness.There was now no guiding light in advance, and the boys cautiously picked their way along the stones, with Ned feeling every inch of the way before he set his foot down. Directly the lad heard another warning hiss. This time the sound was closer than formerly.Ned followed this instruction immediately. He judged by the height to which he raised his hand to rest it upon the other's shoulder that the stranger was a person of about his own build. His sense of touch also told him that the other's clothing was of a material similar to the khaki uniform he himself was wearing. A faint odor of gasoline and grease assailed his nostrils, particularly distinguishable because of the damp air in which the party was traveling.
"Before the little party had traversed the passage to any considerable distance they heard several other explosions similar to the first. One particularly louder than the others was followed by the sound of small pieces of rock tumbling from the roof and walls of the passage. Ned pressed still closer to his guide, while Jack and Harry needed no urging to make them crowd up to Ned in their impatience.Not far from the point where the boys had noticed the pieces of rock falling the guide turned a corner abruptly. Ned wondered how he was able in the intense blackness to distinguish so accurately the spot for making the turn, but refrained from making any comment.As he followed the guide around the corner the lad's foot struck against an object lying on the floor. A metallic ring from the object he had kicked caught the lad's attention. Slipping his hand quickly down the other's back in preparation for a movement to pick up the object, Ned was surprised to come in contact with a belt. He was startled to observe that the belt was filled with cartridges.Without stopping to comment upon the circumstance, Ned stooped quickly with hand outstretched. His fingers came in contact with the object his foot had struck. He instantly recognized it to be an automatic pistol. Restraining his impulse to cry out, the lad shifted the weapon in his hand to a grip that would permit him to use it in case such a move was necessary. He straightened up at once.Greater caution, if possible, was now used by all in their negotiating the dark passage. A few steps farther on carried them past the place where the voices had been heard. Ned breathed a sigh of relief as the voices died away in the distance.A louder detonation than any they had heard yet drowned Ned's reply. The walls in the passage seemed shaking as if about to fall. From the passage in their rear came shrieks and groans. An odor of sulphur came blowing upon their backs. A crashing and grinding noise filled the air. Jack and Harry closed in upon the others.Jimmie's momentum carried him toward the camp kettle with such violence that he was unable to check his speed. He could only swerve his course enough to avoid actually falling into the open door through which fuel had been fed. Unfortunately, however, the lad lost his footing and, as he fell, thrust a hand against the hot iron.""What business have you got burning up my clothes, I'd like to know!"" he indignantly began. ""You big sauer kraut eater. You don't seem to know that clothes cost money and that these clothes were presented to me by the Imperial Czar of Russia!"""
"""Yes, I'll watch you,"" Jimmie stated aggressively, his face flushing until the freckles were scarcely distinguishable. ""You can burn the old uniform as fast as you like, but there is something in it that I want before you start the conflagration.""Otto stretched forth a hand in an effort to wrest the already charred and smoldering garments from The Wolf. He evidently intended to take matters strictly into his own hands and obey orders to the letter, regardless of Jimmie's wishes in the matter.Although suffering keenly from the hand that had come in contact with the iron and that would be giving him pain for some time, Jimmie directed his attention to a search of the garments. He thrust his uninjured hand into one pocket after another, frantically groping for some object. Directly he gave a glad shout and withdrew his hand, clutching a small packet from which a loop of heavy cord hung.Otto had lost some of the zest with which he had been imbued when he first raised an objection to Jimmie's action. His sluggish nature had dominated his movements, and now he moved forward with the ponderous motions of the average German agriculturist, although it was plain to the observers standing about that nothing short of a superior force could deter his progress or swerve him from his course.Jimmie's interest in the packet had absorbed his attention to such an extent that he had not noticed the approach of the German, and it was not until Otto's great arms surrounded his form that the boy realized his danger. He had considered Otto merely as a guide, and had not thought it possible for him to act in any other capacity. Now he understood that the German intended to do him bodily harm, if possible. Quickly as the realization of his danger flashed through the boy's active mind, he began to plan a means of escape. He well understood that, struggle as he might, his strength would be far less than that of his antagonist, and he knew that, in order to escape, he must resort to his knowledge of wrestling and boxing.Otto's arms had encircled Jimmie's form and were slowly tightening in a python-like constriction that forced Jimmie's organs upward into his ribs and shut off his heart action. Again Jimmie recalled vividly his experiences in trying to break a ""body scissors"" on the mat, This time, however, he cast aside the rules of conduct that forbid fouls and determined to free himself at whatever cost.Otto's surprise at feeling Jimmie's heels gouging up and down his shin was exceeded only by his astonishment at receiving a blow on the chin from Jimmie's red head. Butting in a fight was a part of ""the game"" that the former newsboy had picked up in his encounters on the Bowery when protecting his corner from other vendors.Long since discarded, the accomplishment now served Jimmie well, and he used it effectively, not forgetting to keep one foot in action as he industriously pegged away at the foot upon which his heel had first landed. Jimmie believed thoroughly in the old adage that 'continual dropping will wear away a stone.'Black specks began to float slowly across Jimmie's vision and his breath seemed to have left his body. In place of lungs the boy felt he had only a great raging furnace. His foot began to be heavier and heavier. He was about to give up in despair.Without warning, Otto released his grasp to fling Jimmie from him as he stepped backward to escape the onslaught of kicks and blows from Jimmie's active head. As he released the boy he aimed a vicious swing that would have done a great deal of damage had it landed.Luckily for the red-headed Uhlan, his feet became tangled in the remnants of the discarded and partly burned uniform that had been the innocent cause of the battle. Just as Otto aimed the blow at Jimmie's head the boy stumbled and fell backward.Perhaps one of Jimmie's most lovable qualities was the ability to see and appreciate a joke, no matter what the time or circumstances. This quality so dominated the lad that his comrades often declared he would laugh at his own expense even when he was hungry. Just now he was so impressed with the absurdity of the uniform's being the cause of his trouble and the means of his escape that he laughed aloud."
"Unnoticed by either of the contestants, a considerable number of the cooks and ""kitchen police"" had gathered to witness the difficulty between the two. These bystanders now offered words of encouragement in an effort to prolong the battle. It seemed that the dominating spirit of battle had not been satisfied during the several days of awful history-making struggle between the armies around the stricken city. The bloodlust was strong in their souls.Jimmie heard their cries, although he could not distinguish the words they used, nor could he have understood them had he done so. He realized that Otto would probably hear and understand, and that for very shame, if for no other reason, the other man would return to the conflict. He therefore drew a deep breath and braced himself for the expected advance. Something warm and wet seemed to be trickling down over Jimmie's face. He put up a hand to wipe it away. The hand came away wet and sticky. To Jimmie's astonishment the hand was red.A roar of rage assailed his ears, and Jimmie turned just in time to duck under a mighty swing. Angered at the persistence displayed, Jimmie let fly a stinging hook that fell short of its intended mark. Instead of landing on Otto's chin, as he had purposed, Jimmie flung his fist full upon the ""Adam's apple"" of his antagonist, bringing forth a gurgling squawk that afforded merriment to the bystanders.He lost no time in following up his advantage. Quickly springing forward, he landed a shower of blows, each one in a telling spot about Otto's head. The lad's ire was fully roused, and he entered into the matter of administering punishment with a zest.Handicapped by his lighter weight, the boy could not hope successfully to cope with the burly German on anything like an equal footing, and consequently determined to press the advantage to the utmost, hence he wasted no blows, but made every one count.Eager to administer what he considered ample punishment, yet wary and cautious, the lad gave his entire attention to his effort. He was looking for an opening through which he might slip a ""knockout,"" and gave no heed to the events transpiring about him. Hence he did not notice the approach of a small party of officers until he felt a hand laid heavily upon his shoulder and a voice spoke in his ear.""The same,"" replied the officer who had first interviewed Jimmie in the partly ruined house. ""It seems to me,"" he went on in a severe tone, his pale blue eyes narrowing to mere points, ""that my recruits might be in better business than trying to spoil my veterans!""For a moment Jimmie forgot to be respectful. The old spirit of Bowery repartee, so long held in leash and thoroughly muzzled by Ned Nestor's training and Jimmie's own self-control, had broken bonds, and now showed itself upon the surface without restraint.""So I observe,"" remarked the officer, ""and for that you shall be punished. It shall be my pleasant duty to see that you get your full share of regular work, and in addition I shall assign you to the delightful position of assisting the police detail.""""That is your misfortune, not mine. If you had been so fortunate as to be a German, you would have been much bigger and perhaps more respectful. You will please remember in future to be at least civil."""
"Jimmie began to realize that it would not be to his advantage to continue the conversation, especially in the spirit already shown. He therefore drew himself up to his full height and gravely saluted, using the well-known Boy Scout form, with thumb and little finger touching and the other three fingers extended vertically, palm outward.The action seemed to please von Liebknecht immensely, although he would not alter his decision in the least. A rapidly spoken order to an aide standing near resulted in Jimmie's being hurried away in the direction of the camp where the Uhlans' horses were quartered.""Second the amendment,"" laughed Ned, controlling himself with a slight effort, ""I've got this fellow dead to rights, and if he will only help us with his searchlight, we will try to get outside quickly.""A shriek of agony cut short the suggestion Ned was about to make. By common consent the boys drew closer together as the awful sound echoed through the narrow confines of the low tunnel in which they were imprisoned. All thoughts of introductions were driven instantly from their minds, to be replaced by their desire to render aid.A circle of flame from the searchlight in David's hand was his reply to this request. It fell upon the damp, slimy walls of the tunnel, illuminating a small space in their immediate neighborhood. The boy swung the searchlight to a position where it would give them a view of the area through which they had just come.An appalling sight met their eyes. The explosion had wrecked the roof and sides of the narrow space. Heaps of broken rock and other debris choked the passage. Beneath one of the lumps projected the feet of a man. Beyond that the boys could dimly see the forms of one or two others. It seemed that several men had been unfortunately caught.As they reached the spot where the man lay imprisoned, David thrust the searchlight to a favorable position, where it would show them the face of the stranger. He knelt but a moment. Rising again to his feet, the lad turned to his new-found companions.""I'm sure that it's no use, boys,"" he said. ""If the fellow had not been beyond help he would not have stopped crying out. In such a time as this, heartless though it may seem, we'll have to look out for ourselves without spending energy on those beyond help.""""I echo your sentiment,"" said David. ""And now,"" he added briskly, ""let us give our attention to getting out of this place. I wonder if we can move some of these looser stones and get through into the room beyond. We may be able to get out to the street that way.""""We are now under one of the big buildings--I should say under the ruins of one of the big buildings of Peremysl. It got struck by shells during the early part of the engagement and was neglected after that. The men we heard were refugees from the Russian army who thought they would be able to appear after the German occupation and do some damage to the invaders. They were well equipped with supplies of various sorts, including ammunition, and intended to get out to-night."""
"""I don't know about that,"" objected Ned. ""I notice that the smell of powder is not so pronounced as it was a while ago. The air in here seems much better than it did before the explosion, and I believe that somewhere a passage has been opened which permits the air to flow in. It seems to me I can smell sweet air.""All the boys took hold eagerly and began the task of removing the barrier that prevented their exit. They took turns holding the searchlight upon the work. Presently Jack announced that he could see light through the crevices between the stones. This announcement was hailed joyfully by the others.""Perhaps I can find something,"" volunteered David. ""I know where the Russians kept most of their stores. They had a place over here at one side of this big space filled with things to eat and shoot and so on. They had a lot of stuff in there.""""I rather imagine they have gotten away as fast as they could after the Germans began blowing down the tottering walls. Those fellows we saw back there in the tunnel were possibly trying to get away by that route,"" replied David. ""I intended bringing you here when we left the cellar where the rats were. I thought the way was clear.""""I got tired of being a prisoner,"" answered David. ""Naturally, when the chance offered, I just slipped into the passage and started. I counted my steps to the end and found I must go the other way. When I had reached the cellar where you were I was exploring it when I heard the noise overhead. I just stayed in the dark until you made a light.""As David had predicted, the boys found a smaller room opening off the large one in which they were gathered. There was a miscellaneous collection of articles comprising food, ammunition, arms and many other things. They at once attacked the food supply.Scrambling over the wreckage and ruins of the building, the four boys, each bearing a vessel with gasoline, gained the street. They turned a corner and passed along apparently unnoticed. In a short time they stood in the vacant space where the Eagle had landed.""Right arm above head, left horizontal--that's 'J,'"" said David. ""Right diagonally down, left across chest--that's 'I;' right diagonally down, left horizontal--that's 'M;' he repeats it; he repeats 'I;' right down in front, left up diagonally--that's 'E.'""For a time Jimmie forgot the drudgery to which he had been sentenced as a result of his fight with Otto for possession of the tiny packet concealed in the Cossack uniform. Forgotten were the multiplicity of duties incident to his service as a member of the ""kitchen police""--the work to which all offenders in the army were subjected, and which corresponded to the tasks of a garbage collector."
"Apparently the lad was devoting himself wholly to the strenuous labor of calisthenics. There seemed to be no idea in his mind of making any certain motion a given number of times for the purpose of developing different muscles. Instead he merely placed his arms in various positions and held them there a moment before assuming a different attitude. Seldom did he repeat any motion.We know, of course, that he had seen the boys as they emerged from the underground cavern that nearly proved their tomb. He had taken a chance on their being his comrades and had made signals to attract their attention. When he received an answering wave of the arm from Ned he delightedly began sending a message by means of the well-known semaphore code. Although the lad possessed no flags or other means of carrying out fully the code as prescribed, he did the best he could with only his arms for signals. We know that Ned and his chums were able correctly to interpret the message Jimmie was sending.""Great frozen hot boxes!"" mused the boy half aloud. ""They are down there among the ruins. I wonder how they got free of the searching party. Things have been coming pretty fast for me lately, and I declare I clean forgot the others. Wonder what they'll do.""He had not long to wait. Directly he saw Ned and the others consulting beside the aeroplane. The next moment Ned had stepped clear of the machine and began waving his arms after the same fashion adopted by Jimmie when he spelled out his own name.""There he goes!"" declared Jimmie to himself. ""There he is making the letter 'C.' There comes 'A,' and next is 'N.' That is 'Can.' Now here comes 'U;' 'Can You.' Here is 'G,' 'E,' 'T.' 'Can You Get--.' Now he says 'A,' 'W,' 'A,' 'Y.' That's 'Away.' Can I get away? Not very handy with all these Germans about. Guess I'll have to tell him something myself. Here goes."""
"Accordingly Jimmie began a reply in the same code. He briefly informed Ned that he understood the regiment was to go west, probably to Verdun, where Jimmie had heard that heavy fighting was taking place. He also stated that he was unable to escape in daylight, but that he would try to do so after nightfall.Instantly he gave the well-known danger signal and tried to tell Jimmie that someone was near. For some strange reason the lad failed to comprehend the information given, and not until it was too late did he realize that it was himself who was in danger.Intently watching Ned and trying to interpret the signals being made by the older boy, Jimmie did not observe the footsteps of the approaching soldier. Suddenly he felt an arm thrown about his neck. He was drawn irresistably backward by the strong arm that shut off his wind nearly to the choking point.For what seemed to the lad countless years the vise-like grasp was maintained upon his windpipe. He began to understand that his struggles were useless, and spent his entire energy in an effort to stiffen the cords of his neck, hoping to assist his breathing by so doing. Presently, as he ceased his struggles, the soldier who had so skillfully captured him set the lad upon his feet.Jimmie's only reply was a wrinkling of his freckled nose in a grimace of extreme disgust and contempt. Even had he been so minded, the condition of his wrenched neck and strained muscles prevented sprightly conversation. He winked rapidly to clear his tear-filled eyes, and indulged in another wrinkling of the nose.""So,"" continued the other, paying no heed to Jimmie's motions of contempt. ""And this is why we have not had better success in our campaign. We must fight not only the enemy in their trenches, but we must also contend with traitors in our own camps!""""The subject we will not change,"" was the cool rejoinder of the German. ""We just now are discussing your giving information to the other Russian spies down there in the city. You will not need a name after to-morrow, or possibly after this evening, if Herr Captain von Liebknecht is as zealous in the service of the Kaiser as he has been. If I were giving orders, you would be shot now.""""Well, all right,"" Jimmie replied. ""I guess we'd better be going now, so I'll get my bucket from the place where I dumped its contents into the ditch and we will go back to camp. I hold no resentment against you for your harsh treatment of me, especially since you weigh just about three times as much as I do.""Although the boy's manner was light and buoyant enough to deceive even the experienced and hardened Uhlan who had constituted himself captor, his heart was heavy, for he well understood the danger of his position. He could hope for little nursing from the peculiar German minds with which he had to cope. Appearances certainly were against him, and he knew that the evidence would be taken only at face value.No time was lost by the soldier who had Jimmie in charge. He went directly to the spot where Captain von Liebknecht's tent was pitched. A sentry paced up and down the narrow limits of his beat, carrying his rifle in the prescribed position. In accordance with regulations, he was equipped with his full outfit, including a vicious looking sword bayonet and bandoliers of cartridges that gave forth a silent message which to Jimmie's troubled mind spelled a most gloomy and forbidding prospect for the immediate future."
"A challenge from the sentry halted the pair until the necessary questions and answers could be exchanged. Upon being convinced that Jimmie's conductor had an urgent message for the Captain, the sentry ordered them to remain where they were while he hailed the guard stationed inside the tent. To this individual the sentry explained the reason for the visit and the request for an interview.He led the way into the tent, raising the flap for Jimmie and his captor to pass. More than ever the lad felt his appellation of The Wolf was well deserved. It seemed to him that circumstances were conspiring to make him seem to the Germans a predatory animal, and while he would have been willing and was even anxious to dispel this notion from their minds, he well understood that nothing he could do or say would be of effect in this direction. Feeling keenly the need of most careful handling of the situation, Jimmie glanced quickly and furtively about the tent. He was somewhat surprised to observe there a number of officers of the regiment apparently in conference.A number of papers, amongst them maps, was spread upon the little table in the center of the tent. Captain von Liebknecht had patently been directing certain movements of troops, using the maps to further explain his instructions. Jimmie's entrance had interrupted the Captain's action of tracing with his finger the line of railroad leading from Peremysl, or Przemysl, as it must henceforth be known.In a flash the boy realized that von Liebknecht had been giving instructions for the transportation of troops by rail, and that Cracow would be the next stopping point, where he guessed that the horses would be detrained for water and rest if possible.Mentally making a note of this fact, Jimmie raised his glance fearlessly to meet the cold blue eyes of the German officer. In that glance Jimmie comprehended the fact that he could expect little mercy from a man whose whole ambition in life seemed to be unquestioning and unwavering devotion to his Emperor. He read also in the blue eyes craft and skill in diplomacy and a keen intelligence withal.As none of the group seemed able to reply, silence was the only response. The Captain let his glance wander about from one to another of his aides. His eyes rested for a moment upon the countenance of a member of the group apparently older than the others.""Aw! Go on!"" put in Harry. ""I move we go back to the cellar and get a bunch of those Russian rifles with sufficient ammunition, fill the tanks of the Eagle with some of this gasoline, get aboard a lot of canned goods and swoop down on the German camp like a hawk after some chickens. We can let down a trapeze for Jimmie to grab onto.""""Now, see here, Dave,"" argued Harry, ""if you could have seen Jimmie when he rescued Havens, the aviator, in British Columbia by dropping from our aeroplane to that of Havens by means of a single rope, you wouldn't think the trick so very impossible.""""Of course,"" admitted David, ""I have no doubt your friend is a wonder, although I have never met him. It is not so much his ability I question as it is the possibility of our getting to him without being detected by the Germans. My word, that is a big task.""""Evidently there are a number of things you don't know,"" returned Harry, it must be said in a somewhat boastful manner. ""We'll have to introduce you to Mr. Ned Nestor, the champion aviator of the Wolf Patrol of New York City. And,"" the boy added, ""that means, of course, the United States. He is some aviator, I tell you!"""
"""Well, I guess I wouldn't have been far wrong at that,"" contended Harry with a glance of pride in Ned's direction. ""As the Irishman would say, Ned has 'a way wid him,' and you know it as well as I do.""""I'll not be the last one to admit that Ned certainly can coax an aeroplane into doing stunts that seem marvelous, but I agree with Dave here that unless our chum has some way of striking the Germans blind and deaf we have a mighty slim chance of picking Jimmie up.""In spite of the seriousness of the situation in which the boys found themselves, David could not repress a laugh of merriment and appreciation of the light-hearted manner in which Harry and Jack met the difficulties and dangers surrounding the little party.""I say, lads,"" he began, as the four boys took their way carefully from the site on which the Eagle rested toward the underground cavern they had recently quitted, ""there's plenty for us in that storeroom, and all we need to do is help ourselves. If only we are not interrupted by some of the Germans patrolling the town, we will be all right.""""Now, Jack,"" protested Ned, ""that 'shooting iron' business will have to be postponed, I'm afraid, until such time as we are more nearly out of the woods than we are just now. It wouldn't be quite the thing.""""Oh, of course,"" said Jack in a tone intended to appear sulky, but with a covert wink at Harry, ""somebody is always taking the joy out of life. Why can't I just shoot up a few Dutchmen, I'd like to know?""""Yes, it is,"" admitted Ned, ""but at the same time we must remember that 'two wrongs never make a right,' and, according to my recollection, number ten of the Boy Scout laws states that a scout is brave and has the courage to face danger in spite of fear, and defeat does not down him.""""My word,"" put in David, as the little party prepared to descend into the subterranean cavern which they termed their base of supplies, ""these poor fellows here are not able to know whether it's a disadvantage or not. Just look at that poor chap lying there.""Luckily for the little party, the German occupants of the defeated city were busily engaged in occupations that required all their attention. Hence the work of provisioning the Eagle was accomplished without untoward incident. In a very short time the boys had succeeded in placing aboard the air craft sufficient fuel and provisions from the abandoned stores to satisfy the demand of even Jack and Harry, who well remembered the hunger with which they had been assailed at the time of their entrance into the stricken war zone.Preferring not to use the self-starter, for the sake of quiet, Ned turned an electric switch which controlled a circuit leading to a contrivance designed by Harry for just such an emergency. This delicate piece of mechanism was located at the carburetor, and was called by Harry the ""starting stove."" Its office was to warm the gasoline to such an extent that it would make vaporization much more rapid than would ordinarily be the case. This would enable the aviator to start his engine without the usual difficulty due to cold fuel.It was even as the boy said. A detachment of soldiers, evidently policing the town, had discovered the activity of the boys in the vicinity of the giant aeroplane and were coming forward to investigate.Ned stepped on the starting pedal energetically. Current from the storage batteries flowed through the motor, saturating it almost instantly. Ned's foot was pressed upon the cut-out lever, and the resultant roar from the engines precluded absolutely the possibility of further conversation. Like a thing of life the Eagle leaped forward. Ned gave all his attention to the problem of steering.In an ever-widening circle the Eagle rose above the open space upon which it had rested. Ned lifted his foot from the cut-out lever, throwing the exhaust from the engine through the specially designed muffler, which was perhaps Harry's greatest pride.In astonishment at the results achieved, David glanced in wonderment and amazement at the fabric which was bearing the boys aloft. Fully able to appreciate superior mechanism, the boy was lost in his examination of the delicate and yet effective machinery."
"His glance of approval rested upon Ned and Harry in turn. He looked about to give a friendly nod to Jack. Greatly to his surprise, Jack was not to be seen anywhere in the fuselage. Startled greatly, he turned toward Ned and laid a hand upon the boy's arm.Ned almost precipitated the entire party in a sudden plunge earthward as he turned in response to David's query. For a moment only the boy lost control of the great machine. But that moment was enough to cause the aeroplane to dip swiftly toward the ground.Before Ned could regain control much of the altitude was lost. In another instant he had again directed the course of their craft toward the open air high above the ruined city. But the lost distance was sufficient to bring the party within range of the rifles of the German soldiers who had been running toward their location.In wide-eyed amazement Jimmie stared for a moment at von Liebknecht, not knowing what answer to make to the sudden question. He disliked very much telling the officer the truth concerning the packet he had been to so much trouble to rescue, yet felt that nothing else but the exact truth would serve in the present instance.For a full minute he glanced about from one to another of the group in the tent. The glances that met his in return were anything but friendly. Some were indifferent, while others scowled fiercely as their resentment against the lad mounted. Evidently all firmly believed that the boy was what he had been accused of being--a spy.""How, then,"" he asked, endeavoring to make his voice convey the spirit of friendship he tried to feel for the lad, ""can you say that it is not contraband or infer that the packet does not contain information that would be of value to our enemy if you do not know its contents?""""Because I received it from a man who was dying and who wanted badly to make restitution for some things he had done that were wrong. He had no interest in the dispute between your country and your enemies except to make whatever money he might from the matter.""""Well,"" Jimmie continued, ""there was a man in the United States who brought over a ship load of ammunition. He stole a lot of money intended for the relief of the suffering people of Poland. He kidnapped and shanghaied me and generally proved himself a bad sort. When he got over to Riga he was forced to enlist in the Russian Cossack regiment, the same as I was, and when the Russian Cossacks attacked the German troop train he was wounded badly. I tried to assist him, and did what I could. When he found he was dying he asked me to take this packet, which I understand contains the keys to a safe deposit box in New York City, and when I get back there he wanted me to see what I could do toward setting right some of his wrongdoings.""""A very fine tale, indeed,"" was the comment of von Liebknecht, ""but you will scarcely expect us to believe that in the face of all the circumstances. We don't mean to imply that you, necessarily, know different, but the man's story as you have told it is improbable.""""I am telling the exact truth as I understand it!"" declared Jimmie earnestly. ""If he was lying to me, I do not know it. I believe he told the truth, for he understood that he could not live much longer."""
"""Nevertheless, we will be obliged to examine the contents of the packet,"" stated von Liebknecht positively. ""Is it not so?"" he asked, turning to the group of officers for confirmation of his decision.Unwilling to submit to the proposed action, Jimmie took a step backward. His action was misinterpreted by the soldier who had captured the boy. With a quick motion the man again seized the red-headed lad in the same manner as previously, and deftly slid his hand to the pocket where the packet reposed. Before Jimmie could offer any resistance the object sought was brought forth and tossed upon the table.Jimmie gasped. He began to understand that the records of his presence in the German regiment of Uhlans would be made to show favorably for the officer in command in case anything serious happened. And that something very serious would shortly happen to him the boy did not for a single moment doubt. He felt vaguely uneasy.Presently, when the wrappings had been removed, he saw a key and a folded paper. The key was of the peculiar construction adopted generally by safe deposit vaults for the use of their patrons. The paper had been prepared evidently for use in case of just the emergency that had overtaken the man who had given it to Jimmie. It was covered with memoranda and figures in very fine waiting.""It appears different to me,"" the Captain objected. ""I am of the opinion that it has to do with information concerning the dispute in progress between my country and the enemies. I am sorry, but I shall have to retain the packet for forwarding to headquarters. You will receive it again if it is found to be what you claim. Otherwise--""""They are, no doubt, well acquainted with you and your abilities,"" went on von Liebknecht. ""If your capacity for taking care of yourself is equal to your ability to make a disturbance, they should experience no uneasiness on your behalf. Besides,"" he added, ""it is impossible to communicate with them just now. We do not know where they are.""In spite of the seriousness of his own situation, Jimmie breathed a sigh of relief, for he felt that the information given him was correct, and he interpreted the Captain's statement to mean that the three boys had succeeded in making their escape from the soldiers.He was, nevertheless, greatly perturbed over the prospect of leaving the immediate vicinity, for he felt that his chances of escape were greatly lessened. He knew that the boys would endeavor to assist him, but, owing to the interrupted code message, he could only guess at how this would be accomplished.The map, still spread upon the table, gave him a hint. He remembered the fact that von Liebknecht's finger had pointed at Cracow. A firm resolve formed within the boy's breast. He determined that, if his suspicion proved correct and the regiment paused at Cracow, he would make an attempt to escape there. He also decided that if it were at all possible he would advise his chums of the fact."
"While Jimmie was turning over these points in his mind a buzz of whispered conversation was going on between the officers around the table. At length a decision was reached, and von Liebknecht again turned his attention to his newest recruit.""You may go in company with this man,"" he said. ""He and Otto Freundlich will be given charge of you, and will be required to turn you over to the proper officer upon demand. They will have orders to insist upon your presence at all times, and in order to make sure that you do not attempt to escape they will be given orders to shoot if necessary. I would advise you for your own good not to try to leave the regiment at any time.""""If we are leaving this place and my chums are not here,"" Jimmie replied, feeling that further argument would accomplish no alteration of the Captain's decision, ""I cannot see why I should attempt to escape. You are entirely wrong in supposing that I am trying to get information to the Russians concerning your army.""""Perhaps you are right,"" assented von Liebknecht, not unkindly. ""That is a point that we shall ascertain in our own way. For the present every circumstance is unfavorable for you, and we must be careful. You understand, do you not?"" he asked with a slight smile.""Good!"" declared the Captain, apparently greatly relieved. ""That makes it easier for us. Now, I shall ask you to assist in getting your equipment ready for the journey. Everybody will be required to work hard if we leave at the time desired.""""So we are to be comrades for a while at least?"" inquired Jimmie pleasantly as the pair left the tent. ""We might as well get acquainted before we go farther. My named is Jimmie McGraw. What is yours?""""Mine iss Frederich von Strassheim,"" answered the other, apparently feeling no resentment against Jimmie for his kicks and blows delivered during the process of capture. ""We shall be well acquainted.""""The designation 'von,'"" answered the other, proudly drawing himself erect, ""is used only by those entitled to it by royal decree. My ancestors distinguished themselves and were of the house of Hohenzollern. That is why I am allowed to use it.""""We shall in full marching order break camp,"" was the reply. ""To the train of cars we will ride, and there put our horses and baggage aboard. Then we start for the west. But here is the exact spot where you were standing when I interrupted your conversation."""
"""Yes, this is the place,"" acknowledged Jimmie. ""And right over there is the aeroplane of my friends. Oh, look!"" the boy cried. ""See, they're starting out with it! Great frozen hot boxes! Those other fellows are shooting! Good night!""At the instant Harry leaned over the edge of the car for the purpose of getting a better view of the field they had so recently occupied another shot rang out from below. Mingled with the report were shouts and exclamations from several of the soldiers.As will be remembered distinctly by those of our readers who have had the pleasure of riding in aircraft, sounds from the earth are distinctly heard at a great altitude. In fact, sounds may be distinguished clearly at a much greater distance in a vertical than in a horizontal direction. It was owing to this fact that the shouts from the group below came so clearly to the lads in the Eagle.Ned's guiding touch upon the levers sent the Eagle forward at a rate of speed that quickly carried the entire party to a distance well out of rifle range from the party below. He was heading for a hill at no great distance from their present location.""Not a soldier!"" declared Harry. ""But,"" he added, ""that doesn't say they're not there. Those uniforms they are wearing blend so closely with the natural colors of the landscape that one can't very well tell whether a German is near or not until he feels the cloth.""""Yes, sir!"" continued Harry. ""When I get down there you'll have to do all the work of engineering the deal. You'll have to do a whole lot of pulling and hauling, and you'll have to run out on one side to balance the machine. Mustn't have the ship list too much!""""Well, here's my plan,"" Harry went on rapidly, as he began overhauling the coil of line. ""When I get out on one side I'll go along the framework, of course. You'll be on the opposite side to balance. Then when you see that the machine is tipping your way you are to get nearer the center of gravity so as to stabilize the affair.""""Exactly. Now, it will be a hard job for us to get this line passed under the framework so that we can get a purchase and pull it to Jack. I can't reach that far, and Jack probably is hanging on with his hands, feet and eyelids, so he can't let go with one hand even."""
"""Let's take a loop of the line and fasten it around my body under my arms. You can be inside the machine paying out slack as I need it. I can take a similar loop and by crawling under the machine I can reach Jack all right and pass the loop about his body. Then you can haul in slack bit by bit as he crawls along the truss rod to the side of the fuselage. In that way there will be practically no danger, for the loop of line about our bodies will prevent our falling if we should slip.""""Excuse me for insisting,"" Dave said in a modest manner, ""but I am quite sure that I am better fitted than you. My work in the Northwest has always required considerable work with my arms, and besides that I am pretty well developed about the arms and shoulders. I don't want to discredit your ability, but I'm sure, don't you know, that I am stronger than you and could do the work better. You'll let me try, won't you? Really, you know, you ought to let me help!""""It's not to your discredit at all, Harry,"" put in Ned, ""that Dave has larger muscles than you and is perhaps stronger. This is a job that requires all the muscle possible, so I think we'd better let him try it. We must get Jack out of that place as quickly as possible.""Dave lost no time in tying a bowline in a bight at the two ends of the length of line. One of these he passed over his own body. The other he took in his teeth. In another moment he was over the side of the car, while Harry did his best to balance the Eagle as he had planned for Dave to do, at the same time paying out line as it was needed.Bit by bit the line came aboard with its human freight in the loop at the end. Harry was exceedingly careful to haul in very slowly, in order that he might not trip his chum and cause a disaster. In a few moments that seemed endless ages to Ned and Harry their comrade's head showed and the Eagle again took a tilt to starboard.""Never mind the details just yet,"" panted Jack, stretching his shaking arms and working his fingers to restore the circulation that had been somewhat impeded because of the tense muscles. ""Let's get Dave up here safely first. That's one plucky Scout!"" the boy added.Although the feat that the boys proposed attempting would call for considerable skill, and was certainly not lacking in danger to all parties, they were not daunted. They had determined to rescue their friend at whatever cost and knew that ordinary means would prove useless.""Oh, you give me a fine large pain!"" stormed the now thoroughly aroused lad. ""Every time you see a shadow, you jump on it for a spy. Is your old information so precious that nobody must know it? What makes you so suspicious of everybody and everything?"""
"""And that's quite enough to make me feel that I'd like to be a spy once just for pure spite!"" declared Jimmie. ""You and your spy business make me tired! We Boy Scouts don't care a rap about your old information!""He realized, however, that he could gain nothing by a loss of temper. It was with a great effort that he controlled his temper and forced himself to watch the flight of the aeroplane. Deep in his heart the boy was hoping ardently for the success of those in the machine, for he was now fully convinced that it was Ned and his comrades who had attempted the flight. He watched every movement with great interest.When he saw the figure of his friend hanging to the truss rod beneath the Eagle, Jimmie's heart almost stopped beating, so great was his anxiety for the other's safety. As the sound of the rifle shots reached his ears the lad turned away his head, for he did not in the least doubt that the marksmen had been successful.When he again looked toward the speeding plane he danced with joy, for he saw the figure still clinging to its perilous position and knew that by great good fortune the chum he loved so dearly was unharmed.""I can tell you why Boy Scouts do a great many things,"" declared Jimmie vehemently. ""They do the things that are right and square because it is best and because they are living up to the rules of conduct that they are taught. That's why they do those things!""A movement of the Uhlan attracted Jimmie's attention. The lad saw a glint of steel and wheeled to observe the erstwhile peaceable man turned into an entirely different sort of individual, with his short saber held in his hand in a threatening manner.For a moment the boy contemplated flight. An instant's reflection, however, showed him the folly of such an attempt. He knew that, although he was fleet of foot and believed that he could easily outrun the other, he would be no match for a bullet if one should be sent after him. Besides, he saw that his friends could not possibly reach him with the plane if he should leave the elevated position on which he stood.Concluding that his only hope of escape lay in patient waiting, the lad turned reluctantly from his position and prepared to accompany Fritz as he had been directed. He felt that he was giving up the only certain means of getting away from the regiment he now thoroughly hated.""Gee!"" he exclaimed petulantly, stepping forward a pace. ""It seems as if the whole bloomin' German army was determined that I should get mixed up in the war! First it's von Liebknecht and now it's you and Otto keeping after me, and I never did a thing to any of you!""Entertaining visions of what might happen if Fritz became too careless in his attentions with the saber, Jimmie cast a last look over his shoulder at the rapidly approaching airship. He again took a hesitating step toward the German, as if to accompany him.One glance revealed the strange lad clinging to a perilous seat on the truss rod. With one hand the newcomer was balancing himself, while with the other he was shaking out into plain view the noose trailing at the end of a line hanging from the under side of the plane."
"Without paying the slightest heed to the efforts of Fritz to right himself from the undignified position into which Jimmie's onslaught had placed him, the lad dashed forward to a point from which he thought he could most advantageously grasp the trailing loop.Nearer and nearer came the dangling line. The boy, under the extreme excitement of the moment, began to imagine the feel of the rope in his hands, and reviewed the motions he would have to make in order to seize the line and be drawn up to his comrades.He gave a brief thought of thankfulness to the gymnasium training Ned Nestor had so consistently urged upon the members of his patrol, and flexed his biceps in anticipation of the strain they were to receive.Ned seemed to be handling the Eagle with consummate skill. He had brought the machine to an altitude that was nicely calculated to afford Jimmie just the opportunity needed without trailing the line upon the ground, yet not having it out of the lad's reach.So absorbed were all the lads that they had not observed the activity about the German camp caused by the approach of the aeroplane. They failed to see several marksmen running toward their position with rifles ready for instant use and with determination upon their faces.For the moment the lads seemed to forget that they were approaching a camp of men who suspected them of being Russian spies and who would hesitate at nothing to prevent their carrying out their designs.Nearer and nearer swept the Eagle with her strange purpose. At length Jimmie's hand was outstretched to grasp the loop of line Dave had so cunningly fashioned. He started on a run in the same direction the airship was going, for the purpose of lessening the shock of being picked up from a standstill by the airship that was still moving at a good speed. He felt the rope within his hand, and then he heard a shot.Instantly realizing that their maneuver had been discovered, the lad knew that the soldiers would endeavor by every means within their power to frustrate the designs of himself and comrades. Yet he was determined to make the attempt at escape, desperate though it was.In another instant the lad saw by a quick glance earthward that the Eagle was not rising rapidly enough to get away from the cluster of tents toward which it was heading. He knew that Ned was doing all possible to so manipulate the wings of the monster craft that the tents would be cleared, and hoped ardently that he might be able to do so.As the Eagle began a sloping ascent that promised to accomplish the purpose of its pilot another rifle in the hands of a German soldier spoke its sharp command and another bullet sped toward the little party.Lower and lower came the other boy until he reached the knot of the loop he had tied for Jimmie's benefit. There he hung a moment. Jimmie looked toward the earth again and saw that they were nearly over the tents. Mentally deciding that they would clear the tops, the lad again glanced aloft to observe the strange boy.It seemed that coincidentally with another shot the Eagle suddenly jumped miles high into the sky. Then he found himself bumping about with the strange lad in a world of canvas with several other people.Ned was too busy, however, just at that moment to give a suitable reply to the queries. The antics of the Eagle were occupying all his attention, and he made extreme efforts to prevent the craft and its freight from being dashed to an ignominious end in the midst of the camp of Germans who had succeeded in making a prisoner of Jimmie.With a great leap the Eagle soared away from the camp amidst the humming of bullets from the rifles of the angry Uhlans, who fired rapidly but without proper aim. Accustomed as they were to shooting at targets on a level with themselves, they found it an entirely different proposition to properly aim their weapons when their quarry was at some distance above the earth.""Better get Dave out of his perilous position as soon as we can,"" put in Harry, remembering their new-found friend who had done such valiant service. ""He'll be tired by this time, with all this rough riding and bouncing about we have been giving him."""
"""Well, from the sudden way in which the Eagle's progress was checked, I'm sure that Jimmie caught the loop of line all right,"" was Ned's answer. ""Then,"" he went on, ""from the way in which the craft shook just before she jumped skyward, I believe that the two boys were in some sort of difficulty. All at once we began to climb, and that indicated to me clearly that a considerable weight had been lost.""""Jimmie will come out of any mixup with his fists doubled up,"" was Jack's almost laughing comment. ""I believe that if that chap were to fall into the hopper of a mud scow he'd come out with a clean shirt on and a smile all over that freckled face of his.""""Better not swing too close,"" advised Jack. ""We can't tell what tricks those fellows may have up their sleeves. They weren't prepared for our sudden coming, and so failed to get us. Next time, though, they may be more fortunate and we might get something not wanted.""Accordingly Ned, in an effort to appease the curiosity of his chums, brought the Eagle in a wide spiral to a position about three thousand feet above the camp and a trifle to the westward. From this point of vantage the lads could clearly see the camp within the range of their field glasses. Jack nearly danced with joy as he looked.""Hurrah!"" he shouted. ""I can see a group about one of the tents that looks all flattened out. I'll bet that Jimmie landed on top of the tent and broke it down. They're standing in the middle of the group there, and seem to be surrounded by officers.""""Why, they'll be taking train right away for the western front, unless we're badly mistaken,"" answered Ned. ""All we have to do is to leave them alone for a few days until they arrive at the front, and there we can help Jimmie and Dave to escape.""""I hardly think so,"" argued Ned, tilting the planes to bring the Eagle a trifle closer to the earth. ""In the first place, I think the officers will want to keep the two lads for the amusement of the soldiers. It will give them something to think about for a few days.""""That's what I'm coming to,"" went on Ned. ""I figure that they will not be willing to see harm come to the lads through the Germans directly, because it would make trouble between the German nation and ours and that of Dave. They may make the lads go into the front lines when they get to the front, and if they should get hit by a bullet from one of their own countrymen the situation would be different.""""I see,"" reflected Harry. ""Then in that case the Germans could claim they were not directly responsible. They might claim that the boys got enthusiastic and enlisted voluntarily. If they got shot it was no fault of the dear, kind Germans!"" he finished sarcastically."
"Ned's laugh at the other's reply went far to break the spell of melancholy that rested upon the group after they had discovered the loss of their comrades. Truly they needed a bit of cheering, for the situation was anything but pleasant and hopeful.""I see a little village off there to the right a piece,"" said Jack presently. ""We'd better find a favorable landing spot not far from the town pretty soon, for it's coming on dark and we'll be unable to see without showing searchlights that would expose ourselves.""Under Ned's capable hands the Eagle swooped silently and swiftly toward the earth. The great machine behaved splendidly in every particular. All three boys craned their necks eagerly toward the earth as they descended. With watchful eyes they peered about.Ned walked down the road a few paces, then turned to look back at the spot where they had come through the bushes. He examined carefully the shrubbery, and stood a short time examining the outline of the trees and larger growth, carefully noting the contour.""We shall see. Now, first, you are at Bochnia, a little way to the east of Cracow. Vienna lies almost due southwest, and the city of Berlin is almost due northwest. You are nearly one hundred and fifty miles almost due west of Peremysl,"" he concluded.He thought that he recognized the voice, but could not at once determine the identity of the one who made the statement. Just at the moment there appeared to be a world of canvas and ropes wound about his head and body. He gasped for breath.Struggling to free himself from the entangling mass of cloth that seemed to be smothering and weighing him down, the lad presently found an opening, through which he thrust his head. Blinking rapidly as he cleared his eyes from the dust that had arisen because of the sudden downfall of the tent, the lad gazed about in astonishment.The next instant the hand shifted from his ankle to his collar, and he was unceremoniously dragged forth from the enveloping folds of the tent cloth. Without an apology the one who had so effectively taken the boy from his position set him upon his feet.""Well, if you'd ever been on Wall street,"" Jimmie began, with a twinkle in his eye, ""you'd understand me perfectly when I say that I took a little flier in aeroplanes. The stock went up rapidly, and I felt the bottom drop out of the market. When I landed, my surprise was, to say the least, quite 'in tents'!""""Not quite Johnnie Bull enough to be English,"" mused Jimmie aloud, ""but still too much Johnnie Bull to be strictly United States. Say, Scout, where are you from, and what is your name, and where are you going?"" he went on, gazing earnestly at the stranger.""Why, we were trying to give you a chance to get out of this mess,"" replied Dave. ""If it hadn't been for the rotten luck that German marksman had in cutting the line by which we hung, we'd have made it, too!""""And then the German army would surely have been defeated,"" put in Jimmie with a broad smile, ""for without this valuable addition to his fighting forces the Kaiser would never be able to conduct this war at all properly. They need me here in the army, it seems."""
"""We'd better report to von Liebknecht, who is in command here. He'll be apt to make us carry garbage away from the kitchen, but we'll have to submit to that until the opportunity for escape appears. Here he comes now. Just keep a stiff upper lip and leave the talking to me.""A sharp order was given, and instantly the boys were being escorted toward the stables. There they were assigned to tasks under the watchful eyes of certain soldiers, amongst whom Jimmie noted his erstwhile friend Otto. In the hurry and excitement of breaking camp conversation between the newly made chums was impossible.From that moment the boys noted preparations for the departure of the regiment. Far into the night they worked side by side with the soldiers of the Imperial Kaiser, loading horses and various items of baggage and supplies into a train waiting not far distant from the camp.By the time that the last horse had been properly placed in the cars and the last item of baggage was correctly stowed, the lads were so weary and exhausted they were glad to lay themselves on a pile of forage. In another moment they were both fast asleep.""Probably he's only a station master or something,"" said Jimmie with feigned unconcern. ""Maybe it's the Kaiser himself for all we know. If it is he, I'm going to scold him roundly for deserting all the perfectly good sausages in Berlin and coming way out here just to stop our perfectly good little train. Wonder what he wants.""Dave grasped the side of the door and leaned far out from the carriage in which the boys were riding. Had he not done so the result might have been far different. Jimmie had only time to utter a single word of caution before he saw that his chum was slipping.With a cry Dave tried to regain his lost balance. Finding that it was impossible to draw himself back into the car, the lad chose the only other possible course and leaped into the air in an effort to land squarely on his feet as he left the car.Instantly the lad recognized the fact that he was committing an act of extreme incivility in thus shouting out the identity of so august and important a personage. Yet he also knew that it was too late to retract his statement. He therefore, with his usual air of unconcern, determined to face the matter and make the best of it.""Well, it seems to be the pretty general opinion that because I was found in Peremysl with a Cossack uniform on that I am a Russian,"" went on Jimmie. ""Mr. von Liebknecht, here, seems to think that I am trying to get back to the Russian army with a lot of information that I haven't got and--oh, a whole lot of things!""""This is indeed a strange circumstance. Just now the regiment is moving westward, and it is not proper that they should be delayed. Orders have been given for their departure, and they must be obeyed. If you will come with me we will inquire into the merits of your case and decide what shall be done. Will you do that?"""
"""There, there,"" said the man soothingly, ""of course you're not spies. I didn't intend to have you understand that you would be acting the part of spies in giving me the trifle of information I wanted. You failed to understand me, that's all.""""You don't understand, I see,"" continued the other. ""The Germans have left here only women and children and very old men. They even took away with them such food supplies as could be transported easily. Now there is very little grain left, and with it perhaps a few potatoes and other things. But all the cattle and other food supply has been removed. The villagers are on the point of starving.""""We are afraid they will not,"" was the answer. ""They have not a very savory reputation here. It is the intention of the remaining people to escape to the country, taking with them whatever they can carry, when they know the Germans are again moving in this direction.""""Evidently you do not understand the characteristics of this people or their love of their home, no matter how humble it may be,"" was the answer. ""If you only understood the fact that these good people have a gentler side to their nature and that their love of home and family is fully as great as you will find in your own country, you would not need to ask such a question. It is a most serious matter to most if not all of these people to go away from their homes.""""We know that they have been successful in their assault on the town, and we understand that the capture of that stronghold will leave many troops free for use at other points. What can be more natural than that they should leave Peremysl in the hands of a force sufficient to guard it against any possible attack by the Russians and rush the remainder of their troops to other points where they are needed--say a few regiments at strategic points like Verdun?""As he finished speaking the man glanced casually about the place, as if observing a passer-by. Ned and his companions exchanged quick looks of inquiry. Using the mute language in which the boys were adept, Ned flashed a question at his chums.""No, I can't say that I do,"" replied Ned positively. ""You seem to have plenty of information on hand right now to enable you to make any necessary preparations for the advent of the Germans if such a thing should happen. For myself, I don't believe that the Germans would visit this place a second time. It isn't at all likely.""""For the same reason that lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place and a mule doesn't kick twice in the same place--they don't have to,"" was Ned's quiet answer. ""That's a good reason, isn't it?""Although Ned's answer had been made in a quiet tone, the words were full of meaning, and it was apparent to all that the man was capable of understanding the firmness and resolve in Ned's manner and voice.""So, then, you refuse to give me any information concerning the movement of the troops?"" went on the other with an air of finality. ""Of course, I suppose you realize that the result of a German raid on this town would be laid at your door if an inquiry were made? The good people here are not so ready to forgive as you may imagine. If you have information that would help them to safety and do not give it, could you blame them if they felt rather unfriendly toward you?"""
"""Now see here, Mister--whatever your name is--,"" began Ned, slightly nettled, ""we came here only to find a place to buy some gasoline and some food. We are not in this country as spies, and we have repeatedly declined to give information to either side. We can't start now.""""All right, then,"" said the man, nodding his head slightly, ""have your own way about it. But,"" he went on, ""if you fail to make any purchases such as you desire, please don't blame anyone but yourselves.""""You're right, Harry,"" put in Jack with vigor. ""Do you know, boys, I wouldn't object to making a little bet that our visitor is a German himself, put here for the purpose of keeping an eye on everything that goes on. He was just trying to pump us, that's all.""""Let's get out of here, boys,"" suggested Harry. ""If that fellow is within fourteen rows of apple trees of the truth and this village is deserted by all the able-bodied men, we won't have much chance of getting gasoline or food or information at this place.""Suddenly they were startled to hear the report of a rifle and to be greeted by the peculiar tearing sound made by a bullet in its flight through the air. Almost as if actuated by a common impulse the three lads crouched low and broke into a run.Again came the report of the rifle and the noise of a bullet speeding on its errand of death. As Jack had stooped to run he had taken a quick glance over his shoulder. Now he closed in nearer to Ned.""Here it is,"" said Ned, producing the desired article. ""Lucky for us that I brought it along. Better start the engine with the muffler on. We don't want the remaining villagers to come storming up here.""Ned handed the searchlight to Jack and then prepared to make ready for the anticipated flight by buttoning his coat tightly at the throat. He knew that the damp chilliness of night would be uncomfortable. Just as Ned and Harry were preparing to assist their chum they were startled to hear him cry out in surprise:It was even as the lad said. Their own machine lay not far from the one they were examining. Working quickly, the lads produced a bucket from the Eagle and in a short time had located the drain cock at the bottom of the German plane's fuel tank.They had successfully transferred several loads of the precious fluid to the tank of the Eagle, working with extreme caution, when Jack gave a warning hiss from his post at the hedge screening the field.As Jimmie announced the willingness of the two lads to accompany the German forces he was looking straight at Dave. The lad from the Northwest thought he caught the slightest tremor of Jimmie's eyelid, but was not positive. However, acting on the assumption that he was correct and that Jimmie had some purpose in declaring in so positive a manner his intentions, Dave thought best to offer no remonstrance.Their stay in this place would be short, for it would not take long to change engines and have the troops moving westward again. A second section of the train was following closely. The boys knew that no time would be lost by those in charge of the movement of troop trains."
"Hedged round by a ring of soldiers who were fully armed, the boys could see others at a short distance patrolling the station grounds. An open space of some considerable area was occupied just now by small groups of soldiers who had left the train by permission and were walking about for exercise. Electric lights were mounted on poles to give illumination to the grounds.""I don't know where the other boys have gone by this time, but it's a cinch that they won't stray far from the line of railroad if their gasoline holds out. If we can drop off between stops we can signal them and maybe they'll find us. It ought to be easy.""Others of the party beside the train were now observing the noise that the lads had noticed. An officer dashed across the open space on which the soldiers were exercising. Running up to the group in which the Kaiser walked, he saluted gravely and reported the circumstance.Nearer and nearer came the sound. At length it appeared directly overhead. Looking up, the boys could faintly make out a great gray form at some distance above the train. For an instant only it appeared, to vanish the next instant in the darkness. The clamor of the motors, however, was not diminished.The boy's prediction was correct. For a short time the aviator circled about the station, evidently searching for a suitable place in which to make a landing. In another moment it was seen clearly that he intended to land as near the station as possible.Of all the observers none was more interested than the two Boy Scouts so strangely thrown into the company of this train load of fighting men and their emperor. Jimmie was the first to discover the pilot's intentions. Grasping Dave's arm, he dragged the other a short distance away from the spot, to be clear of the descending plane.A switch engine was bringing up a coach to attach it to the rear of the train. The coach was evidently intended for the use of the Kaiser, for it was stopped exactly opposite the little party surrounding him.Before the task of stopping the aeroplane was fairly accomplished the pilot had leaped from his seat. He approached the group of officers about the Kaiser with rather unsteady steps and gravely saluted.""Just a moment now,"" said Dave. ""He's unburdening himself of a long talk about the movement of some troops, I take it. Now he is saying,"" the boy went on, ""that he has seen or some one has seen a strange aeroplane near here. It is supposed to be one of the French machines that has somehow got past the lines and is scouting.""""Well, come to think of it, you are right. It might be the Eagle he has seen and is reporting. What can we do to stop him if he should take a soldier or two with him now and start out to plug the little old Eagle and her crew full of bullet holes?"""
"A sudden resolve came to the red-headed lad as he pondered over the situation. Glancing quickly about to observe whether the two were under surveillance, he drew from his pocket several small objects.""Stay just about here, Dave,"" he said. ""I'm going over to the machine and see what I can do to fix it so they can't run very well. If I'm successful it may mean that we can save the boys on the Eagle. If I'm caught at it I'll take part in a little shooting-fest myself, and I'll act the part of the shootee. Keep your eyes peeled, and if anyone comes this way put me wise by whistling.""""I'm going to take a long chance,"" Jimmie answered, with the peculiar setting of his jaws that his comrades had learned so well to understand meant a resolve that nothing could swerve. ""Keep your eyes open.""Presently the group of officers about the Kaiser seemed to have questioned the aviator to their complete satisfaction, for several turned and walked down the track toward the coach waiting for the use of the Kaiser. Others walked briskly away across the parade ground, while the aviator himself and the Kaiser walked together along the track toward the aeroplane that had brought the man to earth.Dave was about to signal Jimmie that danger was near, when he saw that the lad was coming back. So interested were the aviator and his auditor in the conversation that was going on that they apparently did not notice the boy leaving the vicinity of the machine.""Nothing. I just wanted to get your mind off the subject. You're trembling like a leaf,"" answered Jimmie. ""If they see you it'll be a dead give-away. Can't you stop shaking so? What's the matter?""By this time the aviator had reached the machine and was preparing for another flight. Willing hands had been stretched forth from the crowd of soldiers who had but a moment before ignored the machine entirely, and the plane was turned about and headed away from the station.A preliminary explosion or two from the motors announced to all that the aviator intended leaving the place. Other explosions rapidly succeeded the first. Then came a silence. The aviator was examining his machine, evidently seeking for the cause of some trouble.""Well, let 'em come,"" declared Harry, hastening toward the Eagle with the last load of gasoline. ""We are ready for a quick start now, and if they want to see a correct imitation of three boys beating it down the road they'd better hurry. We can't wait much longer.""""Let 'em miss the boat if they can't get here on time,"" laughed Jack, carrying out the joke, although the case of the lads was apt to become anything but a joke if their presence was discovered by the German soldiers who were approaching at some distance down the road.The boy was already in the fuselage of the Eagle. He reached an eager hand to assist Harry with the gasoline. Harry climbed up to a favorable position and was about to pour the gasoline into the fuel tank while Ned, in his haste to be off, was priming the motors."
"""No, boys,"" counseled Ned, ""we'd better try some other stunt. If they get angry at us they might do anything, and we can't stand it to get shot to pieces just now. Remember, Jimmie and Dave need us.""""Well, the more the merrier,"" declared Ned. ""In numbers there is strength, I've heard, and perhaps in numbers will come our chance. If they'll only get in one another's way for a while we'll give them an opportunity to hear what a real old-fashioned 'good-by' is like.""""Coming!"" announced Jack as he prepared to descend. Ned and Harry at once followed their comrade, and directly found themselves on the ground, confronted by several men in the uniform of one of the German regiments. The officer in command looked his surprise.Only a few words were needed from their captor to acquaint the officer with the situation. He laughed immoderately at the apparent joke of the purloiners of his gasoline being caught before they had time to use it. His merriment was infectious, and presently the entire group were giving vent to their feelings.The three boys felt that they were the object of the soldiers' ridicule, yet they were unable to make any reply, since they did not understand sufficient German to be able to converse with their captors.When the officer had finally laughed himself tired he gave a command and the soldiers formed about the lads and began escorting them toward the town. Once there, the officer led the way to a house with which he was evidently familiar.Lights were brought and an examination of the lads was begun. After several preliminary questions the officer found that he had met his match in the matter of wits. Ned declined absolutely to give any information other than that he and his comrades were from the United States and heartily wished to be back there.""I don't think that was it at all,"" laughed the officer. ""It was those uniforms of yours. You see, they are different than what he was accustomed to seeing, and he probably thought they were Russian.""""Good night!"" said Jack as he put on a coarse shirt several sizes too large. ""This is no joke at all. Those fellows were laughing a few minutes ago, but they'll laugh worse than ever when they see us.""A trial of the one small window showed that it was not locked. There appeared to be no one outside guarding the exit, and, since the noises in the outer room had ceased, the lads determined to leave by the window. In a short time they again stood outside the house.To make their way back to the field where the Eagle had been left was a short task and quickly accomplished. There they found, to their astonishment, that the two aeroplanes remained in the same position and were apparently unguarded."
"A smile came to Jimmie's lips as he heard the crashing sound that indicated wrecking of the plane. He turned to observe the condition in which he would find the machinery, hoping that it had been damaged beyond repair, or at least so badly damaged that its repair would be a matter of considerable time and effort.As he wheeled he observed that Dave already had turned to look in that direction, and that his face bore a look of astonishment and surprise. Jimmie's own smile died away as the thought of possible injury to the plucky pilot of the craft came to his mind.""That was easy enough,"" replied the other. ""I had observed some bolts through the hub of the propeller. I also had several bullets in my pocket, and a good-sized chunk of lead that had been used for filling some holes in a piece of iron back there in the camp at Peremysl. What could be easier than to take out the loose bolt I noticed and fill the hole plumb full of lead? That was all.""""Don't you think it wouldn't!"" boasted Jimmie, rather proud of the manner in which he had brought about the destruction of the magnificent machine. ""Just you ask some one when you get home. Go to a machine shop and ask 'em what an unbalanced condition will do to a high-speed piece of machinery that isn't firmly fastened to a solid base.""""Well, to be honest with you, I didn't expect that it would. My only thought was to slip out the big bolt, put in enough lead to fill the hole if I had time, and then let the vibration of the unbalanced machine render it impossible for the aviator to steer or handle the plane. I had not figured on anything giving way as it did.""For a moment von Liebknecht paused to look searchingly into the face of the boy. Jimmie returned his gaze unflinchingly. He said afterward that it was quite the hardest thing he had ever attempted, and several times he was on the point of letting his gaze wander. However, he stood the ordeal well and presently heard the other say:""He is not badly injured. A few minor contusions and a scratch or so comprise all his hurts. It is very fortunate, however, for all parties concerned,"" placing peculiar emphasis upon the phrase, ""that it is no more serious. It might mean trouble for some one.""""I sure am glad that the fellow is able to get about,"" was Jimmie's statement. ""He's a plucky chap, and from what I saw of him when he landed he is an expert in the matter of handling the aeroplane. It would certainly be a pity if he should be killed or badly injured.""""The German army would lose one of its very best aviators if he were gone,"" von Liebknecht replied, ""and although the loss of his life would be irreparable, it might be decided to take payment in kind.""""Gee, Bo!"" exclaimed Jimmie as the two lads started for the rear, ""that was some close shave! That fellow has got a suspicioner tucked away inside his brain that is working overtime. Every little thing that happens he thinks is caused by a spy or something like that. I wouldn't have his disposition for a million dollars in Mexican money."""
"Jimmie and Dave had been placed in a compartment at the rear of the coach, together with several of the attaches of the Kaiser's staff. The Kaiser himself occupied a compartment near the forward end, and here he was conducting the necessary details of preparation for the exceedingly strenuous work that lay before the German forces.For a long time the train jolted on. Engines were changed and train crews replaced by others, and still the regiment proceeded westward. The soldiers disposed themselves about the cars in such positions as were possible and slept the tired sleep of overworked humanity.Still the Kaiser and his staff sat and discussed plans and prepared orders for the grave matters confronting them in the western amphitheatre of war. Apparently their endurance knew no bounds. Sleep seemed to be farthest from their thoughts.But at length, wearied from their long vigil and arduous labors, the group were glad to find the Kaiser disposed to snatch a few moments of rest. The maps were folded, the dispatch boxes closed, and all prepared to find positions where they could sleep.And so it was that as the dawn was breaking ruddily in the east Jimmie and Dave were wakened from their sound sleep and informed that their presence was desired in the compartment where the Kaiser waited.The train had slowed somewhat in climbing a grade, and the boys found no difficulty in following their guide. As they proceeded slowly toward the forward end of the coach Dave found a chance to nudge Jimmie.""With the day just opening, like switching on all the electric lights in the world!"" objected Jimmie. ""The intention of the gentleman from Vancouver is excellent, but I'm afraid that his execution of the maneuver would be decidedly rotten. It won't do just now.""""Nothing doing!"" declared Jimmie. ""We're under suspicion already, or I miss my guess. The events of the last few hours are enough to let us know that if we tried anything like that the Germans wouldn't take kindly to any such plan. We wouldn't get very far, I fear.""""Sure I am!"" went on Jimmie reassuringly. ""Just leave it to me, old chap, and we'll grab the first opportunity that comes along with a genuine Frank Gotch toe hold and hang on till we put the German shoulders to the mat for the count. Leave it to me.""At length he looked up and searched the boys carefully with his piercing gaze. After he had apparently taken a complete inventory of the two boys--one in the uniform of his own Uhlans and the other in the uniform of the Boy Scouts--he turned to one of his aides.A tiny glow from the cowl lamp in front of the pilot's position showed Ned that the Eagle was now headed almost directly west, while the indicators showed an altitude of approximately three thousand feet. At a speed approximating forty miles per hour the great bird-like machine winged its way with its burden of adventurers."
"""Tell you what, boys,"" Jack said presently, growing weary of trying to discover features in the obscurity below that covered the landscape, ""this makes me feel just like I imagine that old guy must have felt when he went out after the Golden Fleece or something or other.""""They were going west by train unless Jimmie was greatly mistaken when he gave us those signals from the hilltop,"" said Jack. ""Now, if they got going soon after we dropped Dave into their camp, we ought to be able to see their train soon.""""More than likely,"" said Jack, preparing to shift his position slightly, the better to observe the landscape to the northward, ""it'll be a case of the bear going over the mountain to see what he could see. The other side of the mountain is about all we can discover. In this darkness we can't get much of a view.""""Train nothing!"" declared Jack. ""It's those bloomin' Dutchmen from the village! They've evidently got a supply of gasoline to replace what we stole and are coming up like a greyhound after a rabbit. That's some speedy plane they've got!""""Suppose the railroad is over there to the northward,"" went on Jack. ""In that case, Jimmie and Dave'll be in that direction. Now, by running over that way we can get nearer to them and at the same time discover whether that other machine is following us.""""They're after us as sure as shooting!"" he cried. ""They're cutting across the corner of the angle. That'll give them some advantage. It won't pay us to try any more dodging if we want to outrun them.""""That wouldn't be very profitable,"" Ned argued. ""If we should start anything like that we'd be in all kinds of trouble at once. Our best plan would, I think, be to cut and run for it to the westward. If they're after us and mean to catch us, they would try to follow. Even though this may be an army plane they are using, I believe the Eagle is capable of outrunning them.""""Then here goes for a fast ride,"" declared Jack, reaching for the handle controlling the mixing valve of the carburetor. ""I'm going to slip in a little more air and shove the spark ahead a few notches.""Jack's caution was needed, for the speed materially increased. Ned continued to keep watch with the aid of the binoculars, while Harry scanned the surrounding country in an effort to make out any features that would guide them.""We're leaving them behind at last, boys!"" he managed to shout as he sheltered his head from the stinging blast of air singing through the rigging of the Eagle. ""They're getting smaller in the glasses!"""
"""Suppose we swing round in a big circle and see if we can discover what they are going to do,"" suggested Jack, reaching for the rudder levers. ""If they're going to land and get assistance we ought to know it before it's too late. If they're giving up it'll be all right.""Accordingly Jack shifted the rudders and brought the Eagle sharply about, heading directly eastward again. As the plane proceeded to retrace the course so recently followed the lad brought the machine to a higher level and cut in the muffler, entirely deadening the clamor of the motors. He had been running with the exhaust partly open in order to obtain every bit of the engine's efficiency in the flight.""Ha!"" cried Ned, turning the glasses downward. ""I can see a train standing at a station. The grounds are lighted by shaded electric lights, I believe, and there seem to be soldiers moving about beside the train. I saw a shower of sparks just then that looked as if they came from a switch engine. I'll bet that's a railroad terminal and the train is one moving troops westward from Peremysl to Verdun!""""The chances would be very poor just now, I'm thinking,"" replied Harry doubtfully. ""With all those soldiers there we wouldn't have much of a chance, especially as we are not able to communicate with the boys, even granting that they are on that train.""""You may give your answer to the charges if you desire,"" said the Kaiser in a not unkindly tone. ""But,"" he went on, ""you will remember that if the report of Captain von Liebknecht is at all correct matters look rather unfavorable for you at present.""""I'll admit that latter part without argument,"" said Jimmie, much relieved that he was being given an opportunity to speak. ""Things look rather odd, as you say, but it is only looks. The facts are that we are over in this country on a peaceful mission, and have refused to give information to either the Germans or the Russians. That rather squares the account, doesn't it?""""In a measure, yes,"" admitted the Kaiser. ""But your presence with the Russian troops does not incline us to look with much favor upon yourself or your comrades. Further,"" he continued, ""the fact that your comrades have a high-powered aeroplane in our territory and have tried to rescue you from our regiment appears as if they do not care to be open and frank with us. Can you explain that?""""I think I can,"" replied Jimmie gravely. ""I can see now that our actions would appear rather mysterious to your officers, but you must also remember that they refused to take our word for anything. They simply went ahead and acted on the opinion they received from first sight. Our statements were not given any weight at all.""""It is this little package to which I referred briefly in my statement,"" explained von Liebknecht, producing the packet that had been rescued from the Cossack uniform by Jimmie when Otto had attempted to put the discarded clothes in the fire.""It was given to me by a man who was trying to make money selling munitions to the Russians,"" replied the lad. ""He was a villain if ever there was one. He stole a lot of money in the United States and came over on a ship to Riga. He kidnapped me and had me enlisted in a Russian regiment of Cossacks, where he also found himself enlisted against his will. When an attack was made on a German troop train before the assault on Peremysl he was badly wounded."""
"""Yes,"" went on the boy. ""When he found he was so badly wounded he gave me this packet and asked me to go back to New York, where he had put papers and other things in a safe deposit vault. He wanted me to try to straighten out some of his wrongdoings.""""I rather think you are telling the truth so far as you know it,"" was the answer, accompanied by a smile in recognition of the tribute the lad had paid. ""But,"" he added, ""is it not possible that the man himself may have been telling things that were not so in the hope that the information would fall into the hands of the Russians?""""Yes, sir, we have!"" declared the boy, earnestly. ""We are not at all concerned in the war and we don't wish to become engaged in it. We'd rather not shoot at anybody unless it is necessary to do so for our own protection or the defense of our country.""""Those are very noble sentiments, my lad,"" was the answer to this statement. ""Just yet we cannot give you permission to depart, but we shall not require from you service that you are not able to give.""""But, if you please,"" objected von Liebknecht, with a look of meaning in the direction of his superior, ""the young men may be of great value to us in the future, and I suggest that they be held in reserve for any emergency that may arise.""They were awakened from a sound sleep into which they had fallen to find that the train had made another stop and that the regiment was disembarking. Men and horses were all about the track, baggage was being hastily unloaded and every indication showed that their journey by rail was at an end.""Why,"" went on Jimmie, with just a touch of pride in his voice, ""we were in France with the airship we had built before this present one. We got nicely tangled up with the battling forces and nearly got blown to bits once. We got lost in the fog above the lines where the big shells were flying around like mosquitoes.""""Yes,"" continued the red headed lad, ""we thought once or twice we were goners, but got out after all. The airship lived through all of it and finally was drowned in the North Sea as we were trying to get home. I was certainly sorry to lose that airship.""The boys were not long left in doubt. An officer came toward them apparently in some haste. As he approached he signalled the two to follow him to a position where the Uhlans were mounting their horses.A group of approaching horsemen, at one side of which rode the Kaiser, drew rein exactly opposite the two lads. Jimmie's mount, in a somewhat restive mood, refused to remain standing, but gave the lad some trouble. In his effort to quiet the animal the lad did not notice that he was gradually drawing closer and closer to the Kaiser.Presently he succeeded in quieting the horse and took time to glance in the direction in which the Kaiser was peering through a pair of binoculars. The lad saw stretching far below him a gradual slope that had once been wooded by a forest. Now, however, there stood only the shattered stumps of trees, indicating that the place had been subjected to a most galling fire from the enemy.Had the lads only known how close they had been to being again pursued they might not have felt so easy in their minds, but they assumed that their presence was not known to others than the pilot of the wrecked machine, and therefore felt secure."
"""All right, let's get away from here as quickly as we can. If we hold a course a little south of west we ought to be able to follow the general line of the railroad and be able to overtake or meet Jimmie and Dave before they reach Verdun and are forced into the fighting.""""Not in the least, except that it's cold. But you see that unless we fly lower the first rays of the rising sun will strike us and we can be seen and located by any one on the ground. They will still be in the deep shadow and we will be in the brighter sunlight.""""That's what it is,"" declared Harry, after an extended observation. ""I don't altogether like the looks of the place, for there's a road of some sort running near the woods, but it's perhaps better than no place at all. If we can get to earth without being discovered we can hide behind those trees until dark again.""Lower and lower circled the plane under the guidance of Jack, whose experience in handling the great craft well fitted him for the task. With scarcely a bump the machine rested in a little grade not far from a brook overshadowed by the arching branches of trees.""And I'm glad that we came down when we did, for a little longer up there,"" said Jack, pointing to the graying eastern sky, ""and we'd have been fair targets for any old 'Schutzenfest' these chaps wanted.""""This is a pretty place,"" observed Ned, ""all sheltered and obscure. We ought to be able to get a dandy bath there in that brook and then make whatever breakfast we want off the supplies we got from Peremysl.""Soon the lads had divested themselves of the German uniforms and were enjoying the plunge in the cool, clear water of the brook. Presently they emerged from the stream and again donned the uniforms they had taken from the room that was intended as a prison.""Now,"" said Ned, as the three were again dressed, ""what shall be the menu of the morning? With this glorious sun peeping over the tops of the hills to the eastward of us we ought to have a fine breakfast. The weather looks mighty fine.""""Yes, that's my idea, too,"" said Ned. ""Let's get breakfast and be prepared for whatever may happen. We don't know what may come along so close to the lines as we are now, and we must not be napping.""""Quite the contrary, Jack, as you know,"" protested Ned, laughingly. ""I'm only trying to avoid trouble as much as possible, and a smoke now in this place would be a direct invitation to some one to investigate.""He proceeded to at once prepare the ""stove"" by sharpening a stick about the size of a broom handle. When it was completed he thrust the sharp end into the soft earth and then withdrew it, leaving a hole about a foot or more deep. Another hole was made a short distance from the first, but slanted so that the lower ends would meet. The second hole was plugged up with a bit of turf.Jack meanwhile had returned with the bucket of water and had filled the coffee pot, into which he put a quantity of coffee. This was then placed over one of the ""stoves,"" while on the other was placed a bucket containing a quantity of beans, together with some of the cereal ""sausage"" found amongst the Russian supplies.In a few moments the two were busy at their task selecting two small trees not far apart to act as masts. The equipment that had been stowed in one of the lockers was spread on the grass and they waited for Ned to return from the brook, where he had gone to wash the dishes."
"When Jimmie's toe prodded the Kaiser's horse in the ribs, that animal gave a mighty spring and bounded from his position. Usually a tractable, though mettlesome beast, the horse was greatly surprised at the treatment he was receiving, and it is not surprising that he made every effort to escape the punishment.Before the Kaiser could check the mad rush of his mount and bring the noble animal to a quivering stop, considerable distance had been covered. Jimmie rode on the Kaiser's right Hank, his own horse's shoulder close to the other's saddle. Dave followed immediately behind Jimmie so close that when the halt was made he fairly crowded Jimmie beside the Kaiser. He was still mystified when they stopped.With a face livid with wrath at the treatment, the Kaiser turned toward Jimmie. The next instant he began a forceful speech. It was never delivered. Jimmie slipped from his horse and began to drag the other from his mount. He was too excited for coherent speech.Dave glanced back to see a knot of officers and Uhlans closely packed about the very spot where the three had stood a moment before. As he looked he shivered slightly. A huge black object was hurtling through the air. It landed in the center of the group, bearing down with a shriek of agony a horse and its rider.Instinctively Jimmie and Dave had thrown their arms up to cover their faces. By this means they had protected themselves in a degree from the force of the flying scraps of earth that stormed upon them like hail. They were covered with dirt to a woeful degree.In amazement Jimmie drew back a pace. He grasped the bridle reins of his horse in his left hand. Looking keenly at the mounted man, the lad recognized the fact that his intentions had been misunderstood. Without another word the lad mounted his animal.""I guess we've made break enough,"" replied Jimmie with set jaw. ""Here I go and rescue one perfectly good Kaiser from a dropping shell that he don't see, and now he gets sore at me for doing it. I'm going back to the position where I was ordered to stand, and they can all be shot to pieces next time for all the help they get from me!""Gravely Jimmie returned to the very rim of the crater that had been dug in the solid earth by the bursting of the gigantic shell. Here he halted, drew himself erect in the saddle and waited. Dave drew alongside.Jimmie glanced quickly at the man and discovered him to be none other than von Liebknecht, the man who had been so closely concerned in Jimmie's recent experiences. Not deigning a reply, the lad obeyed. His action was quickly followed by Dave."
"Following an order rapidly given in German, one of the Uhlans urged his horse forward and grasped the reins of the two horses. He fairly jerked the leathers from the hands of the boys and led the two away.""We've committed one of the worst crimes in the calendar!"" declared Dave. ""As I understand it, we've meddled with the person of the Kaiser, and that's only one degree less awful than saying horrid things about him. That's what I've been told, at any rate.""Von Liebknecht began what seemed to the lads to be an apology, but was cut short by the Kaiser, who gave a command in German. Without attempting to complete his unfinished speech, the Captain repeated the command to an aide standing near, and he in turn addressed two Uhlans.""Ha!"" cried Jimmie. ""I know what that means. I've seen a good many signs with that word on it. It means that we are forbidden to walk on the grass, breathe, live, eat, or do anything else without permits.""After about half an hour's walk they found themselves near a building that had evidently been a farm residence. In common with many other rural establishments of Germany, this place had been built with the barns attached to the dwelling house.Into what had been the cow stable the boys were conducted by their guards. A ladder stood in one corner, leading up through a trap door to the fodder loft above. Up this ladder the boys were directed.""Not on your life!"" cried Jimmie heatedly. ""From now on I'm going to make every move in the calendar to get out of this place and away from those Germans. If I ever get back to America I'll never eat another bit of sauer kraut as long as I live!""They lost no time in doubling the line and passing the ends out of the window. The loop which they still held was caught beneath the corners of the window frame so that it would remain in position until the end was loosened by the person descending.Ahead Jimmie could make out the outlines of an aeroplane in an open space. Following Dave's pointing finger, the lad saw a man in Uhlan's uniform rapidly running through the wood in the direction of the barn.Dave quickly unslung the coil of line from his shoulder and proceeded to reeve a slip noose in one end. When he had adjusted the noose to his satisfaction the lad moved silently forward, crouching as he went.Almost as quickly as the task could have been accomplished with a knife Dave had cut off the desired piece of rope with which to tie the captives. In another moment he dashed through the thicket in which the three prisoners were struggling."
"Jimmie, hanging onto the lasso with grim determination and taking in every bit of slack given by the struggling trio, was startled to hear his companion emit a shriek of astonishment. A glance over his shoulder told the lad that something unusual was happening beyond the bushes.""Oh, that reminds me,"" Ned said, halting. ""We were on the track of some fellow who visited our position and took out the spark plugs from our engines. We were following his tracks in the woods when you came.""""Just right!"" declared the lad. ""Dave and I are starved! Just throw us together a little fried ham and some scalloped potatoes, a piece of Yorkshire pudding with some roast beef for Dave, here, and a few loaves of bread with a side of creamed cauliflower and some peas and carrots. Two or three helpings of succotash and some green onions wouldn't go bad either. With a couple of cups of coffee and some chocolate eclairs and a cream puff with a little ice cream and some lemon pie we could manage to worry along until tea time.""""Oh,"" exclaimed Jimmie, with a gesture of disgust, ""we've had nothing else for about four years! I feel just like poor old Ben Gunn in 'Treasure Island.' I'd like a little civilized food--a piece of cheese or something like that. Don't say stew to me or I'll quit you cold.""""Oh, that's quite easy, you know,"" replied the other with becoming modesty. ""I've spent some time in Alberta where there are cattle and I learned to shoot and ride a horse and throw the rope pretty well.""""Agreed!"" announced Jimmie. ""But,"" he went on, ""we're losing time and I'm losing flesh while you argue about it. Leave Dave alone, now. Can't you see him blushing over the praise you're giving him? Let's hustle about and get some eats started. I'm hungry, I tell you!""""This all happened so suddenly,"" said Ned, as the five lay about the fires waiting for the cooking to be finished, ""that I haven't had a chance to ask you a question nor tell you how overjoyed I am to have you with us again. But I'm really delighted. How did it happen?""""Well, they took us with them after Dave knocked over one of their tents,"" began Jimmie, with a sly look at his companion. ""If it hadn't been for that plucky kid over there, I most likely would have lost my temper two or three times and tried to whip the whole German army.""In response to the invitation, Jimmie and Dave together told the story of their adventures since last seeing their chums. Jimmie was in turn told of the exciting scenes through which the three boys had passed, and to him also were made known the circumstances through which Dave had joined the party. As the boys finally drew their narratives to a conclusion, Jimmie, who had followed the tales of his comrades with interest, turned to Ned and said:"
"""Yes and we were compelled to exchange our perfectly good uniforms for some old rags that would disgrace a wharf rat!"" was Ned's indignant response. ""Then we simply took the privilege of putting on these garments. They are not what we would have chosen, but they match yours.""""My post I deserted,"" he began, stepping from the bushes, but with his rifle still cautiously pointed toward the lads. ""This country is familiar to me, for that house was my uncle's. Many times have I in this brook waded and swam. Today I thought of it when we over the hill came and when we had put you in the barn I came right here to see the beautiful brook once more and hear the birds singing in the trees.""""Oh, you shall, shall you?"" almost sneered Jimmie. ""All right, but you wouldn't put us back there hungry, would you? We were just about to eat a little lunch. This won't be quite as good as you used to get at Dick Stein's place, but it's eatable at any rate. If you think you could eat a bit, we'll ask you to join us.""""Why, of course, we are!"" admitted the boy with an attempt at a laugh. ""We're prisoners in more ways than one. You have the spark plugs and we couldn't make a decent get-away if we tried. Besides, you two fellows have your rifles and we are unarmed.""""Sure you have,"" resumed Jimmie. ""Now, I'll tell you what,"" he went on, ""you sit here,"" indicating a position between the fire and the aeroplane, ""and we'll sit on the opposite side of the fire. You may have your rifles across your laps or ready at your side. If we break and run for it, you may shoot as fast as you please.""""See here,"" continued Jimmie, reaching out a hand toward the coffee pot bubbling over the tiny flame and lifting the lid, ""did you ever smell better coffee in your life? That's worth drinking, I say!""""That's a real compliment, Otto,"" laughed Jimmie, winking at Dave as he spoke. ""When a German admits that any other nation on earth can make good coffee it is going some. The Germans can make real coffee!""""We generally let Dave pour the coffee, because he's an extra boy in the crowd and we make the newcomers do all the heavy work, but he's awkward at it yet owing to his just recently coming off a cattle ranch in Canada, where he had to lasso a lot of cattle every day. This time I'm going to pour the coffee myself."""
"""Now, you just sit there, Dave,"" Jimmie chattered on, ""until I tell you to move. Remember,"" he added, ""I'm doing this part of it. All you are to do is to follow instructions. You're better at the lasso than you are at pouring coffee!""""Why,"" cried Jimmie in a surprised tone, ""the pot is almost empty. I guess you boys didn't make very much, did you? Here, Dave,"" he hurried on, ""you chase yourself up to the Eagle and get some of that coffee out of the locker on the right-hand side. We'll brew another pot of it. I haven't begun to eat yet.""Ned and Jimmie rattled on in a whirlwind of conversation to keep the attention of the soldiers in their own direction. So absorbed were Otto and Fritz in listening to the chatter that they failed to hear the faint whistle of a rope through the air, and it was not until the noose of Dave's lasso settled about their shoulders and they were jerked incontinently backward that they suspected anything wrong.""What if they do?"" scorned Jimmie. ""They'll be so busy with all this fighting they won't have time to chase us very far. Hear those cannons going all the time?"" he went on. ""They're wasting a lot of good powder shooting at the Frenchmen and the allies!""""They are all in bomb-proof trenches or else back of the hilltops,"" said Ned. ""I believe that those aeroplanes are scouting around to give word to the gunners whether their aim has been correct or not.""""You speak as if this were a ship in the water,"" responded Ned. ""I want you to understand that this is an aeroplane and that it is performing a most remarkable feat in carrying five boys and two grown men, besides a quantity of luggage and supplies.""""I'd rather not shoot too close to them,"" Ned answered, manipulating the levers and valves in an effort to obtain more speed. ""Perhaps we can run away from both. In that case we won't have to shoot any one.""As he spoke Dave took a quick sight, resting the rifle across the rim of the fuselage. A sharp detonation echoed above the hum of the motors. Dave peered eagerly toward the plane at which he had aimed.""I am sure I winged their propeller!"" declared Dave, gleefully. ""I aimed right at the circle in which the blades travel, and I'm sure I saw splinters from the wooden blades. They're slowing up, too!"""
"""We'll make out all right,"" responded Jack, encouragingly. ""We can take them along with us and when get across the French lines we'll just dump them down as prisoners of war and let them be exchanged.""Presently he saw that unless he fired soon the other would be out of reach, and taking a chance discharged the rifle. As he had anticipated, the bullet went wild and resulted in no damage. Before he could reload and again take aim the other had passed to a point where the upper planes of the Eagle shut off his view.Scarcely had the Eagle swerved sharply from her course before the lads heard a rushing, whistling sound. Far below on the ground a missle fell. A dull boom came up. A cloud of smoke rising from the spot indicated that the missle had been a bomb remarkably well aimed. They realized that only by a narrow margin had it missed them.""I'll tell you what we'll do!"" offered Dave. ""When we get near enough, shut off the engine so it won't make any noise and we'll all shout 'Vive la France!' at him. He'll know then we're not enemies.""With scarcely a bump the Eagle settled to the earth and was at once surrounded by French soldiers, some garbed in the well-known suits and helmets of aviators, others dressed as ordinary infantrymen, while still others wore greasy overalls and jumpers.Jimmie's answer was lost in the roar of exhaust from one of the other aeroplanes parked nearby. All turned in amazement at the noise. With a rush the French plane swept by the group and began soaring into the air. One glance showed the lads that Otto was at the levers.During the brief moment that their attention had been diverted, the Uhlan had taken advantage of their preoccupation and had silently stolen away to the machine whose engine had been left running. Now he was beyond recall, and in a short time would be again on the eastern side of the fighting line, where he would no doubt join his regiment.""And what can I do for you in return for that kindness?"" asked the general without going into the details of the event with which those of our readers who have read the previous volumes of this series are already familiar. ""If there is anything I can do, please command me.""""That can be arranged, I am sure!"" stated the general, heartily. ""But you must be rather hungry. Will you not step into the tent here and have some lunch? You can tell me of your adventures while you eat."""
