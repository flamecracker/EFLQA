passage
"Since the enormous success or our ""Motor Boys Series,"" by Clarence Young, we have been asked to get out a similar series for girls. No one is better equipped to furnish these tales than Mrs. Penrose, who, besides being an able writer, is an expert automobilist. The big maroon car glided along in such perfect rhythm that Cora Kimball, the fair driver of the Whirlwind, heard scarcely a sound of its mechanical workings. To her the car went noiselessly--the perfection of its motion was akin to the very music of silence.Directly following the Whirlwind came another car--the little silver Flyaway. In this also were two girls, the Robinson twins, Elizabeth and Isabel, otherwise Belle and Bess. Chelton folks were becoming accustomed to the sight of these girls in their cars, and a run of the motor girls was now looked upon as a daily occurrence. Bess Robinson guided her car with unmistakable skill--Cora Kimball was considered an expert driver.Sputtering and chugging close to the Flyaway came a second runabout. In this were a girl and a boy, or, more properly speaking, a young lady and a young gentleman. As they neared the motor girls Bess called back to Belle:Cora turned and shook her head significantly when the third car had forged ahead. She, too, seemed surprised that Ida Giles should be riding with Sid Wilcox. Then Bess rolled up alongside the Whirlwind.""Like a dandelion,"" put in Belle, who was noted for her aesthetic tendencies. ""And, precisely like a dandelion, I fancy that machine would collapse without rhyme or reason. Did you every try a bunch of dandelions on the table?""Bent and crippled enameled dishes from the lately fine and completely equipped auto-hamper were scattered about in all directions. Here and there a piece of pie could be identified, while the chicken sandwiches were mostly recognizable by the fact that a newly arrived yellow dog persistently gnawed at one or two particular mud spots.""Oh, forget it!"" exclaimed Bess. ""I am sure I want to. Let's get going again, if we are to make the Woodbine Way in time to plan the tour. I'm just crazy about the trip,"" and the enthusiastic girl expended some of her pent-up energies on the crank at the front of the Flyaway.Cora was also cranking up. ""Yes,"" she said, ""we had best be on the road again. We are due at the park at twelve. I expect Maud will have the family tree along and urge us to stop overnight at every gnarl on the 'trunk.'""""If we had boys along,"" explained Cora, ""they would claim the glory of every spill, every skid, every upset and every 'busted tire.' We want some little glory ourselves,"" and at this she threw in the clutch, and, with a gentle effort, the Whirlwind rolled off, followed closely by the Flyaway."
"""Now for a straight run!"" announced Cora, throwing in third speed. ""We must make the bridge by the quarter whistle or the Maud Morris family tree may have been consumed for luncheon. I particularly want a peg at that tree.""Then the Whirlwind and the Flyaway dashed off, over the country roads, past scurrying chicks and barking dogs, past old farmers who turned in to give ""them blamed things"" plenty of room, out along Woodbine to the pretty little park where the plans for the first official run of the motor girls were soon to be perfected. In the first volume of this series, entitled ""The Motor Girls; Or, A Mystery of the Road,"" we became acquainted with these vivacious young ladies. Cora Kimball, the first to own her own motor-car, the Whirlwind, was the only daughter of Mrs. Grace Kimball, a wealthy widow of the little town of Chelton. Jack Kimball, Cora's brother, a typical college boy, had plenty to do in unraveling the mystery of the road, while his chums, Walter Pennington and Edward Foster, were each such attractive young men that even to the end it was difficult to guess which one would carry off the highest honors socially--with Cora as judge, of course.It was Ed Foster who lost the money, a small fortune, and it was the rather unpleasant Sid Wilcox, and perhaps unfortunate Ida Giles, who finally cleared up the mystery, happily enough, all things considered, although in spite of the other girls' opportune intention it was not possible to reflect any degree of credit upon those responsible for the troubles and trials which that mystery involved.Speaking of the young men, Paul Hastings, a young chauffeur, should not be overlooked. Paul was a very agreeable youth indeed, and his sister, Hazel, a most interesting young lady, with very special qualities of talent and learning.""Among those present"" in the first volume were the attractive Robinson twins, Bess inclined to rather more weight than height, and Belle, the tall, graceful creature, who delighted in the aesthetic and reveled in ""nerves.""Mr. Perry Robinson, the girls' father, was a wealthy railroad magnate, devoted to carriage rides, and not caring for motors, but not too ""set"" to allow his daughters the entire ownership of the pretty new runabout--the Flyaway.Rachel Stuart was a striking blonde, tall to a fault, pink and white to bisqueness and, withal, evidently conscious of her charms. Even while motoring she affected the pastel tints, and this morning looked radiant in her immense blue scarf and her well-matched blue linen coat.""Exactly that!"" admitted Cecilia. ""I have been searching high and low for a cheap and economical rig to drive in, and I have just hit upon this."" She pirouetted wonderfully. ""All ready made--the 'strained' nurse variety, sure enough. How do you like it?""It was a level stretch over the field to the grove. Cora led the way and the others followed. Lunch baskets and boxes were quickly gathered up from the machines, and, with the keenness of appetite common to young and healthy, and ""painful"" to our fair motorists (for Cecilia declared her appetite ""hurt""), the party scampered off to an appropriate spot where the lunch might be enjoyed.""No boys,"" she repeated faintly. Daisy did everything faintly. She was a perfectly healthy young girl, but a little affected otherwise--too fond of paper-covered books, and perhaps too fond of other sorts of romance. But we must not condemn Daisy--her mother had the health-traveling habit, and what was Daisy to do with herself?Although it was high noon, in the grove the heavy spruce and cedar trees darkened the place, and the farther the girls penetrated into the depths of the wood, the deeper did the shadows close in around them. Cora picked up a stout stick as she advanced."
"There, hidden in the thicket near the spring, were discovered Jack Kimball and Walter Pennington, while the chuckles and other noises emerging from mysterious parts of the wood indicated the presence of human beings, although the sounds had a queer similarity to that made by furry beasts.""Oh, Clip! Spare me!"" called Jack, as Cecilia actually undertook to punish physically the offending young man. ""I really did not think you would be scared--in fact, I had an idea you were scare-immune.""""I am,"" declared the girl; ""but the idea of me wasting sympathy! I might have discovered the dead man of all my life-long dreams--had to appear in court, and all the other delightful consequences of finding a man under suspicious circumstances; and there you are not even sick. Jack Kimball, how could you? You might at least have had the politeness to be deadly ill.""Clip was talking earnestly to Jack, Cora was being entertained by Walter, who, at the same time, managed to keep up a running conversation with the group of girls now busy putting away the lunch things.""Say, fellows,"" said Jack suddenly, ""this is all very pretty--the girls, I mean, of course--but does it smite any one of you young rustics that we have an engagement--ahem! At three-thirty, wasn't it?""""Loidies!"" echoed Jack, tilting his cap and striking an attitude appropriate to that assumed by Cecilia. He slipped his arm within hers, and the pair ""strutted off,"" in the fashion identified with the burlesque stage.Jack was fetching Cecilia back. At some secret sign the young men actually took to their heels, and ran away before the girls realized what was happening. But from a distance they waved a cheerful adieu.As Cora had predicted, Maud wanted the stops along the way made at the homes of her various and varied relatives. Daisy feared her mother would insist upon a chaperone, and this almost absorbed Daisy's chance of being eligible. Ray thought the motors should flaunt flags--pretty light blue affairs--but Bess declared it would be infinitely more important to carry plenty of gasoline.""A tornado, likely,"" said Hazel. ""And, oh, dear! this is just about the time that Paul will be bringing the mail over. I am so nervous since his firm undertook the mail route between New City and Cartown. This is such a lonely road for an auto in a storm--especially when every one knows Paul carries the mail.""""Oh, I don't know,"" sighed Hazel; ""but having to manage a car, and be personally responsible for the big mailbag--there is so much important mail between Cartown and New City--I have been nervous about it ever since Paul began carrying it.""Cora laughed heartily. ""Why, you precious baby!"" she managed to say; ""do you think boys of their caliber would tamper with the mail? To say nothing of putting so nice a boy as Paul to inconvenience?"""
"Blinding and brutal, the wind and sand attacked the eyes and ears of the motor girls, in spite of all the hoods and goggles. It was one of those tearing windstorms, that often come in summer, seemingly bent on raising everything on earth heavenward except the sand--that always sought refuge under eyelids--the average grain of sand would rather get in a girl's eye than help to make up a reputable mountain.""Now--now for an adventure!"" whispered Cecilia. ""I can see it through the closed blinds! I see it under the knocker. I feel it in my gloves! Yes, young ladies, there is going to be something doing inside that cottage!""The woman gathered up some sewing from an old-fashioned sofa. Cora saw instantly that the piece of furniture was of the most desirable pattern and quality, an antique mahogany gem of the colonial style.""It is so delightful to meet a lot of healthy young ladies,"" began the woman, betraying a certain culture and unmistakable education. ""I have a little daughter, who is not healthy of body, but her mind is the joy of our lives in this isolated place. She will ask to see you directly, and that is why I tell you of her infirmity. We never speak of it to her--she almost thinks herself in health. I am glad you came--for her sake.""The woman wheeled a child's invalid chair into the room. Sitting in this chair the girls beheld a child--that sort of child which heaven in making a cripple of seems to hold some special claim on. The lines of some amateur poet flashed across the mind of Cora:The girls gracefully acknowledged the introductions. Clip had surrendered--she was ""all eyes on the little girl""; too absorbed to speak. She had left her place on the sofa, and now stood beside the invalid's chair.""Oh, no, indeed,"" said the child sweetly. ""I am perfectly delighted. Mother has been telling me all day we would have some pleasant surprise before night. I thought when I saw the storm coming that that was the surprise--I love storms, grandfather's kind--but now I know it is this.""Her eyes had the same ""unfathomable depths"" that marked those of Mrs. Salvey, but the child did not otherwise resemble her mother. It was evident that the name Wren fitted her well--so small, so sweet, so timid, and with such a whispering voice!Cecilia was fairly ""devouring the child."" The others were plainly much interested. Belle, who evidently regarded the affair as her own particular ""find,"" retained the slim hand of the invalid in that of her own healthy palm. Mrs. Salvey was smiling now--even the great sad eyes were throwing out a light, although the light did come from dark and uncertain depths."
"""This is my promise book,"" she began. ""I have to tell you a long story about it. Then I will ask each of you to make me a promise--it is a very strange promise,"" she intoned most seriously. ""But I know some day it will be kept. Some day all these promises will unite in one grand, great demand. Then Fate will have to answer.""""It's all about grandfather,"" she began. ""I had the dearest, darlingest grandfather, and since he went away I am so lonely. Only for mother,"" she added, with something like an apology. ""Of course, I am never really lonely with mother.""""You see,"" went on Wren, ""we used to live with grandfather in a beautiful cottage right near the river. He was a sea captain, and couldn't live away from the waves. Then I was strong enough to play on the sands.""""I'll hurry,"" promised Wren. ""You see, this is the important part of it all. When we lived with grandpa he made a beautiful table--I even helped him to make it. There were tiny pieces of wood all inlaid with anchors, oars and sea emblems. I used to dip them in the hot glue for grandpa. Well, there were some secret drawers in that table, and grandpa told me that if anything should happen to him we must explore the table. Well, we went away--it was the time of my own father's death--and when we came back the table was gone.""""You see,"" said Mrs. Salvey, ""Wren thinks if we can find that table we will come into our own. Father was very fond of daughter, and the other relatives were so numerous that when the estate was equally divided it left very little for us. We thought the table might contain a will--""""'I, the undersigned, promise most sacredly to do all in my power to help discover the whereabouts of an antique inlaid table that has on either side carved a large anchor, and which has the initials cut on each end, W. S. and R. S.'""Of course you do,"" said Cora, filled with admiration for the mother who so humored the sick child. ""And with all those promises, as you say, they must some day become a great, grand call, and so be answered.""""I really feel that you will,"" declared the child. ""I have never before met such--nice young ladies,"" and she blushed consciously. ""I shall repeat your names many times--so that they will echo when I sleep.""Mrs. Salvey added her felicitations to those of her little daughter. ""This has indeed been a most enjoyable visit,"" she said, ""and I hope you will all try to keep your strange promise. I believe where one is so serious as is Wren something good is sure to result. If we could find that table--"""
"""Perhaps you will,"" said Cora pleasantly. ""We are about to start on a long trip. We will make numbers of stops, and I assure you we will never forget to look for the table. I am sure it will give us a very pleasant duty to keep our eyes open.""""Indeed, it will,"" declared Cecilia warmly. ""I only hope I shall be the lucky one--for I feel a sort of premonition that some one in this party really will be the means of bringing little Wren the good news. I have a mental picture of the table. I shall know it instantly.""""That's Paul!"" shrieked Hazel, turning instantly and dashing off in the direction from which the voice had come. Cora, Bess, Maud and Cecilia followed her. Over the wet fields, through briars and underbrush the girls ran, while the call was repeated; this time there being no possibility of mistake--it was Paul shouting.What a sight! There, sitting on something like a stool, with a big cotton umbrella opened over his head, his eyes blinded with something dark, and his hands and feet made secure, was Paul Hastings, the chauffeur of the auto stage.""Joke!"" he reiterated. ""Well, I should say not! Would you call it a joke to have two masked men jump in front of a running car, and flash something shiny? Then to have them climb in, cover my eyes and tell me I would be all right, and not to worry!""Cora could not but recognize how handsome Paul was. The excitement seemed to fire his whole being, and throw some subtle human phosphorus--a light from his burning brain certainly brightened in his eyes and even in his cheeks. Paul lost no time in reaching Cartown with the belated mail, and so was obliged to leave the girls an the road with scant ceremony, hardly pausing to discuss why he had been bound when no apparent robbery had been perpetrated.Hazel appeared so agitated that Cora insisted upon her returning to the Kimball home to dinner, and also had succeeded in getting a promise from Paul that he would come there as early in the evening as it would be possible for him to do so.Even Hazel laughed. The suggestion called up a picture of the disgraceful Clip in robber uniform, with the proverbial red handkerchief on her head, and all the rest of the disreputable accessories. Clip would ""look the part.""But the Thayer machine was not noted for its beauty or service--it had the reputation of bolting always at the ""psychological moment,"" and when Clip dashed forward to meet her fate, the fate of the Turtle (as her car was called) intercepted her.""Oh!"" exclaimed the girl. ""Isn't this the utmost! And I about to meet my bandit! Now I suppose I will have to leave Turtle here to afford the foe a means of escape. I say, girls, isn't that the utmost?"""
"""Come on, Ray,"" she said to her companion. ""No use sitting there. That car will never, move unless it is dragged. I know her. No use monkeying with tools. When she stops, she stops, and we may as well make up our minds to it.""""No use attempting. I would find the whole thing the matter. Just feel,"" she suggested, putting her ungloved hand on the radiator. ""You could make beef stew on any of her lids. Oh, I know this kind of hot box! I've boiled the water, and the cylinders are stuck.""""That's the reason,"" replied Clip. ""It is almost dark, and I prefer to leave the machine here as a little token of my love to the bandit. Suppose I want to be 'run in' for traveling without a glimmer'?""Cora saw that argument was useless. Reluctantly she turned from the Turtle. Ray climbed in with Daisy and Maud. Bess and Belle were ready to start ""from the seat,"" without cranking up. Cora gave the Whirlwind a few turns.""Hush!"" cautioned Cora, for she felt the possibility of Paul's captors being about still. Then two figures appeared from the sharp turn in the road. Cora wanted to start, but hesitated. The figures came closer. They were those of two well-dressed men; that was easily discernable.Daisy and Maud were walking toward the post office. It was the morning after the adventure on the road, and the two girls had heard from Ray Stuart something of the news they were now discussing. The hold-up of Paul Hastings was to them not so important as the fact that Cecilia Thayer had gone over to Kimball's and actually asked Jack Kimball to take her out Woodbine way to tow home the balky Turtle.But, precisely as her friend had said, Clip was a schemer. In the first place, she had no idea of detaining her companions on the lonely road to ""monkey with the machine,"" so soon after Paul's hold-up. Next, she had no idea of leaving the car there at the mercy of fate. Instead, she deliberately went over to Kimball's after dinner, asked Jack to take her out Woodbine way, and incidentally suggested that he take along a gun. Jack had two good friends, each opposite the other in type. Bess Robinson was very much admired by him; and Cecilia Thayer, she who always played the tomboy to the extent of affording a good time for others when she could actually disguise a serious reason in the joke, she who affected the ""strained"" nurse costume for fun, when it was a real necessity--Jack Kimball liked Cecilia Thayer. Her rather limited means often forced her to make sport of circumstances, but, in every case, Cecilia ""won out."" She was, the boys said, ""no knocker."""
"So it happened as Daisy related. Clip did ask Jack to go with her to fetch home the car. It also happened that they encountered Sid Wilcox on the way. He seemed to be returning alone in his auto from Cartown. Sid told Ida, Ida told Ray, Ray told Daisy and Daisy told Maud.Daisy and Maud were inseparable chums. They agreed on everything--from admiration for Jack Kimball and Walter Pennington, to dislike for Cecilia Thayer, and something akin to jealousy for the Robinson girls. Cora was beyond criticism--they simply ""regarded her.""""I suppose she will have some boys tagging after us on our tour, if her car is fixable,"" went on Daisy in sarcastic tones. ""Likely she will find some excuse for stopping at hotels, and such places. Mother insisted I should not go to any public eating place unless we have some older person along. But Cecilia--she is old or young, just as it suits her.""""Well, I am going to try, at any rate,"" and Daisy Bennet quickened her pace, while Maud Morris hurried along with her companion. It was but a few minutes' walk to the garage, and when the girls reached the entrance they were surprised to find the three automobiles, Jack's, Cora's and the twins' pulled up outside.""Yes,"" answered Clip. ""We are glad you came. Now our meeting is complete. We want evidence. Tell us all you know about the strange men. You had a good chance to observe. You were not in the little quadrille on the road.""""That's it,"" interrupted Jack. ""They were nice men, well dressed. What else do you expect young ladies to observe? Clip, your suspicions are not borne out by facts. Not a girl in the party but yourself saw--what was it? The corner of the missing blue envelope in the upper right-hand pocket--"" The fact that Cecilia Thayer could be old or young, as had been remarked by one of her companions, was not a mere saying. The Thayers were strangers in Chelton, and Cecilia was now only home from school on a vacation. It was generally understood that the girl was not exactly a daughter of the small household, but perhaps a niece, or some relative, who made her home with the people. She never invited her friends to her home, but this was not considered strange, as her means plainly were not equal to the circumstances of those with whom she associated."
"The girl and Jack were well on the road to Woodbine the morning of the little meeting by the garage, when, with a very different expression of countenance to that shown to the party by the roadside, Cecilia grasped at the arm of the young man beside her.""Of course I had no idea of going on the girls' trip. I only went in for the arrangements for the fun of the thing. I seem to need an awful lot of fun,"" she finished with a sigh that ended like a groan.It seemed a long time before Clip reappeared at the door, and beckoned him to come in. Then the room he entered smelled strongly of antiseptics, and the crippled child sat in a chair made sweet and fresh with snowy pillows. Wren had her promise book in her hands. Briefly Cecilia introduced Jack, while the child eyed him keenly, as do those deprived of the usual means of making sure of their friends.For a moment she looked intently at Jack, as if determined to put him on his honor without further explanation. He took her hand and assisted her into the car. As he did so she felt the assurance that Jack Kimball was her friend.Bess Robinson was talking to Cora. Her voice betrayed something other than disappointment. Bess now called Cecilia by her full name--the affectionate ""Clip"" had been laid aside. Besides this she hesitated when Jack's name was needed in her conversation. The fact was perfectly evident. Jack's attention to Cecilia, their runaway ride, and the consequent talk, had rather hurt Bess. Jack had always been a very good friend to her.""Cora Kimball!"" exclaimed Bess. ""You're a perfect baby. Sick relative! Why, every one sickens a relative when they want to go away in a hurry. It might be interesting to know who else has a made-up sick relative who demands, say, Jack's immediate attention.""""Why, Bess! I'm surprised that you should speak so bitterly. You know perfectly well that Jack's going to the races. You heard them make all the arrangements--Jack, Ed and Walter. Besides--"" Cora stopped. She tossed back her pretty head as if too disgusted to speak. She was packing the last of her touring things into the hampers of the Whirlwind. She would have everything ready for the early start next morning. Bess Robinson had run over for final instructions, when Cora announced that Cecilia Thayer could not go with them on the motor girls' tour. This information drove all other details from the mind of Bess. And now Cora was locking her boxes."
"""Oh, I fancy Belle has managed to take along the candelabra. At least, I think I can count on the glass candlesticks. Poor Belle! I wonder will she ever leave off that sort of thing. She cares more or an 'effect' than for a good square meal,"" answered Bess.Bess laughed. Cora turned up the path with her. ""I met Ray,"" said Bess, ""buying a new veil, of course. I would hate to be as pretty as Ray, and have so much trouble to keep up the reputation. That's the worst of pretty girls. They really have to keep pretty.""At precisely eight forty-five o'clock the next morning the Whirlwind drew up in front of the post-office. The start was to be made from that point, and Cora was first to arrive. With her were Hazel Hastings, and Gertrude Adams, a school friend of Cora's.Scarcely had the occupants of the two car exchanged greetings than Daisy Bennet and Maud Morris drove up in the Bennet runabout, called the Breeze. On account of the change of plan, Ray Stuart was to ride with Cora, instead of with Clip, as was at first proposed. Ray met the girls at the post-office. As predicted, she did look like a brand new bisque statue. She wore a soft silk coat, of light green pongee, the same shade hood, over which ""rested,"" one might say, a long white chiffon veil. It reposed on the hood, where two secret pins held it, but otherwise the veil was mingled with Ray's expression and the surrounding atmosphere. The girls sighed as they beheld her. She had been waiting for some minutes in the post-office, and needless to say there were others waiting, too--not altogether engrossed in reading the latest mail.Cora stepped out of the Whirlwind and opened the tonneau door for Ray. Hazel and she were to ride within the car, while Gertrude shared the seat with Cora. Cora wore her regular motor togs. The close-fitting pongee coat showed off well her perfect figure, and with the French bonnet, that nestled so snugly to her black tresses there was no semblance to the flaring, loose effect so common to motorists. She looked more like a Paris model than a girl equipped for a tour. But Cora had that way--she was always ""classy,"" as the boys expressed it, or in perfect style, as the girls would admit.Hazel usually affected strong shades--she was dark and could wear reds and browns to good advantage. It so happened that the motor girls afforded a peculiar variety, no two wearing similar outfits. Timid little Maud Morris was in white, and Daisy was in linen. The Robinson girls wore their regular uniform--Bess in Havana-brown and Belle in true-blue. So it will be seen that such an array of beauty and clothes could not help but attract attention, to say nothing of the several automobiles that made up the procession in front of the post-office."
"Sure enough, there were Jack, Walter, Ed and some others of their chums, piled up on a veritable hay rack, and they wore all sorts of farmer clothes. The hay rack evidently set upon the body of are automobile.The girls had planned to have dinner at a pretty little tea-house on the outskirts of Hollyville. But the boys had no intention of turning back, it seemed, and imagine those boys in the tea-house, kept by a couple of enterprising college girls!""I know that, girlie,"" said Cora with polite seriousness, ""but all troubles are tabooed on this ride, you know. Gertrude,"" to the girl who had been looking and listening, ""I appoint you monitor of this car. The first girl to bring in troubles is to be fined.""The boys had actually ceased their antics for the time, and it occurred to more than one girl that this respite might have been more advantageous if it had been put into operation in the city streets--the decorum was wasted in the woods. But boys have a queer reasoning code--where girls are concerned.Daisy and Maud came next. They had time to jam down the brakes, but it would have been wiser to have dashed through the flock without loss of time, for an angry ram turned as the car slacked speed, and when Daisy and Maud saw him jump toward them, they also jumped out into the gutter, deserting their car.A big, woolly ram leaped up from the midst of the flock, and actually landed in the runaway automobile. The improvised hay wagon was quickly steered to one side, just as Daisy's car, with the horned beast at the wheel, plunged past.A runabout, coming in the opposite direction, and headed straight for the ram, could be seen down the road. The driver was a girl, that was evident, but she was so muffled in hood, veil and cloak that her features were not discernible.The ram evidently saw the other car coming, and tried to leap out, but its fore feet had gone through the spaces between the spokes of the steering wheel. The girl in the runabout was sending her car from side to side, in a frantic endeavor to avoid a collision. It seemed to be a choice with her, whether she should smash into the ram's car, or tilt into the roadside ditch.Suddenly the girl stood up. The eyes of the motor girls and their boy companions were on her. She gave a scream, and then--something happened. From the rear cars came a scream. Then--the Breeze was stopped--the ram was gone, and the runabout was ditched. When all the machines had been stopped there was a wild rush to the rescue--Bess and Belle with Gertrude hurrying back to where Daisy and Maud had been left, while Cora, Ray and Hazel ran forward to the side of the strange runabout. The boys divided themselves--some going in each direction.Jack was not far away, and at his sister's call he hurried to her. Ray had taken Cecilia's head in her lap, while Cora was trying to lift the unconscious girl from her bent-up posture in the narrow, roadside, grass-grown ditch.""Here! Let me lift her,"" commanded Jack, slipping down on the other side into the deep grass and without any apparent effort lifting Cecilia up. With one long step he reached the road. Then for a moment he seemed uncertain--should he lay the girl down, or carry her to a machine?"
"""You happened,"" answered Jack, so dismissing the question. ""Just keep still, and we will have you around directly. This is where you beat the motor girls."" He was now helping her to her feet. ""You may ride back with the motor boys.""Maud was limping, and had Ed's arm. Daisy kept her hand to her face, and she clung to Walter. Hazel flashed a meaning look to Cora. The girls might not be very badly injured, but they needed help--that sort of help.""There! Didn't I tell you?"" said Cora. ""They are actually claiming the glory of the whole thing. I suppose, Walter, you hired the ram to do the proper thing in initiating the motor girls in the art of touring?""""Lose him! Couldn't do that if you chucked him in the mill-pond and let the dam loose on him. Only yesterday the plagued thing went for my wife. Yes, sir, and he 'most knocked her down. When I seed your steam wagons comin' along I knowed there would be trouble. He's that pesky!""""Sell him? What for? To kill folks as try to feed him? I bought him from a fellow who always wore an overcoat, and, bless me, that ram got so used to it if I haven't had to put my ulster on the hottest days this summer to do down to the pasture where he was chewin'.""""So you like the real thing in gloves?"" asked Ed while pulling at the rope. ""Well, I fancy you will make something real--perhaps a robe--for the best record of this trip. Oh, I say, fellows, let's buy the brute, have him done up properly, and offer his coat to the girl who comes home with a record.""Clip insisted upon helping to tie the ram--she declared he had done his share toward making it uncomfortable for her--while Daisy, in her timid way, wanted to do something to the ""saucy thing"" for upsetting her, and Jack suggested that she ""box his horrid ears.""""Too bad, too bad,"" whimpered Jack, who was still pulling at the ram's rope. ""But it was not our fault, girls. Now, Daisy, do you think you can run your machine without taking in any more circuses? We have examined your car, and it is intact--not so much as a footprint did the naughty beast leave."""
"Clip was looking over her runabout. It was not damaged, it seemed, and for this she was most grateful. Clip was not out for pleasure--you have guessed that--and it would have been highly inconvenient for that young lady to go back to town in the hay.""You!"" she exclaimed. ""Why, Jack Kimball, what are you thinking about?"" and she laughed airily. ""If you want to finish the impression we started the other day, just take another ride with me. No, Jack, my dear boy, I am very much all right, and very much obliged. But I must hurry off. Whatever will my little brown Wren think of me?"" She stepped into the car. ""Good-by, girls,"" she called. ""I am so sorry I delayed you, but so glad we met. Take care of the ram, boys, and am I eligible for the trophy? I am a motor girl, you know.""""Why, our strange promise,"" put in Maud, who was glad to have a ""real remark"" to make to Ed. ""We promised a little girl we would find an old table for her and we have just ransacked the farmer's house, hoping to find it.""""Thanks,"" said Hazel. ""Cora,"" she began again, ""Ed told Jack that the papers lost from the mail belonged to Mr. Robinson, and have to do with a very valuable patent. Do you suppose the post-office will do anything to Paul?""Gertrude blushed. She had only met Paul once, and at that time her remark was so positive that Cora had seized the opportunity of teasing the girl. That she never noticed boys was Gertrude's claim at college, and now Cora was delighted to have a chance of reversing the claim.""It was dropped on the road. I thought of course it belonged to some of the girls, and just threw it in my car in a hurry when you called to us to hasten along,"" said Daisy, her voice sharp and eyes flashing.""Don't worry. Tillie will keep things hot, if she possibly can do so. But I hear they have had some very busy days at the Grotto. I hope we have not hit upon the very busiest. Gertrude, have I told you about the Grotto? Did you know that Mathilde Herold and Adele Genung are keeping a tea-house this summer, to earn enough money for their senior year? And they have done surprisingly well. Yes, their folks have a summer place near the tea-house, so the girls go home nights, and of course the place must be very pretty--Tillie is an artist in decorating."""
"""Splendid!"" exclaimed Gertrude. ""Of course I know Tillie. What girl at Springsley doesn't know her? She has been decorating for every affair at the gym. And she always helped with chapel. Oh, yes, indeed, Cora, I agree with you, Tillie Herold is an artist.""""That's Adele,"" replied Cora. ""She knows how to wave aprons. Don't you remember, Gertrude, the night she served the Welsh rarebit, when she made an apron of our best table-piece with a string through the middle?""""Oh, what a charming place!"" exclaimed Belle, who was not slow to observe the attractions of the little Grotto. It seemed all porch and vines, one of those picture places, ample for an eating house, but unsuited for anything else.The cars were all motionless now. Cora and Gertrude had already ""escaped"" from the college hug of Adele and Tillie. When the Chelton girls had been introduced, the vine-covered porch was actually filled with the members of the motor party.""And we have been waiting lunch for you ladies. I did hope we would not have a single visitor to-day, so that we might entertain you properly,"" went on Adele, ""but two horrid men called. Wanted 'tea'; but indeed I know what they wanted--just a quiet place to talk about their old patent papers.""If, as is claimed, the mature woman has the wonderful advantage of an instinct almost divine, then the growing girl has, undoubtedly, the advantage of intuitive shocks--flashes of wireless insight into threatening surroundings.Cora sank down into a low wicker chair. Bess and Belle managed to both get upon a very small divan, while Daisy, Maud and Ray, the ""three graces,"" stood over in the corner, where an open window let in just enough honeysuckle to sift the very softest possible sunshine about the group.But Hazel lingered near the telephone. She had confided to Cora that Paul was not at all well when he left home in the morning, and just now she was wondering if it would seem silly for her to call up the Whitehall Company and ask to speak with her brother.But it was Cora Kimball who was distracted, who played with her lunch without apparent appetite, and it was she who could take but one cup of tea in the fascinating little tea-house, the college girls' Grotto. ""Now, Cora, dear,"" began Gertrude, in her quiet, yet convincing way, ""you may just as well tell us what you are waiting for. We are guessing all sorts of things, and the truth cannot possibly be as bad.""Hazel was almost feverish. Cora had not divulged the purport of the telephone message, beyond admitting it was from Ed, which gave Ray the chance for her little joke on the combination of names--Cora and Ed, the ""Co-Eds.""""Oh, Daisy, dear, I had no idea of insinuating such a thing. Your machine, of course, is just as trustworthy as any of the others. But I was thinking how delightful it would be to spend the night here. I really must confess to being broken up by that ram accident,"" and Cora shivered slightly."
"""Oh, if there is going to be real distress about it,"" said Cora, evidently trying hard to pull herself together, ""I suppose we had best start. But remember, I have warned you. I have a premonition that we will 'run up against' something before night.""A distant ""honk-honk"" startled the girls. Cora rushed out to the road, and before the others knew what she was about she was in conversation with Ed Foster. So quickly did he run up to the Grotto in Jack's car that no one but Cora realized who he was until the machine was stopped and he was out beside her. There was a stranger with him--a business-like looking man. He did not leave the car.The girls glanced from one to the other. They understood this was an emergency, that Hazel had been called back to her sick brother, yet with girlish curiosity some of them, at least, showed surprise that Hazel should offer to ride back with Ed Foster.""It is like a double robbery,"" he said after exchanging some preliminary remarks, ""and the child is disconsolate. Her mother is sure it was not stolen, but lost, while we feel otherwise. It seems there is a handsome young man, a cousin of the child's, interested. His father is a lawyer--the lawyer who has the case against Mr. Robinson. Now this book--the promise book--contained the names of those who visited the cottage on the day that the papers were taken out of the mailbag. It is comparatively easy to guess the sequence.""""Yes, and more than that. They would obtain valuable information from that little book--a clear description of the missing table. If they can find it they will be able to keep the property where it is now--in the possession of Rob Roland, Wren Salvey's rival cousin.""""Why, she has been on very intimate terms with the Salvey child, and lawyers devise all sorts of schemes, you know, to meet their own ends. It was hinted that Miss Thayer might know where the missing promise book was.""Ed Foster stood up every inch of his height. He was always tall, but now, facing the girl whose name he had so vehemently spoken, he seemed a veritable giant. Cora wanted to be firm; she meant exactly what she said when she declared she would abandon the tour of the motor girls, and go back to Chelton to help Cecilia Thayer out of her difficulty.""Besides,"" he pressed, seeing, in, Cora's eyes, his advantage, ""I feel I can do more alone. I have got to take Hazel back to her brother, then I promise you I shall not rest until I have found Clip, and made sure of her exact situation.""Ed turned away to hide his own tell-tale face. He knew perfectly well that Jack was implicated, knew that Rob Roland had deliberately accused him of taking Cecilia Thayer out to the Salvey cottage for the purpose of gaining possession of the promise book. For this very reason Ed wanted Cora to go on--to escape, if possible, the anxiety she must experience if she should have to know the real story.""Tillie,"" she said suddenly, ""couldn't you and Adele shut up shop for a week and come with us? You have been working hard all summer, and you have made up the required pennies. Now, don't you think it would be perfectly splendid to take the run with us?"""
"Every one instantly agreed that this would be the very thing, and in spite of the hesitation of Adele and Tillie, who argued that it might not be agreeable to bring strangers into the homes where others had been expected, it was finally settled that the party should wait until the next morning, when the tea-house girls would be ready to start off with them.Then Cora had messages to send. She called up Jack, but only got the maid in answer. She called up Walter, and he also was out. Finally she called up Ed. She waited until she felt he would be at his dinner quarters, and she was not disappointed in getting his own voice in reply.He told her that everything was all right--that Clip was with little Wren, who had been very ill since the loss of her book, and that Paul Hastings was no worse. This last Cora considered evasive, but had to be content, for Ed would give no more definite information.Such demands as were made upon that little tea-house telephone that evening! Every one of the girls called up her own home, besides calling up many relatives at the other end of the line, those with whom the tourists expected to visit during the trip.""Do let me keep shop for a while,"" begged Cora. ""I would just love to be in real business. Mother declares I have a bent for trade. Let me try, Tillie, while you and Adele go over to the cottage and get your things together.""Thus it was that one hour later Cora Kimball was left the sole possessor of the Grotto; every other motor girl managed to either go for a walk, or go with some one who wanted to take a walk, but Cora was glad--she felt the need of rest which only solitude can give.She sat on the porch; the gentle evening breeze made incense through the honeysuckle. It was delightfully resting; she could hear the voices of the girls in the meadow, after cowslips, buttercups, daisies and clover. They would fetch back a huge bunch, Cora knew, and they would discard them at the steps of the Grotto, as most girls do--run wild for wild flowers, then toss them away when the run is over.Cora felt she should not betray the least nervousness, for, though Rob Roland was known to be a gentleman, he might take advantage of her helplessness to gain from her some information. Ed had warned her to beware of him.""Rob Roland,"" she said calmly, ""my friend, Miss Thayer, is not only a lady, but she is also a student of human ills. She has been interested in little Wren that she might be cured. It appears that some of her relatives consider her incurable.""""Cured!"" he sneered. ""That misfit made right! Why, she has only a few months to live. Your friend is very foolish. She should put her energy on something worth while. And she should be careful how she handles their property. That scrapbook, for instance."""
"""Oh, my!"" The fellow sank deeper into his linen coat. ""I had no idea of your dramatic powers, Miss Kimball. I beg a thousand pardons. I never dreamed that the Thayer girl was so close to you. In fact, I rather thought you merely took her up out of charity. Every one in Chelton knows that the Thayers are just poor working-people.""""Mr. Roland,"" she said, in her own inimitable velvet tones, ""you are making a very great mistake. If you really believe that Cecilia Thayer had anything to do with the loss of that child's book, you are wrong; if you think she had any other than humane motives in visiting the child, you are wrong again. Cecilia Thayer--""""Oh, now come, Cora,"" he interrupted. ""You don't mind me calling you Cora? I know the whole scheme. Your brother Jack is--well, he is quite clever, but not clever enough to cover up his tracks."" He grasped Cora's arm and actually dragged her to him. ""Don't you know that Cissy Thayer and Jack Kimball are suspected of abduction? That Wren Salvey has been stolen-stolen, do you hear?""""Cora! Oh, Cora! We had the most darling time,"" Bess was bubbling. ""You should have been along. Such a dear old farmer. He showed us the queerest tables. And he had the nicest son. Cora-- What is the matter?""""Oh, just an autoist,"" replied Cora indifferently. ""I did not take the trouble to brew tea for one solitary man."" The color was coming back into her cheeks now, and with the return of animation her scattered senses attempted to seize upon the strange situation.""Now drink every sip of this,"" commanded Adele, as she turned on the lights and fetched Cora a steaming cup of the very best Grotto Hyson. ""There is nothing for shaken nerves better than perfectly fresh tea, and, you see, we make it without soaking the leaves."""
"Gertrude understood. She had not been a roommate with Cora Kimball for two years without knowing something of her temperament. She pressed her friend's hand gently, then said loud enough for the others to hear:""We will soon have to get our machines under cover. Tillie says her grandfather has all sorts of sheds over around his country place. In fact, he has a regular shed-farm. Cora, I am just dying to try running a motor. Would you trust me to get the Whirlwind in the shed safely?""""Is not a prize-package machine,"" interrupted Gertrude. ""All right, Cora. I will humbly take instructions. Come along, girls. It will be dark directly, and then we might have to waste time lighting the lamps.""Presently all except Cora and Adele were attending to the cars. Cora was just about to call up her own house when the tinkle of the telephone bell startled her. She picked up the receiver and was not surprised to find the party inquired for was herself.""Oh, easy there, now, sis,"" and Cora thought she had never before appreciated the value of a real brother. ""I can't answer everything at once, although I can come pretty near it. First, I am here--at home. Next, Clip is here--at our home, and third, the other party--I won't mention names--is here also.""""Well, he did have quite a time, but is improving. Say, Cora,"" and the voice was subdued, ""don't call us up until you hear from me. I can't explain now. But where shall I write--say in two days' time?""""Yes,"" rejoined Daisy, throwing in the second speed, ""it always makes me feel like a human rain-barrel. I want to go out in a great, big field, and sit down in a lump. Then I want to throw back my head and open my mouth very wide. That is my idea of drinking in the fresh morning air.""Cora tried her best to be cheerful. She had definite ideas about a friend's duty to a friend, and no one could say she failed in that duty. Why should she think of Jack and Clip and Wren when she was captain of the Motor Girls' Club, and they expected a good time on their initial run?"
"""And we never could have had all our camping things,"" put in Gertrude. ""I am just dying to get out on the grass and light up under the kettles. That was a very bright idea of Adele's to fetch along part of the tea-house outfit.""""Won't it be jolly to build miniature caves to keep the wind from the lamp?"" suggested Cora. ""I tell you, after all, the motor girls were poor housekeepers--we had to take lessons from our business friends.""A cloud fell over Daisy's sensitive face. ""I must telephone to papa that I am all right,"" she remarked. ""Aunt May expected us last night, and if you girls do not want to come, Maud and I will go. We can meet you farther on.""""And that's the very man we met on the road the day Paul was help up,"" Cora declared. ""Oh, now I see the coincidence. Of course they heard of the hold-up, they being on the road about the time it happened, and when they were at your house they might have been discussing the latest account of the affair--there was something in the daily paper about it, you know.""Cora was not sure she believed herself, but at the moment she decided it would be best for the happiness of the party to think lightly of the meeting with the strange men. Rob Roland's voice still rang in her ears like a threat, and while she was no coward neither did she invite trouble.There seemed now to be clearly some connection between the missing papers from the mailbag and the missing promise book, but of the two Cora's girlish heart considered the loss of the book the more serious.""Did you ever see such old-fashioned houses in all your born days?"" asked Bess. ""Look at that one over there. If our table is not in that house, then we had better abandon the antique and look in some new, first-class hotel.""Out on the broad veranda stood a young man--plainly a professional, for while at a glance a girl might decide that Duncan Bennet was ""up to date,"" still there was about him that disregard for conventionality that betokens high thinking, with no room for the consideration of trifling details of every-day life.He stepped lightly into the apartment. It was plainly furnished, with a keen appreciation of what was needed in a sick room, and what should be left out of it. Jack sank into a steamer chair beside the white bed.""I hope so,"" replied Jack, ""but you know she is very busy, and may not get here. But if she does not""--noting the child's disappointment--""she will surely come to-morrow. She telephoned so last night.""""Out in my chair, with mother. I asked a little boy along the road to hand me some flowers, the book slipped back of me, and, as mother wheeled me along, I could feel that it was all right. When we got home it was gone."""
"""Yes,"" she said with hesitation, trying to recall that day's momentous happenings; ""there were two people. They were strangers. I think they had been in an automobile, for the girl was dressed like a motor girl, and the young man wore a long duster.""""Why, yes. The girl sat down on the roadside, and mother stopped my chair. Let me see; I think mother went into the little candy shop and left them with me. They were very pleasant. I am sure they would never touch my book.""""Why, I thought you knew that,"" replied Wren. ""But I did not see the book after they signed, so I do not know their names. You see, mother was in a hurry, and they just gave me the book and--Oh, what could have become of my precious book!"" she broke off, her voice like a cry from her very heart.""Well, now there!"" soothed Jack. ""I knew I should not have distressed you about it. But, you see, I had to know, else I could not find it. Now I feel I shall have it back to you in jig time. Brace up, little girl""; and he tried to impart both courage and hope by his manner. ""Don't you know you are sure to get some wonderful blessing for having to stand this loss? That's Cora's pet theory. She almost drives a fellow after trouble declaring he will find joy at his heels.""""She'll be home soon, all right,"" replied Jack, who was now standing at the door, ""and when she does come we will all know it. Cora Kimball is a brass and a lawn mower, rolled into one piece. You should be glad she is away,"" he finished, his words actually accusing himself of falsehood. Meanwhile, at another bed of sickness sat a girl pale and wan from nights and days of anxiety. Hazel Hastings had left the motor girls' tour and hurried to her sick brother with more apprehension stirring her heart than the report of his actual condition warranted. Paul had always been subject to peculiar spells--shocks they were termed--but Hazel knew what collapse meant, or what it might mean, unless--""Now you must not think of that, you know, Paul,"" commanded the girl gently. ""If you are to grow strong enough to go and take your own part you will have to leave the others alone. There is nothing new, or I should have told you."""
"Hazel Hastings went to the dresser and slipped under the cover a piece of yellow paper. Paul was getting better, and he should not see Mr. Robinson's check for money, which that gentleman had insisted upon leaving for the sick boy's expenses. They were not poor, neither were they rich, but Paul Hastings should not want for anything through his sister's pride.It was Clip who entered the room, but what with her buoyant, happy way, and the great bunch of flowers she carried, one could hardly be certain it was only a girl--it might have been some fairy of sunshine.""Well!"" she exclaimed, glancing from Paul to Hazel. ""You are better, Paul. Has Hazel been treating you again with some of her magic suggestion business? At any rate, I cannot deny its power."" She flittered over to the bed and playfully buried Paul's face in the bouquet. ""There! Aren't they splendid? And you would never guess who sent them. Guess, Hazel.""""Neither do I,"" she replied promptly. ""That is precisely why I am so nice to him. I have to keep friends with him just now. And I have not the slightest doubt his motive is identical with my own."" She paused to laugh indifferently, then she tossed aside her dust coat and stood revealed in spotless white linen. ""How do you like me?"" she asked, straightened up to her short height. ""Am I not a full-fledged 'strained' nurse, now? You know I am summoned to court this afternoon, and all the papers will describe me.""""Yes,"" she went on. ""You see, Mrs. Salvey has been called to account for Wren--did you ever hear of anything so ridiculous? Those lawyer relatives of hers pretend to believe that Wren is being neglected because we have taken her away from the supposed care of that absurd doctor. Well, I just told Mrs. Salvey to answer the summons and go to court. It will be the best thing that ever happened to have her get her real story before the public.""""And my friends will all fall dead."" Cecilia did not appear worried at the prospect. ""Well, I shall say I am not as old as some girls, and that I am engaged in being a member of the Motor Girls' Club."""
"""Indeed, I am not the least bit afraid that I shall lose the friendship of Cora and her brother. Even Walter and Ed will think it jolly to have kept up the joke. Of course""--and she hesitated--""some of the others--""She placed the bouquet on the small table near the window. ""There; I guess the flowers will not contaminate us. But when he gave them to me--or, rather, sent them, there was a note in the box,"" she added.""Yes,"" replied Clip. ""Would you like to hear the note?"" She took from her pocket a slip of paper. ""It always strikes me as odd that people who try hardest to do one thing, and mean another, fail utterly to hide the intention. Now this gentleman, who writes with such solicitation about Wren, says he really misses seeing her, declares frankly that Jack Kimball and I were seen to smuggle her off in Jack's auto, and then-- But let me read the finish. I am spoiling the effect:""'Of course you have the child safe,'"" she read, ""'and no one questions your ability to care for her. All the little clandestine trips which you and your friend made to the Salvey cottage happened to have been observed.' Just hear the boy! Happened to have been observed, when I knew he was watching--saw him on more than one occasion."" She turned over the page of business letter paper, and continued:""Now do you see what that means?"" asked the girl. ""He is trying to make me feel that it would be better to produce Wren than to keep her away from the lawyers, because it looks 'odd.' Well, I'll take my chances on the odds,"" she said with a laugh; ""and Wren Salvey will be 'produced' when I am sure that the motor girls' strange promise will be kept. We have those smart men just where we want them now, and if they want Wren they must give us that table.""""I am not so sure of that,"" responded Clip, putting away the paper and preparing to place upon the center table some of the contents of her satchel. ""But I do know that this man, Reed, is Mrs. Salvey's second cousin. She told me he was always interfering between Wren and the popular grandfather. Now, if the table contained the will, as Wren declares, and if that same table was sold at auction, by this man, Reed, or through his management, it seems more than likely that he could trace it.""""Bright boy!"" declared the girl. ""That only goes to show, Hazel, that when a girl gets a thought she stops. When a boy gets one he looks for another. I think now that perhaps the old table is safe in some unthought-of place, and that perhaps--"""
"""That is why they wanted to get the promise book, to find if any clue to its whereabouts might be within its pages,"" put in Hazel. ""Well, I know that Cora Kimball will find that table if it is in any house around here. She vowed when she started out she would either bring back the table or acknowledge herself beaten. The latter possibility is actually beyond serious attention.""""Whew!"" Paul almost whistled. ""But our little sister is progressing. Talk about professions, Clip. I rather fancy there will be more than one to report at the final meeting of the Motor Girls' Club."" It was Duncan Bennet who suggested the auto meet. The town of Breakwater had never gone beyond the annual dog show, and this progressive young man confided to his cousin Daisy that on a certain day next week he expected several of his friends from out of town, who were sure to come in autos, and:""Why not tell them to 'slick up' their machines, and you girls could do the same? Then, oh, then!"" he exclaimed, ""we could run a real up-to-date auto meet. I can round up fifteen machines at least. And the girls! Why, the fame of the motor girls will then be assured. You will actually have to appoint a press agent.""The cousins were strolling through the splendid gardens of Bennet Blade, as Duncan called the long, narrow strip of family property that, for years, had been famous for its splendid gardens, not flower beds, but patches of things to eat.That settled it. Duncan Bennet went straight to his room, scribbled off a number of notes, threw himself astride his horse Mercury (called Ivy for short), and was on his way to the post-office before Daisy had time to stop the exclamation gaps in the girls' faces with the correct answers to their varied questions.There was a visit to be made at a ruins in Clayton; this was an underlined note of Ray's on the itinerary. Then Maud wanted so much to see a real watering place in full swing. This was put down as Ebbinflow, and would take up at least an entire afternoon. Tillie had a craze for antiques, and there was a noted shop only twenty miles from Breakwater. So when Cora facetiously suggested that the party start out from a given point, go their separate ways and get back to Chelton for the auto meet, the girls realized that they would have to ""boil down their plans"" to fit the time allotted for the tour.The trip to the Clayton ruins occupied a whole day. The girls started early and took their lunch, which Bess said would be eaten in a crumbling, moss-covered and ivy-entwined tower. The ruins fully came up to expectations, and the girls, leaving their machines at the roadside, began their explorations.""Come on!"" cried Ray. They gathered up their skirts and were hurrying from the old room into which they had penetrated when the leaves rustled still more, and from them came a tiny snake. There was a chorus of screams and Cora found herself alone in the ruined chamber. She was pale but resolute as she followed her companions sedately."
"""No indeed,"" she answered. ""I prefer a live and seeable snake to some haunting, unseeable rumor that only appears on dark nights. But let's get out into the sunlight and admire the ruins from a better perspective. Besides it's getting near lunch time.""It was more reassuring out of doors, they all admitted, and after admiring the picturesque remains of what might have been either a church or fort as far as appearances now went, they got the hampers from the cars and feasted. Then, sitting in the shade, they discussed many things until lengthening shadows warned them that it was time to go.Maud was enchanted with Ebbinflow. She declared the watering place was a perfect fairyland, but some of her companions hinted that it was the style of the gowns that attracted her. Still they spent the best part of a day there, enjoying the bathing and coming back in the cool of the evening much refreshed.A delightful fancy dress ball was given that evening at the girls' club, where our friends stopped, and this made a pleasant break in the tour and a welcome relief from spark plugs, carburetors and the cranking of motors, much as the girls had come to care for their cars.Two days more were spent in visiting well-known places of interest, and on one trip Maud and Bess, who managed to slip away from their companions, went through several old farmhouses in search of the table. Once they had hopes that they were on the track, as an elderly woman declared she had just what they were looking for, but it proved to be far from it, though she was anxious to sell it to them.Next morning Tillie declared it was her turn to say where the trip should be, and she picked out an exclusive antique shop, about twenty miles from Breakwater, in which direction the cars were soon speeding.""Well, I do hope if you can't get a pan that you'll not load us up with lead pipe and such stuff,"" said Cora with a laugh. ""I remember very well that last day at school when you came back from Beverly. My, what a sight you were! What did you ever do with the junk?""Ray was as pretty as ever, Maude just as sweet and Daisy just as gentle, while Cora and Gertrude had added new summer tints to their coloring. Adele and Tillie were still bubbling over with enthusiasm, the twins were exceptionally happy, the morning mail having brought good news--so that all were ""fine and fit"" when they started on the ride to the antique shop.But the motor girls were now accustomed to being stared at; in fact, they would have missed the attention had they been deprived of it, for it was something to have a run with all girls--and such attractive girls.""Let me right out of your machine, Bess Robinson,"" joked Ray. ""I have had all I want of 'feelings' since we started on this trip. I rather think the one where the goat or sheep or whatever it was did the actual 'feeling' was about the 'utmost,' as Clip would say. Poor Clip! I wonder what she is about just now.""""Well,"" objected Bess, ""it would be hard to understand any one who is only in Chelton two months at summer. If you were at school all year and came home for new clothes, I fancy I would scarcely understand my own twin sister.""""Strange,"" went on Ray, ""that boys always so well understand a girl of that type. Now I do not mean that in sarcasm,"" she hurried to add, noting the impression her remark had made, ""but I have always noticed that the girls whom girls think queer boys think just right.""The machines were running along with remarkable smoothness. The Flyaway seemed to be singing with the Whirlwind, while Daisy's car had ceased to grunt, thanks to the efforts of the workman at her aunt's place."
"The proprietor was outside on a feeble-looking sofa. As Cora predicted, he evidently was honored with the trio of cars that pulled up to the narrow sidewalk. Tillie, with the air of a connoisseur, stepped into the shop before the little man with the ragged whiskers had time to recover from his surprise.With the same thought uppermost in their minds, Bess, Belle and Cora were soon busy examining the old furniture. There were many curious and really valuable pieces among the collection, for this man's shop was famous for many a mile.""Oh, there is one--some place,"" replied the man, little dreaming what a tumult his words were creating in the brains of the anxious motor girls. ""And when I get an order I always get the article. I shall have a warming pan for this young lady by to-morrow noon.""""Oh, no, miss,"" and he shook his head with importance. ""You do not understand the trade. That would be a duplicate, and in furniture we guarantee to give you an original--I can only get one seaman's card table, and that is ordered.""Cora smiled and walked off a little to gain time, and to think. Her manner told the girls plainly not to mention the matter. She would act as wisely as she was capable of doing. She overhauled some blue plates and selected a pair of ""Baronials.""Adele and Tillie had piled up quite a heap of brass and copper, and, unlike Cora, they argued some about the cost, but finally compromised, and put the entire heap into an old Chinese basket which the man ""threw in.""""Not exactly that kind,"" answered the man. ""But something very much handsomer, I assure you. If you will call in a day or two I will show you something unmatched in all the country. A house has just sold out, and I have bought all the mahogany.""She had advised the mother to go to court to account for her own child, a most peculiar proceeding, but one insisted upon by a well-meaning organization, the special duty of which was to care for children. What sort of story Mrs. Salvey's relative may have told to bring such a course about, neither she nor Cecilia knew. But at any rate a private hearing was arranged for, and now Cecilia was on her way to fetch the widow to town.Driving leisurely along, for the Turtle could not be trusted to hurry, Cecilia had ample time to plan her own course of action, should the judge insist upon having Wren shown in court. This Cecilia felt sure would be dangerous to the extremely nervous condition of the child, and it was such a move she most dreaded.""I will call Dr. Collins,"" thought Cecilia, ""and have him state the facts, if necessary. But then I would have to give an account of my own part,"" came the thought, ""and that would mean so much to me just now.""""And I, too, was going to fetch her. She is quite in demand, it seems,"" and he stretched his thin lips over his particularly fine teeth in something like a sneer. ""I wish I had known you were coming out; I should have invited you to ride with me."""
"""Paul is almost better,"" replied Cecilia, making an effort to get out of talking distance. But he knew exactly why she sent her machine ahead, and while too diplomatic to actually bar her way, he, too, opened the throttle to increase the speed of his car.He glanced at her with a look that meant she would make a picture. And in this, at least, he was honest, for the girl was certainly attractive in her linen coat, her turn-over collar and her simple Panama hat. She looked almost boyish.""Just as you like,"" he said, tossing his head back defiantly, ""but you know it would look better. Oh, we know perfectly well where Wren is,"" he sneered, ""and if you go to see her this afternoon I am going, too.""Mrs. Salvey stepped into Cecilia's car. Her face was whiter than the widow's ruche she wore in her black bonnet. She trembled as Cecilia took her hand. What if she were making a mistake in trusting so much to this young girl, and so defying her antagonistic relatives! What if they should attempt to prove that she was not properly caring for her child! And if they should take Wren from her!""After I have had a chance to say a word or two, you may get out if you like,"" replied Cecilia hastily. ""But I must caution you not to mention where Wren is, no matter how they press you. If they insist upon knowing I shall call Dr. Collins. That is the most important thing. Next, don't tell who were the last persons who signed the promise book. Now, you may get out and make a joke of it. I will trust to luck for the rest."" Judge Cowles was a gentleman of what is called the ""old-fashioned"" type. He was always gentle, in spite of the difficult human questions he was constantly called upon to decide, and which necessarily could not always be decided to suit both parties involved in the legal dispute. But when Mrs. Salvey walked into his room and took a seat beside Cecilia Thayer he started up in surprise. He had known Mrs. Salvey long ago, when she lived by the sea with her father-in-law, Captain Salvey. Many a time had judge Cowles ridden in the little boat that the captain took such pride in demonstrating, for the boat was rigged up in an original way, and the captain was choice about his companions.A man of extremely nervous type, who continually rattled and fussed with the typewritten pages he held in his hand, represented the Children's Society. Evidently he had prepared quite an argument, Cecilia thought. Close to him sat Rob Roland, and the stout man whom the motor girls had met on the road after the robbery of the mailbag. Cecilia recognized him at once, and he had the audacity to bow slightly to her.There were one or two young fellows down in the corner of the room, sitting so idly and so flagrantly unconcerned that Cecilia knew they must be newspaper men--time enough for them to show interest when anything interesting occurred."
"The case just disposed of--that of a small boy who had been accused of violating the curfew law--was settled with a reprimand; and as the crestfallen little chap slouched past Cecilia, she could not resist the temptation of putting out her hand and tugging pleasantly at his coat sleeve.""You'll be a good boy now,"" she said, with her most powerful smile. But the agent of the Children's Society, he with the threatening papers in his hand, called to the boy to sit down, and the tone of voice hurt Cecilia more than the insolent look turned fully upon her by Rob Roland.The judge was ready for the next case--it was that of the Children's Society against Mrs. Salvey. Cecilia could hear the hum from the newspaper corner cease, she saw Mr. Reed, he of Roland, Reed & Company, and the same man who had just bowed to her, take some papers from his pocket.""This woman, your honor,"" began the nervous man, ""is charged with wilfully neglecting her child in the matter of withholding the child from relatives who have for years been both supporting and rendering to the child necessary medical aid.""""To prove that the child has hallucinations,"" pursued the man, reading from his papers, ""I would like to state that for some years she has kept a book--called a promise book. In this she collected the names of all the persons she could induce to put them down, claiming that when the right person should sign she would recover some old, imaginary piece of furniture, which, she claimed, held the spirit of her departed grandfather.""""We ask, your honor,"" and the man's voice betrayed confidence, ""that this child be turned over to the Children's Society. We will report to the court, and make any desired arrangements to satisfy the mother.""""Mrs. Salvey,"" called the judge, and the white-faced woman stood up. As she did so, Mr. Reed, the lawyer, advanced to a seat quite close to that occupied by the judge. Rob Roland shifted about with poorly--hidden anxiety.""One minute, your honor,"" interrupted Lawyer Reed. ""We wish to add that on the day that our doctor had decided upon a hospital operation for the child, the child was secretly smuggled off in an automobile by a young girl, and a young sporting character of this town.""Had Cecilia Thayer ever been in a courtroom before, she might have known that lawyers resort to all sorts of tricks to confuse and even anger witnesses. But, as it was, she only felt that something had hit her--a blow that strikes the heart and threatens some dreadful thing. The next moment the blood rushed to her cheeks, relieved that pressure, and she was ready--even for such an insulting charge.Mrs. Salvey was again called, and this time she was not interrupted. She told in a straight-forward manner of the illness of her little girl, of her own difficulty in obtaining sufficient money to have the child treated medically, and of how her husband's cousin, Wilbur Roland, senior member of the firm of Roland, Reed & Company, had come forward and offered her assistance.Cecilia looked very young and very pretty. She spoke with the conviction of candor that counts so much to honest minds, and judge Cowles encouraged her with a most pleasant manner. The newspaper men were scribbling notes rapidly. Rob Roland was looking steadily at the chandelier at the risk of injury to his neck--so awkward was his position.""Leave the room!"" ordered the judge. ""I think there is a different case behind this than the one we are hearing. I shall inquire into it, and, for the good of the child and her wronged mother, I shall order a thorough investigation. What motive have those who brought up this alleged case? There is absolutely no grounds for this action. The case is dismissed."""
"""I have just heard from my daughters,"" he began, ""who are away on a motor tour. They state that the day my papers were taken from the mailbag they met on the road a man answering the description of this gentleman,"" indicating Mr. Reed. ""They described him exactly, his disfigured thumb being easily remembered. Now the young fellow who was 'held-up' that day, and who has been sick since in consequence, also says he felt, while blindfolded, that same one-jointed thumb. Further than that,"" and Mr. Robinson was actually panting for breath, ""my girls can state, and prove, that this same man was at a tea-house near Breakwater discussing papers, which the young girls who conduct the tea-house plainly saw. The papers were stamped with the seals of my patent lawyers.""What followed was always like a dream to Clip--for, leaving off legalities, we may again call her by that significant name. She faced the man to whom she had talked on the road, he who had wanted to help her with her runabout when she was unable to manage it herself. It was directly after Paul Hastings left them, and within a short time of the happening which had meant so much to Hazel's brother. Clip told this, and, strange to say, the lawyer made no attempt to deny any part of her statement.""We are prepared to answer when the case is called,"" he said. ""But it seems to me, Robinson, you went a long way for detectives. Did not the motor girls also tell you that they met me on the road to Breakwater two days ago?""""When the ladies leave the room,"" said the judge quietly, with that courteous manner that made Clip want to run up to him and throw her arms about his neck, ""we may discuss this further. We are indebted to the young motor girl for her identification.""""Wait, wait!"" exclaimed the man. ""If you do not care for an original I could make a copy. The one I am to get is something very, very original, and I will have it here. There is no law against making one like it.""""Wait, wait!"" exclaimed Cora, in tones so like those of the shop proprietor that the girls all laughed heartily. ""I will go to the shop again, and then I will see. Perhaps I will get the original--and then--well, wait--just wait.""""Now see here, girls,"" called Cora very seriously, so that all in-the different machines might hear her, ""this is a matter that must not be mentioned to any one. It would spoil all my plans if the merest hint leaked out. Now remember!"" and Cora spoke with unusual firmness; ""I must have absolute secrecy.""Once back at Bennet Blade the girls whispered and whispered, until Cora declared they would all, forsooth, be attacked with laryngitis, if they did not cease ""hissing,"" and she called upon Doctor Bennet to bear out her statement.What he might do? Was there anything he might not do? The Robinson girls declared that their mail had not been forwarded, and they could not trust to mails, anyhow, since their father's papers had been lost. Would it be too much trouble for him just to call? To tell their mother what a perfectly delightful time they were having, and so on."
"Of course he would go to see his uncle, Dr. Bennet, Sr. In fact, it was with Dr. Bennet he had the appointment; and when Daisy started to entrust him with her messages to her father, he insisted that she write them down--no normal brain could hold such a list, he declared.Cora certainly wanted to send many messages, with the opportunity of having them go first-hand. It did seem such a long time since she had seen Jack; then there was Hazel, poor child, penned up with a sick brother. And Wren and Clip. Why couldn't Cora just run in to Chelton herself with Duncan?The thought was all-conquering. It swayed every other impulse in Cora's generous nature. Why should she stop at the thought of propriety? Was it not all right for her to ride with Doctor Bennet, to reach Chelton by noon and return before night?Mrs. Bennet was one of those dear women who seem to take girls right to her heart. As I have said, she was small and rosy, with that never-fading bloom that sometimes accompanies the rosy-cheeked, curly-headed girl far into her womanhood. Cora would go directly to her, and tell her. She would abide by her judgment.How Cora's heart did thump! Duncan was going in his machine, and, like all doctors, he always preferred to have a man drive--his chauffeur was most skilful--doctors, even when young in their profession, do not willingly risk being stalled.But in spite of Cora's one guiding rule--""When you make up your mind stick to it""--she had many misgivings between that evening when her plans were made, and the next morning when she was to start off with Duncan Bennet. The other girls had gone out to an evening play in Forest Park, one of the real attractions of Breakwater, and at the last moment Cora excused herself upon some available pretense so that she was able to get her things together and see that her machine was safely put up, and then be ready to start off in the morning before the other girls had time to realize she was going.""It does seem,"" she reflected, ""that I am always getting runaway rides."" Then she recalled how Sid Wilcox actually did run away with her once, as related in the ""Motor Girls."" ""And,"" she told herself, ""I seem to like running away with boys.""Cora was looking very pretty. Excitement seems to put the match to the flickering taper of beauty, hidden behind the self-control of healthy maidenhood. Her cheeks were aflame and her eyes sparkled so like Jack's when he was sure of winning a hard contest.What a stupid remark! She had no more idea of saying that than of saying: ""Do you think it will snow?"" But, somehow, when he put up his book and looked at her so seriously, she could not help blundering.""Oh, do sit down,"" he urged. ""My brain is stiff, and I've got to quit for to-night. I haven't told you what takes me to Chelton--in fact, I haven't told mother. You see, she thinks I am such a baby that I find it better not to let her know when I am on a case. But the fact is, I am just baby enough to want to tell some one."""
"He arranged the cushions in the big willow chair, and Cora sat down quite obediently. She liked Duncan--there was something akin to bravery behind his careless manner. ""What he wouldn't do for a friend!"" she thought.""Seems to me, little girl,"" and the young doctor put his hand over hers as would an elderly physician, ""that you are over excitable. I will have to be giving you a sedative if you do not at once quiet down. The child is not to be operated upon, as I understand it. It is simply what we call an observation case.""If she went to Chelton she might hear something that would give her a clue to Wren's book. Jack insinuated that he had a clue when he spoke to her over the 'phone. What if she should be able to trace both the book and the table! And bring Wren into her own!It seemed scarcely any time before the girls were back from the park, just bubbling over in girlish enthusiasm about the wonderful woodland performance. And that Cora should have missed it! Even Gertrude, the staid and steady, could not understand it.The Bennets' home was a very large country house, but with all the motor girls scattered over it the house seemed comparatively small. Chocolate and knickknacks were always served before bedtime, and Daisy had reason to be proud of her part in the entertainment of the girls.Bright and early, the next morning the girls were astir. They had need to be ""up with the lark,"" for the gathering of stuffs with which to decorate cars is quite a task, and they planned to make the fete a memorable affair, as Belle put it.""My dears,"" she began, ""I have a surprise for you. Cora has taken a run home--she really had to go, but she will be back by nightfall. Now, there,"" to Daisy, ""you must not pout. Cora has been a faithful little captain, and, from what I understand, there have been a great many things to demand her attention at home. Go right on with your plans, and make her car the very prettiest, and when she gets back she will have some reason to be proud of her allies. I have arranged to be at home all day, and to do whatever I can to assist you, in Cora's place."" ""Speed her up, Tom,"" ordered Dr. Duncan Bennet to his chauffeur, as he and Cora started out that bright, beautiful morning. ""We will have all we can do to cover the ground and make home by nightfall.""""The one controlling thought is,"" said the young physician, ""that an automobile is not a camel. No telling when its thirst will demand impossible quenching. But this is a first-rate car,"" he went on, ""and it has never gone back on me yet."""
"""Well, I suppose,"" said Cora cautiously, ""that they are scouring Breakwater for things to decorate the machines with. I am glad that I entrusted the Whirlwind to Tillie--she is so artistically practical that she will be sure to avoid making holes in the car to stick bouquets in.""Cora looked at the earnest young man beside her. ""Clip is worth knowing,"" she said simply. Then she added: ""I wonder if we could arrange it to have Hazel come? It would be just glorious to have the club complete after all our little drawbacks. If her brother is better I will not take 'no' for an answer. I shall simply insist upon Hazel coming.""""Oh, my!"" exclaimed Duncan. ""You are ready and willing to make the 'round up.' Well,"" and the car gave an unexpected bump that almost threw Cora over into her companion's arms, ""I would like first rate to have them all come to Breakwater, and our fellows would count it the best part of their vacation to have an auto run of that kind. If we find everything all right out in Chelton we will call a special meeting of the motor girls, the girls being you, and the motor boys being me, and then we will come to the quickest decision on record.""Up to this time Cora had really not noticed the speed. Her conversation with Duncan had been altogether engrossing. But now she began to appreciate the situation, and this precluded all other considerations, even the thoughts of Chelton.Duncan Bennet had no sister, and, consequently, was not versed in the art of ""fidgets."" He only knew the ailment when it took definite form. But Cora was getting it--in fact, she now felt positively nervous.How that machine did go! The speed delighted Duncan. Tom was like an eagle bending over his prey--he urged the car on with such determination. Once or twice Cora felt bound to exclaim, but Duncan only shook his head. It was going, that was all he seemed to care for. Near the station they were obliged to slow up some to look for trains. As they did so Cora saw another car dash by, and in she recognized the man now known to her as Mr. Reed, Rob Roland's cousin.She made no remark to Duncan; he seemed so occupied with his own thoughts. But when, after a few minutes, the same car passed them again, having made a circuit on a crossroad, and the same man stared at Cora as if to make sure it was she, she felt a queer uneasiness.On and on the machine flew. Finally they were within a few rods of the little shed by the roadside. A man on a motor-cycle was waiting. As the Bennet car came up he shot out into the center of the road."
"""Don't worry, little girl,"" said Duncan to Cora with that self-confidence peculiar to those who are accustomed to being obeyed. ""We are all right. It is only a fine, at any rate, and I always carry small change.""""You ought to know,"" replied the man, scowling angrily. ""If I hadn't stopped you land knows but you would have been over the falls. What's the matter with you fellows, anyhow? Can't you take a joy ride without committing murder and suicide?""""Wait till your hurry cools off,"" said the officer, who from his own wild chase was now plainly uncomfortably warm. ""You made the marked-off distance in the shortest time on record, from post to post in one minute.""""Well, the price?"" called Duncan, with his hand in his pocket. ""I tell you I am a doctor, and I am in a hurry to get to Chelton. Can't you make it something reasonable--and then something for your own trouble?""""And that is just what the other fellow said to you,"" spoke Tom. ""Now look here, Hanna. I know how much you have got out of this already, and I happen to know the sort of coin that that sneak, Reed, carries. He has offered me some--at times. He travels out here quite some of late. Take my advice and be square. It is all bound to come out in the wash."" Cora was in despair. To be thus detained when there was not an hour to spare! Tom drew the machine well to the roadside. Duncan leisurely climbed out and then asked the girl if she would remain in the car.Then, of a sudden, with that boyishness that Cora had so greatly admired in so thoughtful a young man, he sprang off on a run toward the meadow, where the constable had indicated the judge could be found.""Come on, friend,"" he called good-naturedly to the officer on the wheel. ""When a thing's to be done, may as well do it. The sooner the quicker,"" he joked, while Cora wondered more and more how so wronged a person could be so good-humored.Tom fussed about the machine, looking to see that the official bullet had not struck through a tire. Evidently the constable did not expect Duncan to take him at his word, and go after the squire, for it took him some time to put his wheel against a tree and prepare to follow on foot."
"Cora had great faith in Tom's judgment now, and was rather glad that he had gone to Duncan's help. She stepped out of the car to gather a few wild flowers, and was just about to step in again when the rumble of an approaching machine attracted her attention.She turned and saw coming toward her that man Reed. With assumed indifference she stepped back to the road to get another flower. This took her just a bit farther from his path than she would have been in the car, but as he came up she heard him slacken, then stop.""Miss Kimball,"" called a voice from the other car. ""I am sorry to see you in this predicament. I am Mr. Reed, of Roland, Reed & Company,"" and he said this with all possible courtesy. ""I believe we have met before, and I came back to see if I might be of any assistance to you. This speeding business is rather troublesome, and I ventured to guess that you are most anxious to be in Chelton to-day, as there are so many interesting things going on there.""""Not very likely,"" went on the other. ""That old judge seems to delight in keeping folks away from their business. He has the most roundabout way possible of transacting matters. I was about to suggest that if you really are anxious to get to Chelton I would go over there and speak with your friend, and, as we are not so far away from the home town, it might be wise for you to ride with me. It is very awkward for a lady to be in this position. Sometimes a newspaper fellow comes along, and, as they say, 'gets a story' out of it.""""Oh, I thank you very much,"" she said hurriedly and not without showing her confusion, ""but I will wait until Dr. Bennet comes. I am sure he will not be detained long. They should have some consideration for physicians.""""Dr. Bennet? Oh, I see. He is in a hurry, too, to get to Chelton."" (If Cora could have seen the flash that shot through the lawyer's brain at that moment.) ""Well, of course, he ought to be allowed to go--although we all have to keep within the speed limit.""The man cranked up instantly, excusing his haste with a glance at his watch. ""Well,"" he said, ""I have a noon appointment, so I may as well hurry on. Good morning, Miss Kimball. I suppose we shall see each other again in Chelton, as we both are interested, I believe, in the same affair--finding the promise book and finding the lost table.""""I thought so. His usual game. He makes himself known. Now see here,"" said Tom, in a manner that made Cora think of Paul--perhaps Tom loved machines as did Paul, and was more than an ordinary chauffeur--""that man is a keen lawyer, Dr. Bennet, and he has some purpose in delaying you."""
"""No,"" interrupted Cora. ""It is in me he seems to have the interest, for he asked me to ride back to Chelton with him. Oh, I know!"" she exclaimed. ""It is in Wren! He is the lawyer who has to do with Mrs. Salvey's case, and he is trying to keep Dr. Bennet away from Chelton to-day. He must have heard that you were on the case,"" declared Cora, as the whole strange proceeding seemed to flash before her excited mind.""Well, I'm goin' to let you go,"" asserted the judge. ""I don't like this here kind of business, Hanna, and I want you after this to have all your charges first hand. Don't take no tips from nobody, d'ye hear?""Hanna smiled. He had his hand in his pocket, and it may as well be told that there was also in the pocket something which resigned him to letting the automobilists go. Reed had attended to the compensation.Duncan put his hand out to the old squire. ""Here, squire,"" he said. ""I do this openly. I want you to take this, not as a bribe, but as a personal gift, which I have a perfect right to offer you. You are doing me a kindness, and also this young lady a kindness, and the one most concerned is a helpless little creature who waits until I reach Chelton to know whether or not she is to be made perfectly well, so to speak. Not that I am the one to say that, but because a noted specialist will wait for all the other doctors. It's a long stony, but I will let you know how we make out if I beat that sharper into Chelton.""Cora couldn't speak. She, too, put out her hand to the old squire, who was wiping his eyes and shaking his head against Duncan's gift. Finally the young doctor prevailed upon him, and then once more they started on their mad run for Chelton.""Not so bad. But you should have seen the time we had to get Wren to the sanitarium. She didn't want to leave here, and had a mortal fear of a hospital. But how are you?"" and he looked into her flushed face. ""I declare it seems moons since I've seen you.""""Oh, you don't say! In a suit case or a la hamper? Ed is literally cut up about all the girls being out of town at once. He would fit in the shirt box, I fancy. But Wallie--he seems to have expanded. I doubt if you could manage him--"""
"""You should not eat after ten, Jack. But come along. I must look over the place, and talk at the same time,"" and with that intention Cora started on her tour of home inspection, while Jack made all the noise he possibly could make (which was not a little), running through the house after her.""First rate!"" responded Jack, when Cora paused for breath. ""I rather fancy the idea of going after some of the girls. I cannot help but agree with Ed that all the girls should not leave town at once--you should take turns.""""There you go again, picking a fight,"" and he laughed honestly. ""Now, Cora, Clip is just Clip, no more and not one whit less, but she has been so busy--oh, so tremendously busy!"" He was getting into his motor togs, and Cora was already equipped for her ride about Chelton. ""Say, sis,"" he added, ""did I tell you I have my suspicions about the loss of Wren's book? Did she describe to you the pair who last signed the contract?""""Didn't you run over her dining-car one day early this summer?"" Jack reminded her. ""Or was it Bess? No matter just who, it was one of the motor girls. And, besides, you did not ask her to go on the run.""""If I thought Ida Giles knew anything about that book I would go directly to her house and demand an explanation,"" said Cora, flushing. ""Ida is too apt to be influenced by Sid Wilcox. I thought she had seen enough of the consequences of such folly.""""Has, eh? Smart fellow, Doc Bennet! I tried all afternoon yesterday to locate the lithersome Clip. Took a coy little jaunt of two miles afoot--some one said she had a friend out Bentley way, but I did not locate her. Hope Doc has better luck.""""Well, if Clip has had any influence, I should say Wren would turn out an artist's model, physically. Clip has just about lived with the child since you went away. Of course, we had Miss Brown, and if she isn't Brown by nature as well as by name. I wouldn't say so. I never got one single smile to cut across her map."""
"""Just as you say, lady. But I have not told you--let the last moment be the hardest. Ed has taken to the ram. He is training the ram. Can't get him away from the ram. Mary's little lamb is a 'bucking bronco' to it.""""Jack,"" said Cora, when they were also up to the hill behind which they hoped to find the idler by the brook, ""do you know I think I have an actual clue to Wren's table. An antique man out Breakwater way has an order for one. I am watching that order.""""That's easy. When you know that Reed has been in and out of the place for some days. That's the best of being a girl. You can trace around after the most important clues and no one would ever suspect you of knowing what you are after. Now, I rather think when the fete is 'pulled off,' if I may use the term,"" and he laughed his apology, ""then there will be some doin's. I just want to see rocky Rob rumpled.""""About Paul? Why, he's all right. He's out and has been to the office,"" was the brother's surprising answer. ""Didn't you hear about Mr. Robinson wanting to send him away for his health? Robinson has taken a great fancy to Paul. The stolen document business is also near a climax. I had a fine time trying to keep Clip's name out of the paper, the day they had the hearing about Wren. You see, I--the great first person--ran into the courtroom just as the judge was dismissing the absurd case set up against Mrs. Salvey. Of course, that was nothing more or less than a trick to get information for the other side. Well, Mr. Robinson was hurrying to court and he has passed his running days creditably, I believe when he met me. I took up his run at a moment's notice, reached the courtroom, waved my hands wildly in the air--""""Then don't die until you do hear,"" and he slowed up at the hill. ""The fact is, I just caught the whole City News force red-handed with a great story about Clip. The reporters had called her the modern Clara, and all that, but I got it away from them. I know one of the best of them, and he agreed, so they all had to. It was a good little story, for the lawyers were matched against a motor girl. That made it interesting from a newspaper viewpoint. Hello! Didn't I tell you? Say, there, Mr. Foster! Chain up the ram, Ed. We want to approach."""
"""Oh, he did. But do you remember what the man said about having to put his overcoat on to feed that animal? Well, he wouldn't even stand for Walter, with or without the ulster. He tried his best raincoat and all, but the ram just went for him. But look how he purrs around Ed--tame as a kitten.""Cora's invitation to go to Breakwater came almost as a shock, Ed declared, but coming from Cora he would accept. Consequently he hurried the ram to its quarters, and, agreeing to look up Walter, the girl was left to pay her visit to Hazel.""You take me over to Hazel's, Jack?"" asked Cora. ""Then you may go along and help look for Walter. I must meet Dr. Bennet at two-thirty. And then, I wonder, will we be able to get back to Breakwater by six.""She was thinking of her experience coming out to Chelton; also she kept on the lookout for Mr. Reed. He had hinted that there were interesting things developing in Chelton just then. He had said openly that his interest and Cora's were mutual. Would he again molest her?Having failed to prove Wren a subject for some ""shut-in"" institution, these same lawyers were now engaged on another scheme, that of trying to show that the child was detained against her will, and was actually in the possession of Cora Kimball.Jack had told Cora all this, trying to make it a matter of small importance, and laughing at Rob Roland's initial performance, as Jack put it; but Cora felt that it was no laughing matter, and that at least the happiness of two persons--Mrs. Salvey and her delicate little daughter--was involved.Cora and Jack were on the road, and Jack had cranked up. Ed, having made the ram secure in the field, was about to walk to his own lodgings. Suddenly a flash of red swept across the streak of brown highway. Cora recognized it instantly as Dr. Bennet's car.""I have been on the wildest hunt,"" he said, smiling an acknowledgment to Cora's introduction to Ed, and bowing to Jack, whom he had met earlier in the day. ""I have been all over Chelton, but of course did not expect to locate you out here.""""You see,"" he continued, ""I happened to overhear that you are to be subpoenaed in that Robinson patent case. In fact, I heard Reed say he would have you in an hour, so I determined to beat him back home--get you over the State line before he can serve the papers. Now, you had best jump right in. Clip is waiting for us at Wiltons'. We will pick her up and then fly.""""Oh!"" gasped Cora, seizing at Jack's arm. ""I am not going to run away. I will stay right at home--with my brother."" Cora was as near crying as any young lady with the reputation of strength of character might safely venture. But Jack knew more of the case than he had confided to her, and he instantly agreed with Dr. Bennet."
"""Run along, sis,"" he advised, with the jollity that makes a brave boy ever a girl's hero. ""I'll be after you with the others, and it will be no end of fun. Clip's going, and I'll try to have Paul and Hazel join--if Paul is fit. Then with Ed and Walter-- Say, we will have the time of our young lives! Get in with Dr. Bennet, and I'll turn back and stop in front of the ice cream place. Of course, Reed or Roland will come along that way, and of course you will be inside eating frapped subpoenas.""""Certainly,"" interrupted Duncan. ""But we have fooled him thus far. Be sure to come to the show, boys,"" this to Ed and Jack. ""My crowd will be out there to-night, but I suppose we will not see the Chelton throng until to-morrow. Excuse haste--and a bad pen,"" he added, laughing, while Tom gave a signal on the horn. ""This is the time we make a run against the law."" ""Now, Tom,"" called Duncan Bennet to his chauffeur, after Clip had joined Cora, ""you had better slow up some. The young ladies may want to find out whether or not they still wear hats."" They had ridden fast and far.""Oh!"" exclaimed Clip, ""I never had such a delightful ride. I suppose that is what you call being motor mad--going and going until you cannot go fast enough. They say it is a disease, isn't it, doctor?""""I believe it is so defined,"" answered Duncan with mock dignity. ""But we are not to talk disease, if you please, young lady,"" and he smiled a command which might easily be interpreted to mean: ""You must rest from that sort of thing for a while.""""I never was so frightened in my life,"" admitted Cora. ""Not that I was afraid of going to court, but I was mortally afraid we would not be able to make the run in time. I should have known better, however, for Tom had qualified before to-day.""""Well, you have been looking whole vocabularies at me, Cora, in many and various languages,"" said Clip in her own inimitable way. ""I have been wondering whether you had turned into a Sphynx or just Liberty.""""Well, I am glad you didn't,"" answered Clip sincerely. ""I do think that a courtroom is about the meanest place I have ever visited--and I have been in a lot of queer places. And the girls,"" went on Clip. ""Whatever will they say to you two runaways?"""
"""You mean the antique shop?"" asked Cora. ""Oh, I know. He is after a table. I am sure it is he who has given the order--"" She stopped--her finger on her lip. Tom seemed to know so much--what if he should know about the missing table? ""Have you any idea what he is after?"" asked Cora directly.""Well, I ought to know,"" replied Tom, ""for he has made no secret of it. He has searched every attic from Breakwater to Moreland. I caught an old junk dealer in our barn the other morning, and while I watched him get down the road I saw Reed come along. Of course, he had hired the man to search where he himself could not go. He is after some sort of ancient rustic table, I believe.""""We are not out of the woods yet,"" remarked Clip. ""I am thinking, Duncan, that you have undertaken a large contract. You have positively agreed to have me back in Chelton by to-morrow afternoon at four o'clock.""""Oh, you won't be. We will fix it so the 'clearing-up' will be late for you. I suppose you think everything that ever happened is going to repeat itself to-morrow afternoon, just because one Miss Cecilia Thayer is going--""""Well, when the Chelton boys arrive I guess the girls will not be so particular about their time,"" said Duncan. ""I fancy even the captain will have to show somebody the beauties of Breakwater. But hark! Wasn't that Daisy? I just heard a breath. We are only about ten miles from home--Daisy can easily breathe that long when she is excited. Oh, I am just aching to hear what they will say, Cora,"" and he laughed. ""I'll wager Ray will be the aggrieved one. She will likely manage to keep out of the work, don't you think so?""Cora did not reply in so many words, but she looked acquiescence. Certainly those who knew Ray appreciated her ability to take care of her own personal self at the risk of all other matters. But Cora was thinking of something else--of Wren and the medical report. She knew better than to ask Duncan outright what might have been the result of their inquiry. Nevertheless, she could not refrain from ""begging the question."""
"""Something of that kind,"" answered Duncan vaguely. ""But put your mind at rest--the child has every chance of ultimate recovery. The trouble was the wrong treatment. We use purely physical training for that sort of thing.""The runaways were forgiven, finally, although between four ""enraged"" young medical students, and the sextette of motor girls, Cora and Duncan had some difficulty in making it perfectly clear that the trip to Chelton was entirely unavoidable. It was a merry party that gathered in Mrs. Bennet's long drawing-room that evening to make arrangements for the run over Breakwater roads in the morning. The girls at first refused to allow Cora a sight of the decorated cars until they should be in line, but Tillie was so proud of her achievement with the Whirlwind that all finally consented, and directly after tea the cars in the garage and in the big barn were admired and inspected. Certainly the machines did credit to the fair decorators. The Whirlwind was transformed into a moving garden, the sides being first wound with strong twine, and into this were thrust all sorts of flowers in great, loose bunches. Only the softest foliage, in branches, was utilized, as Tillie felt responsible for the luster of the ""piano"" polish, for which the Whirlwind was remarkable. The top of the car was like a roof garden, the effect being quite simply managed, for Tillie was resourceful. She had stretched across the roof of the car a strong sheet of pasteboard. Into this she placed a great variety of wild flowers, banking the stalks, which stood into holes made in the board, with soft grasses and such ferns as might be depended upon not to ""slink"" in the sun.""I shouldn't tell,"" replied Belle, who was looking very pretty--at least one of the strange boys thought so. It was Phil MacVicker who ""kept track"" of Belle, and it was the same gallant Phil, who, late in the afternoon, helped Belle to finish up her pond lily.""We may all guess why Belle chose that design,"" said Daisy, who was waiting for the newcomers to pass judgment on her own runabout. ""A pond lily has a yellow head, and Belle's is just about that shade.""It would be pretty to see a yellow head in the white peals of the improvised lily. Cora satisfied her curiosity by finding out that these petals were nothing more than barrel staves covered with crushed white paper.Duncan ""went wild"" when he beheld what Daisy had rigged up. A veritable circus wagon--a cage, in which Daisy declared she was going to sit with whip in hand, and Nero, the big St. Bernard dog, at her feet.Of course the boys wanted something grotesque. Phil suggested that they all carry out the circus idea, and ""trail"" after Beauty and the Beast. This was finally agreed to, and it was Duncan's car that they turned into the calliope, actually going so far as to hire the local hurdy-gurdy man to ride in it and do the ""callioping.""""It looks as if our run home would be more auspicious than the trip we made in,"" said Cora to one of the very nice young students, who had offered to look over her car and see that it was in good working order. ""We had a dreadful time coming out here--but I suppose the girls have told you about it.""Tired from their enthusiasm, as well as from muscular efforts, the girls found their eyes scarcely ""locked,"" before the bright rays of a late summer sun knocked on the tardy lids and demanded recognition.From that moment, until car after car was upon the roads of Breakwater, it was a question which made the most noise, the girls talking or the boys blowing signals on the auto horns. Hazel had come with Jack, as Paul was scarcely able for the excitement, so that, after all, the motor girls were all in the run.Of course, Cora, being captain, had to lead, and from the floral folds of the Whirlwind floated the club flag in the newly adopted colors, red and white, with the gold letters, M. G. C. (Motor Girls' Club), plainly discernible in the changing sunlight."
"Nor were the young people of Breakwater to be left out of the sport, for numbers of them possessing automobiles, fell into line, after the decorated cars, until the entire little summer place was agog with such excitement as the extreme originality of the visiting colonists usually affords.Street after street was paraded through, auto after auto wheeled along, horns tooting, whistles screeching, boys shouting, girls cheering, until one hour of this strenuous frolic seemed enough to satisfy motor girls and motor boys; and the party went to the Beacon for luncheon precisely at noon, leaving Tom to finish the honors by stripping the cars of their trappings and making them ready for a homeward trip.Duncan found an opportunity of making Clip more intimately acquainted with his mother, for she was a woman glad to be the friend of her boy's friends, and willing to take considerable trouble to show the many little social preferences.Cora insisted on the festivities breaking up on the scheduled time, and so did Clip. Cora wanted to get to the antique shop, and Clip wanted to get back to Chelton. So after a delay, impossible to avoid where there were so many boys and so many girls, each and all wanting something to say, some question to ask, or some message to deliver, the party finally started off on the return trip of the first regular tour of the Motor Girls' Club. With Jack's and Walter's additional cars the girls were able to ride home without crowding, so that the Whirlwind carried only Cora, Clip and Gertrude--the gallantry of the Chelton young men affording Tillie and Adele a chance for a most jolly trip in the little runabouts, while Hazel rode with the twins.""I think it will be best to have a chance to talk with the old man quietly,"" she told her companions. ""I am so anxious to find out whether or not he really had Wren's table, or knows anything about it.""""Oh, yes, of course. But it is only filled with names, and I got it in a deal with another sale. The party who brought it here,"" went on the curio dealer, ""the same who bought the table gave me the book in the bargain, with the understanding that I should not sell it but keep it on exhibition. They were very particular about me not selling it.""Cora instantly guessed what this meant--a trick of Rob Roland. To show her the book! To make sure it was now useless, as the table had been made secure by him, but just to put it in that case to taunt her, when she would come, as of course he knew she would, and discover there was now absolutely no hope of ever recovering Wren's long-lost treasure.Then it was not yet paid for--not actually bought. Clip saw instantly what Cora was striving for, but she pretended to be interested in the locked case in which rested the much-looked-for promise book.""If they wanted the table why did they not bring the money?"" she said. ""I should think it would save you trouble to sell the table directly to me--if it suits me, of course. I am going away from here, and suppose the other customer never comes back?""Quicker than the girl dreamed she could do it, Cora paid the man, actually grabbed the table herself and ran out of the shop with it and thrust it into the front of the Whirlwind among the flowers, cranked up her car and darted off.""Oh, don't worry about the details, miss,"" replied the officer. ""We have that thing to do every day. These fellows take anything they can get, and that being the book of a cripple, I will take chances on getting it. You may be asked to explain fully, later.""What followed seemed like a dream to Cora. Of course she knew that it was Rob Roland who had ordered the table and Sid Wilcox who had returned the book. As the Whirlwind passed the little hotel on the road to Chelton Cora actually brushed against Rob Roland's car--and she had the table hidden amid the flowers in the Whirlwind!"
