passage
"""What the child imitates,"" says Froebel, ""he begins to understand. Let him represent the flying of birds and he enters partially into the life of birds. Let him imitate the rapid motion of fishes in the water and his sympathy with fishes is quickened. Let him reproduce the activities of farmer, miller and baker, and his eyes open to the meaning of their work. In one word let him reflect in his play the varied aspects of life and his thought will begin to grapple with their significance.""In all times and among all nations, finger-plays have been a delight of childhood. Countless babies have laughed and crowed over ""Pat-a-cake"" and other performances of the soft little hands; while children of whatever age never fail to find amusement in playingYet it is not solely upon the pleasure derived from them, that finger-plays depend for their _raison d'etre_. By their judicious and early use, the development of strength and flexibility in the tiny lax fingers may be assisted, and dormant thought may receive its first awakening call through the motions which interpret as well as illustrate the phase of life or activity presented by the words.The eighteen finger-plays contained in this book have already, through publication in BABYLAND, been introduced to their especial public, and have been much used in homes, though perhaps more in kindergartens. It will readily be seen that while some of the plays are for the babies in the nursery, others are more suitable for older children.A baby-friend, ten months old, plays ""All for Baby"" throughout, pounding and clapping gleefully with all his might--while children seven or eight years of age play and sing ""The Caterpillar,"" ""How the Corn Grew"" and others with very evident enjoyment.With a little study of the charming and expressive pictures with which the artist, Mr. L.J. Bridgman, has so sympathetically illustrated the rhymes, mothers and kindergartners have easily understood what motions were intended. To elucidate still farther, however, the playing of ""The Merry Little Men"" may be thus described:During the singing of the first verse, the children look about in every direction for the ""little men,"" but keep the hands hidden. At the beginning of the second verse, raise both hands to full view with fingers outspread and quiet. At the words, ""The first to come,"" etc., let the thumbs be shown alone, then the others as named in turn, till all are again outspread as at the beginning of the second verse. In the last verse the arms are moved from side to side, hands being raised and fingers fluttering nimbly all the time. When displaying the ""busy little men,"" raise the hands as high as possible.3. These are the big shears to shear the old sheep; Dear little lambkins their soft wool may keep. Here, with its big double doors shut so tight, This is the barn where they all sleep at night.1. In my little garden bed Rak'd so nicely over, First the tiny seeds I sow, Then with soft earth cover. Shining down, the great round sun Smiles upon it often; Little raindrops, patt'ring down, Help the seeds to soften.2. Then the little plant awakes! Down the roots go creeping. Up it lifts its little head Thro' the brown mould peeping. High and higher still it grows Thro' the summer hours, Till some happy day the buds Open into flowers.]"
"And slowly, slowly turning, The great wheel of the mill; And then the tall church steeple, The little church so still; The bridge above the water; And when he stopped to rest, He saw among the bushes A wee ground-sparrow's nest,And as he watched the birdies Above the tree-tops fly, He saw the clouds a-sailing Across the sunny sky. He saw the insects playing; The flowers that summer brings; He said, ""I'll go tell Mamma! I've seen _so many_ things.""]1. Five little mice on the pantry floor, Seeking for bread crumbs or something more; Five little mice on the shelf up high, Feasting so daintily on a pie-- But the big round eyes of the wise old cat See what the five little mice are at. Quickly she jumps! but the mice run away. And hide in their snug little holes all day. ""Feasting in pantries may be very nice; But home is the best!"" say the five little mice.]1. ""Little Squirrel, living there In the hollow tree, I've a pretty cage for you; Come and live with me! You may turn the little wheel-- That will be great fun! Slowly round, or very fast If you faster run.""2. ""Little Squirrel, I will bring In my basket here Every day a feast of nuts! Come then, squirrel dear."" But the little squirrel said From his hollow tree: ""Oh! no, no! I'd rather far Live here and be free.""3. So my cage is empty yet And the wheel is still; But my little basket here Oft with nuts I fill. If you like, I'll crack the nuts, Some for you and me, For the squirrel has enough In his hollow tree.] (_Left hand._) Once I saw an ant-hill With no ants about; So I said, ""Dear little ants, Won't you please come out?"" Then as if the little ants Had heard my call-- One! two! three! four! _five_ came out! And that was all!"
"2. Once I saw an ant hill With no ants about; So I said, ""Dear little ants, Won't you please come out?"" Then as if the little ants Had heard my call-- One! two! three! four! _five_ came out! And that was all!]1. There was a field that waiting lay, All hard and brown and bare; There was a thrifty farmer came And fenced it in with care, There was a thrifty farmer came And fenced it in with care.]1. A merry little river Went singing day by day, Until it reached a mill-dam That stretched across its way. And there it spread its waters, A quiet pond, to wait Until the busy miller Should lift the water gate.]2. Then, hurrying through the gateway, The dashing waters found A mighty millwheel waiting-- And turned it swiftly round. But faster turned the millstone Up in the dusty mill, And quickly did the miller With corn the hopper fill.3. And faster yet and faster The heavy stones went round, Until the golden kernels To golden meal were ground. ""Now, fill the empty hopper With _wheat_,"" the miller said; ""We'll grind this into flour To make the children's bread.""4. And still, as flowed the water, The mighty wheel went round; And still, as turned the millstones, The corn and grain were ground. And busy was the miller The livelong day, until The water gate he fastened, And silent grew the mill. ""The farmer and the miller Have worked,"" the mother said, ""And got the flour ready, So I will make the bread."" She scooped from out the barrel The flour white as snow, And in her sieve she put it And shook it to and fro.Then in the pan of flour A little salt she threw; A cup of yeast she added, And poured in water, too. To mix them all together She stirred with busy might, Then covered it and left it Until the bread was light.More flour then she sifted And kneaded well the dough, And in the waiting oven The loaves of bread did go. The mother watched the baking, And turned the loaves, each one, Until at last, rejoicing, She said, ""My bread is done!""1.
