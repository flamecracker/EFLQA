B.C. 55.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly two thousand years ago there was a brave captain whose name\r\nwas Julius Caesar.  The soldiers he led to battle were very strong,\r\nand conquered the people wherever they went.  They had no gun or\r\ngunpowder then; but they had swords and spears, and, to prevent\r\nthemselves from being hurt, they had helmets or brazen caps on their\r\nheads, with long tufts of horse-hair upon them, by way of ornament,\r\nand breast-plates of brass on their breasts, and on their arms they\r\ncarried a sort of screen, made of strong leather.  One of them\r\ncarried a little brass figure of an eagle on a long pole, with a\r\nscarlet flag flying below, and wherever the eagle was seen, they\r\nall followed, and fought so bravely that nothing could long stand\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nWhen Julius Caesar rode at their head, with his keen, pale hook-nosed\r\nface, and the scarlet cloak that the general always wore, they were so\r\nproud of him, and so fond of him, that there was nothing they would\r\nnot do for him.\r\n\r\nJulius Caesar heard that a little way off there was a country nobody\r\nknew anything about, except that the people were very fierce and\r\nsavage, and that a sort of pearl was found in the shells of mussels\r\nwhich lived in the rivers.  He could not bear that there should be\r\nany place that his own people, the Romans, did not know and subdue.\r\nSo he commanded the ships to be prepared, and he and his soldiers\r\nembarked, watching the white cliffs on the other side of the sea\r\ngrow higher and higher as he came nearer and nearer.\r\n\r\nWhen he came quite up to them, he found the savages were there in\r\nearnest.  They were tall men, with long red streaming hair, and such\r\nclothes as they had were woollen, checked like plaid; but many had\r\ntheir arms and breasts naked, and painted all over in blue patterns.\r\nThey yelled and brandished their darts, to make Julius Caesar and his\r\nRoman soldiers keep away; but he only went on to a place where the\r\nshore was not quite so steep, and there commanded his soldiers to\r\nland.  The savages had run along the shore too, and there was a\r\nterrible fight; but at last the man who carried the eagle jumped down\r\ninto the middle of the natives, calling out to his fellows that they\r\nmust come after him, or they would lose their eagle.  They all came\r\nrushing and leaping down, and thus they managed to force back the\r\nsavages, and make their way to the shore.\r\n\r\nThere was not much worth having when they had made their way there.\r\nThough they came again the next year, and forced their way a good\r\ndeal farther into the country, they saw chiefly bare downs, or heaths,\r\nor thick woods.  The few houses were little more than piles of stones,\r\nand the people were rough and wild, and could do very little.  The men\r\nhunted wild boars, and wolves and stags, and the women dug the ground,\r\nand raised a little corn, which they ground to flour between two\r\nstones to make bread; and they spun the wool of their sheep, dyed it\r\nwith bright colors, and wove it into dresses.  They had some strong\r\nplaces in the woods, with trunks of trees, cut down to shut them in\r\nfrom the enemy, with all their flocks and cattle; but Caesar did not\r\nget into any of these.  He only made the natives give him some of\r\ntheir pearls, and call the Romans their masters, and then he went back\r\nto his ships, and none of the set of savages who were alive when he\r\ncame saw him or his Romans any more.\r\n\r\nDo you know who these savages were who fought with Julius Caesar?\r\nThey were called Britons.  And the country he came to see?  That was\r\nour very own island, England, only it was not called so then.  And the\r\nplace where Julius Caesar landed is called Deal, and, if you look at\r\nthe map where England and France most nearly touch one another, I\r\nthink you will see the name Deal, and remember it was there Julius\r\nCaesar landed, and fought with the Britons.\r\n\r\nIt was fifty-five years before our blessed Saviour was born that\r\nthe Romans came.  So at the top of this chapter stands B.C. (Before\r\nChrist) 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANS IN BRITAIN.  A.D. 41--418.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a hundred years before any more of the Romans came to\r\nBritain; but they were people who could not hear of a place without\r\nwanting to conquer it, and they never left off trying till they had\r\ndone what they undertook.\r\n\r\nOne of their emperors, named Claudius, sent his soldiers to conquer\r\nthe island, and then came to see it himself, and called himself\r\nBrittanicus in honor of the victory, just as if he had done it\r\nhimself, instead of his generals.  One British chief, whose name\r\nwas Caractacus, who had fought very bravely against the Romans, was\r\nbrought to Rome, with chains on his hands and feet, and set before\r\nthem emperor.  As he stood there, he said that, when he looked at all\r\nthe grand buildings of stone and marble in the streets, he could not\r\nthink why the Romans should want to take away the poor rough-stone\r\nhuts of the Britons.  The wife of Caractacus, who had also been\r\nbrought a prisoner to Rome, fell upon her knees imploring for pity,\r\nbut the conquered chief asked for nothing and exhibited no signs of\r\nfear.  Claudius was kind to Caractacus; but the Romans went on\r\nconquering Britain till they had won all the part of it that lies\r\nsouth of the river Tweed; and, as the people beyond that point were\r\nmore fierce and savage still, a very strong wall, with a bank of\r\nearth and deep ditch was made to keep them out, and always watched\r\nby Roman soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Romans made beautiful straight roads all over the country, and\r\nthey built towns.  Almost all the towns whose names end in _chester_\r\nwere begun by the Romans, and bits of their walls are to be seen\r\nstill, built of very small bricks.  Sometimes people dig up a bit of\r\nthe beautiful pavement of colored tiles, in patterns, which used to\r\nbe the floors of their houses, or a piece of their money, or one of\r\ntheir ornaments.\r\n\r\nFor the Romans held Britain for four hundred years, and tamed the wild\r\npeople in the south, and taught them to speak and dress, and read and\r\nwrite like themselves, so that they could hardly be known from the\r\nRomans.  Only the wild ones beyond the wall, and in the mountains,\r\nwere as savage as ever, and, now and then, used to come and steal the\r\ncattle, and burn the houses of their neighbors who had learnt better.\r\n\r\nAnother set of wild people used to come over in boats across the North\r\nSea and German Ocean.  These people had their home in the country that\r\nis called Holstein and Jutland.  They were tall men, and had blue eyes\r\nand fair hair, and they were very strong, and good-natured in a rough\r\nsort of way, though they were fierce to their enemies.  There was a\r\ngreat deal more fighting than any one has told us about; but the end\r\nof it all was that the Roman soldiers were wanted at home, and though\r\nthe great British chief we call King Arthur fought very bravely, he\r\ncould not drive back the blue-eyed men in the ships; but more and more\r\ncame, till, at last, they got all the country, and drove the Britons,\r\nsome up into the North, some into the mountains that rise along the\r\nWest of the island, and some into its west point.\r\n\r\nThe Britons used to call the blue-eyed men Saxons; but they called\r\nthemselves Angles, and the country was called after them Angle-land.\r\nDon\'t you know what it is called now?  England itself, and the people\r\nEnglish.  They spoke much the same language as we do, only more as\r\nuntaught country people, and they had not so many words, because they\r\nhad not so many things to see and talk about.\r\n\r\nAs to the Britons, the English went on driving them back till they\r\nonly kept their mountains.  There they have gone on living ever since,\r\nand talking their own old language.  The English called them Welsh, a\r\nname that meant strangers, and we call them Welsh still, and their\r\ncountry Wales.  They made a great many grand stories about their last\r\nbrave chief, Arthur, till, at last, they turned into a sort of fairy\r\ntale.  It was said that, when King Arthur lay badly wounded after his\r\nlast battle, he bade his friend fling his sword into the river, and\r\nthat then three lovely ladies came in a boat, and carried him away to\r\na secret island.  The Welsh kept on saying, for years and years, that\r\none day king Arthur would wake up again, and give them back all\r\nBritain, which used to be their own before the English got it for\r\nthemselves; but the English have had England now for thirteen hundred\r\nyears, and we cannot doubt they will keep it as long as the world\r\nlasts.\r\n\r\nIt was about 400 years after our Lord was born that the Romans were\r\ngoing and the English coming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ANGLE CHILDREN  A.D. 597.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old English who had come to Britain were heathen, and believed in\r\nmany false gods: the Sun, to whom they made Sunday sacred, as Monday\r\nwas to the moon, Wednesday to a great terrible god, named Woden, and\r\nThursday to a god named Thor, or Thunder.  They thought a clap of\r\nthunder was the sound of the great hammer he carried in his hand.\r\nThey thought their gods cared for people being brave, and that the\r\nsouls of those who died fighting gallantly in battle were the happiest\r\nof all; but they did not care for kindness or gentleness.\r\n\r\nThus they often did very cruel things, and one of the worst that they\r\ndid was the stealing of men, women, and children from their homes, and\r\nselling them to strangers, who made slaves of them.  All England had\r\nnot one king.  There were generally about seven kings, each with a\r\ndifferent part of the island and as they were often at war with one\r\nanother, they used to steal one another\'s subjects, and sell them to\r\nmerchants who came from Italy and Greece for them.\r\n\r\nSome English children were made slaves, and carried to Rome, where\r\nthey were set in the market-place to be sold.  A good priest, named\r\nGregory, was walking by.  He saw their fair faces, blue eyes, and long\r\nlight hair, and, stopping, he asked who they were.  "Angles," he was\r\ntold, "from the isle of Britain."  "Angles?" he said, "they have angel\r\nfaces, and they ought to be heirs with the angels in heaven."  From\r\nthat time this good man tried to find means to send teachers to teach\r\nthe English the Christian faith.  He had to wait for many years, and,\r\nin that time, he was made Pope, namely, Father-Bishop of Rome.  At\r\nlast he heard that one of the chief English kings, Ethelbert of Kent,\r\nhad married Bertha, the daughter of the King of Paris, who was a\r\nChristian, and that she was to be allowed to bring a priest with her,\r\nand have a church to worship in.\r\n\r\nGregory thought this would make a beginning: so he sent a priest,\r\nwhose name was Augustine, with a letter to King Ethelbert and Queen\r\nBertha, and asked the King to listen to him.  Ethelbert met Augustine\r\nin the open air, under a tree at Canterbury, and heard him tell about\r\nthe true God, and JESUS CHRIST, whom He sent; and, after some time,\r\nand a great deal of teaching, Ethelbert gave up worshiping Woden and\r\nThor, and believed in the true God, and was baptized, and many of his\r\npeople with him.  Then Augustine was made Archbishop of Canterbury;\r\nand, one after another, in the course of the next hundred years, all\r\nthe English kingdoms learnt to know God, and broke down their idols,\r\nand became Christian.\r\n\r\nBishops were appointed, and churches were built, and parishes were\r\nmarked off--a great many of them the very same that we have now.  Here\r\nand there, when men and women wanted to be very good indeed, and to\r\ngive their whole lives to doing nothing but serving God, without any\r\nof the fighting and feasting, the buying and selling of the outer\r\nworld, they built houses, where they might live apart, and churches,\r\nwhere there might be services seven times a day.  These houses were\r\nnamed abbeys.  Those for men were, sometimes, also called monasteries,\r\nand the men in them were termed monks, while the women were called\r\nnuns, and their homes convents of nunneries.  They had plain dark\r\ndresses, and hoods, and the women always had veils.  The monks used\r\nto promise that they would work as well as pray, so they used to build\r\ntheir abbeys by some forest or marsh, and bring it all into order,\r\nturning the wild place into fields, full of wheat.  Others used to\r\ncopy out the Holy Scriptures and other good books upon parchment--\r\nbecause there was no paper in those days, nor any printing--drawing\r\nbeautiful painted pictures at the beginning of the chapters, which\r\nwere called illuminations.  The nun did needlework and embroidery,\r\nas hangings for the altar, and garments for the priests, all bright\r\nwith beautiful colors, and stiff with gold.  The English nuns\' work\r\nwas the most beautiful to be seen anywhere.\r\n\r\nThere were schools in the abbeys, where boys were taught reading,\r\nwriting, singing, and Latin, to prepare them for being clergymen; but\r\nnot many others thought it needful to have anything to do with books.\r\nEven the great men thought they could farm and feast, advise the king,\r\nand consent to the laws, hunt or fight, quite as well without reading,\r\nand they did not care for much besides; for, though they were\r\nChristians, they were still rude, rough, ignorant men, who liked\r\nnothing so well as a hunt or a feast, and slept away all the evening,\r\nespecially when they could get a harper to sing to them.\r\n\r\nThe English men used to wear a long dress like a carter\'s frock, and\r\ntheir legs were wound round with strips of cloth by way of stockings.\r\nTheir houses were only one story, and had no chimneys--only a hole at\r\nthe top for the smoke to go out at; and no glass in the windows.  The\r\nonly glass there was at all had been brought from Italy to put into\r\nYork Cathedral, and it was thought a great wonder.  So the windows had\r\nshutters to keep out the rain and wind, and the fire was in the middle\r\nof the room.  At dinner-time, about twelve o\'clock, the lord and lady\r\nof the house sat upon cross-legged stools, and their children and\r\nservants sat on benches; and square bits of wood called trenchers,\r\nwere put before them for plates, while the servants carried round the\r\nmeat on spits, and everybody cut off a piece with his own knife and\r\nat it without a fork.  They drank out of cows\' horns, if they had not\r\nsilver cups.  But though they were so rough they were often good,\r\nbrave people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHMEN.  A.D. 858--958.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were many more of the light-haired, blue-eyed people on the\r\nfurther side of the North Sea who worshiped Thor and Woden still, and\r\nthought that their kindred in England had fallen from the old ways.\r\nBesides, they liked to make their fortunes by getting what they could\r\nfrom their neighbors.  Nobody was thought brave or worthy, in Norway\r\nor Denmark, who had not made some voyages in a "long keel," as a ship\r\nwas called, and fought bravely, and brought home gold cups and chains\r\nor jewels to show where he had been.  Their captains were called Sea\r\nKings, and some them went a great way, even into the Mediterranean\r\nSea, and robbed the beautiful shores of Italy.  So dreadful was it\r\nto see the fleet of long ships coming up to the shore, with a serpent\r\nfor the figure-head, and a raven as the flag, and crowds of fierce\r\nwarriors with axes in their hands longing for prey and bloodshed, that\r\nwhere we pray in church that God would deliver us from lightning and\r\ntempest, and battle and murder, our forefathers used to add, "From\r\nthe fury of the Northmen, good Lord deliver us."\r\n\r\nTo England these Northmen came in great swarms, and chiefly from\r\nDenmark, so that they were generally call "the Danes."  They burnt\r\nthe houses, drove off the cows and sheep, killed the men, and took\r\naway the women and children to be slaves; and they were always most\r\ncruel of all where they found an Abbey with any monks or nuns,\r\nbecause they hated the Christian  faith.  By this time those seven\r\nEnglish kingdoms I told you of had all fallen into the hands of one\r\nking.  Egbert, King of the West Saxons, who reigned at Winchester,\r\nis counted as the first king of all England.  His four grandsons had\r\ndreadful battles with the Danes all their lives, and the three eldest\r\nall died quite young.  The youngest was the greatest and best king\r\nEngland ever had--Alfred the Truth-teller.  As a child Alfred excited\r\nthe hopes and admiration of all who saw him, and while his brothers\r\nwere busy with their sports, it was his delight to kneel at his\r\nmother\'s knee, and recite to her the Saxon ballads which his tutor\r\nhad read to him, inspiring him, at that early age, with the ardent\r\npatriotism and the passionate love of literature which rendered his\r\ncharacter so illustrious.  He was only twenty-two years old when he\r\ncame to the throne, and the kingdom was overrun everywhere with the\r\nDanes.  In the northern part some had even settled down and made\r\nthemselves at home, as the English had done four hundred years\r\nbefore, and more and more kept coming in their ships: so that, though\r\nAlfred beat them in battle again and again, there was no such thing\r\nas driving them away.  At last he had so very few faithful men left\r\nhim, that he thought it wise to send them away, and hide himself in\r\nthe Somersetshire marsh country.  There is a pretty story told of\r\nhim that he was hidden in the hut of a poor herdsman, whose wife,\r\nthinking he was a poor wandering soldier as he sat by the fire mending\r\nhis bow and arrows, desired him to turn the cakes she had set to bake\r\nupon the hearth.  Presently she found them burning, and cried out\r\nangrily, "Lazy rogue! you can\'t turn the cakes, though you can eat\r\nthem fast enough."\r\n\r\nHowever, that same spring, the brave English gained more victories;\r\nAlfred came out of his hiding place and gathered them all together,\r\nand beat the Danes, so that they asked for peace.  He said he would\r\nallow those who had settled in the North of England to stay there,\r\nprovided they would become Christians; and he stood godfather to\r\ntheir chief, and gave him the name of Ethelstane.  After this, Alfred\r\nhad stout ships built to meet the Danes at sea before they could come\r\nand land in England; and thus he kept them off, so that for all the\r\nrest of his reign, and that of his son and grandsons, they could do\r\nvery little mischief, and for a time left off coming at all, but went\r\nto rob other countries that were not so well guarded by brave kings.\r\n\r\nBut Alfred was not only a brave warrior.  He was a most good and holy\r\nman, who feared God above all things, and tried to do his very best\r\nfor his people.  He made good laws for them, and took care that every\r\none should be justly treated, and that nobody should do his neighbor\r\nwrong without being punished.  So many Abbeys had been burnt and the\r\nmonks killed by the Danes, that there were hardly any books to be had,\r\nor scholars to read them.  He invited learned men from abroad, and\r\nwrote and translated books himself for them; and he had a school in\r\nhis house, where he made the young nobles learn with his own sons.  He\r\nbuilt up the churches, and gave alms to the poor; and he was always\r\nready to hear the troubles of any poor man.  Though he was always\r\nworking so hard, he had a disease that used to cause him terrible pain\r\nalmost every day.  His last years were less peaceful than the middle\r\nones of his reign, for the Danes tried to come again; but he beat them\r\noff by his ships at sea, and when he died at fifty-two years old, in\r\nthe year 901, he left England at rest and quiet, and we always think of\r\nhim as one of the greatest and best kings who ever reigned in England,\r\nor in any other country.  As long as his children after him and his\r\npeople went on in the good way he had taught them, all prospered with\r\nthem, and no enemies hurt them; and this was all through the reigns\r\nof his son, his grandson, and great-grandsons.  Their council of great\r\nmen was called by a long word that is in our English, "Wise Men\'s\r\nMeeting," and there they settled the affairs of the kingdom.  The\r\nking\'s wife was not called queen, but lady; and what do you think\r\nlady means?  It means "loaf-giver"--giver of bread to her household\r\nand the poor.  so a lady\'s great work is to be charitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE DANISH CONQUEST.  A.D. 958--1035.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last very prosperous king was Alfred\'s great-grandson, Edgar, who\r\nwas owned as their over-lord by all the kings of the remains of the\r\nBritons in Wales and Scotland.  Once, eight of these kings came to\r\nmeet him at Chester, and rowed him in his barge along the river Dee.\r\nIt was the grandest day a king of England enjoyed for many years.\r\nEdgar was called the peaceable, because there were no attacks by the\r\nDanes at all through his reign.  In fact, the Northmen and Danes had\r\nbeen fighting among themselves at home, and these fights generally\r\nended in some one going off as a Sea-King, with all his friends, and\r\ntrying to gain a new home in some fresh country.  One great party of\r\nNorthmen under a very tall and mighty chief named Rollo, had some time\r\nbefore, thus gone to France, and forced the King to give them a great\r\npiece of his country, just opposite to England, which was called after\r\nthem Normandy.  There they learned to talk French, and grew like\r\nFrenchmen, though they remained a great deal braver, and more spirited\r\nthan any of their neighbors.\r\n\r\nThere were continually fleets of Danish ships coming to England; and\r\nthe son of Edgar, whose name was Ethelred, was a helpless, cowardly\r\nsort of man, so slow and tardy, that his people called him Ethelred\r\nthe Unready.  Instead of fitting out ships to fight against the Danes,\r\nhe took the money the ships ought to have cost to pay them to go away\r\nwithout plundering; and as to those who had come into the country\r\nwithout his leave, he called them his guard, took them into his pay,\r\nand let them live in the houses of the English, where they were very\r\nrude, and gave themselves great airs, making the English feed them on\r\nall their best meat, and bread, and beer, and always call them Lord\r\nDanes.  He made friends himself with the Northmen, or Normans, who\r\nhad settled in France, and married Emma, the daughter of their duke;\r\nbut none of his plans prospered: things grew worse and worse, and\r\nhis mind and his people\'s grew so bitter against the Danes, that\r\nat last it was agreed that all over the South of England every\r\nEnglishman should rise up in one night and murder the Dane who\r\nlodged in his house.\r\n\r\nAmong those Danes who were thus wickedly killed was the sister of the\r\nKing of Denmark.  Of course he was furious when he heard of it, and\r\ncame over to England determined to punish the cruel, treacherous king\r\nand people, and take the whole island for his own.  He did punish the\r\npeople, killing, burning, and plundering wherever he went; but he\r\ncould never get the king into his hands, for Ethelred went off in the\r\nheight of the danger to Normandy, where he had before sent his wife\r\nEmma, and her children, leaving his eldest son( child of his first\r\nwife), Edmund Ironside, to fight for the kingdom as best he might.\r\n\r\nThe King of Denmark died in the midst of his English war; but his son\r\nCnut went on with the conquest he had begun, and before long Ethelred,\r\nthe Unready died, and Edmund Ironside was murdered, and Cnut became\r\nKing of England, as well as of Denmark.  He became a Christian, and\r\nmarried Emma, Ethelred\'s widow, though she was much older than himself.\r\nHe had been a hard and cruel man, but he now laid aside his evil ways,\r\nand became a noble and wise and just king, a lover of churches and\r\ngood men; and the English seem to have been as well off under him as\r\nif he had been one of their own kings.  There is no king of whom more\r\npleasant stories are told.  One is of his wanting to go to church at\r\nEly Abbey one cold Candlemas Day.  Ely was on a hill in the middle of\r\na great marsh.  The marsh was frozen over; not strong enough to bear,\r\nand they all stood looking at it.  Then out stepped a stout countryman,\r\nwho was so fat, that his nickname was The Pudding.  "Are you all\r\nafraid?" he said.  "I will go over at once before the king."  "Will\r\nyou," said the king, "then I will come after you, for whatever bears\r\nyou will bear me."  Cnut was a little, slight man, and he got easily\r\nover, and Pudding got a piece of land for his reward.\r\n\r\nThese servants of the king used to flatter him.  They told him he was\r\nlord of land and sea, and that every thing would obey him.  "Let us\r\ntry," said Cnut, who wished to show them how foolish and profane they\r\nwere; "bring out my chair to the sea-side."  He was at Southampton at\r\nthe time, close to the sea, and the tide was coming in.  "Now sea," he\r\nsaid, as he sat down, "I am thy lord, dare not to come near, nor wet\r\nmy feet."  Of course the waves rolled on, and splashed over him; and\r\nhe turned to his servants, and bade them never say words that took\r\naway from the honor due to the only Lord of heaven and earth.  He\r\nnever put on his crown again after this, but hung it up in Winchester\r\nCathedral.  He was a thorough good king, and there was much grief when\r\nhe died, stranger though he was.\r\n\r\nA great many Danes had made their homes in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire,\r\never since Alfred\'s time, and some of their customs are still left\r\nthere, and some of their words.  The worst of them was that they were\r\ngreat drunkards, and the English learnt this bad custom of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE NORMAN CONQUEST.  A.D. 1035--1066.\r\n\r\n\r\nCnut left three sons; but one was content to be only King of Denmark,\r\nand the other two died very soon.  So a great English nobleman, called\r\nEarl Godwin, set up as king, Edward, one of those sons of Ethelred the\r\nUnready who had been sent away to Normandy.  He was a very kind, good,\r\npious man, who loved to do good.  He began the building of our grand\r\nchurch at Westminster Abbey, and he was so holy that he was called the\r\nConfessor, which is a word for good men not great enough to be called\r\nsaints.  He was too good-natured, as you will say when you hear that\r\none day, when he was in bed, he saw a thief come cautiously into his\r\nroom, open the chest where his treasure was, and take out the money-\r\nbags.  Instead of calling anyone, or seizing the man, the king only\r\nsaid, sleepily, "Take care, you rogue, or my chancellor will catch\r\nyou and give you a good whipping."\r\n\r\nYou can fancy that nobody much minded such a king as this, and so\r\nthere were many disturbances in his time.  Some of them rose out of\r\nthe king--who had been brought up in Normandy--liking the Normans\r\nbetter than the English.  They really were much cleverer and more\r\nsensible, for they had learnt a great deal in France, while the\r\nEnglish had forgotten much of what Alfred and his sons had taught\r\nthem, and all through the long, sad reign of Ethelred had been getting\r\nmore dull, and clumsy and rude.  Moreover, they had learnt of the Danes\r\nto be sad drunkards; but both they and the Danes thought the Norman\r\nFrench fine gentlemen, and could not bear the sight of them.\r\n\r\nThink, then, how angry they all were when it began to be said that King\r\nEdward wanted to leave his kingdom of England to his mother\'s Norman\r\nnephew, Duke William, because all his own near relations were still\r\nlittle boys, not likely to be grown up by the time the old king died.\r\nMany of the English wished for Harold, the son of Earl Godwin, a brave,\r\nspirited man; but Edward sent him to Normandy, and there Duke William\r\nmade him swear an oath not to do anything to hinder the kingdom from\r\nbeing given to Duke William.\r\n\r\nOld King Edward died soon after, and Harold said at once that his\r\npromise had been forced and cheated from him, so that he need not\r\nkeep it, and he was crowned King of England.  This filled William\r\nwith anger.  He called all his fighting Normans together, fitted\r\nout ships, and sailed across the English Channel to Dover.  The\r\nfigure-head of his own ship was a likeness of his second little boy,\r\nnamed William.  He landed at Pevensey, in Sussex, and set up his camp\r\nwhile Harold was away in the North, fighting with a runaway brother\r\nof his own, who had brought the Norwegians to attack Yorkshire.\r\nHarold had just won a great battle over these enemies when he heard\r\nthat William and his Normans had landed, and he had to hurry the\r\nwhole length of England to meet them.\r\n\r\nMany of the English would not join him, because they did not want him\r\nfor their king.  But though his army was not large, it was very brave.\r\nWhen he reached Sussex, he placed all his men on the top of a low hill,\r\nnear Hastings, and caused them to make a fence all round, with a ditch\r\nbefore it, and in the middle was his own standard, with a fighting man\r\nembroidered upon it.  Then the Normans rode up on their war-horses to\r\nattack him, one brave knight going first, singing.  The war-horses\r\nstumbled in the ditch, and the long spears of the English killed both\r\nmen and horses.  Then William ordered his archers to shoot their\r\narrows high in the air.  They came down like hail into the faces and\r\non the heads of the English.  Harold himself was pierced by one in the\r\neye.  The Normans charged the fence again, and broke through; and, by\r\nthe time night came on, Harold himself and all his brave Englishmen\r\nwere dead.  They did not flee away; they all staid, and were killed,\r\nfighting to the last; and only then was Harold\'s standard of the\r\nfighting man rooted up, and William\'s standard--a cross, which had\r\nbeen blessed by the Pope--planted instead of it.  So ended the battle\r\nof Hastings, in the year 1066.\r\n\r\nThe land has had a great many "conquests" hitherto--the Roman conquest,\r\nthe English conquest, and now the Norman conquest.  But there have\r\nbeen no more since; and the kings and queens have gone on in one long\r\nline ever since, from William of Normandy down to Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.  A.D. 1066--1087.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe king who had conquered England was a brave, strong man, who had\r\nbeen used to fighting and struggling ever since he was a young child.\r\n\r\nHe really feared God, and was in many ways a good man; but it had not\r\nbeen right of him to come and take another people\'s country by force;\r\nand the having done one wrong thing often makes people grow worse and\r\nworse.  Many of the English were unwilling to have William as their\r\nking, and his Norman friends were angry that he would not let them\r\nhave more of the English lands, nor break the English laws.  So they\r\nwere often rising up against him; and each time he had to put them\r\ndown he grew more harsh and stern.  He did not want to be cruel; but\r\nhe did many cruel things, because it was the only way to keep England.\r\n\r\nWhen the people of Northumberland rose against him, and tried to get\r\nback the old set of kings, he had the whole country wasted with fire\r\nand sword, till hardly a town or village was left standing.  He did\r\nthis to punish the Northumbrians, and frighten the rest.  But he did\r\nanother thing that was worse, because it was only for his own\r\namusement.  In Hampshire, near his castle of Winchester, there was a\r\ngreat space of heathy ground, and holly copse and beeches and oaks\r\nabove it, with deer and boars running wild in the glades--a beautiful\r\nplace for hunting, only that there were so many villages in it that\r\nthe creatures were disturbed and killed.  William liked hunting more\r\nthan anything else--his people said he loved the high deer as if he\r\nwas their father,--and to keep the place clear for them, he turned\r\nout all the inhabitants, and pulled down their houses, and made laws\r\nagainst any one killing his game.  The place he thus cleared is still\r\ncalled the New Forest, though it is a thousand years old.\r\n\r\nAn old Norman law that the English grumbled about very much was, that\r\nas soon as a bell was rung, at eight o\'clock every evening, everyone\r\nwas to put out candle and fire, and go to bed.  The bell was called\r\nthe curfew, and many old churches ring it still.\r\n\r\nWilliam caused a great list to be made of all the lands in the country,\r\nand who held them.  We have this list still, and it is called Domesday\r\nBook.  It shows that a great deal had been taken from the English and\r\ngiven to the Normans.  The king built castles, with immensely thick,\r\nstrong walls, and loop-hole windows, whence to shoot arrows; and here\r\nhe placed his Normans to keep the English down.  But the Normans were\r\neven more unruly than the English, and only his strong hand kept them\r\nin order.  They rode about in armor--helmets on their heads, a shirt\r\nof mail, made of iron linked together, over their bodies, gloves and\r\nboots of iron, swords by their sides, and lances in their hands--and\r\nthus they could bear down all before them.  They called themselves\r\nknights, and were always made to take an oath to befriend the weak,\r\nand poor, and helpless; but they did not often keep it towards the\r\npoor English.\r\n\r\nWilliam had four sons--Robert, who was called Court-hose or Short-legs;\r\nWilliam, called Rufus, because he had red hair; Henry, called Beau-\r\nclerc or the fine scholar; and Richard, who was still a lad when he\r\nwas killed by a stag in the New Forest.\r\n\r\nRobert, the eldest, was a wild, rude, thoughtless youth; but he fancied\r\nhimself fit to govern Normandy, and asked his father to give it up to\r\nhim.  King William answered, "I never take my clothes off before I go\r\nto bed," meaning that Robert must wait for his death.  Robert could\r\nnot bear to be laughed at, and was very angry.  Soon after, when he\r\nwas in the castle court, his two brothers, William and Henry, grew\r\nriotous, and poured water down from the upper windows on him and his\r\nfriends.  He flew into a passion, dashed up-stairs with his sword in\r\nhis hand, and might have killed his brothers if their father had not\r\ncome in to protect them.  Then he threw himself on his horse and\r\ngalloped away, persuaded some friends to join him, and actually fought\r\na battle with his own father, in which the old king was thrown off his\r\nhorse, and hurt in the hand; but we must do the prince the justice to\r\nsay that when he recognized his father in the knight whom he had\r\nunseated, he was filled with grief and horror, and eagerly sought his\r\npardon, and tenderly raised him from the ground.  Then Robert wandered\r\nabout, living on money that his mother, Queen Matilda, sent him, though\r\nhis father was angry with her for doing so, and this made the first\r\nquarrel the husband and wife had ever had.\r\n\r\nNot long after, William went to war with the King of France.  He had\r\ncaused a city to be burnt down, and was riding through the ruins, when\r\nhis horse trod on some hot ashes, and began to plunge.  The king was\r\nthrown forward on the saddle, and, being a very heavy, stout man, was\r\nso much hurt, that, after a few weeks, in the year 1087, he died at\r\na little monastery, a short way from Rouen, the chief city of his\r\ndukedom of Normandy.\r\n\r\nHe was the greatest man of his time, and he had much good in him; and\r\nwhen he lay on his death-bed he grieved much for all the evil he had\r\nbrought upon the English; but that could not undo it.  He had been a\r\ngreat church-builder, and so were his Norman bishops and barons.  You\r\nalways know their work, because it has round pillars, and round arches,\r\nwith broad borders of zig-zags, and all manner of patterns round them.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the coming of the Normans did the English much good, by\r\nbrightening them up and making them less dull and heavy; but they did\r\nnot like having a king and court who talked French, and cared more for\r\nNormandy than for England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM II., RUFUS.  A.D. 1087-1100.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam the Conqueror was obliged to let Normandy fall to Robert, his\r\neldest son; but he thought he could do as he pleased about England,\r\nwhich he had won for himself.  He had sent off his second son, William,\r\nto England, with his ring to Westminster, giving him a message that he\r\nhoped the English people would have him for their king.  And they did\r\ntake him, though they would hardly have done do if they had known what\r\nhe would be like when he was left to himself.  But while he was kept\r\nunder by his father, they only knew that he had red hair and a ruddy\r\nface, and had more sense than his brother Robert.  He is sometimes\r\ncalled the Red King, but more commonly William Rufus.  Things went\r\nworse than ever with the poor English in his time; for at lest William\r\nthe Conqueror had made everybody mind the law, but now William Rufus\r\nlet his cruel soldiers do just as they pleased, and spoil what they\r\ndid not want.  It was of no use to complain, for the king would only\r\nlaugh and make jokes.  He did not care for God or man; only for being\r\npowerful, for feasting, and for hunting.\r\n\r\nJust at this time there was a great stir in Europe.  Jerusalem--that\r\nholy city, where our blessed Lord had taught, where he had been\r\ncrucified, and where he had risen from the dead--was a place where\r\neveryone wished to go and worship, and this they called going on\r\npilgrimage.  A beautiful church had once been built over the sepulchre\r\nwhere our Lord had lain, and enriched with gifts.  But for a long time\r\npast Jerusalem had been in the hands of an Eastern people, who think\r\ntheir false prophet, Mahommed, greater than our blessed Lord.  These\r\nMahommedans used to rob and ill-treat the pilgrims, and make them\r\npay great sums of money for leave to come into Jerusalem.  At last\r\na pilgrim, named Peter the Hermit, came home, and got leave from\r\nthe Pope to try to go to the Holy Land, and fight to get the Holy\r\nSepulchre back into Christian hands again.  He used to preach in the\r\nopen air, and the people who heard him were so stirred up that they\r\nall shouted out, "It is God\'s will!  It is God\'s will!"  And each who\r\nundertook to go and fight in the East received a cross cut out into\r\ncloth, red or white, to wear on his shoulder.  Many thousands promised\r\nto go on this crusade, as they called it, among them was Robert, Duke\r\nof Normandy. But he had wasted his money, so that he could not fit out\r\nan army to take with him.  So he offered to give up Normandy to his\r\nbrother William while he was gone, if William would let him have the\r\nmoney he wanted.  The Red King was very ready to make such a bargain,\r\nand he laughed at the Crusaders, and thought that they were wasting\r\ntheir time and trouble.\r\n\r\nThey had a very good man to lead them, named Godfrey de Buillon; and,\r\nafter many toils and troubles, they did gain Jerusalem, and could\r\nkneel, weeping, at the Holy Sepulchre.  It was proposed to make Robert\r\nKing of Jerusalem, but he would not accept the offer, and Godfrey was\r\nmade king instead, and staid to guard the holy places, while Duke\r\nRobert set out on his return home.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Red King had gone on in as fierce and ungodly a\r\nway as ever, laughing good advice to scorn, and driving away the good\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, St. Anselm, and everyone else who tried to\r\nwarn him or withstand his wickedness.  One day, in the year 1100, he\r\nwent out to hunt deer in the New Forest, which his father had wasted,\r\nlaughing and jesting in his rough way.  By and by he was found under\r\nan oak tree, with an arrow through his heart; and a wood-cutter took\r\nup his body in his cart, and carried it to Winchester Cathedral, where\r\nis was buried.\r\n\r\nWho shot the arrow nobody knew, and nobody ever will know.  Some\r\nthought it must be a knight, named Walter Tyrrell, to whom the king\r\nhad given three long good arrows that morning.  He rode straight away\r\nto Southampton, and went off to the Holy Land; so it is likely that\r\nhe knew something about the king\'s death.  But he never seems to have\r\ntold any one, whether it was only an accident, or a murder, or who\r\ndid it.  Anyway, it was a fearful end, for a bad man to die in his\r\nsin, without a moment to repent and pray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nHENRY I., BEAU-CLERC.  A.D. 1100--1135.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry, the brother of William Rufus, was one of the hunting party; and\r\nas soon as the cry spread through the forest that the king was dead, he\r\nrode off at full speed to Winchester, and took possession of all his\r\nbrother\'s treasure.  William Rufus had never been married, and left no\r\nchildren, and Henry was much the least violent and most sensible of\r\nthe brothers; and, as he promised to govern according to the old laws\r\nof England, he did not find it difficult to persuade the people to let\r\nhim be crowned king.\r\n\r\nHe was not really a good man, and he could be very cruel sometimes, as\r\nwell as false and cunning; but he kept good order, and would not allow\r\nsuch horrible things to be done as in his brother\'s time.  So the\r\nEnglish were better off than they had been, and used to say the king\r\nwould let no one break the laws but himself.  They were pleased, too,\r\nthat Henry married a lady who was half English--Maude, the daughter of\r\nMalcolm Greathead, King of Scotland, and of a lady of the old English\r\nroyal line.  They loved her greatly, and called her good Queen Maude.\r\n\r\nRobert came back to Normandy, and tried to make himself King of\r\nEngland; but Henry soon drove him back.  The brothers went on\r\nquarreling for some years, and Robert managed Normandy miserably, and\r\nwasted his money, so that he sometimes had no clothes to wear, and lay\r\nin bed for want of them.\r\n\r\nSome of the Normans could not bear this any longer, and invited Henry\r\nto come and take the dukedom.  He came with an army, many of whom were\r\nEnglish, and fought a battle with Robert and his faithful Normans at\r\nTrenchebray, in Normandy.  They gained a great victory, and the English\r\nthought it made up for Hastings.  Poor Robert was made prisoner by his\r\nbrother, who sent him off to Cardiff Castle, in Wales, where he lived\r\nfor twenty-eight years, and then died, and was buried in Gloucester\r\nCathedral, with his figure made in bog oak over his monument.\r\n\r\nHenry had two children--William and Maude.  The girl was married to\r\nthe Emperor of Germany and the boy was to be the husband of Alice,\r\ndaughter to the Count of Anjou, a great French Prince, whose lands\r\nwere near Normandy.  It was the custom to marry children very young\r\nthen, before they were old enough to leave their parents and make a\r\nhome for themselves.  So William was taken by his father to Anjou, and\r\nthere married to the little girl, and then she was left behind, while\r\nhe was to return to England with his father.  Just as he was going to\r\nembark, a man came to the king, and begged to have the honor of taking\r\nhim across in his new vessel, called the White Ship.  Henry could not\r\nchange his own plans; but, as the man begged so hard, he said his son,\r\nthe young bridegroom, and his friends might go in the White Ship.\r\nThey sailed in the evening, and there was a great merry-making on\r\nboard, till the sailors grew so drunk that they did not know how to\r\nguide the ship, and ran her against a rock.  She filled with water\r\nand began to sink.  A boat was lowered, and William safely placed in\r\nit; but, just as he was rowed off he heard the cries of the ladies\r\nwho were left behind, and caused the oarsmen to turn back for them.\r\nSo many drowning wretches crowded into it, as soon as it came near,\r\nthat it sank with their weight, and all were lost.  Only the top-mast\r\nof the ship remained above water, and to it clung a butcher and the\r\nowner of the ship all night long.  When daylight came, and the owner\r\nknew that the king\'s son was really dead, and by his fault, he lost\r\nheart, let go the mast and was drowned.  Only the butcher was taken\r\noff alive; and for a long time no one durst tell the king what had\r\nhappened.  At last a boy was sent to fall at his feet, and tell him\r\nhis son was dead.  He was a broken-hearted man, and never knew\r\ngladness again all the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nHis daughter Maude had lost her German husband, and came home.  He\r\nmade her marry Geoffrey of Anjou, the brother of his son\'s wife, and\r\ncalled upon all his chief noblemen to swear that they would take her\r\nfor their queen in England and their duchess in Normandy after his\r\nown death.\r\n\r\nHe did not live much longer.  His death was caused, in the year 1135,\r\nby eating too much of the fish called lamprey, and he was buried in\r\nReading Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN.  A.D. 1135--1154.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither English nor Normans had ever been ruled by a woman, and the\r\nEmpress Maude, as she still called herself, was a proud, disagreeable,\r\nill-tempered woman, whom nobody liked.  So her cousin, Stephen de\r\nBlois--whose mother, Adela, had been daughter of William the Conqueror\r\n--thought to obtain the crown of England by promising to give everyone\r\nwhat they wished.  It was very wrong of him; for he, like all the\r\nother barons, had sworn that Maude should reign.  But the people knew\r\nhe was a kindly, gracious sort of person, and greatly preferred him\r\nto her.  So he was crowned; and at once all the Norman barons, whom\r\nKing Henry had kept down, began to think they could have their own\r\nway.  They built strong castles, and hired men, with whom they made\r\nwar upon each other, robbed one another\'s tenants, and, when they saw\r\na peaceable traveler on his way, they would dash down upon him, drag\r\nhim into the castle, take away all the jewels or money he had about\r\nhim, or, if he had none, they would shut him up and torment him till\r\nhe could get his friends to pay them a sum to let him loose.\r\n\r\nStephen, who was a kind-hearted man himself, tried to stop these\r\ncruelties; but then the barons turned round on him, told him he was\r\nnot their proper king, and invited Maude to come and be crowned in\r\nhis stead.  She came very willingly; and her uncle, King David of\r\nScotland, set out with an army to fight for her; but all the English\r\nin the north came out to drive him back; and they beat him and his\r\nScots at what they call the Battle of the Standard, because the\r\nEnglish had a holy standard, which was kept in Durham Cathedral.\r\nSoon after, Stephen was taken prisoner at a battle at Lincoln, and\r\nthere was nothing to prevent Maude from being queen but her own bad\r\ntemper.  She went to Winchester, and was there proclaimed; but she\r\nwould not speak kindly or gently to the people; and when her friends\r\nentreated her to reply more kindly, she flew into a passion, and it\r\nis even said that she gave a box on the ear to her uncle--the good\r\nKing of Scotland, who had come to help her--for reproving her for her\r\nharsh answers.  When Stephen\'s wife came to beg her to set him free,\r\npromising that he should go away beyond the seas, and never interfere\r\nwith her again, she would not listen, and drove her away.  But she\r\nsoon found how foolish she had been.  Stephen\'s friends would have\r\nbeen willing that he should give up trying to be king, but they could\r\nnot leave him in prison for life; and so they went on fighting for\r\nhim, while more and more of the English joined them, as they felt how\r\nbad and unkind a queen they had in the Empress.  Indeed, she was so\r\nproud and violent, that her husband would not come over to England\r\nto help her, but staid to govern Normandy.  She was soon in great\r\ndistress, and had to flee from Winchester, riding through the midst\r\nof the enemy, and losing almost all her friends by the way as they\r\nwere slain or made prisoners.  Her best helper of all--Earl Robert of\r\nGloucester--was taken while guarding her; and she could only get to\r\nhis town of Gloucester by lying down in a coffin, with holes for air,\r\nand being thus carried through all the country, where she had made\r\neveryone hate her.\r\n\r\nStephen\'s wife offered to set the Earl free, if the other side would\r\nrelease her husband; and this exchange was brought about.  Robert then\r\nwent to Normandy, to fetch Maude\'s little son Henry, who was ten years\r\nold, leaving her, as he thought, safe in Oxford Castle; but no sooner\r\nwas he gone than Stephen brought his army, and besieged the Castle--\r\nthat is, he brought his men round it, tried to climb up the walls, or\r\nbeat them down with heavy beams, and hindered any food from being\r\nbrought in.  Everything in the castle that could be eaten was gone;\r\nbut Maude was determined not to fall into her enemy\'s hands.  It was\r\nthe depth of winter; the river below the walls was frozen over, and\r\nsnow was on the ground.  One night, Maude dressed herself and three of\r\nher knights all in white, and they were, one by one, let down by ropes\r\nfrom the walls.  No one saw them in the snow.  They crossed the river\r\non the ice, walked a great part of the night, and at last came to\r\nAbingdon, where horses were waiting for them, and thence they rode to\r\nWallingford, where Maude met her little son.\r\n\r\nThere was not much more fighting after this.  Stephen kept all the\r\neastern part of the kingdom, and Henry was brought up at Gloucester\r\ntill his father sent for him, to take leave of him before going on a\r\ncrusade.  Geoffrey died during this crusade.  He was fond of hunting,\r\nand was generally seen with a spray of broom blossom in his cap.  The\r\nFrench name for this plant is _genet_; and thus his nickname was\r\n"Plantagenet;" and this became a kind of surname to the kings of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nHenry, called Fitz-empress--or "the Empress\'s son"--came to England\r\nagain as soon as he was grown up; but instead of going to war, he made\r\nan agreement with Stephen.  Henry would not attack Stephen any more,\r\nbut leave him to reign all the days of his life, provided Stephen\r\nengaged that Henry should reign instead of his own son after his death.\r\nThis made Stephen\'s son, Eustace, very angry, and he went away in a\r\nrage to raise troops to maintain his cause; but he died suddenly in\r\nthe midst of his wild doings, and the king, his father, did not live\r\nlong after him, but died in 1154.\r\n\r\nMaude had learnt wisdom by her misfortunes.  She had no further desire\r\nto be queen, but lived a retired life in a convent, and was much more\r\nrespected there than as queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nHENRY II., FITZ-EMPRESS.  A.D. 1154-1189.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Fitz-Empress is counted as the first king of the Plantagenet\r\nfamily, also called the House of Anjou.  He was a very clever, brisk,\r\nspirited man, who hardly ever sat down, but was always going from\r\nplace to place, and who would let no one disobey him.  He kept\r\neverybody in order, pulled down almost all the Castles that had been\r\nbuilt in Stephen\'s time, and would not let the barons ill-treat the\r\npeople.  Indeed, everyone had been so mixed up together during the\r\nwars in Stephen\'s reign, that the grandchildren of the Normans who\r\nhad come over with William the Conqueror were now quite English in\r\ntheir feelings.  French was, however, chiefly spoken at court.  The\r\nking was really a Frenchman, and he married a French wife Eleanor,\r\nthe lady of Aquitaine, a great dukedom in the South of France; and,\r\nas Henry had already Normandy and Anjou, he really was lord of nearly\r\nhalf France.  He ruled England well; but he was not a good man, for\r\nhe cared for power and pleasure more than for what was right; and\r\nsometimes he fell into such rages that he would roll on the floor,\r\nand bite the rushes and sticks it was strewn with.  He made many laws.\r\nOne was that, if a priest or monk was thought to have committed any\r\ncrime, he should be tried by the king\'s judge, instead of the bishop.\r\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas a Becket, did not think it\r\nright to consent to this law; and, though he and the king had once\r\nbeen great friends, Henry was so angry with him that he was forced\r\nto leave England, and take shelter with the King of France.  Six\r\nyears passed by, and the king pretended to be reconciled to him, but\r\nstill, when they met, would not give him the kiss of peace.  The\r\narchbishop knew that this showed that the king still hated him; but\r\nhis flock had been so long without a shepherd that he thought it his\r\nduty to go back to them.  Just after his return, he laid under censure\r\nsome persons who had given offence.  They went and complained to the\r\nking, and Henry exclaimed in passion, "Will no one rid me of this\r\nturbulent priest?"  Four of his knights who heard these words set\r\nforth to Canterbury.  The archbishop guessed why they were come;\r\nbut he would not flee again, and waited for them by the altar in\r\nthe cathedral, not even letting the doors be shut.  There they slew\r\nhim; and thither, in great grief at the effect of his own words, the\r\nking came--three years later--to show his penitence by entering\r\nbarefoot, kneeling before Thomas\'s tomb, and causing every priest\r\nor monk in turn to strike him with a rod.  We should not exactly\r\ncall Thomas a martyr now, but he was thought so then, because he\r\ndied for upholding the privileges of the Church, and he was held\r\nto be a very great saint.\r\n\r\nWhile this dispute was going on, the Earl of Pembroke, called\r\nStrongbow, one of Henry\'s nobles, had gone over to Ireland and\r\nobtained a little kingdom there, which he professed to hold of Henry;\r\nand thus the Kings of England became Lords of Ireland, though for a\r\nlong time they only had the Province of Leinster, and were always at\r\nwar with the Irish around.\r\n\r\nHenry was a most powerful king; but his latter years were very unhappy.\r\nHis wife was not a good woman, and her sons were all disobedient and\r\nrebellious.  Once all the three eldest, Henry, Richard, and Geoffrey,\r\nand their mother, ran away together from his court, and began to make\r\nwar upon him.  He was much stronger and wiser than they so he soon\r\nforced them to submit; and he sent Queen Eleanor away, and shut her\r\nup in a strong castle in England as long as he lived.  Here sons were\r\nmuch more fond of her than of their father, and they thought this\r\nusage so hard, that they were all the more ready to break out against\r\nhim.  The eldest son, Henry, was leading an army against his father,\r\nwhen he was taken ill, and felt himself dying.  He sent an entreaty\r\nthat his father would forgive him, and come to see him; but the young\r\nman had so often been false and treacherous, that Henry feared it was\r\nonly a trick to get him as a prisoner, and only sent his ring and a\r\nmessage of pardon; and young Henry died, pressing the ring to his\r\nlips, and longing to hear his father\'s voice.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey, the third son, was killed by a fall from his horse, and\r\nthere were only two left alive, Richard and John.  Just at this time,\r\nnews came that the Mahommedans in the Holy Land had won Jerusalem\r\nback again; and the Pope called on all Christian princes to leave\r\noff quarreling, and go on a crusade to recover the Holy Sepulchre.\r\n\r\nThe kings of England and France, young Richard, and many more, were\r\nroused to take the cross; but while arrangements for going were being\r\nmade, a fresh dispute about them arose, and Richard went away in a\r\nrage, got his friends together, and, with King Philip of France to\r\nhelp him, began to make war.  His father was feeble, and worn out,\r\nand could not resist as in former times.  He fell ill, and gave up\r\nthe struggle, saying he would grant all they asked.  The list of\r\nRichard\'s friends whom he was to pardon was brought to him, and the\r\nfirst name he saw in it was that of John, his youngest son, and his\r\ndarling, the one who had never before rebelled.  That quite broke\r\nhis heart, his illness grew worse, and he talked about an old eagle\r\nbeing torn to pieces by his eaglets.  And so, in the year 1189,\r\nHenry II. died the saddest death, perhaps, that an old man can die,\r\nfor his sons had brought down his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nRICHARD I., LION-HEART  A.D. 1189--1199.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard was greatly grieved at his father\'s death, and when he came\r\nand looked at the dead body, in Fontevraud Abbey Church, he cried\r\nout, "Alas! it was I who killed him!"  But it was too late now: he\r\ncould not make up for what he had done, and he had to think about the\r\nCrusade he had promised to make.  Richard was so brave and strong that\r\nhe was called Lion-heart; he was very noble and good in some ways, but\r\nhis fierce, passionate temper did him a great deal of harm.  He, and\r\nKing Philip of France, and several other great princes, all met in the\r\nisland of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea, and thence sailed for the\r\nHoly Land.  The lady whom Richard was to marry came to meet him in\r\nSicily.  Her name was Berengaria; but, as it was Lent, he did not\r\nmarry her then.  She went on to the Holy Land in a ship with his\r\nsister Joan, and tried to land in the island of Cypress; but the\r\npeople were inhospitable, and would not let them come.  So Richard,\r\nin his great anger, conquered the isle, and was married to Berengaria\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe Mahommedans who held Palestine at that time were called Saracens,\r\nand had a very brave prince at their head named Saladin, which means\r\nSplendor of Religion.  He was very good, just, upright, and truth-\r\ntelling, and his Saracens fought so well, that the Crusaders would\r\nhardly have won a bit of ground if the Lion-heart had not been so\r\nbrave.  At last, they did take one city on the coast named Acre; and\r\none of the princes, Leopold, Duke of Austria, set up his banner on\r\nthe walls.  Richard did not think it ought to be there: he pulled it\r\nup and threw it down into the ditch, asking the duke how he durst take\r\nthe honors of a king.  Leopold was sullen, and brooded over the insult,\r\nand King Philip thought Richard so overbearing, that he could not bear\r\nto be in the army with him any longer.  In truth, though Philip had\r\npretended to be his friend, and had taken his part against his father,\r\nthat was really only to hurt King Henry;  he hated Richard quite as\r\nmuch, or more, and only wanted to get home first in order to do him\r\nas much harm as he could while he was away.  So Philip said it was\r\ntoo hot for him in the Holy Land, and made him ill.  He sailed back\r\nto France, while Richard remained, though the climate really did hurt\r\nhis health, and he often had fevers there.  When he was ill, Saladin\r\nused to send him grapes, and do all he could to show how highly he\r\nthought of so brave a man.  Once Saladin sent him a beautiful horse;\r\nRichard told the Earl of Salisbury to try it, and no sooner was the\r\nearl mounted, than the horse ran away with him to the Saracen army.\r\nSaladin was very much vexed, and was afraid it would be taken for\r\na trick to take the English king prisoner, and he gave the earl a\r\nquieter horse to ride back with.  Richard fought one terrible battle\r\nat Joppa with the Saracens, and then he tried to go on to take\r\nJerusalem; but he wanted to leave a good strong castle behind him\r\nat Ascalon, and set all his men to work to build it up.  When they\r\ngrumbled, he worked with them, and asked the duke to do the same; but\r\nLeopold said gruffly that he was not a carpenter or a mason.  Richard\r\nwas so provoked that he struck him a blow, and the duke went home in\r\na rage.\r\n\r\nSo many men had gone home, that Richard found his army was not strong\r\nenough to try to take Jerusalem.  He was greatly grieved, for he knew\r\nit was his own fault for not having shown the temper of a Crusader;\r\nand when he came to the top of a hill whence the Holy City could be\r\nseen, he would not look at it, but turned away, saying, "They who are\r\nnot worthy to win it are not worthy to behold it."  It was of no use\r\nfor him to stay with so few men; besides, tidings came from home that\r\nKing Philip and his own brother, John, were doing all the mischief\r\nthey could.  So he made a peace for three years between the Saracens\r\nand Christians, hoping to come back again after that to rescue\r\nJerusalem.  But on his way home there were terrible storms; his ships\r\nwere scattered, and his own ship was driven up into the Adriatic Sea,\r\nwhere he was robbed by pirates, or sea robbers, and then was\r\nshipwrecked.  There was no way for him to get home but through the\r\nlands of Leopold of Austria; so he pretended to be a merchant, and\r\nset out attended only by a boy.  He fell ill at a little inn, and\r\nwhile he was in bed the boy went into the kitchen with the king\'s\r\nglove in his belt.  It was an embroidered glove, such as merchants\r\nnever used, and people asked questions, and guessed that the boy\'s\r\nmaster must be some great man.  The Duke of Austria heard of it,\r\nsent soldiers to take him, and shut him up as a prisoner in one of\r\nhis castles.  Afterwards, the duke gave him up for a large sum of\r\nmoney to the Emperor of Germany.  All this time Richard\'s wife and\r\nmother had been in great sorrow and fear, trying to find out what\r\nhad become of him.  It is said that he was found at last by his\r\nfriend, the minstrel Blondel.  A minstrel was a person who made\r\nverses and sang them.  Many of the nobles and knights in Queen\r\nEleanor\'s Duchy of Aquitaine were minstrels--and Richard was a very\r\ngood one himself, and amused himself in his captivity by making\r\nverses.  This is certainly true--though I cannot answer for it that\r\nthe pretty story is true, which says that Blondel sung at all the\r\ncastle courts in Germany, till he heard his master\'s voice take up\r\nand reply to his song.\r\n\r\nThe Queens, Eleanor and Berengaria, raised a ransom--that is, a sum\r\nof money to buy his freedom--though his brother John tried to prevent\r\nthem, and the King of France did his best to hinder the emperor from\r\nreleasing him; but the Pope insisted that the brave crusader should\r\nbe set at liberty: and Richard came home, after a year and a half of\r\ncaptivity.  He freely forgave John for all the mischief he had done\r\nor tried to do, though he thought so ill of him as to say, "I wish\r\nI may forget John\'s injuries to me as soon as he will forget my pardon\r\nof him."\r\n\r\nRichard only lived two years after he came back.  He was besieging a\r\ncastle in Aquitaine, where there was some treasure that he thought was\r\nunlawfully kept from him, when he was struck in the shoulder by a bolt\r\nfrom a cross-bow, and the surgeons treated it so unskilfully that in\r\na few days he died.  The man who had shot the bolt was made prisoner,\r\nbut the Lion-heart\'s last act was to command that no harm should be\r\ndone to him.  The soldiers, however, in their grief and rage for the\r\nking, did put him to death in a cruel manner.\r\n\r\nRichard desired to be burned at the feet of his father, in Fontevraud\r\nAbbey, where he once bewailed his undutiful conduct, and now wished\r\nhis body forever to lie in penitence.  The figures in stone, of the\r\nfather, mother, and son, who quarreled so much in life, all lie on\r\none monument now, and with them Richard\'s youngest sister Joan, who\r\ndied nearly at the same time as he died, party of grief for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nJOHN, LACKLAND.  A.D. 1199--1216.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a kind of joke, John, King Henry\'s youngest son, had been called\r\nLackland, because he had nothing when his brothers each had some great\r\ndukedom.  The name suited him only too well before the end of his life.\r\nThe English made him king at once.  They always did take a grown-up\r\nman for their king, if the last king\'s son was but a child.  Richard\r\nhad never had any children, but his brother Geoffrey, who was older\r\nthan John, had left a son named Arthur, who was about twelve years\r\nold, and who was rightly the Duke of Normandy and Count of Anjou.\r\nKing Philip, who was always glad to vex whoever was king of England,\r\ntook Arthur under his protection, and promised to get Normandy out of\r\nJohn\'s hands.  However, John had a meeting with him and persuaded him\r\nto desert Arthur, and marry his son Louis to John\'s own niece, Blanche,\r\nwho had a chance of being queen of part of Spain.  Still Arthur lived\r\nat the French King\'s court, and when he was sixteen years old, Philip\r\nhelped him to raise an army and go to try his fortune against his\r\nuncle.  He laid siege to Mirabeau, a town where his grandmother, Queen\r\nEleanor, was living.  John, who was then in Normandy, hurried to her\r\nrescue, beat Arthur\'s army, made him prisoner and carried him off,\r\nfirst to Rouen, and then to the strong castle of Falaise.  Nobody\r\nquite knows what was done to him there.  The governor, Hubert de\r\nBurgh, once found him fighting hard, though with no weapon but a\r\nstool, to defend himself from some ruffians who had been sent to put\r\nout his eyes.  Hubert saved him from these men, but shortly after\r\nthis good man was sent elsewhere by the king, and John came himself\r\nto Falaise.  Arthur was never seen alive again, and it is believed\r\nthat John took him out in a boat in the river at night, stabbed him\r\nwith his own hand, and threw his body into the river.  There was, any\r\nway, no doubt that John was guilty of his nephew\'s death, and he was\r\nfully known to be one of the most selfish and cruel men who ever\r\nlived; and so lazy, that he let Philip take Normandy from him, without\r\nstirring a finger to save the grand old dukedom of his forefathers; so\r\nthat nothing is left of it to us now but the four little islands,\r\nGuernsey, Jersey, Alderney, and Sark.\r\n\r\nMatters became much worse in England, when he quarreled with the Pope,\r\nwhose name was Innocent, about who should be archbishop of Canterbury.\r\nThe Pope wanted a man named Stephen Langton to be archbishop, but the\r\nking swore he should never come into the kingdom.  Then the Pope\r\npunished the kingdom, by forbidding all church services in all parish\r\nchurches.  The was termed putting the kingdom under an interdict.\r\nJohn was not much distressed by this, though his people were; but when\r\nhe found that Innocent was stirring up the King of France to come to\r\nattack him, he thought it time to make his peace with the Pope.  So he\r\nnot only consented to receive Stephen Langton, but he even knelt down\r\nbefore the Pope\'s legate, or messenger, and took off his crown, giving\r\nit up to the legate, in token that he only held the kingdom from the\r\nPope.  It was two or three days before it was given back to him; and\r\nthe Pope held himself to be lord of England, and made the king and\r\npeople pay him money whenever he demanded it.\r\n\r\nAll this time John\'s cruelty and savageness were making the whole\r\nkingdom miserable; and at last the great barons could bear it no\r\nlonger.  They met together and agreed that they would make John swear\r\nto govern by the good old English laws that had prevailed before the\r\nNormans came.  The difficulty was to be sure of what these laws were,\r\nfor most of the copies of them had been lost.  However, Archbishop\r\nLangton and some of the wisest of the barons put together a set of\r\nlaws--some copied, some recollected, some old, some new--but all such\r\nas to give the barons some control of the king, and hinder him from\r\ngetting savage soldiers together to frighten people into doing\r\nwhatever he chose to make them.  These laws they called Magna Carta,\r\nor the great charter; and they all came in armor, and took John\r\nby surprise at Windsor.  He came to meet them in a meadow named\r\nRunnymede, on the bank of the Thames, and there they forced him to\r\nsign the charter, for which all Englishmen are grateful to them.\r\n\r\nBut he did not mean to keep it!  No, not he!  He had one of his\r\nfather\'s fits of rage when he got back to Windsor Castle--he gnawed\r\nthe sticks for rage and swore he was no king.  Then he sent for more\r\nof the fierce soldiers, who went about in bands, ready to be hired,\r\nand prepared to take vengeance on the barons.  They found themselves\r\nnot strong enough to make head against him; so they invited Louis, the\r\nson of Philip of France and husband of John\'s niece, to come and be\r\ntheir king.  He came, and was received in London, while John and his\r\nbands of soldiers were roaming about the eastern counties, wasting\r\nand burning everywhere till they came to the Wash--that curious bay\r\nbetween Lincolnshire and Norfolk, where so many rivers run into the\r\nsea.  There is a safe way across the sands in this bay when the tide\r\nis low, but when it is coming in and meets the rivers, the waters\r\nrise suddenly into a flood.  So it happened to King John; he did get\r\nout himself, but all carts with his goods and treasures were lost,\r\nand many of his men.  He was full of rage and grief, but he went on\r\nto the abbey where he meant to sleep.  He supped on peaches and new\r\nale, and soon after became very ill.  He died in a few days, a\r\nmiserable, disgraced man, with half his people fighting against him\r\nand London in the hands of his worst enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nHENRY III., OF WINCHESTER.  A.D. 1216--1272.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing John left two little sons, Henry and Richard, nine and seven\r\nyears old, and all the English barons felt that they would rather\r\nhave Henry as their king than the French Louis, whom they had only\r\ncalled in because John was such a wretch.  So when little Henry had\r\nbeen crowned at Gloucester, with his mother\'s bracelet, swearing to\r\nrule according to Magna Carta, and good Hubert de Burgh undertook to\r\ngovern for him, one baron after another came back to him.  Louis was\r\nbeaten in a battle at Lincoln; and when his wife sent him more troops,\r\nHubert de Burgh got ships together and sunk many vessels, and drove\r\nthe others back in the Straits of Dover; so that Louis was forced to\r\ngo home and leave England in peace.\r\n\r\nHenry must have been too young to understand about Magna Carta when\r\nhe swore to it, but it was the trouble of all his long reign to get\r\nhim to observe it.  It was not that he was wicked like his father--\r\nfor he was very religious and kind-hearted--but he was too good-\r\nnatured, and never could say No to anybody.  Bad advisers got about\r\nhim when he grew up, and persuaded him to let them take good Hubert\r\nde Burgh and imprison him.  He had taken refuge in a church, but they\r\ndragged him out and took him to a blacksmith to have chains put on his\r\nfeet; the smith however said he would never forge chains for the man\r\nwho had saved his country from the French.  De Burgh was afterwards\r\nset free, and died in peace and honor.\r\n\r\nHenry was a builder of beautiful churches.  Westminster Abbey, as it\r\nis now, was one.  And he was so charitable to the poor that, when he\r\nhad his children weighed, he gave their weight in gold and silver in\r\nalms.  But he gave to everyone who asked, and so always wanted money;\r\nand sometimes his men could get nothing for the king and queen to eat,\r\nbut by going and taking sheep and poultry from the poor farmers around;\r\nso that things were nearly as bad as under William Rufus--because the\r\nking was foolishly good-natured.  The Pope was always sending for\r\nmoney, too; and the king tried to raise it in ways that, according to\r\nMagna Carta, he had sworn not to do.  His foreign friends told him\r\nthat if he minded Magna Carta he would be a poor creature--not like\r\na king who might do all he pleased; and whenever he listened to them\r\nhe broke the laws of Magna Carta.  Then, when his barons complained\r\nand frightened him, he swore again to keep them; so that nobody could\r\ntrust him, and his weakness was almost as bad for the kingdom as John\'s\r\nwickedness.  When they could bear it no longer, the barons all met him\r\nat the council which was called the Parliament, from a French word\r\nmeaning talk.  This time they came in armor, bringing all their\r\nfighting men, and declared that he had broken his word so often that\r\nthey should appoint some of their own number to watch him, and hinder\r\nhis doing anything against the laws he had sworn to observe, or from\r\ngetting money from the people without their consent.  He was very\r\nangry; but he was in their power, and had to submit to swear that\r\nso it should be; and Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who had\r\nmarried his sister, was appointed among the lords who were to keep\r\nwatch over him.  Henry could not bear this; he felt himself to be\r\nless than ever a king, and tried to break loose.  He had never cared\r\nfor his promises; but his brave son Edward, who was now grown up,\r\ncared a great deal: and they put the question to Louis, King of France,\r\nwhether the king was bound by the oath he had made to be under\r\nMontfort and his council.  This Louis was son to the one who had been\r\ndriven back by Hubert de Burgh.  He was one of the best men and kings\r\nthat ever lived, and he tried to judge rightly; but he scarcely thought\r\nhow much provocation Henry had given, when he said that subjects had\r\nno right to frighten their king, and so that Henry and Edward were\r\nnot obliged to keep the oath.\r\n\r\nThereupon they got an army together, and so did Simon de Montfort and\r\nthe barons; and they met at a place called Lewes, in Sussex.  Edward\r\ngot the advantage at first, and galloped away, driving his enemies\r\nbefore him; but when he turned round and came back, he found that\r\nSimon de Montfort had beaten the rest of the army, and made his father\r\nand uncle Richard prisoners.  Indeed, the barons threatened to cut off\r\nRichard\'s head if Edward went on fighting with them; and to save his\r\nuncle\'s life, he too, gave himself up to them.\r\n\r\nSimon de Montfort now governed all the kingdom.  He still called Henry\r\nking, but did not let him do anything, and watched him closely that\r\nhe might not get away; and Edward was kept a prisoner--first in one\r\ncastle, then in another.  Simon was a good and high-minded man\r\nhimself, who only wanted to do what was best for everyone; but he had\r\na family of proud and overbearing sons, who treated all who came in\r\ntheir way so ill, that most of the barons quarreled with them.  One\r\nof these barons sent Edward a beautiful horse; and one day when he\r\nwas riding out from Hereford Castle with his keepers, he proposed to\r\nthem to ride races, while he was to look on and decide which was the\r\nswiftest.  Thus they all tired out their horses, and as soon as he\r\nsaw that they could hardly get them along, Edward spurred his own\r\nfresh horse, and galloped off to meet the friends who were waiting\r\nfor him.  All who were discontented with the Montforts joined him,\r\nand he soon had a large army.  He marched against Montfort, and met\r\nhim at Evesham.  The poor old king was in Montfort\'s army, and in\r\nthe battle was thrown down, and would have been killed if he had not\r\ncalled out--"Save me, save me, I am Henry of Winchester."  His son\r\nheard the call, and, rushing to his side, carried him to a place of\r\nsafety.  His army was much the strongest, and Montfort had known from\r\nthe first that there was no hope for him.  "God have mercy on our\r\nsouls, for our bodies are Sir Edward\'s," he had said; and he died\r\nbravely on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nEdward brought his father back to reign in all honor, but he took the\r\nwhole management of the kingdom, and soon set things in order again--\r\ntaking care that Magna Carta should be properly observed.  When\r\neverything was peaceful at home, he set out upon a Crusade with the\r\ngood King of France, and while he was gone his father died, after a\r\nreign of fifty-six years.  There only three English Kings who reigned\r\nmore than fifty years, and these are easy to remember, as each was the\r\nthird of his name--Henry III., Edward III., and George III.  In the\r\nreign of Henry III. the custom of having Parliaments was established,\r\nand the king was prevented from getting money from the people unless\r\nthe Parliament granted it.  The Parliament has, ever since, been made\r\nup of great lords, who are born to it: and, besides them, of men\r\nchosen by the people in the counties and towns, to speak and decide\r\nfor them.  The clergy have a meeting of their own called Convocation;\r\nand these three--Clergy, Lords, and Commons--are called the Three\r\nEstates of the Realm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nEDWARD I., LONGSHANKS.  A.D. 1272--1307.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe son of Henry III. returned from the Holy Land to be one of our\r\nnoblest, best, and wisest kings.  Edward I.--called Longshanks in a\r\nkind of joke, because he was the tallest man in the Court--was very\r\ngrand-looking and handsome; and could leap, run, ride, and fight in\r\nhis heavy armor better than anyone else.  He was brave, just, and\r\naffectionate; and his sweet wife, Eleanor of Castille, was warmly\r\nloved by him and all the nation.  He built as many churches and was\r\nas charitable as his father, but he was much more careful to make only\r\ngood men bishops, and he allowed no wasting or idling.  He faithfully\r\nobeyed Magna Carta, and made everyone else obey the law--indeed many\r\ngood laws and customs have begun from this time.  Order was the great\r\nthing he cared for, and under him the English grew prosperous and\r\nhappy, when nobody was allowed to rob them.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh were, however, terrible robbers.  You remember that they are\r\nthe remains of the old Britons, who used to have all Britain.  They\r\nhad never left off thinking that they had a right to it, and coming\r\ndown out of their mountains to burn the houses and steal the cattle\r\nof the Saxons, as they still called the English.  Edward tried to make\r\nfriends with their princes--Llewellyn and David--and to make them keep\r\ntheir people in order.  He gave David lands in England, and let\r\nLlewellyn marry his cousin, Eleanor de Montfort.  But they broke their\r\npromises shamefully, and did such savage things to the English on their\r\nborders that he was forced to put a stop to it, and went to war.  David\r\nwas made prisoner, and put to death as a traitor; and Llewellyn was\r\nmet by some soldiers near the bridge of Builth and killed, without\r\ntheir knowing who he was.  Edward had, in the meantime, conquered most\r\nof the country; and he told the Welsh chiefs that, if they would come\r\nand meet him at Caernarvon Castle, he would give them a prince who had\r\nbeen born in their country--had never spoken a word of any language\r\nbut theirs.  They all came, and the king came down to them with his\r\nown little baby son in his arms, who had lately been born in\r\nCaernarvon Castle, and, of course, had never spoken any language at\r\nall.  The Welsh were obliged to accept him; and he had a Welsh nurse,\r\nthat the first words he spoke might be Welsh.  They thought he would\r\nhave been altogether theirs, as he then had an elder brother; but in\r\na year or two the oldest boy died; and, ever since that time, the\r\neldest son of the King of England has always been Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nThere was a plan for the little Prince Edward of Caernarvon being\r\nmarried to a little girl, who was grand-daughter to the King of\r\nScotland, and would be Queen of Scotland herself--and this would have\r\nled to the whole island being under one king--but, unfortunately, the\r\nlittle maiden died.  It was so hard to decide who ought to reign, out\r\nof all her cousins, that they asked king Edward to choose among them--\r\nsince everyone knew that a great piece of Scotland belonged to him as\r\nover-lord, just as his own dukedom of Aquitaine belonged to the King\r\nof France over him; and the Kings of Scotland always used to pay\r\nhomage to those of England for it.\r\n\r\nEdward chose John Balliol, the one who had the best right; but he made\r\nhim understand that, as overlord, he meant to see that as good order\r\nwas kept in Scotland as in England.  Now, the English kings had never\r\nmeddled with Scottish affairs before, and the Scots were furious at\r\nfinding that he did so.  They said it was insulting them and their\r\nking; and poor Balliol did not know what to do among them, but let\r\nthem defy Edward in his name.  This brought Edward and his army to\r\nScotland.  The strong places were taken and filled with English\r\nsoldiers, and Balliol was made prisoner, adjudged to have rebelled\r\nagainst his lord and forfeited his kingdom, and was sent away to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nEdward thought it would be much better for the whole country to join\r\nScotland to England, and rule it himself.  And so, no doubt, it would\r\nhave been; but many Scots were not willing,--and in spite of all the\r\ncare he could take, the soldiers who guarded his castles often behaved\r\nshamefully to the people round them.  One gentleman, named William\r\nWallace, whose home had been broken up by some soldiers, fled to the\r\nwoods and hills, and drew so many Scots round him that he had quite\r\nan army.  There was a great fight at the Bridge of Stirling; the\r\nEnglish governors were beaten, and Wallace led his men over the border\r\ninto Northumberland, where they plundered and burnt wherever they went,\r\nin revenge for what had been done in Scotland.\r\n\r\nEdward gathered his forces and came to Scotland.  The army that Wallace\r\nhad drawn together could not stand before him, but was defeated at\r\nFalkirk, and Wallace had to take to the woods.  Edward promised pardon\r\nto all who would submit--and almost all did; but Wallace still lurked\r\nin the hills, till one of his own countrymen betrayed him to the\r\nEnglish, when he was sent to London, and put to death.\r\n\r\nAll seemed quieted, and English garrisons--that is, guarding soldiers\r\n--were in all the Scottish towns and castles, when, suddenly, Robert\r\nBruce, one of the half English, half Scottish nobles between whom\r\nEdward had judged, ran away from the English court, with his horse\'s\r\nshoes put on backwards.  The next thing that was heard of him was,\r\nthat he had quarreled with one of his cousins in the church at\r\nDumfries, and stabbed him to the heart, and then had gone to Scone\r\nand had been crowned King of Scotland.\r\n\r\nEdward was bitterly angry now.  He sent on an army to deal unsparingly\r\nwith the rising, and set out to follow with his son, now grown to man\'s\r\nestate.  Crueller things than he had ever allowed before were done to\r\nthe places where Robert Bruce had been acknowledged as king, and his\r\nfriends were hung as traitors wherever they were found; but Bruce\r\nhimself could not be caught.  He was living a wild life among the\r\nlakes and hills; and Edward, who was an old man now, had been taken\r\nso ill at Carlisle, that he could not come on to keep his own strict\r\nrule among his men.  All the winter he lay sick there; and in the\r\nspring he heard that Bruce, whom he thought quite crushed, had\r\nsuddenly burst upon the English, defeated them, and was gathering\r\nstrength every day.\r\n\r\nEdward put on his armor and set out for Scotland; but at Burgh-on-\r\nthe-Sands his illness came on again, and he died there at seventy\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nHe was buried in Westminster Abbey, under a great block of stone, and\r\nthe inscription on it only says, "Edward I., 1308--The Hammer of the\r\nScots--Keep Treaties."  His good wife, Queen Eleanor, had died many\r\nyears before him, and was also buried at Westminster.  All the way\r\nfrom Grantham, in Lincolnshire--where she died--to London, Edward set\r\nup a beautiful stone cross wherever her body rested for the night--\r\nfifteen of them--but only three are left now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nEDWARD II., OF CAERNARVON.  A.D. 1307--1327.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike his father in everything was the young Edward, who had just\r\ncome to manhood in mind, for he was silly and easily led as his\r\ngrandfather, Henry III., had been.  He had a friend--a gay, handsome,\r\nthoughtless, careless young man--named Piers Gaveston, who had often\r\nled him into mischief.  His father had banished this dangerous\r\ncompanion, and forbidden, under pain of his heaviest displeasure, the\r\ntwo young men from ever meeting again; but the moment the old king was\r\ndead, Edward turned back from Scotland, where he was so much wanted,\r\nand sent for Piers Gaveston again.  At the same time his bride arrived\r\n--Isabel, daughter to the King of France, a beautiful girl--and there\r\nwas a splendid wedding feast; but the king and Gaveston were both so\r\nvain and conceited, that they cared more about their own beauty and\r\nfine dress than the young queen\'s, and she found herself quite\r\nneglected.  The nobles, too, were angered at the airs that Gaveston\r\ngave himself; he not only dressed splendidly, had a huge train of\r\nservants, and managed the king as he pleased, but he was very insolent\r\nto them, and gave them nick-names.  He called the king\'s cousin, the\r\nEarl of Lancaster, "the old hog;" the Earl of Pembroke, "Joseph the\r\nJew;" and the Earl of Warwick, "the black dog."  Meantime, the king\r\nand he were wasting the treasury, and doing harm of all kinds, till\r\nthe barons gathered together and forced the king to send his favorite\r\ninto banishment.  Gaveston went, but he soon came back again and\r\njoined the king, who was at last setting out for Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe nobles, however, would not endure his return.  they seized him,\r\nbrought him to Warwick Castle, and there held a kind of Court, which\r\ncould hardly be called of Justice, for they had no right at all to\r\nsentence him.  He spoke them fair now, and begged hard for his life;\r\nbut they could not forget the names he had called them, and he was\r\nbeheaded on Blacklow Hill.\r\n\r\nEdward was full of grief and anger for the cruel death of his friend;\r\nbut he was forced to keep it out of sight, for all the barons were\r\ncoming round him for the Scottish war.  While he had been wasting\r\nhis time, Robert Bruce had obtained every strong place in Scotland,\r\nexcept Stirling Castle, and there the English governor had promised\r\nto yield, if succor did not come from England within a year and a day.\r\n\r\nThe year was almost over when Edward came into Scotland with a fine\r\narmy of English, Welsh, and Gascons from Aquitaine; but Robert Bruce\r\nwas a great and able general, and he was no general at all; so when\r\nthe armies met at Bannockburn, under the walls of Stirling, the\r\nEnglish were worse beaten than ever they had been anywhere else,\r\nexcept at Hastings.  Edward was obliged to flee away to England, and\r\nthough Bruce was never owned by the English to be King of Scotland,\r\nthere he really reigned, having driven every Englishman away, and\r\ntaken all the towns and castles.  Indeed, the English had grown so\r\nmuch afraid of the Scots, that a hundred would flee at the sight\r\nof two.\r\n\r\nThe king comforted himself with a new friend--Hugh le Despencer--who,\r\nwith his old father, had his own way, just like Gaveston.  Again the\r\nbarons rose, and required that they should be banished.  They went,\r\nbut the Earl of Lancaster carried his turbulence too far, and, when\r\nhe hear that the father had come back, raised an army, and was even\r\nfound to have asked Robert Bruce to help him against his own king.\r\nThis made the other barons so angry that they joined the king against\r\nhim, and he was made prisoner and put to death for making war on the\r\nking, and making friends with the enemies of the country.\r\n\r\nEdward had his Le Despencers back again, and very discontented the\r\nsight made the whole country--and especially the queen, whom he had\r\nalways neglected, though she now had four children.  He had never\r\ntried to gain her love, and she hated him more and more.  There was\r\nsome danger of a quarrel with her brother, the King of France, and\r\nshe offered to go with her son Edward, now about fourteen, and settle\r\nit.  But this was only an excuse.  She went about to the princes\r\nabroad, telling them how ill she was used by her husband, and asking\r\nfor help.  A good many knights believed and pitied her, and came with\r\nher to England to help.  All the English who hated the Le Despencers\r\njoined her, and she led the young prince against his father.  Edward\r\nand his friends were hunted across into Wales; but they were tracked\r\nout one by one, and the Despencers were put to a cruel death, though\r\nEdward gave himself up in hopes of saving them.\r\n\r\nThe queen and her friends made him own that he did not deserve to\r\nreign, and would give up the crown to his son.  Then they kept him\r\nin prison, taking him from one castle to another, in great misery.\r\nThe rude soldiers of his guard mocked him and crowned him with hay,\r\nand gave him dirty ditch water to shave with; and when they found he\r\nwas too strong and healthy to die only of bad food and damp lodging,\r\nthey murdered him one night in Berkeley Castle.  He lies buried in\r\nGloucester Cathedral, not far from that other foolish and unfortunate\r\nprince, Robert of Normandy.  He had reigned twenty years, and was\r\ndethroned in 1327.\r\n\r\nThe queen then wanted to get rid of Edmund, Earl of Kent, the poor\r\nking\'s youngest brother.  So a report was spread that Edward was\r\nalive, and Edmund was allowed to peep into a dark prison room, where\r\nhe saw a man who he thought was his brother.  He tried to stir up\r\nfriends to set the king free; but this was called rebelling, and he\r\nwas taken and beheaded at Winchester by a criminal condemned to die,\r\nfor it was such a wicked sentence that nobody else could be found to\r\ncarry it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nEDWARD III.  A.D. 1327--1377.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor about three years, the cruel Queen Isabel and her friends managed\r\nall the country; but as soon as her son--Edward III., who had been\r\ncrowned instead of his father--understood how wicked she had been, and\r\nwas strong enough to deal with her party, he made them prisoners, put\r\nthe worst of them to death, and kept the queen shut up in a castle\r\nas long as she lived.  He had a very good queen of his own, named\r\nPhillipa, who brought cloth-workers over from he own country Hainault\r\n(now part of Belgium), to teach the English their trade, and thus\r\nbegan to render England the chief country in the world for wool and\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nQueen Isabel, Edward\'s mother, had, you remember, been daughter of\r\nthe King of France.  All her three brothers died without leaving a\r\nson, and their cousin, whose name was Philip, began to reign in their\r\nstead.  Edward, however, fancied that the crown of France properly\r\nbelonged to him, in right of his mother; but he did not stir about it\r\nat once, and, perhaps, never would have done so at all, but for two\r\nthings.  One was, that the King of France, Philip VI., had been so\r\nfoolish as to fancy that one of his lords, named Robert of Artois,\r\nhad been bewitching him--by sticking pins into a wax figure and\r\nroasting it before the fire.  So this Robert was driven out of France\r\nand, coming to England, stirred Edward up to go and overthrow Philip.\r\nThe other was, that the English barons had grown so restless and\r\ntroublesome, that they would not stay peacefully at home and mind\r\ntheir own estate;--but if they had not wars abroad, they always gave\r\nthe king trouble at home; and Edward liked better that they should\r\nfight for him than against him.  So he called himself King of France\r\nand England, and began a war which lasted--with short space of quiet--\r\nfor full one hundred years, and only ended in the time of the great\r\ngrandchildren of the men who entered upon it.  There was one great\r\nsea-fight off Sluys, when the king sat in his ship, in a black velvet\r\ndress, and gained a great victory; but it was a good while before\r\nthere was any great battle by land--so long, that the king\'s eldest\r\nson, Edward Prince of Wales, was sixteen years old.  He is generally\r\ncalled the Black Prince--no one quite knows why, for his hair, like\r\nthat of all these old English kings, was quite light and his eyes were\r\nblue.  He was such a spirited young soldier, that when the French army\r\nunder King Philip came in sight of the English one, near the village\r\nof Crecy, King Edward said he should have the honor of the day, and\r\nstood under a windmill on a his watching the fight, while the prince\r\nled the English army.  He gained a very great victory, and in the\r\nevening came and knelt before his father, saying the praise was not\r\nhis own but the king\'s, who had ordered all so wisely.  Afterwards,\r\nwhile Philip had fled away, Edward besieged Calais, the town just\r\nopposite to Dover.  The inhabitants were very brave, and held out for\r\na long time; and while Edward was absent, the Scots under David, the\r\nson of Robert Bruce, came over the Border, and began to burn and\r\nplunder in Northumberland.  However, Phillipa could be brave in time\r\nof need.  She did not send for her husband, but called an army\r\ntogether, and the Scots were so well beaten at Neville\'s Cross, that\r\ntheir king, David himself, was obliged to give himself up to an\r\nEnglish squire.  The man would not let the queen have his prisoner,\r\nbut rode day and night to Dover, and then crossed to Calais to tell\r\nthe king, who bade him put King David into Queen Philippa\'s keeping.\r\nShe came herself to the camp, just as the brave men of Calais had\r\nbeen starved out; and Edward had said he would only consent not to\r\nburn the town down, if six of the chief townsmen would bring him the\r\nkeys of the gates, kneeling, with sackcloth on, and halters round\r\ntheir necks, ready to be hung.  Queen Philippa wept when she saw them,\r\nand begged that they might be spared; and when the king granted them\r\nto her she had them led away, and gave each a good dinner and a fresh\r\nsuit of clothes.  The king, however, turned all the French people out\r\nof Calais, and filled it with English, and it remained quite an\r\nEnglish town for more than 200 years.\r\n\r\nKing Philip VI. of France died, and his son John became king, while\r\nstill the war went on.  The Black Prince and John had a terrible\r\nbattle at a place called Poitiers, and the English gained another\r\nvictory.  King John and one of his sons were made prisoners, but when\r\nthey were brought to the tent where the Black Prince was to sup, he\r\nmade them sit down at the table before him, and waited on them as if\r\nthey had been his guests instead of his prisoners.  He did all he\r\ncould to prevent captivity being a pain to them; and when he brought\r\nthem to London, he gave John a tall white horse to ride, and only\r\nrode a small pony himself by his side.  There were two kings prisoners\r\nin the Tower of London, and they were treated as if they were visitors\r\nand friends.  John was allowed to go home, provided he would pay a\r\nransom by degrees, as he could get the money together; and, in the\r\nmeantime, his two elder sons were to be kept at Calais in his stead.\r\nBut they would not stay at Calais, and King John could not obtain the\r\nsum for his ransom; so, rather than cheat King Edward, he went back to\r\nhis prison in England again.  He died soon after; and his son Charles\r\nwas a cleverer and wiser man, who knew it was better not to fight\r\nbattles with the English, but made a truce, or short peace.\r\n\r\nPrince Edward governed that part of the south of France that belonged\r\nto his father; but he went on a foolish expedition into Spain, to help\r\na very bad king whom his subjects had driven out, and there caught an\r\nillness from which he never quite recovered.  While he was ill King\r\nCharles began the war again; and, though there was no battle, he\r\ntormented the English, and took the castles and towns they held.  The\r\nBlack Prince tried to fight, but he was too weak and ill to do much,\r\nand was obliged to go home, and leave the government to his brother\r\nJohn, Duke of Lancaster.  He lived about six years after he came home,\r\nand then died, to the great sorrow of everyone.  His father, King\r\nEdward, was now too old and feeble to attend to the affairs of the\r\ncountry.  Queen Philippa was dead too, and as no one took proper care\r\nof the poor old king, he fell into the hands of bad servants, who made\r\nthemselves rich and neglected him.  When, at length, he lay dying,\r\nthey stole the ring off his finger before he had breathed his last,\r\nand left him all alone, with the doors open, till a priest came by,\r\nand stayed and prayed by him till his last moment.  He had reigned\r\nexactly fifty years.  You had better learn and remember the names of\r\nhis sons, as you will hear more about some of them.  They were Edward,\r\nLionel, John, Edmund, and Thomas.  Edward was Prince of Wales; Lionel,\r\nDuke of Clarence; John, Duke of Lancaster; Edmund, Duke of York; and\r\nThomas, Duke of Gloucester.  Edward and Lionel both died before\r\ntheir father.  Edward had left a son named Richard; Lionel had left\r\na daughter named Philippa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nRICHARD II.  A.D. 1377--1399.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were not very good times in England.  The new King, Richard, was\r\nonly eleven years old, and his three uncles did not care much for his\r\ngood or the good of the nation.  There was not much fighting going on\r\nin France, but for the little there was a great deal of money was\r\nwanting, and the great lords were apt to be very hard upon the poor\r\npeople on their estates.  They would not let them be taught to read;\r\nand if a poor man who belonged to an estate went away to a town, his\r\nlord could have him brought back to his old home.  Any tax, too, fell\r\nmore heavily on the poor than the rich.  One tax, especially, called\r\nthe poll tax, which was made when Richard was sixteen, vexed them\r\ngreatly.  Everyone above fifteen years old had to pay fourpence, and\r\nthe collectors were often very rude and insolent.  A man named Wat\r\nTyler, in Kent, was so angry with a rude collector as to strike him\r\ndead.  All the villagers came together with sticks, scythes, and\r\nflails; and Wat Tyler told them they would go to London, and tell the\r\nking how his poor commons were treated.  More people and more joined\r\nthem on the way, and an immense multitude of wild looking men came\r\npouring into London, where the Lord Mayor and Aldermen were taken by\r\nsurprise, and could do nothing to stop them.  They did not do much\r\nharm then; they lay on the grass all night round the Tower, and said\r\nthey wanted to speak to the king.  In the morning he came down to his\r\nbarge, and meant to have spoken to them; but his people, seeing such\r\na host of wild men, took fright, and carried him back again.  He went\r\nout again the next day on horseback; but while he was speaking to some\r\nof them, the worst of them broke into the Tower, where they seized\r\nArchbishop Simon of Canterbury, and fancying he was one of the king\'s\r\nbad advisers, they cut off his head.  Richard had to sleep in the\r\nhouse called the Royal Wardrobe that night, but he went out again on\r\nhorseback among the mob, and began trying to understand what they\r\nwanted.  Wat Tyler, while talking, grew violent, forgot to whom he\r\nwas speaking, and laid his hand on the king\'s bridle, as if to\r\nthreaten or take him prisoner.  Upon this, the Lord Mayor, with his\r\nmace--the large crowned staff that is carried before him--dealt the\r\nman such a blow that fell from his horse, and an attendant thrust him\r\nthrough with a sword.  The people wavered, and seemed not to know\r\nwhat to do: and the young king, with great readiness, rode forward\r\nand said--"Good fellows, have you lost your leader?  This fellow was\r\nbut a traitor, I am your king, and will be your captain and guide."\r\nThen he rode at their head out into the fields, and the gentlemen,\r\nwho had mustered their men by this time, were able to get between\r\nthem and the city.  The people of each county were desired to state\r\ntheir grievances; the king engaged to do what he could for them, and\r\nthey went home.\r\n\r\nRichard seems to have really wished to take away some of the laws that\r\nwere so hard upon them, but his lords would not let him, and he had as\r\nyet very little power--being only a boy--and by the time he grew up\r\nhis head was full of vanity and folly.  He was very handsome, and he\r\ncared more for fine clothes and amusements than for business; and his\r\nyoungest uncle, the Duke of Gloucester, did all he could to keep him\r\nback, and hinder him from taking his affairs into his own hands.  Not\r\ntill he was twenty-four did Richard begin to govern for himself; and\r\nthen the Duke of Gloucester was always grumbling and setting the\r\npeople to grumble, because the king chose to have peace with France.\r\nDuke Thomas used to lament over the glories of the battles of Edward\r\nIII., and tell the people they had taxes to pay to keep the king in\r\nermine robes, and rings, and jewels, and to let him give feasts and\r\ntilting matches--when the knights, in beautiful, gorgeous armor, rode\r\nagainst one another in sham fight, and the king and ladies looked on\r\nand gave the prize.\r\n\r\nNow, Richard knew very well that all this did not cost half so much as\r\nhis grandfather\'s wars, and he said it did not signify to the people\r\nwhat he wore, or how he amused himself, as long as he did not tax them\r\nand take their lambs and sheaves to pay for it.  But the people would\r\nnot believe him, and Gloucester was always stirring them up against\r\nhim, and interfering with him in council.  At last, Richard went as\r\nif on a visit to his uncle at Pleshy Castle; and there, in his own\r\npresence, caused him to be seized and sent off to Calais.  In a few\r\ndays\' time Thomas, Duke of Gloucester, was dead; and to this day\r\nnobody knows whether his grief and rage brought on a fit, or if he\r\nwas put to death.  It is certain, at least, that Richard\'s other two\r\nuncles do not seem to have treated the king as if he had been to\r\nblame.  The elder of these uncles, the Duke of Lancaster, was called\r\nJohn of Gaunt--because he had been born a Ghent, a town in Flanders.\r\nHe was becoming an old man, and only tried to help the king and keep\r\nthings quiet; but Henry, his eldest son, was a fine high-spirited\r\nyoung man--a favorite with everybody, and was always putting himself\r\nforward--and the king was very much afraid of him.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Parliament met, the king stood up, and commanded Henry\r\nof Lancaster to tell all those present what the Duke of Norfolk had\r\nsaid when they were riding together.  Henry gave in a written paper,\r\nsaying that the duke had told him that they should all be ruined, like\r\nthe Duke of Gloucester, and that the king would find some way to\r\ndestroy them.  Norfolk angrily sprang up, and declared he had said no\r\nsuch thing.  In those days, when no one could tell which spoke the\r\ntruth, the two parties often would offer to fight, and it was believed\r\nthat God would show the right, by giving the victory to the sincere\r\none.  So Henry and Norfolk were to fight; but just as they were\r\nmounted on their horses, with their lances in their hands, the king\r\nthrew down his staff before them, stopped the combat, and sentenced\r\nNorfolk to be banished from England for life, and Henry for ten years.\r\n\r\nNot long after Henry had gone, his old father--John of Gaunt--died,\r\nand the king kept all his great dukedom of Lancaster.  Henry would\r\nnot bear this, and knew that many people at home thought it very\r\nunfair; so he came to England, and as soon as he landed at Ravenspur\r\nin Yorkshire, people flocked to him so eagerly, that he began to think\r\nhe could do more than make himself duke of Lancaster.  King Richard\r\nwas in Ireland, where his cousin, the governor--Roger Mortimer--had\r\nbeen killed by the wild Irish.  He came home in haste on hearing of\r\nHenry\'s arrival, but everybody turned against him: and the Earl of\r\nNorthumberland, whom he had chiefly trusted, made him prisoner and\r\ncarried him to Henry.  He was taken to London, and there set before\r\nParliament, to confess that he had ruled so ill that he was unworthy\r\nto reign, and gave up the crown to his dear cousin Henry of Lancaster,\r\nin the year 1399.\r\n\r\nThen he was sent away to Pontefract Castle, and what happened to him\r\nthere nobody knows, but he never came out of it alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nHENRY IV.  A.D. 1399--1413.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English people had often chosen their king out of the royal family\r\nin old times, but from John to Richard II., he had always been the son\r\nand heir of the last king.  Now, though poor Richard had no child,\r\nHenry of Lancaster was not the next of kin to him, for Lionel, Duke of\r\nClarence, had come between the Black Prince and John of Gaunt; and his\r\ngreat grandson, Edmund Mortimer, was thought by many to have a better\r\nright to be king than Henry.  Besides, people did not know whether\r\nRichard was alive, and they thought him hardly used, and wanted to\r\nset him free.  So Henry had a very uneasy time.  Everyone had been\r\nfond of him when he was a bright, friendly, free-spoken noble, and\r\nhe thought that he would be a good king and much loved; but he had\r\ngained the crown in an evil way, and it never gave him any peace or\r\njoy.  The Welsh, who always had loved Richard, took up arms for him,\r\nand the Earl of Northumberland, who had betrayed Richard, expected\r\na great deal too much from Henry.  The earl had a brave son--Henry\r\nPercy--who was so fiery and eager that he was commonly called Hotspur.\r\nHe was sent to fight with the Welsh: and with the king\'s son, Henry,\r\nPrince of Wales--a brave boy of fifteen or sixteen--under his charge,\r\nto teach him the art of war; and they used to climb the mountains and\r\nsleep in tents together as good friends.\r\n\r\nBut the Scots made an attack on England.  Henry Percy went north\r\nto fight with them, and beat them in a great battle, making many\r\nprisoners.  The King sent to ask to have the prisoners sent to London,\r\nand this made the proud Percy so angry that he gave up the cause of\r\nKing Henry, and went off to Wales, taking his prisoners with him; and\r\nthere--being by this time nearly sure that poor Richard must be dead\r\n--he joined the Welsh in choosing, as the only right king of England,\r\nyoung Edmund Mortimer.  Henry IV. and his sons gathered an army easily\r\n--for the Welsh were so savage and cruel, that the English were sure to\r\nfight against them if they broke into England.  The battle was fought\r\nnear Shrewsbury.  It was a very fierce one, and in it Hotspur was\r\nkilled, the Welsh put to flight, and the Prince of Wales fought so\r\nwell that everyone saw he was likely to be a brave, warlike king,\r\nlike Edward I. or Edward III.\r\n\r\nThe troubles were not over, however, for the Earl of Northumberland\r\nhimself, and Archbishop Scrope of York, took up arms against the\r\nking; but they were put down without a battle.  The Earl fled and\r\nhid himself, but the archbishop was taken and beheaded--the first\r\nbishop whom a king of England had ever put to death.  The Welsh went\r\non plundering and doing harm, and Prince Henry had to be constantly\r\non the watch against them; and, in fact, there never was a reign so\r\nfull of plots and conspiracies.  The king never knew whom to trust:\r\none friend after another turned against him, and he became soured\r\nand wretched: he was worn out with disappointment and guarding against\r\neveryone, and at last he grew even suspicious of his brave son Henry,\r\nbecause he was so bright and bold, and was so much loved.  The prince\r\nwas ordered home from Wales, and obliged to live at Windsor, with\r\nnothing to do, while his youngest brothers were put before him and\r\ntrusted by their father--one of them even sent to command the army\r\nin France.  But happily the four brothers--Henry, Thomas, John and\r\nHumfrey--all loved each other so well that nothing could make them\r\njealous or at enmity with one another.  At Windsor, too, the king\r\nkept young Edmund Mortimer--whom the Welsh had tried to make king,--\r\nand also the young English princes, and they all led a happy life\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThere are stories told of Henry--Prince Hal, as he was called--leading\r\na wild, merry life, as a sort of madcap; playing at being a robber,\r\nand breaking into the wagons that were bringing treasure for his\r\nfather, and then giving the money back again.  Also there is a story\r\nthat, when one of his friends was taken before the Lord Chief Justice,\r\nhe went and ordered him to be released and that when the justice\r\nrefused he drew his sword, upon which the justice sent him to prison;\r\nand he went quietly, knowing it was right.  The king is said to have\r\ndeclared himself happy to have a judge who maintained the law so well,\r\nand a son who would submit to it; but there does not seem to be good\r\nreason for believing the story; and it seems clear that young Henry,\r\nif he was full of fun and frolic, took care never to do anything\r\nreally wrong.\r\n\r\nThe king was an old man before his time.  He was always ill, and often\r\nhad fits, and one of these came on when he was in Westminster Abbey.\r\nHe was taken to the room called the Jerusalem chamber, and Henry watched\r\nhim there.  Another of the stories is that the king lay as if he were\r\ndead, and the prince took the crown that was by his side and carried\r\nit away.  When the king revived, Henry brought it back, with many\r\nexcuses.  "Ah, fair son," said the king, "what right have you to the\r\ncrown? you know your father had none."\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Henry, "with your sword you took it, and with my sword I\r\nwill keep it."\r\n\r\n"May God have mercy on my soul," said the king.\r\n\r\nAnother story tells show the prince, feeling that his father doubted\r\nhis loyalty, presented himself one day in disordered attire before\r\nthe king, and kneeling, offered him a dagger, and begged his father\r\nto take his life, if he could no longer trust and love him.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be quite certain about the truth of these conversations,\r\nfor many people will write down stories they have heard, without\r\nmaking sure of them.  One thing we are certain of which Henry told\r\nhis son, which seems less like repentance.  It was that, unless he\r\nmade war in France, his lords would never let him be quiet on his\r\nthrone in England; and this young Henry was quite ready to believe.\r\nThere had never been a real peace between France and England since\r\nEdward III. had begun the war--only truces, which are short rests\r\nin the middle of a great war--and the English were eager to begin\r\nagain; for people seldom thought then of the misery that comes of\r\na great war, but only of the honor and glory that were to be gained,\r\nof making prisoners and getting ransoms from them.\r\n\r\nSo Henry IV. died, after having made his own life miserable by taking\r\nthe crown unjustly, and, as you will see, leaving a great deal or harm\r\nstill to come to the whole country, as well as to France.\r\n\r\nHe died in the year 1399.  His family is called the House of Lancaster,\r\nbecause his father had been Duke of Lancaster.  You will be amused\r\nto hear that Richard Whittington really lived in his time.  I cannot\r\nanswer for his cat, but he was really Lord Mayor of London, and\r\nsupplied the wardrobe of King Henry\'s daughter, when she married the\r\nKing of Denmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nHENRY V., OF MONMOUTH.  A.D. 1413--1423.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young King Henry was full of high, good thoughts.  He was devout\r\nin going to church, tried to make good Bishops, gave freely to the\r\npoor, and was so kindly, and hearty, and merry in all his words and\r\nways, that everyone loved him.  Still, he thought it was his duty to\r\ngo and make war in France.  He had been taught to believe the kingdom\r\nbelonged to him, and it was in so wretched a state that he thought he\r\ncould do it good.  The poor king, Charles VI., was mad, and had a\r\nwicked wife besides; and his sons, and uncles, and cousins were always\r\nfighting, till the streets of Paris were often red with blood, and the\r\nwhole country was miserable.  Henry hoped to set all in order for them,\r\nand gathering an army together, crossed to Normandy.  He called on the\r\npeople to own him as their true king, and never let any harm be done\r\nto them, for he hung any soldier who was caught stealing, or misusing\r\nanyone.  He took the town of Harfleur, on the coast of Normandy, but\r\nnot till after a long siege, when his camp was in so wet a place that\r\nthere was much illness among his men.  The store of food was nearly\r\nused up, and he was obliged to march his troops across to Calais,\r\nwhich you know belonged to England, to get some more.  But on the way\r\nthe French army came up to meet him--a very grand, splendid-looking\r\narmy, commanded by the king\'s eldest son the dauphin.  Just as the\r\nEnglish kings\' eldest son was always Prince of Wales, the French\r\nkings\' eldest son was always called Dauphin of Vienne, because Vienne,\r\nthe country that belonged to him, had a dolphin on its shield.  The\r\nFrench army was very large--quite twice the number of the English--\r\nbut, though Henry\'s men were weary and half-starved, and many\r\nof them sick, they were not afraid, but believed their king when he\r\ntold them that there were enough Frenchmen to kill, enough to run\r\naway, enough to make prisoners.  At night, however, the English had\r\nsolemn prayers, and made themselves ready, and the king walked from\r\ntent to tent to see that each man was in his place; while, on the\r\nother hand, the French were feasting and revelling, and settling\r\nwhat they would do the English when they had made them prisoners.\r\nThey were close to a little village which the English called Agincourt,\r\nand, though that is not quite its right name, it is what we have\r\ncalled the battle ever since.  The French, owing to the quarrelsome\r\nstate of the country, had no order or obedience among them.  Nobody\r\nwould obey any other; and when their own archers were in the way, the\r\nhorsemen began cutting them down as if they were the enemy.  Some\r\nfought bravely, but it was of little use; and by night all the French\r\nwere routed, and King Henry\'s banner waving in victory over the field.\r\nHe went back to England in great glory, and all the aldermen of London\r\ncame out to meet him in red gowns and gold chains, and among them was\r\nSir Richard Whittington, the great silk mercer.\r\n\r\nHenry was so modest that he would not allow the helmet he had worn at\r\nAgincourt, all knocked about with terrible blows, to be carried before\r\nhim when he rode into London, and he went straight to church, to give\r\nthanks to God for his victory.  He soon went back to France, and went\r\non conquering it till the queen came to an agreement with him that he\r\nshould marry his daughter Catherine, and that, though poor, crazy\r\nCharles VI. should reign to the end of his life, when he died Henry\r\nand Catherine should be king and queen of France.  So Henry and\r\nCatherine were married, and he took her home to England with great\r\njoy and pomp, leaving his brother Thomas, Duke of Clarence to take\r\ncare of his army in France.  For, of course, though the queen had made\r\nthis treaty for her mad husband, most brave, honest Frenchmen could\r\nnot but feel it a wicked and unfair thing to give the kingdom away\r\nfrom her son, the Dauphin Charles.  He was not a good man, and had\r\nconsented to the murder of his cousin, the Duke of Burgundy, and this\r\nhad turned some against him; but still he was badly treated, and the\r\nbravest Frenchmen could not bear to see their country given up to the\r\nEnglish.  So, though he took no trouble to fight for himself, they\r\nfought for him, and got some Scots to help them; and by and by news\r\ncame to Henry that his army had been beaten, and his brother killed.\r\n\r\nHe came back again in haste to France, and his presence made everything\r\ngo well again; but all the winter he was besieging the town of Meaux,\r\nwhere there was a very cruel robber, who made all the roads to Paris\r\nunsafe, and by the time he had taken it his health was much injured.\r\nHis queen came to him, and they kept a very grand court at Paris, at\r\nWhitsuntide; but soon after, when Henry set out to join his army, he\r\nfound himself so ill and weak that he was obliged to turn back to the\r\nCastle of Vincennes, where he grew much worse.  He called for all his\r\nfriends, and begged them to be faithful to his little baby son, whom\r\nhe had never even seen; and he spoke especially to his brother John,\r\nDuke of Bedford, to whom he left the charge of all he had gained.  He\r\nhad tried to be a good man, and though his attack on France was really\r\nwrong, and caused great misery, he had meant to do right.  So he was\r\nnot afraid to face death, and he died when only thirty-four years old,\r\nwhile he was listening to the 51st Psalm.  Everybody grieved for him--\r\neven the French--and nobody had ever been so good and dutiful to poor\r\nold King Charles, who sat in a corner lamenting for his good son Henry,\r\nand wasting away till he died, only three weeks later, so that he was\r\nburied the same day, at St. Denys Abbey, near Paris, as Henry was\r\nburied at Westminster Abbey, near London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nHENRY VI., OF WINDSOR.  A.D. 1423--1461.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poor little baby, Henry VI., was but nine months old when--over the\r\ngrave of his father in England, and his grandfather in France--he was\r\nproclaimed King of France and England.  The crown of England was held\r\nover his head, and his lords made their oaths to him: and when he was\r\nnine years old he was sent to Paris, and there crowned King of France.\r\nHe was a very good, little, gentle boy, as meek and obedient as\r\npossible; but his friends, who knew that a king must be brave, strong,\r\nand firm for his people\'s sake, began to be afraid that nothing would\r\never make him manly.  The war in France went on all the time: the Duke\r\nof Bedford keeping the north and the old lands in the south-west for\r\nlittle Henry, and the French doing their best for their rightful king\r\n--though he was so lazy and fond of pleasure that he let them do it\r\nall alone.\r\n\r\nYet a wonderful thing happened in his favor.  The English were\r\nbesieging Orleans, when a young village girl, named Joan of Arc, came\r\nto King Charles and told him that she had had a commission from Heaven\r\nto save Orleans, and to lead him to Rheims, where French kings were\r\nalways crowned.  And she did!  She always acted as one led by Heaven.\r\nMany wonderful things are told of her, and one circumstance that\r\nproduced a great impression on the public mind was that when brought\r\ninto the presence of Charles, whom she had never before seen, she\r\nrecognized him, although he was dressed plainly, and one of the\r\ncourtiers had on the royal apparel.  She never let anything wrong be\r\ndone in her sight--no bad words spoken, no savage deeds done; and she\r\nnever fought herself, only led the French soldiers.  The English\r\nthought her a witch, and fled like sheep whenever they saw her; and\r\nthe French common men were always brave with her to lead them.  And\r\nso she really saved Orleans, and brought the king to be crowned at\r\nRheims.  But neither Charles nor his selfish bad nobles liked her.\r\nShe was too good for them; so, though they would not let her go home\r\nto her village as she wished, they gave her no proper help; and once,\r\nwhen there was a fight going on outside the walls of a town, the\r\nFrench all ran away and left her outside, where she was taken by the\r\nEnglish.  And then, I grieve to say, the court that sat to judge her--\r\nsome English and some French of the English party--sentenced her to\r\nbe burnt to death in the market place at Rouen as a witch, and her\r\nown king never tried to save her.\r\n\r\nBut the spirit she had stirred up never died away.  The French went on\r\nwinning back more and more; and there were so many quarrels among the\r\nEnglish that they had little chance of keeping anything.  The king\'s\r\nyoungest uncle, Humfrey, Duke of Gloucester, was always disputing with\r\nthe Beaufort family.  John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster--father to Henry\r\nIV.--had, late in life, married a person of low birth, and her children\r\nwere called Beaufort, after the castle where they were born--not\r\nPlantagenet--and were hardly reckoned as princes by other people; but\r\nthey were very proud, and thought themselves equal to anybody.  The\r\ngood Duke of Bedford died quite worn out with trying to keep the peace\r\namong them, and to get proper help from England to save the lands his\r\nbrother had won in France.  All this time, the king liked the Beauforts\r\nmuch better than Duke Humfrey, and he followed their advice, and that\r\nof their friend, the Earl of Suffolk, in marrying Margaret of Anjou--\r\nthe daughter of a French prince, who had a right to a great part of\r\nthe lands the English held.  All these were given back to her father,\r\nand this made the Duke of Gloucester and all the English more angry,\r\nand they hated the young queen as the cause.  She was as bold and\r\nhigh-spirited as the king was gentle and meek.  He loved nothing so\r\nwell as praying, praising God, and reading; and he did one great thing\r\nfor the country--which did more for it than all the fighting kings had\r\ndone--he founded Eton College, close to Windsor Castle; and there many\r\nof our best clergymen, and soldiers, and statesmen, have had their\r\neducation.  But while he was happy over rules for his scholars, and\r\nin plans for the beautiful chapel, the queen was eagerly taking part\r\nin the quarrels, and the nation hated her the more for interfering.\r\nAnd very strangely, Humfrey, Duke of Gloucester, was, at the meeting\r\nof Parliament, accused of high treason and sent to prison, where, in\r\na few days, he was found dead in his bed--just like his great-uncle,\r\nThomas, Duke of Gloucester; nor does anyone understand the mystery\r\nin one case, better than in the other, except that we are more sure\r\nthat gentle Henry VI. had nothing to do with it than we can be of\r\nRichard II.\r\n\r\nThese were very bad times.  There was a rising like Wat Tyler\'s, under\r\na man named Jack Cade, who held London for two or three days before he\r\nwas put down; and, almost at the same time, the queen\'s first English\r\nfriend, Suffolk, was exiled by her enemies, and taken at sea and\r\nmurdered by some sailors.  Moreover, the last of the brave old friends\r\nof Henry V. was killed in France, while trying to save the remains of\r\nthe old duchy of Aquitaine, which had belonged to the English kings\r\never since Henry II. married Queen Eleanor.  That was the end of the\r\nhundred years\' war, for peace was made at last, and England kept\r\nnothing in France but the one city of Calais.\r\n\r\nStill things were growing worse.  Duke Humfrey left no children, and\r\nas time went on and the king had none, the question was who should\r\nreign.  If the Beauforts were to be counted as princes, they came\r\nnext; but everyone hated them, so that people recollected that Henry\r\nIV. had thrust aside the young Edmund Mortimer, grandson to Lionel,\r\nwho had been next eldest to the Black Prince.  Edmund was dead, but\r\nhis sister Anne had married a son of the Duke of York, youngest son\r\nof Edward III.; and her son Richard, Duke of York, could not help\r\nfeeling that he had a much better right to be king than any Beaufort.\r\nThere was a great English noble named Richard Nevil, Earl of Warwick,\r\nwho liked to manage everything--just the sort of baron that was always\r\nmischievous at home, if not fighting in France--and he took up York\'s\r\ncause hotly.  York\'s friends used to wear white roses, Beaufort\'s\r\nfriends red roses, and the two parties kept on getting more bitter;\r\nbut as no one wished any ill to gentle King Henry--who, to make\r\nmatters worse, sometimes had fits of madness, like his poor\r\ngrandfather in France--they would hardly have fought it in his\r\nlifetime, if he had not at last had a little son, who was born while\r\nhe was so mad that he did not know of it.  Then, when York found it\r\nwas of no use to wait, he began to make war, backed up by Warwick,\r\nand, after much fighting, they made the king prisoner, and forced him\r\nto make an agreement that he should reign as long as he lived, but\r\nthat after that Richard of York should be king, and his son Edward\r\nbe only Duke of Lancaster.  This made the queen furiously angry.\r\nShe would not give up her son\'s rights, and she gathered a great army,\r\nwith which she came suddenly on the Duke of York near Wakefield, and\r\ndestroyed nearly his whole army.  He was killed in the battle; and\r\nhis second son, Edmund, was met on Wakefield bridge and stabbed by\r\nLord Clifford; and Margaret had their heads set up over the gates of\r\nYork, while she went on to London to free her husband.\r\n\r\nBut Edward, York\'s eldest son, was a better captain than he, and far\r\nfiercer and more cruel.  He made the war much more savage than it had\r\nbeen before; and after beating the queen\'s friends at Mortimer\'s Cross,\r\nhe hurried on to London, where the people--who had always been very\r\nfond of his father, and hated Queen Margaret--greeted him gladly.  He\r\nwas handsome and stately looking; and though he was really cruel when\r\noffended, had easy, good-natured manners, and everyone in London was\r\ndelighted to receive him and own him as king.  But Henry and Margaret\r\nwere in the north with many friends, and he followed them thither to\r\nTowton Moor, where, in a snow storm, began the most cruel and savage\r\nbattle of all the war.  Edward gained the victory, and nobody was\r\nspared, or made prisoner--all were killed who could not flee.  Poor\r\nHenry was hidden among his friends, and Margaret went to seek help\r\nin Scotland and abroad, taking her son with her.  Once she brought\r\nanother army and fought at Hexham, but she was beaten again; and\r\nbefore long King Henry was discovered by his enemies, carried to\r\nLondon, and shut up a prisoner in the Tower.  His reign is reckoned\r\nto have ended in 1461.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nEDWARD IV.  A.D. 1461--1483.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Edward IV. was made king, the wars of the Red and White Roses\r\nwere not over yet.  Queen Margaret and her friends were always trying\r\nto get help for poor King Henry.  Edward had been so base and mean as\r\nto have him led into London, with his feet tied together under his\r\nhorse, while men struck him on the face, and cried out, "Behold the\r\ntraitor!"  But Henry was meek, patient, and gentle throughout; and,\r\nwhen shut up in the Tower, spent his time in reading and praying, or\r\nplaying with his little dog.\r\n\r\nQueen Margaret and her son Edward were living with her father in\r\nFrance, and she was always trying to have her husband set free, and\r\nbrought back to his throne.  In the meantime, all England was\r\nexceeedingly surprised to find that Edward IV. had been secretly\r\nmarried to a beautiful lady named Elizabeth Woodville--Lady Grey.\r\nHer first husband had been killed fighting for Henry, and she had\r\nstood under an oak tree, when King Edward was passing, to entreat\r\nthat his lands might not be taken from her little boys.  The king\r\nfell in love with her and married her, but for a long time he was\r\nafraid to tell the Earl of Warwick; and when he did, Warwick was\r\ngreatly offended--and all the more because Elizabeth\'s relations were\r\nproud and gay in their dress, and tried to set themselves above all\r\nthe old nobles.  Warwick himself had no son, but he had two daughters,\r\nwhom he meant to marry to the king\'s two brothers--George, Duke of\r\nClarence, and Richard, Duke of Gloucester.  Edward thought this would\r\nmake Warwick too powerful, and though he could not prevent George\r\nfrom marrying Isabel Nevil, the eldest daughter, the discontent grew\r\nso strong that Warwick persuaded George to fly with him, turn against\r\nhis own brother, and offer Queen Margaret their help!  No wonder\r\nMargaret did not trust them, and was very hard to persuade that\r\nWarwick could mean well by her; but at last she consented, and gave\r\nher son Edward--a fine lad of sixteen--to marry his daughter, Anne\r\nNevil; after which, Warwick--whom men began to call the king-maker--\r\nwent back to England with Clarence, to raise their men, while she was\r\nto follow with her son and his young wife.  Warwick came so suddenly\r\nthat he took the Yorkists at unawares.  Edward had to flee for his\r\nlife to Flanders, leaving his wife and his babies to take shelter in\r\nWestminster Abbey--since no one durst take any one out of that holy\r\nplace--and poor Henry was taken out of prison and set on the throne\r\nagain.  However, Edward soon got help in Flanders, where his sister\r\nwas married to the Duke of Burgundy.  He came back again, gathered\r\nhis friends, and sent messages to his brother Clarence that he would\r\nforgive him if he would desert the earl.  No one ever had less faith\r\nor honor than George of Clarence.  He did desert Warwick, just as\r\nthe battle of Barnet Heath was beginning; and Warwick\'s king-making\r\nall ended, for he was killed, with his brother and many others, in\r\nthe battle.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the first news that met Margaret when, after being long\r\nhindered by foul weather, she landed at Plymouth.  She would have\r\ndone more wisely to have gone back, but her son Edward longed to\r\nstrike a blow for his inheritance, and they had friends in Wales\r\nwhom they hope to meet.  So they made their way into Gloucestershire;\r\nbut there King Edward, with both his brothers, came down upon them\r\nat Tewkesbury, and there their army was routed, and the young prince\r\ntaken and killed--some say by the king himself and his brothers.  Poor\r\nbroken hearted Queen Margaret was made prisoner too, and carried to\r\nthe Tower, where she arrived a day or two after the meek and crazed\r\ncaptive, Henry VI., had been slain, that there might be no more\r\nrisings in his name.  And so ended the long war of York and Lancaster\r\n--though not in peace or joy to the savage, faithless family who had\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nEdward was merry and good-natured when not angered, and had quite\r\nsense and ability enough to have been a very good king, if he had not\r\nbeen lazy, selfish, and full of vices.  He actually set out to conquer\r\nFrance, and then let himself be persuaded over and paid off by the\r\ncunning King of France, and went home again, a laughing-stock to\r\neverybody.  The two kings had an interview on a bridge over the River\r\nSomme in France, where they talked through a kind of fence, each being\r\ntoo suspicious of the other to meet, without such a barrier between\r\nthem.  As to George, the king had never trusted him since his shameful\r\nbehavior when Warwick rebelled; besides, he was always abusing the\r\nqueen\'s relations, and Richard was always telling the king of all the\r\nbad and foolish things he did or said.  At last there was a great\r\noutbreak of anger, and the king ordered the Duke of Clarence to be\r\nimprisoned in the Tower; and there, before long, he too was killed.\r\nThe saying was that he was drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine, but\r\nthis is not at all likely to be true.  He left two little children,\r\na boy and a girl.\r\n\r\nSo much cruel slaughter had taken place, that most of the noble\r\nfamilies in England had lost many sons, and a great deal of their\r\nwealth, and none of them ever became again so mighty as the king-\r\nmaker had been.  His daughter, Anne, the wife of poor Edward of\r\nLancaster, was found by Richard, Duke of Gloucester, hidden as a\r\ncook-maid in London, and she was persuaded to marry him--as, indeed,\r\nshe had always been intended for him.  He was a little, thin, slight\r\nman, with one shoulder higher than the other, and keen, cunning dark\r\neyes; and as the king was very tall, with a handsome, blue-eyed face,\r\npeople laughed at the contrast, called Gloucester Richard Crook-back\r\nand were very much afraid of him.\r\n\r\nIt was in this reign that books began to be printed in England instead\r\nof written.  Printing had been found out in Germany a little before,\r\nand books had been shown to Henry VI., but the troubles of his time\r\nkept him from attending to them.  Now, however, Edward\'s sister, the\r\nDuchess of Burgundy, much encouraged a printer named Caxton, whose\r\nbooks she sent her brother, and other presses were set up in London.\r\nAnother great change had come in.  Long ago, in the time of Henry III.,\r\na monk name Roger Bacon had made gunpowder; but nobody used it much\r\nuntil, in the reign of Edward III., it was found out how cannon might\r\nbe fired with it; and some say it was first used in the battle of Crecy.\r\nBut it was not till the reign of Edward IV. that smaller guns, such\r\nas each soldier could carry one of for himself, were invented--\r\nharquebuses, as they were called;--and after this the whole way of\r\nfighting was gradually altered.  Printing and gunpowder both made\r\ngreat changes in everything, though not all at once.  King Edward\r\ndid not live to see the changes.  He had hurt his health with his\r\nrevellings and amusements, and died quite in middle age, in the year\r\n1483: seeing, perhaps, at last, how much better a king he might have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nEDWARD V.  A.D. 1483.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward IV. left several daughters and two sons--Edward, Prince of\r\nWales, who was fourteen years old, and Richard, Duke of York, who was\r\neleven.  Edward was at Ludlow Castle--where the princes of Wales were\r\nalways brought up--with his mother\'s brother, Lord Rivers; his half-\r\nbrother, Richard Grey; and other gentlemen.\r\n\r\nWhen the tidings came of his father\'s death, they set out to bring\r\nhim to London to be crowned king.\r\n\r\nBut, in the meantime, the Duke of Gloucester and several of the\r\nnoblemen, especially the Duke of Buckingham, agreed that it was\r\nunbearable that the queen and her brothers should go on having all\r\nthe power, as they had done in Edward\'s time.  Till the king was old\r\nenough to govern, his father\'s brother, the Duke of Gloucester, was\r\nthe proper person to rule for him, and they would soon put an end to\r\nthe Woodvilles.  The long wars had made everybody cruel and regardless\r\nof the laws, so that no one made much objection when Gloucester and\r\nBuckingham met the king and took him from his uncle and half-brother,\r\nwho were sent off to Pontefract Castle, and in a short time their\r\nheads were cut off there.  Another of the late king\'s friends was\r\nLord Hastings; and as he sat at the council table in the Tower of\r\nLondon, with the other lords, Richard came in, and showing his own\r\nlean, shrunken arm, declared that Lord Hastings had bewitched him,\r\nand made it so.  The other lords began to say the _if_ he done so\r\nit was horrible.  But Richard would listen to no _ifs_, and said\r\nhe would not dine till Hasting\'s head was off.  And his cruel word\r\nwas done.\r\n\r\nThe queen saw that harm was intended, and went with all her other\r\nchildren to her former refuge in the sanctuary at Westminster; nor\r\nwould she leave it when her son Edward rode in state into London and\r\nwas taken to the Tower, which was then a palace as well as a prison.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Gloucester and the Council said that this pretence at fear\r\nwas very foolish, and that the little Duke of York ought to be with\r\nhis brother; and they sent the Archbishop of Canterbury to desire her\r\nto give the boy up.  He found the queen sitting desolate, with all her\r\nlong light hair streaming about her, and her children round her; and\r\nhe spoke kindly to her at first and tried to persuade her of what he\r\nreally believed himself--that it was all her foolish fears and fancies\r\nthat the Duke of Gloucester could mean any ill to his little nephew,\r\nand that the two brothers ought to be together in his keeping.\r\n\r\nElizabeth cried, and said that the boys were better apart, for they\r\nquarrelled when they were together, and that she could not give up\r\nlittle Richard.  In truth, she guessed that their uncle wanted to\r\nget rid of them and to reign himself; and she knew that while she\r\nhad Richard, Edward would be safe, since it would not make him king\r\nto destroy one without the other.  Archbishop Morton, who believed\r\nRichard\'s smooth words, and was a very good, kind man, thought this\r\nall a woman\'s nonsense, and told her that if she would not give up\r\nthe boy freely, he would be taken from her by force.  If she had been\r\nreally a wise, brave mother, she would have gone to the Tower with\r\nher boy, as queen and mother, and watched over her children herself.\r\nBut she had always been a silly, selfish woman, and she was afraid\r\nfor herself.  So she let the archbishop lead her child away, and\r\nonly sat crying in the sanctuary instead of keeping sight of him.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that happened was, that the Duke of Gloucester caused\r\none Dr. Shaw to preach a sermon to the people of London in the open\r\nair, explaining that King Edward IV. had been a very bad man, and had\r\nnever been properly married to Lady Grey, and so that she was no queen\r\nat all, and her children had no right to reign.  The Londoners liked\r\nGloucester and hated the Woodvilles, and all belonging to them, and\r\nafter some sermons and speeches of this sort, there were so many\r\npeople inclined to take as their king the man rather than the boy,\r\nthat the Duke of Buckingham led a deputation to request Richard to\r\naccept the crown in his nephew\'s stead.  He met it as if the whole\r\nnotion was quite new to him, but, of course, accepted the crown, sent\r\nfor his wife, Anne Nevil, and her son, and was soon crowned as King\r\nRichard III. of England.\r\n\r\nAs for the two boys, they were never seen out of the Tower again.\r\nThey were sent into the prison part of it, and nobody exactly knows\r\nwhat became of them there; but there cannot be much doubt that they\r\nmust have been murdered.  Some years later, two men confessed that\r\nthey had been employed to smother the two brothers with pillows, as\r\nthey slept; and though they added some particulars to the story that\r\ncan hardly be believed, it is most likely that this was true.  Full\r\ntwo hundred years later, a chest was found under a staircase, in\r\nwhat is called the White Tower, containing bones that evidently had\r\nbelonged to boys of about fourteen and eleven years old; and these\r\nwere placed in a marble urn among the tombs of the kings in\r\nWestminster Abbey.  But even to this day, there are some people who\r\ndoubt whether Edward V. and Richard of York were really murdered, or\r\nif Richard were not a person who came back to England and tried to\r\nmake himself king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nRICHARD III.  A.D. 1483--1485.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard III. seems to have wished to be a good and great king; but he\r\nhad made his way to the throne in too evil a manner to be likely to\r\nprosper.  How many people he had put to death we do not know, for when\r\nthe English began to suspect the he had murdered his two nephews, they\r\nalso accused him of the death of everyone who had been secretly slain\r\never since Edward IV. came to the throne, when he had been a mere boy.\r\nHe found he must be always on the watch; and his home was unhappy, for\r\nhis son, for whose sake he had striven so hard to be king, died while\r\nyet a boy, and Anne, his wife, not long after.\r\n\r\nThen his former staunch friend, the Duke of Buckingham, began to feel\r\nthat though he wanted the sons of Elizabeth Woodville to be set aside\r\nfrom reigning, it was quite another thing to murder them.  He was a\r\nvain, proud man, who had a little royal blood--being descended from\r\nThomas, the first Duke of Gloucester, son of Edward III.--and he\r\nbethought himself that, now all the House of Lancaster was gone, and\r\nso many of the House of York, he might possibly become king.  But he\r\nhad hardly begun to make a plot, before the keen-sighted, watchful\r\nRichard found it out, and had him seized and beheaded.\r\n\r\nThere was another plot, though, that Richard did not find out in time.\r\nThe real House of Lancaster had ended when poor young Edward was\r\nkilled at Tewkesbury; but the Beauforts--the children of that younger\r\nfamily of John of Gaunt, who had first begun the quarrel with the Duke\r\nof York--were not all dead.  Lady Margaret Beaufort, the daughter of\r\nthe eldest son, had married a Welsh gentleman named Edmund Tudor, and\r\nhad a son called Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond.  Edward IV. had always\r\nfeared that this youth might rise against him, and he had been obliged\r\nto wander about in France and Brittany since the death of his father;\r\nbut nobody was afraid of Lady Margaret, and she had married a Yorkist\r\nnobleman, Lord Stanley.\r\n\r\nNow, the eldest daughter of Edward IV.--Elizabeth, or Lady Bessee, as\r\nshe was called--was older than her poor young brothers; and she heard,\r\nto her great horror, that her uncle wanted to commit the great\r\nwickedness of making her his wife, after poor Anne Nevil\'s death.\r\nThere is a curious old set of verses, written by Lord Stanley\'s\r\nsquire, which says that Lady Bessee called Lord Stanley to a secret\r\nroom, and begged him to send to his stepson, Richmond, to invite him\r\nto come to England and set them all free.\r\n\r\nStanley said he could not write well enough, and that he could not\r\ntrust a scribe; but Lady Bessee said she could write as well as any\r\nscribe in England.  So she told him to come to her chamber at nine\r\nthat evening, with his trusty squire; and there she wrote letters,\r\nkneeling by the table, to all the noblemen likely to be discontented\r\nwith Richard, and appointing a place of meeting with Stanley; and she\r\npromised herself that, if Henry Tudor would come and overthrow the\r\ncruel tyrant Richard, she would marry him: and she sent him a ring\r\nin pledge of her promise.\r\n\r\nHenry was in Brittany when he received the letter.  He kissed the\r\nring, but waited long before he made up his mind to try his fortune.\r\nAt last he sailed in a French ship, and landed at Milford Haven--for\r\nhe knew the Welsh would be delighted to see him; and, as he was really\r\ndescended from the great British chiefs, they seemed to think that\r\nto make him king of England would be almost like having King Arthur\r\nback again.\r\n\r\nThey gathered round him, and so did a great many English nobles and\r\ngentlemen.  But Richard, though very angry, was not much alarmed, for\r\nhe knew Henry Tudor had never seen a battle.  He marched out to meet\r\nhim, and a terrible fight took place at Redmore Heath, near Market\r\nBosworth, where, after long and desperate struggling, Richard was\r\noverwhelmed and slain, his banner taken, and his men either killed\r\nor driven from the field.  His body was found gashed, bleeding, and\r\nstripped; and thus was thrown across a horse and carried into\r\nLeicester, where he had slept the night before.\r\n\r\nThe crown he had worn over his helmet was picked up from the branches\r\nof a hawthorn, and set on the head of Henry Tudor.  Richard was the\r\nlast king of the Plantagenet family, who had ruled over England for\r\nmore than three hundred years.  This battle of Bosworth likewise\r\nfinished the whole bloody war of the Red and White Roses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nHENRY VII.  A.D. 1485--1509.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Tudor married the Lady Bessee as soon as he came to London, and\r\nby this marriage the causes of the Red and white Roses were united;\r\nso that he took for his badge a great rose--half red and half white.\r\nYou may see it carved all over the beautiful chapel that he built on\r\nto Westminster Abbey to be buried in.\r\n\r\nHe was not a very pleasant person; he was stiff, and cold, and dry,\r\nand very mean and covetous in some ways--though he liked to make a\r\ngrand show, and dress all his court in cloth of gold and silver,\r\nand the very horses in velvet housings, whenever there was any state\r\noccasion.  Nobody greatly cared for him; but the whole country was so\r\nworn out with the troubles of the Wars of the Roses, that there was\r\nno desire to interfere with him; and people only grumbled, and said\r\nhe did not treat his gentle, beautiful wife Elizabeth as he ought to\r\ndo, but was jealous of her being a king\'s daughter.  There was one\r\nperson who did hate him most bitterly, and that was the Duchess of\r\nBurgundy, the sister of Edward IV. and Richard III.: the same who,\r\nas I told you, encouraged printing so much.  She felt as if a mean\r\nupstart had got into the place of her brothers, and his having\r\nmarried her niece did not make it seem a bit the better to her.\r\nThere was one nephew left--the poor young orphan son of George, Duke\r\nof Clarence--but he had always been quite silly, and Henry VII. had\r\nhim watched carefully, for fear some one should set him up to claim\r\nthe crown.  He was called Earl of Warwick, as heir to his grandfather,\r\nthe king-maker.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a young man came to Ireland and pretended to be this Earl\r\nof Warwick.  He deceived a good many of the Irish, and the Mayor of\r\nDublin actually took him to St. Patrick\'s Cathedral, where he was\r\ncrowned as King Edward the Sixth: and then he was carried to the\r\nbanquet upon an Irish chieftain\'s back.  He came to England with some\r\nIrish followers, and some German soldiers hired by the duchess; and\r\na few, but not many, English joined him.  Henry met him at a village\r\ncalled Stoke, near Newark, and all his Germans and Irish were killed,\r\nand he himself made prisoner.  Then he confessed that he was really\r\na baker\'s son named Lambert Simnel; and, as he turned out to be a\r\npoor weak lad, whom designing people had made to do just what they\r\npleased, the king took him into his kitchen as a scullion; and, as\r\nhe behaved well there, afterwards set him to look after the falcons,\r\nthat people used to keep to go out with to catch partridges and herons.\r\n\r\nBut after this, a young man appeared under the protection of the\r\nDuchess of Burgundy, who said he was no other than the poor little\r\nDuke of York, Richard, who had escaped from the Tower when his brother\r\nwas murdered.  Englishmen, who came from Flanders, said that he was\r\na clever, cowardly lad of the name of Peter (or Perkin) Warbeck, the\r\nson of a townsman of Tournay; but the duchess persuaded King James\r\nIV. of Scotland to believe him a real royal Plantagenet.  He went to\r\nEdinburgh, married a beautiful lady, cousin to the king, and James\r\nled him into England at the head of an army to put forward his claim.\r\nBut nobody would join him, and the Scots did not care about him; so\r\nJames sent him away to Ireland, whence he went to Cornwall.  However,\r\nhe soon found fighting was of no use, and fled away to the New Forest,\r\nwhere he was taken prisoner.  He was set in the stocks, and there made\r\nto confess that he was really Perkin Warbeck and no duke, and then he\r\nwas shut up in the Tower.  But there he made friends with the real\r\nEarl of Warwick, and persuaded him into a plan for escape; but this\r\nwas found out, and Henry, thinking that he should never have any\r\npeace or safety whilst either of them was alive, caused Perkin to\r\nbe hanged, and poor innocent Edward of Warwick to be beheaded.\r\n\r\nIt was thought that this cruel deed was done because Henry found\r\nthat foreign kings did not think him safe upon the throne while one\r\nPlantagenet was left alive, and would not give their children in\r\nmarriage to his sons and daughters.  He was very anxious to make grand\r\nmarriages for his children, and make peace with Scotland by a wedding\r\nbetween King James and his eldest daughter, Margaret.  For his eldest\r\nson, Arthur, Prince of Wales, he obtained Katharine, the daughter\r\nof the King of Aragon and Queen of Castille, and she was brought to\r\nEngland while both were mere children.  Prince Arthur died when only\r\neighteen years old; and King Henry then said that they had been both\r\nsuch children that they could not be considered really married, and so\r\nthat Katharine had better marry his next son, Henry, although everyone\r\nknew that no marriage between a man and his brother\'s widow could be\r\nlawful.  The truth was that he did not like to give up all the money\r\nand jewels she had brought; and the matter remained in dispute for\r\nsome years--nor was it settled when King Henry himself died, after an\r\nillness that no one expected would cause his death.  Nobody was very\r\nsorry for him, for he had been hard upon everyone, and had encouraged\r\ntwo wicked judges, named Dudley and Empson, who made people pay most\r\nunjust demands, and did everything to fill the king\'s treasury and\r\nmake themselves rich at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt was a time when many changes were going on peacefully.  The great\r\nnobles had grown much poorer and less powerful; and the country\r\nsquires and chief people in the towns reckoned for much more in\r\nthe State.  Moreover, there was much learning and study going on\r\neverywhere.  Greek began to be taught as well as Latin, and the\r\nNew Testament was thus read in the language in which the apostles\r\nthemselves wrote; and that led people to think over some of the evil\r\nways that had grown up in their churches and abbeys, during those\r\nlong, grievous years, when no one thought of much but fighting, or\r\nof getting out of the way of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe king himself, and all his family, loved learning, and nobody more\r\nthan his son Henry, who--if his elder brother had lived--was to have\r\nbeen archbishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nIt was in this reign, too, that America was discovered--though not by\r\nthe English, but by Christopher Columbus, an Italian, who came out\r\nin ships that were lent to him by Isabel, the Queen of Spain, mother\r\nto Katharine, Princess of Wales.  Henry had been very near sending\r\nColumbus, only he did not like spending so much money.  How ever, he\r\nafterwards did send out some ships, which discovered Newfoundland.\r\nHenry died in the year 1509.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nHENRY VIII. AND CARDINAL WOLSEY.  A.D. 1509--1529.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new king was very fond of the Princess Katharine, and he married\r\nher soon after his father\'s death, without asking any more questions\r\nabout the right or wrong of it.  He began with very gallant and\r\nprosperous times.  He was very handsome, and skilled in all sports\r\nand games, and had such frank, free manners, that the people felt as\r\nif they had one of their best old Plantagenets back again.  They were\r\npleased, too, when he quarreled with the King of France, and like an\r\nold Plantagenet, led an army across the sea and besieged the town of\r\nTournay.  Again, it was like the time of Edward III., for James IV.\r\nof Scotland was a friend of the French king, and came across the\r\nBorder with all the strength of Scotland, to ravage England while\r\nHenry was away.  But there were plenty of stout Englishmen left, and\r\nunder the Earl of Surrey, they beat the Scots entirely at the battle\r\nof Flodden field; and King James himself was not taken, but left dead\r\nupon the field, while his kingdom went to his poor little baby son.\r\nThough there had been a battle in France it was not another Crecy,\r\nfor the French ran away so fast that it was called the battle of the\r\nSpurs.  However, Henry\'s expedition did not come to much, for he did\r\nnot get all the help he was promised; and he made peace with the\r\nFrench king, giving him in marriage his beautiful young sister Mary--\r\nthough King Louis was an old, helpless, sickly man.  Indeed, he only\r\nlived six weeks after the wedding, and before there was time to fetch\r\nQueen Mary home again, she had married a gentleman named Charles\r\nBrandon.  She told he brother that she had married once to please\r\nhim, and now she had married to please herself.  But he forgave her,\r\nand made her husband Duke of Suffolk.\r\n\r\nHenry\'s chief adviser, at this time, was Thomas Wolsey, Archbishop\r\nof York; a very able man, and of most splendid tastes and habits--\r\noutdoing even the Tudors in love of show.  The pope had made him a\r\ncardinal--that is, one of the clergy, who are counted as parish\r\npriests in the diocese of Rome, and therefore have a right to choose\r\nthe pope.  They wear scarlet hats, capes, and shoes, and are the\r\nhighest rank of all the clergy except the pope.  Indeed, Cardinal\r\nWolsey was in hopes of being chosen pope himself, and setting the\r\nwhole Church to rights--for there had been several very wicked men\r\nreigning at Rome, one after the other, and they had brought things\r\nto such a pass that everyone felt there would be some great judgment\r\nfrom God if some improvement were not made.  Most of Wolsey\'s\r\narrangements with foreign princes had this end in view.  The new\r\nking of France, Francis I., was young, brilliant and splendid, like\r\nHenry, and the two had a conference near Calais, when they brought\r\ntheir queens and their whole Court, and put up tents of velvet, silk,\r\nand gold--while everything was so extraordinarily magnificent, that\r\nthe meeting has ever since been called the Field of the Cloth of Gold.\r\n\r\nHowever, nothing came of it all.  Cardinal Wolsey thought Francis\'s\r\nenemy--the Emperor Charles V.--more likely to help him to be pope,\r\nand make his master go over to that side; but after all an Italian\r\nwas chosen in his stead.  And there came a new trouble in his way.\r\nThe king and queen had been married a good many years, and they had\r\nonly one child alive, and that was a girl, the Lady Mary--all the\r\nothers had died as soon as they were born--and statesmen began to\r\nthink that if there never was a son at all, there might be fresh wars\r\nwhen Henry died; while others said that the loss of the children was\r\nto punish them for marrying unlawfully.  Wolsey himself began to wish\r\nthat the pope would say that it had never been a real marriage, and\r\nso to set the king free to put Katharine away and take another wife--\r\nsome grand princess abroad.  This was thinking more of what seemed\r\nprudent than of the right; and it turned out ill for Wolsey and all\r\nbesides, for no sooner had the notion of setting aside poor Katharine\r\ncome into his mind, than the king cast his eyes on Anne Boleyn, one\r\nof her maids of honor--a lively lady, who had been to France with his\r\nsister Mary.  He was bent on marrying her, and insisted on the pope\'s\r\ngiving sentence against Katharine.  But the pope would not make any\r\nanswer at all; first, because he was enquiring, and then because he\r\ncould not well offend Katharine\'s nephew, the Emperor.  Time went on,\r\nand the king grew more impatient, and at last a clergyman, named\r\nThomas Cranmer, said that he might settle the matter by asking the\r\nlearned men at the universities whether it was lawful for a man to\r\nmarry his brother\'s widow.  "He has got the right sow by the ear,"\r\ncried Henry, who was not choice in his words, and he determined that\r\nthe universities should decide it.  But Wolsey would not help the\r\nking here.  He knew that the pope had been the only person to decide\r\nsuch questions all over the Western Church for many centuries; and,\r\nbesides, he had never intended to assist the king to lower himself by\r\ntaking a wife like Anne Boleyn.  But his secretary, Thomas Crumwell,\r\ntold the king all of Wolsey\'s disapproval, and between them they found\r\nout something that the cardinal had done by the king\'s own wish, but\r\nwhich did not agree with the old disused laws.  He was put down from\r\nall his offices of state, and accused of treason against the king; but\r\nwhile he was being brought to London to be tried, he became so ill at\r\nthe abbey at Leicester that he was forced to remain there, and in a\r\nfew days he died, saying, sadly--"If I had served God as I have served\r\nmy king, He would not have forsaken me in my old age."\r\n\r\nWith Cardinal Wolsey ended the first twenty years of Henry\'s reign,\r\nand all that had ever been good in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nHENRY VIII. AND HIS WIVES.  A.D. 1528--1547.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Henry VIII. had so ungratefully treated Cardinal Wolsey, there\r\nwas no one to keep him in order.  He would have no more to do with the\r\npope, but said he was head of the Church of England himself, and could\r\nsettle matters his own way.  He really was a very learned man, and had\r\nwritten a book to uphold the doctrines of the Church, which had caused\r\nthe people to call him the Defender of the Faith.  After the king\'s or\r\nqueen\'s name on an English coin you may see F.D.--_Fidei Defensor_.\r\nThis stands for that name in Latin.  But Henry used his learning now\r\nagainst the pope.  He declared that his marriage with Katharine was\r\ngood for nothing, and sent her away to a house in Huntingdonshire,\r\nwhere, in three years\' time, she pined away and died.  In the meantime,\r\nhe had married Anne Boleyn, taken Crumwell for his chief adviser, and\r\nhad made Thomas Cranmer archbishop of Canterbury.  Then, calling\r\nhimself the head of the Church, he insisted that all his people should\r\nown him as such; but the good ones knew that our Lord Jesus Christ is\r\nthe only real Head of the Church, and they had learnt to believe that\r\nthe pope is the father bishop of the west, though he had sometimes\r\ntaken more power than he ought, and no king could ever be the same\r\nas a patriarch or father bishop.  So they refused, and Henry cut off\r\nthe heads of two of the best--Bishop Fisher and Sir Thomas More--\r\nthough they had been his great friends.  Sir Thomas More\'s good\r\ndaughter Margaret, came and kissed him on his way to be executed;\r\nand afterwards, when his head was placed on a spike on London Bridge,\r\nshe came by night in a boat and took it home in her arms.\r\n\r\nThere were many people, however, who were glad to break with the pope,\r\nbecause so much had gone amiss in the Church, and they wanted to set\r\nit to rights.  There was so much more reading, now that printing had\r\nbeen invented, that many could read who had never learnt Latin, and\r\nso a translation of the Bible was to be made for them, and there was\r\na great desire that the Church Services--many of which had also been\r\nin Latin--should likewise be put into English, and the litany was first\r\ntranslated, but no more at present.  The king and Crumwell had taken\r\nit upon them to go on with what had been begun in Wolsey\'s time--the\r\nlooking into the state of all the monasteries.  Some were found going\r\non badly, and the messengers took care to make the worst of everything.\r\nSo all the worst houses were broken up, and the monks sent to their\r\nhomes, with a small payment to maintain them for the rest of their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nAs to the lands that good men of old had given to keep up the convents,\r\nthat God might be praised there, Henry made gifts of them to the lords\r\nabout Court.  Whoever chose to ask for an abbey could get it, from the\r\nking\'s good nature; and, as they wanted more and more, Henry went on\r\nbreaking up the monasteries, till the whole of them were gone.  A good\r\ndeal of their riches he kept for himself, and two new bishoprics were\r\nendowed from their spoils, but most of them were bestowed on the\r\ncourtiers.  The king, however, did not at all intend to change the\r\nteaching of the Church, and whenever a person was detected in teaching\r\nany thing contrary to her doctrines, as they were at the time\r\nunderstood, he was tried by a court of clergymen and lawyers before\r\nthe bishop, and, if convicted, was--according to the cruel custom of\r\nthose times--burnt to death at a stake in the market place of the\r\nnext town.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the new queen, Anne Boleyn, whom the king had married\r\nprivately in May, 1533, had not prospered.  She had one little\r\ndaughter, named Elizabeth, and a son, who died; and then the king\r\nbegan to admire one of her ladies, named Jane Seymour.  Seeing this\r\nAnne\'s enemies either invented stories against her, or made the worst\r\nof some foolish, unlady-like, and unqueen-like things she had said\r\nand done, so that the king thought she wished for his death.  She was\r\naccused of high treason, sentenced to death, and beheaded: thus\r\npaying a heavy price for the harm she had done good Queen Katharine.\r\n\r\nThe king, directly after, married Jane Seymour; but she lived only a\r\nvery short time, dying immediately after the christening of her first\r\nson, who was named Edward.\r\n\r\nThen the king was persuaded by Lord Crumwell to marry a foreign\r\nprincess called Anne of Cleves.  A great painter was sent to bring her\r\npicture, and made her very beautiful in it; but when she arrived, she\r\nproved to be not only plain-featured but large and clumsy, and the\r\nking could not bear the sight of her, and said they had sent him a\r\ngreat Flanders mare by way of queen.  So he made Cranmer find some\r\nfoolish excuse for breaking this marriage also, and was so angry with\r\nThomas Crumwell for having led him into it, that this favorite was in\r\nturn thrown into prison and beheaded.\r\n\r\nThe king chose another English wife, named Katharine Howard; but,\r\nafter he had married her, it was found out that she had been very ill\r\nbrought up, and the bad people with whom she had been left came and\r\naccused her of the evil into which they had led her.  So the king cut\r\noff her head, likewise, and then wanted to find another wife; but no\r\nforeign princess would take a husband who had put away two wives and\r\nbeheaded two more, and one Italian lady actually answered that she\r\nwas much obliged to him, but she could not venture to marry him,\r\nbecause she had only one neck.\r\n\r\nAt last he found an English widow, Lady Latimer, whose maiden name\r\nwas Katharine Parr, and married her.  He was diseased now, lame with\r\ngout, and very large and fat; and she nursed him kindly, and being a\r\ngood-natured woman, persuaded him to be kinder to his daughters, Mary\r\nand Elizabeth, than he had ever been since the disgrace of their\r\nmothers; and she did her best to keep him in good humor, but he went\r\non doing cruel things, even to the end of his life; and, at the very\r\nlast, had in prison the very same Duke of Norfolk who had won the\r\nbattle of Flodden, and would have put him to death in a few days\'\r\ntime, only that his own death prevented it.\r\n\r\nYet, strange to say, Henry VIII. was not hated as might have been\r\nexpected.  His cruelties were chiefly to the nobles, not to the common\r\npeople; and he would do good-natured things, and speak with a frank,\r\nopen manner, that was much liked.  England was prosperous, too, and\r\nshopkeepers, farmers, and all were well off; there was plenty of\r\nbread and meat for all, and the foreign nations were afraid to go\r\nto war with us.  So the English people, on the whole, loved "Bluff\r\nKing Hal," as they called him, and did not think much about his many\r\nwickednesses, or care how many heads he cut off.  He died in the year\r\n1547.  The changes in his time are generally called the beginning of\r\nthe Reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nEDWARD VI.  A.D. 1547--1553.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little son of Henry VIII. and Jane Seymour of course reigned\r\nafter him as Edward VI.  He was a quiet, gentle boy exceedingly fond\r\nof  learning and study, and there were great expectations of him; but, as\r\nhe was only nine years old, the affairs of state were managed by his\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the council were his two uncles--his mother\'s brothers,\r\nEdward and Thomas Seymour, the elder of whom had been made Duke of\r\nSomerset--together with Archbishop Cranmer; but it was not long before\r\nthe duke quarreled with his brother Thomas, put him into the Tower,\r\nand cut off his head, so that it seemed as if the days of Henry VIII.\r\nwere not yet over.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Somerset and Archbishop Cranmer wanted to make many more\r\nchanges in the Church of England than Henry VIII. had ever allowed.\r\nThey had all the Prayer-book Services translated into English, leaving\r\nout such parts as they did not approve; The Lessons were read from the\r\nEnglish Bible, and people were greatly delighted at being able to\r\nworship and to listen to God\'s Word in their own tongue.  The first\r\nday on which the English Prayer-book was used was the Whitsunday of\r\n1548.  The Bibles were chained to the desks as being so precious and\r\nvaluable; and crowds would stand, or sit, and listen for hours\r\ntogether to any one who would read to them, without caring if he were\r\na clergyman or not; and men who tried to explain, without being\r\nproperly taught, often made great mistakes.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in Germany and France a great deal of the same kind had been\r\ngoing on for some time past, though not with any sort of leave from\r\nthe kings or bishops, as there was in England, and thus the reformers\r\nthere broke quite off from the Church, and fancied they could do\r\nwithout bishops.  This great break was called the Reformation, because\r\nit professed to set matters of religion to rights; and in Germany the\r\nreformers called themselves Protestants, because they protested some\r\nof the teachings of the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\nCranmer had at one time been in Germany, and had made friends with\r\nsome of these German and Swiss Protestants, and he invited them to\r\nEngland to consult and help him and his friends.  Several of them\r\ncame, and they found fault with our old English Prayer-book--though\r\nit had never been the same as the Roman one--and it was altered again\r\nto please them and their friends, and brought out as King Edward\'s\r\nsecond book.  Indeed, they tried to persuade the English to be like\r\nthemselves--with very few services, no ornaments in the churches, and\r\nno bishops; and things seemed to be tending more and more to what they\r\ndesired, for the king was too young not to do what his tutors and\r\ngovernors wished, and his uncle and Cranmer were all on their side.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was another great nobleman, the Duke of Northumberland,\r\nwho wanted to be as powerful as the Duke of Somerset.  He was the son\r\nof Dudley, the wicked judge under Henry VII., who had made himself so\r\nrich, and he managed to take advantage of the people being discontented\r\nwith Somerset to get the king into his own hands, accuse Somerset of\r\ntreason, send him to the Tower, and cut off his head.\r\n\r\nThe king at this time was sixteen.  He had never been strong, and he\r\nhad learnt and worked much more than was good for him.  He wrote a\r\njournal, and though he never says he grieved for his uncles, most\r\nlikely he did, for he had few near him who really loved or cared for\r\nhim, and he was fast falling into decline, so that it became quite\r\nplain that he was not likely ever to be a grown-up king.  There was\r\na great difficulty as to who was to reign after him.  The natural\r\nperson would have been his eldest sister, Mary, but King Henry had\r\nforbidden her and Elizabeth to be spoken of as princesses or\r\nheiresses of the crown; and, besides, Mary held so firmly to the\r\nChurch, as she had learnt to believe in it in her youth, that the\r\nreformers knew she would undo all their work.\r\n\r\nThere was a little Scottish girl, also named Mary--the grand-daughter\r\nof Margaret, eldest daughter of Henry VII.  Poor child, she had been\r\na queen from babyhood, for her father had died of grief when she was\r\nbut a week old; and there had been some notion of marrying her to King\r\nEdward, and so ending the wars, but the Scots did not like this, and\r\nsent her away to be married to the Dauphin, Francois, eldest son of\r\nthe king of France.  If Edward\'s sisters were not to reign, she came\r\nnext; but the English would not have borne to be joined on to the\r\nFrench; and there were the grand-daughters of Mary, that other sister\r\nof Henry VIII., who were thorough Englishwomen.  Lady Jane Grey, the\r\neldest of them, was a good, sweet, pious, and diligent girl of fifteen,\r\nwonderfully learned.  But it was not for that reason, only for the\r\nsake of the royal blood, that the Duke of Northumberland asked her\r\nin marriage for his son, Guildford Dudley.  When they were married,\r\nthe duke and Cranmer began to persuade the poor, sick, young king\r\nthat it was his duty to leave his crown away from his sister Mary\r\nto Lady Jane, who would go on with the Reformation, while Mary would\r\ntry to overthrow it.  In truth, young Edward had not right to will\r\naway the crown; but he was only sixteen, and could only trust to\r\nwhat the archbishop and his council told him.  So he signed the\r\nparchment they brought him, and after that he quickly grew worse.\r\n\r\nThe people grew afraid that Northumberland was shutting him up and\r\nmisusing him, and once he came to the window of his palace and looked\r\nout at them, to show he was alive; but he died only a fortnight later,\r\nand we cannot guess what he would have been when he was grown up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nMARY I.  A.D. 1553--1588.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Northumberland kept king Edward\'s death a secret till he\r\nhad proclaimed Jane queen of England.  The poor girl knew that a great\r\nwrong was being done in her name.  She wept bitterly, and begged that\r\nshe might not be forced to accept the crown; but she could do nothing\r\nto prevent it, when her father and husband, and his father, all were\r\nbent on making her obey them; and so she had to sit as a queen in the\r\nroyal apartments in the Tower of London.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the news reached Mary, she set off riding towards\r\nLondon; and, as everyone knew her to be the right queen, and no one\r\nwould be tricked by Dudley, the whole of the people joined her, and\r\neven Northumberland was obliged to throw up his hat and cry "God save\r\nQueen Mary."  Jane and her husband were safely kept, but Mary meant\r\nno harm by them if their friends would have been quiet.  However, the\r\npeople became discontented when Mary began to have the Latin service\r\nused again, and put Archbishop Cranmer in prison for having favored\r\nJane.  She showed in every way that she thought all her brother\'s\r\nadvisers had done very wrong.  She wanted to be under the Pope again,\r\nand she engaged herself to marry the King of Spain, her cousin, Philip\r\nII.  This was very foolish of her, for she was a middle-aged woman,\r\npale, and low-spirited; and he was much younger, and of a silent,\r\ngloomy temper, so that everyone was afraid of him.  All her best\r\nfriends advised her not, and the English hated the notion so much, that\r\nthe little children played at the queen\'s wedding in their games, and\r\nalways ended by pretending to hang the King of Spain.  Northumberland\r\nthought this discontent gave another chance for his plan, and tried to\r\nraise the people in favor of Jane; but so few joined him that Mary\r\nvery soon put them down, and beheaded Northumberland.  She thought,\r\ntoo, that the quiet of the country would never be secure while Jane\r\nlived, and so she consented to her being put to death.  Jane behaved\r\nwith beautiful firmness and patience.  Her husband was led out first\r\nand beheaded, and then she followed.  She was most good and innocent\r\nin herself, and it was for the faults of others that she suffered.\r\nMary\'s sister Elizabeth, was suspected, and sent to the Tower.  She\r\ncame in a boat on the Thames to the Traitor\'s Gate; but, when she\r\nfound where she was, she sat down on the stone steps and said, "This\r\nis a place for traitors, and I am none."  After a time she was allowed\r\nto live in the country, but closely watched.\r\n\r\nPhilip of Spain came and was married to Mary.  She was very fond of\r\nhim, but he was not very kind to her, and he had too much to do in\r\nhis other kingdoms to spend much time with her, so that she was always\r\npining after him.  Her great wish in choosing him was to be helped\r\nin bringing the country back to the old obedience to the Pope; and\r\nshe succeeded in having the English Church reconciled, and received\r\nagain to communion with Rome.  The new service she would under no\r\nconsideration have established in her house.  This displeased many\r\nof her subjects exceedingly.  They thought they should be forbidden\r\nto read the Bible--they could not endure the Latin service--and those\r\nwho had been taught by the foreigners fancied that all proper reverence\r\nand beauty in church was a sort of idolatry.  Some fled away into\r\nHolland and Germany, and others, who staid, and taught loudly against\r\nthe doctrines that were to be brought back again, were seized and\r\nthrown into prison.\r\n\r\nThose bishops who had been foremost in the changes of course were the\r\nfirst to be tried for their teaching.  The punishment was the dreadful\r\none of being burnt alive, chained to a stake.  Bishop Hooper died in\r\nthis way at Gloucester, and Bishop Ridley and Bishop Latimer were both\r\nburnt at the same time at Oxford, encouraging one another to die\r\nbravely as martyrs for the truth, as they held it.  Cranmer was in\r\nprison already for supporting Jane Grey, and he was condemned to\r\ndeath; but he was led to expect that he would be spared the fire if\r\nhe would allow that the old faith, as Rome held it, was the right one.\r\nPaper after paper was brought, such as would please the queen and his\r\njudges, and he signed them all; but after all, it turned out that\r\nnone would do, and that he was to be burnt in spite of them.  The he\r\nfelt what a base part he had acted, and was ashamed when he thought\r\nhow bravely his brethren had died on the same spot: and when he was\r\nchained to the stake and the fire lighted, he held his right hand\r\nover the flame to be burnt first, because it had signed what he did\r\nnot really believe, and he cried out, "This unworthy hand!"\r\n\r\nAltogether, about three hundred people were burnt in Queen Mary\'s\r\nreign for denying one or other of the doctrines that the Pope thought\r\nthe right ones.  It was a terrible time; and the queen, who had only\r\nlonged to do right and restore her country to the Church, found\r\nherself hated and disliked by everyone.  Even the Pope, who had a\r\nquarrel with her husband, did not treat her warmly; and the nobles,\r\nwho had taken possession of the abbey lands, were determined never\r\nto let her restore them.  Her husband did not love her, or like\r\nEngland.  However, he persuaded her to help him in a war with the\r\nFrench, with which England out to have had nothing to do, and the\r\nconsequence was that a brave French duke took the city of Calais,\r\nthe very last possession of the English in France.  Mary was so\r\nexceedingly grieved, that she said that when she died the name of\r\nCalais would be found written on her heart.\r\n\r\nShe was already ill, and there was a bad fever at the time, of which\r\nmany of those she most loved and trusted had fallen sick.  She died,\r\nin 1558, a melancholy and sorrowful woman, after reigning only five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH.  A.D. 1558--1587.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through Queen Mary\'s time, her sister Elizabeth, Anne Boleyn\'s\r\ndaughter, had been in trouble.  Those who held by Queen Mary, and\r\nmaintained Henry\'s first marriage, said that his wedding with Anne\r\nwas no real one, and so that Elizabeth ought not to reign; but then\r\nthere was no one else to take in her stead, except the young Queen\r\nMary of Scotland, wife to the French dauphin.  All who wished for\r\nthe Reformation, and dreaded Mary\'s persecutions had hoped to see\r\nElizabeth queen, and this had made Mary much afraid of her; and she\r\nwas so closely watched and guarded that once she even said she wished\r\nshe was a milkmaid, to be left in peace.  While she had been in the\r\nTower she had made friends with another prisoner, Robert Dudley,\r\nbrother to the husband of Lady Jane Grey, and she continued to like\r\nhim better than any other person as long as he lived.\r\n\r\nWhen Mary died, Elizabeth was twenty-five, and the English were mostly\r\nwilling to have her for their queen.  She had read, thought, and\r\nlearnt a great deal; and she took care to have the advice of wise men,\r\nespecially of the great Thomas Cecil, whom she made Lord Burleigh, and\r\nkept as her adviser as long as he lived.  She did not always follow\r\neven his advice, however; but, whenever she did, it was the better\r\nfor her.  She knew Robert Dudley was not wise, so, though she was so\r\nfond of him, she never let him manage her affairs for her.  She would\r\nhave wished to marry, but she knew her subjects would think this\r\ndisgraceful, so she only made him Earl of Leicester: and her liking\r\nfor him prevented her from ever bringing herself to accept any of\r\nthe foreign princes who were always making proposals to her.\r\nUnfortunately he was not a good man, and did not make a good use of\r\nher favor, and he was much disliked by all the queen\'s best friends.\r\n\r\nShe was very fond of making stately journeys through the country.  All\r\nthe poor people ran to see her and admire her; but the noblemen who\r\nhad to entertain her were almost ruined, she brought so many people\r\nwho ate so much, and she expected such presents.  These journeys were\r\ncalled Progresses.  The most famous was to Lord Leicester\'s castle\r\nof Kenilworth, but he could quite afford it.  He kept the clock\'s\r\nhands at twelve o\'clock all the time, that it might always seem to\r\nbe dinner time!\r\n\r\nElizabeth wanted to keep the English Church a pure and true branch of\r\nthe Church, free of the mistakes that had crept in before her father\'s\r\ntime.  So she restored the English Prayer-book, and cancelled all that\r\nMary had done; the people who had gone into exile returned, and all\r\nthe Protestants abroad reckoned her as on their side.  But, on the\r\nother hand, the Pope would not regard her as queen at all, and cut\r\nher and her country off from the Church, while Mary of Scotland and her\r\nhusband called themselves the true queen and king of England; and such\r\nof the English as believed the Pope to have the first right over the\r\nChurch, held with him and Mary of Scotland.  They were called Roman\r\nCatholics, while Elizabeth and her friends were the real Catholics,\r\nfor they held with the Church Universal of old: and it was the Pope\r\nwho had broken off with them for not accepting his doctrines, not\r\nthey with the Pope.  The English who had lived abroad in Mary\'s time\r\nwanted to have much more altered, and to have churches and services\r\nmuch less beautiful and more plain than they were.  But Elizabeth\r\nnever would consent to this; and these people called themselves\r\nPuritans, and continued to object to the Episcopal form of worship.\r\n\r\nMary of Scotland was two years queen of France, and then her husband\r\ndied, and she had to come back to Scotland.  There most of the people\r\nhad taken up the doctrines that made them hate the sight of the clergy\r\nand services she had brought home from France; they called her an\r\nidolater, and would hardly bear that she should hear the old service\r\nin her own chapel.  She was one of the most beautiful and charming\r\nwomen who ever lived, and if she had been as true and good as she\r\nwas lovely, nobody could have done more good; but the court of France\r\nat that time was a wicked place, and she had learnt much of the\r\nwickedness.  She married a young nobleman named Henry Stuart, a\r\ncousin of her own, but he turned out foolish, selfish and head-strong,\r\nand made her miserable; indeed, he helped to kill her secretary in her\r\nown bedroom before her eyes.  She hated him so much at last, that\r\nthere is only too much reason to fear that she knew of the plot, laid\r\nby some of her lords, to blow the poor man\'s house up with gunpowder,\r\nwhile he lay is his bed ill of smallpox.  At any rate, she very soon\r\nmarried one of the very worst of the nobles who had committed the\r\nmurder.  Her subjects could not bear this, and they rose against her\r\nand made her prisoner, while her husband fled the country.  They shut\r\nher up in a castle in the middle of a lake, and obliged her to give\r\nup her crown to her little son, James VI.--a baby not a year old.\r\nHowever, her sweet words persuaded a boy who waited on her to steal\r\nthe keys, and row her across the lake, and she was soon at the head of\r\nan army of her Roman Catholic subjects.  They were defeated, however,\r\nand she found no place safe for her in Scotland, so she fled across\r\nthe Border to England.  Queen Elizabeth hardly knew what to do.  She\r\nbelieved that Mary had really had to do with Henry Stuart\'s death,\r\nbut she could not bear to make such a crime known in a cousin and\r\nqueen; and what made it all more difficult to judge was, that the\r\nkings of France and Spain, and all the Roman Catholics at home,\r\nthought Mary ought to be queen instead of Elizabeth, and she might\r\nhave been set up against England if she might had gone abroad, or\r\nbeen left at large, while in Scotland she would have been murdered.\r\nThe end of it was that Elizabeth kept her shut up in different\r\ncastles.  There she managed to interest the English Roman Catholics\r\nin her, and get them to lay plots, which always were found out.\r\nThen nobles were put to death, and Mary was more closely watched.\r\nThis went on for nineteen years, and at last a worse plot than all\r\nwas found out--for actually killing Queen Elizabeth.  Her servants\r\ndid not act honorably, for when they found out what was going on\r\nthey pretended not to know, so that Mary might go on writing worse\r\nand worse things, and then, at last, the whole was made known.  Mary\r\nwas tried and sentenced to death, but Elizabeth was a long time\r\nmaking up her mind to sign the order for her execution, and at last\r\npunished the clerks who sent it off, as if it had been their fault.\r\n\r\nSo Queen Mary of Scotland was beheaded at Fotheringay Castle, showing\r\nmuch bravery and piety.  There are many people who still believe that\r\nshe was really innocent of all that she was accused of, and that she\r\nonly was ruined by the plots that were laid against her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH\'S REIGN.  A.D. 1587--1602.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo reign ever was more glorious or better for the people than Queen\r\nElizabeth\'s.  It was a time when there were many very great men living\r\n--soldiers, sailors, writers, poets--and they all loved and look up to\r\nthe queen as the mother of her country.  There really was nothing she\r\ndid love like the good of her people, and somehow they all felt and\r\nknew it, and "Good Queen Bess" had their hearts--though she was not\r\nalways right, and had some serious faults.\r\n\r\nThe worst of her faults was not telling the truth.  Somehow kings and\r\nrulers had, at that time, learnt to believe that when they were dealing\r\nwith other countries anything was fair, and that it was not wrong to\r\ntell falsehoods to hide a secret, nor to make promises they never meant\r\nto keep.  People used to do so who would never have told a lie on their\r\nown account to their neighbor, and Lord Burleigh and Queen Elizabeth\r\ndid so very often, and often behaved meanly and shabbily to people who\r\nhad trusted to their promises.  Her other fault was vanity.  She was\r\na little woman, with bright eyes, and rather hooked nose, and sandy\r\nhair, but she managed to look every inch a queen, and her eye, when\r\ndispleased, was like a lion\'s.  She had really been in love with Lord\r\nLeicester, and every now and then he hoped she would marry him; indeed,\r\nthere is reason to fear that he had his wife secretly killed, in order\r\nthat he might be able to wed the queen; but she saw that the people\r\nwould not allow her to do so, and gave it up.  But she liked to be\r\ncourted.  She allowed foreign princes to send her their portraits,\r\nrings, and jewels, and sometimes to come and see her, but she never\r\nmade up her mind to take them.  And as to the gentlemen at her own\r\ncourt, she liked them to make the most absurd and ridiculous\r\ncompliments to her, calling her their sun and goddess, and her hair\r\ngolden beams of the morning, and the like; and the older she grew the\r\nmore of these fine speeches she required of them.  Her dress--a huge\r\nhoop, a tall ruff all over lace, and jewels in the utmost profusion--\r\nwas as splendid as it could be made, and in wonderful variety.  She is\r\nsaid to have had three hundred gowns and thirty wigs.  Lord Burleigh\r\nsaid of her that she was sometimes more than a man, and sometimes less\r\nthan a woman.  And so she was, when she did not like her ladies to\r\nwear handsome dresses.\r\n\r\nOne of the people who had wanted to marry her was her brother-in-law,\r\nPhilip of Spain, but she was far too wise, and he and she were bitter\r\nenemies all the rest of their lives.  His subjects in Holland had\r\nbecome Protestants, and he persecuted them so harshly that they broke\r\naway from him.  They wanted Elizabeth to be their queen, but she would\r\nnot, though she sent Lord Leicester to help them with an army.  With\r\nhim went his nephew, Sir Philip Sydney, the most good, and learned,\r\nand graceful gentleman at court.  There was great grief when Sir\r\nPhilip was struck by a cannon ball in the thigh, and died after nine\r\ndays pain.  It was as he was being carried from the field, faint and\r\nthirsty, that some one had just brought him a cup of water, when he\r\nsaw a poor soldier, worse hurt than himself, looking at it with longing\r\neyes.  He put it from him untasted, and said, "Take it, thy necessity\r\nis greater than mine."\r\n\r\nAfter the execution of Mary of Scotland, Philip of Spain resolved to\r\npunish Elizabeth and the English, and force them back to obedience to\r\nthe pope.  He fitted out an immense fleet, and filled it with fighting\r\nmen.  So strong was it that, as armada is the Spanish for a fleet, it\r\nwas called the Invincible Armada.  It sailed for England, the men\r\nexpecting to burn and ruin all before them.  But the English ships\r\nwere ready.  Little as they were, they hunted and tormented the big\r\nSpaniards all the way up the English Channel; and, just as the Armada\r\nhad passed the Straits of Dover, there came on such dreadful storms\r\nthat the ships were driven and broken before it, and wrecked all round\r\nthe coasts--even in Scotland and Ireland--and very few ever reached\r\nhome again.  The English felt that God had protected them with His\r\nwind and storm, and had fought for them.\r\n\r\nLord Leicester died not long after, and the queen became almost equally\r\nfond of his stepson, the Earl of Essex, who was a brave, high-spirited\r\nyoung man, only too proud.\r\n\r\nThe sailors of Queen Elizabeth\'s time were some of the bravest and\r\nmost skilful that ever lived.  Sir Francis Drake sailed round the\r\nworld in the good ship Pelican, and when he brought her into the\r\nThames the queen went to look at her.  Sir Walter Raleigh was another\r\ngreat sailor, and a most courtly gentleman besides.  He took out the\r\nfirst English settlers to North America, and named their new home\r\nVirginia--after the virgin queen--and he brought home from South\r\nAmerica our good friend the potato root; and, also he learnt their\r\nto smoke tobacco.  The first time his servant saw this done in\r\nEngland, he thought his master must be on fire, and threw a bucket\r\nof water over him to put it out.\r\n\r\nThe queen valued these brave men much, but she liked none so well as\r\nLord Essex, till at last he displeased her, and she sent him to govern\r\nIreland.  There he fell into difficulties, and she wrote angry letters,\r\nwhich made him think his enemies were setting her against him.  So he\r\ncame back without leave; and one morning came straight into her\r\ndressing chamber, where she was sitting, with her thin grey hair being\r\ncombed, before she put on one of her thirty wigs, or painted her face.\r\nShe was very angry, and would not forgive him, and he got into a rage,\r\ntoo; and she heard he had said she was an old woman, crooked in temper\r\nas in person.  What was far worse, he raised the Londoners to break\r\nout in a tumult to uphold him.  He  was taken and sent to the Tower,\r\ntried for treason, and found guilty of death.  But the queen still\r\nloved him, and waited and waited for some message or token to ask her\r\npardon.  None came, and she thought he was too proud to beg for mercy.\r\nShe signed the death warrant, and Essex died on the block.  But soon\r\nshe found that he had really sent a ring she once had given him, to a\r\nlady who was to show it to her, in token that he craved her pardon.\r\nThe ring had been taken by mistake to a cruel lady who hated him, and\r\nkept it back.  But by-and-by this lady was sick to death.  Then she\r\nrepented, and sent for the queen and gave her the ring, and confessed\r\nher wickedness.  Poor Queen Elizabeth--her very heart was broken.  She\r\nsaid to the dying woman, "God may forgive you, but I cannot."  She\r\nsaid little more after that.  She was old, and her strength failed\r\nher.  Day after day she sat on a pile of cushions, with her finger\r\non her lips, still growing weaker, and begging for the prayers the\r\narchbishop read her.  And thus, she who had once been so great and\r\nspirited, sank into death, when seventy years old, in the year 1602.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nJAMES I.  A.D. 1602--1625.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Queen Elizabeth\'s death, the next heir was James, the son of\r\nMary of Scotland, and had reigned there ever since his mother had been\r\ndriven away.  He had been brought up very strictly by the Scottish\r\nReformers, who had made him very learned, and kept him under great\r\nrestraint; and all that he had undergone had tended to make him\r\nawkward and strange in his manners.  He was timid, and could not bear\r\nto see a drawn sword; and he was so much afraid of being murdered,\r\nthat he used to wear a dress padded and stuffed out all over with\r\nwool, which made him look even more clumsy than he was by nature.\r\n\r\nThe English did not much admire their new king, though it really was\r\na great blessing that England and Scotland should be under the same\r\nking at last, so as to end all the long and bloody wars that had gone\r\non for so many years.  Still, the Puritans thought that, as James had\r\nbeen brought up in their way of thinking, they would be allowed to\r\nmake all the changes that Queen Elizabeth had stopped; and the Roman\r\nCatholics recollected that he was Queen Mary\'s son, and that his\r\nReformed tutors had not made his life very pleasant to him as a boy,\r\nso they had hopes from him.\r\n\r\nBut they both were wrong.  James had really read and thought much, and\r\nwas a much wiser man at the bottom than anyone would have thought who\r\nhad seen his disagreeable ways, and heard his silly way of talking.\r\nHe thought the English Church was much more in the right than either\r\nof them, and he only wished that things should go on the same in\r\nEngland, and that the Scots should be brought to have bishops, and\r\nto use the prayers that Christians had used from the very old times,\r\ninstead of each minister praying out of his own head, as had become\r\nthe custom.  But though he could not change the ways of the Scots at\r\nonce, he caused all the best scholars and clergymen in his kingdom to\r\ngo to work to make the translation of the Bible as right and good as\r\nit could be.\r\n\r\nLong before this was finished, however, some of the Roman Catholics\r\nhad formed a conspiracy for getting rid of all the chief people in\r\nthe kingdom; and so, as they hoped, bringing the rest back to the\r\npope.  There were good men among the Roman Catholics who knew such\r\nan act would be horrible; but there were some among them who had\r\nlearnt to hate everyone that they did not reckon as of the right\r\nreligion, and to believe that everything was right that was done for\r\nthe cause of their Church.  So these men agreed that on the day of\r\nthe meeting of Parliament, when the king, with the queen and Prince\r\nof Wales, would all be meeting the lords and commons, they would blow\r\nthe whole of them up with gunpowder; and, while the country was all\r\nin confusion, the king dead, and almost all his lords and the chief\r\ncountry squires, they would take the king\'s younger children--Elizabeth\r\nor Charles, who were both quite little--and bring one up as a Roman\r\nCatholic to govern England.\r\n\r\nThey hired some cellars under the Houses of Parliament, and stored\r\nthem with barrels of gunpowder, hidden by faggots; and the time was\r\nnearly come, when one of the lords called Monteagle, received a letter\r\nthat puzzled him very much, advising him not to attend the meeting of\r\nParliament, since a sudden destruction, would come upon all who would\r\nthere be present, and yet so that they would not know the doer of it.\r\nNo one knows who wrote the letter, but most likely it was one of the\r\ngentlemen who had been asked to join in the plot, and, though he would\r\nnot betray his friends, could not bear that Lord Monteagle should\r\nperish.  Lord Monteagle took the letter to the council, and there,\r\nafter puzzling over it and wondering if it were a joke, the king said\r\ngunpowder was a means of sudden destruction; and it was agreed that,\r\nat any rate, it would be safer to look into the vaults.  A party was\r\nsent to search, and there they found all the powder ready prepared,\r\nand, moreover, a man with a lantern, one Guy Fawkes, who had undertaken\r\nto be the one to set fire to the train of gunpowder, hoping to escape\r\nbefore the explosion.  However he was seized in time, and was forced\r\nto make confession.  Most of the gentlemen concerned fled into the\r\ncountry, and shut themselves up in a fortified house; but there,\r\nstrange to say, a barrel of gunpowder chanced to get lighted, and\r\nthus many were much hurt in the very way that meant to hurt others.\r\n\r\nThere was a great thanksgiving all over the country, and it became the\r\ncustom that, on the 5th of November--the day when the gunpowder plot\r\nwas to have taken effect--there should be bonfires and fireworks, and\r\nGuy Fawkes\' figure burnt, but people are getting wiser now, and think\r\nit better not to keep up the memory old crimes and hatreds.\r\n\r\nHenry, Prince of Wales, was a fine lad, fond of all that was good,\r\nbut a little too apt to talk of wars, and of being like Henry V.\r\nHe was very fond of ships and  sailors, and delighted in watching\r\nthe building of a grand vessel that was to take his sister Elizabeth\r\nacross the sea, when she was to marry the Count Palatine of the Rhine.\r\nBefore the wedding, however, Prince Henry fell suddenly ill and died.\r\n\r\nKing James was a fond of favorites as ever Elizabeth had been, though\r\nnot of the same persons.  One of the worst things he ever did was the\r\nkeeping Sir Walter Raleigh in the Tower for many years, and a last\r\ncutting off his head.  It was asserted that Sir Walter had tried, when\r\nfirst James came, to set up a lady named Arabella Stuart to be queen;\r\nbut if he was to be punished for that, it ought to have been directly,\r\ninstead of keeping the sentence hanging over his head for years.  The\r\ntruth was that Sir Walter had been a great enemy to the Spaniards, and\r\nJames wanted to please them, for he wished his son Charles to marry the\r\ndaughter of the King of Spain.  Charles wanted to see her first, and\r\nset off for Spain, in disguise, with the Duke of Buckingham, who was\r\nhis friend, and his father\'s greatest favorite.  But when reached he\r\nMadrid, he found that the princesses were not allowed to speak to any\r\ngentleman, nor to show their faces; and though he climbed over a wall\r\nto speak to her when she was walking in the garden, an attendant\r\nbegged him to go away, or all her train would be punished.  Charles\r\nwent back disappointed, and, on his way through Paris, saw Henrietta\r\nMaria, the bright-eyed sister of the King of France, and set his heart\r\non marrying her.\r\n\r\nBefore this was settled, however, King James was seized with an ague\r\nand died, in the year 1625.  He was the first king of the family of\r\nStuart, and a very strange person he was--wonderfully learned and\r\nexceedingly conceited; indeed, he like nothing better than to be\r\ncalled the English Solomon.  The worst of him was that, like\r\nElizabeth, he thought kings and rulers might tell falsehoods and\r\ndeceive.  He called this kingcraft, and took this very bad sort of\r\ncunning for wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nCHARLES I.  A.D. 1625--1649.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo many of the great nobles had been killed in the Wars of the Roses,\r\nthat the barons had lost all that great strength and power they had\r\ngained when they made King John sign Magna Carta.  The kings got the\r\npower instead; and all through the reigns of the five Tudors, the\r\nsovereign had very little to hinder him from doing exactly as he\r\npleased.  But, in the meantime, the country squires and the great\r\nmerchants who sat in the House of Commons had been getting richer\r\nand stronger, and read and thought more.  As long as Queen Elizabeth\r\nlived they were contented, for they loved her and were proud of her,\r\nand she knew how to manage them.  She scolded them sometimes, but\r\nwhen she saw that she was really vexing them she always changed, and\r\nshe had smiles and good words for them, so that she could really do\r\nwhat she pleased with them.\r\n\r\nBut James I. was a disagreeable man to have to do with; and, instead\r\nof trying to please them, he talked a great deal about his own power\r\nas king, and how they ought to obey him; so that they were angered,\r\nand began to read the laws, and wonder how much power properly\r\nbelonged to him.  Now, when he died, his son Charles was a much\r\npleasanter person; he was a gentleman in all his looks and ways,\r\nand had none of his father\'s awkward, ungainly tricks and habits.\r\nHe was good and earnest, too, and there was nothing to take offence\r\nat in himself; so for some years all went on quietly, and there seemed\r\nto be a great improvement.  But several things were against him.  His\r\nfriend, the Duke of Buckingham, was a proud, selfish man, who affronted\r\nalmost everyone, and made a bad use of the king\'s favor; and the\r\npeople were also vexed that the king should marry a Roman Catholic\r\nprincess, Henrietta Maria, who would not go to church with him, nor\r\neven let herself be crowned by an English archbishop.\r\n\r\nYou heard that, in Queen Elizabeth\'s time, there were Puritans who\r\nwould have liked to have the Prayer-book much more altered, and who\r\nfancied that every pious rule of old times must be wrong.  They did\r\nnot like the cross in baptism, nor the ring in marriage; and they\r\ncould not bear to see a clergyman in a surplice.  In many churches\r\nthey took their own way, and did just as they pleased.  But under\r\nJames and Charles matters changed.  Dr. Laud, whom Charles had made\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, had all the churches visited, and insisted\r\non the parishioners setting them in order; and if a clergyman would\r\nnot wear a surplice, not make a cross on the baptized child\'s\r\nforehead, nor obey the other laws of the Prayer-book, he was punished.\r\n\r\nThe Puritans were greatly displeased.  They fancied the king and Dr.\r\nLaud wanted to make them all Roman Catholics again; and a great many\r\nso hated these Church rules, that they took ship and went off to\r\nNorth America to found a colony, where they might set up their own\r\nreligion as they liked it.  Those who staid continued to murmur and\r\nstruggle against Laud.\r\n\r\nThere was another great matter of displeasure, and that was the way in\r\nwhich the king raised money.  The right way is that he should call his\r\nParliament together, and the House of Commons should grant him what he\r\nwanted.  But there were other means.  One was that every place in\r\nEngland should be called on to pay so much for ship money.  This had\r\nbegun when King Alfred raised his fleet to keep off the Danes; but\r\nit had come not to be spent on ships at all, but only be money for\r\nthe king to use.  Another way that the kings had of getting money\r\nwas from fines.  People who committed some small offence, that did\r\nnot come under the regular laws, were brought before the Council in\r\na room at Westminster, that had a ceiling painted with stars--and so\r\nwas called the Star Chamber--and there were sentenced, sometimes to\r\npay heavy sums of money, sometimes to have their ears cut off.  This\r\nCourt of the Star Chamber had been begun in the days of Henry VII.,\r\nand it is only a wonder that the English had borne it so long.\r\n\r\nOne thing Charles I. did that pleased his people, and that was sending\r\nhelp to the French Protestants, who were having their town of Rochelle\r\nbesieged.  But the English were not pleased that the command of the\r\narmy was given to the duke of Buckingham, his proud, insolent favorite.\r\nbut Buckingham never went.  As he was going to embark at Portsmouth,\r\nhe was stabbed to the heart by a man named Felton; nobody clearly\r\nknows why.\r\n\r\nCharles did not get on much better even when Buckingham was dead.\r\nWhenever he called a Parliament, fault was always found with him and\r\nwith the laws.  Then he tried to do without a Parliament; and, as he,\r\nof course, needed money, the calls for ship money came oftener, and\r\nthe fines in the Star Chamber became heavier, and more cases for\r\nthem were hunted out.  Then murmurs arose.  Just then, too, he and\r\nArchbishop Laud were trying to make the Scots return to the Church,\r\nby giving them bishops and a Prayer-book.  But the first time the\r\nService was read in a church at Edinburgh, a fishwoman, named Jenny\r\nGeddes, jumped up in a rage and threw a three-legged stool at the\r\nclergyman\'s head.  Some Scots fancied they were being brought back\r\nto Rome; others hated whatever was commanded in England.  All these\r\nleagued together, and raised an army to resist the king; and he was\r\nobliged to call a Parliament once more, to get money enough to resist\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE LONG PARLIAMENT.  A.D. 1641--1649.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Charles I. was obliged to call his Parliament, the House of\r\nCommons met, angered at the length of time that had passed since\r\nthey had been called, and determined to use their opportunity.  They\r\nspeedily put an end both to the payment of ship money and to the Court\r\nof the Star Chamber; and they threw into prison the two among the\r\nking\'s friends whom they most disliked, namely, Archbishop Laud and\r\nthe Earl of Strafford.  The earl had been governor of Ireland, and\r\nhad kept great order there, but severely; and he thought that the\r\nking was the only person who ought to have any power, and was always\r\nadvising the king to put down all resistance by the strong hand.\r\nHe was thought a hard man, and very much hated; and when he was tried\r\nthe Houses of Parliament gave sentence against him that he should be\r\nbeheaded.  Still, this could not be done without the king\'s warrant;\r\nand Charles at first stood out against giving up his faithful friend.\r\nBut there was a great tumult, and the queen and her mother grew\r\nfrightened, and entreated the king to save himself by giving up Lord\r\nStrafford, until at last he consented, and signed the paper ordering\r\nthe execution.  It was a sad act of weakness and cowardice, and he\r\nmourned over it all the days of his life.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament only asked more and more, and at last the king thought\r\nhe must put a check on them.  So he resolved to go down to the House\r\nand cause the five members who spoke against his power to be taken\r\nprisoners in his own presence.  But he told his wife what he intended,\r\nand Henrietta Maria was so foolish as to tell Lady Carlisle, one of\r\nher ladies, and she sent warning to the five gentlemen, so that they\r\nwere not in the House when Charles arrived; and the Londoners rose up\r\nin a great mob, and showed themselves so angry with him, that he took\r\nthe queen and his children away into the country.  The queen took her\r\ndaughter Mary to Holland to marry the Prince of Orange; and there she\r\nbought muskets and gunpowder for her husband\'s army--for things had\r\ncome to pass now that a civil war began.  A civil war is the worst\r\nof all wars, for it is one between the people of the same country.\r\nEngland had had two civil wars before.  There were the Barons\' wars,\r\nbetween Henry III. and Simon de Montfort, about the keeping of Magna\r\nCarta; and there were the wars of the Roses, to settle whether York\r\nor Lancaster should reign.  This war between Charles I. and the\r\nParliament was to decide whether the king or the House of Commons\r\nshould be most powerful.  Those who held with the king called\r\nthemselves Cavaliers, but the friends of the Parliament called them\r\nMalignants; and they in turn nicknamed the Parliamentary party\r\nRoundheads, because they often chose not to wear their hair in the\r\nprevailing fashion, long and flowing on their shoulders, but cut\r\nshort round their heads.  Most of the Roundheads were Puritans, and\r\nhated the Prayer-book, and all the strict rules for religious worship\r\nthat Archbishop Laud had brought in; and the Cavaliers, on the other\r\nhand, held by the bishops and the Prayer-book.  Some of the Cavaliers\r\nwere very good men indeed, and led holy and Christian lives, like\r\ntheir master the king, but there were others who were only bold,\r\ndashing men, careless and full of mirth and mischief; and the\r\nPuritans were apt to think all amusements and pleasures wrong,\r\nso that they made out the Cavaliers worse than they really were.\r\n\r\nI do not think you would understand about all the battles, so I shall\r\nonly tell you now that the king\'s army was chiefly led by his nephew,\r\nPrince Rupert, the son of his sister Elizabeth.  Rupert was a fiery,\r\nbrave young man, who was apt to think a battle was won before it\r\nreally was, and would ride after the people he had beaten himself\r\nwithout waiting to see whether his help was wanted by the other\r\ncaptains; and so he did his uncle\'s cause as much harm as good.\r\n\r\nThe king\'s party had been the  most used to war, and they prospered\r\nthe most at first; but as the soldiers of the Parliament became more\r\ntrained, they gained the advantage.  One of the members of Parliament,\r\na gentleman named Oliver Cromwell, soon showed himself to be a much\r\nbetter captain than any one else in England, and from the time he came\r\nto the chief command the Parliament always had the victory.  The places\r\nof the three chief battles were Edgehill, Marston Moor, and Naseby.\r\nThe first was doubtful, but the other two were great victories of the\r\nRoundheads.  Just after Marston Moor, the Parliament put to death\r\nArchbishop Laud; and, at the same time, they forbade the use of the\r\nPrayer-book, and turned out all the parish priests from the churches,\r\nputting in their stead men chosen after their own fashion, and not\r\nordained by bishops.  They likewise destroyed all they disliked in the\r\nchurches--the painted glass, the organs, and the carvings; and when\r\nthe Puritan soldiers took possession of a town or village, they would\r\nstable their horses in the churches, use the font for a trough, and\r\nshoot at the windows as marks.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Naseby, King Charles was in such distress that he\r\nthought he would go to the Scots, remembering that, though he had\r\noffended them by trying to make them use the Prayer-book, he had been\r\nborn among them, and he thought they would prefer him to the English.\r\nBut when he came, the Scottish army treated him like a prisoner, and\r\nshowed him very few honors; and at last they gave him up to the\r\nEnglish Parliament for a great sum of money.\r\n\r\nSo Charles was a prisoner to his own subjects.  This Parliament is\r\ncalled the Long Parliament, because it sat longer than any other\r\nParliament ever did: indeed it had passed a resolution that it could\r\nnot be dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF CHARLES I.  A.D. 1649--1651.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Long Parliament did not wish to have no king, only to make him do\r\nwhat they pleased; and then went on trying whether he would come back\r\nto reign according to their notions.  He would have given up a great\r\ndeal, but when they wanted him to declare that there should be no\r\nbishops in England he would never consent, for he thought there could\r\nbe no real Church without bishops, as our Lord himself had appointed.\r\n\r\nAt last, after there had been much debating, and it was plain that it\r\nwould never come to an end, Oliver Cromwell sent some of his officers\r\nto take King Charles into their hands, instead of the persons appointed\r\nby Parliament.  So the king was prisoner to the army instead of to the\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\nCromwell was a very able man, and he saw that nobody could settle the\r\ndifficulties about the law and the rights of the people but himself.\r\nHe saw that things never would be settled while the king lived, nor\r\nby the Parliament, so he sent one of his officers, named Pryde, to\r\nturnout all the members of Parliament who would not do his will, and\r\nthen the fifty who were left appointed a court of officers and lawyers\r\nto try the king.  Charles was brought before them; but, as they had\r\nno right to try him, he would not say a word in answer to them.\r\nNevertheless, they sentenced him to have his head cut off.  He had\r\nborne all his troubles in the most meek and patient way, forgiving\r\nall his enemies and praying for them: and he was ready to die in the\r\nsame temper.  His queen was in France, and all his children were safe\r\nout of England, except his daughter Elizabeth, who was twelve years\r\nold, and little Henry, who was five.  They were brought to Whitehall\r\nPalace for him to see the night before he was to die.  He took the\r\nlittle boy on his knee, and talked a long time to Elizabeth, telling\r\nher what books to read and giving her his message to her mother and\r\nbrothers; and then he told little Henry to mark what he said, and to\r\nmind that he must never be set up as a king while his elder brothers,\r\nCharles and James were alive.  The little boy said through his tears,\r\n"I will be torn to pieces first."  His father kissed and blessed the\r\ntwo children, and left them.\r\n\r\nThe next day was the 30th of January, 1649.  The king was allowed to\r\nhave Bishop Juxon to read and pray with him, and to give him the holy\r\ncommunion.  After that, forgiving his enemies and praying for them,\r\nhe was led to the Banqueting House at Whitehall, and out through a\r\nwindow, on to the scaffold hung with black cloth.  He said his last\r\nprayers, and the executioner cut off his head with one blow, and held\r\nit up to the people.  He was buried at night,--a light snow falling\r\nat the time,--in St. George\'s Chapel at Windsor, by four faithful\r\nnoblemen, but they were not allowed to use any service over his grave.\r\n\r\nThe Scots were so much shocked to find what their selling of their\r\nking had come to, that they invited his eldest son, Charles, a young\r\nman of nineteen, to come and reign over them, and offered to set him\r\non the English throne again.  Young Charles came; but they were so\r\nstrict that they made his life very dull and weary, since they saw\r\nsin in every amusement.  However, they kept their promise of marching\r\ninto England, and some of the English cavaliers joined them; but Oliver\r\nCromwell and his army met them at Worcester, and they were entirely\r\nbeaten.  Young King Charles had to go away with a few gentlemen, and\r\nhe was so closely followed that they had to put him in charge of some\r\nwoodmen named Penderel, who lived in Boscobel Forest.  They dressed\r\nhim in a rough leather suit like their own, and when the Roundhead\r\nsoldiers came to search, he was hidden among the branches of an oak\r\ntree above their heads.  Afterwards, a lady named Jane Lane helped\r\nhim over another part of his journey, by letting him ride on horseback\r\nbefore her as her servant; but, when she stopped at an inn, he was\r\nvery near being found out, because he did not know how to turn the\r\nspit in the kitchen when the cook asked him.  However, he got safely\r\nto Brighton, which was only a little village then, and a boat took\r\nhim to France, where his  mother was living.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, his young sister and brother, Elizabeth and Henry,\r\nhad been sent to the Isle of Wight, to Carisbrook Castle.  Elizabeth\r\nwas pining away with sorrow, and before long she was found dead, with\r\nher cheek resting on her open Bible.  After this, little Henry was\r\nsent to be with his mother in France.\r\n\r\nThe eldest daughter, Mary, had been married just as the war began to\r\nthe Prince of Orange, who lived in Holland, and was left a widow with\r\none little son.  James, Duke of York, the second brother, had at first\r\nbeen in the keeping of a Parliamentary nobleman, with his brother and\r\nsister, in London; but, during a game of hide-and-seek, he crept out\r\nof the gardens and met some friends, who dressed him in girls\' clothes\r\nand took him to a ship in the Thames, which carried him to Holland.\r\nLittle Henrietta, the youngest, had been left, when only six weeks\r\nold, to the care of one of her mother\'s ladies.  When she was nearly\r\nthree, the lady did not think it safe to keep her any longer in\r\nEngland.  So she stained her face and hands brown with walnut juice,\r\nto look like a gipsy, took the child upon her back, and trudged to\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nLittle Henrietta could not speak plain, but she always called herself\r\nby a name she meant to be princess, and the lady was obliged to call\r\nher Piers, and pretend that she was a little boy, when the poor child\r\ngrew angry at being treated so differently from usual, and did all she\r\npossibly could to make the strangers understand that she was no beggar\r\nboy.  However, at last she was safe across the sea, and was with her\r\nmother at Paris, where the king of France, Queen Henrietta\'s nephew,\r\nwas very kind to the poor exiles.  The misfortune was, that the queen\r\nbrought up little Henrietta as a Roman Catholic, and tried to make\r\nHenry one also; but he was old enough to be firm to his father\'s\r\nChurch, and he went away to his sister in Holland.  James, however\r\ndid somewhat late become a Roman Catholic; and Charles would have\r\nbeen one, if he had cared enough about religion to do what would have\r\nlessened his chance of getting back to England as king.  But these two\r\nbrothers were learning no good at Paris, and were growing careless of\r\nthe right and fond of pleasure.  James and Henry, after a time, joined\r\nthe French army, that they might learn the art of war.  They were both\r\nvery brave, but it was sad that when France and England went to war,\r\nthey should be in the army of the enemies of their country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nOLIVER CROMWELL.  A.D. 1649--1660.\r\n\r\n\r\nOliver Cromwell felt, as has been said, that there was no one who\r\ncould set matters to rights as he could in England.  He had shewn\r\nthat the country could not do without him, if it was to go on without\r\nthe old government.  Not only had he conquered and slain Charles I.,\r\nand beaten that king\'s friends and those of his son in Scotland, but\r\nhe had put down a terrible rising of the Irish, and suppressed them\r\nwith much more cruelty than he generally showed.\r\n\r\nHe found that the old Long Parliament did nothing but blunder and talk,\r\nso he marched into the House one day with a company of soldiers, and\r\nsternly ordered the members all off, calling out, as he pointed to the\r\nmace that lay before the Speaker\'s chair, "Take away that bauble."\r\nAfter that he called together a fresh Parliament; but there were very\r\nfew members, and those only men who would do as he bade them.  The\r\nSpeaker was a leather-seller named Barebones, so that this is generally\r\nknown as Barebones\' Parliament.  By these people he was named Lord\r\nProtector of England; and as his soldiers would still do anything for\r\nhim, he reigned for five years, just as a king might have done, and a\r\ngood king too.\r\n\r\nHe was by no means a cruel or unmerciful man, and he did not persecute\r\nthe Cavaliers more than he could help, if he was to keep up his power;\r\nthough, of course, they suffered a great deal, since they had fines\r\nlaid upon them, and some forfeited their estates for having resisted\r\nthe Parliament.  Many had to live in Holland or France, because there\r\nwas no safety for them in England, and their wives went backwards and\r\nforwards to their homes to collect their rents, and obtain something\r\nto live upon.  The bishops and clergy had all been driven out, and in\r\nno church was it allowable to use the Prayer-book; so there used to\r\nbe secret meetings in rooms, or vaults, or in woods, where the prayers\r\ncould be used as of old, and the holy sacrament administered.\r\n\r\nFor five years Cromwell was Lord Protector, but in the year 1658 he\r\ndied, advising that his son Richard should be chosen Protector in his\r\nstead.  Richard Cromwell was a kind, amiable gentleman, but not clever\r\nor strong like his father, and he very soon found that to govern\r\nEngland was quite beyond his power; so he gave up, and went to live\r\nat his own home again, while the English people gave him the nick-name\r\nTumble-down-Dick.\r\n\r\nNo one seemed well to know what was to be done next; but General Monk,\r\nwho was now at the head of the army, thought the best thing possible\r\nwould be to bring back the king.  A new Parliament was elected, and\r\nsent an invitation to Charles II. to come back again and reign like\r\nhis forefathers.  He accepted it; the fleet was sent to fetch him, and\r\non the 29th of May, 1660, he rode into London between his brothers,\r\nJames and Henry.  The streets were dressed with green boughs, the\r\nwindows hung with tapestry, and everyone shewed such intense joy and\r\ndelight, the king said he could not think why he should have\r\nstayed away so long, since everyone was so glad to see him back again.\r\n\r\nBut the joy of his return was clouded by the deaths of his sister\r\nMary, the Princess of Orange, and of his brother Henry, who was only\r\njust twenty.  Mary left a son, William, Prince of Orange, of whom you\r\nwill hear more.\r\n\r\nThe bishops were restored, and, as there had been no archbishop since\r\nLaud had been beheaded, good Juxon, who had attended King Charles at\r\nhis death, was made archbishop in his room.  The persons who had been\r\nput into the parishes to act as clergymen, were obliged to give place\r\nto the real original parish priest; but if he were dead, as was often\r\nthe case, they were told that they might stay, if they would be\r\nordained by the bishops and obey the Prayer-book.  Some did so, some\r\nmade an arrangement for keeping the parsonages, and paying a curate\r\nto take the service in church; but those who were the most really in\r\nearnest gave up everything, and were turned out--but only as they had\r\nturned out the former clergymen ten or twelve years before.\r\n\r\nAll Oliver Cromwell\'s army was broken up, and the men sent to their\r\nhomes, except one regiment which came from Coldstream in Scotland.\r\nThese would not disband, and when Charles II. heard it he said he\r\nwould take them as his guards.  This was the beginning of there\r\nbeing always a regular army of men, whose whole business it is to\r\nbe soldiers, instead of any man being called from his work when he\r\nis wanted.\r\n\r\nCharles II. promised pardon to all the rebels, but he did try and\r\nexecute all who had been actually concerned in condemning his father\r\nto death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nCHARLES II.  A.D. 1660-1685.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is sad to have to say that, after all his troubles, Charles II.\r\ndisappointed everybody.  Some of these disappointments could not be\r\nhelped, but others were his own fault.  The Puritan party thought,\r\nafter they had brought him home again he should have been more\r\nfavorable to them, and grumbled at the restoration of the clergymen\r\nand of the Prayer-book.  The Cavaliers thought that, after all they\r\nhad gone through for him and his father, he ought to have rewarded\r\nthem more; but he said truly enough, that if he had made a nobleman\r\nof everyone who had deserved well of him, no place but Salisbury Plain\r\nwould have been big enough for the House of Lords to meet upon.  Then\r\nthose gentlemen who had got into debt to raise soldiers for the king\'s\r\nservice, and had paid fines, or had to sell their estates, felt it\r\nhard not to have them again; but when a Roundhead gentleman had\r\nhonestly bought the property, it would have been still more unjust\r\nto turn them out.  These two old names of Cavaliers and Roundheads\r\nbegan to turn into two others even more absurd.  The Cavalier set\r\ncame to be called Tories, an Irish name for a robber, and the Puritans\r\ngot the Scotch name of Whigs, which means buttermilk.\r\n\r\nIt would have taken a very strong, wise, and good man to deal rightly\r\nwith two such different sets of people; but though Charles II. was a\r\nvery clever man, he was neither wise nor good.  He could not bear to\r\nvex himself, nor anybody else; and, rather than be teased, would grant\r\nalmost anything that was asked of him.  He was so bright and lively,\r\nand made such droll, good-natured answers, that everyone liked him who\r\ncame near him; but he had no steady principle, only to stand easy with\r\neverybody, and keep as much power for himself as he could without giving\r\noffence.  He loved pleasure much better than duty, and kept about him\r\na set of people who amused him, but were a disgrace to his court.\r\nThey even took money from the French king to persuade Charles against\r\nhelping the Dutch in their war against the French.  The Dutch went to\r\nwar with the English upon this, and there were many terrible sea-\r\nfights, in which James, Duke of York, the king\'s brother, shewed\r\nhimself a good and brave sailor.\r\n\r\nThe year 1665 is remembered as that in which there was a dreadful\r\nsickness in London, called the plague.  People died of it often after\r\na very short illness, and it was so infectious that it was difficult\r\nto escape it.  When a person in a house was found to have it, the door\r\nwas fastened up and marked with a red cross in chalk, and no one was\r\nallowed to go out or in; food was set down outside to be fetched in,\r\nand carts came round to take away the dead, who were all buried\r\ntogether in long ditches.  The plague was worst in the summer and\r\nautumn; as winter came on more recovered and fewer sickened, and\r\nat last this frightful sickness was ended; and by God\'s good mercy,\r\nit has never since that year come to London.\r\n\r\nThe next year 1666, there was a fire in London, which burnt down whole\r\nstreets, with their churches, and even destroyed St. Paul\'s Cathedral.\r\nPerhaps it did good by burning down the dirty old houses and narrow\r\nstreets where the plague might have lingered, but it was a fearsome\r\nmisfortune.  It was only stopped at last by blowing up a space with\r\ngunpowder all round it, so that the flames might have no way to pass\r\non.  The king and his brother came and were very helpful in giving\r\norders about this, and in finding shelter for many poor, homeless\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of disturbance in Scotland when the king wanted\r\nto bring back the bishops and the Prayer-book.  Many of the Scots\r\nwould not go to church, and met on hills and moors to have their\r\nprayers in their own way.  Soldiers were sent to disperse them, and\r\nthere was much fierce, bitter feeling.  Archbishop Sharpe was dragged\r\nout of his carriage and killed, and then there was a civil war, in\r\nwhich the king\'s men prevailed; but the Whigs were harshly treated,\r\nand there was great discontent.\r\n\r\nThe country was much troubled because the king and queen had no\r\nchildren: and the Duke of York was a Roman Catholic.  A strange story\r\nwas got up that there was what was called a popish plot for killing\r\nthe king, and putting James on the throne.  Charles himself laughed at\r\nit, for he knew everyone liked him and disliked his brother: "No one\r\nwould kill me to make you king, James," he said; but in his easy,\r\nselfish way, when he found that all the country believed in it, and\r\nwanted to have the men they fancied guilty put to death, he did not\r\ntry to save their lives.\r\n\r\nSoon after this false plot, there was a real one called the Rye-house\r\nPlot.  Long ago, the king had pretended to marry a girl named Lucy\r\nWaters and they had a son whom he had made Duke of Monmouth, but who\r\ncould not reign because there had been no right marriage.  However,\r\nLord Russell and some other gentlemen, who ought to have know better,\r\nso hated the idea of the Duke of York being king, that they joined in\r\nthe Ryehouse Plot for killing the duke, and forcing the king to make\r\nMonmouth his heir.  Some of the more unprincipled sort, who had joined\r\nthem, even meant to shoot Charles and James together on the way to the\r\nNewmarket races.  However, the plot was found out, and the leaders\r\nwere put to death.  Lord Russell\'s wife, Lady Rachel, sat by him all\r\nthe time of his trial, and was his great comfort to the last.  Monmouth\r\nwas pardoned, but fled away into Holland.\r\n\r\nThe best thing to be said of Charles II. was that he made good men\r\nbishops, and he never was angry when they spoke out boldly about his\r\nwicked ways; but then, he never tried to leave them off, and he spent\r\nthe very last Sunday of his life among his bad companions, playing at\r\ncards and listening to idle songs.  Just after this came a stroke of\r\napoplexy, and, while he lay dying on his bed, he sent for a Roman\r\nCatholic priest, and was received into the Church of Rome, in which\r\nhe had really believed most of his life--though he had never dared to\r\nown it, for fear of losing his crown.  So, as he was living a lie, of\r\ncourse the fruits showed themselves in his selfish, wasted life.\r\n\r\nIt was in this reign that two grand books were written.  John Milton,\r\na blind scholar and poet, who, before he lost his sight, had been\r\nOliver Cromwell\'s secretary, wrote his Paradise Lost, or rather\r\ndictated it to his daughters; and John Bunyan, a tinker, who had\r\nbeen a Puritan preacher, wrote the Pilgrim\'s Progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nJAMES II.  A.D. 1685--1688.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames II. had, at least, been honest in openly joining the Church in\r\nwhich he believed; but the people disliked and distrusted him, and he\r\nhad not the graces of his brother to gain their hearts with, but was\r\ngrave, sad, and stern.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Monmouth came across from Holland, and was proclaimed king\r\nin his uncle\'s stead at Exeter.  Many people in the West of England\r\njoined him, and at Taunton, in Somersetshire, he was received by rows\r\nof little girls standing by the gate in white frocks, strewing flowers\r\nbefore him.  But at Sedgemoor he was met by the army, and his friends\r\nwere routed; he himself fled away, and at last was caught hiding in a\r\nditch, dressed in a laborer\'s smock frock, and with his pockets full\r\nof peas from the fields.  He was taken to London, tried, and executed.\r\nHe did not deserve much pity, but James ought not to have let the\r\npeople who favored him be cruelly treated.  Sir George Jeffreys, the\r\nchief justice, was sent to try all who had been concerned, from\r\nWinchester to Exeter; and he hung so many, and treated all so savagely,\r\nthat his progress was called the Bloody Assize.  Even the poor little\r\nmaids at Taunton were thrown into a horrible, dirty jail, and only\r\nreleased on their parents paying a heavy sum of money for them.\r\n\r\nThis was a bad beginning for James\'s reign; and the English grew more\r\nangry and suspicious when they saw that he favored Roman Catholics\r\nmore than anyone else, and even put them into places that only\r\nclergymen of the Church of England could fill.  Then he put forth a\r\ndecree, declaring that a person might be chosen to any office in the\r\nState, whether he were a member of the English Church or no; and he\r\ncommanded that every clergyman should read it from his pulpit on\r\nSunday mornings.  Archbishop Sancroft did not think it a right thing\r\nfor clergymen to read, and he and six more bishops presented a\r\npetition to the king against being obliged to read it.  One of these\r\nwas Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, who wrote the morning hymn,\r\n"Awake, my soul, and with the sun," and the evening hymn, "All praise\r\nto Thee, my God, this night."  Instead of listening to their petition,\r\nthe king had all the seven bishops sent to the Tower, and tried for\r\nlibel--that is, for malicious writing.  All England was full of\r\nanxiety, and when at last the jury gave the verdict of "not guilty,"\r\nthe whole of London rang with shouts of joy, and the soldiers in their\r\ncamp shouted still louder.\r\n\r\nThis might have been a warning to the king; for he thought that, as he\r\npaid the army, they were all on his side, and would make the people\r\nbear whatever he pleased.  The chief comfort people had was in thinking\r\ntheir troubles would only last during his reign: for his first wife,\r\nan Englishwoman, had only left him two daughters, Mary and Anne, and\r\nMary was married to her cousin William, Prince of Orange, who was a\r\ngreat enemy of the King of France and of the pope; and Anne\'s husband,\r\nPrince George, brother to the King of Denmark, was a Protestant.  He\r\nwas a dull man, and people laughed at him--because, whenever he heard\r\nany news, he never said anything but "_Est il possible?_" is it\r\npossible?  But he had a little son, of whom there was much hope.\r\n\r\nBut James had married again, Mary Beatrice d\'Este, an Italian princess;\r\nand, though none of her babies had lived before, at last she had a\r\nlittle son who was healthy and likely to live, and who was christened\r\nJames.  Poor little boy!  Everyone was so angry and disappointed that\r\nhe should have come into the world at all, that a story was put about\r\nthat he was not the son of the king and queen, but a strange baby who\r\nhad been carried into the queen\'s room in a warming-pan, because James\r\nwas resolved to prevent Mary and William from reigning.\r\n\r\nOnly silly people could believe such a story as this; but all the\r\nWhigs, and most of the Tories, thought in earnest that it was a sad\r\nthing for the country to have an heir to the throne brought up by a\r\nRoman Catholic, and to think it right to treat his subjects as James\r\nwas treating them.  Some would have been patient, and have believed\r\nthat God would bring it right, but others were resolved to put a stop\r\nto the evils they expected; and, knowing what was the state of people\'s\r\nminds, William of Orange set forth from Holland, and landed at Torbay.\r\nCrowds of people came to meet him, and to call on him.  It was only\r\nthree years since the Bloody Assize, and they had not forgotten it in\r\nthose parts.  King James heard that one person after another had gone\r\nto the Prince of Orange, and he thought it not safe for his wife and\r\nchild to be any longer in England.  So, quietly, one night he put them\r\nin charge of a French nobleman who had been visiting him, and who took\r\nthem to the Thames, where, after waiting in the dark under a church\r\nwall, he brought them a boat, and they reached a ship which took them\r\nsafely to France.\r\n\r\nKing James staid a little longer.  He did not mind when he heard that\r\nPrince George of Denmark had gone to the Prince of Orange, but only\r\nlaughed, and said "_Est il possible?_" but when he heard his daughter\r\nAnne, to whom he had always been kind, was gone too, the tears came\r\ninto his eyes, and he said, "God help me, my own children are deserting\r\nme."  He would have put himself at the head of the army, but he found\r\nthat if he did so he was likely to be made prisoner and carried to\r\nWilliam.  So he disguised himself and set off for France; but at\r\nFaversham, some people who took him for a Roman Catholic priest seized\r\nhim, and he was sent back to London.  However, as there was nothing\r\nthe Prince of Orange wished so little as to keep him in captivity, he\r\nwas allowed to escape again, and this time he safely reached France,\r\nwhere he was very kindly welcomed, and had the palace of St. Germain\r\ngiven him for a dwelling-place.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 4th of November, 1688, that William landed, and the\r\nchange that now took place is commonly called the English Revolution.\r\n\r\nWe must think of the gentlemen, during these reigns, as going about\r\nin very fine laced and ruffled coats, and the most enormous wigs.\r\nYou know the Roundheads had short hair and the Cavaliers long: so\r\npeople were ashamed to have short hair, and wore wigs to hide it if\r\nit would not grow, till everybody came to have shaven heads, and\r\nmonstrous wigs in great curls on their shoulders: and even little\r\nboys\' hair was made to look as like a wig as possible.  The barber\r\nhad the wig every morning to fresh curl, and make it white with hair\r\npowder, so that everyone might look like an old man, with a huge\r\nquantity of white hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM III. AND MARY II.  1689--1702.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen James II. proved to be entirely gone, the Parliament agreed to\r\noffer the crown to William of Orange--the next heir after James\'s\r\nchildren--and Mary, his wife, James\'s eldest daughter; but not until\r\nthere had been new conditions made, which would prevent the kings\r\nfrom ever being so powerful again as they had been since the time of\r\nHenry VII.  Remember, Magna Carta, under King John, gave the power\r\nto the nobles.  They lost it by the wars of the Roses, and the Tudor\r\nkings gained it; but the Stuart kings could not keep it, and the\r\nHouse of Commons became the strongest power in the kingdom, by the\r\nRevolution of 1688.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons is made up of persons chosen--whenever there is\r\na general election--by the men who have a certain amount of property\r\nin each county and large town.  There must be a fresh election, or\r\nchoosing again every seven years; also, whenever the sovereign dies;\r\nand the sovereign can dissolve the Parliament--that is, break it up--\r\nand have a fresh election whenever it is thought right.  But above the\r\nHouse of Commons stands the House of Lords, or Peers.  These are\r\nnot chosen, but the eldest son, or next heir of each lord, succeeds\r\nto his seat upon his death; and fresh peerages are given as rewards\r\nto great generals, great lawyers, or people who have deserved well of\r\ntheir country.  When a law has to be made, it has first to be agreed\r\nto by a majority--that is, the larger number--of the Commons, then by\r\na majority of the Lords, and lastly, by the king or queen.  The\r\nsovereign\'s council are called the ministers, and if the Houses of\r\nParliament do not approve of their way of carrying on the government\r\nthey vote against their proposals, and this generally makes them\r\nresign, that others may be chosen in their place who may please the\r\ncountry better.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement has gone on ever since William and Mary came in.\r\nHowever, James II. still had many friends, only they had been out of\r\nreach at the first alarm.  The Latin word for James is Jacobus, and,\r\ntherefore, they were called Jacobites.  All Roman Catholics were, of\r\ncourse, Jacobites; and there were other persons who, though grieved\r\nat the king\'s conduct, did not think it right to rise against him\r\nand drive him away; and, having taken an oath to obey him, held that\r\nit would be wrong to swear obedience to anyone else while he was\r\nalive.  Archbishop Sancroft was one of these.  He thought it wrong\r\nin the new queen, Mary, to consent to take her father\'s place; and\r\nwhen she sent to ask his blessing, he told her to ask her father\'s\r\nfirst, as, without that, his own would do her little good.  Neither\r\nhe nor Bishop Ken, nor some other bishops, nor a good many more of\r\nthe clergy, would take the oaths to William, or put his name instead\r\nof that of James in the prayers at church.  They rather chose to be\r\nturned out of their bishoprics and parishes, and to live in poverty.\r\nThey were called the non-jurors, or not-swearers.\r\n\r\nLouis, King of France, tried to send James back, and gave him the\r\nservice of his fleet; but it was beaten by Admiral Russell, off Cape\r\nLa Hogue.  Poor James could not help crying out, "See my brave English\r\nsailors!"  One of Charles\'s old officers, Lord Dundee, raised an army\r\nof Scots in James\'s favor, but he was killed just as he had won the\r\nbattle of Killicrankie; and there was no one to take up the cause just\r\nthen, and the Scotch Whigs were glad of the change.\r\n\r\nMost of James\'s friends, the Roman Catholics, were in Ireland, and\r\nLouis lent him an army with which to go thither and try to win his\r\ncrown back.  He got on pretty well in the South, but in the North--\r\nwhere Oliver Cromwell had given lands to many of his old soldiers--\r\nhe met with much more resistance.  At Londonderry, the apprentice boys\r\nshut the gates of the town and barred them against him.  A clergyman\r\nnamed George Walker took the command of the city, and held it out for\r\na hundred and five days against him, till everyone was nearly starved\r\nto death--and at last help came from England.  William himself came\r\nto Ireland, and the father and son-in-law met in battle on the banks\r\nof the Boyne, on the 1st of July, 1690.  James was routed; and large\r\nnumbers of the Irish Protestants have ever since kept the 1st of July\r\nas a great holiday--commemorating the victory by wearing orange lilies\r\nand orange-colored scarfs.\r\n\r\nJames was soon obliged to leave Ireland, and his friends there were\r\nseverely punished.  In the meantime, William was fighting the French\r\nin Holland--as he had done nearly all his life--while Mary governed\r\nthe kingdom at home.  She was a handsome, stately lady, and was much\r\nrespected; and there was great grief when she died of the small-pox,\r\nnever having had any children.  It was settled upon this that William\r\nshould go on reigning as long as he lived, and then that Princess Anne\r\nshould be queen; and if she left no children, that the next after\r\nher should be the youngest daughter of Elizabeth, daughter of James\r\nI.  Her name was Sophia, and she was married to Ernest of Brunswick,\r\nElector of Hanover.  It was also settled that no Roman Catholic, nor\r\neven anyone who married a Roman Catholic, could ever be on the English\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nMost of the Tories disliked this Act of Settlement; and nobody had\r\nmuch love for King William, who was a thin, spare man, with a large,\r\nhooked nose, and very rough, sharp manners--perhaps the more sharp\r\nbecause he was never in good health, and suffered terribly from the\r\nasthma.  However, he managed to keep all the countries under him in\r\ngood order, and he was very active, and always at war with the French.\r\nTowards the end of his reign a fresh quarrel began, in which all\r\nEurope took part.  The King of Spain died without children, and the\r\nquestion was who should reign after him.  The King of France had\r\nmarried one sister of this king, and the Emperor of Germany was the\r\nson of her aunt.  One wanted to make his grandson king of Spain, the\r\nother his son, and so there was a great war.  William III. took part\r\nagainst the French--as he had always been their enemy; but just as\r\nthe war was going to begin, as he was riding near his palace of Hampton\r\nCourt, his horse trod into a mole-hill, and he fell, breaking his\r\ncollar bone; and this hurt his weak chest so much that he died in a\r\nfew days, in the year 1702.  The Jacobites were very glad to be rid\r\nof him, and used to drink the health of the "little gentleman in a\r\nblack velvet coat," meaning the mole which had caused his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nANNE.  A.D. 1702--1714.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueen Anne, the second daughter of James II., began to reign on the\r\ndeath of William III.  She was a well-meaning woman, but very weak\r\nand silly; and any person who knew how to manage her could make her\r\nhave no will of her own.  The person who had always had such power\r\nover her has Sarah Jennings, a lady in her train, who had married an\r\nofficer named John Churchill.  As this gentleman had risen in the\r\narmy, he proved to be one of the most able generals who ever lived.\r\nHe was made a peer, and, step by step, came to be Duke of Marlborough.\r\nIt was he and his wife who, being Whigs, had persuaded Anne to desert\r\nher father; and, now she was queen, she did just as they pleased.\r\nThe duchess was mistress of the robes, and more queen at home than\r\nAnne was; and the duke commanded the army which was sent to fight\r\nagainst the French, to decide who should be king of Spain.  An\r\nexpedition was sent to Spain, which gained the rock of Gibraltar,\r\nand this has been kept by the English ever since.\r\n\r\nNever were there greater victories than were gained by the English\r\nand German forces together, under the Duke of Marlborough and Prince\r\nEugene of Savoy, who commanded the Emperor\'s armies.  The first and\r\ngreatest battle of them all was fought at Blenheim, in Bavaria, when\r\nthe French were totally defeated, with great loss.  Marlborough was\r\nrewarded by the queen and nation buying an estate for him, which was\r\ncalled Blenheim, where woods were planted so as to imitate the\r\nposition of his army before the battle, and a grand house built and\r\nfilled with pictures recording his adventures.  The other battles\r\nwere all in the Low Countries--at Ramillies, Oudenard, and Malplaquet.\r\nThe city of Lisle was taken after a long siege, and not a summer went\r\nby without tidings coming of some great victory, and the queen going\r\nin a state coach to St. Paul\'s Cathedral to return thanks for it.\r\n\r\nBut all this glory of her husband made the Duchess of Marlborough more\r\nproud and overbearing.  She thought the queen could not do without her,\r\nand so she left off taking any trouble to please her; nay, she would\r\nsometimes scold her more rudely than any real lady would do to any\r\nwoman, however much below her in rank.  Sometimes she brought the poor\r\nqueen to tears; and on the day on which Anne went in state to St.\r\nPaul\'s, to return thanks for the victory of Oudenarde, she was seen\r\nto be crying all the way from St. James\'s Palace in her coach, with\r\nthe six cream-colored horses, because the duchess had been scolding\r\nher for putting on her jewels in the way she liked best, instead of\r\nin the duchess\'s way.\r\n\r\nNow, Duchess Sarah had brought to the palace, to help to wait on the\r\nqueen, a poor cousin of her own, named Abigail Masham, a much more\r\nsmooth and gentle person, but rather deceitful.  When the mistress of\r\nthe robes was unkind and insolent, the queen used to complain to Mrs.\r\nMasham; and by-and-by Abigail told her how to get free.  There was a\r\ngentleman, well known to Mrs. Masham--Mr. Harley, a member of\r\nParliament and a Tory, and she brought him in by the back stairs to\r\nsee the queen, without the duchess knowing it.  He undertook, if the\r\nqueen would stand by him, to be her minister, and to turn out the\r\nChurchills and their Whig friends, send away the tyrant duchess, and\r\nmake peace, so that the duke might not be wanted any more.  In fact,\r\nthe war had gone on quite long enough; the power of the King of France\r\nwas broken, and he was an old man, whom it was cruel to press further;\r\nbut this was not what Anne cared about so much as getting free of the\r\nduchess.  There was great anger and indignation among all the Whigs at\r\nthe breaking off the war in the midst of so much glory; and, besides,\r\nthe nation did not keep its engagements to the others with whom it had\r\nallied itself.  Marlborough himself was not treated as a man deserved\r\nwho had won so much honor for his country, and he did not keep his\r\nhealth many years after his fall.  Once, when he felt his mind getting\r\nweak, he looked up at his own picture at Blenheim, taken when he was\r\none of the handsomest, most able, and active men in Europe, and said\r\nsadly, "Ah! that _was_ a man."\r\n\r\nMr. Harley was made Earl of Oxford, and managed the queen\'s affairs\r\nfor her.  He and the Tories did not at all like the notion of the\r\nGerman family of Brunswick--Sophia and her son George--who were to\r\nreign next, and they allowed the queen to look towards her own family\r\na little more.  Her father had died in exile, but there remained the\r\nyoung brother whom she had disowned, and whom the French and the\r\nJacobites called King James III.  If he would have joined the English\r\nChurch Anne would have gladly invited him, and many of the English\r\nwould have owned him as the right king; but he was too honest to give\r\nup his faith, and the queen could do nothing for him.\r\n\r\nTill her time the Scots--though since James I. they had been under the\r\nsame king as England--had had a separate Parliament, Lords and Commons,\r\nwho sat at Edinburgh; but in the reign of Queen Anne the Scottish\r\nParliament was united to the English one, and the members of it had\r\nto come to Westminster.  This made many Scotsmen so angry that they\r\nbecame Jacobites; but as every body knew that the queen was a gentle,\r\nwell-meaning old lady, nobody wished to disturb her, and all was\r\nquiet as long as she lived, so that her reign was an unusually tranquil\r\none at home, though there were such splendid victories abroad.  It was\r\na time, too, when there were almost as many able writers as in Queen\r\nElizabeth\'s time.  The two books written at that day, which you are\r\nmost likely to have heard of, are Robinson Crusoe, written by Daniel\r\nDefoe, and Alexander Pope\'s translation of Homer\'s Iliad.\r\n\r\nAnne\'s Tory friends did not make her happy; they used to quarrel among\r\nthemselves and frightened her; and after one of their disputes she had\r\nan attack of apoplexy, and soon died of it, in the year 1714.\r\n\r\nIt was during Anne\'s reign that it became the fashion to drink tea\r\nand coffee.  One was brought from China, and the other from Arabia,\r\nnot very long before, and they were very dear indeed.  The ladies\r\nused to drink tea out of little cups of egg-shell china, and the\r\nclever gentlemen, who were called the wits, used to meet and talk\r\nat coffeehouses, and read newspapers, and discuss plays and poems;\r\nalso, the first magazine was then begun.  It was called "The\r\nSpectator," and was managed by Mr. Addison.  It came out once a week,\r\nand laughed at or blamed many of the foolish and mischievous habits\r\nof the time.  Indeed it did much to draw people out of the bad ways\r\nthat had come in with Charles II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nGEORGE I.  A.D. 1714--1725.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Electress Sophia, who had always desired to be queen of England,\r\nhad died a few months before Queen Anne; and her son George, who liked\r\nhis own German home much better than the trouble of reigning in a\r\nstrange country, was in no hurry to come, and waited to see whether\r\nthe English would not prefer the young James Stuart.  But as no James\r\narrived George set off, rather unwillingly, and was received in London\r\nin a dull kind of way.  He hardly knew any English, and was obliged\r\nsometimes to talk bad Latin and sometimes French, when he consulted\r\nwith his ministers.  He did not bring a queen with him, for he had\r\nquarreled with his wife, and shut her up in a castle in Germany; but\r\nhe had a son, also named George, who had a very clever, handsome wife\r\n--Caroline of Anspach, a German princess; but the king was jealous of\r\nthem, and generally made them live abroad.\r\n\r\nJust when it was too late, and George I. had thoroughly settled into\r\nhis kingdom, the Jacobites in the North of England and in Scotland\r\nbegan to make a stir, and invited James Stuart over to try to gain\r\nthe kingdom.  The Jacobites used to call him James III., but the Whigs\r\ncalled him the Pretender; and the Tories used, by way of a middle\r\ncourse, to call him the Chevalier--the French word for a knight, as\r\nthat he certainly was, whether he were king or pretender.  A white\r\nrose was the Jacobite mark, and the Whigs still held to the orange\r\nlily and orange ribbon, for the sake of William of Orange.\r\n\r\nThe Jacobite rising did not come to any good.  Two battles were fought\r\nbetween the king\'s troops and the Jacobites--one in England and the\r\nother in Scotland--on the very same day.  The Scottish one was at\r\nSheriff-muir, and was so doubtful, that the old Scottish song about\r\nit ran thus--\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Some say that we won,\r\n                       And some say the they won,\r\n                       Some say that none won\r\n                            At a\', man;\r\n\r\n                       But of one thing I\'m sure,\r\n                       That at Sheriff-muir\r\n                       A battle there was,\r\n                               Which I saw, man.\r\n\r\n                       And we ran, and they ran,\r\n                       And they ran, and we ran,\r\n                       And we ran, and they ran--\r\n                               Awa, man.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English one was at Preston, and in it the Jacobites were all\r\ndefeated and made prisoners; so that when their friend the Chevalier\r\nlanded in Scotland, he found that nothing could be done, and had to\r\ngo back again to Italy, where he generally lived, under the Pope\'s\r\nprotection; and where he married a Polish princess and had two sons,\r\nwhom he named Charles Edward and Henry.\r\n\r\nThis rising of the Jacobites took place in the year 1715, and is,\r\ntherefore, generally called the Rebellion of the Fifteen.  The chief\r\nnoblemen who were engaged in it were taken to London to be tried.\r\nThree were beheaded; one was saved upon his wife\'s petition; and one,\r\nthe Earl of Nithsdale, by the cleverness of his wife.  She was allowed\r\nto go and see him in the Tower, and she took a tall lady in with her,\r\nwho contrived to wear a double set of outer garments.  The friend\r\nwent away, after a time; and then, after waiting till the guard was\r\nchanged, Lady Nithsdale dressed her husband in the clothes that had\r\nbeen brought in: and he, too, went away, with the hood over his face\r\nand a handkerchief up to his eyes, so that the guard might take him\r\nfor the other lady, crying bitterly at parting with the earl.  The\r\nwife, meantime, remained for some time, talking and walking up and\r\ndown as heavily as she could, till the time came when she would\r\nnaturally be obliged to leave him--when, as she passed by his servant,\r\nshe said to him that "My lord will not be ready for the candles just\r\nyet,"--and then left the Tower, and went to a little lodging in a\r\nback street, where she found her husband, and where they both lay hid\r\nwhile the search for Lord Nithsdale was going on, and where they heard\r\nthe knell tolling when his friends, the other lords, were being led out\r\nto have their heads cut off.  Afterwards, they made their escape to\r\nFrance, where most of the Jacobites who had been concerned in the\r\nrising were living, as best they could, on small means--and some of\r\nthem by becoming soldiers of the King of France.\r\n\r\nEngland was prosperous in the time of George I., and the possessions\r\nof the country in India were growing, from a merchant\'s factory here\r\nand there, to large lands and towns.  But the English never liked King\r\nGeorge, nor did he like them; and he generally spent his time in his\r\nown native country of Hanover.  He was taking a drive there in his\r\ncoach, when a letter was thrown in at the window.  As he was reading\r\nit, a sudden stroke of apoplexy came on, and he died in a few hours\'\r\ntime.  No one ever knew what was in the letter, but some thought it\r\nwas a letter reproaching him with his cruelty to his poor wife, who\r\nhad died in her prison about eight months before.  He died in the\r\nyear 1725.\r\n\r\nGentlemen were leaving off full-bottomed wigs now, and wearing smaller\r\nones; and younger men had their own hair powdered, and tied up with\r\nribbon in a long tail behind, called a queue.  Ladies powdered their\r\nhair, and raised it to an immense height, and also wore monstrous\r\nhoops, long ruffles, and high-heeled shoes.  Another odd fashion was\r\nthat ladies put black patches on their faces, thinking they made them\r\nhandsomer.  Both ladies and gentlemen took snuff, and carried beautiful\r\nsnuff-boxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nGEORGE II.  A.D. 1725--1760.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reign of George II. was a very warlike one.  Indeed he was the\r\nlast king of England who ever was personally in a battle; and,\r\ncuriously enough, this battle--that of Fontenoy--was the last that\r\na king of France also was present in.  It was, however, not a very\r\ninteresting battle; and it was not clear who really won it, nor are\r\nwars of this time very easy to understand.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Fontenoy was fought in the course of a great war to\r\ndecide who would be emperor of Germany, in which France and England\r\ntook different sides; and this made Charles Edward Stuart, the eldest\r\nson of James, think it was a good moment for trying once again to get\r\nback the crown of his forefathers.  He was a fine-looking young man,\r\nwith winning manners, and a great deal more spirit than his father:\r\nand when he landed in Scotland with a very few followers, one Highland\r\ngentleman after another was so delighted with him that they all brought\r\ntheir clans to join him, and he was at the head of quite a large force,\r\nwith which he took possession of the town of Edinburgh; but he never\r\ncould take the castle.  The English army was most of it away fighting\r\nin Germany, and the soldiers who met him at Prestonpans, close to\r\nEdinburgh, were not well managed, and were easily beaten by the\r\nHighlanders.  Then he marched straight on into England: and there\r\nwas great terror, for the Highlanders--with their plaids, long swords,\r\nand strange language--were thought to be all savage robbers, and the\r\nLondoners expected to have every house and shop ruined and themselves\r\nmurdered: though on the whole the Highlanders behaved very well.  They\r\nwould probably have really entered London if they had gone on, and\r\nreached it before the army could come home, but they grew discontented\r\nand frightened at being so far away from their own hills; and at Derby.\r\nCharles Edward was obliged to let them turn back to Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe English army had come back by this time, and the Scots were\r\nfollowed closely, getting more sad and forlorn, and losing men in every\r\nday\'s march, till at last, after they had reached Scotland again, they\r\nmade a stand against the English under the king\'s second son, William,\r\nDuke of Cumberland, at the heath of Culloden.  There they were entirely\r\nrouted, and the prince had to fly, and hide himself in strange places\r\nand disguises, much as his great uncle, Charles II., had done before\r\nhim.  A young lady named Flora Macdonald took him from one of the\r\nWestern Isles to another in a boat as her Irish maid, Betty Bourke;\r\nand, at another time, he was his in a sort of bower, called the cage,\r\nwoven of branches of trees on a hill side, where he lived with three\r\nHighlanders, who used to go out by turns to get food.  One of them\r\nonce brought him a piece of ginger-bread as a treat--for they loved\r\nhim heartily for being patient, cheerful, and thankful for all they\r\ndid for him; and when at last he found a way of reaching France, and\r\nshook hands with them on bidding the farewell, one of them tied up\r\nhis right hand, and vowed that no meaner person should ever touch it.\r\n\r\nThe Empress Maria Theresa, of Germany, had a long war with Frederick,\r\nKing of Prussia, who was nephew to George II., and a very clever and\r\nbrave man, who made his little kingdom of Prussia very warlike and\r\nbrave.  But he was not a very good man, and these were sad times among\r\nthe great people, for few of them thought much about being good: and\r\nthere were clever Frenchmen who laughed at all religion.  You know\r\none of the Psalms, "The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God."\r\nThere were a great many such fools at that time, and their ways,\r\ntogether with the selfishness of the nobles, soon brought terrible\r\ntimes to France, and all the countries round.\r\n\r\nThe wars under George II. were by sea as well as by land: and,\r\nlikewise, in the distant countries where Englishmen, on the one hand,\r\nand Frenchmen, on the other, had made those new homes that we call\r\ncolonies.  In North America, both English and French had large\r\nsettlements; and when the kings at home were at war, there were\r\nlikewise battles in these distant parts, and the Indians were stirred\r\nup to take part with the one side or the other.  They used to attack\r\nthe homes of the settlers, burn them, kill and torment the men, and\r\nkeep the children to bring up among their own.  The English had, in\r\ngeneral, the advantage, especially in Canada, where the brave young\r\nGeneral Wolfe led an attack, on the very early morning, to the Heights\r\nof Abraham, close to the town of Quebec.  He was struck down by a\r\nshot early in the fight, and lay on the ground with a few officers\r\nround him.  "They run, they run!" he heard them cry.  "Who run?" he\r\nasked.  "The French run."  "Then I die happy," he said; and it was\r\nby this battle that England won Lower Canada, with many French\r\ninhabitants, whose descendants still speak their old language.\r\n\r\nIn the East Indies, too, there was much fighting.  The English and\r\nFrench both had merchants there; and these had native soldiers to\r\nguard them, and made friends with the native princes.  When these\r\nprinces quarreled they helped them, and so obtained a larger footing.\r\nBut in this reign the English power was nearly ended in a very sad\r\nway.  An Indian army came suddenly down on Calcutta.  Many English\r\ngot on board the ships, but those who could not--146 in number--were\r\nshut up all night in a small room, in the hottest time of the year,\r\nand they were so crushed together and suffocated by the heat that,\r\nwhen the morning came, there were only twenty-three of them alive.\r\nThis dreadful place was known as the Black Hole of Calcutta.  The\r\nnext year Calcutta was won back again; and the English, under Colonel\r\nClive, gained so much ground that the French had no power left in\r\nIndia, and the English could go on obtaining more and more land,\r\nriches and power.\r\n\r\nGeorge II. had lost his eldest son, Frederick, Prince of Wales, and\r\nhis lively and clever wife, Queen Caroline, many years before his\r\ndeath.  His chief ministers were, first, Sir Robert Walpole, and\r\nafterwards the Earl of Chatham--able men, who knew how to manage the\r\ncountry through all these wars.  The king died at last, quite suddenly\r\nwhen sixty-eight years old, in the year 1760.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nGEORGE III.  A.D. 1760--1785.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter George II. reigned his grandson, George III., the son of\r\nFrederick, Prince of Wales, who had died before his father.  The\r\nPrincess of Wales was a good woman, who tried to bring up her\r\nchildren well; and George III. was a dutiful son to her, and a good,\r\nfaithful man--always caring more to do right than for anything else.\r\nHe had been born in England, and did not feel as if Hanover were his\r\nhome, as his father and grandfather had done, but loved England, and\r\nEnglish people, and ways.  When he was at Windsor, he used to ride or\r\nwalk about like a country squire, and he had a ruddy, hearty face and\r\nmanner, that made him sometimes be called Farmer George; and he had\r\nan odd way of saying "What? what?" when he was spoken to, which made\r\nhim be laughed at; but he was as good and true as any man who ever\r\nlived: and when he thought a thing was right, he was as firm as a\r\nrock in holding to it.  He married a German princess named Charlotte,\r\nand they did their utmost to make all those about them good.  They\r\nhad a very large family--no less than fourteen children--and some old\r\npeople still remember what a beautiful sight it was when, after church\r\non Sunday, the king and queen and their children used to walk up and\r\ndown the stately terrace at Windsor Castle, with a band playing, and\r\neveryone who was respectably dressed allowed to come in and look at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nJust after George III. came to the crown, a great war broke out in the\r\nEnglish colonies in America.  A new tax had been made.  A tax means\r\nthe money that has to be given to the Government of a country to pay\r\nthe judges and their officers, the soldiers and sailors, to keep up\r\nships and buy weapons, and do all that is wanted to protect us and\r\nkeep us in order.  Taxes are sometimes made by calling on everybody to\r\npay money in proportion to what they have--say threepence for every\r\nhundred pounds; sometimes they are made by putting what is called a\r\nduty on something that is bought and sold--making it sell for more\r\nthan its natural price--so that the Government gets the money above\r\nthe right cost.  This is generally done with things that people could\r\nlive without, and had better not buy too much of--such as spirits,\r\ntobacco, and hair powder.  And as tea was still a new thing in England,\r\nwhich only fine ladies drank, it was thought useless, and there was a\r\nheavy duty laid upon it when the king wanted money.  Now, the Americans\r\ngot their tea straight from China, and thought it was unfair that they\r\nshould pay tax on it.  So, though they used it much more than the\r\nEnglish then did, they gave it up, threw whole ship-loads of it into\r\nthe harbor at Boston, and resisted the soldiers.  A gentleman named\r\nGeorge Washington took the command, and they declared they would fight\r\nfor freedom from the mother country.  The French were beginning to\r\nthink freedom was a fine thing, and at first a few French gentlemen\r\ncame over to fight among the Americans, and then the king Louis XVI.,\r\nquarreled with George III., and helped them openly.\r\n\r\nThere was a very clever man among the Americans named Benjamin\r\nFranklin, a printer by trade, but who made very curious discoveries.\r\nOne of them was that lightning comes from the strange power men call\r\nelectricity, and that there are some substances which it will run\r\nalong, so that it came be brought down to the ground without doing any\r\nmischief--especially metallic wires.  He made sure of it by flying a\r\nkite, with such an iron wire up to the clouds when there was a thunder-\r\nstorm.  The lightning was attracted by the wire, ran down the wet\r\nstring of the kite, and only glanced off when it came to a silk ribbon\r\n--because electricity will not go along silk.  After this, such wires\r\nwere fastened to buildings, and carried down into the ground, to\r\nconvey away the force of the lightning.  Perhaps you have seen them\r\non the tops of churches or tall buildings; they are called conductors.\r\nFranklin was a plain-spoken, homely dressing man; and when he was sent\r\nto Paris on the affairs of the Americans, all the great ladies and\r\ngentlemen went into raptures about his beautiful simplicity, and began\r\nto imitate him, in a very affected, ridiculous way.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the war went on between America and England, year\r\nafter year; and the Americans became trained soldiers and got the\r\nbetter, so that George III. was advised to give up his rights over\r\nthem.  Old Lord Chatham, his grandfather\'s minister, who had long\r\nbeen too sick and feeble to undertake any public business, thought\r\nit so bad for the country to give anything up, that he came down to\r\nthe House of Lords to make a speech against doing so; but he was not\r\nstrong enough for the exertion, and had only just done speaking when\r\nhe fainted away, and his son, William Pitt, was called out of the\r\nHouse of Commons to help carry him away to his coach.  He was taken\r\nhome, and died in a few day\'s time.\r\n\r\nThe war went on, but when it had lasted seven years, the English felt\r\nthat peace must be made; and so George III. gave up his rights to all\r\nthat country that is called the United States of America.  The United\r\nStates set up a Government of their own, which has gone on ever since,\r\nwithout a king, but with a President who is freshly chosen every four\r\nyears, and for whom every citizen has a vote.\r\n\r\nAs if to make up for what was lost in the West, the English were\r\nwinning a great deal in the East Indies, chiefly from a great prince\r\ncalled Tipoo Sahib, who was very powerful, and at one time took a\r\nnumber of English officers prisoners and drove them to his city of\r\nSeringapatam, chained together in pairs, and kept them half starved\r\nin a prison, where several died; but he was defeated and killed.\r\nThey were set free by their countrymen, after nearly two years of\r\ngrievous hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nGEORGE III.  A.D. 1785--1810.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief sorrow of George III. was that his eldest sons were wild,\r\ndisobedient young men.  George, Prince of Wales, especially, was very\r\nhandsome, and extremely proud of his own beauty.  He was called the\r\nFirst Gentleman in Europe, and set the fashion in every matter of\r\ntaste; but he spent and wasted money to a shameful amount, and was\r\nfull of bad habits; besides which, he used to set himself in every\r\nway in his power to vex and contradict his father and mother, whom\r\nhe despised for their plain simple ways and their love of duty.\r\nThe next two brothers--Frederick, Duke of York, and William, Duke\r\nof Clarence--had also very bad habits; but they went astray from\r\ncarelessness, and did not wilfully oppose their father, like their\r\neldest brother.\r\n\r\nWilliam Pitt, son of Lord Chatham, was Prime Minister.  He thought\r\nthat the Roman Catholics in England ought to have the same rights as\r\nthe king\'s other subjects, and not be hindered from being members of\r\nParliament, judges, or, indeed, from holding any office, and he wanted\r\nto bring a bill into Parliament for this purpose.  But the king thought\r\nthat for him to consent would be contrary to the oath he had sworn\r\nwhen he was crowned, and which had been drawn up when William of\r\nOrange came over.  Nothing would make George III. break his word, and\r\nhe remained firm, though he was so harassed and distressed that he\r\nfell ill, and lost the use of his reason for a time.  There were\r\nquestions whether the regency--that is, the right to act as king--\r\nshould be given to the son, who, though his heir, was so unlike him,\r\nwhen he recovered; and there was a great day of joy throughout the\r\nnation, when he went in state to St. Paul\'s Cathedral to return thanks.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, terrible troubles were going on in France.  Neither\r\nthe kings nor nobles had, for ages past, any notion of their proper\r\nduties to people under them, but had ground them down so hard that at\r\nlast they could bear it no longer; and there was a great rising up\r\nthroughout the country, which is known as the French Revolution.  The\r\nking who was then reigning was a good and kind man, Louis XVI., who\r\nwould gladly have put things in better order; but he was not as wise\r\nor firm as he was good, and the people hated him for the evil doings\r\nof his forefathers.  So, while he was trying to make up his mind what\r\nto do, the power was taken out of his hands, and he, with his wife,\r\nsister, and two children, were shut up in prison.  An evil spirit\r\ncame into the people, and made them believe that the only way to keep\r\nthemselves free would be to get rid of all who had been great people\r\nin the former days.  So they set up a machine for cutting off heads,\r\ncalled the guillotine, and there, day after day, nobles and priests,\r\ngentlemen and ladies--even the king, queen, and princess, were brought\r\nand slain.  The two children were not guillotined, but the poor little\r\nboy, only nine years old, was worse off than if he had been, for the\r\ncruel wretches who kept him called him the wolf-cub, and said he was\r\nto be got rid of, and they kept him alone in a dark, dirty room, and\r\nused him so ill that he pined to death.  Many French gentry and\r\nclergymen fled to England, and there were kindly treated and helped\r\nto live; and the king\'s brother, now the rightful king himself, found\r\na home there too.\r\n\r\nAt last the French grew weary of this horrible bloodshed; but, as they\r\ncould not manage themselves, a soldier named Napoleon Bonaparte, by\r\nhis great cleverness and the victories he gained over other nations,\r\nsucceeded in getting all the power.  His victories were wonderful.  He\r\nbeat the Germans, the Italians, the Russians, and conquered wherever\r\nhe went.  There was only one nation he never could beat, and that was\r\nthe English; though he very much wanted to have come over here with a\r\ngreat fleet and army, and have conquered our island.  All over England\r\npeople got ready.  All the men learnt something of how to be soldiers,\r\nand made themselves into regiments of volunteers; and careful watch\r\nwas kept against the quantities of flat-bottomed boats that Bonaparte\r\nhad made ready to bring his troops across the English Channel.  But no\r\none had ships and sailors like the English; and, besides, they had the\r\ngreatest sea-captain who ever lived, whose name was Horatio Nelson.\r\nWhen the French went under Napoleon to try to conquer Egypt and all\r\nthe East, Nelson went after them with his ships, and beat the whole\r\nFrench fleet, though it was a great deal larger than his own, at the\r\nmouth of the Nile, blowing up the Admiral\'s ship, and taking or\r\nburning many more.  Afterward, when the King of Denmark was being made\r\nto take part against England, Nelson\'s fleet sailed to Copenhagen,\r\nfought a sharp battle, and took all the Danish ships.  And lastly,\r\nwhen Spain had made friends with France, and both their fleets had\r\njoined together against England, Lord Nelson fought them both off\r\nCape Trafalgar, and gained the greatest of all his victories; but it\r\nwas his last, for a Frenchman on the mast-head shot him through the\r\nbackbone, and he died the same night.  No one should ever forget the\r\norder he gave to all his sailors in all the ships before the battle--\r\n"England expects every man to do his duty."\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Trafalgar the sea was cleared of the enemy\'s\r\nships, and there was no more talk of invading England.  Indeed, though\r\nBonaparte overran nearly all the Continent of Europe, the smallest\r\nstrip of sea was enough to stop him, for his ships could not stand\r\nbefore the English ones.\r\n\r\nAll this time English affairs were managed by Mr. Pitt, Lord Chatham\'s\r\nson; but he died the very same year as Lord Nelson was killed, 1805,\r\nand then his great rival, Mr. Fox, was minister in his stead: but he,\r\ntoo, died very soon, and affairs were managed by less clever men, but\r\nwho were able to go on in the line that Pitt had marked out for them:\r\nand that was, of standing up with all their might against Bonaparte--\r\nthough he now called himself the Emperor, Napoleon I., and was treading\r\ndown every country in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe war time was a hard one at home in England, for everything was\r\nvery dear and the taxes were high; but everyone felt that the only\r\nway to keep the French away was to go on fighting with them, and\r\ntrying to help the people in the countries they seized upon.  So the\r\nwhole country stood up bravely against them.\r\n\r\nSad trouble came on the good old king in his later years.  He lost his\r\nsight, and, about the same time, died his youngest child, the Princess\r\nAmelia, of whom he was very fond.  His grief clouded his mind again,\r\nand there was no recovery this time.  He was shut up in some rooms at\r\nWindsor Castle, where he had music to amuse him, and his good wife,\r\nQueen Charlotte, watched over him carefully as long as she lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nGEORGE III.--THE REGENCY.  A.D. 1810--1820.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen George III. lost his senses, the government was given to his son,\r\nthe Prince of Wales--the Prince Regent as he was called.  Regent means\r\na person ruling instead of the king.  Everyone expected that, as he\r\nhad always quarreled with his father, he would change everything and\r\nhave different ministers; but instead of that, he went on just as had\r\nbeen done before, fighting with the French, and helping every country\r\nthat tried to lift up its head against Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nSpain was one of these countries.  Napoleon had managed to get the\r\nking, and queen, and eldest son, all into his hands together, shut\r\nthem up as prisoners in France, and made his own brother king.  But\r\nthe Spaniards were too brave to bear this, and they rose up against\r\nhim, calling the English to help them.  Sir John Moore was sent first,\r\nand he marched an army into Spain; but, though the Spaniards were\r\nbrave, they were not steady, and when Napoleon sent more troops he\r\nwas obliged to march back over the steep hills, covered with snow,\r\nto Corunna, where he had left the ships.  The French followed him,\r\nand he had to fight a battle to drive them back, that his soldiers\r\nmight embark in quiet.  It was a great victory; but in the midst of\r\nit Sir John Moore was wounded by a cannon shot, and only live long\r\nenough to hear that the battle was won.  He was buried at the dead\r\nof night on the ramparts of Corunna, wrapped in his cloak.\r\n\r\nHowever, before the year was over, Sir Arthur Wellesley was sent out\r\nto Portugal and Spain.  He never once was beaten, and though twice he\r\nhad had to retreat into Portugal, he soon won back the ground he had\r\nlost; and in three years\' time he had driven the French quite out of\r\nSpain, and even crossed the Pyrenean mountains after them, forcing\r\nthem back into their own country, and winning the battle of Toulouse\r\non their own ground.  This grand war had more victories in it than\r\nyou will easily remember.  The chief of them were at Salamanca,\r\nVittoria, Orthes, and Toulouse; and the whole war was called the\r\nPeninsular War, because it was fought in the Peninsular of France\r\nand Spain.  Sir Arthur Wellesley had been made duke of Wellington,\r\nto reward him, and he set off across France to meet the armies of\r\nthe other European countries.  For, while the English were fighting\r\nin Spain, the other states of Europe had all joined together against\r\nNapoleon, and driven him away from robbing them, and hunted him at\r\nlast to Paris, where they made him give up all his unlawful power.\r\nThe right king of France, Louis XVIII., was brought home, and Napoleon\r\nwas sent to a little island named Elba, in the Mediterranean Sea,\r\nwhere it was thought he could do no harm.\r\n\r\nBut only the next year he managed to escape, and came back to France,\r\nwhere all his old soldiers were delighted to see him again.  The king\r\nwas obliged to fly, and Napoleon was soon at the head of as large and\r\nfierce an army as ever.  The first countries that were ready to fight\r\nwith him were England and Prussia.  The Duke of Wellington with the\r\nEnglish, and Marshal Blucher with the Prussian army, met him on the\r\nfield of Waterloo, in Belgium; and there he was so entirely defeated\r\nthat he had to flee away from the field.  But he found no rest or\r\nshelter anywhere, and at last was obliged to give himself up to the\r\ncaptain of an English ship named the Bellerophon.  He was taken to\r\nPlymouth harbor, and kept in the ship while it was being determined\r\nwhat should be done with him: and at length it was decided to send\r\nhim to St. Helena, a very lonely island far away in the Atlantic\r\nOcean, whence he would have no chance of escaping.  There he was kept\r\nfor five years, at the end of which time he died.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Europe was at peace again; but the poor old blind King\r\nGeorge did not know it, nor how much times had changed in his long\r\nreign.  The war had waked people up from the dull state they had been\r\nin so long, and much was going on that began greater changes than\r\nanyone thought of.  Sixty years before, when he began to reign, the\r\nroads were so bad that it took three days to go by coach to London\r\nfrom Bath; now they were smooth and good, and fine swift horses were\r\nkept at short stages, which made the coaches take only a few hours on\r\nthe journey.  Letters came much quicker and more safely; there were\r\na great many newspapers, and everybody was more alive.  Some great\r\nwriters there were, too: the Scottish poet Walter Scott, who wrote\r\nsome of the most delightful tales there are in the world; and three\r\nwho lived at the lakes--Wordsworth, Southey, and Coleridge.  It was\r\nonly in this reign that people cared to write books for children.\r\nMrs. Trimmer, and another good lady called Hannah More, were trying\r\nto get the poor in the villages better taught; and there was a very\r\ngood Yorkshire gentleman--William Wilberforce--who was striving to\r\nmake people better.\r\n\r\nAs to people\'s looks in those days, they had left off wigs--except\r\nbishops, judges, and lawyers, in their robes.  Men had their hair\r\nshort and curly, and wore coats shaped like evening ones--generally\r\nblue, with brass buttons--buff waistcoats, and tight trousers tucked\r\ninto their boots, tight stocks round their necks, and monstrous shirt-\r\nfrills.  Ladies had their gowns and pelisses made very short-waisted,\r\nand as tight and narrow as they could be, though with enormous\r\nsleeves in them, and their hair in little curls on their foreheads.\r\nOld ladies wore turbans in evening dress; and both they and their\r\ndaughters had immense bonnets and hats, with a high crown and very\r\nlarge front.\r\n\r\nIn the 1820, the good old king passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nGEORGE IV.  A.D. 1820--1830.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge IV. was not much under sixty years old when he came to the\r\nthrone, and had really been king in all but the name for eight years\r\npast.  He had been married to the Princess Caroline of Brunswick, much\r\nagainst his will, for she was, though a princess, far from being a\r\nlady in any of her ways, and he disliked her from the first moment he\r\nsaw her; and though he could not quite treat her as Henry VIII. had\r\ntreated Anne of Cleves, the two were so unhappy together that, after\r\nthe first year, they never lived in the same house.  They had had one\r\nchild, a daughter, named Charlotte--a good, bright, sensible high-\r\nspirited girl--on whom all the hopes of the country were fixed; but\r\nas she grew up, there were many troubles between her love and her\r\nduty towards her father and mother.  As soon as the peace was made,\r\nthe Princess of Wales went to Italy and lived there, with a great\r\nmany people of bad characters about her.  Princess Charlotte was\r\nmarried to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, and was very happy with\r\nhim; but, to the great grief of all England, she died in the bloom\r\nof her youth, the year before her grandfather.\r\n\r\nGeorge IV., though he was much alone in the world, prepared to have a\r\nmost splendid coronation; but as soon as his wife heard that he was\r\nking, she set off to come to England and be crowned with him.  He was\r\nexceedingly angry, forbade her name to be put into the Prayer-book as\r\nqueen, and called on the House of Lords to break his marriage with one\r\nwho had proved herself not worthy to be a wife.  There was a great\r\nuproar about it, for though the king\'s friends wanted him to be rid\r\nof her, all the country knew that he had been no better to her than\r\nshe had been to him, and felt it unfair that the weaker one should\r\nhave all the shame and disgrace, and the stronger one none.  One of\r\nCaroline\'s defenders said that if her name were left out of the\r\nLitany, yet still she was prayed for there as one who was desolate\r\nand oppressed.  People took up her cause much more hotly than deserved,\r\nand the king was obliged to give up the enquiry into her behavior, but\r\nstill he would not let her be crowned.  In the midst of all the\r\nsplendor and solemnity in Westminster Abbey, a carriage was driven to\r\nthe door and entrance was demanded for the queen; but she was kept\r\nback, and the people did not seem disposed to interrupt the show by\r\ndoing anything in her favor, as she and her friends had expected.\r\nShe went back to her rooms, and, after being more foolish than ever\r\nin her ways, died of fretting and pining.  It is a sad history, where\r\nboth were much to blame; and it shows how hateful to the king she must\r\nhave been, that, when Napoleon died he was told his greatest enemy was\r\ndead, and he answered, "When did _she_ die?"  But if he had been a\r\ngood man himself, and not selfish, he would have borne with the poor,\r\nill brought up, giddy girl, when first she came, and that would have\r\nprevented her going so far astray.\r\n\r\nGeorge IV. made two journeys--one to Scotland, and the other to\r\nIreland.  He was the first of the House of Brunswick who ever visited\r\nthese other two kingdoms, and he was received in both with great\r\nsplendor and rejoicing; but after this his health began to fail, and\r\nhe disliked showing himself.  He spent most of his time at a house he\r\nhad built for himself at Brighton, called the Pavilion, and at Windsor,\r\nwhere he used to drive about in the park.  He was kind and gracious to\r\nthose with whom he associated, but they were as few as possible.\r\n\r\nHe was vexed and angry at having to consent to the Bill for letting\r\nRoman Catholics sit in Parliament, and hold other office--the same\r\nthat his father had stood out against.  It was not that he cared for\r\none religion more than another, for he had never been a religious\r\nman, but he saw that it would be the beginning of a great many changes\r\nthat would alter the whole state of things.  His next brother,\r\nFrederick, Duke of York, died before him; and the third, William,\r\nDuke of Clarence, who had been brought up as an officer in the navy,\r\nwas a friend of the Whigs, and of those who were ready to make\r\nalterations.\r\n\r\nChanges were coming of themselves, though--for inventions were making\r\nprogress in this time of peace.  People had begun to find out the great\r\npower of steam, and had made it move the ships, which had hitherto\r\ndepended upon the winds, and thus it became much easier to travel from\r\none country to another and to send goods.  Steam was also being used\r\nto work engines for spinning and weaving cotton, linen, and wool, and\r\nfor working metals; so that what had hitherto been done by hand, by\r\nsmall numbers of skilful people, was now brought about by large\r\nmachines, where the labor was done by steam; but quantities of people\r\nwere needed to assist the engine.  And as steam cannot be had without\r\nfire, and most of the coal is in the Northern parts of England, almost\r\nall of these works were set up in them, and people flocked to get work\r\nthere, so that the towns began to grow very large.  Manchester was one,\r\nwith Liverpool as the sea-port from which to send its calico and get\r\nits cotton.  Sheffield and Birmingham grew famous for works in iron\r\nand steel, and so on; and all this tended to make the manufacturers as\r\nrich and great as the old lords and squires, who had held most of the\r\npower in England ever since, at the Revolution, they had got it away\r\nfrom the king.  Everyone saw that some great change would soon come;\r\nbut before it came to the point George IV. fell ill, and died after a\r\nreign of twenty years in reality, but of only ten in name, the first\r\nfive of which were spent in war, and the last fifteen in peace.  The\r\nDuke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel were his chief ministers--for\r\nthe duke was as clear-headed in peace as he was in war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM IV.  A.D. 1830--1837.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge IV. had, as you know, no child living at the time of his death.\r\nHis next brother, Frederick Duke of York, died before him, likewise\r\nwithout children, so the crown went to William, Duke of Clarence,\r\nthird son of George III.  He had been a sailor in his younger days,\r\nbut was an elderly man when he came to the throne.  He was a dull and\r\nnot a very wise man, but good-natured and kind, and had an open,\r\nfriendly, sailor manner; and his wife, Queen Adelaide, of Saxe-\r\nMeiningen, was an excellent woman, whom everyone respected.  They\r\nnever had any children but two daughters who died in infancy: and\r\neveryone knew that the next heir must be the Princess Victoria,\r\ndaughter to the next brother, Edward, Duke of Kent, who had died the\r\nyear after she was born.\r\n\r\nKing William IV. had always been friendly with the Whigs, who wanted\r\npower for the people.  Those who went furthest among them were called\r\nRadicals, because they wanted a radical reform--that is, going to the\r\nroot.  In fact, it was time to alter the way of sending members to the\r\nHouse of Commons, for some of the towns that had once been big enough\r\nto choose one were now deserted and grown very small, while on the\r\nother hand, others which used to be little villages, like Birmingham\r\nand Brighton, had now become very large, and full of people.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington and his friends wanted to consider the best way\r\nof setting these things to rights, but the Radicals wanted to do much\r\nmore and much faster than he was willing to grant.  The poor fancied\r\nthat the new rights proposed would make them better off all at once,\r\nand that every man would get a fat pig in his sty and as much bread\r\nas he wanted; and they were so angry at any delay, that they went about\r\nin bands burning the hay-ricks and stacks of corn, to frighten their\r\nlandlords.  And the Duke of Wellington\'s great deeds were forgotten\r\nin the anger of the mob, who gathered round him, ready to abuse and\r\npelt him as he rode along; and yet, as they saw his quiet, calm way\r\nof going on, taking no heed to them, and quite fearless, no one raised\r\na hand.  They broke the windows of his house in London, though, and he\r\nhad iron blinds put up to protect them.  He went out of office, and\r\nthe Whigs came in, and then the Act of Parliament was passed which was\r\ncalled the Reform bill--because it set to rights what had gone wrong as\r\nto which towns should have members of their own, and, besides, allowed\r\neveryone in a borough town, who rented a house at ten pounds a year,\r\nto vote for the member of Parliament.  A borough is a town that has a\r\nmember of Parliament, and a city is one that is large enough to have a\r\nmayor and an alderman to manage its affairs at home.\r\n\r\nSeveral more changes were made under King William.  Most of the great\r\nunion workhouses were built then, and it was made less easy to get help\r\nfrom the parish without going to live in one.  This was meant to cure\r\npeople of being idle and liking to live on other folk\'s money--and it\r\nhas done good in that way; but workhouses are sad places for the poor\r\naged people who cannot work, and it is a great kindness to help them\r\nto keep out of them.\r\n\r\nThe best thing that was done was the setting the slaves free.  Look at\r\nthe map of America, and you will see a number of islands--beautiful\r\nplaces, where sugar-canes, and coffee, and spices grow.  Many of these\r\nbelong to the English, but it is too hot for Englishmen to work there.\r\nSo, for more than a hundred years, there had been a wicked custom that\r\nships should go to Africa, and there the crews would steal negro men,\r\nwomen and children, or buy them of tribes of fierce negroes who had\r\nmade them captive, and carry them off to the West Indies Islands,\r\nwhere they were sold to work for their masters, just as cattle are\r\nbought and sold.  An English gentleman--William Wilberforce--worked\r\nhalf his life to get this horrible slave trade forbidden; and at last\r\nhe succeeded, in the year 1807, whilst George III. was still reigning.\r\nBut though no more blacks were brought from Africa, still the people\r\nin the West Indies were allowed to keep, and buy and sell the slaves\r\nthey already had.  So Wilberforce and his friends still worked on\r\nuntil the time of William IV., when, in 1834, all the slaves in the\r\nBritish dominions were set free.\r\n\r\nThis reign only lasted seven years, and there were no wars in it; so\r\nthe only other thing that I have to tell you about it is, that people\r\nhad gone on from finding that steam could be made to work their ships\r\nto making it draw carriages.  Railways were being made for trains of\r\ncarriages and vans to be drawn by one steam engine.  The oldest of all\r\nwas opened in 1830, the very year that William IV. began to reign, and\r\nthat answered so well that more and more began to be made, and the\r\nwhole country to be covered with a network of railways, so the people\r\nand goods could be carried about much quicker than ever was dreamt of\r\nin old times; while steam-ships were made larger and larger, and to go\r\ngreater distances.\r\n\r\nBesides this, many people in England found there was not work or food\r\nenough for them at home, and went to settle in Canada, and Australia,\r\nand Van Dieman\'s Land, and New Zealand, making, in all these distant\r\nplaces, the new English homes called colonies; and thus there have\r\ncome to be English people wherever the sun shines.\r\n\r\nWilliam IV. died in the year 1837.  He was the last English king who\r\nhad the German State of Hanover.  It cannot belong to a woman, so it\r\nwent to his brother Ernest, instead of his niece Victoria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.  A.D. 1837--1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Princess Victoria, daughter of the Duke of Kent, was but eighteen\r\nyears old when she was Queen of England.\r\n\r\nShe went with her mother, the Duchess of Kent, to live, sometimes at\r\nBuckingham Palace and sometimes at Windsor Castle, and the next year\r\nshe was crowned in state at Westminster Abbey.  Everyone saw then how\r\nkind she was, for when one of the lords, who was very old, stumbled on\r\nthe steps as he came to pay her homage, she sprang up from her throne\r\nto help him.\r\n\r\nThree years later she was married to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg, a\r\nmost excellent men, who made it his whole business to help her in all\r\nher duties as sovereign of the great country, without putting himself\r\nforward.  Nothing ever has been more beautiful than the way those two\r\nbehaved to one another; she never forgetting that he was her husband\r\nand she only his wife, and he always remembering that she was really\r\nthe queen, and that he had no power at all.  He had a clear head and\r\ngood judgment that everyone trusted to, and yet he always kept himself\r\nin the background, that the queen might have all the credit of whatever\r\nwas done.\r\n\r\nHe took much pains to get all that was good and beautiful encouraged,\r\nand to turn people\'s minds to doing things not only in the quickest\r\nand cheapest, but in the best and most beautiful way possible.  One\r\nof these plans that he carried out was to set up what he called an\r\nInternational Exhibition, namely--a great building, to which every\r\ncountry was invited to send specimens of all its arts and manufactures.\r\nIt was called the World\'s Fair.  The house was of glass, and was a\r\nbeautiful thing in itself.  It was opened on the 1st of May, 1851;\r\nand, though there have been many great International Exhibitions\r\nsince, not one has come up to the first.\r\n\r\nPeople talked as if the World\'s Fair was to make all nations friends;\r\nbut it is not showing off their laces and their silks, their ironwork\r\nand brass, their pictures and statues, that can keep them at peace;\r\nand, only two years after the Great Exhibition, a great war broke out\r\nin Europe--only a year after the great Duke of Wellington had died,\r\nfull of years and honors.\r\n\r\nThe only country in Europe that is not Christian is Turkey; and the\r\nRussians have always greatly wished to conquer Turkey, and join it on\r\nto their great empire.  The Turks have been getting less powerful for\r\na long time past, and finding it harder to govern the country; and one\r\nday the Emperor of Russia asked the English ambassador, Sir Hamilton\r\nSeymour, if he did not think the Turkish power a very sick man who\r\nwould soon be dead.  Sir Hamilton Seymour knew what this meant; and\r\nhe knew the English did not think it right that the Russians should\r\ndrive out the Sultan of Turkey--even though he is not a Christian; so\r\nhe made the emperor understand that if the sick man did die, it would\r\nnot be for want of doctors.\r\n\r\nNeither the English nor the French could bear that the Russians should\r\nget so much power as they would have, if they gained all the countries\r\ndown to the Mediterranean Sea; so, as soon as ever the Russians began\r\nto attack the Turks, the English and French armies were sent to defend\r\nthem; and they found the best way of doing this was to go and fight\r\nthe Russians in their own country, namely--the Crimea, the peninsula\r\nwhich hangs as it were, down into the Black Sea.  So, in the autumn of\r\nthe year 1854, the English and French armies, under Lord Raglan and\r\nMarshal St. Arnaud, were landed in the Crimea, where they gained a\r\ngreat victory on their first landing, called the battle of the Alma,\r\nand then besieged the city of Sebastopol.  It was a very long siege,\r\nand in the course of it the two armies suffered sadly from the cold\r\nand damp, and there was much illness; but a brave English Lady, named\r\nFlorence Nightingale, went out with a number of nurses to take care of\r\nthe sick and wounded, and thus she saved a great many lives.  There\r\nwere two more famous battles.  One was when six hundred English\r\nhorsemen were sent by mistake against a whole battery of Russian\r\ncannon, and rode on as bravely as if they were not seeing their\r\ncomrades shot down, till scarcely half were left.  This was called\r\nthe Charge of Balaklava.  The other battle was when the Russians\r\ncrept out, late in the evening of November 5, to attack the English\r\ncamp: and there was a dreadful fight by night and in the early morning\r\non the heights of Inkerman; but at last the English won the battle,\r\nand gave the day a better honor that it had had before.  Then came a\r\nterrible winter of watching the city and firing at the walls; and when\r\nat last, on the 18th of June, 1855, it was assaulted, the defenders\r\nbeat the attack off; and Lord Raglan, worn out with care and vexation,\r\ndied a few days after.  However, soon another attack was made, and\r\nin September half the city was won.  The Emperor of Russia had died\r\nduring the war, and his son made peace, on condition that Sebastopol\r\nshould not be fortified again, and that the Russians should let the\r\nTurks alone, and keep no fleet in the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nIn this war news flew faster than ever it had done before.  You heard\r\nhow Benjamin Franklin found that electricity--that strange power of\r\nwhich lightning is the visible sign--could be carried along upon metal\r\nwire.  It has since been made out how to make the touch of a magnet\r\nat one end of these wires make the other end move so that letters can\r\nbe pointed to, words spelt out and messages sent to any distance with\r\nreally the speed of lightning.  This is the wonderful electric\r\ntelegraph, of which you see the wires upon the railway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.  A.D. 1857--1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace had been made after the Crimean war, and everybody hoped it was\r\ngoing to last, when very sad news came from India.  You know I told\r\nyou the English people had gone to live in India, and had gradually\r\ngained more and more lands there, so that they were making themselves\r\nrulers and governors over all that great country.  They had some of\r\nthe regiments of the English army to help them to keep up their power,\r\nand a great many soldiers besides--Hindoos, or natives of India, who\r\nhad English officers, and were taught to fight in the English manner.\r\nThese Hindoo soldiers were called Sepoys.  They were not Christians,\r\nbut were some of them Mahommedans, and some believed in the strange\r\nreligion of India, which teached people to believe in a great many\r\ngods--some of them very savage and cruel ones, according to their\r\nstories, and which forbids them many very simple things.  One of the\r\nthings it forbids is the killing a cow, or touching beef, or any part\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nNow, it seems the Sepoys had grown discontented with the English; and,\r\nbesides that, there came out a new sort of cartridge--that is, little\r\nparcels of powder and shot with which to load fire-arms.  The Sepoys\r\ntook it into their heads that these cartridges had grease in them\r\ntaken from cows, and that it was a trick on the part of the English\r\nto make them break the rules of their religion, and force them to\r\nbecome Christians.  In their anger they made a conspiracy together;\r\nand, in many of the places in India, they then suddenly turned upon\r\ntheir English officers, and shot them down on their parade ground, and\r\nthen they went to the houses and killed every white woman and child\r\nthey could meet with.  Some few had very wonderful escapes, and were\r\ntreated kindly by native friends; and many showed great bravery and\r\npiety in their troubles.  After that the Sepoys marched away to the\r\ncity of Delhi, where an old man lived who had once been king, and\r\nthey set him up to be king, while every English person left in the\r\ncity was murdered.\r\n\r\nThe English regiments in India made haste to come into Bengal, to try\r\nto save their country-folk who had shut themselves up in the towns or\r\nstrong places, and were being besieged there by the Sepoys.  A great\r\nmany were in barracks in Cawnpore.  It was not a strong place, and\r\nonly had a mud wall round; but there was a native prince called the\r\nNana Sahib, who had always seemed a friend to the officers--had gone\r\nout hunting with them, and invited them to his house.  They thought\r\nthemselves safe near him; but, to their horror, he forgot all this,\r\nand joined the Sepoys.  The cannon were turned against them, and the\r\nSepoys watched all day the barrack yard where they were shut in, and\r\nshot everyone who went for water.  At last, after more pain and misery\r\nthan we can bear to think of, they gave themselves up to the Nana, and\r\nhorrible to tell, he killed them all.  The men were shot the first day,\r\nand the women and little children were then shut up in a house, where\r\nthey were kept for a night.  Then the Nana heard that the English army\r\nwas coming, and in his fright and rage he sent in his men, who killed\r\neveryone of them, and threw their bodies into a deep well.  The English\r\ncame up the next day, and were nearly mad with grief and anger.  They\r\ncould not lay hands on the Nana, but they punished all the people he\r\nemployed; and they were so furious that they hardly showed any mercy\r\nto another Sepoy after that dreadful sight.\r\n\r\nThere were some more English holding out in the city of Lucknow, and\r\nthey longed to go to their relief; but first Delhi, where the old king\r\nwas, had to be taken; and, as it was a very strong place, it was a\r\nlong time before it was conquered; but at last the gates of the city\r\nwere blown up by three brave men, and the whole army made their way\r\nin.  More troops had been sent out from England to help their comrades,\r\nand they were able at last to march to Lucknow.  There, week after\r\nweek, the English soldiers, men of business, ladies, soldier\'s wives,\r\nand little children, had bravely waited, with the enemy round, and\r\nshot so often coming through the buildings that they had chiefly to\r\nlive in the cellars; and the food was so scanty and bad, that the\r\nsickly people and the little babies mostly died; and no one seemed\r\nable to get well if once he was wounded.  Help came at last.  The\r\nbrave Sir Colin Campbell, who had been sent out from home, brought the\r\narmy to their rescue, and they were saved.  The Sepoys were beaten in\r\nevery fight; and at last the terrible time of the mutiny was over, and\r\nIndia quiet again.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, the queen and all the nation had a grievous loss in the death\r\nof the good Prince Consort, Albert, who died of a fever at Windsor\r\nCastle, and was mourned for by everyone, as if he had been a relation\r\nor friend.  He left nine children, of whom the eldest, Victoria, the\r\nPrincess Royal, was married to the Prince of Prussia.  He had done\r\neverything to help forward improvements; and the country only found\r\nout how wise and good he was after he was taken away.\r\n\r\nPains began to be taken to make the great towns healthier.  It is true\r\nthat the plague has never come to England since the reign of Charles\r\nII., but those sad diseases, cholera and typhus fever, come where\r\npeople will not attend to cleanliness.  The first time the cholera came\r\nwas in the year 1833, under William IV.; and that was the last time of\r\nall, because it was a new disease, and the doctors did not know what\r\nto do to cure it.  But now they understand it much better--both how\r\nto treat, and, what is better, how to keep it away; and that is by\r\nkeeping everything sweet and clean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.  A.D. 1860--1872.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne more chapter, which, however, does not finish the history of good\r\nQueen Victoria, and these Stories of the History of England will be\r\nover.\r\n\r\nAll the nation rejoiced very much when the queen\'s eldest son, Albert\r\nEdward, the Prince of Wales, married Alexandra, daughter to the king\r\nof Denmark.  Her father and mother brought her to England, and the\r\nprince met her on board ship in the mouth of the Thames; and there\r\nwas a most beautiful and joyous procession through London.  When\r\nthey were married the next day, in St. George\'s Chapel at Windsor,\r\nthe whole of England made merry, and there were bonfires on every\r\nhill, and illuminations in every town, so that the whole island was\r\nglowing with brightness all that Spring evening.\r\n\r\nThere is a country in Abyssinia, south of Egypt.  The people there are\r\nChristians, but they have had very little to do with other nations,\r\nand have grown very dull and half savage; indeed they have many horrid\r\nand disgusting customs, and have forgotten all the teaching that would\r\nhave made them better.  Of late years there had been some attempt to\r\nwake them up and teach them; and they had a clever king named Theodore,\r\nwho seemed pleased and willing to improve himself and his nation.\r\nHe allowed missionaries to come and try to teach his people what\r\nChristianity means a little better than they knew before, and invited\r\nskilled workmen to come and teach his people.  They came; but not long\r\nafter Theodore was affronted by the English Government, and shut them\r\nall up in prison.  Messages were sent to insist upon his releasing\r\nthem, but he did not attend or understand; and at last an army was\r\nsent to land on the coast from the east, under General Napier, and\r\nmarch to his capital, which was called Magdala, and stood on a hill.\r\n\r\nGeneral Napier managed so well that there was no fighting on the road.\r\nHe came to the gates of Magdala, and threatened to fire upon it if the\r\nprisoners were not given up to him.  He waited till the time was up,\r\nand then caused his troops to begin the attack.  The Abyssinians fled\r\naway, and close by one of the gates Theodore was found lying dead,\r\nshot through.  No one is quite sure whether one of his servants killed\r\nhim treacherously, or whether he killed himself in his rage and\r\ndespair.  England did not try to keep Abyssinia though it was\r\nconquered; but it was left to the royal family whom Theodore had\r\nturned out, and Theodore\'s little son, about five years old, was\r\nbrought to England; but, as he could not bear the cold winter, he\r\nwas sent to a school in India.\r\n\r\nThis, which was in the year 1868, was the last war the English have\r\nhad.  There has been fighting all round and about in Europe, especially\r\na great war between France and Prussia in 1870; but the only thing\r\nthe English had to do with that, was the sending out of doctors and\r\nnurses, with all the good things for sick people that could be thought\r\nof, to take care of all the poor wounded on both sides, and lessen\r\ntheir suffering as much as possible.  They all wore red crosses on\r\ntheir sleeves, and put up a red-cross flag over the houses where they\r\nwere taking care of the sick and wounded, and then no one on either\r\nside fired upon them.\r\n\r\nAn Act of Parliament has given the right to vote, at the election of\r\nthe House of Commons, to much poorer men than used to have it.  It is\r\nto be hoped that they will learn to use wisely this power of helping\r\nto choose those who make the laws and govern the country.  To give\r\nthem a better chance of doing so, a law has been made that no child\r\nshall be allowed to grow up without any teaching at all, but that\r\nthose who are too poor to pay for their own schooling shall be paid\r\nfor by the State, and that their parents shall be obliged to send\r\nthem.  The great thing is to learn to know and do one\'s duty.  If\r\none only learns to be clever with one\'s head, without trying to\r\nbe good at the same time, it is of very little use.  But I hope you\r\nwill try to mind your duty--first to God and then to man; and if you\r\ndo that, God will prosper you and bless you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK YOUNG FOLKS\' HISTORY OF ENGLAND ***\r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\xe2\x80\x94the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic works\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
