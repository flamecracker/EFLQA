SUSAN BLUE.


              Oh, Susan Blue,
              How do you do?
      Please may I go for a walk with you?
              Where shall we go?
              Oh, I know--
  Down in the meadow where the cowslips grow!

BLUE SHOES.


  Little Blue Shoes
  Mustn't go
  Very far alone, you know
  Else she'll fall down,
  Or, lose her way;
  Fancy--what
  Would mamma say?
  Better put her little hand
  Under sister's wise command.
  When she's a little older grown
  Blue Shoes may go quite alone.

STREET SHOW.


  Puff, puff, puff. How the trumpets blow
  All you little boys and girls come and see the show.
  One--two--three, the Cat runs up the tree;
  But the little Bird he flies away--
  "She hasn't got me!"

TO THE SUN DOOR.


  They saw it rise in the morning,
    They saw it set at night,
  And they longed to go and see it,
    Ah! if they only might.

  The little soft white clouds heard them,
    And stepped from out of the blue;
  And each laid a little child softly
    Upon its bosom of dew.

  And they carried them higher and higher,
    And they nothing knew any more
  Until they were standing waiting
    In front of the round gold door.

  And they knocked, and called, and entreated,
    Whoever should be within;
  But all to no purpose, for no one
    Would hearken to let them in.

THE DAISIES.


  You very fine Miss Molly,
    What will the daisies say,
  If you carry home so many

  Perhaps you take a sister,
    Perhaps you take a brother,
  Or two little daisies who
    Were fond of one another.

THE DANCING FAMILY.


  Pray let me introduce you to
    This little dancing family;
  For morning, afternoon, and night
    They danced away so happily.

  They twirled round about,
    They turned their toes out;
  The people wondered what the noise
    Could all be about.

  They danced from early morning,
    Till very late at night;
  Both in-doors and out-of-doors,
    With very great delight.

  And every sort of dance they knew,
    From every country far away;
  And so it was no wonder that
    They should keep dancing all the day.

  So dancing--dancing--dancing,
    In sunshine or in rain;
  And when they all left off,
    Why then--they all began again.

GOING TO SEE GRANDMAMMA.


  Little Molly and Damon
    Are walking so far,
  For they're going to see
    Their kind Grandmamma.

  And they very well know,
    When they get there she'll take
  From out of her cupboard
    Some very nice cake.

  And into her garden
    They know they may run,
  And pick some red currants,
    And have lots of fun.

  So Damon to doggie
    Says, "How do you do?"
  And asks his mamma
    If he may not go too.

WISHES.


  Oh, if you were a little boy,
    And I was a little girl--
  Why you would have some whiskers grow
    And then my hair would curl.

  Ah! if I could have whiskers grow,
    I'd let you have my curls;
  But what's the use of wishing it--
    Boys never can be girls.

FIRST ARRIVALS.


  It is a Party, do you know,
  And there they sit, all in a row,
  Waiting till the others come,
  To begin to have some fun.

  Hark! the bell rings sharp and clear,
  Other little friends appear;
  And no longer all alone
  They begin to feel at home.

  To them a little hard is Fate,
  Yet better early than too late;
  Fancy getting there forlorn,
  With the tea and cake all gone.

  Wonder what they'll have for tea;
  Hope the jam is strawberry.
  Wonder what the dance and game;
  Feel so very glad they came.

  Very Happy may you be,
  May you much enjoy your tea.

WHEN WE WENT OUT WITH GRANDMAMMA.


  When we went out with Grandmamma--
    Mamma said for a treat--
  Oh, dear, how stiff we had to walk
    As we went down the street.

  One on each side we had to go,
    And never laugh or loll;
  I carried Prim, her Spaniard dog,
    And Tom--her parasol.

[Illustration]

  If _I_ looked right--_if Tom_ looked left--
    "Tom--Susan--I'm ashamed;
  And little Prim, I'm sure, is shocked,
    To hear such naughties named."

  She said we had no manners,
    If we ever talked or sung;
  "You should have seen," said Grandmamma,
    "_Me_ walk, when _I_ was young."

  She told us--oh, so often--
    How little girls and boys,
  In the good days when she was young,
    Never made any noise.

  She said they never wished then
    To play--oh, indeed!
  They learnt to sew and needlework,
    Or else to write and read.

  She said her mother never let
    Her speak a word at meals;
  "But now," said Grandmamma, "you'd think
    That children's tongues had wheels

  "So fast they go--clack, clack, clack, clack;
    Now listen well, I pray,
  And let me see you both improve
    From what I've said to-day."

TO MYSTERY LAND.


  Oh, dear, how will it end?
  Peggy and Susie how naughty you are.
  You little know where you are,
  Going so far, and so high,
  Nearly up to the sky.
  Perhaps it's a Giant who lives there,
  And perhaps it's a lovely Princess.
  But you very well know
  You've no business to go;
  You'll get yourselves into a mess.

  Oh, dear, I'm sure it is true;
  Whatever on earth can it matter to you?
  For you know it--oh, fie--
  That it's naughty to pry
  Into other's affairs--
  Into other folks houses to go,
  Where you know
  You're not asked.
  So you'd better come back
  While there's time, it is plain.
  Go home--and be never
  So naughty again.

  From market--from market--from market--
      We all come up from market.

LITTLE PHILLIS.


  I am a very little girl,
    I think that I've turned two;
  And if you'd like to know my name
    I'd like to tell it you.

  They always call me Baby,
    But Phillis is my name.
  No--no one ever gave it me,
    I think it only came.

  I've got a pretty tulip
    In my little flower-bed;
  If you would like I'll give it you--
    It's yellow, striped with red.

  I've got a little kitten, but
    I can't give that away,
  She likes to play with me _so_ much;
    She's gone to sleep to-day.

  And I've got a nice new dolly,
    Shall I fetch her out to you?
  She's got such pretty shoes on,
    And her bonnet's trimmed with blue.

  You'd like to take her home with you?
    Oh, _no_, she mustn't go;
  Good-bye--I want to run now,
    You walk along so slow.

THE FOUR PRINCESSES.


  Four Princesses lived in a Green Tower--
    A Bright Green Tower in the middle of the sea;
  And no one could think--oh, no one could think--
    Who the Four Princesses could be.

  One looked to the North, and one to the South,
    And one to the East, and one to the West;
  They were all so pretty, so very pretty,
    You could not tell which was the prettiest.

  Their curls were golden--their eyes were blue,
    And their voices were sweet as a silvery bell;
  And four white birds around them flew,
    But where they came from--_who_ could tell?

  Oh, who could tell? for no one knew,
    And not a word could you hear them say.
  But the sound of their singing, like church bells ringing,
    Would sweetly float as they passed away.

  For under the sun, and under the stars,
    They often sailed on the distant sea;
  Then in their Green Tower and Roses bower
    They lived again--a mystery.

  When you and I
  Grow up--Polly--
    I mean that you and me,
  Shall go sailing in a big ship
    Right over all the sea.
  We'll wait till we are older,
    For if we went to-day,
  You know that we might lose ourselves,
    And never find the way.

IN AN APPLE TREE.


  In September, when the apples were red,
  To Belinda I said,
  "Would you like to go away
  To Heaven, or stay
  Here in this orchard full of trees
  All your life?" And she said, "If you please
  I'll stay here--where I know,
  And the flowers grow."

    The wedding fine to see;
  And the Roses were all for the Bride,
    So pretty--so pretty was she.

THE LITTLE LONDON GIRL.


  In my little Green House, quite content am I,
  When the hot sun pours down from the sky;
  For oh, I love the country--the beautiful country.
  Who'd live in a London street when there's the country?

  I live in a London street, then I long and long
  To be the whole day the sweet Flowers among
  Instead of tall chimney-pots up in the sky,
  The joy of seeing Birds and Dragon Flies go by.

  At home I lie in bed, and cannot go to sleep,
  For the sound of cart-wheels upon the hard street.
  But here my eyes close up to no sound of anything
  Except it is to hear the nightingales sing.

  And then I see the Chickens and the Geese go walking,
  I hear the Pigs and the Ducks all talking.
  And the Red and the Spotted Cows they stare at me,
  As if they wondered whoever I could be.

  I see the little Lambs out with their mothers--
  Such pretty little white young sisters and brothers.
  Oh, I'll stay in the country, and make a daisy chain,
  And never go back to London again.

    Shall it be pretty Quack-Quack to-day?
  Or the Peacock upon the Yew Tree?
    Or the dear little white Lambs at play?
            Say Baby.
  For Baby is such a young Petsy,
    And Baby is such a sweet Dear.
  And Baby is growing quite old now--
    She's just getting on for a year.

WILLY AND HIS SISTER.


  Willy said to his sister,
    "Please may I go with you?"
  She said, "You must behave
    Very nicely if you do."

  "Please will you take me then
    To look at the mill?"
  "Yes," she said, "because you are
    So very good--I will."

  "The miller he is
    So very white and kind;
  And sprinkled all over
    With the flour they grind.

  "And the big heaps of corn
    That lie upon the floor;
  He will let me play with those
    I am quite sure.

  "I like to hear the wheel
    Make such a rushing sound,
  And see the pretty water
    Go round, and round, and round.

  "So take me to the mill,
    For then you shall see
  What a very, very good boy
    I really mean to be."

  Five little Girls, sitting on a form,
  Five little Girls, with lessons to learn,
  Five little Girls, who, I'm afraid,
  Won't know them a bit when they have to be said.

  For little eyes are given to look
  Anywhere else than on their book;
  And little thoughts are given to stray
  Anywhere--ever so far away.

HAPPY DAYS.


  "Are you going next week to see Phillis and Phoebe?
    Phillis on Monday will be just fourteen.
  She says we shall all have our tea in the garden,
    And afterwards have some nice games on the green.

  "I wanted a new frock, but mother said, 'No,'
    So I must be content with my old one you see.
  But then white is so pretty, and kind Aunt Matilda
    Has sent down a beautiful necklace for me."

[Illustration]

  "Oh, yes, I am going, and Peggy is going,
    And mother is making us new frocks to wear;
  I shall have my red sash and my hat with pink ribbons--
    I know all the girls will be smart who are there.

  "And then, too, we're going to each take a nosegay--
    The larger the better--for Phillis to say
  That all her friends love her, and wish her so happy,
    And bring her sweet flowers upon her birthday.

  "And won't it be lovely, in beautiful sunshine,
    The table spread under the great apple tree,
  To see little Phillis--that dear little Phillis--
    Look smiling all round as she pours out the tea!"

    Dears--tell Mrs. Cowslip so.

  "Oh, do you know--perhaps you've not heard--
    She had a dreadful fright;

A GENTEEL FAMILY.


  Some children are so naughty,
    And some are very good;
  But the Genteel Family
    Did always what it should.

  They put on gloves when they went out,
    And ran not in the street;
  And on wet days not one of them
    Had ever muddy feet.

  Then they were always so polite,
    And always thanked you so;
  And never threw their toys about,
    As naughty children do.

  They always learnt their lessons
    When it was time they should;
  And liked to eat up all their crusts--
    They were so very good.

  And then their frocks were never torn,
    Their tuckers always clean;
  And their hair so very tidy--
    Always quite fit to be seen.

  Then they made calls with their mamma
    And were so very neat;
  And learnt to bow becomingly
    When they met you in the street.

  And really they were everything
    That children ought to be;
  And well may be examples now
    For little you--and me.

  The Cowslip says to the Primrose,

  Tell you secrets when they find you all alone?
  Or the Birds and Butterflies whisper
  Of things to us unknown?

  Or do angel voices speak to you so softly,
  When _we_ only hear a little wind sigh;
  And the peaceful dew of Heaven fall upon you
  When _we_ only see a white cloud passing by?

CHILD'S SONG.


  The King and the Queen were riding
    Upon a Summer's day,
  And a Blackbird flew above them,
    To hear what they did say.

  The King said he liked apples,
    The Queen said she liked pears.
  And what shall we do to the Blackbird
    Who listens unawares.

MISS MOLLY AND THE LITTLE FISHES.


  Oh, sweet Miss Molly,
  You're so fond
  Of Fishes in a little Pond.
  And perhaps they're glad
  To see you stare
  With such bright eyes
  Upon them there.
  And when your fingers and your thumbs
  Drop slowly in the small white crumbs
  I hope they're happy. Only this--
  When you've looked long enough, sweet miss.
  Then, most beneficent young giver,
  Restore them to their native river.

THE LITTLE JUMPING GIRLS.


[Illustration]

  Jump--jump--jump--
    Jump away
  From this town into
    The next, to-day.

  Jump--jump--jump--
    Jump over the moon;
  Jump all the morning,
    And all the noon.

  Jump--jump--jump--
    Jump all night;
  Won't our mothers
    Be in a fright?

  Jump--jump--jump--
    Over the sea;
  What wonderful wonders
    We shall see.

  Jump--jump--jump--
    And leave behind
  Everything evil
    That we may find.

  Jump--jump--jump--
    Jump far away;
  And all come home
    Some other day.

RING-A-RING.


  Ring-a-ring of little boys.
    Ring-a-ring of girls;
  All around--all around,
    Twists and twirls.

[Illustration]

  You are merry children;
    "Yes, we are."
  Where do you come from?
    "Not very far.

  "We live in the mountain,
    We live in the tree;
  And I live in the river-bed,
    And you won't catch me!"

ON THE BRIDGE.


  If I could see a little fish--
  That is what I just now wish!
  I want to see his great round eyes
  Always open in surprise.

  I wish a water rat would glide
  Slowly to the other side;
  Or a dancing spider sit
  On the yellow flags a bit.

  I think I'll get some stones to throw,
  And watch the pretty circles show.
  Or shall we sail a flower-boat,
  And watch it slowly--slowly float?

  That's nice--because you never know
  How far away it means to go;
  And when to-morrow comes, you see,
  It may be in the great wide sea.

BALL.


  One--two, is one to you:
  One--two--three, is one to me.
  Throw it fast or not at all,
  And mind you do not let it fall.

  Fairy Blue Eyes
    And Fairy Brown,
  And dear little Golden Curls,
    Look down.
  I say "Good-bye"--
    "Good-bye" with no pain--
  Till some happy day
    We meet again!
