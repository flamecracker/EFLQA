[Illustration: THE LITTLE WOMAN AND THE PEDLAR]


[Music:

  There was a little woman, as I've heard say,
      _Fol, lol, diddle, diddle dol;_
  She went to market, her eggs for to sell,
      _Fol, lol, diddle, diddle dol._
  She went to market all on a market day,
  And she fell asleep upon the king's highway;
      _Fol de rol de lol lol lol lol lol,_
      _Fol, lol, diddle, diddle dol._]

2 And there came a pedlar whose name was Stout,
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  He cut her petticoats all round about,
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  He cut her petticoats up to her knees,
  Which made the little woman to shiver and freeze,
      _Fol de rol, &c._

3 When the little woman began to awake,
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  She began to shiver, and she began to shake,
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  She began to shake, and she began to cry,
  Lawk-a-mercy on me! this is none of I,
      _Fol de rol, &c._

4 If it be I, as I suppose it be,
      _Fol lol, &c.,_
  I've a little dog at home, and he knows me;
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  If it be I, he will wag his little tail,
  If it be not I, he will bark and rail,
      _Fol de rol, &c._

5 And when the little woman went home in the dark,
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  Her little dog he did begin to bark,
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  He began to bark, and she began to cry,
  Lawk-a-mercy on me! this is none of I,
      _Fol de rol, &c._




[Illustration: THE LITTLE DISASTER]


[Music:

    Once there lived a little man,
    Where a little river ran,
  And he had a little farm and little dairy O!
    And he had a little plough,
    And a little dappled cow,
  Which he often called his pretty little Fairy O!]

2   And his dog he called Fidelle,
    For he loved his master well;
  And he had a little pony for his pleasure O!
    In a sty not very big
    He'd a frisky little pig,
  Which he often called his little piggy treasure O!

3   Once his little maiden, Ann,
    With her pretty little can,
  Went a-milking when the morning sun was beaming O!
    When she fell, I don't know how,
    But she stumbled o'er the plough,
  And the cow was quite astonished at her screaming O!

4   Little maid cried out in vain,
    While the milk ran o'er the plain,
  Little pig ran grunting after it so gaily O!
    While the little dog behind,
    For a share was much inclined,
  So he pulled back squeaking piggy by the taily O!

5   Such a clatter now began
    As alarmed the little man,
  Who came capering from out his little stable O!
    Pony trod on doggy's toes,
    Doggy snapped at piggy's nose,
  Piggy made as great a noise as he was able O!

6   Then to make the story short,
    Little pony with a snort
  Lifted up his little heels so very clever O!
    And the man he tumbled down,
    And he nearly cracked his crown,
  And this only made the matter worse than ever O!

[Illustration: THE OLD WOMAN OF NORWICH]


[Music:

There was an old woman and what do you think?
She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;
Victuals and drink were the chief of her diet,
Yet this plaguey old woman could never be quiet.]




[Illustration: THE OLD WOMAN TOSSED UP IN A BLANKET]


[Music:

There was an old woman tossed up in a blanket,
Seventeen times as high as the moon;
Where she was going I could not but ask it,
For in her hand she carried a broom.
"Old woman, old woman, old woman," quoth I;
"O whither, O whither, O whither so high?"
"To sweep the cobwebs from the sky,
And I'll be with you by-and-by!"]




[Illustration: BUY A BROOM]


[Music:

From Deutschland I come with my light wares all laden,
To dear happy England in summer's gay bloom;

Come buy of the wandering Baierin a broom;
A large one for the lady, and a small one for the baby,
Come buy ye, pretty lady, come buy ye a broom.]

    There was a little man
    And he woo'd a little maid,
  And he said, "Little maid, will you wed, wed, wed?
    I have little more to say
    Than 'will you, yea or nay?'
  For least said is soonest mended-ded-ded-ded."]

2   The little maid replied,
    (Some say a little sighed,)
  "But what shall we have to eat, eat, eat?
    "Will the love that you're rich in
    "Make a fire in the kitchen?
  "Or the little god of love turn the spit, spit, spit?"

    I love nothing better than my wife.

[Music:

  If all the world were paper,
  And all the sea were ink,
  And all the trees were bread and cheese,
  What should we do for drink?]

2 If all the world were sand--O!
  Oh, then what should we lack--O!
  If, as they say, there were no clay,

[Music:

  A ship, a ship a-sailing,
    A-sailing on the sea,

    With pretty things for me;
  There were raisins in the cabin,
    And almonds in the hold;
  The sails were made of satin,
     And the mast it was of gold.]

2 The four-and-twenty sailors
    That stood between the decks,
  Were four-and-twenty white mice
    With rings about their necks.
  The captain was a duck, a duck,
    With a jacket on his back,
  And when this fairy ship set sail,
    The captain he said, "Quack!"

  Ich ging im Walde,

  Wie Sterne leuchtend,
    Wie Aeuglein schön.

3 Ich wollt' es brechen
    Da sagt es fein:
  "Soll ich zum Welken

4 Ich grub's mit allen
    Den Würzlein aus,
  Zum Garten trug ich's
    Am hübschen Haus.

5 Und pflanzt es wieder
    Am stillen Ort;
  Nun zweigt es immer
    Und blüht so fort.--(_Goethe._)

    And the bells did ring--
  Did ever you hear
    So merry a thing?

    That of all the flies
  The humble bee
    Should carry the prize.
