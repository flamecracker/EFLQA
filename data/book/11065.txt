A FEW WORDS TO THE TEACHER.


When Little Mary (or any other little girl or boy) knows all the letters
perfectly, let the teacher turn over a page and pronounce one of the
mono-syllables. Do not say _a, m, am_--but say _am_ at once, and point
to the word. When the child knows that word, then point to the next,
and say _as_, and be sure to follow the same plan throughout the book.
Spelling lessons may be taught at a more advanced age; but it will be
found that a young child will learn to read much more quickly if they be
dispensed with in the Primer. In words of more than one syllable, it is
best to pronounce each syllable separately, _car, pet_,--_po, ker_,--and
so on. In the lesson on "Things in the Room," point out each thing as
the child reads the word, and indeed, wherever you can, try to associate
the word with its actual meaning. Show a child the word _coach_ as a
coach goes past, and she will recollect that word again for ever. In the
"Lesson on the Senses," make the child understand how to feel cold and
heat, by touching a piece of cold iron or marble, and by holding the
hand to the fire,--how to smell, to hear, to see, and to taste. In the
"Lesson on Colours," be sure to show each colour as it is read; and
endeavour to make every Lesson as interesting as you can. _Never weary
a child with long lessons_. The little poem at the end is intended to be
read to the child frequently, that she may gradually learn it by heart.

Do you see the man Angling. He is trying to catch fish with a hook and
a line.

That man is shooting partridges. The dog finds them for him in the
fields.

Oh, what fun! two boys riding a race on Donkeys to see which will get
home first.

The poor hare runs away from the dogs. I fear they will catch her.

Here are some boys and girls at play. The man is smoking his pipe at
the door.

What a pleasant ride they will have in the Park on those Donkeys.

MY MOTHER.


  Who fed me from her gentle breast,
  And hush'd me in her arms to rest,
  And on my cheek sweet kisses prest?
    My Mother.

  When sleep forsook my open eyes,
  Who was it sung sweet lullaby,
  And soothed me that I should not cry?
    My Mother.

  Who sat and watch'd my infant head,
  When sleeping on my cozy bed;
  And tears of sweet affection shed?
    My Mother.

  Who lov'd to see me pleased and gay,
  And taught me sweetly how to play,
  And minded all I had to say?
    My Mother.

  Who ran to help me when I fell.
  And would some pretty story tell.
  Or kiss the place and make it well?
    My Mother.

  Who taught my infant heart to pray,
  And love God's holy book and day;
  And taught me wisdom's pleasant way?
    My Mother.

  And can I ever cease to be
  Affectionate and kind to thee,
  Who was so very kind to me,
    My Mother?

  Ah, no! the thought I cannot bear,
  And if God please my life to spare,
  I hope I shall reward thy care,
    My Mother.

  And when I see thee hang thy head,
  'Twill be my turn to watch thy bed,
  And tears of sweet affection shed,
    My Mother.

  For God, who lives above the skies,
  Would look with vengeance in his eyes,
  If I should ever dare despise
    My Mother.
