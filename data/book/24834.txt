                         A TOY-SHOP.

    [Illustration: TOY WAREHOUSE.]


    "Pray, what would you like?" said a Toyman, one day,
      Addressing a group of young folks,
    "I have toys in abundance, and very cheap, too,
      Though not quite so cheap as my jokes.



    "Here's a famous managerie, full of wild beasts;
      See! this lion with wide open jaws,
    Enough to affright one, and yet I've no doubt,
      You might venture to play with his claws.

    [Illustration]

    "Here's a tiger as tame as a lap-dog, you'll find,
      And a fox that will not steal the geese:
    So here you must own the old adage is proved,
      That wonders are never to cease."



    "Here's wagon well laden, and here is a dray,
      With horses and harness complete;
    You can drive them in parlour and drawing-room, too,
      As easily as in the street.

    [Illustration]

    "Here's a whole file of soldiers, quite ready for fight,
      And each of them armed with a gun;
    You may knock them all down with a feather, and then
      You may pocket them--every one.



    "Here's a fine stud of horses, which, strange though it sounds,
      Live neither on corn nor on hay;
    A gentleman's carriage, and tilbury, too,
      For which we've no taxes to pay.

    [Illustration]

    "A coachman so plump, and a footman so tall,
      Who cost not a penny for food;
    For to tell you the truth, all their insides are filled
      With a permanent dinner of wood.



    "Examine this sword, with its handle and sheath,
      And its blade made of innocent wood;
    'Twere well if all swords were as harmless as this,
      And as equally guiltless of blood.

    [Illustration]

    "Here's a mill that will go without water or wind,
      A wonder, you cannot deny;
    I really can't say whether it will grind corn,
      But it will be easy to try.



    That iron-gray rocking-horse, close at your side,
      With saddle and bridle complete,
    Will go without whipping, and, equally strange,
      Without making use of his feet:

    [Illustration]

    "Yet, stranger than that--whatsoever his pace,
      Whether canter, or gallop, or trot,
    Though moving at ten miles an hour--he ne'er
      Advances one inch from the spot.



    "A full set of bricks is enclosed in this box,
      (With the mortar we well may dispense,)
    But with these you may build a magnificent house,
      Without e'en a farthing's expense.

    [Illustration]

    "With these you may raise up a Royal Exchange,
      In less than five minutes, and then
    Knock it down, and build up a new Parliament House,
      In another five minutes,--or ten.



    "A doll's pretty kitchen, stands next on the shelf,
      With grate, pans, and kettle, and pot;
    With dish and tureen, and all crockery-ware,
      Knives and forks, and I cannot tell what;

    [Illustration]

    "They would not quite do for a great city feast,
      But I think I may venture to say
    A minnow or tittlebat there might be cooked,
      As a rarity
