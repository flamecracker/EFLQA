THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN:

_Showing how he went father than he intended, and came safe home again._

[Illustration: WRITTEN BY Wm. COWPER WITH DRAWINGS BY R. CALDECOTT]


    John Gilpin was a citizen
        Of credit and renown,
    A train-band captain eke was he,
        Of famous London town.

    John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,
        "Though wedded we have been
    These twice ten tedious years, yet we
        No holiday have seen.

    "To-morrow is our wedding-day,
        And we will then repair
    Unto the 'Bell' at Edmonton,
        All in a chaise and pair.

    "My sister, and my sister's child,
        Myself, and children three,
    Will fill the chaise; so you must ride
        On horseback after we."

        [Illustration: The Linendraper bold]

    He soon replied, "I do admire
        Of womankind but one,
    And you are she, my dearest dear,
        Therefore it shall be done.

    "I am a linendraper bold,
        As all the world doth know,
    And my good friend the calender
        Will lend his horse to go."

        [Illustration]

    Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, "That's well said;
        And for that wine is dear,
    We will be furnished with our own,
        Which is both bright and clear."

    John Gilpin kissed his loving wife;
        O'erjoyed was he to find,
    That though on pleasure she was bent,
        She had a frugal mind.

        [Illustration]

    The morning came, the chaise was brought,
        But yet was not allowed
    To drive up to the door, lest all
        Should say that she was proud.

    So three doors off the chaise was stayed,
        Where they did all get in;
    Six precious souls, and all agog
        To dash through thick and thin.

    Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,
        Were never folks so glad!
    The stones did rattle underneath,
        As if Cheapside were mad.

    John Gilpin at his horse's side
        Seized fast the flowing mane,
    And up he got, in haste to ride,
        But soon came down again;

        [Illustration: The 3 Customers]

    For saddletree scarce reached had he,
        His journey to begin,
    When, turning round his head, he saw
        Three customers come in.

    So down he came; for loss of time,
        Although it grieved him sore,
    Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,
        Would trouble him much more.

        [Illustration]

    'Twas long before the customers
        Were suited to their mind,
    When Betty screaming came downstairs,
        "The wine is left behind!"

    "Good lack!" quoth he, "yet bring it me,
        My leathern belt likewise,
    In which I bear my trusty sword
        When I do exercise."

    Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)
        Had two stone bottles found,
    To hold the liquor that she loved,
        And keep it safe and sound.

    Each bottle had a curling ear,
        Through which the belt he drew
    And hung a bottle on each side,
        To make his balance true.

        [Illustration]

    Then over all, that he might be
        Equipped from top to toe,
    His long red cloak, well brushed and neat,
        He manfully did throw.

    Now see him mounted once again
        Upon his nimble steed,
    Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,
        With caution and good heed.

    But finding soon a smoother road
        Beneath his well-shod feet,
    The snorting beast began to trot,
        Which galled him in his seat.

        [Illustration]

    "So, fair and softly!" John he cried,
        But John he cried in vain;
    That trot became a gallop soon,
        In spite of curb and rein.

    So stooping down, as needs he must
        Who cannot sit upright,
    He grasped the mane with both his hands,
        And eke with all his might.

    His horse, who never in that sort
        Had handled been before,
    What thing upon his back had got,
        Did wonder more and more.

    Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;
        Away went hat and wig;
    He little dreamt, when he set out,
        Of running such a rig.

    The wind did blow, the cloak did fly
        Like streamer long and gay,
    Till, loop and button failing both,
        At last it flew away.

        [Illustration]

    Then might all people well discern
        The bottles he had slung;
    A bottle swinging at each side,
        As hath been said or sung.

    The dogs did bark, the children screamed,
        Up flew the windows all;
    And every soul cried out, "Well done!"
        As loud as he could bawl.

        [Illustration]

    Away went Gilpin--who but he?
        His fame soon spread around;
    "He carries weight! he rides a race!
        'Tis for a thousand pound!"

        [Illustration]

    And still as fast as he drew near,
        'Twas wonderful to view
    How in a trice the turnpike-men
        Their gates wide open threw.

        [Illustration]

    And now, as he went bowing down
        His reeking head full low,
    The bottles twain behind his back
        Were shattered at a blow.

    Down ran the wine into the road,
        Most piteous to be seen,
    Which made the horse's flanks to smoke,
        As they had basted been.

        [Illustration]

    But still he seemed to carry weight,
        With leathern girdle braced;
    For all might see the bottle-necks
        Still dangling at his waist.

        [Illustration]

    Thus all through merry Islington
        These gambols he did play,
    Until he came unto the Wash
        Of Edmonton so gay;

    And there he threw the wash about
        On both sides of the way,
    Just like unto a trundling mop,
        Or a wild goose at play.

        [Illustration]

    At Edmonton his loving wife
        From the balcony spied
    Her tender husband, wondering much
        To see how he did ride.

    "Stop, stop, John Gilpin!--Here's the house!"
        They all at once did cry;
    "The dinner waits, and we are tired;"
        Said Gilpin--"So am I!"

        [Illustration]

    But yet his horse was not a whit
        Inclined to tarry there;
    For why?--his owner had a house
        Full ten miles off, at Ware.

    So like an arrow swift he flew,
        Shot by an archer strong;
    So did he fly--which brings me to
        The middle of my song.

        [Illustration]

    Away went Gilpin, out of breath,
        And sore against his will,
    Till at his friend the calender's
        His horse at last stood still.

    The calender, amazed to see
        His neighbour in such trim,
    Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,
        And thus accosted him:

        [Illustration]

    "What news? what news? your tidings tell;
        Tell me you must and shall--
    Say why bareheaded you are come,
        Or why you come at all?"

    Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,
        And loved a timely joke;
    And thus unto the calender
        In merry guise he spoke:

    "I came because your horse would come:
        And, if I well forebode,
    My hat and wig will soon be here,
        They are upon the road."

    The calender, right glad to find
        His friend in merry pin,
    Returned him not a single word,
        But to the house went in;

        [Illustration]

    Whence straight he came with hat and wig,
        A wig that flowed behind,
    A hat not much the worse for wear,
        Each comely in its kind.

    He held them up, and in his turn
        Thus showed his ready wit:
    "My head is twice as big as yours,
        They therefore needs must fit."

        [Illustration]

    "But let me scrape the dirt away,
        That hangs upon your face;
    And stop and eat, for well you may
        Be in a hungry case."

    Said John, "It is my wedding-day,
        And all the world would stare
    If wife should dine at Edmonton,
        And I should dine at Ware."

    So turning to his horse, he said
        "I am in haste to dine;
    'Twas for your pleasure you came here,
        You shall go back for mine."

    Ah! luckless speech, and bootless boast
        For which he paid full dear;
    For while he spake, a braying ass
        Did sing most loud and clear;

    Whereat his horse did snort, as he
        Had heard a lion roar,
    And galloped off with all his might,
        As he had done before.

        [Illustration]

    Away went Gilpin, and away
        Went Gilpin's hat and wig;
    He lost them sooner than at first,
        For why?--they were too big.

        [Illustration]

    Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw
        Her husband posting down
    Into the country far away,
        She pulled out half-a-crown;

    And thus unto the youth she said
        That drove them to the "Bell,"
    "This shall be yours when you bring back
        My husband safe and well."

        [Illustration]

    The youth did ride, and soon did meet
        John coming back amain;
    Whom in a trice he tried to stop,
        By catching at his rein.

    But not performing what he meant,
        And gladly would have done,
    The frighted steed he frighted more,
        And made him faster run.

    Away went Gilpin, and away
        Went postboy at his heels,
    The postboy's horse right glad to miss
        The lumbering of the wheels.

        [Illustration]

    Six gentlemen upon the road,
        Thus seeing Gilpin fly,
    With postboy scampering in the rear,
        They raised the hue and cry.

    "Stop thief! stop thief! a highwayman!"
        Not one of them was mute;
    And all and each that passed that way
        Did join in the pursuit.

        [Illustration: To London. To Ware.]

    And now the turnpike-gates again
        Flew open in short space;
    The toll-man thinking, as before,
        That Gilpin rode a race.

        [Illustration]

    And so he did, and won it too,
        For he got first to town;
    Nor stopped till where he had got up,
        He did again get down.

    Now let us sing, Long live the King,
        And Gilpin, long live he;
    And when he next doth ride abroad,
        May I be there to see.

    Good people all, of every sort,

        [Illustration]

        [Illustration: To the Angel]

    In Islington there lived a man,
      Of whom the world might say,
    That still a godly race he ran,

        [Illustration]

      Whene'er he went

        [Illustration]

                       to pray.

        [Illustration]

    A kind and gentle heart he had,

        [Illustration]

        [Illustration]

    And in that town a dog was found:
      As many dogs there be--

        [Illustration]

    Both mongrel, puppy, whelp,
                                and hound,

THE BABES IN THE WOOD

[Illustration: SORE SICKE THEY WERE AND LIKE TO DYE]


        [Illustration]

    Now ponder well, you parents deare,
      These wordes which I shall write;
    A doleful story you shall heare,
      In time brought forth to light.

    A gentleman of good account
      In Norfolke dwelt of late,
    Who did in honour far surmount
      Most men of his estate.

    Sore sicke he was, and like to dye,
      No helpe his life could save;
    His wife by him as sicke did lye,
      And both possest one grave.

        [Illustration]

    No love between these two was lost,
      Each was to other kinde;
    In love they liv'd, in love they dyed,
      And left two babes behinde:

    The one a fine and pretty boy,
      Not passing three yeares olde;
    The other a girl more young than he
      And fram'd in beautye's molde.

    The father left his little son,
      As plainlye doth appeare,
    When he to perfect age should come
      Three hundred poundes a yeare.

    And to his little daughter Jane
      Five hundred poundes in gold,
    To be paid downe on marriage-day,
      Which might not be controll'd:

        [Illustration]

    But if the children chanced to dye,
      Ere they to age should come,
    Their uncle should possesse their wealth;
      For so the wille did run.

        [Illustration: NOW, BROTHER, said the dying man,
         LOOK TO MY CHILDREN DEARE]

    "Now, brother," said the dying man,
      "Look to my children deare;
    Be good unto my boy and girl,
      No friendes else have they here:

    "To God and you I do commend
      My children deare this daye;
    But little while be sure we have
      Within this world to staye.

    "You must be father and mother both,
      And uncle all in one;
    God knowes what will become of them,
      When I am dead and gone."

        [Illustration]

    With that bespake their mother deare:
      "O brother kinde," quoth shee,
    "You are the man must bring our babes
      To wealth or miserie:

        [Illustration]

        [Illustration]

    "And if you keep them carefully,
      Then God will you reward;
    But if you otherwise should deal,
      God will your deedes regard."

        [Illustration: WITH LIPPES AS COLD AS ANY STONE,
         THEY KIST THE CHILDREN SMALL]

    With lippes as cold as any stone,
      They kist the children small:

    He had not kept these pretty babes
      A twelvemonth and a daye,
    But, for their wealth, he did devise
      To make them both awaye.

    He bargain'd with two ruffians strong,
      Which were of furious mood,
    That they should take the children young,
      And slaye them in a wood.

        [Illustration]

    He told his wife an artful tale,
      He would the children send
    To be brought up in faire London,
      With one that was his friend.

        [Illustration]

    Away then went those pretty babes,

      And work their lives' decaye:

    So that the pretty speeche they had,
      Made murderers' heart relent:
    And they that undertooke the deed,
      Full sore did now repent.

    Yet one of them, more hard of heart,
      Did vow to do his charge,
    Because the wretch, that hired him,
      Had paid him very large.

        [Illustration]

    The other would not agree thereto,
      So here they fell to strife;
    With one another they did fight,

      As babes wanting relief.

    No burial these prettye babes
