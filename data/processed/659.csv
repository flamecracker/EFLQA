Paul had a successful day in his prize-package business. He managed to sell all his stock at a good profit by 11 o'clock. Unlike larger merchants struggling to cover expenses, Paul had minimal costs as he operated single-handedly without rent or clerk hire. His only expenses were the initial stock costs, which he priced to ensure a good profit. Pleased with his first day's results, Paul's friend Teddy wanted to join him but lacked the capital. Street boys like Paul and Teddy are enterprising, keeping their business ideas secret to avoid competition. Paul lived with his mother in three well-furnished rooms in a New York tenement-house, saved from their previous prosperity. Paul's father, a skilled cabinetmaker, met a tragic end in an accident, leading to their move downtown and financial struggles.|"[""1.

Just then, Mrs. Donovan, a kind Irishwoman, offered to do some sewing for Mrs. Hoffman, acknowledging the difference in their lifestyles. Meanwhile, a fight broke out between Teddy and Mike over the division of profits from selling packages.

Paul had been in the prize-package business for three weeks. His earnings fluctuated, but he always made at least seventy-five cents daily, sometimes reaching a dollar and a quarter. Despite competitors occasionally taking his spot, Paul moved on to secure a better location for his trade. On the other hand, Teddy O'Brien chose to return to his previous venture, the blacking-box, after facing trouble with Mike and Jim. The two boys, known for their dishonest ways, devised a plan to steal Paul's prize packages. However, Paul, wary of their intentions, remained vigilant. Mike and Jim plotted to distract Paul while one of them snatched the basket, but Jim hesitated due to fear of Paul's strength and mistrust of Mike's intentions.|"[""1.

Paul and his little brother, Jimmy, walked along Liberty street up to Nassau. They spotted a person they knew, unconscious in a public spot. Despite the odd location for an attack, Paul and Jimmy, driven by a mix of greed and animosity, pursued the perpetrator, Mike. Paul, a quick thinker, chased after Mike, who had tricked him. A policeman, aware of Mike's shady past, shared his thoughts on the situation. Despite a collision with a stout man, Paul continued his pursuit until it was futile. Meanwhile, Jimmy, with no formal training, excelled at drawing. After a laughter-inducing attempt at drawing by Paul, they enjoyed a modest Sunday dinner.

Paul, despite having his business stolen, remained optimistic. He ventured to Broadway after a setback with his prize-package business. He met a sidewalk merchant selling neckties and offered to help. George Barry, who lived with his mother, agreed to let Paul take over the stand. George earned money sewing and from Paul's sales, supporting them comfortably. Though they had savings, George preferred not to touch it. Paul was eager to succeed, seeing this opportunity as a step up. Unlike George, Paul was energetic and had a knack for sales. As Paul took charge, George felt relieved, knowing Paul's skills could help them stay afloat without dipping into their savings.|"['1.

Paul was pleased with his sales performance. In just fifteen minutes, he had already reached half of his average daily sales. Calculating his profits, he estimated three shillings, which he found satisfactory. Paul's ability to engage with customers had significantly increased his sales. A skilled salesman can persuade customers to buy more than they initially intended, as Paul did with selling six neckties to one customer. Despite some slow periods, by the end of the day, Paul had sold a total of fifteen neckties. He transferred his remaining stock to a nearby office, a convenient arrangement made by George Barry when Paul started his street merchant business. Following a successful day of sales, Paul returned home to enjoy a simple but satisfying meal with his family, appreciating the comfort and contentment of their modest surroundings.|"[""1.

After a brief chat, Paul left, concerned about the sick man. He suggested visiting the next evening, but George Barry felt it was too much to ask for daily visits. Paul walked home slowly, dreaming of owning the newsstand to double his income. His mother sewed shirts to support the family, while Jimmy, too young to work, studied at home. Paul admired his mother's hard work but wished she didn't have to toil so much. He hoped to ease her burden someday. Despite their struggles, they remained hopeful. Mrs. Hoffman, recalling happier times, headed home, determined to find more work. Paul, a reliable and brave young man, knew they could endure any hardship as long as he could work.|"['1.

Mrs. Hoffman went out in the afternoon to find work, but was met with rejection due to the slow business. She couldn't take up washing as she wasn't physically fit, and her son Paul, proud but reluctant, wouldn't allow it either. Paul, in his new business, sold eighteen ties on the first full day, earning a dollar and twelve cents. The next morning, a man approached Paul, and he recognized him from a previous encounter. The man offered Paul a job that could pay well. Meanwhile, Mrs. Hoffman continued to struggle to find work. She contemplated consulting Paul if her job hunt failed. Paul reassured his mother that he would find work even if he had to resort to bootblacking.

When my employer passed away, my apprenticeship ended at eighteen. Without money, I relied on my own abilities. Despite my farming knowledge, I preferred trade. So, I partnered with a village merchant to sell goods on commission. Politeness and adaptability helped me increase sales. Eventually, a traveling salesman offered me a position in New York, leading to success. I saved, bought into the business, and now I'm a senior partner. Paul, inspired by my story, dreamed of lifting his family from poverty. On his way home, he encountered a bully, Mike, but bravely stood up to him.

Paul walked back, searching for the shirt he had set down before the fight. It was gone, along with Mike's friend. Losing the shirt was frustrating. It wasn't just about the value, but it was borrowed as a model for his mother to make Mr. Preston's shirts. Paul felt uneasy. He decided to return to Mr. Preston, explain the situation, and ask for a replacement. Despite fearing Mr. Preston might doubt him, Paul knew it was the right thing to do. He boarded a passing car as it was late. Meanwhile, Mrs. Hoffman, a customer of Mr. Preston's, struggled with a heavy bundle at a store counter.

Meanwhile, the employer overheard the conversation and was known for demanding courtesy towards all customers from his employees. Mrs. Hoffman, grateful for the employer's intervention, left the store. Mike's companion, Jerry, slyly took a shirt during Mike's distraction. Jerry cared little for the outcome of the scuffle as long as he gained something. This behavior displeased both Mike and Paul. While Mike sought Jerry's help, Jerry selfishly ignored him. Jerry disappeared into an alley to try on the stolen shirt, discarding his old, worn one. His habit was to wear clothes until they were unusable, displaying a false sense of wealth due to the larger size of the shirt. Mike, feeling cheated, confronted Jerry the next day, but Jerry's carefree attitude only fueled Mike's anger. Jerry, a lazy opportunist with loose morals, had a history of trouble due to his thieving ways.|"[""1.

Jerry, with an empty stomach, walked to a city market hoping to steal food. He was skilled at stealing barrels, which were valuable to coopers. Barrels fetched twenty-five cents each, a tempting reward for young thieves. Jerry roamed the market seeking an opportunity to grab an apple or banana, but the vigilant stand owners thwarted his plans. Feeling hungry and regretful, Jerry wished he had sold his new shirt for fifty cents to buy breakfast and cigars. While pretending to casually inspect a barrel, he plotted to steal it. Unbeknownst to him, a policeman observed his scheme and apprehended him. The next day, Mrs. Hoffman joyfully sewed shirts for Mr. Preston, earning five dollars a week instead of a dollar and a half. Jimmy diligently painted a picture of a farmer in a cart, showcasing his talent. False pride hindered a job-seeking man from accepting a porter position, highlighting the importance of humility.|"['1.

Mrs. Montgomery wore a simple, modest dress that stood out against the fashionable trends of the time. Her attire, almost Quaker-like in its simplicity, included a plain collar and brown silk gloves.
