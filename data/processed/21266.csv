"In 1894, the writer noticed children's keen interest in birds during nature study. The children joyfully described the birds they observed, eager to share their sightings not out of competition but to enhance everyone's knowledge on the subject. To further this enthusiasm, the concept of ""Bird Day"" was proposed. Secretary J. Sterling Morton, known for ""Arbor Day,"" endorsed the idea. He highlighted the importance of protecting native birds, cautioning against harmful practices like using feathers in fashion or harming birds for sport. Morton stressed the educational value of studying birds, emphasizing the positive qualities they exhibit and the essential role they play in maintaining ecological balance. He believed that instilling a sense of respect for birds in young minds could help counter destructive behaviors inherited from the past, fostering a culture of appreciation and conservation."|"[""1.

If we had to choose between birds and quadrupeds, most of us would likely choose to keep the four-footed animals. Losing them would be a greater disaster than losing fish. Quadrupeds provide a larger portion of our food supply and contribute to our comfort and needs in many ways. Most nations value animals with hoofs, horns, and even claws. Laws now forbid cruelty to animals, and their destruction would be horrifying. While life would become more challenging without quadrupeds, it would still be possible with fish and fowl as a limited meat source. However, if birds were completely destroyed, insect populations would explode and threaten all plant and animal life, including humans. Birds are essential to control insect populations and maintain the balance of nature. Their preservation is crucial not only for sentiment but also for the practical benefits they provide in protecting our ecosystems.|['1.

The brown thrush, once abundant in this area, is now scarce. A local farmer recalls a time when the treetops were filled with their melodic songs, but now only hears a few each season. Despite finding three nests last May, they were destroyed before hatching, leaving the birds silent. The clearing of forests and settlement of the land have contributed to their decline, but a major factor is the use of bird feathers and skins for fashion. The cruel practice of using dead birds for adornment has led to the demise of many songbirds. The wanton destruction of birds for fashion and sport is a tragic loss to our ecosystems. Let's hope for a shift in societal values to protect these beautiful and beneficial creatures.|"['1.

Laws to protect birds have been passed in many states, but they are most effective where they are not needed. Understanding birds, their lifestyles, and their role in nature is crucial. Knowing a bird leads to loving it. Children are naturally drawn to nature and its beauty, including birds. Marjorie Fleming, a child prodigy, found joy in the company of animals. Nature study in schools can bridge the gap between a child's interests and their education, fostering a love for learning. By observing birds and answering questions about them, students can develop observational skills and language proficiency. Teachers can enhance this by using binoculars and organizing field trips. Encouraging children to observe and describe birds can spark their curiosity and improve their language skills.|"['1.

Continue working on these inquiries until each student can provide a somewhat accurate depiction of the bird's appearance and movements. Encourage older students to write this down, as it will serve as a valuable language exercise. The subsequent questions should focus on the bird's lifestyle and traits. What does it consume? Offer crumbs or meat scraps to observe its eating habits. What noises does it produce? Can it sing? Try to mimic its sounds. Assess its temperament based on its actions. Is it brave? Aggressive? Does it tend to fight? Is it selfish? Often, a single event in a bird's life can answer several of these queries. For instance, observing two sparrows engaged in a tug-of-war over a straw can reveal much about their behavior. Encourage students to pay attention to sparrows' flight directions in early March to witness nest-building behaviors. They will notice variations in nest construction styles and locations, providing insights into the birds' habits throughout the breeding season. Following a similar approach with other bird species can lead to even more fascinating discoveries.|"[""1.

After a few days of studying birds, direct the children to conduct experiments. Spread crumbs where they can be seen from windows. Hang cups in trees with sugar water and seeds. Attach bones and suet to attract birds needing food in cold weather. Observe the birds attracted to the food. They will become tame and approachable. Describe each bird like the English sparrow. Encourage kids to share their observations to understand bird habits and character. The blue jay stands out with its appearance and voice, showing gentlemanly traits. They wait in line to feed, displaying patience. The blue jay is a caring parent despite not being favored by other birds. Their song is sweet and reminiscent. The black-capped titmouse is lively, cheerful, and well-groomed. Their simple song is heard even on cold days. Woodpeckers are focused on their work, undisturbed by observers. A woodpecker in a classroom captivated students, improving their focus. Watching him fly off after healing brought joy to all.|"[""1.

"During January, various birds like the flicker, crow, purple finch, and more visit feeders. Sparrow hawks and sharp-shinned hawks may also come for prey. A sparrow hawk was spotted in a city, hunting sparrows. In New York, a female sparrow hawk lived on English sparrows. A sharp-shinned hawk once fed on sparrows in a yard. As spring nears, more birds arrive. A girl identified 17 bird species in her yard in April. She fed chipping sparrows, who returned with their young. Another child had scarlet tanagers and rose-breasted grosbeaks nest in their yard. Bluebirds are azure blue with a pleasing warble. Chickadees have a familiar ""chic-a-dee-dee"" call. Catbirds are slate-colored with a cat-like cry. Meadow larks have a plaintive whistle and nest in open fields. Barn swallows have glossy steel blue upper parts and nest in barns."|"['1.

"The Wood Thrush is a small bird measuring about eight inches in length with a wingspan of thirteen inches. It has flesh-colored legs and feet, a blackish bill that is lighter at the base, and its upper parts are cinnamon brown, brightest on the head, and shading into olive near the tail. The lower parts are white with roundish, dusky spots. The Wood Thrush arrives in May and leaves in October, and its song is sweet and bell-like. Schools should have a bird manual for identifying species. Recommended books include ""Birds of the United States"" by A. C. Apgar and ""Birds of Eastern North America"" by Frank M. Chapman. Students are encouraged to put up boxes for martins, bluebirds, and wrens around the school grounds to attract them.

Encourage your group of explorers to observe birds closely, jotting down their findings in a notebook for comparison later. This method helps improve the speed and accuracy of observation. There are two ways to approach birds: first, find a spot where birds have been spotted and quietly wait for them to come close. Some shy birds may even approach within a few feet. By imitating bird sounds like an owl or using specific calls, you can attract various birds for a closer look. The second method involves quietly following a bird to study its behavior, like watching a shore lark feed on insects. Even in urban areas, parks offer opportunities to observe and befriend birds. For example, Central Park in New York and Boston Common are known for their diverse bird populations.|['1.

The study of birds can be enhanced by using a camera. If someone has a camera, like a kodak, they can capture valuable pictures of birds in the wild or even in the backyard. While capturing birds in flight can be challenging, taking pictures of birds on nests, feeding their young, or protecting their nests in trees can be successful. Pictures of birds' nests with eggs can be fascinating. It's important for the pictures to be true to nature without any alterations for them to have genuine value for naturalists. Children should not be encouraged to collect birds or eggs. Instead, they can collect nests after the birds have finished using them, especially nests with known family histories. Observing birds in their natural habitat is crucial as they play a vital role in maintaining the balance of insect populations.|"['1.

Mr. E. H. Forbush, an expert on birds from the Board of Agriculture of Massachusetts, found that chickadees play a vital role in controlling harmful insects. For instance, four chickadees were discovered to have consumed over 1,000 eggs of the cankerworm. Another four birds of the same species had eaten about 600 eggs and 105 female moths of the cankerworm. This means that each chickadee could potentially destroy around 138,750 eggs of this harmful insect during the time the moths are active. Similarly, the pamphlet from the Department of Agriculture of the United States highlights how birds like the cuckoo and woodpecker are beneficial to ecosystems. The cuckoo, often misunderstood, eats caterpillars and hairy insects that other birds avoid. Woodpeckers are skilled at locating and consuming wood-boring insects, helping to preserve trees. Even the crow, often seen as a pest, contributes positively by feeding on destructive insects like beetles and grasshoppers. These examples emphasize the importance of birds in maintaining a balanced ecosystem by controlling harmful insect populations.|['1. What did Mr. E. H.

Starting in March, keep a record for a few days of the various bird species you spot that were not seen the day before. Make two observations daily, one in the morning and one after school. Determine when you see more new birds, in the morning or afternoon. If your area is quiet, listen for bird sounds at night. You can do this close to home. Do robins have more than one set of chicks in a season? Do they reuse nests? What happens to the first brood when the mother is incubating eggs for the second? Watch a robin guiding its young. Observe how the parent feeds and teaches the fledglings to sing. Many birds sing at night, such as the female robin calling to her partner. Note the songs heard at night and try to understand why they sing then. Identify the female's call from the male's song. Find a pair of birds constructing a nest, often robins. Differentiate between male and female birds by appearance and voice. Observe their nest-building roles and materials used. Analyze which bird leads in building, who protects the mate, and if the other bird carries materials or acts as an escort. Write down your conclusions based on your observations. After the young birds leave the nest, examine it closely. Note the variations in nest materials used by different bird species. Birds seem to adapt materials available to build nests, showing they use reasoning rather than just instinct.|"['1.

If you are lucky, you might spot a pair of orioles constructing their nest. Place colorful yarn or string where the birds can see them, and some will likely be woven into the nest. Oriole nests are often fastened to a branch with cords and secured against swinging by side ropes and prevailing winds. The birds sometimes tie twigs together to suspend their nests, which can vary in depth based on location. The shape of a bird's wings affects its flight in the air, with different types of wings influencing motion. Birds have distinct songs, with some having multiple variations. Birdsong varies in emotion, from cheerful to tuneful to rapturous. The destruction of birds for ornamental purposes has led to a significant decline in bird populations.|"['1.

The need for birds has persisted for 25 years, resulting in the slaughter of countless vibrant creatures, leading to the extinction of several bird species. To address this issue, the Humane Education Committee and various Audubon Societies urge action. Bird Day activities should be student-led and not a mere recitation of prepared material. Senator Hoar's petition, crucial in passing a Massachusetts law against using birds on hats, emphasized the importance of preserving these creatures. The petition highlighted how birds contribute to the beauty of gardens and parks, and how their disappearance would impact ecosystems. It called for an end to the senseless killing of birds for their feathers and nests. The petition stressed the shared history between birds and humans and the need to protect these vital creatures.|"['1.

We will teach your children cleanliness and neatness, how to live harmoniously like we do in our nests. We will build charming houses you will enjoy seeing. We will frolic in your garden, like winged flowers, at no cost to you. We will help rid your cherry, currant, plum, apple, and rose plants of harmful insects. We will sing our best songs for you, making spring more delightful and summer sweeter. Every June morning, orioles, bluebirds, blackbirds, and bobolinks will follow you, enhancing your day. When you return home tired, the vesper sparrow will express our gratitude.

In the meadow, the lark sang high above, the robin perched nearby piped a tune, and the blackbird's flute-like call echoed from the woods. The thrush, perched in a holly tree, sang a sweet melody that mingled with the rustling of birch and oak trees. The chorus of nature was all around us, from the hedges to the trees, blending into one clear, sweet voice that filled the air. Silvia listened to the sounds of starlings, thrushes, wood pigeons, and the cuckoo, while swallows danced over the lake. Blackbirds worked on the lawn, a robin watched curiously, and a nightingale's song pierced the night, overshadowing the silent stars. The bobolink perched on a twig, singing joyously like a Roman candle. The mockingbird, known for mimicry, sang purely original songs at night, captivating listeners with its endless, gushing mirth.|"['1.

As I strolled through my garden after a day of shooting, my faithful dog led the way. Suddenly, he slowed down, sensing something ahead. I followed his gaze and spotted a young sparrow, fallen from its nest due to the strong wind. Helpless on the ground, with wings spread wide, it lay motionless. My dog cautiously approached, but before he could reach the little bird, an older sparrow swooped down in a daring act of protection. With feathers ruffled and a terrified chirp, the brave sparrow confronted my dog, sacrificing himself to shield the young one. Trembling and frightened, he faced the giant threat to safeguard his offspring. Witnessing this selfless act, my dog paused, as if acknowledging a force greater than himself. I called him back, moved by the courage and love displayed by this tiny hero. The arrival of the first sparrow of spring always brings renewed hope and joy, with its sweet song echoing across the awakening landscape.

Why should a person not cherish a bird? If one's hand could hold a bird's wing, it would unite two remarkable tools from God and nature to explore the world. When two beings look at each other, the intelligence in one should respect the instincts in the other. A bird on a hat means less food on the table. Birds in orchards act as scavengers and help in fruit production. The scarlet tanager is a living gem in a tree but looks gruesome as an accessory. It costs life, joy, and music for a hat decoration. Songs about birds can add variety, and poets have always admired birds. They study birds intensely, finding their inner secrets and linking them to human life. Poets like Keats and Shelley have beautifully captured the essence of birds in their verses. The assistance of poets' vision complements that of naturalists in understanding birds better.|[]|[]
"The idea of a ""Bird Day"" in schools is to create a shared enthusiasm for bird lore among students.

Is it not important to protect the birds and prevent their harm before it's too late? Schools can have a positive impact by taking part in this movement. Teachers can make a difference by getting involved, and the benefits for students are immense, all achieved with minimal time and effort. If adding another holiday is not feasible, Bird Day activities can be combined with Arbor Day events. Bird Day is beneficial for schools of all levels and is recommended for teachers and school leaders nationwide to join the cause. Schools that have observed Bird Day have seen improvements in student writing and language skills. The children become more familiar with bird species, their behaviors, and become their advocates. The relationship between children and birds has transformed, with birds becoming more abundant and nesting in urban areas. Bird Day also promotes a connection between public libraries and schools, fostering a love for nature and literature among students. Teachers benefit from the experience through physical and mental well-being, forming stronger bonds with students.

The Bird Day initiative is now supported by the United States Government for economic reasons, benefiting future generations by fostering a love for birds. The natural inclination to appreciate and observe birds will be nurtured rather than ignored. These winged creatures no longer shy away from humans, but instead gather around, allowing children to interact with them fearlessly. The kingbird, with a length of about eight and a half inches and a wingspan of fourteen and a half inches, has blackish ash upper parts, a black head, and a concealed orange-red patch on its crown. Its pure white lower parts are tinged with pale bluish ash. The male kingbird, characterized by the name _tyrannus_, fiercely defends its territory during breeding season, particularly against hawks and crows. These birds are valuable to farmers as they protect crops by preying on harmful insects. The kingbird's nest is made of twigs and grasses, usually placed among tree branches. They lay four to five white, brown-spotted eggs and typically have two broods annually. The flicker, with a length of nine and a half inches and an eighteen-inch wingspan, has a crimson head and neck, black crescent on the breast, and black-glossed blue back, wings, and tail. Their nests are built in various trees, and they feed on wood lice, ants, and other ground insects. Woodpeckers, like the flicker, play a crucial role in preserving|"['1.

The red-headed woodpecker constructs its nest at the base of a tunnel in a tree, either dug by other birds or adapted from an existing cavity. The nest is a simple pile of soft, decaying wood, with more focus on protection from rain than cleanliness. The eggs are white with reddish-brown speckles, typically six in a clutch. This woodpecker has a crested head, light purplish-blue crest and upper back, bright blue wings and tail, and a black collar that curves gracefully from the head down each side of the neck. The blue jay's nest, on the other hand, is large and clumsily made, perched high in tall trees, often cedars. The female blue jay is slightly smaller than the male, with olive eggs speckled with brown. The male blue jay has a black head, large yellowish patch on the back of the neck, and sharp-pointed tail feathers. In autumn, the male's colors become more pronounced. The female blue jay has olive-buff upper parts streaked with black and brownish wings and tail feathers.

The birds described here have unique features and habits. The first bird is about eight inches long with black head, throat, and upper back, while the lower back, breast, and front wing are bright orange. The female is smaller and less colorful. It builds its nest with grasses and hangs it on a limb, laying five eggs. The second bird, about six inches long, has brown streaks and dark brown spots on its whitish body, with no white wing bars. The female is similar to the male. It nests in low bushes or on the ground, laying five eggs with greenish or bluish-white color and brown spots. The third bird, around five and a quarter inches long, has bright yellow back and underparts, with black wings and crown cap. In autumn, the male loses its black cap and bright yellow color. The female has no black cap and yellowish-gray lower parts. The fourth bird, about eight inches long, has a black head, throat, and back, with a rose-red breast and underwings. The female is similar in size to the male, with brown upper parts and yellowish underparts streaked with brown. They build thin nests of dried grass and twigs and lay four greenish-white eggs with brown spots. These birds are known to eat potato bugs and are attracted to cherries and berries.
