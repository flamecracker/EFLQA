"Effects of Altitude and Rainfall

Altitude impacts temperature and rainfall. For every 300 feet in elevation, the temperature drops by 1°F. Areas above 6,000 feet have cooler temperatures, affecting food production. Tropical regions like Mexico and parts of Asia at high altitudes can support agriculture. Rainfall also varies with altitude. Plateaus are often dry due to their height, affecting food production and population density. Regions with over 100 inches of rain tend to be forested but may lack food crops. In contrast, areas with less rainfall struggle to grow grains and grasses, limiting population density. Irrigation, like in Egypt, can transform arid lands into fertile areas. In the United States, irrigation has reclaimed barren lands, increasing productivity. Rainfall distribution by season is crucial, affecting plant growth and agriculture in different regions."|['1.

The growth of common clover in a certain region is reliant on irrigation, while burr-clover thrives in dry areas. In California, the quality of merino wool is influenced by plants like burr-clover, which flourish in regions with seasonal rainfall. The impact of seasonal rains extends to other agricultural sectors as well. The absence of summer rains in California allows wheat crops to remain uncovered before shipping, a practice not viable in regions like the Mississippi Valley with frequent rainstorms. The flavor of fruits like apples, pears, and grapes is affected by the timing of rainfall, with those grown in dry summer regions having superior taste. The presence of large water bodies influences the climate of nearby lands, affecting industries like grape-growing in central New York. The inclination of the Earth's axis plays a crucial role in climate, extending the growing season for crops in temperate zones.

During the era of steamship development, vessels powered by steam revolutionized ocean commerce. The Savannah was the first deep-water vessel to use steam propulsion, initially as a supplement to wind power. By 1860, ocean steamships transitioned from side-wheelers to screw-blade propellers, requiring high-pressure engines for increased speed. Modern ocean steamships have evolved into two main types: freighters for carrying large cargo at moderate speeds and liners for passengers. Liners like the White Star Celtic and American line Philadelphia showcase advancements in steamship technology, utilizing twin-screws and triple-expansion engines for efficiency. Despite steamship advancements, sailing-craft still play a significant role in transporting goods, especially non-perishable items. Fore-and-aft rigged vessels have largely replaced square-rigged ships, offering efficient transport with fewer crew members.

Navigating harbor entrances can be challenging, leading underwriters to require licensed pilots to guide vessels from the outer harbor to the dock. These pilots undergo extensive training before receiving their licenses. Pilotage charges are based on the vessel's size, regulated differently in various ports. Channels worldwide use similar marking and lighting systems. In the United States, the government oversees all navigable channels. Inland waters like lakes, rivers, and canals are crucial for transportation. The Great Lakes, Erie Canal, and Hudson River form a significant internal waterway in the U.S., facilitating trade across the continent. The Mississippi River and its branches provide about ten thousand miles of navigable waters, supporting trade in grain, lumber, and cotton. Rivers like the Hudson and Delaware are vital for freight and passenger traffic. River navigation in Europe often integrates with canal systems, while Asian rivers like the Amur and Yangtze serve local commerce.|"['1.

Oceanic canals serve both industrial and strategic purposes. For instance, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in Germany saves time for ships traveling between Hamburg and Baltic ports. The Manchester Ship Canal turns Manchester into a seaport, reducing freight costs. The Corinth Canal in Greece shortens the route between Italian ports and Odessa. The North Holland Ship Canal makes Amsterdam a seaport. The Suez Canal, a vital trade route between Europe and Asia, saves time and distance for steamships. Despite the high tolls, it sees thousands of vessels annually. Originally controlled by French capitalists, the Suez Canal is now under English ownership. Plans for an interoceanic canal across the American continent have been ongoing for decades. The Panama Canal project faced challenges, with the United States eventually purchasing the franchise.

The construction of a canal, whether through one route or another, will have a significant impact on global trade, surpassing even the effects of the Suez Canal's creation. This new route will bring San Francisco closer to London than Calcutta currently is, shortening the sea journey between the United States' Atlantic ports and those of China and Japan by over eight thousand miles. The Hawaiian Islands, already a vital hub for ocean trade, will see a substantial increase in importance, solidifying their status as a key commercial center. While water transport is cost-effective, railways dominate the transportation of goods in the United States and western Europe due to the need for speedy deliveries. Time is of the essence in modern business, especially in densely populated areas like New York, London, or Berlin, where perishable food items must arrive promptly. This demand for punctuality drives the preference for rail transport over maritime routes, even though the latter may be cheaper. The advancement of railway technology, such as the use of Bessemer steel, has significantly improved the efficiency and capacity of locomotives, allowing for greater loads and faster speeds. This progress has led to a substantial decrease in rail transport costs and increased the speed and reliability of freight and passenger transportation. The development of railways as common carriers began in the early 19th century, revolutionizing transportation in densely populated regions.

During the mid-19th century, the concept of railway management evolved significantly. Initially, people viewed railways as public highways where anyone could operate their conveyances by paying a toll, similar to canals. However, the introduction of steam locomotives made this idea impractical, leading to the necessity of organized railway systems. By 1850, England had almost 400 railway companies, while the US required a dozen to connect New York City and Buffalo. The consolidation of connecting lines became common practice, reducing operating costs and improving services. This consolidation also led to the extension of railway lines, connecting previously isolated regions. While some railways were built for speculative purposes, others opened up new industries and lands for development. Competition between railways was fierce, often resulting in rate wars and financial losses for companies.|['1.

Between 1870 and 1880, railway companies faced challenges due to rate-cutting and competition. State laws prevented the consolidation of trunk lines, leading to struggles in maintaining rates. To address this, companies resorted to dividing territory, traffic, or earnings, known as pooling. While traffic division is simpler, it can be unsatisfactory. Earnings division is more complex as each company may be unhappy with their share. Despite legal challenges, pooling has generally improved railway services. However, it has raised concerns about increased railway power. To regulate fair rates, governments must balance the cost of service and what customers can afford. Freight rates consider factors like loading costs and distance. Classifying freights into categories helps determine charges fairly. Handling through freights between multiple companies can lead to pricing conflicts.|['1.

Railway systems have faced challenges in balancing long and short hauls, leading to the creation of pools and traffic associations to prevent rate wars, which can harm both the community and railway companies. Legislation has been enacted to address these issues, with some laws proving beneficial while others have negative impacts. Passenger service is typically more regulated than freight, with rates set by law, varying from two to five cents per mile. Long-distance rates are lower than local rates and are determined by joint associations. Passenger service is generally less profitable than freight, with some railways considering discontinuing passenger trains. Rate-cutting has decreased due to joint associations but still occurs through ticket brokers. Differential rates are offered by faster services between the same terminal points. The United States has a vast railway network, with the majority of lines running east-west to connect production centers with distribution hubs.|['1.

Railway ownership varies across different countries. In Prussia, the state owns the railways, while in Germany, they are owned by the state, empire, or corporate companies. France has struggled with governmental ownership, with only 1,700 miles under state control. Belgium manages all its lines efficiently due to their smaller area. In the United States, railways are owned by corporate companies, some initially built with government subsidies. Railways in the U.S. are essential for transporting food to urban areas. Companies have eminent domain powers to seize land for tracks. States regulate tariffs and prevent discrimination. Electric railways have revolutionized transportation, increasing suburban populations and improving freight delivery. Public roads and highways have seen advancements with steam, electric, and gasoline-powered carriages, leading to the demand for well-surfaced roads.

In the United States, many country highways are dirt roads filled with dust in dry weather and nearly impossible to travel on in the winter. These roads make it difficult for farmers to transport their grain to railway stations, often costing more than the journey from the station to London. Recognizing the importance of good roads for commercial development, efforts are being made to improve important highways by grading and surfacing them. This improvement not only eases intercommunication but also reduces transportation costs by half and minimizes vehicle wear. The uneven distribution of the world's population shows that about nine-tenths live in lowland plains where food grows, while the rest reside in grass-producing regions, mining areas, or flood-plains. The population is divided into rural and urban areas, with agricultural regions like the United States and western Europe fostering rural life, while places like Russia see agricultural populations clustering in villages. Urban populations tend to concentrate in cities and villages for reasons like facilitating the distribution and transportation of goods, manufacturing products, access to good harbors, and necessary minerals for industries. Towns often emerge as centers for receiving and distributing commodities, with country stores acting as clearinghouses for various goods and farm products. These towns usually develop in accessible locations, such as highway crossings, river landing spots, fording places, bridges, ferries, toll gates, or convenient resting points along a journey. Many towns have started from simple sidings along railway tracks, demonstrating the importance of transportation infrastructure in shaping urban centers.|"['1.

In the early days of many countries, military posts laid the foundation for what are now bustling cities like Rome, Paris, and London. These cities began as military outposts, with trading posts often established under their protection. Good harbors, such as those in New York City and Seattle, attract trade from far and wide. Water-power also played a significant role in the growth of cities, like those in New England, where it fueled rapid industrial development. Metals like coal and iron have shaped the industries and populations of cities like Pittsburg and Birmingham. The location of a city can be influenced by factors like man's energy and resourcefulness, as seen in the development of places like Chicago and St. Louis. Additionally, cities like Philadelphia and San Francisco have had to adapt to changing trade routes and economic conditions to maintain their prominence.|"[""1.

The movement of populations due to economic factors, such as new transportation lines or lower production costs, has been common historically and will continue in the future. This adjustment often results from the discovery of new economic processes that disrupt populations, requiring them to adapt to new conditions. Some groups struggle to take advantage of their environment initially due to lack of intelligence or training. For instance, American Indians and Boers failed to utilize the resources available to them effectively. Even advanced civilizations may take time to adjust; New Englanders were slow to recognize the value of their harbors. Grasses play a vital role in human economies, providing food for both people and animals. Wheat, maize, and rice are staple foods for most populations, while livestock feed on grasses. Wheat cultivation dates back to ancient times, with Mesopotamia considered its likely place of origin. Wheat is a crucial global crop, with over a third of the world's population relying on it for bread. Wheat grows best between certain latitudes and requires specific soil conditions for optimal growth. The world's demand for wheat is immense, with the crop often consumed close to the limit of supply.|"['1.

The production of wheat varies depending on rainfall and cultivation skill. In Western Europe, the yield is two to three times higher than in the United States, while in Russia and India, it is lower. The consumption of wheat is rapidly increasing in the US, Europe, and China. Without significant increases in crop acreage or yield per acre by 1931, the US may lack surplus for export. Irrigating arid lands and improving cultivation methods can boost yields. Corn, derived from the American continent, is the staple food in the US. It requires rich soil, long summers, and warm nights to thrive. The US is the top corn producer, yielding over two billion bushels annually. Skilful cultivation methods can double corn yields per acre, making it a valuable food source due to its high fatty content and heating power.|['1.

"In the United States, most of the corn crop is used to feed livestock such as pigs and cows. While a pound of corn is worth only a third of a cent in the market, when it is fed to animals, it can increase in value to five or six times more. Corn has various uses besides being a staple food. It is used to make starch, which is a delicacy in America and Europe. Glucose, a sugar substitute, can be derived from corn. The oil from corn can be used as a rubber substitute, and the stalk's pith is used to create smokeless powder and explosives. Additionally, a significant portion of corn is used in liquor production.

Rye is a cereal grass seed that grows in soils unsuitable for wheat. It is predominantly grown in the sandy plain extending from the Netherlands to central Russia. Rye-bread is typically sour and is primarily consumed where it is grown. The United States produces about twenty-five million bushels of rye annually, with a small portion exported to Europe.

Barley, another seed from cereal grass, is one of the oldest bread-stuffs. It can be grown further north than wheat and has a wide cultivation range. Barley is mainly used for horse feed and in brewing. The world's barley crop is close to one billion bushels, with the United States producing around sixty million bushels.

"Rice is a cereal grass seed known as _Oryza sativa_, believed to be native to India but cultivated in China for over five thousand years. It grows wild in Australia and Malaysia, needing warmth and moisture to thrive. While it can be grown in the warmer parts of the temperate zone, it flourishes best in tropical regions. In China, rice is mainly cultivated in level lowlands that can be flooded with water, requiring significant field preparation. The crop matures in three to six months, and after threshing, the seed is called ""paddy."" Different types of grains like wheat, oats, barley, corn, millet, and rice can be obtained for study. Textiles are fibrous materials spun into threads for cloth, with animal and vegetable origins. Wool is the best insulator, followed by cotton, linen, and silk, each with varying uses and qualities. Cotton, a vital textile, is the lint around _Gossypium_ plant seeds, originating from India and spread worldwide. Cotton plants need warmth, moisture, and a long season, thriving best in subtropical regions near the sea.

"=Wool.= The wool we commonly use comes from sheep, certain goats, and even camels. Wool fibers have rough edges that interlock, unlike hair which is usually smooth. This unique quality of wool, called ""felting,"" makes it ideal for making strong cloth without spinning or weaving. The quality of wool depends on the animal's diet, climate, and soil. Long-staple wool has fibers from four to eight inches long and is used for making worsted cloth. Short-staple wool, with fibers less than four inches, is used for men's clothing. The softest wool, like merino, is grown in arid regions and is perfect for luxurious clothing. Coarse-staple wools are used for carpets and heavy clothing. Rug wools from Persia and other regions are excellent for durable rugs due to their elasticity. Wool is usually sheared from sheep, but in some places, it is combed from lambs."|"['1.

Silk production is a meticulous process. Cocoons are collected and then submerged in hot water to kill the chrysalids and soften the cocoons for the removal of the outer cases. The remaining cocoon is soaked in warm water to loosen the fibers for reeling. These fibers are then twisted into strands to create raw silk, which is used in commerce. Some raw silk is further twisted into a coarse thread known as thrown silk. The silk is then made into large skeins called hanks for export. A small quantity of cocoons yields good raw silk, while the rest is used to make inferior quality silk thread. The tradition of sericulture dates back to the smuggling of silk-worm eggs to India. China is a major producer of silk, exporting tussar silk commercially. Additionally, flax, the source of linen cloth, is derived from the bast of the flax plant. It is a versatile crop that grows well in various climates. Russia is the largest flax producer globally, with Belgium known for producing high-quality Courtrai fiber due to the water quality in the Lys River.|['1.

Coffee, once forbidden to followers of Islam due to its stimulating effects, became popular for its ability to keep people alert during long religious practices. Initially confined to Arabia, coffee cultivation spread to the Dutch East Indies, particularly Java, which became a major global supplier. Today, Java is the second-largest coffee producer after Brazil. Coffee trees thrive in fertile red soil and moist climates with temperatures between 55°F and 80°F. The coffee fruit, a deep-red berry, contains seeds that are harvested, pulped, sun-cured, hulled, cleaned, and then sold. The quality of coffee improves with age, and sorting is crucial for premium beans. Different types of coffee are named based on their origin, like Rio from Brazil, Maracaibo from Venezuela, and Java from East India.

"Tea Production and Trade

After harvesting, tea leaves undergo a process where they are partially crushed and left to wither until they start to change color to brown. The leaves are then hand-rolled and dried slowly under the sun or quickly over a charcoal fire, a method called ""firing."" Black tea results from the slow drying process, while green tea comes from the rapid method. Green tea can be enhanced with a mixture of powdered gypsum and Prussian blue for color. The Chinese export their tea in wooden chests lined with sheet-lead, while Japan uses moisture-tight packaging. India, China, Japan, and Java are the major tea producers.

Forestry is the management of forests, and in Europe, the government is responsible for protecting them. Each year, only a limited number of mature trees can be cut down, and for each tree removed, several million new trees are planted. In the United States, where forest fires destroy valuable timber each year, not enough is being done to prevent this or replant trees. Some states promote tree-planting, with Arbor Day being a holiday in several. The government has set up timber preserves in the West, and New York has turned the Adirondack region into a large preserve. To grow high-quality lumber, trees must be clear of knots at least 15 feet from the ground. Forests in the U.S. typically grow in sandy and gravelly soils, with some areas remaining treeless due to fires or lack of seed planting.|['1.

In Anatolia, a Turkish region comprising Asia Minor, Armenia, Kurdistan, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Arabia, rugs play a vital role in households. Essential items like hearth-rugs, bath-mats, divan-covers, sleeping-blankets, and saddle-mats are considered necessities due to the absence of floors and furniture in many dwellings. Each district and people have unique rug designs and methods of production. These hand-woven rugs are often named after the town or district where they are made. The rugs are gathered by caravans and shipped to ports like Smyrna and Constantinople, with New York being a major rug market. While most rugs are priced between ten to fifty dollars, exceptional pieces can fetch prices ranging from three hundred to ten thousand dollars. The Armenians, known for their business acumen, dominate trade in these regions despite facing persecution. Roads built during the Roman era have facilitated trade, with railways constructed by German capitalists further boosting exports of fruit, rugs, and mohair cloth. Syria, particularly Damascus, is a hub for textile exports, including rugs, dates, figs, and damask fabrics shipped through Beirut to European markets.

Arab traders play a significant role in the commerce connecting Asia to Europe. They collect goods from the interior and deliver them to European and American merchants through intermediaries. Additionally, they control a large part of the commerce in northern Africa and dominate the slave trade. Persia, now known as Iran, was once a powerful empire with abundant food production and valuable mineral mines. However, its revenue declined due to changes in trade routes. Tabriz is renowned for its shawls and silk fabrics, while Shiraz, Kermanshah, and Hamadan are known for rug and carpet manufacturing. Afghanistan's nomadic tribes engage in local trade, especially between Bokhara, Herat, and Kabul. The Sind-Pishin railway connects Karachi to Peshawur, boosting trade in the region.

European acquisition of Oceania islands has spurred commercial growth. These islands produce food staples like sago, breadfruit, coconuts, and bananas. Copra, dried coconut meat, is a common export to Marseille, London, and San Francisco. Sago, derived from palm pith, is exported and used as a delicacy. Bananas are a vital food source for millions. Honolulu in Hawaii is a pivotal mid-ocean hub for trans-Pacific trade routes. Native Malay labor is crucial for cultivating export goods due to the tropics' harsh conditions. Australia, comprising states and Tasmania, is a significant wool producer, exporting mainly to the UK, France, Germany, and Belgium.|['1.

"Three roads, A, B, and C, connect Chicago and New York City. Road C is the shortest but has steep grades. Road B is longer but has easier grades. Road A is indirect, requiring trans-shipment at Boston or New London. If a ton-mile rate is set for one road, the others must adjust rates. Road B, with manageable grades, can set rates for better returns. Road C follows suit, while Road A operates at a small profit. If A is outside the U.S., it can openly cut rates. Meanwhile, roads X, Y, and Z compete for freight from Buffalo eastward. B and C often divide through business, offering a ""differential"" rate to A. Such complexities in rate-setting are seen in cases like Danville and Lynchburg's trade competition. The Southern Railway charged differently due to competition, leading to a legal dispute. In cases like these, consolidation of roads may be the only solution to maintain fair rates for all parties involved."|['1.

"In the United States, there are distinct wheat-growing regions with specific varieties suited to each area. For example, in New England and the middle Atlantic states, Early Genesee Giant, Jones Winter Fife, and Fultz are commonly grown. Southern states prefer Fultz, Fulcaster, Purple Straw, and May. The north-central states plant Early Red Clawson, Poole, Dawson's Golden Chaff, Buda Pest, and Fultz. In the Dakotas and Minnesota, Scotch Fife and Velvet Blue Stem are typical spring wheat choices. Kansas and Texas opt for Turkey, Fulcaster, and Mediterranean winter wheats. California and the southern plateau region favor Sonora, California Club, and Defiance winter wheats. Washington and Oregon grow Little Club, Red Chaff, and Blue Stem as their main varieties. The process of transferring wheat from the Middle West to the seaboard involves elevators equipped with ""legs"" that efficiently load grain onto vessels. Buffalo's elevators can fill a canal-boat in an hour and load six grain-cars in five minutes. Most wheat from the northwest is shipped from Duluth through the St. Marys Falls Canal to Buffalo before being transferred to railcars or canal-boats for export."|"[""1.

"In 1823, Mackintosh, a Scotchman, discovered that rubber gum dissolves in benzine, leading to the creation of waterproof cloth bearing his name. Before 1850, pencils used metallic lead instead of graphite, which later became the norm. Pencil hardness is adjusted by mixing clay with powdered graphite. Limestone aids in smelting by creating a liquid slag, known as a flux. Clearing-houses facilitate quick payment settlements among banks, even though the total yearly payments exceed two billion dollars. Brands, like initials or monograms, were registered and seared onto animals for identification. Disputes arose when sheep-graziers demanded access to fenced government land, causing conflicts with cattle ranchers and rustlers. ""Chinook winds"" in wheat-growing regions provide essential warmth. Vegetable ivory, from a palm seed, resembles real ivory. Coca leaves, known for their stimulant effects, contain cocaine used in surgeries worldwide."|['1.
