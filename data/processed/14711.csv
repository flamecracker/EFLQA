England had been facing a dangerous threat from German submarines, but the British public was unaware of the steps taken to combat this peril. Lord Hastings revealed to Jack and Frank that around a hundred submarines had mysteriously disappeared, showing the effectiveness of the measures taken. The goal was to completely eliminate this underwater danger to British ships. Lord Hastings entrusted the boys with a mission, providing them with his motorboat to investigate further. As they navigated the river towards Gravesend, they encountered another boat. Initially, a misunderstanding led to a tense situation, but they eventually realized they were all on the same side. The boys were brought before an officer who suspected them of being spies, but after a brief exchange, their innocence was established.|['1.

The boys chatted for a while, growing increasingly anxious as they realized Lord Hastings suspected them. Without warning, an intruder quietly entered the room. Startled, the boys faced him. Lord Hastings explained that he orchestrated the situation to teach them a lesson about following orders. Later, the boys found themselves on a motorboat with Lord Hastings at the helm, speeding down the Thames in darkness. Despite the lack of visibility, they trusted his expertise. The boat suddenly slowed, and Lord Hastings directed them to be alert. The boys, armed with curiosity and determination, noticed the guns aboard, hinting at a serious task ahead. As they scanned the tranquil night, they sensed an impending challenge on the horizon, ready to face it head-on.|"[""1.

The chasers were closing in on their target, with only fifty yards between them. The night was silent except for Lord Hastings' occasional commands. Suddenly, a light appeared on the other boat, indicating it was occupied. Despite circling for half an hour, the pursuers couldn't find the boat. Searchlights scanned the water, but the target remained elusive. As dawn broke, the cold seeped into Frank and Jack, but their determination kept them on deck. A figure on the other boat fell overboard, ignored by their companions. A third boat interfered, allowing the fugitives to escape to shore. Lord Hastings and his team leaped ashore to chase the suspects through empty streets. A confrontation ensued, leading to a physical encounter that hindered Frank's pursuit.|"['1.

The boy turned the corner and was suddenly knocked down, feeling like he had hit a wall. Jack and Lord Hastings almost tripped over him as they rushed around the corner. Shortly after, he caught up with them and took the lead. But the fugitives, now tired, managed to turn another corner before he could reach them. Frank cautiously turned the corner and stopped in dismay, realizing the fugitives were not on the street but likely in the two-story brick building he was facing. He instructed Jack to guard the basement door while he tried to find the fugitives. As Lord Hastings opened a door, a hand with a revolver swung towards him, but he managed to dodge and grab the attacker's arm. Lord Hastings identified the attackers as Davis and Blosberg, who was aiming to shoot him without harming Davis.|"['1.

Lord Hastings made a mighty effort to lift Davis off his feet and swung him around with great strength, causing Davis to drop to the floor after hitting his head on the wall. Meanwhile, Frank's gun suddenly went off in his hand, numbing his fingers as Blosberg's bullet struck his revolver. Blosberg managed to escape down a narrow passageway just before Jack fired a shot. Jack then found a ladder leading to the roof. When Blosberg reached the roof, a confrontation ensued with Jack and others. Shots were exchanged, resulting in Lord Hastings being wounded. Jack and Frank carried Baron's body inside the house and informed the authorities. Lord Hastings explained the importance of high-speed motorboats in countering submarines, leading to England deploying a fleet of such boats to combat German submarines in the seas near the British Isles.|"[""1.

Lord Hastings explained the advantages of using small motorboats over submarines. He mentioned that motorboats are hard to detect by submarines until they are very close and are difficult targets for torpedoes due to their size and speed. Additionally, motorboats are faster than submarines, giving them an advantage. Lord Hastings highlighted that submarines lack visibility underwater, making it challenging for them to aim accurately. He discussed plans to cruise off the Irish coast with a motorboat fleet, emphasizing the importance of vigilance. The passage described the silent approach of a motorboat named _The Hawk_, equipped with crew members ready for action. Despite the calm night, the crew remained alert, searching the dark waters for any signs of danger.|['1.

Less than a hundred yards apart, two boats couldn't harm each other due to the blinding glare of each other's lights. The occupants of one boat devised a plan to slip overboard in a small boat, row towards the enemy, and take them by surprise. They successfully picked off a couple of foes before the enemy retaliated. Despite the enemy's searchlight, they remained unseen due to their own light blinding the foe. After a daring venture, they returned to safety aboard their boat. An unexpected interruption led to a sudden turn of events, with Lord Hastings taking swift action to evade an incoming shell. Thanks to quick thinking and action, they managed to escape the enemy's pursuit and survive the dangerous encounter.|"[""1.

Once more, Frank carefully aimed at a moving figure on the enemy's deck and pulled the trigger. His sharpshooting skills were evident as the figure fell into the sea under _The Hawk's_ searchlight. However, misfortune struck _The Hawk_ as the enemy retaliated by shooting out the searchlight. Blinded, _The Hawk_ slowed down. Frank heard a suspicious noise and alerted Lord Hastings. They decided on a plan where two boats would approach the enemy from different angles to trap them. Amidst the chaos, a scuffle ensued between the captors and Frank's group, resulting in a tense standoff. The German captor tried to shoot Jack but was thwarted by Williams. In the scuffle, Edwards also faced a violent attack.|"[""1.

Jack aimed his gun as Frank fell unconscious. The German turned to face Jack, and both shot simultaneously, narrowly avoiding the bullets. Jack's hand was grazed, causing him to drop his gun. Realizing he was surrounded, Jack grappled with the first German, disarming him. Jack then noticed the helmsman's weapon and kicked it overboard. Despite facing a tough opponent, Jack used quick tactics to push the German across the deck. As the second German approached, Jack dodged a punch and landed a powerful blow, incapacitating the first foe. Facing the larger second German, Jack skillfully evaded attacks and landed precise punches until the German was knocked out cold.|"['1.

Jack assisted his friend to stand up. Frank wobbled at first but quickly declared he was ready for anything. They walked to the back of the boat where Edwards and Williams lay. The wind picked up, propelling the small boat swiftly. The sea swelled, causing massive waves. Despite the storm intensifying, the boat sailed on bravely. Edwards showed excellent seamanship skills. A huge wave crashed over the boat, soaking everyone. The wind howled, chilling the air. Frank shivered but held on tight. The boat battled the storm for hours, with each wave threatening to capsize it. But Edwards expertly steered through the turmoil. Finally, the storm subsided, and the sun shone brightly. Exhausted, Edwards fainted, leaving the boat adrift. They spotted another distressed boat ahead. They reached safety in a bay and got medical help for Lord Hastings, who only needed rest.|"[""1.

For a whole week, the boys focused solely on tending to their injured leader. Lord Hastings grew stronger each day on board _The Hawk_. Despite his eagerness to rise on the third day, the surgeon advised against it. After inspecting the ship, Lord Hastings met with the British commander in charge of the motorboat fleet. Upon his return, he shared news that passengers were warned against sailing on the _Glasgow_ due to potential German submarine threats. The plan was to intercept any attack before it happened. As the _Glasgow_ approached, the motorboat fleet prepared for action, ready to protect the ship. Despite the visible presence of the motorboats, they hoped to remain unseen by the enemy submarine. On the _Glasgow_, passengers were alarmed by the submarine's appearance but were reassured by the officers.|"['1.

Swiftly the small boat raced ahead and caught the submarine commander off guard. Before he could react, _The Hawk_ fired its front gun, prompting the commander to take action. Realizing the danger, he chose not to attack the boat, leading to his own demise as the submarine sank. The motorboat fleet followed the _Glasgow_ until nightfall, but no more submarines appeared. As they turned back toward Bantry Bay, the _Glasgow_ sailed to New York. Frank expressed uncertainty about returning home but enjoyed the adventure. Upon boarding the silent submarine, they encountered and subdued the German crew. Lord Hastings suggested taking control of the vessel to gather valuable information.|"[""1.

Lord Hastings, with a plan in mind, decided that two men could manage the engine room. The crew would take turns steering the submarine and assisting wherever needed. Short-staffed, they hoped to encounter an enemy vessel to recruit more crew members. As they surfaced, they spotted another submarine approaching. Lord Hastings cautioned his companions to stay quiet and let him handle the situation. He spun a tale about their mission with Captain Tarlenhein in the Irish Sea and the Thames. Their escape from London, aided by their resemblance to a British officer, was nearly thwarted by an Englishman named Davis. Despite the challenges, they eventually reunited with the U-16, waiting for their captain's return.|['1.

Yesterday, we boarded a ship and found it occupied by British officers and sailors. We managed to overpower them, keeping three as our crew since our own men were captured by the enemy. The young German mentioned a man named Davis on his ship, an Englishman he didn't trust. To deceive Davis and the German, we pretended to help Davis to keep our true intentions hidden. As we approached Ostend, a German submarine base, we needed to keep our identities secret from Davis until we could hand him over to the British authorities.

Admiral Schuler commands an immediate mission to Dover Bay to join a submarine flotilla for an attack on the British fleet at the Thames. The flotilla will gather a mile off Dover at midnight on Thursday. Lord Hastings suggests a surprise attack strategy after notifying the Admiralty. Frank enthusiastically agrees to the plan. However, Davis takes their quarters, leading to a scuffle where Frank overpowers him. As the situation escalates, Lord Hastings intervenes to prevent further conflict.

The commotion on the ship grew more intense as panic spread among the passengers. Commands and cries filled the air as the German submarine prepared to attack. In the tense moment, Lord Hastings took charge, ordering the submarine to submerge. The crew members, both German and English, awaited the unfolding events. Despite the chaos, some lifeboats were safely lowered to rescue those in the water. Lord Hastings, focused on the periscope, strategized to save the remaining passengers. Suddenly, a German officer signaled to fire a torpedo at the liner. Amidst the tension, a quiet struggle ensued as Frank thwarted an attempt to attack.

Two of the Germans were asked to steer the ship, leaving Lord Hastings in his cabin. Jack and Frank headed towards the back of the ship. Passing the crew's sleeping quarters, they heard a commotion and quickly entered. In the center of the room, surrounded by German sailors, stood Davis facing the British sailor, O'Brien. The crew seemed divided in their sentiments. They knew Davis was a traitor, but suspected Jack and Frank too. However, they were convinced Lord Hastings was German. Jack declared a fair fight with only fists allowed, no kicking or biting. After rolling up their sleeves, Frank and Davis prepared to fight. Davis, larger and seemingly stronger, took a swing at Frank, who dodged and landed a light blow. Despite Davis's size advantage, Frank skillfully evaded his attacks and landed a few hits.

Frank and Davis were in a fierce fight, each trying to outmaneuver the other. Frank confidently advanced, but Davis quickly countered his moves. Despite a few hits, Frank managed to smile and retaliate with a strong blow to Davis' nose. As the fight continued, Davis gained confidence and landed a powerful hit on Frank's jaw. However, Frank quickly recovered and retaliated with a precise punch to Davis' nose, causing him pain.

"Jack firmly stated to his companions, ""You've been defeated, and that's final. Let's move on and see if you can stand up. I'll guide you back to our living quarters."" An hour later, Lord Hastings ordered the U-16 to resurface. As the vessel glided on the water's surface, Davis and three German sailors engaged in a secretive conversation. They discussed their plans cautiously, aware of the risks involved. Davis emphasized the need for patience and strategy to overcome Commander Bernstorff. The German sailors questioned their allegiance in the war and the authority they followed. Davis proposed a mutiny, envisioning a future where they were in control of their destiny and the spoils of the sea.

Lord Hastings paused the submarine, wary of British patrol boats, and set off to alert the authorities. He instructed the boys to arm the crew discreetly and keep an eye on the suspected traitor, Davis. The plan involved deploying motorboats to attack the submarines while torpedo boats with nets would be stationed strategically to trap them.

Admiral Fischer called the officer who had brought the two to him and told him to take them back. The officer seemed surprised but said nothing. Lord Hastings shook hands with Admiral Fischer, and he and Frank followed the officer out of the room. It was very dark at night, and at first, they couldn't see anything on the water. Then, flashes of light appeared around them, signaling safe passage. Lord Hastings took out his flashlight and did the same. They learned that the mines had been cleared by mine sweepers. Lord Hastings then gave orders for the submarines to stick together as they headed towards the Thames. They were on a mission to sink British warships. The submarines submerged, ready to strike. The crews were excited, except for Davis and his group, who had their own plans. As they approached the Thames, the key to London, they saw no British ships in sight.|"['1.

The German U-16 led the way with other submarines following closely, two by two. Each vessel's crew stood ready, anticipating a signal. The officers on the bridge watched the U-16's movements, guiding the fleet with a stern light. Larger warships trailed the motorboat flotilla, aiming to capture the enemy subs. As the U-16 advanced up the river, a sudden explosion signaled the start of battle. The British ships attacked, causing chaos among the German submarines. Despite attempts to submerge, the Germans faced swift British retaliation. The British successfully trapped and captured four German subs in nets. Amidst the action, conversations hinted at potential alliances and strategies for the future. Davis contemplated the possibilities, recognizing the potential in a new ally.

Edwards retreated and woke up O'Brien and McDonald, urging them to follow him to the bridge where Jack was waiting. They discussed countering Davis and his group swiftly, concerned that other crew members might join them. Armed, everyone on the ship was considering Davis' offers, except for Lord Hastings who had decided against disarming them to avoid suspicion. As tensions rose, a confrontation ensued between the British and the Germans, resulting in casualties on both sides. Despite the chaos, Edwards managed to shoot Davis, incapacitating him. With General Hamilton's support, Lord Hastings organized a team to recapture the vessel, leading them to a captured German submarine.

Throughout the night, Frank, Jack, and Lord Hastings took turns on the bridge, but they didn't spot any enemy ships. The U-6 dove when near a British warship from the blockading fleet to avoid drawing fire. Moving slowly eastward, the U-6 appeared as a tiny speck on the sea. Frank noticed distant smudges on the horizon, likely battleships from Heligoland. They decided to submerge until close, then surface to surprise the ships, using the cover of darkness for a strategic advantage, just like in the Scarborough and Hartlepool raids.

However, when the last enemy ship detected them, a shell hit the U-6, causing damage. Lord Hastings decided to retreat to safety. They waited until they were sure the remaining enemy ship was no longer a threat before resurfacing.
