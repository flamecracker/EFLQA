The priest's hand froze mid-air as the Cathedral bell rang a warning of the approaching Germans, halting his prayer. Mother Meraut, seeking her children, and the Verger arrived.

The store was close to the Meraut family's cozy home. They often bought items from stout Madame Coudert, whose round face peeked over the counter like a full moon. Mother Meraut greeted her, expressing relief that she wasn't fleeing like a hare. Madame Coudert, unfazed, stated the futility of running without a destination.

When the Twins woke up the next day, they saw the sun shining through the eastern window of the kitchen, with Mother Meraut by the fire. The smell of chocolate filled the air, and the table was set with rolls and butter. Pierre yawned and rubbed his eyes, while Pierrette sat up, momentarily forgetting her worries from the night before. But soon, the dreadful truth hit her, and she moaned and sank back onto her pillow. Mother Meraut, understanding their concerns, cheerfully greeted them, urging them to get dressed quickly. She mentioned going to work at the Cathedral, emphasizing the importance of their routine. As they ate breakfast, Pierre suggested bringing extra food in case they couldn't return home.

"""Listen, my dear,"" said Pierrette's mother, ""we will cook all the eggs and bring them along. Eggs are very nutritious."" She quickly fetched a saucepan, and as the eggs boiled, they tidied up the kitchen and readied themselves to go out. ""Everything looks the same as yesterday,"" Pierrette commented as they strolled down the street. They greeted Madame Coudert at the shop and purchased a loaf of bread. Suddenly, gunshots rang out, causing chaos. People ran for cover as tiles fell. A man rushed in, reporting that the enemy was demanding supplies and money from the city. Despite the fear, Pierre was determined not to be intimidated.

"""Pierre, you're being foolish,"" scolded his Mother. ""You're causing me so much trouble! We'll see the Germans, but you can't run off. If we get separated, who knows if we'll ever find each other again."" As they walked, Pierre fumed silently, unable to break free from his Mother's grip. At the next corner, they were met with an incredible sight. A whole cavalry regiment passed by, singing loudly, with the sun gleaming on their helmets. The sound of swords and spurs added to the grandeur. Tears welled in many eyes around them, but heads remained held high. Pierre, full of anger, muttered threats under his breath. But before he could act, his Mother, unable to bear the sight, whisked him away. ""I won't let them parade in front of me,"" she declared. She led them through back streets to the Cathedral, where they were met by the Verger, who scolded them for being out during the bombardment. Defiantly, Mother Meraut retorted, ""Our soldiers don't stop working at the sound of gunfire or a few Germans. We can't let fear rule us!"" She then playfully dismissed the Verger's notion of men being braver than women and went to resume her cleaning duties with the children."|"[""1.

During the chaos of war, Mother Meraut and her twins maintained a sense of normalcy in their invaded city. Despite the distant sounds of guns, they carried on with their daily chores, finding solace in small moments of order. The twins diligently dusted and arranged chairs, even enjoying a brief respite by a stained-glass window during lunchtime. As they ventured outside, they encountered the unsettling presence of German soldiers and witnessed the destruction caused by bombardment. Despite the fear and uncertainty that plagued their nights, the people of Rheims remained resilient. With each passing day, the Germans' arrogance grew, instilling a sense of dread among the city's residents.

One morning, Mother Meraut and the Twins left home early to reach the Cathedral before an expected bombardment. Madame Coudert, washing her window, accidentally damaged a poster due to rain.

The townspeople, including Pierre and Pierrette, joyously welcomed the soldiers back to Rheims.

Pierre and Pierrette hurriedly distributed sweets to the soldiers, joining the townspeople in showing gratitude with candies, chocolates, and flags.

"In the hospital, doctors in white coats and nurses with red crosses on their sleeves tended to the wounded. Two scared children followed the Verger down the aisle.

Mother Meraut was about to enter the shop to speak to Madame Coudert when a loud roar shook the air. Startled, she gathered her children close, likening the sound to thunder. Realizing the danger, she urged them to rush to the cellar for safety. Before they could move, another explosion rocked the area, causing panic.

The people of Rheims were angry at the Germans for burning their Cathedral. Guns were pointed at the helpless Germans, but the Archbishop and Abby stood in their way, willing to sacrifice themselves. The Archbishop's bravery moved the crowd, who then helped the wounded soldiers. Father Meraut, a wounded soldier, was carried to safety by the crowd, showing gratitude despite the chaos. The Cathedral burned, but a symbol of France appeared, giving hope. Father Meraut was cared for by his family and the community, finding solace at home despite the ongoing shelling by the Germans.

Pierre and Pierrette played outside daily near their home, entertaining themselves as they had no one else to play with. Pierrette built a playhouse in a corner of their courtyard, keeping broken dishes there along with her doll, Jacqueline. Sometimes Pierre joined her, showing a shy interest in Jacqueline. When shells fell, they sought refuge in the cellar. Their mother stayed by their father's side in the kitchen as he couldn't move. Weeks passed, and the once magnificent Cathedral lay in ruins, its treasures lost. Mother Meraut carried the burden of knowing lives were lost, including little Jean, the Verger's son. She found solace in the untouched statue of Jeanne d'Arc. With schools destroyed, classes were held in underground champagne cellars for safety. Pierre and Pierrette, along with other children, continued their studies there, their faces pale from spending so much time below ground.|"['1.

"""There will be few pleasure-seekers on the river this summer,"" replied the boatman. ""The boat will be safer with you than sitting at the pier, especially with the risk of it being hit by a shell.

The boatman waved until they were far into the stream. Father Meraut rowed smoothly, guiding the boat effortlessly. The spring air was refreshing, with blooming trees and buzzing bees.

On a peaceful afternoon, the Meraut family drifted along the river, enjoying the open country. As night approached, the chill set in, prompting Mother Meraut to suggest making camp. They found a spot to land, and Pierre and Pierrette quickly gathered materials for a fire. Soon, the aroma of coffee and sizzling eggs filled the air, satisfying their hunger. Under the stars and the glow of the crescent moon, Pierrette's sighting of the new moon over her right shoulder brought hope for good luck. The family slept under the stars near a straw-stack, waking to birdsong. The following days brought warm weather, aiding their journey.

The station agent had a challenging time handling the goats and pigs as they were being transported back to Fontanelle.
