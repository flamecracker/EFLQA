In early June, the Boy Scout Camera Club camped on a West Virginia mountaintop after a two-week journey. Three mules were resting in a corral while the boys set up their tent below the summit.

"The boys hurried to the tent and found Uncle Ike, a tall, awkward mule, munching on stolen ham. ""Uncle Ike always looks like he's at a serious meeting,"" Jimmie chuckled as Ned shooed the mule away. While the mule rejoined its group, Jimmie and Teddy prepared supper with tinned goods and provisions. Wanting some game, the boys dashed off into a canyon.

Ned sat before the campfire, discussing the need to keep Uncle Ike, the mule, and the boys, Jimmie and Teddy, safe in the mountains. Worried about the boys getting lost, the group added wood to the fire to signal their location. Oliver, feeling impatient and anxious, checked if the fire's glow was visible from afar.

"""That's good advice, mother,"" Ned said. ""Two will go and two will remain here. In a short time the two out in the hills will return, and then there will be a good-sized guard for what little stuff we have.""

""You remember the Indian signal for help you saw in the valley?"" asked Frank, in a moment. ""Well, they may have seen that, too, and taken a notion to find out about it. They went in that direction when they left the camp.""

""That may be the reason for their delay,"" Ned answered. ""We should have attended to that signal ourselves,"" he added. ""There may have been some one in serious trouble down there. I hope the boys did go--that is, if nothing happens to them because of their going. Boy Scouts should assist each other at every opportunity.""

After a little more talk regarding the boy who had been sent to Mary Brady by her son in Washington, and after Buck had been given a couple of cups of steaming hot coffee, the four started down the slope to the west.

Oliver sat by the fire for a short time and then went up to the summit to look over the valley. The moon was rising now, and he could see the four who had recently left the camp working their way over a ridge to the south and west.

"Jimmie gestured to a crack in the rock, urging Oliver to peek inside. A beam of light pierced the cave, revealing a room below with a blazing fire and figures moving about. Frank proposed, ""What if there's no boy in the cabin at all? The plotters know we're in the mountains seeking the prince. This could be a trap."" Ned agreed, realizing their interest in the child might have compromised their mission. As they hastened to catch up with Buck and Mrs. Brady, they reached a narrow trail leading to a green valley.

Ned, eager to leave, mentioned the child's unruly behavior and the need to move on. Ned advised letting the mule lead them, trusting its instincts to follow known paths.

Three boys, Jimmie, Teddy, and Oliver, swiftly grabbed their guns and electronics from the alcove. The sounds of gunfire outside grew distant, making their escape seem promising. Led by Dode, they navigated through a long passage to a plank door, tightly shut from the inside. Upon opening it, they were met with a view of the valley and mountains under the clear night sky. As they heard shots and mule cries from the south, they devised a plan to trick the counterfeiters. Climbing the rocky slope, they paused to catch their breath and observed the outlaws retreating to their cave. Jimmie suggested using their cameras to document the scene, speculating on Frank's absence.

Jack was excited and couldn't contain the news. He revealed that Judd Bradley, a blonde man, had brought the boy along with compliments from Mrs. Brady just an hour ago.

Jimmie was surprised by Uncle Ike's behavior, muttering about his decline. Jack wondered when they would return to Washington with the prince and if Ned would flirt with the girl who brought him in.

Ned and his friends, Jimmie and Frank, ventured towards the counterfeiters' cave armed with cameras. They captured images of the rugged slope, the deep canyon, and the lush valleys around them. As they cautiously entered the cave, the eerie darkness enveloped them. Ned illuminated the room with his electric light, revealing scattered counterfeit money, a dormant melting pot, and eerie shadows. Jimmie suggested a dramatic pose to add authenticity to their photos.

Frank and Ned spent time exploring the cave where counterfeit coins were made, taking pictures and examining the tools used. When they realized their friend Jimmie was missing, they searched but couldn't find him. Ned and Frank then ventured outside and encountered Mrs. Mary Brady at her cabin, where her grandson played nearby. Ned, suspicious of her silence about the previous night's gunshots, decided to explain to her that they were not there to spy on anyone, but to enjoy the mountain air and take photographs.

Frank mentioned that a friend went missing in a hidden passage while trying to create a picturesque effect. Initially thinking it was a joke, they did not pay much attention to his absence. Regretting their oversight, they realized they could have rescued him. Frank quickly prepared his film roll for printing, using two powders to develop the film efficiently. With the boys gathered around, they examined a snapshot of the secret passage entrance. Ned expressed the need to think independently and not focus solely on a theory. Upon a second search of the cave, they found a broken wall leading to a small room where the missing boy might have been taken. The group then observed Jack watching a cabin where a child was being cared for by Mrs. Brady and Bradley, who retrieved a mysterious green parcel from a suitcase.|"['1.

Ned cautiously observed the mysterious actions of a man in a remote cabin. The man concocted a strange mixture with a black dye, which he poured into a cup. Curious about the man's intentions, Ned discreetly made notes in his book. As he ventured further, following signs left by someone, Ned realized he might be walking into a trap. The trail led him through forests and rocky slopes, hinting at a hidden danger lurking in the mountains.

The boy ventured through the bushes for a while but found no clues. Unsure of what to do next, he settled in a thicket and waited, passing the time by taking pictures. He pondered if Jack might have waited for him somewhere along the path as they were not far apart. After an hour, he climbed a tree to scan the area. Jack explained that he had spotted two mysterious men near a tree line and decided to follow them, suspecting Jimmie's presence in the area. The boys, exhausted and hungry, stayed hidden, snapping photos occasionally. As darkness fell, they observed the mountain, hoping for a sign. Jack suggested confronting a boy they suspected of being involved.

Jack and Ned were walking back to camp, and Jack was not happy about it. He kept expressing his displeasure as they walked through the thicket. But Ned didn't seem bothered by Jack's complaints. Ned complimented Jack on finding and following their trail and leading the way. He assured Jack that they had achieved more than he realized. As they approached the cabin, Ned knocked on the door, and Mrs. Brady welcomed them in, though Ned sensed her stress. Inside, they discussed the counterfeiters' demands. Jack, feeling frustrated, whistled as they left the cabin. Ned instructed Mrs. Brady discreetly, and they left for camp. Ned left a note at the cave and planned to wake up at midnight. Jack, still grumbling, decided to eat and rest. They had a plan to deal with the outlaws but needed to keep it secret from the others.|"[""1.

Ned quickly settled into his bunk and started studying a French dictionary under the soft glow of his electric candle. Soon after, he drifted off into a deep slumber. By midnight, the group was prepared to set off, with Teddy instructed to stay vigilant for any sounds from the south. As they trekked over rocks and around crags, Frank inquired about their next destination, suggesting capturing moonlight photos for his father's newspaper. Eager to contribute, Ned vowed to provide photos for the upcoming Boy Scout trip to secure funds. Upon reaching the ridge's summit, they encountered a towering chimney rock, resembling a fortress, with a campfire visible in the nearby canyon. Observing a man emerging from beneath the rock, the boys suspected an underground hideout, prompting them to keep a watchful eye on the mysterious activities below.|"['1.

Frank assured his friend that he would be cautious not to be caught by the men they were observing. He suspected Jimmie might be hiding under a rock nearby. The boys carefully circled back north, using rocks and ridges as cover. Eventually, they reached the northern end of a cut where the men were cooking. The men, engrossed in their meal preparations, grumbled occasionally. One man found the tracks of others and expressed frustration at not noticing them earlier. The men discussed leaving, feeling abandoned by their companions. Jimmie emerged from a hiding spot, pretending to be a hungry scout. The men, suspicious, hurriedly packed their belongings.

Two men were warned to keep pace or face a bullet if they tried to escape. Suddenly, a bear's growl scared them. Frank skillfully mimicked bear sounds, causing the men to freeze. Jimmie, pretending to be scared, mentioned bears at their camp. When Jimmie ran towards the noise, the men chased him until Frank fired a shot, making them flee in fear. Despite Ned's calls to stop, the men ran recklessly, leaping over obstacles. Frank and Jimmie, amused, watched the men disappear.

Jimmie was not tied up initially because he engaged the captors in conversation, pretending to appreciate their society. However, when night fell and they needed to rest, they secured him with a harness. Jimmie's arrival was met with excitement from the boys and even a greeting from Uncle Ike. Teddy prepared an impressive breakfast for Jimmie. Shortly after, Bradley arrived at the camp, looking surprised and concerned to see Jimmie. Ned noticed Bradley's reaction but maintained a friendly demeanor. Ned explained that they needed to wait for the right moment to confront Bradley. Ned and Jack quickly left to reach the cottage.

Frank and Jimmie whispered to each other, unsure about what to do with the prisoner they had captured easily but were finding difficult to keep. Frank suggested a hidden cave nearby, but Jimmie was distracted by the sight of men approaching in the distance. As they hurried towards the summit, they spotted the camp and Teddy with Uncle Ike. Inside the camp, they found scattered belongings and a figure lying motionless on the floor, possibly Dode. Oliver was missing, and two men were seen going through papers.

The Boy Scout Camera Club embarked on a journey to West Virginia through Washington, unbeknownst to the abductors' acquaintances. It appears the prince had already set off for the mountains before the plotters realized our involvement. The conspirators devised a plan to distract us by introducing a false prince for us to interact with. They manipulated the real boy into pretending to be the prince, altering his appearance and teaching him phrases in French. Despite their efforts, the boy's grandmother noticed his subdued behavior and their deception. The conspirators expected us to search elsewhere once we uncovered the ruse, but we caught on sooner than they anticipated.

The morning began with the boy speaking French, but his knowledge seemed superficial. There was a strong Washington vibe around him, not quite fitting for a prince. Upon closer inspection, it was evident that he had been disguised. Ned couldn't confirm the boy's presence the day before due to the chaos caused by the escape of two men who had taken Jimmie. Ned's plan to interrogate them was foiled. Despite this, Ned managed to mislead the conspirators by linking Jimmie's capture to the counterfeiters. The need for secrecy diminished once the disguise was uncovered. Ned reassured that they would locate the boy, especially if Frank and Jimmie succeeded in implicating Bradley. The focus now shifted to returning to camp and reviewing progress. Jack was tasked with delivering a crucial message that could not wait.

As they reached the valley, the boys marveled at the landscape, with mountains ahead and the South Branch valley in the distance. Riding mules, they attracted attention from onlookers. Upon reaching the city, they entered a telegraph office to send a message. The clerk questioned the message type, suspecting something was amiss. The boys advised to send it promptly, hinting at urgency. A suspicious gentleman later entered the office, raising concerns of being followed. A message arrived instructing them to wait for motor cars from Cumberland for a quick getaway. Mysterious faces lurked outside the telegraph office, signaling potential danger. Late at night, two touring cars arrived, signaling a dramatic turn of events.|"[""1.

When Jimmie returned, the clerk and Jack were squeezed into the back seat of the car, leaving a vacant seat in the front car for him. The engines roared, and the cars sped off with faint cheers from the onlookers. An hour later, they reached the foothills at the south end of the ridge. The driver stopped, and the distant sound of galloping horses could be heard from the north. Meanwhile, Ned, Oliver, and Teddy waited at camp, expecting signs of Jack and Jimmie or their pursuers. Ned decided to head to Chimney Rock alone but instructed the boys about signaling with rockets if needed.

Ned carefully planned his trap, knowing the prince was still present. Despite uncertain victory, he moved cautiously along a steep slope, risking ledges to reach the cave guarded by a man. Meanwhile, Frank and the team searched for Mike III. After tracking suspects to a ravine, they arrested them, communicating in a foreign language. As they waited by a stream, the chief inquired about the moon's rise. Suddenly, a scuffle ensued, leading to Ned subduing the guard. With the old lady's guidance, they found a hidden passage. Frank helped restrain the conspirators as they slept, securing their wrists with handcuffs.|"['1.
