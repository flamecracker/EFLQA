Mother Mitchel summoned all the farmers' wives to gather fresh eggs for her grand project. The hens were distraught, mourning their lost hopes as the milkmaids tirelessly milked cows for twenty thousand pails of milk. The calves were put on half rations, causing unrest among the cows. Despite some mishaps, the workers remained enthusiastic. Mother Mitchel then requested a thousand pounds of butter, prompting churns within a twenty-mile radius to work vigorously. The butter was tasted, shaped into pats, and packed. Mother Mitchel was seen as a sorceress due to her extraordinary cat, Fanfreluche. She was always obeyed promptly. On the designated day, millers arrived with flour, each sack meticulously weighed. Mother Mitchel's cat oversaw the process.

All the ingredients for the tart were prepared. Mother Mitchel instructed the children to peel the apples and pears and remove the seeds. The weather was delightful, so the girls worked outside in rows on the ground. The sun shone brightly upon them. Each child had a large clay pan and tirelessly peeled the apples. When the pans were full, they were replaced. The children also removed the peels to avoid being buried in them. Nearby, other children were pitting plums, cherries, and peaches. This task was given to the youngest ones and took place in the old schoolhouse, now repurposed. The cat supervised them and growled if he caught them eating the fruit. Grating sugar was a challenging chore, but Mother Mitchel supported them energetically. Robust boys broke cones of sugar, and everyone grated until exhausted. Mother Mitchel performed a miracle by ensuring all the sugar was used. Next, the eager helpers broke seven thousand eggs, separating the yolks and whites skillfully. This required talent and care, with some mishaps along the way. The yolks and whites were beaten separately in wooden bowls by two teams, yellow and white, to achieve the needed lightness. Despite the fatigue and hand cramps, the task was completed with everyone contributing equally.|['1.

Mother Mitchel's grand task had begun. She transitioned from being the leader to being hands-on. The first challenge was turning the abundance of fruit into sweet treats. With ten massive kettles, each the size of a dining table, she toiled for two days. A team of helpers kept the fires burning as Mother Mitchel stirred the boiling fruit with a spoon so large it took four cooks to lift. Expert tasters gave updates every half hour. The sweetmeats turned out perfect in consistency, color, and scent. Mother Mitchel never accepted failure. To cool the treats, she used large stone bowls, unlike the usual smaller jars. Little Toto's antics added to the chaos. Two hundred new kneading troughs were used to make dough for the grand structure. Mother Mitchel's detailed plan guided the bakers, who worked in unison like a disciplined army. The monument's interior, divided into compartments for different fruits, was constructed meticulously by skilled cooks.|"[""1.

When the sweet treats were all gone and the cooks returned to earth, Mother Mitchel and the noble Fanfreluche inspected each compartment. Mother Mitchel, unfazed by the sweets, approved the work. The final touch was to place the crust, or dome, atop the colossal tart. The engineer-in-chief, with precision, used balloons to place the dome perfectly. The next challenge was cooking the enormous tart. Many doubted it could be done, but Mother Mitchel had a plan. She summoned masons with baked bricks to build a massive furnace around the tart. With thirty ovens lit and smoke billowing, the people rejoiced. Poets and musicians sang praises to the prince and Mother Mitchel.

During the week, black Cæsar's hard work with slaughtering and dressing chickens and turkeys significantly reduced the stock for the big dinner.

"Only these four had kept New England's festival beneath that roof. The vacant chair at John Inglefield's right hand was in memory of his wife, whom death had snatched from him since the previous Thanksgiving. With a feeling that few would have looked for in his rough nature, the bereaved husband had himself set the chair in its place next his own; and often did his eye glance hitherward, as if he deemed it possible that the cold grave might send back its tenant to the cheerful fireside, at least for that one evening. Thus did he cherish the grief that was dear to him. But there was another grief which he would fain have torn from his heart; or, since that could never be, have buried it too deep for others to behold, or for his own remembrance. Within the past year another member of his household had gone from him, but not to the grave. Yet they kept no vacant chair for her.

While John Inglefield and his family were sitting round the hearth with the shadows dancing behind them on the wall, the outer door was opened, and a light footstep came along the passage. The latch of the inner door was lifted by some familiar hand, and a young girl came in, wearing a cloak and hood, which she took off and laid on the table beneath the looking-glass. Then, after gazing a moment at the fireside circle, she approached, and took the seat at John Inglefield's"|"['1.

"""It's a picture from the past,"" murmured Ezra quietly. ""I almost forgot about it, but now it's all coming back to me like an old friend. I feel like I'm a part of it, and the memories of that time flood back with the picture."" As Ezra reminisced to himself, he recalled the scene vividly. It was Thanksgiving morning in Belchertown, with the chilly air and the promise of a day filled with adventure. The boys were gearing up for a morning of skating on the frozen pond, with the Holyoke hills to the north and the Berkshire Mountains looming in the west. The group, including the Dickerson boys and Laura, the minister's daughter, set off on an icy adventure, braving the cold and enjoying the freedom of the open ice.

Ezra thought about the Thanksgiving breakfast with his family. They were hungry after a race on the pond. Mother praised her boys' appetites. They enjoyed sausages, fried potatoes, buckwheat cakes, and maple syrup from Father's sugar bush. The family busily prepared for the day, cracking walnuts for pies and stuffing the turkey. Tryphena Foster helped out, wearing a gingham gown. Ezra fondly remembered his father, sitting in the parlour, lost in memories of his youth. The family attended church in the old frame meeting-house on the hill. The minister read the proclamation, and they sang hymns in the choir. Sam Merritt visited from Palmer, singing tenor, while Laura sang soprano. The family cherished these Thanksgiving traditions.|"['1.

On Thanksgiving Day in Belchertown, Ezra recounts the day's events. He listens to the minister's sermon about gratitude while worrying if Laura is paying attention or passing notes.

The cellar is cozy and dim, filled with cobwebs except where Mother stores perishables like butter and eggs. Barrels of apples line the walls, near the potato bin, emitting a fresh aroma. Laura spots a mouse, causing her to shiver and want to climb onto a barrel. I reassure her, feeling as strong as a steer. When asked about his favorite apples, Ezra chooses Baldwins for their red cheeks like Laura's. As they enjoy the apples, the candle goes out, and Laura screams. Despite the chaos, Ezra, almost a man, comforts Laura, aware of her orphan status. Mother eventually finds them, showing understanding and tenderness. The scene evokes memories of home and gratitude.

As the weeks passed with slow progress and continued weather, a farmer expressed his frustration to his wife, friends, and passersby about the crops. The discontent echoed across the cornfield, where the plants toiled and waited. People hoped for rain to fill the corn ears. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, winds howled, and thunder roared. A storm struck, and the corn plants bowed before the rain-laden blast, resilient and hopeful. Though some fell, the damage was minimal. The farmer, angered by the few damaged patches, forgot the thriving fields. His wife prayed for the crops and their well-being. After the rain's abundance, fear arose of mildew.
