It was agreed that any extra time taken by a boat to catch up with the others would be deducted from that boat's time. So, the hope was that the missing third boat would show up. In the morning, they waited patiently at the station for the third boat, even if it meant delaying their journey for days as per the rules of the Dixie cup race. Herb explained that the engine worked fine, but they had to slow down due to a close encounter with a steamboat. The friends discussed a bank robbery and suspected that the thieves might have escaped in a motorboat. They debated if they should inform the authorities and compared their boat's performance during the race.|"[""1.

Jack and his crew embarked on a long race, with the boats speeding off like released greyhounds. The crew of the _Tramp_ watched the competing boats for hours. As they approached the merging rivers, the boats navigated through the bustling Mississippi, reaching St. Louis. Jack skillfully steered through the river traffic. They anchored at a promising spot for the night. While Jack checked the engine and maps, Jimmie prepared a stew for supper. Jimmie noticed signs of a current and a motorboat nearby. As they enjoyed their meal, they discussed their observations and the strategies for the race ahead.|['1.

"""Have you ever heard anything like it?"" he asked. ""Next, you'll be telling me the type of boat it is, I suppose. Listen, Jack, do you think it could be that same dirty craft mentioned in the newspaper, resembling the old _Tramp_?"" ""Oh! There's probably only a one in twenty chance of that,"" chuckled the other. ""Imagine both boats choosing this creek out of all the ones south of St. Louis? That would be too amusing. It's most likely just a regular motor boat; and those on board probably don't want to meet us any more than we want to meet them. So, there you have it."" At nine, he told Jimmie to sleep while he stayed up until eleven, promising to wake him. Jimmie, confident in Jack's watch, curled up in his blanket and soon his deep breathing indicated he had found peace in sleep.

The officer, with a sneer in his voice, mentioned a reward for capturing the boys and finding the stolen goods. Despite the officer's skepticism, Jack explained how they came across a newspaper clipping about a bank robbery. He reasoned that they were innocent and had connections to the town where the newspaper was published. The captain, observing Jack's honesty, handed over the paper for inspection. The officer, disappointed by the lack of evidence, read about a race involving the boys and a prize donated by a local figure. Jack pointed out the boat's name, matching the one in the article.

Jack and Jimmie were on their boat, trying to evade a group of officers. The captain asked Jack to help them chase the officers down the river with his fast boat, but Jack declined. He explained that his boat was not ready for immediate use and that they had promised not to travel after dark unless necessary. The captain understood and left. Jack and Jimmie spent the night on the boat, and in the morning, they continued their journey down the river. Jack worked on the engine, and Jimmie prepared breakfast.

Jimmie and Jack were enjoying a smooth ride on the river, with Jimmie admiring the water and Jack steering the boat expertly. They marveled at the vastness of the merging rivers and the strong currents. Jack skillfully navigated the boat near the shore to avoid the dangers of the swift current. As they searched for a safe spot to spend the night, they discussed the possibility of encountering law enforcement or thieves. Eventually, they found a peaceful cove to rest for the night without any disturbances. Jimmie even boasted about his successful flapjack making, devouring most of the batch himself. The next morning, they anticipated a relaxing Sunday and hoped to reunite with their friend George aboard the _Comfort_.

It was a long morning for the boys. They took turns going ashore to stretch their legs, feeling cramped from the small boat. Jimmie speculated about the absence, suggesting it might be an alligator or their boat, the _Comfort_. Jack worried about the speed boat's motor and the possibility of a breakdown.

They found a safe harbor but couldn't rest due to worry. Josh teased Jack for not sleeping, and they prepared a meal. Jimmie observed the boss cook while Jack and Herb shared stories.

Jack was burdened with worry, making it hard for him to enjoy himself. He needed to hand over the prisoners and loot before he could relax.

Thankfully, a civilian, Mr. Gregory, intervened, realizing the mistake. The boys were relieved as the situation cleared up, and they were no longer considered suspects.|"[""1.

Nick was determined to master swimming and declared he would practice every chance he got. Despite some teasing from his friends, Nick remained enthusiastic about learning.

Jack watched as Nick pointed towards a large oak tree, claiming to have seen a bear. Jack, however, had doubts about the existence of the bear. He suggested caution, warning that a wounded bear could be dangerous. Despite Nick's excitement about the prospect of bear steaks, Jack suspected that the animal might have been scared off by the noise of their camp.

""We sure do, Sheriff. I'm nearly starved. And that coffee, wow, it smells amazing,"" one of the men said, securing the hounds to a nearby tree.

""That was a close call back there,"" said George, nodding in agreement. ""Sticking with these lucky guys paid off. If we had gone ahead, we would have missed all the excitement.""

""I'm relieved we stayed back,"" said the chubby boy. ""I don't mind losing my ham; we have more food in our pockets. Those hounds looked fierce; I'm glad they weren't after me. Did you see their teeth? They could catch a convict in no time unless he climbs a tree like a squirrel.""

As the hounds' baying faded, Jack said, ""They weren't just after Erastus; they'd catch anyone given the chance. I'm glad we helped him.""

""I feel the same way,"" added Jimmie. ""I know what it's like to be hungry and hunted. I'm glad we gave him a chance.""

""I agree,"" George said. ""My dad's a lawyer, and he's cautious about aiding fugitives. But we believe Erastus is innocent, right boys?""

""Absolutely,"" Jack replied. ""If Erastus ever returns, I'd leave him some money to help him out.""

Upon following his outstretched finger, the group was stunned by what they saw. Seated in the _Wireless_ was a large African American man, Erastus, holding George's rifle left behind during breakfast. Nick was breathless, sounding like a porpoise in water. Jack hesitated to raise his gun, feeling relieved he didn't. Erastus assured them he meant no harm, explaining he could have stolen the boat but chose not to. Jack was moved by the truth in Erastus's eyes, realizing he seemed scared but not malicious. Erastus admitted hiding in a tree while the sheriff was there, fearing the dogs. Nick suggested sharing food, and Erastus professed his innocence, hoping to reach safety in Arkansas.

Jack decided to help Erastus, a hunted man, escape to safety. Despite the risks, he believed in Erastus's innocence and felt it was the right thing to do. George, though cautious, also supported the plan. Erastus, grateful and emotional, promised never to return to the troubled area. Jack hid Erastus in the boat and set off down the river, dodging the sheriff's posse. As they neared Friar's Point, George suggested finding a way to drop off Erastus safely.

On Thursday, while the train was still at the depot, we discovered that two of the eight letters we had were opened, and money was missing. We swiftly informed the postmaster, suspecting a theft. After a thorough search, the money wasn't found. We suspected the band leader, George Havens, who had access to the post office. Havens was taken to Chicago for questioning. Under pressure, he confessed to the theft, leading to the recovery of the stolen money. The postmaster, innocent of the crime, was deeply affected and left town.

The post office in Attica, Indiana, was robbed. Unknown individuals broke in through a back window on Sunday night. When the mail clerk arrived on Monday morning, the office was in disarray. The safe had been blown open, all its contents gone. The postmaster was left with barely any money to seek help. Two young men had approached a farmer, Mr. Beasley, early Monday morning, requesting a ride to Thorntown. Despite suspicions, Mr. Beasley agreed to drive them.
