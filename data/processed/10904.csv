He recalled not long ago when he sought the role of wiper at an engine round-house, secured the position, and toiled alongside the dirtiest and lowest-ranked staff of the railway. When the incident occurred, a sudden burst of light flooded the pit. A stoker, momentarily blinded by the brightness, turned away from the fiery furnaces and peered upward to soothe his sore eyes. Startled, the stoker dashed towards the ladder's base, expecting to find Frank gravely injured or worse. To his amazement, he witnessed the quick-thinking young man grab the grating, swing in, hit the ladder, grip, and slide down. Amidst the calm machinery operations, the engineer observed the scene, conversing with an assistant, while oilers and cleaners diligently worked.
