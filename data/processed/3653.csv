"""It was a great deed!"" Colonel Kenton exclaimed. ""South Carolina always speaks her mind, but here in Kentucky, some of the cold North's blood flows in our veins, and we pause to calculate.

They left the table and entered the grand room where a new fire cast a warm glow through the windows. The two men sat before the blaze, deep in thought. Harry felt excited. This was a mysterious affair, and he was going to be part of it. As he gazed out the window, he saw Travers approaching. Travers greeted them, followed by Senator Culver, a man of influence, and others. In the room, besides Harry, there were ten in total.

""We trust your judgment, Colonel,"" Senator Culver said. ""He is a strong lad. But let's get down to business. Mr. Bertrand, please tell us the next steps for South Carolina and neighboring states. South Carolina may lead, but we need others to follow to avoid being a sacrifice.""

As Harry rode along the winding road that led closer to a row of blue hills, gradually turning into mountains, he noticed the trees covered in snow. A path diverged into the hills from the main road, and as he neared it, the sound of horses approaching caught his attention. Four mountaineers, resembling Skelly, appeared in the distance, wearing fur caps and carrying rifles. They called out for Harry to stop, but his quick reflexes urged his horse forward. Despite the mountaineers firing at him, Harry's confidence grew as he realized they couldn't catch him.

As the sun ascended in the sky, casting a brilliant light, the forest began to thin out. Hills receded into the distance, revealing vast fields stretching in both directions. Surveying the landscape, he spotted smoke rising from five distant farmhouses. Convinced that his pursuers wouldn't venture into the open, he spurred his horse onward without looking back for a quarter of an hour. When he finally glanced behind, the mountaineers had vanished, confirming his hunch. Reflecting on the ordeal, he found solace in the hardening effect it would have on him. Arriving in Winton by afternoon, he left his horse at a stable under Colonel Kenton's name. Boarding a train later that evening, he felt a mix of melancholy and anticipation, leaving Pendleton behind.

A man in the train caught Harry's attention. He sat at the far end, dressed in all black, with a precise and serious demeanor. While others chatted, he remained aloof, enjoying his food and drink with impeccable manners. Harry, intrigued by the stranger's mysterious aura, observed him closely.

"""I noticed you on the train last night when you were sleeping deeply,"" he said, using the gentle tones of the Southern coast. ""Your rest was so profound, almost like a collapse. It was clear that you had been under great physical and mental strain. Even before you fell asleep, your worried expression showed that you were on an important mission.""

""I'm not a detective or a conspirator,"" he continued. ""These are times when people travel on urgent journeys. I myself am on one now, heading home to Charleston, South Carolina. Your resemblance to someone I know caught my attention.""

""Then let's go together,"" Colonel Talbot suggested. ""Many are traveling to Charleston, the most renowned city since South Carolina's secession. We'll find a hotel and stay quiet while in Nashville until we can catch our next train in the afternoon.""

The inn was full, the clerk explained. Many visitors had flocked to the town due to the commotion from Charleston. Only one room was available, furnished with two beds. Harry would have preferred his own room, but his trust in Colonel Talbot was unwavering. The Colonel seemed genuine, without a hint of deceit. As they settled in the room, Colonel Talbot locked the door and gazed out the window. The night revealed a somber view of the town, the river, and distant hills. With a heavy heart, he confided in Harry about the turmoil in South Carolina. Despite his love for the Union, his loyalty to his state compelled him to stand by its decision.

Harry was amazed as he gazed at the colonel, who appeared lost in thought despite calling his name. The colonel's vivid imagination had transported him far into the future, momentarily forgetting Harry's presence. With a sudden shrug, the colonel snapped back to reality. Later, as Harry hurriedly undressed and settled under the covers, the colonel retired more leisurely. Thoughts of their upcoming destination, Charleston, filled Harry's mind, overshadowing the colonel's ominous words. The city's significance in Southern history intrigued Harry. The next morning, Harry woke to find the colonel already dressed. They joined the bustling breakfast crowd, where Charleston was the main topic. Seated with three men, including a legislator and a merchant, Harry overheard discussions about Southern secession and peaceful independence.

"""No, I didn't mention when,"" answered Colonel Talbot firmly. ""Harry and I might stay in Nashville for a bit. Charleston doesn't need us yet, but tensions are high. There's been a lot of angry talk for years, making them wary of northerners. It wouldn't take much to spark trouble."" The colonel locked eyes with Shepard, who avoided his gaze. Harry sensed an unspoken exchange between them, a subtle but strong warning. Despite this, Harry trusted Shepard. As they left for the lobby, the colonel avoided Shepard in the bustling room.

The colonel and he stood by the road as the driver waited. After bidding farewell, Harry hopped back on the stage, heading into Charleston. The city bustled more than Nashville.

After a restful night, Harry woke early, determined to avoid Shepard. He hurried through breakfast with Madame Delaunay and St. Clair, who greeted him warmly. The morning was crisp as Harry set out to explore Charleston. St. Clair shared news about Fort Sumter's strategic move. The tension between South Carolina and the Union was palpable, with cannons aimed. Harry, though young, sensed the gravity of the situation.

"""It has to be, Harry,"" said St. Clair, who was watching him closely. ""If it comes to a crisis we must fire upon it. If we don't, the South will be enslaved and black ignorance and savagery will be enthroned upon our necks.""

The Battery and all the harbor were now lined with the men, women, and children of Charleston. Harry saw soldiers moving about Sumter, but no demonstration of any kind occurred there. He had not thought hitherto about the garrison of the forts in Charleston harbor. He recognized for the first time that they might not share the opinions of Charleston, and this name of Anderson was full of significance for him.

""I don't believe he'll do it,"" said Harry impulsively. Some touched him on the shoulder, and turning quickly he saw Colonel Leonidas Talbot. He shook the colonel's hand with vigor and introduced him to young St. Clair.

The wind had risen a little, and it whipped about the staff. Its fluttering motions seemed to Harry more significant than ever of defiance. He understood the melancholy ring in Colonel Talbot's voice. He, too, like the boy's father, had fought under that flag, the same flag that had led him up the flame-swept slopes of Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec.

The small boat that he had predicted put out from Sumter and quickly landed at the Battery. It contained three commissioners, prominent men of"|"['1.

As Harry and his friend Arthur were leaving the battery site, they encountered a young man named Shepard who seemed focused on the preparations for defense. Despite Harry's attempt to avoid Shepard, they were introduced by Colonel Talbot. Shepard expressed concern about the Federal garrison at Sumter, but maintained a cheerful demeanor. Later, Harry noticed Shepard near the batteries throughout the day but avoided further interaction. That evening, at Madame Delaunay's inn, Shepard joined the guests for dinner, where an air of constraint lingered. Harry and Arthur then explored Charleston, visiting historic sites and observing the Union flag still flying over Sumter.

Harry entered his room, opening the window for fresh air, hearing voices below. He saw Colonel Talbot and Madame Delaunay in the piazza. Feeling the weight of their presence, he closed the blind, sensing an old romance. Days passed, and Harry felt the city's allure, partly due to Colonel Talbot's influence. His father approved of Harry's plans in a letter, sending money. The news of his cousin joining the Union home guards troubled him. Joining the Palmetto Guards, Harry became a messenger among Confederate leaders. He encountered Union officers at Fort Sumter. Despite tensions, the town and garrison maintained a friendly relationship. Harry learned of the Star of the West steaming to Fort Sumter with supplies, prompting him and St. Clair to watch from Charleston's sea wall, witnessing the tension between the fort and the city.|"['1.

Harry and Arthur shivered with excitement as they watched the South Carolina earthworks and batteries being manned. The Union firing upon each other seemed almost unbelievable to Harry. As they scanned the sea, a black dot emerged, lengthening into a plume from the Star of the West. Shepard joined them, acknowledging Harry. The crowd on the sea walls buzzed with anticipation. The ship approached, some seeing it as foreign, others as a sign of impending conflict. The tension mounted as the ship neared the harbor and the walls of Sumter. The first shot was fired, causing a hush before the second shot hit the water near the vessel. South Carolina's warning shots left an eerie silence, signaling the imminent threat of conflict.|['1.

The Star of the West slowed and stopped, followed by a triumphant shout from the crowd. However, Harry felt a sudden chill. Even young St. Clair was silent, a shadow crossing his face. Shepard had vanished without a sound. The small steamer, unable to face heavy guns, turned away towards the open sea. The crowd fell silent as smoke from the cannons drifted over the town. Harry and Arthur watched as the steamer disappeared on the horizon. News arrived that Mississippi had also seceded, followed by other states like Florida and Alabama. Excitement grew in Charleston as more states joined. A convention was planned in Montgomery, Alabama, to form a new government. Harry learned about Jefferson Davis, a brave soldier and former Secretary of War, and other key figures in the secession movement. The path to forming a new nation was set, despite challenges from border states.|"[""1.

Harry and St. Clair were having busy and mostly happy days. Harry trained with his friend in the Palmetto Guards. They were getting ready to go to Montgomery for the new president's inauguration. The North seemed quiet, and Sumter stood alone. The Palmetto flag flew proudly everywhere except at Sumter. There were no fights between Sumter and its neighbors. Small boats carried supplies and news between the fort and the city. Major Anderson in Sumter learned of states leaving the Union. The South gathered weapons and supplies. The leaders were pleased with the progress. Harry noticed the North seemed slow to act. The Confederate convention in Montgomery was forming a new government quickly. Jefferson Davis was likely to be President. Harry and Arthur were getting ready to leave for Montgomery. Harry felt more mature after spending time in Charleston during this intense period.|"['1.

The night before their trip, they sat on the porch of Madame Delaunay's inn. Colonel Leonidas Talbot and Major Hector St. Hilaire joined them. They were also bound for Montgomery. It was a warm mid-February evening, feeling more like spring. The southern wind carried scents of fresh foliage and roses. The sky shone silver over the city, bay, and forts. War seemed distant, but the sight of Sumter's flag reminded them otherwise. Colonel Talbot shared his thoughts on an impending great war, overshadowing past conflicts. Later, they chased a spy, Shepard, through the streets. Despite the pursuit, Shepard managed to escape. The next day, Harry and his companions embarked on a journey to Montgomery, where Davis and Stephens would be inaugurated as President and Vice-President.|"['1.

Trains were slow as Harry and Arthur journeyed through a low, rolling country, crossing rivers and seeing large houses and small negro cabins. The region was still recovering from winter, but greenery was beginning to emerge in the valleys. Spring was in the air, lifting the spirits of the young Palmetto Guards. Arriving in Montgomery on the Alabama River, they awaited the inauguration of President Jefferson Davis. Despite their eagerness, the strict discipline of Colonel Talbot and Major St. Hilaire kept them in line. The guards, mostly South Carolinians, set up camp near the town. That night, as the chill of early spring settled in, the troops gathered around fires, cooking bacon, ham, and coffee. Harry, tired but content, sat by the fire with his comrades, including the cheerful Tom Langdon, anticipating the events that lay ahead.|"['1.

"""Why worry when it's just a grand adventure?"" Langdon exclaimed excitedly. ""If the Yankees interfere, we'll show them to mind their own business. A march to New York, Philadelphia, and Boston at someone else's expense sounds appealing."" Harry, however, viewed it differently. ""The Yankees will put up a fight, but we're skilled outdoorsmen. Our expertise in horsemanship, hunting, and marksmanship will be valuable,"" he explained. Langdon, ever the optimist, shared his ambitions of becoming a general or a renowned politician.

We were a small group facing the iron rain that day, yet many would have given much to be at Monterey with us. Harry, moved by memories, recalled his father's words about the gallant Mexican fighters. At Frankfort, they honored Kentucky's fallen heroes with O'Hara's poem. The sentimental era was filled with poetry, but as night fell, solemn thoughts emerged. Langdon, breaking the seriousness, shared a poem by Holmes lamenting South Carolina's secession. Despite the poem's accusations, Langdon defended their departure with pride, not passion. They enjoyed a hearty supper by the fire, basking in its warmth, while sentinels patrolled in the shadows. Harry realized the weight of military discipline, knowing leaving was no longer a choice. The reality of their impending duties began to sink in.|"[""1.

Their big day arrived. Bright sunlight bathed the town, the hills, and the brown Alabama waters. It was a uniquely Southern place, Harry noted, different from his Kentucky, more spirited, perhaps, and less concerned about consequences. People arrived not just by train, but also in wagons and on horseback from distant lands. Distinguished men wore long black coats, wide-brimmed black hats, and white shirts with shiny or heavily ruffled fronts. The excitement was palpable, even among the black residents, despite the looming war. Eager to explore Montgomery, Harry and his friends refrained from asking permission, as Colonel Talbot had adamantly denied all requests. Adorned in their pristine uniforms, they were ordered to line up after a hearty breakfast, ready to march into town. The sight of the well-dressed soldiers drew cheers from the growing crowd. Harry, with a small sword at his side, felt a surge of pride as they paraded through the enthusiastic onlookers. The South Carolinians, a standout group, exuded confidence. As they neared the capitol dome, the Guards, carrying the Palmetto flag, redirected their path toward the railway station. Standing at attention, the soldiers, though motionless, were filled with anticipation. Colonel Talbot and Major St. Hilaire stood prominently ahead, overseeing the troops.

Harry was awestruck by his first sight of Jefferson Davis, the President-elect. Contrary to his expectations, Davis appeared as a cold, gray, and silent man with tightly pressed lips. Instead of the fiery passion associated with the South, Harry observed a demeanor of reserve and icy resolve akin to the North. As Davis acknowledged the cheering crowd with nods but no smiles, Harry noted the sternness that never wavered. The procession led to a grand hotel where Yancey, a renowned orator, welcomed Davis on behalf of the Southern people. Harry, among the front row, absorbed every moment, his eyes fixed on Davis. Despite the applause and speeches, Davis remained stoic, his thoughts concealed behind his expression. Harry's attention briefly shifted to Shepard, a surprising presence in the crowd, prompting concerns based on Colonel Talbot's warnings.|"[""1.

The new President and the men on the portico captivated Harry's attention as the first act of a significant drama unfolded before him. Mr. Davis, the new leader, discussed the possibility of war and the need for a strong military. His speech, delivered with solemnity, emphasized unity and the pursuit of justice and liberty. Despite the enthusiastic cheers that followed, Harry felt a tinge of sadness from the separation of old ties. The Palmetto Guards returned to camp, and Harry, Langdon, and St. Clair explored the town with youthful excitement. Amidst the crowd of tall, muscular men in black attire, Harry pondered the future of the South. The lobby of the Exchange Hotel buzzed with optimism and discussions about the North's actions. As the smoke thickened, Harry stepped out onto the portico, feeling the weight of the historic moment.|"[""1.

The cool, fresh air of the February night felt like a gift from above. Harry stood where Jefferson Davis had once stood, imagining the weight of being chosen by millions. As he closed his eyes, lost in the moment, he noticed Shepard lurking nearby. Suspicion grew as Harry realized Shepard was spying on the Confederacy. With a pistol at his side, Harry followed Shepard into the dark alleyways of Montgomery, a town settling into the quiet of the night. Despite the urge to confront Shepard, Harry hesitated, unwilling to harm someone who posed no immediate threat. Eventually, Harry found himself face to face with Shepard, who held him at gunpoint under the moon's glow, revealing a face of determination. Harry knew he was at Shepard's mercy.|"['1.

Shepard warmly shook the boy's hand before vanishing into the woods. Harry, deep in thought from their encounter, headed back to Montgomery. Approaching the Exchange Hotel, he hoped to reunite with his friends and return to camp. However, the late hour revealed a silent, darkened hotel. Inside, he encountered Jefferson Davis, his face illuminated by moonlight but bearing a somber expression. Harry sensed the weight of impending war in the air. Observing Davis lost in thought, gazing northward, Harry realized the gravity of the situation. Days later, as they journeyed back to Charleston, news of the new President's inauguration spread unease. Despite uncertainties, the Palmetto Guards remained optimistic, anticipating a bright future for their nation. Langdon's infectious enthusiasm mirrored their hope for Charleston's prosperity.|"[""1.

The group of Guards sang together on the train, blending their voices above the noise of the engine. They sang a mix of songs, including plaintive negro melodies. Harry enthusiastically joined in, inspired by the music and the presence of Jefferson Davis. As they traveled, the signs of spring surrounded them - the land was green, trees in fresh leaf, and birds singing in the woods. Approaching Charleston, the scent of flowers filled the air. The city, bustling with people and rich planters, felt vibrant and confident in the midst of the tension of the times. Harry observed the growing defenses around Sumter, feeling confident that Charleston harbor could withstand any threat.

Harry, a young boy from Charleston, found himself immersed in the unfolding drama of the Civil War.

Skelly's sinister plan was to wait patiently until the defenders assumed he and his men had left. Then, they would either storm the house or set it ablaze, aiming to shoot Colonel Kenton as he fled. Harry, overhearing this wicked scheme, resisted the urge to act impulsively. Carefully, he maneuvered through the garden, evading the watchful mountaineers. Reaching the town of Pendleton, he urgently sought help from Gardner, the editor, explaining the dire situation.

In just thirty minutes, a group of sixty or seventy well-armed men set out for Colonel Kenton's house. Despite a light drizzle, the moon peeked through the clouds, offering a faint light. The party moved swiftly and silently, led informally by Gardner with Harry close by. Following Harry's trail, they dashed through the garden towards the house. Startled figures fled as the Pendleton men fired shots and charged onto the lawn. The mountaineers fled into the woods, leaving behind their horses. Colonel Kenton and his friends greeted their rescuers with relief, discovering fallen foes on the lawn. The town formed a home guard against further raids, while Colonel Kenton and Harry prepared for a journey to Frankfort for a crucial state decision. Despite the state's neutral stance, the conflict between North and South was evident, with young men from Kentucky joining both sides.

Dick guided Harry to the historic old building with admiration and curiosity. The structure, built in the early days of the state, still stood strong. As they explored the grounds and then ventured inside, they felt the weight of the great men who once graced the halls, shaping not just Kentucky but the entire nation. Sitting at the desks where future debates would unfold, the boys pondered the looming question of their state's allegiance. The room, filled with memories and anticipation, was stirred by a fresh breeze, invigorating and full of promise. Suddenly, a menacing figure entered - Bill Skelly, a harbinger of conflict.

"All the mountain people are on our side,"" replied Dick calmly, ""and it's not our fault if some of the troublemakers are supporting us. You probably have your fair share of troublemakers on your side too. I heard about the attack on Uncle George's house, but that was during a time of war.

He warmly welcomed his nephew and had him sit next to him while he finished his meal. Harry informed him about Skelly's presence, to which the Colonel only muttered a few words. Afterward, the trio ventured out to witness the town buzzing with activity and political tension. Despite skirmishes in the state, there was no physical violence in Frankfort, only heated debates. The Southerners appeared to dominate the House and Senate, as observed by Harry and others. Bertrand, filled with enthusiasm, exuded confidence. Harry and Dick observed the Legislature convene from the upper lobby of the House, noticing Skelly's absence, indicating his return to camp. The next day, Dick departed for Camp Dick Robinson, leaving Harry feeling pensive.

Harry listened attentively for a long time but eventually grew tired and stepped outside to breathe in the fresh air. Despite his youth, he understood the challenge faced by the Southern leaders in requesting support from the Kentuckians. He observed the signs of a strong opposition forming rapidly, presenting a formidable front. The struggle unfolded in the historic old Capitol, marked by deepening tensions. While no violence erupted, bitterness brewed on both sides as Northern and Southern sympathizers stood firm. The little capital became a battleground as supporters flooded in, pressuring the House and Senate. Emotions ran high, fueled by love for the Union, state loyalty, and familial connections. Despite intense debates, no consensus was reached. The nation teetered on the brink of civil war, with North and South locked in a tense standoff.

Harry stood on the hill overlooking the Capitol, reading a letter that filled him with joy. He felt torn between staying with his father in Frankfort or joining his comrades in South Carolina. As he sat by the monument honoring fallen soldiers, he pondered his decision. The allure of the East, where battle awaited, grew stronger. Despite the peaceful surroundings at dusk, Harry's thoughts drifted to war. However, his feelings were not personal but a result of his noble upbringing.

Harry stood on the riverbank, the song from the raft growing louder. The raft moved slowly along the current. As darkness enveloped the scene, Harry expected to see a light from the men's hut on the raft. Mesmerized by the singer's voice echoing down the river, Harry imagined himself in a different time. Lost in his thoughts, he didn't notice the looming figure behind him. Instinctively, he turned just in time to evade a deadly blow from the rifle-wielding mountaineer, Skelly.

"Neither had made a sound. No cries for help were heard. Skelly avoided drawing attention, and Harry later realized that the idea never crossed his mind in the intense moment. He continued to forcefully press on Skelly's throat, while Skelly struck his chest relentlessly, blows that could have been fatal if Skelly had been able to use his arms fully. Harry heard Skelly's labored breathing and saw his dark, frightening face up close. It was so hairy that it resembled the face of a large ape, with the lips curled back to reveal strong, cruel white teeth. To Harry, it felt like he was battling a wild beast. Despite the pain and bloody foam at his lips, Harry persisted in his grip on Skelly's throat, but it took immense determination. As Skelly's attacks intensified, Harry knew he was losing strength. He made a final effort to hold on, but his fingers slipped, and as Skelly struck him hard in the chest, Harry let go completely. Harry realized that another blow could knock him out, so he grabbed Skelly's chest and tripped him with all his might. They both fell, rolled over, and then Harry felt himself falling. The next moment, they were submerged in the Kentucky River, still locked in a deadly struggle, as the waves rippled away from where they had sunk.

Harry and his father joined Jarvis and Ike on a raft by a river. Jarvis, a curious mountaineer, welcomed Colonel George Kenton and offered them breakfast. Jarvis introduced his Aunt Suse, a spry old lady with tales of the past. Colonel Kenton was eager for the coffee's aroma and the delicious meal prepared on a smooth stump. Ike, the nephew, served with a grin, rarely speaking but always enjoying life. The group shared stories and enjoyed the breakfast spread with bacon, corn cakes, and good butter.

The raft had been negotiated for in advance of its journey. The plan was to hand it over to the new owners, head to the bank for payment, and then embark on a sightseeing adventure with Ike, the narrator's inquisitive nephew. However, they intended to return in two days using a boat attached to the raft. Colonel Kenton approached them, requesting to transport his son, Harry, across the mountains to Virginia. Jarvis, the narrator, consulted Ike about this unexpected proposition. After equipping Harry discreetly with essentials, they set off before sunrise. The departure was discreet, with only a handshake exchanged between Harry and his father.

Harry sat quietly in the boat, his mind lost in deep thoughts. He had grown accustomed to sudden journeys and danger, but parting with his father hit him hard. They had been more than just father and son; they were like comrades. Since he was twelve or thirteen, their close bond had shaped Harry's mind beyond his years. Now, as he headed east while his father stayed in the west, he felt the weight of a potentially long, perhaps permanent, separation. It wasn't a morbid feeling but a realization of the looming war. Despite his youth, Harry had witnessed the South's fervor and the North's resilience. As the boat glided along the Kentucky River, surrounded by nature's beauty, Harry's companions rowed in silence, respecting his contemplation. Jarvis, a man of contentment, couldn't contain his joy and broke into song as the morning unfolded its splendor around them.|"['1.

Jarvis had a rare, deep voice that filled the air as he sang with passion. Harry, feeling the power of the song, shook off his sadness and focused on the journey ahead. The boat glided through the Bluegrass, the sky above painted with golden clouds. When Harry asked to take over rowing, Ike agreed, impressed by Harry's determination. As Harry rowed, the rhythm of the oar matched the tune of Jarvis's song, filling him with energy. They journeyed on, meeting few others along the river. By nightfall, they set up camp, cooking a meal over a crackling fire. The night was cool, but the warmth of the fire and the companionship made it a cozy end to a day of hard work.|"[""1.

Jarvis, a seasoned outdoorsman, emphasized the importance of warm food after a long day of rowing. He eagerly awaited the coffee Ike was preparing over the crackling fire. Harry and Jarvis busied themselves with cooking corn cakes and bacon. Jarvis expressed how camping under the open sky invigorates both body and soul.

The melody faded, and the river's murmur grew louder. Harry was transported to a distant past, enveloped in the wilderness with towering forests. Startled back to reality by Jarvis's smile, he learned of the song's origins from a traveler. Jarvis, offering camaraderie, urged Harry to stay and enjoy the hunting and fishing in the mountains instead of risking his life in the war. Harry accepted, intrigued by the night's mystery. Later, Harry awoke to distant voices and a flickering light. Suspecting soldiers crossing the river, he roused Jarvis to investigate, leaving Ike to sleep.

"The pair quietly moved through the bushes towards the ferry crossing the river where the hills dipped low. As they approached, the sound of many voices and the glow of several lights became more distinct. Jarvis's suspicion that these were no ordinary travelers seemed accurate. ""Let's get a bit closer. The bushes will shield us,"" the mountaineer whispered to the boy. As they reached the edge of the bushes, they saw over two hundred armed men with horses being ferried across the river. Harry's focus shifted to three men standing nearby, one recognized as the popular presidential candidate Breckinridge. Sam urged Harry to join them, but Harry declined, staying true to his commitment to stick with Sam and Ike, despite the temptation.

"All the horses had crossed the river. The three leaders boarded the boat, reached the opposite shore, and rode off into the dark. Despite his determination, Harry felt a pang as the last figure vanished. ""We're watching them head south, Harry. Sometimes I dream ahead with my eyes open. I've seen horsemen riding in the night, thousands over battlefields, their horses trampling on the fallen,"" said Jarvis. ""I envision a whole nation struggling and swaying. I see things neither North nor South have dreamed of yet."" They rested briefly, then continued southeast on the river.

I dream of Hallie, sweet Hallie, a thought that lingers endlessly. She rests in the valley, where the mockingbird sings by her side. The melody fills me with a bittersweet longing, a pleasant sorrow. Memories of September cotton fields and the echoing song of the mockingbird bring warmth. As we journeyed on the boat, the rain cleared, leaving a fresh, green landscape. The current challenged us, but with practiced oars, we pushed forward towards the looming hills. Jarvis's eyes sparkled at the sight of the mountains on the horizon.

The bands proved the following day to be all that Jarvis had assured, and they continued their journey with renewed energy, pleasant weather accompanying them. They delved deeper into the mountains, a region embodying the essence of a true wilderness. Occasionally, they spotted smoke rising from log cabin chimneys, and glimpsed cabins nestled in secluded spots, yet no one greeted them. The war news had reached these parts, making the mountaineers cautious and reserved. Harry found their reticence convenient for their travels. As they navigated a southerly branch of the Kentucky River, they encountered more wildlife, with Jarvis successfully hunting a deer and two wild turkeys. Their boat journey became slower due to the strong current, prompting Harry to occasionally walk along the bank, invigorated by the mountain air. The landscape transformed into towering mountains covered in dense greenery, creating a sense of remoteness from the distant war Harry was headed towards. Their progress slowed as they rowed up a narrow mountain creek, flanked by towering peaks and lush forests. Passing only two cabins in a two-day journey, Jarvis decided to leave the boat at a trusted acquaintance's cabin, Bill Rudd, before continuing the journey on foot to Jarvis's home.

They left the next morning with all of Harry's belongings. As they walked along a footpath, Jarvis shared stories of hunting in the mountains.

"""Goodbye, Harry,"" Jarvis repeated as Harry rode away, following the trail towards the Wilderness Road. He felt a lump in his throat, realizing the kindness of the mountaineers. The old woman's prophecy echoed in his mind, but he shook off the thought of the future. As he looked back, he saw Jarvis, Ike, Mrs. Simmons, and Aunt Suse waving from the porch. A sense of thrill washed over him, pondering the old woman's words. Riding along the mountain base, he left the valley behind, not to see it again. Two uneventful days later, he reached the old Wilderness Road, continuing his journey into Virginia. Approaching Richmond, the intensity of the war's fervor became palpable. The names of generals and places started to hold significance for Harry, as he prepared to reunite with familiar faces in a city rich with history and Southern pride."|"['1.

Harry arrived in Richmond around noon, carrying only his saddlebags and weapons. After a quick meal, he sought out General Beauregard, who was said to be at the White House, the residence of President Davis. Richmond, bustling with life, teemed with officers, soldiers, civilians, and elegantly dressed girls. Harry paused to admire the state house and the Bell Tower before meeting General Beauregard. The general welcomed Harry warmly and accepted his request to join Colonel Talbot's command. Harry was appointed as a second lieutenant and instructed to be ready to leave on a train in four hours. The train, filled with officers, troops, and ammunition, headed towards Manassas Junction where Beauregard was stationed. Despite feeling a bit lonely, Harry fell asleep on the journey, waking up to the sight of green hills and muddy roads upon his arrival the next day.|['1.

They departed from the train and walked across the hills next to one of the muddy paths. Soon, they spotted a large collection of tents, fires, and earthworks that extended as far as the eye could see. Harry's heart filled with excitement once more. This was the grand army of the South. Countless regiments and soldiers filled the area, and among them awaited his friends, Colonel Talbot, Major St. Hilaire, St. Clair, and Langdon. The entire sight was incredibly inspiring for a young heart. In the distance, cavalry dashed back and forth on the right, while infantry practiced drills on the left. The sound of a regimental band playing a familiar tune echoed through the air. Harry then presented his order to a guard, who directed him to Colonel Talbot's regiment, known as 'The Invincibles.' As he approached the campsite, he was warmly welcomed by his friends Langdon and St. Clair.|"['1.

Colonel Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire were deep in thought, studying a map of a historic region. Harry, the new lieutenant on their staff, received a warm welcome. Colonel Talbot informed Harry that he would be getting a new uniform from the quartermaster. After a brief conversation, Harry was taken to a swimming hole by his friends Langdon and St. Clair.

Although they were prepared for war, St. Clair mentioned that the sentinels often exchanged tobacco and news, despite the officers' attempts to stop it. The two young men, leaving their troops under Sergeant Carrick's command, approached the distant fire. As they crossed the brook and advanced through the field of young corn, they paused in a grove, observing their army's campfires in the distance. Climbing a fence, they ventured closer, seeing figures against the flames at the Northern camp. The soldiers there wore peculiar red attire resembling Turkish women's garments.

"Three to four hundred voices enthusiastically sang the famous battle song, ""Dixie,"" a tune destined to become the South's great anthem. Harry, surprised to hear Northern troops sing it, learned it was originally written for a minstrel show in New York. As the song echoed, the atmosphere grew tense as cavalry approached. Harry and his comrade hid in the bushes, hearts pounding as the horsemen passed by. When the rear files veered towards them, the boys fled towards a nearby cornfield.

Harry and St. Clair greeted Colonel Talbot and left. They sensed he wasn't open to questions. Since reuniting in Virginia, Harry noticed a change in the South Carolina colonel. While his kindness remained, a new seriousness emerged. The friend was evolving into the commander. Seeking rest in a tent, they were interrupted by Langdon, eager to join their next adventure.

They continued marching without stopping, except for brief rests, until around three o'clock in the morning. They reached the top of a steep hill covered in thick forest but lacking any low-growing plants. The officers dismounted, informing the soldiers they would stay put until daybreak. Colonel Talbot outlined their mission: a strong Northern force threatened the left flank of their main army from a nearby slope fortified with cannons. The plan was to surprise the enemy soldiers before dawn while they were still at their weakest. The troops were instructed to lie down in darkness, no lights allowed, and eat cold rations from their packs.

The young soldiers were abruptly awakened and commanded to silence. Despite the order, they whispered excitedly about their plans to defeat the Yankees. They boasted about their strength, ready to face the Northern workers. Before marching, they were instructed to quickly eat from their knapsacks, allowing no time for loud talking. Some soldiers, accustomed to having servants, were angered by the officers' orders. However, their anger was suppressed by the bugle's distant call. The troops prepared to move out, leaving their horses behind and forming columns with light guns. Scouts returned with news of the unsuspecting garrison at the Northern fort.

As they neared the valley's grassy opening and turned north, Harry spotted two men in blue uniforms with rifles. The men fired at the advancing gray-clad Invincibles before retreating towards their own troops. The soldiers, feeling victory close, rushed forward, causing concern among the officers. The forest ended, revealing a slope with trenches and cannon. The sun's bright light illuminated the scene. The soldiers charged, facing gunfire and falling comrades. Despite the chaos, Colonel Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire led the Invincibles into the fort, where they fought fiercely. The young soldiers, new to battle, experienced the harsh reality of war with wounds and death. The Invincibles, driven by rage, overcame the defenders and entered the fort, faces reflecting the shock of war's brutality.|"[""1.

As the Invincibles charged, the defenders retreated from the fort, taking two cannons with them. Upon reaching the woods, they fired back at the Southern troops, causing them to hesitate. The Invincibles, fueled by victory, attempted a counterattack but were met with a deadly response, forcing them to seek cover behind the earthworks they had captured. Amidst the chaos, Langdon joked about a near miss, while St. Clair remained composed despite the danger. The officers quickly directed the men, including young recruits, to fortify their position along the earthworks. Despite casualties, the Invincibles managed to repel the Northern troops, who resorted to firing shells from a distance.

At noon, a plentiful meal was served in the fort. Barrels of water were discovered, and the men eagerly drank, feeling thirsty from their work. The three boys, despite their status, had been working alongside the men and now leaned tiredly against the earthwork. The noise of tools had stopped. In a solemn silence, the men ate and drank, while no sounds came from the Northern troops in the woods. A heavy silence lingered over the valley, charged with the memory of battles. Harry felt a sense of calm, his gaze shifting to the fresh earth covering the fallen soldiers, sending a shiver down his spine. The wounded soldiers, though in pain, remained patient, tended to by the surgeons and their comrades.

Three scouts, dispatched by Colonel Talbot, returned with information that confirmed his suspicions. A sizable force, likely from Patterson's army in the hills, was advancing down the valley to link up with those ousted from the fort. The convergence was imminent, within an hour. Harry, present during the report, grasped its gravity. He was relieved that the earth walls had been heightened and the trenches deepened. In the afternoon's midst, as shadows crept over the eastern woods, a rustle caught their attention. Bushes swayed, and officers glimpsed movement in the undergrowth. Suddenly, a thunderous crash echoed as shells from a battery soared and exploded nearby. Luckily, the Invincibles' deep trenches shielded them, even as two shells breached the fort. Colonel Talbot, with Harry as his aide, ordered the gunners to hold fire until the enemy charged, conserving ammunition. Amid the cannonade, the fort endured a crossfire, but the well-constructed trenches minimized casualties. Harry, by the Colonel's side, observed his intense scrutiny of the woods through binoculars, noting a rare smile. Colonel Talbot speculated that the skilled artillery officer behind the attack was likely Carrington, renowned for his precision and tactics.|"['1.

The young soldiers stayed close to Colonel Talbot, ready to deliver important messages within the fort. St. Clair and Langdon were also nearby, prepared for the same task, huddled in a trench. Langdon, feeling anxious from the chaos of flying shells and cannonballs, whispered impatiently about the impending battle. Despite the tension, he remarked on Langdon's neat appearance, even in the face of danger. Suddenly, the cannon fire stopped, signaling the imminent charge of the enemy. As the bugle sounded and the enemy forces approached, the Southern troops readied themselves at the earthworks. The battle began with a fierce exchange of gunfire, the fort turning into a blazing battleground. Despite the relentless assault, the Northern troops continued their advance, facing the defenders' fierce resistance.|"['1.

The fort's defenses were robust, repelling the attackers' bold charge. Bullets rained down from the defenders on high platforms, causing the assailants to retreat. Amidst the chaos, the bugle signaled a retreat instead of an advance. The field was shrouded in smoke, concealing the Northern troops' withdrawal. Harry, eager but warned by Colonel Talbot, refrained from exposing himself to enemy fire. Despite the enemy's cannon fire, the defenders remained safe behind their fortifications. When a familiar figure from the enemy side appeared, Harry aimed his rifle, but Colonel Talbot intervened, revealing a longstanding friendship. As the enemy cannons resumed their assault, the defenders hunkered down, realizing the toll the battle had taken on them.|"[""1.

"When it was clear that no attack would come from the fort, the cannon fire stopped, revealing a field covered in fallen soldiers. Harry was too horrified to look again, but Colonel Talbot surveyed the area through his binoculars. ""They're still out there, and they won't leave,"" he declared. ""We've repelled the assault, but we're still under siege. Carrington will keep bombarding us."" Just then, a shell exploded inside the fort, unsettling everyone. Despite the constant threat, Harry, St. Clair, and Langdon tried to regain their composure. As evening approached, the senior officers held a meeting and summoned the three youths. Colonel Talbot explained the dire situation and assigned them a crucial mission: to sneak through enemy lines and seek reinforcements from General Beauregard's army.

Colonel Talbot advised against carrying a rifle or sword for speed, suggesting two pistols instead. He sent Harry, son of his old friend George Kenton, on a perilous mission. Amid a burst of a shell, Harry prepared to flee, wary of Northern sharpshooters. Running across an open space, he feared being picked off but managed to reach the safety of the forest. Resting briefly, Harry cautiously proceeded, evading the besieging force. As he climbed the slope, clouds provided cover. Near the fort, he hid from passing Northern troops discussing recapturing the fort. Moving swiftly, Harry encountered a sentinel at the mountain's crest, mistaken for a fellow soldier in the dark.|"['1.

"The guard, spotting Harry's uniform, shouted, ""A Johnny Reb!"" and fired his rifle in haste. Fortunately, the bullet grazed Harry's skin, spurring him to flee down the slope. Motivated by danger, love of life, loyalty to his cause, and determination to complete his mission, Harry ran with incredible speed. Despite more shots being fired, none hit him. After running several miles, he rested under a tree before continuing. Harry easily found the path the Invincibles had taken, marked by cannon tracks. He decided to retrace his steps to reach the camp at Manassas. With brief breaks, Harry ran through the night, fueled by Colonel Talbot's provisions.

To the tired and worried boy, it felt like a noble order, with vibrant horses and men exuding vitality and vigor. His gaze fixated on a figure slightly ahead of the rest, resembling a knight from old tales. The young man, tall and robust, rode a massive black horse. His long, thick golden-brown hair and beard shone in the morning sun. Adorned in a coat with brass buttons, trousers with gold braid, and a yellow silk sash, he wore gold-spurred boots and gloves. A felt hat with a golden star and black ostrich plume crowned his head. Harry marveled at this remarkable figure, reminiscent of knights from French lore.

Harry felt a surge of energy as he rode alongside Stuart, a brilliant and thorough leader. Deep in the hills, they encountered St. Clair, exhausted but dignified. Stuart's command, with its splendid men and horses, advanced cautiously through the forest. They dismounted to signal Colonel Talbot, then attacked on foot. The Invincibles cheered at the sight of help. Stuart's men, armed with carbines, skirmished until reinforcements arrived, forcing the Northern troops to retreat. St. Clair acknowledged Harry's role in their victory, recognizing the importance of his skill and luck. Langdon, despite being wounded, celebrated their success.

Harry, Langdon, and St. Clair enjoyed the outdoor life. They had learned to care for themselves and avoided common soldier illnesses.

Langdon shared a newspaper with Tom, making light of the mockery they faced. Langdon defended their relaxed approach as wisdom in hot weather. Tom revealed a charm he learned to protect against harm in battle, urging his friends to join. Their conversation was interrupted by an orderly calling Harry to Colonel Talbot's tent.

As Harry rode away, the memory of the firm handshake of his comrades still excited him. He passed through the Southern lines and headed northwest to reach the rear of the Northern forces. Dressed in a faded gray uniform and unarmed, he sought secrecy even from bystanders, veering into the forest. Harry, young and aware of the importance of his mission, was to use his judgment to uncover the activities between the Northern army and Washington. Riding through the thick forest, he pondered his encounter with Federal scouts, relying on his sturdy horse and weapons. The quiet woods, sheltered from the scorching June sun, brought a sense of tranquility. Harry stumbled upon a babbling brook, where he and his horse quenched their thirst before following its course downhill. Peering over the valley, he beheld a breathtaking view of green hills dotted with armies, offering a distant yet captivating glimpse of the grim reality of war.|"[""1.

He turned and rode through the forest until he reached its end, a few miles ahead, where the brook flowed into Bull Run. Reluctantly leaving his chatty companion, the brook, he faced two open miles leading to another forest. Choosing to wait there till night, only fifteen miles from Washington, he rode past a farmer ploughing, absorbed in his task. Passing by, the image of the old man ploughing amidst two armies stuck with him. Riding on, Harry noticed four blue-uniformed horsemen in the distance. Keeping low to avoid detection, he rode cautiously, relieved by his inconspicuous gray uniform. As an officer on the hill observed through binoculars, Harry's nerves were tested, but he maintained composure, riding steadily towards the protective forest, wary of any potential pursuit.|"['1.

The forest was close, just a few hundred yards away. To his left, he spotted horsemen in blue uniforms on a slope. Despite the urge to gallop, he resisted, guided by pride. As he neared the dark woods, he heard a horseman shout, but he didn't look back. Riding into the forest, shadows enveloped him. Pausing to wipe his brow, a tremor passed, and he veered into the densest part. Harry felt relief, hoping not to be followed, passing off as a local. Riding boldly, he ventured deeper into the vast, desolate forest. Night fell, clouds parting to reveal a moonlit sky. Spotting the Capitol's dome in the distance, he felt a surge of emotion, despite no longer being on its side.|"['1.

As he rode slowly, he spotted bayonets of a regiment heading to join the Northern army, hinting at a potential attack. Rain disrupted his journey, soaking him and obscuring his path. Lost in the forest, he stumbled upon a cabin in the early hours, seeking shelter. Knocking on the door, a voice from inside inquired about his presence.

Harry found himself facing an old-fashioned rifle held by a tall, bearded man in a hut. The man, a charcoal burner, insisted he was neutral in the war. After a kind gesture of drying Harry's wet clothes and warming him by the fire, he offered Harry a change of clothes to disguise him as a Union soldier since they were deep within Union territory.

"Harry rode confidently ahead, hoping the horse issue would resolve itself. Suddenly, men in blue uniforms approached, commanding him to stop. Harry complied immediately.

As he stepped outside, a man's scornful words about the upcoming Fourth of July session of Congress, called by President Lincoln to discuss the rebellion, lingered in the air.

"He passed through two bushes, circled back to the open. But he returned with a pistol ready to fire, his finger on the trigger. Shepard, following closely, almost walked into the gun, and Harry chuckled softly. ""Yes, maybe. But I could have raised the alarm while you were still in the city. I honestly don't know what I intended. But now the tables have turned. You have me at gunpoint, and I confess,"" said Harry. ""Mr. Shepard,"" Harry continued, ""what you said in Montgomery was true.

He had no duties to perform, so he sat with his back against a tree and waited. Far in the distance, he noticed lights signaling, about three or four miles away. Although curious, he couldn't decipher their meaning. At one point, he thought he heard a trumpet call but remained unsure. The moon and stars illuminated the woods and fields, but any movement across Bull Run remained hidden from his view. The peaceful night air calmed his senses, leading to a deep state of relaxation. Time passed easily as he rested motionless against the tree, enjoying the warm breeze on his face. As dawn approached, a sudden burst of artillery fire erupted, signaling the start of a fierce battle. The Invincibles swiftly rose to action, responding to the enemy's attack with determination.

As they caught their breath and cleared the smoke from their throats, a rumor spread among the troops. The attack at the bridge was just a distraction. Most of the enemy army had already crossed the river and outmaneuvered Beauregard. The Yankees were now in full force on the Southern side of Bull Run, setting the stage for a decisive battle. The Invincibles felt a surge of excitement as they realized the gravity of the situation. Orders for retreat were sounded, and despite their frustration, the young soldiers followed their officers without question. The troops were quickly positioned on a hill just in time to face Burnside's advancing Northern army.
