The young hero, aged thirteen, led a busy life. He played in an orchestra, gave lessons, performed on the organ in church, studied the violin, and composed music diligently. He always carried a notebook to jot down his musical ideas. In today's world, most children have more opportunities than the renowned Beethoven did in his youth. Beethoven practiced on a simple organ in Bonn's Minorite Church, a stark contrast to modern organs. Encouraged by Neefe's comparison to Mozart, Beethoven left for Vienna at sixteen, where he received lessons from Mozart himself. Despite finding happiness in Vienna, news of his ill mother called him back to Bonn. After her passing, he returned to Vienna, where he met Joseph Haydn, who advised him to stay and offered composition lessons. Beethoven, known for his talent, honesty, and warm-hearted nature, was welcomed everywhere in Vienna. His character was as noble as his music, always striving for perfection.|"['1.
