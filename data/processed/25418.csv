In London town, the bells tell tales of oranges and lemons, debts owed, and future dreams. Little Tommy Lin put Pussy in the well, but Little Tommy Stout pulled her out. The jolly fat frog and the comely black crow have a playful exchange by the river. The crow invites the frog to dance in yellow, but the cautious frog declines, fearing a bite. As the fish warns the frog, the frog assures the fish of his care. Eventually, the frog swims to shore, where the crow welcomes him with open arms. This whimsical tale of friendship and caution unfolds with each playful interaction between the animals by the river.|"['1.

"Once upon a time, a jolly miller lived by the river Dee. He sang cheerfully all day long, spreading joy with his tunes. His favorite song went like this, ""I care for nobody, no, not I, and nobody cares for me."" Meanwhile, the king was busy counting his money, the queen enjoyed bread and honey, and the maid hung clothes in the garden. Suddenly, a blackbird swooped down and pecked the maid's nose! In another tale, Tom, the piper's son, only knew one tune, ""Over the hills and far away."" And in a merry moment, Robin Redbreast courted Jenny Wren with promises of cherry pie and currant wine.
