Holland, a unique country, is mostly flat and lies below sea level. Massive dikes, disguised by houses, trees, and windmills, protect the land from being flooded. These dikes have roads on top, with canals and trees alongside. The water on one side is separated from the lush green fields on the other. To prevent flooding, pumps powered by windmills lift water from the low lands and drain it away. Windmills are preferred over steam engines due to their cost-effectiveness and self-sufficiency. While windmills are reliant on the wind's consistency, they are adequate for Holland's needs, as the occasional calm doesn't pose a significant threat. The windmills efficiently pump excess water back into the sea when the wind picks up again.|"['1.

Making canals in Holland is remarkably easy due to the flat landscape, providing a significant advantage. Unlike other countries facing challenges in filling canals with water, Holland's low elevation allows for simple canal construction. The ease of canal creation has led to an extensive canal network throughout Holland, resembling road systems in other nations. Canals serve as vital transportation routes, with much of the country's traffic and travel occurring on them. Farmers even use canals for transporting goods like hay and grain. The flat terrain also enables excellent skating on the canals, a favorite pastime for many. Rollo, feeling grown-up after his travels, eagerly anticipates observing canal traffic and enjoying the skating.|['1.

Rollo discussed the pros and cons of traveling to Holland in the summer versus the winter with his uncle, Mr. George. While winter offered the spectacle of ice skating, Mr. George preferred the summer for a more comprehensive view of the country's canals and windmills. Concerned about the language barrier, Mr. George worried about limited communication during the trip. He suggested that a larger group or a deaf and dumb companion might make the journey more enjoyable. Rollo proposed joining the Parkmans, a young and friendly couple, on their trip to Holland. Despite Mr. George's reservations about Mrs. Parkman, Rollo thought she would make a pleasant travel companion. The group contemplated the dynamics of traveling together and the importance of good company for an extended trip.|"['1.

Mr. George was not fond of Mr. Parkman's young wife, not due to her lack of beauty or kindness, but because she often interfered in travel plans. When traveling, it is important for a gentleman to consider a lady's wishes but take charge of the practical arrangements. Constantly suggesting changes or expressing dissatisfaction is improper. Similarly, in matters of housekeeping, the lady should oversee details while conforming to the general plans set by her husband. Confusion arises when multiple people try to give directions simultaneously. Unity of command is crucial in social life. Mrs. Parkman's inability to understand this led to disagreements during a walk in London. Despite Mr. Parkman's willingness to let her choose, Mrs. Parkman's decision-making caused unnecessary complications.|"[""1.

Mr. George quickly realized that the change in plans left him as an extra person for the Hansom cab ride, which only comfortably fits two. He decided to stick to the original idea of taking a water route. Meanwhile, Mr. Parkman carefully chose a cab with a good horse for their long journey, knowing his wife preferred a fast ride. After selecting the best horse, he signaled the driver to pick them up. Mrs. Parkman inspected each cab but found none better than the first. Ultimately, they returned to the initial choice only to discover it had been taken. Despite Mr. George's reluctance to travel with Mrs. Parkman, fate seemed to bring them together during their journey to Holland. They ended up meeting unexpectedly at the Dover station, where they all found themselves traveling towards the same destination.|"['1.

Around eleven o'clock in the morning, a conversation took place. Mr. Parkman's porter, who was watching over his trunks, suggested taking a different boat due to the rough waters expected later in the day. The porter recommended a beautiful hotel in Dover, known for its stunning views of the sea and France's coast. The hotel's coffee room overlooked the water and was elegantly decorated. Mrs. Parkman admired the view of the French coast and the chalk cliffs from the windows. As they awaited breakfast, Rollo explained the difference between tidal and mail steamers, mentioning the challenges of landing during low tide. The group enjoyed the magnificent scenery and observed the guests arriving in the room.|"[""1.

The California harbor is quite unique. When the tide is low, ships must anchor offshore until it rises again. Passengers then descend from the ship into small boats to reach the shore. This can be challenging in rough weather. After breakfast, Mr. George and Rollo explored the town before heading to the pier. They watched their luggage being loaded onto the boat and then boarded themselves. The steamer was small with only a few passengers. As they set off, the sea became rough, causing discomfort for some passengers. Mrs. Parkman fell ill and sought comfort from her husband. Meanwhile, Rollo and Mr. George eagerly awaited the approaching French coast, looking out for the boats that would greet them upon arrival.|['1.

The ship was nearing its anchoring spot, and the sailors were preparing to dock. As the ship turned parallel to the shore, Mr. George and Rollo's view of the pier was obstructed by the moving vessel. Passing by the cabin where the ladies were seated, a gentleman informed them of the change in docking plans. The ship was now directing passengers to smaller boats due to the unexpected landing situation. Amidst the confusion, Mr. George and Rollo were directed to board one of the boats. The process was challenging as the ship and boat swayed in the rough waters. With seamen assisting, passengers were guided down steps onto the boat. Despite the chaos, Mr. George managed to embark safely. As more passengers boarded other boats, Rollo overheard Mrs. Parkman's distress, adding to the tension of the situation.|"[""1.

Mrs. Parkman firmly stated she would wait until the steamer docked, even if it meant waiting until midnight. She expressed frustration at the mismanagement and lack of consideration for the tides. Mr. Parkman explained that while most passengers take boats that align with the tides, the mail service must maintain regular schedules, causing some inconvenience for passengers. Rollo overheard this exchange amidst the noisy surroundings. The scene was chaotic as passengers were hurried onto a small boat to reach the shore. Rollo found himself among the bewildering confusion and was quickly ushered onto the boat. As they rowed towards the shore, Rollo observed the dark, stormy waters and the distant piers illuminated by a lighthouse. The boat's course seemed to veer parallel to the coast, causing uncertainty among the passengers. The gentleman assured them to wait for the tide to rise before proceeding.|"[""1.

The sky grew darker, and rain started falling. The group huddled under umbrellas in a boat, trying to stay dry. Rollo, not bothered by the rain, preferred to watch the boat maneuver. As they neared the roaring waves, the boat hit the bottom, then rose and fell with the waves. The pilot realized they couldn't cross the shallow bar and ordered the sailors to pull back out to sea. The ladies remained calm as the boat thumped on the bar, surrounded by roaring waves. Once clear, Rollo reported seeing other boats anchored ahead. Their boat also anchored, swaying in the rough sea. After an hour, they raised the anchor to try crossing again, with Rollo keeping watch for any movement.|"[""Question 1: What was Rollo's reaction to the rain while on the boat?\nA) He huddled with the group under umbrellas\nB) He panicked and started shouting\nC) He preferred to watch the boat maneuver\nD) He complained loudly about the rain\nE) He immediately sought shelter from the rain"", ""Question 2: Why did the pilot order the sailors to pull back out to sea?\nA) To avoid the rain\nB) To get a better view of the waves\nC) To find a better spot for anchoring\nD) Because they couldn't cross the shallow bar\nE) To take a break from sailing"", 'Question 3: How did the ladies react when the boat thumped on the bar surrounded by roaring waves?\nA) They panicked and screamed\nB) They remained calm\nC) They started singing in unison\nD) They jumped into the water\nE) They demanded to be taken back to shore', 'Question 4: What did Rollo report seeing ahead while on the boat?\nA) An island\nB) Other boats anchored\nC) A lighthouse\nD) A storm approaching\nE) Dolphins swimming nearby', 'Question 5: Why did the boat anchor in the rough sea after encountering the roaring waves?\nA) To take a break\nB) To watch the sunset\nC) To avoid the rain\nD) To wait for the waves to calm down\nE) To go fishing', 'Question 6: Who kept watch for any movement when they raised the anchor to try crossing again?\nA) The pilot\nB) The ladies\nC) The sailors\nD) Rollo\nE) The group huddled under umbrellas']"|"['C) He preferred to watch the boat maneuver', ""D) Because they couldn't cross the shallow bar"", 'B) They remained calm', 'B) Other boats anchored', 'D) To wait for the waves to calm down', 'D) Rollo']"
In a short while, the boat crossed the surf, bouncing with the waves. Gradually, it moved over the bar, reaching deep waters on the other side. The rain had stopped, and the passengers were relieved to see the pier's entrance. With calm waters, the boat smoothly glided between the towering walls of the piers. Upon reaching the landing stairs, everyone disembarked safely. Rollo and Mr. George continued their journey into Holland by train. Rollo learned that crossing European borders didn't always have visible signs. Custom house stations were the only indicators of frontier changes, where passports were checked. At the Belgian custom house, Rollo saw soldiers and signs in French. Mr. George warned Rollo not to argue with customs officers. Inside the station, officers inspected baggage, including Rollo's musical box. Despite concerns, they proceeded into Holland without any issues.|"['1.

Mr. George and Rollo followed the company into a small room where an officer stamped their passports. Rollo sat by the window on the train, admiring the beautiful scenery of Holland. Mr. George explained about dikes and embankments built to keep the roads dry. The country was flat with rows of trees and farmhouses. The network of creeks and rivers allowed ships to navigate easily. At Moerdyk, all passengers disembarked to board a steamer. Rollo and Mr. George hurried to get good seats on the boat. Rollo sat near a small porch on the deck, while most passengers went below. A young man with a spyglass and a lady passed by as Rollo settled in for the journey.|['1.

Rollo decided to explore the cabin below deck on the steamer and found a cozy space with small tables where passengers were preparing for breakfast. He and Mr. George planned to enjoy a nice dinner in Rotterdam later. As the steamer sailed along the river, Rollo admired the Dutch-style vessels with movable fins and the picturesque scenes along the shore. They passed by houses on the dike, each with steps leading down to the water and little piers with boats. The dike was adorned with rows of trees and windmills that pumped water, sawed logs, or ground grain. Approaching a town called Dort, they marveled at the bustling harbor filled with masts, spires, and rooftops, including a grand cathedral tower in the center.|['1.

As the steamer swiftly traveled along the water's edge, Mr. George and Rollo peered at the town, noticing canals instead of streets. The town appeared almost level with the water, with ships' masts and houses' roofs blending in the distance. Docking at a pier, passengers disembarked. Mr. George and Rollo marveled at the unique buildings along the quay. Before they could step ashore, the steamer resumed its journey. Approaching Rotterdam, they observed numerous boats, windmills, and steamers. The windmills, towering like lighthouses, reached impressive heights to catch the wind. After disembarking and showing their passports, they were driven to a grand hotel by the quay. The hotel staff spoke English, accommodating their request for a large room with a view of the bustling quay. Later, they were offered a tour guide to explore the town.|"[""1.

They walked through the town and were amazed by the streets filled with docks, basins, and canals. Almost every street had a canal on one side and a road on the other, giving the choice of boat or carriage. Merchants' houses lined the waterways, with upper floors for living and lower floors for storage. Some streets had canals in the center, while others had them on one side, with goods hoisted by cranes from vessels. Rollo criticized the lack of curbs and gutters, but his uncle explained the practicality of the design for easy transport of goods. The lesson learned was not to judge unfamiliar practices too quickly.

"Mr. George and Rollo were fascinated by the tobacco inspection process they witnessed. The coopers swiftly dismantled the hogsheads, revealing the tobacco inside. The inspectors meticulously examined and weighed the tobacco, taking samples for further inspection. The layers were then reassembled, and the hogsheads were sealed securely for transport. The efficiency and precision of the operation impressed both Mr. George and Rollo. As they strolled through the streets, they observed various valuable merchandise being loaded onto massive ships bound for the East Indies. Rollo found amusement in deciphering the shop signs, translating words like ""victualling,"" ""tobacco,"" and ""blacksmith."" The wooden shoes worn by the locals also caught Rollo's attention, with even children clattering around in them."|"['1.

In many places where streets crossed, there were bridges over canals. These bridges were drawbridges, raised for boats to pass. The machinery to lift the bridges was interesting. Rollo and Mr. George saw this maneuver when a vessel passed. Each boat paid a toll. The tollman swung out a wooden shoe for the money. Some bridges had a narrow part in the center to let ship masts through. In busy ship areas, ferries were used. Rollo found crossing by ferry like crossing a water street. The view was attractive with large houses, trees, and clean sidewalks. Mr. George and Rollo explored Rotterdam, enjoying the interesting sights. They walked along a canal with boats, clean roads, and houses with gardens. A small canal drained water to a windmill.|['1.

As Rollo and Mr. George strolled along a road, they noticed the water on one side was much higher than the land on the other. Between houses, they glimpsed level fields below intersected by small canals, serving as fences, roads, and drains. Land divisions were marked by these canals, and there were no other roads for transporting produce. During their walk, they encountered interesting objects. They saw a ferry boat resembling a floating room, shuttling passengers across a canal with a rope and pulleys. At a bridge, they watched it pivot to let a boat pass. They marveled at an enormous windmill pumping water. They also explored a dike road lined with ancient trees, leading to lavish summer homes of wealthy merchants.|['1.

Mr. George and Rollo strolled along the dike, gazing at the scenes below. They passed by grand trees shading the smooth sidewalk. Mr. George remarked that The Hague was where the king, princes, and ambassadors lived. He felt they would see more in Paris or London than just palaces and galleries. Rollo led them to a bridge with boatmen offering rides in Dutch. Rollo, unable to speak Dutch, pointed towards the station to indicate their destination. They boarded a boat, and Rollo guided the boatman with gestures. They navigated through canals and under bridges, finally reaching a stop near the station. Rollo paid the fare cautiously. Mr. George settled in the first-class waiting room while Rollo explored the station. To his surprise, Mr. George encountered Mr. and Mrs. Parkman. Despite Mrs. Parkman's criticism of the town, they exchanged greetings.|"['1.

Mrs. Parkman mentioned her excitement about visiting the Hague, where the king and important people reside along with foreign ambassadors. She regretted that William didn't ask for letters of introduction to them. Mr. George hesitated to make a decision without consulting Rollo. After finding Rollo by a canal, they discussed joining Mrs. Parkman's party to see the Hague. They planned to travel by canal boat to Delft and return on foot. As the train arrived, Mr. George discreetly bribed a railroad officer for assistance. Mrs. Parkman's mood improved during the journey, though she found the flat landscape uninteresting. However, Mr. George and Rollo found the scenery fascinating, with green fields, canals, boats, and ancient trees lining the roads, making the trip enjoyable and engaging.|"['1.

Mr. Parkman handed Mr. George the ticket, and he left to prepare the carriage. Rollo stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Parkman. Shortly after, Mr. George returned, announcing the carriage was ready. They all headed to the door and found a waiting carriage with their luggage on top. A man held the door open for them to board. After boarding, Mr. George tipped the man and they set off. The road ran alongside a canal before crossing a bridge into the town. The night was setting in, and it was becoming cold. As they rode through the town, Mrs. Parkman requested the windows closed. They passed through a street lined with grand houses and gardens until they arrived at a magnificent hotel. Mr. George led them to a lavishly decorated parlor with large windows overlooking a beautiful garden. Candles were lit, and a waiter prepared a sumptuous breakfast for the next morning.|['1.

Mr. George planned a day of sightseeing for Mrs. Parkman in The Hague. They consulted with a commissioner to list all the places worth visiting, including museums, palaces, churches, and parks. After calculating the time needed for each stop, they realized they could see everything before catching their train to Amsterdam. The carriage was ready, and they set out to explore the museums, palaces, and gardens. However, Mrs. Parkman's curiosity led her to a closed door in a museum where she expected something exclusive. To her surprise, it only led to a storage room. Despite this, they continued their journey, even visiting a seaside watering place with a vast hotel and beach.

After gazing at the view for a while and observing some bathing carriages heading into the water for ladies to swim, the group went back to the carriage. They rode through a quaint fishing village with boats lined up near homes. Rollo was eager to see the boats and learn about the fish they caught, but Mrs. Parkman preferred to continue. On the return to The Hague, they passed through a wooded area with Dutch women. Approaching the town, they saw parks, palaces, and grand houses. Mrs. Parkman wanted to know the residents, but the coachman's Dutch responses were hard to grasp. Back at the hotel, the baggage was loaded, and the group headed to the station.

Rollo sat by the window with two foot stoves to keep warm. He had small boxes with holes for the fire. Rollo used two sheets of note paper to write a letter. He watched boats on the canal in between writing. He made sure to write neatly throughout. Holland is a low country protected by dikes. The River Rhine poses a flood risk. The land has canals and polders. Polders are drained by windmills. Windmills in Holland are huge and old. They help pump water out of the polders. The canals also serve as roads for transportation. The sight of the windmills spinning high above is impressive.|['1. What did Rollo use to keep warm while writing his letter?\nA) Blankets\nB) Foot stoves\nC) Candles\nD) Radiator\nE) Fireplace', '2.

In Holland, windmills were used to pump water from one drain or canal to another, helping to prevent flooding. The River Amstel, near Amsterdam, posed challenges due to its low mouth, making it hard to drain water into the sea. To manage this, immense sluices were used. If water couldn't be drained fast enough, it could accumulate, leading to potential breaches in dikes and flooding of polders. In the past, when land became submerged, people had to decide whether to abandon it or pump the water out, knowing it would take years to make the land fertile again. Windmills were crucial in draining water, preventing further inundation. Eventually, steam engines and powerful pumps replaced windmills to drain vast areas like the Holland Lake, which was transformed into pastures and fields.|['1.

Holland has always faced significant flooding from the lakes and rivers in the country. The ice freshets from rivers like the Rhine pose a particular threat. As the ice breaks up in the river's middle before thawing in Holland, it can lead to dangerous ice jams. These jams cause water levels to rise rapidly, sometimes by seven feet in an hour. The pressure from the ice can burst the dikes along the riverbank, leading to devastating floods. In ancient times, these floods were even more catastrophic, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives. Despite improved dikes and precautions, the risk of flooding remains. Holland's unique canal system offers excellent skating opportunities in the winter due to the smooth and still waters. The Dutch language barrier can be challenging, with communication often relying on gestures rather than words.|"['1.

In the city, we once tried to have a fire. When a woman entered, I pretended to be cold, went to the fireplace, and gestured for her to bring firewood. She spoke Dutch, so the landlady explained we could only use foot stoves. Watching boats on canals is fascinating. Some boats double as homes, with families and pets aboard. Children play on deck, even teaching dogs to write. Dogs also pull carts, sometimes needing direction. I saw a boy struggle to guide his dog-drawn cart. Most goods are transported by boat, including livestock. Farmers bring cows, sheep, and pigs to market in boat pens. People propel boats with long poles, pushing from bow to stern. The canal traffic is a unique sight, showcasing the diverse uses of boats in the city.|['1.

In the countryside of Holland, where there are no railways, people often travel by boat along the canals. I recently observed a man and a woman pulling a double boat filled with hay. The hay was loaded between the two boats, weighing as much as five or six large cartloads. They used long cords and straps over their shoulders to pull the heavy load along the canal. The woman's line was attached to one boat, and the man's to the other. These boats are used for transportation since the canals are a common mode of travel in this region. I once took a canal boat journey with my uncle George to a town called Delft. The journey was pleasant, passing by beautiful green banks with gardens and summer houses. The Dutch countryside is ideal for raising cattle due to the lush grass that grows abundantly. Cattle are raised for beef and milk, which is used to make the famous Dutch cheeses known worldwide.|"['Question 1:\nWhat is a common mode of travel in the countryside of Holland?\nA) Railways\nB) Bicycles\nC) Boats along the canals\nD) Cars\nE) Airplanes', 'Question 2:\nHow was the double boat filled with hay pulled along the canal?\nA) By horses\nB) By bicycles\nC) By cars\nD) By using long cords and straps over their shoulders\nE) By using a motorboat', ""Question 3:\nWhat is the woman's line attached to while pulling the double boat filled with hay?\nA) A bicycle\nB) A horse\nC) A car\nD) One boat\nE) The man"", 'Question 4:\nWhat is the Dutch countryside ideal for raising?\nA) Chickens\nB) Sheep\nC) Cattle\nD) Goats\nE) Pigs', 'Question 5:\nWhat is the milk from the cattle used for in Holland?\nA) Making bread\nB) Making butter\nC) Making ice cream\nD) Making cheese\nE) Making yogurt', ""Question 6:\nWhat is the author's mode of travel to the town of Delft with Uncle George?\nA) By car\nB) By bicycle\nC) By boat along the canals\nD) By train\nE) By airplane""]"|['C) Boats along the canals', 'D) By using long cords and straps over their shoulders', 'D) One boat', 'C) Cattle', 'D) Making cheese', 'C) By boat along the canals']
In the vicinity of Amsterdam, there are quaint dairy villages famous for their cheese production, attracting many travelers. These villages, like Broek, are known for their exceptional cleanliness, a crucial aspect of dairy farming worldwide. Dutch housewives in these villages have taken cleanliness to an extraordinary level. For instance, Peter the Great of Russia visited Saandam to learn about shipbuilding. The small wooden house he stayed in still stands, preserved by a brick structure.

Mr. George wanted to stop at the post office to mail a letter and pay the postage. James guided them to the office where foreign letters were handled. James helped as an interpreter, a crucial role for a commissioner. After mailing the letter, they continued their walk along a narrow street by a canal. The view of the harbor was stunning, with ships of all shapes and sizes moving about. They walked on a long pier to a landing platform with a tavern and offices for steamers. The place looked like a village on an island, built on piles. People were bustling about, some disembarking from steamers, others boarding. Rollo observed peasant girls with golden ornaments on their foreheads. They then boarded a unique ferry boat with an oval-shaped deck, enjoying the open view and fresh air on the water.|"[""1.

As the city clocks chimed nine, steamboats and the ferry boat began their journeys from the landing piers. The ferry boat moved slowly, offering a splendid view of the town's buildings stretching for miles, with domes, towers, and masts rising above. The harbor bustled with ships passing in the sunlit water. Mr. George and Rollo admired the scene in silence. They planned to take a trekschuyt, a short canal journey to reach a carriage. The canal connecting Amsterdam to the Helder is a remarkable feat, allowing access to the sea through a deep channel. Gates control the water levels, enabling ships to enter during low tide. Mr. George explained the operation of the sea and canal gates, essential for ships to navigate the canal.|['1.

Mr. George explained how the ship was locked in the canal, with the sea gates closed to keep the water level steady. James mentioned that passengers from the ferry boat walk over a dike to reach the canal boats waiting for them. Rollo suggested having the boats pass through the locks to avoid changing vessels, but James explained it's time-consuming unless for large ships. The ferry boat docked at a harbor, and passengers climbed a dike to see the canal below. Two boats were waiting: a long steamer going to Helder and a trekschuyt to a nearby village. Passengers split between the boats. Rollo explored the trekschuyt, resembling a broad boat with a house on it, before checking out the cabins below.|['1.

Mr. George stood quietly on the deck, gazing at the canal winding across the country. The view was soon obscured by dikes. He could spot vessels' masts among trees, indicating the canal's path. Alongside the dike was a high road and a tow path. Boats were drawn by men or horses. A large ship from the West Indies, bound for Amsterdam, was being horse-drawn due to the wind. Passing boats involved skillful maneuvers, except for one mishap. After a scenic journey, Mr. George and Rollo disembarked at a charming village along the dike. They inspected carriages at a stable before walking to a bridge with a splendid view. The village's quaint houses resembled something out of a fairy tale.|['1.

The path through the village was narrow, barely wide for a carriage to pass. On one side, a row of trees lined the canal's grassy banks. Mr. George and Rollo waited on a bridge until their carriage was ready. They hopped in with the top down, allowing views in all directions. James sat next to the driver outside. The carriage rolled through the village with shops displaying goods. Leaving the village, they followed a canal's dike. Windmills dotted the landscape, pumping water. Fields bustled with cattle, sheep, and workers. Windmills spun in the distance, ships sailed along canals. After an hour, they reached the picturesque village by a broad canal. The houses, painted green, had water lanes and charming structures. They stopped at an inn for breakfast. A Dutch girl took their order, adorned with golden ornaments. The group strolled through the village's garden-like paths, offering scenic canal views and quaint bridges.|"[""1.

After walking a short distance, the commissioner led the group to a dairy house. The interior was divided into stalls for cows on one side and rooms for the family on the other. A Dutch woman warmly welcomed them. The stalls were beautifully decorated with glazed tiles and fancy trinkets. The passage was lined with dairy tools like tubs and cheese presses, all shining with brass. The group saw cheeses in the making, resembling large cannonballs. They then explored the rooms of the house filled with antique furniture and Chinese ornaments. Mr. George explained that the town's livelihood had revolved around dairy for generations, emphasizing the importance of neatness in the business. After a hearty breakfast at the inn, they continued their journey along a sea dike, marveling at the immense trees lining the road. Men were busy harvesting hay along the slopes of the dike, loading it onto boats in the nearby canals.|"['1.

After a long journey through the winding roads, Mr. George and Rollo finally reached the town of Saandam. The town is split by a grand canal with a street on each side. The buildings line the streets for miles along the canal, but the town doesn't spread out much due to the low polders on the sides. The commissioner guided them on a stroll through the charming part of the town, walking along the canal and crossing by ferry. They visited Peter the Great's hut where he studied shipbuilding. The hut, covered by a protective brick building, had curious Dutch furnishings and walls covered in visitor names. After exploring, they signed the visitor book and headed back to Amsterdam, enjoying the scenic drive on the sea dike with boats and windmills in view. Mr. George suggested reading about Peter the Great, who sent nobles' sons to study abroad to modernize Russia.|"[""1.

Rollo shared a story about a young man who was sent to Venice but refused to explore the city. Later, Peter decided to travel to civilized countries to learn for his dominion. He took ambassadors and generals but dressed plainly to wander freely. Peter visited seaports and was fascinated by Dutch ships, as the first vessel he saw was Dutch. He discovered the importance of ships in warfare and trade. Upon returning to Moscow, the capital, Peter had Dutch shipbuilders construct vessels for him. This decision marked the beginning of Russia's naval expansion. Peter's interest in ships stemmed from his first sailing experience on a neglected yacht at a royal estate, where he realized the strategic advantages of a strong navy.|"[""1.
