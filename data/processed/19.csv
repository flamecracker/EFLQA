The Song of Hiawatha is a collection of legends from various North American Indian tribes, particularly the Ojibway Indians of northern Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. These stories were gathered by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, a historian, explorer, and geologist. Schoolcraft, who was the superintendent of Indian affairs for Michigan in the 1830s, married Jane Johnston, a woman of mixed heritage. Jane and her mother were instrumental in researching and compiling the material for Schoolcraft's works on Native American folklore. Longfellow, inspired by Schoolcraft's research, wrote The Song of Hiawatha, completing it in 1855. While the poem faced criticism for its similarities to the Finnish epic Kalevala, Longfellow acknowledged Schoolcraft's contributions to the legends and stories that inspired his work.|"['1.

In a magical tale, Osseo's world changed when he heard mystical whispers that transformed the ordinary into the extraordinary. The food before him promised enchantment, turning simple bowls into gleaming shells and kettles into silver. Osseo's family and their partners became vibrant birds, save for Oweenee. Her loyalty was rewarded with renewed youth and beauty. Osseo's father, the Star of Evening, revealed the Evil Spirit's jealousy that caused Osseo's transformation. Despite years of peace, Osseo's son grew up surrounded by the magical birds. Through a brave arrow, the spell was broken, and Osseo and his loved ones descended to a green island.

Hiawatha, a wise and thoughtful man, was determined to protect his cornfields from harm. He instructed his wife, Minnehaha, to perform a magical ritual to safeguard their crops. Minnehaha followed his instructions and, under the cover of darkness, walked around the cornfields, drawing a magic circle with her footsteps. This ritual was meant to keep away pests and ensure a bountiful harvest. The next day, when the ravens and blackbirds descended on the fields, they were ensnared in traps set by Hiawatha. He emerged from his hiding spot and captured the birds, sparing only their leader, Kahgahgee, as a warning to others.

Hiawatha, a wise leader, spoke to the raven, Kahgahgee, who was a troublemaker. He threatened to keep the raven hostage to ensure good behavior. Despite being left sulking, the raven continued to cause chaos. As summer passed, the harvest season arrived. Laughing Water and Nokomis led the community in harvesting maize. During the lively cornfield activities, the elders watched in silence. Laughter filled the air as the community teased each other during the harvest. Hiawatha reflected on how memories and wisdom are often lost with time. He painted symbols to preserve ancestral traditions and meanings for future generations.

In ancient times, Hiawatha, a wise man, taught his people the art of Picture-Writing. He painted on birch-tree bark and reindeer skin, sharing the mysteries of painting. Hiawatha warned his friend Chibiabos about the Evil Spirits but Chibiabos, being young and fearless, went hunting alone. Tragically, the Evil Spirits dragged him into the lake, causing Hiawatha immense grief. The Medicine-men and Prophets built a Sacred Lodge to console Hiawatha. They gave him a magical drink made of healing roots and herbs. Hiawatha slowly accepted the loss of Chibiabos, as they chanted mystic songs to heal him.

The great prophet, Hiawatha, was once healed of his madness through a powerful ritual. His brother, Chibiabos, was summoned from beneath the waters to aid in the healing. Chibiabos obeyed the call but was not allowed to enter the sacred space. Instead, he was given a coal and a fire-brand to become the Ruler of the Land of Spirits. Hiawatha then embarked on a journey to the land of the dead, where he encountered weary spirits burdened with earthly possessions. After his return, Hiawatha traveled far and wide, teaching mortals the art of healing. The tale also touches on the mischief of Pau-Puk-Keewis, who vexed the village with his antics and eventually embarked on new adventures.|"[""1.

From his pouch, the man took out a game set with serious intent. The game had thirteen pieces, some painted white, some vermilion. The pieces included snakes, wedge-men, a war-club, a fish, and more. He placed them in a bowl, shook them, and threw them on the ground, explaining the game. He taught the players the rules, showing different outcomes. They played all night, wagering clothes, weapons, and more. The man, Pau-Puk-Keewis, won many rounds and left with the winnings. As he left, he encountered a raven, which he insulted. He then entered Hiawatha's lodge, causing chaos. Afterward, he whistled through the forest, singing to the animals. He lay by the water, killing birds, until the sea-gull warned of his actions.

Pau-Puk-Keewis, defiant, turned back and made a gesture of derision. Hiawatha, from the mountaintop, vowed to catch him. Pau-Puk-Keewis ran through the forest until he reached a tranquil pond made by beavers. He asked the beavers to transform him into one of them.

In vain, Pau-Puk-Keewis struggled to regain balance, whirling downward, seeing the village and flock above him. Hiawatha chased him, vowing vengeance. Pau-Puk-Keewis transformed into a serpent, then a human, eluding Hiawatha. Seeking refuge, he entered a cavern. Hiawatha, with mighty force, shattered the cavern's door but found it empty.

Once upon a time, in a land of ice and snow, there lived a mighty man named Kwasind. He swayed and tumbled, falling into the river like an otter, leaving his birch canoe behind. The memory of Kwasind lingered among the people, especially during wintry tempests when the trees groaned and split. Just like vultures circling their prey, disasters came one after another, darkening the air with sorrow. Meanwhile, Winter's breath turned lakes and rivers to stone, covering the land in white. Hunters roamed on snowshoes, women worked in the village, and young men played on the ice. As shadows danced in the firelight, two mysterious women entered uninvited, sparking whispers of ghosts haunting the living. Hiawatha returned home with a deer, only to find the strangers devouring his food without asking. Despite their silence, Minnehaha offered kindness to the famished guests. Day by day, the strangers remained silent in the wigwam, only venturing out at night to gather firewood. Hiawatha, Nokomis, and Laughing Water endured the strangers' actions in silence, upholding the virtue of hospitality. When Hiawatha finally questioned the guests' sorrowful demeanor, they revealed themselves as departed souls, warning the living of their grief and the burden they carried.|"['1.

Do not burden the departed with heavy items in their graves, give them only food and fire. The spirit's journey lasts four days, lighting fires four times. Light a fire at the grave four times to guide the soul. Farewell, noble Hiawatha, you have been tested and found great. Keep your strength in the face of challenges. When the guests left, darkness filled the wigwam. Hiawatha saw no ghosts, only winter's harshness. Two silent guests arrived, casting fearful looks at Minnehaha.
