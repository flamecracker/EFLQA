"In a secluded valley of Stiria, surrounded by steep mountains, lay a place of incredible fertility. The valley was fed by a waterfall known as the Golden River, illuminated by the sun's golden rays even in darkness. This valley, called the Treasure Valley, was owned by three brothers: Schwartz, Hans, and Gluck. The elder brothers, Schwartz and Hans, were greedy and cruel. They exploited the valley's riches, mistreated their workers, and hoarded their wealth. Despite their wealth, they were known for their stinginess and lack of compassion.

The youngest brother, Gluck, was very different from his older brothers in appearance and character. He was around twelve years old, fair, blue-eyed, and kind to all living creatures. Gluck often found himself at odds with his brothers, who didn't quite see eye-to-eye with him. He was usually given the task of turning the roast or cleaning shoes and floors.

One wet summer, a series of unfortunate events struck the country, but the Treasure Valley remained unharmed. As winter approached, the elder brothers went out, leaving Gluck to tend to the roast.

Two brothers sat on their bolster, peering into the dark room filled with water. By a misty moonbeam, they saw a foam globe spinning in the water, with a little old gentleman reclining on it luxuriously. Dawn revealed a valley destroyed by an inundation, leaving a wasteland. The brothers found their possessions swept away, except for a card left by the South-West Wind, Esquire. The wind and his relatives withheld rain from the valley, turning it into a desert. The brothers, bankrupt, resorted to becoming goldsmiths but faced challenges due to their behavior and the quality of their work. Eventually, they melted their last piece of gold, a unique mug, to make spoons. Gluck, the youngest brother, was attached to the mug, which had a peculiar design with golden hair forming a handle and a fierce face on the front. As the mug melted, Gluck sadly watched, realizing the consequences of their actions. Sitting by the window, he saw the Golden River flowing from the mountain peak, shimmering like pure gold in the sunset, sparking his curiosity.|"['1.

Once upon a time, a little man claimed to be the King of the Golden River. He revealed a magical secret to a mortal, Gluck.

Hans had to leave his food basket on the glacier, relying on ice to quench his thirst. Resting briefly, his determination pushed him forward. The path ahead was harsh, with no relief from the scorching sun. Thirst and exhaustion weighed on him. As he reached for his water flask, he noticed a dying dog and a child in need of water. Despite their plight, he only took a sip and moved on. The journey grew tougher, the air thick with heat. Hans saw the Golden River's cataract, his destination. Yet, an old man's desperate cry for water halted him. Disregarding the plea, Hans pressed on. The sky darkened ominously as he neared his goal, the sun setting in a fiery blaze.|"['1.

Hans stood at the edge of the chasm, hearing the roar of the Golden River. The waves shimmered with the sunset's red glow, their crests like fiery tongues. As the sound grew louder, Hans tossed his flask into the torrent, feeling a chilling sensation before falling in. Meanwhile, Gluck, worried about Hans, told Schwartz, who believed Hans turned into a black stone. Schwartz, pleased with the idea of having the gold to himself, was freed from prison by Gluck's hard work. Schwartz, thinking he could get the river's gold, obtained holy water from a priest.

Schwartz, driven by his thirst for gold, faced a sudden horror as he approached the Golden River. The sky darkened with bursts of lightning and waves of darkness. The sun set, painting the sky like a lake of blood. When Schwartz cast his flask into the river, lightning struck, the ground crumbled, and he vanished beneath the black waves. Meanwhile, Gluck, worried about his missing brother, decided to seek the Golden River's fortune. Carrying holy water, bread, and a bottle of water, he embarked on the treacherous journey.

Violet called out to her brother, Peony, asking him to bring fresh snow from the untouched part of the garden to shape their snow-sister's bosom. Peony cheerfully complied, bringing the snow to Violet. As they worked on the snow-figure, their mother imagined fairies or angel-children helping them invisibly.

The mother watched as her children, Violet and Peony, played in the garden. They were deeply engrossed in their game with a snow-child they had created.

After unlatching the house-door, she paused, unsure whether to invite the child inside or even speak to her. The lady questioned if the figure was a real child or merely a snowdrift stirred by the cold west-wind. The child's appearance was peculiar, with a face of pure white and rose hues, adorned with golden ringlets. Her all-white attire, unsuitable for winter play, made the mother shiver, especially seeing the thin slippers on her feet. Despite the cold, the child danced lightly over the snow, leaving barely a mark. Violet and Peony struggled to keep up, and when the child held their hands, they felt the chill, prompting them to let go. As the child played with the snow-birds, the family watched in amusement, pondering the mysterious resemblance between the child and the wintry elements.|"[""1.

"""My dear husband,"" his wife said, ""I know no more about the little thing than you do. Some neighbour's child, I suppose.

As she said this, the mother glanced her eyes toward the spot where the children's snow-image had been made.

Once upon a time, in a land of great beauty, there lived a kind Fisherman. He resided in a charming spot by a lake, surrounded by lush greenery and flowers. The Fisherman was a devout man who often journeyed through a dark and mysterious forest to sell fish in a nearby city. One summer evening, as he sat mending his nets, a noble Knight in splendid attire arrived on a majestic horse. The Fisherman welcomed the Knight to his humble abode, where they were greeted by the Fisherman's elderly wife. Despite some mischievous interruptions from their adopted daughter Undine, the evening was filled with warm hospitality and friendly conversation. The Knight shared tales of his travels and revealed that he was Lord Huldbrand of Ringstetten. The night passed peacefully, with the Fisherman's family and their unexpected guest enjoying each other's company in their cozy home.|"['1.

The man's wife expressed her frustration with Undine, a playful but sometimes troublesome girl. The man compared his feelings towards Undine to his love for the unpredictable lake. Just then, Undine, a beautiful and enchanting girl, entered the room looking for a guest. She playfully interacted with the Knight, leaving him captivated by her charm. Despite the old woman's attempts to redirect her, Undine remained focused on the Knight, asking him questions. When the Knight was about to share his adventures, the old man interrupted, deeming it an inappropriate time. Undine, however, insisted on hearing the story and, in a fit of anger, stormed out into the night.

The Knight feared she might be a forest spirit lost in the storm. He searched frantically, thinking she might be trapped on an island formed by the flooding stream.

Despite the old man's sorrow, Undine was adamant about leaving with the knight rather than returning to the hut. Eventually, the knight convinced Undine to return, and they crossed the stream back to the old man's side. Overjoyed, the old man and his wife welcomed Undine back with open arms.

Upon halting, the evening shadows enveloped the surroundings. A gleaming white footpath emerged through the trees, hinting at a way out of the forest. Determined to follow it, an eerie white face with ever-changing features appeared among the leaves, persistently watching. Frustrated, attempts to push through were met with splashes of white foam, diverting the path away. The horse and rider were led further astray, followed closely by the mysterious figure. Eventually, emerging from the woods, the sight of a lawn, a lake, and a cottage brought relief. Undine explained the impossibility of crossing the swollen brook due to the raging waters.

At last, a problem arose between the Knight and the Fisherman. They used to enjoy wine together at noon and in the evening while the wind whistled around them. However, they had run out of the wine the Fisherman had brought from town long ago. Undine, who usually laughed at them, noticed their sadness. As the evening approached with stormy signs, Undine left the cottage. The Knight and the Fisherman anxiously went after her, worried about the impending storm. To their surprise, Undine found a barrel of wine washed ashore. They all worked together to bring it back to the cottage before the storm hit. They opened the barrel to find excellent wine, which they enjoyed by the fire, safe from the raging tempest. The Knight promised to compensate the owner of the wine if found, pleasing the old man.

A gentle knock on the door startled everyone, causing them to jump in fear. The Knight clutched his sword as an old man warned that a sword wouldn't help against what he feared. Undine bravely confronted the spirits outside, warning them through the door. A voice outside, revealed to be an aged Priest, sought shelter from the storm. Undine welcomed him in, holding a lamp to reveal his drenched appearance. The Priest, grateful for their kindness, declined the Knight's fancy cloak, opting for a simple garment instead. The Priest shared his harrowing journey through the storm and expressed gratitude for finding refuge with them.

"Undine knelt, revealing her tear-streaked face to Huldbrand. Fearful of rejection, she whispered, ""You'll cast me away now, though I've done no wrong, poor child that I am!"" Her words, filled with gentle despair, melted his heart. Rushing to her, he lifted her tenderly, and she smiled through tears, a dawn of hope in her eyes.

In the evening, Undine held the Knight's arm gently and guided him outside as the setting sun illuminated the grass and trees. Her face showed a mix of love and sadness, hinting at a secret. She led him silently, replying with looks filled with love. They reached a stream that had turned from a wild torrent to a gentle brook. Undine hinted at a farewell, but the Knight playfully refused, teasing about the Church and Emperor. Undine expressed her fear of being abandoned but left the choice to the Knight. She asked to be carried to an island to learn her fate. Sitting opposite him, she revealed her true nature as an Undine, a water spirit with no soul.

Huldbrand, filled with love and compassion, embraced Undine and carried her back. He vowed never to abandon his beloved wife, feeling more blessed than Pygmalion, whose statue Venus transformed into a living woman. Undine returned peacefully hanging on his arm. The next morning, Huldbrand awoke to find Undine missing, questioning if his marriage and Undine were just a dream. Undine reassured him, informing him that her uncle had calmed the waters. They decided to stay a few more days. Eventually, they bid farewell to the old couple and set off with a priest. Undine, Huldbrand, and the priest were joined by a mysterious stranger named Kühleborn, who tried to engage Undine in conversation, but she rejected him.

Undine pleaded with Kühleborn to leave them, fearing her husband's reaction to her strange family. Despite Undine's request, Kühleborn insisted on protecting them from malevolent spirits. When Undine asked him to depart as they reached the edge of the forest, Kühleborn grew angry. In a swift move, the Knight attempted to strike Kühleborn, but his sword hit a waterfall, drenching them all. Father Heilmann, seemingly awakened from a trance, remarked on the waterfall's peculiar behavior. The waterfall's message to the Knight urged him to protect his wife. The sudden disappearance of the Knight caused distress in the city, with Bertalda mourning his loss. When Huldbrand returned with Undine, joy spread among his servants, except Bertalda, who had feelings for him.

One evening, a young couple and their friend Bertalda strolled around the market square under the starlit sky. They admired the fountain's playful shapes and the serene surroundings. While discussing their upcoming journey, a tall man interrupted Undine, whispering in a foreign language. Undine's mysterious conversation with the man intrigued Huldbrand. As the man left angrily and stepped into the fountain, Huldbrand recognized him as Kühleborn. Undine teased Bertalda about a surprise on her birthday and invited her to dinner. Walking home, Huldbrand asked Undine about the man, but she promised to reveal everything in two days. At a lavish dinner with guests, including Bertalda, Undine kept a joyful secret.

An elderly woman approached the Duchess, expressing gratitude for her courage. She claimed that if the young woman in question was her daughter, she would have distinguishing marks on her body. The Duchess decided they would all go to another room to verify the claims. After a brief absence, it was confirmed that Bertalda was indeed the Fisherman's daughter. The Duke and Duchess left with Bertalda, leaving the gathering in shock. Undine, overwhelmed with emotion, sought comfort in Huldbrand's arms.

Undine and Bertalda embraced, shedding tears of emotion. Undine insisted on Bertalda joining them at Ringstetten, promising a sisterly bond. Huldbrand, moved by Bertalda's plight, assured her safety. They departed, leaving the city behind, seeking solace in the countryside. Arriving at Ringstetten, Undine shared her extraordinary tale with Bertalda, who, initially alarmed, found truth in her words. Bertalda's affection wavered, viewing Undine more as a spirit. Over time, Huldbrand's heart turned toward Bertalda, causing tension. Uncertain of Undine's true nature, Bertalda assumed control, with Huldbrand's support.

One day, Huldbrand rode out, and Undine asked her servants to seal the fountain in the courtyard. Despite objections, Undine insisted, explaining it was to avoid a worse fate. When they were about to close it, Bertalda protested, wanting the water for her complexion. Undine stood her ground, asserting her authority as mistress. The servants obeyed, ignoring Bertalda's pleas. Undine left mysterious markings on the stone covering the fountain. When the Knight returned, Bertalda complained, but Undine explained in private.

As Huldbrand found it futile to silence their tormentor with words, he had no choice but to block his entry by closing the door. The only way the tormentor could reach them was through a fountain. This uncle spirit had clashed with other fountain spirits in the nearby valleys. To prevent his uncle's interference, Huldbrand sealed the fountain with an inscription that weakened his uncle's power. This safeguarded them from any harm. Huldbrand, deeply touched by Undine's protective gesture, vowed to honor her wishes. Undine, grateful but cautious, asked Huldbrand to refrain from showing anger near water to avoid provoking her relatives. Despite Bertalda's demands to remove the stone, Huldbrand firmly refused, defending Undine. Later, Bertalda, in a fit of jealousy, fled the castle, leaving a letter explaining her departure. Undine, distressed, urged Huldbrand to bring Bertalda back. Huldbrand, consumed by his feelings for Bertalda, rode off in pursuit, despite Undine's warnings.

The Dark Valley nestled deep in the mountain's recesses. Once known by this name, its current title remains a mystery. Back then, locals named it for its shadowy demeanor, cast by tall, dark trees, mainly pines. The brook that trickled amidst the cliffs mirrored this darkness, lacking the sparkle of open skies. As twilight descended, the valley grew even darker, the Knight hastened on horseback, torn between the fear of losing ground and the dread of overlooking the fleeing Bertalda.

Huldbrand and Bertalda were walking through a fearful valley when a wild horse appeared. The horse was too frantic for them to ride, so they decided to walk home.

The Knight woke up from a dream feeling half-awake on his bed in the early morning. In his dream, he was scared by mysterious terrors and felt as if he was surrounded by phantoms. When he fell asleep again, he imagined being carried by swans over lands and seas while hearing their sweet melody. He saw Undine, shedding tears in a crystal hall under the sea. Kühleborn, appearing as well, reminded Undine of the consequences if the Knight remarried. Undine, undeterred, stated she sealed the fountain against her kind and that the Knight was still mourning her. Kühleborn warned that the Knight might forget and free the fountain, leading to Undine's duty to execute a death sentence.

The wedding day at Ringstetten was a mix of joy and sorrow. The absence of Undine, the beloved soul of the feast, cast a shadow over the celebration. Despite no spectral disturbances, a feeling of melancholy haunted the Knight, the Fisherman, and all the guests. Bertalda, the bride, tried to maintain cheerfulness but couldn't shake off the sadness. As the party dispersed early, Bertalda, feeling a sense of emptiness, focused on her appearance, noticing a freckle on her throat. She longed for the beautifying water from the now sealed fountain in the courtyard. Surprisingly, her wish was granted as the fountain was reopened by the workmen, revealing a pale woman veiled in white, weeping as she approached the castle.

Once the mysterious figure entered the castle, everyone stood frozen at the window, watching in silence. The visitor, with tears streaming down her face, moved through the familiar halls where she once walked joyfully. Meanwhile, the Knight, feeling dejected and half-dressed, heard a soft tap on the door. He thought it was just his imagination, reminiscing about Undine's playful knocks. But as the door creaked open, he saw her ghostly figure enter, whispering about the spring being opened and his impending death. Overwhelmed with love and fear, the Knight embraced her, only for Undine to hold him tightly, weeping.

In ancient times, a sad procession moved solemnly towards the churchyard. Heilmann led, carrying a crucifix, followed by bereaved Bertalda leaning on her father. Among the mourners, a veiled figure appeared, causing unease and confusion. Approaching Bertalda unnoticed, the figure knelt at the knight's grave, stirring memories of Undine. As prayers were offered, the veiled form vanished, leaving a silvery brook encircling the tomb. This spring, believed to be Undine's embrace, still flows today. In another land, Naomi faced loss and famine, deciding to return to Judah.

Ernest grew up in a valley where a new poet, also native to the region but spending most of his life in cities, had emerged. The poet, inspired by his childhood mountains and the Great Stone Face, infused his verses with grandeur. His words transformed the ordinary into celestial beauty, elevating nature and people alike. Despite skeptics dismissing his visions as mere fancy, the poet's idealism illuminated the world's true essence. Ernest, a man of unassuming wisdom, found solace in the poet's verses, which stirred his soul. The poet, drawn to Ernest's simplicity and profound insight, sought him out and became his guest. As they conversed, their minds harmonized, creating a symphony of shared thoughts and enriching each other's perspectives. Their bond transcended individuality, weaving a tapestry of profound understanding and mutual enlightenment.|"[""1.

Ernest, with a solemn expression, gazed at the poet's face, then turned to the Great Stone Face and back to the poet with a disappointed look. The poet sadly admitted that he did not embody the greatness of the stone face. As they walked to Ernest's usual spot for sharing thoughts at sunset, the poet confessed his own shortcomings, feeling unworthy of the divine image. Ernest, a man of genuine deeds and deep thoughts, addressed the gathered audience, his words resonating with truth and sincerity. The poet, moved by Ernest's wisdom and goodness, saw him as a true prophet. As the sun set, the Great Stone Face and Ernest's face seemed to merge in benevolent glory, fulfilling a prophecy.

"I saw this unfold while I was stuck at the old Mission House in Mackinaw, waiting for a Lake Superior ship that never arrived.

During a treason trial in Richmond, a man named Nolan, who was found guilty, shocked everyone by denouncing his country, the United States, when asked to defend his loyalty. Nolan, who had a turbulent past with ties to Spanish and French influences, had grown up in a time of political plots. Despite being fed and clothed by the United States, he cursed the nation in a moment of frenzy. As a consequence, he was sentenced to spend the rest of his life at sea without ever hearing the name of his country again. This event left an indelible mark on those who witnessed it, with even the seasoned Colonel Morgan deeply affected by Nolan's outburst.

Colonel Morgan likely took the court proceedings to Washington city and explained them to Mr. Jefferson. The President approved the sentence, as confirmed by those who claim to have seen his signature. Before the _Nautilus_ arrived on the Northern Atlantic coast with the prisoner, the sentence had been sanctioned, leaving him stateless. The plan involved sending him on a long cruise to ensure he never saw or heard of his country. The Secretary of the Navy, likely the first Crowninshield, was asked to place Nolan on a government vessel for this purpose. The instructions mandated treating him as an officer of his former rank, with no mention or knowledge of his country. Nolan lived out his days under this arrangement until his passing. The rule of limited contact with him was maintained on subsequent ships, ensuring he remained isolated from discussions about home or return.|"['1.

After I enlisted in the navy, I recall a time when I was on shore with senior officers from my ship and the _Brandywine_, which we encountered at Alexandria. We were granted leave for a trip to Cairo and the Pyramids. As we rode donkeys towards our destination, the conversation turned to Nolan, a fellow sailor who was rarely allowed on land. Although he couldn't go ashore, his shipmates lent him books from abroad, ensuring they made no mention of America. Unfortunately, any mention of the United States in the foreign papers had to be removed before lending them to Nolan, leaving holes in his reading material.

I met a man named Philip Nolan who influenced me greatly during my youth. Despite his mysterious past and the Department's denial of his existence, he was kind and helped me with my studies. He instilled in me a love for mathematics and lent me books. Even though he never directly spoke of his own story again, I learned bits and pieces from other officers over the years. Nolan never caused trouble intentionally, and even when accidents occurred, they were never his fault.

Nolan unintentionally caused a commotion at my table once, revealing his lack of knowledge about Texas, which led to an awkward moment.

Dorothea, a serious seventeen-year-old girl, was burdened with responsibilities from a young age, being the eldest of ten children in the Strehla family.

August was a young boy with a vivid imagination. Every night, he would sit by the stove and tell stories to the other children. The stove, named Hirschvogel, was like a god to them. In summer, they adorned it with fresh moss and flowers, while in winter, they huddled around it for warmth. August's tales were inspired by the charcoal pictures on the stove, depicting the life of a person from birth to death. Although August had humble beginnings as a cow-keeper's son, he dreamed of creating beautiful things like Hirschvogel.

In the middle of their talking and laughing, a rush of freezing air and snow hit the room, piercing through the warmth of the old fur coats and the large stove. Their father had returned, opening the door to the cold. The younger kids happily greeted him, while Dorothea moved a chair close to the stove and August prepared a pipe and beer. Their father, usually kind and quiet, instructed Dorothea to take the children to bed. August, feeling more grown-up at nine, stayed by the stove, lost in thought. Their father, tired and unwell, revealed he had sold their prized possession, Hirschvogel, to pay debts. The news shocked August, who had treasured the stove.

"""It is not true! It is not true!"" he echoed stupidly. It seemed to him that the very skies must fall, and the earth perish if they could take away Hirschvogel. They might as soon talk of tearing down God's sun out of the heavens.

""You will find it true,"" said his father, doggedly, and angered because he was in his own soul bitterly ashamed to have bartered away the heirloom and treasure of his race, and the comfort and healthgiver of his young children. ""You will find it true. The dealer has paid me half the money tonight, and will pay me the other half tomorrow when he packs it up and takes it away to Munich.

Who would keep a gilded, painted thing in a poor house like this, when one can make two hundred florins by it? Dorothea, you never sobbed more when your mother died.

August's laughter turned into bitter weeping, collapsing onto the stove, sobbing uncontrollably. Dorothea, gentle and trembling, urged him to bed as the cold intensified. August, once carefree, now sullen and weary, refused, staying by the stove all night. His brothers, unaware, left for work early. August, sleepless and delirious, fought against being muzzled, finally thrown out by his father. The stove, a family treasure, was sold. Dorothea, searching for August, found him gone. The family realized the loss of warmth and light with the stove's departure. The father, regretful, watched it being taken away.

"He overcame his fear and crying, even though he was completely in the dark. The large stove provided him with ample space and air that came through the top fretwork.

The voice faded to silence, and a golden light dimmed. A soft melody played on the old spinet adorned with faded roses. Clocks struck six as day broke over the Bayerischenwald. August woke on the cold chamber floor. The Lady of Meissen and the Saxe poodle were still. He felt absorbed in the wondrous sights and sounds.

Bob quickly sensed the commotion of a dog-fight without seeing it directly, thanks to his sharp instincts. The scene was chaotic, with a mainly male crowd surrounding two battling dogs. A brave woman tried to intervene but was met with resistance. Bob and his companion witnessed a fierce fight between a white bull-terrier and a shepherd's dog. Despite the shepherd's dog's bravery, the bull-terrier's training prevailed. The crowd offered various suggestions to end the fight, but it was a pinch of snuff that finally made the bull-terrier release his grip. However, the bull-terrier, still aggressive, attacked another dog, only to be thwarted by a muzzled mastiff under the South Bridge.

We quickly gathered a crowd as the Chicken struggled. Bob yelled for a knife, and a shoemaker handed him a worn, sharp blade. I guided it through the leather, and with one swift motion, the fierce little creature fell lifeless. A somber hush fell over us. I examined the fallen bird, lifeless from the mastiff's attack. The dog, now calm, sniffed around before trotting away. Bob picked up the deceased Chicken, deciding to bury it later. I followed the mastiff, who led us to the Harrow Inn. There, a carrier awaited, scolding the mastiff named Rab. The carrier, upon hearing the tale, softened towards Rab, and they departed together. Bob and I solemnly buried the Chicken that evening. Rab and I formed a bond through head scratches and treats. Rab's master, James Noble, greeted me briefly.
