"The fisherman chuckled. ""That's right, young one; but come, I'll clarify,"" and guiding Davy closer to the ship's ""skeleton,"" he started explaining the names and functions of its parts. ""Notice that long, thick timber,"" he pointed, ""from this end, the `stern,' to that end, the `bow'--that's the `keel.' This post rising here is the `stern-post,' and that one at the far end is the `stem' or `cutwater.' These are key timbers, crucial for a ship's safety. The timbers branching from the keel are `ribs,' strong, with beams connecting them. The planks are nailed on with iron bolts and wooden nails. The seams are filled with oakum, and the ship is coated in pitch, tar, and copper to deter wood worms. The masts and rigging are added after launching,"" he explained. Davy's mind was filled with ship details, and he dreamt of sailing on the _Fair Nancy_."|"['1.

The vessel had transformed since Davy's first glimpse of it. Four small masts now stood tall, adorned with vibrant flags. The hull gleamed with fresh paint and a copper finish, the shipyard debris cleared, presenting a tidy appearance. The inclined stocks pointed towards the water's edge, ready to launch the ship effortlessly. Davy, eager but small amidst the crowd, climbed a post for a clear view. As the final prop was struck, a lady christened the ship with a wine bottle, marking the exhilarating moment when the Fair Nancy glided into the sea to the cheers of the spectators. After the launch, preparations began to fit the ship with masts at the shear-hulk. Davy's wish to sail the seas was granted by his father. With Ben Block, Davy procured sea attire for the voyage, receiving advice and blessings from his tearful mother before setting off.|"[""1.

"In a short time, he was aboard the ship heading out to sea, known as ""outward-bound."" The ship, the _Fair Nancy_, with its billowing white sails, looked like a cloud against the strong wind. As Davy's parents watched from the shore, the ship sailed away, vanishing into the distance over the horizon. Despite feeling homesick, Davy's curiosity was piqued by the new sights on the ship. He discovered the bulwarks obstructed his view, but through the gangway, he glimpsed the vast sea. The steward, a helpful figure on the ship, noticed Davy feeling seasick and offered assistance. Davy was led below deck where he saw the ship's various rooms and sailors going about their tasks. The steward helped Davy settle into his hammock, a swinging bed on board. Despite the initial discomfort and noise of the ship, Davy eventually found some relief and rest."|"['1.

"Davy whispered, ""My poor mother,"" tears welling up, praying to see her again. Suddenly, a massive wave loomed, threatening to capsize the ship. Men shouted, ""Hold on!"" as the ship tilted on its side. Water flooded in, and the ship lay helpless. ""Cut the masts!"" the captain commanded. With a crash, the masts were gone, but the ship remained tilted. Another wave struck, shattering windows and washing away the boats. The foremast broke, allowing the ship to right itself. They rigged a makeshift mast, but it too was lost to the storm. Water filled the ship rapidly, and the men knew they were in grave danger. As morning broke, the ship lay broken, the captain scanning the horizon for help. Davy suggested building a raft."|"[""1.

The captain, with a firm voice, urged the sailors to quickly build a raft from spare parts of the ship. The crew, exhausted from the storm, worked diligently to construct the raft, salvaging broken masts and planks. They loaded it with supplies and prepared to leave the sinking ship. As they hurried onto the raft, the captain's wife was the first to step aboard. However, a crucial mast and sail were forgotten, causing a few men to remain stranded on the doomed vessel. Despite a glimmer of hope from Ben Block about keeping the ship afloat, the situation grew dire as night fell. The ship eventually crashed onto rocky shores, leaving the crew facing a perilous situation with no help in sight.|"['1.

"""We must swim for it now,"" said the captain, gazing sadly at the churning surf and huge waves crashing over the rocks, sending spray back onto the ship. ""Surf"" is the foam formed by waves hitting the shore. Swimming in this sea surf can be very difficult and dangerous. The crew hesitated, unsure of what to do, as the ship began to break apart on the sharp rocks. Ben Block, a skilled swimmer, bravely tied a rope around his shoulders to swim to shore and secure it for others. Despite a scary moment when Ben disappeared under a wave, he managed to reach the beach safely. By securing a rope to the ship, all the sailors were able to make it to shore. After days of hardship, hunger, and cold, they found help in a village and eventually made their way back home."|"['1.
