Ancient history can be puzzling, especially when presented in a straightforward manner without much context. Dr. Johnson compared the history of England to that of the Jewish kings, highlighting the importance of providing background details to make events believable. Similarly, ancient Chinese history lacks a cohesive narrative, with events recorded in a diary-like fashion without much explanation. This method leaves room for individual interpretation but makes it challenging to grasp the broader implications of historical events. To overcome these difficulties, this book aims to extract principles from isolated facts, avoid overwhelming readers with Chinese proper names, and offer a simplified understanding of Chinese antiquity. By focusing on general trends and motivations rather than specific names and actions, readers can gain a clearer insight into ancient Chinese civilization.|"['1.

In ancient China, history began with the country being divided into fiefs, similar to modern districts called _hien_. Mesne lords and sub-vassals governed these fiefs. Migration and colonizing were methods used, with the Yellow River playing a significant role in 842 B.C. Distant fiefs in today's Shan Tung and Chih Li provinces were established. The Hwai River system and a river later part of the Grand Canal were vital. Europeans viewed China from the sea inward. Corea, Japan, and Liao Tung were unknown, and orthodox Chinese in Shan Tung adopted barbarian customs. The early Chinese satraps' characteristics, the collapse of the Emperor in 842 B.C., and subsequent events leading to the Chou dynasty's establishment were significant historical events. The period covered by Confucius' history from 722 B.C. to 480 B.C. marked a time of change in China.|['Question 1:\nWhat term is used in the text to refer to the modern districts in ancient China?\nA) Mesne\nB) Liao Tung\nC) Shan Tung\nD) Hwai River\nE) Hien', 'Question 2:\nWhich river played a significant role in ancient China in 842 B.C. according to the text?\nA) Yangtze River\nB) Mekong River\nC) Yellow River\nD) Hwai River\nE) Grand Canal', 'Question 3:\nWhich of the following regions were unknown to Europeans viewing China from the sea inward, according to the text?\nA) Corea\nB) Japan\nC) Shan Tung\nD) Chih Li\nE) Mesne', 'Question 4:\nWhat marked a significant historical event according to the text, leading to the establishment of the Chou dynasty?\nA) Migration and colonizing\nB) Collapse of the Emperor in 842 B.C.\nC) Adoption of barbarian customs by orthodox Chinese\nD) Establishment of distant fiefs in Shan Tung and Chih Li provinces\nE) Role of the Hwai River system', 'Question 5:\nWhich period in Chinese history marked a time of change, according to the text?\nA) 842 B.C. to 480 B.C.\nB) 722 B.C. to 480 B.C.\nC) 842 B.C. to 722 B.C.\nD) 480 B.C. to 842 B.C.\nE) 480 B.C. to 722 B.C.', 'Question 6:\nWhat were the characteristics of the early Chinese satraps mentioned in the text?\nA) Adoption of barbarian customs\nB) Establishment of distant fiefs\nC) Collapse of the Emperor in 842 B.C.\nD) Role of the Yellow River\nE) Migration and colonizing']|['E) Hien', 'C) Yellow River', 'A) Corea', 'B) Collapse of the Emperor in 842 B.C.', 'B) 722 B.C. to 480 B.C.', 'A) Adoption of barbarian customs']
"The Emperors of the Chou dynasty held various titles, with the word ""King"" evolving over time. Posthumous names were significant, and the distinction between ""Emperor"" and ""Imperial"" was crucial. Lao-tsz's perspective shed light on these titles. Comparison with other civilizations like Babylonia and Egypt highlighted China's unique feudal structure. Feudal princes did not hold the same title as the Emperor. The Roman Emperors and the five ranks of nobles were also discussed. The Emperor's private ""dukes"" were likened to cardinals. Sacrificial rights and the state of various regions like Lu, Ts'i, and Tsin were explored.

Until recently, the Chinese were unsure of the true source of the Yang-tsz River. The River Min was believed to be the primary headwater. It flows through the fertile land of ancient Shuh, now the hub of Sz Ch'wan province. Ancient China once referred to the Yellow River, followed by the Han and the Hwai, then the Yang-tsz, and lastly the Sz Ch'wan tributaries of the Yang-tsz. By utilizing the lakes and rivers south of the Yang-tsz, China expanded its influence to the south. In 842 B.C., a significant date in Chinese history, the Emperor fled his capital due to discontent with his tyrannical rule. The Emperor sought refuge northward on the Tartar frontier, leaving a regency in charge of imperial affairs. At this time, China, also known as the Central Kingdom, was limited to the modern province of Ho Nan. The ruling dynasty had distributed land to vassal princes, granting them relative autonomy within their territories. The larger vassal princes were often linked to the Emperor's lineage, while minor fiefs were insignificant in political matters. The land was divided into small territories, similar to modern walled cities and surrounding districts. China's early civilization was concentrated along the Yellow River's south bank, with colonists expanding outward along river systems. The Yellow River's course in ancient times was different from its present path, flowing north near modern-day Tientsin. The river's|"[""1.

China's historical expansion is complex due to its vast territory and diverse tribes. Before 842 B.C., Central China had limited knowledge of regions like Corea, Japan, and Liao Tung. The coast of Shan Tung was controlled by Eastern Barbarians. Chinese vassal rulers held territories south and east of the Yellow River, adopting some barbarian customs. The Wei Valley was colonized by a semi-Chinese state, influencing the region. Chinese beginnings were gradual, akin to other civilizations like the Greeks. By 815 B.C., the Warden of the Western Marches, a semi-Tartar ruler, played a crucial role in Chinese history. The Emperor's capital was moved east due to conflicts with Tartars. This shift marked a pivotal point in Chinese history, akin to the founding of Rome.|"[""1.

During ancient times in China, the ruling Chou dynasty had gained control over the vassal princes around 1122 B.C. The dynasty essentially conquered China by invitation, similar to how William III accepted rule in the British Isles due to dissatisfaction with the previous ruler. Before this conquest, the vassal princes of Chou had occupied the same territory and had a similar relationship with the imperial dynasty they overthrew in 1122 B.C. The overthrown Shang dynasty had previously ousted the Hia dynasty in 1766 B.C. From 771 B.C. to 250 B.C., the rule of the feudal Emperors of China was largely symbolic, focusing on form and ritual. The period from 722-480 B.C. saw incipient revolution due to population growth, advances in material civilization, and a weakened imperial power. The State of Tsin, established in 1106 B.C., acted as a buffer state against Tartar-Turk tribes in the north and played a significant role in Chinese history.|['1.

"In ancient times, the state of Ts'i played a crucial role in fending off Tartar tribes and establishing its civilization, influenced by Chinese principles but adapted to local needs. Situated between the Yellow River and the sea, Ts'i expanded beyond modern Shan Tung, possibly reaching as far north as the Yellow River's mouth near present-day Tientsin. The region was initially inhabited by ""barbarian"" tribes, later assimilated into Chinese culture. An advisor from Ts'i aided the Chou Emperor in 1122 B.C., receiving the fief of Ts'i. By the 7th century B.C., Ts'i, along with Ts'in and Tsin, emerged as powerful states. Yen, a vassal state north of the Yellow River, gained strength around 350 B.C. The region's significance lies in its historical ties to Chinese-Tartar interactions, shaping early Chinese history."|"[""1.

"At a critical juncture in ancient Chinese history, the northern and western regions were under the control of unknown forces, isolating the Middle Kingdom. These powers occasionally raided, keeping distant lands like India, Tibet, and Persia a mystery to the Chinese. After the fall of the imperial rule in 771 B.C., unrest spread to the south and other regions inhabited by nomadic tribes lacking settlements, agriculture, and literacy, engaging in raids on settled neighbors. The ""Jungle,"" located south of the Chinese princes in Ho Nan province, acted as a buffer, influencing the southern tribes indirectly. The ruling class in the Jungle, with Chinese origins, displayed early signs of civilization. The Jungle King's descendants extended their rule along the Yang-tsz River, possibly including parts of the Annamese race.

Confucius, a renowned historical figure, recorded eclipses and events accurately in ancient China. By comparing Oppolzer's Julian dates with Confucius' records, it was found that the eclipses were consistent, with minor discrepancies of about a month. The Chinese used a sixty-day cycle to compute days and years, enabling precise calculations even for events dating back centuries. Chinese historians' accounts of celestial phenomena align closely with modern astronomical calculations, showcasing their accuracy. The use of war-chariots in ancient Chinese warfare was prominent, with the Emperor possessing a force of 10,000 chariots. Vassals were limited to 1000 war-chariots, emphasizing the significance of chariots in battles. The intricate details of past events and warfare shed light on the rich history and military strategies of ancient China.|"['1.

In ancient China, the vassal states saw the rise of powerful families that often influenced the ruling dukes, counts, or barons. For example, in 537, the King of Ts'u planned an attack on Tsin but was warned that the ruler of Tsin had many nobles who could each field 100 war-chariots. Chariots were commonly used in warfare, as seen in 572 when Ts'u and Tsin vied for control over a Chinese principality, with Ts'u's ally surprisingly lacking chariots. Refugees seeking asylum in Tsin brought varying numbers of chariots as gifts, influencing their treatment. War-chariots were significant in battles, like the one in 627 where Ts'in defeated Tsin decisively. The use of boats for troop transport and the introduction of canal systems later replaced chariots in warfare. Army sizes were limited due to the population constraints of ancient China. Flags were used for signaling movements during battles and hunts, with sacrifices made to drums before battles as a longstanding tradition.|"['1.

Long ago, before the Chou dynasty's reign in 1122 B.C., the Yang-tsz delta was home to two powerful coast states that challenged Ts'u's authority. The Great River, known as the _Kiang_, had three mouths, one of which led near modern-day Hangchow. The middle course ran through Soochow Creek and the Wusung River of Shanghai. The King of Wu, ruling over Shanghai, Soochow, and Nanking, sought to gain independence from Ts'u. He engaged in political intrigue, visited various courts, and learned the rites. Confucius barely acknowledged him until his death in 561 B.C. The wars between Wu and Ts'u were fierce and historic, with Wu eventually falling in 483. The rise of Yiieh, a powerful state near Ningpo, added to the tumultuous times. Confucius lived during these events, advocating a return to feudal ways and establishing teachings for political guidance. The first hegemon, the Lord of Ts'i, played a crucial role in protecting the federated Chinese Empire after the collapse of the imperial power. His ancestor had aided the founder of the Chou dynasty and significantly improved the economic conditions of Ts'i.|"['1.

In the year 894 B.C., a prince of Ts'i faced a brutal fate when he was boiled alive at the Emperor's command due to a political misstep. His successor relocated the capital, only to have his son move it back after thirty-five years. In 842, the imperial upheaval caused concern even in far-off Ts'i, leading to a call for the reigning Marquess of Ts'i to aid in quelling the Western Tartars in 827. By 706, Ts'i sought help from a Chinese principality against Northern Tartar threats. In 690, a prince of Ts'i avenged his ancestor's fate by attacking the adviser's descendant. This event led to the rise of a prominent figure, Kwan-tsz, who served as a protector and adviser, marking a significant era in Chinese history.|"[""1.

In 538, during a significant event in Ts'u's history, the King of Ts'u acted in a disgraceful manner by capturing a ruler of a small state who had married a princess of Wu, a former vassal. Additionally, the King of Ts'u considered extreme actions against two statesmen from Tsin, his enemy, seeking advice on castrating one and cutting off the feet of the other. Despite the King's intentions, a wise premier cautioned him about the repercussions of such actions. During a Peace Conference in 546, Ts'u was caught attempting treachery by wearing armor under their attire, which was diplomatically handled by a Tsin statesman to avoid conflict. Furthermore, Confucius, a minister from Lu, displayed sharp insight during a visit to Ts'i, preventing a potential act of treachery against his prince. Confucius' actions led to the restoration of wrongfully annexed territories and a promise of support in Ts'i's wars.|"[""1.

Around 278 B.C., the capital of Ts'u was shifted to Ch'en due to pressure from Ts'in. In 241 B.C., under Ts'in's influence, Ts'u's capital moved to a location marked by a double black cross on the south bank of the Hwai River. A significant event occurred in the marquisate of Tsin during the thirty-five years of Ts'i's dominance. Tsin expanded its territory, fought against Ts'in, and absorbed nearby Tartar tribes. Tsin's ruler, who had both legitimate and Tartar wives, faced succession challenges. Three of his sons by Tartar mothers succeeded him in reverse order of age. The eldest son, who ascended the throne at 62 after a tumultuous life, embarked on a compelling journey through various courts, including Ts'i and Ts'u, before reclaiming his rightful place as ruler of Tsin.|"[""1.

During the early years of political turmoil in ancient China, the Emperor faced challenges from various states like Tsin, Ts'u, and others. The Emperor needed a Protector to maintain order. Tsin, a powerful state, had to defeat Ts'u in battle for this to happen. To strengthen his position, the Emperor sent his son to confer a special status upon the chosen Protector. In a grand durbar in 632, the Emperor and Tsin's ruler met. Tsin demonstrated respect by offering Ts'u prisoners and the Emperor ceded territories. This period saw wars between different states, each vying for power. Despite the complex political landscape, China was slowly evolving culturally and socially. Religion, as we know it today, did not exist then, but ancestor worship and imperial rituals held significance in governance. Sacrifices and consultations with oracles were common practices. The ruling classes were guided by family and ancestral ties, and decisions were often made in consultation with the spirits of their forefathers.|"['1.

Prayer has been a significant practice since ancient times. For example, Shun, a monarch who prayed at a mountain in modern Hu Nan province, is a notable figure. The Duke of Chou prayed for his brother's recovery, offering himself as a substitute. The Emperor K'ang-hi also offered himself to Heaven for his sick grandmother. In the year 210 B.C., the King of Ts'in consulted soothsayers and was advised to pray for a favorable outcome. Before military expeditions, sacrifices were made to ancestors for success in battle. Ancestral shrines were crucial, with each rank having a specific number of shrines. Prayer and sacrifices to ancestors were common practices for success and guidance. The Temple of Heaven in Peking was a significant site for such rituals. The importance of prayer and ancestral worship is evident throughout history, showing its enduring cultural significance.|"[""1.

In 572 B.C., a Tsin ruler expressed gratitude for the help of his ancestors and lords in carrying out Tsin sacrifices. In 548, the Ts'i ruler, caught in palace intrigue, begged for permission to commit suicide in his ancestral hall. Ancestral tablets were crucial, representing where the spirit rests, and temples were where ancestral spiritual consciousness resided. Each ruler had their tablet on an altar with a hole in the center for access on all sides. The rulers of Lu had special sacrificial privileges due to their lineage. Destroying ancestral temples was a severe punishment, as seen in Lu when a minister fled, prompting the Marquess to sweep the temple but not cut off sacrifices. In 506, during wars between Wu and Ts'u, ancestral temples were destroyed, showing the importance of ancestral rituals in ancient Chinese culture.|"['1.

During the ancient times in China, the state of Ts'u had five capitals. In 504 B.C., the king had to abandon the Yang-tsz due to Wu attacks. By 278 B.C., Ts'in captured the fourth capital, making the ancient Ch'ta capital the new Ts'u capital. This shift changed Ts'u from a Han and Yang-tsz power to a Hwai River power. Shuh and Pa, modern-day Sz Ch'wan, were inaccessible from the Han system. The Han system was separated from the Wei system and Ts'in by a common watershed. Wu and Ts'u were the only powers knowledgeable about the Yang-tsz River, with Wu originally being part of or a vassal to Ts'u. The Bamboo Annals provide historical context, corroborating Confucius' history from 722 B.C. The Bamboo Books, discovered in 281 A.D., were written on bamboo slips and required antiquarians to transcribe them into modern script. The Tsin marquess's reign, the second of the Five Protectors, lasted only eight years. The Earl of Ts'in, a neighbour and brother-in-law of the Tsin marquess, laid the foundations for a powerful state destined to conquer China.|"[""1.

"In ancient Chinese history, Emperors and vassal princes were often referred to by posthumous names that highlighted their essential qualities. For example, in Europe, rulers like Louis le Bienaimé, Albert the Good, or Charles the Fat were known by such names. The posthumous name of the Ts'in earl was ""the Duke Muh,"" and the Emperor who died in 947 B.C. was called ""the King Muh."" The Chou dynasty rulers were referred to as ""Kings"" rather than ""Emperors."" The Bamboo Annals also mentioned a book called ""the Story of the Son of Heaven Muh,"" which detailed travels to the west. Duke Muh of Ts'in was believed to have undertaken this journey. The struggle for power between different Chinese states like Tsin, Ts'in, Ts'u, and Ts'i continued for centuries, with alliances and conflicts shaping the political landscape. The Five Tyrants or Protectors, including the Marquess of Ts'i, the Marquess of Tsin, the Duke of Sung, the Earl of Ts'in, and the King of Ts'u, played significant roles during this period.

In ancient times, the state of Wu was initially submissive to Ts'u until it found an opportunity to rebel. Similarly, the state of Yueh, which was even more barbarous and located southeast of Wu, seized the chance to attack Wu when Ts'u, their common overlord, demanded it. The conflicts between Wu and Yueh were mainly naval, with Yueh never reported using war-chariots. Wu quickly adopted Chinese chariots and civilization, abandoned by the first settlers in 1200 B.C. Wu's origin as a colony created by ancestors of the Chou dynasty gave them a pretext to claim equality with Tsin. Wu even threatened the northern state of Ts'i, briefly holding authority in China. Wu's strategic location near rivers allowed them to navigate and establish political dominance. Ultimately, in 473, Wu was defeated by Yueh, which then became the dominant power.|"[""1.

In ancient China, while they didn't have a caste system like in India, the ruling and educated classes were mostly nobles. Families were destined for specific roles like ministers, envoys, or soldiers based on custom. Kwan-tsz, an early economist, was a descendant of the imperial Chou clan. Statesmen and scholars like Tsz-ch'an and Shuh Hiang were highly regarded. Yen-tsz was also a notable figure. Confucius, descended from the ducal family of Sung, was a key figure. Hiang Suh orchestrated a successful peace conference. The literary reputation of Ts'u was esteemed, with notable poems. Ts'in excelled in military prowess. Ts'u lacked political influence. Lao-tsz, possibly from Ts'u, didn't gain fame in Confucius' time. Confucius showed strategic and diplomatic skills in politics, notably in dealings with Ts'i.|"['1.

"In ancient China, the masses were divided into four groups. Scholars studied ""tao"" and sciences, traders dealt in goods, cultivators worked the land, and craftsmen created items for sale. Another classification by a sage adviser divided people into ten classes, with the Emperor at the top, followed by dukes, marquesses, middle classes, artisans, cultivators, police, carriers, eunuchs, and slaves. The system ensured obedience from lower classes to higher ones. The kingdom of Ts'u conducted a survey in 548 to assess land, resources, and arms. Taxes were based on land quality and resources, with good lands divided according to the Chou dynasty's method. Each family had an allotment, and hamlets of nine families cultivated together.

In ancient China, written communication played a crucial role in diplomatic relations between states. Treaties were sealed with solemn ceremonies and the sacrifice of a victim, symbolizing the seriousness of the agreements. The blood of the victim was used to mark the lips of the parties involved and was even spread on the treaty documents as a form of oath. These treaties were considered binding and were often accompanied by elaborate rituals to ensure their validity. Despite occasional disputes over protocol, such as the precedence of smearing lips with blood, the states of China recognized the importance of written agreements in maintaining peaceful relations.

During a treaty conference in 546 B.C. at the Sung capital, the host, considered superior to all, abstained from voting. The treaty was signed outside the host's gates, ignoring the Emperor's existence. In 579 B.C., a significant treaty between rivals Tsin and Ts'u was executed outside the walls of Sung. The terms included mutual support in success or failure, aid in war, and joint action against threats. Breaking the treaty would disperse armies and risk the kingdom's loss. The King of Ts'u sent word to leave Ts'in and Ts'i alone. This treaty aimed to maintain peace, but underlying motives were not purely humanitarian. Sacrificial rituals and blood oaths were common to seal agreements. Confucius emphasized the importance of fidelity in treaties, considering those obtained by force as invalid.|"[""1.

Let's delve into the history of China's progress. Confucius, born in 551 B.C. and passing away in 479 B.C., played a significant role during this era. His teachings and influence were shaped by the state of the empire during his lifetime. Growing up in Lu, he witnessed the emergence of a diverse China with democratic tendencies. Lu faced challenges from powerful families, reminiscent of King John's struggles with his barons. Confucius later became a key advisor in Lu, clashing with influential factions and navigating diplomatic challenges. His actions, as detailed in historical accounts, reveal a pragmatic and strategic thinker, contrary to common misconceptions. By examining the specifics of his life alongside broader historical contexts, we gain a deeper understanding of Confucius's true character and contributions to Chinese society.|"[""1.

Lu was nearly equal to the imperial capital in terms of education, customs, music, rituals, behavior, and spiritual status. Confucius, although not a high official, was passionate about restoring imperial rights. He focused on teaching, reading, and sharing moral stories due to his Sung descent and lack of political influence. Confucius faced challenges from Ts'i, a state fearing Lu's rise under his leadership. The Marquess of Ts'i tried to corrupt Lu's prince to prevent Confucius from gaining power. Disheartened, Confucius embarked on a thirteen-year journey, revising and editing key Chinese texts. Chinese law was based on natural order, with the Emperor enforcing punishment for breaches. Private affairs were separate from the state's concern, only intervening for public welfare. Emperor Muh of the Chou dynasty initiated law reforms to maintain order among the people. The Emperor's laws were proclaimed throughout vassal kingdoms, with magistrates making decisions based on inspired judgment. Arbitrariness by rulers often led to injustice, as seen in historical events involving boiling a ruler alive and capricious selections based on appearance rather than merit.|"['1.

"In ancient China, around 746 B.C., the state of Ts'in introduced a harsh law called the ""three stock"" law, where not only the criminal but also three generations of their family were executed for the crime. This severe approach was adopted by other states like Tsin, where families of political refugees were exterminated. The laws of Ts'u were particularly brutal, with instances of massacres for various offenses. In contrast, Lu state's statesman, Tsang Wen-chung, crafted a code that was criticized by Confucius for being too severe. The importance of laws and their enforcement was evident in various states, highlighting the need for just and fair legal systems. Different states had their own interpretations and implementations of laws, showing the diversity in legal practices across ancient China."|"[""1.

"Around the year 594, two important individuals were ordered to be killed directly by the Emperor. In an explanation for this rare incident, it is stated that the Emperor is considered the ultimate authority, and his successors hold the power that no subject can challenge. Following Confucius' passing in 479 B.C., the dominant state of Tsin began to weaken due to internal conflicts among powerful families. Eventually, the state of Tsin split into Han, Wei, and Chao. Wei, also known as Liang, implemented new land and penal laws under the guidance of Li K'wei. Li K'wei's legal system, known as the ""Law Classic,"" influenced Chinese law for centuries. Ancient engineering feats, like canalization by Li Ping, have left lasting impacts on China's landscape. The Wu kingdom, founded by a relative of the Chou dynasty, constructed canals for transportation and irrigation purposes. The King of Wu expanded water routes to dominate Shan Tung, aiming to control the region's rivers for strategic advantages.

The ancient kingdom of Ts'in built the first bridge over the Yellow River in 257 B.C. This bridge connected T'ung-thou Fu and P'u-chou Fu, making travel easier between these cities. Before the bridge, armies had to cross the river at fords. For example, in 1122 B.C., the founder of the Chou dynasty called his vassals to meet him at the Ford of Mêng, located between Ho-nan Fu and Hwai-k'ing Fu. This historical site can still be found on maps today. The construction of bridges and walls played a crucial role in ancient China's defense and communication strategies. The Great Wall of China, built in 217 B.C., was preceded by other walls constructed to protect against invaders. These structures were essential for controlling movement and ensuring security in the region.|"[""1.

In ancient China, the city of Ts'u was known for its grand public buildings. In 542 B.C., the ruler of Lu was so impressed by Ts'u's architecture that he built a palace in its likeness. Meanwhile, the original capital of Wu was described as modest, with narrow streets and a simple palace in 523 B.C. However, in 513 B.C., a new king moved the capital to Soochow, transforming it into a magnificent city with eight gates, water-gates for boats, towers, kiosks, and more. The city was meticulously planned, with an extensive arsenal and shipyard in a separate area. Ts'in, on the other hand, had less substantial capitals, and little is known about its early economic life. The First August Emperor later built lavish palaces along the Wei River after conquering China.|"[""1.

After Confucius' passing, China faced changes. The powerful Wu state met its end in 473 B.C., with the ruling class fleeing east. Relations between Japan and China began in the second and third centuries A.D. Chinese history suggests Japanese rulers traced ancestry to Chinese emperors from 2100 B.C., who fled Wu to China. Evidence supports migration to Japan. Wu's power fell to Yüeh in 473, and Yüeh's rule, mainly maritime, lasted. Tsin's families divided the realm in 453, forming Wei, Han, and Chao. By 403, they were recognized as feudal princes. Ts'i faced turmoil, with the T'ien family usurping the throne in 391. Ts'in's dominance waned in China, and Wei Yang's reforms in Ts'in led to its rise. Ts'in eventually conquered the empire.|"[""1.

"During the Six Kingdom Period, which can also be referred to as the Seven Kingdoms period if Ts'in is included, major shifts in power occurred in ancient China. The three powerful states of Ngwei, Han, and Chao, along with Yen in the north and Ts'u in the south, dominated the political landscape. Ts'i, once a key player, found itself in a vulnerable position. The era saw the rise of emulous royal courts and increased military, political, and literary activities. The period is often described as the time of Chinese chivalry, with the monarchs of the Chou dynasty adopting the title of ""wang,"" meaning king.

"In ancient China, the Duke of Shao, a relative of the ""Warrior King,"" held influence in Yen. Yen, a small region between Tsin and Ts'i, focused on civilizing Tartar and Corean tribes. Over time, Yen grew in wealth and power, becoming a significant state. Confucius mentioned Yen when advising the King of Ts'i to prepare for war against the rising Yen power. Ts'i, a powerful state, faced invasions from other kingdoms. Tsin, like Ts'i, was a strong state with occasional Tartar influence. The state of CHÊNG, founded in the ninth century B.C., served as a battleground for neighboring states. Ts'ao and Ts'ai, small states, were ruled by the imperial family. CH'ÊN's rulers descended from Emperor Shun. These states were often contested between different kingdoms. Most feudal states played minor roles in China's centralization. Rulers were posthumously titled ""Duke"" based on their character.

In ancient China, land granted by the Emperor to vassals could not be given away without the Emperor's permission. In 711 B.C., two states exchanged territory, with one giving up a village in the capital, and the other offering a place where the Emperor stayed on his way to Mount T'ai-shan. The Emperor's fiefs were not to be taken lightly; even a joke by the Emperor had serious consequences. When Ts'i helped Yen defeat the Tartars, the Prince of Ts'i returned the territory he had entered with the Prince of Yen, as only the Emperor could cross borders during such missions. The Emperor's power extended over all his vassals' lands, and his decisions were final. Imperial envoys were to be welcomed and accommodated in vassal states, as failure to do so could lead to conflict.

"During ancient times in China, the Emperor referred to himself as ""I, the one Man,"" resembling the Spanish ""Yo, el Rey."" Feudal lords addressed each other as ""The Scanty Man."" Ministers used terms like ""The Scanty Prince"" or ""The Scanty Lesser Prince"" when speaking of their own prince or his wife. Diplomatic language was carefully worded to avoid offense, with phrases like ""our vile village"" for ""our country."" The Emperor accepted gifts from vassals, but requests for chariots or gold were seen as undignified. The Emperor often sided with the strongest power and accepted what he could get. This period was followed by the era of the Fighting States, with Tsin and Ts'in as major powers. Ts'in expanded into Shuh, a territory similar to modern Sz Ch'wan.

During the fourth century B.C., the states of Ts'u and Ts'in were locked in a power struggle to dominate China. Ts'u aimed to form alliances in the north and south to counter Ts'in and Ts'i, while Ts'in sought east-west alliances to challenge Ts'u. The ultimate goal for both Ts'in and Ts'u was to control the entire Empire by using other states as pawns. Ts'in's military prowess was evident in numerous battles, decapitating tens of thousands of enemies. By 318 B.C., Ts'u had expanded its territory, including regions unknown to others. Ts'in, on the other hand, extended its influence towards the southwest and northwest.

"It is difficult to precisely determine the level of ""foreignness"" in the Ts'u culture. One clear non-Chinese term is _kou-u-du_, which means ""suckled by a tigress."" Additionally, the syllable _ngao_ is found in many titles and personal names in Ts'u, like _jo-ngao_, _tu-ngao_, _kia-ngao_, _mo-ngao_. Ts'u songs were not included in the Odes edited by Confucius, and their music was referred to as ""in the southern sound,"" possibly indicating a different language. The Ts'u language differed from that of other regions, even in terms like ""Annals"" and descriptions of certain conditions.

In ancient times, the King of Ts'u was honored for defeating and killing a ruler from another kingdom. This act was considered just because the ruler he killed was a criminal. However, when Ts'u killed a barbarian prince, they were not given the same honor. The distinction between these actions will be discussed in a later chapter. The country of Wu, which was once part of Ts'u, is also interesting. Two sons of a ruler from Wu decided to abandon their rights and live among the Jungle savages, adopting their ways. Wu was used by other Chinese states as a strategic tool against Ts'u. The language and customs of Wu were said to be similar to the country of Yiieh. Wu was initially isolated from Chinese civilization, as seen when they needed to be taught how to use war-chariots and bows.

During ancient times, the state of Wu had royal refugees who might have escaped to Japan. These refugees could have influenced the Japanese people by introducing Chinese words and customs long before formal contact between China and Japan. The states surrounding the Central Kingdom in 771 B.C. were considered semi-barbarous. The Central Kingdom, also known as Chu Hia, had modest beginnings. The Emperor was mentioned first in historical records, followed by other states like Cheng, Ts'i, Tsin, Sung, Wei, Ts'ai, Ts'ao, T'eng, and others. Ts'u and Wu had populations of foreign origin, and even Ts'i, an orthodox state, had influences from its founder conforming to local customs. Ts'in was known for its barbaric practices like human sacrifices, which hindered its acceptance by other orthodox states. It was only after adopting Chinese civilization that Ts'in became a significant power.|"['1.

In ancient times, rulers used music to convey hidden messages and manipulate situations. For example, in 559 B.C., a prince in Wei used a musician to offend a statesman, leading to his dethronement. This shows how music was a powerful tool in politics. Similarly, a princess in 644 B.C. quoted odes to influence her enamored husband's political decisions. These anecdotes reveal the intricate interplay of music, power, and politics in ancient China. Even Confucius' ancestor composed odes for the Duke of Sung to enhance his political ambitions. These stories highlight the significance of music and literature in shaping historical events and political strategies. Through these examples, we see how music and poetry were used as tools of influence and persuasion in ancient Chinese society.|"[""1.

"In ancient Ts'in, literary knowledge was scarce, unlike neighboring states such as Yüeh, where wise sayings were common. For example, the King of Yüeh was advised with an ancient saying when hesitating about actions: ""If one will not take gifts from Heaven, Heaven may send one misfortune."" This advice, rooted in Chinese history, remains relevant today. The Ts'in state, unique for having no literary records, aimed to break the feudal system. By 221 B.C., after uniting China, the First August Emperor focused on erasing old literature to establish his rule firmly. He despised didactic works and philosophical treatises that challenged his authority.

During ancient times in China, historical records were crucial for preserving events and knowledge. Confucius, a renowned figure, used various annals, including those of Ts'in and Lu, to compile historical texts. The Annals of Ts'in, along with the Bamboo Books, were important sources of information about the feudal states. Each state had its own annals, highlighting significant events and figures. For example, the great historian of Tsin in 627 B.C. and the Tsin historians in 607 and 510 B.C. were mentioned. Confucius himself referred to events from these annals in his works. The historical accounts from different states like Ts'i and Ts'u shed light on their political and cultural landscapes.

The Chinese civilization evolved from a patriarchal to a feudal society, then to a democratic system before succumbing to a centralized dictatorship. The core of China was surrounded by various tribes, but the origins of the orthodox Chinese remain a mystery. It is assumed that all people must have migrated from somewhere, but the exact origins of the Chinese are unclear. Records play a crucial role in differentiating between civilizations, and the Chinese civilization is believed to have existed for thousands of years in the same place. The Chinese language and culture have absorbed neighboring tribes over time, and the Chinese have followed paths of least resistance in their expansion. The Chinese civilization's administrative base in the north has influenced its interactions with neighboring regions, such as Indo-China and Tibet.

The Chinese have always been in China, and there is no evidence of immigration from other regions, including the Tarim Valley, Tartary, India, Tibet, or the Sea Islands. The idea of Chinese immigration from these places is merely a scheme to suggest a connection to the Tower of Babel and the Garden of Eden. The Chinese language and civilization have no historical ties to other ancient cultures like India or Babylonia. Confucius' mention of eclipses in his history provides some credibility to his historical accuracy. The Chinese calendar is lunar, with adjustments to synchronize lunar and solar years for agricultural purposes. Intercalary months are added to align the lunar year with the solar year.

Many family names in China originated from places, similar to Scottish naming customs. For example, in Lancashire, villagers often share the surname of the old lord of the manor. In ancient China, names were significant. Liu Hia, a man who met the emperor in 558, was named after his tenancy, Liu, and his appellation, Hia. Naming reflected social rank. A Lu official in 626 B.C. was praised by his social appellation due to his high ministerial rank. Naming traditions varied; for instance, a man could be named for killing a Chinese but not a barbarian prince. Names held clues about a person's background and status. Wei Yang, a key figure in Ts'in, was known by various names reflecting his origins and achievements. Names in history conveyed subtle messages and honored individuals.|"[""1.

In ancient China, posthumous names were not exclusive to royalty. Even counselors and concubines had them. The Emperor's counselor was referred to by both real and posthumous names in 817 and 796 B.C. A Lu ruler's concubine was mentioned by her clan-name and posthumous name in 542 B.C. The dying King of Ts'u chose a modest posthumous name reflecting his talents in 560 B.C. In terms of intermarriage, people with the same clan-name couldn't marry. The Emperor Muh had a liaison with a woman from his clan during a journey to Turkestan. The son of Emperor Muh had to punish a ruler who married three sisters of his own clan. These instances shed light on the significance of names in historical events and traditions. Eunuchs, a class that originated from law's severity, were employed in various roles based on their physical punishments, like being gate-keepers or serving females in the harem.|"['1.

In ancient China, eunuchs played various roles in the royal courts. They were sometimes involved in treacherous acts like assassination attempts. For example, in 655 B.C., a Tsin ruler sent a eunuch to assassinate his half-brother, the future Second Protector of China. Later, in 548 B.C., a eunuch assassinated the ruler of Ts'i. On the other hand, in 481 B.C., a faithful eunuch tried to save the ruler of Ts'i from assassination. Eunuchs were also used for different purposes, such as serving as coachmen. Despite their roles, some eunuchs were involved in revolts and murders.

In 541, the Ts'u envoy was hosted by the Tsin statesmen, where one of them used the opportunity to recite a warning Ode against drunkenness. Confucius was known to enjoy alcohol but was said to handle it well. In 506, the Ts'in ruler was noted as a heavy drinker, and in 489, a Ts'i councillor was described as drunk. The ruler of Ts'i and his wife were spotted drinking together, leading to a prisoner escape due to the drunken gaoler. Meat was more popular in ancient China, with a preference for horse-flesh among some. In 645, Duke Muh of Ts'in was saved by horse-flesh eaters. The expedition of Emperor Muh to the West in 984 B.C. is significant. The Ts'in Annals narrate how a skilled horse manipulator was sent back to China swiftly to handle a revolt while the Emperor was away exploring.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat did one of the Tsin statesmen recite during the visit of the Ts'u envoy in 541?\nA) A love poem\nB) A warning Ode against drunkenness\nC) A recipe for horse-flesh\nD) A political speech\nE) A philosophical discourse"", ""Question 2:\nWho was known to enjoy alcohol but handle it well, according to the text?\nA) The Ts'u envoy\nB) The Ts'in ruler\nC) Confucius\nD) The Ts'i councillor\nE) The ruler of Ts'i"", ""Question 3:\nWhich ruler was noted as a heavy drinker in 506?\nA) The Ts'u envoy\nB) The Ts'in ruler\nC) Confucius\nD) The Ts'i councillor\nE) The ruler of Ts'i"", 'Question 4:\nWhat led to a prisoner escape in the text?\nA) A feast\nB) A political meeting\nC) A poetry recital\nD) A drunken gaoler\nE) A horse race', 'Question 5:\nWhat was a popular food choice in ancient China, according to the text?\nA) Fish\nB) Vegetables\nC) Horse-flesh\nD) Chicken\nE) Rice', 'Question 6:\nWhat was the significance of the expedition of Emperor Muh to the West in 984 B.C.?\nA) To explore new trade routes\nB) To conquer neighboring kingdoms\nC) To search for rare spices\nD) To handle a revolt in China\nE) To study foreign cultures']"|"['B) A warning Ode against drunkenness', 'C) Confucius', ""B) The Ts'in ruler"", 'D) A drunken gaoler', 'C) Horse-flesh', 'D) To handle a revolt in China']"
In the year 281 A.D., a tomb near Wei, later part of Ngwei in the Tsin kingdom, was robbed. Among the ancient texts found there, two were of great interest: one detailed Emperor Muh's journey to the West, the other chronicled the Annals of Ngwei, including the general history of China. These Bamboo Books were written on bamboo tablets and mentioned Emperor Muh's expedition. Scholars have debated the places mentioned, with some suggesting a link to Western locations. However, recent studies indicate that Emperor Muh likely never ventured beyond the Tarim region. His journey, starting from the headwaters of the Han River, passed through various known regions, possibly ending near Urumtsi.

This is the primary journey, and whether the Chou Emperor in 984 B.C., or the Ts'in Duke in 650 B.C., made it, there are no difficulties or contradictions. Four crucial places are mentioned with the same names, frequently appearing in later history. The Emperor traveled with many carts or chariots, a distinct feature of ancient China. He encountered a large moulting-ground of birds in the desert, a place often mentioned in later Chinese accounts of Tartar-land. In the waterless desert, he had to sacrifice some horses for sustenance, a practice also observed by travelers in Siberia and Mongolia. The second and third journeys lasted 600 days each and ended at the same location as the first, known as Pao-CH'ÊNg on the Upper Han River. The narratives include tales of the Emperor's infatuation with a wizard and a liaison with a girl of his clan who died on the road. These journeys hold no geographical significance but provide insights into the Emperor's adventures along the main Tartar routes.|"[""1.

"In ancient China, the Chou dynasty was once considered a ""barbarian"" tribe of the west. The founder of the Chou dynasty in 1122 B.C. addressed his neighbors and allies, urging them to help conquer China. The original Chou territory was ceded to Ts'in in 771 B.C., transforming Ts'in into a sovereign state. Despite being the least literary state, Ts'in managed to compose detailed stories and inscriptions. The book also describes an incestuous affair and a grand funeral, raising questions about the Emperor Muh's involvement in rituals.

Professor Chavannes' enlightening proofs help confirm the historical authenticity of Emperor Muh's travels within the middle Tarim Valley. However, Duke Muh of Ts'in should be disregarded in this context, attributing the journey solely to Emperor Muh, as the Chinese historians do. The history of Wu, a barbarian kingdom, emerges in Chinese records around 585 B.C., with a lineage tracing back to the Chou dynasty. Wu's interactions with Yiieh and Ts'u, including battles and alliances, reveal a complex narrative of ancient power struggles. The migration of Wu's followers to Japan, possibly led by Fu-ch'ai, sheds light on early interactions between China and Japan. While historical evidence is scarce, it suggests nuanced relationships among ancient civilizations. Ethnological inquiries into prehistoric movements, like the Wu-Japan migration, highlight the challenges of reconstructing ancient migrations without concrete evidence.|"[""1.

The Japanese race, mixed or not, mostly remains where it always was. It is not belittling to early Japan to suggest a dynasty of Chinese adventurers or hereditary Chinese advisors and scribes. Similarly, European states often have ruling dynasties originating from elsewhere. The ancient chiefs of Japan, whether real or mythical, are as ancient as well-documented chiefs from Egypt, Babylonia, or China. Japanese history began when they understood Chinese texts. They assigned Chinese posthumous titles and historical facts to their heroes due to a lack of records. The peculiar customs in China, like abject surrender formalities, date back to ancient times. Surrendering generals bound themselves in 699 B.C., showing Ts'u's emergence. In 654, a baron presented himself tied, with a coffin, following an ancient tradition. These customs reflect the historical and cultural complexities of ancient China and Japan.|"['1.

In ancient China, succession of rulers often led to turmoil. In 817 B.C., the Emperor faced criticism for favoring a younger son over the elder in Lu. This irregularity continued in 796 and 608, causing unrest in Lu. Similar issues arose in other states like Ts'u and Ts'i. In 450 B.C., Ts'i faced trouble when a younger son was chosen over elder sons, leading to more chaos. Warfare customs included gruesome acts like flogging and cutting off ears. Rulers faced south to exercise power, while subjects faced north in respect. Facing south symbolized authority, as seen in Lu and Ts'u. Even in modern times, the tradition of facing a certain direction to show respect or power continues in Chinese culture.|"['1.

In ancient China, there was a tradition of not engaging in war with a mourning enemy, but this custom was often broken. An emperor from the Shang dynasty once stayed silent for three years in a mourning hut near a grave. Lu rulers modified customs and introduced a three-year mourning rule. The color black became a symbol of mourning in Tsin after a ruler dyed his white clothes black following an insult. Mourning periods influenced political decisions, like when Ts'u withdrew troops in respect of a mourning period in Cheng. Despite these traditions, attacks during mourning periods occurred, leading to political tensions and strategic decisions.

In ancient Chinese times, women were not as confined and secluded as they later became due to foot-binding practices that emerged a thousand years ago. Women were more involved in public affairs and exerted influence, especially in promoting succession rights. For example, the murder of an Emperor in 771 B.C. and subsequent events were influenced by women at court. Marriages between states often led to political complications, with marriages sometimes involving multiple wives and concubines. The story of a princess from Cheng being taken to Tsin in 589 resulted in significant political repercussions. The Kings of Ts'u were seen as arbitrary rulers, leading to their capable statesmen seeking service elsewhere. Marriages between states involved rituals and duties, such as sending handmaids to broaden the base of succession. Women's roles were governed by their fathers at home and husbands once married.|"[""1.

The exact roles of these assistants to wives, known as paranymphs, and the rules for their selection, are likely well described in the Rites of _Chou_. In 526 B.C., when Ts'in offered a princess in marriage to the Ts'u heir, the Ts'u king decided to keep her for himself. Just a few years earlier, Ts'u had married one of its princesses to the heir of an orthodox state, and the reigning father had inappropriate relations with her, leading to his murder by his son. After a defeat in 494 B.C., the King of Yiieh introduced strict laws to increase the population and prepare for revenge. Men were forbidden from marrying older women, and parents faced penalties if their daughters weren't married by seventeen. The King of Wu left an inscription in 212 B.C. denouncing immoral behavior in the region.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat is likely to be well described in the Rites of _Chou_?\nA) The history of the Ts'in dynasty\nB) The selection process of paranymphs\nC) The geography of ancient China\nD) The art of calligraphy\nE) The architecture of the Great Wall"", ""Question 2:\nWhy did the Ts'u king decide to keep the princess offered in marriage to the Ts'u heir in 526 B.C.?\nA) Because the Ts'u king was in love with the princess\nB) Because the Ts'u heir refused to marry her\nC) Because the Ts'u king wanted to maintain power\nD) Because the Ts'u heir was already married\nE) Because the princess was not of royal descent"", 'Question 3:\nWhat led to the murder of the reigning father in an orthodox state a few years before 526 B.C.?\nA) His inappropriate relations with a princess\nB) A disagreement over political policies\nC) A failed assassination attempt\nD) Natural causes\nE) A military invasion', 'Question 4:\nWhy did the King of Yiieh introduce strict laws after a defeat in 494 B.C.?\nA) To promote peace and harmony\nB) To decrease the population\nC) To prepare for revenge\nD) To encourage trade with neighboring kingdoms\nE) To focus on cultural development', 'Question 5:\nWhat were men forbidden from doing according to the strict laws introduced by the King of Yiieh?\nA) Owning land\nB) Marrying older women\nC) Joining the military\nD) Practicing religion\nE) Pursuing education', 'Question 6:\nWhat did the King of Wu denounce in the region in 212 B.C.?\nA) High taxes\nB) Immoral behavior\nC) Foreign influence\nD) Religious practices\nE) Agricultural techniques']"|"['B) The selection process of paranymphs', ""C) Because the Ts'u king wanted to maintain power"", 'A) His inappropriate relations with a princess', 'C) To prepare for revenge', 'B) Marrying older women', 'B) Immoral behavior']"

In the year 501, the original bow and sceptre given by a warrior king to his brother, the Duke of Chou, founder of the State of Lu, were stolen but thankfully recovered the following year. This incident is significant because the King of Ts'u had no relics of the founder, unlike other states. Chinese history has many such instances that seem incredible to us now. Confucius' connection to the Duke of Chou is evident in his house, temple, grave, and park, which were models for Confucius. Chinese critics ensure the authenticity of historical evidence. The Chinese-Tartar relations date back to ancient times, with Tartars occupying regions north and west of China. The Chou ancestor had to move south due to Tartar encroachment, showing the historical interactions between the Chinese and Tartars. Tartar tribes had a significant presence along the Yellow River, posing challenges to orthodox China. Confucius' knowledge even allowed him to identify a Tartar arrow.

In ancient China, Ts'i played a crucial role in driving back Mongol-Manchu tribes and rescuing Yen in 662. The Ts'i ruler led a coalition against Tartars in 658, restoring the ruler of Wei to his throne. The First Protector of Ts'i pacified westerly Tartars in 648 who posed a threat to the Emperor. The Second Protector, a refugee among Tartars, aimed to advise the First Protector but was rescued from a scandalous situation by his friends.

During ancient times in China, music played a significant role in political and social events. In 562 B.C., a statesman from Tsin established a trade agreement with the Tartars, and as a reward, he was granted the right to have certain music played in his presence. This practice was a mark of honor, similar to how it would have been esteemed for famous figures like the Duke of Wellington or Nelson to have specific music played for them. Music was not only used for political purposes but also had religious and cultural significance. In 527, the ruler of Lu abandoned music as a mark of respect during a sacrifice. Even in modern times, music is considered important in Chinese culture, with restrictions on its use during mourning periods.

Confucius, a wise man from ancient China, found himself entangled in political turmoil. His friend, the ruler of Ts'i, faced humiliation from the King of Wu. Confucius, known for his stern leadership, aimed to secure a worthy ruler for China. However, the Marquess of Ts'i plotted to assassinate both Confucius and his companion. Under the guise of a friendly meeting, Ts'i's envoy brought in foreign musicians armed with weapons, which Confucius saw through immediately. He demanded their execution for inciting conflict between rulers. Despite this, Confucius managed to secure a treaty, gaining territories for Lu. Later, due to political traps and personal slights, Confucius left his offices in disgust and embarked on a journey through various states, facing suspicion and danger along the way.|"['1.

Confucius spent over three years in Ch'en, witnessing neighboring towns being annexed by the King of Wu and conflicts between Tsin and Ts'u. During his stay, a bird of prey with a peculiar arrow fell near the prince's palace, leading Confucius to deduce it came from Manchuria. He then traveled north, revisiting Sung where he was briefly detained for breaking a promise made under duress. Advising the Duke of Wei to attack Sung, he considered aiding a Tsin rebel but ultimately returned to Wei. Confucius later journeyed to Ts'ai and a Ts'u town, eventually staying in Ts'ai for three years. His reputation as an administrator grew, evident in the competition for his services. Despite offers of a fief, Confucius returned to Wei, where he advised on succession matters. The King of Wu's appearance in Lu and Confucius' disciple's successful mediation highlighted his influence.|"[""1.

During ancient times, Confucius and Tsz-ch'an of Cheng were renowned philosophers. Tsz-ch'an, known for his legal expertise and care for the people, focused on the immediate welfare of his state during times of crisis. In contrast, Confucius aimed at reviving the imperial system and rituals. After the Han dynasty's rise, Confucius was revered for his system's stability and peace. Lao-tsz, a contemporary of Confucius, emphasized democracy, equality, and simplicity, contrasting Confucius' focus on rituals. Lao-tsz's teachings were popularized in the second century B.C., influencing many statesmen and even the Empress. The scarcity of historical records about Lao-tsz's life raises questions, but his democratic ideals and influence on subsequent generations are well-documented.|"[""1.

"In ancient times, consulting oracles was a common practice worldwide. Statesmen referred to interpretations of mystic signs or diagrams from the ""Changes"" for guidance. The Chinese, like many others, believed in the significance of these signs. Confucius himself spent years studying these mysteries without full comprehension, showing the complexity of the oracles. The ""Changes"" were developed during the time of the Warrior King's imprisonment and were considered essential literature. Augury involved examining tortoise shell markings for omens, influencing decisions like battles and capital relocations. Astrology was also used for predictions, such as the rise and fall of states. Despite these practices, some, like Shuh Hiang, questioned the validity of astrology, emphasizing the importance of leadership qualities over celestial signs."|"['1.

In ancient China, rulers often sought omens to guide their decisions. Tsz-ch'an of Cheng, however, believed in doing his best and leaving the rest to fate. In one instance, two snakes fought outside the city gates, foretelling the return of an exiled duke. In another state, Lu, children sang about thrushes and rulers being abroad, hinting at political upheavals. The state of Ts'u consulted oracles before expeditions, showing respect for heavenly decrees. In Ts'u, a prince cleverly used oracles to save his life. These stories highlight the importance of omens and prophecies in ancient Chinese politics, where even calamities were sought to be transferred to others. The personal nature of wars and conflicts between states also shaped historical events, with trivial disputes leading to significant consequences.|"[""1.

During ancient times in China, when rulers held absolute power, their actions were often seen as sanctioned by the gods. For instance, in 632, the ruler of Ts'ao faced consequences for mistreating the Second Protector, who later sought revenge by redistributing territories. Similarly, in 630, Ts'in and Tsin sought to avenge personal slights by attacking Cheng, but diplomatic efforts prevented a conflict. The respect for rulers was evident in various incidents, like when a Tsin captain spared the disguised Ts'i ruler during a pursuit. Even in battle, there were rules of conduct, as seen when the Tsin generalissimo refrained from attacking the King of Ts'u's bodyguard upon recognizing royalty. Despite the belief in divine mandates, some philosophers like Yen-tsz emphasized personal responsibility over blind loyalty to rulers.|"[""1.

In 536 B.C., Tsz-ch'an, a respected statesman in Ancient China, decided to introduce a new Criminal Law to the people. This was a significant change from the previous practice where rulers and officials decided laws on a case-by-case basis. During this era, leaders from different regions visited each other, often accompanying their ruling prince. The Emperor, although still respected, had limited power compared to these regional princes. Shuh Hiang, a minister from a neighboring state, expressed concerns about this legal reform. He believed that written laws might make people less respectful of authority and more likely to challenge the law. He argued that in the past, wise leadership and personal example were more effective in maintaining order. Shuh Hiang warned that introducing written laws could lead to increased disputes, corruption, and the potential downfall of the state.|"[""1.

During the ancient times in China, statesmen and philosophers engaged in diplomatic missions and negotiations. In 539 B.C., Yen-tsz from the Ts'i state visited Tsin to discuss a political marriage. Premier Han K'i of Tsin accepted the offer through his minister Shuh Hiang. The diplomatic relations among Chinese states were intriguing, with intellectual leaders ruling and Confucius having personal connections with many. Shuh Hiang and Yen-tsz conversed about the state of Ts'i, where the people suffered due to the neglect of the prince and the rising influence of the CH'ÊN family. They discussed economic disparities, corruption, and the need for reform. Shuh Hiang also lamented the degeneration of Tsin's ruling house, highlighting issues of military unpreparedness, social inequality, and wasteful palace spending. The dialogue reflects the political and social challenges faced by ancient Chinese states.|"[""1.

The Tsin ruling house is in decline, with only the Sheepstongue clan remaining from the original eleven. Confucius believed that Tsin's fate was sealed due to their abandonment of ancient laws. In 513 B.C., two Tsin generals sought iron from the Luh-hun reservation to cast a punishment tripod. Confucius criticized this move, stating that Tsin's focus should be on maintaining ancestral laws to uphold respect and order. Around 546 B.C., a proposal for disarmament was made during a conference involving various Chinese states. Despite initial reluctance, the states eventually agreed to the proposal to avoid losing favor with other powers. This historical event highlights the importance of unity and cooperation among states to prevent conflict and maintain stability.|"['1.

The notable Peace Conference marked the end of a 72-year-long series of wars between Tsin and Ts'in, with additional conflicts involving Tsin and Ts'u. Surprisingly, the Emperor's representative, akin to the Pope's role in Europe, was absent from the Conference. Despite this, the Great Powers maintained the facade of honoring the Emperor with precedence, investiture, and tribute presentations when it suited their interests.
