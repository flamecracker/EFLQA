It was in the Declaration of Independence that this name was first and formally proclaimed to the world, and to maintain its verity the war of the Revolution was fought. Americans like to think that they were then assuming ""among the Powers of the Earth the equal and independent Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them""; and, in view of their subsequent marvelous development, they are inclined to add that it must have been before an expectant world.In these days of prosperity and national greatness it is hard to realize that the achievement of independence did not place the United States on a footing of equality with other countries and that, in fact, the new state was more or less an unwelcome member of the world family.

The new republic, the United States, faced a pivotal moment when negotiating peace with Great Britain after the Revolutionary War. The war had effectively ended with Cornwallis' surrender in 1781, but Britain hesitated to acknowledge the colonies' independence. However, the Americans stood firm, demanding recognition as free and sovereign states. France played a crucial role in supporting the colonies during the war, driven by its own interests in regaining European supremacy. Spain, brought into the conflict by France, sought territorial gains that conflicted with American interests. Despite external pressures, American Peace Commissioners, led by Benjamin Franklin, acted independently to secure the nation's best interests. Franklin's diplomatic skills and commitment to liberty were instrumental in navigating the complexities of international relations during this critical period.|"[""1.

John Adams, the American representative in The Hague, was the initial Commissioner appointed. He was to be the sole commissioner for peace negotiations in 1779, but the French Minister added others to the commission. Adams, a sturdy New Englander, was honest but lacked tact. He was suspicious of the French and disapproved of Franklin. Alongside Adams, John Jay, a tall and slender man of prominence, was active in the negotiations. Adams stayed in The Hague to finalize a commercial treaty with the Netherlands. Franklin started informal negotiations in Paris but called Jay from Spain. Jay believed the French were not prioritizing American interests and insisted on direct negotiations with Great Britain. Franklin, admiring the French, was initially hesitant but eventually agreed. The negotiations led to compromises and unresolved issues, but the United States secured territorial rights and fishing privileges in the North Atlantic.|"[""1.

During the peace negotiations after the American Revolution, two challenging issues were the compensation of Loyalists and settling commercial debts. The latter involved paying British creditors by American debtors. Franklin hesitated to make concessions, but Adams and Jay felt differently. They agreed that all bona fide debts should be repaid in full. However, this provision was unenforceable by the U.S. government. The Loyalists, who were loyal to Britain, faced harsh treatment. They were tarred, feathered, and forced to flee their homes. The British sought compensation for their losses. Adams believed paying debts and compensating Loyalists were distinct matters. Eventually, Congress recommended the states consider returning confiscated properties to British subjects and allowed others to return unmolested.|['1.

The American Commissioners showed willingness to compromise, leading to the signing of a preliminary peace treaty on November 30, 1782. Franklin played a vital role in negotiations, using his charm to ease tensions and secure a loan from France. The final peace treaty was signed on September 3, 1783, marking America's entry into the global community. The Revolutionary War did not drastically alter American society; most people returned to their pre-war lives. The economy flourished post-war, with a surplus of goods needing markets. The U.S. relied on foreign trade for manufactured goods, facing challenges due to British trade restrictions. Americans revived the fishing industry but struggled with British trade policies post-Revolution. Despite obstacles, the U.S. aimed to regain access to old markets and boost domestic industries.|"['1.

"European nations viewed American trade as a lucrative opportunity, contributing significantly to Great Britain's prosperity. The United States swiftly engaged in commercial treaties with foreign nations, aiming to legitimize commerce. However, these treaties did not yield substantial outcomes as high import duties and colonial system remnants persisted in European tariffs. Initially, demand for American goods post-war was high, but France and Spain's closure of colonial ports led to exclusion of U.S. shipping. This move proved disastrous for their colonies, prompting France to relax restrictions. British concessions followed, eventually leading to British control over American foreign trade again. The cycle of American trade post-Revolution went through phases of prosperity, depression, and gradual recovery, mirroring internal trade developments. The ""Panic of 1785"" ensued from financial repercussions of a trade revival followed by an influx of imported goods. The confused currency situation exacerbated economic challenges, with various foreign coins circulating and the issuance of paper money by some States worsening the crisis."|"['1.

During the American Revolution, the currency lost value, leading to a rise in prices that the government tried to control. By 1778, Congress gave up on price limits for gold and silver, allowing prices to fluctuate. This led to speculation and the rapid accumulation of wealth by a new financial elite who spent extravagantly. Luxury and European fashions became popular, changing American habits drastically. The drain on money caused debt and economic hardship. Despite the challenges, the foundation of American prosperity remained strong. After the war, the U.S. population was about three million, with a significant number of slaves and immigrants. The upper class still held power, influenced by monarchic traditions. Voting rates were low, reflecting a deferential attitude towards authority.|['1.

Many people neglected to vote, feeling they merely echoed their superiors' will. However, the governing class, despite limited access to magazines and newspapers, engaged in robust intellectual exchanges through correspondence and personal interactions. They found time for thorough reading, contemplation, writing, and socializing. This elite group possessed a profound understanding of governance, particularly evident during the Revolution. When the Crown dissolved legislatures, the colonists maintained governance through congresses and conventions, issuing recommendations for compliance. Some colonies lacked structured governance, prompting the Continental Congress to advise forming temporary governments. Subsequently, each state established independent governments and adopted written constitutions, inspired by the social contract theory. These foundational documents outlined governmental structures and enshrined principles of political ethics and individual rights, reflecting the ideals of democracy and self-governance.|['1.

The government of the people is based on a social contract where citizens agree to be governed by laws for the common good. Cruel laws should be avoided, and no law should inflict harsh punishments. The American Constitution drew inspiration from the English Declaration of Rights but aimed to establish principles for all people in the future. The State Constitutions served as practical tools of governance, continuing the self-government practiced in the colonies. While changes were made to ensure accountability to the people, the overall system remained familiar. The Constitutions reflected a property-owning class, but the opportunity for property ownership was increasingly available to most white men. The gradual changes towards equality and democracy were significant, marking a shift towards a more inclusive society.|['1.

The formation of the State Constitutions in the United States has been a subject of debate, with some viewing them as conservative and aristocratic, while others see them as progressive. Similarly, the concept of union and nationality in the country is a matter of perspective. Some argue that the United States is a collection of independent republics with vast differences, while others see it as a unified nation. The truth likely lies somewhere in between these viewpoints, as historical forces both for and against unity have been at play. Common threats have historically brought the colonies together, such as during the New England Confederation of 1643 and the Albany Congress of 1754. Benjamin Franklin, a strong advocate for union, proposed a plan in 1775 that influenced the development of the Articles of Confederation, which were ratified in 1781. The Articles of Confederation established a loose alliance among the States, emphasizing preparation for action rather than centralized authority.|['1.

The Congress under the Articles of Confederation had extensive powers, such as making decisions on peace and war, treaties, and maintaining an army and navy. However, these powers required consent from nine States, equivalent to a two-thirds vote. Despite Congress's ability to declare war and make treaties, States were not obliged to follow through. The lack of an executive branch meant Congress could appoint committees but not enforce decisions. In judicial matters, Congress served as the final appeal for State disputes. The population of the United States was expanding rapidly due to natural increase and immigration, settling along the coast from Maine to Georgia and gradually moving inland. The issue of western land ownership delayed the Articles' ratification until New York ceded its claim, prompting other States to follow suit. Virginia eventually ceded its land, leading to the final ratification of the Articles of Confederation.|"['1.

The land north and west of the Ohio River, known as the public domain, was a valuable asset for the United States. It was estimated to be around one to two hundred million acres, with an average value of about a dollar per acre. This land was crucial for meeting war debts and covering government expenses, strengthening the Union. Since the early 1600s, European settlers, mainly English, sought to claim and cultivate this vast agricultural land. The desire for land was a significant motive for colonization, rooted in the feudal system of landholding. America was seen as a land of opportunity, where land was abundant and valuable. Many invested in land as a means of wealth accumulation, with figures like George Washington and Patrick Henry engaging in land speculation. The acquisition and settlement of land played a pivotal role in shaping American history and society, driving westward expansion and economic growth.|['1.

Thomas Jefferson, at forty years old, was an extraordinary man who chaired important committees. He was born on the frontier and excelled in both outdoor activities and academics. Jefferson's early life set the stage for his later achievements as a philosopher and politician. He drafted the Declaration of Independence and played a crucial role in shaping American institutions during the Revolution. Jefferson's influence extended to the American land policy, where his efforts led to the establishment of a systematic survey and land sale process. This policy, embodied in the Land Ordinance of 1785, laid the foundation for the American land system, which has endured and been emulated by other nations. Jefferson's contributions to American governance and land policy reflect his deep understanding of the nation's needs and aspirations.|"[""1.

Jefferson, as the chairman of a committee, presented a plan for governing the western territory on March 1, 1784, the same day Virginia's cession was accepted. The plan, known as the Ordinance of 1784, was later adopted with modifications. Jefferson's ordinance, akin to his work on the Declaration of Independence, was a mix of theory and practicality, displaying a keen understanding of past achievements and future needs. The articles of Confederation hinted at expanding the union to include Canada and potentially other colonies. Maryland proposed that Congress define western state boundaries and create new states, a notion accepted by Congress and the states. However, the Ordinance of 1784, while innovative, was never implemented due to various reasons, including objections to the clause on abolishing slavery in new states. The ordinance lacked specific guidelines for creating new governments, leaving local authorities to govern as they pleased until the population grew enough to warrant formal governance.|"['Question 1:\nWhat was the main reason the Ordinance of 1784 was never implemented?\nA) Lack of interest from the western territories\nB) Opposition to the inclusion of Canada in the union\nC) Objections to the clause on abolishing slavery in new states\nD) Lack of support from Congress\nE) Inability to define western state boundaries', ""Question 2:\nHow did Jefferson's plan for governing the western territory resemble his work on the Declaration of Independence?\nA) Both plans focused on expanding the union to include Canada\nB) Both plans lacked specific guidelines for creating new governments\nC) Both plans were never adopted by Congress\nD) Both plans displayed a mix of theory and practicality\nE) Both plans were rejected by Virginia's cession"", 'Question 3:\nWhat did Maryland propose regarding the western state boundaries?\nA) To abolish slavery in new states\nB) To create new states with defined boundaries\nC) To leave local authorities to govern as they pleased\nD) To expand the union to include Canada\nE) To adopt the Ordinance of 1784 without modifications', 'Question 4:\nWhy did the Ordinance of 1784 lack specific guidelines for creating new governments?\nA) Due to objections from local authorities\nB) Because Congress did not support the idea\nC) To allow local authorities to govern as they pleased initially\nD) To focus on expanding the union to include Canada\nE) Because the population in the western territories was too small', ""Question 5:\nWhat was a key factor contributing to the Ordinance of 1784 not being implemented?\nA) Lack of interest from Congress\nB) Inability to define western state boundaries\nC) Opposition to including Canada in the union\nD) Objections to the clause on abolishing slavery in new states\nE) Maryland's proposal to leave local authorities in charge""]"|['C) Objections to the clause on abolishing slavery in new states', 'D) Both plans displayed a mix of theory and practicality', 'B) To create new states with defined boundaries', 'C) To allow local authorities to govern as they pleased initially', 'D) Objections to the clause on abolishing slavery in new states']
In 1789, after much delay, the first seven ranges of townships in the West were surveyed and put up for sale. Prior to this, Congress was working on improving the ordinance for governing the West, with committees and reports being made. The Ohio Company, consisting of Revolutionary War veterans seeking land in the West, played a key role in pushing Congress to action. Led by Manasseh Cutler, the Ohio Company negotiated with Congress to buy a million acres of land at a discounted rate, paying in Revolutionary debt certificates. This negotiation led to the adoption of the Ordinance of 1787, a significant government plan for the Western territories. The ordinance laid out a path for self-governance as the population grew, ultimately allowing new territories to join the Union as equal states.|"[""1.

The Ordinance of 1787, a visionary measure, prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory. This was seen as a step towards the abolition of slavery, although some had ulterior motives. The territory flourished, leading to the admission of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois as states. The incorporation of these territories into the Union was crucial, shaping the nation's growth. By 1850, half the U.S. population lived west of the Alleghany Mountains. The American colonial system, initiated by the Ordinance, played a pivotal role in the country's development. John Fiske highlighted the critical period post-1783, emphasizing the dangers faced. The threat of mutiny among troops at Newburg underscored the challenges of the time. The Ordinance's enduring impact on American history remains unparalleled, setting the stage for the nation's growth and unity.|"['1.

During the aftermath of the American Revolution, the Continental Congress faced challenges in maintaining order and financial stability. Despite the efforts of influential figures like George Washington, discontent among the military led to demonstrations for better treatment and pay. In 1783, soldiers from the Pennsylvania line marched to Philadelphia to demand their dues, causing chaos and embarrassment for Congress. The weak financial position of the Confederation further exacerbated the situation, with Congress struggling to levy taxes or enforce treaties. The inability to address these issues led to a loss of credibility and respect for Congress, as they were unable to effectively govern or secure the nation's interests. The lack of centralized power and financial stability highlighted the weaknesses of the Confederation, ultimately setting the stage for the need to establish a more robust system of governance.|['1.

In 1783, Congress tried to fix the financial crisis with the Revenue Amendment. This plan aimed to impose specific duties on certain goods and a general 5% duty on all others for 25 years. They also wanted to raise $1,500,000 annually from requisitions, based on population and counting slaves as three-fifths. However, only two states fully accepted the plan, seven agreed partially, and four did nothing. Despite Congress' urgent appeals, only New York refused the proposed impost, causing the plan to fail. Congress had to resort to issuing paper money, but its value quickly plummeted. The situation worsened as states issued more worthless paper money, leading to chaos like in Rhode Island. The crisis peaked in Shays' Rebellion in Massachusetts in 1786, with differing opinions on its causes.|"['1.

The unrest in Massachusetts in 1786 stemmed from economic hardship following the war. Debt repayment demands coupled with heavy taxes led to a rebellion against the courts. Led by Daniel Shays, the insurgents clashed with Governor James Bowdoin's forces. Despite a disorderly retreat due to harsh winter conditions, the rebels regrouped in Springfield. General Benjamin Lincoln's arrival crushed their attempt to seize the arsenal. The rebellion was quelled, but the fear of further uprisings loomed. Similar disturbances in other states garnered support for the Massachusetts insurgents. While Congress hesitated to intervene directly, the rebellion's suppression led to a conservative push for reform. The aftermath highlighted Congress's inefficacy and the need for change.|"['1.

During the late 1700s in the United States, trade played a vital role in the nation's prosperity. Although the economy was on the rise, many people were unaware of this improvement due to slow communication and the challenges of the time. The American people, heavily reliant on agriculture and extractive industries, needed markets to sell their goods. With interstate trade facing obstacles, the need for foreign markets became crucial. The restrictions on trade with the West Indies by the British government added to the economic struggles, leading to calls for trade agreements to boost the nation's economy. The idea of retaliation in foreign policy emerged, aiming to open markets for American products. In 1784, Congress recommended granting powers to protect commerce, emphasizing its importance for the nation's wealth and prosperity. The inability of individual states to work together highlighted the necessity for a stronger federal government to address trade issues effectively.|"['Question 1: What was a significant challenge faced by the American people in the late 1700s?\nA) Lack of natural resources\nB) Slow communication\nC) Overabundance of foreign markets\nD) Strong federal government support\nE) Abundance of trade agreements', ""Question 2: Why did the American people need foreign markets for their goods?\nA) To reduce their reliance on agriculture\nB) To increase restrictions on trade with the West Indies\nC) To boost the nation's economy\nD) To establish stronger interstate trade\nE) To limit the powers granted to protect commerce"", 'Question 3: What added to the economic struggles of the American people in the late 1700s?\nA) Lack of trade agreements\nB) Overabundance of foreign markets\nC) Restrictions on trade with the West Indies by the British government\nD) Strong federal government support\nE) Decrease in reliance on extractive industries', 'Question 4: What was the aim of the idea of retaliation in foreign policy that emerged in the late 1700s?\nA) To reduce reliance on agriculture\nB) To open markets for American products\nC) To increase restrictions on trade with the West Indies\nD) To limit the powers granted to protect commerce\nE) To establish stronger interstate trade', ""Question 5: What did Congress recommend in 1784 to protect commerce and emphasize its importance for the nation's wealth and prosperity?\nA) Increase restrictions on trade with the West Indies\nB) Limit the powers granted to protect commerce\nC) Reduce reliance on agriculture\nD) Grant powers to protect commerce\nE) Establish stronger interstate trade"", 'Question 6: What did the inability of individual states to work together highlight in the late 1700s?\nA) Lack of trade agreements\nB) Strong federal government support\nC) Overabundance of foreign markets\nD) Necessity for a stronger federal government to address trade issues effectively\nE) Decrease in reliance on extractive industries']"|"['B) Slow communication', ""C) To boost the nation's economy"", 'C) Restrictions on trade with the West Indies by the British government', 'B) To open markets for American products', 'D) Grant powers to protect commerce', 'D) Necessity for a stronger federal government to address trade issues effectively']"
"This action was deemed unconstitutional, as noted by James Madison, who highlighted instances where the central authority was violated. However, the public's attention was diverted by the paper money issue during that time. The men involved seemed keen on avoiding publicity. Their intentions were revealed in a letter by Monsieur Louis Otto, the French Chargé d'Affaires, to the Comte de Vergennes.

In 1787, delegates from various States met in Philadelphia to address the flaws in the Federal Government. They proposed a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation and improve the Federal Constitution. The goal was to strengthen the union and ensure effective governance. Delegates arrived from all but two States, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Despite initial delays, New Hampshire eventually joined the Convention. However, Rhode Island chose not to participate. The importance of the Convention was immense, with members understanding the gravity of their task.

Virginia played a crucial role in the Convention, with James Madison, a key member of the Virginia delegation, standing out as a scholar in politics. Washington, on the other hand, was known for his action-oriented approach. Governor Edmund Randolph, with his tall stature and dignified demeanor, led the Virginia delegation. James Wilson of Pennsylvania, a prominent figure, was highly respected for his legal expertise. Gouverneur Morris, also from Pennsylvania, was known for his wit and command of language, although his support for a strong government was sometimes questioned. Benjamin Franklin, though respected, had limited influence due to his failing health. Other notable members included Rufus King and Nathaniel Gorham from Massachusetts, and delegates from South Carolina like John Rutledge and Charles Pinckney. On the opposing side were figures like William Paterson, John Dickinson, Elbridge Gerry, and the Connecticut delegates, who were cautious about establishing a powerful government. Their contributions helped shape the final Constitution.|"['1.

Alexander Hamilton, a skilled member of the Convention, held aristocratic views, which clashed with the majority's democratic stance. Despite his radical ideas for a strong government, he lacked support from fellow delegates. Hamilton's efforts were thwarted by colleagues Robert Yates and John Lansing, leading to his diminished role in the Convention. On the other hand, Luther Martin, a Maryland lawyer, faced criticism for his ties to opposing interests and his tedious speaking style. The delegates, a distinguished group mostly from Revolutionary backgrounds, embarked on discussions to revise the Articles of Confederation but were divided over representation issues. The large States favored proportional representation, while the small States sought to maintain equal voting rights. The debate intensified until a compromise was reached, avoiding a potential deadlock. Franklin's proposal for daily prayers to seek divine guidance during the intense discussions was met with hesitation, reflecting the delicate balance of opinions within the Convention.|"['1.

The impact of physical conditions on decision-making is uncertain. During a crucial moment at the Convention, as the committee's compromise was up for approval, the weather changed from hot to cool, creating a more comfortable atmosphere. On July 16th, the significant Constitution compromise was accepted. It included equal State voting in the upper house and population-based representation in the lower house for taxation. The provision that money bills start in the lower house was debated but eventually dropped. The three-fifths rule for counting slaves was not the main feature, but rather a detail. Delegates from large States were disappointed, while those from small States were pleased with equal representation. The committee of five, led by Rutledge, swiftly worked on the constitution's details, combining elements from various plans and State Constitutions.|"['1.

The Convention resumed its meetings on Monday, the 6th of August, and for five weeks, the committee's report was debated. Each day, the delegates worked persistently for five to six hours. In midsummer, only five days were cool, as noted in a member's diary. The Constitution's draft was meticulously reviewed, line by line. Changes in wording played a crucial role in making the Virginia Plan more acceptable. The spirit of compromise prevailed, leading to significant accomplishments. The inefficiency of Congress under the Confederation was a major concern. The new Constitution transferred legislative powers from the Confederation to the Congress of the United States. The powers granted to Congress were limited, with checks and balances in place, including the executive's right of veto. Restrictions on Congress included defining treason, prohibiting export taxes, capitation taxes, and titles of nobility. Compromises were made to address conflicting interests, such as the passage of navigation acts and the importation of slaves.|"[""1.

The weakness of the Confederation was the inability to enforce laws. Even with Congress gaining more power, like using the militia, the issue remained. Experience showed that limiting states' interference with the central government was crucial. The Constitution integrated these restrictions and added more. The judiciary was key, with a Federal Supreme Court established. The power of the courts to nullify laws against the Constitution was implied. The executive branch was a new concept, modeled after state governors. The presidency was born, with fears of monarchy debated.

In late August, after weeks of intense discussions, the delegates at the Convention were weary. The issue of electing the President was causing a rift between large and small States. To resolve this, a committee with one member from each State was formed. This committee proposed a compromise where electors chosen by each State's legislature would vote for two candidates, with one not from their State. The candidate with the most votes would become President if it was a majority. If tied, the Senate would choose from the top five. The House of Representatives would decide in case of no majority. Despite concerns about large States having an advantage, it was believed that most times, the Senate would choose the President. The term was set at four years with the possibility of re-election. The delegates were confident in George Washington as the first President. After some dissension, the Constitution was signed by 39 delegates on September 17th.|['1.

During the Federal Convention, Charles Biddle of Philadelphia expressed his belief that the Constitution established the best government possible. However, many members were not entirely satisfied with the Constitution but agreed it was the best compromise they could reach. The Convention's practical approach aimed to correct known flaws in the Articles of Confederation, using tested political solutions. The Anglo-Saxon tradition of adhering to laws and precedents influenced the American Revolution of 1789. The Constitution was initially meant to revise the Articles of Confederation but evolved into a new form of government. The adoption of the Constitution faced opposition from Anti-Federalists who feared a strong central government might jeopardize individual liberties, while Federalists sought to strengthen national authority to address disorder and economic concerns. This division marked the beginning of the two major national political parties in the United States.|"[""1.

In Philadelphia and nearby areas, there was great excitement about the new Constitution. The Pennsylvania Assembly swiftly proposed a ratifying convention, surprising the Anti-Federalists. To prevent the vote, they left the Assembly, causing a quorum issue. An angry crowd dragged two absentees to ensure a vote. The State convention was ordered, leading to celebrations with church bells ringing. Pennsylvania's ratification was followed by Delaware and New Jersey, both unanimous. Georgia and Connecticut also ratified quickly. Massachusetts faced a tough decision due to divided opinions, with Governor John Hancock and Samuel Adams playing crucial roles. Ultimately, Massachusetts ratified the Constitution with a slim majority, demanding nine amendments.

The Constitution faced challenges in various states, with Virginia and New York being crucial. In Virginia, the debate was intense, with influential figures like Washington and Madison supporting it. The division was evident, with figures like Patrick Henry and George Mason opposing it. Ultimately, on June 25th, Virginia ratified the Constitution, emphasizing the need to address any imperfections through the prescribed mode rather than risking the Union's safety. In New York, Alexander Hamilton played a pivotal role in swaying sentiment through a series of essays published in newspapers, known as The Federalist. Despite initial Anti-Federalist sentiment, Hamilton's eloquent arguments and news of ratifications from other states led to New York's ratification on July 26th, with a recommendation for future amendments.|['1.

The joy in the country over the successful adoption of the new government was clear. The Fourth of July was celebrated as a day of independence and the final acceptance of the Constitution. However, North Carolina and Rhode Island were hesitant to join. North Carolina almost rejected the Constitution in July 1789 but postponed the decision. Eventually, by November 1789, North Carolina ratified the Constitution due to pressure from the new government. Rhode Island resisted until May 1790 when threatened with commercial isolation and debt payment demands. Ellsworth, a Senator, expressed relief when all states finally adopted the Constitution. The objections raised during the conventions seemed trivial, with concerns ranging from fears of monarchy to the construction of a fortified stronghold in the District of Columbia. Despite initial doubts, the Constitution was accepted by all states in the end.|"[""1.

In the late 1700s, public newspapers spread false claims about General Washington and Dr. Franklin, calling them fools and fraudsters. The Constitution was being debated, and some felt it was designed to protect property and government debts. The upper class was seen as the main influence in shaping the Constitution, aiming to safeguard their wealth and investments. Despite accusations, those involved were acting in the public's interest, ensuring property rights were upheld. The new government was established in 1789, marking a significant moment in American history. The success of this government depended on public support and the people's willingness to make it work. Washington believed that with hard work and frugality, the new government would bring prosperity and security to the nation.

The new Federal Government started at a fortunate time when the people were feeling positive about it due to the improving economy. Washington's inauguration marked a new era for the United States. The Declaration of Independence emphasized that all men are created equal, with rights to life, liberty, and happiness. It stated that governments derive power from the people and can be changed if they fail to secure these rights. The Declaration listed grievances against the British King, leading to the decision to break ties and become independent. The document was a bold statement by the United Colonies to become Free and Independent States, ready to engage in war, peace, and international relations as sovereign entities.|"[""1.

Section 5 states that the governor and judges, or a majority of them, must adopt and publish laws from the original States that are necessary and suitable for the district's circumstances. These laws will be in effect until the general assembly is organized unless disapproved by Congress. Afterward, the legislature can modify them. The governor is the commander-in-chief of the militia and appoints officers below the rank of general officers. General officers are appointed by Congress. Section 7 mentions that before the general assembly is formed, the governor appoints magistrates and civil officers for each county or township to maintain peace. Once the assembly is established, it regulates the powers and duties of these officers. The laws apply throughout the district, and the governor divides it for executing processes. Once there are 5,000 free male inhabitants, they can elect representatives for the general assembly. Each representative serves for two years, and in case of death or removal, a replacement is elected. The general assembly consists of the governor, legislative council, and house of representatives. The council has five members appointed by Congress and the house of representatives. They have the authority to make laws for the district's governance, subject to the governor's approval. The governor can convene, prorogue, and dissolve the general assembly as needed. All appointed officers must take an oath of fidelity and office.

Albert Rosenthal, a renowned artist, created etchings of historical figures like Charles Pinckney and Pierce Butler in 1888. Pinckney's portrait was painted by Col. John Trumbull in 1791 and is now at the Yale School of Fine Arts. Another portrait of Pinckney by Gilbert Stuart was cherished by his family in South Carolina.
