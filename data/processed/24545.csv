This collection of animal tales for kids aged three to eight recounts the escapades of woodland and field creatures in a delightful manner that captivates young readers. Among the farm animals, some felt envious of the Muley Cow, a favorite of Johnnie Green. The neighboring red cow often grumbled about the treats Johnnie spoiled the Muley Cow with, like potatoes, apples, and carrots. The other cow, a white one, also yearned for these goodies. Despite their jealousy, they treated the Muley Cow respectfully since she was the oldest and an aunt to them. Johnnie displayed his fondness by feeding her treats and grooming her, much like he did with the elderly horse, Ebenezer. The Muley Cow cherished these gestures, especially during winter when she was confined in the barn. In contrast, during summer in the pasture, she could groom herself with her long tongue or seek assistance from distant barn companions to avoid their snide comments. Johnnie's attachment to the Muley Cow stemmed from her being a gift from Farmer Green, though the Muley Cow humorously claimed that Johnnie belonged to her.|"['1.

Johnnie, eager to prove himself, set off with Spot the dog earlier than usual. The cows grumbled as Johnnie hurried them along. At the barn, Johnnie awkwardly attempted to milk the Muley Cow, under his father's watchful eye. Despite some mishaps, the Muley Cow remained patient.

The Muley Cow often heard the noisy crows gossiping about the limp gentleman on a stick beyond the fence. One day, she decided to taste the tempting corn shoots. Politely, she greeted the scarecrow before helping herself to the corn. The scarecrow, despite his tattered appearance, tried to acknowledge her. As the wind wasn't strong enough to let him tip his hat, the Muley Cow playfully danced around him. Suddenly, she heard shouts and barking, realizing Farmer Green had caught her in the cornfield. Feeling uneasy about the scarecrow, she hurried back to the barnyard, convinced that his gentlemanly nature would have warned her if he could.|"[""1.

Johnnie Green discovered that owning a cow wasn't all fun. Sometimes he wished his father or the hired man could milk the cow, especially when friends came by or he had to run errands. The cow, unfazed by the changes, wandered off to find better grass. When it was time to bring the cows back, Johnnie always searched for the Muley Cow first. If she was missing, he knew she was in the back pasture. Johnnie learned to make work fun by turning it into a game. He practiced lassoing the cow and became quite skilled. Eventually, he grew tired of the game and thought about lassoing her from his horse, but he wasn't sure if his father would approve. One day in the back pasture, as Johnnie picked blackberries, he daydreamed about adventures with real buffaloes and Indians.|"['1.

The Muley Cow found Spot's behavior odd and suspected he was afraid of a woodchuck. She chuckled at the thought and planned to share the news with the herd. Johnnie Green, unaware of the Cow's departure, encountered a bear in the thicket. Startled by the bear's growl, Johnnie ran, even stumbling once but quickly regaining his footing. The Muley Cow, typically fence-averse, leaped back into the pasture without waiting for Johnnie to lower the bars. Spot and Johnnie followed suit, racing downhill, through a raspberry patch, and across a brook until they reached Johnnie's father in the hay field. The trio exchanged sheepish glances, unaware that the bear, Cuffy, had fled to Blue Mountain, fearing the encounter with the odd group. The cows and woodchucks shared a unique relationship, with the woodchucks often gossiping about the cows without their knowledge.|"['1.

"Both ladies chuckled at the mention of Ferdinand Frog. While they laughed, Mrs. Woodchuck's son, Billy, snuck a carrot from Aunt Polly's stash. ""Where's your poke?"" Aunt Polly asked. She noticed a large wooden collar on the Muley Cow with a stake in front. Aunt Polly explained they wanted to see the poke as she always wore one in summer. The Muley Cow had the poke to prevent her from jumping the fence. Mr. Crow enjoyed teasing the Muley Cow and returned after breakfast. Some cows sympathized with her, while others made unkind remarks. Despite the teasing, the Muley Cow pretended the poke didn't bother her.

The Muley Cow felt a mix of emotions as the cowbirds teased her for not wanting to talk. Despite feeling glum, she managed a smile when they didn't mention her tail poke. The cowbirds, known for their impoliteness, ate all the flies around her and abruptly left. The song sparrow warned the Muley Cow about the cowbirds, calling them outcasts who lay eggs in other birds' nests. Although she was skeptical, the Muley Cow decided to distance herself from the cowbirds.

Johnnie Green had a hunch that the Muley Cow disliked the wooden poke around her neck. He persuaded his father to remove it, giving the cow a sense of freedom. Without the poke, she joyfully pranced in the pasture like a young calf. Although tempted to jump the fence, she remembered the consequence of wearing the poke and chose to behave. She relished the clover and quenched her thirst in the brook. Unexpectedly, Tommy Fox approached her, asking for a favor.

Turkey Proudfoot's tail drooped and he forgot to strut upon hearing the message, shaking slightly as if frightened. The Muley Cow was astonished when he started gobbling at her, wondering how he knew it was Tommy Fox. She assumed Tommy Fox had a pleasant surprise planned, but Turkey Proudfoot seemed angry. He even avoided roosting in the tree and squeezed into the henhouse, ignoring the hens' protests. Meanwhile, Billy Woodchuck kept sneaking into the clover-patch, growing plumper each time. The Muley Cow scolded him, but he continued his visits. When she suggested putting a poke on him, everyone laughed except her. She thought it was silly and blamed his clover-eating for his behavior.

The Muley Cow realized she had wasted words on Billy Woodchuck, who wasn't frightened at all. She knew he would sneak into the clover-patch to nibble on the red tops.

The Muley Cow always felt a sense of joy whenever she saw old dog Spot around. However, her mood drastically changed when she encountered Master Meadow Mouse alone in the pasture. She would bellow at him in a gruff tone, demanding to know why he was there. Each time she coughed, the mouse would scurry away before she could say anything fierce. On their next encounter, she tried to intimidate him by stamping her feet, but he stood frozen in fear. This reaction made the cow uneasy. Despite her attempts to appear fierce, she struggled to come up with harsh words. When she realized that the mouse knew about her embarrassing incident with an apple, she felt ashamed and asked him to leave, though her voice lacked any real menace. Her companions shared her sentiments, but Farmer Green and his son saw the milking machine as a positive addition, unaware of the herd's disapproval.|"['1.

The experienced hired man, who claimed to have milked millions of cows, expressed his disdain for the early morning chore to Johnnie.
