On July 5th, 1804, we embarked early in the morning and journeyed along the riverbank where an old village once stood. We crossed some challenging sandbars and pondered the mystery of the village's origins. The French officer, M. de Bourgmont, visited this village in 1724 when the nation was numerous and friendly towards the French. Contrary to Mr. Du Pratz's account, we encountered no reeds or canes. The day was eventful, with the boat navigating tricky sandbars and a raft of driftwood. We camped by a small creek and marveled at the landscape. The next day, July 6th, we set out early again, passing sandbars and islands, noting the peculiar sweating of the men in the Missouri heat. The river's twists and turns revealed prairies and narrow channels, keeping us alert. On July 7th, we faced swift waters and stunning prairies, feeling the sun's intensity.

On July 15th, 1804, during a storm, two perogus found themselves in a similar situation as a boat about half a mile above. The wind shifted to the southeast, and they sailed past a small island on the south side where they dined and spent two hours examining their arms. Continuing upstream, they passed a small trading fort on the south side where Mr. Bennet of St. Louis traded with the Otteaus & Panies two years prior. One of the explorers went ashore to hunt elk but only managed to fire at one without success. The boat passed the lower part of a large island on the south side, with a large creek called Neesh-nah-ba-to-na running into the river, nearly as large as the Mine River. The area was rich with wild Timothy, lambs-quarter, and various berries. They camped opposite the large island on the left side, where several men were unwell. The river had a slight fall.|['1.

In July 1804, during the Lewis and Clark expedition, various instruments were used for navigation and observation. An Octant with a radius of 14 inches and a nonius for precise measurements was employed for both fore and back observations. An Artificial Horizon using water as a reflecting surface was favored for bright objects but not suitable for dim ones like the moon. Another Horizon using glass was used for brighter reflections. A Chronometer was carefully wound daily and found to be slightly slow. A Circumferentor aided in determining magnetic azimuths and traverses. The explorers mapped the Missouri River with these tools, marking points with red ink. Camp activities included hunting, flag raising, and map copying. The men encountered a white catfish with unique features.|['1.

At 6 o'clock this evening, Labieche, one of the party sent to the Ottoes, joined and informed that the party was delayed due to one of the deserters, M.B. Reed, and the three principal chiefs of the nations. La Liberty was caught, but he managed to escape. The chiefs' objective in approaching is to negotiate peace with the Mahars through us. Since the Mahars are not present, the plan to bring them and the Soues by setting the prairies on fire was initiated as a signal. The morning of August 18, 1804, was pleasant. Jo. Fields was dispatched to fetch the party from the Ottoes who did not arrive the previous night. The wind was from the southeast. Later in the day, the party arrived, and after a brief conversation, provisions were provided, and Reed was tried. He confessed to desertion and theft, leading to a punishment of running the gauntlet four times. The chiefs also discussed the cause of war between them and the Mahars. Further discussions were postponed to the next day. A dance was held until 11 o'clock to celebrate Captain Lewis' birthday.|"[""1.

On August 20, 1804, during an exchange with Native American chiefs, the group gave small gifts and tobacco to show goodwill. However, a certificate given to the Big Blue Eyes chief was taken back due to their intentions being misunderstood. Despite initial displeasure, the chiefs later requested the certificate back, which was granted after a plausible excuse was made. The group then shared a drink, showed the Indians curiosities and an air gun. Unfortunately, Sergeant Floyd fell very ill and passed away, receiving a proper burial with military honors. The group then continued their journey, facing windy weather and discovering a fruit similar to red currants. The day ended with a beautiful evening camp by the river.|"['1.

On August 22nd, 1804, the expedition set out early with a south wind. A new member, G. Shannon, joined the boat. They observed a bluff on the left side of the river containing various minerals like Pyrites, alum, and Copperass. Captain Lewis almost got poisoned by a substance believed to be arsenic or Cobalt. They saw a creek called Roloje with abundant minerals. Captain Lewis took a dose of salts to counteract the effects. The next day, on August 23rd, they continued their journey, encountering elk and wolves. The wind blew hard, creating sand clouds. Captain Lewis and men brought a buffalo to the boat. They camped on the left side above a sand island, where they spotted an elk, which Shields shot.|['1.

On the 24th of August in the year 1804, a rainy night followed by a morning of rain greeted the expedition. They continued their journey, observing the blue clay bluffs rising about 180 to 190 feet high on the left side of the river. These bluffs had experienced recent fires, making the ground too hot to touch. The area showed signs of coal and cobalt deposits. Along the hillside, a type of fruit similar to currents but larger and more flavorful grew abundantly. The explorers hunted deer and elk, with the French boy and servant accompanying them. Legends spoke of a hill believed to be inhabited by small, devil-like creatures with large heads, feared by nearby tribes. Despite the rain, their adventures continued, uncovering unique landscapes and wildlife.|['1.

On the 25th of August in 1804, Captain Lewis and I set out with a group of men to explore a mound that intrigued many Native American tribes in the area. The mound, known as the Mountain of Little People or Spirits, is located about nine miles from the mouth of White Stone Creek. It rises about 65 to 70 feet with a level plain on top. The hill's regular shape made us wonder if it was man-made, but its composition resembled the nearby terrain, suggesting it was a natural formation. The hill's isolation from other hills is unusual, and its location attracts many birds and insects due to the wind patterns in the open plains. From the top of the mound, we enjoyed a stunning view of the landscape, with herds of buffalo grazing in the distance. We also observed various bird species like blackbirds and larks in the vast plains. The surrounding area was open, treeless, and teeming with wildlife.|"['1.

On August 26th, 1804, Sergeant Patric Gass was appointed by the commanding officers to take charge of Sergeant Floyd's mess in the corps of volunteers for North Western Discovery. Sergeant Gass was praised for his previous faithful service and was expected to continue his duties diligently. The next day, on August 27th, the expedition encountered various challenges. A member of the party couldn't find Shannon or the horses, leading to a search party being sent out. They observed interesting geological formations and encountered Native American tribes along the river. Despite some setbacks, the group continued their journey, facing strong winds and health issues. By August 28th, the crew faced more obstacles, including an unfit boat that had to be replaced. Despite these challenges, they persevered on their exploration of the river.|"[""1.

On September 1st, 1804, the explorers faced hard winds and rain. The river was wide with hills on each side. They passed a large island made of sand covered with cottonwood trees. They landed at the lower point of a big island named Bon Homme. Captain Lewis and Clark went out to see a beaver house but couldn't find it. They returned after nightfall with an elk and a beaver. The river was full of catfish, caught easily at any time. The next day, September 2nd, was cold and rainy. The explorers killed four elk and prepared the meat. They observed bear grass and rue on the hills. The high land on the south side was uneven, while the north side was level with a yellow clay bluff. On September 3rd, they set out early to a bluff near Plumb Creek, where they found delicious plums and grapes. They camped at the edge of a plain and saw signs of Shannon and Colter ahead.|"['1.

On September 11, 1804, the explorers set out early on a cloudy morning. The river was wide and shallow, crowded with sandbars. They passed several islands, one of which had a village of barking squirrels. A man who had been separated from the group for 22 days due to lack of food joined them, nearly starving. The group camped above a run, enduring a hard rain. The next day, they faced great difficulty passing sandbars due to swift and shallow water. The explorers camped near a village of barking prairie squirrels. The following day, they continued on a dark, drizzly day, catching beavers and encountering muskeeters.

On September 15th, 1804, during their exploration, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark encountered heavy rain that washed mud from the hills into the river. They observed how the grassless parts of the hills easily dissolved into the water, contributing to the mud at the river bottoms. The riverbanks eroded, mixing mud with the water. They camped near a creek and noted an animal with unique features: the animal had flexible ears, a white and brown fur, and a blunted, white tail. It was smaller and longer than a rabbit, with the ability to run swiftly and leap great distances. The explorers also encountered various wildlife like rabbits and deer, providing them with provisions for their journey. Their observations helped them understand the environment they were exploring.|"['1.

On September 16, 1804, the explorers continued their journey, camping in a beautiful plain surrounded by trees. They needed to dry wet items and clothes and decided to load the Perogue instead of sending it back due to shallow water. They also made observations for longitude. Two men joined them, reporting the river's appearance and wildlife. The area between the river and White River had abundant wildlife like deer, buffaloes, and wolves. They spent the day cleaning and loading the boats. Captain Lewis and others hunted deer and buffaloes for skins. Observing pine burs and birch sticks in the driftwood, they noted a potential town site near the mouth of White River. The next day, September 17, Captain Lewis explored the country between the river and Corvus Creek, encountering diverse wildlife like antelopes and buffaloes. The landscape was rich with plains and hills, offering a stunning view of nature's beauty.|['1.

On January 13, 1805, a cold and clear day, a great number of Indians went down the river to hunt and killed many buffalo near their villages. They preserved a large portion of the meat as their custom of making this food a staple leaves them without meat for more than half the time. The Mandan nation passed by to hunt on the river below, accompanied by Mr. Chabonee, our interpreter. Some of them returned frostbitten. The next day, January 14, more Indians, including men, women, children, and dogs, joined those who had passed the day before. On January 15, between 12 and 3 in the morning, a total eclipse of the moon occurred. The weather was not as cold as the previous day, and four Minnetaree men visited us.

On the 3rd of February 1805, our meat supplies were running low. I decided to travel down the river on the ice to hunt. With 16 men, 3 horses, and 2 sleds, we journeyed about 60 miles. We killed and loaded the horses with game, built pens filled with meat, and returned on the 13th. During this time, we hunted 40 deer, 3 bulls, and 19 elk. Many were so thin they were not fit for consumption. The following day, February 4, the weather was cold with the thermometer at 18° below zero. Captain Clark led a hunting party to find more meat as our supplies were nearly depleted. On February 5, we were visited by natives who traded corn for services. They had a unique battle ax made of thin iron, which I found inconvenient. The natives were attached to this ax despite its flaws. The 6th of February brought fair weather, and we prepared for the return of the hunting party. Shields killed three antelopes, and the blacksmiths traded corn for their labor.

On February 9, 1805, a man named Howard caused trouble by scaling the fort's walls instead of calling the guard to open the gate. He was an old soldier, making his offense more serious. The next day, it was cold and windy, with a snowfall. Despite the temperature being higher than the previous day, the strong wind made it feel colder. On February 11, Charbono's wife gave birth to a baby boy, the first child she had. A remedy involving rattlesnake rattles was used to help with the birth. The morning of February 12 was cold, and the horses brought back by Charbono were fatigued and preferred eating cottonwood bark. The horses were used for hunting and transportation, surviving on meager food. Later that evening, the hunting party returned with a meager catch due to wolves taking a share.

On March 31, 1805, the explorers witnessed seven groups of geese and ducks flying up the river. The day was cloudy, with minimal ice floating downstream. Few Indians visited, but the team remained in high spirits, often dancing and enjoying each other's company. They were generally healthy, except for venereal complaints, common among the natives. On April 1, 1805, thunder, lightning, hail, and rain marked the first significant rainfall since October. The team prepared to set off, loading two perogues and six canoes with provisions. The next day, they continued their preparations, packing articles to be sent to the President of the United States. By April 7, 1805, everything was ready for departure, with arrangements made for the crew and dispatches to be sent back to St. Louis. The team consisted of a diverse group of individuals, eager and harmonious, embarking on a journey into uncharted territory.|['1. What did the explorers witness on March 31, 1805?\nA.

On April 7, 1805, a Chief of the Ricara tribe visited Fort Mandan seeking support against the Sioux who were causing trouble. The Chief was given gifts and a certificate for his good conduct. They agreed to allow 3000 w of skins on their boat for protection. On the same day, a boat with soldiers and Frenchmen left for St. Louis while another party with Lewis and Clark set out on canoes and perogues up the river. The group included various individuals like hunters, interpreters, and soldiers. The journey was slow due to strong winds. The next day, they encountered a canoe in distress losing supplies, including powder. Despite the setback, they continued their journey, passing villages where locals gathered to see them off. The Chief of the Mandans gifted Clark with a pair of mockersons before they camped for the night.|"[""1.

On April 9th, 1805, during their journey, Lewis and Clark encountered various wildlife and geological formations. They observed a unique type of bird, the Brant, with some being white with black feathers on their wings. Lewis also described an animal resembling a Prairie Dog but smaller. They passed by Indian hunting camps and noted the blooming of trees like Maple and Elm. The landscape featured hills with coal strata and hillsides covered in juniper. They saw geese feeding in the prairies and flowers blooming. The expedition camped in a beautiful elevated plain by the river, surrounded by rocks. Lewis and Clark's detailed observations and encounters with nature enriched their exploration of the unknown territories.|"['1.

On April 10, 1805, the expedition set out early in the morning. They encountered Minetares on the river shore who were curious about their fleet. Captain Clark explored the area on foot, spotting antelopes, geese, and swans. Mosquitoes were bothersome. The landscape was flat with no trees in sight, except in sheltered spots. They met French trappers who had caught 12 beavers. The hunters planned to join the expedition for safety. The explorers camped on the starboard side near a bend in the river. The next day, April 11, they continued their journey, hunting for fresh meat. They saw white cranes and killed two geese. The hills showed signs of burnt areas with coal-like substances. They also encountered a group of Minetares on horseback.|['1. What did Captain Clark spot while exploring the area on foot?\nA) Bears\nB) Antelopes\nC) Wolves\nD) Lions\nE) Elephants', '2.

On Friday, April 12, 1805, we started our journey early in the morning. Our boat and canoes crossed to the left side of the river to avoid a collapsing bank on the right. Surprisingly, the red boat managed to pass under the bank using a rope, which worried me at first. The men couldn't reboard once the boat started, so they proceeded up the bank safely. We traveled six miles and stopped on the lower side of the Little Missouri River to make celestial observations. Ten hunters were sent out to get fresh meat, and one of them, George Drewyer, caught a beaver. The night was too cloudy for further observations. We found small onions in the area and cooked them, finding them tasty. The little Missouri River is difficult to navigate due to its rapids, shoals, and sandbars. It originates west of the Black Hills and joins the Missouri River 1693 miles from its confluence with the Mississippi. The land around the river is broken, with little timber but fertile soil. The water and appearance of the river resemble the Missouri. The day ended with interesting discoveries and observations.|['1.

On April 13th, 1805, while exploring the river, I encountered a hilly country with black soil mixed with some sand. I came across various wildlife like Hares, Magpies, Grouse, Field Larks, and Crows. I also noticed the leaves of wild Cherry trees and many flowers in the plains. The wind picked up, and we faced a sudden squall in the afternoon, causing some chaos with our canoes. Luckily, we managed to secure everything and avoid a disaster. We saw beavers and hunted Antelopes, but the highlight was the encounter with enormous tracks of white bears along the shore. The Native Americans fear these beasts and only engage them in large groups due to their strength and ferocity. Despite the dangers, we pressed on, eager to explore more of this wild and untamed land.|['1.

On April 13, 1805, the expedition started at 6 a.m. The Missouri River widened above the Little Missouri, with sandbars. The river's width resembled the Rochejhone River. They caught three beavers and passed a creek with wild onions. The creek was devoid of timber and led to a lake. The area had beautiful plains and remains of abandoned lodges. They camped on the S. S. and saw bald eagles, antelopes, and geese. The next day, an otter was spotted, and a lost dog joined them. They noted mineral deposits and Indian lodges. The Assinniboins were known for trading with British establishments. The expedition encountered burrowing squirrels, killed an elk, and saw white bears. Geese nested in trees, and magpies were observed. A large hooting owl was also encountered.|['1. What did the expedition encounter while camping on the S.

On Sunday, April 14, 1805, the explorers encountered a dog they believed was left behind by nearby Native American camps. They spotted lodges made of cottonwood sticks in the bottoms, remnants of Ossinnaboin Indian camps. These Indians were known for using small kegs of liquor. The explorers roamed through wooded bottoms and hills, observing Indian encampments with wide tracks. The Ossinnaboin Indians used buffalo skin tents decorated with porcupine quills and tails. The landscape featured wide bottoms with wood like cottonwood and ash, transitioning to hills with minerals like salt, sulfur, coal, and bituminous water. The Ossinnaboin Indians had recently vacated the area, leaving scarce game. The next day, on April 15, 1805, the explorers continued their journey, encountering geese, deer, and elk. Captain Lewis explored the beautiful, level plains while Captain Clark walked along the river bottoms. They noted streams running to the northeast and observed the remains of Assinniboin camps. The water in the creeks was too mineral-rich to drink, and they camped on a sand point on the left side of the river that evening.|['1.

On April 17, 1805, the explorers encountered vast plains with mineral deposits as they journeyed along the river. Captain Lewis killed two buffalo bulls for food, although they were too thin to eat. They also spotted antelopes, elk herds, white wolves, and various waterfowl. The landscape showed signs of volcanic activity with pumice stone and lava. Later, they faced strong winds but managed to continue their journey. The next day, on April 18, the party caught a beaver and a muskrat. They observed unique vegetation and collected buffalo hair for its wool-like quality. Despite the wind's challenges, they hunted for elk and deer. The explorers camped on the riverbank, where they found old Indian camps and abundant wildlife. The following day, April 19, the wind remained strong, halting their progress. They discovered juniper plants and continued hunting for elk and beaver in the area.|"['1.

On April 21, 1805, the expedition faced a windy day as they journeyed along the Missouri River. Captain Clark decided to walk through the country while observing the vast wildlife, including elk, buffalo, deer, antelopes, geese, ducks, and swans. He hunted and collected a significant amount of meat for the party. The landscape was similar to what they had seen before, with old Indian camps along the river. The winds picked up in the evening, making it challenging to set up camp. The following day, April 22, Captain Lewis and Captain Clark explored the White Earth River, noting its clear waters and the abundance of minerals along its banks. They observed the diverse wildlife and geological features of the area, providing a picturesque view of the vast plains and herds of buffalo. The expedition faced strong headwinds, causing delays and difficulties in navigation. Captain Clark's hunting expedition yielded more game, adding to their food supplies. The winds continued to hinder their progress on April 23, forcing them to seek shelter and dry their wet supplies before continuing their journey.|['1.

On April 23, 1805, a cold morning greeted the explorers as the wind blew fiercely from the northwest. Despite the challenging weather, Captain Clark managed to hunt deer and a buffalo calf. Seeking shelter from the harsh winds, they camped on the south side of the river. The strong winds impeded their progress, making it risky to move forward. The following day, April 24, the winds persisted, preventing them from traveling. Sand carried by the wind caused discomfort, with particles infiltrating everything. The sand even affected their equipment, like pocket watches. On April 25, the wind remained strong, freezing the water on the oars. Despite the adverse conditions, they set out early, only to be forced to stop due to the violent wind. Captain Lewis, accompanied by a few men, ventured overland to scout the Yellowstone River, hoping to expedite their journey.|"['1.

Captain Lewis decided to travel by land towards the Rochejhone or Yellowstone River due to persistent winds hindering their progress. He aimed to conduct celestial observations to determine the river's location without delaying the boats. He departed with four men up the Missouri, while the winds calmed later, allowing the group to continue and camp. On Friday, April 26, 1805, Joseph Fields was sent to explore the Yellowstone River, while others retrieved meat. Captain Lewis and a companion headed down the river to view its confluence with the Missouri, finding it two miles away. They noted the landscape, wildlife, and geological features. Captain Clark measured the rivers' width and depth, and they enjoyed a cheerful evening at the junction of the rivers. Lewis reported on the Yellowstone River's characteristics, including its navigability and surrounding terrain.|"['1.

Captain Lewis joined me in the evening after taking equal altitudes a little way up the Yellowstone River. The country in every direction is plains, except the moist bottoms of the river, which are covered with some indifferent timber such as cottonwood, elm, and small ash, along with different kinds of stubs and bushes in the forks. About one mile from the point where the two rivers are near each other, a beautiful low-level plain commences, extending up the Missouri and back. This plain is narrow at its start and widens as the Missouri bends north, bordered by an extensive woodland for many miles up the Yellowstone River. This low plain is not subject to overflow, appearing a few inches above high water mark, offering a beautiful commanding situation for a fort near the prairie's commencement. About several miles up the Yellowstone River, emence numbers of antelopes, buffalo, elk, deer, and beavers are found. The area is rich in wildlife, providing a picturesque setting for various bird species like the magpie, goose, duck, and eagle, all nesting in the same neighborhood. The Magpie, known for building nests near the eagle, constructs sturdy nests with sticks, thickly covered, providing safe entry and exit points. The low plain extends for some distance up both rivers, showcasing wide and beautiful landscapes. The high plain rises gradually, offering a stunning view of the surrounding countryside.

On April 28, 1805, the explorers had a pleasant day as the river level dropped, and a favorable wind blew from the southeast. Captain Clark explored the land, spotting low plains, and various wildlife like deer, geese, bears, elk, and antelopes. The hills revealed coal deposits and burnt areas. The landscape showed green woodlands and less green plains. On April 29, 1805, they encountered yellow bears, with Lewis describing their differences from black bears. Wolves were abundant and preyed on the meager antelopes. They also saw bighorned animals. The explorers found coal deposits, and they reached a clear river mouth suitable for navigation. The valley was fertile and beautiful, with only a single tree visible along the riverbank.|['1.

On April 29, 1805, Captain Clark and his crew set out in the morning as usual. The wind was moderate from the northeast. Soon, they spotted a female Bighorn animal and her fawn on a bluff. Startled by the noise, the animals moved down the steep bluff. Two men tried to shoot the animals but missed. The crew also encountered a yellow bear, which Captain Lewis killed, and another bear that was wounded. They saw many buffalo, antelopes, elk, and wolves. In the evening, Captain Clark walked on shore and killed a deer. The crew camped by a small river on the south side. The land widened, and they observed more Bighorn animals later.

On May 3, 1805, the expedition started a bit later due to the cold weather. The temperature was 26 degrees above zero, with ice forming near the fire. The snow had melted in low areas but covered the hills. Scarlet pieces found were likely left as sacrifices by Native Americans. They saw a collection of bushes shaped like a fence, possibly an offering. The party spotted various animals like buffalo, elk, deer, and waterfowl. Captain Lewis observed a river, naming it Porcupine, and found it navigable. They camped near the river. The next day, repairs delayed their departure. The weather improved, and they saw abundant wildlife. Captain Clark explored a lodge and saw signs of bear activity. Joseph Fields fell ill but was treated with salts and laudanum.|"['1.

On May 4th, 1805, the explorers faced challenges when the rudder irons of their large Perogue broke. This delayed their journey until 9 o'clock in the morning. Despite the setback, they marveled at the rich and beautiful countryside along the Missouri River. The day began with dense woodlands on both sides of the river, transitioning into a stunning ascending plain. They spotted various animals, including a black martin. In the evening, one of the explorers took a walk along the riverbank. The following day, May 5th, 1805, started with a successful deer hunt during a morning walk. The explorers encountered game aplenty, such as buffalo, elk, and antelopes. They faced challenges with the perogue's rudder irons but managed to repair it swiftly. The landscape remained picturesque, with an abundance of wildlife, including wolves and bears. The explorers also encountered unique bird species, like the white brant, adding to their observations of the natural world.|"[""1.

On May 5, 1805, the explorers encountered various wildlife. They killed two Elk, a Buffaloe, and a large bear. The dog caught a goat, which was poor and with young. The group observed wolves and wolves' dens. The next day, they continued their journey, passing streams and observing the beautiful plains. They saw bald eagles and killed three Buffaloe, one Elk, and eight beavers. The landscape was fertile and the river's water was rising. The explorers faced challenges with a canoe, but managed to continue their voyage. The wildlife provided opportunities for hunting and observations, adding to their experiences along the Missouri River.|"['1.

On May 7th, 1805, the explorers had a fine morning as the river rose slightly. The driftwood started to flow, and the water was clearer than usual. The wind picked up, causing a canoe to fill with water due to bad steering, delaying them for about 3 hours. They took a meridian altitude and noted the country on the north side of the Missouri River was one of the most beautiful plains they had seen. The hills on the south side were high and uneven. The day included walking along the riverbank, shooting 2 beavers, and later killing two buffaloes for their camp. The next day, May 8th, 1805, they set out early under a gentle breeze from the east. A black cloud appeared from the southeast, giving a slight sprinkle of rain. They examined a large river with fertile land and cottonwood trees, which they named Milk River due to its white-colored water. The expedition continued, observing the landscape and wildlife, including beavers and buffaloes.|['1.

"On May 8, 1805, Captain C. and the party encountered a variety of wildlife including buffaloes, elk, deer, goats, beavers, and wolves. Captain C. managed to hunt a beaver and a wolf, while the party collectively hunted 3 beavers and a deer. They marveled at the abundance of meat available in the country. They also spotted signs of Indian activity but decided to avoid any potential encounters with the Assiniboins. Captain C. even thought he saw smoke and Indian lodges in the distance. The next day, May 9, 1805, they sailed smoothly despite encountering a dry river that appeared as wide as the Missouri but devoid of running water. They named this peculiar river ""Big Dry River."" The land was fertile with rolling hills and sparse timber.

Today, we encountered a vast number of wild animals, especially Elk and Buffalo. The Buffalo have become so tame that people can easily shoo them away by throwing sticks and stones. We also observed a large amount of timber cut by beavers, likely done the previous year. In one area, they had cleared three acres along the riverbank and a considerable portion of the timber. The river's width has remained consistent, but it seems shallower due to sandbars. The water is becoming clearer as we progress. I am eager to catch sight of the Rocky Mountains. I spotted and described a unique bird species, different from any I have seen before, with distinctive features and loud calls.

On May 10, 1805, the party faced health issues like boils and sore eyes. They used remedies like emollient poultices for boils and a solution of white vitriol and sugar of lead for sore eyes. The wind was strong, and they had to stop due to its intensity. A dog from the opposite side made them think they hadn't passed the Assiniboine Indians. Captain Clark killed animals for food. On May 11, 1805, they navigated the river with strong currents and falling banks. The wind caused delays, and they marveled at the terrain's soil composition. They encountered a bear, which took a lot of effort to subdue due to its resilience. The party stayed overnight, rendered bear oil, and continued their journey the next day.|['1.

On May 17, 1805, the expedition faced a fine morning with a northwesterly wind and temperatures at 60°. They set out early, navigating the rugged country with high hills and a narrow river. The area showed signs of salt deposits, with cottonwood trees scattered in the bottoms and some pine and cedar on the hills. The river was narrower than before, around 200 to 300 yards wide, with muddy bottoms and rich earth on the hills. They encountered two large creeks, one on the starboard side and the other near their camp on the larboard side, with slightly brackish water. The day was not abundant in buffalo and deer, but elk were plentiful. The night brought a fire scare, but the party managed to move their lodge in time. On May 18, 1805, they faced windy conditions, proceeding well with the help of a tow rope. The river was narrow with a gentle current, and the landscape featured cottonwood trees along the riverbanks. The hills widened later in the day, with larger bottoms and more timber. They passed a creek on the starboard side and camped on the larboard side near a small island. Captain Clark hunted four deer, including mule deer, and the party saw buffaloes, elk, deer, and antelopes. The saline substance in the area continued to be present.|['1.

On May 19, 1805, Captain Clark recorded a cold night with the temperature at 38 degrees in the morning. Due to a heavy dew, they couldn't set out until the fog cleared. They encountered rugged hills and killed a bear and some deer. Captain Lewis's dog was injured by a beaver. Later, they ascended a hill and saw the mouth of the M. Shell River. The river was crooked and swift with many obstacles. Captain Lewis walked on shore and hunted, while men in the party killed deer and beavers. They camped on the Starboard Side in a cottonwood bottom. The next day, May 20, 1805, they navigated a narrow and crooked river and reached the entrance of the Muscle Shell River, a tributary of the Missouri. The area was described as broken with some timber and fertile lands. They encountered a creek infested with flies and named it Blowing Fly Creek. They halted to explore the region and observed the characteristics of the rivers. Captain Clark hunted and observed the landscape.|"[""1.

On the delightful morning of Tuesday, May 21st, 1805, the explorers embarked early and made good progress using the cord. The shores were steep and rocky, with a mixture of black and yellow clay. They noted the absence of extensive pure sand collections, with bars mostly made of black mud and some fine sand. The Missouri River abruptly curved to meet the Muscle Shell River, creating a valley of undulating terrain. The landscape was fertile, covered in low grass, herbs, and abundant prickly pear, but devoid of any timber. The south side featured high, broken terrain with scattered pine and dwarf cedar. The weather turned stormy in the evening, forcing the group to relocate their camp to seek shelter from the strong winds. Despite the challenging conditions, they managed to hunt elk, deer, and a buffalo cow.|"['1.

On May 22nd, 1805, the explorers faced strong winds that delayed their journey until 10 o'clock. Captain Lewis hunted a deer before dinner, while Captain Clark explored the rolling countryside with rich, sticky soil. The vegetation was sparse, mainly prickly pear and low grass. They camped on the Stard Side earlier than planned to save bear oil. On May 23rd, 1805, they encountered frost and ice along the water's edge. They passed Teapot Creek, which lacked drinkable water due to salt impurities. Burrowing squirrels' existence without water surprised them. The landscape featured small creeks and mountains in the distance. The explorers observed wildlife and blooming wild roses, noting the challenges of the terrain and the peculiarities of the local fauna.|"[""1.

On Sunday, May 26th, 1805, we started our journey early, mostly using the toe line to guide our boat along the river, with the oars just to help us cross. The landscape was rugged, with high hills jutting out on both sides of the river. The cliffs were shedding stones, making our passage tricky. The black rock had given way to soft sandstone, being eroded quickly by the river. Captain Clark explored the area and saw mountains running parallel to the river on both sides and another range in the distance. I also climbed a hill and saw the Rocky Mountains for the first time, a breathtaking sight. Despite the challenges ahead, like the snow-covered Rockies, I tried to remain optimistic about our journey to the Pacific. We encountered elk, bighorn sheep, and even a rattlesnake.

On May 29, 1805, a buffalo caused a commotion by swimming across the river and approaching the sleeping men. The buffalo came within 18 inches of their heads, but a man woke up and scared it away. As the buffalo passed through, it damaged some equipment. Despite this, the journey continued, passing a river with abundant wood. The landscape changed with hills and rocky points, making progress difficult. Wolves were spotted near a cliff where many buffalos had fallen to their demise. Rain and strong winds led the team to stop for the night. The next day, the rain persisted, making travel challenging due to slippery banks. The air was dry, indicating a change in climate ahead. Encampments of Indians were seen, suggesting they were the Minetares or Blackfoot Indians. Snow mixed with rain was observed on the hills, and timber was scarce. The journey continued with labor and difficulty, facing rapids and rocky points.|"['1.

On Friday, May 31st, 1805, we set out early with two perogues, leaving behind the canoes and crews to retrieve the buffalo meat from the previous night. Rain began shortly after we started and continued until midday, leaving the day cloudy. The rocky points and riffles in the river posed challenges for the men, who often found themselves waist-deep in the cold water. The banks were slippery, making it hard for them to wear their footwear while dragging the heavy canoes. Despite the difficult conditions, the men worked tirelessly without complaint. The landscape we passed was breathtaking, with towering cliffs rising to 200-300 feet made of white sandstone. The erosion from water created unique formations that resembled grand stone buildings. The walls of stone, resembling human masonry, were strikingly regular and durable, showcasing nature's artistry.

On June 4, 1805, Captain Lewis and a small group headed north while I, with another group, explored the South Fork. We trekked through grassy plains, encountering Prairie dogs and a close encounter with a white bear. The river's rapid flow was flanked by high bluffs and islands. The landscape was sparsely covered with timber. The next day, June 5, 1805, the weather was cold and rainy. We journeyed up the river, noting the vast amount of water needed to saturate the soil. We encountered a creek, which I named Lark Creek, and saw diverse wildlife like buffaloes, wolves, and antelopes. We roasted burrowing squirrels for supper, finding them flavorful and tender. The river was wide and had a steady current, with increased timber along its banks.|"['1.

On June 5th, 1805, the explorers faced a cold morning with snow on the mountains to the southeast. They saw buffaloes trying to cross a swift river but failing. Three white bears approached their camp, and the explorers killed and ate them. Continuing northward, they crossed the river multiple times and observed snow-covered mountains in the distance. Realizing the river's course was not favorable for their journey, they decided to return by land. Hiking through the plains, they encountered rain, killed animals for food, and faced challenges with makeshift rafts. The next day, despite more rain and slippery conditions, they persisted, overcoming dangerous bluffs and finding shelter in an old Indian lodge. The day ended with a comforting meal, rest, and a sense of accomplishment.|['1.

On Sunday, June 9th, 1805, we decided to lighten our boats by storing heavy items like bags, food, tools, and ammunition in a hole called a cache. The cache was dug by some of our crew, and Cruzatte, an experienced navigator, oversaw the process. After reviewing our maps and Indian information, we concluded that taking the South fork of the Missouri River was the best choice. Despite some doubts from the group, Cruzatte believed the North fork was the true Missouri River. To settle the debate, either Captain Clark or I would explore the South fork by land. I felt unwell but took some salts for relief. We made preparations, including repairing weapons and my Airgun, before setting off. The cache was carefully constructed to conceal our items securely. In the evening, Cruzatte played the violin, and the crew danced and sang, keeping spirits high.|['1.

On June 9, 1805, the expedition faced a fair morning with strong winds from the southwest. The decision was made to bury heavy items like powder, lead, provisions, and tools in case of emergencies. They planned to leave one boat behind and head up the South fork. Captain Lewis was feeling unwell and took salts. They created a cache for the supplies and enjoyed dancing and singing in the evening. The next day, June 10, 1805, was fair, and they dried their belongings. Shields fixed Captain Lewis's air gun, showcasing his skills. To prevent accidents, they buried ammunition and supplies. They selected items to bury, secured their boats, and prepared to head up the South fork. The day ended with rain and rising river levels.

On Tuesday, June 11th, 1805, Captain Lewis shared his journal entry. Feeling better but weakened, he set out with his party and discovered a herd of Elk near the Missouri River. Despite intense pain, he brewed a decoction from choke cherries that miraculously relieved him. The party caught fish, including a white species resembling the Hickory Shad. The next day, June 12th, Lewis felt revived, avoided steep ravines, and killed two large bears. The party enjoyed bear meat for breakfast and marveled at the Rocky Mountains covered in snow. After a long day, they camped by the Missouri River, having traveled 27 miles and caught buffalo, antelope, and mule deer. Lewis ended the day catching white fish in abundance.|['1.

On June 16, 1805, the explorers faced a challenging journey. The day started with rain and strong winds. Captain Clark led a team to scout the rapids while Captain Lewis worked on preparing equipment. The Indian woman's health was a concern, but she was slowly improving. Buffaloes were plentiful in the area, but navigating the treacherous rapids posed a danger to them. The explorers had to carefully plan their route and make use of the limited resources available. The day ended with the team making progress despite the rugged terrain and unpredictable weather.

On Tuesday, June 18th, 1805, the explorers were busy with various tasks. They secured their boat, the perogue, and started building a cache to store supplies. The hunters returned with deer meat, but no elk. Skins were needed for the boat, and buffalo hunting was planned. The wagons were completed, and the men prepared for strong winds. The Indian woman was recovering, although she ate the wrong food. The explorers encountered a large waterfall and a massive spring. They saw buffalo herds and hunted for meat. On Wednesday, June 19th, they retrieved the meat and sent some men to hunt elk. The Indian woman's health improved after receiving proper care. The explorers prepared for the portage and encountered a buffalo bull near camp. They continued their journey along the Missouri River, facing challenges and making discoveries.|"['1.

On June 19th, 1805, Captain Clark and his party set out to hunt a White Bear on an island but couldn't find it. They decided to dry the meat they had and move up the river to explore a small creek. The creek only had backwater for a mile, so they continued along the Missouri River. They found extensive bottoms and hills. The next day, June 20th, Captain Lewis sent hunters to kill buffalo on the opposite riverbank. They planned to stock up on dried meat for the upcoming journey. The Indian woman with them was feeling better and fishing. They encountered many buffalo herds near the water. Captain Clark returned with survey notes of the Missouri River. The weather was cloudy with a hard wind, and they started the portage. They faced obstacles but eventually made it back to camp with plenty of meat.

During my time on the Plains and above the falls, my party and I heard a loud noise from a direction slightly to the North of West. It sounded like the discharge of a 6-pound cannon from afar. Initially, I dismissed it as thunder, but upon hearing it clearly near the extreme Southeast bend of the River above the falls, I paid attention. The noise was periodic, not like thunder, and heard at different times of the day and night. I speculate it might be caused by water in caverns of the immense mountains, but the irregularity of the sound puzzles me. I heard the Mandans mention that the Rocky Mountains make a great noise, but they couldn't explain the cause. The large river near the Great Falls, named Medicine River, may have derived its name from this mysterious rumbling sound.|"['1.

On June 22, 1805, Captain Lewis, myself, and the party, excluding a few members, transported our gear across the portage using a canoe on wheels. We encountered challenges as the axletree broke multiple times and the wheel's coupling tongues were fragile. Despite the difficulties, we reached our intended campsite near the Medicine River. Wolves had ravaged some of our stored meat. The next day, we continued the journey with the help of all the men. We cleared the area, set up camp, and assembled the boat frame. Later, we searched for missing hunters, finding Shannon who had dried buffalo meat but no elk. Due to the late hour, we decided to stay overnight at Shannon's camp across the river. The men faced fatigue, sore feet, and prickly pears but remained cheerful. Reubin Fields returned with news of Shannon's absence, causing concern.|"[""1.

On Monday, June 24th, 1805, the expedition split up to search for missing members along the river. Captain Lewis sent J. Fields up the river to find two others. Meanwhile, Lewis crossed the Missouri River and coordinated the arrival of supplies. Captain Clark, on the other hand, divided the remaining baggage into three parcels and sent them ahead with the party. The day was overcast, with rain and hail in the evening. The next day, Lewis sent the party back to the lower camp and organized hunting trips for elk. Despite a bear encounter, the team managed to gather meat and supplies. The landscape was described as beautiful, with wild rye and mint growing abundantly in the area. The group at the lower camp ended the day with a lively dance.|['1. What did Captain Lewis do while J.

On June 26, 1805, Captain Clark and his party set out early with supplies for their canoes, including food, tools, and clothing. They buried some items for safekeeping at the campsite, such as pork, flour, and weapons. The weather was cloudy with rain, and they observed many buffalo near their camp. The wind changed direction, providing a good sailing wind for their canoes. On June 27, 1805, the group continued work on their canoe, with some members hunting elk and bear. A storm brought thunder, lightning, and hail. The river water turned red, likely due to sediment from upstream. Captain Clark mapped the river, and the men returned to camp in the rain.

On June 28, 1805, Captain Lewis tasked the men with various jobs like shaving elk skins and gathering willow bark to bind the boat. The men were prepared for the party's return with a meal, but they didn't show up. To cover a section of the boat, buffalo hides were used due to insufficient elk skins. The men had to singe the buffalo hides with a torch as they couldn't shave them. The camp was on alert due to troublesome white bears in the area. Meanwhile, Captain Clark and his party faced challenges with rising waters and a difficult journey to secure supplies. Despite the hardships, they managed to camp at Willow Run, where they encountered rain and strong winds. The men were wet and cold, so Captain Clark gave them a comforting drink.|"['1.

Early this morning, after a light rain, the party faced challenges due to the wet prairie making it impossible to reach the upper part of the portage. Most of the group had to return for the baggage left behind the previous day. Captain C. decided to continue alone towards the falls, taking the river route to camp. As a storm approached, they sought shelter under rocks near the river. A sudden downpour with hail caused a dangerous rise in water levels, nearly sweeping them away. Captain C. managed to save himself, his crew, and the Indian woman and child. After the storm, they regrouped at camp, finding the rest of the party in disarray due to hail injuries. The rain caused the river to rise significantly, hindering further progress that evening. Captain C. lost valuable items, and the woman's child's belongings were swept away, leaving them cold and wet. The party returned to camp for safety and dry clothes.|['1.

On June 30th, 1805, Captain Clark organized the men's tasks for the day. He sent some to hunt buffalo, others to retrieve lost items, and a few to repair carriages. The hunters returned with meat, and the men brought back the lost baggage. They worked on making axeltrees and fixing the carriages. The men also complained about injuries from the previous day. Two men found the compass in the mud near the river mouth, but the other lost items were irrecoverable. Later, a group was sent to deposit baggage at the six-mile stake. There was a strong wind from the southwest in the evening. Captain Clark observed an unusually high number of buffalo in the area, estimating at least ten thousand. Lewis, on July 1st, 1805, assigned tasks for boat repair, including sewing leather, collecting wood, and making tar. The day was warm and mosquito-infested. Captain Clark returned tired but with most of the baggage. Plans were made to deal with bears near the camp the next day.|['1.

They encountered a large hailstorm, thankfully not as severe as it could have been. The hunters managed to kill three white bears, with one being notably large. The expedition faced challenges due to the strong winds from the southwest. The next day, on July 2, 1805, they continued their tasks, including assembling the iron boat and hunting for bear on a large island.

On July 4, 1805, the Lewis and Clark expedition faced challenges with the weather and the completion of their leather boat. Despite a lively morning and the completion of the boat, a sudden rain shower interrupted their activities. Lewis made a copy of the river map as a precaution. The team danced and enjoyed themselves until the rain forced them indoors. An elk and a beaver were hunted, but the tar used for the boat was not effective due to the unique climate at the Missouri falls. On July 5, efforts continued to dry the boat with charcoal and beeswax. Buffaloes were hunted for food, and the team prepared to dispatch canoes to hunt more. The landscape was noted to be less fertile in this region compared to further down the Missouri River. On July 6, heavy storms with hail and rain persisted, hindering boat preparations.

On July 6, 1805, a severe storm hit the expedition. A massive hailstorm, with hail as big as musket balls, covered the ground after a half-hour of intense rain and hail. The storm was accompanied by strong winds. The day was mostly cloudy but cleared up later. Some men were sent to hunt buffalo for their skins and meat, while others worked on the boat. Captain Clark's servant, York, fell ill, and Lewis administered medicine to help him. On July 7, 1805, the weather remained warm and cloudy, hindering operations. The men faced challenges due to the lack of tents and rotting leather clothes. Hunters returned with buffalo and deer skins. Captain Clark set out to replace lost notes and hunt buffalo. The herds of buffalo in the area were disappearing, moving downstream.|"['1.

On July 9th, 1805, Captain Clark faced disappointment when the leather boat leaked and failed. He decided to build canoes to carry their baggage, as the leather boat needed tar they didn't have. Meanwhile, on July 10th, 1805, Captain Lewis worked on his boat, while Sergeant Ordway transported baggage with canoes. The day was windy, and Lewis buried the boat frame and truck wheels. Clark searched for suitable trees to make canoes, while facing challenges with making ax handles. The team struggled with mosquitoes and used chokecherry wood for handles. Despite setbacks, they persevered in their journey along the river, adapting to the conditions they encountered.|['1.

On July 12, 1805, the Lewis and Clark expedition faced challenges. While the team worked on canoes and dried meat, Sergeant Pryor injured his shoulder. Hunters returned with deer, and more men arrived to help build canoes. The camp was plagued by mosquitoes and gnats, but there were a few wild pigeons nearby. The next day, July 13, 1805, Lewis embarked with baggage in small canoes, bidding farewell to their camp. He encountered a unique Indian lodge structure and reached Clark's camp. The expedition faced strong winds, causing some canoes to take on water. Despite the challenges, they hunted buffalo and preserved meat for their journey ahead. Lewis also collected plant specimens and noted the troublesome mosquitoes.|"['1.

"On July 15, 1805, during their expedition, the explorers faced a rainy night, leaving them soaked. The next morning, they encountered strong winds from the southwest. Despite the challenging weather conditions, they embarked at 10 o'clock. They navigated well, passing a river they named Smiths River after the Secretary of the Navy. The river meandered through a picturesque valley between two mountains. The landscape was adorned with high grass, blooming prickly pears, sunflowers, lambs quarter, and nettles. The explorers spotted beavers along the riverbanks. The day's journey was marked by elk and deer hunting, with the explorers camping on the starboard side. The timber along the river was more abundant than before. The explorers found it difficult to track the river's course due to its extreme twists and turns.

Lewis's journal entry on July 16, 1805, described their encounters with deserted shelters made of willow bushes, possibly belonging to Snake Indians. They discovered evidence of horses nearby, raising hopes of meeting the indigenous people soon. The explorers enjoyed a breakfast of buffalo meat cooked in the Indian style. Lewis decided to proceed ahead alone towards the point where the river entered the Rocky Mountains, leaving behind Captain Clark's party. He observed a stream with aspens and halted near a well-timbered bottom before the mountains. As they approached the rapids at the foot of the mountains, Lewis marveled at"|['1.

On July 19, 1805, during their expedition, explorers encountered various challenges and discoveries. They navigated a winding river along an Indian path, passing abandoned Indian camps. Despite a lack of provisions, they managed to hunt elk for food. The rugged terrain caused injuries to their feet, and they camped by a beautiful creek. The next day, on July 20, 1805, they continued their journey, using the toe rope due to strong currents. They marveled at the wide valley with scattered timber and various berries. They named a creek after one of their party members. They encountered smoke signals from natives and found an Elk skin left by another party member. The day ended with camping near a spring, surrounded by prickly pears. They also observed a unique black woodpecker during their travels.|"['1.

On July 20th, 1805, Captain Clark embarked early in the morning and journeyed through a valley, deviating about six miles from the river to his left. He encountered an old Indian path which led him to the river approximately 18 miles away from his previous night's camp, just above the entry of a sizable creek named White Paint Creek. The party was fatigued and their feet were sore from walking on flint and prickly pears. Captain Clark observed smoke up the valley of Pryor's Creek, likely caused by the natives. He left signs along his path to inform any pursuing Indians that they were friends. Due to the pain and exhaustion of the party, they decided to camp by the river and await the arrival of others.|"['1.

On July 22, 1805, Captain Clark faced a cold night without a proper blanket, causing pain in his feet. While the men hunted for deer, he nursed his feet due to weakness from a diet of only venison and currents. The next day, July 23, 1805, they set out early, and Drewyer, who got lost overnight, rejoined the group after hunting five deer. They navigated the rapid river with many islands and riffles, noting the rich loam bottoms and thick underbrush. They passed Whitehouse's Creek and collected wild onions and flax seeds. To signal they were not enemies, they hoisted flags on their canoes. The day ended with sightings of wildlife like antelopes and beavers, and they camped 25 miles apart from Captain Clark's party.|"['1.

On July 23, 1805, the explorers embarked on their journey by foot, encountering various wildlife along the way. They hunted deer and antelope, leaving the catch by the riverbank for their canoes. The terrain was characterized by high mountains with scattered pine and cedar trees. The following day, July 24, 1805, they navigated the strong currents of the river, passing through a valley flanked by mountains rising like an amphitheater. The explorers observed beavers and otters, witnessing how beavers alter the river's course by damming up channels. Despite encountering numerous rapids, their journey remained relatively safe. They also spotted a variety of wildlife, including bears, cranes, antelopes, and various bird species. The explorers marveled at the ever-changing landscape and the challenges posed by the rugged terrain, all while dealing with pesky mosquitoes, eye gnats, and prickly pears.|['1.

On July 24th, 1805, the explorers continued their journey along a creek in search of the Indian road. They spotted a wild horse but couldn't approach it. They then headed to the river, passing through valleys with streams and beaver dams. After hunting a deer for lunch, they camped by the river. The landscape featured narrow bottoms with little timber. The following day, July 25th, they encountered strong water currents and saw a brown bear and antelopes. The country's terrain remained similar, with plains and woodlands. They named a creek after a member of their party. The explorers faced rapids obstructed by sharp rocks and observed the geological formations of the cliffs. Captain Clark ventured to the three forks of the Missouri, noting burnt plains and horse tracks. The rocky cliffs along the river showed signs of erosion.|['1.

On July 27, 1805, Captain Clark fell ill with a high fever and body aches, but decided to continue towards the middle fork. Despite the pain, he traveled across a prairie to reach the river, which was as large as the North fork. They found no fresh Indian signs and continued down to the junction, noting the river's features. Captain Lewis arrived later, and they named the rivers after notable figures. Jefferson's River, Madison's River, and Gallatin's River were named after significant individuals. The explorers noted the rivers' characteristics and the potential for navigation. The area was rich in resources, with ample timber for construction. The day ended with a refreshing shower and successful hunting. The campsite held historical significance as it was where past events involving Native Americans had taken place.|"['1.

On July 30th, 1805, our journey began at 8 o'clock as we moved 13.5 miles up the North fork of the river. The river was fast-flowing and shallow with gravel, many islands, and various channels. We passed by the place where the Squar interpretress was taken and encountered some minor injuries among the crew. We camped on the standard side, enjoying a cool evening. The next day, July 31st, 1805, Captain Lewis waited impatiently for Captain Clark and the party to arrive. He decided to set out up the river when he noticed Charbono walking along the shore. The canoes had been delayed due to the rapid water and winding river. After breakfast, they resumed their journey with the river becoming narrower, surrounded by high hills and sparse timber. They encountered a significant river that they named River Philosophy, which discharged clear water and was abundant with wildlife.

On August 2, 1805, we resumed our journey at sunrise. The weather was pleasant, with a northwest wind. As the river continued to flow southward, I decided to cross it to shorten our route. We managed to wade through the river about 5 miles upstream from where we camped the night before. The river had a swift current, was waist-deep, and about 90 yards wide with a smooth pebble bottom mixed with coarse gravel. The valley we traversed today was 6 to 8 miles wide, with fertile land covered in grass. The valley gradually ascends to two ranges of mountains on each side. The mountains still had snow on their peaks, contrasting with the intense midday heat in the valley. We encountered various wild fruits like currants, gooseberries, and serviceberries, which we enjoyed. We also spotted deer, antelopes, elk, and bear tracks along our journey. Despite losing a tomahawk, we continued our trek, covering 24 miles and feasting on venison for supper.|['1.

On August 4th, 1805, during their expedition, the explorers faced challenges navigating the river due to its crowded islands and rapid currents. The journey was tough, with the crew hauling canoes over rapids every few hundred yards. Meriwether Lewis directed some team members to wait at a designated point while he scouted the area. The terrain was rugged, with high mountains partially covered in snow. Lewis decided to ascend a mountain to gain a better view of the valley. Meanwhile, on August 5th, 1805, Charbono and Sergeant Gass were sent ahead to a timbered area as they couldn't march far. Lewis and Drewyer explored the area, encountering steep rocks and dangerous falls. Despite the challenges, Lewis strategized to navigate the river and reunite with his team. The landscape varied from fertile grasslands to meager soils with prickly plants.|"['1.

On August 6, 1805, Captain Clark and his party faced challenges navigating the river, encountering rapids and stones. They reached a low bluff on the starboard side for breakfast. Drewyer relayed information from Captain Lewis that the fork they were ascending was impassable, turning north. The middle fork, however, was gentle and turned southwest, with Indian roads leading that way. They decided to take the middle fork. They met at the forks, where Captain Lewis left a letter detailing their discoveries. Unfortunately, beavers cut down the pole with the letter, and skins left on a tree were taken by panthers. Due to a canoe accident, they had to halt to dry their belongings. The day ended with a violent northwesterly wind and rain. Captain Lewis, on August 7, 1805, dried their stores, dispatched Reubin Fields to search for Shannon, and secured a canoe in case of rising waters. They named a nearby creek Turf Creek. Captain Lewis repaired his air gun and took altitude observations. They reloaded and proceeded up Jefferson's River, encountering rain and thunder. The biting flies were bothersome, but the eye gnats had disappeared. Musquitoes were still present, and green flies were swarming.|"['1.

On August 7, 1805, a pleasant morning greeted us as we aired our supplies and checked our positions with the Sextant. Due to limited provisions, we decided to abandon one canoe and securely left it on the lower side of the main fork. The landscape here is a valley flanked by mountains, with fertile land, scattered trees, and bogs. We headed up the S.E. fork, passing a stream we named Turf Creek for its turf-filled waters. The river Jefferson is meandering and narrow, with sparse timber. A thunderstorm hit us in the afternoon. The next day, August 8, we set off early, finding the river gentler and deeper. The banks were lined with buffalo clover, sunflowers, and various grasses. We encountered Philanthropy River and continued our journey, facing challenges due to the lack of timber for fuel. Despite the difficulties, the hunting party returned with deer and antelope. Captain Clark's ankle injury remains a concern, but wildlife sightings lifted our spirits.|"['1.

On the evening of August 8th, 1805, the sky was once again covered with clouds, much to my disappointment, preventing me from making any observations of the moon. An Indian woman with us pointed out a high plain to the right, indicating it was close to her people's summer retreat beyond the mountains. This hill, she explained, was known as the beaver's head due to its resemblance to the animal's head. She assured us that her people could be found either on the river nearby or the one just to the west. To meet them quickly, I decided to lead a small group to the source of the main river, cross the mountains to the Columbia River, and travel downstream until we found the Indians or others with horses. This journey might take a month, but it was necessary as we lacked horses and needed to conserve our limited supplies for the long voyage ahead.|"['1.

On August 9, 1805, the explorers had a successful morning journeying along the river. Despite Captain Clark's ankle injury, they pressed on. The day was filled with rapid currents and the return of a lost companion. Captain Lewis and his team set out to scout the river ahead. As the evening approached, they made camp on the left side of the river. The next day, August 10, 1805, they continued their exploration, following an Indian road towards the mountains. They encountered wildlife and challenging terrains. Lewis made careful notes, deciding on the best route to navigate the river's forks. The landscape was rugged and beautiful, with diverse flora and fauna. Their journey was marked by discoveries and strategic decision-making for their expedition.|"[""1.

This evening, the Native Americans entertained us with their traditional dances until late at night. I retired to rest at midnight, leaving the men to enjoy the company of the Indians. The music and style of dancing were similar to those of the Missouri nation. Despite being awakened by their loud yells during the night, I managed to have a decent night's sleep. The next morning, Captain Clark departed early, sending some hunters ahead. The weather was cool and cloudy, with a slight rain at 8 A.M. They encountered numerous shoals, requiring them to drag the canoes for most of the day. They named a stream McNeal's Creek after one of their party members. The day ended with the group camping in a smooth prairie near cottonwood trees, using dry willow brush for fuel.|"['1.

I asked Cameahwait to gather his people and join me at Jeffersons river tomorrow, where our supplies awaited with another Chief and a group of white men. I requested they bring about 30 extra horses to help transport our goods. Once there, we planned to stay, trade for more horses, and discuss our journey to the ocean. Cameahwait agreed and spoke to his village, confirming they would accompany us. Drewyer estimated they had around 400 horses, some of fine quality with Spanish brands. Despite their poverty, the tribe remained joyful and danced until midnight. The next day, due to the cold morning and soreness from the previous day, Capt. Clark's group set out at 7 A.M. negotiating the challenging rapids and streams. They camped near the rattlesnake cliff on the left side of the river.|"['1.

On the morning of August 17, 1805, Captain C set out after breakfast at 7 AM. The river was still rapid and shallow, making it necessary to drag the large canoes most of the day. The water was extremely cold, and they encountered several bad rapids in the evening. Along the narrow bottoms, they found plenty of buffaloe clover growing, with only a few scattered small pines on the hills. The river bottoms had willow, service berry, and currant bushes. They gathered service berries and caught some trout, and a deer was hunted by those who stayed out overnight. Captain Clark sent hunters to the river forks while the men were fatigued and had to use small willow brush for fuel. The day ended with the group camping a few miles below.|['1.

We set up our camp below the river fork on the left side, a flat grassy area where we placed our canoes and luggage. We created a shelter with a sail and willow branches for shade. Around 4 P.M., we gathered the Indians and, using interpreters Labuish, Charbono, and Sah-cah-gar-weah, explained our purpose in their land. We emphasized our government's care for them, their reliance on us for goods and protection, and our desire to establish trade routes for mutual benefit. We requested their assistance in transporting our baggage, promising fair compensation. The Indians were pleased and offered help. We identified their chiefs and presented them with gifts, including medals and supplies. We impressed them with our technology and generosity, sharing food and goods. Our council concluded with a feast and a demonstration of our air-gun, which they considered a powerful spiritual tool. Our hunters provided meat, furthering goodwill. We planned for our journey ahead, with one group preparing to make canoes while the other advanced to the Shoshone camp for further exploration.|"['1.

On August 17, 1805, Captain Clark and his team set out on their journey. They encountered a group of Indians who welcomed them with joy. The Indians were from the Snake Nation and had been camping nearby. The Indians were amazed by the appearance of the explorers, their canoes, and even Captain Lewis's dog. The explorers exchanged information with the Indians about the Columbia River, the surrounding area, and the game available. The Indians shared that the river had huge waterfalls and the area was challenging to navigate. Despite the difficulties, Captain Clark decided to explore the area further to verify the information. He selected a team of men to accompany him on this exploration. The Indians were generous, and the explorers shared a meal with them. The next day, Captain Clark left with his team while Captain Lewis stayed behind to trade for horses with the Indians.|['1.

Early this morning, Captain C. continued his journey. After walking five miles, he reached some brush lodges of the Shoshone people. There were about seven families living there. They warmly welcomed him and his party, offering them plenty of boiled salmon to eat. Additionally, they shared dried salmon and chokecherries. The Shoshones showed Captain C. their fish weirs, located about 200 yards away. These weirs were designed to catch salmon by blocking the river channels with fallen trees and willow stakes. The main channel had two separate weirs with baskets to catch fish swimming up or downstream. After inspecting the weirs, Captain C. crossed the river and camped on the starboard side near high cliffs. He was later reunited with his party members who had obtained fresh salmon from the Indians at the forks.|"['1.

The tribe we encountered possessed a modest collection of metal items including knives, brass kettles, arm bands, buttons, and arrow points made of iron and brass. They acquired these through trade with the Crow and Rocky Mountain Indians. Flint was their primary tool, used for skinning animals, dressing fish, and making arrows. They shaped the flint with elk or deer horn points with remarkable skill. Axes were absent; they cut wood using stones or elk horns. Their culinary tools included pots made of earth or a white stone found in the hills. Shields were buffalo hide, arrow-proof and painted with various designs. The tribe's method of preparing shields involved a ceremonial process believed to imbue them with protective powers. They also had a unique instrument called the Poggamoggon for defense, as well as armor made of antelope skin. Their fire-making tools consisted of a blunt arrow and soft, spongy wood like willow or cottonwood.|"['1.

The Shoshones reserve their few guns for war and use bows and arrows for hunting. They have skins resembling sheep that they find on high mountains to the West and S.W. The sheep are about the same size as common sheep but with shorter wool mixed with long hairs, especially on the upper neck. The skins are worn, making it hard to see the animal's true color and form. The Shoshone horse gear usually includes a halter and saddle made of buffalo hair cords or pliant rawhide. The halter is long and never removed from the horse's neck, forming a noose under its jaw. The saddle, like pack saddles used by French and Spaniards, is made of wood and covered with rawhide. Stirrups are wooden and covered with leather. The Shoshones are skilled horsemen, painting their horses, cutting their ears, and decorating their manes and tails with bird feathers and ornaments.|['1.

On August 24th, 1805, Captain Clark set out early in the morning on his return journey. He marked his name on a pine tree and had breakfast on berries. While he was away, his party survived on pheasants and small fish they caught. Captain Clark slipped and injured his leg on a rock. The party seemed disheartened by the lack of food and the difficult river. Captain Lewis, on August 25th, loaded their horses and set out after sunrise. They encountered some Antelope but did not catch any. Charbono's information about the Indians' plans to leave them alarmed Captain Lewis. He had to quickly intervene to ensure they could continue their journey with the assistance they were promised. It was a challenging time, but they pressed on towards their goal.|"['1.

Captain Clark started his journey early in the morning towards the Indian camp near Fish Creek. The Indians at the camp were very hospitable, offering boiled salmon and berries to the party. Despite being poor and dirty, they showed kindness. Continuing up the river, they reached the bluff where they camped previously. They set up camp and split up to hunt and fish. Later, a group of passing Indians gave them salmon and Shannon brought back a beaver for supper. The pine trees grew abundantly on the mountains across the river. Despite Winsor falling ill and slowing them down, they encountered elk and deer. Lewis noted the extreme cold the next morning, with ice forming nearly a quarter-inch thick. They reached the source of the Missouri River, where they rested and had a meal before continuing their journey.|"[""1.

The tall snow-covered mountains across the Columbia River provide a refreshing coolness to the dry hillsides. Indigenous women gather fennel roots to feed their hungry children. The fennel root is knob-like, about 3 to 4 inches long, resembling a man's little finger. Its white, firm, and crisp form turns into fine white meal when dried and ground. The stem grows to 3 to 4 feet, with knobbed roots attached at the base. The deep green, multipartite leaves and small white flowers adorn this plant. The sunflowers near watercourses are plentiful, with seeds collected by natives for grinding into meal. After a display of gun firing, the group proceeds to a village with 32 brush lodges. Plans to purchase horses for an overland expedition are made, with the evening ending in merry dancing and hope for successful horse procurement the next day.|['1.

On August 27, 1805, Captain Clark noted in his journal that the morning started with some frost. Most of the men were out hunting, and a young man from the upper village brought news that Captain Lewis would join them around noon. The group had a meager breakfast with fish caught by one man and given by the Indians. The Native Americans depended on fishing for sustenance, while Clark's party was growing increasingly concerned about their food supply. An Indian brought in five salmon, two of which Clark purchased for supper. The next day, August 28, they received more fish from the Indians and purchased additional ones to sustain them. Despite efforts to hunt for game, they faced challenges finding food. Captain Lewis had secured horses for their journey, and Clark traded items for a horse. The group continued their journey, facing difficulties with sore-backed horses and limited supplies.|"['1.

On September 9, 1805, the explorers set out early through a plain, crossing a large creek with cotton trees on its banks. They continued along the valley, hunting deer, ducks, and prairie fowls. The day was fair with a northwest wind. The next day, September 10, the hunters were sent out to explore the area further. They encountered Flathead Indians and learned about their encounters with the Snake nation. The Flatheads were friendly and shared information about their tribe living near the Columbia River. The explorers made observations and delayed their journey to hunt for food. The Flatheads guided them and shared their experiences with the explorers. On September 11, they continued their journey up Travelers Rest Creek with the Flathead Indians. The landscape was described as open with valleys and good roads. The Flathead guide left, and the explorers continued through hilly terrain, camping near old Indian lodges. The next day, they faced challenging roads through steep mountains, encountering short and long-leaf pine, spruce pine, and fir trees. Despite the difficult terrain, they persevered, with some party members arriving at camp late in the evening.|['1. What did the explorers encounter on September 9, 1805?\nA. Flathead Indians\nB.

On September 13, 1805, Captain Lewis and a guide lost their horses, delaying the party. Continuing along the creek, they found hot springs with deer and elk tracks. The water was nearly boiling, making it hard to touch. After a detour, they camped by a small creek where they killed a deer and pheasants. The next day, they faced snow and difficult terrain, killing a colt for food. The following day, they struggled through deep snow, killing another colt for supper. On September 17, they faced scattered horses and harsh weather. Captain Clark led six hunters ahead to find game. They struggled with limited food supplies, relying on hunting to sustain them.

On September 22, 1805, a Sunday morning, I went down the river and met the Chief in a canoe. We crossed to his camp on a small island. After eating some salmon, I returned to meet Capt. Lewis. Along the way, Shields had three deer. I rode a young horse that threw me three times, hurting my hip. At dark, we met Capt. Lewis at the first village. The men were tired and hungry but ate heartily. We found the party weak and reduced, so the supplies I sent were crucial. The Indians stole some items, and we communicated through signs. The Chief drew a map showing the river and surrounding areas. On September 23, we traded with the Indians, made peace gestures, and obtained provisions. The next day, we hunted timber for canoes and found salmon at the forks.|"['1.

Near the starting point is an Indian Cabin, and to the south, a small island. We stopped on the starboard side below to make lunar observations, but the night was cloudy, disappointing our plans. The Indians, on horseback, came down both sides of the river to watch us as we descended. A man we had encountered earlier, who had shown interest in joining us to the great rapids, arrived with his son in a small canoe and insisted on accompanying us. Notably, there was hardly any timber near the river at the forks, and only a few trees were seen for a long distance up the river. Lewis's River appears to be around 250 yards wide, the Koos koos ke River about 150 yards wide, and the river below the forks about 300 yards wide. There was a misunderstanding between Shabono, one of our interpreters, and Jo. & R Fields, likely due to our poor diet consisting only of roots and dried fish. The Cho-pun-nish or Pierced nose Indians are described as sturdy men, attractive women, and very stylish in their attire. The men wear white Buffalo robes or Elk Skin adorned with white beads, sea shells, and feathers, while the women don shirts made of Ibex or Goat Skins with ornamental brass and beads.

On October 24th, 1805, a peaceful morning greeted us as the cautious natives approached. Two elderly chiefs expressed their wish to return home, fearing conflict with tribes downstream. We convinced them to stay two more nights to help us establish peace with those tribes. Capt. Lewis explored the falls while I led the party downstream. We navigated treacherous waters, passing through narrow channels and rapids. At a village of 20 houses, we encountered welcoming natives and unique wooden structures. These indigenous homes, with doors raised above ground, were adorned with cedar bark roofs. The evening brought a visit from a chief from below, fostering friendship and understanding. Music and dance bridged the gap between our cultures, paving the way for peaceful interactions. The day ended with shared stories and a newfound sense of camaraderie.|['1.

On October 25, 1805, the explorers faced a challenging day. They navigated treacherous waters, passing through dangerous whirlpools and rocks. Despite a few mishaps, they managed to safely guide their canoes through the turbulent channel. The native Indians observed their progress from the rocky shores. The explorers encountered friendly chiefs, exchanged gifts, and shared a meal of venison and goose. After a successful day on the river, they camped under the protection of high rocks. The next day, they repaired their leaky canoes, hunted for deer, and interacted with more native tribes. Despite challenges like fleas and wet conditions, the explorers remained determined and resourceful on their journey.|['1.

Near this place, nations are in conflict with the Snake Indians, who are abundant and reside along the river we crossed above the falls. The closest town is approximately a four-day journey to the southeast. The Snake Indians recently battled with the neighboring nations, causing casualties. Despite being only six miles apart, the two nations have distinct languages, with similarities to the tribes encountered earlier. The people near the falls, known as E-nee-shur, have a clucking tone in their language and practice head flattening. Those at the narrows, called E-chee-lute, have similar customs. The wind was strong, and we documented the languages of both chiefs before they departed.|['1.

The friendly village we encountered welcomed us with a feast of fish, berries, nuts, bread, and dried berries. We purchased dogs, fish, and berries from them before moving on. Further down the river, we stopped at another village where the people were also friendly. This village was situated near a river mouth and had 11 houses. The villagers shared that the river was full of falls and no salmon swam upstream. They hunted and lived off berries. The landscape became more rocky and hilly with pine and oak trees. We bought more dogs at this village and continued our journey. Along the way, we passed significant landmarks like the Sepulchar Island and the Cataract River with its numerous falls. The locals shared their culture, including using animal skins for clothing and ornaments. They offered us cranberries, root bread, and roots, and were delighted by the music from a violin.|['1.

The river's edge is rugged, with rocks jutting out into the water, giving the impression they tumbled from the towering hills nearby. Small bays and cascades dot the landscape, hinting at the raw power of nature. The river widens, resembling a drained pond with exposed stumps. The current is gentle, meandering at a leisurely pace of about one mile per hour. The surrounding area is rich and fertile, with signs of deer and bear. Despite the rain soaking us, we explored further, encountering new species of trees and wildlife. The day was dark and dreary as we navigated the challenging terrain, discovering abandoned villages and encountering the indigenous people. Despite their kindness in offering us food, they remained guarded, revealing little about their way of life. Despite the rain and discomfort, we pressed on, eager to uncover more mysteries of this untamed land.|"[""1.

On November 1, 1805, a group of men encountered a challenging stretch of the river. They saw an Indian swim to rescue a goose near a powerful waterfall, known as the Great Shute. The river was compressed within a narrow space, forming a tumultuous and dangerous passage. The men struggled to carry their canoes and gear over treacherous rocks and slippery hills to avoid another dangerous stretch downstream. The Indians they encountered had unique customs, such as flat heads achieved through head compression and a preference for beads in trade. Despite the difficulties of the journey, the men marveled at the sea otters and the unique culture of the native people they encountered along the river.|['1.

On November 2, 1805, the explorers encountered a rapid that was too dangerous for their loaded canoes. They sent men who couldn't swim with the loads to the end of the portage below. The men walked to the end of the portage with the carriers and waited until all the articles were safely brought over. They had breakfast and took a meridian altitude reading. Later, they encountered several Indians in a large canoe and passed various landmarks like islands, houses, and villages. The river widened, and they saw many waterfowl like swans, geese, and ducks. Hunting yielded a good catch of waterfowl for their evening meal. The next day, despite thick fog, they set out and explored a river with quicksand and a large sand bar. They encountered a large creek and a mountain they believed to be Mount Hood.|"['1.

Upon arriving at a village, 200 Flatheads greeted us warmly. They offered us a roasted root called Wap-to, similar to a hen's egg, to eat. The landscape was beautiful, with open prairies extending for a mile before woodlands began to rise in the background. The trees included white oak, spruce pine, and other types of pine, along with wild crab apple and unknown species of wood. Maple and cottonwood trees lined the riverbank, with some low bushes dotting the area. The Indians accompanied us, and we encountered several canoes along the way. At a village, we noticed more cloth and European trinkets than before. Unfortunately, during dinner, my tomahawk was stolen, and despite searching, it was not found. The journey continued past villages and islands, with encounters with well-dressed Indians armed with pistols and bows.

On November 5, 1805, the explorers faced a rainy day as they encountered a noisy array of birds near the river. Despite the discomfort, they managed to kill several birds for food. The group continued their journey along the river, passing villages and canoes of friendly Indians. The landscape was described as fertile and surrounded by tall timber, with a variety of wildlife present. The explorers made their way through the valley, facing rain and cold conditions. The passage also mentions encounters with snakes and the first night without Indian contact. The next day, on November 6, they navigated past Indian lodges and traded with locals for supplies. The explorers observed the beautiful natural surroundings and encountered Indians traveling downstream. Despite the rain and wet conditions, they found a spot to rest and dry their belongings near a remarkable knob on a narrow island.|['1.

On November 7, 1805, the explorers encountered Native American tribes along the river. The indigenous people wore unique clothing made from white cedar bark. The women's petticoats were woven with cedar bark and tied to cover their hips. The petticoats had tassels that separated when they moved. The men and women had different attire, with the women's robes being smaller and covering only their shoulders. The explorers traded fish hooks for otter skins with the locals. The Native Americans lived in houses raised above ground with fireplaces and storage under their beds. The explorers faced challenges navigating the river due to fog and high tides. Eventually, they reached the Pacific Ocean and heard the waves crashing on the rocky shores. Despite the wet conditions, they continued their journey.|"['1.

On November 8, 1805, the explorers faced a challenging day. The cloudy morning brought rain, delaying their departure until 9 o'clock. Traveling close to the starboard side, they encountered high hills and rocky shores. Three Native Americans in a canoe approached to sell salmon. Passing old villages, they entered a narrow area with shallow water called the Shallow Nitch. Despite the rain, they managed to hunt for geese and ducks. The group faced a difficult camp setup due to the encroaching tide and limited dry land. The following days brought more rain, high waves, and challenges with the salty river water. Despite the hardships, the explorers remained cheerful and eager to continue their journey into the unknown ocean.|"[""1.

Later, five Indians arrived in a canoe, showcasing their impressive navigational skills. The weather worsened with strong winds and rain, making their situation uncomfortable. The explorers managed to purchase fish from the Indians, providing a welcome meal. The following day, the storm intensified with thunder, lightning, and hail, posing a serious threat.

On November 14th, 1805, the weather was harsh for Lewis and Clark's expedition. Heavy rain and strong winds prevented them from moving. A canoe was damaged by the waves. Five Indians arrived in a canoe, reporting seeing the men sent ahead. Colter, one of the men, returned, stating he couldn't find the others due to the rough waters. The rain persisted, making the situation uncomfortable. Lewis, Drewyer, and others set out to search for the missing men. The rainy weather continued for eleven days, causing distress. On November 15th, the wind calmed briefly, allowing some drying of bedding and inspection of wet supplies.

Around 3 o'clock, the wind calmed, and the river grew still. I quickly loaded the canoes and departed from the dreary marsh where we were trapped for six days. We were unable to move forward, return to a better place, or even go hunting due to the lack of food and constant rain. Passing the turbulent point, I found a beautiful sandy beach with a small stream. Near this stream lies a deserted village of 36 houses infested only with fleas. Here, I encountered G. Shannon and five Indians. Shannon warned me of thievery among the Indians, as they had stolen rifles from him and Willard the night before. As the tide rose and the ocean waves grew too high for our canoes, I set up camp on the highest ground to wait out the rough seas. The journey by water seemed to end here, with no sign of the island marked on Vancouver's map. The bay below, known as Haley's Bay, was visible, and I decided to treat the Chinook Indians with caution due to their previous theft attempts. Our progress today was limited to three miles. On this fine Saturday morning, I ensured our belongings were dried after being exposed to the dampness. The five thieving Indians left, and I took a meridian altitude reading. I sent out hunters to gather food, while the sea looked ominous due to strong winds from the southwest. An Indian canoe passed by loaded with roots, and several more Indians arrived, whom|['1.

On November 18th, 1805, Captain Lewis and several men explored the coast near Cape Disappointment. They discovered a peculiar flat fish resembling a turtle with fins and a notched tail. The fish, known as a Flounder, had a white side and lay flat on the ground. The explorers marked their names and the date on a tree. They continued towards Cape Disappointment, passing rocky hills where waves crashed fiercely. The coast was shallow, with a sandy bar at the mouth of the river. The men, in good spirits, expressed a desire to winter near the falls. The next day, November 19th, it rained as they journeyed through thickets and hills. They saw a deep bend in the coast and a sandy bar. Captain Lewis marked a pine tree and observed a dead sturgeon and whale remains.

Many dark brant were seen flying southward, while the white brant remained stationary. The strong wind from the southeast, combined with the rising tide, created immense swells and waves that almost reached our camp. The morning was dark and disagreeable, a surprising climate. The weather has been temperate since passing the last falls, with only a change from fair to rainy and windy conditions. A chief named Tow-wall, who resides at the great chute, was met. A blue cloth coat was given in exchange for a belt of blue beads. Rain began at noon, hindering our journey with strong winds and high waves. The local women sported openly with our men, a custom viewed as a necessary evil by the natives. Their attire consisted of bark petticoats, short robes, and various ornaments like beads and brass wire.

On November 23, 1805, Captain Clark noted the positive behavior of the Clatsop Nation towards their party. The men hunted three bucks despite the rainy weather. They marked their names on trees near the camp. In the evening, seven Clatsop Indians offered sea otter skins for trade, but the prices were too high. The Indians were from a large nation that had been devastated by disease, similar to the Chinooks. The next day, November 24, the party interacted with the Chinook Nation, trading blue beads for a sea otter skin. They prepared for winter, relying on hunting for sustenance due to the high prices of native provisions.

On the 30th of November 1805, the explorers faced challenging winds at their campsite, causing smoke to be bothersome and irritating to their eyes. The shore below their camp was adorned with beautiful pebbles of various colors. While there were few small birds around, they spotted numerous wild fowls like buzzards, eagles, hawks, ravens, and crows. Additionally, they saw blue magpies and small brown birds. The area was teeming with snakes, lizards, bugs, worms, spiders, flies, and insects. Despite sending out men to explore the surroundings, they struggled due to thick woods, marshes, and lakes obstructing their path. The explorers returned and camped by a freshwater creek, observing an abundance of different bird species. The day saw some rain and hail, with intervals of fair weather, as the men hunted for food and dried their belongings.|"[""1.

On December 10, 1805, a cloudy and rainy morning greeted explorers along the sea coast. They encountered Indigenous people who explained their reliance on fish washed ashore by the tide for food. The explorers shot ducks and brant for a meal, impressing the locals with their muskets. The Indigenous people were eager to trade for fish hooks but showed little interest in red beads. The explorers also found various shells by the sea. Despite the rain, they continued building huts for winter. The next day, they faced challenges with fleas in their bedding. Indigenous visitors traded roots and a sea otter skin for fishing hooks and tobacco.

On December 21, 1805, it rained all night and continued moderately throughout the day. The men were working on the houses. An Indian was caught stealing a horn spoon and left the camp. Two men were sent to the open lands for Sackacome, used to mix with tobacco for smoking. The next day, December 22, it rained without interruption. They finished four huts, the punchin floor, and bunks. Some men were sick with boils and bruises, and much of the meat spoiled. On December 23, there was thunder, rain, and hail. They were busy with the huts, and two canoes of Indians arrived. The men bought mats, bags, a panther skin, and liquorish roots. They exchanged fish hooks, a file, and pounded fish for these items. On December 24, they were still working on the huts despite the rain. Cuscalar, a young chief, brought mats and roots as gifts. They declined the gifts due to not having files to give in return. On Christmas Day, December 25, there were showers of rain and hail. The men divided tobacco and gave gifts. The Indians left, and the party moved into their huts. Captain Lewis gave Clark a present, and they spent the day drying wet goods.|"['1. What was the weather like on December 21, 1805?\nA) Sunny\nB) Snowing\nC) Raining\nD) Windy\nE) Foggy', '2.

On December 26, 1805, it rained heavily and thundered last night, continuing throughout the day with strong winds from the southeast. Joseph Fields made a table and seats for the group. They had to dry their wet items and rid their blankets of fleas, which had been causing sleepless nights. The men faced challenges with wet gunpowder and smoky conditions. The next day, December 27, the rain persisted, and the men worked on chimneys and bunks. A Chief and four men from the Clatsop nation visited, and hunting teams were sent out. The group traded with the locals for licorice-like roots and dried berries. The spoiled elk meat due to warm weather and rain made the roots a welcome addition to their diet.|"['1.

On the morning of December 30, 1805, a hard wind and some rain were followed by fair weather and brief sunshine. Four Indians from the upper villages offered roots, but their expectations for gifts were much higher than the actual value. Despite this, the Indians stayed all day. Hunters returned with four elk, providing a sumptuous supper of elk tongues and marrow bones. The completion of the fort was celebrated by informing the Indians that the gates would be shut at sunset. The Indians left before the gates closed, showing improved behavior. The day was mostly cloudy with only three rain showers. Flies and insects were active, snakes were still visible, and various birds thrived in the nearby creek and bay.

On January 1, 1806, at Fort Clatsop, the commanding officers established guard duties for the completed fort. The guard, consisting of a Sergeant and three privates, would be relieved each morning at sunrise. The new guard's post was designated in the sergeants' rooms. The centinel was to be stationed on the parade in front of the commanding officer's quarters day and night. If needed, the centinel could move around the fort to monitor potential threats. The officers emphasized treating natives kindly and forbade abuse unless provoked. The sergeant would manage the meat house and secure canoes daily. The rules also covered tool usage and borrowing protocols. The passage highlights the importance of maintaining order and security in the fort.|"['1.

On January 3, 1806, Chief Como-wool and six Clatsops visited our camp at 11 A.M. They brought roots, berries, three dogs, and fresh blubber for sale. The blubber was from a whale that had died near the Callamucksz village. The Indians considered this blubber excellent food. Our party had been surviving on dog meat and had grown fond of it, finding it to be a healthy and nourishing food. Some hunters returned after an unsuccessful trip, having only killed one deer and a few fowls. Captain Lewis gifted Chief Como-wool a pair of satin breeches, which pleased him greatly. The next day, on January 4, the visitors left, showing that they were friendly but cautious traders. They would bargain for a long time before settling on a deal.|['1.

On January 4, 1806, Comowool and the Clatsops departed from our camp in the morning. The Chinook and other nearby tribes have been friendly but may steal if they think they won't get caught. They are skilled traders and love to haggle for a deal. Captain Clark set out on January 5, 1806, to obtain whale blubber from the Indians. The party had been making salt and trading with the locals. On January 6, 1806, Captain Clark embarked on a canoe expedition with the group, including Charbono and his Indian wife. The local tribes are talkative and curious, with a focus on trade, food, and women in their conversations. Women in these tribes participate in many tasks, including gathering food, and their opinions are respected. In contrast, some other tribes abandon their elderly when they can no longer keep up during hunting trips.|"['1.

On January 7, 1806, Captain Clark embarked on a journey up the South fork of the Creek, crossing a fallen pine tree used by Saltmakers. The team waded through water and reached the ocean, walking along a sandy beach to a beautiful river. Near the river, they encountered an old village of Clatsops. Inside one of the houses, they found a man, two women, and three children living in poor conditions. Captain Clark hired a man to ferry them across the river named after the Clat Sop nation. They saw a unique fish species called a Thornback. Later, they climbed a high mountain where they met Indians carrying whale oil and blubber. The Indians showed them white earth used for painting and porcelain. Despite the challenging terrain, they continued their exploration, encountering more native tribes and trading for supplies.|['1.

The party was exhausted after crossing a mountain and four steep, slippery points, as well as a stony and tiresome beach. The high tide forced a late start, during which a raven and a gull were shot. The locals were intrigued by this. They favored large blue and white beads, files, and large fish hooks. After lunch, they crossed a creek in a small canoe and camped on the opposite side. A pin was paid for the ferry service. An incident occurred where an Indian tried to harm a member of the party for his clothes. The situation was diffused, and the night was spent with heightened caution. The next day, a breathtaking view of the ocean and coast was observed, with the sighting of a whale skeleton near a village where the natives were processing blubber. Communication was attempted with the locals to learn about their customs and lifestyle.|['1.

The Clatsops, Chinooks, and other tribes have unique burial practices. They place their deceased in canoes upright on split timber posts set in the ground. The canoes are carefully wrapped in skins and placed on crossbars within a larger canoe. The entire structure is then wrapped in mats and secured with bark cords. Various items like clothing and utensils are placed on the crossbars. Traders from England or America visit these tribes, exchanging goods like guns, blankets, and cloth for animal skins and seafood. The natives value blue and white beads as currency. Despite their cultural differences, the tribes share a common language with the traders, indicating a level of communication. The tribes are known for their inquisitive nature and engaging conversations about trade, food, and their women.|['1.

In some societies, the treatment of elderly individuals and women is a reflection of how they contribute to the community. When both men and women participate in procuring food, respect for the elderly and women is more pronounced. However, in communities where men are solely responsible for providing sustenance, older individuals and women may receive less attention. Nature may have been less generous in creating strong family bonds for the elderly, making civilization crucial for their well-being. For instance, among certain tribes like the Sioux's and Assinniboins, elderly members who can no longer keep up with hunting expeditions are sometimes abandoned by their families. However, in some villages like the Mandan, elderly individuals are cared for and respected. Civilization plays a significant role in ensuring the comfort and care of older community members.|"['1.

The coast near Clarks Mountain is eroding rapidly, with massive sections collapsing into the ocean. The hills and mountains are made mostly of yellow clay, which is now slipping away due to heavy rains over the past two months. The area around Fort Clatsop is dense with various species of pine, fir, arbor vitae, and black alder. Some of the pines can grow up to 210 feet tall and 7 to 12 feet in diameter. On January 10, 1806, I left Sergeant Gass at the salt-making site and set out at sunrise. We crossed a river, encountered Kil a mox Indians, and met hunters who had killed elk. We divided the meat and returned to the fort by sunset, encountering Chief Shahhar-wah cop and other Cath'-lah-mah Indians. They traded wappato, dried salmon, and mats. The natives enjoy smoking tobacco in a unique manner, inhaling deeply before exhaling through their nostrils and mouths.

On Sunday, January 11th, 1806, a party was sent to retrieve an Elk killed on the 9th. They returned with it in the evening, but some hunters came back empty-handed. The Indian Canoe was found missing due to negligence, carried off by the tide. Despite search efforts, it couldn't be located. The loss was significant as it could carry three men and 12 to 15 hundred pounds. The Cuthlahmahs left for the Catsops to trade wappetoe for whale blubber. Trade among river natives involves bartering goods, even reaching distant tribes. The next day, the canoe remained lost, efforts to find it failed. Drewyer's hunting skills were crucial as he returned with seven Elk. Meat distribution was changed due to wastefulness. Lewis and Clark detailed the trade dynamics and native interactions in the region.|"['1.

The people who live near the river are divided into different groups. First, those living along the Sea Coast to the southeast and northwest of the river's entrance are mentioned. The Clatsops, Kilamox, Chinooks, and Chiltch reside in these areas. Secondly, the Cath-lah-mah, War-ki-a-cum, and Skil-lutes act as traders between the Sea Coast nations and those living further inland. The E-ne-churs, E-chee-lutes, and Chil-luck-kitte-quaws live along the river up to the great falls and prepare pounded fish for market. The trading bay is safe and well-equipped, with fish, water, and wood readily available. The traders exchange European items for dried and pounded salmon with the native tribes. The traders are believed to be English or American, visiting the river for trading and hunting purposes. The natives trade elk skins, otter skins, beaver pelts, and fish for guns, blankets, cloth, and other goods brought by the traders. Blue and white beads are highly valued by the natives and serve as a common form of currency.|['1.

On January 15, 1806, Captain Lewis had a large coat made from Tiger Cat skins and those of a small unknown animal, obtained from the Indians. It required seven robes to complete the coat. Despite plans for hunting parties, heavy rain postponed the activity. The indigenous tribes, like the Chinnooks, Clatsops, and Cath lah mahs, use various tools for hunting such as guns, bows, deadfalls, snares, and spears. Their bows are meticulously crafted from white cedar with sinew backing and elk sinew strings. Arrows are made of two parts, often with a barb of stone, iron, or copper. The hunters keep their powder in tin flasks, and their quivers are usually made from young bear or wolf skins. The tribes employ deadfalls, snares, and gigs for trapping different animals like wolves, raccoons, and sea otters.|"[""1.

On January 16, 1806, the expedition team finished curing the meat. No significant events occurred that day. They had plenty of elk beef and a bit of salt. They decided to stay until April 1st. Even though they could travel further, attempting to proceed before April would be dangerous due to deep snow in the plains of Columbia during winter. The team was content with their situation and provisions. The local Clatsops and Chinnooks used various fishing methods like straight nets, scooping nets, gigs, and hook and line. They made nets and lines from silk-grass or white cedar bark. The team also interacted with the Clatsops, who brought roots and berries for sale. The Clatsops preferred blue beads for trade and used wooden bowls, baskets, spoons, and spits for culinary purposes.|['1.

On January 17, 1806, Chief Comowool and 7 Clatsops visited our camp, offering roots and berries for sale. We traded a mockerson awl and thread for some of their goods. One of them wore three Sea otter skins, which we desired, but he only wanted blue beads in exchange. The natives value these beads greatly. Colter hunted a deer, a rare treat for us. The Clatsops and Chinnooks build timber houses that can house multiple families. The construction involves posts, beams, and boards, with a central fire pit. The natives also make baskets from cedar bark and grass, often ornate and used for various purposes. The houses are well-structured and adapted to their needs, showcasing their resourcefulness and skills in traditional architecture.|['1.

On January 18, 1806, the Clatsops returned to retrieve a dog they had left behind. They spent some time with the expedition before leaving. The men were busy preparing for the journey back by dressing skins for clothing. The houses of the Clatsops, Chinnooks, and others were constructed using timber. These houses were quite spacious, ranging from 14 to 20 feet wide and 20 to 60 feet long. They accommodated multiple families, with some houses even hosting three or four families in one room. The construction involved sinking posts into the ground, raising them vertically, and connecting them with beams to form the structure. The houses had partitions made of boards and were roofed with poles and boards covered with cedar bark. The rooms had fireplaces in the center, with mats spread around for sitting and sleeping. The houses were well-organized, with shelves for storing goods and chattels.|['1.

In 1806, families in Clatsop tribes lived together harmoniously, sharing provisions. The elder wasn't always the family head; this role often fell to a younger man. Each family acknowledged its chief's authority, earned through service and respect. Chiefs weren't hereditary and had limited power. Laws were customs shaped by local conditions. The Clatsops visited the explorers to smoke pipes. The explorers issued 6 lbs. of elk meat per person, lasting only 2.5 days. Despite low provisions, the group remained calm due to hunting skills. The Indians shared insights on trade. Native roots like thistle, fern, and rush were vital for sustenance. The Clatsops, Chinooks, Cathlahmah's, Skillutes, and Kila moxs consumed pounded fish. The explorers were skilled hunters, adept with rifles.|"['1.

In January 1806, two hunters returned with three elk. A group was sent the next morning to retrieve the meat, while the hunters were to continue. The indigenous people departed around noon. One of the roots consumed by the natives is from a thistle plant called shan-ne-tahque. It is fusiform, 9 to 15 inches long, and resembles a sweet potato in taste. The root is white and crisp when freshly dug, turning black and sugary after preparation. It thrives in rich, sandy soil. The plant has simple, hispid stems and green leaves. The flower is dry, and the pericarp resembles that of a common thistle. The plant grows to 3 to 4 feet tall. The meat retrieved by a party was poor, and salt supplies were low. There are three types of ferns in the area, with one having a root that the natives eat. This root is cylindrical, with a pungent flavor, and is considered nutritious by the indigenous people.|['1.

On January 22, 1806, the expedition party faced challenges with their meat supply and the need for salt. The men hunted in the woods while the salt supply ran out. The natives in the area ate the roots of three species of ferns, with one producing no flowers or fruit but being consumed for its green color. Licorice in the region grew abundantly in sandy soil and was roasted by natives. The root of the thistle was also consumed after being processed. The most valuable root, the Wappetoe, was traded in the valley. On January 23, 1806, the expedition dispatched members for a salt supply and faced difficulties in dressing elk skins due to the lack of branes for soap production. The root of the rush was a solid bulb used by natives and grew abundantly along the coast.|['1.

The native people use a strong stick to dig roots. It is three and a half feet long, sharpened at the lower end, and has an elk or buck's horn at the upper end serving as a handle. The stick is transversely inserted into the horn, forming a tool for digging. The Clatsops assisted in transporting meat to the Fort in exchange for elk and deer flesh and skins. Witnessing Drewyer's marksmanship impressed the Clatsops, especially with the rifles' accuracy compared to their guns. The air-gun also amazed them, as it shoots without powder. The natives use various roots for food, like liquorice and Wappetoe bulbs, which are essential for trade. The Clatsops departed, and hunters returned with reports of their activities, including making salt and subsisting on whale meat. Native fruits and berries like Shal-lun and Sol'-me are common in the area. The language and culture of the distant bands along the coast differ slightly from the Clatsops and other known tribes.|"['1. What is the purpose of the strong stick described in the passage?\nA.

The native fruits and berries used by the Indians in this area include the Shallun, a deep purple berry like a small cherry, and the Sol me, a small pale red berry. There is also a vineing or low brown berry, a light brown berry resembling a black haw, and a scarlet berry the size of a small cherry from a plant called Sac a commis. The Canadian Engages carry the leaves of this plant for smoking. The Shallun berry is similar to a huckleberry, attached to shrub boughs, and easily gathered. The shrub grows 6 to 8 feet tall, mainly in swampy or marshy areas. The bark is reddish-brown, and the leaves are thick, firm, and glossy. The natives eat the berries fresh or dried, sometimes pounding and baking them into loaves. This bread is then mixed with cold water and eaten.|['1.

"The berry known as ""solme"" by the natives is produced by a plant similar in size and shape to the one found in the Atlantic states that bears the berry commonly known as Solomon's seal berry. The solme berry is attached to the stem in a globular form and contains a soft pulp enveloping three to four seeds. When unripe, the solme berry is not speckled like the Solomon's seal berry. The plant grows in woodlands among moss and appears to be an annual plant. The solme berry is white, firm, smooth, and about the size of a small grape seed. The natives use certain plants like Labelia roots and Sumac decoctions for various medicinal purposes. The wood of the tree that produces the solme berry is very hard and is used by the natives for making tools and canoes."|"[""1.

On January 28, 1806, Drewyer and Baptiest Lapage went hunting while Howard & Werner returned with salt around noon after facing bad weather and difficult roads. They reported that the Salt makers were struggling for food, having only caught two deer in six days, with no Elk nearby. Another group sent for Elk returned with only three due to snow covering the animals. The river near Fort Clatsop is now called Netul. A tree with light-brown berries resembling wild Crab apples is commonly used by the natives for wedges and ax handles. The bark of this tree is chewed like tobacco. On January 29, 1806, the group had lean elk meat with salt for food. The Sac a commis berry, found in piney woodlands, is tasteless to some but a staple for the locals. The evergreen shrub produces berries that are dry and can be stored all winter.|['1.

On January 29, 1806, the explorers had a simple meal of lean elk boiled with water and salt. They had run out of whale blubber. Despite the plain diet, one of the explorers mentioned having a keen appetite that made the meals interesting. The local Native Americans wore conical hats made of cedar bark and beargrass, woven intricately to repel rain. The hats had various figures on them, often depicting whales, canoes, and harpooners. The natives preferred carrying double-edged daggers for various tasks like cutting fish and making arrows. The explorers also observed the growth and characteristics of the Sac-a commis shrub, which produced tasteless berries used by the local tribes. The shrub had thin bark layers, oval leaves, and spheroid berries with hard seeds. The berries were eaten raw or dried for later use.|['1.

On February 1st, 1806, a group of men embarked on a journey with Joseph Fields. Meanwhile, Sergeant Gass led another team to search for an elk that had been killed earlier but lost in the snow. The canoes used by the locals along the lower Columbia River are skillfully crafted to ride high waves. These canoes, usually made of white cedar or fir, have gunwales that fold outwards to prevent water from entering. Crossbars, inserted through holes in the canoe, help in lifting and maneuvering them on land. The natives always bring their canoes ashore, even when heavily loaded. Some canoes can be over 50 feet long, carrying thousands of pounds or up to thirty people. The paddles used are thin and shaped uniformly, enabling efficient navigation. There are four main types of canoes used by the indigenous people along the river, each serving different purposes and sizes.|['1.

The indigenous people in the region have a unique way of crafting canoes. They use a chisel made from an old file, about an inch or an inch and a half wide, to carve the canoes out of solid sticks of timber, usually arborvitae or white cedar. The canoes are then strengthened with crossbars attached with cedar bark thongs. The gunwales, which fold outwards at the upper edge, help prevent water from entering the canoe. The canoes are light, well-adapted for riding high waves, and can carry a substantial weight. The natives take great care of their canoes, which are prized possessions. The canoes are steered by one person in the stern using a paddle, while others paddle over the gunwales. These canoes are essential for travel and transportation in the region, especially since they are built to withstand rough waters and are crucial for subsistence and defense in a land inhabited by indigenous peoples.|['1.

The Native Americans in the area have limited tools, mainly using a chisel made from an old file to craft canoes. Despite the rudimentary tools, they can create canoes in just a few weeks. Lewis and his team have been unable to obtain canoes from the locals for their journey up the river. They carefully store their ammunition in lead canisters to keep it dry. The canisters have been effective in protecting the powder, ensuring they have enough ammunition for their 4,000-mile journey through Indian territory. The locals engage in various games of skill and chance, including a game where they hide a small object in their hands and bet on which hand it's in. These games provide entertainment and help pass the time during their expedition.|"['1.

On Wednesday, February 5th, 1806, a hunter fired his gun near the Netul swamp across from the fort and hollered. Sergeant Gass and a group of men were sent over and, taking advantage of the high tide, they navigated a small creek towards the highlands. Luckily, they found and recovered the long-lost Indian Canoe. The hunter, Reubin Fields, reported killing six Elk to the east of Netul. He also mentioned that Shannon and Labuishe had fired multiple shots, indicating they might have bagged more Elk. Fields also brought a pheasant that closely resembled those found in the Atlantic states. Additionally, Fur No. 2, a spruce tree common in the area, was described in detail, highlighting its characteristics and features.|['1.

On Thursday, February 6th, 1806, I sent Sergeants Gass and Ordway along with R. Fields and a group of men to retrieve the Elk that Field had hunted. Later that evening, Sergeant Pryor came back with the meat from about 2 Elks and 4 skins. Unfortunately, the Indians had taken the rest of the Elk that Drewyer had killed earlier. I discovered that there are two villages of Indians living on the north side of the Columbia near the Marshy Islands who identify themselves as Wackki-a-cum. I had previously thought of them as Cath-lah-mahs. They speak the same language and are alike in every other way. There is a type of fir tree, similar to the balsam fir of Canada, growing here. It can reach considerable size, with a diameter of 2.5 to 4 feet and a height of 80 to 100 feet. This tree produces an aromatic balsam similar to the Canadian balsam.|['1.

On February 6, 1806, during the expedition, Sergeant Gass and his team were sent to retrieve an elk killed by Ru Field. Later, Sergeant Pryor returned with fish from two elks and four skins as the Indians had taken the rest of the elk Drewyer had hunted. The expedition encountered various tree species, including a fir tree similar to the balsam fir of Canada. This fir tree grows to significant heights and produces an aromatic balsam. Another fir species observed was smaller and did not yield balsam or much resin. A third fir species had thin, dark brown bark and produced minimal rosin. The expedition also came across the white pine, which had unusually long cones compared to those found in Virginia. These tree species were identified based on their leaves, bark, and wood characteristics.|['1.

On February 7th, 1806, at Fort Clatsop, some members of the expedition returned with elk meat. The rest of the group stayed back to bring the remaining meat to a meeting point by the river the next day. They enjoyed a hearty supper of elk marrowbone and brisket. The area was rich with honeysuckle, elder, and huckleberry plants. The smallpox had devastated the local Native American population, with hundreds falling victim to the disease. The expedition observed deserted villages along the river and coast, likely abandoned due to the smallpox outbreak. This event highlights the impact of diseases on indigenous communities in the region.|['1.

On Saturday, February 8th, 1806, several events unfolded during the expedition. Sergeant Ordway and two men were dispatched to reunite with Sergeant Gass's party to retrieve the remaining elk meat from R. Fields. Upon their return in the evening, they brought back the flesh of five elk, with one being spoiled and unsuitable for consumption. Later that day, Sergeant Pryor arrived with Shannon Labuish and their group from Netul, carrying the meat of four elk they had hunted. The explorers enjoyed a meal of elk tongues and marrow bones. Additionally, the expedition leader made a botanical discovery concerning a shrub and fruit previously misidentified as the Shallon.

The leaf of this shrub is oval, measuring 4 and 3/4 inches in length and 2 and a half in width. It has a petiole that is short, only 3/8 of an inch in length, and cylindrical with a slight channel on its upper side, often red. The leaves are undivided, slightly serrated, and terminate in an acute point. The upper side of the leaf is a glossy deep green, while the underside is a pale green with veins. The shrub is evergreen, and its fruit is a deep purple berry about the size of a buckshot or common black cherry. Each berry is supported by a separate cylindrical peduncle of half an inch in length. The cone of the fir tree in the marshy ground is oval, tapering to a point and composed of thin, red-brown, imbricated scales. The bark of the black alder tree is smooth and light-colored with white spots, similar to that of the beech tree. The leaves of the black alder are acerose, firm, stiff, and end in a short, pointed hard tendril.

The stem of the black alder found in this country is simple, branching, and diffuse. The bark is smooth with light color and white spots similar to beech. The leaves are like those of the common alder in the United States. These trees grow separately from different roots, not in clusters. They shed their foliage around December 1st. In the same area, there is a tree resembling white ash without its leaves. The stem is simple, branching, and diffuse. The petiole is smooth and 7 inches long, with leaves 8 inches long and 12 inches wide. The tree grows up to 40 or 50 feet high with fruit like a winged seed. Another tree in the region looks like a smaller white maple, often growing in clusters with long, slender twigs and leaves with acute angular incisions. The petiole is smooth and 1.25 inches long. The trees are around 15 to 20 feet high and 6 to 9 inches in diameter.|['1.

In the Columbia River region, there are two distinct trees commonly found. The first tree, resembling the white ash, has a simple branching stem and petiolate, plane, scattered palmate lobate leaves with repand lobes ending in acute angular points. The tree can grow up to 50 or 60 feet high, with a diameter of 2 to 3 feet. Its fruit is similar to a winged seed like that of a maple. The second tree, resembling the white maple, is smaller with a diameter of 6 to 9 inches and a height of 20 to 30 feet. Its petiolate, plain, scattered nearly circular leaves have acute angular incisions and crenate points. The bark is smooth, and the twigs are long and slender. The leaves are smaller, at 3 inches in length and 4 inches in width. The fruit of this tree remains unknown. These trees are native to the region and have unique characteristics that set them apart.|"['1.

On February 11, 1806, Sergeant Gass, R. Field, and J. Thompson went hunting near Netul. Sergeant Natl. Pryor and four men paddled a canoe to bring Gibson to the fort. Colter and P. Weser went to the Salt works with Joseph Field. Due to illness, Bratten was advised to return to the fort. A shrub commonly found in the area has woolly leaves resembling a rose raspberry. It grows on steep hillsides and moist lowlands, reaching 5 to 6 feet in height. Another green bryor species thrives in dry, rich lands near water courses. Its stem can be the size of a finger and grows upright before arching down. The bryor has sharp thorns and is often found near water sources. The green bryor retains its foliage until late December. Lewis encountered two evergreen shrubs near the Columbia River, growing in dry, rich soil near watercourses. Their leaves are compound and oppositely pinnate with thorns.|['1.

On Wednesday, February 12th, 1806, a Clatsop man visited the fort and brought three dogs as a gift for elk they had stolen previously. However, the dogs ran away. The man stayed overnight. Two types of evergreen shrubs were discovered, one with leaves resembling Mountain Holly and the other with compound leaves similar to the purple raspberry. The shrubs grow in rich, dry soil near watercourses. The stem of the first shrub is erect, while the second has a procumbent stem with sharp thorns. The large fern grows up to 4 feet tall and has lanceolate leaflets with a woolly underside. The small fern remains green all winter and has shorter leaflets. The area near the Quick Sand River is abundant with these plants, making it difficult to pass through. The natives consume the roots of one type of fern.|['1.

In the area, two types of ferns are commonly found, the large and small ferns. The large fern can grow up to 3 to 4 feet tall and has a stem that rises directly from the base, covered with numerous black capillary roots. The leaflets are lanceolate, smooth, and deep green in color, with around 110 to 140 leaflets on each stem. On the other hand, the small fern grows about 8 inches long with leaflets that are oblong, convex, and also deep green. The grass in the region is coarse and sedge-like, growing in tufts, especially near the coast and in salt marshes. The natives use bull rushes and cattail flags for making mats and bags to carry their food and belongings. Additionally, the Clatsop tribe left the explorers on February 13th, 1806, and preparations were made for the abundance of small fish expected in March, likely herring. Some evidence suggests the presence of white settlers at Nootka Sound or northwest along the coast.|"['1. What distinguishes the large fern from the small fern described in the passage?\nA.

On February 14th, 1806, the explorers were anxious about their sick companions at the salt works. Sergeant Pryor and his team had not returned, causing concern. Meanwhile, Drewyer had a successful day trapping a fat beaver, providing a feast for the group. Captain Clark finished mapping the terrain from Fort Mandan to their current location, noting various rivers and mountains. The explorers realized they had discovered a practical route across North America, predominantly by land due to navigational challenges on some rivers. The safest path was identified from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, avoiding treacherous rapids and falls. This journey was made possible through a combination of celestial observations and local knowledge, leading to a more secure passage across the continent.|['1.

On February 15, 1806, Drewyer and Whitehouse went hunting towards the prairies of Point Adams. Hunters over the Netul fire heard several shots, but no news came from them. In the afternoon, Bratton returned from the salt works and shared that Sergeant Pryor and his group were on their way with Gibson, who was weak and had to be carried in a litter. Pryor's delay was due to strong winds making it hard to navigate the creek. Later, Pryor arrived with Gibson, who was not as ill as feared. The team believed Gibson's sickness stemmed from a cold while hunting elk. Quadrupeds in this area include domestic animals like horses and dogs, plus native wildlife such as bears, deer, wolves, and more. Horses are mainly found among the tribes residing in the Columbia plains, and mules are highly valued by the Indians. Wild horses roam the plains, and mules are often stolen from Mexican Spaniards.|"[""1.

On February 15, 1806, Drewyer and Whitehouse embarked on a hunting expedition towards the southwest mountains. They heard gunshots from the Netul fire but had no updates on the hunters. In the afternoon, Bratten returned from the Saltworks, reporting that Sergeant Pryor and Gibson were on their way, with Gibson in poor health. Pryor's delay was due to strong winds hindering their progress. Pryor arrived later with Gibson, who, though ill, was not as bad as feared. The animals in this region range from domestic horses and dogs to native wildlife like bears, elk, deer, and wolves. The indigenous tribes in the Columbia Plains own horses, prized for their speed and endurance. Horses are abundant and inexpensive, making them valuable for trade expeditions. Mules, highly valued by the tribes, are often stolen from the Spaniards in New Mexico.|"['1.

On February 18th, 1806, an expedition was sent to the Salt works led by Sergt. Ordway. Another party, under the guidance of Sergt. Gass, went after eight Elk caught near Netul. However, the waves were too high for Sergt. Ordway to reach the entrance of a Creek. Two members returned with a single Deer, noting that the Elk's meat was lean but improving. The group interacted with Clatsop and Seven Chinnooks, acquiring a Sea otter's Skin and hats made from tape and silk grass. These visitors departed, leaving behind an ax they had taken. Whitehouse presented a robe made of Tiger Cat skins. Descriptions of the unique Tiger Cat were shared, highlighting its distinctive features. The Elk skins were divided among the groups for future use. On February 19th, 1806, Sergt. Ordway embarked for the salt works by land, while Sergt. Gass returned with Elk flesh and skins. The recovery of the sick was slow but showing progress. The passage also discussed the characteristics of common red deer and Black-tailed fallow deer found in the region.|"[""1.

On February 19, 1806, Sergeant Ordway embarked on a journey to the Salt works by foot. In the evening, Sergeant Gass returned with the meat of Eight Elk, leaving one Skin with Shannon and Labiche who stayed back to continue hunting. The skins were divided among the groups to prepare for covering baggage in the upcoming Spring. The sick members are slowly gaining strength, with Bratten receiving medication that did not work. The black Fox, also known as a Fisher, is found in the woody regions along the coast. Their name is misleading as they don't prey on fish. They are agile climbers, chasing squirrels and raccoons. The Silver Fox is rare, mostly seen in the woody areas below the Great Falls of the Columbia. It has a beautiful silver-grey fur. The large red and Kit foxes inhabit open plains, while the common red or grey fox is found in the woody regions. On February 20, 1806, Collins hunted but returned empty-handed, bringing cranberries for the sick. The Chief of the Chinooks, Tdh-cum, visited with 25 men, receiving food and tobacco. The Chief was pleased with a small medal gifted to him. Despite their friendly demeanor, the group was asked to leave at sunset to avoid any potential treachery, as caution is crucial when dealing with the natives.|['1.

The Mule deer found under the Rocky mountains near the Chopunnish nation are similar to those in the plains of the Missouri. It is uncertain if they inhabit the interior of the great plains of Columbia or near the lower border close to the mountains. The Elk, common throughout North America, is found in both timbered lands and plains, with a larger population in wooded areas. The large brown wolves on the Pacific Ocean near the Columbia River resemble those from the Atlantic States and are found in woody regions. The large and small wolves of the plains are mainly in open areas and woodland borders, displaying similar habits to those in the plains of the Missouri. The group was visited by a Chinnook chief and his men, emphasizing the importance of caution due to potential treachery, as interactions with natives have been both friendly and dangerous historically.|['1.

The Tyger Cat, a wild feline found near the Pacific Ocean, resembles the wild cat but is larger and more ferocious. Its reddish-brown fur with dark spots, white belly, and striped legs make it a striking creature. The Black Fox, also known as the Fisher, despite its misleading name, does not prey on fish but hunts squirrels and raccoons. It is agile and skilled at climbing trees. The Silver Fox, a rare beauty with a silver-grey coat, is a sight to behold. The large red fox and the Kit fox are common in the open plains. The red fox of the United States also thrives in the woody regions along the coast. Native Americans use the Tyger Cat's skin for robes, and the explorers continue their journey, encountering various wildlife along the way.|"['1.

In 1806, Lewis described the wolves of the Pacific Ocean's woody areas, contrasting them with the wolves of the open country near Missouri. The Clatsop women visited, offering cedar bark hats decorated with beargrass. The women's craftsmanship impressed the explorers, who bought the hats. The Clatsops also mentioned the arrival of small fish, likely herring. Chief Comowooll was reported to be trading wappetoe upon his return. The explorers faced challenges as a canoe almost drifted away but was rescued. The sick members of the group were recovering from colds and fevers. Additionally, Lewis discussed the antelope found in the Columbia plains and the sheep in the Rocky Mountains, noting their wool and hunting practices. The beaver and otter were also mentioned in relation to native hunting and fishing activities.|"['1.

On Saturday, February 22, 1806, two Clatsop women and two boys visited the explorers. They brought hats made of Cedar bark, beautifully decorated with bear grass. Lewis and Clark had asked for hats earlier, and these fit perfectly. The group bought the hats and shared them. The Clatsop people showed remarkable skills in woodwork, sculpture, and crafting waterproof baskets. In the evening, Drewyer went with the visitors to get dogs. The women shared news about fish running, possibly herring. Chief Conia Comawool was trading wappatoe and planned to trade with the explorers. Some of the group were sick, but most were recovering. The explorers learned about Antelopes and Sheep in the Rocky Mountains. The next day, Sunday, February 23, 1806, the group continued their journey, with most recovering from sickness.|['1.

The sea otter is a fascinating animal found along the sea coast and in saltwater. When fully grown, it can be as large as a mastiff dog. They have small ears and eyes, with the ears being less than an inch in length, fleshy, and covered in short hair. Sea otters have a tail that is about 10 inches long, thick at the base, tapering to a sharp point, covered in deep fur. Their legs are short, with broad, webbed feet that have five toes each. The body is long and uniform in thickness, measuring over 5 feet from nose to tail. Sea otters have a dark brown, glossy fur that is considered one of the richest and most delicious in the world. The young otters have lighter fur, especially around the nose, eyes, ears, and forehead. The mink, another animal found in woody areas along the coast, is similar to those on the Atlantic coast. Seals are also abundant in the area, with different species present, though details of their differences are not well known. Overall, the sea otter is a remarkable creature with unique features and valuable fur.|"['1.

On February 26, 1806, the expedition sent out teams to replenish their food supplies. Drewyer and two men were tasked with fishing for sturgeon and anchovy in the Columbia River or buying fish from the natives. Meanwhile, Shields, Jo, Field, and Shannon were sent to hunt elk along the Netul, and Reubin Field and another man were to hunt towards the prairies and Point Adams. The expedition was running low on provisions, with only three days' worth of inferior dried elk meat left. The team also learned about the Clatsop and Chinook animal, a small creature abundant near the Columbia's falls and rapids. The natives used its skin for robes, describing it as having short, thin, pointed ears, a reddish-brown coat, and a tail that was short and flat. Despite efforts to obtain a live animal for study, the expedition was unsuccessful.|"['1.

On February 28, 1806, Reubin Fields and Collins went hunting early in the morning. A Clatsop man named Kuskelar and his wife visited, bringing Anchovies, Sturgeon, a beaver robe, and roots for sale, but they asked high prices. We only bought part of a Sturgeon with fishing hooks. They stayed overnight. Shields, Jos. Fields, and Shannon returned late, having killed five Elk, two on a distant mountain. We told them to hunt early the next day. The hunters said Elk were plentiful about 9 to 10 miles away. Kuskelar brought a dog Cruzatte bought. The hare in this area is only found on the Columbia Plains, weighing 7 to 11 pounds. Their measurements were detailed. The Pole-cat is common in the region, especially near the Columbia's great falls.|['1.

On February 28, 1806, the explorers had a busy day. Reuben Field and Collins went hunting early in the morning near the Netul River. A Clatsop man named Kus ke-lar, along with his wife and a young boy who was his slave, visited the explorers. They tried to sell various items like anchovies, sturgeon, beaver robe, and roots, but their prices were too high. The explorers only bought part of a sturgeon in exchange for fishing hooks. Later, hunters returned with five elk they had hunted, two from a faraway mountain. The explorers planned to continue hunting the next day.

On Saturday, March 1st, 1806, the expedition team set out to retrieve elk meat from the hunters. They returned with three elks' flesh later in the evening. A boy, around 10 years old, was with Kuskelar, who mentioned the boy was his slave, captured by the Killamucks from a distant coastal nation. The team classified birds into Terrestrial and Aquatic categories based on their habits. The Grouse or Prairie hen, found in the Great Plains of Columbia, has pointed tails with longer feathers in the center. They have unique toe features with scales aiding in snow traversal. These birds feed on grass, insects, and various seeds. The Indians in the area consume the root of the Cattail or Cooper's flag, which is nutritious and white in color.|"['1.

On March 2nd, 1806, during their expedition, the explorers faced challenges with their diet. The sick among them were slowly regaining strength with a diet limited to lean elk meat. The local natives, on the other hand, consumed the nutritious root of the Cattail plant, which tasted pleasant and seemed to be rich in nutrients. The explorers were delighted when their companions returned with a generous supply of fat sturgeon, fresh anchovies, and a bag of Wappato, a type of edible root. They feasted on the anchovies and Wappato, enjoying the bounty. Additionally, the explorers encountered the Heath Cock, a bird found abundantly in the Plains of Columbia.

The large Black & White Pheasant is unique to the Rocky Mountains area near the Columbia River. We only spotted them upon reaching the river and have not seen them since leaving the mountains. They are similar in size to a well-grown hen and resemble the reddish-brown Pheasant common in our region. Their tail consists of 18 dark brown feathers tipped with black, while their body feathers are a mix of dark brown, black, and white, with black being the most dominant color. The birds have a distinct appearance, often likened to the domestic fowl called dommanicker. They lack tufts of long feathers on their necks and have a space on each side to adjust their feathers easily. These pheasants have dark eyes, black beaks, and feed on wild fruits like the sac-a-commis berry and pine and fir seeds. They are usually found in small groups and have superior flesh compared to other Pheasant species.|['1.

In the Rocky Mountains, the Small Speckled Pheasant is smaller than the black and white pheasant, with more black and less dark brown feathers. It travels in larger groups and is quite gentle. There is a general mix of white across its body, making it distinct. Despite the size difference, its round body is similar to the larger pheasant. The flesh of both these party-colored pheasants is dark, and when cooked properly, they can be flavorful. The brown pheasant in the same region is similar in size and habits to the speckled pheasant, with a yellow stripe above its eye. Its color is a mix of dark and yellowish brown, resembling a darker common quail. The brown pheasant's flesh is preferred, with breast meat as white as the Atlantic coast pheasant.|['1.

The small Brown Pheasant is a native bird of this region and is similar in size and shape to the Speckled Pheasant. It shares the same habits and lifestyle as the Speckled Pheasant, with a barely noticeable yellow or orange stripe above its eye, unlike the vermillion stripe of the Speckled Pheasant. The Brown Pheasant has a uniform mix of dark and yellowish brown feathers with a hint of brownish white on its belly and under the tail, resembling the Common Quail but darker. This bird also has booted toes. The flesh of the Brown Pheasant is acceptable, with the breast being as white as the Pheasant found on the Atlantic coast. The Crow, Raven, and large Blackbird in this area are comparable to those in our region, with the Crow being smaller but having the same call. The Hawks, Crows, and Ravens build nests in large numbers along the high cliffs of the Columbia and Lewis rivers. The large brown Hawk, Small or Sparrow Hawk, and an intermediate-sized Hawk with blueish wings are common here, with the latter being known as the hen Hawk in the United States. The large hooting Owl found under the Rocky Mountains has a slightly deeper color than those in the US. The natives here preserve Sturgeon by smoking or pickling the Anchovy, which becomes tainted quickly otherwise.

On March 4th, 1806, the expedition journal detailed the Native American methods of preparing and cooking fish. The anchovy, a delicate fish, was smoked or pickled to avoid spoilage. The natives would hang them in the smoke of their lodges to dry them. Sturgeon was cooked using a unique method involving hot stones and vapor, resulting in a better flavor than boiling or roasting. The expedition also noted various bird species in the area, including turtle doves, robins, magpies, woodpeckers, and cranes. The following day, March 5th, the explorers interacted with the Clatsop tribe, traded for fish, and devised plans to procure more food due to a scarcity of elk meat. They intended to stay at Fort Clatsop until April, exploring the woody country for subsistence.|['1.

On March 5, 1806, the Corps of Discovery faced challenges with dwindling provisions and elusive elk. The hunters returned empty-handed, reporting the elk had moved to distant mountains. To secure food, they sent parties to trade with the Clatsop Indians and hunt in different directions. With plans to ascend the Columbia River slowly, they hoped to find sustenance in the woody country, avoiding the barren plains. Despite the hardships, they observed various bird species in the region. The next day, on March 6, they received a visit from Comowoll, who brought cured anchovies, a welcomed addition to their diet. Despite injuries and slow recoveries among the group due to limited food supplies, they pressed on, facing the challenges of the unknown territory.|['1.

On March 8, 1806, during the Lewis and Clark expedition, Bratten's health improved with less back pain. Collins returned early, reporting three Elk kills, two saved, and one in a pond. Drewyer and Jos. Field hunted Elk, while Labiesh retrieved meat from others. Shields, R. Field, and Frasure returned empty-handed. McNeal and Goodrich recovered from illness. The White Brant, common in marshes, is larger than the brown brant and smaller than the Canadian goose. Its plumage is white with black wingtips. The brown brant resembles the Canadian goose but has darker plumage and pieded appearance. Both have dark flesh, with the white brant's meat preferred. Their habits are similar, with the brown brant less common in winter. The brants are similar to those on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.|['1.

The Small Goose in this country is smaller than the Brant. Its head and neck, like the Brant, are larger in proportion compared to the goose. Their beak is also thicker and shorter. The notes they make are more similar to those of our tame geese. In all other aspects, they are the same as the large Goose, with which they often associate. At first, it was challenging to determine if this goose was a distinct species. Now, without hesitation, I declare them a separate species. The large Goose is the same as the one common to the Ohio and Atlantic coast, known as the wild or Canadian Goose. The small Swan is the same as the one common in the Atlantic States. It differs only in size and its call, which cannot be imitated accurately. The call starts with a whistling sound and ends in a round, full note louder than the whistling part. It is as loud as the large swan's call.|['1.

On Sunday, March 9th, 1806, the explorers set out early to search for elk. Bratten complained of back pain but felt better in the evening. Some party members hadn't returned due to windy conditions. Three Clatsop men visited, selling a dog, fish, and a sea otter skin. They stayed overnight. Shields made elk skin sacks for important items. The large swan seen was common in various states, while the smaller one had a unique whistling note. Ducks like the Duckinmallard were abundant, and a delicious duck similar to the Canvasback was found in the region. The red-headed fishing duck was common, feeding on crawfish. The black and white duck, similar to those on the Ohio River, had beautifully variegated colors.|['1.

On March 10, 1806, around 1 P.M., the weather cleared up, and we sent out two groups of hunters near Netul. One party went above the Netul, and the other below. We also instructed a group to start early the next morning, passing Meriwether's Bay to hunt beyond Kilhow anak kle. We are hopeful as we haven't explored much in that area yet. The wind blew strongly all day, and in the evening, the Indians left. The hunters reported a fir tree, possibly reaching 300 feet, with no significant branches for about 200 feet. They also described the brown duck, resembling the duckinmallard but smaller, with a uniform mix of yellowish and dark brown. The black duck, about the size of a bluewinged teel, is dark black with lighter breast and belly. They have an erect stance on shore, with dark brown legs and feet. These ducks are common above and below the river's tide water. Their diet includes grass, seeds, roots, and moss. The divers in the area are similar to those found in the Atlantic states, with a smaller species having white feathers around the rump and no visible tail. Their flesh is not suitable for consumption as they feed mainly on fish.|"['1. What time did the weather clear up on March 10, 1806?\nA) 12 P.M.\nB) 1 P.M.\nC) 2 P.M.\nD) 3 P.M.\nE) 4 P.M.', ""2.

On March 12, 1806, the expedition party set out again to search for a canoe but returned without success. A hunter sent out on the Netul side did not return by evening. The group now had 358 pairs of moccasins, along with shirts, elk skin capotes, and other supplies for the journey back. They encountered various fish species like whales, porpoises, flounder, and salmon. The Indians hunted whales for blubber and oil. Reptiles in the area included rattlesnakes, garter snakes, and lizards. Snails were abundant in the wooded areas. Water lizards were also spotted. Elk horns were observed to vary in growth. The next day, March 13, 1806, some members of the party returned with elk and deer meat. They interacted with Cathlahmahs and sent Drewyer to buy canoes. Despite unsuccessful searches for a lost canoe, hunting for elk continued, and some members were still out on a hunting expedition towards Point Adams.|['1.

The Porpus and Skaite are common on the coast and in brackish waters. The Indians gig and eat the Porpus, but I find its flavor disagreeable. The Skaite is also found in saltwater, some washed ashore by the tide. Flounders are seen on the beach too, and the Indians enjoy eating them. These species are the same as those on the Atlantic coast. The Salmon and red Charr are found in both sea and rivers. The Salmon, weighing 5 to 15 lbs, extends into rivers, vital for the natives. Their body is colored with black spots, and their roes are dried and preserved. The red Charr are broader than Salmon, with large scales. Their flesh, roes, and appearance are similar to Salmon.

The Mountain or Speckled Trout inhabit the waters of the Columbia within the Rocky Mountains. They are similar to those found in the upper Missouri River but are less plentiful in the Columbia. The Bottle Nose fish is also present in the Columbia's mountain waters. On March 14, 1806, a group was sent to retrieve two Elk hunted by Collins the previous evening. Collins, Jos. Fends, and Shannon set out to find more Elk, with many shots heard in the evening indicating successful hunting. Reubin Fields and Thompson returned with only one Brant. Later, Drewyer arrived with Clatsop traders offering a canoe, hats, and roots for sale.

On Saturday, March 15th, 1806, the hunters returned with only four elk after Labuish, the main hunter, had some mishaps with his gun. The elk were scattered, so two groups were sent to retrieve them. They came back with four skins and the meat of three elk, but one had gone bad due to the liver and pluck being left in the animal overnight. Later, Delashshelwilt, a Chinnook Chief, visited with his wife and six women, bringing goods for trade. They were the same group that had caused health issues in November, so precautions were taken.

The white salmon trout, previously only seen at the Great Falls of the Columbia, has now appeared in the creeks nearby. An Indian brought one today, caught with a gig. It was 2 feet 8 inches long and weighed 10 lbs. The eye is moderately large, with a black pupil and silvery white iris mixed with yellow. The fins are small in proportion to the fish, boney but not pointed except the tail and back fins. The back fin and ventral ones have ten rays, gills have twelve, and the tail has twelve. The tongue is thick with small teeth. Neither this fish nor salmon are caught with hooks, and their diet remains unknown. This new arrival adds to the diversity of marine life in the region.|"['1.

On March 17, 1806, preparations were made for departure. Canoes were readied, but weather concerns delayed the journey. Drewyer returned with a purchased canoe and one recovered from the Cath-lah-mahs. The exchange involved a uniform coat, tobacco, and negotiations. The team sought another canoe without success. A proposal to trade for a stolen canoe was considered. The following day, Drewyer fell ill with side pain, and others showed signs of sickness. Canoes required repairs, but rain hindered progress. Visitors from the Cathlahmah and Comowooll were hosted overnight. Delashelwilt received a certificate of good conduct and departed with his group. Lists of names were distributed to natives and posted for public record. The purpose was to document the exploratory journey through North America and the return route to the United States. Plans were outlined for the journey back, acknowledging the challenges of reporting back to the U.S. through the coastal traders.|['1.

The preferred adornment of both genders are the typical coarse blue and white beads. Men wrap them tightly around their wrists and ankles until they reach a width of three or more inches. They also wear them in large rolls around the neck or hanging from the nose or earlobes, which are pierced for this purpose. Women wear them similarly but do not pierce their noses. They also like a type of wampum provided by a trader named Swipton. This wampum is in its natural shell form without any preparation. The shell is conical, slightly curved, about the size of a raven's quill at the base, tapering to a point with a hole for a thread. It is white, smooth, hard, thin, and worn like beads. Men use one shell horizontally through the nose cartilage, acting as a ring to prevent chafing from other ornaments. Both men and women wear bracelets made of copper, brass, or iron. Men also wear bear claw necklaces, while women and children wear elk tusks on their necks and arms. Both genders wear bracelets, and men partake in domestic tasks like cooking, cleaning, and construction, which are usually associated with women in other Indian tribes. Women gather roots and make items from rushes, flags, cedar bark, bear grass, or waytape. Both genders manage canoes and perform various tasks. Feasts are prepared and served by men.|['1.

The men from these nations share more of the household chores than initially thought. They gather fuel, cook for visitors, clean, and help with fish. They build houses, make canoes, and wooden tools. Women collect roots, make items from rushes, flags, and bark, and craft hats and robes. Both genders manage canoes and many other tasks typically done by women in Indian cultures. Men prepare their feasts. The weather delayed their departure, so they postponed sending hunters. They have ample provisions and hope to wait comfortably. The group has met all objectives at Fort Clatsop except trading with local merchants. Despite some illnesses, they expect improved health once they resume their journey. Gun repairs were necessary, but the group's preparedness ensured all weapons are now functional.|['1.

On March 24, 1806, the Lewis and Clark expedition encountered the Cath lah mah Village. They bought wappato and a dog for their sick men. The village had large canoes adorned with sea shells, which the natives claimed were the teeth of their enemies. The explorers found the place dirty and smelly. They continued through narrow channels to an old village on the south side, where they camped near a burial site. Two Indians visited them, one speaking some English. The next day, March 25, 1806, was cold, so they delayed their departure. They met Clatsops offering dried fish and informed them of their trading voyage. They observed the winter foliage and encountered locals fishing for sturgeon. Despite the wind, they made slow progress along the river, eventually finding a safe spot to camp for the night.|"['1.

On Tuesday, March 25, 1806, the Lewis and Clark expedition faced challenging weather conditions as they traveled up the river. They encountered Native American tribes such as the Clatsops and Cathlahmahs, who offered to sell them various goods like fish and Wappato. Despite the wind and tide working against them, the explorers decided to wait until the tide turned in their favor before continuing their journey. They visited a fishing camp of the Cathlahmah tribe and purchased a sea otter skin. The day ended with a difficult search for a suitable campsite due to swampy terrain, but they eventually found refuge in a creek. The next day, Wednesday, March 26, 1806, the group continued their exploration, meeting important figures among the Cathlahmah tribe and trading for supplies like fish and Wappato. The expedition faced challenges with dwindling tobacco supplies, prompting the men to find substitutes.

On March 30th, 1806, the Lewis and Clark expedition encountered various Native American tribes along the Columbia River. They met with the Clan-nar-min-a-mon, Clackstar, and Cath-lah-cum-up tribes residing on Wappato Island. The natives gathered Wappato from the fertile island's ponds. The expedition traded fishing hooks for food with the tribes. The Shoto tribe, living near a pond, also interacted with the explorers. The tribes in the valley had similar customs to coastal tribes but differed slightly in language and appearance. The women wore leather breechcloths, and the men were stouter. The tribes traded Wappato for goods with coastal natives. The expedition faced challenges like adverse weather and a strong river current but managed to cover 22 miles. They spotted Mt.

On April 1st, 1806, the expedition team was busy with various tasks. Sergeant Pryor and two men were sent up the Quick Sand River in a small canoe to explore the area and return by evening. Three hunters were dispatched to hunt in a large woodland area above the river entrance. Other team members were sent in different directions for hunting. Those at camp were making a rope from elk skin. The team received confirmation from various Native American tribes about the Quick Sand River. Sergeant Pryor reported back in the evening, mentioning that the river was about 300 yards wide but only 50 yards deep at one point. The river had a rapid current and was not navigable due to falls and rapids. The team was concerned about future food supplies as the natives they encountered were struggling with food scarcity. They decided not to wait for the salmon run and planned to head to the Chopunnish Village promptly. Hunters returned with elk and deer meat, indicating abundant game in the area. The team also bought a canoe from a Native American but the deal was later canceled and the beads returned.|"[""1.

On Wednesday, April 2, 1806, the expedition decided to stay in their current camp until they had enough dried meat for their journey to the Chopunnish. They planned to trade their boats for canoes with the locals along the way to the great falls of the Columbia River or buy canoes from them using elk skins and goods. The canoes would then be exchanged with the plains natives for horses to travel overland. They intended to send a small group ahead to gather horses near the entrance of the S.E. branch of the Columbia River. The explorers were visited by natives in canoes who shared information about a large river, the Multnomah, south of their location. Captain Clark set out to explore this river with a guide. The day was busy with hunting, gathering wood, and drying meat. The night was spent peacefully with a local family near the camp.|['1.

The Multnomah River enters the Columbia River 142 miles from its mouth at the Pacific Ocean. While I was away, many canoes with men, women, and children approached our camp. At one point, there were around 37 individuals in our camp. Captain Lewis used his air gun to surprise and maintain order among them. About 10 canoes arrived at the camp that day, all sharing stories of food scarcity upriver. One family stayed overnight and behaved well. On the 3rd, Joseph Field returned with news that they had killed four elk. Captain Lewis sent Sergeant Pryor and two men with Field to dry the elk meat. The Indians kept visiting our camp with their families, appearing hungry and picking up leftover meat scraps. Some wore unique clothing made of deer skin. On April 4th, Sergeant Ordway was sent to find Sergeant Gass's party, which returned with bear and venison meat. Collins discovered a bear den with cubs and planned to hunt the mother bear. Native parties from above and below visited, some for curiosity. Later, a group was sent to hunt upriver, and observations were made with a sextant.|"['1.

On April 6th, 1806, two Indians arrived at our camp late at night and stayed until morning. We packed up all the meat and loaded our canoes early to set out. After a quick breakfast, we embarked and traveled about 9 miles to Gibson & party's camp. They had hunted 3 Elk nearby and wounded two more. A group of six men, led by Shannon, went to retrieve the Elk. We set up camp and prepared a scaffold to dry the meat upon its arrival. Reubin Field spotted a unique bird of the Quail species near our camp. Its striking features included a dove-colored blue back, dark brick red under its beak, and a white stripe separating the colors. The bird's eyes were black, and it had long black feathers extending from the crown of its head. The legs were covered in dark brown feathers tipped with brick red. This beautiful bird's loud call is distinct from that of a partridge or quail. At 6 P.M., Shannon returned with the flesh of five Elk, successfully drying the meat for our journey ahead.|"['1.

On April 11, 1806, it rained heavily, making it tough for Lewis and Clark's expedition. They decided to move the canoes first over a 2-mile portage, hoping the rain would stop. Despite the slippery road, they managed to pull up 4 canoes above the Rapids. The men were exhausted, so they postponed moving the 5th canoe. The rapids were now more dangerous due to the higher water level. Native people watched them closely, and some tried to steal from the expedition. One man even attempted to take John Shields' dog, leading to a tense moment. However, the chief of the Clah-clal-lahs Tribe intervened, showing goodwill by exchanging gifts. The expedition continued, facing challenges but also making connections with the native tribes.|"['1.

On Saturday, April 12, 1806, it rained throughout the night and into the morning. The team worked hard to move the remaining perogue due to the challenging rapids. Unfortunately, the perogue got caught in a strong current, and despite efforts, it drifted away. This loss might force them to buy canoes from the Indians at high prices. After breakfast, they transported their baggage over the portage, staying vigilant against potential threats. They interacted with the War-clel-lars tribe, noting differences in their language. By 5 P.M., all baggage was relocated, and the team encountered an old village during the journey. Despite rain and challenges, they persevered, making slow progress but ensuring their safety and supplies.|"['1.

On April 16th, 1806, Captain Clark crossed the river with interpreters and an Indian woman to trade for horses with the natives. Meanwhile, in the camp, hunters were sent out early, and work was underway to make pack saddles. The plan was to use twelve horses to transport baggage and a reserve of pounded fish for the journey to the Rocky Mountains. Plants used by the Indians were collected, including a different species of currant in bloom. New plants were also discovered. Various animals were brought in, including a large grey squirrel and a black pheasant. Despite efforts, no horses were traded yet. The expedition was at a point where timber ceased, and open plains extended towards the Rocky Mountains. Captain Clark had a lively evening with the natives, who seemed friendly. Antelopes were spotted, but no elk. Plans were made to trade with the Skillute village.|['1.

On April 17, 1806, I woke early and displayed my goods near the village to trade with the Indians. Many came from various directions, some from below, others from above, and some from across the country. I sketched the Columbia River and Clark's River. I initially bargained for 2 horses with the Chief, but the deal fell through as the horses had back issues. Later, I bought 3 horses from different sellers. Despite facing challenges with trading due to high prices, I stayed another night to trade with more natives. Some Enesher people promised to bring horses the next day. Despite doubts about their sincerity, I decided to wait. Shabono bought a fine mare, and we received a note from Capt. Lewis advising us on horse trading prices. The day ended with no other purchases made.|"['1. What did the speaker initially plan to trade for with the Chief?\nA) Beads\nB) 2 horses\nC) Sketched drawings\nD) Tools\nE) Food', '2.

On April 18th, 1806, I was invited into the house of the 2nd Chief where I decided to spend the night. The man was poor, with only dried fish to eat and no wood for a fire. Despite the cold night, they couldn't gather enough wood to make a fire. The next morning, we were visited by the principal chief of Chilluckkittaquaws and 12 others from his nation. They stayed until 9 AM, and then all but the Chief and two others left. We loaded our vessels after breakfast and set out. We gave the Indians a ride to the North shore where they live. We then had to unload our boats and canoes to make a 70 pace portage over a rock. Later, we reached the basin below the long narrows and landed on the left side. The Chief promised to bring horses to trade, and we decided to make a portage to the head of the long narrows with our baggage and five small canoes. In the evening, we returned to the camp at the basin.|"['1. What did the 2nd Chief offer the narrator for dinner?\nA) Dried fish\nB) Fresh fish\nC) Meat\nD) Vegetables\nE) Fruits', ""2.

On April 19, 1806, the Lewis and Clark expedition faced challenges at the Skil-lute village. They had to transport their baggage over a portage, a difficult task that took until 3 P.M. to complete. The villagers were excited about the arrival of salmon, a good omen for them. The natives shared the fish among the children to hasten the arrival of more. The expedition struggled to acquire horses from the natives, facing issues with trade agreements and pilfering. Despite difficulties, they managed to secure some horses but faced challenges keeping them under control due to the animals' restlessness. The expedition members had to be vigilant throughout the night to prevent the horses from escaping.|"['1.

On Saturday, April 19, 1806, the expedition team decided to transport their baggage and five small canoes to the head of the long narrows. The two large canoes were dismantled for fuel as they couldn't be taken further. By 3 P.M., all the baggage was carried over the portage with the help of pack horses. The camp was set up near the Skillute village. Due to a shortage of horses, a plan was made for a group to go to the Enesher villages to purchase more horses to ease the transportation of baggage. Despite encountering rain showers and strong winds, the team managed to reach the Enesher Village by 8 P.M. The natives were excited about the arrival of salmon, a good omen for them. The team also faced challenges with the locals being unreliable in trade agreements. On Sunday, April 20, 1806, there was frost, and observations were made on the clothing and lifestyle of the Enesher and Skillutes tribes. Their villages and customs were noted, highlighting their reliance on trade for clothing and resources. The Enesher people were described as proud, inhospitable, and untrustworthy.|"['1.

On the morning of April 20th, 1806, I encountered a group of natives who had stolen six tomahawks and a knife from our party overnight. Despite speaking to their chief about the theft, the items were not returned. Additionally, a horse I had bought the previous day had been gambled away by the seller and taken by a person from another tribe. Frustrated, I retrieved the goods and traded two elk skins for a gun with the chief. Unable to secure more horses, I decided to proceed the next day with what we had, using two small canoes to transport the baggage. We faced challenges in acquiring supplies from the locals, who demanded high prices for their dried fish. Despite this, we managed to purchase two dogs and some supplies.

On April 20th, 1806, I attempted to buy horses from the Enesher people, but they refused my offers. They demanded kettles instead of the items I had brought. The Enesher men promised to bring horses from a distance but never returned. Later, three men arrived, claiming they came to see me. As the day ended, Captain Lewis had not arrived, so we packed up and went into a lodge. The Enesher people seemed harmless. I bought a dog and some supplies. Despite my efforts, I couldn't purchase any horses from them. The Enesher people are well-dressed, with men wearing leggings, moccasins, and robes. The women's attire is similar to those above the great rapids. The children wear squirrel skin robes. The Enesher village is below the falls on the North Side. They trade with other nations for goods. The Enesher people live in large houses with mats and straw coverings.

In the evening, Captain Lewis did not arrive as expected, so I packed up our belongings from the campsite and returned to the lodge. Many gathered to smoke, and I shared two pipes with them before resting with the men. Despite precautions, one horse broke free, and some items were stolen. I ordered spare items burned to deter theft. A man was caught stealing and punished. I warned the natives not to steal or face consequences. At 9 A.M., the lost horse was found, and we departed. We met Captain Clark, who had not bought any horses and found the locals unfriendly. We traded for a new horse and continued our journey.

On April 21, 1806, at 4 PM, we loaded up and set out in canoes, traveling about 3 miles opposite to the Mouth of Clarks River. An Indian man who lent us a horse to pack and lived near the Rocky Mountains advised us to camp at a village of 9 lodges off the road near the River Clarks due to the day being far spent. We formed a camp, purchased wood, and traded pewter buttons for three dogs. We bought an old horse and secured all the horses for the night. The following day, on April 22, 1806, two horses broke loose but were recovered early. We set out at 7 AM, and Charbono's horse threw its load, running down a hill near a village. The horse disengaged itself, and an Indian hid the robe. After a search, Labuish found the robe hidden in an Indian lodge. We continued our journey, observing the vast mountain ranges and snow-capped peaks, including Mount Hood and Mount Jefferson.

On Wednesday, April 23rd, 1806, at daybreak, we discovered that the horses belonging to our Interpreter Charbono were missing because he had not secured them properly as instructed. Reubin Feilds and Labuish were sent to help recover the horses. One was found nearby, but the other was deemed lost. Reuben Feilds and Sergeant Gass left in the canoe at 8 A.M. Labuish and Charbono returned unsuccessfully after searching extensively. We decided to move on to the next village to avoid delaying our journey. We had packsaddles made while waiting. Traveling along a rocky riverbank for about 12 miles, we reached the Wah-how-pum Village with temporary mat lodges near Rock Rapids. The villagers sold us dogs and wood in exchange for items like pewter buttons and wire. A Chopunnish man offered horses for hire, but we chose to purchase them instead. The villagers performed a unique dance for us before we settled in for the night.|"['1.

After dinner, we continued our journey up the west side of the river, opposite two lodges of the Chopunnish Nation. We met Te-toh-ar-sky, the eldest of the two chiefs who had traveled with us to the Great Falls of the Columbia last autumn. Our old pilot, who had accompanied us down the river to the Columbia, was also there. The Indians suggested that we cross the river at this point and travel up the northeast side of the Kooskoske, as it was a shorter and better route to the forks of the river, where Twisted Hair lived. We decided to follow their advice and crossed the river with the help of three Indian canoes. We bought some wood, bread, and cows and camped after traveling 15 miles that day. The evening was cold, and many natives crowded around our fire, making it hard to cook or stay warm. At the Chopunnish lodges, I noticed a small lodge where their women stayed in certain situations, and men were not allowed to approach closely. They would stand far away and throw things towards the lodge.|"['1.

On May 6, 1806, during the Lewis and Clark expedition, the group encountered a helpful native who provided them with a young horse that was promptly butchered for food. The locals were more friendly that day, even selling them bread. Captain Clark tended to a sick woman who reported feeling better after his care. Many natives suffered from sore eyes, and Captain Clark spent hours treating them with eye-water. The group enjoyed a satisfying meal and traded horses with the locals. They met the Skeets-so-mish people, learned about a river called Clark's River, and navigated the Kooskooske River successfully. Despite a quarrel between two members of the group, they continued their journey, camping with local families along the way.|"['1.

The locals have a significant salmon fishery along Colter's Creek. This stream stretches to the piers of the Rocky Mountains and mostly flows through a densely wooded pine area. It is 25 yards wide and carries a large volume of water. The banks are low, and the bed is made of pebbles. A light rain shower occurred this evening. On Tuesday, May 6th, 1806, the husband of the sick woman kept his promise. He provided a young horse that was promptly slaughtered and butchered. The inhabitants were more cooperative, selling bread and exchanging a horse for medicine to treat a girl with rheumatism. Sore eyes were a common issue among the tribes west of the Rocky Mountains. The group met three men from the Skeetsso-mish tribe, who shared information about their location and customs. Captain Lewis traded horses and gifted a flag, fostering goodwill. They encountered disagreements among their party but eventually settled in for the night after a long day of interactions.|"[""1.

On May 7th, 1806, the expedition led by Clark embarked early, guided by a local, leaving behind another group. They crossed a river with the help of a canoe and received lost powder back from a kind local. The team then continued along a challenging path, passing through hills and enjoying the picturesque landscape. They encountered Neeshneparkeeook, who split off to visit his people. The group reached Musquetoe Creek, infested with insects, and camped near an old Indian site. The next day, they planned to hunt for venison. Snow-capped mountains loomed in the distance, delaying their journey back. The expedition observed various burial customs of the Chopunnish tribe and noted the sacrifices made for the deceased.|"['1.

On May 9, 1806, our journey through the fertile and open country near the Rocky Mountains brought us to the lodge of Twisted Hair. The lodge, made of sticks, mats, and dried hay, housed about 12 people. The area was rich with longleaf pine and had steep hills near water sources. The land, if cultivated, could provide an abundance of essential goods. The indigenous people here thrive on a variety of edible plants like Quawmash and Cows roots. These roots are collected, dried, and made into cakes or a nutritious porridge. The day ended with hunters rejoining us, bringing deer and pheasants. Despite losing some saddles, we managed to gather supplies and settle in for a cold, stormy night. Several Indians from the village of the Broken Arm also joined us, including an unwelcome acquaintance we chose not to engage with.|"[""1.

On May 10, 1806, the Lewis and Clark expedition faced challenging weather conditions as snow fell until early morning, leaving 8 inches of snow on the ground. Despite the slippery roads, the team continued towards the Chief's Village with a flag. Along the way, one member, Drewyer, went hunting and did not rejoin the group. Upon reaching Tin nach-e-moo-toolt's Village, the Chief welcomed them with food and hospitality, offering roots, bread made of roots, and a dried fish. The team requested to exchange old horses for young ones to eat, but the Chief declined, offering to provide the desired horses instead. The team shared a council with the Chiefs, discussing their situation and receiving medals. The hospitality of the Chopunnish Nation stood out to the team, as they were treated with warmth and generosity, a stark contrast to previous encounters on their journey.|"['1.

On May 12, 1806, a pleasant morning greeted the expedition led by Clark. A large group of Native Americans gathered around them as usual. After breakfast, Clark began treating various ailments, with nearly 40 individuals seeking help for sore eyes and other common complaints like rheumatic pains and back weaknesses, especially among women. The Native Americans held a grand council and then generously gifted each explorer a horse. In return, the explorers provided the chiefs with flags, powder, and balls. The natives expressed their unity in following the explorers' advice and their desire for peace with all nations. Clark administered eye treatments and basic medicines to many, while Captain Lewis addressed the Native Americans. The day was busy with medical assistance until late, and the explorers received more horses and gifts from the Native Americans.|"[""1.

On May 13, 1806, Captain C. tended to his patients until 11 a.m. At 1 p.m., they gathered their horses and headed towards the river, accompanied by native horseback riders. They followed the creek south-east for about two miles, passing a branch that joined from the right. They then entered an open bottom area near the Kooskooske River, moving north for 1.5 miles before stopping at the riverbank to meet a canoe. Despite the canoe's delay, they unloaded the horses to graze and spent the night waiting. The Chopunnish natives, who are strong and active, joined them. The natives enjoy activities like arrow shooting, horseback riding, and racing. They are skilled archers and riders, preferring practical items like knives and blankets over trinkets. Their clothing consists of long shirts, leggings, moccasins, and robes, adorned with beads and shells. Men braid their hair and wear animal skin collars, while women wear braided hair and caps made of beargrass and cedar bark.|['1.

Our camp was well-prepared with secure shelters made of grass to protect our baggage. Pine poles and brush fortified our little camp, while the party created comfortable tents with willow poles and grass. As the leather lodge was no longer usable, we relied on an old sail for shelter. The intense heat in the river bottoms contrasted with the cool air on the high plains. A mere fifteen miles away, the Rocky Mountains displayed a winter wonderland with deep snow. The changing climates amazed us, with summer, spring, and winter all within a short distance. Hohastillpilp and three old men returned to our camp without crossing the river due to the absence of a canoe. Reubin Fields spotted a large bear near camp, prompting a hunt, while others pursued different activities like hunting and exploring the diverse landscape. Some of our companions experienced health issues, possibly due to diet changes and the sudden climate variations.|['1.

On Saturday, May 17th, 1806, it rained heavily throughout the night and into the morning until 8 o'clock. The rain seeped through our flimsy shelter, soaking our bed completely. We lay in water for most of the night. Unfortunately, the chronometer I had been carrying for security in my pocket for the past ten days got wet. It was strange that only the fob where the timepiece was stored got wet, while the rest of my belongings stayed dry. I drained the water, aired it out, and wiped the works with dry feathers, then applied a bit of bear's oil. Despite some rust, the chronometer seemed to be working fine. At 9 a.m., Sergeant Pryor and Collins returned with the skin and flesh of a black bear Pryor had killed. Collins had also killed a large variegated bear, but his horse had run off. They preserved the meat from scavengers and decided not to retrieve the bear left in the woods. The grass and plants on the plains, despite being in bloom and tender, were unaffected by the snow. The rising river was attributed to melting snow from the mountains. The hunters were organized to go out and return only after hunting game. Despite moderate rain and snow on the mountains, no Indians visited us, a rare occurrence since leaving the Columbia Narrows. The icy barrier separating us from home is still covered in snow, but the natives predict it will be passable by|"['1.

On May 19, 1806, it rained until 8 AM when the weather cleared. We sent a group to a village across the river to buy roots to eat with our lean bear meat. The group was given tools like awls, knitting pins, and armbands for this purpose. Meanwhile, Joseph and R. Fields went up the river to find the horse used to cross the Rocky Mountains last fall. Later, several people from the village arrived at our camp seeking help for various ailments, including sore eyes and rheumatism. We provided eye drops, cathartics, and even 30 drops of Laudanum to help them. They left satisfied. In the evening, our group returned with roots and bread made from them. We also castrated some horses and enjoyed watching horse races. Despite hunting, no bears were found that day.|['1.

On May 24, 1806, the explorers faced challenges. A child was ill, its jaw and neck swollen. Remedies were tried, including a sweat treatment for a sick man named Brattin, which surprisingly helped him walk again. Hunting parties were sent out for food. The next day, May 25, 1806, it rained, and the child's condition worsened, needing more treatments. They attempted a sweat treatment for an Indian chief but faced difficulties. The explorers suggested traditional remedies to the Indians. Some went hunting for food, while others visited a nearby village.

On Thursday, May 29th, 1806, there was no significant movement within the group. They had an ample supply of meat and roots. Bratton was recovering quickly, along with the Child and the Indian Chief, who were also showing signs of improvement. The Chief had regained more use of his hands and arms, even managing to wash his face independently for the first time in over a year. The group intended to repeat the sweat ceremony, but the weather was cloudy with frequent rain. The French engage prairie buffalo lizard, known as the horned lizard, is native to these plains and those near the Missouri River. It resembles a black lizard but with a broader belly, shorter tail, and slower movements. This creature is brown with yellowish spots, and its belly and throat are light yellowish-brown. It often hides in sandy areas and emerges after rain showers. The Choke Cherry tree has been in bloom since the 20th of the month. It has oval leaves with serrated edges, green in color, and grows on ascending branches. The flower of the Choke Cherry has five white petals and numerous stamens.|['1.

The party encountered birds of the Corvus genus, unique to the Rocky Mountains and their surroundings. These birds are larger with a distinct call like a cat's meow.

On Friday, May 30th, 1806, Lapage and Charbono went to the Indian villages early to trade for roots. Sergeant Gass tried to get goat hair for saddle pads but couldn't cross the river. Shannon and Collins traded with natives for roots and bread, but their canoe sank, losing blankets and merchandise. Potts struggled to swim ashore. Sergeant Pryor failed to recover the sunken canoe due to deep water and strong currents. The chief's health improved after a sweat session. Joseph Feild returned after finding his lost horses and reported hunting deer. Various reptiles like rattlesnakes, lizards, and frogs were observed in the area. Different insects, including butterflies and silkworms, were found, but no honey bees. Different types of onions were discovered, with a specific species growing double bulbs with a sweet taste.|"['1.

On Saturday, May 31st, 1806, explorers Goodrich and Willard visited a Native American village in the morning and returned in the evening. Willard brought back a bear skin he had purchased for Captain C. The skin was a uniform pale reddish-brown color. The Native Americans informed them it was not a white bear but a Yack-kah. This distinction led the explorers to inquire further about the different bear species in the region. The Native Americans described the white and grizzly bears as Hoh-host, associating them as vicious bears that never climbed trees and had longer nails. In contrast, they called the black, brown, and light reddish-brown bears Yack-kah, noting they were smaller, climbed trees, had short nails, and were not aggressive. The explorers concluded that these were two distinct bear species. Later that day, Joseph and R. Fields returned with three deer they had hunted. The group also received another horse from the Native Americans, leaving only two of their original horses missing. The explorers now had sixty-five horses, mostly in excellent condition.|"['1.

On June 2nd, 1806, a trading trip was undertaken by McNeal and York across the river due to the depletion of their goods. They prepared for the challenging Rocky Mountains, recalling the hardships faced there in September. Buttons from their coats, eye water, Basilicon, Phials, and tin boxes with Phosphorus were given to the traders. Meanwhile, Collins, Shields, R & J. Fields, and Shannon went hunting. The horses had become wild, requiring the Indians' expertise to be caught. A pound was constructed to secure the horses easily. Drewyer returned with Neeshneparkkeeook and Hohastillpilp, recovering tomahawks. The Chopunnish bury their dead with stones and wood splinters. Horses are sacrificed to the deceased, a common practice in the Columbia plains. Salmon and roots were brought back by Sergt. Ordway, Frazier, and Wizer. The challenging journey took them through mountainous terrain filled with wildlife. The East Lewis's river branch was described as rapid and surrounded by high rocks and mountains. The fishery at Lewis's river had significant rapids. The men at the fishery were busy fishing while women collected roots. The horse was put out of its misery due to severe pain, while other horses recovered from castration.|"[""1.

On June 2nd, 1806, McNeal and York embarked on a trading journey across the river. With our supplies depleted, we resorted to all means to prepare for the challenging Rocky Mountains leg of our journey, where hunger and cold await travelers. The buttons from our coats, eye water, basilicon, and phials were given to the traders for their voyage. They returned in the evening with roots and bread, a successful trip akin to a merchant's cargo return. Drewyer arrived with Neeshneparkkeeook and Hohashillpilp, recovering stolen tomahawks. Sacrificing horses for the deceased is a common practice among the Columbia Plains tribes. Ordway, Frazier, and Wiser returned with salmon and cow roots, although some fish had spoiled due to the long journey. The men covered about 70 miles, encountering deer and big-horned animals in a mountainous, well-timbered area. The East fork of Lewis's river was described as a rapid, with solid rock banks and high mountains. The fishery house was 150 feet long and 35 feet wide, built of split timber. The men found the Indian method of guiding preferable.|['1.

On Tuesday, June 3rd, 1806, the group's recovering members showed progress. Bratton's strength improved, the Indian Chief was regaining limb function, and the child was nearly healed from an infection. The group encountered a bear with unique markings - black hair with a white spot on the breast. The Indians sent an express messenger to gather information from another tribe. Plans were made to move to the Quawmash grounds to hunt and stock up on meat. Concerns arose about the salmon supply for the journey. The group aimed to pass through the mountains in about twelve to fourteen days. The day ended with Shields returning with two deer. The next day, Wednesday, June 4th, the chiefs departed, and plans were made for future interactions with other tribes.|"['1.

On June 4th, 1806, three chiefs left the explorers to return to their villages. The chiefs were invited to join the journey to the Missouri River, but they declined until later in the summer. They planned to spend the upcoming winter on the east side of the Rocky Mountains. The explorers requested that young men accompany Captain Lewis to meet other Indian tribes. If successful, peace talks would be arranged. If not, the tribes would be informed to remain cautious. The Broken Arm chief invited the explorers to his village, offering roots for their journey. Shields returned with two deer. On June 5th, Colter and Bratton traded successfully with the Indian villages. The explorers continued treatments on the chief and a child, observing various grass species in the area. Rivers fluctuated due to snow melting.|['1.

Five Native Americans joined the hunt but returned empty-handed by noon. They left for their villages in the afternoon. Before departing, one of our men traded a horse with them. In the evening, the hunters went out again, directed to hunt further away due to scarce game near our camp. Whitehouse returned to our camp at Kooskooske in search of his horse. The Chopunnish prepare a plant called quawmash for food. It grows in open areas near pine or fir trees, with tunicated bulbs that are white, tasteless, and almost odorless when unprepared. The plant has blue flowers and is a significant part of the natives' diet.|"['1.

The camp was in a beautiful prairie with blooming quawmash flowers that looked like water from a distance. On Friday, June 13th, Reubin Fields and Willard were sent to hunt. Seven hunters returned with eight deer. Labuish and Cruzatte found a deer eaten by buzzards. An Indian traded horses and left content. The meat was dried in the sun. They documented Indian nations they encountered.|[]|[]
On Monday, June 16th, 1806, we gathered our horses, had breakfast, and departed at 6 A.M. We traveled about 2 miles up the creek through beautiful meadows filled with lush grass and quawmash. Crossing the creek, we climbed a ridge northeast for seven miles until we reached a small branch of Hungry Creek. Fallen timber slowed our progress, and it was 11 o'clock before we arrived. The area had some grass for our horses, so we stopped for them to graze and had lunch. The snow in hollows and on north hillsides was deep, up to three feet in places. Despite the challenges, we decided to continue our journey, navigating through a thick wood obstructed by fallen trees and deep snow.

On June 17th, 1806, the Lewis and Clark expedition faced a challenging journey. They encountered deep snow, making it difficult for their horses to travel. The team realized they needed a guide to navigate the treacherous terrain to reach the fish weirs at Colt Creek. Without food for their horses and the risk of losing vital supplies, they made the tough decision to turn back. They left some belongings behind and began their return journey, facing rain and uncertain weather. This setback marked the first time they had to retreat during their expedition.

On June 18th, 1806, the expedition faced challenges gathering their horses that had wandered far for food. Despite injuries and mishaps, they pressed on. Two men were sent to hasten the arrival of promised Indian guides. The group hunted for sustenance and rested at Collin's Creek. Despite unsuccessful fishing attempts, they hoped to subsist until the guides arrived. The hunters saw signs of bears but few deer. They prepared to fish for salmon the next day. The group was hopeful for the arrival of two young chiefs who were to join them on their journey back to the U.S. They settled in a pleasant spot with an abundance of food to sustain their horses.|"['1.

On June 20, 1806, the explorers set out early to hunt and gather food. They caught salmon trout and a bear, but the bear was skinny and not very tasty. The hunters warned that they were running out of food due to scarce game and difficult terrain. They decided to head back to the quawmash flats to stock up on meat before attempting to cross the mountains. If they couldn't find a guide, they planned to send a small group ahead to mark the trail. If successful, the main party would follow. If not, they would attempt a different route through Shoshone territory. The explorers faced challenges but were determined to reach their destination before winter. On June 21, they retraced their steps, facing obstacles like fallen trees and injured horses. They met two Indians who might help guide them over the mountains.|"['1.

On Sunday, June 22, 1806, the expedition members set out to hunt early in the morning. They had a successful day, managing to kill eight deer and three bears. Whitehouse was sent to the Kooskooske to get salmon from the natives. The day was pleasant with a cool evening and a nice breeze from the northwest. Unfortunately, Drewyer, Shannon, and Whitehouse did not return that evening. Potts had an inflamed and painful leg, so they applied a poultice made from the roots of Cowes.

On Thursday, June 26th, 1806, we embarked on an early journey after breakfast at 6 A.M. We retraced our path from the 17th of this month to our supplies atop the snowy mountain northeast of Hungary Creek. The snow had receded about four feet since our last visit, now measuring around 7 feet deep. While traversing the snow-covered terrain, we encountered and hunted two small black pheasants and a large speckled pheasant. These birds were notably quiet according to the indigenous people guiding us. After a long trek over steep snowy mountains, we finally reached a campsite with lush grass for our horses. Here, we were joined by a Native American man who sought to accompany us to the Missouri Falls. Additionally, we learned that two young men we had previously encountered were embarking on a pleasure trip to the Oatlash Shoots.|"['1.

On Friday, June 27th, 1806, we started our journey early with our horses. The road led us along the heights of a ridge we had traveled the day before, covering a distance of nine miles to our campsite from September 18th. About a mile before reaching the camp, we stopped on an elevated point at the request of the Native Americans and shared a smoke. At this spot, the locals had built a mound of stones and erected a tall pine pole. They shared that some men would go on foot to the fishery at Colt Creek to catch fish while the main group headed to the Quawmash glade on the Kooskooske river. The view from this point was breathtaking, with snow-covered mountains surrounding us. Our guides were invaluable as they led us through the disappearing snow, marking the way for us. We traveled 28 miles without resting or feeding the horses, relying on the guidance of the indigenous people.|['1.

Lewis and Clark encountered a unique animal in the plains of the Missouri, which they named the barking squirrel. This creature, weighing between 3 to 3.5 pounds, resembles a squirrel in shape but has a brick-red and grey fur, with a dominant red hue. The barking squirrel has short legs, a wide chest, and a stout, muscular head with a split upper lip resembling a guinea pig. They have sharp claws on their forefeet for burrowing and large whiskers. These squirrels live in large societies, each occupying several hundred acres of land with burrows that can be as deep as ten feet. When above ground, they sit upright and bark like toy dogs, keeping their village clean by grazing on grass and weeds. They hibernate in their burrows during winter and can eat grains or meat.|['1.

On July 2, 1806, two hunters were sent out and successfully killed two deer. The mosquitoes in the valley have been causing trouble day and night since their arrival, making it difficult to write without being bothered. They gave the second gun to their guides as promised, along with powder and ball. Most of the meat was dried to sustain the party in the mountains where they don't expect to find game. The rifles were checked and two were found to have burst near the muscle. They exchanged one with a short rifle with an Indian guide. Captain Lewis had a fall but luckily wasn't injured. They encountered a small grey squirrel and a common pheasant. The Indians and some of the men engaged in foot and horse races. The next day, July 3, preparations were made to implement their plans upon returning. They constructed rafts to cross the river and successfully transported their baggage. The Indians swam their horses across and created makeshift vessels to transport their belongings. Despite facing challenges, they managed to reach the opposite shore. Captain Lewis recounted a series of events involving the raft and a swim to shore. The party continued on their journey, guided by the Indians towards their destination.|"['1.

On July 4th, 1806, an Indian from the West side of the mountains arrived at our camp. He had followed and caught up with us. We sent out hunters early to get meat for the Indians who helped us but chose not to continue with us. We didn't want to send them away without enough food after their assistance. They plan to go down Clark's River to find the Shalees, their friends, and then return home. They prepared their meat for the journey back. We left around noon without having killed any deer. The Indians were returning through the same pass they guided us through, suggesting it was the best route. They expressed sadness at parting ways. We traveled through a plain, then entered the mountains, camping by a river with good grass for our horses. The evening was pleasant with no mosquitoes. Lewis, July 5, 1806.|['1.

On July 11, 1806, the day started beautifully with fair weather and lush grasslands after recent rains. The air was pleasant with a chorus of birds in the groves. The expedition set out early, with hunters sent to hunt Elk while the main party crossed the plains to the White Bear Islands. The area was teeming with buffalo, with the bulls roaring as they began to mate. The sight of thousands of buffalo was awe-inspiring. The hunters had a successful day, killing eleven buffalo for their skins and meat. The team prepared canoes from buffalo hides to cross the river, completing them by the next morning. Some horses went missing, suspected to be stolen, prompting a search party. Despite the windy conditions, they successfully transported their supplies across the river using the newly made canoes.|['1.

On Monday, July 21st, 1806, the explorers started their journey at sunrise. They encountered steep ravines on the north side of the river, causing a delay when a pack horse carrying instruments missed the ford and wet the instruments. Fortunately, the instruments were quickly dried with no damage. They then crossed to the south side and traveled about 3 miles before crossing back to the north side. They spotted a large herd of Elk but noticed that buffaloes were becoming scarce. By 2 P.M., they reached a narrow branch of the Marias River with clear water. They decided to follow this stream towards the mountains. Later, they camped near a clump of cottonwood trees in a beautiful river bottom, preparing to rest for a few days and make necessary observations. The rocky mountains to the southwest appeared low but were partially covered in snow. Despite the lack of timber, the river's volume had increased significantly. The explorers were now uncertain if the river would extend as far north as they initially hoped.|"['1.

On Tuesday, July 29th, 1806, a fierce storm hit the region, bringing rain, hail, thunder, and lightning. With no shelter, the explorer had to endure the elements all night. The rain persisted through the day, prompting a decision to halt when the weather cleared to dry their gear. Hunting was crucial for meat and elk skins to cover the canoes. Progressing swiftly down the river, they reached a significant part of the Missouri with natural walls. The party hunted bighorns, finding the meat akin to mutton. They encountered vast herds of buffalo but few elk. The day ended at a familiar campsite from the previous year. The river, swollen and murky, posed challenges.

On Friday, August 1st, 1806, while the rain persisted, we encountered a brown bear swimming from an island. After a chase, we successfully shot and killed it. Continuing our journey, we passed Musselshell River and reached an area with Indian lodges. Due to the rain threatening our bighorn skins, we decided to stop for the night to dry them. A white bear surprised us but was swiftly taken down. These bears are lean in summer due to their meat-based diet. We also hunted an Elk and preserved its skin and meat. The next day, August 2nd, the weather cleared, allowing us to dry our supplies and gear. The hunters bagged deer, and we eagerly anticipated reuniting with Captain Clark at the Yellowstone River.|['1.

On Wednesday, August 6th, 1806, a powerful storm hit the area. The storm brought thunder, lightning, hail, and heavy rain. The wind was so strong that it was hard to keep the small canoes from filling with water. Despite the challenging conditions, the canoes were not damaged. Seeking shelter from the storm, the writer rested on an elk-skin cover. The rain and wind persisted throughout the night, making the air cold. The next day, Thursday, August 7th, it rained until late morning. The group set out early to reach the Yellowstone River, facing cold and unpleasant weather. The journey was productive with sightings of game and natural features. They encountered bear, elk, buffaloes, and even white gulls. Upon reaching the Yellowstone River, they found signs of their fellow explorer, Captain Clark, and left a note for their companions to catch up before continuing their journey.|"['1.

On Friday, August 8th, 1806, I set out early in search of Captain Clark, believing he wasn't far ahead. We traveled swiftly despite the northeast wind, reaching the beaver bends by mid-morning. Not finding him, I decided to continue on, preparing our boats and clothing. The men were in need of warm clothing as they hadn't had time to make any since the Rocky Mountains. We camped by the river, battling pesky mosquitoes. The next day, Saturday, August 9th, was fair, and the men focused on dressing skins and making clothes. Some were sent to search for Captain Clark but returned without success. We faced challenges repairing our boats without pitch. By Sunday, August 10th, repairs were completed despite a brief rain.

On Sunday, July 6, 1806, the expedition faced a frosty morning after a cold night. They gathered their scattered horses, delaying their departure until 9 A.M. They then traveled up a creek, deviating from their previous route to ascend a ridge towards a dividing mountain. They followed the path of the Oatlash Shute band, observing blooming quamash and small timber damaged by fires. They saw old buffalo roads and squirrel burrows. The day led them through glades and across creeks, finally entering a vast, level plain where they encountered a storm. After drying off at camp, they noticed fresh Indian signs. The following day, July 7, 1806, they discovered that nine horses were missing, suspected stolen by Indians due to their high value. Despite searching, the horses were not found. The group split, with some continuing towards the canoes while others stayed behind to hunt for the missing horses.|['1.

In 1806, explorers ventured through a fertile valley teeming with edible plants and abundant beavers. They journeyed along Willards Creek, facing rugged terrain and cold nights. Horses scattered, causing a delay, but the party pressed on, reaching Snake Indian Cove after grazing. Despite a small fork in the path, they safely buried canoes and tobacco supplies. The explorers examined the damaged canoe and prepared for the next leg of the journey towards Jeffersons river. The landscape varied from dry plains to boggy bottoms, with snow-capped mountains in the distance. The explorers encountered diverse flora like hyssop and shrubs. Shields and Collins hunted deer while the party repaired canoes and searched for buried supplies. The explorers, undeterred by challenges, prepared to continue their expedition downstream.|['1.

On July 10, 1806, the day started with frost covering everything. The explorer, Clark, prepared canoes and packed supplies to head down Jeffersons River. They traversed through Sarviss Valley and Rattlesnake Mountain into the vast and fertile Beaverhead Valley, known as Har na Hap pap Chah to the Indians. The valley was teeming with beavers, otters, deer, and antelopes. Clark spotted big horn animals on the mountainside and decided to continue the journey by canoe, leaving the horses behind. The party encountered mosquitoes but found respite at the 3000 Mile Island. The next day, July 11, 1806, they hunted deer, geese, and a buck along the winding river despite facing strong winds. They camped near Wisdom River, where they found a lost bayonet and prepared to craft paddles from a spare canoe.|['1.

On July 12, 1806, as I journeyed down the river, a beaver was active nearby all night. In the morning, I made paddles and prepared to leave a canoe behind. The current intensified downstream, and the river straightened until Panther Creek, where it became more winding. The wind from the Snowy Mountains made navigation tricky. Our canoe was pushed under a log, trapping one man briefly. With effort, we freed ourselves and avoided further mishaps. Mosquitoes bothered us, but we still managed to hunt geese and beavers. The next day, we met with Sergeant Pryor and his group, who had killed deer and a white bear. We crossed rivers and continued our journey, encountering elk, deer, beavers, and otters along the way.

On July 14, 1806, we embarked on a journey crossing Gallatin River and navigating through a challenging beaver-dammed area. Despite the hindrances, we managed to find our way to an open plain resembling an island. The local guide revealed an old road leading to our destination. We encountered various wildlife like elk, deer, and antelopes, along with signs of buffalo. The Shoshone tribe's influence had shifted the buffalo population away from the plains. The day continued with sightings of deer and the exploration of different river channels. The journey on July 15, 1806, led us through mountain gaps and buffalo roads, eventually reaching the Rochejhone River after a 18-mile trek.

On July 16, 1806, during their journey, the group encountered various wildlife and geographical features. They saw a buffalo and a fat bull that they hunted for food and materials. The explorers faced challenges with their horses' feet on stony plains, but makeshift shoes helped. They observed elk, antelope, and bears, and noted the landscape's freestone rocks and blooming flora. As they continued down the river, they searched for trees large enough to make canoes. The next day, July 17, they encountered creeks, named Otter River and Beaver River, and camped near a small island. They noticed an Indian fort built the previous summer for defense against pursuers.

"On July 20, 1806, Sergeant Pryor and Shields were sent to explore the area for larger trees along the river. They returned without finding suitable trees for canoes. Instead, they decided to make canoes out of the available trees to travel down the river. Axes were sharpened, and the men worked on felling the trees until dark. Sergeant Pryor tended to some skins for clothing, and wounds were treated. The horses were given rest due to fatigue and sore feet. Shields, Shannon, and York hunted for food, including deer and buffalo. Meat was dried for preservation.

The next day, July 21, 1806, half of the horses were missing. Search parties were sent out, but the horses were not found. Shannon reported a large lodge downstream.

On July 22, 1806, Captain Clark expressed concern about missing horses, suspecting the Indians had taken them. Despite searching, the hard, dry plains made it impossible to find the horses' tracks. On July 23, evidence of Indian presence was found, confirming the theft. The horses' tracks were seen heading into the open plains. Captain Clark instructed Sergeant Pryor to take the remaining horses to the Mandans for safekeeping. The team finished making canoes and prepared to set out the next day. The plan was for Sergeant Pryor to meet the canoes at the entrance of the Big Horn River to continue the journey. The mission aimed to engage influential Sioux chiefs to visit the U.S. government, showcasing its strength and resources for better relations.|"[""1.

On Friday, July 25th, 1806, we began our journey at sunrise and made good progress for three hours. We spotted a large group of buffalo on the left bank and decided to stop to hunt. While some breakfast was being prepared, we hunted and gathered food. Shields also hunted two deer. After a delay due to the rain, we continued our journey. I discovered a remarkable rock, which I named Pompy's Tower. It provided a breathtaking view of the surrounding area, including two mountains to the southwest. I marked the rock with my name and date. We encountered Big Horn animals, and I managed to hunt two. The men collected the animals while I examined a fish rib embedded in the rock. We then camped early due to an approaching storm. Despite the noise from the buffalo, we managed to rest for the night.|"['1.

On July 26, 1806, Captain Clark embarked early in the morning on his journey. The river's current was swift, divided by stony islands and bars. He described the landscape with extensive bottoms covered in cottonwood trees on one side and high cliffs with whitish rock suitable for grindstones on the other. Passing creeks and shooting deer, they navigated through the river. The Big Horn River's entrance was noted, with its muddy waters and extensive timbered bottoms. The river was compared to the Rochejhone River in terms of depth and water flow. The region was inhabited by various wildlife like big horn sheep, buffalo, elk, deer, and antelopes. Roving Indian tribes, including the Crow Nation, lived off the land, hunting buffalo for food and clothing. The Big Horn River was said to be navigable for canoes and offered a rich, open landscape.|['1.

On Sunday, July 27, 1806, I started the day by marking my name on a Cotton tree near the Camp. The river was wide, ranging from 400 to 600 yards, with many Islands and Sand bars. I crossed a dry Creek and reached the entrance of River Labeech, where I killed 4 Buffaloes. The banks were teeming with Buffaloes and Elk, with Elk being particularly gentle. I saw beavers and antelopes as well. As we moved away from the Rocky Mountains, the landscape changed, and we encountered more Elk, Deer, and Antelopes. The river resembled the Missouri but had more islands and a swifter current. The water was less muddy. The next day, Monday, July 28, 1806, we continued down the river, passing various creeks and rivers. The cliffs on the South side were different from those on the North, with coal deposits visible.|['1.

The journey from the Rocky Mountains to the Missouri River covered a total of 837 miles. A significant portion of this distance, 636 miles, was traveled in two small canoes lashed together with a crew that included John Shields, George Gibson, William Bratten, W. Labeech, Toust, Shabono with his wife and child, and York. The Yellowstone River or Rochejhone, as it is known, is broad and navigable with few obstacles, extending into the Rocky Mountains. The landscape along the river varies from fertile plains to rolling hills covered with pine and stones. The river's current ranges from 4.5 miles per hour near the Rocky Mountains to 2.5 miles per hour at its mouth where it meets the Missouri River. The water of the Yellowstone River has a yellowish-brown hue, distinct from the Missouri's deep drab color. This river, with its sources in the Rocky Mountains, plays a vital role in the fur trade and provides a safe trading ground for various Native American tribes. The Yellowstone River's navigability makes it a crucial hub for trade and exploration in the western territories.|['1.

On August 4, 1806, the explorers faced extreme challenges with mosquitoes. The insects were so troublesome that the men couldn't work on their skins. Hunting in the wooded areas was impossible due to the sheer number of mosquitoes. The best refuge was found on sandbars in the river, but even there, relief only came when the wind blew, albeit briefly. The evenings, nights, and mornings were unbearable due to the relentless mosquitoes. The lack of buffalo meat and the relentless insects pushed the group to move to a more suitable spot downstream on the Missouri River. Elk were plentiful but drying their meat was difficult. The next day, on August 5, 1806, the mosquitoes continued to be a nuisance, making sleep difficult. Despite the challenges, the explorers pressed on, facing encounters with wildlife and the elements.|['1.

On August 9th, 1806, during their expedition, Captain Clark and his team encountered a variety of wildlife and plant species. After a morning of heavy dew, they continued down the river, where two hunters had successfully brought back deer for breakfast. Captain Clark then ventured on foot, encountering deer and elk, although the deer were lean. He managed to hunt three deer, while the elk, though fat, were too far to transport back. They discovered a creek with timber like Cottonwood and Elm. Later, they reached the canoes and were greeted with berries by a Native American woman. Captain Clark also encountered a large, fat elk, which was prepared for drying. The following day, August 10th, they dried the elk meat, and the hunters managed to catch a black-tailed deer and an antelope. Captain Clark noted a unique species of cherry in the area, describing its stem, leaf, and fruit in detail. The Native Americans and the team consumed a root called Hankee, also known as the white apple, boiled and eaten with meat.|['1.

Captain Lewis and his men encountered a branch of the Marias River, abundant with timber. They met friendly Blackfoot Indians who shared information about their tribe and trading practices. However, a conflict arose when the Indians attempted to steal guns and horses. The men managed to retrieve their weapons, and a scuffle ensued resulting in the death of one Indian. They recovered most of their possessions and set out to intercept another group at Marias River. After a series of events, they reached the Missouri River, where they encountered canoes and continued their journey. The next day, they covered 86 miles with favorable winds and reached the entrance of the Marias River, camping on the northeast side.

On the morning of August 16, 1806, a cool day greeted the expedition. Sergeant Pryor was sent to the Mandan village to collect corn they had offered. Despite having more corn than the canoes could carry, the Chief was thanked for his generosity. A meeting with village chiefs ensued, where a swivel gun was gifted to the Menetaras' Chief. The Chief expressed fear of the Sioux and Ricaras, sharing past conflicts. The expedition tried to persuade the Big White Chief to join, eventually agreeing to take his wife, son, and others.

In August 1806, Lewis and Clark met with the Sioux tribe, warning them against harming other nations and promising to inform their great father about their behavior. They assured the Sioux that they would convey their messages to the Ricaras. The Grand Chief of the Minnetarees expressed gratitude and requested care for a visiting chief. Despite rough weather, they journeyed to Fort Mandan and the old Ricara village, where they camped due to high winds. The next day, they encountered an Indian seeking to bid farewell to his brother, a chief on board. They continued, hunting for meat and learning about the traditions of the Mandan and Menetaree tribes.

On August 20, 1806, a heavy rain fell at daybreak, soaking all but me and the Native Americans. We set off after sunrise, facing a moderate headwind. By midday, we passed the Cannonball River entrance and remnants of a Sioux camp. In the afternoon, we saw wolves, buffalo, and elk. We camped on a sandbar after traveling 8 miles. The changing landscape showed yellowing grass and altered river currents. The next day, August 21, 1806, mosquitoes bothered us, but we met Frenchmen heading to the Mandans. They shared news of Sioux warriors and a deceased chief. Arriving at the Ricara villages, we were warmly welcomed by chiefs and villagers, discussing peace efforts with neighboring tribes.

On August 23, 1806, our expedition continued downstream, encountering the Cheyenne people. The Cheyenne were described as robust individuals with high cheekbones and straight limbs. Their attire consisted of buffalo skin robes, breechcloths, moccasins, and leggings, adorned with beads, shells, elk tusks, and bear claws. The women wore simple leather dresses decorated with beads and shells. The Cheyenne were peaceful, estimated to have around 350 to 400 men in 130 to 150 lodges. They were rich in horses and dogs. The Cheyenne chief expressed a desire for traders to visit their land, as they had an abundance of beavers but lacked the knowledge to catch them effectively.

On Monday, August 25th, 1806, the expedition led by Clark embarked on a cool, clear morning with a stiff breeze. They directed some members to hunt on Ponia Island while the group made observations and repairs. The Chyenne River's surroundings were noted for their scattered timber, with small cotton trees lining the banks. The day was spent hunting and making necessary repairs before continuing downstream. The next day, Tuesday, August 26th, the group encountered signs of the Teton tribe and observed their abandoned camp. Despite encountering wildlife and patches of ripe fruit, the explorers remained vigilant as they progressed down the river, making repairs and covering a significant distance against the wind.|"[""1.

On Friday, September 5th, 1806, the party faced tormenting mosquitoes and set out early on the river, which had become narrower and more challenging to navigate. They encountered snags and sawyers all day. Despite not meeting their expected contact, McClellen, they heard gunshots that likely came from the Mahars returning to their village after hunting buffalo. The day's journey covered 73 miles, and they camped on a sandbar. The next day, still plagued by mosquitoes, they saw elk but failed to hunt any successfully. They encountered a trading boat and purchased whiskey, a rare treat. The traders shared news about troop movements and General Wilkinson's plans. The party traveled 30 miles that day, facing challenges with hunters and mosquitoes but ultimately making progress.|['1.

On September 8, 1806, the expedition led by Captains Lewis and Clark set out early, passing an old trading house near the Council Bluffs. They found the bluffs to be a suitable location for an establishment with a commanding view and rich bottomlands below. The group made good progress, eager to reach the River Platt. The Missouri River's water levels remained consistent despite receiving water from many rivers and creeks. The following day, they encountered the entrance to the Platte River, observing changes in the Missouri's current and the landscape. The team continued their journey, meeting traders bound for the Mahars and facing challenges navigating the river's obstacles. Despite setbacks, they pressed on, encountering wildlife and making camp near the Nadawa Island. The expedition faced various encounters and challenges as they navigated the rivers and interacted with traders and interpreters along the way.|"['1.

On the 18th of September 1806, we started early and passed the Grand River. Shortly after, we met our hunters who had no luck. By 10 o'clock, we stopped to gather pawpaws to eat since we had very little food left. The weather was hot, and we found plenty of pawpaws along the shores. We traveled only 52 miles that day, subsisting mainly on pawpaws as our provisions were running low. Some of our party suffered from sunburn, with one person complaining of a burnt eye. The next day, we continued our journey, aiming to reach the settlements in two days. We encountered a peculiar eye disorder among some of the party members, causing inflammation and pain. Despite this, we traveled 72 miles that day and camped near the Osage River.|['1.

The local American residents expressed discontent with the territorial government due to unconfirmed Spanish land grants. The following day, despite rainy weather, the party continued downstream to St. Charles. Upon arrival, they were warmly greeted by the polite inhabitants who offered provisions and hospitality.
