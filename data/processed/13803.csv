"""Herbert, I don't need to ask you that. We are always together, right? I wouldn't seek your company so persistently if I didn't enjoy it. I have plenty of offers for companionship that I turn down. Bob Stickney always invites me to his room, but he's lazy and more interested in having fun than studying. Then there's James Cameron, who is conceited and disagreeable. He's crafty and always scheming for his own gain. He hides his dislike for me because he thinks he may need my help in the future. I hope my mother remains with us for a long time. I was deeply saddened by Mr. Manning's passing. He was a penniless lawyer who married my mother. He was soft-spoken and managed to deceive her into thinking it was best for her to marry him. Mr. Manning's son, James, is nothing like him. Mark Manning, on the other hand, was slender and dark, with a soft voice and effeminate ways. He didn't enjoy rough sports like baseball but preferred to walk around in stylish clothes. It was unsettling to hear him refer to my mother as his wife.

I strolled around the city, pondering a solution to my problem. Luckily, I met a friend from New York who knew about my financial situation. I explained my issue, and he took me to a bank where I obtained money through a New York draft. I decided then to never carry all my money in one wallet to avoid pickpockets. The friend bought a blue suit similar to those worn by telegraph boys, fitting for his new role as a traveling peddler. In our village, a New York landlord with a harsh agent, Mr. Fairfield, raised rents and demanded prompt payments, causing hardship. Residents preferred the previous fair agent, Mr. Sampson. Frank suspected Mr. Fairfield of dishonesty due to increased rents and reduced returns to the landlord. Residents struggled under the new agent's tyranny.|"['1.
