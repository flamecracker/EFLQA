"The sailor walked forward; the freed crew member went below, and Ailie was once more alone with her thoughts. She knew not to disturb the steersman, even if the weather was calm. As most on deck dozed, the cook, Nikel Sling, was wide awake, bustling about his galley. Being the first up, he faced the same mess left from the night before.

"""A group of them!"" whispered Ailie, who had left her spot at the mizzen-shrouds, standing by her father's side, watching the sudden commotion in utter surprise. ""Do whales attend school?"" she chuckled. The starboard, larboard, and waist-boats swiftly descended, with the sailors quickly boarding, taking their places and grabbing their oars. Glynn joined his captain in the starboard boat, manning the aft oar. The race to harpoon the whale began, with each crew striving to be the first to strike.

The captain urged them on, shouting encouragement as the boats cut through the water towards the nearest whale. The men rowed with all their might, their backs bent, arms straining, and oars slicing through the sea with determination. Glynn, new to the task, put in every effort, almost breaking the oar in his eagerness to contribute to the chase. The boats raced like thoroughbreds, each gaining and losing ground in turn, dancing over the calm sea with a lively spirit that infused both men and vessels."|"[""1.

A massive sperm whale floated lazily a quarter mile ahead, as the starboard boat raced towards it, leaving the others behind. More whales appeared, forming a school around them. The whale-men steered towards the closer ones. The whale raised its tail and dove, coloring the sea red with its blood. It resurfaced near the boat, prompting a quick retreat to avoid its powerful flukes. The whale dived, pulling the line through the chocks. After a struggle, it resurfaced and was harpooned twice. In its agony, the whale thrashed, turning the sea red. It charged towards the boat but was repelled by a lance thrust.

Before the whales arrived, the ship's decks were spotless, reflecting Captain Dunning's pride in cleanliness. However, once the whales were hauled in, the decks became smeared with grease, oil, and blood. Ailie, taken aback by the sudden change, had to witness the mess as the crew began the process of cutting up the whales for oil. Despite the filth, the crew had to carry on with their duties. Ailie, with a mix of wonder and disgust, gingerly navigated the slippery decks, bearing the foul smells. The crew attached ropes to the whales to begin the cutting process. The blubber was hoisted up and cut into pieces for boiling down into oil. The scene on deck, with flames and smoke from the try-works, was both striking and eerie. Ailie observed the men at work, surrounded by a chaotic yet fascinating sight of fire, oil, and smoke in the dark night.|"[""1.

"""Ain't it beautiful?"" asked Gurney, a chubby sailor perched on the windlass, pointing to a burst of sparks. Scroggles sought approval for the word ""splendiferous"" but got none. Nickel Sling, with a knife, scoffed at the idea of Gurney being in school. Dick Barnes joked, urging Gurney to sing. Gurney insisted on a chorus for songs. He began singing a lively tune about a man who lost his nose to frostbite, drawing hearty participation from his shipmates. Gurney's robust performance allowed him to take quick puffs from his pipe, ensuring his voice lasted through the verses and the chorus.

While the men were eating, Dr. Hopley joined them on deck and noticed Ailie gazing at the glowing waves. A gentle breeze caused the ship to leave a trail of blue light in the water. Dr. Hopley explained that the phenomenon was called phosphorescence, caused by tiny jelly-like creatures emitting light like fireflies. Suddenly, a gust of wind made the sail jibe, throwing Ailie overboard. The crew reacted swiftly, launching a boat to rescue her. Glynn, a strong swimmer, dove in to save Ailie. As he swam towards her, the ship disappeared from view. Glynn stopped to listen, hoping he hadn't missed her. In the darkness, he strained to hear any sign of Ailie struggling in the water.|"['1.

"Glynn was aware that every passing moment decreased his chances of rescuing the child. He called out ""Ailie!"" in a desperate voice and swam with renewed vigor, periodically shouting her name and scanning his surroundings. His intense focus made him lose track of time initially. Suddenly, the realization hit him that significant time had passed since Ailie fell overboard, and panic set in as he knew a non-swimmer wouldn't survive for long in deep water. Frantically swimming back towards where the ship was, he feared he might have missed Ailie.

After a dramatic rescue at sea, Captain Dunning and the crew were overwhelmed with emotion. Ailie, who was saved, was too weak to speak, while Glynn was quickly back on his feet. The crew celebrated wildly, even tearing Glynn's trousers in their excitement. Amidst the chaos, they managed to get Glynn dry and warm. Tim Rokens, witnessing the rescue, was deeply moved and expressed his emotions in a unique, loud manner. The captain expressed his gratitude to Glynn, showing his heartfelt appreciation.

"Glynn interrupted Ailie, holding her hand and gesturing for silence. ""You followed my instructions in the water, now I need you to obey me out of the water. If you don't, I'll leave. You're still too weak to be moving around and speaking loudly like this. Lie down, my dear."" Ailie responded, ""I don't mind that, but please don't get too excited. How did you manage to stay afloat for so long, Ailie?"" Glynn expressed amazement and speculated that it might have been a miracle that saved her. Ailie shared that she learned to float from her aunts and that it helped her stay calm when she was tossed into the sea. The conversation was interrupted by Mr. Millons warning of an approaching squall. Glynn rushed to prepare the ship as the crew braced for the storm. The night grew dark, and a fierce squall hit, causing chaos on the ship. Despite being thrown off balance, the crew managed to navigate through the storm. Ailie, filled with fear, debated whether to go on deck, but her father, Captain Dunning, sent Glynn to comfort her.

Glynn found himself in a precarious situation on the ship during a fierce storm. As the squall hit, the ship struggled but held on. The crew worked hard to secure the sails, but the storm intensified, tearing the main-topsail. A massive wave threatened to engulf the ship, but the captain's quick commands saved them from disaster.

"Fully understanding this significant aspect of human nature and seeking some excitement, Tim and Phil approached Captain Dunning a week after the storm, requesting permission to go ashore. Initially seeming reckless, the men had a valid reason. Four days post-storm, the _Red Eric_ had anchored near an African river mouth where trade with locals for goods like bar-wood and ivory, as well as the despicable slave trade, occurred. ""Go ashore!"" Captain Dunning exclaimed, cautioning them about the dangers of the interior. Ailie, eager for adventure, persuaded her father to let her go with Glynn.

The trader, a forbidding man, approached with a scowl, hat in hand, his black beard and tall-crowned hat making him an imposing figure. His unnatural smile did not fool anyone, even causing Ailie to shrink back. Tim Rokens, enjoying his pipe, was eager to strike a deal with the trader. Phil Briant, a man with a passion for righting wrongs, found slavery to be the worst injustice. As the Irishman tried to confront the trader, his friends intervened, dragging him away.

The merchant entertained Tim and Phil with stories of the slave trade. Meanwhile, Glynn and Ailie explored the calm seashore. They encountered various creatures, including countless birds in the woods, on the shore, and above the ocean. Ailie was thrilled to see the bird-of-paradise and bright red bee-eaters. Suddenly, a large black snake appeared, startling them. Glynn's old flint-lock gun failed to fire, allowing the snake to vanish into the thick undergrowth.

"In a faraway land, a new king was crowned in a peculiar manner. The locals chose their king but did not inform him directly. Instead, they kicked, spat, and insulted him, saying, ""You are not a king yet, you scoundrel!"" Once chosen, they brought him to the palace and crowned him, treating him with great respect thereafter. The ceremony took place in a large hut open on three sides, filled with noisy drumming and cheering. The new king, dressed in a scarlet coat and a worn black hat as a crown, delivered a speech, impressing his subjects with his authority.

The harm endured by the _Red Eric_ in the tempest was discovered to be more serious than initially thought. A part of her false keel had been ripped away by a submerged rock, which the ship had glided over so lightly that no one aboard noticed. However, it was forceful enough to cause the harm mentioned. A minor leak was also found, and fixing the top of the foremast took longer than expected. This led to the ship being stuck on the African coast for almost two weeks. During this time, Ailie explored the land with Glynn, Tim, and her father, immersing herself in a world of wonder and romance. Despite encountering some distressing sights and stories, she focused on the beauty around her, pondering the purpose of God's creations. Excitement filled the air when they planned a canoe trip up the river to experience forest life.|"['1.

The loud gunshot startled many large creatures nearby. Monkeys fled into the woods, revealing they had been watching the group closely. The trader warned against shooting a crocodile's head, advising to aim behind the foreleg. That night, they camped in the woods, creating a cozy setup with fires and a leafy canopy for Ailie. Despite a happy evening, Ailie awoke grumpy the next morning. However, once back in the canoe under the golden sunlight, her joy returned. The following day, they crossed a vast lake teeming with waterfowl and crocodiles. After several failed attempts, the trader managed to kill a massive crocodile with a shot behind its foreleg.

Interruptions are common in the uncertain world, especially in the African wilds. Dr. Hopley was about to reply when a hippopotamus surfaced near their boat, startling Ailie. Tim Rokens instinctively struck at it with his paddle. Unfazed by the boat, the hippo yawned and disappeared underwater. Further up the river, Glynn spotted another object floating ahead, which turned out to be a beautiful gazelle drinking by the riverbank. The crew paused to admire it. Unfortunately, the tranquility was shattered when a crocodile swiftly snatched the gazelle, leaving the onlookers in shock. Ailie, deeply affected, clung to her father in tears. It took days for her to recover from the distressing sight, leaving a lasting impact on her.|['1.

The young girl, Ailie Dunning, had a profound experience that stirred her emotions for the first time. Witnessing the gazelle being attacked by a crocodile deeply affected her, making her realize that all creatures have feelings. This event sparked new thoughts in her mind and changed her perspective on life. Ailie's encounter with the natives of a village, who were fascinated by her appearance, further broadened her understanding of different cultures.

A group of travellers encountered a horrific scene where a young boy was accused of being possessed by a devil and subsequently killed. The doctor in the group lamented the superstitious beliefs that led to such atrocities. He shared that only knowledge of the true God and Jesus Christ, through Bibles and missionaries, could change such beliefs. Tim Rokens, one of the travellers, was moved by the doctor's words and questioned why more efforts weren't being made to send Bibles and missionaries to help these people. However, when the doctor pointed out that individuals needed to contribute to such causes, Tim was left speechless, realizing he had not done his part.

In a dense forest, Jim Scroggles encountered a terrifying creature, a huge ape with a bald head and grey whiskers. The creature's wrinkled face contorted into hideous expressions, striking fear into Jim's heart. The ape's scarlet gums and tremendous teeth added to the horror. Jim, trembling with fear, turned to run, believing the ape was chasing him. In his haste, he stumbled into a swamp with mangrove trees growing out of the mud. As he tried to leap from root to root to cross the swamp, he faced another dangerâ€”a deadly serpent. His misstep landed him waist-deep in the mud, sinking deeper with each struggle.

The baby monkey displayed incredible strength and determination when it found itself trapped. King Bumble struggled to contain its energy as he carried it to a canoe. Once freed in the middle of the stream, the monkey let out a triumphant shriek. It searched for its mother but sadly found her lifeless. Despite feeling disappointed, it was drawn to Ailie, a young girl on the boat. Ailie offered the monkey a biscuit, and after some hesitation, the monkey cautiously accepted it. Gradually, the monkey warmed up to Ailie, allowing her to pat its head and eventually embracing her as its new caregiver. The monkey's behavior during the voyage was a mix of affection and deception, endearing it to the crew, especially Phil Briant and Rokens.

"When the men called it, it used to walk up to them with calm, deliberate condescension in its air; when Ailie held out her hand, it ran on its two legs, and being eager in its affections, it held out its arms in order to be caught up. As to food, that monkey was not particular. It seemed to be omnivorous. Certain it is that it never refused anything, but more than once it was observed quietly to throw away things that it did not relish. Once, in an unguarded moment, it accepted and chewed a small piece of tobacco; after which it made a variety of entirely new faces, and became very sick indeed--so sick that its adopted mother began to fear she was about to lose her child; but after vomiting a good deal, and moaning piteously for several days, it gradually recovered, and from that time entertained an unquenchable hatred for tobacco, and for the man who had given it to him, who happened to be Jim Scroggles.

Ailie, being of a romantic temperament, named her monkey Albertino, but the sailors called him Jacko, and their name ultimately became the well-known one of the little foundling, for Ailie was not obstinate; so, seeing that the sailors did not or could not remember Albertino, she soon gave in, and styled her pet Jacko to the end of the chapter, with which piece of information"|"[""1.

While Tim Rokens was sharing his spooky encounters with his friends, the silent tide was slowly lifting the _Red Eric_ upright. Unbeknownst to them, a British warship was secretly approaching, aiming to destroy the innocent vessel. This warship had been tracking a Portuguese slaver that had been lurking off the coast, waiting to capture slaves without alerting the British cruiser guarding the area. The similar appearance of the _Red Eric_ to the slaver led to a mistaken identity, with the warship giving chase. As the _Red Eric_ floated at dawn, preparations were made for a potential confrontation. The warship closed in, mistaking the whaler for the slaver, but upon realizing the error, the warship captain swiftly turned back to pursue the real target.

Ailie couldn't notice the ship's drastic change as each wave violently crashed it onto rocks. The captain struggled to hold on, assisted by Glynn. Tim spotted an island and suggested getting a rope ashore. Phil echoed the idea, but fear held back the crew. Glynn volunteered to connect a rope to the shore despite the perilous task. Facing the dangerous waters, Glynn hesitated but pushed forward. Battling the surging waves, he aimed for a rocky point. Despite being thrown off course by a wave, he persisted.

Briant, the thoughtful Irishman, brought warm clothes for Ailie, the captain's daughter, after a storm. The crew felt joy as the sun shone, and the ship was safe on the rocks. They worked to make their island home comfortable. Phil Briant joked, Gurney sang, and even the stern steward, Tarquin, seemed less fierce. They brought provisions ashore and planned to build a raft for safety. Amidst the activity, Jacko the monkey watched attentively. When everyone left the ship, Jacko showed concern for his safety. Captain Dunning was the last to leave, ensuring everyone's safety. Jim Scroggles, always in the way, delayed the captain's departure by rushing back for a ring.|"['1.

Jim's head, feet, legs, knees, and arms all went over the side first, and his hat flew off. Jacko, realizing the urgency of the situation, grabbed Jim's hair to keep him from falling into the sea. Jacko could have easily walked along the cable to shore, but the danger of the sea below terrified him. They reached the shore, and Jacko found a warm spot to rest. A shelter was built using canvas and boards. Ailie and Jacko settled in, making the best of their situation. Ailie and Glynn worked cheerfully, forgetting their predicament, creating a cozy space under the rock. The sandbank, located in the Southern Ocean, was small and devoid of vegetation, with only a few blades of greenery. Despite the challenges, they made the best of their situation, focusing on the small tasks at hand.|"[""1.

On a small and barren sandbank, one might assume there's little to admire. However, this is not true. People who don't focus on things tend to think many things are uninteresting. While some may find things uninteresting, everything has some interest to someone. A valley, hidden until you're close, is a beautiful spot that attracts many travelers yearly. Despite its unremarkable surroundings, the valley is a gem. Similarly, the sandbank seemed dreary at first, but Ailie found charm in it, feeling like she was in Fairyland. Most sailors, like Jim Scroggles, missed the beauty around them. However, Glynn Proctor, influenced by Ailie, appreciated the small things. Despite their circumstances, the crew of the _Red Eric_ remained cheerful, with a soft spot for Ailie.|"['1.

Ailie, accompanied by Glynn or on her own, would often find a cozy spot in the sun or a cooler shady nook to summon countless fairies. They would guide her through vast stretches of pure-white clouds and summon peculiar wild creatures from dark caves. Ailie's Fairyland boasted rich gardens with vibrant flowers, though scentless and underwater. The sea bottom gardens flourished with colorful marine life like coral forests, sponges, seaweeds, and striped creatures. The men on the sandbank worked tirelessly, ferrying provisions from the wreck to build a stockpile under tarps. Gurney, reminiscing over a meal, shared tales of a life at sea, tattooed by New Zealanders, dancing with Hottentots, and encounters with various cultures, expressing a longing for the open ocean over their current sandbank predicament.|"['1.

Rokens expressed concern about their survival without being rescued soon, fearing they would succumb to scurvy if they continued to rely on salted food. However, Phil Briant's resourcefulness uplifted their spirits. He swiftly caught fresh fish using a makeshift fishing rod, providing a welcome change from their monotonous diet. Fishing became a popular pastime among the group, except for Jacko, who preferred scavenging among the provisions. Ailie and Glynn found joy in observing the underwater world until a playful dive led to a comical splash. Meanwhile, Captain Dunning harbored worries about their extended stay on the sandbank, realizing their fate relied on a passing ship. Despite the challenges, the group found solace in simple pleasures and inventive activities to pass the time.|['1.

One afternoon, about three weeks after the shipwreck of the _Red Eric_, Captain Dunning stood on the rocks, his usual spot now a place of habit like a sentinel. But this time, worry etched deep lines on his face. Dark clouds loomed, the air was heavy, and an eerie calm enveloped the sea, signaling an impending storm. As he sat, deep in thought, Ailie, his daughter, approached. He embraced her, a rare moment of vulnerability as he expressed concern about their situation. Ailie, undeterred, pointed optimistically to the sky, likening the clouds to her fairyland dreams. The captain, though silent, prayed for deliverance or strength to face whatever lay ahead. As tensions rose among the crew, Captain Dunning reflected on the deeper fears beyond the physical danger, contemplating the uncertainties of life and the need for faith in times of peril.|"[""1.

Ailie didn't dwell on her lost possessions on the sandbank. She briefly felt regret, a natural response, but didn't complain. She quickly regained her cheerfulness, focusing on preparing for their long voyage. Captain Dunning started building the boat just in time before a sudden storm hit. They managed to gather essential supplies like planking, cordage, and sail cloth. As the wind grew stronger, they secured what they could. Briant and Tim dug a hole to store biscuit casks and covered them with sand and tarpaulin. The storm was fierce, with winds so loud they could barely talk. They sought refuge in the hut, feeling the power of the storm and their vulnerability. The crew sat in silence, awed by the raging sea and the peril they faced.|"['1.

Rokens, seated next to Ailie by the fire, relit his pipe repeatedly that night. He offered to check outside to ensure all was secure. As he left, a strong gust filled the hut with spray, alarming the captain. Rokens confirmed all was well and secured the boat materials. Suddenly, a fierce gust swept Rokens away, leaving the men shocked. Briant rushed out to help but was also taken by the wind. The remaining men sat in disbelief, fearing the worst.

The captain shouted a warning and shielded Ailie as the men rose to their feet. The sturdy corner-posts of the hut bent under the immense force of the wind. The second mate and others braced against the posts to hold the structure. Tarquin feared the worst as the roof was ripped off, drenching them in darkness. Ailie felt a small creature, Jacko the monkey, clinging to her, giving her a sense of comfort. Despite the chaos, the crew tried to protect themselves, but the hut was lifted and torn apart by the hurricane. The captain managed to hold onto Ailie and find shelter among the rocks. Eventually, other crew members joined them, seeking refuge from the relentless storm. As the night passed, the hurricane subsided, and the crew emerged to find their provisions washed away, except for the boat keel, which remained intact.|"['1.

As she spoke, a break in the clouds allowed a beam of light to touch the sandbank, now almost out of sight. It brightened the yellow shore, gleaming briefly like gold on the horizon. Everyone stared, startled by the sudden change, wondering if they'd see land again. The clouds moved on, the golden glow faded, and the boat's crew realized their little vessel was their world amidst the vast ocean. The early days on the _Maid of the Isle_ were pleasant. The boat sailed well, even in rough seas, although they lacked a gun for hunting. Captain Dunning worried about food supplies for their 2322-mile journey to the Cape. He considered reducing rations to ensure they'd have enough, knowing they might face starvation if things went wrong. The crew, tired and hungry, listened as plans were made to stretch their provisions and survive the long voyage ahead.|['1.

"""Doctor Hopley, as a medical expert, can you share your thoughts on whether we can survive with a reduced food ration?"" inquired the captain, turning to the doctor. After a moment of contemplation, the doctor responded, ""I believe we can manage. Those of us with some extra fat can endure a cutback better than lean individuals."" The doctor's assessment was met with mixed reactions from the crew. While some chuckled in agreement, Gurney groaned at the thought of further reductions. The captain then proposed a new ration plan, distributing precise portions of salt beef, biscuit, tobacco, and water. Despite the limited supplies, the crew showed compassion towards Jacko, the monkey, who received a meager portion. Jacko, however, seemed content and observant, ensuring no crumb went to waste. As the crew adjusted to their reduced rations, a mishap with Phil Briant's last biscuit bite led to a comical yet unfortunate incident involving Jacko's swift snatching skills."|"['1.

"""Oh, you mischievous creature!"" cried the upset man, ""don't I recognize you?"" He angrily hurled a tin cup at the small monkey, missing Ailie. The cup fell into the sea, lost forever. Jacko then moved swiftly to Gurney's head, then onto the mainsail, and finally perched on the mast, calmly eating a biscuit. Ailie, half scared and half amused, offered Jacko's share of her biscuit to calm the situation. Briant, embarrassed by the monkey's audacity, laughed it off. The captain lightened the mood, joking about the value of food. Despite hunger, they shared laughs, discussing food. Days passed with hunger pangs, dreaming and talking mostly about food.

During the long voyage, the sailors on the ship were given strict rations of salt junk, biscuit, and water to ensure nothing was wasted. They grew accustomed to the short supply, feeling only a growing tiredness. However, when the wind filled the sails and they glided smoothly through the water, their spirits lifted. The crew spent their time chatting and telling stories. Captain Dunning, the doctor, and Glynn were the best storytellers, captivating everyone with their tales. Ailie Dunning and even Jacko, the ship's dog, were engrossed listeners. Captain Dunning's stories were historical and engaging, while Glynn's imaginative tales took everyone on wild adventures.

Phil and Gurney were known for their comic talents, leaving poetry and prose to Glynn and the captain. Their strength lay in entertaining after meals, forming a light interlude. Gurney shared experiences, often exaggerating to impress. Briant, on the other hand, told ghost stories for amusement. Despite their tales, exhaustion often left them too tired to talk or listen. Ailie, in better health, spent time reading her Bible and playing with her favorite. She also kept a journal of the voyage, sketching and writing about their experiences. As they faced trials and dwindling supplies on the boat, the Bible provided comfort. One day, a calm settled over the ocean, and the captain reflected on gratitude for life and hope, prompting thought on religion among the men.|['1.

That morning, the captain prayed earnestly for water, which the men anxiously awaited. After worship, the captain divided the meager meal, increasing Ailie's portion by sacrificing his and Glynn's share. As the water supply dwindled, the crew faced despair. Jacko, the monkey, received only a few drops, causing unrest among the men. Ailie, moved by Jacko's distress, shared her water, leading to a heartfelt moment. The crew suffered as the sun beat down relentlessly, leaving them parched and skeletal. Despite their suffering, no relief was in sight.

The men in the boat had stopped rowing, realizing it was futile without a miracle. As their hunger grew, most refused to eat. Glynn, desperate, tried to jump overboard but failed due to exhaustion. Tim suggested a swim, and everyone followed, feeling instant relief. However, the constant wetness caused discomfort. The captain read from the Bible, bringing comfort. A downpour of rain brought immense relief. The men drank the rainwater eagerly, feeling rejuvenated. Their suffering was momentarily forgotten as they washed away the salt from their bodies.

"""Glynn, grab the line,"" instructed the captain, tossing the hook overboard as the albatross circled. Despite his haggard appearance, Glynn focused intently on the bird.

Glynn Proctor, a man of wit and humor, entered the room and declared the legal system to be a grand institution but sometimes subject to misuse and abuse. He then jokingly announced his resignation from his sea duties and requested dinner. Aunt Martha, upon hearing this, ordered Tim Rokens, a loyal sailor with tar-stained hands, to leave the house as he felt unfit to dine with ladies. This led to a comical encounter where Aunt Martha shook Tim's hand vigorously, causing a stir among the guests.

Briant advised Gurney, causing a confrontation. The mariners laughed, and the meeting ended. The trial lasted three days, with intense questioning by the counsels. The crew's decision to tell only the truth proved advantageous. Tim Rokens gave clear evidence about a whale hunt. The crew of the _Termagant_ took the whale, causing a fight. Witnesses like Tarquin and Nikel Sling were unreliable. Jim Scroggles got confused during cross-examination. Mr Tooth questioned his memory of which oar he pulled during the hunt. Jim focused on the boat's crew instead of the whale. His unclear memory cast doubt on his testimony. It's crucial to be truthful in serious matters like this.|"[""1.

After a few questions, Jim Scroggles left feeling his testimony didn't help much. That night, Captain Dunning, Ailie, and the sisters had supper with low spirits. Even the doctor, Tim Rokens, and mates were down. King Bumble, eager to serve Captain Dunning, was also low. This mood spread to Aunts Martha, Jane, and Ailie. The men puzzled over the case's turn. They discussed the importance of the drogue. Aunt Martha lightened the mood with a joke, and spirits lifted. They focused on the positive evidence. The next day, the defendant's witnesses were examined. They contradicted each other and themselves, and Mr. Rasp exposed their lies. Captain Dixon was pursued until he paid back the whale's value, learning honesty is best. Captain Dunning received 2000 pounds, causing him worry. He decided Glynn deserved the money for his role in capturing the whale.|"[""1.
