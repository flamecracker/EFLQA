"Title: A Challenging Afternoon

Hal and Mab were feeling disappointed on a warm Saturday afternoon. They complained to their mother that it was too muddy to play outside, and they couldn't think of any fun activities. Hal was upset that they couldn't play ball, and Mab was unhappy that they couldn't run around playing tag. Their mother encouraged them to think of a new game and reminded them of the challenges their family faced due to the high cost of living caused by the war. She explained that their father had to work harder and longer to support the family, which meant he couldn't come home early on Saturdays like he used to.

"""Spring is the start of new life in nature,"" Mrs. Blake explained. ""It's when flowers bloom from tiny buds and birds hatch from little eggs. What comes after that?"" Mab suggested that she could handle the task alone if she made the cake. Usually, she and Hal shared the joy of scraping out the leftover icing from the cake-making process. As Hal tried to catch their pet dog, Roly-Poly, chaos ensued, and Hal ended up covered in cake dough. Despite the mess, Mother Blake reassured Hal that it would wash off easily.

"""We will eat all we need,"" his father said. ""But you know that gardens and farms can only be planted, and fruits and vegetables can only grow when the weather is warm. Nothing grows in the cold Winter. So we raise all we can in Summer and save what we need to eat when snow is on the ground."" 

""Well, we'll begin at the very beginning,"" answered Daddy Blake. ""The first part of any garden is getting the soil ready. That is the dirt, in which we plant the seeds, must be dug up and made soft and mellow so the seeds will grow.""

Uncle Pennywait explained the first steps to creating a garden to Hal and Mab. He mentioned that for small gardens, spading is suitable, but for larger areas like farms, a plow is necessary. Mr. Blake, their neighbor, used a plow to prepare his garden, which fascinated the children. The plow turns over the soil, bringing the nutrient-rich undersoil to the surface for better plant growth. After plowing, the ground is harrowed with an iron-tooth harrow to smooth it out. The children learned that worms in the garden help aerate the soil, making it easier for plants to grow. Sammie, a red-haired boy, mistook the plow for a creature and ran away but fell down, showing resilience by getting back up.|['1.

Daddy Blake showed Hal and Mab how to plant cabbage plants properly. He explained that putting seeds in a hot frame gives them a good start. Each child received a handful of cabbage plants with light green leaves. Daddy Blake corrected Hal's and Mab's planting distances, showing them that cabbage plants should be about two and a half feet apart in rows.

His father reassured him that the plants would recover. Farmers face challenges like storms damaging crops, but they diversify to mitigate risks.

This is a place where a mole has dug his tunnel in the night to get things to eat. Moles dig deep down, too, under the surface where no one can see them, and when they do not uproot the grass or the garden plants, they do little harm. It is only when they come near the top that you can see the ridge they make. Sometimes cats catch moles when they come out on top of the ground, thinking them a sort of mouse. The mole's fur is very fine and soft and would make a fine cloak, only it would take many skins to make one large enough to wear. Mr. Blake had planted two kinds of potatoes, early and late, and it was the vines of the early ones that had dried up. Later on, the others would dry, and then it would be time to dig their tubers to put down cellar for the long Winter. First, you pull up the vine, and then with a potato hook, Daddy Blake began scraping away the dirt from the side of the hill of potatoes. When a farmer has a big field of potatoes, he may use a machine potato-digger. This is drawn by horses, who walk between the rows, drawing the machine right over where the potato vines are growing. The machine has iron prongs which dig under the dirt like giant fingers, turning out the potatoes which are tossed between the rows of dirt so men, who follow, may pick them up.

Summer was fading away, and the days were growing shorter. Daddy Blake noted the change, signaling the approach of Winter after Autumn or Fall. Harvest days were on the horizon, with crops ready to be gathered. The conversation turned to the garden, where the plants had reached full growth, making them less vulnerable to weeds and pests. Birds were praised for helping control insects, despite occasionally snatching cherries. The family discussed saving corn for chickens, and the use of a flail to thresh beans. The process of threshing was likened to opening an envelope to access the edible part of grains like wheat, oats, and barley.|['1.

In the past, people used to break open pea or bean pods by hand when they were green. But when they dried, a pile of pods was placed on a wooden floor and beaten with a stick called a flail. The dried peas or beans would then fall out. The handle of the flail is one part, and the other part, called a swingle or swiple, swings through the air to beat the pods. Wheat, rye, and oats were also threshed this way. Daddy Blake planned to thresh some peas for the Winter. The Blake family was busy canning tomatoes and storing carrots in the cellar. Hal checked his tall corn with ears on every stalk. The garden had been a success despite some setbacks. Uncle Pennywait was meticulous about tracking the potatoes.

"""Daddy Blake suggested trying some popcorn, which popped into big, white bunches over the fire. The heat turns the water inside the corn kernel into steam, causing it to burst and puff up. Hal and Mab helped harvest peas, beans, corn, pumpkins, and more from the garden with their family. They learned how to thresh beans and corn, and enjoyed using a flail. Uncle Pennywait had a lot of potatoes stored, Aunt Lolly had pumpkins, and Mother Blake had carrots and tomatoes. Daddy Blake rewarded the children with gold coins for their hard work in the garden.
