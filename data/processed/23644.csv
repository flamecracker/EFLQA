Marjorie was surprised when the small man paid little attention to her and instead focused on teaching the next day's lesson from his grammar book. Despite his animated explanations, Marjorie couldn't help but compare him to the calm Professor Rousseau from Franklin. When it was time for the students to recite, the instructor's demeanor changed. He sternly critiqued those who struggled, making notes in a black book on his desk. Marjorie nervously hoped he wouldn't call on her before the bell rang. As she observed the other students, she admired the eloquent reading of a girl she thought might be French. When Marjorie finally presented herself to the professor, he explained that he had overlooked her due to schedule changes by other freshmen.
