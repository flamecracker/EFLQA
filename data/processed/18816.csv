Christy quietly descended the stairs to the lower hall, where everything was as silent as above. He started to think the noise was just a dream, but then noticed the front door was slightly open.

The mysterious visitor at the mansion, whoever he was, was not a burglar. He did not take valuable watches and money. His purpose was unclear. When he left, he left the door open, which was strange. Christy found it odd that his mother and sister were setting the table instead of the man's work. They were late due to the disturbance the night before.

Lieutenant Passford was aboard the Vernon, observing his new crew with interest. He found them tidy in their new uniforms and was relieved to see their appearance.

After Christy discovered that the sick officer was his cousin Corny Passford, he started to understand why his relative from the South had assumed his name and rank in the navy. However, Christy didn't have time to dwell on it. Captain Battleton, seated in the chair Corny had vacated, seemed to be preparing to take notes. Despite the formal atmosphere, Christy was confident that Corny would be proven a prisoner of war. Christy had his commission and orders, sure they would clear any doubts. The captain explained that the investigation would determine who would occupy the single vacant stateroom on the ship. The questioning continued, with Corny and Christy both responding promptly.

The captain raised the cover of the papers, noting the official envelope enclosing them. He pointed out that one gentleman's papers were blank, causing surprise. Captain Battleton identified one as Lieutenant Christopher Passford but couldn't confirm. When asked about his service vessels, Mr. Passford mentioned the Vixen.

The carpenter and his helpers were still busy working on the ship's berth. Christy sat down nearby, finally getting a chance to think about the day's events.

"After thinking for a while, Christy realized his cousin Corny couldn't carry out the task alone. He needed help, possibly from Confederate allies aboard the ship. Christy, a prisoner of war, decided to investigate. He observed the crew talking about officers who claimed to be Lieutenant Passford. This hinted that a Confederate officer might be on board. Christy pretended to sleep to eavesdrop but missed some details. Despite feeling the need to act, he noted down the names he heard to gather more information.

For three days, strong winds blew on the ship, sometimes calming down only to pick up again. While the weather wasn't a concern for sailors, Christy discovered that his cousin was confined to his cabin. The prisoner managed to go on deck during permitted hours, keenly observing his surroundings for clues about the ongoing plot. He identified some individuals but focused on Mr. Galvinne, suspecting him to be a key player. As the ship neared Pensacola Bay after a smooth voyage, Christy noticed tension growing among the crew. The Bronx, a smaller vessel, was recognized by Captain Battleton. Christy, feeling helpless as a prisoner, saw the plan unfolding without interference. Despite his realization, he understood his limitations and the futility of seeking help.

"Christy was determined to save the Bronx, a Union gunboat, from being captured by his cousin Corny, who was posing as a commander.

The supply ship was secured to the main ship, and a call was made for all crew members to gather at the rear. Christy, unable to handle the tension, grabbed his bag and headed to the deck just as the Bronx arrived. Mr. Flint, with a few young officers, directed the Bronx to dock with the Vernon. Captain Battleton and Corny were heading to the main ship. Christy stashed his bag and hid in the firemen's area under the forecastle. He positioned himself to observe the officers on the quarter-deck and the men below. The second lieutenant was reading names, likely the crew for the Bronx. Captain Passford may have influenced the selection. After an hour, Captain Battleton and Corny returned. Corny seemed pleased, suggesting his plan succeeded. He greeted Mr. Galvinne, possibly celebrating a promotion. The crew was swiftly transferred to the Bronx, and Christy sensed the time for action had arrived. He mingled with the crew and discreetly boarded the Bronx without being challenged. Mr. Flint, now the executive officer of the Bronx, directed the crew below deck.

Christy stowed his bag safely near the steerage door. The crew was busy moving sailors around, even the stewards. Christy knew the ship well, having been in charge on a previous voyage. He decided to hide in the captain's cabin to eavesdrop on conversations. He crawled under the berth, creating a barricade with his trunk. He felt comfortable with the steward, Dave, who he believed was still on board. Christy heard noises in the next room, realizing it was Dave cleaning.

The Bronx had finished transferring cargo in the Bronx area. The flag-officer was rushing the steamer's departure for its mission after a conversation with Corny. The sealed envelope was not to be opened until 9 o'clock. The second lieutenant was overseeing the deck. Corny checked his quarters for the first time, and Mr. Galvinne took the first lieutenant's stateroom. Corny was uneasy in the captain's cabin. Mr. Galvinne arrived and sat at the table.

Christy understood Mr. Galvinne's abilities but was disappointed in his breach of manners. Corny, not a naval officer, had studied nautical subjects for their mission. They discussed sealed orders to capture a cotton-loaded steamer at St. Andrew's Bay. Mr. Galvinne explained the secrecy to prevent a warning to the enemy. Corny and Mr. Galvinne planned to approach the bay discreetly. They discussed the disappearance of Corny's cousin, likely hiding on board.

Mr. Galvinne argued that the evidence would have confused the commander. He believed the missing lieutenant was hidden on the Vernon, planning to return to New York with influential friends. As Christy overheard the plan, he realized it aligned with Mr. Flint's prediction. When Corny entered the stateroom, Christy feared being discovered. Prepared to subdue his cousin, he was relieved when Corny didn't search too thoroughly. The steward reported that Ralph Pennant had identified loyal crew members. Christy, engrossed in the capture plan, devoured his meal and discussed the operation with Mr. Flint. They agreed to act only if the Bronx disobeyed orders.

"""I think we shall be in Pensacola Bay by daylight,"" Mr. Galvinne said. The weather was just right for their plan. It was cloudy, hinting at a possible fog that often rolled in after dark with the current wind. ""Around nine o'clock, maybe sooner,"" he continued. Byron would take over the deck at eight bells for the first watch. Christy doubted if Flint, the second lieutenant, would actually turn in at that time. Mr. Galvinne had a plan in place. Rockton and Warton were ready to detain Flint if needed. Nichols and Sayles were positioned near the quarter-deck in case the crew acted up. The first lieutenant assured Christy that there would be no trouble. They would quietly change course without raising suspicion. Christy was told he could rest as there would be no disturbances. The steward brought Christy some food. Christy ate, knowing failure was a possibility. Half an hour later, Christy sensed the ship's course had changed as planned.

"We have decided to reverse the Vernon commander's decision and refer the matter to the flag-officer for a final resolution. In the meantime, I have taken control of the steamer and detained all your associates. Currently, I am in charge of the Bronx and require my stateroom.

The fake captain's hands were now free, but Ralph Pennant, taller than most, quickly subdued him. Corny, likely stiff from being restrained, couldn't resist much. Christy seized an envelope from his pocket amidst the scuffle, waking some sleepers. An officer emerged demanding an explanation. It was the ship's surgeon. Christy, with loyal crew members, revealed they had taken over the ship. Corny, in Ralph's strong hold, was helpless. The surgeon, surprised, joined the scene. He seemed to view Christy's actions as mutiny. The captain assigned Boxie to guard the prisoners. Ralph took the prisoners to their quarters. Corny and Galvin started discussing. Boxie, alert, monitored the prisoners. Christy, asserting his authority, corrected the surgeon's address. He explained his actions against the rebels' betrayal.|"[""1.

The doctor joined Christy on the deck and was formally introduced to Mr. Flint. The commander checked the log slate, noting the ship's speed of seventy-eight knots in the fog. With poor visibility, the decision was made to halt. The leadsman reported the depth, and the ship cautiously moved forward. As the Bronx navigated through the fog, Christy recognized the area near St. Andrew's Bay. Despite the uncertainty, the ship continued its course. With limited officers on board, the crew's diverse skills were acknowledged, hinting at potential boat expeditions. The night preparations were made, and the crew awaited any signs of activity from the shore. The clock struck midnight as the Bronx remained vigilant for any vessels attempting to leave the bay. Christy and Mr. Flint discussed the need for more officers and the crew's potential for leadership roles.|"[""1.

Quartermaster Camden, a navy seaman, was appointed second lieutenant by the executive officer. Ralph Pennant, a knowledgeable sailor, was expected to be promoted to third lieutenant. Despite his past struggles with alcohol, Pennant's dedication had won the crew's admiration. As the crew cheered his appointment, it became clear that both Camden and Pennant were natural leaders. The commander, impressed by Pennant's popularity, promised to find him suitable accommodations. Meanwhile, the ship's prisoners slept soundly under guard, as the fog enveloped the vessel in the early morning hours.|"[""1.

The third lieutenant quickly followed the order, with Christy trailing behind at a more measured pace, maintaining his dignity as the highest-ranking officer aboard. Christy's main concern was composure, not just dignity. A light had been spotted on the starboard bow, hinting at various possibilities like a blockade runner or a nearby battery. The captain moved to the bridge but couldn't see the light, so he climbed the fore-rigging. The lookout confirmed the light had vanished. Christy deduced the light was to the east, possibly near the entrance to St. Andrew's Bay. The Bronx seemed on course despite minor deviations. The fog obscured the light, but Christy anticipated it clearing with the rising sun. A faint sound from the south prompted Christy to send Mr. Pennant and a crew to investigate quietly. The crew, led by Mr. Pennant, rowed silently into the fog, ready to follow Christy's orders meticulously.|"[""1.

The boat moved forward quietly, guided by the quartermaster scanning the fog. As daylight broke, they steered southward following signals from Vincent. Soon, the sounds were clear, and the officer changed the course towards a small sloop. The crew rowed swiftly towards the sailboat, but upon being hailed, the sloop attempted to flee. The officer suspected the men on the sloop might be civilians and ordered them to stop for further inspection. However, the men on the sloop fired muskets at the approaching cutter, injuring one of the crew members. The officer swiftly directed the wounded man to safety as the tense situation unfolded.|['1.

The boat's progress continued despite the attack. Within a minute, it collided with the sloop. The quartermaster secured the sloop and disarmed its occupants. The lieutenant, Mr. Pennant, remained polite even in the face of hostility. The captain of the sloop, Flanger, regretted the situation and blamed his crew for not following orders. The boat's crew subdued the sloop's occupants, including a man in black who appeared troubled. The skipper of the sloop, possibly of mixed race, remained neutral. The sloop's crew was disarmed and the boat was towed back to the gunboat. One crew member, Hilton, was injured but stable. The lieutenant ensured his comfort before proceeding.|"[""1.

At dawn, the fog lifted as the boat approached a gunboat. The crew had captured a small sloop, the Magnolia, with eleven prisoners. Lieutenant Hilton, wounded, was the first to be taken aboard for medical care. The commander, Christy, was surprised to see his uncle among the captives. Despite the circumstances, Christy assured his uncle of respectful treatment. Meanwhile, the wounded lieutenant reported on the operation. Dr. Connelly treated Hilton's injury, ensuring his recovery in a few weeks. Christy and the lieutenant discussed the mysterious gentleman in black found on the sloop, speculating on his role.

The lieutenant fulfilled his duty by bringing a devoted Confederate supporter on board. He was instructed to have his wound treated and went to the ward room where the surgeon awaited. Meanwhile, Christy engaged the sloop's skipper and the octoroon, a large man, who could have caused trouble if inclined. The skipper, showing dignity despite his mixed heritage, conversed with Christy, revealing his name as Mike.

The boatswain's whistle blew on the steamer, and all hands quickly gathered at their stations. The crew, mostly seasoned men from the Bronx, were prepared for action. The prisoners watched keenly, especially Michael Bornhoff, eager to assist. Captain Flanger was kept away from the action. Captain Passford briefed Mr. Flint on a plan to capture a steamer in St. Andrew's Bay. The crew readied the boats, and Michael, an able seaman and pilot, joined the expedition. The cutters, with twelve men each, set off into the fog. Captain Passford pondered the information from Mike and felt the weight of his new command. He wrestled with the navy's traditions that kept him from active missions. With vessels loading cotton for blockade running, Christy faced tough decisions, especially with prisoners and a captured sloop onboard.

The plan worked well until a certain point, and Corny took control of the steamer, pretending to be the real officer in front of the commodore and even on the ship where the commander was known. Christy explained that he didn't do it himself but had Byron help him. The last event took place on the Bronx around eight in the evening. Christy had hidden on board and, with the help of officers who recognized him, took over the vessel.

Upon meeting the commodore, Christy handed over his reports, explaining the events that had transpired. The commodore praised Christy for his actions, recognizing the importance of his work. Despite the success, Christy was swiftly given new orders for another expedition, this time involving the Floridian. The commodore handed Christy sealed orders, instructing him to set sail southwest immediately and open the orders at midnight.

After bidding farewell to his uncle, Christy returned to his vessel, where preparations were underway for the new mission.

"""Good evening, Captain Passford,"" greeted the stranger. ""I waited for you at supper, but as you didn't come, I made myself at home,"" he continued. Christy, surprised, couldn't recognize the man. He hadn't paid much attention to the prisoners from the Magnolia, except for his uncle. The stranger, a stout man in his forties, dressed as a sailor, claimed to be Captain Boyd Flanger. Christy, the commander, found it odd to have a stranger in his cabin. Flanger declined the steward's offer to inform Christy of his presence earlier. Dave, the steward, was signaled to stand behind Christy. The stranger introduced himself as Flanger, formerly in charge of the Floridian. Christy, now aware of Flanger's identity, was cautious. Flanger, despite his polite demeanor, hinted at causing trouble. He revealed handcuffs on his wrist, hinting at his past actions."|"['1.

"""I apologize, Captain Passford, for going against your order,"" interrupted the unexpected visitor calmly. ""Dave won't obey that order. He knows better."" Christy was sure Dave had been threatened to stay in the cabin, possibly at gunpoint. The steward seemed ready to act with caution and energy. Captain Flanger, previously a prisoner, had somehow freed himself and appeared on board. Christy, armed only with his sword, saw the intruder had revolvers. Knowing open confrontation could be deadly, Christy planned to retrieve his revolvers from his stateroom discreetly but was blocked. The visitor hinted at a purpose for the visit, implying dissatisfaction with the capture of the Magnolia.

Captain Flanger, armed with a revolver, interrupted Captain Passford while discussing his misfortunes. Christy, feeling tired, apologized and explained his need to stretch. Flanger, undeterred, expressed his intention to take control of the gunboat Bronx to replace his lost ship, the Floridian. Christy realized the intruder's dangerous plan and decided to play along to avoid harm. Flanger proposed that Christy issue orders on his behalf to the crew in writing to avoid resistance. Despite the risky situation, Christy understood the intruder's motives and agreed to cooperate to protect himself. The intruder planned to use the Bronx for his cause, intending to punish a crew member for revealing information.|"['1.

Captain Flanger, a pirate, had cornered Christy Passford, demanding to see his sealed orders. Refusing to betray his orders, Christy stood firm. Flanger, threatening violence, finally relented, deciding the orders weren't crucial at that moment. Instead, he instructed Christy to write an order to cut out a rebel privateer. As Christy wrote, Dave, the steward, dusted nearby. Flanger, still wielding his revolver, had Christy sign the order. The tense situation in the cabin was defused momentarily, with Flanger's focus on the written directive. Christy, intrigued by the unfolding plan, complied with Flanger's demands, hoping to glean more insight into the pirate's intentions.|"['1.

The steward had two feather dusters, one large and one medium-sized. He used the large one so much that only the quills were left. Captain Flanger was occupied and ignored the steward, Dave, due to his Southern upbringing. Dave realized the danger and, seizing the moment, struck the privateersman with the duster's head, confusing him. A struggle ensued, and Christy, armed with revolvers, intervened just in time to save Dave from Flanger's violent intentions. The officers arrived, subdued Flanger, and confiscated his weapon, ending the chaotic scene in the cabin.|"['1.

Christy, a doctor, seated himself and began recounting the intruder's visit. He checked his watch, realizing they had traveled 40 miles in three hours. Feeling vulnerable, he armed himself with a revolver. On deck, he spotted a larger steamer approaching. Unsure of its allegiance, Christy ordered the ensign hoisted. The steamer identified itself as the Bellevite, and its engineer warmly greeted Christy. Despite the warm reunion, Christy maintained professionalism. The engineer expressed a desire for Christy to return to the Bellevite. Christy inquired about those at home.|"['1.

Christy quickly recounted his adventure with Corny and the capture of the Floridian to the officers from the Bellevite. He explained that he was sailing under sealed orders and needed to get rid of a dangerous prisoner, Captain Flanger. Christy expressed his concerns about Flanger causing trouble if he got into a difficult situation. The officers assured Christy that they would take care of Flanger and send a boat to pick him up. They also shared news about chasing a steamer and Lieutenant Ballard's health. Paul advised Christy to write to his father about his feelings. Soon, Captain Flanger was taken away by sailors to be put in a boat, despite his resistance. The Bronx continued its course, and Christy felt grateful for narrowly avoiding harm. Later, the commander received sealed orders, hinting at a potential mission to attack Forts Jackson and St. Philip in New Orleans.

Christy received orders to sail the ship to Barataria Bay, a historical location known for its association with the famous pirate, Lafitte. The ship, Bronx, was chosen due to its light draft and speed to navigate the shallow waters of the bay. The crew discussed potential encounters with cotton vessels and privateers in the area. As the ship approached the South Pass of the Mississippi, Christy ensured the course was set correctly. He then studied the chart of Barataria Bay to familiarize himself with the surroundings.

Barataria Bay in Louisiana has shallow waters and is home to Isle Grande Terre with a fort at its western tip. The captain is cautious about the fort's strength and the risks to their ship, the Bronx. The bay's entrance has shoal water, extending two miles out into the Gulf. The Confederates are fortifying Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip on the lower Mississippi, making it a strategic area. Mr. Flint, the captain, plans a secret mission to gather information while avoiding the fort's guns. Michael Bornhoff, a loyal crew member, shares stories of smuggling cigars.

As the Bronx slowed down, a drift lead was put in the water. Lights were spotted in the distance, and the weather had turned cloudy. The third lieutenant was summoned and briefed. Mike would guide him to land near Fort Lafitte to check for other ships and assess the fort's strength. He was to be cautious and use his judgment. The crew readied the boat, oars muffled to avoid detection. Mr. Pennant and the Russian officer landed quietly. The lieutenant instructed Vincent to watch for a signal and explore the area with Mike.

The officer cautiously prepared his revolvers in the dark, ensuring they were ready for any potential danger. The village lay still and deserted at midnight, with the residents likely asleep in their cabins. They ventured into a silent house, using a lantern discreetly to avoid detection. Moving along the lane between cabins, they found one occupied by two elderly individuals and another by two women. The lieutenant recognized one of the men, Uncle Job, by his distinct features. They quietly woke him, confirming his identity. Moving to a distant deserted cabin, they discussed the information gathered about the fort's defenses.

Uncle Job pointed towards the bay, indicating a steamer stuck in the mud. The lieutenant, amused by Job's simplicity, learned more about the vessel. Job sneezed and ushered the officer and Mike into a cabin to avoid detection. The officer, disguised, reached the fort with Job's guidance. Inside, they found a sick soldier in pain. The lieutenant, with some medical knowledge, administered chloroform to ease the soldier's suffering. The Russian soldier was instructed to keep quiet about their actions.

A Confederate officer, possibly of French descent, sought relief from a painful condition. A supposed physician applied chloroform, causing temporary discomfort before easing the pain. The officer, polite and grateful, shared that the fort was nearly abandoned, with few guns remaining. Mr. Pennant, gathering information, learned that the fort was no longer a threat due to its limited defenses. As the day broke, he hurried back to the Bronx, a gunboat offshore. Despite a futile attempt by the fort to fire upon them, the crew of the cutter safely returned to the Bronx.

The lieutenant carefully observed the Bronx's movements, signaling that the fort posed no threat to the gunboat. As daylight increased, the Bronx headed southeast towards deeper waters. Mr. Pennant guided the cutter southward. The steamer grew smaller as it veered southwest. The lieutenant ordered a depth check, revealing eight feet. They turned west, rowing until another check showed sixteen feet. Mr. Pennant noted three buildings on the shore, a key marker for entering the bay. Avoiding the fort, they proceeded southeast, maintaining the correct range. Sounding revealed varying depths until they reached twenty feet. The Bronx approached, and Uncle Job was introduced to Captain Passford. The lieutenant and Uncle Job were summoned to the captain's cabin for a full report.|"['1.
