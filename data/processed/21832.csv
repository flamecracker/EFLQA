At Unity, Suros and Oma make a significant decision not to go back to their tribes. The Tuolo warrior and his family return, and a cottage is prepared for them. They are famished. The Professor explains his kind act to Chief Marmo, emphasizing the principles of justice. Marmo then accompanies the Professor around the town, providing an important lesson. Ralph and Jim take charge of the factory and send out hunters to gather yaks, while also laying out fields with wonderful vegetation. John and the Illyas engage in a planking movement around the Illyas, resulting in a charge that confuses the Illyas, leading to their retreat. The forest acts as a barrier, but they spot the main village, which surprises them with its unique design on an elevated plateau, surrounded by peculiar hills. The village appears fortified, adding to the mystery. Wagons are sent to the south to avoid the forest, but there is no communication from the team. Upon reaching the river, the teams are intercepted by the Illyas, who block them with steep banks. They set up camp and send messengers to John, prompting Muro to rush with the wagons to aid the force. A savage attack ensues, with a volley of fire coming from behind the Illyas.|"['1.

At Unity, the students embarked on their weekly outing to the vast forest in the west. The journey led them to Blakely's forest home, where they discovered intriguing driftwood and witnessed the fascinating movements of forest animals like the orangutan and monkeys. As they reached a hill, they encountered a scaling vine that led them to recessed rocks where they found two mysterious skeletons holding a gun, trinkets, a sextant, and a letter with no clear identity. The students made an effort to decipher the message, leading to the discovery of a mound where the bones were laid to rest. They decided to forward a copy of the message to John, who was exploring the Illyas' village. Upon John's return, he described the remarkable character of the village buildings and shared his encounters with the Tuolos as fighters.

Awaiting communication from John was crucial. A telegraph line was necessary, along with wireless telegraphy. Understanding the concepts of sound, power, and vibrations as universal forces was important. The focus shifted to B Street in Unity, where villagers were visited in their homes. Incentives were given to enhance the beauty of their houses, and larger dwellings were constructed for the chiefs. The schoolhouse played a vital role in the town's growth. Introducing marvels to the chiefs, including the mysterious practices of the white men, such as using a thermometer and teaching about medicine like Cinchona and Calisaya. The boys successfully reached the Illyas' village with liberated prisoners, ensuring their comfort. A white man, once John's companion, was discovered. The town was considered a health resort. The mystery surrounding a note led to commotion outside. Illyas' reinforcements from the south were captured, and provisions were made for the cultivation of the soil. George and Harry explored buildings, attempting to unravel the puzzle of the town's layout.|"[""1.

John and his friends embarked on a thrilling adventure to explore the caves near their town. Initially, they were intrigued by a treasure map that led them to the cave entrance. However, their journey took a turn when they encountered the Medicine men, who warned them of a dangerous fate if they entered the cave.

Despite the warning, John bravely ventured into the cave and discovered the Krishnos, mysterious beings residing within.

Oroto was amazed by Marmo's unexpected arrival. Eager to meet the esteemed White Chief, Oroto was filled with anticipation. The Professor warmly greeted the chief of the Illyas, which left Oroto pleasantly surprised by the display of friendship. His trust in the wise men wavered as he pondered the mysteries of life and death. The unity among the tribes brought him to a state of peace. Oroto and Marmo held discussions, celebrating the accomplishments of two years, including the construction of a ship for the journey home. Amidst the joy, a tinge of sadness lingered. The engineering prowess of Unity was evident in the harmonious coexistence of different tribes, thriving on rich soil in new houses. The community boasted a printing press, a schoolhouse, and even paper-making capabilities. However, one essential element was missing - the flag. The flagpole was erected, and in a grand ceremony, OLD GLORY was raised, symbolizing unity and progress.|['1.

Muro expressed admiration for the remarkable man, noting his refusal to harm his adversaries and his compassionate act of healing a Kurabus. This man's enemies became their enemies, and his friends, their friends. A while back, the Professor and two boys, George Mayfield and Harry Crandall, were shipwrecked on an island after being cast ashore. They had to start from scratch, creating tools and machinery for survival. They built a home, established a water wheel, workshop, and laboratory, and even learned to make clothing and obtain food. The group also encountered savage tribes and rescued shipwrecked companions. Battles ensued, leading to alliances and victories against hostile tribes. Plans were made to consolidate forces and resources strategically. The Professor emphasized the importance of organization and delegation of tasks to ensure success in their endeavors.|['1.

The Professor commended the boys for their wise suggestion to strengthen their bond. The group, led by George, included four boys and an orangutan named Angel, known for his remarkable abilities. The council decided on a plan: one hundred and fifty men would retrieve supplies, while the rest would protect their friends' village. Ralsea and twenty men were tasked with bringing the Great Chief Suros for consultation. Blakely proposed training selected men in gun use. The boys eagerly joined the expedition. Upon reaching the Brabos' village, runners announced their arrival, sparking curiosity among the locals. The group settled in, with the Professor declining the chief's hut and gifting a mirror. The next morning, John and his party departed for Cataract, cheered by the sight of their flag. The flag symbolized protection and unity, cherished by the group.|"['1.

John instructed the boys to entertain their visitors on the first day, showcasing everything and amusing them. The boys started the water wheel, impressing the warriors who watched them set up the sawmill. They operated various machines like the grindstone, lathe, and gristmill. With some barley left to grind, the warriors assisted in milling flour. A bullock was roasted for the main meal, along with vegetables cooked by George. He improvised a Dutch oven for baking bread. The meal was a feast with honey and sugar as novelties for the visitors. After eating, John suggested making gun barrels from cast-steel bars and forging spears and bolos for the journey ahead.|"['1.

In the village, all warriors had a common tattoo. Ralph inquired about this practice, and John explained that tattoos were a way to decorate and distinguish individuals. Chiefs had unique tattoos to denote their rank. The names of warriors were descriptive, like Sitting Bull and Rain in the Face. Blakely organized the warriors with the help of Ralsea and Sutoto. The Professor welcomed Chief Suros from the south with a party of thirty men. They planned to teach the tribe new skills and build relationships. The boys, Jim and Will, assisted the Professor, impressed by the natives' quick learning abilities. Despite their agility, the natives seemed to remain stagnant in progress.|"[""1.

"The teacher smiled at the comment and responded, ""Sir John Lubbock, a famous English naturalist, described the savage mind as having the traits of both children and adults. Their simplicity can be a weakness, but if properly guided, they can become strong individuals."" Many writers believe that savages lack a clear and concise set of laws, as orderliness is not a priority for them. They tend to focus on immediate needs, much like children. Although their reasoning skills are not lacking, they are not fully developed. Jim's insight was accurate, as Blakely discovered when dealing with the natives. By uniting them for common defense, they became more effective. Sutoto, a key figure, brought news that the tribes were moving eastward. The Professor, along with chiefs Oma and Suros, worked on uniting the tribes and establishing a government that suited everyone. During their journey, hunters captured two Kurabus, including one they had previously treated kindly. John, feeling betrayed, confronted them sternly. The group continued their preparations for defense, making weapons and readying the wagon for the journey ahead."|"['1.

During the day and at night, the work continued diligently. After losing some yaks months before, a pair was trained to drive again for the upcoming journey. John, Muro, and Uraso selected reliable scouts to head west and monitor enemy movements. Meanwhile, Sutoto rushed to warn the village of potential danger. Blakely, eager to help, set out immediately, reaching the village by afternoon. Fascinated by the water wheel, sawmill, and other inventions, Sutoto barely paused for meals. The scouts reported that the enemies were still waiting, unaware of Blakely's presence. When the allies began moving east, Blakely organized a plan to intercept them, ensuring the safety of their friends at the white man's home.

"Before four o'clock, the allies were taken by surprise as they crossed a stream near the Cataract River. Blakely's forces, strategically placed on higher ground, blocked their path. John and Ralsea emerged, urging the allies to release their captives for peace. The allies, visibly alarmed, agreed to hold a council.

Professor, upon receiving news of more warriors heading to aid the allies, swiftly planned to intercept them. Leading a hundred warriors, he aimed to capture the Kurabus' warriors and villages to deter further attacks. Scouts confirmed the presence of warriors, and a clever trap was set. The Professor's warriors surrounded the Kurabus, who surrendered without resistance.

The captured warriors were taken back to the Brabos' village. Meanwhile, Blakely halted the allies' advance, awaiting their response.

The news spread among the people, sparking enthusiasm as they learned the value of working together and having guidance. Progress at the Cataract was promising, with reports indicating that thirty guns would soon be ready. Stut excelled at forging arrowheads, a task that intrigued him. Metal arrows were crafted to attach to shafts with ramie fiber. The root of a valuable vegetable was turned into a fermented dish by the natives. The boys, including Harry, discussed the cave and its treasures with John. Plans were made to load ammunition and provisions onto the new wagon. They drove to the cavern entrance discreetly, aiming to keep their visit and intentions secret. Messages arrived reporting a skirmish with local tribes, prompting preparations for assistance. John instructed to draw the tribes towards them while maintaining the appearance of retreat until the following day.|"['1.

Late that afternoon, John and the boys returned to the hill and swiftly entered the cave. They carefully brought all the vessels from the first recess to the entrance, some so heavy that four had to carry each load. After searching the inner recess for treasures, they stored everything in the wagon before heading to the Cataract. As they departed, a bird's night cry made Ralph shudder. The following morning was bustling with activity as they loaded wagons with items from the shop, lab, and home. By noon, all bundles were secured for the journey. The warriors gladly accepted heavy loads, showing their dedication. Armed and led by the boys, the group ascended the hill, forming a circle around a staff. Angel mounted the pole, and everyone showed respect. The boys bid farewell to their home at the Cataract, leaving only the water wheel behind.|"['1.

It seems unbelievable that the items at the Cataract could fill more than a hundred packages, excluding what was in the wagon. The next morning, when all the supplies were laid out, it was quite a sight. Two wagons were brought out, with Harry and Tom in charge of one, and George and Ralph leading the other. They had made twenty-five loads for the scouts, ensuring that they could carry double loads for scouting missions. The lumber, cut six months earlier, was dry and valuable for their upcoming tasks. Uraso insisted on taking all the material. Additionally, the warriors carried thirty-two guns, bows, arrows, and some had spears. The allies were alerted by messengers from John, prompting a strategic move by Muro to protect the Professor.|"['1.

When Tastoa, the chief, arrived at the camp, he calmly observed the warriors but did not show any signs of alarm. He walked straight to the Professor with folded arms, displaying a dignified demeanor despite feeling humiliated. It was clear from his expression that he was surrendering to the White Chief and not to his former allies or enemies. In a previous encounter, the Kurabus and Saboros, who were allied against the Professor, had a falling out on the way, leading to a split and hostility. The White Chief explained that he did not harm their villages or families when he easily could have, earning their trust. The chief was puzzled by this new approach to warfare, where the enemy was allowed to return unharmed. The White Chief emphasized the importance of treating enemies with respect and teaching a new way of living, which deeply moved Tastoa and his people.|"[""1.

The Chief was amazed by the return of the weapons and was barely able to speak. He approached the Professor, expressing gratitude. The group then headed to the Brabos' village, where they were warmly welcomed. The villagers danced and celebrated, showing their joy. Later, the Professor addressed the villagers, emphasizing the importance of unity and respect for each other's property. He promised to teach them how to make incredible things and establish a workshop. Despite the boys' disappointment about the yaks left behind, Sutoto volunteered to retrieve them with some warriors. The boys, although eager to join, had to assist in setting up the workshop. The next day, they visited the Kurabus' village, seeking to teach them as well. The exchange of knowledge and understanding among the tribes was a significant step towards unity and cooperation.|"[""1.

Blakely was seen training warriors, who saluted him as if it were second nature. This tradition dates back to medieval English tournaments where knights shielded their eyes from the beauty of the 'Queen of Beauty.' Uraso led the group to a remarkable tree with sprawling branches and roots that served as supports. Blakely explained how trees' buds act like roots. He compared the movement of sap to oil in a lamp through capillary attraction. The group discussed setting up their home near the falls, close to the river and forest.

"The leaders chose who would stay, and the rest were told to go back home with the promise of joining the new village later. ""I'll draw a plan for now.

Within a week, unsettling rumors reached the new village about the Illyas and Tuolos. The Illyas sent an insulting message to the White Chief, demanding he come for the captives. The Tuolos had returned home, but John insisted on visiting them. So far, no warring tribes had bothered the Saboros or the Brabos nearby. Muro believed patience would resolve the situation with the Illyas without violence, but he had a different view on the Tuolos. The shop and laboratory were finished, and the treasure was secured in an underground vault. The Professor scouted for copper in the hills to the north. They crafted molds to mint coins, with the treasury holding over twenty-five hundred coins within a week, a promising start in their new economy.|"['1.

To ensure fair transactions, a system of coins was introduced among the warriors. Each coin had a set value, and they were given as rewards for their work. The warriors were then able to use these coins to purchase goods like cloth. This new form of barter intrigued the natives, who quickly grasped the concept. Soon, they began trading with the boys, exchanging coins for various items. The Professor saw this as an opportunity to not only encourage individual effort but also to teach the natives about trade and commerce. By introducing them to a new way of earning and spending, the Professor hoped to foster a sense of economic independence and cooperation among the tribes.|['1.

In a past tale, John recounted a fascinating story about a vast cave near their village, where he found refuge and stumbled upon a trove of treasure. When news arrived that a rival tribe had attacked, it was clear they needed to act. Blakely suggested confronting the Illyas first, being the stronger tribe. The plan was set in motion, with a force of two hundred gathering swiftly. Meanwhile, the Professor and his companions explored the island, collecting various plants and minerals. They marveled at the diversity of life, pondering how each plant, though from the same soil, could yield such different products due to their unique sensitivities. As the warriors trained with new weapons, the boys watched in awe, preparing for the upcoming expedition against the Tuolos.|"['1.

A group of warriors, well-prepared with supplies and ammunition, departed the village towards the north for easier travel. Their plan was to head west and cross a river to meet the Brabos on the other side. John and his companions discussed their previous encounters with the Tuolos and strategized their approach. Scouts spotted signs of the Tuolos, prompting caution. As night fell, Muro returned with news of a feast and potential sacrifices by the Tuolos. The group decided to investigate and prevent any harm. They observed a festival in the village and discovered a hidden cave entrance. Lighting a match, they glimpsed a moving white cross inside. Further exploration revealed evidence of recent habitation.

Before they reached the entrance, a loud noise outside caught their attention, and their own people were seen scurrying back and forth. As they stepped out, three oddly dressed locals crossed their path. In the native tongue, John commanded them to stop, and they hesitated. The boys aimed their guns, and the natives yielded as Muro and his group hurried over. Quickly, they were escorted down to the wagon. It appeared that when the Krishnos returned from the village, they stumbled upon the camp, triggering the guards. If they had made it to the cave, their superstitions would have kept them out, but outside they had no such qualms. Luckily, John and the boys were there to block their entry. As they descended the hill, John displayed a unique stone cross he had found in the cave. The cross, a symbol dating back thousands of years, was used by ancient civilizations like the Babylonians, Persians, Hittites, and Egyptians. The camp remained calm, but the scouts monitored the situation closely. Muro was confident the Krishnos wouldn't abandon their village without a fight. While John conversed with the Krishnos, he subtly lit a match, causing them to believe the Great Spirit was displeased with their lies. The Krishnos were frightened, realizing their deceit was exposed, and they were led back to the village to convey John's message to the chiefs in Muro's presence.|"['1.

Muro and the warriors stayed back with guns, while the Krishnos entered the village. After waiting silently, a commotion arose, growing louder. The boys recognized the hut where they were held captive and rescued. Ralph pointed it out to John, explaining it was where they were found. A tense situation unfolded as Muro instructed the guards. Two Tuolos, resembling those sent to the village, arrived. John expressed interest in a cave on the hill where the Tuolos conducted rituals. When questioned, the Tuolos remained silent, following Muro's predicted behavior. John signaled for their capture, shocking the warriors and the Krishnos. After a display of power, the Krishnos begged for mercy and agreed to John's terms. As dawn approached, tensions rose among the tribes, with the Krishnos' fate hanging in the balance.|"['1.

John initiated the conversation, addressing the chief of the Tuolos tribe. He conveyed that the white people sought peace and had strong support from other tribes. John warned that resistance would lead to a battle they could not win, emphasizing the importance of surrender. He reminded the chief of the Krishnos' advice to surrender and not to believe in false claims about the Great Spirit wanting harm. The warriors surrounding the village demonstrated the white chief's commitment to peace and unity among tribes. The Tuolo chief, influenced by these events, released the captured Brabo warriors. The arrival of a wagon intrigued the villagers, and the boys, Ralph and Tom, saluted the chief respectfully. The display of arms training by the white men impressed the Tuolos. Meanwhile, the Krishnos faced consequences for their deceitful actions. The Professor, back at the colony, received threats from the Illyas and Tuolos, prompting preparations for defense.|"['1.

George and Jim, along with a few other men, were busy constructing chairs and tables for the houses, while the women continued weaving cloth. The women, accompanied by their children, were welcomed by the Professor and assigned to the cottages. Each family was expected to pay for their home and make the surroundings appealing by planting flowers. The workers were encouraged to be self-sufficient, with families providing their own food to earn more coins. This led to some resorting to dishonest means to acquire coins, but the Professor emphasized honesty. When a thief was caught, a trial was held where the accused was allowed to defend themselves.

The Professor, highly respected by all except the Kurabus, aimed to establish a government to end intertribal conflicts. John relayed the Great White Chief's message to the Kurabus, urging them to join and learn how to prosper. The group then headed to the Krishno cave to retrieve valuable items. Inside, they marveled at the stunning stalactite formations. The party found the Krishnos' dwelling filled with unique tools and vessels salvaged from shipwrecks. Despite the risk, they collected the treasures, compensating for the loss of the ship _Adventurer_. The eastern chamber held even more valuable artifacts, which they carefully packed for transportation.|"[""1.

When the group exited the cave at 4 a.m., they were exhausted but carried a significant amount of treasure comparable to what was found near the Cataract. The next morning, the Tuolos were chosen, and their chief was welcomed into a wagon. John freed the Krishnos from the large hut, surprising them with their newfound freedom. Despite their confusion, John instructed the elderly Krishno to ride in the wagon, causing further bewilderment. As they departed, the natives observed the group, armed but not as prisoners, escorted with dignity. Two days later, as they neared the village, the chief was amazed by the transformation from wilderness to a bustling community. Welcomed by old foes turned friends, he learned about the advancements and harmony in the village, particularly impressed by the machinery and agricultural practices. The chief struggled to comprehend the concept of currency exchange and witnessed a trial, struggling to understand the new ways of the white man.|['1. What did the group find in the cave?\nA.

The Professor was surprised by the attention given to a minor incident. He emphasized at the trial that the act, not the value stolen, was wrong. He explained to Marmo that taking what isn't yours is a crime, regardless of the amount. The Professor's role was to oversee and ensure everyone worked diligently and obeyed laws, for which he was paid. He taught that earning respect as a leader was vital. Blakely, a skilled businessman, was tasked with organizing the town's affairs. The group discussed developing industries on the island, including agriculture and mining. Despite longing for home, they recognized the potential for growth on the island. The Professor and his team were committed to staying to help the natives progress, prioritizing their work over personal desires.|"['1.

John explained the plan that depended on a few factors: negotiating with the Illyas and constructing a boat to reach a nearby harbor linked to America. Osaga, the chief, needed laws for the land within their territory to avoid conflict. The idea was for Osaga to receive compensation and transfer land rights to the State. The State would oversee individual territories, ensuring protection and orderly land transactions. Uraso embraced this concept enthusiastically, highlighting the benefits. The focus shifted to the expedition to the Illyas, with preparations underway. Marmo faced resistance from some warriors engrossed in factory work. Despite initial doubts, Marmo observed unity among tribes and innovation in crafting new items. The Krishnos, under the Professor's care, were content and unwilling to leave due to the captivating environment.|"[""1.

"One evening, the Professor noticed a Tuolo worker sneaking up to the laboratory. The worker, after cautiously surveying the area, timidly entered and humbly asked to speak. ""I'm puzzled why my warriors aren't interested in war. They prefer learning about machinery and making things. The White Chief allows you to bring your family here, but remember your people. Share your knowledge with the village,"" the Professor advised. The worker was thrilled by the permission. Later, Tom was informed about the incident and suggested providing food for the worker's return journey, but he had already left. This eagerness to share knowledge with his people impressed everyone. George, Ralph, and Jim were always eager for new experiences. They discussed naming the town, with John jokingly suggesting ""Unity"" or ""Hustletown."" Harry, reflecting on the town's challenges, believed it didn't need a name if they worked hard to make it successful. The expedition against the Illyas was set for the next day, with George and Harry joining, while the others stayed behind to manage the town's affairs.

Over three hundred warriors gathered for the mission. One hundred were armed with muzzle-loading guns, each carrying twenty-five rounds. Before departure, the Professor addressed the warriors, emphasizing the mission was not for revenge but to retrieve captives held by tribes who had sent an insulting message. The warriors were urged to act under the chiefs' guidance and only resort to violence in self-defense. Muro, Uraso, and Ralsea accompanied the expedition, while other chiefs remained behind. The journey aimed to establish peace on the island and fulfill the Professor's vision. Upon reaching the Saboro village, the news of the Illyas' uprising was confirmed, but their welcome was warm. The warriors were treated to a feast, and gifts were exchanged, including mirrors and trinkets. The boys impressed the chief's family with their skills, and Muro's son showcased his craftsmanship.

In a village, two contrasting burials took place. One was for a fallen warrior who was left in an open space beyond the town on a hanging cot. The other burial was for a tribe member who passed away the next day. The Professor noted the significance of these ceremonies, explaining that warriors who die in battle are usually not buried, especially if they are from the losing side. The boys learned about the beliefs of African tribes regarding the Great Spirit, associating natural elements with spiritual beings. Suros, a native, shared his views on honor and the importance of treating people well. The boys also observed the primitive lifestyle of the villagers, particularly the women who wove cloth using plantain tree fibers. The Professor encouraged the women to use modern looms, recognizing their talent and interest in weaving. Additionally, a store was established to provide food supplies for the community.|['Question 1:\nWhat did the Professor note about warriors who die in battle?\nA) They are usually buried in a special tomb.\nB) They are buried in a hanging cot beyond the town.\nC) They are not buried, especially if they are from the losing side.\nD) They are buried with all their weapons and armor.\nE) They are buried in the village square for everyone to see.', 'Question 2:\nWhat did the boys learn about the beliefs of African tribes from the Professor?\nA) The tribes do not believe in any spiritual beings.\nB) The tribes associate natural elements with spiritual beings.\nC) The tribes only believe in the Great Spirit.\nD) The tribes believe that spirits have no connection to nature.\nE) The tribes worship animals as their spiritual beings.', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Suros share his views on?\nA) The importance of modern technology in daily life.\nB) The significance of farming in the village.\nC) The importance of treating people well and honor.\nD) The benefits of living a primitive lifestyle.\nE) The need for more warriors in the tribe.', 'Question 4:\nWhat did the boys observe about the primitive lifestyle of the villagers?\nA) The villagers had advanced technology in their homes.\nB) The villagers had no knowledge of weaving.\nC) The women wove cloth using plantain tree fibers.\nD) The men were responsible for weaving in the village.\nE) The villagers had no interest in modern tools.', 'Question 5:\nWhat did the Professor encourage the women to use for weaving?\nA) Traditional tools made of stone.\nB) Modern looms.\nC) Wooden frames.\nD) Clay pots.\nE) Animal hides.', 'Question 6:\nWhat was established to provide food supplies for the community?\nA) A school for the children.\nB) A marketplace for trading goods.\nC) A store for food supplies.\nD) A training center for weaving.\nE) A cultural center for storytelling.']|['C) They are not buried, especially if they are from the losing side.', 'B) The tribes associate natural elements with spiritual beings.', 'C) The importance of treating people well and honor.', 'C) The women wove cloth using plantain tree fibers.', 'B) Modern looms.', 'C) A store for food supplies.']
The Professor encouraged individual effort by offering rewards for certain items, which were then sold in the store to families. Gradually, workers learned the value of coins and goods. They began to understand that they needed to pay for their board, leading to the production of kitchen utensils like cooking vessels. The Professor oversaw the extraction of metals from ores like iron, which were used to make valuable items. The workers' homes were furnished with chairs, tables, and proper beds for comfort and cleanliness. The Professor emphasized the importance of hygiene, especially after many children fell ill due to poor sanitation. The natives used fish fin combs, which were unsanitary, until they started making combs from bamboo and ironwood. Scouting reports revealed potential threats ahead, while ceremonies were held to appease the Great Spirit during periods of darkness. John's questions hinted at a hidden motive related to the Illyas village and surrounding areas.|"['1.

We can arrive there in two days, unless we encounter the Illyas on the way. They likely won't back down without a fight, knowing we're advancing against them. At their current pace, they'll likely reach the enemy's main force during the day, unless they retreat. The route from Unity through Saboro featured vast plains and lush forests, hinting at fertile soil. The weather was splendid, with ample moisture for greenery. The march continued joyfully, warriors seemingly heading to a festival rather than battle. Scouts spotted scattered enemy bands, suggesting their proximity. Divisions between territories were vague, often leading to disputes. The main enemy force was sighted around five in the evening. John, Uraso, and Muro scouted ahead, choosing a campsite and setting up guards. No gunfire was allowed overnight, with guards from different tribes stationed in pairs for safety. The next morning, forces prepared to approach the Illyas' camp, aiming to retrieve captives peacefully.|"[""1.

Behind the camp lay a dense forest that could provide shelter in case of retreat. The camp's position, situated by a river bend, made it secure against native weapons. The Illyas didn't anticipate facing foes armed with guns like their allies had. They couldn't fathom how their enemies could mass-produce enough guns to match their numbers and skills. John learned from Uraso about the tribe's history, once dominant on the island. Bitter rivalries among leading families led to constant tribal warfare. The Berees were the fairest tribe, with white blood from castaways in their lineage. Suros of the Berees decided to settle at Unity, followed by Oma of the Brabos. The unity of these tribes aligned with the Professor's vision. Marmo of the Tuolos, astonished by the Professor's kindness, realized that everyone, regardless of background, deserved respect and opportunity.|"['1.

In the village, there was a lesson about unity and justice. The Professor showed kindness to all, regardless of tribe. This act of fairness spread through families and became a topic of discussion. Meanwhile, at the factory, Ralph and Jim were busy making agricultural tools. The Professor suggested capturing yaks to aid in farming. A hunt was organized with Blakely's help, and the first batch of animals was successfully tamed. The town transformed into a bustling hub of agricultural activity, with fields being cultivated and various seeds planted. Fruit trees were also introduced to enhance the landscape. This initiative aimed to create a sustainable and harmonious community.|"[""1.

"When the captive Illyas John sent with a message didn't return, and the enemy showed no signs of surrender as midday approached, a quick and forceful assault was deemed necessary. ""Cross the stream and flank them in the woods. I will lead the attack while you stay back. If they try to retreat, I will pursue them. Our goal is to make them surrender."" The two forces moved swiftly, and John believed they were in position within thirty minutes. The Illyas remained on the hill, unaware of the flanking columns. Suddenly, gunfire erupted to the right, where Muro's reinforcements engaged the enemy. This caused chaos among the Illyas. Uraso, suspecting the situation, ambushed them from the left, causing them to flee in disarray. The Illyas were in disarray, with John capturing their camp. Despite some escaping, Uraso suggested a plan to intercept them. The pursuing forces followed the fleeing Illyas through a dense forest, aiming to catch up with them. The forest posed a challenge, but they pressed on, determined to reach the main village. The pursuing force spent hours navigating the dense forest, finally emerging near the main village, where a significant confrontation was imminent.

Uraso explained that they were heading to the oldest village in the country, which was once a grand place with large houses built by unknown people for unknown purposes. As they approached, John was amazed by the unique buildings set on an elevated plateau surrounded by magnificent trees, especially the towering redwoods. Crossing a stream, they caught a glimpse of the village strategically located for drainage and with commanding views. John pondered the mystery as they encountered two captured Illyas, who remained silent despite questioning. Unease grew as the wagons were en route from the south, where the Illyas were coming from. The group faced an ambush, prompting defensive actions and a strategic camp setup for the night. With the threat of reinforcements looming, caution was paramount as they awaited further developments.|"['1.

Muro, a skilled tactician, swiftly acted upon the intelligence provided by the scouts. With the attackers to the south and an impassable ravine to the north, Muro's force strategically moved back to conceal their presence from the Illyas. Harry and George, seasoned fighters, faced uncertainty about their opponents' numbers but remained confident in John's eventual rescue. As the Illyas relentlessly advanced, a sudden volley from Muro's men prompted the Illyas to seek cover. Muro's timely arrival led to a joyous reunion with Stut and the boys. After a quick breakfast, preparations were made to return to John for the capture of the Illyas' village. The Professor often took the boys on outings towards the forest west of the river, explaining the forces of centrifugal and centripetal acting on objects on Earth's surface, causing them to lag behind and move westward due to the planet's rotation.|"['1.

Blakely showed the boys a hill three miles west of the river. Armed with guns, the group ventured into the forest to explore. They marveled at the tall trees like pitch pines and redwoods. Soon, they encountered animals like a wary panther. The boys, eager for a shot, chased the panther until Ralph successfully hit it. The panther, though wounded, leaped towards them. Quick action from Jim saved the day, shooting the panther in the eye. The group skinned the panther, proud of their first big game trophy. They wished Angel had joined to see the orangutans and marmosets. As they headed north towards the hill, Blakely pointed out the path. They found a vine ladder leading to a hidden rocky recess. Blakely shared how he stumbled upon the spot by accident.|"['1.

Blakely swiftly moved towards the spot where Will had come from, followed by the boys. Ahead, on the ledge, lay two skeletons, startling the boys. The Professor paused to examine them closely. Among the scattered items were a sextant, knives, coins, keys, German letters, and a revolver without ammunition. The skeletons, lying peacefully close together, intrigued the group. One appeared Caucasian, the other an aborigine. A scrap of paper revealed clues, hinting at the Illyas' village west of the mountains. The Professor sent a messenger to John with this information. Meanwhile, John strategized for a potential encounter with the Illyas, noting their unique combat tactics. A captured warrior was given an ultimatum to return captives and agree to stay within their territory. The tense wait for the Illyas' response began.|"['Question 1: What did the group find on the ledge that startled the boys?\nA) A sextant\nB) Knives\nC) Coins\nD) Two skeletons\nE) German letters', 'Question 2: What did the Professor examine closely among the scattered items?\nA) Keys\nB) A revolver without ammunition\nC) German letters\nD) Coins\nE) A sextant', ""Question 3: What did the scrap of paper reveal about the Illyas' village?\nA) It was east of the mountains\nB) It was south of the mountains\nC) It was north of the mountains\nD) It was west of the mountains\nE) It was on the mountains"", 'Question 4: How did John strategize for a potential encounter with the Illyas?\nA) By sending a messenger with information\nB) By examining the skeletons\nC) By capturing a warrior\nD) By examining the scrap of paper\nE) By noting their combat tactics', ""Question 5: What ultimatum was given to the captured warrior by John?\nA) To return the scrap of paper\nB) To agree to stay within their territory\nC) To return captives and agree to stay within their territory\nD) To join the group\nE) To reveal the location of the Illyas' village"", ""Question 6: What did the group do while waiting for the Illyas' response?\nA) Examined the skeletons\nB) Sent a messenger\nC) Strategized for potential encounters\nD) Captured a warrior\nE) Waited tensely""]"|['D) Two skeletons', 'B) A revolver without ammunition', 'D) It was west of the mountains', 'E) By noting their combat tactics', 'C) To return captives and agree to stay within their territory', 'E) Waited tensely']
The leaders refuse to obey the White Chief's commands. They claim the captives as their own and plan to hold onto them. If the village is attacked, both the white chiefs and the tribes will face destruction. They show no fear of him or his firearms. John signaled for the warrior to leave. Initially astonished, the warrior realized that under different circumstances, such a message would have meant his demise. Uraso approached him, reassuring him that they would keep their promise. The Illyas are warned of their foolishness and impending defeat. The village is encircled, cutting off any hope of aid from neighboring villages. John strategizes an attack plan, utilizing the cover of night to approach from the east side and surprise the enemy at dawn. George and John discuss the village's diverse architecture, pondering the reasons behind the different styles.|"[""1.

During the night, preparations were made for a swift move of the main force to the east. Works were visibly set up in the west of the village during the afternoon. John, who closely watched the village, noticed the warriors being directed to face these preparations. Before four in the morning, the warriors marched out, circling to the right, and soon positioned themselves close to the east line, well hidden. The plan was for Muro's men to start the attack at daybreak, signaled by four gunshots, prompting the main force to rush in. The entire force advanced at the signal, reaching the entrenchments. John and Uraso were the first to leap over and wait for the warriors to form the line. The Illyas were thrown into disarray, attempting to escape but were captured by Harry and George. Muro, seizing the moment, led an attack on the disorganized Illyas, ensuring their surrender.|['1.

The group led by Uraso was moving towards the warriors who were surrendering their weapons one by one. They were then surrounded by Muro and Uraso's men in the central part of the village. John hurried back to the chiefs who were cordoned off. Soon, women and children emerged from the huts, wailing and shrieking, fearing captivity. The chaotic scene unfolded as the women expressed their anguish. John signaled Muro and Uraso to lead the chiefs inside a building. The boys eagerly followed, entering a hall with smaller rooms on each side. The interior resembled a Western home but was in a dilapidated state, filled with broken furniture and dirt. Uraso returned with the chiefs, allowing the boys to observe the famous chief of the Illyas, a man of authority with a regal demeanor.|['1.

The sudden question stunned John, the first time he spoke. The chiefs, Muro and Uraso, had ignored him as they walked to the council chamber, possibly irking him. Their dismissive behavior may have been deliberate to heighten his humiliation. John, feeling nettled, demanded to know their intentions. The chief, surprised, explained they had taken everything without seeking permission and awaited John's cooperation. Despite George's decree, Uraso privately assured John of his honesty, contrasting the chief's deceit. When pressured to speak, the chief's judgment, condemning him to a humiliating punishment, shocked all. The disgrace of a chief being whipped for lying was a severe blow, shattering the chief's composure and dignity.|"[""1.

As they crossed the open space, Uraso and Muro pleaded with John to spare the punishment, but he insisted on reaching the designated spot first. John then spoke to the chief, saying that he had decided not to punish him for lying based on the advice of his friends. Instead, they were to go see the Great White Chief who might decide against the punishment. Uraso warned the chief about the danger of resisting the white man and urged him to cooperate. John ordered the wagons to be brought in and one to be unloaded, while the other would carry twenty-five armed men with Sama. The chief indicated they had five prisoners. The boys, including Lolo, had learned a lot in the ten days they were together. They spotted the village after two hours, creating excitement among the boys. Warriors from the Illyas appeared but stepped back when they saw the approaching group. Stut instructed Sama to inform them that they were there on Oroto's command. The warriors were puzzled but allowed the wagon to pass, lining up behind it. The boys, led by Lolo, quickly broke into the village, freeing George and Harry without delay.|['1.

"The distressing sight that met their gaze was heart-wrenching. The five captives appeared in a pitiful state. Two of the three boys were sprawled on dirty hay, while a man, also severely emaciated, lay on the opposite side. ""Who is this?"" came a weak voice from one of the boys. George knelt down. ""Harry, here is Robert—Robert Lamson; and who are you?"" He then moved over to the other person, who weakly turned his gaze. Tears streamed down the faces of all the boys. Lolo was deeply moved but remained composed. With Stut's help, they carried out Robert, while Harry effortlessly lifted Min. As they returned to the hut, they found the warriors gathered around one of the men, engaged in animated conversation. The man was a Saboro, recognized by Stut as one of their people believed to have been sacrificed long ago. The other man, a white individual, seemed dazed and unaware of his visitors. The Saboro appeared to be in better physical shape than the rest. The captives were provided with meager food, which they devoured gratefully. Robert expressed gratitude for the rescue and shared their failed attempts to escape towards the northeast side of the island where they believed white people lived.

The Professor explained that sound is created by vibrations, with the ear detecting as low as sixteen vibrations per second for bass notes and up to 12,000 vibrations per second. Nature communicates through motion, like the beating heart or the movement of leaves. Ralph recalled a story about a fakir claiming to move objects miles away in minutes, which the Professor debunked as requiring immense power. The community, once lacking ambition, now thrived with new families arriving daily. The Saboros, Berees, Osagas, and Kurabus settled in, with the town expanding rapidly.

The Chief Oroto was amazed by the new things he saw. The Kurabu medicine men, under the Professor's care, were intrigued by the white men's abilities. The Professor introduced them to chemistry and showed them how to work with metals. The men were so impressed that they eagerly learned new skills, including English. They became engrossed in learning and helping the sick. Talala, a bright man, excelled in chemical experiments.

In a mysterious chamber of the cave, the floor stood six feet higher than the rest, covered in copper but devoid of treasure. John pondered if the copper hinted at the origin of the structures.

The ship was the main topic of conversation, and all efforts were focused on its construction. The best oak trees were cut down, a new sawmill was set up, and the machine shop worked tirelessly to create new tools. Some incidents, like the missing flag and the boat's relocation, were explained, but mysteries remained. Who left the message in the lifeboat? Who took the flagstaff? The boys, eager for answers, embarked on a journey into the forest with provisions and equipment. They hunted game and found the perfect pole for the flag. Upon returning, they raised the flag with pride and cheers. The book they used to learn practical skills was easy to understand, with illustrations and a glossary.
