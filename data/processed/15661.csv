Once, a man had three sons, and the youngest was known as the Simpleton. He was often mocked and ignored. When the eldest son went to the forest to chop wood, he refused to share his food and drink with a little old man he met. As a result, he injured himself and had to return home. The second son also met the old man but refused to help. He too was hurt while cutting wood. Finally, the Simpleton went to the forest. Although given meager provisions by his mother, he shared them with the old man. In return, the man blessed him, and the Simpleton found a goose with golden feathers. The innkeeper's daughters tried to pluck the feathers and got stuck. The Simpleton's kindness had brought him luck and a valuable treasure.|"['1. What was the youngest son known as in the story?\nA.

The next morning, the Simpleton carried the goose and continued his journey, paying no attention to the three girls trailing behind. They followed him wherever he went, even when they encountered the parson in the fields. The parson scolded the girls for chasing after the Simpleton, but when he tried to stop them, he too got stuck following them. The sexton witnessed this and joined the strange procession. As they ran, they picked up two labourers who also got stuck in the line. Eventually, they reached a city where the King had a daughter who never laughed. The King promised her hand in marriage to anyone who could make her laugh. The Simpleton, with his unusual entourage, made the Princess laugh. The King, hesitant about the match, challenged the Simpleton to find a man who could drink a whole cellar of wine. The Simpleton sought help from the little grey man and succeeded in completing the task. The King then demanded a man who could eat a mountain of bread. The Simpleton found another man in the woods, who accomplished the feat. Impressed, the King gave his daughter's hand in marriage to the Simpleton, who later inherited the Kingdom and lived happily with his wife.|['1.
