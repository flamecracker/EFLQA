Grandpa Brown, walking by the farmhouse, smiled at Bunny and Sue. Bunny offered to help pick peaches, pausing his doghouse project. Grandpa Brown explained what an ostrich was, and the kids were excited. They were at the farm enjoying the summer. Grandpa Brown led them to the orchard to pick peaches. The cool shade and the sound of the bubbling brook made it pleasant. They could hear the bees buzzing near the beehives. After eating peaches, Grandpa Brown hinted at needing help. Bunny climbed a low peach tree using a box. Even though they wanted to help, playing was important too.|['1.

"""No, nor any other kind!"" exclaimed his grandfather. ""Just keep out of trees. Little boys and girls are safest on the ground. But now you had better come over where I can keep my eyes on you. I have my basket nearly filled. We'll very soon go back to the house.""

Bunny Brown was all right now. So he and Sue went over to the tree where grandpa was picking. They helped to fill the basket, for some of the peaches grew on branches so close to the ground that the children could reach up and pick them without any trouble.

"""No, I suppose not,"" said Bunny and Sue's mother. ""But you must go and wash now. Sue, I'll put a clean dress on you, and then I'll see if I can get the peach stains off this one. You ought to have on an old apron.""

""Well, of course not a _real_, big one, with lions and tigers and all that,"" said Bunny. ""We couldn't get elephants and camels and bears. But maybe grandpa would let us take his two horses, that he got back from the Gypsies. They have lots of horses in the circus.""

Bunker Blue, a big, red-haired boy who almost seemed like a man, worked for Mr. Brown and was very fond of Bunny and Sue. He had driven the big automobile that brought the Brown family to grandpa's farm and was staying in the country.

As they walked, Sue expressed her fear of lions and tigers, while Bunny grappled with the idea of putting half of Splash the dog in a cage for their make-believe circus. They played in the hay-filled horse-barn, pretending to have their circus there. On their way back to the house, they passed a pond where a hen was clucking and fussing."|"[""1.

In the story, Sue and Bunny observe something unusual by the pond. They see soft, fluffy balls of downy feathers paddling in the water. Sue is surprised and confused as she has never seen baby ducks before. She learns from Grandpa Brown that sometimes duck eggs are placed under a hen to hatch. The mother hen, mistaking the ducklings for her own chicks, gets worried when they swim but eventually accepts them. Sue and Bunny then excitedly plan a circus in the barn.

Bunny and Sue were thinking about the tramps who had taken the large coconut-custard cake, as mentioned in the previous book. They wondered if these tramps had been released from jail and returned for more cake. The children sat close to their parents as Grandpa investigated the knocking at the back door. They all followed Grandma Brown to the back stoop where they found a boy, slightly smaller than Bunker Blue, standing beside Grandpa. The boy, though wearing dusty and torn clothes, had a clean face and hands with bright, teary eyes. Grandma warmly invited him in and offered food. Bunny and Sue watched curiously as Grandma served the hungry boy. Grandpa, in a hushed voice, expressed disbelief that the boy was afraid to ask for help. Grandma's kindness shone through as she attended to the boy, while Bunny and Sue observed, impressed by her caring nature.|"['1.

Grandpa Brown listened to Ben's story, feeling concerned about the mistreatment he had faced. Despite Ben's reluctance to share where he came from, Grandpa assured him he would not let him go back to those who hurt him. Ben was allowed to stay the night and share a room with Bunker Blue. The next day, Grandpa planned to investigate further but found Ben to be a nice boy despite his mysterious past. Ben was given a temporary home on the farm, where he would help with chores and errands.

Ben was asked to help on the farm by Bunny's grandmother. They planned to set up a circus in the barn. Ben started turning over and over as he fell towards the hay pile. Bunker Blue laughed as Ben tumbled. Bunny watched in awe, thinking about falling from such a height. Bunker and Ben climbed up to secure the trapeze ropes. Bunny, feeling adventurous, wanted to jump from the trapeze into the soft hay. Sue, too, tried hanging on the trapeze. Bunker supported her to prevent slipping. They set up more trapezes for themselves, performing various tricks. Bunny and Sue had a thrilling time in the barn, trying out circus acts under the watchful eye of Bunker and Ben.|"['1.

A few days later, Bunny and Sue visited the barn to see the circus trapezes. Bunker Blue and Ben were busy weeding the garden for Grandpa Brown. Bunny tried the low trapeze and landed safely in the hay, thanks to Sue's quick thinking. Then he climbed the ladder to the high trapeze. Bunny fell into the hay pile Sue had prepared, avoiding any injuries. They decided to go to the shady side after the barn fun. They were looking forward to Grandma Brown's treats at ten o'clock. Plans for the circus were in progress, with more trapezes and seats to be set up. Sue suggested giving her doll a bath in the well, as she was a rubber doll and it wouldn't harm her.|['1.

Not far from the house was a well. Bunny and Sue used a string from Bunny's kite to lower Sue's rubber doll into the cool water at the bottom. The doll splashed down, and Bunny and Sue watched from the edge of the wooden box built around the well. Sue explained her dolls couldn't talk, except for one that said 'Mamma' and 'Papa.' Bunny was surprised when the doll fell in, but Sue remembered how their grandpa once fished out the well bucket with a rake tied to a long pole. Grandpa Brown saved the doll by carefully lifting it out with the rake, ensuring it was safe. He advised them not to play near the well and suggested using the brook for the doll's bath instead.|"[""1.

Sue and Bunny were enjoying bread and jam on the shady back porch when they decided to play with the calves in the barn. Bunny painted green stripes on one calf, turning it into a makeshift zebra. Sue even suggested adding blue stripes to make it look like a tiger. As Bunny painted, the calf's mother watched closely, gently rubbing her tongue on the calf's head. Bunny accidentally splashed some paint on himself and Sue, but they were too caught up in their fun to mind. However, when Bunny climbed into the calf's pen to paint the other side, the calf became scared. The mother cow watched protectively but didn't harm Bunny. The children's playful antics turned the barn into a circus as they transformed the calf into a colorful zebra.|"['1.

Bunny tried to paint stripes on the calf, but it wouldn't stay still. The calf kicked over Bunny when he painted its legs, causing a mess. The calf ran around the barnyard, covered in green paint. The mother cow followed, trying to keep up. Eventually, the calf stopped running when it saw its mother. Grandpa forgave Bunny and Sue for the mishap, but warned them not to paint animals without permission. They cleaned up the mess and returned the calf and cow to their stalls.|['1.

"""We've made a good start for our circus,"" Bunny told Sue a few days after painting the calf. The green stripes had dried, making the calf look funny. Some cows and calves were scared of the strange, striped one, but the mother cow still loved it. ""Camels are too hard,"" said Sue. ""Why not make an ostrich, Bunny?"" Bunny thought for a moment and then had an idea. ""I'll be a Wild West cowboy and lasso the rooster to make him an ostrich,"" he said excitedly. Bunny cut a bit of clothesline with an old knife. He tried to lasso the rooster, but it ran away, crowing loudly. The rooster was scared, running back and forth. Bunny's lasso missed, and the rooster kept running, with the other hens and roosters joining in the commotion."|['1.

Bunny and Sue chased the tired rooster around the garden under the bushes. Bunny's arm ached from throwing his lasso. Sue and Bunny tried to catch the rooster between them, but it flew over Bunny's head into the meadow. They fell in the soft grass, resting and smiling. Later, their friends came over to prepare for a circus in the barn. Bunny was to perform on the trapeze and in a Punch and Judy show. Sue's dog was painted with blue stripes for a funny act. The children sang a song about dollies and a mouse in school. They also gathered flowers for the honey bees.|"[""1.

"""Come see the wild animals!"" shouted Sue excitedly, mimicking the circus barkers. ""Right this way!"" she led, showcasing their dog Splash as the blue-striped tiger. Reassuringly, she added, ""He won't hurt you."" Pointing to a green-painted calf, she announced, ""And over here is the striped zebra!"" Laughter filled the air as the calf pranced around. Suddenly, chaos ensued as the ""wild animals"" broke loose. Amidst the commotion, Bunny Brown warned, ""Look out!"" Mr. Brown swiftly intervened, cautioning Bunny to stay clear of the playful calf. Meanwhile, Splash and the roosters added to the frenzy. The hired man, with a pail of milk, unwittingly enticed the calf, leading to a hilarious milk-snatching spectacle."|['1.

The circus had come to an end, and the crowd slowly began to disperse. The calf was calmly sipping milk from a pail, and Splash had ceased barking. The roosters had wandered out of the barn, bringing quiet back to the scene. Bunny and Sue's circus had been a hit, with everyone enjoying themselves. Some kids wished for a repeat, but Bunny explained it wasn't possible without grandpa's barn and the help of Bunker and Ben. The two boys tidied up the barn as Ben mentioned an old army tent in the attic. While discussing, a board slipped, lightly hitting Bunker. After restoring order, the siblings found an old bag, turning it into a makeshift sail for a boat adventure on the pond, enjoying the simple pleasure as the wind pushed them along.|"[""1.

The children were having a delightful time on the raft with the little ducks and their mother hen. Bunny had a mishap when the sail fell on Sue, causing a bit of chaos. The ducks, startled by the commotion, hurried back to shore, followed by their mother. Bunny assured Sue that he was okay after falling into the water. It was all an exciting adventure on the pond, with the little ducks enjoying their swim and the children learning to navigate the raft.

Bunny's father had taught him a bit about swimming. Bunny knew that if you fall into water, the first thing to do is hold your breath. When your head bobs up, take a breath and stand up if the water isn't too deep. The duck pond was shallow, so Bunny waded behind the raft with Sue on it. Sue's feet got wet, but it was okay since she had no shoes or stockings. They played tag, hide-and-seek, teeter-totter, and bean-bag at Nellie Bruce's home. Bunny and Sue were surprised that Splash, their dog, didn't greet them. They searched for Splash with the help of their family and friends. Mr. Black mentioned seeing Splash near a grove of trees. They found Splash caught in a trap, unable to move.|"[""1.

Bunny and Sue were helping set up a big tent with their friends when their dog, Splash, got caught in a trap. Fortunately, Splash wasn't seriously hurt, but he was limping for a few days. While the children thought they were assisting, the older boys could have done a better job. Despite this, everyone enjoyed being together. As they worked on the tent, Sue went missing. Bunny and the others found her asleep under a pile of canvas. Splash had woken her up by nuzzling her with his nose. Sue was confused by the attention she received upon waking up.

Feeling drowsy, Sue covered herself with a piece of the tent, pretending it was a white blanket from her Grandpa's house. Hidden from view, she napped while Bunny and the others searched. Splash, the dog, eventually found her, waking her up just in time for the circus preparations. Bunker Blue and Ben discussed plans for a show with Bunny and Sue. The group aimed to create a bigger circus with tricks on the trapeze and trained animals. The next day, Bunny and Sue ran an errand for their grandma, enjoying cookies and milk from a neighbor. On their way back, they encountered a man selling colorful balloons. Excited, they returned home with the man, envisioning a fun balloon and refreshment stand for their circus.|['1.

"Bunny suggested, ""We can ask the hired man to sell peanuts and lemonade for us. He can stay with us until the circus is ready. Maybe he can help the hired man sell lemonade and peanuts when he's not milking cows.""

Mrs. Brown sighed, feeling overwhelmed by the unfinished circus preparations. She scolded Bunny and Sue for inviting the balloon man. Mr. Brown apologized to the Italian balloon seller, offering food and buying balloons. The children happily played with the balloons, tying them to long threads. As the circus tents were being set up, Bunker Blue and Ben worried about an approaching storm. Sue feared the tents might get washed away. The storm grew intense, with thunder rattling the farmhouse. Bunny tried to comfort Sue, likening the thunder to circus wagons.

Bunny and Sue were caught in a storm that threatened their circus tents. The wind howled fiercely, making umbrellas useless. Luckily, with rubber hats, coats, and boots, they stayed dry. The thunder roared, and lightning lit up the sky. Rain pounded on the roof, but Bunny and Sue were safe. As the storm raged on, the children grew sleepy. Bunny awoke to news that their circus tents were washed away by the flood. Determined to salvage them, Bunker and the boys waded into the water to retrieve one tent. Despite being torn and muddy, they could repair it. Unfortunately, the big tent was entangled in the river. Bunker spotted it caught on a tree, a tangled mess of ropes and cloth.

The preparation for the circus had begun in earnest. The boys were moving peculiar boxes and crates into the smaller tent, concealing their contents with cloth or paper. Bunny Brown and his sister Sue exchanged worried glances. If the white mice had escaped, other animals might follow. The thought of the lion getting loose from one of the boxes was particularly concerning. Ben reassured them, mentioning that the lion was asleep and harmless. Sam, the owner of the white mice, explained how gentle they were due to their white color. Everyone joined in the search for the missing mice, with Sue suggesting using cheese as bait, reciting a rhyme about catching mice with cheese.|"['1.

Sam denied the possibility of the white mice being taken by trained monkeys due to the door being securely fastened from the outside.

Bunny's quick thinking saved the day at the circus. When the tent pole was about to fall, Bunny realized he could stop it by keeping the rope from sliding through the pulley.
