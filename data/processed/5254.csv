Twaddles, in his usual playful manner, brought a sick robin to Norah, claiming it needed warmth to recover. Norah, knowing the oven was too hot, suggested a safer spot. Despite his good intentions, Twaddles accidentally caused a commotion with a broom. Meanwhile, outside, Meg was happily gardening, while Dot, always a bit disheveled, joined them. When Twaddles suggested using the oven to warm the bird, Mother Blossom explained it wasn't safe or legal. Instead, they decided to return the robin to the grass once it was warm.

Father Blossom, Mother Blossom, and their three children embarked on a car ride. Father Blossom expressed concern about the constant chatter while driving, suggesting they settle the matter later.

Father Blossom carefully steered the heavy car towards home when suddenly the wheel seemed to take control, plunging the car into a screen of brushwood. Twaddles, the youngest, managed a grin despite the unexpected crash. The family, including Mother Blossom, cautiously stepped out onto the prickly ground surrounded by bushes. Father Blossom inspected the wedged car, realizing it was stuck between saplings.

Twaddles was eager to join his father but understood his mother and sisters needed his protection. He waited quietly in the bushes, though not as quietly as he could. The underbrush was thick, trapping Twaddles in vines. Mother Blossom and the others rescued him. They sat in the car listening to Mother's story until Father Blossom arrived with a farmer named Ellis. Ellis quickly freed the car from the bushes. The Blossoms made it home for supper, and Bobby, with his miniature car, went to school early. The twins longed to join school soon.

Breathless, the boys and girls watched as Bobby pushed his car to a safe distance from the fence. Meg, always eager to follow Bobby's lead, took the wheel and pedaled through the gap, a bit slower than Bobby. As the recess bell rang, Palmer and Bobby raced outside. Meanwhile, Meg stayed behind to tidy her desk. Miss Mason watered plants as the sun streamed through the open windows. Meg felt content and hummed a tune. Suddenly, she saw a commotion outside. Bobby's car had caused a stir. Meg hurried to the yard, where Mr. Carter, the principal, comforted Palmer, who had fallen. Mr. Carter explained the damage to school property and decided Bobby would repair the fence after school. Meg was reminded to return to class as Mr. Carter tended to Palmer's injuries.|"['1.

Meg and Bobby worked hard to fix the broken pickets while Mr. Carter repaired the old cross piece. They realized that it's easier to break things than to fix them. After a long night and a stern warning from Mother Blossom about taking the tin automobile to school, they decided the game wasn't worth it. Twaddles, the youngest, had a secret plan involving an island. Mother Blossom shared exciting news about a bungalow on Apple Tree Island, generously offered by Daddy's friend for their summer stay. The children were thrilled at the thought of living on the island. The idea of visiting Aunt Polly on the way added to their excitement. Despite school still being in session, Mother Blossom assured Meg and Bobby that they wouldn't miss out on the island adventure.|"['1.

Mother Blossom gently addressed Twaddles, advising him to retrieve the grasshopper he had put in Meg's pocket, leading to trouble. Twaddles had to decide between losing the grasshopper or asking Miss Mason for it back. In the end, Twaddles approached Miss Mason, who was surprised by his visit.

Mother Blossom revealed to the surprised Twaddles that she once found herself far from home with a crying baby in her arms and couldn't help but cry herself. Bobby, her baby, joined in the tears. A kind woman named Mrs. Harley, with her two young boys and a baby carriage full of packages, came to their aid. Mrs. Harley comforted Mother Blossom, made her boys walk, and took care of Bobby. She even provided tea, bread, and butter before Mr. Harley arrived to drive them home. Years later, Mr. Harley disappeared, and the Harleys vanished too, leaving behind a mystery.

Father Blossom agreed with the story of the Harley family, mentioning how Mrs. Harley left the island two summers ago, leaving their shack to slowly fall apart. The next day, Miss Florence arrived to fit Dot for a new dress, causing her to forget about envying Meg and Bobby who rushed to school. Father Blossom then asked Dot and Twaddles to help pack his old desk drawer. As they cleaned, Twaddles accidentally spilled the contents down the stairs, causing a mess. Despite the chaos, everyone worked together to tidy up. Annabel Lee, the cat, was startled by the commotion and got hurt, but Twaddles' efforts were appreciated by Father Blossom, who understood his intention.|"['1.

When Meg and Bobby returned home from school, they were excited to help their mother run errands in town. The four little Blossoms always managed to fill the house with noise and laughter. At the grocery store, Meg and Bobby waited patiently while the mischievous twins explored the bins.

The time had finally arrived for the Blossoms to embark on their journey to Apple Tree Island. This morning, they set out with Norah's sister staying to help with Annabel Lee. Meg and Bobby were pleased to learn they would move up a grade in the fall due to their excellent term records. Dot's new dresses were ready, and Twaddles insisted on bringing an empty birdcage despite not having a bird. The family planned to stop at Brookside Farm on the way, with Aunt Polly being the main reason for the visit. As they traveled along the State highway, Dot inquired about the boat, but Mother Blossom explained they would not be taking one. They stopped for a picnic, enjoying the Spring weather and a delicious meal prepared by Norah.

"Father Blossom made a firm decision. ""You are joining us on our outings and picnics this vacation,"" he said. ""With all the help you have, you can surely come along. Remember how much you enjoyed rowing."" The day was crisp and pleasant, with a constant breeze over Apple Tree Island. The Blossoms used blankets every night, as Twaddles wrote to Norah. The island got its name from the four sturdy apple trees at each point. They explored the island, noting its unique apple trees and rocky areas. They also spotted two islands rumored to be used by smugglers. The children discussed the mystery of the Harley family's disappearance. Mother Blossom was amused when Bobby mistook the Harley boys for someone else. They settled into the Winthrops' furnished bungalow and found Apple Tree Island charming.

This morning, the captain announced a special trip to the island north of Harley's shack to check for any violations of game laws. He mentioned he plays various roles around the area - sheriff, warden, and lake captain. The four Blossom children boarded the boat, with Bobby explaining they couldn't join the trip as they needed to care for the younger twins. The captain, amused by the mix-up, retrieved a basket of clothes from the island. They were investigating reports of fires on the beach at night, suspecting illegal bird hunting. As they arrived at the island covered in grass and daisies, the children gathered flowers while the captain inspected the shed. It turned out to be a false alarm, with bird wings found as evidence. The boat, named The Sarah, headed back, with Bobby and Meg learning to steer, Twaddles playing with a compass, and Dot planning something.|"[""1.

Dot, in her worry to water the daisies, climbed the rail and tumbled into the water when startled by Meg's sudden shout. Luckily, the boat was in shallow water, and Mr. Harley swiftly rescued her.

Meg and Bobby created a game where they pretended to be brave sailors searching for buried treasure left by fierce pirates long ago. The Harley shack was imagined as the pirates' castle home. The children used a shovel to tap the ground and dig where it sounded hollow. Despite their efforts, they had not found anything yet. One day, while playing, Bobby discovered an odd-shaped object. They rushed to the ruins of the Harley house with their find. Bobby, hungry from the adventure, and the twins enjoyed a lunch Mother Blossom had packed. As a storm approached, Mr. Harley improvised a shelter using a door and barrels to keep them dry. The children were so engrossed in their game that they hadn't noticed the storm coming.|"['1.
