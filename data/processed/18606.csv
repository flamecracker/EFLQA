Sahwah peered through her spyglass, waiting for the _Bluebird_ to appear. Impatient for Gladys, she pondered what her new friend might be like. Migwan explained that affinities are not chosen but discovered, a connection that is felt instantly. Sahwah, skeptical, worried about being uninteresting to Gladys. As they waited, Sahwah scanned the surroundings, from Migwan washing clothes to the toothbrushes scattered on the rocks. Meanwhile, Hinpoha, high on the cliff, finished building a tree-house and eagerly awaited the _Bluebird_. She playfully tossed a pine cone at Sahwah, causing her to drop her spyglass in the water. Laughter ensued, and Sahwah prepared to dive in to retrieve it. Suddenly, two canoes carrying more Winnebagos appeared, racing towards the camp, their paddles moving in rhythm as they sang a greeting to Sahwah.|"['1.

Sahwah signaled her understanding with a wave, then stood still, fixated on the shadow of the springboard on the water, waiting to see which canoe would cross it first. Soon, Nyoda and Medmangi's green canoe appeared, the paddlers shouting triumphantly. Following closely behind was the second pair. Seizing the moment when the second canoe was directly below her, Sahwah leaped from the springboard, landing in the bow, causing the girls to capsize into the lake. Laughter erupted as the other girls in the first canoe witnessed the commotion. Amid the chaos, Sahwah managed to escape underwater, leaving her friends laughing and seeking revenge. Hinpoha cheered from a tree as the girls engaged in playful water antics. Meanwhile, the racers struggled to right their canoes, preparing for the arrival of the _Bluebird_.

"""I am Sahwah the Sunfish,"" said a slim girl with lively eyes. ""I picked 'Sun' for sunshine and 'Fish' for swimming. I strive to be virtuous and proper."" The girls giggled. ""I'm Migwan,"" said the next girl. ""It means 'Quill Pen,' showing my love for writing."" She had a thoughtful look and dreamy eyes. Each girl introduced herself, Chapa the Chipmunk, Medmangi the Medicine Man Girl, and Nakwisi the Star Maiden. ""And here's Nyoda, the best Guardian ever!"" they cheered. ""Hello, Miss Kent,"" said Gladys, staring at her wet clothes and the group. She was fair, tall, slender, and delicate. Sahwah thought she seemed stuck up. Nyoda suggested they change their names at camp. The girls felt awkward in their wet clothes. Sahwah dove into the water to retrieve a spy-glass, amazing Gladys. Nyoda laughed at their banter and urged them to change into dry clothes. The first dressed could go to the village with her. The girls hurried up the path, Nyoda helping Gladys. Gladys learned about the camp's mishap and Sahwah's pranks. She shuddered at the thought. Nyoda realized she had a challenge with Gladys, who was not a regular camper.

Miss Kent was thrilled to take on the responsibility. Besides her eagerness to assist Gladys, the offer of a campsite for the summer was too good to resist. Throughout winter, the girls had been searching for a spot to camp during the upcoming summer, even organizing a play to raise funds. Going as far as Maine hadn't crossed their minds until now, with the camp being offered for free, allowing them to use the money for train tickets. The Winnebagos erupted in cheers when Miss Kent shared the news. They sang praises for Gladys, her father, the lake, and the camp, looking forward to the fun they would have. Gladys, away at school, would join them later. Miss Kent and the girls arrived in June to open the camp. Gladys, unfamiliar with the place, seemed reluctant and out of place.

Nyoda focused on canoe rules, stressing the importance of passing a swimming test before canoeing and having Sahwah, Hinpoha, or herself present. Disobeying meant no canoe access. She emphasized obeying the boat leader, discussing a captain's authority and the need for composure, courage, and temper control. Nyoda trusted Sahwah and Hinpoha to lead canoes. Gladys, unable to swim, was surprised by the rules. The camp day included bugle wake-up, morning routine, activities like crafting and dancing, swimming, cooking lessons, and free time. Evenings allowed stunts. Nyoda recognized achievements, inspiring Gladys, who marveled at the girls' skills.|['1.

Gladys was in the Omega tent with Sahwah, Hinpoha, and Migwan. The girls changed into nightgowns after taking off their Ceremonial costumes. Gladys, feeling nervous, fussed around. Hinpoha suggested different places to put their clothes, causing a playful pillow fight. The pillow accidentally landed in the water basin, drenching Gladys. The girls burst into laughter, except Gladys, who felt small and lonely. She preferred luxury over camp life. Migwan reassured her about sleeping under the stars. Reluctantly, Gladys got into bed, feeling out of place in the wilderness. She missed her usual summer spots and was unimpressed by camp activities. Despite her initial discomfort, she eventually settled in for her first night outdoors.|['1.

Gladys couldn't sleep. She tossed and turned, hearing eerie night sounds in the woods. The water below sounded lonely, the wind in the pine trees felt ghostly, and a mournful cry made her shiver. She didn't recognize the soothing water's lullaby or the whippoorwill's call. Frogs in the distance added to the eerie atmosphere. Suddenly, a strange laugh startled her. Despite the unsettling noises, Gladys tried to sleep but struggled on the sagging bed. Just as she was dozing off, the bed collapsed, waking everyone in the camp. Laughter erupted, but Gladys mistakenly blamed Sahwah, bursting into tears.|"[""1.

Nyoda quickly reassured Gladys, explaining that the collapsible bed was just a common camp trick. Despite this, Gladys continued to cry, feeling out of place and homesick. Nyoda comforted her by pointing out the constellations in the night sky, sharing their stories. Gradually, Gladys relaxed and fell asleep. When she woke in the morning to sunlight, she found Hinpoha asleep, Migwan feeding a chipmunk, and Sahwah getting ready for a swim. The girls greeted Gladys warmly, but silence was required until the bugle sounded. Another chipmunk joined them, causing a playful commotion. Eventually, the girls rushed to the lake for a morning swim, leaving Gladys to enjoy the peaceful company of the chipmunks in the tent.|['1.

Gladys rose from combing her hair as the breakfast bugle sounded at the camp. Nyoda and the other girls welcomed her warmly. They sang songs and enjoyed a meal together, working in harmony.

At camp, tent inspection is crucial as it affects our swimming time and Camp Craft honor. The tents compete for the highest average, aiming for a banner from Nyoda. When Nyoda arrived for inspection, the girls hurried out, leaving Gladys puzzled. Migwan explained that Nyoda updates them during Craft hour and reveals weekly averages at Council Fire. The girls focused on painting their paddles with symbols, but Gladys, new to symbolism, struggled to choose. Nyoda advised her to pick a name first, reflecting her passion or aspiration, before selecting a symbol. Nakwisi apologized for leaving a spy-glass, which Nyoda suggested hoisting on the diving tower. Plans for water sports were discussed next.|"['1.

The scene was set with Chapa, Medmangi, and Nakwisi dressed as pirates, belting out a pirate song on the dock. The captain, in full pirate attire, ordered his crew around, including planting the skull and crossbones flag. Suddenly, the pirates spotted two sailors approaching in a boat. The ruthless pirates lassoed the sailors, blindfolded and tied them up, and made them walk the plank off a high springboard. The audience was thrilled by the daring act. Sahwah and Medmangi swam alongside a canoe carrying Hinpoha as Columbia, with her hair shining in the sun. The canoe was decked in red, white, and blue, drawing admiration from the spectators.

"As the boat approached the dock, onlookers were captivated by the swimmers who resembled sea horses, blowing water from their mouths and noses. The spectators united in singing ""America"" as the boat sailed away. After changing costumes, the three girls received applause. Professor Bentley praised their original pageant idea and watched as they cooked dinner on the beach using primitive methods. Hinpoha's creation, ""Slumgullion,"" earned her praise. During a fire-building contest, the girls faced challenges lighting twigs with limited matches and no paper. Sahwah's strategic placement shielded her twigs from the wind, while Hinpoha positioned herself to block the breeze. Despite the difficulties, the girls enjoyed the challenge and camaraderie of the competition."|"['1.

The Winnebagos had a tradition of sharing folk stories after supper. However, Nyoda suggested they share the story before supper due to the early departure of their visitors. Migwan narrated the tale of Aliquipiso, a brave Oneida maiden. The story revolved around the Oneidas fleeing from the Mingoes, facing starvation or death. Aliquipiso proposed a plan to lure the Mingoes to their demise by dropping boulders on them, ultimately saving her people. The guests were impressed by the Winnebago girls' unity and strength. Nyoda declined an offer to interrupt their camp activities, emphasizing the importance of their shared experiences.

Nyoda came home deep in thought. Hinpoha's blossoming beauty had been giving her much to ponder lately. Despite Hinpoha's carefree and fun-loving nature, she was often troubled by her unruly red hair. Hinpoha's desire was to have a good time and involve others in her adventures. Nyoda noticed how Hinpoha effortlessly attracted attention wherever they went. Nyoda pondered the challenges Hinpoha might face due to her striking looks. Back at camp, Nyoda found Hinpoha and Sahwah setting a makeshift boat with turpentine-dipped sails on the lake. The boat created a spectacular sight as it sailed away. The day had been eventful, and soon the girls succumbed to sleep. Sahwah drifted into a dream where she was an Indian maiden in love with a brave from a rival tribe, facing danger and a daring escape. Sahwah woke abruptly to Nyoda's voice pulling her from a near fall into the lake.|"[""1.

Nyoda, the camp leader, shared an exciting plan with the girls after a Fourth-of-July celebration. She asked them to pack their blankets and ponchos and not make their beds. The girls were thrilled with anticipation, guessing they might be going on a canoe trip. However, Nyoda revealed they were going on a hunting adventure in pairs. Each pair would follow a trail marked by leaders. The first pair would set off at ten o'clock, and the others would follow at intervals. They would buy supplies for supper and breakfast at a nearby village, and each pair would carry their lunches. The girls were eager and ready for the new adventure Nyoda had planned for them.|"['1.

Nyoda assigned the roles for the hiking trip. Sahwah and Nakwisi were to be the pathfinders, leading the way. Each girl was to carry specific items like a hatchet, flashlight, notebook, and camera. They were also tasked with documenting birds, animals, trees, and flowers they encountered. The pair with the most observations would earn a special honor. The girls hurried to prepare, rolling up their belongings in ponchos. Gladys needed help from Chapa, but eventually got the hang of it. Nyoda praised their efforts and reminded them to close their tents in case of rain. The pathfinders set off first, followed by the other pairs. The air was filled with the scent of flowers and pine as they ventured through the woods, leaving behind the troubles of the world to immerse themselves in the wonders of nature.|"[""1.

"""We have thirty minutes for our midday break,"" Sahwah said, ""and I'd like to rest in this chair."" She took off her shoes, stretched her feet, and closed her eyes. Nakwisi did the same. As they got up, the farmer's wife offered them cookies for the road. Watching them leave, she wished she could join them and escape the monotony of home. Chapa and Gladys faced a brook on their path. Chapa confidently waded through, while Gladys hesitated but eventually slipped. Chapa helped her out and suggested wearing her bathing suit to dry her clothes.

There was a loud noise, and suddenly, the girls were showered with ashes and potato pieces. They quickly put out the small fires that started and looked around to see what had happened. Nyoda noticed that Hinpoha had beans all over her shirt. It turned out that Migwan had tried to heat up the beans in a closed tin can, causing it to explode. The girls laughed and teased Migwan about the mishap. They rebuilt the fire, cooked bacon, made toast, and cocoa. As they sang and enjoyed the evening, Nyoda reminded them of their long hike that day and the even longer one ahead. After a dip in the lake, they settled in for the night.

Migwan found herself lost in the woods but kept a positive attitude. She stayed near a dry pine tree, built a fire, and rested. Upon waking to the squalling of jays, she realized she needed to mark her location for searchers. As she pondered this, two men and a little boy unexpectedly appeared.

Two hours later, they arrived at camp, and Hinpoha searched for Migwan, but she was nowhere to be found. Hinpoha wondered if Migwan was playing a surprise game by hiding nearby. Sahwah blew the bugle, a signal for immediate return, but no response came. Worried, they decided to go back on the trail. They met Nyoda and Medmangi, who were just arriving. Nyoda organized a search for Migwan, but insisted they eat and rest first after walking fifteen miles. Hinpoha, determined to find Migwan, feared the worst. Nyoda remained confident but concerned. The group, including the camp watcher, searched the woods with lanterns but found no trace of Migwan. The night passed with growing anxiety.

Nyoda and her friends were on a hike, searching for marked trees. They found a road that seemed promising, but it led to Cambridge, 7 miles away in the opposite direction. Bewildered, they turned back. Hinpoha then led them into the woods on a narrow path. Nyoda, exhausted from giving swimming lessons, was helping Gladys overcome her fear of water. Despite Nyoda's patient efforts, Gladys remained terrified and made no progress. Nyoda realized that in order for Gladys to fully enjoy camp, she needed to participate like the other girls. Even though everyone tried to include her, Gladys struggled to embrace camp life. Nyoda decided not to let Gladys pay for provisions to make her feel more at ease.|"['1.

Nyoda was lost in thought when a car horn broke her concentration, and Mr. Bailey, a private detective, approached her. He was searching for a missing child and asked if they had seen a boy in a white sailor suit. Migwan remembered seeing the boy with two men in the woods. Nyoda quickly took a picture of the men and the boy on film. The suspense was palpable as the image developed in the darkroom.

Nyoda explained to Gladys the importance of placing her symbol prominently on her dress. She suggested adding butterfly symbols in red, yellow, and blue, representing Work, Health, and Love, along with the Winnebago tribe symbol in wood brown and green. The fringe at the bottom of the dress should be uneven to symbolize mountains, outlined with blue beads for the sky. Nyoda encouraged Gladys to earn honor beads through various camp activities, such as crafting, cooking, and hiking. Meanwhile, Sahwah and Hinpoha, while picking berries, decided to make a leaf cup for Migwan, who was recovering from a knee injury.

Hinpoha poked her hand into a log, accidentally disturbing a beehive. She danced around in pain as the bees swarmed out, causing her hand to swell. Despite the pain, she found solace in making clay figurines of her friends. Sahwah admired her creations and pretended to buy them with pebbles, amusing everyone. When it came to the figurine of Gladys, Sahwah refused to purchase it, leading to laughter among the group.

Nyoda handled the situation with grace as Sahwah's actions caused a misunderstanding. Upset by Nyoda's expression, Sahwah fled to the woods.

Nyoda couldn't find Sahwah when she got back to camp. Even at supper, Sahwah was missing. Hinpoha felt down without her friend, but Nyoda didn't let her go search. As it got dark, Nyoda took her lantern and found Sahwah by a tree, upset. Nyoda comforted her, saying it's not as bad as she thinks. Nyoda explained that sometimes we do things without thinking, but we should pause before acting. She reminded Sahwah of an incident when she jumped off a tower into a canoe, setting a risky example. Nyoda advised Sahwah to be extra kind to Gladys, offering to teach her to swim. She emphasized the importance of understanding others and being a good friend.|"['1.

Hinpoha braved the storm to retrieve a loose canoe. As the tower trembled and lightning struck, she clutched the flag tightly, racing back to the shack where Nyoda kindled a fire. Despite the downpour, they gathered for crafts and stories. The night was restless with the rain's relentless drumming. Sahwah comforted a trembling Gladys, ensuring the tent's stability. The girls, anxious but safe, barely slept. At dawn, Nyoda urgently summoned Sahwah to rescue the drifting canoe. Ready in her bathing suit, Sahwah joined Nyoda in the launch to retrieve the canoe, a daring start to the day.|['1.

Nyoda and her friends crept out of the tent towards the lake. The water had risen, flooding the dock. They spotted their runaway canoe in the lake, but it was drifting away. Nyoda decided they needed to chase it down. The girls embarked on an exciting journey in a small boat, battling the waves and rain. Nyoda's calm demeanor kept them steady. Eventually, they caught up with the canoe, righted it, and secured it to their boat. Safely back at the dock, they secured the canoe. The rainy day continued, with leaks in their tent and a cozy gathering in the shack. Nyoda led them in a fun game to pass the time.

"After dinner, Nyoda suggested a game of ""Aeroplane."" She sent all the girls except Hinpoha to the kitchen. Each girl was blindfolded and brought into the room one by one. Sahwah went first. She was led to the middle of the room and told to step up onto what felt like a platform. Someone then commanded her to hang on to something that felt like hair. As she held on, she was lifted up, making her feel like she was soaring towards the ceiling. Then, they told her to jump, and as she did, she landed on solid ground. When the blindfold was removed, Sahwah realized she had only been standing on a wooden board and had not actually risen high at all.

When it was time for bed, they couldn't go to the tents, so they made beds on the floor in a circle around the fireplace. Sahwah asked if this counted towards their honor for sleeping five nights on the ground. Hinpoha thought it should count, as it was harder than the ground. Nyoda agreed. However, they couldn't open the porch door due to the warped flooring. Sahwah was willing to sing despite the situation, unlike Gladys, who refused to sing with the group. Gladys believed her voice was different and should not blend with others. Nyoda was disappointed by Gladys's refusal to sing and saw tension building among the girls. To diffuse the situation, Nyoda suggested folk dancing, even in the rain.|"[""1.

"All the girls cried out, ""I, I!"" and followed Nyoda to the tennis court. They danced without music and played ""Three Deep,"" splashing water on their faces. Nyoda suggested playing ""Stump the Leader"" and led them on a wild chase around the camp. They swam, climbed, and jumped off the tower. After swimming, they were peaceful. The next day, the sun shone, and they set up the Omega tent. Sahwah insisted on doing it with Hinpoha for an honor. The sun dried the ground, and Migwan was glad to be dry.

They told a tale of a little boy who went missing from their camp one Thursday night. Frantically searching along the shore, fearing he had fallen into the lake, they found his toy sailboat in the woods. Concluding he had wandered off or been taken, they found no trace of an abductor. Thanks to Migwan's picture with the boy and her tip that they were headed for Loon Lake, the men were tracked down. Little Raymond was discovered disguised in girl's clothing. Migwan recounted her fall and night in the woods, seeing the three in the morning. Mr. Bartlett praised Migwan's help and handed her a check, which she initially refused. Eventually accepting it, she was thanked for easing their worry. The Bartletts invited Migwan and her friends for a visit.

Sitting quietly in the woods, I suddenly noticed a pair of bright eyes watching me mischievously. Their playful gaze lifted my spirits, and as I observed, the eyes peeked out from behind a leaf, revealing a tiny red berry with holes resembling eyes. I imagined woodland sprites and stayed still, not wanting to scare the berry away. After a nod of cheerfulness, I sketched a nose and mouth on the berry. Hinpoha, eager to illustrate, captured the scene with her paintbrush. Moving on, I tripped over a pine tree and fell into a bed of moss, much to Hinpoha's delight as she painted the comical scene. As I continued my walk, surrounded by twinkling moss stars, I shared my experience of gathering blueberries near Sandy Beach.

A small red squirrel scurried down a tree, gave a cheeky flick of its tail, and vanished, seemingly scolding for wasting summer days instead of preparing for winter. Nearby, a blueberry bush laden with plump berries caught attention, a novelty for the observer. An acorn lying untouched on the ground prompted thoughts of missed opportunities to grow into a mighty oak. Meanwhile, Nyoda and Sahwah worked on fixing a canoe damaged during a nighttime voyage. Nyoda suggested creating an illustrated book of camp experiences for professors Bentley and Wheeler, sparking enthusiasm among the girls.

Sahwah hurried to her tent, changed into her bathing suit, and sat on the dock, eagerly waiting for Nyoda's signal to start swimming. During the lesson, she made a mistake that upset Nyoda. While Hinpoha was taking a test to tow someone to shore with Nakwisi, Sahwah dove off the high tower, unintentionally disrupting the test. Nyoda, frustrated, reprimanded Sahwah.

Gladys was filled with anger and blamed Sahwah for her troubles at camp. She sought revenge by damaging Sahwah's tennis racket. Feeling homesick and miserable, she wrote a letter to her father, complaining about the rude girls, the harsh swimming lessons, and the lack of food. She gave the letter to a passing steamer captain and sat on the dock feeling lonely. Despite not being allowed to use a canoe due to not passing the swimming test, she decided to take one out for a ride. As she paddled farther from the shore, she realized the canoe was leaking and filling with water.

Gladys firmly refused to comply with Ed Roberts' request to continue paddling, demanding to be taken home. Reluctantly, Ed complied, and they swiftly caught up with the others at the dock unnoticed. After a friendly farewell, the boys departed, leaving Gladys engrossed in her Handbook, aiming to achieve new accomplishments. She marveled at recognizing various birds, trees, and flowers, and was amazed to learn about different fern and grass species. Inspired by her progress, she eagerly marked honors she aimed to achieve. Sahwah proposed a group outing to Blueberry Island, including boys and girls, which excited everyone.

Migwan expressed her annoyance at the idea of entertaining guests, feeling it would disrupt their daily activities. She was particularly frustrated as it took away time from working on a book for Professor Bentley. Gladys, in a definitive tone, mentioned the shortage of skirts, needing to adjust hers due to tightness. She also couldn't find her yellow scarf from the previous night. Sahwah discovered her missing skirt, suspecting Hinpoha, who denied involvement. The girls were interrupted by a messenger from Mountain Lake Camp, bringing an invitation for Gladys to go canoeing.

Sherry, the head counselor, left Mountain Lake Camp as dusk fell, paddling his canoe away from Camp Winnebago. He turned back towards Winnebago in the middle of the lake, the rain pouring down. Pulling his canoe onto the dock, he searched for the girls but found the camp deserted. Following the sound of singing, he discovered the Winnebagos having a ceremony in the rain, performing a play. Despite the downpour, they were enjoying themselves. Sherry observed from afar, impressed by their spirit. When he finally approached Nyoda to deliver a message about a trip to Blueberry Island, he was met with excitement from the girls, leaving him no chance to chat further.

The girls eagerly prepared for the upcoming picnic, filled with excitement, but Gladys harbored a hidden fear. She dreaded Ed Roberts' unwanted advances at the event. Despite her worries, she kept silent, fearing Nyoda might take drastic action that could prevent the boys from joining. As they readied themselves, Migwan discovered her missing red middy tie, followed by Hinpoha's vanished bathing cap. The girls were puzzled and worried; someone was either playing a prank or stealing from them. The Winnebagos were like family, making theft unthinkable. Nyoda pondered the recent disappearances and the presence of outsiders like Sherry and Ed Roberts. The camp atmosphere grew tense, leading to discomfort and suspicion. The evening's singing felt off-key, and even the campfire seemed wrong.

Gladys pondered all morning on how to handle Ed Roberts. She was quiet and lost in thought, prompting Nyoda to tease her about her lack of energy. Nyoda asked if she was too eager to see Ed that she forgot how to talk. Gladys explained that Ed wanted her all to himself, calling her names like 'kid' and 'girlie,' even trying to hold her hand. Frustrated, Gladys wished she didn't have to be there that day. With sixteen people and only seven canoes, some had to share. Gladys ended up in the same canoe as Nyoda and Ed, who sulked as Gladys kept her distance. Despite Sherry's attempts to pair Gladys with someone else, she stayed close to Nyoda, helping her with blueberry pudding. Meanwhile, Sahwah and Ned had fun shooting rifles, with Hinpoha struggling but determined to improve.|"['1.

Dinner was served on the rocks over an open fire. Gladys warned everyone to save room for blueberry pudding. Ned joked he could eat everything and still have space for pudding. The meal was enjoyed with delight. Sherry took over the cooking duties, and the boys swiftly cleared the dishes. They later split into two teams for a shooting contest. Some girls surprised themselves by hitting the target on their first try. Ed's behavior caused some trouble, and he sulked on the beach. The group paddled back at sunset, singing happily. Sahwah, unable to sleep, went for a moonlit paddle on the lake, feeling drawn by its magic. She found a small cave to explore, guided by moonbeams, in a wide-awake dream-like state.|"[""1.

Nyoda decided to take a quick nap under the rising sun, only to be surprised by a peculiar sight. One of the ponchos, rolled up, levitated in the air before gently descending. Laughter erupted from the beds around her. Upon investigation, Nyoda discovered Hinpoha hidden inside the poncho, a prank by the other girls. Soon, the group was wide awake and engaging in playful antics, throwing shoes at each other. Nyoda, needing to restore order, blew the bugle to signal the start of the day.

Ed Roberts envied Gladys as she danced with other boys, paying no heed to him except for a polite dance.

The next day, the Mountain Lake boys left camp while the girls gathered on the dock to watch the steamer pass by. A commotion ensued on the boat as the boys playfully tossed one of their own overboard, following a camp tradition.
