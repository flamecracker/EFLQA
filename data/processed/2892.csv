Once upon a time, there was a man named Conaran who had four daughters. He loved and was proud of them, but they were known throughout Ireland for their unpleasant appearances and bad tempers.

They had long, skinny arms with spiked nails at the end of each finger. Their bodies were covered in a mix of hair, fur, and fluff, making them look like a strange combination of animals. These daughters had moustaches and woolly wads growing out of their ears, making them quite frightening to look at.

In ancient Ireland, there were three significant burial sites. One was in Ulster, led by Angus Og, another in Connacht under Ethal Anbual, and the last in Royal Meath, where Conn laid his wife to rest. Her funeral lasted nine days with games, songs, and a vast cairn built in her honor. Conn's sorrow affected all of Ireland, as his grief impacted his ability to rule wisely.

Once upon a time, there was a queen who was furious. She felt it was unfair that a servant's child was born at the same time as her own. Despite her anger, the child was there to stay. Nearby, a prince named Fiachna Duv ruled the Dal Fiatach. He had a long-standing feud with Fiachna Finn. Both princes had daughters born on the same night. To end the conflict, the babies were betrothed in their cradles. However, when Mongan, the prince's son, disappeared, trouble arose. Mongan was taken to be raised in a faraway land.
