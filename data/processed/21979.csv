Captain Ripon found a feather on the ground, identifying it as belonging to a rare Spangled Dorking bird. He suspected the gypsies of stealing valuable fowls. The magistrate ordered the main suspect to be taken to the lockup for trial, while the other gypsies were set free.

In the Yarmouth fleet, there are around four to five hundred boats. Thanks to strict discipline and order, accidents are avoided despite fishing in close quarters at night. The fleet is led by a highly experienced skipper known as the admiral, whose authority is absolute. Fishing is done at night, with the trawls lowered at dusk and hauled in at daybreak. The crew works together to clean and pack the catch under torchlight. The watch keeps an eye out for drifting boats, signaling with flares if needed. The trawl beam, equipped with iron hoops, keeps the net open to catch fish. The crew shares profits based on the catch, with soles being the most prized. Other fish caught include brill, haddock, and turbot. Oysters are a challenge, as their weight can lead to lost nets.|['1.

The crew's food mainly consists of fish while out at sea. Each crew member can choose their preferred fish from the deck. Initially, William Gale was surprised by the amount of fish consumed compared to his previous meager meals. They also had hard biscuits and tea without milk. Occasionally, they had salt meat and a pudding made of flour and currants. During bad weather, keeping watch at night became challenging due to strong winds and spray. It was crucial to watch for signals to avoid collisions with other vessels. Dogs on board also helped alert the crew. When a storm hit, the crew secured the ship by adjusting the sails and waiting for the storm to pass. Despite the challenges, the crew found ways to stay cheerful and pass the time with activities like reading and singing.|['1.

Every few days, the steamer arrived to collect the day's catch. A race ensued among the fleet to load the fish onto the steamer before it left. If the steamer couldn't take all the fish, the excess would spoil. The fleet hurried to the steamer, lowering the catch into the boats. The scene was lively in calm weather but perilous when the sea was rough. Lives were lost during this process, more than in ships lost to storms. Dutch trading smacks joined the fleet to trade fresh supplies for fish, causing losses for owners and harm to the crew. Will was relieved to sail under a strict skipper, unlike the harsh skippers from other towns. One night, a ship collided with their smack, sinking it. Will managed to climb aboard the ship, where he learned they were headed to Java with troops.|['1.

Will and the sailors rushed to the top of the ship to remove all the sails except a small one. Despite the calm sea, a strange darkness covered the sky as if a thick fog was forming high above. Suddenly, a deafening thunderclap and blinding lightning struck the mainmast, causing chaos. The crew, stunned and blinded, struggled to recover. The captain's voice cut through the chaos, giving orders to save the ship. Will, regaining his senses, helped cut away the fallen mast. The ship, hit by a fierce wind, almost capsized. With quick thinking and teamwork, they managed to steer the ship back on course before disaster struck. The crew tended to the injured, and the ship sailed on, battered but resilient.|"[""1.

During the storm, the ship faced serious danger. A stroke of lightning saved them from capsizing. The wind was strong, and the sea chaotic. The ship was in the center of a cyclone, making it difficult to steer. The crew struggled to keep their balance. The ship lost its mast and the crew had to act fast to prevent further damage. After days of running before the storm, they spotted dangerous breakers ahead. The crew worked together to try and steer away from the impending danger. Despite the challenges, they managed to keep the ship afloat and hoped to avoid the treacherous islands in the area.|"['1.

The crew's hope faded quickly as they realized the ship was drifting towards the shore, destined for wrecking. The crew spotted a line of breakers stretching along both sides of the ship. Despite efforts to anchor, the chances were slim due to the deep water and fierce gale. When the ship was just a quarter mile from the breakers, they found a depth of ten fathoms, slightly better than expected. Anchors were dropped, but a massive wave snapped the cables, leading to despair. The captain then directed the ship towards a point with no visible rocks, hoping to avoid further disaster. As they approached the line of breakers, the ship struck with a tremendous crash, breaking into pieces amid rough waters. Eventually, the crew found themselves beyond the reef, clinging to debris for safety.|"[""1.

In just fifteen minutes, the spar drifted to the shore, and the boys waded to safety. Soon after, the fore mast also washed up, carrying several men clinging to debris. In total, eleven men, including the first mate, were rescued. They salvaged a sail, set up a shelter in the woods, and rested for the night. The next morning, they returned to the beach strewn with wreckage and bodies. They solemnly buried their deceased comrades. As the storm subsided, they secured supplies and built a boat under the mate's guidance, using tools from a washed-up chest. In three days, they crafted a sturdy 25-foot boat, ready to sail to safety before encountering potential dangers from nearby hostile pirates.|"['1.

On the fourth day, as they headed to work and emerged from the woods onto the open beach, the mate spotted a large Malay prahu between the reef and the island. The group quickly retreated among the trees. The Malays seemed to be searching for wreckage from a recent storm that could be useful to them. Excited shouts erupted as they discovered the Dutch ship remains on the shore. The prahu rowed to the beach, and fifty to sixty Malays disembarked. One of them noticed the boat's framework and alerted the others. The Malays rushed towards the woods, prompting the group to flee. Will and Hans ran through the jungle, enduring scratches and falls.

The forest was filled with noise for hours as the Malays scoured the area, ensuring no one escaped. The boys hid in the bushes, escaping detection. At night, a fire by the shore indicated the Malays regrouping to examine their treasures. Will suggested waiting until the next night to avoid being discovered. They found a safe place to sleep in the climbers between branches. The next day, they cautiously moved towards the shore and discovered the Malays had left, looting everything. The boys salvaged biscuits and built a shelter. While hoping for their friends' return, they realized they were on their own. With no means to light a fire, they pondered their next steps, considering living in the forest like Robinson Crusoe but faced challenges without proper tools.|"['1.

Two friends, Will and Hans, ventured into the forest and stumbled upon a grim discovery: the lifeless bodies of their friends, all without heads, taken by the Malays. The harsh climate prevented them from burying the deceased, leaving them to nature's swift decomposition. Amidst the tragedy, they found solace in a lost treasure, the mate's ax. With dwindling food supplies and the hope of finding help, Will proposed a risky journey into the island's interior. Leaving the safety of the coast, they trekked through changing landscapes until they reached a Malay village perched in trees. Faced with armed inhabitants, Will and Hans signaled peace gestures, hoping to convey their peaceful intentions.

The leader, a tall man in his forties, approached the boys dressed in loincloths and copper bracelets. The boys respectfully offered him an ax as a gift, which pleased the chief. He then gestured for them to sit by a tree near his hut. Curious villagers approached, and a woman brought them a dish of bird stew and vegetables, a welcome change from their usual diet. That night, the boys slept on dried fern bundles but were kept awake by the village's chatter. The next day, they were well-fed and treated as guests. Later that night, they noticed hostile villagers approaching with ladders to attack. The boys, armed with sticks, foiled the attack, with the help of the villagers who defended their home.

In the early morning, the warriors came back with gory heads, proving their successful pursuit. The village erupted in celebrations with huge fires and a feast to honor the victory. The chief, treating the white men as heroes, thanked them for saving the village from harm. The natives then started cutting down a tree near the chief's hut. Hans, realizing their plan, joined in and worked efficiently with an ax. The tree fell, and the villagers built a platform and a hut for the boys. They felt safe and accepted into the village. However, a Malay messenger arrived, announcing an impending attack by hostile natives. The boys, unwilling to be taken away from the sea, decided to defend the village. They organized the villagers to create a protective barrier using sharp poles and bushes. The hostile group halted in the forest, planning a night attack.

In the village, preparations were made for a potential attack. Women crafted large torches from tree bark and resin, illuminating the outer circle while keeping the interior in shadow. Men were stationed as lookouts in the forest, ready to alert the village of any approaching danger. As the enemy neared, the defenders lit the torches and launched a barrage of arrows. The attackers, met with fierce resistance, retreated after failed attempts to breach the defenses. Throughout the night, the enemy made sporadic attacks but were repelled each time. The next day, it was discovered that the village's water supply was critically low. To avoid alerting the enemy, the villagers refrained from fetching more water.

Will climbed to a hut and surveyed the area. He noticed a dip in the land near the forest. Gesturing to the chief, Will suggested a plan. At night, the warriors would sneak out silently from the village, circle around to the stream, and ambush the enemy from behind. The chief hesitated, but Will insisted. As the day passed, water ran out, and scouts confirmed the enemy's presence. Will sent scouts with water buckets towards the stream, taunting the enemy. The enemy moved towards the stream, leaving the village vulnerable. At night, the chief led his men out with water baskets. They surprised the enemy, causing chaos. The villagers helped by creating distractions. The enemy fled, fearing the white boys. The chief capitalized on this fear, ensuring peace with nearby villages.|"['1.

For a while, the boys couldn't understand the language spoken by the chief and his warriors. However, they sensed the chief's triumph and the impending arrival of their former foes in a humbled state. The next day, six unarmed warriors and women bearing trays of fruits and birds approached the village. The chief gestured for the boys to sit beneath a tree as he led the delegation before them. The villagers offered gifts, spoke at length, and showed signs of submission. The boys accepted the offerings, shook hands with the warriors, and warned of dire consequences if the village was threatened again. The Malays left impressed. The boys shared the fruit, and the villagers celebrated. Despite considering escape, the boys faced challenges due to the scattered villages and hostile tribes. Their safety in the Malay village was assured, but the prospect of leaving seemed daunting given their lack of navigation knowledge.|"['1.

After careful consideration, the boys decided to build a small boat as a first step to escape, disguising it as a fishing venture. One day, they gestured towards the sea while out with the chief and his men, indicating their desire to go there. Despite the chief's initial refusal due to the danger posed by rival tribes, the boys persisted. Eventually, the chief relented, and with the help of several men, they constructed a rough canoe over three days. The boys used materials found along the shore, including copper nails from a shipwreck, to make fishing lines. When they launched the boat, they caught a significant amount of fish, impressing the natives. This success allowed them to continue fishing daily, gradually gaining the trust of the Malays and reducing the need for supervision during their outings.|"['1.

The fishing was done as soon as they arrived at the coast. Once they caught enough fish, they stored them in a large basket submerged in water near the shore to keep them fresh until they set off. The boys would paddle around the reef or rest in the boat under palm leaves during the hot hours. The Malay boys, left ashore after fishing, bathed or napped under trees. To hide the canoe from passing prahus, they dug a trench to float it below the beach level, covering it with seaweed. The boys found a wide passage through the reef wide enough for large ships to cross. Despite seeing Malay prahus pass by, they continued their routine. One day, they spotted a brig being chased by five prahus. The boys, skilled paddlers, headed for the ship through the reef passage to offer help against the pirates.|['1.

As the ship approached the narrow entrance, the captain swiftly directed the crew to lower the sails and anchor the vessel securely. Two boats were dispatched to the reef, anchoring the ship across the entrance. The Malay boats, initially trailing behind, were surprised as the ship safely navigated through the narrow opening. The crew prepared for a potential attack, loading their guns and aiming at the approaching prahus. When the enemy boats attempted to board, the crew unleashed a barrage of shots, causing chaos among the Malays. The ship successfully repelled the attack, sinking one boat and fending off the others.

Will and the captain discussed a plan to protect the ship from an attack by pirates. They decided to sink a barrel of powder with a fuse in the channel to surprise the Malays. The captain suggested using a long iron tube with a strip of paper dipped in saltpetre as a fuse to ignite the powder. They also added iron bits to the barrel to make it sink upright. By lowering the barrel into a boat, they prepared to implement their plan when they slipped their cables and sailed away. The captain hoped the fuse would burn long enough to deter the pirates from pursuing them. The crew worked together to set up the barrel with the powder and fuse, ready for action when needed.|"['1.

The sailors eagerly prepared for action like schoolboys. The machine, however, was delayed until the ship was back in place outside the channel. Around 2 a.m., the crew was alerted by the watch of approaching oars along the shore. Everyone silently took their positions. After a while, the rowing stopped, and silence fell. Half an hour passed before a faint sound nearby revealed a small boat in the channel, rowing swiftly into the darkness. Shots were fired after it as it disappeared. The captain believed the enemy would wait to attack until morning, having learned from a previous encounter. The crew quickly set a plan in motion involving a cask with a fuse.

Until now, none of Will's companions had spoken to him. During the chaos of disembarking, everyone was preoccupied with their own tasks. Only when he found himself in a railway carriage with eight comrades and a corporal did someone finally address him. Will explained that he was originally headed to China but ended up among the Malays due to a shipwreck. After some intense fighting and a stop in Calcutta, he decided to enlist for a potential conflict with the Afghans. Will shared his story in detail, which was well-received by the men. To integrate into the group, he even gave a sovereign to the corporal for drinks. The journey was arduous, with extreme heat causing everyone to shed their coats and sit in their shirt sleeves, sweating profusely. Upon reaching Allahabad, they rested until morning, using the station's water supply to freshen up. The regiment eventually arrived at their final destination after four days of travel, where they faced challenges with poor draft cattle and inadequate provisions. Despite the hardships, the Norfolk Rangers were in better shape compared to other troops. The regiment was under the command of General Roberts and was to operate in the Khuram valley.

The stop at Hazir-pir was quite enjoyable. Grass, fuel, and supplies were brought in abundance, but difficulties arose in determining prices due to the lack of a standardized currency in the valley. Sheep grazed on the hills, mainly belonging to nomad Ghilzais. The Khuram valley itself was barren, with only fruit trees surrounding villages. The scenery, however, was beautiful, with the Safaid-Koh mountains enclosing the valley. On the 24th, the headquarters moved towards the Darwazi Pass, and on the 25th, they crossed it and camped at Khuram fort. The forts had been destroyed by the Turis out of hatred for the Afghans. The general rode with cavalry to reconnoiter towards Peiwar-Khotal, where the enemy was retreating. Villages were seen burning, and rumors of abandoned guns circulated. The troops then moved towards Peiwar-Khotal to capture the guns.|['1.

The brigade followed orders, but the support regiment took a different path. No enemy was spotted on the south side, so they moved towards Turrai. The regiments in support stayed on the north side. The troops encountered Afghans on the mountain crest above. They fell back towards Turrai, where a skirmish broke out. The 5th Ghoorkas were deployed for cover. The troops piled arms in Turrai, but the Afghans fired a mountain gun from a distance. The troops moved to a safer spot after the attack. A reconnaissance mission revealed a deep ravine obstructing a direct attack. Another route, the Spingawi Pass, seemed more feasible.

The following day was spent preparing the camp and enhancing its defenses, surrounded by dense oak jungle. A thorough inspection of the Spingawi Pass was conducted, confirming the plan to launch an attack through it. Orders were issued for a nighttime march on December 1st, with the 29th Punjaub Infantry and the 5th Ghoorkas leading the main assault, followed by other regiments. Meanwhile, a diversionary battery was being constructed near the village of Turrai to mislead the enemy. Unbeknownst to the camp, the enemy forces were reinforced, and an impending attack was postponed due to their fatigue. William Gale, part of the Rangers, was pleased to accompany the column up the pass, anticipating the challenges ahead.

The soldier, puzzled by the darkness, expressed concern about fighting in such conditions, hindering marksmanship. Each regiment was accompanied by ammunition mules, hospital doolies, and dandies. The night march towards Peiwar village presented challenges with slippery terrain and icy boulders. Crossing the nullah posed difficulties, delaying the column. The soldiers struggled with the cold and slow pace. Brigadier General Thelwall's column faced setbacks, with troops losing their way in the darkness. The ascent towards Spingawi Pass was treacherous, with men falling due to deep holes. A rifle shot from within the ranks raised suspicions of treachery, leading to arrests and trials. The Afghan sentries heard the shots but took no action, missing an opportunity to alert their forces.|"['1.

The march continued along the stream for another mile and a half until the main waterway was left behind, and the road veered into a ravine to the left. The weary column trudged up the dark ravine, and an incident underscored the importance of staying close together during night marches. Two companies of the 72nd Highlanders found themselves separated from the rest of the troops when they reached a spot where the road split due to a fir-covered island in the middle of the ravine. The leading regiment had taken one path while the 72nd had unknowingly taken the other. Luckily, the roads rejoined, avoiding potential trouble. As they reached the foot of the Khotal, the guides departed, leaving the soldiers to face the impending battle. The Ghoorkas began their ascent in the early morning darkness, armed and ready. As they approached the enemy's stockade, a fierce fight ensued, but the Ghoorkas prevailed and continued their advance up the hill, facing heavy fire from the Afghans. The 72nd Highlanders joined the fray, and together with the Ghoorkas and the Rangers, they pushed forward, engaging in close combat with the enemy forces.|"['1.

William Gale reloaded his rifle and rushed to Captain Herbert's side as three Afghans attacked. One Afghan fired so close that the flash scorched Will's face. He swiftly shot the attacker and defended himself from the others with his bayonet. A Ghoorka joined in, helping to defeat the Afghans. The 29th Punjaubees arrived, pushing back the enemy. General Roberts signaled success to Brigadier General Cobbe. The troops rested briefly before advancing towards the Peiwar-Khotal. The 23rd Pioneers led, facing a tough fight in the dense forest. The skirmishers engaged the Afghans, slowly advancing through obstacles. The Afghans put up a strong fight, but the British troops persevered. Major Anderson led a successful assault, driving back the enemy. Despite heavy gunfire, the Punjaubees held their ground, repelling Afghan attacks. The intense battle lasted for hours, with both sides exchanging fire from behind cover.|"[""1.

General Roberts faced a challenging situation as he planned his attack against the Afghan forces. Despite the British forces not having any advantage yet, General Roberts felt it was risky to attempt a direct assault due to the enemy's superior numbers. Meanwhile, Brigadier General Cobbe led the 5th Punjaub Infantry and the 8th Regiment in a flank attack on the Peiwar-Khotal. The 5th Punjaub Infantry faced a tough ascent, taking six hours to reach the summit, where they engaged the enemy camp. The British troops caused chaos among the Afghans, leading to a retreat. General Roberts, realizing the difficulty of advancing through dense forest, changed tactics to cut off the Afghan retreat path. After a long day of fighting, the British forces bivouacked for the night, exhausted but ready to continue their mission.|"[""1.

The battle between the British forces and the Afghans was intense, with artillery fire exchanged for hours. The infantry also engaged in combat. The Afghans, positioned in the woods across the ravine, maintained a continuous fire. As the Afghans attempted to outflank the British, a cavalry charge forced them to retreat. The British artillery and infantry pushed back the Afghans, causing panic among them. Eventually, the Afghans abandoned their camp, leaving behind food, weapons, and possessions. The British forces secured the area and prepared for winter, as the Afghans fled towards the Shatur-Gardan Pass. With the enemy defeated, there were no immediate plans for further conflict until spring.|['1.

The soldiers worked hard to bring down the captured guns and ammo to the valley. Some troops even reached Ali-Kheyl, the main town. The Jajis, locals, were hostile but surrendered after the Afghan defeat. On the 12th, they prepared to return. General Roberts planned to use a new pass for the journey back. The group included the 8th Ghoorkas, 72nd Highlanders, Norfolk Rangers, 23rd Punjaub Pioneers, and a mountain battery. They marched through Mongal territory, facing icy paths and steep climbs. The Mongals were rumored to attack but didn't show up until the troops reached the Manjiar Pass. The descent was treacherous, with narrow paths and possible ambush spots. As they reached the open valley, the Mongals attacked the convoy, catching them off guard.|['1.

The troops faced no opposition as they camped near Bakh village, allowing the convoy to catch up. The following day, they moved to Matun, finding a square fort with circular corner bastions. The Afghan governor welcomed the general. The next morning, the troops encountered Mongals planning an attack. Strong pickets were set up, and the Mongals surrounded the camp. The troops were organized, with cavalry and artillery engaging the enemy. General Roberts oversaw the skirmish, driving off the attackers. The troops pursued the enemy, burning villages used as cover. Despite a prisoner escape attempt, the situation was brought under control.

Several days passed quietly as reconnaissance missions were conducted up the valley. General Stewart's success in capturing Candahar was reported while the troops waited. Engineers surveyed the area peacefully. On January 25th, part of the force returned to Hazir-pir. The decision to withdraw the entire force was made on the 26th due to the lack of strategic advantage and the constant threat from the natives. The fort was handed over to Sultan Jan, who was tasked with governing the Khost temporarily. Mongal chiefs were pacified with sheep and warned against interference. The troops were recalled after a Mongal attack, destroying the fort and returning safely. The Norfolk Rangers reinforced the troops at Peiwar-Khotal.

When he woke up, it was morning. He found himself in a small room being tended to by an elderly woman for a sword wound on his shoulder. Unbeknownst to him, he was ten miles away from where he was attacked. The attack was led by the head of a Jaji village hidden behind hills. This chief, although initially neutral, had to agree to the attack by his people. He wanted hostages to show goodwill to either the British or Afghans, depending on the outcome of the conflict. After Will was injured, the chief ordered his men to take him to the village for care. Despite several attacks, the British were alert and defended themselves. Will recovered slowly under the care of the old woman. Eventually, the chief decided to send Will to Cabul for his own benefit. He was too weak to walk, so he was placed on a camel and escorted by the chief and his headmen towards Cabul.|"[""1.

General Browne's force was split into four brigades for the mission. The first brigade, led by General Macpherson, included the 4th battalion of the Rifle Brigade, the 20th Bengal Infantry, the 4th Ghoorkas, and a mountain battery. They were to take a mountain path, guided by a local, to come down near Ali-Musjid. The second brigade, under Colonel Tytler, had the 1st battalion of the 17th Foot, the infantry of the Guides, the 1st Sikhs, and a mountain battery. They were to flank the Afghan batteries opposite Ali-Musjid. The third brigade had the 81st Regiment, the 14th Sikhs, and the 24th Native Infantry. The fourth brigade included the 51st Regiment, 6th Native Infantry, and the 45th Sikhs. The troops faced heavy fire from the enemy, prompting a temporary retreat before resuming the advance. The scene was intense, with British troops engaging Afghan defenses. The attack was postponed until the flanking columns arrived, with a portion of the troops staying put for the night. Meanwhile, the other brigades faced challenging terrain on their march to support the main force.|"['1.

Late at night, Macpherson and his brigade reached the top of the hill facing Ali-Musjid, while Tytler and his column descended into the Khyber valley behind the fort. The Afghans, though unopposed, panicked upon hearing the British were marching down behind them. They fled, abandoning everything that could slow them down. The British caught up, taking many prisoners. Unlike a European army, the Afghans couldn't regroup and defend a new position. The British advanced through the Khyber Pass, facing little opposition, and camped near Jellalabad for the winter. Sheer-Ali, the Ameer, had been torn between British support and Russian pressure. Feeling let down by the British, he turned to Russia for help, leading to a confrontation with the British envoy at Ali-Musjid.|"['1.

The Ameer and his allies miscalculated the English's ability to gather a strong force on the frontier before the snows. The English government's quick response, their soldiers' bravery, and the late arrival of winter thwarted the Ameer's plans. If the British campaign had been delayed until spring, they would have faced a more formidable opposition, possibly with Russian support. Sheer-Ali, left without an army, fled with his Russian companions to the north seeking aid. However, the rapid English advance disrupted Russian plans. Sheer-Ali's pleas for help went unanswered, leading to his demise. His son, Yakoob Khan, took over and negotiated peace with the British, maintaining his position as Ameer with certain concessions. The British withdrew most of their troops, and Yakoob Khan agreed to the terms to avoid conflict with the advancing British forces.|"[""1.

The city authorities surrendered as the army approached, and peace was established with the agreement that Candahar would remain under British control. The rationale behind this decision was to safeguard against potential Russian aggression towards India. The British believed that with Candahar fortified, they could effectively defend against any invading force, giving England time to muster its strength. However, opinions on occupying Candahar varied, and a change in the British government ultimately led to the abandonment of the territory. Along the journey to Cabul, William Gale faced hostility from villagers but was protected by his captors. Upon reaching Cabul, he was received by the Ameer and provided medical care. Despite initial animosity, one of his caretakers, the son of an old man, showed kindness and dedication in nursing William back to health.|['1.

During his time in the mountains, Will learned some Afghan words and improved his language skills while recovering in a hut. He formed a bond with his young companion, practicing conversations. The news of peace and the arrival of English officers moved him deeply. Will saw the Ameer and his men from the window, including Major Sir Lewis Cavagnari. When they passed by, Will saluted them. Major Cavagnari, surprised, spoke to the Ameer who then summoned Will. In the palace, they discussed his recovery and the Ameer rewarded the boy for his care. Will, weak but in uniform, met the officers. Major Cavagnari ensured Will's comfort in their house. Doctor Kelly's treatment and the English company helped Will recover quickly.

For a few weeks after Major Cavagnari's arrival in Cabul, everything seemed fine. Despite concerns about the mission's safety, the city appeared peaceful. The Ameer had invited Major Cavagnari, promising protection. However, trouble brewed when troops from Herat arrived, criticizing the peace treaty. Riots erupted, and the soldiers faced hostility. Major Cavagnari was warned of potential mutiny by a cavalry officer. Despite assurances from the Ameer, tensions rose. Will, an orderly-room sergeant, observed the escalating danger but longed for a recall to his regiment. He shared rumors with Sir Lewis, but the true peril was downplayed in official reports.

Yossouf handed Will an Afghan soldier's uniform, warning of an imminent attack. Will, determined to stand by his officers, refused to escape. As the danger approached, Will knew his duty was to fight alongside his comrades. The Ameer's promise of protection gave them hope. However, tension rose as news of trouble spread. Major Cavagnari alerted the Ameer of the impending danger. With only fifty men for defense, the residency braced for the attack.

The brave Guides, aided by the Budmashes and unruly citizens of Cabul, fought valiantly against thousands of Afghans who besieged the house. The defenders faced heavy gunfire and shell attacks. Despite their outnumbered situation, they displayed remarkable courage and resilience. Major Cavagnari and his men, including Will Gale, showed exceptional leadership and marksmanship. As the battle raged on, the house caught fire, and the defenders continued to fight until the flames overtook them.

Unnoticed, Will and Yossouf left the gate and merged with the crowd, slipping into the stables where Budmashes were looting. Yossouf gathered horse rugs, motioning for Will to do the same. With rugs on their shoulders, they blended in, exiting the enclosure. Yossouf led Will to bushes outside, unveiling a uniform for Will to disguise himself as an Afghan soldier. As they headed towards the lower gate, villagers joined the celebration over the defeat of the Kaffirs. Yakoob Khan's inaction during the attack led to his downfall.

At the crack of dawn, Will and his loyal companion reached the Parsee merchant's door in the Hindoo section of Cabul. Due to the ongoing mission attack sounds throughout the night, the doors were tightly secured, fearing a possible violent outburst targeting the Hindoo and Parsee traders in the area. A brief pause, then the door creaked open, shutting swiftly after their entry. Inside, a lamp illuminated the anteroom where Hindoos, wrapped in cloths, rose to observe the newcomers. The trader descended, casting light on Will's pale face. Instructing them to follow, the Parsee guided them upstairs. Overwhelmed by exhaustion and blood loss, Will stumbled, saved from falling by Yossouf and the Parsee, who laid him on a couch. After briefing the trader on the situation, they ensured no suspicion of harboring a British survivor. The Parsee believed aiding Will would benefit him upon the British's return to Cabul. Will was treated for his wounds before being moved to a serene chamber to rest, guarded by Yossouf. Word of the massacre swiftly spread, prompting military action for retribution.|"[""1.

As is typical of the British, the large transport train assembled for war was disbanded once peace was declared. General Roberts faced the challenge of gathering animals again for transport. Eventually, he managed to collect 2000 mules, 700 camels, and bullocks from the Punjaub. Despite some tribes causing trouble, General Roberts advanced with his troops to Shatur-Gardan. The Ameer's letters were disregarded due to suspicions of his involvement in the massacre. The invading force encountered no enemies as they navigated difficult terrain. The Ameer, Yakoob Khan, unexpectedly arrived at the camp, claiming he couldn't control his troops. However, his motives remained unclear. The army moved forward in two divisions due to limited transport. A proclamation assured loyal subjects of the Ameer fair treatment. As tensions rose with the locals, attacks were repelled.

The British troops faced a perilous situation in the Logan valley. If they had been defeated, the local inhabitants were ready to join forces against them. The Ghilzais and other tribes were poised to attack, making escape impossible. The enemy strategically positioned themselves at a narrow defile beyond Chaurasia, with guns and matchlock men ready to ambush the British. The Afghans believed their hillside advantage would deter the British from storming their position. However, General Roberts decided to take action, marching out to confront the Afghan army despite the daunting odds. The British forces split into two columns, with General Baker leading the main attack on the left flank. Major White commanded a feint attack on the right to distract the enemy. The British troops faced fierce resistance as they climbed the hills, but their determined advance disrupted the Afghan shooters' accuracy.

The 72nd regiment, with the help of mountain guns and Gatlings, fought bravely against Afghan forces. The British troops drove the enemy back, fueled by a fierce desire for revenge after the Cabul mission massacre. Despite the enemy's resistance, the Afghans eventually retreated. Major White's column also achieved success on the right, capturing guns and clearing the road. The cavalry faced challenges due to difficult terrain but managed to capture the Ameer's camp. The defeat of the Afghan army caused the tribesmen to retreat. General Roberts took control of Cabul, and the villagers, hostile towards British troops, were punished for their attacks.

The following day, a soldier was sent to deliver a message to the colonel of the 67th regiment stationed in Bala-Hissar. As he crossed the open area, a sudden explosion threw him to the ground, causing chaos and destruction. The blast originated from a gunpowder magazine that had exploded, leading to a series of dangerous events. Despite the chaos, the soldiers managed to extinguish the flames and prevent further damage. The incident highlighted the precarious situation the British force found themselves in, isolated and surrounded by hostile Afghan tribes.

Fortunately, he had a secure position in the Ameer's barracks at Sherpur, where he felt confident he could defend against any attacks. These barracks, built by Sheer-Ali for cavalry, formed a large square with high walls on three sides and a steep hill on the fourth. While the walls were long for the defending force, efforts were made to gather provisions and forage for winter. The natives' hostility grew with priests inciting rebellion. The English general, with less than 6000 men against 100,000 Afghan troops, saw a crisis approaching. When the storm hit, the English faced a sudden attack. Two columns led by Macpherson and Baker were sent out, but their routes prevented cooperation. General Massy and his cavalry were to support Macpherson.

As the soldiers rushed down the hill, they quickly readied their weapons for battle. The enemy approached with full force, with 4,000 men forming a crescent shape and another 6,000 behind them in disarray. The ground was not ideal for artillery due to watercourses, hindering movement. Despite the large opposing force, General Massy chose to stay and fire shells at the advancing Afghans. The enemy, unfazed by the shells, continued their advance, causing havoc among the cavalry and artillery. Sir Frederick Roberts arrived and ordered a cavalry charge to halt the enemy. The brave troopers charged into the Afghan infantry, engaging in a fierce battle. The chaplain, Reverend Mr. Adams, showed exceptional bravery during the charge, earning the Victoria Cross. Despite the cavalry's efforts, the enemy continued to advance, leading to casualties and the abandonment of some artillery.|"[""1.

During a critical situation in Cabul, General Roberts acted swiftly by sending a trooper to General Gough for reinforcements. William Gale, inexperienced on horseback, rode back urgently to bring the Highlanders to the gorge. The Highlanders, led by Colonel Brownlow, swiftly engaged the enemy, preventing a disaster in Cabul. General Macpherson's brigade also joined the fight, facing a strong Afghan force on a peak south of Cabul. After intense fighting, the British forces managed to defeat the enemy and secure their position. Despite continuous enemy threats, including a massive charge, the British forces, with heroic efforts, successfully repelled the attacks and maintained control.

During a critical time in General Roberts' strategy, he decided to gather his troops at Sherpur, realizing the impossibility of holding the Bala-Hissar and Cabul against the overwhelming opposing forces. General Baker valiantly maintained his position until the troops were safely withdrawn to Sherpur, despite being surrounded by Afghan hordes. The British forces fortified their defenses, preparing for an imminent attack. When the Afghans finally assaulted, the British troops, strategically positioned, repelled the attackers with a relentless barrage of musketry and artillery fire. The Afghans, unable to breach the British defenses, eventually retreated. General Gough's relieving force approaching from afar further demoralized the Afghan assailants. A coordinated assault by British cavalry and infantry caused the Afghans to flee in panic, securing a decisive victory for the British troops.|"[""1.

By evening, the Afghans had either fled to the hills or been pushed into Cabul. The next day, General Gough's troops entered Cabul, only to find the city deserted by the enemy once again. After a decisive defeat, the British were in control. With the enemy's forces dispersed and defeated, there was little concern for further attacks. The natives were subdued, and the insolence shown before was gone. On January 3rd, Sergeant Gale was summoned by General Roberts, who joyfully announced Gale's appointment to the 66th Regiment due to his bravery. Despite not being in the same division, Gale was advised to join his regiment in Candahar. General Roberts offered financial assistance for outfit and travel expenses, which Gale politely declined, citing existing funds. Gale acquired necessary gear from a fallen comrade and set off with an escort towards Jellalabad.|"['1.

The guides were alert as they advanced, led by Captain Edwards. William Gale rode alongside him, ready to act in case of an emergency. When shots were fired ahead, Will rode forward with six men to assess the enemy's strength. The situation was tense, with the enemy too strong to confront head-on. Will strategically positioned his men behind cover, engaging in a skirmish. Captain Edwards split the group, with thirty men on the left and others on the right, while a rear guard protected the convoy. The fight intensified, with casualties on both sides. As night fell, the battle continued in the dark valley. The Guides held their ground, defending against the encroaching enemy.

The Sikhs bravely fought back, allowing the convoy to pass through safely. The enemy, realizing their defeat, retreated.

It was simple to venture alone through the dark night, avoiding danger from the Afghans. The colonel praised Gale's courage, stating it took more bravery than charging in the light. Gale felt proud of the Norfolk Rangers for their kindness and support. The general welcomed Gale warmly and listened to his modest account of the convoy attack. After two days, Gale left Jellalabad with Yossouf, traveling to Peshawur and then down the Indus River to Sukkur. The railway construction to Candahar was a great project for trade, but was abandoned with the city. Gale continued to Candahar, joining his new regiment.

In early April, General Sir Donald Stewart led a large force from Candahar towards Cabul, passing through Ghuzni, a town known for its fanatical population. The march aimed to overawe tribesmen and disrupt their organization. As they reached Shahjui, the start of Taraki country, signs of resistance grew. Mollahs preached a holy war, and thousands gathered for opposition. When the column reached Ahmed-Khel, 12,000 to 15,000 enemy troops were spotted on hills near the village. To protect the long baggage line, General Stewart chose to engage them in battle.

The battle commenced with a sudden rush of the enemy, led by fanatical Ghazis armed with a variety of weapons. The Ghazis, determined to exterminate the British, charged with wild yells, catching the troops off guard. Chaos ensued as the cavalry was surrounded, and the infantry faced a fierce hand-to-hand struggle. Despite the confusion, Colonel Lister swiftly organized his men into squares and unleashed a devastating fire on the attackers. The British regiments, including the 59th Foot, Ghoorkas, and Sikhs, stood their ground, repelling the Ghazis with valor. The Ghazis relentlessly attacked, attempting to capture the guns, but were met with a relentless barrage.

The summer in Candahar passed pleasantly with peaceful days filled with cricket matches and horse races. Governor Wali Shere Ali, a British protege, organized a native army. However, isolated attacks by Ghazis on British officers and men marred the peace. One day, as William Gale walked with Colonel Ripon, Ghazis attacked the colonel. William intervened, shooting one attacker and engaging the other. Soldiers from the 66th regiment arrived to end the conflict. Both William and the colonel sustained wounds but were soon on the path to recovery.

Ayoub's army was slowly advancing, hindered by a lack of transportation and the challenging terrain. The presence of numerous guns further slowed their progress, but by mid-July, they were close. The Wali's troops, displaying signs of rebellion, were suspected of being influenced by Ayoub's agents. Despite discussions about disarming them, the Wali believed in their loyalty. With a small British force, it was risky to reduce their numbers. Will and fellow officers set out for a day of shooting, hoping to gather information on the locals' sentiments towards Ayoub and the British. As they reached a village for lunch, they noticed the villagers' hostile looks, hinting at potential unrest. The officers enjoyed a hearty meal and a brief respite before continuing their day.|"[""1.

Fortescue, in a relaxed manner, mentioned that they were armed and prepared if the Ghazis tried to attack. He expressed his intention to stay put until the weather cooled down.

Will had a plan to sneak through the Afghans unnoticed. The young officers were in good spirits despite the danger. Will was their leader, responsible for their safety. They waited until dusk to execute the plan. They disguised themselves as Afghan women to escape. The old woman helped by distracting the Afghans. They left the fort without being noticed. The Afghans tried to attack twice but failed. Suddenly, cavalry arrived to help. The officers mounted spare horses and rode away quickly. The village was set on fire as they left.|"[""1.

The Afghans yelled loudly and shot bullets over the village, keeping their distance. The officer ordered the party to trot, and as they left, they heard a loud roar as the Afghan fort was destroyed. Two hours later, they safely reached camp, where the rescued officers were warmly congratulated. On July 14th, the Wali's troops mutinied openly, marching out with cannons and arms. Colonel Ripon rushed to the British camp with the news. The British commander's delay allowed the mutineers to escape. Eventually, the British cavalry and artillery pursued and seized the Wali's guns. Colonel Burrows' small force stood alone, seeking reinforcements from General Primrose, who declined to send any. Ayoub's advancing force prompted Burrows to fall back to Khusk-I-Nakhud. The British troops moved to intercept Ayoub at Maiwand, only to realize they faced the entire enemy force. The British position was ill-suited for battle, with ravines on both sides and hills overlooking them. Despite being outnumbered, they prepared to face Ayoub's army, which included fierce Ghazis and tribesmen.|"['1.

The morning was misty, concealing Ayoub's army movements. Lieutenant Maclean swiftly directed his cavalry and artillery to engage the Afghan army. The British infantry, with the 66th on the right, Bombay Grenadiers in the center, and Jacob's Rifles on the left, faced the advancing enemy. As the Afghan artillery unleashed fire, the British responded with Martini rifles. The battle intensified with artillery duels and flanking attacks. Despite ammunition shortages, the British held their ground until chaos ensued. Jacob's Rifles faltered under the Ghazi attacks, leading to a domino effect of confusion among the troops. Amidst the turmoil, the cavalry hesitated to charge, causing a critical setback. The officers debated the strategy, torn between advancing or retreating on challenging terrain.|"['1.

The captain, surrounded by chaos and danger, realized the dire situation. He knew that their only hope was to endure until nightfall. Despite the heavy losses, the 66th regiment stood firm, repelling the enemy's advances. The cavalry's inaction was disappointing, leaving the infantry to fend for themselves. In the face of overwhelming odds, the men fought bravely, using every house as a stronghold. Colonel Galbraith and many officers fell, but the troops fought on valiantly. Will Gale's company, on the right flank, formed a square and provided cover for the retreat.

Captain Fletcher selected a few less tired soldiers and stationed them on the outskirts of the village to alert others in case of an Afghan attack. The men rested under the shade of houses, feeling utterly drained. The officers managed to find jars of water in the houses, which they shared among the men, providing much-needed relief. As the day progressed, a cavalry unit was spotted coming to their aid, bringing much relief to the exhausted group. The cavalry had water supplies and light carts to assist the stragglers. By the time they reached Candahar, the soldiers had marched 60 miles without proper sustenance, fighting for nearly 24 hours. The city prepared for a potential attack, strengthening defenses and gathering provisions. The Afghan army, demoralized by their losses, took some time before advancing towards Candahar.

The defeat at Maiwand caused a stir in India, prompting action to aid Candahar. A division from Cabul and General Phayre from Quettah were mobilized. However, Phayre faced delays due to a lack of transport caused by previous decisions. The enemy, led by Ayoub, maintained a distant siege on Candahar, anticipating the garrison's surrender due to food shortages. Skirmishes occurred but no major assaults were made. The British forces, including Highlanders, Pioneers, Punjaub Infantry, and cavalry, marched to relieve Candahar, facing no significant resistance. The Ameer supported them, ensuring a smooth journey. After a challenging march, they reached Ghuzni and Khelat-I-Ghilzai, advancing swiftly towards Candahar.

During a difficult time at the 66th Regiment, Will Gale found himself in a position of leadership due to the loss of senior officers. With only three companies remaining, the troops had to protect vacant houses left by fleeing merchants. Colonel Primrose encouraged the merchants to leave, promising to safeguard their properties. To defend these houses from looters, officers were relocated from barracks to the vacant homes. Will, armed with a pistol and sword, confronted Afghan thieves in a warehouse with the help of Yossouf.

The infantry had nothing left but to plunder Ayoub's camp and secure the captured guns, totaling thirty. The camp was stocked with a vast amount of supplies and various items: weapons, food, clothing, money, and more. The cavalry pursued the fleeing enemies, although they faced challenges navigating the rough terrain. They managed to drive the scattered enemy forces into the hills. The discovery of Lieutenant Maclaine's body in Ayoub's camp, who was brutally murdered, added to the fury of the troops. The battle resulted in the loss of three officers and casualties among the soldiers. The enemy suffered heavy losses, with 1200 dead on the battlefield.
