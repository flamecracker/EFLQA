Alice, the youngest in the Parlin family, was thrilled when Grandma Read shared the news of their new baby sister. Susy danced with joy while Prudy, in her excitement, accidentally tumbled down the cellar stairs. Luckily, she landed softly and wasn't hurt. Susy felt this was the happiest day ever and couldn't understand why she was crying tears of joy. The nurse, with a wart on her nose, warned Prudy to stop crying or leave. Susy explained that boys cause noise, unlike their new baby sister. Susy lectured Prudy on being kind to the baby sent by God. The new baby amazed everyone with her first cries and sneezes. Prudy wished everyone could see her beautiful new sister. Mrs. Parlin avoided cradles, preferring to wrap the baby in a blanket.

At first, it was feared that the baby was severely injured, but to everyone's relief, she was only found to have a broken nose. Prudy, her older sister, became more cautious around the fragile baby, always checking under silk handkerchiefs for hidden babies. As time passed, the baby, named Alice but often called Dotty Dimple, grew into a lively toddler who did not like to be pitied for her falls. She preferred action over words, using her little finger as a guide to express her desires. One day, while her mother made jelly and Prudy watched, Alice was left in Susy's care on the piazza. However, Susy got distracted, leaving Alice unattended as she wandered off, pondering which way she should go to find her little sister.|"[""1.

After darting around for a while, Susy hurried back home to sound the alarm. Mrs. Parlin, Norah, and Prudy dashed out without even pausing to turn off the stove where jelly was cooking. They split up and set off in different directions to find the missing child. Prudy, in a hushed tone, described her little sister, Alice Wheelbarrow Parlin, who was wearing a pink dress, had curly hair cascading down her neck, bright eyes, and was two and a half years old. Puzzled by the man's whispers, Prudy presumed the need for secrecy regarding Dotty's disappearance. The soap-man suggested Prudy ride with him to cover ground faster.

As Alice Parlin entered her home, she noticed Dotty's pink dress fluttering. Dotty had wandered off following a man with images, saying animal sounds. Mrs. Parlin trusted Susy to take care of Dotty, despite Susy's doubts about her memory. Alice, at three, felt left out when her sisters went to Sunday school. Dotty insisted she was going too. Prudy, wanting to include Dotty, asked her mother for permission. Mrs. Parlin hesitated but eventually agreed. Prudy, patient and caring, prepared Dotty for Sunday school. Susy explained to Prudy about snow and rain. Susy reminded Prudy to be quiet on the street on Sundays. In Sunday school, Dotty joined Prudy's class.

Dotty sat attentively, trying to understand why someone would need a lamp shining on their feet. She admired how Prudy enjoyed Sabbath school for the amusing stories. When it was time for the girls to share their verses, Dotty was surprised she wasn't asked to participate. Feeling a bit ignored, she cleared her throat loudly to get noticed. Miss Carlisle smiled at her, and Dotty couldn't resist standing up on her tiptoes, despite Prudy's attempts to stop her. This incident led to Dotty being banned from Sabbath school for a while. However, the encounter with Miss Carlisle left a lasting impression on her, and she often pondered over the unfamiliar words she had heard.

Mrs. Parlin suggested Susy inform Aunt Eastman of their arrival and allowed Prudy to walk freely. While wandering, Prudy found a live bird's nest with baby birds. Dotty Dimple arrived, proud of her journey, but upset Prudy ran away. Dotty's supper didn't taste right seeing Prudy enjoying hers. Despite Dotty's love for Prudy, she secretly enjoyed seeing her punished. Prudy, tired and sleepy, had a temperamental day and mischievously put ashes in Johnny's hair. Mrs. Parlin, patient and loving, decided it was time to take Dotty home. Even in Dotty's tantrum, her mother remained kind, teaching a lesson in patience to Susy and Prudy.

"Dotty peered out the window once more. ""I'm such a good girl,"" she thought, ""not crying like Prudy would. Look, there's the blacksmith's shop."" Dotty admired the blacksmith, thinking, ""His mother lets him go everywhere. Everyone's mother lets them go everywhere."" In a hushed voice, Dotty whispered to herself, ""Oh, what a beautiful hat you have! Would your mom make you wear a fancy dress like mine? No, she wouldn't. Your mom lets you go to parties all the time, only on Sundays. My mom has me stuck in the nursery with just a needle to sew! Oh, dear! I haven't run away in forever! They don't allow me to. I wish Fanny Harlow had invited me to her party. I know why she didn't! She forgot I exist."" Despite the struggle, Dotty managed to squeeze into her red merino dress. ""Oh, dear,"" she sighed, ""this dress is so tight, I won't grow today!"" Admiring her mother's purple breakfast shawl, she draped it over her shoulders with excitement. Dotty then found Nono's Sunday bonnet, a claret-colored silk piece with fiery red and yellow flames inside, that made her face look small underneath.

The small child approached slowly, with a big bonnet and a purple shawl. Susy felt disappointed, wondering how the child would behave at the table. Her manners needed work. Prudy was also concerned but remained hopeful. Dotty, the little girl, refused to take off her bonnet, claiming it added to her importance. She tore a book page in her eagerness to show her abilities, surprising herself. During supper, Dotty sat like a queen, crumbing bread into her milk and dipping it with her fork. She coughed and made a mess, but her sisters hoped she would improve. They wanted her to learn to read and be polite.|"['1.

"Prudy smiled but hid her face in the pillow, hoping Dotty didn't notice. She needed a new plan to help Dotty understand the challenges of growing up. ""Let's start,"" Prudy said, pouring blocks on the floor. ""I'll ring the bell for school. You must come in and sit."" ""Take the rocking-chair!"" Prudy suggested. ""I'll sit on the ottoman; it's just as good. It wouldn't be right for the teacher to rock. School's in session!"" Dotty pointed and laughed. ""You don't know much, Prudy! Funny teacher! Have you ever seen a monkey dance? I've seen one with a man playing music."" As they continued, Dotty associated letters with familiar things, like seeing a bat as ""Zip with an umbrella.""

""Susy will be finished practicing soon, and I wanted to finish making my doll's boots. Can't it wait until Saturday, Dotty?"" As she began her lesson, she asked, ""What do we drink from cups?""

During their visit to Florence Eastman, Miss Dimple and Johnny had a scary moment when they nearly derailed from the upper railroad track. Everyone was relieved when they were safe. The family then embarked on their journey to Willow-brook, leaving behind Dotty's beloved toys. At grandma Parlin's house, the children enjoyed familiar places like the summer-house, the tree seat, and the swing. They found new additions like a hen house and a boat named the Water-Kelpie.

Shortly after receiving praise from Abner, Aunt Martha mentioned that she and Master Lonnie were heading across the river to gather wild-flower roots. They requested the boat be sent for them at five o'clock. Susy, pondering the situation, realized Abner was nowhere in sight and it was already past five. Feeling confident in her rowing abilities, she decided to use a smooth shingle as a makeshift paddle. With determination, Susy dipped the shingle into the water and confidently began rowing towards the other shore. Despite Dotty's initial concerns, Susy reassured her and successfully navigated the boat across the still, blue water. Upon reaching the shore, Susy called out for Aunt Martha, but she was nowhere to be found. The children secured the boat as best they could, but the strong current caused it to drift downstream.|"['1.

Aunt Martha was surprised but not pleased when Susy and Lonnie went rowing alone. She scolded Susy for being reckless and sent them to ask Abner to bring them back with the canoe. Abner caught the runaway Water-Kelpie and proudly showed it as proof of Susy's skill. A special supper was planned at grandma Parlin's for Colonel Augustus Allen's arrival.

Dotty, too proud to weep and too furious to turn back, roamed until she reached the edge of the Parlin woods. There, she found a small creek flowing over gray rocks, the same creek where Horace used to fish. At first, it seemed like Abby was responding to her, but it turned out to be just an echo of Dotty's voice. Feeling abandoned, Dotty imagined scenarios of being eaten by a bear or a wolf. Suddenly, she noticed a small sailboat on the water. Ignoring her fears, she focused on retrieving the boat. After several failed attempts, Dotty bravely waded into the creek, only to find it deeper than she thought. As she struggled, her cries went unheard until Zip, a nearby dog, came to her rescue.|"['1.
