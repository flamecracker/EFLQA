Salemina, Francesca, and I have journeyed together before, gaining a deep understanding of each other. Our relationship forms a triangle of companionship, akin to a marriage where the initial excitement has settled into a comfortable friendship. Our adventures in England are well-known, as we wrote extensively about them in letters shared with friends and read aloud in various cities. Upon our return to New York, Francesca learned that a young lawyer she had discouraged from pursuing her was now engaged to another. This news came as a surprise, as Francesca had a habit of advising her suitors to find more suitable partners, yet none had taken her advice until now. Despite her disappointment, Francesca's resilient heart remains intact, ready for new experiences and the unfolding chapters of life.|"['1.

Salemina and her friends found themselves in a third-class train compartment, having saved money by opting for cheaper tickets. Salemina had a collection of books including Literary Landmarks and Royal Edinburgh, while her companions had their own reading material. Despite the discomfort of traveling in third class, Salemina shared fascinating historical tidbits about stagecoaches from the 18th century.

If I had studied Susanna Crum for years, with her image constantly inspiring me, I would have named her Susanna Crum. Not a single letter could be changed, not a sound removed. I declared this upon first sight, and getting to know her intimately only increased my admiration for the genius that named her. We should have immediately offered sacrifices and praises, but having seen the sun often in America, we took it for granted, not realizing its significance. When I mention Edinburgh sunshine, I don't mean the intense warmth found in other countries. It is a weak, fleeting ray, admired by the locals. The Scots optimistically believe settled weather is near when the sun timidly appears. The city's grey beauty, with hints of gold, blue, green, and purple, captures the hearts of its residents. Francesca, eager for adventure, vanished mysteriously, prompting a search. She was found excitedly recounting an encounter with soldiers in kilts. She urged us to join her in pursuing them, captivated by the sight.|"['1.

In the Gardens, a dazzling parade of Highlanders moved through the sunlit landscape, their bonnets waving, bagpipes playing. Princes Street, a grand terrace, overlooked by the magnificent Edinburgh Castle, offered a breathtaking view of the city. The castle, perched high, was a testament to ancient times when fortresses like these were built with courage. The sight stirred imaginations of battles long past, calling forth images of beacon-fires and calls to arms. The castle's rugged beauty stood as a stark contrast to modern comforts, a reminder of the past's picturesque and tumultuous history.

On the eve of the battle of Prestonpans, the Highland army is preparing to encamp under the Rock of Dunsappie on Arthur's Seat. The prince will gather his chiefs and nobles for a council at dusk, and at daybreak, they will march through the hedgerows and woods of Duddingston. The bagpipes will play, the colors will fly, with Bonnie Charlie leading the way, his sword drawn and the scabbard tossed aside! I hope that a Peace Congress will not be held in Edinburgh, for the Castle's influence could sway the delegates. They might end up buying Scottish souvenirs and getting swept up in the culture. As my thoughts wandered, Salemina and Francesca shopped for Scottish trinkets, immersing themselves in the local heritage. As we settled in, we encountered hyphenated guests, a common sight in this Scottish abode, where ancient families unite through marriage. Our conversations with Miss Diggity-Dalgety, the cook, revealed a mix of Scottish and French culinary influences, adding a unique flavor to our stay.|"['1.

"Susanna Crum, a diligent young woman from Aberdeenshire, is a valuable asset, though her reticence can be perplexing. Her cautious demeanor, possibly influenced by her Scottish roots, prompts her to respond with cryptic phrases like ""I cudna say"" when probed for information. Susanna's enigmatic mannerisms and indecisiveness are a blend of shyness and prudence, creating an air of mystery around her. Despite her reluctance to engage, Susanna's strong work ethic and practical skills shine through. Her unique accent, deeply rooted in her Aberdeenshire heritage, adds to her enigmatic charm. Her reserved nature, bordering on obstinacy, seems like a defense mechanism, perhaps shaped by historical events like heresy trials.

"""Come, my girl, you must answer the court's questions. You've lived with the prisoner since you were very young. He provided for you, visited your home, and cared for your siblings.

Invitations flooded in after our introduction letters. Francesca got ready for our debut in Edinburgh society. She hoped to make a good impression. It started raining, so she had to take a cab. Salemina doesn't ask for help when she doesn't understand. Francesca noticed her coachman had a club foot and a wooden leg. He didn't know the way to Kildonan House, Helmsdale. Lady Baird explained the location. Our Edinburgh friends enjoyed the story. We got ready for a grand dinner at eight, not seven-thirty. Susanna didn't know the exact distance to Fotheringay Crescent, but the boots maid said it was a short drive, so we relaxed by the fire."|"['1.

Lady Baird's birthday celebration was a grand affair. We honored her with a bouquet in Maclean tartan and the battle-cry 'Another for Hector.' Wearing holly sprigs, the family badge, I added tartan velvet to my gown and borrowed Francesca's emerald necklace. Francesca was envious but Salemina, a citizen of the world, remained composed. Overheard conversations hinted at American stereotypes. Salemina's unbiased nature shone through. Francesca pondered on historical figures, while I decided to choose distinguished ancestors for a dinner in Edinburgh. Ancestors seemed to define nationality and status, but I felt it should be a personal choice. I aimed to be a pioneer in selecting my lineage, starting with the logical Sir William Hamilton.|"[""1.

"""He passed away just around thirty years back, and you would have to be his offspring: that simply won't work,"" remarked Salemina. ""Why not choose Thomas Hamilton, the Earl of Melrose and Haddington? He held prestigious titles like Secretary of State, King's Advocate, and Lord President of the Court of Session. King James even referred to him as 'Tam o' the Cowgate'!"" ""He's at least your great-great-great-great-grandfather; that's quite a safe distance. Then there's the famous Jenny Geddes, who famously threw her stool at the Dean in St. Giles'—she was a Hamilton too, if that catches your fancy!"" ""Yes, I'd gladly choose her,"" I replied gratefully. ""I don't know why she flung the stool, but there's always a bit of spunk in stool-flingers; it's the kind of spirit one appreciates inheriting in a diluted form. Now, who will you pick?"" ""Francesca!"" I protested. ""Are you suggesting that you can dine with a direct descendant of Sir Fitzroy Donald Maclean, Baronet, of Duart and Morven, and not put in any effort to trace your ancestry back beyond your parents?""

Sydney Smith once reminisced about his time in Edinburgh, praising the city for its excellent hearts and cultivated minds despite the odious smells and barbarous sounds of the past. He critiqued the prevalent Scotch humor and dialectics of the time. Today, Edinburgh has evolved, shedding its negative aspects while retaining its intellectual charm. The dinner conversations in Edinburgh are a blend of wit and dialectics, providing a solid foundation for engaging discussions. The customs at the dining table may differ slightly from what we are used to, but the grace and skill with which the hostess carves and serves are notable. The Scottish butler, resembling an elder of the kirk, adds a touch of sanctity to the dining experience. The men dress in a manner similar to others, with no kilts in sight, unlike Lord Napier's valet's fashion mishap. Scotswomen exhibit a sober and stylish taste in their attire, reflecting the influence of Presbyterianism in their society. The society's diversity in Presbyterianism may contribute to their reserved fashion choices. The ladies of the 'smart set' in Edinburgh flaunt French fashion, while others opt for more conservative styles. Lord Cockburn's vivid description of Mrs. Rochead's regal presence showcases the extravagant fashion of the aristocratic women of his time. The narrator's ability to quote Lord Cockburn surprises their dinner companion, an earl, highlighting the charm of being well-read and adaptable to new environments.|"['1.

"At a fancy dinner, the earl seemed more interested in Francesca's beauty than learning about my background. Francesca, radiant and engaged in a debate, caught his eye. I decided to impress him, subtly showing my worth. Salemina, charming and witty, held court with the W.S. by her side. The earl liked my choice of ancestors, hinting we might be distantly related.

The dean noticed my confusion and kindly admitted that he was taking advantage of my lack of knowledge. He shared a humorous story about a teacher at Arndilly, who, when asked to make a toast at a party, awkwardly raised his glass and said, “The reflection of the moon in the calm bosom of the lake!” As we moved to the drawing-room, the earl complimented me on my country's men not needing champagne at dinner when dining with American women. Despite his flattering remarks, I couldn't help but feel amused by his sweeping generalizations. Later, Salemina discussed a minister who was rude and stereotyped American girls. The minister, in turn, made snide comments about American culture. Francesca cleverly responded to his jabs, highlighting the cultural differences between Scotland and America.|"['1.

"""I am glad you did restrain yourself--once,"" exclaimed Salemina. ""What a tactful person the Reverend Ronald must be, if you have reported him faithfully! Why didn't you give him up, and turn to your other neighbour?""

""I did, as soon as I could with courtesy; but the man on my left was the type that always haunts me at dinners; if the hostess hasn't one on her visiting-list she imports one for the occasion. He asked me at once of what material the Brooklyn Bridge is made. I told him I really didn't know. Why should I? I seldom go over it.

Francesca responded to a Britisher's comment on her vocabulary by cleverly shifting the conversation. She highlighted the differences in phraseology between Americans and Brits, particularly focusing on the preposition used with fish and potatoes. Despite the humorous exchange, Francesca later confessed to her friend Salemina about being rude to the Reverend Ronald during a discussion about international marriages. She expressed her strong opinions about American gold supporting the British nobility, leading to a heated conversation.

An unusual air of excitement filled 22 Breadalbane Terrace a few days ago. The lodgers were buzzing with activity as some prepared to depart. Mrs. Menzies, known as Mingess, headed back to Kilconquhar, or Kinyuchar as she called it. Miss Cockburn-Sinclair, soon to be Coburn-Sinkler, left for Inverness after buying her wedding attire. The Hepburn-Sciennes, soon departing, had finally mastered the pronunciation of their names. Cleaning fervor took over the place, with scrubbing brushes and brooms in action. The stair carpets hung out to dry in the garden, while Susanna polished the stair-rods. Pails of suds dotted the halls, and the dinners served resembled suburban American washing-day meals. On May 19th, the castle was a hive of activity as distinguished guests arrived for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The Lord High Commissioner and the Marchioness of Heatherdale were expected at Holyrood Palace, and a grand reception was planned with regal pomp and ceremony. Troops stood ready for a possible royal salute, hoping for 'Queen's weather' to grace the occasion.|"['1.

I am a firm believer in the Free Kirk, a branch of Presbyterianism that values freedom and independence. The word 'free' appeals to me as a citizen of a republic. My interest in this denomination was sparked by a young Edinburgh minister known as the Friar, who captivated me with his eloquence and passion for the principles of the Free Church. The movement for the Free Church was born out of a desire to abolish the patronage of livings, which allowed certain individuals to appoint ministers without consulting the congregation. This resonated with me as a believer in individual freedom. The Friar vividly described the historic events that led to the formation of the Free Church, highlighting the sacrifices made by ministers who stood up for their beliefs. Inspired by his words, I am proud to align myself with the principles of the Free Church and am eager to contribute to its community.|['1.

Religion in Edinburgh encompasses various forms - a theory, a tradition, a trend, a feeling, a belief, an inclination, a pastime, a familiar habit, and everything in between that resonates with the human spirit. The scene in the square below prompted curiosity. A peaceful crowd moved in an orderly manner towards a church, while another multitude streamed out from St. Knox's. A church service in the evening revealed a surprising turnout, with attendees packing the streets. Despite the late arrival, only a few seats remained, leading to an unexpected seating arrangement for Francesca. Her proximity to Reverend Ronald Macdonald sparked amusement as she found herself in an awkward yet humorous situation. The congregation's attentive demeanor during the service, marked by a rhythmic engagement with the Bible, showcased their intellectual focus and reverence. The sermon, though structured conventionally, drew keen scrutiny from the audience, hinting at a scholarly approach to religious discourse. The prayers, comprising various elements like petitions and confessions, were observed with a sense of solemnity and tradition, underscoring the congregation's devout nature.|"['1.

The pipe organ is quickly becoming popular in Scottish churches, but some still prefer the simplicity of acapella hymns. The unaccompanied singing of hymns has a special solemnity that deeply moves me. The thunderous sound of the organ and the angelic voices of the choir can elevate one's spirit during church music. The offertory is a quiet time without music, allowing for reflection on giving. Country ministers have keen hearing to estimate the collection. The clinking of coins in the contribution boxes is a unique sound. Bonnet fashion can indicate social status in church congregations. Military services are held at St. Giles', with soldiers marching to the church of their choice. The sound of soldiers marching to 'Abide with Me' is majestic and inspiring. The spirit of the church militant is evoked through hymns and prayers, emphasizing aspiration and forgiveness.|"['1.

During the time of Assemblies, the atmosphere is mostly clerical and ecclesiastical. The two main church groups here hide any rivalries and jealousy, if they have any. The Church of the Disruption and the Church of the Secession have been spending time together, hinting at a future union. It's hard to believe that in earlier times in Edinburgh, people faced severe penalties for seemingly minor offenses. For instance, Margaret Sinclair was reprimanded for fetching water on the Sabbath, and Janet Merling had to repent publicly for hiding an unbaptized child named Janet in her home for twenty weeks. Times have changed though, as shown by the rapid acceptance of Mrs. Siddons, a famous actress, by the Church Assembly. Scottish hospitality shines through with numerous invitations flooding in as the city fills with ministers. Miss Jean Dalziel, a lively personality, advises attending various events to experience both the religious and secular sides of Edinburgh's society.|"['1.

Francesca surprised us by declining to attend the semi-royal Scottish court. She preferred not to face the crowds and the Reverend Ronald that evening. Lady Baird was to guide us, and her nephew, Sir Robert, was to accompany us. I mentioned to Sally that Francesca's strong feelings towards the Reverend Ronald might lead to something more. We often strolled through the Old Town, visualizing its historical landmarks. The narrow streets were once filled with debris thrown from upper windows. King James VI even wrote to ensure everything was in order for his wife's arrival. The Old Town's wynds and closes were home to nobility and senators, making it the Court End. The Canongate housed many distinguished figures, providing rich material for Mally Lee's tales.|"[""1.

In the historic Canongate, many admirers would turn to catch a glimpse of the charming Mally Lee. The streets were alive with courtship as everyone sought Mally's favor. Memories abound in every corner of Edinburgh, where grand ladies like the Countess of Eglinton once graced the Stamp Office Close. The old assembly rooms hosted elegant affairs, overseen by society doyenne Miss Nicky Murray. The evening air was filled with excitement as Salemina and her companion journeyed to Holyrood, passing landmarks like the Black Turnpike.

After the presentation, we strolled through the grand rooms, leaning out of the windows to listen to the band playing below, admiring the royal portraits, and chatting with friends. Lady Baird then summoned us to join a distinguished group who had dined at the palace. We observed as people curtsied before the Lord High Commissioner and the Marchioness. Suddenly, a familiar name was announced, 'Lord Colquhoun,' followed by 'Miss Rowena Colquhoun,' and then 'Miss Francesca Van Buren Monroe.' Francesca, a beauty in white satin and pearls, gracefully crossed the room. The Reverend Ronald, impressed by her elegance, remarked on her republican views but acknowledged her beauty. Francesca, escorted by Lord Colquhoun, joined our group, having accepted a last-minute invitation to Holyrood.

Mr. Macdonald, at ease, stirred the fire, causing Francesca to tease him. He lamented their departure, praising their impact on Edinburgh. The conversation turned to Scottish history and sentiment, with tears shed over the Bonnie Prince's story.

Salemina recounted how a friend spent time in France and returned to America with a Parisian flair in her dress, manner, and speech. The discussion then shifted to the allure of Italy versus the spiritual captivation of Scotland, with battles like Falkirk and Flodden weaving a spell over the imagination. The Stuart charm and Bonnie Prince Charlie were noted as powerful influences, with old Scottish matrons singing songs for the lost cause. The conversation touched on the loyalty of Jacobite ladies and a prayer for both King George III and Charles Edward during a tumultuous time. The Dominie shared a prayer from St. Cuthbert's and reflected on Culloden's significance, where the star of the Stuarts faded.

Salemina assured him that they were well-prepared for their upcoming move in terms of packing. However, she expressed that they were not quite mentally ready. Miss Hamilton had written a farewell poem, which she was willing to recite upon request. The young person exclaimed that they had already heard the poem several times that morning. The poem aimed to infuse Scottish elements by altering the language, such as removing final letters and changing certain endings. This was believed to add charm and character to the verses. The poem included a list of Scottish references like thistle, tartan, and haggis to create a unique atmosphere. Despite Salemina and Francesca's attempts, Penelope's poem stood out and won a prize for incorporating Scottish elements creatively. Penelope even used a Scottish plaid pencil to write the verses, which added to the authenticity of the piece.|"['1.

I love the people of the North, the Southerners too. The cheery folks of the West, and those from Paisley. The clever ones from Fife are dear, so dear to me, that just the thought of parting breaks my heart in two. So bring me tartans, heather, scones, and dye my hair red; I'd dress like the unconquered Scots who fought with Wallace. Strap my sword to my side, bring my kilt and cap; while Scottish tunes play in my ears, McKinley is not my king, for Charlie, the bonnie Stuart Prince, has made me a Jacobite. I'd wear the white cockade for him, and sometimes, I'll fight! And sometimes, I'll fight for all that's Scottish, except whisky and oatmeal, for with their songs in my blood, no Scot could be more loyal!|['1.

“We drove to the Pettybaw Inn and Posting Establishment. After dismissing the driver, we had a few hours of daylight left. We enjoyed a cup of tea before searching for lodgings. Despite the scarcity of apartments, we explored the village. The sun shone brightly, enhancing the beauty of Pettybaw. The blue sea sparkled, and the church spire stood out among the green trees. We were captivated by the scenery, even though we faced rejections while seeking shelter. Eventually, we decided to return to the inn for the night. While strolling, we noticed a sign in a draper's window advertising a house and garden for rent. Intrigued, we inquired within and were pleasantly surprised by the cozy cottage. The draper explained that the charming garden and unique features of the house made it appealing to tenants. We were enchanted by the quaint details, like the stone floor and the historical carvings on the lintel, and decided to make it our temporary home.”|"['1.

While enjoying a hearty dinner of Scotch broth, fried haddies, mutton-chops, and rhubarb tart, Salemina and I made plans for our new home in Pettybaw. We decided to rent the draper's house and named it Bide-a-Wee Cottage. Our business discussions lasted late into the evening as we telegraphed for help and arranged meals at the Pettybaw Inn. Salemina expressed her concerns about Willie Beresford's place of residence, wanting him nearby. I reassured her that Pettybaw was the perfect spot. Excited about our new life, we envisioned our stone-floored kitchen, the box-bed for Jane Grieve, and our garden with 'neeps' and marrows. As we gazed at the stars, we felt intoxicated by the fresh air of Pettybaw, knowing it would soon be our perfect home.|"[""1.

The following day was both joyful and exhausting. Salemina and I rearranged every piece of furniture in our small cottage, debating over the ideal placement. We stored away the unattractive ornaments and replaced them with our own lovely decorations. The sitting-room contained only two pictures, one depicting a peculiar scene of a Fireman's Life, and the other showing Burns being called from the plough by the Spirit of Poetry. We beautified the rooms with flowers and potted plants, assigned bedrooms, and shopped for household items. We were kept busy and content, eagerly awaiting Francesca's arrival. Upon her arrival, we welcomed her warmly, proud of our cozy new home. Francesca was pleased with everything, from the quaint village to the antique 'tirling-pin' on our door. We received letters from Edinburgh, including one from Willie, expressing his desire for us to settle in Fifeshire. He mentioned a visit to Rowardennan Castle, where we might meet his friend Robin Anstruther.|"['1.

Francesca assured Salemina that everything would be fine, especially since they were Americans and could be forgiven for any unconventional behavior. She mentioned that being considered artists like Miss Hamilton could excuse any social missteps. Salemina tried to reassure Francesca about their cottage choice in Pettybaw, highlighting its comfort and affordability compared to other options in the area. Francesca expressed frustration about their proximity to Inchcaldy and encountering Mr. Macdonald, but Salemina proposed avoiding any contact with him. Despite initial concerns, Francesca decided not to worry too much about the situation.

In times of joy, Salemina, Francesca, and I sometimes have our small disagreements, but in times of trouble, we are united. A wise Providence sent us Jane Grieve to keep us from being too happy in Pettybaw. Plans from above for the guidance of human beings are always effective, and this was no different. We had arranged for a carriage from the inn to bring her, and when it arrived, we expected to see the rosy little Jane we had imagined. Instead, an elderly lady in worn black attire, carrying a tin cake-box and a baby's bath-tub, introduced herself as Miss Grieve. She was too old to call by her first name, too delicate to address by her last name, so Miss Grieve she remained. Francesca and I burst into laughter while Salemina led her inside. We may have to make adjustments for Miss Grieve, but we will face this challenge together.|"['1.

Walk up the stream to Habbie's Howe, where all the joys of spring and summer flourish. Between two birch trees, over a small waterfall, the water falls with a gentle noise. A deep pool, crystal clear, kisses the grass gently. To get there, turn from the inn, passing a cottage where a lady offers two rooms for rent. Moving ahead, you'll see the house where Mary, Will'am Beattie's sister, passed away. Then, a cottage with a lady in a widow's cap enjoying tea in the bay window. Further down, you'll find the Disagreeable Woman's house. Across the road, a gate leads to a path bordered by a stone wall and a ploughed field. Despite our curiosity, we hesitated to open the gate until two women approached. We asked about the path, but received no clear answer. The next day, we couldn't resist and entered the enchanting path, admiring the beauty of the pasture and the farmstead ahead.|"[""1.

We left the peaceful pasture, breathing in the sweet scent of hawthorn buds, and watched as cows grazed gently. A man in corduroy breeches tended to the land. Suddenly, a woman appeared, asking an unexpected question. We hurried away, avoiding her gaze. As we walked, we overheard children building a castle with stones, each playing a role in their imaginative game. The boys led the construction, while the little girl, known as the Wrig, sat nearby. Despite her forgetfulness in the play, she added charm to the scene with her innocent presence.

After ten minutes of hard work, we made a more nautical craft with a deck and makeshift sails. We placed the ship cleverly, using trees as topmasts. A fierce storm hit, and we acted out the ship sinking. ""Splendid! Grand!"" cried Sir Patrick as he gave directions to the other Scots lords. We rebuilt the ship and started the play again.

We tied the pony and got off: Willie gathered pink veronica and blue speedwell, while I sat on an old bench, enjoying the peaceful moment. The scent of 'white-blossomed slaes' filled the air, and the hills were vibrant with golden whin and broom, or flushed with the purply-red of the bell heather. We heard the cushats' call from a nearby bush. A hedgehog cautiously moved along the ground, curling up at the slightest noise. Women worked in the fields nearby, a common sight here. An elderly man joined me on the bench, sharing his lonely life story. As we reached the fishing village, we met a strong fishwife. We climbed a cliff to gaze at the sea, where rock birds nested.

The women in these villages held significant roles, managing households and finances. After a delightful morning, we enjoyed lunch by a rock with friends.

Alexander always sits on a 'creepie,' holding his plate with one hand and eating with the other, whether it's fish, porridge, or broth. The family's dogs eagerly wait for any food that may fall. Mrs. Phin, a toothless old lady, sometimes misplaces her false teeth, believing they might be in the rice. The kirkyard where Rab, the family dog, will be buried is a peaceful place with ancient tombstones. Nearby, Mrs. Bruce, the butcher, has a unique ship figurehead in her front yard. The figurehead was intended for a ship called the Sea Queen but was never used. Mrs. Bruce believes that the figurehead attracts customers to her shop. Across the street, an elderly woman spends her days playing with dolls and reading the family Bible.|"[""1.

Mrs. Nicolson runs the bakery like a true master, embodying the essence of the establishment. While her husband, known as the baker, works below the shop, Mrs. Nicolson is the face of the bakery. The kitchen, with its gleaming copper and snowy floors, showcases her skills as a housewife. However, it's behind the counter where her shrewd and masterful character shines. When a customer, Miss Grieve, seeks to buy a quarter section of ginger-cake, Mrs. Nicolson explains the intricacies of selling such a delicacy.

The scones at the castle tea-table are described as incredibly light, possibly weighing only four or five to a pound. Salemina likens them to an unsuccessful soda-biscuit from New England. Stevenson, on the other hand, speaks of the dense black Scotch bun, claiming that the patriotism of a Scotsman who eats it will never waver. Salemina humorously suggests that the scone should be paired with the bun, though not in the stomach. The castle's hospitality charms visitors, despite the cracked cups and small room for tea gatherings. Miss Grieve, the slow-moving but essential caretaker, ensures thin bread and butter slices. The garden, with its domestic charm, becomes a retreat for reading and quiet chats.

Willie swiftly climbed the ladder placed against the peach vine-covered wall, followed by the narrator who sat on top. Mr. Anstruther then removed the ladder to the other side. Miss Grieve, in a neat attire, served tea but blamed the poor quality of fuel for the cool tea. Laughter echoed as she left. Lady Ardmore found the rescue unique and claimed to understand America better. The ladies from Pettybaw House found the event very Fife-like, known for eccentricity.

Miss Ardmore shared an interesting story about recognizing an American lady by her accent at a chemist's shop. The lady had been in the country for twenty years but still spoke with an American accent. Francesca, a character in the story, then goes on to recount her interactions with Mr. Macdonald, who is portrayed as opinionated but not a fool. Francesca expresses her frustration with Scotland's obsession with its ancient history and how age should sometimes be concealed. She also humorously reflects on her struggle to come up with examples of things that do not improve with age, comparing it to a game where one must quickly name a beast, bird, or fish.

All these intricate, deep feelings intertwined in a dance of raised eyebrows, curved lips, and trembling chins, blending like fire and snow, captivating the observer! The rain poured heavily; Salemina was mending socks by the fireplace at Bide-a-Wee Cottage, while I read her a humorous letter about Scotland that Francesca and I had composed the night before. We aimed to send it to some folks back home who teased us about our love for Scotland. The letter contained little new information, mostly fabricated, as we had a limited vocabulary and had to occasionally refer to Burns and Allan Ramsay for help. Many times I tried to write to you, but something always got in the way. It wasn't that I couldn't be bothered, for I often thought of you, and my heart has been with you for many days. There aren't many folks from America around here; they're all just Fife locals, and a girl can't get her tongue around their thick accents, so it's like I might as well give up on my Scottish tongue.

"My second reason for being comfortably indifferent is that in many stories, especially in plays, the main character, usually a woman, is often made to feel intensely jealous by false suggestions made by the villain of the story. This scenario is so overused in modern dramas that it no longer seems believable to me. However, Francesca, despite having seen numerous plays and read many novels, did not find it plausible that Lady Ardmore's daughter could be in love with Mr. Macdonald. This change in perspective had a positive impact overall. Francesca had always thought of herself as the central figure in Reverend Ronald's world, and her behavior towards him was often impudent, as was his towards her. However, this criticism only pertains to their public interactions, and I have a feeling that their private conversations are much more amicable. When Francesca considered the possibility that Mr. Macdonald might just be engaging in intellectual banter with her, while his heart had found solace elsewhere, she softened unknowingly. The dynamics between the Scotsman and the American shifted to a more realistic view, and the man and the woman found themselves drawing dangerously close to each other.
