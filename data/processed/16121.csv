"While organizing the books, one titled Taylor's Sermons caught my eye. I decided to keep it out to preach a real sermon from it after the prayers. I had to do the responses, sing hymns, and even do the ""Dearly beloved brethren"" part. I used a chair full of newspapers as a makeshift pulpit and started looking for a sermon to preach. The book was old, bound in brown leather, with a picture of a man in a black gown. I chose a sermon titled ""A Funeral Sermon, preached at the Obsequies of the Right Honourable the Countess of Carbery."" The text was challenging, and the sermon was difficult to preach with all the Latin mixed in it. As I struggled through, I accidentally dropped the book, waking up Godfather Gilpin. He kindly reassured me that the book was fine, but I was too upset to continue. Instead, I picked up another book and pretended to read, eventually coming across a picture of two men in black cloaks carrying a man covered in a blue quilt, labeled ""Fratelli della Misericordia"" or ""Brothers of Pity."" Godfather Gilpin explained that they were a group of men who provide mercy and compassion to the sick, dying, and dead without seeking recognition. The image of the masked men stayed with me long after I returned the books to their shelf."|"[""1.

When I was younger, I often changed my mind about what I wanted to be when I grew up. Sometimes I dreamed of being a brave officer, other times a wise clergyman, and even a daring fireman. But one day, I learned about the Brothers of Pity who did good deeds without expecting anything in return. This inspired me, and I decided to become a Brother of Pity myself. I made a cloak and a mask, and with my trusty spade, I set out to bury animals that had no one to mourn them. I found birds, mice, frogs, and even a mole. One day, I thought a beetle was dead, but it tricked me by pretending to be lifeless. Despite the challenges, my summer as a Brother of Pity was the happiest I had ever experienced.|"['1.

"In the fields and woods, I found many little graves. I knew whose they were, but it was fun to pretend to be a stranger and talk to myself. I'd say, ""Where you see these graves, a poor creature was buried by the Brothers of Pity."" I didn't read the burial service, especially for frogs, but I'd say, ""Let's do this work of mercy,"" and ""Go in peace."" I'd bury birds and beasts without friends, touching my hat when passing their graves. One day I found a dead robin-redbreast. I loved robins and wanted to bury one. As I went to get my things, a beetle landed on the robin. I promised them to be Brothers of Pity.

It was a beautiful night as I walked, thinking about moving Robin's body to softer ground. Surprisingly, when I reached the quarry, Robin was already in the spot I had in mind for his burial. I couldn't believe my eyes, and as I watched, his body started sinking into the ground. At first, I hoped he was alive, but it became clear someone was burying him. Frightened, I ran home, leaving behind the burial preparations. The next day, I confided in Godfather Gilpin, who explained that burying beetles had likely moved Robin's body.

"Diggory, the gravedigger, is a quiet man whom I enjoy observing. He seems hard of hearing because when I asked him if he believed he could dig through to the other side of the world, he just replied with a puzzled ""Hey?"" and continued digging. Sometimes, I think of sexton beetles when he throws up the earth. They bury their prey by driving straight down and then tossing the earth up with a sharp jerk. Once, Diggory heard me and peeked out of the grave, looking puzzled and calling me an unusual young gentleman. I was afraid he was upset, so I didn't ask any more questions.

He leaped to his feet, but she had placed the bonfire between them. Before he could circle around, she was on the opposite side of a tilted cart where another lady, in a crimson cloak, was working on a dirty pack of cards. I never encountered my cousins again, and it was a while before I met more gipsies. That day's incident impacted me greatly, influencing the careful selection of our summer and winter retreats. That summer, when I turned seven, we had the most delightful home in a wood, far from houses and busy roads. Bounded by a brook and a lush pasture field, the setting was serene. The fields were abundant and refreshing, offering juicy crabs under a tree and beetles and lob-worms in the evening dew. The area was teeming with life, but also hidden and safe, providing a sense of security and charm.|"['1.

Once upon a time, I shared with them a tale about a hedgehog and a hare racing for a prize. The clever hedgehog tricked the hare by positioning himself and Mrs. Hedgehog at opposite ends of the course. While the hare raced to one side, the hedgehog took a few steps and returned to his spot. Mrs. Hedgehog then called out from the other side, fooling the hare. The moral of the story is that one must use both wit and speed in life. The hare tried multiple times, but the hedgehog always won. In the end, the hare conceded, and the ancestors went home with the prize.

"Mrs. Hedgehog was very curious. She thought the children were tough enough for anything, so she sent them to pick snails and sneaked towards the tinker's camp.

I looked and saw Sybil, looking thin but unmistakable. The old woman noticed and yelled, ""Begone!"" Sybil explained she came to see her sick mother. The old woman recognized her as ""The Terror of the Roads"" but spoke softly. Sybil knelt and spoke quietly to the old woman. Mrs. Hedgehog and I strained to hear but couldn't.

"On a day long ago, my uncle Draen y Coed, a wise Welsh hedgehog, shared a saying that stuck with me: ""We are all creatures of habit."" This reminded me of a tale about an ancestor who changed habits drastically, opting for the warmth of a kitchen fire over evening walks. It's fascinating how even the quietest folks can suddenly embrace excitement and adventure, leaving behind their usual routines. Curiosity, a trait of many, led us to welcome new neighbors despite our initial reservations. Change can be unexpected and complete, like when familiar faces become wanderers. I recall a time when a simple chat with a cousin felt like a burden, yet now, thoughts of meeting new acquaintances fill my mind. One day, as we headed to our usual spot, unfamiliar voices interrupted our journey, signaling the start of something new and exciting."|['1.

"For heaven's sake, don't cry. Christian was a truly kind person, an excellent person. I never expected to get along so well with someone who wasn't really a gipsy. I don't blame him for standing up against being mistreated about his parents. I only blame myself for not taking better care of him. But you know that already - you know it's because I can't forgive myself for handling things poorly when you entrusted him to me, that I am supporting you on this crazy journey, even though I don't agree with it at all, and though I know John will criticize me severely. When it comes to Mrs. Hedgehog's gender, we have to let the dear creatures have their way. She pushed her nose through the lower branches of an arbutus where we were hidden, and I managed to get a closer look at our new neighbors. As we moved forward, the clergywoman stood up from kneeling among the flowers and placed her hand on the young man's arm. I noticed it because I had never seen such a pale hand before; Sybil's paws were almost as dark as mine. ""John won't blame anyone if we find Christian,"" she said.

Night after night, I lay awake thinking about what to say when we meet. I understand if Christian longs for the outdoors and moving around. Maybe I was wrong to take him from his people, but we can make the best of it. If Christian loves to roam, I can provide for him to travel far and wide, experiencing new places. He could become a famous traveler, exploring hundreds of miles. I've thought about this a lot and wished to share it with you. If you won't let me help, spare me the hope of seeing him again.

I always focus on the present and don't dwell on past events. Raising seven children isn't common for hedgehogs, and I vividly remember each of their paths. I can't fathom why the Fox mistook my son for a pheasant's egg and rolled him into the stream. Luckily, my eldest daughter settled well, but her children were taken by Irish boys. They were fed and cared for but later stuffed as trophies. After my daughter's release, she praised the boys. The rest of my children barely survived after overeating snails, needing care from Mrs. Hedgehog. I kept an eye on our neighbors to share updates. I recall a cat named Toots, unsure of the name's origin. Toots once mistook the word for cream, leading to a larder adventure for a dish of thick yellow cream.|"[""1.

"It was a delightful meal, but as I ate, I started to feel full and wished I had more space for the remaining food. Despite feeling satisfied, I couldn't bear to waste any.

The fowls in the backyard were undisturbed by the scorching heat, enjoying their siesta. Among them were a cock and four hens, two of which had tufts of feathers on their heads, making them famous in the village. The proud cock, with his distinguished-looking wives, had a splendid appearance with a blackish-green tail and a golden speckled hackle. He had won battles against rival cocks curious about his foreign wives, establishing his dominance. As the farmer's men threshed in a nearby barn, disrupting their sleep, the hens wished for a story. The common hens teased the foreign ones, leading to a storytelling session. The cock eventually told a tale about the fowls outsmarting the cook to avoid being cooked, leaving her in a fit of hysterics.|"['1.

After a long journey, the group of wanderers reached a vast, desolate heath with an old, abandoned house at its center. Flaps, one of the group, scoured the house from top to bottom but found no signs of life. The fowls, after inspecting the area for two days, decided to make the house their home. They fortified it, naming it Hencastle, and stored grain for the winter. Living peacefully, the fowls encountered a dilemma when mice began stealing their food. Despite efforts to oust the mice, they multiplied and posed a significant threat. Seeking refuge in a rocky mountainside, the fowls encountered a mysterious owl in the night, signaling potential new challenges ahead.|['1.

Upon hearing this, the roosters nudged each other and thought, 'Finally, luck is on our side.' As the owl kept calling for mice, one rooster gathered courage and said, 'Come with us, sir. You can have all the mice you want, a whole house full.' Everything went smoothly at first, but the mice soon realized the owl's vision was best at night or poorly during the day. So, they only emerged at noon, taking enough corn to last till the next day. One night, the owl, hungry, turned to eating hen's eggs instead of mice, finding them tastier and easier to catch. The fowls, aware of this, sent the roosters to chase the owl away. The owl threatened, but the old dog Flaps defended the castle by killing the owl, losing an eye in the process. The mice continued to increase, prompting the roosters to seek help. They found a fox in the woods who gladly agreed to help, as long as he swore not to eat eggs. The fox joined the castle, won everyone's trust, and swiftly caught mice, becoming their friend in need.|"[""1.

Late at night, Reynard sneaked to where the birds slept. He decapitated a couple of young and plump fowls before tossing them out the window. He then rushed back, locking the door behind him. Reynard deceitfully claimed a dog had entered and killed the chickens. Flaps, the dog, overheard and attacked Reynard, losing an ear in the scuffle. The fowls, realizing their mistake, apologized to Flaps and celebrated their freedom. However, a new problem arose with the mice stealing corn and possibly eggs.

The messengers found a grimy gipsy near a village, frustrated about not selling his mouse-traps. They proposed a deal to him, which he accepted, and they all headed to Hencastle. The gipsy, using bacon as bait, caught many mice. When the bacon ran out, he caught a chicken, causing chaos among the hens. The gipsy then roasted the chicken. When the dog, Flaps, tried to stop him, the gipsy struck the dog and fled. The villagers, finding the gipsy had tricked them, attacked him. The gipsy escaped, leaving the village. Flaps led his group away, unable to find a new home. The hens criticized Flaps for leaving too soon. Ultimately, the old hen believed Flaps was not a suitable protector due to his injuries.|['1.

The main rooster was not as open with his thoughts as the lead hen, but he grumbled and complained about everything, creating unpleasant situations without taking a stand or responsibility. Another hen chose to remain neutral, claiming she had no opinions. She trusted everyone equally, endured her fair share of suffering without complaint, and always offered good wishes to others. Meanwhile, Flaps, feeling burdened by the Helpless fowls' reliance on him, realized they tended to shift their problems onto the Helpful ones. As conditions worsened, the hens lacked food, and Flaps received no eggs. One rainy evening, the fowls sought shelter in a walnut tree, while Flaps fell asleep at the base. The hens criticized his indifference, longing for the care they received back at Hencastle. Despite the challenges, Flaps promised to find them a better home, leaving in search of a solution as the rain subsided and dawn broke.|['1.

The chief cock cleared his throat and addressed the group with modesty. Urging everyone to gather the young ones, he suggested a visit to Mr. Flaps' farmyard. The chief cock, known for his common sense, endorsed Mr. Flaps' advice. He expressed concern over the family undervaluing Mr. Flaps and even comparing him to a past impostor. Asserting his authority, the chief cock declared the visit to the farmyard. The group set off, arriving before sunrise. At the farmyard, Flaps settled the group but felt hungry. Approaching the farmhouse for scraps, he encountered the farmer's daughter, Daisy. Despite the farmer's warning of a lurking threat, Daisy welcomed Flaps warmly, sharing her bread-and-milk with him.

My time in the Glass Pond taught me a valuable lesson about the differences between those who live in water and those who don't. The story involves Francis, Molly, and their grandfather, the Doctor, who are curious about life beyond the pond. Fish, like the minnow, struggle to understand life on dry land just as much as we struggle to imagine life underwater. While fish are stubborn in their beliefs, humans are more open-minded. The Doctor, with his limited senses, pities his lack of underwater experiences. He admires creatures like the Great Water-Beetle, which thrive both in water and air. I, on the other hand, enjoy the thrill of hunting and being hunted underwater, surrounded by the beauty of the pond's ecosystem. Molly and the boy, busy with their tasks, enjoy the sunny day by the pond, where various creatures, like the water-scorpion and water-gnats, go about their lives under the warm sun.|['1.

Francis and Molly were setting up a fresh-water aquarium. Francis wanted to stock it his way, while Molly found a scarlet water-spider she wanted to keep separately. The aquarium had gravel, water plants, and even a dragon-fly larva. Molly carefully arranged the pond, creating a habitat for the creatures. They transferred the creatures from jars to the glass pond, where the dragon-fly larva started feeding on May-fly grubs. Francis later added minnows, a small carp, and a bull's-head to the aquarium. Despite some initial chaos, the creatures settled in their new home, creating a mini ecosystem in the glass pond.|"['1.

On the third day, while soaking gutta-percha tubing in hot water with a dragon-fly larva, a minnow, and a water-scorpion, an unexpected visit from Master Edward Brown led to a mishap. The tubing melted, and a carp perished unnoticed. The next day, the glass pond was relocated to the conservatory, causing the water to stagnate. Despite the decay, I found solace sitting on exposed rockwork above the water. At night, I would fly around the drawing-room attracted by the lights until one evening, I mistakenly landed on the floor. The family grew accustomed to the sound of my falls. By the fifth day, the pond's inhabitants dwindled, leaving only the dragon-fly larva and me. We overate, and as hunger set in, we eyed each other warily. On the sixth day, with dwindling food supply, I contemplated consuming the scarlet spider. Despite my reluctance due to Molly's memory, I eventually devoured it.|"['1.

When I was a child, my brother and I believed in a mysterious being called Shriny who we thought lived among old, decaying stakes by the sea. These ruins, remnants of a pier, were our playground at low tide. We would pretend to visit our imaginary friend in her underwater palace. Although memories of Shriny are now faint, we used to play and feast with her in our childish fantasies. While we never saw Shriny like Jack Dogherty saw the Merrow, a sea creature with a green body and a cocked hat, we did encounter similar creatures at the Crystal Palace Aquarium. The paths to fairyland may be overgrown, but the wonders of Mother Nature's realm, like the Merrows in the aquarium, continue to captivate us.|"['1.

Mr. Croker's artistic talent in depicting Coomara the Merrow, despite never encountering sea creatures like crayfish, lobsters, or prawns, showcases his genius. These sea creatures, in their natural habitat, boast vibrant shades of blue and purple, contrasting starkly with the bright scarlet they turn when boiled. The prawns, usually colorless and transparent, are strangely beautiful in their original setting. The Great Aquarium offers a glimpse into their world, akin to a visit to the bottom of the sea. Within the Aquarium, a sea-pool teems with sea-anemones, showcasing various species. In another tank, tube-worms known as _Serpulæ_ dwell, creating chalky tubes reminiscent of chimney-sweeps with colorful plumes.

"Have you ever seen a ""sea-mouse"" preserved in a bottle? It resembles a mouse in size and body shape but without legs, adorned with rainbow-colored hairs. Surprisingly, it is classified among worms. In the Great Aquarium, there is a sea-mouse, possibly hiding in tanks 21 or 25. While some sea creatures like swimming-crabs and sea-scorpions may hide from visitors due to being night-feeders, they are safe from interference behind glass walls. Tank 5 features swimming-crabs and sea-scorpions, with the former known as the largest and hungriest English crabs. Tank 4 houses big spider-crabs that sit uniquely with their knees above their heads. It's interesting to note how our perception of cod is mainly culinary, overlooking its true nature."|['1.

Fishes are like the Chinese in many ways, being slow, watchful, and sometimes humorous. In the Great Aquarium, the cod are so interested in observing us through the glass as we are in watching them. They are quite tame and always hungry, making it difficult for other fish like plaice, soles, brill, turbot, and skate to eat peacefully. The skate fish love burying themselves in the sand, only revealing their presence through subtle movements. A curious little sole once tried climbing rocks to reach crusty crabs but failed. The sea creatures in Tanks 1, 2, and 3 evoke curiosity and admiration, with sea-flowers and worms being simpler beings. While fish can establish a connection through eye contact, crustaceans like crabs and lobsters remain enigmatic with their mysterious intelligence and inscrutable thoughts.|['1.

In the aquarium, there are different tanks with various sea creatures. One notable inhabitant is Coomara, who resembles a lobster or a crustacean with his green hair.

The Wrasses in tanks 10 to 13 are colorful and beautiful to observe. Tank 32 is specifically designed to showcase them. Eels in tank 15 can adapt to living in both fresh and saltwater.

The idea of prawns may seem absurd until you see them in real life at the Great Aquarium. A warlike group of prawns gathered on a table-rock, their spear-like antennae moving restlessly under a ray of light, creating a striking image. The hermit-crabs, despite their name, are actually gentle creatures who search for shells to wear. They are picky about their shells, trying them on like a lady choosing a bonnet. Blennies, small fish, are friendly and can even be tamed. One pet blenny was sensitive to music, reacting to vibrations from stringed instruments. Dragonets and star-fish in Tank 35 show interesting interactions, like a dragonet snapping at a star-fish. The aquarium's temporary arrangements cater to the creatures' needs due to their varying behaviors. The tanks lack vegetation intentionally, relying on natural growth from seeds in the seawater. The Public Aquarium is a testament to scientific skill and dedication, providing a unique educational experience for visitors.|"['1.

Let us hope that this Great Aquarium stirs up sight-seers to become naturalists and encourages naturalists to deepen our friendship with sea creatures. The challenges are evident as we cannot yet keep deep-sea Merrows in tanks, only shore-dwellers. Transporting marine life remains difficult. However, the wonders of aquariums are indeed remarkable. A larger one in Brighton holds even more marvels, including a baby alligator. A new aquarium in Manchester is also in the works. The love of nature is ingrained in the British, with holidays often spent in the countryside. A young German naturalist, Dr. Dohrn, is building a significant aquarium in Naples, funding most of it himself. The facility will support marine research and offer opportunities for scientists to study sea life.|['1.

Sitting in my Ivy Bush on a calm night, the moonlight reminds me of her hair. I imagine her face close to mine, as we blinked at each other that day. She tried to coax me from my ivy bush to live on the nursery clock, but in my rage, I missed and forgot much of what she said. Miss, disappointed that the owl I brought won't be tamed, wanted him for the nursery clock. But the owl, loved very much, wants to remain wild. The coachman suggested stuffing the owl, but Miss pleaded against it. She asked for Tom to come to her, hoping to persuade him not to stuff the owl.

He quietly left the room, closing the door gently behind him. Then, he swiftly changed into his fancy green coat and matching hat, going out to show off his outfit to the Brown family and then to everyone else. The letter writer mentions a missed opportunity for a high position on top of a clock and compares it to a bird that chose to live in a kitchen instead of a drawing-room. The bird, named Slyboots, made the kitchen its home, despite the smoky environment. Slyboots spent time watching the cook and sneaking food. Sadly, Slyboots passed away due to overeating, leaving behind a tidily hidden meal. The writer, a soldier, desires literary recognition and asks for a moral to be added to Slyboots' story for publication.|"['1.
