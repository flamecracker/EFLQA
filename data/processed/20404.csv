Throughout the year, new flowers bloom, revealing the strength of life over death. In our hearts lie seeds of love and faith. Sun and rain, please nurture them. The harsh wind steals the violets' sweetness along the cruel streets. Cold kindness blights our hearts. But with warmth, the violets bloom again, showing their joy to live. We long for love, hoping our hearts would burst to prove our happiness. Dreams of footsteps, restless spirits, whispers of violets, and the music of the woods fill our sleep. The world changes before us. Spring brings fulfillment, urging us to reap its promises. The days pass without a hand on the cottage door, watching the seasons change. The children weave daisy chains, the woodland music plays sweetly. Come, my beloved, let's walk among the green woods and fields. The blackbirds sing, the cuckoo calls, the nightingale is in love, but not as much as I am. Rain, moonshine, and the scent of earth bring memories. The beauty of Kentish wood calls us to breathe God's blessed air. The yellow cornfields, the hops, the laughter, and honest toil await us. Under the dark sky, we fly over moors and pools, forgetting the loveliest things we've seen. Yet, the warmth of a hearth and the love on happy faces linger in our memories.
