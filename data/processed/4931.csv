In my introduction to the Lion of the North, I mentioned my desire to continue the history of the Thirty Years' War. The deaths of Gustavus and Wallenstein, along with the defeat of the Swedes at Nordlingen, marked the end of the first phase of the war. Oxenstiern, the Swedish chancellor, realized that France's intervention was crucial for success. He convinced Richelieu that Austria's dominance threatened France. Richelieu agreed to support Sweden and send troops. This marked the beginning of the second phase, with France replacing Sweden as the key player. Led by Conde and Turenne, France emerged victorious, expanding its territories while crushing Austria and Spain. Despite their different approaches, Conde and Turenne worked harmoniously, showcasing their military brilliance. The officer, followed by two orderlies, encountered a group of boys playing at military drills, discussing Turenne's achievements and leadership qualities.|"[""1.

For centuries, France faced challenges from powerful vassals like the families of Lorraine, Bouillon, and Burgundy, who were more like independent princes than loyal subjects. Louis XI and Richelieu worked to consolidate France, but after their deaths, the nobles regained power, leading to civil strife like the Wars of the Fronde. Richelieu also aimed to prevent Austria from dominating Germany, which would threaten France. Turenne, a young soldier, learned the art of war in the Netherlands, where he excelled in battles and sieges. His dedication to duty and discipline earned him respect and promotion.

Recognizing the limited opportunities in Holland, Turenne sought a broader battlefield. His wish was granted, earning a colonelcy in France's army. Diligently, he led his regiment, earning a reputation for discipline. In 1630, he joined an expedition sans combat, truly engaging in 1634 under Marshal de la Force. After the siege of La Motte, his regiment's valor led to his promotion to Marechal de Camp. Turenne partook in sieges until Lorraine's conquest.

Turenne, unable to take immediate action in the field, focused on preparing for the upcoming challenges. When La Valette passed away, many expected Turenne to assume command. However, his brother, the Duc de Bouillon, opposed Richelieu and refused to comply with his commands.

The French army, led by D'Harcourt, anticipated a battle with the Spanish troops who were twice their strength. D'Harcourt decided to advance against the enemy camp at Villanova. The Spanish, taken by surprise, fortified their position instead of engaging in battle. To force them out, D'Harcourt moved towards Chieri, positioning Turenne and the cavalry between Chieri and Villanova. The Spanish did not attempt to relieve Chieri, which surrendered quickly. The French army, lacking provisions, retreated towards Carignano. The Marquis of Leganez seized Poirino, blocking the French retreat. Prince Thomas advanced towards the French, aiming to cut off their escape route. Turenne, with quick thinking, preemptively moved his troops to the bridge, engaging in a successful battle against the Spanish forces led by Prince Thomas, forcing them into retreat towards Turin.|"[""1.

During the battle, d'Harcourt fought against the Marquis of Leganez and gained an advantage. However, not knowing the situation at Santina, he hesitated to move towards the Po. When news arrived that Prince Thomas was defeated, d'Harcourt advanced towards Carignano, aided by Turenne's horse. The horse held off the Spaniards, allowing d'Harcourt to cross the river with his guns and baggage wagons. They then broke the bridge and regrouped at Carignano for winter. Turenne prepared to send provisions to Turin's citadel. Hector and the young Frenchmen learned the importance of following orders and not pursuing enemies recklessly.

Hector had been pondering the proposal to deliver a letter to the garrison of Turin. He discussed it with Paolo and decided that two boys might have a better chance of success than men. Turenne, the general, acknowledged the risk involved in the mission. He warned Hector of the danger of failure and the possibility of being hanged if caught by the enemy. Despite the slim odds of success, Turenne agreed to let them attempt the mission. Hector and Paolo planned to disguise themselves as country boys, cross the Po, and enter the city from the other side. Turenne provided them with a map of the city and fortress to aid their mission. He also gave Hector a hundred crowns for expenses. The boys discussed the importance of not drawing attention to themselves by wearing old clothes.

In just thirty minutes, the officer arrived with a strategy that Hector immediately started studying. The citadel sat on slightly elevated ground compared to the town. It was shaped like a pentagon, constructed in 1565, making it Europe's earliest fortification in this design, considered a masterpiece. Separated from the town by a glacis, a deep fosse ran along the wall's base. The town itself was fortified, stretching to the citadel's base, capable of resisting even after the citadel's capture. Hector carefully examined the town facing the citadel, noting streets extending towards the walls. The poorest quarter was evident from the narrow streets, as the wealthy wouldn't risk exposure to the citadel's fire. Paolo returned with clothing for disguise, including shirts, waistcoats, sashes, and doublets, all lined with sheepskin. Hector approved the attire, ensuring warmth and blending in. The general advised a thin rope and an iron hook for emergencies, and to head to Chivasso with a note for the governor. Hector planned to start the mission soon, carrying a concealed letter for the garrison's commandant.|"[""1.

Turenne expressed his concerns about the dangerous mission Hector was about to undertake. He believed that the side facing the town was a better option due to the strict watch kept by the Spaniards on the other side. Turenne decided to send a troop of cavalry with Hector to Chivasso to protect him from Spanish horse attacks. Hector welcomed the opportunity for the ride and mentioned the restrictions on their movements beyond certain points due to enemy scouting parties. Despite the challenges, they discussed the potential for action in the coming winter and the importance of reinforcements.

Hector and Paolo were making their way towards the market but were unsure of its location. The sun had come out after the snow had stopped, which Hector thought was fortunate as it would melt the snow and make them less visible. Along the road, they met an old man dragging faggots. Paolo offered to buy the faggots so they could sell them in town. The old man agreed, and they set off together, with Paolo suggesting they walk in single file between the poles carrying the faggots. The old man warned them about the value of firewood in a besieged town. Paolo and Hector decided to buy a cooking pan first and then browse shops as if they were on a specific mission. They headed towards the Strada Vecchia to start their exploration.|"['1.

The boys explored the deserted streets, noticing the aftermath of an artillery duel. They strategized on how to break into a house discreetly to avoid detection. Paolo suggested purchasing a saw and a crowbar from different shops to not raise suspicion. After buying supplies and having a meal in the square, they headed to the Strada Vecchia, a quiet street. They cautiously approached a house, trying to open the door without attracting attention. Failing to break the lock, they decided to remove a panel from the door instead.

After replacing the panel, they climbed the stairs. They noticed no lights in the windows, so they proceeded confidently to the attic. Opening a casement with oiled paper for glass, they stepped onto the parapet. Climbing walls between houses, they advanced without their cord, helping each other up. Leaving behind their tools and only carrying a crowbar, they secured their wooden shoes around their necks. The snow had melted during the day, but light flakes began falling again. Hector preferred the snowfall for cover and direction. They took half an hour to reach the end of the street, using a sash and hook for a silent descent.

Hector made a sudden move, grabbing his opponent's wrist, suspecting a hidden dagger. As they struggled, Hector managed to wrap his arm around the man's waist. Despite the soldier's strength, Hector couldn't keep a grip for long. Suddenly, the man collapsed, dropping the dagger. They cautiously crossed the outer wall, descended using a hook, and found a boat by the river. After launching it, they rowed to the opposite shore. Wanting to return the boat, they jogged along the bank to avoid enemy patrols. Discovering a shed with sacks, they stripped, wrung out their frozen clothes, and used the sacks for warmth.

Chavigny explained the benefits of a morning swim in cold water to de Lisle. They laughed about not being able to swim across moats and stay in wet clothes all night. They imagined failing the mission and getting shot by guards. Efforts were made to prepare for a march to Turin with provisions and artillery. Troops attacked the city gates, causing chaos. The attackers breached the gate, allowing carts of supplies to enter the citadel. A fierce fight ensued, and the defenders were outmaneuvered. Prince Thomas attempted a sally, but reinforcements arrived, forcing him to retreat. The French commander, Turenne, orchestrated a diversion to aid the citadel's relief.

Despite facing a larger enemy, the French forces, including Turenne, triumphed and defeated the Spaniards. They then besieged Turin, facing challenges but ultimately repelling the enemy and securing the town. Turenne's strategic maneuvers, even when wounded, helped the French overcome obstacles and deliver provisions to the starving townspeople.

Richelieu convinced the king to stop paying the garrisons at Sedan, leading to a conflict with the Duke of Bouillon, Hector's brother. The cardinal aimed to expand France's borders eastward by conquering Lorraine and strengthening the kingdom. Bouillon's dukedom posed a threat to this plan due to its strategic location.

Rumors suggest a political alliance between Bouillon, Spain, and Austria against France, orchestrated by the Archbishop of Rheims. This move could deter potential allies due to religious differences and the risk of losing lands and titles. Bouillon's decision to involve Spain and Austria may backfire, as it could endanger his dukedom of Sedan unnecessarily. Soissons, having no power to raise forces, risks little by joining Bouillon.

Turenne and his staff journeyed to Perpignan, where he assisted in besieging the fortress. The Spanish attempts to reinforce the garrison failed, and with no relief in sight, the fortress was bound to surrender due to lack of supplies. Turenne maintained a strict watch, isolating the garrison. Meanwhile, the Duke de Bouillon took command in Italy, hoping for peace from family issues. However, intrigues arose involving the king's favourite, Cinq-Mars, and the Duke of Orleans, leading to arrests and executions. Turenne faced a difficult time as his loyalty was tested. Richelieu's passing saw Cardinal Mazarin rise in power. Hector Campbell diligently studied Italian and German, preparing for potential future campaigns in Germany.

After the passing of Cardinal Richelieu, France faced uncertainty as the king's health declined. The Duke of Orleans and the Prince of Conde were potential successors, but both had their flaws. Cardinal Mazarin, recommended by Richelieu, was considered clever but lacked the cardinal's natural leadership. Mazarin's Italian background hinted at a different approach to governance. While Richelieu ruled with an iron fist, Mazarin was expected to navigate political waters through intrigue and alliances. Despite his differences, Mazarin had the queen's support, a powerful advantage. As the king's reign ended, the queen regent took charge, forming a council that included Mazarin. The political landscape shifted, with the queen consolidating power and appointing Turenne to lead the army in Italy. France's future lay in the hands of these new leaders, each bringing their unique strengths and challenges to the table.|"[""1.

The passing of Richelieu has emboldened France's adversaries, with de Malo preparing to invade France from the Low Countries. The young Duc d'Enghien, son of the Prince of Conde, commands the French army, supported by Marshal de l'Hopital. Hector and Paolo now join Enghien's forces en route to Eperney. Hector, almost seventeen, was well-built, with a pleasant face and brown-gold hair. He arrived at Enghien's residence, where the prince warmly welcomed him. Enghien admired Hector's dedication to military studies and expressed a desire to have him by his side. Despite his initial doubts about his own abilities compared to Turenne's merit-based rise, Enghien was eager to lead his troops and learn from Hector's experiences.

Enghien, at twenty-two, had a striking appearance with wide forehead, sunken piercing eyes, and a prominent hooked nose resembling an eagle. While he shared a military genius with Turenne, their characters differed greatly. Turenne was patient and thoughtful, focusing on troop well-being, while Conde was impulsive and ambitious, acting on personal desires. Despite his military prowess, Conde lacked leadership skills and had personal faults. During a joyous supper, Hector experienced a lively atmosphere contrasting Turenne's serious gatherings. General Gassion, a merit-based soldier, supported Enghien's bold approach over the marshal's caution. Gassion encouraged Hector, foreseeing his potential for future success in the military. The young nobles around them sought glory for courtly favor, unlike professional soldiers like Hector and Gassion, who valued dedication and perseverance in military service.|"['1.

No doubt exists about the impending battle at Rocroi. Enghien's impetuosity could lead to disaster, yet his extraordinary ability is acknowledged. The Spanish infantry, under Fuentes, is formidable, while France's forces are newer. Despite equal strength, the marshal may view victory as unlikely. Enghien's potential victory would elevate him, but a defeat would discredit the marshal. The ill king's absence could impact the country's response to defeat. Enghien's victory would prove French soldiers' worth. Hector, aligned with Enghien, anticipates the battle despite l'Hopital's reluctance to engage the Spanish forces.

They advanced cautiously, stopping frequently to listen for any signs of movement. Near the edge of the woods facing the camp, they heard faint sounds of shifting and weapons clashing, indicating guards changing positions.

Mazarin, unlike Richelieu, faces challenges in gaining the trust of France due to his foreign background. While Richelieu earned respect through defeating enemies, Mazarin's success is uncertain. Turenne's camp, known for discipline, contrasts with Enghien's, filled with young nobles. Merit, as seen in Hector Campbell's promotion, can pave the way for success even in unfamiliar territories. Attending court after the victory at Rocroi brings attention and admiration, but Hector remains indifferent towards the attention from courtly ladies. Despite the allure of courtly life, Hector values his comrades and the military camaraderie over the glamour of the court.|"[""1.

"""Ah, you were younger then,"" Home chuckled.

Hector laughed awkwardly. ""I could not take up flippancies, I am afraid.

""It is a very different thing living in Susa to living in Paris,"" Hector laughed. ""I can assure you that I never spent more than half my pay; but living was dearer down in Roussillon.

Madame Chevreuse's gathering mainly includes herself. She is a significant figure, but currently, it's uncertain who she will align with. Previously, she opposed Richelieu, but now she might conspire against Mazarin. The queen, who supported her before, is now believed to favor Mazarin. The situation is chaotic now, but it will soon become clearer. Enghien's victory will strengthen Conde, making things more intriguing. Hector, a newly appointed colonel, avoided meeting the soldiers at the Scottish Soldier tavern as it would have been awkward. He left money for them to celebrate his promotion. He planned to meet Sergeant MacIntosh the next day to catch up on the regiment's news. MacIntosh shared that the soldiers were excited about Hector's return as a colonel.

Despite their differences, they worked together harmoniously. When a strategic decision arose, Turenne favored a circuitous route to starve out the enemy, while Enghien insisted on a direct attack. The battle unfolded with Turenne maneuvering through a narrow pass to flank the enemy, while Enghien led a frontal assault. The intense fighting resulted in heavy losses on both sides. Eventually, Enghien's bold leadership prevailed, driving the Bavarians back. Meanwhile, Turenne faced a fierce battle in a defile, overcoming hidden foes to join forces with Enghien. After a grueling conflict lasting hours, the Bavarians retreated to a new fortified position, ending the day in a temporary ceasefire to tend to the wounded and regroup for the next phase of the battle.|"[""1.

After scouting the area, Enghien decided on two attacks: one on the trenches near the hill and the town, and the other on the felled trees at the mountain's base. A false attack was planned between these points. Turenne's troops advanced towards the hill, followed by Enghien's army. Just as they were about to attack, a commotion from the hill caused Enghien and Turenne to investigate, leaving strict orders to wait. Count d'Espenan, in charge of Enghien's regiments, launched an attack prematurely on a redoubt, sparking a serious engagement. Despite the confusion, the battle ensued. The French faced difficulties passing the felled trees and were pushed back by the Bavarians. The battle raged with no clear winner until darkness fell, halting the assault. The next day, after resting, Enghien followed Turenne's advice and cut off the Bavarian retreat, forcing them to abandon their supplies and artillery. Though both sides suffered losses, the French claimed victory as the Bavarians retreated.|"[""1.

Colonel Campbell was praised for his strategic decision during the battle. Turenne, a skilled general, acknowledged Campbell's tactic of keeping half his men idle to conserve ammunition and prevent being overthrown. Turenne observed the regiment fighting in turns, with one line engaging while the other rested. After the Bavarians retreated, the wounded were cared for, and the troops rested briefly. Turenne and Enghien discussed the battle, with Enghien commending Campbell's regiment for its exceptional performance. The generals decided to capitalize on the Bavarians' absence by seizing control of the Rhine and the Palatinate. Turenne's army mobilized for the siege of Philippsburg, a strategic town on the Rhine. The siege began, with challenges posed by the town's defenses and the surrounding terrain. Turenne's foresight and strategic planning were crucial in this military campaign.|"['1.

The commander decided to withdraw the garrison from a distant fort, allowing Turenne to take control and fortify it with a strong force. Enghien then set up defensive lines around the town to protect against potential enemy forces. While this was happening, boats arrived with supplies, and a bridge was quickly constructed over the river. Subsequently, the army captured Germersheim and advanced to Spires, which surrendered. The siege of Philippsburg began, with Turenne and de Gramont leading the attack on the town's bastions. Despite facing challenges, they successfully breached the defenses, leading to the town's surrender. Enghien continued to expand French territory along the Rhine, capturing various towns without much resistance. The troops spent the winter in Paris, with Turenne overseeing the regiment's reorganization and training in Nancy. The officers were pleased with the restructuring, which improved their ranks and morale.|"['1.

During the winter of 1644-45, troubles erupted across France with peasant uprisings against heavy taxation and nobles. In February, urgent appeals for aid reached Hector at Nancy. Riding with four companies towards Poissons, they encountered a messenger seeking help for the besieged chateau of Blenfoix. Racing towards the burning chateau, Hector and his troopers prepared to face armed peasants attacking the tower where Lady Blenfoix and her retainers were holding out. With swords drawn and pistols ready, they charged through the gate, fighting their way up the narrow turret stairs to reach the besieged tower.

Hector swiftly rose, leading the charge up the narrow tower steps. The resistance was weak due to the limited space for fighting. Surprised peasants dropped their weapons, pleading for mercy. Hector deftly dealt with any opposition, while his companions Paolo and Nicholl provided covering fire. Despite receiving some cuts, Hector's armor protected him. As they reached the tower top, a pale lady and her daughter awaited, saved from despair by Hector's arrival. The lady, of Irish descent, recounted her losses and expressed gratitude for the timely rescue. Hector, feeling faint from his wounds, declined help, confident in his men's care.

"""I did what I could, mademoiselle. I remitted half their rents, which was in fact but a small thing, seeing that I knew positively they could not have paid them.

At Joinville, the soldiers encountered scattered groups of peasants who fled upon seeing the troops, resulting in minimal fighting except for Hector's encounters. The fallen soldiers were buried near the chateau, while the peasants' bodies remained for their families to retrieve after the troops departed. The severe lesson learned from the encounters left over 280 casualties. In the following spring, the Poitou regiment joined the marshal, taking advantage of the weakened Bavarian army. Turenne crossed the Rhine, advancing towards Stuttgart and Marienthal on the river Tauber. Facing a shortage of forage, Turenne's cavalry split to gather food, while scouts monitored the Bavarian army's movements.

Turenne commanded his cavalry to withdraw and regrouped with three fresh regiments beyond the woods. Despite being in a strong defensive position, the Bavarians hesitated to attack him. Turenne then sent an officer to gather the scattered infantry and ordered a swift retreat to Philippsburg, 70 miles away. He led his cavalry towards Hesse, covering the retreat and ensuring safe passage across the Tauber River. This strategic move prevented the enemy from advancing and securing captured towns.

"Hector quickly gathered the officers and issued crucial instructions. ""Your priority isn't just saving yourselves, but aiding the cavalry against the Bavarians,"" he emphasized. The challenging journey continued in darkness, with men and horses exhausted. Turenne advised Hector to boost morale among the troops. Despite the fatigue, they pushed forward cautiously, avoiding potential ambushes. The cavalry found a safe spot to rest and regroup. Hector, now accompanied only by Paolo, joined the officers by a fire. The colonel regretted missing the battle but acknowledged their victory.

Hector conversed with the colonel about the recent battle, acknowledging that even great generals make mistakes. The colonel criticized General Rosen's blunder, attributing the error to him instead of Turenne. He then questioned Hector about his young age as a colonel. Hector explained that opportunities for advancement were rare and shared his experience. Despite his youth, Hector was respected for his achievements. Later, Hector agreed to give his parole to avoid close surveillance. The pursuit continued, but Turenne managed to reach safety with a stronger force. Hector and Paolo were taken to Kirchheim, where Hector was confined for refusing parole. Despite this, he received courteous treatment due to the reputation of Scottish and Irish officers. The battle of Marienthal was followed by a delay in movements due to orders from Paris. Turenne awaited reinforcements led by Enghien, and the armies eventually met at Spires. Discussions ensued among the generals regarding the best strategy against the Bavarians. Enghien favored a decisive battle, leading to the capture of Wimpfen and a retreat by General Merci. However, tensions arose between the generals, prompting Konigsmark to withdraw with his forces. Turenne's diplomatic efforts helped retain the Hessians, and the French and Hessians prepared to face the Bavarians at Nordlingen.|"[""1.

After spending a week in a Kirchheim prison, Hector was transferred to Ingolstadt along with other prisoners. He was given a separate room in the castle due to his rank, and Paolo, his servant, was allowed to stay with him. Hector believed that patience was key to finding a way out, despite the strong fortress. He advised Paolo to befriend soldiers and officers to gather information. Hector hoped for an exchange after the campaign but was wary of missing any action. The castle was heavily guarded, but the officers were friendly towards Hector. He shared his remarkable rise to colonel with them. Paolo, being Italian and Hector's servant, was well-liked among the soldiers for his good-natured demeanor.

"Hector chuckled, ""Patience is key, Colonel. I'll make the best of my situation. I'm content here, except for the lack of activity. I do enjoy plotting escape strategies though. I wish my servant could go outside. He's not a soldier or French, so he's not a prisoner of war. He's cheerful and would appreciate a run in the city. Sometimes I need things he could fetch."" The Colonel proposed a deal: Hector's servant could come and go freely if Hector promised he wouldn't help him escape. Hector agreed, though he was disappointed.

Paolo and his master were devising a plan for Hector to escape. Paolo suggested disguising himself as a countryman to blend in with the carts leaving the gates. Hector approved but added a clever twist - Paolo should fake a swollen cheek and pretend to be deaf and dumb to avoid suspicion. They planned for Paolo to help Hector out of the cart by shifting sacks and concealing pistols for protection. Hector would disguise himself in country attire to walk back unnoticed. The plan was to be executed when an opportunity arose. Paolo prepared the disguises and hid them in a safe spot. As weeks passed, Paolo occasionally left early, pretending to fetch items for Hector. Hector was in no rush to escape, as news of troop movements indicated a delay in battles.|"[""1.

One evening, Hector devised a plan to sneak into the storehouses to take sacks of flour. Late at night, after soldiers had finished unloading the wagons, Hector and Paolo quietly removed sacks from one of the carts. They cleverly concealed the missing sacks by rearranging the remaining ones. Hector even hid inside the cart under the sacks. Once the gates opened in the morning, Paolo disguised himself and joined the wagons leaving the castle. He pretended to be injured to avoid suspicion. After stopping at an inn, Paolo paid for drinks for the carters and then parted ways. Meanwhile, Hector managed to sneak out of the cart and meet up with Paolo, successfully executing their plan to acquire the flour.|"['1.

"After a few minutes, Hector jumped down, and Paolo put the sacks back in place. Together, they hurried across the broken ground and entered a wood. ""That was well done, Paolo. Now, we need to find our way across the country. We can't follow the river as it heads south, away from where we need to go. We'll have to travel at night for a day or two. Let's head north today, staying in the woods to avoid being found,"" Hector explained.

As they ventured into the vast forest, they agreed it was unlikely anyone would search such a large area. After a hearty meal, they rested by a stream until sunset. Hector suggested following a stream to find a village. As darkness fell, they decided to rest and light a fire for warmth and safety. Paolo cooked some meat over the fire, and they settled in for the night, planning their next moves."|['1.

Hector and Paolo conversed until almost midnight and then rested until four in the morning, as the first light of July illuminated the sky. They strolled along the woodland's edge for thirty minutes until they reached a path emerging from it. Following the trail, they soon spotted a village ahead. Hector proposed to enter the village to purchase supplies while Paolo circled around to avoid drawing attention. Hector planned to casually buy food and then take some for the journey. Paolo expressed concern about being late due to navigating the forest at night. As they discussed their route through Eichstadt towards their homeland, Hector suggested buying woodmen's axes and long knives for protection in case they encountered robbers. Despite their limited funds, they were prepared for the journey ahead.|"[""1.

As they reached Eichstadt, Hector and Paolo decided to stop at a quiet inn for a meal and to buy some tools. They left just before the gates closed and were caught in a thunderstorm. Seeking shelter, they knocked on the door of a nearby house. An unfriendly man finally opened the door, holding a torch and a sword. Hector, frustrated by the delay, demanded to be let in. The man, realizing their plight, invited them inside. Hector explained they were heading to Gunzenhausen for work and were forced to travel at night due to uncertain times. The man, understanding their situation, offered them hot beer with eggs to warm them up. Despite the storm, they found refuge for the night.|"['1.

Hector and Paolo, after a perilous night, decided to wait for a safe party heading to Hall due to the dangerous road infested with lawless bands.

Hector and Paolo joined a convoy of waggons heading to Hall, aiding them through challenging terrain. Upon reaching Hall, news of the approaching French army led them to leave the baggage train and move towards a farmhouse to avoid being caught in the conflict between the French and Bavarian armies.

Every day, Hector gathered news in a place and discovered that Wimpfen had been seized by the French in a sudden attack, crossing the Neckar. On his return, he swiftly departed with Paolo, only to find out that the French had advanced to Rothenburg. Encountering a detachment left on the Neckar, Hector met familiar officers and, using Paolo's funds, equipped themselves and bought horses captured from the Bavarians. They set off to join the army, reaching the French at Dinkelsbuhl. Hector learned of Konigsmark and the Swedes' defection and the strength of Conde and Turenne's army. Welcomed back by his regiment with cheers, Turenne himself approached to inquire. Hector joined just in time for a potential battle and was invited to share his escape story and any news on Merci's forces with Turenne later.

Hector expressed his gratitude towards Paolo, acknowledging his invaluable role in their adventures. Paolo had not only been a servant but also a friend, supporting Hector through thick and thin. De Thiou revealed that he had been managing Hector's pay during his capture, ensuring it did not fall into arrears. As they prepared to open their trenches for the night, Hector and his companions discussed the upcoming battle at Nordlingen. Despite the challenges they anticipated facing, they remained hopeful, particularly admiring the military genius of Enghien. Hector shared a tale of how Paolo's quick thinking and bravery had saved him during a dangerous encounter, highlighting Paolo's resourcefulness and courage. The conversation then shifted to a state matter involving Mazarin, where Hector's discreet actions had earned him the gratitude of the influential figure. Turenne commended Hector's discretion in handling the situation, recognizing the potential consequences had his involvement been revealed.|"['1.

When Hector returned to his regiment, he discovered that orders had been given for four companies to start working on the trenches under an engineer officer's guidance. De Thiou had already gone down with the leading companies, showing that the siege was to be pushed forward quickly. Captain Mieville praised the swift progress, mentioning past conquests. However, news of Merci's advancing forces towards Nordlingen interrupted their work. The troops were quickly recalled, and the army marched towards Nordlingen. As they approached, they found Merci's forces already positioned strategically. Despite the challenging terrain and strong enemy defenses, Enghien decided to engage in battle. A council of war was held, and despite some reservations, Enghien led the charge against Merci's army. The battle was intense, with both sides fiercely fighting for victory.|"[""1.

It was five o'clock in the afternoon when all the arrangements for the battle were finished. Since it was still early in the evening on August 3rd, there was enough daylight to begin the fight. The French army started with a cannon attack on the village, which was met with return fire from the hills. The French faced challenges moving their heavy cannons as they advanced, losing time and suffering more than they inflicted. Enghien ordered the center infantry to advance quickly to the village. Despite their eagerness to redeem themselves from a previous battle, the French infantry faced heavy musket fire from the village defenders and were forced to retreat. Enghien regrouped the infantry and led a charge, while Merci brought his main forces to the village. The battle intensified, with Enghien displaying bravery and resilience. Despite being shot multiple times and losing horses, he continued to lead and inspire his troops. Merci, equally brave, was fatally wounded. The French right flank struggled against Bavarian cavalry, resulting in their defeat. The battle remained uncertain until Turenne led his troops up the hill of Weinberg, engaging in fierce combat. With Conde's reinforcement, the French eventually defeated the Imperialists.|"[""1.

During the battle at Nordlingen, the French forces led by Turenne faced the Imperialists. Despite the French right and center being defeated, the left managed to capture a key village. If the Imperialists, under John de Werth's command, had acted swiftly to recapture the village, the battle's outcome could have been different. However, John de Werth lacked military strategy and retreated after dark, allowing Turenne's division to claim victory. The French suffered heavy losses, but Turenne's German troops remained intact. With the threat of a new Imperialist force led by the Archduke Leopold, Turenne and de Gramont decided to retreat to Philippsburg, crossing the Neckar River and taking refuge. The campaign ended with no significant advantage for the French, emphasizing the importance of strategic maneuvers in military actions.|"[""1.

In the 1645 campaign, Turenne faced challenges when Weimar's cavalry mutinied and crossed the Rhine. Turenne, with a small force, aimed to reinstate the Elector of Treves. Despite facing Imperialists, Treves was successfully invested, and the elector restored. This victory not only pleased the German princes allied with France but also closed a vital entry point for Imperialist troops into France. Turenne's strategic brilliance and bravery earned him honours in Paris. He advised Hector, a trusted officer, to visit Paris and then his estate. Turenne believed that presenting himself to Mazarin and delivering despatches would ensure a warm reception at court. Turenne also mentioned that Mazarin held Hector in high regard, making it beneficial for Hector to maintain this connection through occasional visits to Paris.|"[""1.

Before Hector left for the court that evening, Monsieur de Villar had set an admirable example by reducing fines and rents for his tenants during tough times. The queen praised this noble act, expressing a wish to extend such generosity throughout the royal lands. Hector, a colonel of the Poitou infantry, visited a clothing store to prepare for the court. He opted for a velvet cloak in violet, a yellow satin tunic, and breeches with matching rosettes. The tailor suggested a large collar with gold embroidery to complement the outfit. Hector also ordered a fashionable travel suit and a Parisian attire, leaving the details to the tailor's expertise.|"['1.

Hector quickly selected a cloak and doublet from M. Poitrou's stock, then moved on to be measured for knickerbocker-style breeches. He opted for a violet cap with a yellow feather to match his court dress, a court sword, high riding boots, and loose walking boots. After instructing the tailor to deliver the items to the auberge Pome d'Or for payment, Hector made a striking figure in his new court attire. The ladies at court took notice of his fair complexion, ringlet hairstyle, and soldierly bearing. Both the queen and the cardinal showed him attention, and he enjoyed reconnecting with Colonel Maclvor. The cardinal later summoned him, informing Hector of unrest in Poitou and releasing him to investigate. Hector delayed his departure by two days to receive his ordered clothes, then set off with his troopers towards Poitou, where he encountered signs of peasant uprisings and deserted villages on his estate. Upon reaching his chateau, he found it fortified and prepared for defense, with the drawbridge lowered in welcome as he approached.|"[""1. What did Hector select from M.

The colonel and MacIntosh discussed fortifying their castle against potential attackers. They decided to build walls along the fosse to prevent assailants from sneaking in. The tenants were put to work gathering stones to construct the walls while scouts kept watch for approaching insurgents. The colonel suggested using flour sacks filled with earth to protect the gate and bridge. The men worked swiftly, creating walls with sharpened poles as a defense. The drawbridge was secured with chains and filled with sacks of earth for added protection. The night passed without incident, and the next day, the defenses were further reinforced with walls bristling with pointed staves.

MacIntosh swiftly led thirty men down from the castle walls to an earthwork barrier at the road's entrance on the plateau. Meanwhile, tenants gathered at the cliff's edge, ready to hurl stones. Torches lit the path, and cressets with flaming tow balls were readied. MacIntosh observed the approaching crowd, estimating their numbers at around four thousand. As the peasants advanced, a few armed men guarded the barricade with muskets and pikes. Hector, in armor, addressed the insurgents, urging them to reconsider their attack. Despite his plea, the mob continued their advance. When they came within range, Hector signaled for the torches and muskets to be revealed, halting the attackers momentarily.

A mob, defeated and suffering losses, was about to face a surprise attack. The plan was to use mounted tenants to scatter the mob and capture their guns. This strategy aimed to strengthen the castle and prevent further attacks. By dispersing the mob, the threat to the estates would diminish. The operation began at midnight, with horses crossing the fosse quietly. The group, led by Hector and MacIntosh, approached the sleeping insurgents.

Hector, the commander, swiftly directed his troops. He urged Paolo to lead a group up the hill, while others were to descend the valley. Hector rode on, instructing MacIntosh to harness teams to the guns and transport them uphill. The pursuit lasted two hours, scattering insurgents across the countryside. Hector signaled for trumpets, and the troops regrouped before returning leisurely to their base. Meanwhile, MacIntosh struggled to haul the remaining guns up the steep road with double teams. Using ropes, mounted men swiftly pulled the guns to the plateau. The garrison rejoiced as they reentered the chateau unharmed. Hector, confident in their victory, planned to fortify the defenses further.

The Duke of Bavaria was upset with Austria's lack of support and began to play France against Austria. Mazarin suspected the Duke might switch sides, so Turenne was ordered not to cross the Rhine. Despite promises of neutrality, the Duke joined the Imperialists. Turenne, realizing the Duke's betrayal, marched to besiege Luxembourg. He then sought to join forces with the Swedes to counter the Imperialists. After a long march and strategic moves, Turenne successfully joined the Swedes, leading to a standoff near Freiburg. Turenne then advanced towards the Maine, uniting with the infantry. Despite being outnumbered, the allies captured towns and pressured Bavaria. The Duke, fearing defeat, made peace terms, delivering fortresses to the allies. This prevented the allies from marching on Vienna, with Mazarin's intervention saving Austria.|"[""1.

For a long time, Catholic powers had warned about the danger of Austria's defeat. The Swedes and Protestant German allies would gain territory, making Protestantism dominant in Germany. Turenne was ordered to march to Flanders, but he knew his German troops wouldn't follow. They'd be vulnerable to Imperialists. Turenne opposed the plan, fearing for his country's safety. Despite warnings that the war would harm the Catholic religion in Germany, the Queen supported the march to Flanders. Turenne captured towns on his way but faced mutiny at the Rhine. He convinced some troops to return, but others joined the Swedes. The order to march was canceled later. The war continued, with Turenne defeating Imperialists and Swedes. After thirty years, peace talks began earnestly, leading to peace in 1648. Turenne's efforts were crucial in the negotiations.|"[""1.
