The explorers faced the challenging task of navigating against the river's swift current. They sailed smoothly for three hundred leagues from the Amazon, exchanging goods with curious tribes along the way. However, ominous signs emerged as the natives grew wary and hostile, launching poisonous arrows at the explorers.

The German and New Englander moved away from camp, following the Xingu River, while their friends disappeared into the forest. Each carried firearms - a repeating Winchester and a Smith & Wesson. Ashman felt uneasy about a trail leading into the woods near the camp, possibly worn by villagers or wild animals. The Xingu River was clear, but dangerous. The explorers encountered rapids, forcing them to carry the canoe. Floating timber and logs made navigating the river treacherous. Dense forest lined the riverbanks. Three natives observed the explorers, dressed similarly but taller and darker-skinned. Long wanted to confront the natives, prepared to open fire if necessary. The Professor approached cautiously, armed but hoping for peace. Despite Long's concerns, the Professor sought a friendly encounter, ready for any aggression.|['1.

During a dangerous encounter, Jared Long and Grimcke faced a sudden attack from two savages. Grimcke cleverly dodged a javelin and arrow by dropping to the ground and popping back up swiftly. The Winchester rifle shot from Grimcke took down one of the attackers instantly. The remaining savage, realizing the danger, swiftly vanished into the trees. Long and Grimcke, angered by the attack, chased after the fleeing assailant. Long, with his quick reflexes, managed to catch a glimpse of the native and pursued him. Despite the dense undergrowth, Long gained ground on the fleeing savage. However, the native made a sudden leap, evading Long's aim.

The excited shout was directed at a figure on his right, whom he believed to be the Professor. However, to his surprise, it was the other native holding a javelin. The Professor had tried to chase the flying native but stumbled and fell due to an obstacle. Remembering the javelin, he picked it up. The wooden javelin was six feet long, with a stone tip. The moonlight was bright, allowing him to inspect the weapon closely. He realized the stone tip was toxic and deadly. As he examined it, he heard noises from the trees and saw a third native approaching. The Professor shouted, causing the native to flee. Neither of the explorers wanted to harm the natives.

The dense forest by the river provided perfect cover for the savages, making them a constant threat. If they had stayed hidden among the trees and taken stealthy shots, they could have been more successful. Javelins thrown in desperation missed their target, except for one that narrowly missed Bippo's head. The savages seemed confined to the left bank, but the group feared they might attempt to cross the river. As they paddled the canoe, a massive savage emerged from the forest, observing them.

Upon reaching the right bank, the explorers faced a new concern besides the savage tribes they had encountered earlier. It was known that two hostile white men were nearby, posing a different kind of threat due to their intelligence. The explorers decided to leave their luggage in the canoe, ready to push it into the river if needed. They refrained from making a fire and sat silently under the cover of the woods.

A vital requirement was for him to stay in the shadow without moving, to avoid being discovered. The moon was high, casting only partial shade where he stood. The young man positioned himself at the edge of the forest, expecting an attack from the savages across the stream. Surprisingly, he saw no canoes, even though the tribe had access to them. He anticipated a midnight attack and heard a splash in the water. While focusing on the other bank, a noise behind him startled him. It was a puma that approached the river to drink.

The group by the shore was surprised by a sudden attack from the woods. Instead of charging at the defenders, half swam across the stream while the others ran towards the camp. The defenders, Grimcke and Long, fought back despite running low on ammunition. Quincal, a brave native, joined the fight, driving his spear through an attacker. The attackers, wanting to capture the defenders for torture, faced retaliation. Grimcke and Long, protected by trees, shot down the attackers as they swam across the river. The attackers panicked, diving and swimming to escape, but many did not resurface. The battle was short but devastating, leaving bodies scattered. Quincal's bravery turned the tide, and even the cowardly Bippo and Pedros emerged after the chaos subsided.|"['1.

When Bippo and Pedros saw their fallen comrade, they grieved loudly. The explorers, Jared Long and the Professor, joined in mourning. The body was respectfully placed in the boat with a stone tied to the ankles. They paddled to the center of the river, where a prayer was said before the body was lowered into the water. The group reflected on the loss of two members and the dangers they faced in the mysterious Matto Grosso. Despite their grief, they knew the importance of their mission. As they drifted downstream, they realized their missing friend, Fred Ashman, had not returned. The group speculated on his whereabouts while staying vigilant.

Fred Ashman stood near the Xingu river when he noticed a puma drinking from the stream. As he observed, a canoe with a large, muscular man paddling down the river caught his attention. The man steered the boat towards Fred's location. Despite the ongoing conflict sounds from the rapids, Fred focused on the man approaching him. The man navigated the canoe skillfully, showing immense strength. Just as the man was about to reach Fred, a puma emerged from the shadows and threatened the man with a spear in hand. The scene unfolded rapidly, with the man leaping ashore and the puma advancing menacingly towards him.

The warrior faced the fierce puma, ready to defend himself. The beast hesitated, sensing something different about this opponent. The native, skilled in battle, knew the puma's next move. With lightning speed, he hurled his javelin, striking the creature's chest. As the puma recoiled, the warrior readied himself for another attack. The puma, learning from its mistake, crept closer, preparing for a stealthy leap. But the warrior was one step ahead, positioning himself for a powerful thrust. With precision, he drove the spear deep into the puma's chest, ready for any counterattack.

The native man shook his head, holding his spear but not making a move to leave. Ashman hoped he wouldn't, realizing the importance of gaining his trust. The native seemed to be warming up to Ashman, possibly impressed by his victory over the fierce warrior Ziffak. Despite the history of conflict between white men and the natives, the native showed a positive attitude towards Ashman. Ashman, however, couldn't shake off a feeling of unease, fearing the native's agility and the potential danger he still posed. As they walked along the Xingu River, Ashman discreetly placed his hand on his revolver, ready to defend himself. The native noticed Ashman's unease and shifted his javelin away, trying to ease any fears. Ashman learned that the Murhapa tribe, ruled by King Haffgo, was a formidable group known for their intelligence and strength. The tribe had been impressed by the two white men who had arrived with advanced weapons. Ariel, the king's daughter, had learned English from the white men and was admired for her beauty and grace. The white men had tried to court her, but she remained uninterested, hinting at a possible future with one of them.|"[""1.

Long ago, the Murhapas faced a tragic event when a group of white explorers was killed by the fierce people. Ariel, the king's daughter, felt sorrow for the strangers' fate, but she harbored distrust towards Waggaman and Burkhardt. Ziffak, the head-chieftain, led attacks on enemies, instilling fear in all. The Aryks, fearing white invaders, agreed to be the Murhapas' slaves in exchange for protection. Ziffak and the white men plotted to provoke the Aryks into attacking, showcasing the head-chieftain's prowess. The Murhapas possessed riches like diamonds and gold, sourced from mysterious mountains. They held a magical peak and a lake with clear waters. The Murhapas taught the Aryks to use deadly spears and poison, along with an antidote. The tribes used stone tools as they had no knowledge of iron. They cultivated corn, cotton, and tobacco but were unaware of bananas, sugar cane, and rice. Their beliefs included a myth about the world's creation and an afterlife.|"['1.

Ziffak, a favorite of the beautiful Ariel, may have spared the explorers due to her grief over the white men who visited her home three years ago. Anthropologists are unsure of the origin of the tribes in the area, but many believe they are related to the Caribs. The Murhapas, powerful and rich, fiercely defend their territory. The explorers, with Ziffak's help, faced hostility from Waggaman and Burkhardt, who concealed their enmity. Ziffak, after joining the explorers, shared his knowledge, easing their worries. Despite past dangers, the explorers were determined to explore the enchanted land with Ziffak's help. Ziffak, with a plan to pacify the Aryks, left swiftly in his canoe. The explorers, though hopeful, felt a hint of doubt after Ziffak's departure. Yet, they trusted in his friendship and awaited the outcome of his actions.|"['1.

Jared Long from New England had a strong belief that Ziffak, a savage who showed immense hatred towards the white race, could never become a friend just because he was taken captive. He was convinced that if he helped them reach the Murhapa village, it was solely for seeking revenge. Jared emphasized the influence of Waggaman and Burkhardt, stating they would never share their power with others. Ashman suggested they move closer to the rapids to shorten their journey the next day, concealing themselves from the Aryks across the river. Upon reaching the end of their voyage, they encountered a large group of vengeful Aryks armed with poisoned javelins, ready for a bloody confrontation. Despite the danger, the group remained brave, preparing to face the impending attack.|"[""1.

Ziffak, the powerful warrior, swiftly crossed the Xingu River to save his friends from danger. His arrival prevented a deadly trap set by the Aryks. The whites, led by the Professor, carried the canoe and luggage, moving cautiously along the riverbank. Bippo and Pedros, initially terrified, aided in carrying the boat, relieved to have escaped imminent peril. Ziffak's swift action and alliance with the explorers averted disaster. The group continued their journey, grateful for the warrior's intervention.

The group of explorers was exhausted and needed to rest. They had little sleep the night before after a tough day's work. They decided to take a break at the top of the rapids. They fixed their boat and prepared for the next leg of their journey. While most of the group slept, Professor Grimcke kept watch. The Xingu river lay ahead, surrounded by dense Brazilian forests. The water was clear, and the group caught fish easily for breakfast. They paddled against the current, staying close to the bank. Despite their excitement, they knew dangers still lay ahead. They pondered the risks posed by their enemies and debated whether to reveal themselves to the Murhapas without Ziffak, their native friend. They continued paddling, making good progress by midday.|['1.

"Around this time, as they navigated a bend in the Xingu River, they caught sight of the river stretching ahead for about half a mile before it curved out of view. Naturally, they scanned the waters for any potential foes who might be nearby. ""He's alone,"" exclaimed the surprised New Englander, noting the lone figure approaching from an unexpected direction. It appeared that since their last encounter, he had journeyed back home and was now returning to guide his friends to his people.

After the incident at the rapids, he sternly warned the Aryks against any further aggression towards the white men. He emphasized that these particular outsiders were friends to all natives and would only resort to violence in self-defense. The cunning Ziffak hinted that the newcomers were far better individuals than the previous settlers among the Murhapas.

As they conversed, the two boats floated gently side by side, making steady progress towards their destination. Ziffak reassured them of his company for the remainder of the journey, easing their concerns. By paddling moderately, they anticipated reaching their destination by mid-afternoon, a favorable time to meet the king when he was in good spirits after his siesta.

The Murhapa houses were mostly single-story, except for the grand two-story residence of Haffgo, the king. A peculiar mix of dark-skinned natives and fair-skinned individuals like the king and his daughter Ariel puzzled the newcomers. Ziffak, the king's brother, stood out with his dark complexion. As they entered the village, the group felt vulnerable, relying on Ziffak's protection. The villagers, adorned in gold and diamonds, followed them silently. The absence of animals in the town added to the eerie atmosphere. Bippo and Pedros, visibly frightened, drew some amusement from the locals.

In an instant, there was a sudden burst of smiles on the dark faces, revealing stained black teeth. The spear wasn't poisoned, leading to laughter from the white friends once they learned the truth. However, the prankster hadn't anticipated the consequences. The victim's cry had barely left his lips when Ziffak leaped into action like a cyclone. The warrior, still grinning, soon found himself in the fierce grip of the chieftain. With a single mighty blow, Ziffak brought him down, then swung him around before hurling him into the Xingu River. The lesson was clear, and the crowd backed away, realizing the severity of the situation. Bippo and Pedros, being servants, were not allowed to see the chief. Ziffak led the others into a hut adorned with animal skins, creating a regal atmosphere. The room exuded opulence, with walls adorned with furs and weapons displayed in an ornate manner. At the back, a platform held a magnificent throne, surrounded by vases of exquisite flowers emitting a delightful fragrance. The king himself, Haffgo, wore a crown adorned with dazzling diamonds, radiating a rainbow of colors as he spoke.|"['1.

The ruler, King Haffgo, appeared in a unique outfit with a crimson hue adorned with images of the sun, moon, and various creatures in gold. Despite his fair complexion, he differed greatly from the African or native Murhapa individuals. His appearance was more akin to that of an European. The king's hair, hazel eyes, Roman nose, and strong chin portrayed a commanding presence. When greeted by Grimcke, Long, and Ashman, the king's demeanor exuded stateliness. The explorers offered trinkets, but the king's regal crown and diamond ornaments overshadowed their gifts. Despite their attempts to befriend him, it was evident that their presence was not entirely welcome. The king's distrust of white men was palpable, likely influenced by reports of outsiders seeking riches in the region.

The king's lovely daughter, Ariel, caught the attention of the visitors with her curious glances from behind the curtains. Despite her attempts to conceal her interest, her eyes sparkled like diamonds, drawing the gaze of a young man named Fred Ashman. King Haffgo, noticing the exchange, grew suspicious of Ashman's fascination with his daughter. In a sudden move, the king revealed Ariel's breathtaking beauty, commanding her to step forward. Her black hair cascaded down her back, contrasting with her spotless white gown and delicate features. The explorers were captivated by her perfection, akin to a painting by Rubens or a sculpture by Michael Angelo. As the king sternly ordered the visitors to observe his daughter, Ariel's gaze seemed to fix on a point beyond them, while Ashman, lost in his infatuation, failed to notice the king's watchful eyes upon him.|"[""1.

As Fred Ashman stood tall, he gazed directly at the frowning king. Despite the risk, his eyes sparkled when he met the gaze of blushing Ariel, smiling and saluting her. This bold act caught the attention of the king and his chieftain. The smile he offered Ariel was seen as disrespectful, akin to striking the king himself. Yet, to his surprise, Ariel responded with a faint smile, brightening her face like sunshine. Ignoring her dazzling jewelry, Ashman was elated by her acknowledgment. He worried about his audacity only after leaving. The day was ending, the air cooling. The natives dispersed, leaving the village serene. The Professor and his companions awaited Ashman, who had inadvertently stirred trouble. They were granted a brief stay by King Haffgo but knew they must leave soon, despite his command. The king's angry conversation inside the palace hinted at trouble brewing, leaving the explorers uneasy.|"[""**1.

The group found themselves inside a building, not much bigger than the others, but better equipped, possibly due to the occupant's royal status. The ground floor was divided into three sections - one for cooking and hosting guests. The mother of Ziffak and King Haffgo, a strong widow in her seventies, paid little attention to the visitors, assuming they could manage on their own. Later, she returned to help with dinner. Bippo and Pedros were catching up on sleep after their arduous journey. Ziffak seemed about to share something important but changed the subject. He then admitted his tales about an enchanted lake and a burning mountain were fictional, to the relief of the Professor. Ziffak revealed that the king was displeased with their presence and might ask them to leave sooner. The group learned that Waggaman and Burkhardt had met with the king during Ziffak's absence. The Professor suggested meeting with the two men, but Ziffak didn't know their whereabouts. Ashman decided to explore the village, assured by Ziffak that he wouldn't face any issues.

Fred Ashman felt a strong urge that pushed him outside. He longed to avoid the prying eyes of his friends who suspected his secret. He craved the freedom to stroll in the open air, ponder, and revel in his newfound joy. As dusk fell, he left the building, surrounded by darkness, with no light in sight. The locals seemed to wander aimlessly, glancing at him curiously but not bothering him. Lost in his thoughts, he walked towards the river, deep in contemplation. Unaware of his surroundings, Ashman failed to notice a man stealthily following him. This man, Burkhardt, an escaped convict, sought Ashman's life.

Ziffak, the head chieftain, was furious when one of the explorers dared to smile at Ariel. Despite his anger, Ziffak restrained himself from escalating the conflict, reminding his brother of their tribe's commitment to keeping their word. Eventually, King Haffgo agreed to let the explorers leave peacefully if they departed by sunrise. Ziffak hoped his brother would change his mind and allow them to stay longer. When Ashman, one of the explorers, left to stroll, Ziffak suspected he wanted to see Ariel. As Ziffak left to find other troublemakers, he noticed Ariel sneaking away and Burkhardt lurking nearby.

Just as Burkhardt aimed to fire, a sudden movement by the lovers changed the course of events. Ariel, noticing the danger, watched in horror as the giant figure behind Burkhardt swiftly impaled him with a javelin.

Ziffak, startled by the sound of gunshots from the village, realized that the explorers were under attack by the Murhapas. King Haffgo had broken his pledge for the first time, causing Ziffak great distress. With overwhelming emotion, Ziffak ran towards his home where the shots were coming from, indicating a fight for survival. In a state of panic, he grabbed Ashman, conveying the urgency of the situation. Racing through the woods to the river, they swiftly boarded a boat. Ashman, armed and vigilant, noticed the calm current, indicating unusual depth. Fleeing for their lives, the lovers remained silent, knowing any distraction could be fatal.

Ashman thought it was lucky for Ariel to have crucial knowledge for their escape, but unfortunately, their enemy also knew it. The boat resembled Ziffak's, made of bark and sealed with gum. They found a creek leading to the enchanted lake. Ariel signaled to steer in, warning of a lookout. They passed the motionless sentinel, a Murhapa. Ziffak shared that King Haffgo was angry at Ashman for his interest in Ariel. The group feared for their safety and discussed their predicament. The night was dark until Ziffak's mother lit a fire.

"With little effort, the small boat glided smoothly through the water as if it had a mind of its own, responding to the slightest touch of the paddle. The oarsman watched in awe as the boat moved gracefully, propelled by his gentle strokes. As he gazed ahead, a massive rock formation emerged from the lake, appearing to rise and approach them.

A mix of fear and wonder gripped him as he pondered the significance of this eerie sight. Despite his unease, he trusted the guidance of Ziffak and the mysterious Ariel. They seemed to be leading him into the unknown, towards a dark tunnel in the rock face.

The explorers found themselves in a perilous situation, besieged by a hundred brave Murhapas armed with weapons more feared than firearms. Escape seemed nearly impossible, with little hope of extricating themselves from this danger. The idea of the Murhapas setting fire to the building to force them out was a looming threat. The explorers strategized, knowing a united rush from the besiegers would likely prevail, but the cost would be frightful. As they prepared for the impending crisis, Jared Long and the Professor observed the movements of the Murhapas, anticipating the next attack.

Waggaman was the driving force behind the operation, although he was not visible at the moment. Signs suggested that a sudden attack had been planned. If left unopposed, it would spell disaster for those who had valiantly defended themselves thus far. The gunfire erupted simultaneously. Both sides fired rapidly, causing chaos and terror. The defenders strategically focused their shots at the front, drawing the attention of the attackers. Meanwhile, Ziffak, a cunning member of the Murhapa tribe, observed the situation and took action. Realizing the danger, he discreetly moved towards the rear, where he knew his friends would need an escape route. While the battle raged on, Ziffak slyly launched a boat into the river, providing a potential means of escape for the besieged defenders.|"['1.

Returning to the back of the besieged building, Ziffak devised a plan to move the warriors to the front and then swiftly return to aid them. This risky scheme would surely result in punishment once discovered. Using a clever pretext, he directed the Murhapas to hurry to the other side of the building to assist, strategically placing some at the rear to prevent any surprise attacks. Unbeknownst to the explorers, their success was due to Ziffak's stealthy assistance. Just as Ziffak was about to execute the rest of his plan, he spotted Professor Grimcke fleeing toward the woods. Puzzled, Ziffak dashed inside to find him, only to be met by chaos as Waggaman and the Murhapas rushed in from the other door. Despite the commotion, there was no gunfire, and the mob entered both rooms. With the white men gone, Ziffak decided not to pursue them but instead led his followers toward the river, creating a clamor to maintain their courage. Meanwhile, Burkhardt had been killed by a poisoned javelin, and Ariel, the ruler's daughter, was seen fleeing with the despised white man, Ashman, toward the enchanted lake. A pursuit was organized, with Ziffak joining under the king's leadership.

The bright light pouring from the enormous opening was reminiscent of the northern lights or a rising red sun. Ashman realized it came from a burning mountain, casting a blood-red glow over the lake. The volcano had burned for ages with a steady draft drawing vapor up through a chimney, preventing excessive heat. Ashman and Ariel reached the rocky shore, marveling at the crater of the volcano. Spiraling columns of black vapor rose, occasionally revealing the jagged boundary. The dazzling glare made it hard to look directly. Ashman caught whiffs of sulfur, aware of the danger if the vapors swerved. Despite the risk, they stood boldly, taking in the impressive sight.

Ashman decided to leave the area with his partner, and they descended among the rocks towards their canoe. Haffgo, the Murhapa king, agreed to let the explorers stay until the next day. However, his anger grew when he suspected a connection between the young member of the group and his beloved Ariel. Waggaman, a troublemaker, fueled the king's rage, leading to an assault on the whites. Learning that his daughter and the youth fled towards the enchanted lake, the king's fury intensified. A native woman witnessed the princess and the youth in a loving moment, interrupted by a white man's attack, thwarted by Ziffak. The king confronted Ziffak, who defended his actions, proving his loyalty. The pursuit of the lovers began, organized by the king, with a select group, including Ziffak and Waggaman.

King Haffgo sat sternly at the back of the boat, his face showing anger, his arms crossed, lost in deep thought. No one dared to disturb him. Just ahead, Ziffak directed the crew's actions, while Waggaman stood at the front, silent and scowling. They both distrusted each other deeply. Waggaman knew the reason behind his companion's death and harbored a strong hatred towards Ziffak. The tension was palpable. Haffgo's fury was aimed at Fred Ashman for taking his daughter, even ready to harm her. Ziffak's decision to head to the enchanted lake instead of fleeing through the woods was strategic to outwit Haffgo.

As they stood in the shadows of the forest, safe from harm, they felt immense gratitude for their deliverance. Despite the danger, they decided to reunite with their missing companion, Ashman, downstream along the Xingu river. Their plan was interrupted when they spotted their canoe drifting towards them.

Jared Long, in his escape from danger, brought an extra Winchester rifle, ensuring the group was well-armed. They found ample ammunition on board, boosting their confidence. The goal was to distance themselves from the Murhapa village. The natives were ready to assist, but a group of Aryks armed with javelins surrounded them. Surprisingly, the Aryks were friendly due to a warning from Ziffak. They helped carry the boat around dangerous rapids. The group hid the boat from sight and waited for Fred Ashman.

Ariel was sure that her family and community were unaware of her discovery. She suggested to Ashman that they hide in the mysterious cave until the danger passed. She thought if they weren't found soon, people would assume they had chosen to end their lives together, stopping the pursuit. Ashman agreed with Ariel's plan. He pushed the canoe far out onto the lake to avoid leaving a clue. As they cautiously navigated the dense vegetation that thrived without sunlight, they found the entrance Ariel had described. The opening was just wide enough for them to pass through by stooping slightly. Ashman led with his Winchester ready, followed closely by Ariel. As they moved deeper into the cavern, the light increased, revealing a vast space with towering stalactites and stalagmites. The lovers encountered a ledge that led further into the cave, covered in sparkling points of light that Ashman suspected were valuable minerals. Ariel explained that these were similar to diamonds she had seen her people mine by the lake. The scene was breathtaking, with enough wealth to change nations.|"['1.

Despite feeling the presence of Ziffak, whom he believed to be a friend in disguise, Ashman pondered how to navigate the crisis. As they climbed towards the cave's peak, the path became perilous, leading to a dramatic leap across a chasm. Positioned for defense, Ashman and Ariel prepared for an imminent confrontation.

The natives couldn't harm them from afar. Ashman and Ariel guessed the next move - the natives might try to bridge the gap. But Ashman was ready to defend. Ziffak disappeared, leaving them puzzled.

About thirty minutes after the chief disappeared, two smaller figures were spotted sneaking towards the cavern's entrance. Their movements were so discreet that it was hard to identify them. Ashman suspected Haffgo was among them, but he wasn't sure. The Murhapas seemed to hide from the lovers but allowed enough to be seen. King Haffgo started doubting Ziffak. When the archer failed to harm Ashman, suspicions grew. Ziffak was sent back to the village to bring more warriors. Haffgo and the archer stealthily approached the fugitives. Haffgo saw Ashman and Ariel together, igniting his anger. The archer shot at Ashman but hit Ariel instead. Ashman retaliated, saving Ariel but hitting the archer.

Wrapped in his arms, she admitted that bringing the powerful remedy was an inspiration when she left her father's house. She never imagined its use until she felt the sharp pain in her arm from the missile. Overwhelmed, she remembered the remedy and quickly drank it all, enough to save several lives. With determination, Ashman decided to find a way out of their dangerous situation. Peering cautiously around the diamond cavern, he saw their enemies leaving but decided to investigate a draft he felt near the roof. Climbing carefully, they found a hidden opening covered by bushes at the top. Orienting themselves using the sun, they planned to avoid the Murhapa village, threading through the forest to reach the Xingu river below the rapids.
