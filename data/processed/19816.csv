After the rain had stopped, the area was still wet with shallow puddles scattered around. The water had carved through the earth in some places, revealing red and raw soil. Enormous stones had been unearthed and displaced from their original positions by the force of the water.

The chipmunk scampered along the stone fence, glancing back at the excited kids. Unfazed, he knew he could outrun them.

Vi scoffed at Laddie's riddle about breakfast and expressed her preference for a heartier meal. As they trudged wearily along the barren landscape by the railroad tracks, the siblings struggled with the uneven ties beneath their feet.

"There was no doubt about it. The passage was flooded with ice-water! The porter was spluttering, and the two kids were starting to cry when Daddy Bunker arrived to see what was going on. ""Alright, Sam!"" said Daddy Bunker, giving the porter a big tip. ""Get more cups, more ice, and consider it settled. I might need to tie a rope to each of my kids for the rest of the trip to keep an eye on them. I can't trust them out of my sight anymore."" Although Daddy was irritated by Mun Bun and Margy's actions, it wasn't as bad as he said. Mun Bun looked serious when he returned to the group.

This news was welcomed by all the Bunker kids. Even Russ and Rose were weary of train travel. Eventually, the train journey became tiresome for the active Bunker children who missed their home activities. The train continued into the Southwest, covering several hundred miles while the children napped.

The Bunkers were unaware of the transformations in the cattle-shipping towns of the Great West. Cavallo had changed significantly since Daddy Bunker's last visit. The Westerners themselves debated whether the towns improved with additional businesses. Range bosses now used automobiles instead of ponies, and some ranches even used airplanes to find lost animals. The family discussed these changes when a well-dressed man named Cowboy Jack approached them cheerfully. He preferred being called Cowboy Jack and made a memorable impression on the Bunker children with his flashy attire and friendly demeanor. Despite his loud voice and unique clothing, the children found Cowboy Jack likable.

They rode through the town in cars, feeling like they were in the East. People dressed the same as in Pineville, with familiar stores and buildings. The children, Russ and Laddie, thought they might not need their cowboy and Indian outfits anymore. As they left the town, they saw a ranch in the distance, but Cowboy Jack said his ranch was further ahead. The children enjoyed the fast ride and smooth road, except for the dusty parts that made Margy and Laddie sneeze. They held hands to comfort each other. Cowboy Jack, although speaking oddly at times, was liked by all. The sun was setting as they approached the hills where the ranch was located. The children were excited to see the ranch houses. Cowboy Jack had a surprise planned, but he seemed too busy preparing waffles and rooms for his guests. As they settled in for the night, the children heard noises outside, including pony riders galloping by.|"['1.

The younger boy shared Russ's excitement to see the pony riders. Once Mother Bunker allowed them to go after they finished eating, they rushed outside, only to find the cowboys gone. However, a surprising sight awaited them. A procession of Indians traveling across the plain made the children shout with amazement. Before they could inquire about the Indians, they vanished from sight. The little Bunkers were easily distracted by new things to see, like the corrals, bunkhouses, and various dogs at the ranch. Russ learned about the different dogs from a Mexican boy. The children then set off to pick flowers, with the younger ones following the older siblings. As they explored the pretty country, they stumbled upon a breathtaking view beyond a ridge that left them speechless.|['1.

Beside a stream, a worn log cabin stood low. No windows, a door off its hinges, and a bonfire outside with a kettle on it. A woman rocked a baby on the doorstep, watching the pot. Nearby, a man chopped wood, wearing a funny fur cap with a tail hanging down. Suddenly, wild Indian men on ponies approached with painted faces, causing fear. However, soldiers in blue with plumed hats arrived, easing the tension. The children, frightened by the Indians, were relieved by the presence of the soldiers.

Russ began to suspect that there was a deception at play. The gentle behavior of the Indian women and children suggested that their husbands and fathers were not as savage as they seemed. Although he couldn't quite grasp it, Russ was convinced there was some trickery involved. Another surprise awaited them! The elderly woman smiled warmly at the children and nodded. Despite her aged and weathered appearance, she exuded kindness, which even Vi noticed. The four little Bunkers accompanied Cowboy Jack and their father to a large tent at the center of the camp.

Pinky continued to move forward confidently, seemingly knowing his way, while Rose realized she was lost and Russ, her brother, was not with her. This realization frightened Rose, as she felt safer with Russ. Pinky, the intelligent pony, couldn't understand Rose's distress as she burst into tears. Rose tried to guide Pinky back home, but he continued in a direction away from where they needed to go. Rose hesitated to leave the trail, hoping to encounter someone or a house.

Rose splashed into the water, but what hurt more than being wet was when a stone hit her ankle, causing her to scream in pain. Pinky, the pony, grazed nearby, seemingly indifferent to Rose's distress. Despite her hurt ankle, Rose couldn't catch Pinky, who eventually ran off spooked by a hidden creature. Alone and scared, Rose realized she needed to follow Pinky back home. As she tried to hobble after him, she noticed a yellow creature hiding behind a bush, its tail flat on the ground.

Rose sat forlorn in the wilderness, feeling abandoned and worried about her family back at the ranch. She realized Russ must be searching for her, and her parents, the Bunkers, would be concerned too. As she pondered her situation, she lamented not having food or a bed. The lost girl's heart ached, feeling let down by Russ, who usually stood by her in tough times. Tears welled up in her eyes, but she knew the lame coyote nearby didn't care about her troubles. Rose's thoughts drifted to the wounded animal's need for water, and she wished she could help. As the afternoon wore on, she felt desolate, unsure of the way back home and puzzled by Russ's absence. Meanwhile, Russ rode his pony, hot on the trail of Cowboy Jack and Daddy Bunker, searching for Rose and the missing film crew.|"['1.

Cowboy Jack mentioned that Black Bear, an Indian, could track the missing girl's trail better than anyone else due to his keen observation skills. Despite going to college, Black Bear retained his exceptional trail-hunting abilities. Russ, concerned about his sister Rose, followed the ranchman and his father into a wild ravine.

Russ returned to the ranch house brimming with excitement about acting in a movie. Rose's ankle was slightly twisted but she could walk fine the next day. Mother Bunker insisted on accompanying the children outdoors. They played with the ponies near the house as the fields were mostly unfenced. The ponies were great companions, especially Pinky who Russ believed to be very intelligent. Eventually, Mrs. Bunker agreed to take the children to see a movie scene depicting an Indian attack on a fort. The children eagerly anticipated the outing. They packed food and a tent for an overnight stay. Russ and Laddie rode their ponies while the rest of the group traveled in Cowboy Jack's car. During the journey, Vi pondered why grasshoppers had to jump instead of walk. As the car hit a bump, Mun Bun's makeshift kite flew into Russ's pony's face, causing the pony to startle and Russ to fall.
