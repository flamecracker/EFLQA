"No one but myself knows the suffering I endured and the benefits my books gained from your unwavering vigilance. Now, a volume goes out into the world without your approval, a strange occurrence in our shared experiences. I watched with interest, pain, and eventually amusement as you struggled to read ""The Black Arrow."" I couldn't miss the chance to acknowledge this in the book you never read. I hope others show more consistency. The story was written years ago for a specific audience and in competition with a particular author, Mr. Alfred R. Phillips. Although I couldn't surpass Mr. Phillips, ""The Black Arrow"" was seen as an improvement by some readers. Different audiences had contrasting opinions on ""Treasure Island"" and ""The Black Arrow."" The scene shifts to Tunstall Moat House, where the bell rang at an unusual time, gathering people from all around. Tunstall hamlet in the time of King Henry VI looked much like it does today, with oak-framed houses scattered in a valley by the river. The church stood among yews halfway up the village. The view was framed by green elms and oaks from the forest. A group near the bridge discussed the bell's meaning, awaiting news from Sir Daniel Brackley. Young Master Richard Shelton arrived, bringing news of an impending battle. Sir Daniel called for all able men to join the fight in Kettley, without revealing the cause or location.

Dick and the peasant were in a heated discussion, but Bennet Hatch's arrival interrupted them. Bennet was a tough-looking man, loyal to Sir Daniel, and he quickly ordered everyone to head to the Moat House. Dick followed closely as Bennet spoke to an old soldier, Appleyard, who was focused on his cabbages. Appleyard seemed unfazed by the commotion, continuing to dig and sing. Nick, another man present, commented on the lack of skill among the group, especially in archery. As they chatted, a flock of birds flew in a disorganized manner, signaling potential danger. Appleyard pointed out the importance of birds as sentries in the forest, hinting at the looming threat from those who despised Sir Daniel and his men.|"[""1.

The old archer cried out, warning Bennet of the consequences of their actions. An arrow suddenly struck the old man, leaving him lifeless among the cabbages. Hatch, startled, sought cover, while Dick Shelton prepared his crossbow. Despite the calm surroundings, the tension was palpable. Bennet, pale and hesitant, approached the fallen archer. As Dick removed the arrow, blood flowed, and the old man passed away. Hatch prayed for his soul but remained wary of the forest. Reflecting on their past deeds, Hatch and Bennet contemplated the ominous black arrow and its message. The scene was tense, with uncertainty hanging in the air.|"['1.

"""Nay, Bennet, never. Nay, not he,"" said the priest. ""There cometh never any rising, Bennet, from below--so all judicious chroniclers concord in their opinion; but rebellion travelleth ever downward from above; and when Dick, Tom, and Harry take them to their bills, look ever narrowly to see what lord is profited thereby. Now, Sir Daniel, having once more joined him to the Queen's party, is in ill odour with the Yorkist lords. Thence, Bennet, comes the blow--by what procuring, I yet seek; but therein lies the nerve of this discomfiture.""""An't please you, Sir Oliver,"" said Bennet, ""the axles are so hot in this country that I have long been smelling fire.

The smartest among them was Dick Shelton. Instead of foolishly chasing the fugitive, he readied his crossbow, aimed, and asked if he should shoot. The man was almost safe, but the steep uphill slowed him down. Dick felt a twinge of pity as he aimed. The shot hit the man, causing a cheer from the pursuers, but he quickly recovered and vanished into the woods. They found a paper on him with poorly written lines. Sir Oliver was distressed by the sacrilege and asked Dick to read the paper. It mentioned someone called Jon Amend-All from the Green Wood. Sir Oliver lamented the state of the world.|['1.

"""Master Bennet, stay where you are,"" the priest responded firmly. ""I will prove my innocence and not risk my life unjustly. I swear I was not at the Moat House; I had left on an errand before nine."" Dick Shelton noticed the priest's gaze briefly on him, realizing this was his father, Sir Harry Shelton. Despite the revelation, Dick remained composed. Meanwhile, Hatch and Sir Oliver strategized; they decided to keep ten men to guard the Moat House and escort the priest through the woods. With Bennet staying behind, Dick was appointed to lead the group due to his popularity and leadership skills. Before departing, Bennet advised Dick to take a longer route, stay alert, and not trust Sir Daniel entirely. Bennet also asked for a gold mark for his soul if he fell in battle.

"At 2 a.m., Sir Daniel sat in the inn room near the fire because it was cold in Kettley. Next to him was a jug of spiced ale. He had removed his helmet, revealing his bald head and dark face, covered in a red cloak. His men guarded the door, some sleeping nearby. A young boy lay on the floor. The innkeeper stood before Sir Daniel. ""Listen,"" Sir Daniel said, ""follow my orders, and I'll be good to you. I need good men for important roles. If not, you'll pay.

Master John declined to eat, opting to fast instead due to being forced into a sin. He requested water from the innkeeper out of courtesy. Later, a commotion arose in the village, and Richard Shelton arrived with a letter from Sir Oliver, urging the knight to hasten to Risingham. The knight, Sir Daniel, emphasized the importance of riding cautiously for safety. He inspected his new troops, known for his boldness in battle and care for his soldiers. Despite being unpopular, his men admired his leadership qualities. Sir Daniel humorously mocked some soldiers' appearances, assigning them to the front lines.

Sir Daniel calmly explained that the incident occurred between the Moat House and Holywood, but his suspicious glance at Dick's face revealed his doubts. He instructed Dick to quickly finish his meal and return to Tunstall with a message from him. Sir Daniel emphasized that staying in Kettley until confirmed news of the war was wise due to the ongoing rebellion and uncertainty surrounding the king's authority. As he wrote his letter, the weight of the Black Arrow mission troubled him. Later, he handed the letter to Dick and urged him to hasten to the Moat House.

In the morning, Sir Daniel's men gathered in the main street after the tucket sounded. They were well-prepared, with soldiers and archers in murrey and blue livery. Sir Daniel, proud of his troops, led the way on his horse. Suddenly, a girl named Joanna was missing, last seen in the stable saddling a grey horse. Sir Daniel ordered his men to find her at the Moat House. As they marched, Dick rode through the fen, with windmills spinning and willows swaying in the wind. The ancient path, built by Romans, led through the marshes, hiding treacherous bogs. Despite riding all night, Dick felt cheerful as he journeyed home, guided by the windmill and Tunstall Forest in the distance.|"[""1.

About a mile from Kettley, Dick reached a break in the causeway where reeds and willows dotted the landscape, creating a confusing sight. The gap was long and dangerous for strangers. Dick worried about the boy he had guided poorly. Despite this, he felt confident as he gazed at the windmill sails against the sky and the Tunstall Forest ahead. While crossing a waterway, he heard splashing and saw a horse stuck in the mud. The distressed horse neighed for help. Dick decided to assist the poor animal. After helping the horse, he continued his journey, hoping to find the lost boy. Eventually, he encountered the boy, who explained his misfortunes.

"""Not I,"" said Dick firmly. ""They don't come to mind. A plague on them, I say! I prefer hunting, fighting, feasting, and living with cheerful foresters. I've never known a maid fit for any duty, except one; and she, poor thing, was burned as a witch for wearing men's clothes against nature.""

""A witch's spirit?"" Dick exclaimed. ""But let's pray for her; she was the best girl in Europe, Joan of Arc. Even old Appleyard the archer fled from her, claiming she was like Mahoun. She was a brave girl.""

""But, Master Richard,"" Matcham continued, ""if you dislike maidens so much, you're not a true man; God created them both with purpose, bringing true love into the world for man's hope and woman's comfort.""

""Faugh!"" Dick scoffed. ""You're a weakling, always talking about women. If you doubt my manhood, step down and face me, whether in a fight or with a bow and arrow, I'll prove my worth on you.""

""One Joan Sedley,"" Matcham blushed. ""It was Sir Daniel's doing; he stands to gain from both sides. I've heard the poor girl lamenting the match. Seems she shares your views or dislikes the groom.""

The boat crashed into a dense thicket of willows. Matcham, pale but alert, jumped ashore as Dick tried to follow with the horse. Stuck between the horse's size and the thicket, they struggled.

"""We need to hit the road soon,"" Dick said to Jack. ""Your hand needs work, mate. If I had a hand like yours, I'd be embarrassed. I swear Hugh Ferryman mistook you for a girl once."" ""He did, indeed, for a bet!"" Dick laughed. ""Can't blame him. You look more like a girl than a boy. You're a strange-looking lad, but without the girly act, you'd be quite handsome.""

Matcham and the two lads, invigorated by Dick's discovery, hastened through the remaining outwood and safely crossed the road. As they ascended into Tunstall Forest, the landscape transformed. Trees clustered in groves with sandy patches in between, dotted with ancient yews. The terrain grew uneven, pitted with hillocks. The wind intensified, bending the trees like fishing rods. Suddenly, Dick dropped to the ground and crawled backward into the shelter of the trees. Bewildered, Matcham followed suit. From their hiding spot, they observed a man in a green tabard standing in the fork of a tall fir, scanning the surroundings. Descending into a hollow, they encountered ruins of a burnt house. The sound of a man clearing his throat and singing emanated from nearby. Matcham, intrigued, crossed the fallen rafter towards the ruins, with Dick trailing behind.|['1.

In a hidden nook within the ruins, two fallen rafters formed a secret shelter just big enough for two boys to hide. Peering out through an arrow hole, they saw a fearsome sight. Nearby, a man with a red face and a dagger stood listening, while a pot bubbled over a fire. Another man lay sleeping nearby, covered in a cloak. The clearing was dotted with daisies, and a bow, arrows, and deer meat hung on a hawthorn tree. The man at the fire tasted his broth like a seasoned cook. Suddenly, more men arrived, grabbing food and sitting down to eat. Among them was a grizzled man with authority, carrying a boar-spear.

Ellis casually pocketed the purse and surveyed the scene. His comrades eagerly devoured their meal and drank ale, knowing they had luck that day. However, urgent matters called for a swift meal. As some dozed off, others readied their weapons. Suddenly, an arrow shattered the chimney, signaling danger. Ellis rallied his men, ready for revenge. The Black Arrow group swiftly vanished, leaving only remnants of their presence. The two boys, Matcham and Dick, hidden nearby, watched in awe. Overwhelmed, Dick contemplated warning the men, but Matcham cautioned against it. Reluctantly, they left, Dick conflicted about the impending fate of Ellis and his men.|['1.

Dick and Matcham were out on the heath when Matcham spotted a group of men led by Ellis Duckworth approaching. Dick quickly took cover and whispered to Matcham about the situation.

During the ambush, the attackers hid in the woods, tormenting a lone survivor named Selden. Despite being under attack, Selden bravely fought back, causing confusion among his assailants. As he ran for his life, arrows narrowly missed him, and his pursuers struggled to aim effectively. Just as it seemed Selden might escape, a stentorian voice, belonging to Ellis Duckworth, echoed from the nearby woods. This voice was followed by a battle trumpet signal from John Amend-All. The attackers, taken by surprise, now had to contend with the unexpected turn of events.

It was high time for them to flee. The Black Arrow company was swiftly advancing towards the hill.

The clamor of their arrival had barely faded towards Shoreby when the sound of fresh hooves approached, signaling another rider, this time alone and adorned in impressive armor. Following closely behind were several wagons, fleeing clumsily with their drivers desperately urging the horses forward. Despite their early start, their fear did not protect them. As they neared the boys, a man in battered armor, consumed by rage, overtook the wagons and mercilessly attacked the drivers. Some fled into the woods while others were struck down where they sat. In the distance, the noise of an advancing army grew louder, a chaotic mix of cart wheels, horse hooves, and men's voices. Dick, realizing the colors of Earl Risingham, understood that the battle had decisively favored the York side.

"""Sir Daniel, you did indeed do that,"" Dick said, sighing as he remembered the encounter. ""I would have rather met the devil himself. I am still trembling. Why were you in such a state?"" he asked.

""I was skulking for my life in Tunstall wood, Dick,"" Sir Daniel explained. ""We fared poorly in battle, swept away in the chaos. Where are my men-at-arms? I do not know! The shots rained down; I haven't seen any of my men since three fell. I made it to Shoreby, disguised in this gown and bell. The sound of this bell would scare any outlaw. I found you and Matcham. I could barely see through this hood, and I feared revealing myself. But now, let's revive this poor lad with some canary.""

Sir Daniel gave the patient a drink, and as he regained consciousness, he shared a meal. ""I long to be out in the open again,"" Sir Daniel admitted. ""I will avenge this betrayal.

Matcham took the oath as requested, and Sir Daniel adjusted his hood before preparing his bell and staff. Seeing him once more in that frightening disguise brought back the fear to his two companions. However, Sir Daniel quickly rose to his feet and ventured back into the woods. The sound of the bell began to fade as he walked away, leaving the two boys by their untouched meal. They quickly ate and followed the path through the upper levels of the forest, where tall beech trees stood among green lawns, and birds chirped happily on the branches. After two hours, they started descending on the other side and caught sight of Tunstall House's red walls and roofs among the treetops. Matcham paused and told Dick that it was time to part ways. They embraced and said their goodbyes as Matcham expressed his concerns about Sir Daniel's future behavior.

They were free from the passage. With a bit of strength, they lifted the trap and entered a vaulted chamber that opened onto a courtyard where workers were tending to horses. Torches flickered against the walls, casting changing light. Dick blew out his lamp to avoid detection, leading the way upstairs. In a brown room, a rope was tied to an old bed frame. Dick began lowering it out the window into the dark night. Joan stood by, growing fearful as the rope kept lengthening. At a critical moment, she spoke, startling Dick. The rope slipped from his hands, splashing into the moat below. A sentinel above demanded to know who was there. Strong arms pushed the door back against him, but Dick fought back. He tried to lift the girl, but she was unresponsive. Men seized him, and he fought them off, poinarding one. He straddled the window-sill, grabbed the rope, and descended, spinning and hitting the wall. He fell into the water, then struggled to shore. As he tried to escape, arrows and torches were thrown at him. He managed to reach safety in a willow tree, but not before being hit by an arrow.|"['1.

After a fierce battle, Dick found himself wounded and alone in the dark forest. He saved his life in the fight but now faced the harsh reality of being injured and defenseless. Despite Joanna being in Sir Daniel's hands, Dick believed she would be safe with other protectors. Determined to bring down Sir Daniel, Dick felt freed from any obligations towards his enemy. As he struggled through the forest, Dick's pain and confusion overwhelmed him, forcing him to rest against a tree. When he awoke, the morning light revealed a chilling sight - a man hanging from a tree. It turned out to be Throgmorton, Sir Daniel's messenger.

In a dimly lit tavern near the harbor, a few men were enjoying ale and eggs. They were tough-looking fellows, not to be trifled with. A younger man, better dressed and of higher birth, sat by the fire. One man expressed concern about the weather and the dangers of being in town. The group left the tavern, heading towards the shore, unnoticed in the sleeping town. They were followed by a mysterious figure with a torch. The men discussed a plan involving a young woman named Joanna Sedley. As they walked towards a walled garden by the beach, tensions rose. Eventually, they parted ways, each heading home with their companions.|['1.

In the dark, Dick cautiously ventured out, guided by the sound of the wind and surf. He found an alley, armed his crossbow, and approached a run-down building. Despite its appearance, a light shone from an upper window. Peering inside, he saw Dame Hatch and a lady who resembled Joanna Sedley. Surprised by her beauty, he heard a warning. The house was being watched. Dick recognized a badge on the watchers but couldn't place it. He decided to leave quietly to avoid being caught between shots. He instructed John Capper to gather men and set a rendezvous point. Dick and Greensheve circled the garden cautiously.|['1.

Staying far from the wall, Dick and Greensheve circled two sides cautiously, seeing nothing. On the third side near the beach, they had to walk on the sands as the garden wall was close. The surf was high, and water splashed over the sand. They waded through the icy water, inspecting. Suddenly, they saw men near the wall signaling vigorously. Greensheve commented on the situation, and Dick decided to assist if needed. The men waited for a sign of attack but saw none. Dick then instructed his men to prepare for battle, and they shouted and charged at the enemy. The surprised foes, scattered and cold, stood up but were quickly overwhelmed by the sudden attack.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Dick and Greensheve see near the beach?\nA) Men signaling vigorously\nB) High surf splashing over the sand\nC) Garden wall far away\nD) A peaceful garden\nE) Birds flying overhead', 'Question 2:\nHow did Dick and Greensheve navigate two sides of the wall?\nA) Walking on the sands\nB) Climbing over the wall\nC) Swimming in the icy water\nD) Flying over the garden\nE) Riding horses', 'Question 3:\nWhat was the initial reaction of the men near the wall upon seeing Dick and Greensheve?\nA) They ran away\nB) They signaled for help\nC) They waved in greeting\nD) They ignored them\nE) They started a conversation', ""Question 4:\nHow did the foes react to Dick's sudden attack?\nA) They surrendered immediately\nB) They counterattacked fiercely\nC) They ran away in fear\nD) They stood up and tried to defend themselves\nE) They joined forces with Dick"", 'Question 5:\nWhat did Dick instruct his men to do when they saw the enemy?\nA) Retreat and regroup\nB) Prepare for battle\nC) Negotiate for peace\nD) Run away\nE) Hide and wait', 'Question 6:\nHow did the foes feel after being overwhelmed by the sudden attack?\nA) Confused and lost\nB) Relieved and grateful\nC) Victorious and proud\nD) Scattered and cold\nE) Prepared and ready']"|['A) Men signaling vigorously', 'A) Walking on the sands', 'B) They signaled for help', 'D) They stood up and tried to defend themselves', 'B) Prepare for battle', 'D) Scattered and cold']
In this manner, the two small groups of the Black Arrow men closed in on the seaside of the garden wall, trapping some of the strangers between them. The rest of the strangers scattered in different directions to escape. Despite the surprise advantage, Dick's outlaws were outnumbered by the men they had surrounded. The fight had just begun. The beach had shrunk due to the rising tide, setting the stage for a fierce battle between the two sides. The strangers, well-armed and silent, engaged in individual duels with the outlaws. Dick found himself in a challenging fight against a giant adversary armed with a two-handed sword. After a tense struggle, Dick managed to defeat his opponents one by one. Realizing the danger of being drawn away from his comrades, Dick swiftly ended the final combat by outmaneuvering his opponent and emerging victorious.|"[""1.

The strangers vanished quickly, raising suspicion. While the outlaws looted the dead, Dick checked the front of the house. He saw a light in a small roof opening, likely the feared signal for Sir Daniel's men to arrive. Hearing a noise, he rushed back to the beach, finding the bodies stripped and disposed of. Soon after, about forty horsemen rode from Shoreby, leaving the area deserted. St. Bride's cross stood nearby, where two roads met. Dick reached the spot at dawn, wrapped in his tabard, watching attentively. A nobleman in splendid armor approached on horseback, followed by armed men. The nobleman dismounted, praising Dick's actions and offering gratitude. Dick humbly accepted the praise, revealing his intentions and requesting the nobleman's help.|"['1.

Dick assisted Lord Foxham to dismount and led him to the cross on the knoll. He then recounted his recent experiences to the nobleman, who listened attentively. Lord Foxham praised Dick's bravery and honorable character, assuring him of his support. Despite being held captive, Lord Foxham acknowledged Dick's noble qualities. They discussed plans to rescue Joanna, who was in Sir Daniel's custody. Dick took charge of the situation in Shoreby while Duckworth was absent. They devised a plan to free Joanna by force that evening. However, obstacles arose as Sir Daniel increased security around the house.

"""It is well meant,"" said the skipper. ""You can leave, boy; I will keep your friend and my gossip company until curfew, and by St. Mary, until the sun rises again! When a man has been at sea for a long time, the salt gets into his bones; even if he drinks water, he will never be satisfied."" Encouraged, Dick saluted his company and went back to the Goat and Bagpipes. He sent word to Lord Foxham that they would have a boat ready to set sail in the evening. With two outlaws who knew the sea, Dick returned to the harbour. The skiff of the Good Hope was small and fragile. They approached the anchored boat in the heavy swell, capturing it with a surprise attack. The boat was well-stocked with French wine and treasures.

The leader guided his men to a simple tavern where he had arranged to meet some of his followers. Some were waiting outside while others were inside, gathering close around Lawless and the two seamen. It was evident that they had gone far beyond moderation, as they were singing a sea shanty loudly. The young leader quickly scanned the place and saw that his men outnumbered the others. Satisfied, he walked up to the table but was immediately seized and bound. Soon, he and his companion were left in a hay-barn. With a prearranged signal, Lord Foxham's followers arrived, and they commandeered boats to head towards a ship. Despite some commotion from the shore, it was too late for the seamen to stop them.

During a daring mission, Lord Foxham led his men onto a pier, only to be struck down by a shower of arrows. Chaos erupted as the men on the pier fought back in fear and pain. Hawksley quickly had Lord Foxham carried back to the ship, leaving the men to fight without guidance. Panic spread as the men faced disaster. A retreat was called, and a cry of betrayal filled the air. Amid the chaos, Lawless, the helmsman, held his post, steering the ship through the tumult with strength and determination. Despite the men's cowardice and demands to return ashore, Lawless remained resolute. As the ship plowed through the stormy sea, the men's fear turned to insubordination, leading to a violent confrontation that ended in tragedy.|"['1.

Several crew members were thrown overboard in a mutiny, and the remaining sailors cried out for Lawless to return to steer the ship. Lawless, realizing the danger they were in, quickly took control and sobered up. The steersman warned that the ship was still in peril as it struggled against the sea. Lawless, reflecting on his past as a Grey Friar, archer, and thief, acknowledged the imminent danger. He expressed hope but prepared for the worst, ready to face his fate with courage. As the ship continued to battle the waves, many crew members fell ill and sought refuge below deck, leaving only a few to assist Lawless.

In the forest, Dick and Lawless found a crossroad under ancient oaks. Lawless, familiar with the spot, suggested taking refuge in his hidden den to warm up with wine and a fire.

Dick placed the letter on the corpse, and Lawless, in a strange moment of clarity, pinned it with a black arrow. Despite the disrespect shown to the dead, Lawless laughed and sang loudly. Dick, frustrated, pushed him against the wall, urging him to leave to avoid trouble. As time passed, the room grew quiet, and the guests returned to find the torn arras and the spy's body, causing chaos and panic.

The ship's dog managed to escape the wreck and return to Shoreby. The dog barked furiously at two sham friars, asking for help as a shipman destroyed by pirates. The skipper, drunk, found the friars suspicious and demanded an explanation. The sailor, Tom, strong and sober, confronted the friars, leading to a scuffle where one of the friars, Lawless, used a wrestling move to escape. However, Arblaster and Tom quickly captured Dick, revealing him to be the sea-thief who had stolen Arblaster's ship and goods. Arblaster planned to tie up Dick to punish him for his crimes.

He ran swiftly, wrapping the cord around Dick's limbs skillfully like a sailor, securing it with knots and pulling it tight. Dick was now helpless in the skipper's hands, turned into a mere bundle. The skipper held him at arm's length, laughing, then struck him and kicked him furiously. Anger overwhelmed Dick, but he regained his composure when the sailor paused. Dick seized the opportunity to reason with them, suggesting a way to find hidden treasure instead of harming him. The skipper and his companions hesitated, intrigued by the possibility of riches. Eventually, they cut Dick's bonds, allowing him to walk freely and giving him a chance to escape.

The brave young man, Dick, found himself in a rustic tavern with his captors, Pirret and Arblaster. They sat around a heavy square table, enjoying mulled ale. Pirret demanded Dick to tell a tale to make amends for his past actions. Thinking on his feet, Dick spun a fantastical story akin to Ali Baba's adventures, captivating his listeners. As the night wore on, Dick cleverly loosened his bonds and devised a plan to escape. Seizing an opportunity, he distracted his captors and made a swift getaway, leaving them in a state of confusion.

The moon shone brightly over the snow-covered ground near the harbor, making everything as bright as day. Young Shelton, dressed in a kilt, leaped among the debris, easily visible from a distance. Tom and Pirret followed him with loud shouts, gathering more sailors from the nearby drinking spots as they went. A group of seamen began chasing Shelton, who wasn't a fast runner, especially for the 15th century. As he approached a narrow lane, he glanced back and laughed at his pursuers. The noisy commotion of the sailors was both comical and frightening to Shelton. Seeking refuge in a dark doorway, he watched the chaotic scene unfold with sailors shouting and falling in the snow. The uproar continued for a while, leading to fights and disturbances in the town. Despite the confusion, Shelton managed to evade his pursuers and found shelter for the night before setting off early the next morning to retrieve important papers.|"['1.

In the moonlit night, a fierce battle erupted as four men attacked Dick. Despite the odds, Dick fought back valiantly until a blow to his head brought him down. Just as things seemed dire, a trumpet blared, summoning help. Mounted men-at-arms rushed in, saving Dick from certain defeat. Among them was a slightly deformed but courageous lad who stood out to Dick. The attackers were swiftly dealt with and hanged. The duke, impressed by Dick's bravery, warned him not to be too hasty. Despite harboring some fear and distrust towards the duke, Dick accepted his invitation, knowing it would be impolite to refuse.

The ringing of the bells and the shouts of men running through the streets woke up around forty of the fifty people in a short time. They quickly mounted their horses and rode off in different directions as the alarm spread. When Richard of Gloucester arrived at the first house in Shoreby, he encountered only a few soldiers, whom he easily pushed back. A short distance into the town, Dick Shelton signaled to the duke to turn right, and the entire group followed suit, galloping down a narrow street. Meanwhile, the remaining troops turned to find reinforcements after facing a strong rear-guard. The impoverished area they seized was soon abandoned by its residents, who fled in fear, leaving the houses empty. Amid the chaos, Dick fortified his position, preparing for the impending battle in the narrow street that opened onto the market square. The town was in turmoil, with the clash of bells, trumpets, and the movement of soldiers creating a deafening noise. As the troops assembled in the market square, the attack began from all sides, with arrows raining down on the barricade where Dick and his men stood their ground. Despite the onslaught, a page approached Dick with a protective jacket, just as he was hit by an arrow. As the Lancastrians closed in, Dick ordered his men to return fire, leading to a fierce exchange of arrows. The Lancastrians charged towards the barricade, ready for battle.|['1.

In a fierce battle, the attackers fought to tear down the barricade while the defenders bravely protected it, resulting in chaos and casualties on both sides. The attackers, on horseback, charged forward, overwhelming the defenders. However, the defenders regrouped and fought back, creating a new barrier with fallen comrades and horses.

It was Dick's duty to locate and safeguard Joanna. He scanned his men's faces and chose those most likely to obey and stay sober. Promising them rewards and a recommendation to the duke, he led them across the now empty market-place and into the streets on the other side.

Desperate, he rushed in and headed to the chamber where he last saw Joanna. The room was in disarray, but Joanna was nowhere to be found.

A confused noise echoed through the streets, accompanied by occasional clashes of metal. The harbor was empty of ships, filled instead with rowboats carrying fleeing people. On land, horsemen clashed, some heading for the safety of the forest, while others, loyal to the Yorkists, fought to protect the town. The snowy fields were littered with fallen soldiers and horses. As Dick looked on, a group of Lancastrians caught his eye, making their way towards the forest. Seeking the Duke of Gloucester for reinforcements, Dick found him overseeing operations to clear archers from the harbor. Gloucester praised Dick's valor and offered him more tasks.

About halfway between the town and the forest, where Dick was trailing a group, he noticed signs of an attack by archers. The bodies of those he followed were scattered, each pierced by an arrow. Among the fallen, Dick recognized a young lad. Using a strong cordial, Dick revived the lad and carried him on his horse towards the forest.
