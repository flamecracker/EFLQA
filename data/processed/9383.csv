Moni had reached the highest point he usually stayed at, known as the Pulpit-rock. From there, he could see all around and far down into the valley. Moni enjoyed the view, laying on the grass, as the sky turned deep blue and the mountains and ice-fields sparkled in the morning light. His goats roamed around, content as Moni whistled and sang. Mäggerli, his favorite goat, showed affection by rubbing her head on his shoulder. Each goat had its way of visiting Moni, with the brown one checking on him cautiously and the young white one and Swallow playfully rushing towards him. The goats made Moni happy, but the billy-goat Sultan asserted his leadership among the flock. After a midday meal, Moni planned to climb higher with the goats towards the Dragon-stones, a path he knew well.
