When this tale starts, Elizabeth Ann, the main character, was a nine-year-old girl residing with her Great-aunt Harriet in a mid-sized city in a mid-sized State in the center of this country. Elizabeth Ann’s Great-aunt Harriet was a widow of modest means, and her daughter, Frances, taught piano lessons. They employed a woman named Grace who had asthma. Aunt Harriet kept Grace despite her coughing due to her kind heart. The household consisted of Aunt Harriet, Grace, Aunt Frances, and Elizabeth Ann. They were all slender and small, and Elizabeth Ann was very young. Despite their appearance, they were well-fed. The women were kind-hearted and took Elizabeth Ann in after her parents passed away. They believed it was their duty to protect her from other relatives who were not as adept at raising a sensitive child. Aunt Harriet particularly wanted to shield Elizabeth Ann from the Putney cousins, whom she deemed cold and lacking in sympathy. Elizabeth Ann was privy to Aunt Harriet’s low opinion of the Putneys. Aunt Frances, especially, dedicated herself to raising Elizabeth Ann conscientiously, studying books on child-rearing and joining a Mothers’ Club to ensure she was doing her best for the little girl.|"['1.

Elizabeth Ann and her Aunt Frances were incredibly close. Aunt Frances was determined to understand every thought and feeling of Elizabeth Ann, as she believed that most children are not truly understood. She wanted to protect Elizabeth Ann and ensure her happiness and well-being. Despite Aunt Frances's best efforts, Elizabeth Ann was not very strong or healthy, and her happiness was questionable. Aunt Frances was always there to reassure and comfort Elizabeth Ann, especially in times of fear. She would go to great lengths to shield her from anything that might frighten her, like big dogs or storms. Aunt Frances would even comfort Elizabeth Ann when she had bad dreams, holding her close and encouraging her to share her fears. Despite their efforts, there was one dream that was too sad to analyze, where Elizabeth Ann dreamt of being dead. This dream brought tears to both Aunt Frances and Elizabeth Ann.|"[""1.

Every weekday morning, Aunt Frances would take Elizabeth Ann's hand and guide her through the bustling streets to the tall school building where she attended classes. The noisy playground filled Elizabeth Ann with dread, but Aunt Frances's reassuring presence comforted her. After school, they walked home together, discussing the day's events. Aunt Frances sympathized with Elizabeth Ann's struggles and celebrated her victories. They spent their afternoons on various lessons and activities, from piano to French. Elizabeth Ann cherished their bond and confided in Aunt Frances about everything. Despite Aunt Frances's concerns about Elizabeth Ann's health, she reassured her that she would take care of her. Elizabeth Ann felt safe and loved in Aunt Frances's care, knowing she could always rely on her.|"['1.

One day, Aunt Frances finally called for the doctor after this had happened multiple times. The doctor arrived promptly, carrying his black leather bag, his sharp eyes scanning the room with an air of impatience. Elizabeth Ann was terrified, anticipating a grim diagnosis. To her surprise, the doctor declared her perfectly healthy, much to the disappointment of Aunt Frances. However, when Aunt Harriet coughed, the doctor's demeanor changed. He quickly attended to her, discovering a serious condition. Elizabeth Ann's life took a sudden turn as Aunt Harriet's illness required her to move away for treatment. Grace, the conscientious caregiver, found a new path too. Elizabeth Ann, lacking a similar option, was sent to stay with the Lathrop cousins temporarily.|"[""1.

Aunt Frances was overwhelmed with packing and moving furniture into storage, leaving little time to discuss Elizabeth Ann's situation. Cousin Molly agreed to care for Elizabeth Ann temporarily, feeling burdened by her own responsibilities. Elizabeth Ann felt abandoned as Aunt Frances focused on Aunt Harriet. Although Cousin Molly seemed reluctant, she comforted Elizabeth Ann after the aunts left. However, their plans changed when old Mrs. Lathrop announced a quarantine due to scarlet fever. She insisted Elizabeth Ann go to the Putney cousins, who had invited her to their farm. Mrs. Lathrop suggested sending Elizabeth Ann with James to meet the cousins in Hillsboro. The sudden change left Elizabeth Ann feeling unwanted and displaced.|"[""1.

And that was precisely what happened. It seems that when old Mrs. Lathrop gave instructions, they were always followed. I don't know more about Bridget, the one with scarlet fever, than you do. Judging from the name, she might have been the cook. Or perhaps old Mrs. Lathrop invented her for the occasion, which she was quite capable of doing, don't you think? In any case, Elizabeth Ann's bag was packed, as was Cousin James Lathrop's, and they both embarked on their journey. The big, middle-aged man was just as fearful of his mother as Elizabeth Ann. But he was heading to New York, where he might have thought of good times amidst business, while poor Elizabeth Ann was being sent to a place devoid of any joy. Aunt Harriet had made that clear many times. Poor Elizabeth Ann! You can picture the immense fear Elizabeth Ann felt as the train carried her closer to Vermont and the dreaded Putney Farm! The world had collapsed for her without Aunt Frances by her side! Even in familiar surroundings, she couldn't breathe properly without Aunt Frances! Now, she wasn't even going to the Putney Farm; she was being sent there! She huddled in her seat, increasingly terrified as her destination approached, gazing out at the winter scenery with its brown fields, bare trees, and rushing streams.

Elizabeth Ann found herself perched on a high seat in a wagon, feeling scared and alone. Her feet dangled above the ground, making her feel like she was in a dangerous place. She longed for Aunt Frances to be there to comfort her. Uncle Henry, unmoved by her distress, handed her the reins to drive. Panicked, she tried to remember which way to steer the horses. Pulling the wrong rein, she accidentally led them off the road. Despite her initial fear, she realized that the horses responded to her direction, not whether it was left or right. This newfound understanding calmed her nerves as she successfully guided the horses back to safety, surprising herself with her capability.|"['1.

Elizabeth Ann, a nine-year-old in the third grade, had a breakthrough moment. She realized that it's not about right or left, but about choosing the direction you want to go. This was a novel idea for her, as she had always been guided by Aunt Frances at home and her fast-thinking teachers at school. Excited by her newfound independence, she shared her discovery with Uncle Henry, who acknowledged its importance with a brief but weighty response. Feeling empowered, Elizabeth Ann took charge of driving the plow horses, overcoming her fear and successfully guiding them through obstacles. Her sense of accomplishment and newfound confidence shone through as she drove towards Putney Farm, a moment of personal triumph and independence.|"[""1.

"Two women in checked dresses and white aprons emerged from the house. One was elderly, the other could be considered young, similar to Aunt Harriet and Aunt Frances. However, they appeared quite distinct from those aunts. The tall, strong-looking woman with dark hair and the rosy, plump, white-haired woman both gazed up at the frail, pale little girl on the high seat and smiled. ""Well, Father, you brought her, I see,"" remarked the brunette. She approached the wagon, extending her arms to the child. ""Come on, Betsy, let's get you some supper,"" she said warmly, as if Elizabeth Ann had always been there. Aunt Abigail, the plump, rosy-cheeked lady, took Elizabeth Ann's cold hand in hers and led her inside. ""I'm your Aunt Abigail, your mother's aunt,"" she introduced.

Aunt Abigail suddenly paused in her rush, placing a butter-plate on the table. She surprised Elizabeth Ann by revealing a drowsy kitten from under the stove. Aunt Abigail, overwhelmed with chores, suggested Elizabeth Ann care for the kitten. Overjoyed, Elizabeth Ann gently held the warm, furry kitten. The kitten, with a yawn, playfully pawed at Elizabeth Ann's blouse. Elizabeth Ann, thrilled, lifted the kitten, feeling its soft fur. The kitten licked her hand, melting Elizabeth Ann's heart. She asked Aunt Abigail for the kitten's name but received no response. As Elizabeth Ann watched the kitten lap milk, Cousin Ann and Uncle Henry arrived for supper. Despite Elizabeth Ann's surprise at the lack of supper preparation, they all enjoyed a hearty meal.

The sun rose higher, and Elizabeth Ann felt hungrier. She realized she could dress without help. She found her way downstairs, greeted by Cousin Ann ironing.

Potted plants lined the windowsill, filling the room with light and color.

At one end of the room was the kitchen stove, shiny black, with a tea-kettle on it, a big hot-water boiler nearby, and a large kitchen cabinet full of drawers and shelves. In the middle was the table where they had supper, and at the other end, a table with an old dark-red shawl on it. A big lamp stood in the middle, a bookcase nearby, and a sofa against the wall where a snoring dog named Shep lay. Cousin Ann suggested washing the dishes, having an apple, and exploring the house. Elizabeth Ann, feeling embarrassed and shy, washed the dishes for the first time. She was puzzled by the odd remarks made by Cousin Ann but slowly began to grasp the humor in them, marking the first time she recognized humor in her life.|['1.

Elizabeth Ann explored the house, munching on a delicious red apple. Each bite filled her with joy, making her want more. The rooms were simple, with low ceilings, old furniture, and bright rag rugs. She was relieved there was no piano to practice on, as she didn't enjoy her music lessons. Cousin Ann welcomed her back to the cozy kitchen, where Elizabeth Ann warmed up by the stove. Curious about Aunt Abigail, she ventured downstairs to find her churning butter. Aunt Abigail was surprised that Elizabeth Ann had never seen butter-making before. Uncle Henry joked about how everyone has different experiences, just like how Elizabeth Ann knew about asphalt pavement from her school route.

Elizabeth Ann observed a peculiar black wagon that spread a dark substance on the road. Uncle Henry, intrigued, asked how they kept the material hot without it hardening. Elizabeth Ann, puzzled, suggested a fire. Aunt Abigail then showed her how butter was made. Elizabeth Ann, engrossed in the process, eagerly watched as the cream separated into buttermilk and golden particles. She assisted in churning and washing the butter, amazed by the amount produced. When offered to shape the butter into a pat, she struggled, realizing her lack of experience in manual tasks. It was a novel and challenging experience for Elizabeth Ann, who had only been accustomed to academic and musical activities before her stay at Putney Farm.|['1.

Aunt Abigail laughed as she effortlessly shaped the butter into a smooth yellow ball with a paddle, reminiscing about her own childhood experiences. Elizabeth Ann, initially puzzled, suddenly realized the historical significance of the moment. The mention of the Declaration of Independence by Aunt Abigail sparked a new understanding in Elizabeth Ann's mind, making her realize that real people lived during that time and passed down traditions. This revelation lingered in her thoughts, even as she got called for dinner. As she proudly carried the butter upstairs, she encountered a large dog, Shep, who initially scared her but then obediently retreated at Cousin Ann's command. This day was filled with unexpected lessons and surprises for Elizabeth Ann.|"['1. What did Aunt Abigail shape with a paddle?\nA) Pancakes\nB) Bread\nC) Butter\nD) Cheese\nE) Jam', ""2.

Aunt Abigail, who had just climbed the stairs, panting, said, between laughing and puffing: “I’m glad I’m not an animal on this farm. Ann does boss them around so.” “Well, SOMEbody has to!” said Cousin Ann, advancing on the table with a platter. This proved to have chicken fricassee on it, and Elizabeth Ann’s heart melted in her at the smell. She loved chicken gravy on hot biscuits beyond anything in the world, but chickens are so expensive when you buy them in the market that Aunt Harriet hadn’t had them very often for dinner. And there was a plate of biscuits, golden brown, just coming out of the oven! She sat down very quickly, her mouth watering, and attacked with extreme haste the big plateful of food which Cousin Ann passed her. At Aunt Harriet’s she had always been aware that everybody watched her anxiously as she ate, and she had heard so much about her light appetite that she felt she must live up to her reputation, and had a very natural and human hesitation about eating all she wanted when there happened to be something she liked very much. But nobody here knew that she “only ate enough to keep a bird alive,” and that her “appetite was SO capricious!” Nor did anybody notice her while she stowed away the chicken and gravy and hot biscuits and currant jelly and baked potatoes and apple pie—when did Elizabeth Ann ever eat|"[""1.

Aunt Abigail chuckled, causing Uncle Henry and Cousin Ann to join in. Even old Shep, the dog, wagged his tail with a big dog-smile, creating a cheerful atmosphere. After dinner, Cousin Ann realized Elizabeth Ann might be late for school and hurried her to get ready. Despite feeling scared of going to school alone, Elizabeth Ann was comforted with a sugar-cookie from Aunt Abigail. As she was led towards the door, Elizabeth Ann was in a state of panic. She had never gone to school alone before, and the idea terrified her. However, she found herself walking down the road as instructed.

Elizabeth Ann walked along the path, her mind filled with rebellion, fear, and hurt feelings. She was determined not to go back to Putney Farm, where she felt misunderstood and unloved. As she contemplated getting lost until nightfall, a young girl called out to her. The girl, wearing a gingham dress and a white apron, mentioned that Cousin Ann had said Betsy was coming to school that day and had been waiting for her. She led Betsy into a cozy room with geraniums at the windows where a dozen children of various ages sat behind their desks. Betsy was initially shy and frightened, but as she observed the other children looking just as nervous, her curiosity was piqued.

She found her cousin Ann making maple syrup in a cozy hut. Despite her distress, her cousin compared exams to taking dares and offered her a cup of syrup to lift her spirits.

Elizabeth left, puzzled by the conversation. She pondered over her failure in the exam. Outside, she prepared the syrup on a snow bed under a pine tree.

Elizabeth Ann held her cup, pouring the thick, hot syrup onto the snow, creating loops and curves. As it stiffened, she lifted a coil, savoring the concentrated sweetness of summer. With a mix of hot and icy flavors, she crunched it into a lump, enjoying the treat dreamily. Her gaze wandered to Hemlock Mountain's golden snow in the sunlight. Uncle Henry promised a trip once the snow melted. She wondered about the mountain's top, where one could see so much. Amid her thoughts, old Shep nudged her, seeking his share. She shared the waxed sugar, watching him enjoy it. As dusk fell, the mountain's grandeur loomed larger. Betsy finished her treat, feeling at peace under the mountain's watchful presence.

Betsy frantically scanned her surroundings. A large pine tree limb, dried and bare, caught her eye. It resembled a ladder. Inspired, she called down to Molly in the pit, instructing her to find shelter. Betsy used a stick as a lever to dislodge the branch. After much effort, she managed to move it to the pit's edge. With a sigh of relief, she pushed it down, creating a safe way for Molly to climb out. Molly, agile like a squirrel, ascended the branch with Betsy's help.

Betsy was interrupted by a poke in her ribs and turned to see Ralph scowling at her while doing math. He had cleaned up ’Lias at the boys’ wading spot.

That afternoon, the children gathered at the schoolhouse, hopeful for the event. The girls looked fresh in their neat dresses and ribbons, while the boys were self-conscious in their suits. However, little ’Lias was missing. They waited, but he didn't show up. Uncle Henry decided to leave for town on a straw-ride. Suddenly, they heard sobbing from the woodshed. Rushing back, they found ’Lias in tears, dressed in his old overalls. He had lost his new clothes to his stepfather for alcohol. Ralph was furious, wanting to confront the stepfather.

"They saw little Elias once more, for the final time. Mr. Pond's buggy swiftly passed their slow-moving hay-wagon, with Elias sitting close beside him, his lap filled with toys like a Christmas surprise - a toy train, a stuffed dog, a candy-box, picture-books, tops, and more.

On the day of Betsy's birthday, she and her plump cousin Molly went to the county fair. Molly looked adorable in a white dress, and Betsy, in a pink-and-white gingham dress, sat at the front with Mr. Wendell while Molly sat at the back with Mrs. Wendell. Betsy marveled at how nice Molly looked. Later, as they explored the fair, they stumbled upon a clear mirror. Betsy was surprised to see her reflection looking so different from what she remembered. She saw a browned, muscular girl standing tall, holding Molly's hand. It took her a moment to realize that the reflection was her own. The girls then got distracted by a big doll and forgot about the mirror as they enjoyed the fair's attractions. They met the Wendells for lunch, each sharing their fair experiences. Betsy and Molly then planned how to spend their remaining twenty cents, with Betsy buying a toy dog that unfortunately didn't bark as promised.|"[""1.

Betsy and Molly had just ten cents left and decided to enjoy a ride on the merry-go-round. However, Betsy, checking the clock in Agricultural Hall's tower, saw it was already half-past two. Concerned about heading home, she went to find Will Vaughan at the booth. To her surprise, Will was not there, but a new, unfamiliar young man with flashy attire was. Unhelpful and whistling, he claimed to not know Will Vaughan. Another man nearby mentioned that the Vaughans had to rush home due to a sick cow. Panicked, Betsy grabbed Molly's hand, realizing they needed to find the Wendells before they left. Running to the horse-shed, they discovered it empty. With only ten cents and no food, the girls faced a daunting eight-mile journey back to Putney Farm, feeling lost and scared among the bustling crowd.|"[""1.

The young girl's head spun. She tried to recall what Cousin Ann would do in such a situation, but it didn't provide much help as she couldn't fathom Ann's reaction. However, she was certain of one thing - Cousin Ann would calm Molly down first. With determination, she sat on the ground, hugged Molly, wiped her tears, and assured her that everything would be alright. Despite her own fears, she pretended to be mysterious and promised a surprise to cheer Molly up. As they walked through the bustling fair, Betsy tried to figure out how to earn money. They passed by a sign advertising a chicken dinner, but it was already over. Betsy gathered her courage, remembering Cousin Ann's resilience, and marched forward with Molly, determined to find a way home.|"['1.

Betsy and Molly strolled through the lively crowd, with Molly amused by the antics of the young people. Betsy, however, felt grim as she realized it was four o’clock, and they had only two hours left to catch the last train to Hillsboro, but lacked the money for tickets. Feeling breathless and overwhelmed, Betsy paused to catch her breath. Suddenly, a pretty girl with yellow hair and blue eyes, resembling a grown-up Molly, offered Betsy a job washing dishes at a booth.

Molly, unaware that anything was wrong since Betsy had taken over, simply nodded and asked if she could sit on a barrel to watch the passing crowd. Suddenly, a customer arrived to buy doughnuts!

Eleanor didn't quite grasp girl talk like Betsy understood cat language. Betsy was making a cozy nest when she noticed Eleanor missing. She found Eleanor dragging a chubby kitten, struggling not to hit his feet on stones. Betsy scolded Eleanor for not trusting her to help. Later, Uncle Henry brought warm milk, and Betsy let the kittens drink. The kittens comically struggled to drink the milk, with one walking through the saucer and the other sneezing when he dipped his head in too far. Eleanor then drank up all the milk, ending the lesson. In the evening, Eleanor settled with the kittens, and they all found comfort together. Eleanor even bravely confronted a dog, amusing everyone.
