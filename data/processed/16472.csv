The boy, Nick, had to run errands in Dunbarton, making him an hour late to start his journey back home.

In the vast area where they searched, many parts were rarely visited by hunters. Long ago, deer were occasionally shot, and settlers reminisced about thrilling bear hunts. The searchers feared encountering these beasts in the deep, gloomy woods. They worried that poor Nellie might have fallen into the creek or pond. Nick's whistle echoed through the trees, but they found no sign of her. The lanterns illuminated the path, casting eerie shadows. As they heard a wagon approaching, the friends split up to search more effectively. Despite their efforts, the night was slipping away, and Nellie remained missing.

The group, led by Mr. Ribsam, decided to stay together as they searched for Nellie. The weather was mild and pleasant, a relief to all. The mother, consumed by worry for her child, would have been distraught if the weather had turned. She recounted a moment when Nellie, despite being ill, refused water from her brother and insisted her mother hand it to her. The mother, wanting to be firm, refused, causing regret later. At Shark Creek, they found Nellie's lunch basket with a piece of bread she had eaten. The group, with lanterns in hand, peered over the bridge, hoping not to find Nellie's body in the water below.

"All the children were eager to trust the statement, and no one voiced any disagreement. Since nothing was visible or informative where they were standing, they crossed the bridge and descended the wooded hill until they reached the stream's edge, which wound its way through the forest to the large pond. ""It is indeed peculiar; if there was no water in the creek, you could be certain the child hadn't fallen from it, but since she couldn't have done so without drowning, I am inclined to think--"" Both sensed that if the body was floating anywhere, they couldn't miss it, although it was likely far below them, and would likely be discovered first by the parents and brother. In an attempt to clarify, he gestured to the damp soil where no vegetation grew: it was directly in front and close to the water, the portion that was frequently swept by the creek when above its current level. Although Nellie Ribsam was just eight years old when she disappeared in the vast forest, the effects of the education she received from her wise parents were evident on that unforgettable day. She had been taught, along with her brother, that she must rely on herself to succeed in life. Nick was seldom allowed to offer her any assistance with her studies, and she was made aware that anything she could do had to be done independently.

Mr. Herbert Watrous carefully aimed his rifle, adjusting his sights until he was satisfied. As they decided to split up, Herbert kept on the same path, Sam veered right, and Nick went left. The atmosphere was serene, with crows cawing in the distance and birds soaring overhead. Sam stumbled upon a quail and tried to shoot it but missed. The debate over whether it was a quail or a partridge amused him. Sam reloaded his gun, always prepared for action. He wished he had a Remington rifle like Herbert's. Sam realized the value of a well-trained hunting dog like Bowser. As he approached a cabin in a clearing, a woman welcomed him warmly, offering him a seat made of white mountain ash.

During a short stay in a humble cabin, Sam Harper learned a valuable lesson in cheerfulness and contentment. The husband of the woman who owned the cabin worked for a farmer four miles away, receiving scant wages. He walked the distance every day, rain or shine, happy with his life. The cabin was left by wood-choppers and was rent-free. Sam felt grateful for the lesson he learned about appreciating what he had. The man had been sick for six months but recovered, thanks to his wife's care and the doctor's help. Sam declined an invitation out of consideration for the couple's hospitality. While resting near a limestone rock, Sam's dog, Bowser, alerted him to a rattlesnake, saving him from a deadly bite.

While walking through the woods, Herbert encountered a squirrel and reflected on his shooting skills. He realized he needed to improve his marksmanship and felt more confident after successfully shooting the squirrel. However, his thoughts turned to a more serious matter - encountering a bear. Herbert knew his single-shot gun might not be enough to fend off a bear. As he continued on the path, he came across a fallen tree and decided to rest. Suddenly, he heard a growl and saw a pair of frightening eyes - it was the bear. With trembling hands, Herbert aimed his gun at the bear, fired, and quickly reloaded in case he needed another shot. The tense situation left Herbert hoping his aim was true and that his gun wouldn't fail him.|"['1.

Herbert felt eager to reunite with his friends, unsure if the bear still lurked nearby despite his mistaken shot at a stump. Following a path toward the meeting spot, a distant light signaled the camp's proximity. Sam, uneasy over Nick's silence, knew they must signal if separated. Nick, investigating Herbert's earlier shot, doubted his accuracy. As he neared the spot, a rustling revealed the buck, oblivious to Nick's presence. Startled, Nick fired, hitting the deer but not fatally. The buck charged, leaving Nick no escape. Bracing for impact, Nick swung his rifle, aiming to defend against the enraged animal's charge.|"[""1.

The boy was struck with great force by the buck, causing him to lose his grip on the gun and sending him flying several feet away. This was the most shocking experience of his life, knocking the breath out of him and disorienting him. The antlers of the buck nearly drove him into a fallen tree, which would have been fatal. Fortunately, he got entangled and fell just short of hitting the tree. The buck tried to dislodge him but failed due to the tree blocking his path. After regaining consciousness, the boy slowly moved away from the tree, examining himself for injuries. He then found the dead body of the buck and realized he had strayed off course.

Many people get lost in the wilderness because they favor one side of their body over the other. This leads them off course unless they have a landmark to guide them. Nick realized he was lost when he saw Sam's campfire. Sam and Bowser, the hound, had been looking for Nick. Bowser, showing signs of distress, led the boys to a spot in the woods. The boys followed Bowser with torches and guns, ready for any danger. Herbert's torch almost went out, but he kept it going. Suddenly, a wild hog charged at them.

"In 1881, a peculiar event known as the ""dark day"" occurred in New England, notably in Massachusetts. The atmosphere turned a strange greenish-yellow, dimming the sunlight and causing people to light lamps during the day. Many believed it was the Day of Judgment. However, like Abraham Davenport, who stood firm in his duty during a similar event in 1780, some remained steadfast. The day was marked by an eerie light, with no shadows, due to forest fires in the region. Nick Ribsam, a twelve-year-old, lived through a similar dark day in 1881, amidst forest fires. When Nellie and Nick set out to deliver money to James Bradley, the peculiar atmosphere and recent drought were a topic of discussion."|"['1.

There was smoke everywhere; the air was hot and hard to breathe. The crackling of flames and flashes of red through the haze showed a fierce forest fire all around them.

The boy quickly removed his hat, vest, shoes, and socks, leaving only his shirt and pants before diving into the cold water. He enjoyed the refreshing feeling as he splashed around. Despite his sister being safe, he couldn't resist playing in the water. He dove down, touched the bottom, and shot back up. However, he noticed the darkness increasing and strong winds blowing.

Nick and Nellie found themselves in a scary situation when a bear unexpectedly jumped onto their raft. Nellie, unable to swim, relied on her brother to navigate them to safety. The bear's weight caused the raft to sink, but the distraction allowed Nick to swim to shore with Nellie. Fortunately, the bear was not as aggressive as they feared, likely fleeing from a nearby forest fire. Once ashore, they saw the bear disappear through the smoke. Nellie, soaked but unharmed, longed for dry clothes. Nick, always prepared, even saved their shoes.

The boy desperately hoped the scorching earth would deter the beast from chasing him too fiercely, but it did not. With no other option, he sprinted to a sapling and climbed it swiftly like a monkey.
