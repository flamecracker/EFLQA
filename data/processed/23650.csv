Nicholas and his army eagerly entered the prosperous city of Genoa, surprising its inhabitants with their determination to rescue the Holy Land. The fair-haired children, once a mighty army of twenty thousand, were now reduced to seven thousand, the strongest and most resolute. The city was captivated by their presence as merchants left their desks, children paused their play, and nobles were moved to surprise. The Senators initially welcomed them but later retracted their hospitality due to fear of moral impact, potential famine, and political alliances. The children were allowed only one night before they were to leave. Despite their disappointment, some decided to stay in Genoa while others chose to continue their journey to the promised land.

Defeat had arrived, and the army leader felt the weight of disgrace upon his shoulders. Tempted by a nobleman from Genoa offering a life of luxury, Nicholas abandoned his comrades. He traded his honor for comfort, leaving his followers disheartened. While they mourned his loss, Nicholas enjoyed his new lavish lifestyle. The abandoned army, now without a leader, pressed on to Pisa and later Rome. The Pope commended their zeal but advised against further attempts to reach the Holy Land. The children, bound by their Crusader oath, returned home broken and disheartened. Meanwhile, Stephen gathered a diverse army of thirty thousand children in Vendome, ready to embark on their perilous journey with hymns and crosses as their only weapons.

Amid songs and applause, a group of young people left Vendome, inspired by their leader Stephen. He spoke to them often with stirring words to keep their spirits high. The journey was easier than expected, and the group's enthusiasm was fueled by Stephen's zeal. However, the march became chaotic as discipline waned, and Stephen's authority diminished. Deceived by false promises of reaching the sea, the group dwindled to only a few thousand. When they finally reached Marseilles and saw the sea, hope was renewed. The city welcomed them, and despite the dwindling numbers, their determination remained strong. Stephen, facing the reality of his failed promises, stood before his followers, who now saw him as a false leader. Only five thousand remained of the once-imposing army.|"[""1.

"In the bustling streets of Marseilles, a sudden turn of events lifted the spirits of the discouraged followers.

His followers, initially disheartened, were inspired by his unwavering faith. Stephen recounted how two merchants from Marseilles had offered vessels to transport the Crusaders to Palestine without seeking any payment, only desiring blessings in return. The vessels were swiftly prepared, and amidst cheers, the young Crusaders embarked. As the ships set sail, the air resonated with hymns of courage. However, the journey was fraught with peril. Two ships were lost in a storm, and the survivors discovered a treacherous betrayal. The merchants who aided them were slave traders who sold the children into slavery.

Saul was astonished by the bravery of David, a young shepherd who faced the mighty Goliath without armor or sword. David, undeterred, selected five smooth stones from a brook, carefully choosing them. Armed only with a sling, he confronted Goliath, who mocked him for his youth. David, however, declared he fought in the name of the Lord, predicting his victory over Goliath. With a single stone, David struck Goliath between the eyes, defeating the giant. The Israelites pursued the fleeing Philistines in triumph. Saul, amazed by David's courage, appointed him as his armor-bearer. Jonathan, Saul's son, admired David and formed a deep friendship with him. Despite Saul's growing jealousy, David's popularity soared as he proved his wisdom and leadership.

When David faced Goliath, he was promised Saul's daughter's hand in marriage if he won. Saul remembered this promise and offered Merab, his daughter, to David. But Saul changed his mind, and Merab married another man. Michal, Saul's younger daughter, admired David and wanted to marry him. Saul agreed, hoping David would die fighting the Philistines. David accepted to marry Michal. Saul planned to kill David out of jealousy, so Jonathan warned David to hide. Saul sent men to arrest David, but Michal helped him escape.

For many months, the _Essex_ sailed across the Atlantic under Captain Porter's command, capturing English vessels like the _Alert_. One night, young Farragut thwarted a mutiny attempt by the _Alert's_ coxswain. As the journey continued, provisions ran low, and the crew endured harsh weather and hardships. After rounding Cape Horn, they cruised the Pacific, capturing more ships and surviving on meager rations. At an island near Chile, they hunted for food and replenished supplies. Farragut impressed Captain Porter, who entrusted him with commanding a captured English vessel to Valparaiso at just twelve years old. Despite initial resistance, Farragut's leadership prevailed.

Two months later, when the _Essex_ was peacefully anchored in Valparaiso's harbor, and many of her crew were ashore, two English warships ominously approached. Captain Porter feared an attack, which was unjust as neither England nor America were at war with Chili, making the American vessel safe in that port. One of the English ships, _The Phoebe_, and the other, _The Cherub_, anchored at the harbor's entrance, trapping the _Essex_. During a storm, the _Essex_ drifted towards the English ships, prompting Captain Porter to attempt an escape. Unfortunately, the main topmast collapsed, rendering the _Essex_ helpless. The English vessels, out of reach of most of the _Essex_'s guns, bombarded her for two and a half hours, resulting in the loss of many crew members, including the brave midshipman David Farragut.

At sixteen, Farragut faced a setback when a sunstroke weakened his eyes. He later joined a fleet to combat pirates in the West Indies.
