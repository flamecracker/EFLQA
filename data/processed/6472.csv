Mr. Hardy took his family below deck for safety, promising the girls a peek later. Charley and Hubert faced the storm against the bulwark, struggling to see through the spray and wind.

Our young settlers embarked on an adventure to the Pampas of La Plata. They savored the thrill of their first foreign land encounter and marveled at the grandeur of Rio's harbor during their Atlantic voyage. Upon reaching Buenos Ayres, where the Uruguay and Parana rivers converge into the La Plata river, they anchored. The flat shores initially disappointed them after Rio's magnificence. The captain's boat ferried him ashore, returning with a warm welcome letter from Mr. Hardy's friend, who had settled nearby. The high tide allowed them to land without carts, greeted by Mr. Thompson. The group set off for Mr. Thompson's estancia, with Mrs. Hardy and Ethel opting for the carriage, while the others rode horses.

Once they left the town, the horses started to move faster, breaking into a canter, as the road was smooth enough for the carriage to go at full speed. They passed the grand homes of wealthy merchants, marveling at the lush gardens filled with fragrant orange and lemon trees, towering palms, and vibrant flowers. The children were thrilled by the sight of large butterflies and hummingbirds flitting around. Eventually, they ventured into the countryside, where expansive plains stretched out, some cultivated, others covered in green grass and colorful wildflowers. Herds of horses and cattle dotted the landscape, with estancias scattered across the fields. The journey was enjoyable until the last few miles, where the rough road caused discomfort. Upon arrival at Mr. Thompson's estancia, they were warmly greeted by Mrs. Thompson, who welcomed them to their picturesque home surrounded by tropical trees and a spacious veranda. The evening continued with a delightful dinner, served by an Italian servant, followed by a stroll around the estate as darkness fell. The family discussed their English friends, the voyage, and the promising prospects of the country.

"""Don't worry, Maud,"" her father reassured her, chuckling at her disappointment. ""You won't be deprived of your hard work, I promise. Mrs. Thompson can attest that this place was very different when she first arrived."" ""Indeed,"" Mrs. Thompson chimed in with a smile. ""It was quite desolate when we settled here.

Mr. Hardy then embarked on a journey to find a suitable province, leaving the boys to learn the ropes. They eagerly embraced the outdoors, riding all day, resembling young gauchos with their sun-kissed skin and colorful attire. Mr. Hardy returned after a month, thrilled to announce the purchase of a property on a river near Rosario.

The land near Rosario was bought by Mr. Hardy at a low price due to being on the outskirts of the settlements where Indians occasionally caused trouble by taking livestock. Despite the risks, Mr. Hardy believed the land was a good investment, anticipating its value to increase significantly in the future as the area developed. He was confident in his ability to defend against potential Indian attacks and protect his family and animals. He planned to be well-prepared and armed, minimizing the risk.

Charley and Hubert earned praise from Mr. Percy. They were robust teenagers, appearing older than their actual ages. They swiftly packed the luggage into two bullock carts and set off to Mr. Percy's station, located midway to Mr. Hardy's camp. In the pampas, a camp signifies a station or property. Mr. Percy had efficiently completed the tasks assigned by Mr. Hardy. He acquired bullock carts, oxen, riding horses, milch cows, and livestock. Additionally, he hired capable men including a stock-keeper named Lopez, a German laborer named Hans, an Irishman called Terence Kelly, and an American carpenter. The boys were thrilled to venture into the pampas and laughed heartily as their group moved along, led by the livestock and carts. Lopez cracked his whip, driving the animals forward, while Hans and Terence managed the bullock carts.

The initial task was to place the posts in the ground and construct a wire fence to enclose the animals at night. Five posts were to be placed on each side, ten yards apart, totaling eighteen posts. The remaining posts would be used to create a division between the sheep and cattle. Without this separation, some animals might wander back to their former home at night. A suitable location was swiftly chosen between the house and the stream. The distance was measured and marked, while Hans carried the heavy posts down. The soil was soft and the holes were dug quickly. By sunset, the wire fence was up, and the animals were secured. A small shelter was also constructed for Mr. Hardy and his sons. The next morning, work continued with the construction of two huts. Rushes were cut from the stream, and the huts were swiftly assembled. By dinner, the work was done, and the huts were ready for use. Mr. Hardy and his sons moved into one hut, while the others took the second. The boys enjoyed a comfortable night in their new home.

In the vast green plain, the Hardy family encountered two swift ostriches, chased by dogs and horsemen. The chase was intense as the creatures sprinted ahead. The gaucho, Lopez, skillfully used unique bullets to capture one ostrich. Meanwhile, the dogs bravely faced a puma that leaped out, engaging in a fierce battle. Mr. Hardy swiftly ended the conflict with a well-aimed shot. The puma, similar in color to the mastiffs, was a powerful yet inferior creature to the African lion. Lopez identified it as a large puma, emphasizing its rare size. The family's adventure showcased the diverse wildlife and the importance of respect for nature's balance.|"['1.

Mr. Hardy checked on the dogs first. Prince had a shoulder injury from the puma, and both dogs had scratches. Flora saved Prince by grabbing the puma's neck. They decided to go home to treat Prince's wound. Lopez stayed to skin the puma, and the rest headed back. The dogs' wounds were cleaned, and Prince's shoulder was bandaged. Leaving most dogs behind, they took the retrievers for a walk by the river. They brought a horse to carry the game. They learned that early morning or evening was best for hunting. They returned with a swan, geese, and ducks. The next day, carts were sent for fence materials. They explored the property and built a storehouse. The fence was six feet high with wires close together, making it hard to climb. The gate had iron and pointed palings for added security. The group felt prepared to defend against an attack. Carts were sent for wood to build the house. Hubert went with them to learn. The house plan was discussed, with a sitting room, kitchen, bedrooms, and space for servants.|"[""1.

Near the kitchen, a small tower with two floors was planned, ten feet square. The lower room for laundry, the upper for storage. A flat roof with a three-foot parapet would offer views for miles and defense. Walls of adobe, sun-baked brick partitions. Before building, Mr. Hardy learned of a stock sale 20 miles west. He left for five days, leaving the boys to make bricks. They cleared ground, made molds, trampled mud, and formed bricks. They dried the bricks in the sun. One day, a snake almost bit Charley, but Hubert saved him by smashing it with a wet brick. The boys assisted their father in buying sheep, cattle, and horses. Mr. Hardy praised the boys' work and assigned tasks for the future: cultivating the land, tending to livestock, and finishing the well. Walls were to be made directly from mud, dried by the sun.|['1.

In two weeks, the walls were completed, and carts were sent to Rosario for lime to plaster the inside walls. The land was plowed and planted with maize, yam, pumpkins, and potato seeds. The walls were built with bricks after the return of the carts. Mr. Hardy decided to use tiles for the roof instead of thatching due to Indian attacks. The house was finished with whitewashed walls, a leveled clay and lime floor, and a tower made of bricks. A fire was lit in the chimney, and the family enjoyed a meal of mutton and wild fowl. Mr. Hardy left to bring back Mrs. Hardy and the girls, while the boys worked on carpentry. They built tables, benches, shelves, and dressers. When the family reunited, the boys noticed the girls' bitten faces and advised them on dealing with mosquitoes.|"['1.

The group had a rough night despite using sheets to shield themselves from the discomfort. They were eager to start their ride to Mr. Percy's estate before dawn. Sarah rode in a bullock cart while the others rode horses. Terence made a shade for Sarah from branches to protect her from the sun, which pleased her. The group was at ease riding, having practiced regularly. Mr. Hardy warned about armadillo holes. They met Mr. Percy halfway, who welcomed them warmly. The girls inquired about mosquitoes. The boys woke early, shot a swan and ducks, and prepared breakfast. They awaited the travelers, who were excited upon arrival. The boys had cooked a delicious breakfast.

By ten o'clock, Sarah and the luggage arrived on carts, and the afternoon was spent setting up bedsteads and organizing everything. Mosquito curtains were hung, protecting from bloodsuckers. Sunday was a day of rest. Mr. Hardy led prayers, seeking God's blessings. The family explored the area, including the storehouse and the river. Mr. Hardy proposed a dam for irrigation, explaining its benefits. The boys eagerly agreed, and work on the dam began the next day. Mrs. Hardy suggested naming the place Mount Pleasant. The dam construction involved wheelbarrows and puddled earth. A sluice was installed to regulate water flow. The final operation sealed the dam successfully. Meanwhile, the boys built a churn and improved the house. The girls made butter, and everyone enjoyed better meals.|"['1.

After the dam was completed, Hans, a wanderer at heart, expressed his wish to leave. Mr. Hardy, wanting to reduce his workforce now that the heavy work was done, allowed Hans to depart without notice. With high wages and concerns about potential Indian raids, Mr. Hardy kept only a few workers - Lopez, Seth, Terence, and two peons. Seth, a Yankee, surprised Mr. Hardy by staying longer than expected. He had grown fond of the children and seemed especially interested in the girls. Seth was usually a man of few words, a trait likely developed from a life of solitude and danger. However, he would share stories of his Indian encounters with the young ones in the evenings. When asked about his closest call to death, Seth reflected on a harrowing experience in Mexico during the fighting in 1847. He and his comrade Rube Pearson, renowned scouts, faced perilous skirmishes with Mexican partisans. Seth admired Rube's immense strength and speculated about a mythical strongman named Samson.|"[""1.

I didn't entirely enjoy the job. It was far from the main office, and, no matter how hard they tried, two men couldn't fight more than ten or twelve. Rube seemed to like it, which surprised me. Later that night, I learned what pleased him. 'Exactly, Seth,' he chuckled. We decided to be good friends. She invited me to visit her at her small hacienda near town. The Mexican women despised us more than the men did, and many of our comrades had been lured and killed. Despite this, I didn't oppose Rube's wishes. The next morning, we arrived at the hacienda. A Mexican girl greeted us. 'Ah, American sir, it's you. I should have known,' she smiled. She welcomed us in, and we followed her to the shed. We entered the house, and Pepita and Rube started talking. I felt uneasy due to the old woman's glares. After a nap, I heard Rube and Pepita planning her escape to join him. Suddenly, armed Mexicans stormed in through the window and shots were fired.|"['1.

I hurried to grab my rifle, but it was knocked from my hand before I could aim it. I was quickly overpowered and taken prisoner without a fight. The group that captured us was from El Zeres' band, called by Pepita, who was married to another chief. They teased us about our romantic interests. I was frustrated with myself for being caught so easily. While lost in thought, I noticed Rube, who had been playing dead, suddenly spring into action. He swiftly took down a few men and escaped through a window. Despite the chaos, I felt relieved to see him alive.

We were instructed to sit on the ground in a corner of the room, guarded closely by two individuals. A heated debate ensued about our future, with some advocating for immediate execution while others preferred delivering us to El Zeres himself. The chief harbored a grudge against us for being skilled scouts who had evaded him in the past. Despite the grim situation, we maintained composure to not reveal fear. Pepita, though hostile, entered the room and engaged with us. Rube, unfazed, bantered with her, causing laughter among the men. Pepita, infuriated, struck Rube, prompting him to joke about a kiss. The situation escalated when she brandished a knife, but was restrained by others. We were closely monitored until the early hours, then mounted on horses to be taken to El Zeres, approximately twenty-five miles away.|"['1.

We rode into camp around nine o'clock, realizing it was well-hidden for a surprise attack. The camp was on a slight mound, nearly circular, with El Zeres' band of around four hundred men. They had military order, sleeping around fires in a circle with horses picketed nearby. In the center stood a small house. As we neared the chief's hut, we saw him preparing to leave with a fierce-looking companion. El Zeres, the bloodthirsty leader, had a cruel smile.

The incident unfolded as a Mexican swiftly snatched a lasso from El Zeres' horse and ensnared Rube, who displayed immense strength in his struggle.

The Mexican lieutenant, Pedro, ordered the men to clear the hut and dispose of the dead. The hut had two rooms with minimal light, constructed from stones and mud.

I never felt more defeated than when I sat surrounded by the men, unable to escape. Rube, exhausted, suggested resting before planning our escape. We demanded water until they finally provided some.

As darkness enveloped the room, a fire crackled in the center. The guards barred the door, checking on us every few minutes with a torch to ensure our separation. Strategizing our escape, I whispered to my companion about the timing and precautions. After loosening our bonds, we waited for the right moment.

We retreated to our positions as planned, and the Mexicans, armed with knives, charged forward bravely. They fought fiercely, realizing they were trapped. Rube and I showed no mercy. Dividing their forces, three attackers targeted each of us. Two fell swiftly to my rifle, but a commotion made me turn to see Rube in trouble. His rifle had slipped from his grasp, leaving him vulnerable. I swiftly neutralized his assailants and then turned to aid Rube. The remaining foes tried to reach their rifles, left unguarded by me. I swiftly subdued them. After a brief struggle, we emerged victorious, with eleven adversaries defeated.

Seth and Rube were on the run, trying to escape from horsemen and their tracking dog. They knew they had to be smart to outwit the pursuers. They ran zigzag to confuse the dog's scent, even resorting to cutting Seth's arm and leaving a blood-soaked sleeve behind to throw off the dog. The plan worked, and they managed to gain some distance. Running under the stars, they pushed themselves, knowing they needed to keep moving to stay ahead. The chase was intense, but their determination and quick thinking gave them a fighting chance to evade capture.

We had been running for what felt like ages, almost at our limit, when we reached a stream. The water was not too deep, just a couple of feet, but wide enough to slow us down. As we caught our breath, we heard the sound of horses approaching along the stream. We knew if they had the dog and were on our side, we were in trouble. Rube suggested we stop running and face them, hoping to take out the first four and keep their pistols for ourselves. We estimated we had a half-hour lead, maybe an hour if we were lucky. Our only hope was to find a hacienda for horses as we still had a long way to go to reach safety. With a plan in mind, we continued on, hoping to outsmart our pursuers and make it to safety.|"[""1.

We helped the injured man to stand and urged him to keep moving, making sure the bloodhound was off our trail. We veered off course for a distance to throw off any pursuers, then circled back towards the road. Anticipating the Captain's rendezvous point, we strategized to avoid detection. As daylight broke, we spotted the road and a landmark that indicated Pepita's location. We sought cover in the woods, listening for approaching riders. When they arrived, we surprised them, warning the Captain of imminent danger. The Captain swiftly organized a plan, dividing his men for a strategic ambush. As the enemy approached, we readied our rifles, waiting for the signal to join the skirmish. With a sharp whistle, our comrades charged, trapping the Mexicans between us.

There was a warm farewell, and many expressions of sadness at his departure; after a handshake and good wishes, the young Hardys headed back to the house, truly sad to say goodbye to their American friend. In just two months, the maize and pumpkins had grown remarkably well, with the maize reaching almost six feet in height. This fast growth was due to the fertile soil, recent water supply, and sunlight. The maize required a lot of attention; it had to be thinned out when six inches tall, leaving nine to ten inches between plants. The whole group worked together to thin the maize in just over a week. The maize was now in full bloom after two months. Maize, a staple food in South America and parts of Europe, was introduced to Europe from the East by the Polenta family. The maize stalks bend easily in the wind, but they are strong enough to support the heavy yellow heads due to a unique design where the seeds are placed in a different part of the plant.|['1.

In the Southern States, farmers expect a yield of twelve hundred pounds of cotton from new ground, which equals about three hundred pounds of cleaned cotton. The farmer in the passage plans to experiment by planting tobacco and sugar cane after the cotton. However, before that, a garden near the house needs urgent attention. The farmer decides against growing rice due to the need for swampy conditions, which could lead to health issues like malaria. The passage also describes how the children in the story go bird watching by the river and come up with a plan to capture waterfowl.

In a few days, the ducklings and cygnets were taken down to the dam. The foster-mother hen had to stand on the bank, calling out in vain until the little ones decided to return. A hencoop was quickly built from an old box near the dam. The hens got used to their young charges' love for the water. The girls fed them grain and bits of boiled pumpkin twice a day. The pumpkins had started to bear fruit. The young flamingoes were discovered weeks later by the boys near the river. They found nests with eggs carefully arranged on heaps of earth. The boys decided to take two nests to hatch the young broods simultaneously. The flamingoes' long legs prevented them from sitting on their nests in the usual way, so they sat astride on the earth piles to keep the eggs warm. The sisters were disappointed when the young flamingoes hatched as gray fluffy balls instead of the expected red color. Despite this, the young birds became cherished pets, following the girls around and even approaching the house to be fed. They were unafraid of the dogs and provided constant amusement to the whole family. After cultivating some land, the family focused on creating a garden inside the enclosure around the house. The land was plowed and hand-dug, leaving turf in front of the house as a lawn. Various seeds from England were planted, including peas, beans, tomatoes, and more.

Sometimes the boys traveled to Rosario with a cart, where Mr. Hardy purchased hundreds of young fruit trees like apple, pear, plum, apricot, and peach. Some were planted around the house, while others were placed in the open area. A light fence with a wire was set up to protect the garden from cattle. Young palms, bananas, and tropical trees were also planted for future decoration. Fences were built around the cultivated area, and a pen was made for the cattle at night. The furniture was made from algaroba wood, giving a nice polish. A hen-house was constructed a short distance away, and fifty fowls were brought back. The girls took turns caring for the hens, improving breakfast with fresh eggs and omelets. The girls faced challenges with skunks attacking the hens, leading the boys to set traps to catch them.

Maud and Ethel Hardy, two spirited girls, learned to shoot with light rifles under their father's guidance. They carried the guns strapped to their saddles for easy access during their rides. Initially, they had their guns slung behind them, but the risk of falling and the gun exploding made them switch to the front carry method. The girls practiced diligently and soon outshot their brothers. Dressed in practical attire to combat the local wildlife, they wore wide straw hats, short brown dresses, red flannel knickerbockers, and protective gaiters. The gaiters were essential in a place teeming with snakes. Mr. Hardy ensured his children were always prepared for snake bites, carrying necessary supplies like spirits of ammonia and surgical tools.

The southwest part of their land reached the river directly across from where Mount Pleasant touched it. Their home was about four miles from the Hardys. To the west, two Scottish brothers, Jamieson, owned an estate nine miles away. Behind Senor Jaqueras' estate were the properties of Williams and Markham, about ten miles from Mount Pleasant. The neighbors visited the newcomers soon after their arrival, offering help. The Hardys were pleased with the young, friendly visitors from nearby estates. They established friendly relations, and hammocks were set up for overnight stays. The neighbors often rode back home after visits. The Jamiesons helped during busy times. Sunday services were attended by all friends. Canterbury was a sheep and cattle farm, while the Jamiesons focused on tillage. The Jamiesons faced a setback when Indians stole their animals but showed resilience by starting anew with plows and bullocks. Indian attacks were a concern during certain times of the year.

Mr. Hardy decided to heed Percy's advice about fortifying their home against potential Indian attacks. He realized the vulnerability of their doors and shutters and planned to reinforce them with thin iron sheets. Percy agreed to send the necessary materials promptly. The looming threat of Indian raids made Mr. Hardy uneasy, especially considering the substantial value of his livestock. Despite having some savings in the bank, the potential loss would be significant. Mr. Hardy then shared the situation with his sons, Charley and Hubert, emphasizing the need for caution and preparedness. The boys, differing in their reactions, assured their father of their readiness to defend their home.

They fortified their home with iron plates on doors and windows, creating firing holes for defense. The family remained cautious and followed safety measures. Despite a peaceful fortnight, a sudden gunshot alarmed them. The girls signaled the possible arrival of the Indians. The family prepared to defend their home, staying calm and ready for any potential danger.|['1.

From a distance of six miles, the boys observed a dark mass moving swiftly away, with small dots circling around it. Two miles away, a lone horseman raced frantically, identified by the girls as Lopez. Maud recounted hearing Ethel's urgent call from upstairs, alerting her to the commotion. They spotted the animals nearly four miles away, with a dark mass approaching them rapidly. As the figures neared the animals, a sudden commotion ensued, prompting the beasts to flee. Three dark figures, likely the men, broke away from the group. Lopez managed to escape the pursuit, evading capture despite being chased for a mile. Ethel corroborated Maud's story, noting her suspicion upon seeing the two bodies converging. A man, mentioning the capture of the others by Indians, expressed relief at their escape. Charles detailed how he narrowly evaded the approaching danger, outmaneuvering the pursuing Indians.|['1.

Hubert was about to get off his horse when Mrs. Hardy advised him to ride and meet his father, who might be alarmed by the flag. Hubert galloped off, leaving Maud watching her father from a distance. Mr. Hardy, riding calmly, suddenly stopped as he spotted the flag. He then galloped towards them, carrying his gun for protection. Hubert met him, and they rode back together. Mr. Hardy scolded Lopez for disobeying orders. He instructed the family on safety measures and preparations. After a brief discussion with his wife, Mr. Hardy decided to retrieve their animals. The family packed essentials, lit signals, and prepared weapons before heading out on horseback. Mrs. Hardy, visibly moved, advised the children to stay within the enclosure for safety.

"""Boys, we're on their trail,"" Mr. Hardy stated. ""Your mother timed it - half an hour from alarm to my arrival. It's about half-past twelve now."" Hubert, the tender-hearted boy, felt a wave of sickness at the sight of the dead figures. Mr. Hardy explained, ""We can't rush in. We'll teach them a lesson, show they can't attack us without consequence."" Riding steadily, they followed the trampled path, finding dead sheep along the way. Mr. Hardy checked a sheep's warmth to gauge their distance. ""In Texas, I faced fierce enemies; these Indians are different. Charley, save your horse. We're gaining on them; the dead sheep are closer now. They'll slow down, thinking we're not a threat."" Hubert and Charley rode on, focused on the pursuit."|"[""1.

After riding for another ten minutes, Mr. Hardy got off his horse and noticed that the sheep were warmer, indicating they had not been dead for long. He urged the boys to stay alert as they might spot the enemies ahead. As they crossed a few hills without seeing any foes, upon reaching a higher rise, they saw a group of moving figures in the distance. Mr. Hardy commanded a halt and instructed the boys to prepare for a possible encounter. After observing the enemies from a safe distance, Mr. Hardy concluded that they had stopped for a break, giving their horses time to rest as well. The group took a short meal, and Mr. Hardy advised the boys to eat despite the tension of the situation. They then checked their weapons and gear in anticipation of a possible attack.|['1.

"""Boys, listen up. Stick close to me, watch out for armadillo holes, they're more dangerous than the Indians. Remember, only use the second chamber of your carbines in emergencies. Reload once you've emptied them, but don't shoot until they're charged. Hurrah for old England!"" The boys cheered and rode up the rise. The Indians sprang into action, but Mr. Hardy's group was prepared. As the Indians charged, Mr. Hardy fired with precision, taking down their chief. He instructed the boys to wait and shoot carefully, picking off the attackers. The Indians couldn't hit them from a distance, and soon, most gave up the chase.

"""Now is the time, everyone. When I give the signal to stop, line up and dismount, but aim carefully at the closest target. Make every shot count.

Stop!"" In less than five seconds, Charley fired his carbine. Following his lead, the rest shot their carbines and pistols rapidly. The Indians paused, overwhelmed by the fierce attack, then stopped altogether. This hesitation proved fatal for them. In a little over thirty seconds, eighteen shots rang out. Five Indians were down, another was taken away injured, and two struggled to stay on their horses. The boys realized the fleeing Indians were out of range, but their father, with his precise rifle, took down a horse and its rider. As the sun began to set, the group rested briefly before preparing to face the Indians again. The enemies, aware of their small numbers, remained hidden, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

Just in time, Mr. Hardy noticed the danger. The Indian chief had a plan - twenty of his best men on horseback hid close by, waiting to ambush Mr. Hardy and his sons. As the group passed, the hidden men attacked with guns and arrows. Thankfully, the distance gave them some time. Mr. Hardy's horse and Hubert were hit, but they swiftly rode away. When Mr. Hardy fell off his horse, his sons fought back bravely. Charley's shots took down several Indians, and the boys defended themselves well. After a fierce battle, Mr. Hardy recovered and the boys realized they were more worried about their father than the remaining Indians. They were safe for now, but the threat lingered.|"[""1.

"The Native Americans might return soon, father. Your horse is dead, but one of the Indians' horses is nearby its fallen master. Let's seize it and switch the saddle."" The horse, upon their approach, didn't flee. They noticed that the Indian's foot got tangled in the lasso as he fell, and the horse stayed put. In three minutes, they switched the saddles, ready for action or escape. ""Yes, father; close enough,"" Charley said, checking the compass. They rode two miles west of the camp, planning to head two miles north, tricking the Indians. After a rest, they rode back, keeping west of their path. Mr. Hardy stayed back to watch for any pursuers. The boys, uncomfortable with the plan, agreed to follow orders. Riding cautiously, they used tape to muffle their horses, approaching the enemy's location. Mr. Hardy instructed them to wait until he succeeded in his plan before causing a distraction.

The boys followed their father's orders, riding quietly through the soft turf, straining to hear any sounds. Suddenly, a sheep's distant bleat made them stop. Charley dismounted, while Hubert stayed on his horse, ready for any alarm. They listened intently, holding their carbines at the ready. Meanwhile, their father, Mr. Hardy, carefully approached the herd of cattle, cutting turf to prepare for the signal rocket. With precision, he launched the rocket, lighting up the night sky and scattering the cattle. As the boys joined in the chase, the Indians were too frightened to pursue. When they reunited with their father, they celebrated the successful stampede, knowing the danger was averted for the night.|"[""1.

When they returned from the fields, Mr. and Mrs. Hardy shared a tale of adventure over breakfast. The family's livestock had gone missing, including a group of Indian horses. The animals had been spooked and joined a stampede, explaining the lack of pursuit. Grateful for their safety, the family knelt in prayer before enjoying a hearty breakfast. The story unfolded, revealing a dangerous encounter with the Indians and the brave defense put up by the boys. Tears of relief and pride flowed as the family embraced, grateful for their survival. The community rallied around them, offering support and assistance. Plans were made to sell the captured horses to prevent further conflict. With the threat temporarily subdued, the Hardys could focus on their farm, starting with the sheep-shearing operation.

After the shearing of the cattle, an engaging activity was the branding process. The animals were released one by one into a lane made of hurdles. They were lassoed and brought down to the ground for branding. The hot iron was pressed against their shoulder, causing a reaction of pain and anger. Once branded, the animals were set free to rejoin their herd. Caution was necessary as some animals would charge after being released. Mr. Hardy, confident in his position, invested in agriculture. He expanded the land for cultivation, improved water channels for irrigation, and sowed crops like alfalfa and vegetables. He also planned to enter the dairy business, constructing a dairy with thick walls to maintain cool temperatures. Cows were trained for milking in a specially designed enclosure.|"['1.

One boy cautiously milked the cows, most of which didn't resist. Some cows were unruly but were calmed by securing their legs. Eventually, all cows got used to the milking routine. Peons' wives were taught to milk, more cows were added, totaling fifty in six months. Maud and Ethel managed the fowl-house and dairy. Milk was made into butter and cheese, sent weekly to Buenos Ayres. Mr. Hardy had a cart for transport. Fruit trees thrived, providing abundant peaches, nectarines, and more. Frogs were a nuisance, invading the house. They were caught and released in the stream. Scorpions and centipedes were also troublesome. Brocachas caused havoc, requiring sulfur fumes to remove them. Armadillos, small creatures with protective scales, were common in the area.|"[""1.

The girls were startled when they first encountered an iguana, mistaking it for a crocodile. These large lizards are typically around five feet in length and have a fierce appearance, but are generally harmless unless provoked. They can defend themselves by delivering a strong blow with their tails or a sharp bite with their teeth. The young Hardys, however, were hesitant to try the meat of these creatures, despite it being a common dish among the locals. As time passed, their social circle expanded, with new settlers arriving in the area. The Hardys also welcomed a young Englishman named Fitzgerald, who came to learn about farming on the pampas. Additionally, their servant, Sarah, married a man named Terence with the approval of the Hardys. The family's cotton crop proved successful, but the labor-intensive process of cleaning the cotton led them to decide against repeating the experiment.|['1.

Mr. Hardy initially postponed planting tobacco and sugar-cane due to other land needs but later resumed the plan. Two months before Terence and Sarah's marriage, he planted tobacco. The process, requiring meticulous care, began by preparing the rich soil and transplanting the seedlings. The plants were hoed, leaves nipped, and carefully dried in the sun before being stored. The tobacco was then dried, sorted into quality tiers, bundled, and packed into barrels under heavy pressure. Mr. Hardy kept some for personal use and sold the rest profitably. The venture was successful but labor-intensive, leading Mr. Hardy to plant only for personal and estate use thereafter. The family took a keen interest in growing sugar-cane, aiming to produce for household needs. The cultivation process involved planting cuttings in well-prepared furrows, allowing for easy weed control. The cane grew rapidly, reaching a height of fourteen feet in four months, ready for harvesting.|"['1.

Mr. Hardy instructed Clara on the sugar-making process, using a mangle to crush the juice from the sugar canes. The family laughed at the idea of making sugar with a mangle, but it worked well. The canes were cut, passed through the mangle, and the juice collected in tubs. Lime and sheep's blood were added to clarify the sugar. The syrup was boiled, skimmed, and crystallized. The sugar was drained of molasses and dried. The process took a fortnight, with most time spent cutting and crushing the canes. The sugar was stored in a hogshead with plantain stems to draw out dark coloring. The sugar was dry and light-colored after three months. The boys later made wooden rollers and a horse mill for easier sugar production in the future.|"['Question 1:\nHow did Mr. Hardy crush the juice from the sugar canes?\nA) Using a blender\nB) Using a mangle\nC) Using a juicer\nD) Using a hammer\nE) Using a press', ""Question 2:\nWhat were lime and sheep's blood added for in the sugar-making process?\nA) To add flavor\nB) To sweeten the sugar\nC) To clarify the sugar\nD) To color the sugar\nE) To thicken the syrup"", 'Question 3:\nHow long did the sugar-making process take?\nA) One day\nB) One week\nC) One month\nD) A fortnight\nE) A year', 'Question 4:\nWhat was used to draw out dark coloring from the stored sugar?\nA) Lemon juice\nB) Vinegar\nC) Plantain stems\nD) Lime juice\nE) Salt', 'Question 5:\nWhat did the boys make to facilitate easier sugar production in the future?\nA) A blender\nB) A microwave\nC) A horse mill\nD) A juicer\nE) A press', 'Question 6:\nHow was the sugar described after three months of storage?\nA) Wet and dark-colored\nB) Dry and light-colored\nC) Sticky and sweet\nD) Bitter and hard\nE) Crystallized and brown']"|['B) Using a mangle', 'C) To clarify the sugar', 'D) A fortnight', 'C) Plantain stems', 'C) A horse mill', 'B) Dry and light-colored']
Mr. Hardy conducted various experiments on his farm, including growing ginger, vanilla beans, flax, hemp, and coffee. Despite facing challenges in obtaining labor and focusing on the farm's livestock and land, he found success in these endeavors. The projects not only provided entertainment for his children but also contributed to the farm's development. Over the eighteen months since settling at Mount Pleasant, significant changes had occurred. The once barren house was now surrounded by lush greenery, with extensive cultivated land and enclosures for livestock.

Ethel, who was only twelve but looked younger, enjoyed staying close to home with her family. She often worked quietly, sitting and chatting with her mother for hours. As the time approached for possible Indian attacks, Mr. Hardy, feeling prepared with more men, wasn't too worried about an assault on Mount Pleasant. However, he took precautions to protect the animals. One late afternoon, Mr. Fitzgerald rode out with Mr. Hardy, leaving the children scattered around the property. Suddenly, Maud rushed inside, grabbed her rifle, and called for Ethel to get hers. They both ran outside to find a terrifying scene unfolding.

It should be noted that all three of the Indians eventually recovered, although two of them were left with slight injuries for life. They were cared for and provided with horses and supplies when they were ready to travel. The Indians, known for their stoic demeanor, showed no gratitude until they were given their horses and weapons to leave. Their faces brightened, and they swiftly rode off. They returned briefly to express their gratitude to Mr. Hardy and his family before disappearing into the distance. The South American pampas and sierras Indians are described as inferior to the Comanches and Apaches of North America. They have dark complexions, flat faces, and are generally unattractive.

Mrs. Mercer and her children arrived a few days later. The boys gave up their room for her while they helped Mr. Mercer build his house and a wire fence for defense. Mrs. Mercer later joined her husband near the northeast corner of the property, just six miles from Mount Pleasant. The new house would have a wide entrance-hall, dining and drawing rooms, and four bedrooms upstairs. The old sitting room would become the kitchen, with a skylight in the roof. The kitchen would turn into a laundry. The plan included a wide veranda and spare rooms for indoor servants. The Hardys planned a visit to their friends during the building process. Two Italian women were hired for cooking and serving. The Hardys' estate flourished with increased emigration and prosperity. The estate house was improved, and the garden expanded. The young Hardys focused on supervising the estate, and the girls prepared to study in London. The arrival of a piano brought joy to the family, leading to more musical practice.

Mrs. Mercer and other ladies, along with native ladies, attended parties at Mr. Hardy's estate. The dancing lasted until late, with ladies resting briefly and gentlemen smoking before a morning bathe in the river. The parties were enjoyable and affordable, with no expensive drinks allowed. Tea and fruit drinks were served instead. The supper tables were lavish with turkeys, game, desserts, and fruits. Mr. Cooper, a friend, was often at Mount Pleasant with the boys. Mr. Hardy, upon learning of Mr. Cooper's affection for his daughter Maud, felt it premature due to their youth and lack of exposure. He suggested waiting until Maud was older and more experienced to consider any formal engagement. Mr. Cooper then expressed his feelings to Mr. Hardy, seeking permission to court Maud.

Mr. Cooper visited to bid farewell as he received urgent letters to return to Buenos Ayres. Warm goodbyes were exchanged, and Maud blushed when Mr. Cooper expressed his feelings with Mr. Hardy's permission. Later, Hubert and Ethel stayed over, but Hubert left early for cattle branding. As they prepared to depart, a man ran towards them from Mr. Mercer's direction. Charley urged Hubert to join him in a rescue mission across America, as there was hope Maud might still be alive. Charley signaled Mr. Hardy, who joined them and learned that the Indians had attacked, leaving the estancia burnt. Overwhelmed with grief, they planned to gather friends for help, and Mr. Hardy decided to break the news to Mrs. Hardy.|"['1.

Last night at eleven o'clock, a man was in his hut when he heard terrifying screams and realized that Indians had attacked. He managed to escape by throwing himself out of a window and hiding amongst potato plants. The Indians set fire to the house and the men's huts. After the Indians left, he cautiously waited until daylight to ensure it was safe before running for help. Mr. Hardy informed his wife about the tragic incident, and Charley quickly organized a rescue effort by sending messages to neighbors. The news caused sorrow among the women and anger among the men. Terence rushed down with more distressing news about the fate of the mistress and Miss Maud. The _capitaz_ asked for help from a Gaucho familiar with the Indians' territory. Charqui, dried meat, was explained as a method to preserve food in hot climates.|"[""1.

With clenched teeth and faces pale with rage and anxiety, the group rode past the huts where the bodies of the murdered peons lay. They stopped in front of the wooden house, now reduced to ashes. Carefully examining the charred remains, they found clues of the rooms within. A dog's mournful howls drew their attention to a ditch outside the fence, where a pile of dead bodies lay. Among them, a piece of a female dress caught their eye, but Ethel was not among the deceased. The relief of not finding her body overwhelmed Mr. Hardy and his friends. They were shocked by the massacre but grateful that Ethel was not among the victims. Tears of thankfulness and joy flowed as they processed the tragic events.|"['1.

The bodies were removed from the ditch and placed next to each other while waiting for the rest of the settlers to come. Soon, groups of settlers started to gather, showing anger and shock at the sight of the ruined house. Their sorrow deepened upon discovering that the entire well-liked family had perished. Among the first to arrive were the Edwards and the Jamiesons, accompanied by Gaucho Martinez. Perez, who had been on the farm, also arrived from Canterbury. Despite the time taken for all these events to unfold, it was still early in the day. The news came at six, with messengers dispatched thirty minutes later. The Hardys departed before eight and arrived at the scene within half an hour. By ten o'clock, a dozen more had arrived, with others galloping in the distance. By eleven, around twenty people were present, including English, Germans, French, and Gauchos, all familiar with Indian warfare.|['1.

The animals were brought up, and Mr. Hardy discovered a generous supply of food sent by Mrs. Hardy. The provisions included cold meat, bread, tea, sugar, a kettle, and tin mugs. At twelve o'clock, Mr. Hardy addressed his friends, expressing gratitude for their swift response to his call. He discussed the tragic events, his daughter's abduction, and the planned expedition into Indian territory to rescue her and avenge their murdered friends. Mr. Hardy acknowledged the dangers of the mission and offered his companions the choice to stay behind if they had concerns for their families' safety. A resolute companion emphasized the importance of unity and loyalty in the face of adversity, earning a heartfelt response from Mr. Hardy. The group then divided the supplies for the journey, ensuring each member had the necessary provisions for the perilous quest ahead.|"['1.

A group gathered around the supplies, each taking their share. The rest was divided into two bundles, secured on each side of a spare horse. The essentials like tobacco, sugar, and tea were wrapped in hide and placed between the bundles, with the kettle on top. They rode out, Mr. Hardy watching, confident they could hold their own against many Indians. Armed with rifles and pistols, the men were young and sunburned from the plains. They wore ponchos rolled on their saddles. The chase began at a canter, breaking into a walk every half-hour. The Indians had a head start, but the pursuit was on. The group traveled southwest, following the clear trail of the sheep and cattle. The mood was somber at first, but as they rode, spirits lifted, and conversation turned to past Indian fights. Mr. Hardy encouraged the talk to boost morale. After covering a good distance, they rested the horses before continuing their pursuit.|"['1.

The group of riders stopped by a stream to rest. They relaxed as the horses grazed nearby. Charley decided to hunt for fresh food. Whistling for the retriever, he set off with a double-barreled gun. Soon, shots echoed from a distance. Charley returned with seven and a half brace of plump duck. They mounted again, determined to catch up with their prey. Mr. Hardy knew the Indians were cunning and would use tricks to evade pursuit. After hours of riding, they halted for the night. The Gauchos advised it would be hours before they reached another stream. The men, former outlaws seeking refuge, were brave and familiar with the land. Mr. Herries spotted deer and used a clever trick to get a shot. He returned to camp with a catch, and they celebrated around a blazing fire. Each man cooked his portion, enjoying the fresh meal.|"['1.

The hunters returned with a small deer. The Gauchos quickly skinned and cooked the meat. After a satisfying meal, they brewed tea and relaxed. Mr. Hardy spoke with the Gauchos to learn about the area. They decided to take turns keeping watch for any danger. Suddenly, a fire was spotted in the distance. The group prepared for safety by clearing the area around them. Mr. Hardy instructed the Gauchos to tend to the horses while the rest cleared the ground.

All the group worked enthusiastically. Glancing back, the sky appeared ablaze. Flames flickered upward, and deer hurried past. The fire was about three miles away when Mr. Hardy cleared a wide space for safety. A hissing roar filled the air, and flames raced forward in a wall of fire. Birds flew overhead, and the smell of burning was strong. Mr. Hardy set the dry grass on fire, which quickly spread. The sight of the fire moving was impressive. The main fire passed, leaving them unharmed. The settlers often set fires before the rains for fresh grass. The young ones were anxious, but the settlers knew the routine. Mr. Hardy decided to wait until morning. They picketed the horses and rested. Later, a council was called to address the lost trail due to the fire erasing all traces.|"['1.

Mr. Hardy spoke to the Gauchos, suspecting that the fire was a diversion to throw them off track. He inquired about any natural barriers that may have halted the fire's advance. The Gauchos mentioned a small stream 15 miles away, beyond which the fire likely spread unhindered. Mr. Percy and Mr. Hardy speculated that the Indians deliberately obscured their trail by splitting up and setting fires to erase their path. They discussed the uncertainty of the Indians' direction and the possibility of a combined tribal effort. The plan to intercept the Indians at their village was proposed, but the group faced challenges due to the trail's unexpected direction. The Gauchos agreed with Mr. Hardy's assessment. The group felt disheartened by the daunting task ahead, unsure if each step would bring them closer to finding Ethel.|"[""1.

The day's plans were discussed among the group. Initially, they considered splitting into two parties, one going right and the other left until they found unburned ground. However, this idea was abandoned due to concerns about missing vital details of the trail. Instead, they decided to stick together and search for the trail of the southern party. A calculation was made assuming the Indians had traveled twenty-five more miles before heading home. To ensure accuracy, they planned to head east, follow the burned ground's edge, locate the trail, and then cut across to find the western Indians' trail. After tightening their girths, the group set out, noting the stark change in the landscape from the previous evening. They rode for hours until they reached unburned plains and found a pool to rest and refresh themselves and their horses. After a discussion, they estimated they had covered nearly forty miles and decided to rest before continuing their search for the Indian trail. Mr. Hardy proposed a walk to the edge of the burned ground, where they discovered the trampled grass left by a large group of animals. Unable to agree on the exact number that had passed, they sent for additional opinions to help assess the situation accurately.|"[""1.

Mr. Hardy and his companions followed the trail to examine it in both soft and elevated areas before being joined by Mr. Percy and the Gauchos. After a thorough investigation, they concluded that a large number of animals had passed, but the majority were uncertain until comparing with the western trail. Exhausted, they decided to camp for the night. The next day, they discovered a spring where the Indians had likely halted, and Dash found an arrow with a piece of Ethel's dress. Excited but suspicious, they realized it might have been a trick. Perez and Martinez discussed this quietly, leading Mr. Hardy to question them. Mr. Percy raised doubts about the authenticity of the arrow's placement, suggesting it might have been a ploy to mislead them.|"['1.

Mr. Hardy agreed with Percy, acknowledging the deception that had taken place about Ethel's whereabouts. The discovery of an arrow with a unique feather confirmed that Ethel was with a friendly group. The feather was recognized as a token of gratitude from one of the men they had helped. This revelation brought relief and certainty that Ethel was not alone. There was a sense of joy and gratitude among the group. Hubert's collection of feathers played a crucial role in identifying the arrow and tracing Ethel's location. The narrative then shifts to Ethel's capture by the Indians and her arrival at a village surrounded by rocky hills. Despite the hostile reception, Ethel remained composed, knowing that displaying fear would not help her situation. She faced the tribe's anger with courage and determination, earning their respect through her calm demeanor.|"['1.
