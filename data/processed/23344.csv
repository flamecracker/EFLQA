Princess Alicia rushed downstairs to watch over the Queen. She usually did this alone but during the Queen's illness, she sat with the King every evening. The King wondered why she never used the magic fish-bone. Whenever she noticed his cross look, she whispered the secret to the Duchess and lamented how children are underestimated. Once, a pug scared a Prince and caused an accident. Alicia tended to the wounded Prince and crafted a bandage. Another time, the baby fell and Alicia calmed the chaos. She then turned the children into cooks to distract them. The King, feeling despondent, was left with Alicia and the baby. Alicia, remembering the fairy's advice, used the magic fish-bone to bring the King's salary.|"['1.
