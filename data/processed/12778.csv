"The conversation was halted for a while. When the young engineers, followed closely by Nicolas, headed to their rooms, Hazelton was so tired that he quickly undressed and fell into bed. Later that night, Harry suddenly sat up in the darkness. Someone was moving in the parlor between their rooms. Harry got up quietly and approached the adjacent room. ""Wait a minute, Harry, and you'll see more lights. Those lights are on the trail from the nearby gold mines to _El Sombrero_,"" Tom whispered. Harry, despite his many adventures, felt uneasy as he dressed swiftly, planning to leave their employer's house unnoticed. They both quickly got ready and cautiously stepped out onto the lawn. Tom suspected that Don Luis Montez might have ulterior motives for them. Tom decided to keep a close eye on things. They noticed lights on the trail and saw what seemed like a caravan. Tom intended to hide on the nearest rocky ledge to observe the caravan. The servant, Nicolas, warned about Pedro Gato and his men ahead on the road."|['1.

"Before the young engineers appeared, a faint light reflected off the stones caught their attention. Tom signaled Hazelton to slow down. Peeking around a rock ledge, Reade spotted four Mexicans gathered around a campfire, two with rifles by their side. Gato, with a scowl, sat against a rock. ""You can leave,"" sneered Gato.

Tom and Harry observed suspicious activities at the mine. They discovered that Don Luis might be trying to deceive buyers by salting his mine with rich ore. Determined not to be a part of any swindle, the two friends decided to expose Don Luis's deceitful plans. They strategized to uncover the truth without alerting him too soon. Tom was adamant about preventing the fraud from happening and warned Harry about the difficulties of recovering money from a gold mine.

Harry expressed his reluctance to return to the house of the deceitful man, feeling uneasy about the situation. He suggested making a quick move towards the railway to head back to the States. Unaware of being followed, the boys were trailed by the vigilant Nicolas. Once safely inside the house, Nicolas guarded the door to the engineers' rooms. Despite the tension, Tom encouraged Harry to stay composed and not reveal any signs of anxiety. Don Luis, the owner of mines, offered them employment with the promise of a high salary if they proved resourceful.

Tom pondered the role the girl would have to play. Despite her father being untrustworthy, he believed the girl to be sweet and honest. Her father, Don Luis, had decided to train her in business, going against the customs of their country. He explained that all his earnings were for her, envisioning her as a wealthy and successful woman. Don Luis started her first lesson gently, showing her the ledger and explaining the figures. The wealth generated from El Sombrero was immense, and Tom and Harry, who were present, listened attentively. Don Luis noticed his daughter's confusion and fatigue, deciding to stop for the day. He then shared a report prepared by Senor Reade in English, which he translated into Spanish for his daughter. The report was crucial for her future fortune, and Don Luis promised to reward Tom and Harry generously for their service.|"[""1.

Don Luis started reading the report, translating into Spanish as he read. When he reached the tables of boring figures, Montez skipped them quickly. He focused eagerly on the parts that talked about the vast wealth in El Sombrero. Francesca listened with growing excitement, occasionally giving Tom a pleased glance to show her approval of the report, which she thought was written by him. Tom humbly acknowledged the praise but clarified that the report was her father's work, not his. He explained that an engineer's signature on a report is a promise of truth, and since he hadn't verified the mine's value personally, he couldn't sign it yet. Despite Don Luis and Tom's discussion, Francesca sensed an underlying tension about honor. She observed the exchange between them, feeling confused and embarrassed.|"['1.

Tom embarked alone into the valley. A few locals in light clothing idled in the street, gazing curiously at the robust, tanned young foreigner approaching them briskly. Some children, as was their custom, requested money. Tom, with a pleasant smile, took out a few American coins and scattered them on the ground. He then hurried to the telegraph station, a modest one-room shack. Despite its appearance, Tom found solace in the fact that its wires connected to the civilized world, particularly to the United States, where he longed to reach. Tom completed a form, noting the name and address of his and Harry's office manager in the U.S. Below, he added a message indicating that if they failed to make contact soon, foul play was involved, prompting swift action by the U.S. government. However, the sergeant refused to send the message without written consent from Don Luis Montez. Defeated, Tom accepted his fate as he was gently pushed out of the station, realizing he and Harry might have to trek an additional fifty miles to find a railway.|"['1.

Harry stopped speaking at that moment. Tom Reade, typically very practical, was also the type of young man willing to sacrifice for a cause. He went outside and lay on the grass under a tree, yearning for a book. Hazelton remarked on the freedom they seemed to have to roam the hills, but they knew soldiers would capture them if they strayed too far. They had tried sending letters through locals, but each time Don Luis intercepted them. Tom and Harry worried about the messengers' fate and feared for Nicolas, who might be in danger for helping them. Tom grew restless, a stark contrast to his usual composed self.

Tom Reade walked slowly, trying to appear casual as he looked down at the village below. Children played in the streets while women bustled around, the men hard at work in the mine. Despite the lack of valuable ore, Don Luis kept the laborers busy in hopes of a big find. As Tom observed the scene, he noticed movement among the rocks near the mine's entrance. Concerned for the stranger's well-being, Tom offered help, suggesting a nearby house for care. The stranger hesitated, but Tom insisted on aiding him, promising to return soon.

The day before, Don Luis had visited but didn't enter the cook tent. The mine owner wouldn't have found anything intriguing even if he had. At the back of the tent was the stranger, his bed sectioned off by a dark curtain. Don Luis had come to chat with the young engineers and assess if they were close to meeting his demands. Nicolas stayed silent about the sick man, only bringing what Tom or Harry requested. The engineers found caring for the sick man a welcome diversion.

Mr. Haynes gathered his associates after Ellsworth's summons. Don Luis sensed a shift in the atmosphere, feeling uneasy. The Americans looked serious as Mr. Haynes shared a telegram.

"Don Luis, I'm here because I believe this is a crucial point in my investigation. Let's get straight to it. You've sold your mining property here.

Mr. Haynes, we made sure to include the forest tract in the _El Sombrero_ purchase title. It's more like a dense jungle, a real challenge to navigate. When we expand operations, we'll need a team with machetes to clear paths through the tangled brush. We see immense mineral potential in that forest. The entire property cost two and a half million dollars, but we believe the forest alone is worth as much, if not more. Tom Reade reveals that they sent letters to Washington seeking help, which led to an investigation into the governor's shady dealings. Despite a tense moment with a pistol, they are assured that justice will prevail.|"['1.
