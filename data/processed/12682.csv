Hal and Chester, two brave American boys, found themselves in the midst of the European war.

Skilled in combat and scouting, they served with the British troops and even fought alongside the Russians in the east. Their adventures took them across Europe, where they thwarted German plots and saved the French president.

During World War I, the French forces managed to push back the invader from Paris and across the Aisne and Marne rivers. However, both sides faced strong defenses, leading to a stalemate. In the east, the Russians achieved success by capturing Austrian strongholds and preparing for an invasion of Hungary. In the Balkans, hopes were high for their support to encircle the Germanic powers, but progress was slow. Italy, initially part of the Triple Alliance, decided to join the Allies due to fears of German victory and historical animosity towards Austria. The Italian people demanded war, leading to Italy's decision to fight alongside the Allies. Austria offered concessions, but Italy saw through the ploy and prepared for war.|"['1.

Italy's decision to enter the war sparked intense speculation on her first target. Would she support the French and British at Gallipoli or strike Austria?

In the room, a sudden commotion as Italian cavalry charged in with sabers drawn, scattering the crowd. Hal, realizing the danger, shouted for the boys to obey. The general, engrossed in correspondence, paid no heed to the scuffle that ensued. Chester, driven by impulse, struck the colonel, causing a stir.

Despite his diplomatic immunity, plans were made to confront Robard at the embassy.

Hal decided to introduce Uncle John to his friends. Afterward, the American ambassador mentioned that he would be relocating and bid farewell. Uncle John invited the others to join him for lunch at a nearby hotel. The major hinted at a secret dispatch from General Joffre regarding Italy's entry into the war and plans for a coordinated attack against the Austro-German army. As they walked toward the Austrian legation, Uncle John chuckled, reminiscing about his youth and carrying a gun after many years. Hal shared his plan to check the house for any signs of danger before their meeting. He assured them that there would be no need for gunfire.

Quickly, Hal moved to the window, listening intently but hearing nothing. Quietly, he lifted the window, allowing Uncle John to climb into the room. Unable to see in the dark, Uncle John called out. Suddenly, a man with a revolver appeared in the doorway, taking their weapons. Uncle John then bravely acted, motioning for Chester and the man to pass. But as they moved, Hal sprang on the man, disarming him. A struggle ensued, with Hal, Chester, and Uncle John overpowering the man. However, the man managed to escape, leaving Uncle John injured.

Hal easily reached the door and flung it open, running down the steps with Chester close behind. Suddenly, a shot rang out, causing Uncle John to collapse. Hal instructed Chester to stay put while he returned a paper to General Ferrari and then planned to come back to help. As he cautiously approached the embassy, he heard muffled sounds inside. When Uncle John fell, anger surged through him. Despite being grazed by a bullet, he saw Chester disappearing and decided to follow. Uncle John, once strong, now faced Robard, a younger foe. Uncle John's boxing skills came into play as he landed blows on Robard. However, outnumbered, Uncle John was soon overwhelmed by three men who closed in on him.|['1.

Assisted by the men, Uncle John stood up as one of them pointed a revolver at him. Meanwhile, the others helped Robard, who was also getting back on his feet. With anger in his eyes, Robard approached Uncle John. Despite the gun pointed at him, Uncle John, his cheek marked by a slap, shouted in rage and lunged forward. Startled, the man with the gun hesitated to shoot, fearing hitting his friend. A scuffle ensued, with Uncle John landing blows on Robard and the others. His quick moves surprised them, knocking down one with a punch and another with a kick. Facing the third man's gun, Uncle John disarmed him by throwing him against a wall. Reflecting on his temper, Uncle John regretted his actions and decided to leave, unaware that his departure would lead to Hal and Chester joining the Italian army.|"['1.

"""These women are funny things,"" he said. ""I wonder what can have happened to those boys? They've probably gone back to look for me. Guess I had better head that way myself. I may come in handy, you never can tell."" He led the way and Chester followed him. Hal mounted the steps without hesitancy and turned the knob of the door. The door opened and the lad stepped inside, where he halted with a cry of surprise. Chester peered over his shoulder. Hal listened attentively for a few seconds. The faint sound of footsteps could be heard approaching from further back in the house. At the same moment Robard groaned, moved about and sat up. The hands of the two lads dropped to their pockets. ""Good work, Fritz,"" came the voice of Robard, and he pulled himself to his feet with some difficulty and advanced toward the boys. ""I'll thank you for your guns,"" he said. ""No, I'll get them myself,"" he added as both boys moved their hands toward the weapons. Robard now gave his attention to the injured men on the floor. Two of them showed signs of returning consciousness and soon were able to get to their feet. The other could not be revived, and at a command from Robard, he was carried to another room. The sound of footsteps outside the door prevented Robard from replying. Levelling a revolver at the lads, he motioned them to be silent, and"|"['1.

Robard's face turned fierce as he blamed the boys for his failure to get important papers. He planned to take out his anger on them, but keep it hidden from the Austrian ambassador.

Hal, Chester, and Uncle John were startled awake by rough hands and gruff voices. They found themselves in a compartment flooded with daylight.

Instead of boarding another train as expected, they were led to the station and then onto the street. As they followed, they noticed a small house up ahead. Inside, they were taken to a room at the end of a short hall. Chester, with a warning gesture, pressed his ear against the wall and signaled for Hal and Uncle John to join him.

In the chaos, shots were fired, but Chester managed to neutralize the threats. He rushed to aid Hal, ensuring his friend was alive.

Chester was coerced out of the room at gunpoint by the Austrian, who was taking no chances. Once back in the locked room, Chester felt dejected, anticipating trouble from Robard. Hal and Uncle John rushed to the Italian general's headquarters in Venice to warn of the impending danger. Despite their good intentions, the general suspected them of being spies and decided to detain them until further notice. Hal, frustrated by the situation, expressed his discontent with the treatment they received. As tensions rose, Chester retaliated against Robard's aggression with a swift punch to the face. The outcome remained uncertain, with the hope that their warning would reach the general in time to prevent disaster.|"[""1.

Chester skillfully dodged a punch and swiftly disarmed Robard, seizing the revolver just in time. Angered but composed, he countered with precision, landing blows that left his opponent reeling. Focused and strategic, Chester outmaneuvered the Austrian, delivering a series of powerful punches that stunned Robard. Despite the intense confrontation, Chester regretted letting his anger cloud his judgment, vowing to handle situations differently in the future. Meanwhile, as tensions escalated between members of the Austrian diplomatic corps and Chester's group, the Italian army mobilized swiftly against the enemy. Italian forces engaged in battles along the Austrian frontier, while the Italian fleet enforced a blockade of Austrian ports in the Adriatic. The conflict intensified as Austrian aircraft targeted civilian areas, but Italian defenses proved effective in countering the attacks.|"['1.

Italy was well-prepared for war unlike some of her allies. She had mobilized her forces before entering the conflict, having recently triumphed in a battle against the Turks. With a seasoned army, Italy was ready to take the offensive. The question was where to strike. Crossing the Alps or launching a naval attack across the Adriatic were considered. However, both options posed challenges. Despite the harsh mountain conditions and the Adriatic being heavily mined by the Austrians, Italy was determined to find the best opportunity to make a move. Meanwhile, Chester Crawford, a captive, strategized his escape plan, offering a deal to his guards to ensure his safety until the ambassador regained consciousness.|['1.

The ambassador proposed a journey to Vienna with Chester to validate his account to the emperor, highlighting the need to counteract Robard's influential allies who could discredit their story. Despite the ambassador's assurance of safe passage back to Italy, Chester's skepticism prevailed. Seated across the ambassador on a train to Trieste, Chester's defiance was evident, regretting his earlier aid to the ambassador. Upon arrival at a hotel, Chester, determined to escape, fashioned a rope from the bedclothes, preparing for a daring descent from the fifth-floor window under the cover of darkness.|"['1.

"He was now even with the window on the third floor, and he succeeded by clever work in getting a foothold on the sill; and, still clinging to the rope, he stood erect. Inside, Chester saw the figure of a man. Inadvertently, the lad's foot crashed against the window pane, shattering the glass. There was a crash, followed by a guttural exclamation from inside the room. Taking a firm hold on the rope, he swung himself outward, giving his flight through space an added impetus by pushing with his right foot. He went sailing through the air, even as a pistol shot rang out behind him. Rapidly he made his descent, and a few moments later stood upon the sidewalk, unhurt. For a moment he paused to gain a much-needed breath, and then, turning, he stalked quickly away. And as he did so there came cries from within the hotel, and men rushed out and after him. ""Guess I have shaken them,"" he said. ""Now, if I only knew where I was, I might manage to get out of here. Guess I had better pick one direction and keep going that way. I'll trust to luck that it is either north or west."" He turned down the next street and set out resolutely, having determined in his mind to stick to the direction he had selected.

Stubbs, the war correspondent for the New York _Gazette_, offered Chester an opportunity to join him on a journey to Italy to witness the Italian army in action. Despite Chester's concerns about leaving civilization, Stubbs assured him that he had the necessary permits to pass through borders safely.

""I must evade the locals tracking me. But how?"" After some contemplation, he paid his bill and exited the restaurant. Standing outside, he pondered his escape, aware of Austrian patrols nearby.

Red Cross workers tended to the wounded as the Italians and Austrians engaged in a fierce artillery duel.

Hal and Chester, on horseback, watched a fierce battle unfold before them. Austrian and Italian cavalry clashed with swords and sabers flashing. The Austrians charged fiercely, overwhelming the Italians initially. The lads, witnessing the chaos, shuddered at the brutality. The struggle ebbed and flowed, each side gaining ground alternately. Meanwhile, the infantry fought in other parts of the field. Suddenly, a second wave of Austrian cavalry attacked the Italians from the left, catching them off guard. As the Italians retreated, a loud shout signaled the arrival of Italian reinforcements led by Colonel Anderson. Hal and Chester, armed and ready, joined the charge. Hal's quick shot saved Colonel Anderson, turning the tide in favor of the Italians. The Austrians were quickly overpowered, and the lads emerged unscathed from the intense battle.|"['1.

The battle between the Austrians and Italians was fierce, with only a few brave Austrian soldiers managing to break through the Italian lines before being cut off. Despite a demand to surrender, they fought on until they were defeated. The Italians celebrated their victory with a cheer as they pursued the retreating enemy. However, the Austrian artillery struck the Italian horsemen, causing devastation.

Listen, we have a plan. First, we will change into regular clothes and inform the Italian officer at the farthest post about our intentions. Then, we will get horses and have Italian cavalry chase us, shooting above our heads. This will draw the enemy out to assist us. Before we proceed, we will create maps showing false Italian positions and strengths. When captured by the Austrian commander, we will claim to be German spies. Although risky, this plan might work if we are cautious. We must act quickly and not raise suspicion. As they set out towards the front, they stayed in uniform until just before dawn when they changed into civilian clothes.

Straight toward the approaching Austrians, the Italian cavalry spurred their horses, parting the enemy ranks. The Italians then retreated, and the Austrians did not pursue. Before the Austrian commander's quarters, an officer whispered to the orderly at the entrance, who then signaled for them to enter. Colonel Anderson, explaining their escape, showed General Brentz secret troop positions hidden in his boot. The general devised a strategy, emphasizing a feint on the enemy's left wing followed by a strong attack in the center. Hal warned of a potential enemy raid through the Austrian right wing. General Brentz planned to delay his attack until the arrival of the German Emperor. The group settled in secure quarters, discussing the strategic position and potential future actions.|"['1.

"""We've explored all options,"" he responded. ""Over there,"" sweeping his arm around in a wide gesture, ""is Gorizia, crucial for Trieste, the Italian target. Gorizia is heavily fortified, as you know. We could hold our ground there against superior forces indefinitely."" ""No,"" the Austrian countered with a grin, ""but taking Gorizia is essential to control Trieste. The mountains overlooking the city are armed with our cannons, able to bombard it safely. The Italians are aware, hence their hesitation to attack Trieste. The same applies to Trent, the other coveted spot."" Hal and Chester refrained from signaling Uncle John to avoid detection. The Austrian officer eyed them suspiciously. ""Why?"" he pondered later in his tent. Suddenly, realization struck. ""What a mistake,"" he muttered. ""They're here to rescue me, and I almost ruined it. I should be grateful."" ""It seems feasible,"" Chester remarked. ""Luckily, we're known to most officers here. If we catch a guard off guard, we can escape."" They quietly approached Uncle John's tent, noticing a sentinel nearby. With a silent knife cut, they entered.

Four figures swiftly and silently made their way through the tents, beyond the farthest row, and into the open. As they neared the outposts, footsteps approached them in response to a wild cry, alerting the entire battle line. The four fled towards the Italian lines, dodging bullets that whizzed past them. After a close call with a volley of bullets aimed low, they dropped to the ground. Upon a brief respite, they dashed ahead, covering hundreds of yards until they paused to strategize. Hal suggested seeking refuge in an old shack to await daylight and Italian assistance. Boosted through a window, they took down an enemy inside and prepared to defend themselves, anticipating an attack from both the door and window.|['1.

Chester swiftly turned and shot towards the window where he spotted a head. The Austrian dodged, but Chester was quicker, causing the Austrian to fall outside. The thud was loud. Growing impatient, Chester signaled Uncle John to help him up. Peeking out the window, they saw a group of Austrians deep in conversation below. When the enemies were visible, four guns fired, taking down some Austrians. Hal suggested conserving bullets, assigning targets to each. They decided to wait for an opportunity to escape. As the cabin heated up, they planned to surprise the Austrians, grab horses, and flee. With the flames crackling and smoke billowing in, Colonel Anderson signaled it was time to make a move.

Uncle John helped the colonel up and rushed to Hal's side. They waited anxiously for the signal to escape the fiery chaos and flee through the Austrian troops. Hal urged Uncle John to follow him. They leaped over obstacles, mounted horses, and rode into the darkness. Hal fired shots to fend off pursuers, leading the way with Uncle John close behind. As they rode towards the Italian outpost, Hal shared vital information with the commander. After receiving thanks, they returned to the front. The Italians had chased the Austrians in vain.

The guard watched the man closely, then summoned his superior. Stubbs, respectful but firm, inquired about the Austrian troops. The officer, after a pause, allowed them to follow. Stubbs explained their mission: to share the truth about the Austrians with America. The general, initially cautious, decided to trust them. He revealed the prisoners' fate at dawn, guarded and to be executed. Stubbs thanked him and promised to show Americans the real Austrians.
