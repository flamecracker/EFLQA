The mysterious disappearance of a significant part of the Inca treasure remains unsolved. The Spaniards, by torturing the locals who knew the secret, uncovered a few findings. However, these discoveries were likely just a fraction of the total missing wealth. Legends suggest that the Peruvians fled with a substantial amount of treasure towards the east of Peru, where they may have established a hidden city. The dense forests and hostile tribes in the region have prevented any exploration. The story transitions to two men in a London club discussing their predicaments. One, Prendergast, is a former navy officer seeking adventure and fortune to win the hand of his beloved, Miss Fortescue. The other man, experienced in the Mediterranean, advises Prendergast to consider South America, particularly Peru, where hidden treasures may lie waiting to be discovered.|['1.

The natives never spoke to the Spaniards about gold. If they had, they would have been severely punished. The Indians believe gold brings misfortune to their people. Some secrets about the Inca's treasures have been passed down through generations. There are rumors that part of the treasure was given to savage tribes or lost at sea. While it's unlikely you'll find the treasure, there are still undiscovered gold mines in South America. You could explore these mines, collect samples, and potentially make money. It's a risky adventure, but with the right contacts and perseverance, you might have a chance. This journey could provide a distraction from other concerns and open up new opportunities for you.|"[""1.

Mr. Barnett, thank you for your kind offer and suggestions. I appreciate the opportunity you've presented. Though the likelihood of success is slim, I see it as a glimmer of hope.

I cannot lend any money from the thousand pounds that will be his when he comes of age. Your father's will stated that the interest would accumulate if he passed away before then.

In the mountains, survival often depended on hunting for food with a rifle and trading with local villages. The native Indians showed great gratitude towards the English for helping overthrow the Spanish rule. Bertie was offered a chance to travel to South America on a ship to complete his apprenticeship. He was advised to learn Spanish for better communication. Despite initial doubts, Bertie's plans were supported, and he was even given a position as a supernumerary on a ship bound for Callao. The journey required basic supplies like rifles, pistols, and clothing. Bertie's friend, Harry, secured their passage on the ship and made preparations for the adventure ahead.|"['1.

Captain Peters gladly agreed to have Harry's brother on board as a supernumerary. He appreciated the good service Harry's brother had provided and allowed him to draw his pay during the voyage. While the ship did not typically book passengers due to the hassle, the captain made an exception for Harry and his brother.

The captain also welcomed Harry's presence as a naval officer, valuing the additional support and advice in case of emergencies. Harry, in turn, offered his assistance and even agreed to take on watch duty during rough weather.

Harry prepared for the voyage by purchasing supplies for the ship and his brother Bertie. He spent time bidding farewell to friends before heading to the docks where the _Para_, an 800-ton ship, awaited. Despite its disorderly appearance, Harry believed the ship would sail well due to its fresh paint and sleek design. Captain Peters expressed frustration at the late arrival of supplies cluttering the deck. The crew worked diligently to clear the ship as they set sail down the river. The journey from the Pool to the river mouth was perilous, with the crew navigating treacherous sandbanks. The wind aided their progress as they passed other vessels.

Harry expressed his lack of remorse as he descended with the captain. He mentioned having a hearty breakfast and a snack of a biscuit and beer, yet still felt ravenous, attributing it to a robust appetite at sea after being on land for nearly two years. The first mate, Johnson, joined the captain for dinner. He was a tall, quiet man who rarely spoke unless prompted, displaying a subtle sense of humor. Despite the light and shifting winds delaying their journey, they eventually made progress until reaching a calm period near the equator.

The ship was swiftly engulfed by a dark, roaring gale as the captain shouted for everyone to hold on. The vessel trembled from the force of the wind, pushing her forward at an alarming speed. The crew struggled to keep her steady as the sea grew rough. Gradually, the darkness lifted, and the ship sailed under a clear blue sky, racing at a rapid eighteen knots.

For six days, a fierce storm battered the ship relentlessly. The crew faced bone-chilling cold as icy spray coated the vessel, demanding constant effort to break the frozen masses. Harry bravely took turns watching with the mates, while the captain tirelessly commanded the deck. Twice they narrowly avoided icebergs, once nearly colliding in a blinding snowstorm. Exhausted and battered, the crew persevered. As the wind calmed, the ship found its course, rounding the Cape and heading north. Days later, with the coast of Chili in sight, relief washed over them. The mate, thawed from the storm's grip, found solace in the ship's solidarity. Amidst the crew's shared hardships and silent resolve, they pressed on, leaving the treacherous winter behind.|"[""1.

During the winter, I built a hut using stones and the boat as a roof. The snow covered it deep. I melted whale blubber for candles and stored meat. Bears and wolves fought over the whale carcass. They tried to break in but couldn't stand fire. I managed to kill two small bears. The skins made clothes and a blanket. The hut was warm with candles and snow. I climbed out for supplies.

As they finally reached the shore, Harry expressed his relief at setting foot on land after a long wait due to the delays with the medical officer and the port official. The bustling scene of boatmen vying for their attention amused Harry, although he found it overwhelming. The customs process was made smoother with a small tip, and they were soon surrounded by a diverse crowd offering help or seeking alms. Harry quickly selected two individuals to carry their luggage to the recommended hotel, navigating through the chaotic square filled with various goods. The hotel, though dirtier than expected, served a surprisingly satisfying dinner. Eager to continue their journey to Lima, they decided to leave at daybreak, arranging for riding mules and baggage transport. Despite a brief exploration of the town, they found little of interest in its earthquake-damaged buildings.|['1.

Their night was far from enjoyable. The beds were basic, just hides on wooden frames, and they quickly discovered they were not alone. With little sleep, they eagerly welcomed the first light of day. After a quick bath, they returned to a breakfast of coffee, fish, and eggs. Impatiently waiting for the mules, they finally set off for Lima. The journey was six miles uphill, with a rough road and dry surroundings. Approaching the town, they encountered lush vegetation and canals irrigating the land. Inside Lima, the streets were orderly, with houses painted in squares or stripes, featuring enclosed balconies. The hotel they checked into was grand but lacked cleanliness.

"Dias stood over the man Harry had first knocked down, and with a fierce whisper ordered him to give up his knife, which he did at once. The other was still stupid from the effect of the blow and his fall, and Dias had only to take his knife from his relaxed fingers.

"""It's a small matter to you, but significant to us,"" explained the señor. A Peruvian would avoid interfering in a situation where four armed men were attacking one person. They would rather steer clear to avoid being involved. This behavior is unique to your countrymen,"" he continued. ""If they can act this way without weapons, imagine what they could do armed. The issue is resolved; those hurt will recover without lasting scars. In two years, they will have moved on to other concerns. The political tensions between Colombia and Chile may impact business,"" he added. The brothers, dressed in Peruvian attire, set out for their journey. They wore felt hats, llama wool ponchos, and carried knives and rifles for protection. As they left the hotel, they wore green goggles to shield their eyes from the sun and snow glare. They joked about sending a portrait to a young lady and laughed as they ventured out, feeling a bit self-conscious but soon realizing no one paid them any mind."|['1.

They spent the previous afternoon packing bundles with care, ensuring nothing was forgotten. Five baggage mules were lined up, José leading the first. Dias helped his wife onto a cushion behind him before mounting. Harry and his brother also prepared to ride, refusing the heavy spurs but carrying them in their saddlebags as requested by the Indian. The journey took them through the village of Quiraz and past cotton plantations, fortresses, and remnants of old Spanish towns. As they ascended, the valley narrowed into a ravine with earthquake-made rents in the hills. Chosica marked the end of their four-hour journey, where the valley widened once more at the foothills.|"['1.

After finishing their meal, Maria, Bertie, and Dias explored a burial ground near the village. They found sunken chambers with bones and remains of clothing. The bodies seemed to have been small, wrapped in sack-like mats. The graves contained tools, like knitting utensils and weaving implements. They even discovered a work-box with a girl's belongings and a parrot mummy. Dias explained that these tombs predated the Incas and had narrow passages connecting them. The group continued their journey beyond Chosica, where civilization faded. The rugged road led through wild, steep terrain with rivers and ravines. José sang while riding, and Maria walked cheerfully, keeping Bertie on his toes. They camped before villages, cooking dinner over a fire.

The landscape had transformed entirely. Villages dotted the plain, and farming was widespread. The hillsides showcased man-made steps holding chalets and small hamlets, similar to what they had seen on their way up. These terraces, once thriving with people, were now home to gardens and orchards flourishing up to the hilltops. Taking a break in Oroya, they rented rooms for their mules to rest. As they gathered around a fire on the chilly evening, they discussed a trip north to see the Cerro de Pasco silver mine, known as the richest globally. While gold was the real treasure sought after, silver mines posed challenges due to high costs and transportation issues.

In the search for hidden treasures and gold mines, the mountains hold the key. Stories suggest that treasures were hidden along the eastern Cordilleras range and beyond. Time is limited, so focusing on the eastern side is crucial. The gold mines are believed to lie between Cuzco and Lake Titicaca. A river near Puno once revealed great treasures until a flood turned the valley into a lake. The choice between gold mines and hidden treasures depends on the ease of extraction. Hidden treasures could be more beneficial than gold mines due to the labor and machinery required for mining. Tales of gold-seekers from the south suggest abundant riches but dangers from savage tribes. The region offers a variety of game and fish for sustenance, but also poses threats from alligators, great serpents, and desperate men.|['1.

There are no known remedies for arrow or spear wounds among the natives. The best chance is to pour ammonia into an arrow hole immediately or cut away flesh around a spear wound and treat it with ammonia or a hot iron. The protagonist bought a large bottle of ammonia in Lima for this purpose. They plan to journey to Cuzco and then to Sicuani to reach the Tinta volcano where rich gold sand lies hidden in a gorge. Dias, the guide, inherited the knowledge from his father. The treasure belonged to the Chimoos, a powerful ancient people. The Spaniards found some treasures but many more remain undiscovered. Dias believes he can find the hidden treasure with the protagonist's help.|"['1.

"The peasants' houses, though small, were comfortable since the Spaniards' expulsion. Under Spanish rule, displaying wealth led to harsh taxes. Travelling, they bought food easily, preferring tents over inns. By Cuzco, Bertie spoke Spanish fluently. Maria and José shared tales of Peru's history, mourning the Incas. Cuzco, the old Inca capital, sat in a valley with a citadel on a hill. Bertie, uninterested in history, longed to leave.

"""Hello, Bertie, I mostly agree with you. If I came here to study Inca history and explore their palace ruins, I'd be happy to stay longer. But like you, I'm eager to keep moving. Dias mentioned we can start again in two days. We've been planning how much flour and supplies we need. The mules should carry as little as possible to cross the Inca roads. Dias suggested using llamas instead, as they're great climbers. We might take a few llamas with us to set up a central camp. They can carry fifty pounds each. We debated taking the Paucartambo pass, but it's dangerous. Food won't be an issue; we can find wild turkeys and abandoned plantations along the way. The Chincas tribe might pose a threat on this path. Alternatively, the Tinta mountain route is perilous. We set off with four llamas added to our group. They'll follow the mules easily.

Harry and his group paused near a stunning waterfall. The hills surrounded them steeply, except for the river's path through the gorge. The hills were lush with brushwood, ferns, and flowers of various hues. Palm trees and forest growth thrived wherever they could. Large butterflies fluttered by, birds with vibrant feathers soared, and hummingbirds sipped nectar from blossoms. Parrots squawked in the treetops, and the waterfall's mist glistened in the sunlight. Dias directed them to unload the animals and set up camp. José gathered dry sticks for a fire, and Maria began cooking breakfast. Dias cautioned against descending into the thick forest below due to its hazards. They needed to build a bridge across a torrent using felled trees before moving on.|['1.

Dias explained the importance of following the streams from the hills to find gold, emphasizing the need for caution closer to Tinta. He mentioned a star, Coyllur, rising at midnight in a peak's cleft near the gold-containing stream's valley.

Crossing a stream, they journeyed through the forest, clearing paths with axes. By noon, they reached level ground, the heat intense. Harry shot a wild turkey for food. After a meal, they rested. José assured them the llamas would alert to any danger. For weeks, they explored ravines, panning for gold with little success. Dias noted they needed more help to profit. They hunted for food, catching fish and game. The work was tough, bridging streams with felled trees. They rarely rode mules due to rough terrain. One day, they heard unfamiliar pig noises but were warned not to shoot by Dias.|['1.

Dias returned to the mules and quickly placed his wife on a branch six feet off the ground, preparing for a possible attack by peccaries. This action surprised Harry, as Donna Maria usually refused help, showcasing her independence. Dias's immediate concern for his wife's safety highlighted the severity of the danger they faced. The peccaries, wild pigs, were more threatening than anticipated. Dias explained that they were fierce creatures capable of causing harm. The group's encounter with the peccaries made them realize the imminent danger posed by the Chincas, skilled hunters who could track them without leaving a trace.

Before nightfall, the group planned to reach a stream and then head to a treeless ravine to defend themselves against ambush. They needed to move quickly to avoid being targeted by skilled archers. The leader would guide the way, while the others urged the mules forward. At the stream, they paused briefly to feed the animals before continuing in the dark. They believed that attackers would not strike at night due to fear of demons and wild animals. The group expected to be pursued the next day but aimed to find a defensible spot beforehand. They reached a gorge in the mountains, where they decided to build a barricade to protect themselves from potential attackers. The group anticipated a patient pursuit from the savages but focused on fortifying their position and securing food.|"[""1.

"Working diligently until nightfall, they stacked rocks to create a protective barrier, leaving an opening in the center. Selecting a spot with ample fallen rocks, they filled gaps with little effort. ""Chopping wood is nothing compared to this,"" Bertie groaned, exhausted.

Harry, Maria, and Dias were on watch for about two hours when Donna Maria signaled Harry. He looked but saw nothing until a rock nearby seemed to change shape. With his gun aimed, he fired, hitting one of the men spotted by Donna Maria. The valley erupted with cries as the men were hit. Dias reassured them that the attackers wouldn't try anything else that night. As Bertie slept, the others chatted until Dias returned.

The canyon above is narrow and challenging to cross, with large rocks blocking the way. Climbing the almost vertical walls seems impossible. Further up, there's a narrow ravine where the stream rushes swiftly. Dias suggests staying put, as they have provisions, can fish, and defend themselves if needed. He believes the natives won't risk descending the steep cliffs at night. The group ponders a plan to mislead the Chincas by pretending to move towards another gorge before doubling back downstream.

They planned to create loud bangs to startle the Indians. Despite the challenges of not having enough paper, they brainstormed innovative solutions using available materials like cloth and paste.

Harry praised José for his excellent work in gathering crucial information about the enemy's position and intentions. They deduced that the enemy was not closely monitoring them at the ravine's entrance, possibly assuming they wouldn't escape or wanting them to leave. They strategized to use fireworks to surprise the enemy at dusk and planned to load supplies on mules for a quick departure. They discussed using torches to guide the mules down the steep terrain in the dark. Dias suggested making torches from resin to aid the descent.

During the afternoon, Dias, who had been vigilant at the cliffs, informed Harry that he believed the savages were vacating the hills. Dias had observed a man walking purposefully towards the cliffs, possibly carrying a message. Soon after, Dias spotted several men moving in the opposite direction. They were not running but advancing steadily. Dias speculated that the savages might be regrouping to either disperse and hunt or launch an attack. Harry realized the danger of being overwhelmed by the savages in a sudden rush, and they discussed strategies to defend themselves. They contemplated the risk of staying to fight or attempting to escape under the cover of night. Ultimately, they decided to wait until nightfall to potentially confront the savages or escape if needed.|"['1.

The group carefully planned their attack. Each person was assigned a specific role, carrying a glowing brand and squibs. When they neared the savages, they were to lay down their guns and ignite the squibs. The goal was to create chaos and panic among the Indians. The sequence of actions was rehearsed multiple times to avoid mistakes. Maria stayed by the water, ready to retreat if needed. After dark, they packed up their belongings, prepared the fireworks, and breached the defenses. Maria was secured to Dias, and they advanced towards the savages. Jose scouted ahead and confirmed the absence of guards. The group positioned themselves close to the fire where the natives were gathered. Harry initiated the attack by hurling the squibs, followed by Bertie and Dias. The fireworks and gunfire caused confusion and fear among the savages, leading to their retreat.|"[""1.

Bertie joined in, and they paused to reload while Dias and José threw their remaining fireworks. By then, the last of the natives had fled.

The group spent the day searching for clues without success. Dias, José, Harry, and others positioned themselves across the valley to spot a narrow rift in a rocky peak. As midnight neared, Harry first noticed the rift, followed by Dias and José. Bertie and Maria struggled to see it. The next morning, they found the rift led to a waterfall. Dias speculated it might hide a vast treasure from the Incas. They began searching for a hidden cave. Harry, surprised by the revelation, pointed out the line leading to the waterfall.

"""There is no doubt that is the entrance to a cave,"" he said as he joined them; and the three went out beyond the fall, for the noise of the water was too great for them to converse without difficulty behind the veil of water. José stayed behind to examine.

""Well, Dias, we have found the place where the treasure is hidden, but I don't think that we are much nearer. Certainly we have not strength sufficient to clear away those fallen stones, and probably the cave is blocked by a wall several feet thick. We should want tools and blasting-powder to get through it.

Harry explained that the only ways to remove the water from the lake would be by digging a deep channel or blasting the stone in the tunnel.

""In my view, the ideal path is a pass near Mount Tinta leading to Ayapata, a town close to the peak,"" Dias suggested. ""Though steep, it's used by mules, so it should be manageable. Once over, we're only 70-80 miles from Cuzco.""

""We should fish more since hunting's been scarce,"" Maria suggested. ""Drying the fish on hot rocks will keep us fed until we can hunt.""

""The fish here would be a hit in England,"" Harry chuckled. ""But they're too easy to catch. Let's check on the mules. Maria, talk to them to calm them down.""

Dias, José, Harry, and Bertie encountered a fierce jaguar attack. José quickly fired at the jaguar leaping at their mules. Harry and Bertie followed suit, taking down the jaguar as it tried to attack. Despite some claw wounds, the jaguar was defeated. Dias, cautious of potential dangers, kept watch that night. The group learned of the pass's danger from passing muleteers and decided to avoid it, opting for a safer route.

From there, we can head nearly west, avoiding the troublesome Ayapata pass. We might face savages, but they're easier than brigands. What do you think?"" ""It's shorter, sir, and we'll avoid brigands and the ongoing troubles. We've been lucky not to encounter armies."" The journey to Cerro took three months, with good hunting and ample food.

Maria and Bertie had been on a remarkable journey, experiencing various advantages along the way. Despite encountering few people, apart from some peasant muleteers and savages, they did not feel the absence of human interaction. As they planned to explore Cerro and search for the enchanted castle Dias mentioned, they anticipated encountering new challenges. Bertie expressed concerns about the condition of the roads and the possibility of encountering desperate individuals in the mountains. Despite potential dangers, they remained hopeful and prepared for the journey ahead. The following day, their trek led them deep into the hills, where they faced challenging terrain but managed to overcome obstacles with teamwork and determination.

Yes, sir, most of the time they do not get involved in these matters. The soldiers in the armies were originally those who fought against the Spaniards. When the Spaniards left, these men were left with no purpose and were willing to join anyone who offered them pay. Additionally, there are many lazy men in the towns who contribute to the supply of armed men. It is uncertain when these issues will end. Some who came into power genuinely cared for their country and aimed to bring order and end the corruption caused by officials appointed by tyrants. However, most were ambitious soldiers who led rebellions against the current leader. If only the soldiers and officials in Peru were removed, the country could have peace and good governance.

Two brave men, Dias and Maria, devised a clever plan to outsmart their captors and secure their escape. They drugged the pisco heavily, ensuring that two glasses would render any man asleep in no time. Under the cover of darkness, Maria led the mule to a deserted hut a short distance away. Meanwhile, the brothers concealed their rifles and pistols in the straw of their bed. With the help of Dias, they planned to retrieve their weapons and make their way to safety. Despite losing their double-barrelled guns, they were grateful for the quick thinking and bravery of their rescuers.

Fortunately, no questions were asked, and they were mistaken for English travelers. In the rush to steal, the brigands paid no mind to them. If they had, they might have sent a search party for the mules or been suspicious of them. Dias decided to head to the village where their rifles were hidden. Riding fast under the full moon, they reached the village at midnight. The rifles were retrieved, and they continued their journey to Junin, resting for a day. Setting off towards Lima the next morning, they met José and the convoy. With caution due to the unrest, they planned to travel quietly for about fourteen days, carrying only essentials. They sold the horses and mule, as they could buy provisions along the way. Despite the risk of robbery, they were prepared to face any challenges on their journey.|['1.

I could not have coped without her support. My father barely talks to me. He treats me as if I had committed a grave offense, and only refrains from punishing me because disobedience to a father is not a punishable offense. It saddens me, not just for myself but for him. He used to be the kindest father until I defied him on this matter. I believe he feels the rift between us as much as I do, but he thinks he is acting in my best interest. It pains him that I don't see things his way. I am almost as sorry for him as I am for myself. I love you and would almost do anything to make him happy. However, I am not very unhappy. I have a feeling that you will succeed. I may ask you to wait another two years for me. My thoughts are always with you. I am considering telling my father that if in two years you are not in a position to claim my hand, I will abide by his wishes. You are doing so much to win me that I am almost resolved to speak to my father after the two years are up. It would make things easier if you were successful.

We must not create a mine but blast the stone like in quarries and mines. First, we need to make a hole using picks and crowbars in one corner of the room, and then make holes the size of the boring tool a foot away. After inserting charges, we fire them to bring down the rock into the hole. This process is repeated until the whole floor is done. The bigger the initial hole, the easier it is to bring down the stone. Blasting stone involves hard work, driving the borers down with sledges of different weights. It will be tough at first, but we will get used to it. From where they stood, they saw the ground falling into a valley with rock walls closing in, except for a streak of green, indicating a stream.

The remarkable structure in the ravine appeared artificial, with a narrow ledge for archers to defend. A stone staircase led to a hidden castle, cleverly concealed within a circular pit. The castle, set back from the edge, had strategic openings for defense. The rock arch above the castle provided perfect camouflage, blending seamlessly with the surrounding terrain. The castle's location was so discreet that passersby would be unaware of its existence, hidden beneath the ground level. The duo contemplated exploring further, devising a plan to descend into the pit for a closer look, ensuring safety with a rope and tree stump. The castle's ingenious design and concealed location left the explorers in awe of its strategic placement for defense and secrecy.|"['1.

Bertie and Harry discussed the mysterious building they were observing. Bertie mentioned the possibility of hidden tunnels, but the darkness made it hard to confirm. They considered lowering themselves onto a wall in the ravine to investigate further. Harry believed the side they were watching seemed unoccupied, speculating that the brighter rooms were likely on their side. They noticed two nearly skeletal figures with spears nearby. The dry air preserved the remains well. They pondered over the bodies' position, suggesting that the lack of injuries indicated no foul play. The brothers concluded that the absence of bodies on the path suggested the house was empty.

Harry and Bertie explored an ancient structure, speculating it was built by the Chimoos or a pre-Inca civilization. They discovered a hidden tunnel designed to let water flow out unseen. After three hours of exploration, they returned to their worried camp, descending a rocky slope with caution. Dias, relieved at their safe return, expressed the camp's anxiety and shared prayers for their safety. Harry explained their plan to enter the castle using a ladder or rope. Bertie joked about using a cross to ward off demons, and they resolved to spend a night inside to dispel any myths.

"Bertie chuckled, ""I expected a nice dinner, but it seems it's not started yet."" The woman, busy praying, assured him she'd start cooking. Maria, intrigued, wanted to join the adventure. Bertie planned for safety, suggesting wooden ladders and ropes. Dias and José went to fetch poles from a nearby wood. Dias also gathered branches for ladder rungs. Maria was pleased with the new poles. Dias had shot wild pigeons for dinner, recalling their nests in the rocks. He climbed down the ravine to collect them.

The group prepared for their next expedition to the castle. They discussed the need for more supplies like rope, a longer ladder, and firewood. Harry suggested cutting down stumps for firewood to stock up. The next morning, they moved their belongings and had breakfast. Carrying the heavy ladder up the ravine was tough, but they managed to secure it against the wall. As they climbed, they marveled at the hidden location of the castle. Upon reaching the top, they discovered a room with pillars and carvings. Dias spotted figures in the room, but Harry reassured him they meant no harm. Upon closer inspection, they realized the figures were skeletons dressed in rough cloth. Donna Maria gasped in surprise.|['1.

"Two or three hundred, I should think. Your legends are evidently true, Dias. There was a party left here to keep strangers from entering this place. Before we go farther, let us think this out. We will sit down on the window ledge. Take a good look at their arms and skulls, Dias. You have often been with travelers to the ruins; let us hear what you say."" Dias, now assured he had to deal with humans, examined them carefully, looking at the ornaments still hanging round their necks, and said: ""They are not the old people, señor; these were Incas."" ""That is an important point; now let us see how this is to be explained. Now,"" he said, as they sat down, ""it is clear that the Incas did know this building. They may have discovered treasures here or they may not; but it would seem that they were as anxious as the Chimoos had been to keep its existence a secret. It is certain they must have had some interest in doing so. We have reason to believe the Spaniards did not know of it. There is no doubt these men were not killed in fight; their sitting position proves they died quietly, probably at the same time. We see no signs of food; we may find some as we search the place.

Tomorrow morning, Bertie and his companions plan to respectfully handle the bones of men who died in service to their country. They decide not to discard them carelessly but to place them in leather bags and bury them in the valley. In a well-lit room, they discover metal brackets for torches, indicating the importance of the chamber. Harry identifies the metal as silver, suggesting potential wealth in the building.

The two stories above were almost identical, except for the absence of dividing mats and female ornaments. As they walked towards the narrow end, they noticed a different-shaped opening for light compared to the rooms below. It seemed that the shape had been altered from its original form. The opening was three feet high and six inches wide in the middle, but a foot from the bottom, there was a wide cut, a foot high and three feet wide. Dias was surprised to find two skeletons below it, suggesting they might have been on watch when they died. The unique opening sloped sharply, offering a view of the rocks below, likely used to drop stones on approaching boats.

Harry and Bertie explored the castle, finding rooms filled with ancient treasures. They discovered a room with spear-shafts, arrows, shields, and cloth in excellent condition. Moving on, they found compartments with sacks of grain and leather bags, suggesting a past struggle with hunger. The duo speculated that the garrison once strong had dwindled over time, leading to starvation. Traces of penned animals and hay indicated past uses.

The ancient tunnel had two rooms above it that spanned the house's width, unlike the rooms below which were narrower due to the rock walls on either side. The tunnel was wide at twelve feet, with walls about three feet thick. The construction lacked bricks or cut stones, using longer stones that projected over each other, forming a stable structure. Inside, a sunken tank with water was found, likely fed by a pipe from outside. The rooms alongside the tunnel were thought to be used as prisons, with the upper rooms serving as living quarters. The strategic design made it difficult for enemies to access, ensuring a secure water supply and defense.

Harry mentioned that they would bury the bodies when they moved camp the next morning. He acknowledged they forgot two bodies at a window but decided they could dispose of them the following day. The group returned to the castle in silence, feeling the gloom and emptiness of the hall. Donna Maria, usually talkative, was still shaken by the bats' sudden departure. After a meal, their spirits lifted. José awaited them with a warm fire and was briefed on their findings. He speculated that the castle might have been a fortress or prison pre-Incas, later used by the Incas. The group discussed the possibility of hidden treasure, speculating on a lost ship carrying riches. Despite successful searches, they pondered the challenges of finding treasure, especially in the lower chambers near water levels.

"Dias nodded seriously. He had been with travelers who had done a lot of digging, and he could grasp Harry's point. Maria, who was listening attentively, also understood. José just rolled cigarettes and smoked them. It was a matter for his elders, and he didn't even try to follow Harry's words. After a few minutes of silence, Bertie spoke up, ""But the floors are all level."" ""Yes, that's what I mean. The tunnel slopes down its own height. It's twelve feet high at the entrance, and at the lower end, it's a few inches below ground level, so it descends at least twelve feet. At the end with the cistern, the basement floor is only a few inches above the passage's bottom; thus, at the other end, it must be twelve feet above the water level."" ""You're right, Bertie!"" Harry exclaimed. ""I should've thought of it! There must be a space underneath it a hundred feet long, sloping from nothing down to twelve feet. There's room for a dozen chambers like the ones we saw on each side of the tunnel. Well done, Bertie! You've given me renewed hope.

Dias set off early with the llamas and mules. The group packed up, leaving supplies at the campsite. Harry suggested leaving maize for the mules and burying bones before moving to a castle. They made several trips carrying items to a ladder by the window. José helped haul things up. They planned to keep a fire burning for warmth and cheer. Harry and Dias set up a sleeping area with blankets. Señora preferred to have an open view of the fire. They lit a bright, smokeless fire in the room. Harry even dug a hole in the wall for ventilation.|['1. What did Harry suggest leaving for the mules before moving to a castle?\nA) Hay\nB) Maize\nC) Oats\nD) Carrots\nE) Apples', '2.

José skillfully crafted a sturdy support for Maria's cooking pots by securing a sapling to an upright beam. This ingenious setup allowed Maria to adjust the height of her pots above the fire. As they settled in for the night, Harry suggested hanging blankets to keep out bats. They waited until dusk when a silent stream of bats exited the cave. After the bats departed, the blankets were hung to prevent their return. The brothers discussed the possibility of eating bats if food became scarce, comparing them to other unconventional meals like monkeys and rats. As dawn approached, the bats returned, only to be deterred by the closed entrance. The brothers watched as the bats circled outside before eventually flying away. The next morning, they were greeted by the chirping of bats, signaling the start of a new day.|"[""1.

Harry expressed his relief that the mysterious flitting shadows were likely gone. Maria, who had been frightened, felt safe upon hearing their voices. The brothers planned to clean the lower rooms and explore. They swam in the pool, diving beyond the roof. Climbing the rocks carefully, they marveled at the castle's hidden location. The stone of the castle blended with the cliffs, concealing it from view. They speculated on the purpose of peculiar openings in the structure. The rocks around the castle helped shield it from the sea, making it nearly invisible to passing boats. The brothers admired the strategic design of the hidden dwelling as they surveyed the surroundings from their rocky perch.|['1.

Rocks along the coast not only break the force of waves but also protect the house from heavy storms. Without them, the house would need to be built much stronger to withstand the sea. The rocks may have been taller in the past, possibly hiding the house. To explore the house, Maria and Bertie made brooms to clear the dust. They decided against using fire for light, opting for torches instead. Sweeping away the dust revealed a clear path and a stone cut in the floor. Further examination showed the stone was a natural fracture, indicating how the floor was constructed. This method helped them uncover the layout without needing a fire for light.|"['1.

It is likely that the ancient builders did not have the tools to cut hard stones like this one easily. They might have used a saw without teeth and kept the stone wet with sand to slowly cut through it. Another method could have been driving dry wedges into the cut and then moistening them to create a straight edge. The effort put into making such a smooth floor indicates a strong motive behind it. The stones found were of varying sizes but fit closely together. Removing them will be challenging, especially near the rock wall. Careful planning is needed to avoid scattering the stones and ensure a successful explosion if needed. Despite the challenges, the work ahead is not without its risks, particularly with the presence of dangerous animals like pumas or jaguars in the vicinity.|['1.

There was a plan to remove brackets from the walls using pickaxes. Maria volunteered to hold a torch while others worked. They took turns chipping away at the stones to extract the brackets, finding them heavier than expected. After a long day's work, they rested and smoked. The next day, they continued, extracting more brackets. Dias arrived, and they helped him carry provisions up. Dias explained his purchase of powder for mining. They discussed the value of the brackets and the need for tools. The group made progress but knew the work below would be slower.|"['1.

Dias shared a tale of a muleteer who found himself in a perilous situation in the mountains. Faced with the threat of brigands, he sought refuge in a hidden cavern. Inside, he discovered stolen goods and a vast chamber. However, he lost his way in the darkness and injured his foot. Desperate for relief, he used a bat as a poultice and found comfort in its application. Eventually, he noticed a faint light and a stream of bats entering through a hole. Despite his efforts to climb out, he remained stranded until daylight.

As the sun set, the bats emerged once more, and the man knew he had to rest his ankle to have a chance. The next morning, he hunted more bats, battling thirst. Desperate, he drank one's blood and ate another raw. Feeling stronger the following morning, he tried again, consuming another bat for energy. This time, he succeeded in descending the hillside and locating his mules higher up the pass. He loaded them up and left without encountering the robbers. Returning with torches, he retrieved silver from the cave, becoming wealthy. Discussing their plans, Dias mentioned his ankle poultice, sparking a conversation on blasting for treasure. They decided to sweep the treasure chambers the next day, leaving the powder kegs in a safe room. Safety first, they agreed, as they prepared to uncover the secrets hidden within the ancient chambers.|['1.

Before descending, they planned to prepare wooden pieces with pegs to hold candles for better lighting while working. Dias and José cleared the chambers, dealing with the dusty residue. Harry and Bertie offered to help but were declined. They inspected the floor for clues of treasure, focusing on the chambers' depth. Harry suggested starting midway to avoid missing the treasure. They decided to sink a bore-hole near a crack, aiming to extract a piece by driving it in a slanting direction. Dias started the process, and the stone began to crumble. Adjusting their strategy, they considered driving the hole straight down. Dias prepared to strike the borer, ensuring safety precautions were in place.|['1.

Dias started cautiously, gradually increasing the force of his strikes as he found the right distance. Harry rotated the borer after each blow. When José took a turn, he was nervous and barely missed hitting Harry's fingers. Feeling afraid, José suggested holding the borer while others struck. Dias proposed practicing outside in soft ground to build confidence and accuracy. They worked together, initially missing the borer heads or hitting unevenly. Despite the initial difficulty, they persevered, taking breaks to ease the pain. After three days of practice, they improved their accuracy and gained confidence.

Harry and his team were determined to break through the stone. They tried various methods, from using sledgehammers to drilling holes. After days of hard work, they decided that drilling a line of holes close to each other might be the best plan. The team spent six more days driving holes according to Harry's plan, but they only found sand and small stones. Despite the challenges in sharpening the drills, they persevered. Bertie took charge of keeping the drills in good condition. While Bertie worked on the drills, José and Donna Maria conversed in Spanish. The team welcomed Sundays for a well-deserved break, engaging in activities like bathing, fishing, or relaxing in the shade. Rested and rejuvenated, they would resume their work with renewed energy the following day.|"['1.

Two weeks into their work, the team was ready to dig into a new stone in the cellar. They believed this spot was ideal for an underground chamber. The stone appeared whole until Dias noticed it was cleverly pieced back together. As they examined it closely, they found cracks and irregularities. They decided to use wedges to break it open. After some effort, the stone split, revealing another slab beneath it. Harry suspected they had reached the top of a vault. Peering inside, he feared it might be empty. The stone had been meticulously repaired, suggesting something hidden below.|['1.

Harry and his companions continued their excavation, uncovering a hidden slab with a copper ring in the middle. They used crowbars to lift the slab, revealing an empty vault. Concerned about the air quality, they tested it with a torch and decided it was safe to descend. Harry peered into the vault and confirmed it was empty. Disappointed but not surprised, he speculated that the hidden treasure may have been found by others before them.

"None of the others spoke. Bertie was disappointed but optimistic. ""Well, better luck next time. They may have found this place, but there may be others they missed,"" he said. Harry, with José's help, lowered himself down the chamber to find gold traces. After examining, Harry climbed back up, suggesting they take a break for the day.

Four people were sent aboard the ship named _Esmerelda_ which set sail the previous day, while the others are waiting for available berths. It is hoped that some may secure spots on the two ships mentioned, but they have not applied yet. There is a possibility that some crew members might abandon the ship before departure, and they would be better compensated if they joined as part of the crew rather than just working their way home. Dias, after selling the silver, returned to the castle a week earlier with mules. He packed bags, ensuring the gold was hidden among rocks facing the entrance for quick shipment.

Mr. Fortescue, taken aback, acknowledged, ""Your revelation is indeed surprising and changes the situation. I must reflect on this new information, consult my wife, and confirm my daughter's stance. However, I must ask for a day to consider this turn of events.""

Mr. Prendergast respectfully replied, ""I understand, sir. But I implore you to allow me to speak with Miss Fortescue promptly. It has been two years of separation, causing her great distress. I wish to allay her concerns about my safety without delay.""

Mr. Fortescue relented, ""Given the circumstances, your request is reasonable. You will find her in the drawing-room with her mother. It is best to wait until the situation is formally resolved before speaking with her alone."""|['1.
