Quietly, a small group started to gather. Nora, as the chief bridesmaid, followed the flower girls. She was dressed in a white satin wedding gown and carried a large bunch of white roses.

Her veil, made of exquisite yellow-white lace passed down through generations, was a family heirloom. Jessica's bouquet was a cascade of lilies of the valley. Her fair skin looked even more radiant, and her blue eyes sparkled with joy. The bridesmaids wore white chiffon over pale green chiffon, creating a misty sea-foam effect. Delicate green satin belts and hair accessories made of chiffon flowers and satin leaves completed their outfits. They held bouquets of white sweet peas. The bridal party descended the stairs to Mendelssohn's wedding march, played by the orchestra in a corner of the hall. The orchestra, known for playing during the Eight Originals' high school days, added a nostalgic touch. Jessica had joked that it would feel wrong to get married without their music. At the bottom of the stairs, Jessica's father awaited her. The party proceeded slowly to the parlor, transformed into a green fairyland.

Grace did not object to Evelyn's news. After the stern talk she got, Evelyn was unlikely to lie again. The next day, Grace met Miss Hilton by chance on campus, who confirmed Evelyn's story about the dance. Miss Hilton even asked if Grace was invited to chaperone. Grace wasn't surprised or upset about not being asked by Evelyn. She was relieved and decided she wouldn't have accepted anyway. The days until she could go home felt both long and short.
