Grace, a year older than Sylvia, explained more about Sylvia's name to her. The two girls attended Miss Patten's school, where they had a pleasant teacher and enjoyed the view of the harbor. Miss Patten only allowed twelve students in her class, and Sylvia was lucky to be one of them.

"Grace had been pondering all morning about whether the men in Charleston would really send off the soldiers in the forts. She hadn't discussed this with Sylvia as they walked along the street facing the harbor. Now, gazing at the distant forts guarding the harbor entrance, she decided to ask Miss Rosalie why the United States would interfere with the ""Sovereign State of South Carolina,"" as her father had mentioned that it would defend its rights. During ""question time"" before the morning session ended, each student could ask a question. Today, several girls had questions, and Grace patiently waited for her turn. When Miss Rosalie called her name, Grace stood up and inquired, ""Who would question South Carolina's right to control all forts on its territory?"" The other girls were puzzled by the conversation and the topic of taking Fort Sumter or Fort Moultrie. Elinor Mayhew mentioned the northern people's desire to take away slaves but doubted they could take the forts. The girls decided to ask their fathers for more information. Elinor made a disparaging remark about Yankees, causing Grace to defend Sylvia from the unkind words.

Flora and Sylvia shared striking similarities in appearance with blue eyes and similar hair color. Flora was known for her friendly nature, contrasting Elinor's tendency to tease younger girls. Flora enlightened Sylvia about the significance of the forts being moved to Washington and the ownership shift to the U.S. government. Despite feeling uneasy about Elinor, Sylvia decided not to share her school experiences with her mother. During a family outing to Fort Moultrie, Sylvia learned about Yankees and enjoyed sailing with her father. The pleasant day made her forget Elinor's unkindness. Sylvia's parents discussed their black servants and Aunt Connie, the cook. At the fort, Captain Carleton shared insights about the sand-banks.

"Sylvia stood still, realizing Elinor's hatefulness. Remembering her father's words about Americans being called ""Yankees,"" she bravely walked to the arbor. Elinor and the girls surrounded her, pushing her towards the shore. Sylvia, with bruised knees and hands, didn't resist or cry out. Angry and miserable, she decided not to tell anyone what had happened. Determined, she thought of making Elinor regret her actions.

"Sylvia wandered along the shore until she reached the wharf, watching the workers. She wished someone could guide her home. Suddenly, a tall man in uniform approached. ""Lucky you're here. Come aboard,"" he said kindly. The Captain tended to her hands and face, distracting her with talk of the schooner. Sylvia, tired, fell asleep on the vessel. Meanwhile, back on land, confusion arose about the arms being transported to Fort Sumter. The Captain forgot about Sylvia until they were near the fort.

As they walked down the street, Estralla quietly followed behind, her feet making no sound. Occasionally, she held back a small cry of worry. The young colored girl feared for her new friend's safety. When Mrs. Fulton arrived at the school door, Miss Patten was concerned. Elinor Mayhew and May Bailey exchanged worried glances, suspecting that Sylvia had shared the incident with her mother. They anticipated trouble. Unnoticed, Estralla roamed the paths, overhearing older girls talk. She realized they had scared Sylvia. Determined to find her, Estralla spotted Sylvia's ribbon caught on a vine.

"""Don't worry,"" whispered Estralla reassuringly, ""I won't let them take you away. I know how slaves are captured. Yes, I do. My mom told me. They snatch people and sell them to others. I won't let them have you, Missy."" Tears welled up in Estralla's eyes. She had seen her own brother sold and taken to Florida. She feared the same fate for herself. The ship was moving fast, and Sylvia, curious, asked where they were headed. Estralla's words made her anxious. As they reached Fort Sumter, Estralla sneaked them onto the deck, determined to save Sylvia. They crept towards the stern, unnoticed.
