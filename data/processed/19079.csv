Lightfoot, the Deer, explained to Peter Rabbit that he likes to be alone when his new antlers are growing. He finds it uncomfortable and prefers not to be seen without them. Lightfoot mentioned that his old antlers dropped off last spring, but he didn't remember where. He described how the new antlers started as soft and tender with a skin covering and fur-like hairs. They grew quickly, and he could see them getting longer every day. Lightfoot had to protect them from damage as they were still forming. Peter found it hard to believe Lightfoot's story since he hadn't seen the antlers grow himself.

Lightfoot, the deer, proudly displayed his magnificent antlers to Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare. Lightfoot explained how his antlers grew long and hard before becoming pointed. Once they stopped growing, the blood flow ceased, and the skin covering them dried and split. Lightfoot rubbed off the remaining skin on trees and bushes, leaving behind small rags that would soon disappear. Lightfoot felt ready to face any challenge, except when humans carried guns. Peter admired Lightfoot's antlers and marveled at how quickly they grew. Jumper warned Peter about Lightfoot's fierce side when angered. Despite the beauty of autumn, a sense of fear loomed over the Green Meadows and Forest, unsettling the peaceful creatures during what should be a carefree and joyful season.|"['1.

Peter and his fellow forest creatures were gripped by the Spirit of Fear. It wasn't the usual fear of predators like Reddy Fox or Redtail the Hawk. This fear was different, brought by the distant sound of a hunter's gun. The forest dwellers, from Bob White to Lightfoot the Deer, felt its chilling grip. Even big Buster Bear was not immune. Peter pondered the cruelty of men, finding pleasure in hunting them. Sammy Jay, an early riser, knew the safest time to scavenge for food was at dawn in human dooryards. On one such morning, Sammy found himself surprised by a man stepping out of a farmhouse, highlighting the constant danger lurking in the forest.|"[""1.

Sammy perched at the top of a tree and noticed a man carrying a gun. Curious, Sammy wondered if the man was after Peter Rabbit, Reddy Fox, or Mr. and Mrs. Grouse. He decided to keep an eye on the hunter as he headed towards the Green Forest. Sammy suspected it was Lightfoot the Deer the man was after, so he decided to warn him. Remembering a game of hide and seek between Danny Meadow Mouse and Buster Bear, Sammy realized Lightfoot faced a much more challenging game with the hunter. Unlike Danny, Lightfoot's large size made it difficult for him to hide. Despite the odds, Sammy was determined to warn Lightfoot of the impending danger.|"['1.

Lightfoot, a wise deer, understood the dangers of the hunter's terrible gun. He recalled the lessons learned from the previous hunting season, knowing forgetting even one could be fatal. When Sammy Jay's warning cries revealed the hunter's location, Lightfoot used the Merry Little Breezes to detect the man's scent. Carefully, Lightfoot maneuvered behind the hunter, relying on his keen nose to track the danger. The hunter, skilled and cautious, searched for signs of Lightfoot, unaware that the deer was trailing him. Lightfoot trusted the breezes to alert him of any threats, moving with the wind to stay informed. The hunter, aware of Lightfoot's tactics, used the wind to his advantage, but Sammy Jay's timely warning saved the deer from a potentially deadly encounter.|"[""1.

As the hunter cautiously followed Lightfoot's tracks in the Green Forest, he realized that Lightfoot had outsmarted him by circling back to avoid his scent. The game of wit between the hunter and the deer was intense. Lightfoot, well-versed in evading hunters, relied on the wind to keep him safe. The hunter, on the other hand, used his skills to track Lightfoot's movements, reading subtle signs like upturned leaves and crushed moss. Both were determined to outwit each other in this dangerous game. Lightfoot, alert to the slightest sound, moved carefully to stay ahead of the hunter, always keeping the wind in his favor to avoid detection. The tense pursuit continued as each tried to anticipate the other's next move in the silent forest.|"[""1.

Lightfoot the Deer journeyed through the Green Forest, following the direction of the Merry Little Breezes. He relied on his keen sense of smell, much like we rely on our eyes, to detect scents and potential dangers. By keeping the Merry Little Breezes in his face, he could avoid any lurking threats. Lightfoot sensed the presence of Reddy Fox and Buster Bear through faint scents but continued cautiously, ensuring safety. He trusted the Merry Little Breezes to alert him to the scent of humans, his biggest threat.

Lightfoot swiftly bounded away and circled back quietly to a pile of branches left by woodchoppers near the top of a hill. He hid behind the brush, watching his old trail for any signs of the hunter. As time passed, the forest seemed peaceful, with Mr. and Mrs. Grouse flying by, Unc' Billy Possum preparing for winter, and Jumper the Hare settling down for a nap. Despite the calm surroundings, Lightfoot remained vigilant, knowing danger could be lurking when least expected. Suddenly, he heard a faint snap of a stick in the distance.

Through the Green Forest, Lightfoot the deer moved silently as the hunter passed by below. Tracking Lightfoot was challenging as the dry ground didn't hold any traces of his steps. The hunter followed the breeze, knowing Lightfoot had moved in that direction. Lightfoot stayed still until the hunter disappeared and then headed towards Paddy's pond, a quiet spot he hoped the hunter wouldn't find. Lightfoot approached the pond cautiously, wary of potential hunters lurking near water. He knew the dangers of being careless and always stayed alert. As he neared the water, a sudden crash startled him, but he realized it was Paddy the Beaver at work. This assured Lightfoot that the area was safe, and he could quench his thirst without fear of danger.|"[""1.

Lightfoot hurried cautiously to the bank, spotting Paddy the Beaver gathering food. Lightfoot knew Paddy's presence meant safety, as Paddy was shy and only worked in the daytime undisturbed. Paddy, noticing Lightfoot, swam to his food pile and greeted him warmly. Lightfoot confided in Paddy about the hunters already on the lookout, making him uneasy. Paddy sympathized and admired Lightfoot's antlers, expressing confusion over why such a majestic creature would be hunted. Lightfoot, reflecting sadly, speculated that his beauty might make him a target. Paddy, thoughtful, chewed on a twig, pondering the unfortunate situation.|"['1.

Paddy the Beaver heard a small snap and knew danger was near. He slapped the water, warning Lightfoot the Deer. Lightfoot quickly hid, watching the hunter from afar. The hunter, tracking Lightfoot, found his footprints near the pond. The hunter decided to wait, hoping Lightfoot would return.

For a while, there was no movement in the surroundings. Then, the sound of fast wings could be heard from the direction of the Big River, and Mr. and Mrs. Quack landed in the pond with a splash. They sat on the water, cautious and alert, ensuring there was no danger nearby. Paddy the Beaver contemplated warning them but decided to wait. The hunter, tempted to shoot the ducks, resisted, focusing on Lightfoot the Deer. Meanwhile, Bobby Coon appeared, unsuspecting, and meticulously washed his food by the water. Lightfoot observed everything from a distance, understanding the hunter's intentions.

When Reddy Fox arrived at Paddy the Beaver's pond, a hunter spotted him instantly, along with Lightfoot the Deer. Reddy approached cautiously, his eyes gleaming at the sight of Mr. and Mrs. Quack, his favorite dinner choice. As the Ducks fed near the dam, the hunter debated scaring them away to prevent Reddy from catching them. Just as he was about to act, Sammy Jay appeared, alerting the Ducks to the danger. Startled, Mr. and Mrs. Quack swiftly swam away, leaving Reddy frustrated and chased off by Sammy's warning calls. The hunter, though tempted to interfere, watched as the events unfolded, realizing Sammy had foiled Reddy's plans once again.

The hunter, hidden near Paddy the Beaver's pond, quietly chuckled, laughing without a sound. He found it amusing that Sammy Jay's warning about Mr. and Mrs. Quack was a prank on Reddy Fox.

Initially, he thought they were after another animal like Reddy Fox, but a dreadful suspicion crept in - the hounds were after him.

Poor Lightfoot felt that the world was unjust as he faced the challenge of escaping from the hunters and their hounds. He believed that men were heartless for hunting him with such determination. Despite not knowing that the hounds were out for their own pleasure and that it was against the law to hunt him with dogs, Lightfoot still felt the pressure of being constantly pursued. As he grew tired and realized that he might not escape the hunters or the hounds, Lightfoot made a daring decision. He ran towards the Big River, his only hope for survival.
