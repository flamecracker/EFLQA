In the 19th century, Europe saw significant changes in both politics and industry. Nations fought for independence, like Belgium from Holland and Italy from Austrian rulers, while Germany unified into an empire. Industrial advancements, starting in England, revolutionized manufacturing with steam engines, leading people to move from rural areas to cities. This period also marked colonial expansion, with Spain, Portugal, France, and England settling in the Americas and Asia. Great Britain's colonies in Canada, India, and Africa were seen as sources of wealth, inspiring other European nations to seek colonies for power and resources. Africa was divided among European powers, and China faced potential partition until American intervention. This era saw most of the world come under European control, except for China and Japan.|['1.

Germany underwent significant changes in the 19th century, particularly after the defeat of Napoleon. A German Confederation was established, uniting thirty-nine states with a fragile bond. Two powerful states within this confederation were Austria and Prussia. While Austria had a long history of influence, its rulers were deemed incompetent and corrupt. In contrast, Prussia, with its strong military service, emerged as a formidable force. Under the leadership of Bismarck, Prussia adopted a policy of military aggression to achieve its ambitions. Through wars with Austria and France, Prussia secured dominance, leading to the establishment of the German Empire. Despite remarkable industrial progress, Germany's government remained autocratic, with power concentrated in the hands of the emperor and the elite. The educational system aimed to maintain control over the masses, promoting militarism and belief in future wars for prosperity.|['1.

Austria-Hungary was a diverse monarchy in 1910 with a population of 49 million, consisting of various peoples speaking different languages and following distinct customs. Despite the presence of Germans, Hungarians, Slavic races, Roumanians, and Italians, the Germans and Hungarians held political control and tried to suppress the languages and cultures of the others. The monarchy, under the Hapsburg royal family, faced unrest and uprisings in the 19th century. Austria was part of the German Confederation until 1866 when she was expelled by Prussia. The emperor, Francis Joseph, maintained unity through juggling suffrage and elections to keep the ruling minorities in power. Austria-Hungary's economy was largely agricultural, lagging behind other nations in industrial development. Italy, on the other hand, was divided into small states ruled by despotic princes, with the Pope governing a significant portion of the land. Throughout the 19th century, Italians began to recognize their common race and the need to end foreign rule for their national welfare.|['1.

In 1870, Italy achieved national unity through the efforts of three significant leaders. Garibaldi, known for his courage and patriotism, inspired the youth to unite Italy and expel foreigners through military campaigns. Count Cavour, a skilled statesman, believed in a united Italy with foreign support, strategically securing France and England's backing while working with revolutionists like Garibaldi. Victor Emmanuel, the King of Sardinia, favored a limited monarchy similar to England's system and played a crucial role in uniting Italy under a constitutional monarchy. The new Italian kingdom, except for Rome and Venice, gained recognition among European nations. In 1870, Victor Emmanuel declared Rome as the capital. On the other hand, Belgium, after a tumultuous history under various rulers, became an independent constitutional monarchy recognized by major European powers. France underwent revolutions, transitioning from a republic to a monarchy and then to an empire under Napoleon III, ultimately facing defeat in the Franco-Prussian War.|"[""1.

During the 19th century, Great Britain underwent gradual reforms, unlike many European countries facing sudden revolutions. England, Scotland, and Ireland already had representative institutions. Reforms were implemented through a natural lawmaking process, evolving the government from aristocratic to democratic principles. By 1884, the suffrage in Great Britain was nearly as extensive as in the United States, making Parliament truly representative of the people's will. Social reforms improved housing, regulated labor hours, and established a national insurance system. Great Britain's wealth and commerce grew rapidly due to industrial advancements in coal, iron, and factory production. The country's dependence on food imports led to a strong navy to protect commerce and colonies. England's colonial system evolved into a vast empire, promoting English liberty and self-governing communities within the dominions. Loyalty during the Great War was unwavering, with colonies contributing men and resources, showcasing the success of British colonial governance.|"['1.

In 1453, the Turks conquered Constantinople, expanding their influence in southeastern Europe. For centuries, they dominated the Balkan peninsula, conquering Hungary, Austria, Greece, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania. The diverse subjects under Turkish rule varied in language, religion, and culture, with the Turks being Muslim and their European subjects mainly Greek Orthodox Christians. By the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Turks lost most of their European territories due to oppressive rule and barbaric methods. Despite European powers preventing Russia from seizing Constantinople, smaller nations like Greece, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania gained independence. By the outbreak of the Great War, Turkey retained only a small area and population. Meanwhile, in 1914, Russia, ruled by czars, faced internal strife despite progress like the abolition of serfdom. Russia's failed attempts at expansion and conflicts with neighboring states marked its tumultuous history.|"[""1.

Russia, a vast country with abundant resources and a large population, lacked experience in self-government before the war. A small ruling class, led by the Czar, controlled the country's immense power and wealth. When a rebellion successfully overthrows such a government, chaos ensues as people lose self-control. True liberty and self-government can only thrive when everyone respects and follows the laws created by the majority. It is hoped that Russia will soon achieve this balance.

Before 1870, Prussia had gained territory and prestige through war. Prussian kings boasted of expanding their lands through successful wars. Conquered nations paid indemnities, which boosted the conqueror's economy by funding manufacturers and merchants. However, the destruction caused by war is a national loss. Germany desired French iron mines and Belgian coal deposits, crucial for industry. They also sought ports for better export access, like Antwerp and Rotterdam. Germany aimed for Russian land to accommodate its surplus population and expand its territory. German leaders pursued a Pan-Germanist agenda to unite German-speaking peoples and control various territories. Additionally, Germany sought more colonies for resources, markets, and naval bases. The need for colonies arose due to Germany's limited food production and the necessity to safeguard commerce during war.|"['1.

"Germany in the early 1900s aimed to expand its colonies through war and dominance over Turkey and Africa. Seeking a ""place in the sun,"" Germany sought to challenge Britain's global power by acquiring colonies and coaling stations. German thinkers believed in the survival of the fittest, applying it to nations and justifying war as a means to prove superiority. They envisioned Germanizing the world by imposing their culture, or _Kultur_, on other nations. This belief led to the idea of imposing _Kultur_ forcibly if necessary. The German desire for world dominance through war and cultural imposition raised questions about the ethics of imposing one nation's ideals on others.

Militarism is a policy where large armies are maintained for aggressive purposes. Not every nation with a large army is considered militaristic. In Germany, the military had significant control over the government. After Napoleon's conquest of Prussia, the king enrolled men for short periods to build a large army. Officers were mostly from the nobility, leading to a powerful military class. This militaristic approach made the military and civil interests align. The possession of a strong military made Germany arrogant in international relations. This led to a competition in armaments as other nations feared Germany's military might. Germany also expanded its navy, challenging Britain's naval supremacy. This competition in military and naval power was a burden on both countries' people.|"[""1.

"**INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE CALL FOR PEACE**

In the modern world, communities are made up of citizens who abide by their laws. With improved communication, the concept of a global community of nations has emerged. International law governs how nations interact, covering areas like treaty obligations, protection of ambassadors, and rights of citizens in foreign lands. This law is based on centuries-old agreements and customs.

Efforts to strengthen international law have been made through treaties and conferences. The German Empire, however, has resisted this trend, believing in controlling weaker nations for its benefit. Advocates for a global community argue that accepting international law can reduce conflicts and promote peace.

Despite the rise of peace movements and public support for global harmony, governments have been slow to act.

In 1899, Czar Nicholas II organized an international conference in The Hague to address the escalating threat of wars due to the increasing militarism in Europe. Despite the Czar's proposal to limit the growth of armaments and military expenditures, the conference failed to achieve any significant progress, primarily because of Germany's strong opposition to disarmament. Although the conference aimed to establish a permanent international court of arbitration for peaceful dispute resolution, Germany's reluctance to mandatory arbitration hindered the process. Ultimately, the conference's resolution highlighted the importance of reducing military expenses for the greater welfare of humanity. While the conference faced challenges, it laid the groundwork for future efforts towards international peace and conflict resolution.|"['1.

"The Hague Tribunal is unique because it doesn't have permanent judges like a regular court. Instead, each country selects individuals of high status and broad knowledge in international affairs, with no more than four representatives per nation. When disputes arise, the conflicting parties can choose from this pool to form a special court or tribunal. The second Hague Conference in 1907, attended by 47 nations, aimed to address the horrors of modern warfare following destructive conflicts like the Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War. While efforts to discuss disarmament and compulsory arbitration didn't succeed due to Germany's opposition, the conference focused on creating ""the Hague Conventions,"" establishing rules for warfare conduct to reduce its brutality.

Between 1870 and 1914, Europe saw a rise in tensions among powerful nations due to economic growth and envy. The chapter explores why these international rivalries grew during this time and how nations formed alliances. One key issue was the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. France had to cede these territories to Germany, causing deep humiliation and resentment. The German rule in Alsace-Lorraine was harsh, banning French language teaching, enforcing military service, and suppressing French culture. This oppressive regime fueled French animosity towards Germany. The longing to reclaim Alsace-Lorraine remained a sore point for France, symbolized by the mourning wreath placed on Strassburg's statue in Paris every July 14, France's national day. The hope of regaining these lost territories fueled French resentment towards Germany.|"['1.

"""Italia Irredenta"" translates to ""unredeemed Italy"" in Italian. This term describes Italian-speaking territories bordering Italy, still under foreign rule, mainly by Austria. The Italians believe their unity remains incomplete until these lands are redeemed. The Trentino and some areas near the Adriatic, including Trieste, are part of Italia Irredenta. The situation led to tension between Italy and Austria, contributing to Italy joining the Allies in World War I. Russia's ambition to control Constantinople for an ice-free trade port caused international tensions before the war. This ambition threatened Turkey's existence, with England intervening twice to prevent Russia from taking Constantinople. Russia's interest in the Balkans, driven by the pan-Slavic movement, conflicted with Austria-Hungary's desire for Balkan territories for seaports, leading to rivalry before the war."|"['1.

Italy was concerned about the Balkan question due to the fear that Austrian annexation of Balkan lands would threaten Italian interests. This, along with the ongoing Italia Irredenta issue, fueled hostility between Italy and Austria. Turkey, on the other hand, hoped to benefit from the tensions among major powers in the Balkans to maintain its status as a European state. Germany's desire for colonies grew as it envied other nations' vast colonial possessions. This jealousy led to conflicts with the United States over control of the Samoan Islands and resentment towards American acquisitions like the Philippines. Germany also clashed with Venezuela and France over territorial disputes, which ultimately fueled militaristic ambitions and tensions with other European powers.|"[""1.

"THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE.--The nations of Europe had various rivalries and fears, especially towards the powerful German Empire. Germany, after 1870, sought alliances to prevent challenges to its dominance. Initially, there was a League of the Three Emperors with Russia and Austria-Hungary, but it dissolved due to their Balkan disputes. Germany then allied with Austria and later sought Italy's support due to tensions with France. Italy, feeling betrayed by France's occupation of Tunis, joined Germany and Austria in the Triple Alliance (1882) for defense. 

THE TRIPLE ENTENTE.--Following the Franco-Prussian War, France and Russia, feeling isolated, formed a dual alliance. Great Britain, alarmed by Germany's naval expansion, set aside past conflicts with France and Russia to form the Triple Entente (1907) as a counterbalance to the Triple Alliance. This alliance aimed to maintain peace and stability in Europe."|"['1.

The Balkans have a rich history with diverse races. The region's states, except Montenegro, emerged from revolutions in the past century due to Turkish misrule and the influence of the republican movement post the French Revolution. The Balkans house various ancient races like Greeks, Albanians, Roumanians, Serbs, Bulgars, and Turks, with a strong Slavic element among them. The Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes form the Jugo-Slavs, while the Bulgars have a non-Slavic origin but mingled with Slavic people. Roumanians claim descent from Roman colonists, and Albanians have the oldest language in Europe. Greeks, a mixed race, have a deep connection to their ancient past, making them a progressive force in the region.|['1.

The conflict between Russia and Austria over the Balkan countries stems from their desire to inherit the weakening Ottoman Empire. Austria seeks to expand southward, while Russia aims for Constantinople and shares ties with the Balkan states. Both nations supported revolts against Turkish rule, with the revolutionists often receiving aid from either Austria or Russia. The Balkan states, including Slavs, Greeks, and Bulgarians, sometimes turned to Austria or Germany to counterbalance Russia's influence. In 1912, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and Montenegro united against Turkey, resulting in a swift defeat of the Turks. However, the Balkan allies soon clashed over territorial gains, leading to the Second Balkan War. Bulgaria, supported by Austria and Germany, faced defeat against Serbia, Greece, Romania, and Turkey, ultimately losing much of its conquered territories.|"['1.

In 1913, the German government made final preparations for war by expanding its army and investing in advanced weaponry. The Kiel Canal was widened to accommodate new battleships. Meanwhile, tensions rose between Austria-Hungary and Serbia due to Serbian discontent with Austrian rule. The assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand in 1914 by a Serbian nationalist provided Austria the excuse to declare war on Serbia, with the support of Germany. This decision, made in a secret meeting in Potsdam, set the stage for a broader European conflict, as Russia and France were likely to intervene on behalf of Serbia. The spark had been lit for what would become the Great War.|['1.

"In July 1914, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia, blaming them for the murder in Serajevo and making several harsh demands. They required Serbia to silence newspapers stirring up hatred towards Austria, disband groups promoting ""Pan-Serbism,"" remove officials accused by Austria, allow Austrian officials to investigate anti-Austrian activities, arrest implicated Serbian officials, and halt arms smuggling. Serbia agreed to most demands but rejected Austrian officials conducting investigations. Despite suggesting an international tribunal, Austria found the response unsatisfactory. Subsequently, Austria declared war on July 28, leading to widespread mobilization. Efforts for peace by Britain, France, and Italy were undermined by Germany's refusal to cooperate. Germany's ultimatums to Russia and France heightened tensions, with Berlin crowds cheering for war. The Kaiser claimed self-defense as Germany prepared for conflict."|"['1.

Russia refused to demobilize despite German threats. Consequently, on August 1, Germany declared war on Russia. Two days later, on August 3, Germany declared war on France for standing by its ally. The world's greatest war had begun. Germany assumed Britain would stay neutral due to domestic issues. But when Germany invaded Belgium, violating its neutrality, Britain demanded withdrawal. Germany refused, and on August 4, Great Britain declared war. Within a week, the Triple Entente powers were at war with Germany and Austria.

The German military strategy in World War I involved a swift attack on France before turning to Russia. The plan hinged on speed, aiming to defeat France before the Russians could mobilize. To achieve this, Germany planned to attack France from the northeast, through Belgium, relying on the flat terrain and good infrastructure for rapid advancement. However, Belgium's resistance and Britain's intervention disrupted the German timetable, allowing France to mobilize its forces. The delay in Belgium gave France and Britain crucial time to prepare, preventing the quick capture of Paris. The German invasion faced unexpected challenges due to Belgium's defiance and the subsequent resistance encountered.

During the First Battle of the Marne, General Joffre of France strategically gathered an army to attack the German invaders from the west flank. This surprise attack forced the Germans to retreat fifty miles from their advanced position. The French armies successfully saved Paris and pushed the Germans back. The following race to the coast saw the Allied forces engaging in trench warfare along the Aisne River. Both sides entrenched themselves, leading to a stalemate. The Germans aimed to reach Calais to cut off communication between England and France. The Belgians flooded lowlands to halt the German advance. The Germans committed atrocities in occupied territories, plundering resources and forcing civilians into labor.

In 1914, the German military leaders aimed to swiftly defeat France through Belgium before Russia could fully prepare for an eastern attack. However, due to Belgium's unexpected resistance, Russia gathered massive armies in Russian Poland near Berlin. To reach Berlin, Russia first needed to remove German forces from East Prussia and Austrians from Galicia. The Battle of Tannenberg in August saw General von Hindenburg's German troops triumph over the Russians. While Russia succeeded in taking Galicia, they faced challenges in East Prussia. By the year's end, Russia had made progress in Galicia but faced setbacks in the west. Meanwhile, Serbia resisted Austria successfully, forcing Austrian retreats and even reclaiming Belgrade.

"During World War I, Germany's fleet was significantly smaller than the British fleet, costing Germany over a billion dollars. Germany aimed to weaken or destroy the British fleet to disrupt British trade and troop transport. The British navy, on the other hand, focused on containing the German fleet and hunting down German ships far from home. Both nations protected their coasts with underwater mines and hidden channels. The British navy also enforced a blockade of German ports. In the Battle of Helgoland Bight, the British fleet defeated the German fleet, sinking several German ships.

NAVAL SITUATION IN 1914: By the end of 1914, the German navy was confined to port due to Allied fleet actions. German commerce raiders were either driven off or destroyed, while German merchant ships were docked in neutral or German harbors. This allowed the Allies to transport troops and supplies without fear of enemy interference. The British ships dominated the seas, while the Germans remained inactive in their ports.

In 1915, the western front remained deadlocked, with both sides unable to make significant progress despite intense battles. German forces introduced new brutal tactics like poison gas and flame-throwers, leading to suffering and casualties. The Gallipoli campaign in the east saw Allies trying to take Constantinople but facing heavy losses due to strong Turkish defenses. The campaign was eventually abandoned in 1916 after months of fighting. Along the Russian border, the Allies suffered setbacks, with the Russians losing control of Galicia and facing defeat in East Prussia.

In 1915, the Germans and Austrians launched an offensive in Galicia, forcing the Russian armies to retreat from Galicia and Poland. By September, the Central Powers had recaptured Przemysl and Lemberg, conquering all of Russian Poland. Russia lost 65,000 square miles of land, leading to starvation due to German plundering. Bulgaria, siding with the Central Powers, declared war on Serbia in October, leading to Serbia's defeat. Greece avoided joining the war on the Central Powers' side due to popular support for the Allies and Allied troops landing in Salonica. The eastern front saw the Allies facing setbacks, with the Gallipoli campaign failing and Serbia being conquered. Italy entered the war in 1915, fighting against Austria due to territorial disputes and Austrian opposition in the Balkans, facing challenges in mountain warfare against well-protected Austrian forts.|"[""1.

"During 1915, the Allies controlled the sea, tightening the blockade against the Central Powers. This impacted U.S. commerce with Germany and neutral countries like Holland and Sweden. Neutral vessels were detained in Allied ports, causing protests from the U.S. Forced by the Allies, neutral countries reduced trade with Germany due to blockades. Germany, realizing the value of submarines, began constructing U-boats. These submarines targeted British and neutral merchant vessels, leading to the sinking of the ""Lusitania"" in 1915, causing widespread horror.

President Wilson sent messages to Germany demanding that they adhere to international laws during warfare. Germany agreed not to sink liners without warning as long as they didn't resist. In 1914, German ships attacked defenseless English coastal towns like Yarmouth, Whitby, and Scarborough. These raids caused civilian casualties but had little military impact. Zeppelins, German airships, were used for bombing raids over England in 1915, causing civilian deaths. The Allies eventually retaliated by bombing German towns. As the war progressed, Zeppelin raids decreased due to British defenses. Lord Kitchener predicted a long war, leading to increased war material production. The British Empire united to support the war effort. The Allies prepared for a prolonged conflict by organizing their resources.|"['1.

"During World War I, the Germans launched a massive attack on the French stronghold at Verdun in 1916. This strategic location was crucial for the French, and losing it could lead to a retreat. The Germans had amassed troops and artillery for this offensive, with thousands of men and guns deployed. Led by the German crown prince, the Germans aimed to prove their army's strength. The intense battle at Verdun lasted from February to July, with heavy casualties on both sides.

During World War I, new military technologies like tanks and aircraft were introduced. Tanks, the British's innovative machines, played a crucial role in battles, acting as armored cruisers on land. Aircraft were increasingly valuable, initially used for observation to locate enemy positions. Balloons were also used for similar purposes. Airplane construction progressed rapidly, from observation planes to battle-planes and heavy bombers. Russian troops invaded Turkey in Asia, making significant gains in the Caucasus region and capturing key cities like Erzurum and Trebizond. In Mesopotamia, British forces faced challenges, with General Townshend's siege at Kut-el-Amara leading to surrender. In Austria-Hungary, Russian General Brusilov led successful offensives, advancing and taking many Austrian prisoners, ending the year in a stronger military position.|"['1.

In World War I, Roumania joined the Allies, aiming to expand its territory to include all Roumanians in southeastern Europe. However, the annexation of Transylvania, a region in southeastern Hungary with over two million Roumanians, was a key goal. Despite strong mountain defenses in the west, Roumania faced a threat from the Bulgarian border. By focusing on Transylvania, Roumania left its eastern border vulnerable. German and Bulgarian forces invaded, pushing Roumanian troops back. This defeat allowed the Central Powers to gain control of vital resources like oil and wheat fields. Meanwhile, in Italy, the Austrians launched a major offensive but faced challenges in supplying their troops. The Italians, aided by the Russians, pushed back the Austrians, capturing Gorizia. The Battle of Jutland in 1916 saw the British fleet clash with the German navy, resulting in losses on both sides.|"[""1.

"During 1916, German submarines sank over half of the nearly 4,000,000 tons of shipping destroyed since the war began. The sinking of the passenger steamer ""Sussex"" by a German torpedo, resulting in the deaths of eighty passengers, including two Americans, raised doubts about Germany's pledge to protect noncombatants. After evidence confirmed Germany's responsibility, President Wilson threatened to sever diplomatic ties unless Germany stopped its unlawful submarine warfare. Meanwhile, Great Britain implemented conscription to increase its army size. In Ireland, the Sinn Fein rebellion aimed for Irish independence but failed despite promises of German support.

During the winter of 1916-1917, there was limited infantry combat in France, with continuous heavy artillery fire. In spring 1917, the Allies planned a major offensive in the Somme valley, but the Germans initiated a strategic retreat to the Hindenburg line, devastating villages and leaving behind a barren landscape. This withdrawal allowed the Allies to advance, notably the Canadian forces capturing Vimy Ridge and subsequent British and French assaults resulting in significant prisoner captures and munitions. The British introduced a new tactic at Cambrai, using tanks to break through enemy defenses. The air warfare saw advancements, with aces like Guynemer achieving aerial victories. The Russian Revolution in 1917 impacted the Allied cause, leading to the downfall of the Russian government and internal political struggles.|"['1.

During the war, the Germans used bribery and plotting to weaken the Russian government. Corruption and disloyalty among Russian officials worsened the situation. Shortages of food led to discontent. By early 1917, conditions were dire, and crowds in Petrograd demanded action from the government. When soldiers were ordered to fire on the crowd, they refused and joined the protesters, sparking the Russian Revolution. Revolutionists asked the Duma to form a temporary government and informed Nicholas II of his deposition. The new government was recognized by several countries. Elections were called for a new constitution. Alexander Kerensky led a moderate government, facing opposition from extreme socialists advocating for wealth redistribution and immediate peace. Despite initial successes against Germany and Austria, the Russian army's disorganization and peace sentiments led to retreat from Galicia.|"['1.

The Bolsheviki were a radical socialist party in Russia who seized power in 1917 by overthrowing the moderate government led by Kerensky. Under the leadership of Lenine and Trotzky, they quickly announced their intentions for immediate peace and land redistribution. The Bolsheviks disbanded the representative assembly when it proved too moderate for their liking. They also negotiated an armistice with Germany, but the Germans continued their advance into Russian territory. Meanwhile, the British in Mesopotamia successfully reclaimed Kut-el-Amara and captured Bagdad in 1917, advancing further along the Tigris and Euphrates valleys.

The successful campaign in Palestine had significant outcomes. The capture of Jerusalem, under Turkish rule for centuries, brought joy to the Allied nations. Many Jews worldwide, hopeful for a Jewish state in Palestine, saw this as a step towards their dream. Militarily, the British campaign safeguarded the Suez Canal from Turkish threats. In Italy, by early 1917, the Italian forces neared Trieste. Despite initial progress, a joint Austro-German offensive reversed Italian gains. The enemy pushed the Italians back, threatening Venice. However, with British and French aid, the Italians regrouped, halting the advance at the Piave River. The Germans' unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 posed a threat to Allied shipping. Yet, increased patrols and convoy systems helped mitigate losses, ensuring continued supplies for the war effort.|"['1.

"Germany had hoped to win a quick victory in World War I by using submarines to attack ships, but this plan failed. The United States joined the war on the side of the Allies after Germany broke its promise not to attack American ships. The Zimmerman note revealed Germany's plan to involve Mexico in a war against the United States. President Wilson asked Congress to arm American ships for defense. When Russia became a democracy, the U.S. had no reason to stay out of the war. Congress declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917. Other countries like Brazil also joined the war against Germany.

In 1918, Russia faced challenges due to the German peace offensive. The Bolshevik government in Russia had arranged an armistice with the Central Powers, leading to negotiations at Brest-Litovsk. The Germans aimed to keep parts of Russian territory, which caused conflict during the peace talks. Eventually, on March 3, a peace treaty was signed, forcing Russia to surrender western provinces, recognize the independence of Ukrainia and Finland, cede districts to Turkey, and pay a massive indemnity. The treaties of Brest-Litovsk resulted in significant losses for Russia. Meanwhile, Roumania also made peace, losing territory to its enemies. Despite these events, the Allies viewed Russia as a friend, with President Wilson leading efforts to assist the Russian people. The situation was complicated by the presence of Czecho-Slovaks in Russia, who fought to join the Allies despite facing opposition from the Bolshevik government and German forces.|['1.

During World War I, Allied nations and the United States decided to intervene in Russia. American and Japanese troops landed on the east coast of Siberia to support the Czecho-Slovaks, who then decided to fight alongside the Allies. Another Allied army landed on the north coast of Russia to push back against the Bolsheviki. The hope was to overthrow the Bolshevik rule marked by chaos and famine and help Russia emerge as a democratic nation. Meanwhile, on the Western Front, Germany planned a massive offensive in 1918, aiming to defeat France and England before facing the full force of American troops. The Germans used surprise attacks, heavy artillery, and shock troops to break through Allied defenses. Despite their numerical advantage and new tactics, the Germans failed to achieve their goals, leading to a resurgence of the Allied offensive in the summer of 1918.|"['1.

During World War I, the Germans launched five major offensives between March and July 1918. The first, known as the battle of Picardy, caught the British off guard near the Somme River. Despite initial gains, the British tenacity and French reinforcements prevented the Germans from capturing key cities or splitting the Allied forces. Following this setback, a unified command under French General Foch was established. Subsequent German offensives were met with fierce resistance, particularly in Flanders and along the Marne River. By July, the Allies, bolstered by American troops, began a successful counteroffensive, pushing the Germans back and turning the tide of the war. The strategic use of tanks and coordinated Allied forces played a crucial role in these victories.|['1.

The balance of power shifted from the Germans to the Allies during the latter part of September. Foch's relentless assaults forced the enemy to retreat, abandoning their recent gains and causing devastation as they fell back. The Germans were caught off guard, unable to mount a counteroffensive. By the end of September, Foch's forces had taken back a significant amount of territory and taken a quarter-million prisoners, along with capturing thousands of cannons and machine guns. The success was attributed to the unwavering determination of British and French troops, Foch's strategic brilliance, and the support of the American forces. Meanwhile, in Italy, the Austrians failed in their offensive against the Italians, suffering heavy losses. On the Balkan front, a successful Allied offensive led to the surrender of the Bulgarians, breaking Teutonic dominance in the region. In Palestine and Syria, British advances led to the capture of tens of thousands of Turkish soldiers and key cities, prompting Turkey to seek an armistice. Austria-Hungary began to disintegrate, with various ethnic groups declaring independence amidst Italian victories.|"[""1.

The German retreat in the west marked a significant turning point in World War I. As the Germans fell back to their old lines in France, the threat of a return to trench warfare loomed. However, the Hindenburg line, a complex system of defenses extending up to ten miles from the front trenches, proved unable to withstand the Allied advance. Foch led attacks from multiple fronts, resulting in key victories for the Allies. By October 20, Belgian and British forces reclaimed the Belgian coast and strategic cities like Lens and Lille. Simultaneously, French and American troops made significant advances along the Meuse River. Facing defeat, the German government sought peace, leading to an armistice on November 11. Students can explore topics like camouflage, military strategy, and the impact of American involvement in the war for a deeper understanding of this historical period.|['1.

During World War I, the United States took several key steps to support the war effort. One of the initial actions was sending a significant part of the navy to Europe, including battleships and torpedo boats to combat German naval threats. The government also implemented conscription, enrolling men aged 21 to 31 for military training. Officers' training camps were established to prepare officers for service. Industries shifted production to supplies and munitions, aiding both the U.S. and Allied forces. Aircraft production was boosted with a substantial investment to construct airplanes and train pilots. The Liberty Motor was developed for improved airplane engines. Food and fuel control measures were implemented due to global shortages. The U.S. played a crucial role in supporting the war effort through these strategic actions.|"[""1.

During World War I, the government took steps to conserve resources and ensure supplies for the war effort. To prevent profiteering and guide people on economizing, a food commission was established. Rationing was initially voluntary but later became mandatory for wheat, flour, and sugar. Regulations were enforced with fines, store closures, and supply restrictions. Kitchens were set up to teach alternative bread-making methods. A Fuel Administrator managed fuel distribution to cope with shortages caused by increased demand and transportation issues. Transportation was streamlined under a Railroads' War Board, reducing passenger services to prioritize troop transport. The government took over railroads for efficiency. The United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation was created to expedite shipbuilding for troop and supply transport. Fabricated ships were mass-produced to meet demand quickly.|"['1.

During the war, the President seized ninety-nine German ships in U.S. ports. These ships had been in harbor since 1914, avoiding capture by British or French warships. The vessels were repaired and renamed, transporting troops and supplies. To finance the war, the government borrowed money through Liberty bonds and raised funds through taxation. The people willingly oversubscribed to multiple bond issues. The sale of War Savings Stamps allowed everyone to contribute. Taxes were increased on non-essential items to generate revenue. The government also loaned money to Allies for purchasing materials. Organizations like the Red Cross and the YMCA supported soldiers. Schools played a crucial role in educating students about the war and spreading awareness to families.|['1.

During the war, children were taught the importance of saving and thrift through campaigns like the thrift stamp and Liberty loan drives. They learned to conserve food, clothing, and property. Many kids even tended war gardens, contributing millions of dollars' worth of food to the nation. There was also a canning campaign to save perishable food. Schools played a crucial role in supporting Red Cross work. Both boys and girls knitted for soldiers and made clothes for children in war-torn countries. When a country is at war, prices rise due to high demand and scarcity. The government paid high prices for essential goods, causing wages and prices to soar. Despite challenges, the U.S. made significant progress in 1917, with troops and supplies being efficiently mobilized. The convoy system and improved anti-submarine tactics led to a decrease in submarine attacks on merchant vessels.|"['1.

"In the effort to establish lasting peace, the American people face two sets of challenges. The first set involves international issues, closely tied to European affairs but crucial for the United States. The second set focuses on restoring domestic stability post-war. These problems are intertwined and must be addressed together. The chapter on peace problems will explore national and international issues. 

**Bringing Soldiers Home:** While prioritizing sending troops to Europe, plans are in place for their safe return to the U.S. It's a massive operation that will take months, ensuring each soldier reaches home securely.

**Caring for the Wounded:** Efforts have been made to provide immediate medical care and rehabilitation for wounded soldiers. The nation must support those with lasting injuries, offering education and job opportunities for a dignified life.

**Rebuilding Industries:** Factories producing war supplies need to transition to peacetime production. Machinery must be reconfigured, sales networks established, and new markets explored.

**Labor Reorganization:** Workers have shown great flexibility during the war, and now their skills must be redirected smoothly post-war. Cooperation between employees and employers is vital to avoid widespread unemployment.

**Financial Restructuring:** The financial landscape has shifted significantly during the war, posing challenges for the government, corporations, and individuals. Post-war financial issues will demand strategic solutions."|['1.
