This picture shows the harpsichord Handel played, different from today's grand piano. Despite its simplicity, Handel composed beautiful music on it. At twelve, Handel's father passed, leading him to work hard and excel. He became an organist in Halle and later in Hamburg, known for its music scene. There, he befriended Johann Mattheson. On a trip to Lubeck, Mattheson declined a job offer due to marriage conditions, returning to Hamburg with Handel. After Italy, Handel met the Elector of Hanover, who appointed him Capellmeister. Handel wanted to visit England first, where the Elector became King George I. Handel composed the renowned _Water Music_ for the king's coronation, earning favor.
