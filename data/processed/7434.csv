Davie and Polly were in a pickle. Joel was upset, and Mr. Biggs was leaving in his red cart. The rag-man suggested peppermint for the boys, but Polly declined.

"""I won't spill it, Polly,"" but Polly was already on her tiptoes, and lifting down the old black ink-horn that had been Father Pepper's. ""Isn't it nice that Mrs. Henderson filled it up for us so good?"" she said, carrying it over carefully to set on the table. ""You can get the pen, Davie.""

""Yes, indeed,"" said Polly, drawing up the inkstand into the best place, and sighing. ""Well, dear me, I'd ever so much rather hold her hand while she writes, than to do it myself."" And she gave a long stretch.

""No,"" said Polly, with a little laugh, ""I s'pose I shouldn't, Davie."" O dear me, she thought, I ought not to laugh when Joel's in there all alone in the provision room. ""Well, now we're all ready. I'm just going to peek and see if he's all right. You stay here, Davie.""

Polly ran here and there. ""Joel--_Joel_!"" she cried, peering into every corner, and looking into the potato bag and behind some boxes that the storekeeper had given the boys to make things out of, and that were kept as great treasures.

Joel waited eagerly for the day he could finally venture to the cave alone. Weeks passed by with chores for the neighboring farmers, helping Ben plant potatoes for Deacon Brown, and gathering wood.

As Phronsie drifted off to sleep, Polly noticed and decided to finish her sewing before her mother returned.

Little Davie lay on the floor, crying. Polly comforted him, explaining that Joel was well. Suddenly, Ben rushed in looking disappointed, but Dr. Fisher surprised them all. He joked and laughed, ready to leave after a good meal. As they departed for a ride, Polly realized something was amiss. Despite the day's excitement, Joel still dreamed of having his own circus. The next days were busy with work, and Mrs. Pepper emphasized the importance of repaying Dr. Fisher's kindness. Polly warned Joel about their mother's return, and they settled down to listen to Polly's story. However, they were interrupted by Miss Jerusha, the minister's sister, who scolded them for storytelling instead of working.

Miss Jerusha came to give the children some guidance, believing they lacked proper upbringing. Ben defended their mother, saying she's the best and has raised them well. Despite Joel's accident, Grandma Bascom and Mrs. Pepper took care of him. Mrs. Pepper attended to Joel's wound, a long cut on his hand, caused by a broken window pane. Grandma Bascom, though hard of hearing, noticed Joel's injury and expressed concern. Mrs. Pepper searched for bandages to help Joel.

Joel was left alone, muttering to himself as he stared after Grandma Bascom. He felt relieved that he wouldn't get lockjaw and proudly showed off his wide-open jaws. Satisfied, he returned to his peppermint drops, organizing them meticulously in the drawer. After a moment of contemplation, he decided to take an extra one, carefully choosing between a pink and a white drop. Eventually, he grabbed a pink one, but then worried about Grandma getting sick from too many sweets. Feeling guilty, he returned most of the drops to the drawer, leaving just a few out.

Joel glanced up at the old clock and realized he was late. Feeling dreadful for disobeying his mother, he rushed to the little brown house. The next day, Ben noticed the cloudy weather and predicted a bonfire. Joel, with his hand in a sling, felt frustrated. Polly suggested playing stage-coach to cheer him up. Joel enthusiastically set up the game, pulling chairs and other items for the coach. Little David joined in as a passenger. Joel, playing the driver, faced challenges like not being able to hold his whip.

Joel had an exciting plan for a noisy game with Phronsie and Seraphina, but Polly refused due to the noise. Joel was disappointed, and things got worse when a Henderson boy arrived with butter. Joel suggested the boy could be a passenger, and they could pretend he's a minister going to Boxford. David was promoted to the driver's seat, thrilling him, and Joel handed him the reins. As they started, Joel made a loud crack with the whip. Peletiah hesitated to join, prompting Joel to urge him. Suddenly, a mishap occurred, causing chaos and Polly rushing out in concern.

This afternoon, Polly took care of Joel's injury. She dabbed off the blood and patched up his wound. She made sure to tie it up neatly and then went to help Peletiah with a bruise.

Ben felt a dreadful feeling that Polly blamed him. Mr. Blodgett had instructed Ben not to run home and tell them about the bonfire, but Ben begged to do so.

Polly was startled by the sudden burst of light outside. She swiftly carried Phronsie to the window to see a red glare lighting up the sky. The family quickly gathered, worried about a nearby fire.

Finally, the stage-coach arrived at Strawberry Hill, drawing everyone's attention to the tavern. Passengers disembarked, with Mrs. Beaseley trying to pay only half the fare, met with a stern response from Mr. Tisbett who collected the full amount. As the passengers exited, a thin man quickly left the coach, looking back nervously before joining a waiting wagon with his trunk. A curious boy, impressed by Joel's presence, inquired how he got there. Meanwhile, a little girl, off to her grandmother's for the weekend, carried her belongings with grace. Mr. Tisbett directed Joel and David to follow, but Joel was more interested in the horses getting their meal. Despite Joel's eagerness, Mr. Tisbett insisted they move along, as Joel's mother wouldn't approve of him being left alone.|"[""1.

At dinner time, Joel was reluctant to leave the horses but was whisked away by the stage-driver. Once seated at the cozy dining table with the tavern-keeper's wife serving hot dishes, Joel's hunger grew. Mr. Tisbett, the stage-driver, ordered a hearty meal for the boys from Badgertown, the Pepperses. Joel excitedly mentioned raspberry shortcake, a treat Polly had talked about. After a satisfying meal, Mr. Tisbett let the horses rest while Joel complimented the food and David echoed the sentiment.

Joel and David were peeking into the big barn to catch a glimpse of the two black horses. Joel, excitedly describing the horses' actions, accidentally knocked David over. Angered, Joel challenged David to a fight. Terrified, David pleaded for Joel to come back, but Joel and another boy had already left. Frightened, David rushed to find Mr. Tisbett, but was directed to the tavern where the women were cleaning up. Out of breath and panicked, David explained that something had happened to Joel.

Joel was in a panic, knowing he had to act fast to save Jim from a terrible punishment. Determined, he asked the tavern-keeper's wife where Jim's father lived. With a newfound sense of purpose, Joel ran towards the yellow house indicated. The sound of distress grew louder as they approached, urging them to hurry. As they rounded the house, they came face to face with a frantic woman rushing towards the door. Joel, with little David following close behind, burst into the woodshed where Jim's father stood with a stick in hand. Joel pleaded with him to spare Jim from further punishment, bravely grabbing the stick. The big man, amused by Joel's courage, relented and let Jim off the hook.

Joel joyfully helped Mr. Tisbett with the horses after being scolded for his naughty behavior. Together, they prepared the stage-coach for a passenger to Badgertown. David and Joel were thrilled to be part of the journey. As they set off, Mr. Tisbett surprised Joel by letting him drive the black horses. The day at Strawberry Hill was unforgettable for the Pepper family. They reminisced about the adventure, but Mrs. Pepper warned Polly not to wait for things to happen. Polly hoped for a real chicken pie and scolded the old stove for its problems.

Polly had a great idea for Joey's circus. She suggested he plan and prepare different things in advance and spend his spare time picking cheeses.

Polly and Joel were having fun pretending to be animals in a circus. Joel decided to switch from being a snake to a kangaroo, impressing Polly and David with his energetic leaps. Polly suggested that David should take on another animal role. Polly then pretended to be a bird by singing and twittering. The children wanted to create a band, but they needed a table for Polly to play the music. Joel ran to get a board from Ben. Polly suggested wearing Ben's coat to pretend to be Mr. Tisbett. While fetching the paper rings for the circus, Joel accidentally broke one. Polly reassured him and began fixing it with a smile.|['1.

Polly sat down, contemplating the broken ring. She proposed a solution to Joel, suggesting they paste the torn edges together. Joel protested, fearing it would leave a hole. Polly assured him she could fix it. To stop Joel's tears, Polly threatened not to participate in his circus unless he stopped crying. After gaining his cooperation, Polly used red paper to mend the ring. Joel was thrilled with the result and danced around in excitement.

Joel hurried to the green wagon on the road, filled with Mrs. Beebe's errands. Mrs. Beebe pointed out a paper bag nestled between boxes for him. She winked, promising he would like its contents. As the wagon trundled away, Joel sat on the grass, holding the bag, trying not to cry. He felt deceived as the bag didn't hold animals as promised. His friend David found sugar cookie animals inside, and they happily shared them. David suggested saving some for the circus and sharing with others. The boys collected the scattered cookies and saved the rest, rushing inside to show Mrs. Beebe's thoughtful gift.|[]|[]
After the chaotic preparations, Mrs. Pepper hesitated about hosting another circus in the orchard. But her eyes sparkled, and she comforted Joel, easing his anxiety. Dinner was quickly devoured, dishes washed, and the kitchen tidied. Soon, Joel, his animals, and the musician were in a frenzy in the orchard. Finally, the show began with Mother Pepper and Mrs. Beebe in prime seats. Excitement filled the air as Grandma Bascom, Sally Brown, and the Henderson boys watched. Applause and cheers erupted as the animals performed. Joel, disguised as a monkey, thrilled the audience by jumping through paper rings. Despite a mishap, Joel's daring antics wowed everyone.

Polly's face turned pale with worry as Joel swung dangerously from a tree branch. Despite the chaos and frantic shouting, Ben hesitated, slower than the other Peppers. Mrs. Pepper urged him to climb up after Joel, who taunted him like a mischievous monkey. Suddenly, the knot Joel had tied came loose, and he plummeted to the ground. Panic ensued as everyone rushed to help him. Polly, taking charge, dashed off to find Dr. Fisher, the family doctor. Along the way, Mr. Tisbett, a kind stage-driver, offered to take her to the doctor. Reassured by his experience with falls, Polly accepted his help.

Mr. Tisbett, a skilled bone-setter, didn't believe in diplomas to prove his expertise. He set bones without hesitation, commanding respect from everyone. His gentle touch amazed Polly and Mrs. Pepper as he tended to Joel's injuries. Mr. Tisbett shared stories of his horse, Black Bill, and offered Joel a ride on his stagecoach. He advised Joel not to seek horses identical to each other. Joel, content with Mr. Tisbett's wisdom, decided to have a horse like Jerry. Despite Joel's desire to play, Mr. Tisbett sternly warned him not to climb trees again. Joel promised to behave, earning cuddles from Mamsie. Mrs. Beebe marveled at Joel's safety, calling it a miracle. She encouraged Joel to play with his toy animals, relieved to see him unharmed.|"['1.

Polly was thrilled to find a way to help Joel after the performance. She handed out the sugar cooky animals she had prepared. When she noticed Mrs. Beebe didn't have one, she suggested giving her a bird, which Mrs. Beebe happily accepted. Joel then gave Mr. Tisbett a horse-shaped cookie. Although Mr. Tisbett found it too cute to eat, he kept it as a memento. As the evening progressed, everyone picked their favorite cookie animal. Joel even gave Phronsie the pig cookie she adored.

Joel was feeling quite confident as he strutted around, eager to prove that he could make a fire just as well as Polly. Igniting the paper with a match, he forgot to cover the stove and dashed off to get more kindling wood. Panicked when he realized his mistake, Joel hurried back to cover the stove, successfully containing the flames. Feeling proud of his accomplishment, he confidently declared that he would now tend to the fire every day. With David still shaken from the scare, Joel proceeded to add more wood to the stove, adjust the dampers, and clean his hands. Convinced that making a fire was easy, Joel planned to surprise Polly with his newfound skill. The boys then headed outside to play by their homemade pond, sailing paper boats.

Polly was startled when she saw David in a panic about black creatures crawling on him. She hopped off the bed, and a black object scuttled away. David was crying, and Polly was shaking with fear.

Joel, eager to be at the shop every day, swiftly climbed up and handed the shoe box to Mr. Beebe. Despite the woman's dissatisfaction, Mr. Beebe tried his best to assist her, yet she seemed to finally find the right shoe for her son, Johnny. As soon as the woman and Johnny left, Mr. Beebe packed the shoes back into the boxes. Meanwhile, Joel was torn between staying in the shop with the shoes or joining Mrs. Beebe for treats.

Joel excitedly entered the house, forgetting the bag of treats he had bought. He swung the bag over Polly's head, causing the doughnuts and sticks to scatter across the kitchen floor. Joel, eager to eat them, found one more stick behind a chair. As he untwisted the bag, he peered inside with delight. Davie guessed it was doughnuts because of the smell from Mrs. Beebe's. Joel accidentally spilled the treats on the bed-quilt. Meanwhile, in the woodshed, Joel and Polly marveled at the sled Ben had made. Phronsie joined in the excitement, eager to ride on it.

"""Polly, please shut the door,"" exclaimed Polly to Joel as Phronsie might catch a cold. Joel was already outside, excited about the snowstorm and making a snowman soon.

"""Why didn't you come back for us?"" David asked suddenly. He hadn't eaten since Joel's exciting story and felt distressed between Polly's disappointment and his own. ""Oh, look at the snow!"" Joel screamed, flying out of his chair. The snow had fallen thickly while they were engrossed. Joel and David set off with their sled, waving goodbye to the onlookers. They decided to go to Simon's Hill, a steep thoroughfare two miles away. As they coasted down, Joel steered, and David clung on behind, a bit scared but hiding it.

Miss Parrott's man, who worked for the lady who owned the sleigh, was so amazed by Polly's transformation that he rubbed his eyes and stared after her. He couldn't believe it was the same girl he saw dancing down the road earlier. Joel, feeling guilty for something Miss Jerusha accused him of, ran to Mother Pepper, asking if he had lied.
