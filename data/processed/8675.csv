Some believe this should be written as Bedd Gelert or Gilert, indicating Gelert's or Gilert's Grave. It is accompanied by a traditional story that may not be worth mentioning. The essence of the tale is that Prince Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, in a fit of anger, killed his beloved greyhound named Gelert or Gilert at this location. Regretting his actions, he had a tomb built over the dog's grave, where the parish church was later constructed. It is likely a myth considering the impropriety of building a church over a dog's grave and the timeline of church construction in Wales. The Gelert or Gilert mentioned was probably an old monk or saint, possibly the founder or dedicatee of the church. The area was a priory before the Reformation. Lewis Dwnn, a fifteenth-century bard, praised the Prior of Bethgelert for his generosity and knowledge in a poem. This suggests the monk was wealthy and esteemed in his era.|"[""1.
