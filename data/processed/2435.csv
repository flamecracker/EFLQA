The shepherd, scared but compassionate, saved the snake. The serpent led him to the king's palace, where he was offered riches, but he asked for the ability to understand the language of animals. The king granted his wish after a peculiar ritual. On his way back, the shepherd overheard two ravens discussing a hidden treasure. He shared this with his master, who gave him the treasure. The shepherd became wealthy and lived happily. Later, he discovered that his old dog had protected him from harm.

Once upon a time, in a kingdom far away, there lived a princess who was very particular about finding a husband. She rejected all the young princes who sought her hand. One day, feeling lonely, she sneaked away to the servants' quarters. There, she met a handsome youth who turned out to be a boy she had played with as a child.

However, just as the execution was about to take place, the king of the Magyars intervened and saved the boy's life.

The king received a troubling message from the Sultan, who demanded to know which of three canes grew near the root, middle, or top, or else war would ensue. The princess advised soaking the canes in warm water, where one sank to the bottom, indicating the root, another stayed afloat, representing the top, and the third remained in the middle. The king followed her advice, avoiding war. The next year, a similar challenge arose with three foals, threatening war if the king couldn't identify their birth times. The princess suggested feeding them different grains to reveal their birth times. The king's troubles continued when the Sultan demanded the youth who solved the puzzles.

After a long search, two brothers were found who looked so alike that not even their own mother could tell them apart. One of the brothers painted a mask that was an exact copy of their faces. When he wore it, no one could distinguish between the two. They went to the Sultan's palace and were brought before him. The Sultan couldn't tell the difference between them. A witch plotted to kill one of them by cutting his sleeve. She sneaked in at night and cut a sleeve, but all three brothers marked their sleeves the same way. The Sultan, tired of the confusion, sent them home. Later, the Sultan ordered the youth to be sent to Turkey alone. The boy's lover cried, but he assured her all would be well. He set off at sunrise and reached the Sultan's palace. With a magical sword, he defeated the Sultan's army. The princess led troops to rescue him, and they celebrated his victory.

Once upon a time, a prince roamed from place to place seeking work as a shepherd. After arriving in a city near a lake where a dragon dwelled, he sought employment from the townsfolk but was unsuccessful. Advised to approach the emperor, the prince was warned about the dangers of the meadows near the lake where the dragon resided. Undeterred, he led his flock to pasture, and upon seeing the meadows, the sheep dashed towards them. The prince, equipped with greyhounds, a hawk, and pipes, bravely challenged the dragon. After a fierce battle, the dragon offered to hurl him high if the emperor's daughter kissed him. The prince cleverly mentioned this, causing the dragon to lose grip and fall back into the lake.

Peter embarked on a perilous journey through dense forests, vast rivers, and slippery mountains, guided by the advice of three old women. Each woman bestowed upon him a cake and a napkin for his travels. Following their instructions, he rode through seven times seven countries until he encountered a blazing fire. By striking the flames with the napkins, a passage opened, and three cakes he threw behind him transformed into loyal dogs. Peter's path led him to a peaceful abode where he met a gray-haired woman and a beautiful girl. The girl, curious about his adventures, surreptitiously tested the power of the napkins, unwittingly unleashing Eisenkopf, a menacing figure. The girl narrowly escaped his clutches, but Peter, unaware of the danger lurking, found her in a fainting state. Upon her recovery, she concealed the encounter with Eisenkopf, leaving Peter oblivious to the lurking threat.|['1.

Sigurd and Helga spent the day playing games and having fun. The next morning, Helga's father left for town, giving them the opportunity to explore the house. In one room, they found a heavy iron door with a key that hadn't been used. Sigurd was curious and asked to see what was inside. Helga hesitated but eventually opened the door slightly. Inside, they found a splendid horse ready to ride and a beautiful sword engraved with a special message. Sigurd was amazed and asked to ride the horse just once and carry the sword. Helga warned him about the stick, stone, and twig that must also be taken if he took the sword. Sigurd rode the horse around the house but instead of stopping, he galloped away. Helga warned him about the consequences, but Sigurd did not listen.
