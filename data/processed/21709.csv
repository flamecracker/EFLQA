The Native Americans and Eskimos rarely crossed paths during their trips due to the potential for conflict. The vast land and abundant game provided enough resources for both, reducing the need for interaction. However, occasional encounters led to bitter disputes, with the Eskimos wary of the Indians armed with firearms from fur-traders. Despite their headstrong courage, the Eskimos avoided confrontations. One spring morning, a young Eskimo named Cheenbuk chased a white whale but failed to catch it. Undeterred, he decided to land on the riverbank. Cheenbuk, a calm and strong individual, showed little emotion whether facing success or disappointment. He was a handsome Eskimo, dressed in seal-skin attire, displaying great strength and agility from battling Arctic elements and wildlife. While preparing to eat his meal, Cheenbuk heard a distant sound, prompting him to grab his spear and hide behind a bush. Just as he was about to call out to wild geese, a loud gunshot, signaling the presence of an Indian, startled him, causing him to cautiously approach the source of the noise.|"['1.

Cheenbuk cautiously approached an Indian who was leisurely eating a goose. The Eskimo hesitated to attack, showing mercy. However, he was discovered by the Indian, leading to a struggle for the gun. Despite the intense fight, they surprisingly lacked hatred towards each other. Eventually, Cheenbuk stepped back, and the Indian extended a hand in peace. They cooked the goose together, silently appreciating each other's company. The Eskimo was open-minded and humorous, while the Indian was conservative and serious.

Cheenbuk appeared ready to talk but was stopped by his companion's unusual actions. The companion took out a decorated bag and a whitish tool with a bowl. He filled it with brown substance, put it in his mouth, and lit it with a burning stick. The Eskimo watched in surprise as the companion blew smoke from his mouth. Intrigued, the Eskimo tried it cautiously and succeeded. The Indian approved, and the Eskimo learned about a custom of the red men. They discussed the importance of being a good provider over fighting. The Eskimo encouraged Cheenbuk to keep trying to promote peace.

Alas, the hopes of good men were in jeopardy. While Cheenbuk and the Indian denounced war, a young Eskimo from the same tribe was stirring up trouble. This Eskimo, a strong but reckless swashbuckler, showed a tendency towards violence. The Eskimo village, Walrus Creek, was dirty with remnants of blubber and bones scattered about. The men were out hunting, leaving only women and children. In the village, an old man pondered deeply, clearly troubled. Mangivik and his wife wore similar seal-skin coats and boots, with slight variations. The wife expressed concern about the young troublemaker, comparing him to restless birds. The husband shared his worry, mentioning the young man's desire to instigate fights and marry Nootka.|['Question 1:\nWhat was the main concern of the Indian and Cheenbuk in the text passage?\nA) The cleanliness of Walrus Creek\nB) The behavior of the young Eskimo\nC) The hunting skills of the men in the village\nD) The seal-skin coats and boots worn by Mangivik and his wife\nE) The desire of the young man to marry Nootka', 'Question 2:\nWhat was the occupation of the men in the Eskimo village at the time described in the text?\nA) Fishing\nB) Hunting\nC) Farming\nD) Cooking\nE) Building', 'Question 3:\nWhat was the old man doing in the village according to the text?\nA) Hunting\nB) Pondering deeply\nC) Stirring up trouble\nD) Expressing concern\nE) Wearing seal-skin coats and boots', 'Question 4:\nHow did Mangivik and his wife express their worry in the text?\nA) By hunting together\nB) By wearing similar clothing\nC) By instigating fights\nD) By comparing the young troublemaker to birds\nE) By cleaning Walrus Creek', 'Question 5:\nWho did the young troublemaker in the text want to marry?\nA) Cheenbuk\nB) The Indian\nC) Nootka\nD) Mangivik\nE) The old man in the village', 'Question 6:\nWhat was the mood of the old man in the text?\nA) Happy\nB) Excited\nC) Troubled\nD) Relaxed\nE) Angry']|['B) The behavior of the young Eskimo', 'B) Hunting', 'B) Pondering deeply', 'D) By comparing the young troublemaker to birds', 'C) Nootka', 'C) Troubled']
Mrs. Mangivik expressed her strong disapproval of the walrus, hoping he would not return from fighting the Fire-spouters. A young girl, smeared with grease, joined the old man and Mrs. Mangivik. The girl, named Nootka, shared a moment with Oolalik, a handsome young man. Despite their affection, they communicated subtly due to their Eskimo customs. Oolalik's admiration for Nootka was evident as he stared at her, forgetting his food momentarily. The group discussed Gartok's plans for a confrontation with the Fire-spouters. Suddenly, a boy named Anteek arrived, making a ruckus with various animal sounds. He paused at the hut's door, surprised by Oolalik's presence.

In the icy wilderness, a brave young hunter ventured alone among the rugged cliffs in search of eggs. Armed with a spear crafted by Cheenbuk, the hunter encountered a mighty walrus. Startled by the enormous creature, he crept closer, readying himself for a surprise attack. With courage in his heart, he lunged at the walrus, but a misstep caused him to stumble. Despite the walrus's fierce resistance, the hunter managed to strike the beast, ultimately felling it after a perilous struggle that led them both tumbling down a steep incline.

"""We want the pretty colored things and iron tools from the Fire-spouters,"" Gartok insisted. ""We need the spouters for war. We can't get them without fighting,"" he added. Mangivik disagreed, suggesting they don't need what they never had. Gartok recounted an encounter with a Fire-spouter who showed him how to make it spout. But Mangivik argued they are useless without black sand from white traders. Oolalik warned against fighting, recalling a past raid where many were injured or killed by the spouters. He urged that fighting is foolish. The aftermath of the raid left some men injured and others carried back. Oolalik emphasized the futility of fighting unnecessarily."""|['1.

Oolalik paused and pointed to two men beside him as an example. Despite being young, they appeared old due to injuries from a previous fight. One man's leg was shot, making him a cripple, while the other suffered a lung wound, weakening his once strong constitution. Oolalik highlighted the tragic consequences of unnecessary battles by sharing the sorrow of the wives and sisters left behind by fallen warriors.

In the Eskimo village, tensions were high as Gartok stoked the flames of war after a clash with Oolalik. A group of young men, fueled by the desire for revenge, embarked on a journey to Whale River with women in tow. Meanwhile, the Dogrib Indians, known as Fire-spouters, were also contemplating an attack on the Eskimos who dared to visit Greygoose River. The Dogrib chief called for a council of war, where braves gathered solemnly, draped in blankets, ready to deliberate. As the discussion unfolded, a seasoned warrior, Nazinred, proposed a different path. He advocated for peace, highlighting the benefits of trade with the Eskimos for resources like walrus teeth and seal skins. His wise words resonated, offering a new perspective on the conflict.|['1.

"The Indian paused to gauge the response to his words, hearing only faint ""ho's!"" from the councillors. They seemed uncertain. His ideas on peace and war were unwelcome, and his trade suggestions were new. It was clear that Nazinred was ahead of his time. He recounted a struggle with a young Eskimo, where they both showed strength but chose peace over conflict. This encounter opened his eyes to the Eskimo's wisdom and depth of thought. Magadar, a fiery young councillor, challenged Nazinred's views, questioning the Eskimos' intentions and urging caution. He advised against trusting them and proposed using force instead. The debate highlighted differing perspectives on peace, war, and trust between the Dogribs and the Eskimos."|"['1.

The speech was well received, indicating the war-party's influence. Magadar's advice would have led to war if not for successful hunters returning with much-needed food after a season of scarcity. The arrival of geese, ducks, and plover led to feasting, diverting thoughts from war. Nazinred and comrades planned a hunting trip, aiming to visit fur-traders at Great Bear Lake. The women stayed at a river mouth camp while the men hunted. The vibrant Arctic spring signaled the end of winter. Adolay, a beautiful young woman, and her mother Isquay discussed the kindness of an Eskimo man they met previously. Adolay admired his bravery and strength, wishing he were Indian.

Adolay remained silent and unfazed by the suggestion, as Indian women are accustomed to real shocks rather than those of the imagination. She regretted her father's absence, believing he could have calmed the young warriors' war-fever. As they spoke, the young men decided to embark on a warpath against the Eskimo who had clashed with their chief. Around twenty to thirty armed men swiftly left the village, heading towards their canoes at a nearby creek. Meanwhile, the Eskimo women, including the gentle Rinka and the agreeable Cowlik, set up a tent and prepared seal-steaks over a cooking-lamp. The men, led by Gartok and scout Raventik, cautiously navigated the Greygoose River in kayaks, planning an attack on the Eskimos. Raventik, although initially challenged by the river's swollen waters, adapted quickly, using his intelligence and learned river-navigation skills to progress stealthily towards their target.|"['1.

The Eskimo scout, Raventik, found himself in a perilous situation as he encountered a group of armed Indians in birch-bark canoes while on a reconnaissance mission. The Indians, led by Magadar, were equipped with firearms and tomahawks, ready to drive the Eskimos from their lands. However, a mishap with one of the Indian braves accidentally firing his gun alerted Raventik to their presence. Despite the Indians' attempts to hide and ambush him, Raventik's superior kayak and skillful paddling allowed him to outmaneuver them and escape down the river. The Indians, realizing they were outnumbered and outgunned, resorted to firing a volley as the Eskimos retreated, resulting in two of their own being wounded.

At this point, the Eskimos sought refuge by the land's formation, where the Greygoose River curved like a horseshoe. The Indians, familiar with the area, decided to disembark and swiftly cross a narrow strip of land to intercept the kayaks before they reached the sea. As the Eskimos paddled ahead, confident in their speed, they anticipated reaching the open sea soon. Meanwhile, the Eskimo women, alarmed by the gunfire, had embarked on their boat to await the return of their men. Rinka, sent to gather firewood, got lost in the woods. As she tried to find her way back, a young Indian mistook her for an enemy and fired at her. Cheenbuk, nearby, rushed to the scene to find Rinka injured, her life in danger.|['1.

The loud cry of anger and fear from Cheenbuk stopped the attacker in his tracks, causing him to defend himself. The savage had rushed to complete his violent act without reloading his gun, leaving him almost defenseless. As he hurried to reload, Cheenbuk swiftly threw his spear, striking the attacker in the chest. The man fell without much noise. Cheenbuk, torn between pity for the victim and anger towards the cruel Indian, was also troubled by the thought that the desire for self-glorification through killing had likely fueled the violence. Old Uleeta and her companions arrived, and after attending to the wounded girl, they all quickly boarded the boat to escape a gun threat. Cheenbuk, realizing the danger, acted swiftly to protect the group from further harm.|"[""1.

Cheenbuk, lost in thought, was roused by an Indian after a burial ceremony. Following Magadar, he left his Eskimo home, the northern sea, as a captive. On the shore, the Indians failed to catch the fleeing men in kayaks. Gartok, wounded, fell behind, tending to his injury. Ondikik, his lieutenant, fainted in a kayak, saved by his comrades. The group embarked on a women's boat, with Gartok and Ondikik in distress. They camped on islets, finding comfort under the starry sky with food and oil lamps. Gartok and Ondikik, reflecting on the day's events, accepted their fates without much complaint. Gartok expressed relief at not being captured, acknowledging the challenges Cheenbuk faced in a forced war.|"['1.

Ondikik, feeling feverish and rusty from his wound, wished the Fire-spouters were deep inside a whale's belly. He feared the small spouter things that caused ugly holes when they disappeared inside. Raventik, surprised by Ondikik's pain, tried to help but was discouraged by the invalids' responses. Old Uleeta, a more knowledgeable nurse, dressed wounds with water and rabbit-skins. The tribe had supper while Ondikik, Rinka, and the captive Eskimo dealt with their injuries and fate. The Eskimo, once defiant, calmed down and resigned to his situation, realizing revenge was futile. Adolay recognized the Eskimo as her rescuer, but the tribe debated the Eskimo's fate. Adolay faced a dilemma but decided against freeing the Eskimo, fearing the consequences. The tribe planned to leave the Eskimo bound until morning, allowing time for reflection and ensuring a fair judgment in daylight.|"[""1.

After a lengthy discussion, it was decided that Cheenbuk's execution would be delayed until the next day. A guard was assigned to watch over him through the night to prevent any attempts at escape. Meanwhile, Adolay, skeptical of her mother's defense of Cheenbuk, took matters into her own hands. She approached Cheenbuk, shielding her face with a blanket, and warned the boys tormenting him to stay away. She whispered to Cheenbuk, revealing her plan to save him that night. As darkness fell, a young brave armed with a gun checked Cheenbuk's restraints and patrolled the area. Cheenbuk, recognizing Adolay, remained calm. The night grew darker, and Cheenbuk pondered his fate, unsure if Adolay's plan would succeed in the pitch-black night. The guard, ensuring Cheenbuk was secure, remained vigilant, unaware of the impending rescue plan.|"[""1.

Nevertheless, Adolay was hiding in the bush near the tree, observing Cheenbuk's every move. When the guard turned away, she swiftly cut Cheenbuk's bonds and handed him a knife. Cheenbuk, with nerves of steel, waited until the guard was close before freeing himself. He then sprang into action, overpowering the guard and escaping towards the cliff. Adolay planned to guide Cheenbuk across the lake and into the Greygoose River. However, her plans were disrupted when she encountered the jealous Idazoo. Adolay, trying to avoid suspicion, hurried away towards the cliff, with Idazoo following closely behind, determined to uncover the mysterious events of the night.|"['1.

The Eskimo acted swiftly and cleverly. Without hesitation, he approached the girls, seized Idazoo, and awaited instructions from Adolay. Idazoo, realizing she was being captured, attempted to scream, but Cheenbuk quickly covered her mouth to silence her. He then gagged her with a colorful cloth and tied her to a tree. Adolay expressed regret for the situation, explaining that Idazoo's actions had consequences. They then proceeded to a lake where a canoe was waiting. Cheenbuk expressed concern about his weight in the canoe, but Adolay had already balanced it with a stone. They paddled across the lake in silence until they reached a river. Adolay directed Cheenbuk on how to navigate the river ahead, and they eventually parted ways at a clearing. Adolay instructed Cheenbuk on how to navigate the river further, guiding him to listen for the sounds of waterfalls and how to bypass them easily.|"['1.

Cheenbuk and Adolay had a conversation near a salt lake. Cheenbuk mentioned the dangers of ice lumps in the water, while Adolay assured him she could walk around the lake. Concerned for her safety, Cheenbuk offered to take her to his home to protect her from potential harm. Despite briefly considering forcing her to go with him, he quickly dismissed the idea, showing his chivalrous nature. Adolay worried about being killed if she returned home, but Cheenbuk promised to keep her safe with his family until they could visit her people together. He assured her that no harm would come to her, even in the face of potential conflict. Adolay hesitated but eventually agreed to go with Cheenbuk to ensure her safety.|"['1.

Adolay gazed earnestly at the serious expression on the young man's face. She sensed his sincerity but hesitated, knowing the boldness of the step she was about to take, even for an Indian heroine. Suddenly, a distant sound caught their attention, making them both start and look around anxiously. It was faint at first, but as it repeated louder, recognition dawned on Adolay. The Spirit of God, she realized, could be found in people of all ranks and backgrounds. Cheenbuk, influenced by a good spirit, suggested a plan to hide the canoe and return to Adolay's village on foot. Adolay, fearful of her people's anger, agreed. They set off down the river, paddling at top speed to avoid capture, eventually stopping to rest at dawn. Fatigued, they ate dried venison in silence, their minds drifting in the peaceful morning light.|"[""1.

After a simple meal and a drink of water, Adolay and Cheenbuk settled down for the night. They quickly fell asleep under the stars. However, Cheenbuk, being an experienced hunter, woke up after a short while and roused Adolay. They gathered their things and headed back to the lake in their canoe. Meanwhile, at the village, Alizay, who had been knocked out by Cheenbuk earlier, regained consciousness and set out to find them. The village was thrown into chaos when it was discovered that both Idazoo and Adolay were missing. The situation became even more urgent when a sound was heard in the distance, prompting the villagers to take action. Following the trail, they set out in pursuit, determined to catch up with the runaways. As the pursuit continued through the night, the chase led them closer together, unbeknownst to both parties.|"['1.

Adolay was fortunate to have Cheenbuk as her protector, who woke her up early before the Indians resumed the chase. Cheenbuk quickly regained his strength to paddle with vigor. The discovery of their love and Adolay's decision to run away with him added to their determination. When they reached the mouth of the river, they faced a sea blocked by ice, causing Adolay sudden alarm. Cheenbuk reassured her, pointing out leads in the ice. Meanwhile, Magadar and his comrades, upon reaching the sea, were enraged to find the fugitives' canoe among the ice-floes. As they pursued, the ice started closing in, posing dangers. After a long day's journey, they decided to camp on an islet for the night. Adolay collected driftwood while Cheenbuk set up the camp, preparing for a warm supper.|"['1.

The girl silently approached the canoe and unwrapped a deerskin bundle. From it, she retrieved a fire-bag adorned with beads, similar to those carried by Indian chiefs. The bag held a pipe, tinder-box, flint, steel, and tobacco, usually provided to Red men by fur-traders. Adolay, without speaking, demonstrated lighting a fire using flint, steel, and tinder, fascinating the Eskimo. The spark ignited the tinder, producing smoke. She then spun it in dry grass until it burst into flames. The flame illuminated the surroundings, impressing Cheenbuk. They cooked venison over the fire and shared birch-bark cups of water. Adolay mentioned that women prefer water over fire-water, which makes men aggressive. Cheenbuk found it odd that people enjoy substances that make them sick. Adolay had no more surprises in her bundle, leaving Cheenbuk intrigued.|"['1.

Cheenbuk listened intently as Adolay spoke about the sweet stuff called shoogir that Indian girls like. They make it from the juice of a tree. Cheenbuk was fascinated by the new information and struggled with the language barrier. Adolay then showed him a scalping knife, and Cheenbuk was in awe of the gifts. He was so grateful that he started working with the hatchet and scalping knife, creating wood shavings with great enthusiasm. As the night progressed, Cheenbuk continued whittling sticks, his face glowing with satisfaction. The scene around them was serene, with the moonlight illuminating the icy landscape. Cheenbuk eventually sat by the fire, lost in contemplation, before retiring to rest. The calm night was interrupted by Anteek's yell, signaling the arrival of visitors in kayaks. The villagers gathered excitedly at the shore, anticipating the newcomers, including their skilled hunter. Anteek's joy at the prospect of danger or fun was evident, contrasting with Gartok's injury and Ondikik's weakened state. The villagers cheered as the familiar voice of their hunter echoed over the water, bringing relief and excitement to Nootka, her mother, and Anteek.|"[""1.

The entire population's eyes were fixed in the same direction, as Eskimos don't mind staring. The girl felt a bit embarrassed and hid behind her protector. The youth clarified that she was not his wife and asked his father to take care of her. Cheenbuk then headed to the large hut where the community gathered to hear about his adventures. He explained that he explored the Whale River to find better hunting grounds for their growing tribe. Cheenbuk suggested moving to a land with more resources, like the Fire-spouters, to improve their lives. This idea challenged traditional Eskimo beliefs, causing a stir among the listeners.

Cheenbuk, a brave Eskimo, shared his daring adventures with the tribe. He recounted his encounter with the Indian, the pipe he discovered, and his rescue of Rinka, a girl from the Fire-spouter tribe. Cheenbuk revealed his plan to lead a peaceful group to return Rinka to her family. However, Aglootook, the tribe's medicine-man, was skeptical. He feared the Fire-spouters' retaliation and questioned Cheenbuk's intentions. Aglootook argued against changing their traditional ways, emphasizing their contentment with their current lifestyle. He dismissed Cheenbuk's proposal, doubting its success and warning of potential dangers.

Cheenbuk, in a composed tone, questioned the necessity of seeking out distant prey like bears, walruses, and seals for hunting. He pondered why these animals didn't simply walk up to the igloos to be consumed if they were meant for humans. Cheenbuk argued that man was designed to have desires and the ability to fulfill them, progressing from good to better. He referenced Aglootook's hunting habits as proof of this concept. Cheenbuk dismissed the idea of making life easier by hunting small birds near their dwellings, highlighting the preference for fat seal and walrus meat. The mention of the Fire-spouters' folly led to Cheenbuk showcasing a clay pipe and tobacco from his fire-bag, captivating the audience with his attempts to light and smoke the pipe.

A few days after Cheenbuk arrived, the village leaders organized a hunt for seals and wild-fowl due to scarce provisions. Anteek, always eager for adventure, joined Cheenbuk and Oolalik in kayaks, with an oomiak to carry the game. Uleeta, Cowlik, and two other girls manned the oomiak. Adolay chose her own bark canoe over the oomiak, showing pride in her Indian craft. Nootka, skilled in canoeing, took the bow paddle. As Adolay and Nootka prepared their canoe, Anteek paddled over in his kayak. Anteek offered to join them, and Adolay agreed. They set off, but Adolay's unfamiliarity with the kayak led to a mishap.

"Mozwa, a North American Indian, was almost perfect except for one flaw - he was a gambler. Despite being a savage, he indulged in a game known as ""odd-or-even,"" where possessions were at stake. Mozwa, not reasoning like a cultured person, was consumed by covetousness. His wife, aware of his tendencies, safeguarded their possessions. However, some items like weapons and daily essentials were frequently lost and won back in gambling.

In the wilds of North America, ruin is not as severe as in civilized lands. The absence of strong drink prevents complete moral and physical destruction caused by gambling. Despite the deterioration of character, social redemption is possible due to property nature and easier recovery prospects. Upon Mozwa's return, missing his new blanket and coat, his old possessions awaited him. Though he faced alternating excitement and depression from gambling losses, he managed to win back some possessions. Nazinred, a plain-spoken friend, warned Mozwa about the futility of his gains, leading to self-reflection and realization. The frozen lakes and rivers signified the onset of winter, prompting Nazinred to plan a journey to find his missing daughter, believing Eskimos had taken her to nearby islands.

Despite the cold, he attempted to build a snow hut in the Eskimo style, aiming for a dome-shaped structure. Although his first few attempts collapsed, he persisted and finally created a passable shelter. The hut, about six feet in diameter and four feet high, had a small doorway. Nazinred, determined to find Adolay, rested in the dark hut, satisfied with his creation.|['1.

While constructing his hut, Nazinred noticed his four dogs sitting idly, watching him with curiosity. Wanting to keep them occupied, he served them supper from his sledge. After eating, the dogs resumed their idle watching, albeit more lazily. Nazinred then sat outside the hut, feeding the dogs to keep their interest. Once the meal was over, the dogs settled near the hut to sleep. Getting the sledge inside proved challenging due to its size, but Nazinred managed. He then prepared his sleeping area, ensuring he had water for the morning to avoid eating snow. Nazinred debated letting the dogs inside for warmth but decided against it, taking only one in. After sealing the hut, he settled in for the night, with the loyal dog by his side. They awoke to find the outside dogs eager to join. Despite the darkness, they resumed their journey, relying on starlight. Breakfast was not a concern for Nazinred, who focused on supper for sustenance. As they continued their journey, Nazinred remained determined, despite the challenges ahead.|"['1.

Adolay, a young girl from the tribe, knew her father's love and expected him to come looking for her. She left a message on a post when the tribe left for winter, guiding him with a figurative drawing. Her father, Nazinred, easily decoded the message, which directed him to follow the trail to find Adolay. Setting out on his journey, Nazinred followed the Eskimos' tracks through the frozen sea, aided by clear weather. However, on the fourth day, a fierce storm hit, forcing him to seek shelter and rest with his dogs. When he woke, he discovered two polar bears had ransacked his supplies.

Nazinred encountered a fierce battle with two bears while on a mission. The dogs, valiant yet inexperienced, faced the bears head-on resulting in tragedy. Nazinred, undeterred, swiftly took aim and shot one of the bears, causing the other to flee. Despite losing three dogs and facing significant losses, including a broken sledge and provisions, Nazinred's determination to find his lost child remained unwavering. He decided to carry the provisions on his back and continue the search. His loyal dog, Attim, survived and provided comfort in this dire situation.

The Native American prepared for his journey by shouldering his gun, slinging his snow-shoes, carrying a bow and arrows, and the fire-bag made by Adolay. Initially guided by the stars, he encountered a snowstorm with a fierce wind. As the blizzard worsened, he and his dog Attim sought shelter near an ice-pinnacle. Suddenly, a massive ice mass collapsed, burying them in darkness. Despite the dire situation, the man found solace in trusting a higher power. With no escape, he decided to hack his way out. In the pitch-black chamber, he realized the challenge ahead. Determined, he fed Attim and braced himself for the daunting task of cutting through tons of ice to freedom.|['1.

The man began to work diligently, facing challenges as he chipped away at the ice, sometimes hitting unexpected obstacles or missing entirely. His loyal dog, Attim, stayed close by, risking danger. Gradually, he learned to anticipate the ice walls' positions, creating a familiar tunnel. Despite hours of labor, he found no escape. Exhausted, he settled in for the night, sharing a meal with Attim. In the dim light, he glimpsed their icy prison. The next day, with renewed determination, he finally broke through to the outside world. Though weakened, he pressed on, aided by snowshoes. Discovering Eskimo huts, he sought shelter, finding them deserted. Despite setbacks, hope sustained him as he faced the challenges of the Arctic wilderness. Meanwhile, Cheenbuk and her Eskimo companions enjoyed a peaceful day in their snow dwellings.|"[""1.

Cheenbuk, a kind and brave youth, comforted Adolay, a girl who longed for her parents. He promised to take her home once the ice melted. As they prepared for a walrus hunt, Oolalik suggested having women along, teasing Nootka. The Eskimo town bustled with activity as men readied sledges and dogs for the hunt, while children played atop snow bee-hives. Cheenbuk's team encountered a walrus at a breathing-hole, successfully hunting it. Further on, they found strange tracks, possibly from Fire-spouters and a dog. Despite the excitement, they found deserted huts where a stranger had sought refuge, indicating he was in dire need.|"['1.

Anteek was the first to spot something moving on the ice. He alerted his silent companion, who cracked his whip to urge the dogs forward. As they drew closer, they heard a sorrowful howl. Soon, they found a man lying motionless on the ice, his dog weak and exhausted. The man, Nazinred, was on the brink of death due to exposure and fatigue. The Eskimos worked tirelessly to revive him, wrapping him in a bearskin and securing him on the sled. Despite the initial struggle to rouse him, Nazinred was eventually brought back to consciousness. Anteek was then instructed to rush back for help and supplies. The Eskimos recognized Nazinred but disguised themselves to avoid detection. As Nazinred regained his senses in the warmth of the hut, the Eskimo played along, offering him food without revealing their true identities.|"['1.

Nazinred wasted no time and started eating right away, always ready for more food. Cheenbuk, through hard work, managed to keep him fed. After Nazinred finished, he drank warm water and then smoked his pipe. Cheenbuk anticipated this and smiled to himself, even though his face remained serious. Nazinred explained that faces are memorable and don't change, even when dirtied. He shared a story of a man-of-the-woods whose daughter ran away with an Eskimo. The father, torn between love and duty, decided not to seek revenge but to search for his daughter alone.

Nazinred paused, making Cheenbuk uneasy. He knew the Indian couldn't connect him to the Eskimo who had escaped with Adolay, but he worried the clever man might figure it out. The Indian sought help to find his daughter, Adolay, whom they named after sunny days. Cheenbuk struggled with the truth about Adolay's escape with him. The Indian, usually reserved, showed excitement. He hinted at a suitor's interest in Adolay. The Indian's quiet demeanor changed when he spoke of the young man, Cheenbuk. The Indian's respect for him grew. Anteek arrived with a sledge, and Cheenbuk planned to take his father to Adolay.

Oolalik, the robust Eskimo, and Raventik, known for his bold nature, were key players in the kick-ball game. Aglootook, the magician, also joined in, showing that even dignitaries could enjoy recreational activities. Gartok, a spectator due to an unhealed wound, watched alongside Ondikik, who suffered from a draining bullet wound. The game involved the entire male population, with women on the sidelines sending back the ball. Old Mangivik and Mrs. M cheered enthusiastically, while Nootka watched closely, possibly drawn by Oolalik's presence. Adolay was absent, possibly due to Cheenbuk's absence. The game continued until a small boy in oversized boots caused a commotion between Oolalik and Raventik, leading to a playful chase that ended in a humorous tumble.

Cheenbuk had instructed Anteek to keep quiet about finding the Indian, and the boy followed his instructions faithfully. The sudden appearance of the Fire-spouter surprised and excited the village. The dogs reacted aggressively towards Attim, but Anteek's quick action dispersed them. Cheenbuk then recounted the discovery of the Indian, embellishing the story for dramatic effect. Suddenly, Attim sensed something from Mangivik's igloo and rushed inside, causing a commotion. Adolay emerged, shocked but overjoyed to see her father. The emotional reunion left the onlookers in awe. Cheenbuk intervened to explain the situation, revealing the Fire-spouter as Adolay's father and urging the tribe to welcome him.

The Indian hesitated for a moment, looking displeased, but then drew his daughter closer. He battled with his own biases and pride, feeling his own race was superior. However, when he saw the young man from the ice with his brave demeanor, he extended his hand in friendship. Nazinred, intellectually advanced compared to his peers, was intrigued by the community he was in. Although the crowded snow-hut made breakfast uncomfortable for him, he maintained composure. The Eskimos observed him closely, especially when he filled his pipe and smoked, which fascinated them. The excitement rose when he displayed his gunnery skills by shattering a piece of ice, astonishing the onlookers.

Waiting for the walrus to dive, the Eskimo and his friend sprinted towards the open water hole, then quickly dropped to the ground, knowing the animal's behavior. Soon enough, the walrus resurfaced. After a playful dive, the creature went underwater again. The Eskimos rose and dashed to the hole's edge. As the walrus surfaced for the third time, Cheenbuk stood ready with a harpoon. With a look of surprise, the walrus was harpooned by Cheenbuk and fled. The Eskimos then joined in, harpooning and lancing the walrus during a three-hour battle until it was defeated. The Indian chief, now revered, joined the Eskimos on hunting trips, teaching them hunting techniques. One winter, Cheenbuk, Nazinred, and Anteek planned a bear hunt, with Gartok offering to join.|"['1.

Cheenbuk expressed concern about Gartok's strength, but in a friendly manner, as Gartok had been recovering since being wounded by the Fire-spouter's bullet. Old Mangivik, sitting nearby, sighed deeply, perhaps reminiscing about his own lost strength. The Eskimos were in a valley that led towards icy glaciers and a majestic yet desolate landscape. Cheenbuk, Gartok, and a little boy left the sledge to investigate fresh bear tracks. Meanwhile, the presumptuous boy, left in charge, decided to move the sledge but accidentally set the dogs off running. As the hunters heard the commotion, they saw the dogs running back towards them with the empty sledge. The boy bravely approached the bear with his spear, distracting it while Cheenbuk and Gartok prepared to attack from different sides.|"[""1.

Three hunters closed in on their prey, a bear, causing it to grow anxious. Gartok, one of the hunters, got close to the bear, while the other two hunters, Cheenbuk and Anteek, moved in. Anteek poked the bear to distract it, allowing Cheenbuk to strike. However, Gartok's strike was weak, and in the commotion, the bear fell on him. Cheenbuk realized Gartok needed help and sent Anteek for aid. Anteek rushed back for assistance, leaving the boy and Gartok with Cheenbuk. Cheenbuk carefully moved Gartok to a snow mound for shelter as a storm approached. Despite Cheenbuk's efforts, Gartok's condition worsened. The situation was dire, and Cheenbuk and the boy worked together to protect Gartok from the harsh weather.|"[""1.

The boy quickly followed orders, while the other swiftly began skinning the bear. Skilled with the knife, he efficiently removed the thick fur from the carcass and wrapped his companion in it to ward off the biting cold. Despite the boy's efforts, the freezing temperatures had nearly rendered the man unconscious. The warmth of the bear's skin revived him slightly. As the storm raged outside, Cheenbuk shielded his friend, using the bear's fur as a barrier. They huddled together until the blizzard subsided, and the sky cleared, revealing the twinkling stars. Checking on his friend, Cheenbuk found him awake but weak. They pondered life's mysteries and the wisdom of the Creator. Cheenbuk believed that the Maker had a plan for everyone and trusted that all would be revealed in due time.|"[""1.

Gartok expressed regret, acknowledging that despite knowing what was right, he often chose wrong. Cheenbuk, in response, admitted to similar struggles but shared how his perspective had shifted towards desiring what is right. He attributed this change to a higher power, believing he could not have transformed on his own. As they reflected, Anteek approached with the sledge, having found the dogs entangled but persevering through the storm. They prepared a comfortable spot for the injured Gartok, only to discover he had passed away. The narrative also delves into the Scottish Highlander's longing for intellectual conversation and his disappointment in the lack of suitable companions and literature. MacSweenie, eager for philosophical discussions, found little engagement among his crew, including Donald Mowat, who was kind but lacked depth in conversation. Lastly, the trader Tonal' discussed plans for a journey to the Ukon River, expressing eagerness to depart the current monotonous setting.|"[""1.

Shortly after the discussion we just talked about, the boat arrived with the man assigned to take over from MacSweenie on Great Bear Lake, along with supplies for the new post. Things move quickly in these wild areas. In a few days, the handover was done, goods were packed, and the expedition boat was loaded. MacSweenie, Donald Mowat, Bartong, and eight men rowed swiftly towards the Arctic shore. Skipping the voyage, we return to a warm summer day when animal life is buzzing, especially with mosquitoes and sand-flies. Bartong, a mixed-heritage man, was a skilled oarsman and guide. As they reached a small lake, Bartong suggested camping for the night. The boat glided ashore in the dark, calm night, creating a serene atmosphere.|"['1.

The group's voices softened as they gathered around the campfire, the light chasing away the darkness. MacSweenie, no longer the leader, became a friendly companion. Mowat shared tales of the past, while Bartong, still dignified, listened attentively. The men enjoyed the stories, the tobacco, and the sounds of the cooking. Appetites satisfied, they settled down for the night by the fire. The expedition reached the Ukon River, a promising site for an outpost. MacSweenie admired the scenery and suggested it as a fort location. As they approached a bend in the river, Mowat pointed out more tents ahead. The men were excited to see their friends waiting for them. Mozwa had scouted the area to find the best spot for the fort, hoping to aid the traders in settling before winter. MacSweenie praised Mozwa's choice, grateful for his efforts.|"['1.

While Mozwa was busy discussing with the leader of the expedition, their guide Bartong roamed around the wigwams, charming the locals. Bartong, being of mixed blood and skilled in languages, was considered a half-brother by the natives. Magadar, feeling a bit troubled by the loss of the daughter, mentioned that the steersman had talked about the departure of their father. Isquay, with a tender heart, remembered the father as a good hunter and a kind man who always shared with them. The guide reassured Isquay that the father would return with her little girl, emphasizing that a good and brave man like him never fails. MacSweenie, pleased with Mozwa's choice of a site for the trading post, wasted no time in starting the construction. He distributed gifts to the Indians, marked out the building locations, and organized the work, creating a lively scene of activity. MacSweenie planned a house-warming party for the Indians to make a good first impression, believing that initial sentiments are crucial for lasting relationships.|"['1.

The interpreter, Tonal', responded matter-of-factly to MacSweenie's concerns about the damaged pit-saw, but MacSweenie dismissed the issue, urging Tonal' to focus on his fiddling skills instead. Mowat, the interpreter, took the feedback in his stride, understanding MacSweenie's directness. Mowat was known for his calm and unoffendable nature. As preparations for the evening feast began, Mowat tuned his violin, drawing the attention of three young Dogrib braves passing by.

Cheenbuk decided to add an air of mystery to their expedition, even though he wasn't entirely sure of their goal or how long they would be away. By appearing solemn and keeping his thoughts to himself, he wanted to impress his tribe that he was wise, even though he was a good-natured man with a sense of humor. Aglootook, the magician, tried to get Cheenbuk to reveal their plans, but the leader remained silent, making the magician believe there were deep intentions at play. Traveling by dog-sledge among the Eskimos is fast and exciting when the ice is smooth. They encountered challenges like hummocks and icebergs that slowed them down.

Upon seeing it, Aglootook regained some of his self-esteem and, with a look of profound wisdom, expressed his belief that they could have avoided this difficulty if they had followed his advice and traveled in the correct direction. Cheenbuk acknowledged his mistake, prompting Anteek to gaze at the nearby icebergs thoughtfully. The team was led towards the most passable part of the ridge, a challenging crossing where blocks seemed insurmountable. Cheenbuk's perseverance found narrow passages, and when blocked, he and the Indian cleared the way while Anteek guided the dogs and Oolalik steered the sled. Nootka observed, while Aglootook offered advice no one heeded. The group discovered a dead sailor, likely lost while searching for Eskimos, and buried him before continuing their journey towards the distant land seen by Nazinred. Cheenbuk's correctness was acknowledged upon finding a three-masted ship nestled under a cliff, intact and intriguing.|['1.

The ship's deck was covered with a canvas roof, snow piled around it for protection from the wind. A staircase cut into the snow led to the ship's entrance. Natives cautiously approached, unsure of the reception they might receive. They found no one on board and fired a shot to test for life, creating echoes that startled them. Eventually, they ventured on board, finding the ship's interior filled with wonders that puzzled and amazed them. The group explored the ship, stepping cautiously as if afraid of disturbing ghosts. A sudden act of curiosity led Cowlik and Nootka to explore further, with the men following. Cowlik's encounter with a mirror caused a mix of laughter and alarm, surprising the group.|"[""1.

Anteek stuck out his long tongue, and his reflection mimicked him. This set off a wave of laughter that even spread to the serious Nazinred. As the Eskimos explored a forsaken ship, they stumbled upon a blacksmith's forge filled with iron treasures. Anteek found a strange watch, similar to one he had seen with traders. Meanwhile, Nootka delighted in trying on a pilot-cloth coat, showcasing her quick adaptation to new things.

In all their explorations, they found no food. It was evident the crew stayed by the ship until supplies ran out. They hoped to escape the ice but faced starvation. Some tried to flee in boats, but without success. The magician suggested returning with more sledges to gather all they could. Aglootook agreed, proposing to bring the whole tribe to live there until the ice melted. Cheenbuk, enjoying a bear steak, planned to bring everyone, even the smallest children, to benefit from the findings. Anteek, eager to help, retrieved a forgotten spear. Unbeknownst to him, a polar bear followed. Polar bears, curious and brave, approached cautiously. Courage and curiosity drove the bear to investigate the ship.|"[""1.

"The Eskimos were excited to see the amazing sights they had heard about and quickly prepared to leave. The entire village hid the items they got from the ship and joyfully started their journey towards the far east. When they arrived, they were amazed by the white man's ""Big kayak"" and felt like the Queen of Sheba, realizing they hadn't been told everything. The mirror on the ship brought out vanity in unexpected ways, with some admiring their appearance while others made faces or tried to understand their own ugliness. The natives developed a sense of shame and blushing due to being laughed at for self-admiration. They settled on the shore, built igloos, and dismantled the ship to take useful items, like metal tools and kitchenware, which were treasures to them. The Eskimos were thrilled by the wealth and constant surprises, facing perplexities that sometimes baffled even the wisest among them.

Cheenbuk explained the process of using a wooden leg as a weapon to the others. He suggested filling it with the enemy's blood, letting it freeze, and then showing it off as a trophy. While many found this idea intriguing, a young boy named Doocheek decided to try it out. He wore the wooden leg on his head, but when he jumped up in excitement, his leg crashed through the roof of the hut. Despite the mishap, the group found it amusing and continued exploring. They discovered a locked cabin filled with useful tools and equipment. Cheenbuk and an Indian named Nazinred demonstrated their knowledge of saws and other tools, impressing the others.

Cheenbuk and Oolalik quickly obeyed their leader, inspiring others to do the same based on their abilities and nature. Anteek, despite his size, dashed below excitedly. Young men hurried to remove snow into the hole, while even the elderly Mangivik did so as fast as he could. Raventik, in his recklessness, hurled a lump of snow below and then back up due to the harsh atmosphere.

After the explosion at the ship, the Eskimos gathered what they could salvage. With the guidance of Nazinred and Adolay, they sorted through the items left behind. They found tools that could be useful, like needles and threads. The group decided it was time to head back to their summer camp at Waruskeek. Aglootook and Mangivik, respected elders, advised leaving soon due to the warm weather and melting ice. The tribe packed their sledges with the salvaged goods and set off towards their summer retreat. Upon reaching the old village, they hid their possessions and prepared for the journey. The Eskimos equipped themselves with bows, spears, and knives made from the ship's wood. As the ice melted, they transitioned to kayaks and oomiaks, heading southwest towards Waruskeek, with some tribe members staying behind. Cheenbuk asked Adolay to be his partner, and Anteek's interruption led to some confusion before they set off on their voyage.|"['1.

Old Uleeta led another oomiak, and Aglootook, eyeing her, wished for an easier ride by her side instead of paddling his own kayak. But tradition and his sense of manhood kept him in his place. The flotilla started on a calm spring morning with ice and bergs around. Seals, walruses, and birds frolicked until hunger drove the Eskimos to hunt. The walruses, usually prey, turned aggressive. The Eskimos approached a herd with large tusks, and Oolalik harpooned a cow, causing chaos as they all plunged into the sea. The bulls, roaring, charged the oomiak, risking an upset.

As mentioned before, it is uncommon for Native Americans to protest, but Isquay and Adolay, along with Nazinred, were ahead of their time, often challenging the traditional views of their community. Meanwhile, MacSweenie and his companion were warning the Indians at the dock about their old enemies, the eaters-of-raw-flesh, lurking nearby. Despite MacSweenie's efforts to diffuse the tension and encourage hospitality, Magadar, a fierce warrior, seemed ready for conflict. However, Nazinred's diplomatic efforts and Donald Mowat's music eventually led to a peaceful encounter between the two groups. MacSweenie, with a secret plan in mind, believed that love could be the key to bridging the gap between the Eskimos and the traders.
