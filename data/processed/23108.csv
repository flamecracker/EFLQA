After completing the writing, Bruce signed it and then fell back exhausted. Two days later, he passed away. The eight dollars weekly support from the minister's fund stopped coming to the Rands. Chester couldn't find work, despite owning five lots in Tacoma left by a deceased pauper. The situation seemed bleak. At Walter Bruce's funeral, Chester, his mother, and a few friends paid their respects. Silas Tripp, too busy at the store, didn't attend and criticized the Rands for going into debt for Bruce. With Tacoma having only 400 residents and uncertainty about the Northern Pacific Railroad, Chester began seeking ways to earn income. After Bruce's passing, Chester received a letter from Herbert Conrad, informing him of selling his sketch for ten dollars and encouraging more submissions.

Mr. Sharpleigh followed closely behind Felix, trying to figure out how the money was being taken.

When I left, my stepfather hadn't received any money from my mother. She's cautious and didn't trust him with it. He thought it was because of my influence, but it wasn't. She's careful about her money due to her Scottish background. She let him use the income but kept some for herself. She asked him to change his ways, but he refused. He had shady friends who frequented his bar, and he didn't want to lose them by switching businesses. He complained that she kept most of the money and only gave him the income. Wilson reassured me that my mother's caution was wise. Edward was happier with his friend around, and he praised the place. He suggested Mr. Rand visit the West, but Mr. Trimble's influence over my mother discouraged me from returning. Chester thrived at _The Phoenix_, earning more without increasing expenses.

"Dear Mother,

Please do not worry about the loss of income due to Miss Dolby's departure. I have a larger income than you think, and I will continue to send you the same amount weekly as you received from your boarder. Any surplus can be saved for the future.
