The narrow river they traveled on was wide at the start, decreasing gradually as they moved along. At Wolf Glen, the river was still three-fourths as wide as where they began.

When the Association was established, rustlers were few and mainly focused on branding unmarked yearlings with their own symbols. Because State laws required brands to be registered for ownership, rustlers believed they had rights to their brands like legitimate cowmen. As long as the yearlings were unbranded, it was hard to stop them. But as rustlers increased, they became bolder, altering brands and forging documents. The Association banned cowmen involved with rustlers, leading some to join the rustling business. Rustlers faced challenges as the Live Stock Association closely monitored cattle markets, confiscating rustler's cattle unless proven legitimate. With markets closed off, rustlers resorted to butchering their cattle or driving them to Montana. Despite challenges, rustlers showed exceptional horsemanship and cattle-handling skills. Young Sterry, working for the Live Stock Association, investigated rustler operations, risking his life to combat rustling activities across Wyoming and Montana.|['1.

Inman realized he had taken a wrong turn while being pursued by rustlers. Despite his experience, he failed to pay attention to the moon or the mountains to figure out his location. Riding cautiously with his horse, Queenie, he spotted a ranch in the moonlight. Unsure of whose ranch it was, Inman reflected on the distance he had covered, suspecting he had strayed off course. He dismounted to check on Queenie, who seemed to have been slightly hurt earlier. As he approached the ranch, he remained vigilant, knowing the rustlers were still searching for him.

The man and woman strolled past the home to the simple but spacious shelter at the back where the horses sometimes stayed when not in use or when the weather was harsh. They took off the horse's gear and made her comfortable before returning to the front of the building to chat and smoke before bedtime. The warm Chinook wind from the Pacific Ocean softened the winters in parts of Montana, Wyoming, and the West. It was early May, and despite the chill, Sterry and Whitney enjoyed sitting outside in their warm clothes. Whitney's wound was healing well, and he was eager to resume his duties without his arm in a sling. Sterry hoped Jennie would join them but understood her responsibility to her grieving mother. Jennie eventually appeared and listened intently as Sterry recounted his encounter with rustlers. Despite her familiarity with danger, her concern for Sterry was evident. After a brief exchange, Jennie bid them goodnight, leaving Sterry to ponder his future in the face of ongoing threats.|"['1.

At night, the ranchers usually stayed at their employer's ranch since the vast herds of cattle didn't need constant watching. The cattle roamed freely over extensive ranges, sometimes wandering far from home for days or weeks. Their distinctive brands prevented major losses. The couple rode to the foothills where the cattle would graze for a while. Tensions were high between them and the cowboys after recent events. There was a risk of rustlers stealing part of the herd. Budd and Weber sat against a rock, allowing their horses to graze freely. They discussed the escalating situation, with Weber unsure of the outcome. Weber shared a superstitious story to which Budd laughed silently, knowing his friend's quirks. Their conversation revealed the challenges and dangers they faced in the rugged landscape.|"[""1.

When we set up camp, I approached the lieutenant with a warning of trouble. He inquired about my intuition, and I explained that my left leg's twitching forewarned danger.

In the moonlit night, the rancher spotted a man approaching. Ready for action, he aimed his Winchester, despite being on foot and at a disadvantage without their horses. The ranchers sped up, closing in on the rustlers who were herding the cattle too fast. Two horsemen were also spotted, pushing the cattle recklessly. Angered, the rancher prepared to shoot, but Grizzly Weber warned that the Indians were skilled horsemen. The Indian evaded the shot by using his horse as a shield.

"Grizzly, with his vast experience handling cattle, noticed a significant change in the behavior of the stampeding herd.

It became clear that their horses were missing, likely stolen. Budd and Grizzly quickly mounted their remaining horses to intervene.

The couple involved in the nighttime events must have known that causing chaos with Whitney's herd was pointless. The cattle were branded and couldn't be sold.

Suspected as rustlers, three men were sent to flank them without alerting their horses. As the situation unfolded, Sterry stood by his promise to Vesey. Hendricks, feeling conflicted, suggested they report to Capt. Asbury. Sterry, apprehensive of the captain's temper, vowed to defend Vesey. Despite Hendricks' doubts, Sterry insisted on honoring his word. As the group gathered, Sterry boldly reaffirmed his commitment, which angered Capt. Asbury.

In the dim light, Duke Vesey made a daring escape on his horse, dodging shots from his pursuers. Captain Asbury was not pleased and vented his frustration. Monteith Sterry, however, remained composed. Vesey's account of the incident differed from the truth. The rustlers had unknowingly approached a house and were met with a shot. Vesey fled while his companion stayed to face the consequences. As tensions rose between rustlers and ranchmen, Captain Asbury strategized with his men. They decided to join larger groups of stockmen or retreat to safety. The night grew cold, hinting at danger. They camped by a stream, vigilant for any threats. The next morning, they scouted the area and spotted a rider in distress nearby.|"['1.

It was odd that the messenger, if indeed he was one, knew the exact path to reach Capt. Asbury's camp, riding swiftly towards it. Monteith Sterry, observant, noticed the horseman's sideways approach, armed with a spyglass, scanning the horizon anxiously. Spotting the couple, the rider hastened towards them. As he drew near, he recognized the captain and Sterry, shocked to find his old friend, Dick Hawkridge. Hawkridge shared a warning about the Cattle Association's expedition led by Capt. Smith, consisting of skilled fighters. He cautioned against the looming conflict with rustlers, urging caution. Vesey's false accusations added to the tension, prompting Hawkridge to rush and alert his friends of the impending danger.|"[""1.

I knew the way to Vesey's ranch and was heading there when I saw you and Sterry on this hill. I saw you through my glass, knew it was you, and rushed over. I didn't realize it was you, Mont, until I almost bumped into you. He mentioned you handled a dispute well, but didn't go into details. He strongly opposes the captain and his group, vowing none will leave the area alive. Captain, Duke Vesey keeps his word. Head south with your men; join the Texans if you meet them, or head to Fort Fetterman if you don't. You shouldn't be here, captain. Asbury, a civil war veteran, puffed on his cigar, pondering. If we join other stockmen, the situation changes. I'm willing to retreat but won't be chased out. Let's find a defensible spot. The rustlers pursued, but the stockmen remained ahead. The terrain was hilly, with lush vegetation. Hawkridge hoped to reach his ranch soon. Unexpectedly, another group blocked their path, altering their plans. They turned left to find a defensive location. Hawkridge led, followed by Sterry, Asbury, and the rest.|"['1.

When the rustlers and the cattlemen abruptly changed their paths, they were unaware of each other's presence due to a ridge blocking their view. Confusion ensued as they tried to figure out the sudden turn. Eventually, the rustlers regrouped and taunted the cattlemen before galloping after them. A confrontation was imminent as the chase couldn't go on forever. Both sides were eager for a showdown. As tensions rose, Captain Asbury contemplated stopping to face the rustlers. A gunshot rang out, signaling a critical moment. The rustlers paused, strategizing on how to intercept the cattlemen. They split into two groups, planning to corner their foes. Luckily, the cattlemen found refuge at a nearby building, seeking shelter from the impending clash. The rustlers, familiar with the terrain, plotted their next move. Amidst the chase, the group, led by Sterry, Hawkridge, and Captain Asbury, sought refuge at a house, seeking sanctuary from the pursuing rustlers.|['1.

As we face uncertainty about how long we'll be here, it's crucial to understand our defenses. The rustlers could easily take our horses from the stables at the back without us noticing. We have limited rations that might last for a few days. Water is scarce due to the siege, making it challenging to access our usual source. Captain Asbury assessed the situation and found that they could manage for a few days with careful rationing. The ranch was encircled by rustlers, with some approaching from unexpected angles. Despite tensions, no one had been injured due to the cattlemen's restraint in returning fire. Both sides refrained from escalating the conflict further, knowing the potential consequences.

Around midday, a man on horseback appeared with a white flag signaling peace. The besieged were intrigued, watching as he cautiously approached. The man, holding a white handkerchief over his head, halted a hundred feet away. Meanwhile, inside, there was a search for a white handkerchief. Miss Whitney provided one, and the man was allowed in. He conveyed that surrender was not an option. He explained that Ira Inman led the opposing forces and offered them a chance to surrender. However, Inman wanted to hold them as hostages for the safety of their own men. Despite the tense situation, the captain and his men stood firm, refusing to betray their comrades.
