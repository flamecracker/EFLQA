"Just behind the Guardian-Mother was a sleek and lovely steam-launch, measuring fifty feet long. The notable passengers aboard were the group of American boys known as the ""Big Four."" Among them, Louis Belgrave, the young millionaire, was highly regarded by his friends, though he remained humble. These boys, aged eighteen and sixteen, shared a love for adventure, including hunting, fishing, and outdoor activities. After traveling extensively through Europe, India, and Southeast Asia, they grew weary of city sights and sought a more hands-on experience. Upon deciding to explore Borneo, they petitioned the captain for three weeks on the island. With some convincing, they secured approval and set off on their expedition with a steam-launch provided by General Noury. Accompanied by a Bornean guide and a few sailors, they bid farewell to the Guardian-Mother and embarked on their journey up the Sarawak River."|['1.

Louis objected to the amendment, expressing his support for Captain Scott as a skilled and capable leader. The crew voted, with the majority in favor of the original motion, appointing Scott as captain and Morris as mate. Despite being outvoted, Scott accepted the decision. Achang, an experienced river pilot, confirmed his knowledge of the area. Clinch, a proficient seaman, steered the launch under Scott's guidance, ensuring sufficient water depth. The launch, once used by a rajah, had a sturdy brass rod structure with canvas roofing and curtains for protection. The interior, known as the cabin, featured cushioned seats, a table for meals, and storage lockers. This setup provided comfort and functionality for the explorers' journey.|"[""1.

Just ahead of the living area, the engine and boiler were situated, with coal bunkers on each side. The central part of the boat had ample room. Towards the front, there were cushioned divans for passengers to relax during the day and sleep at night; this area was also designated for the sailors. In the middle was the wheel, and adjacent to it was the galley equipped with a large stove and necessary utensils. The crew inspected the boat with enthusiasm and were satisfied with the setup. The launch had been prepared the day before and was now ready for use. After docking near the town's business building, the crew and passengers were served dinner. The afternoon was spent exploring and gathering supplies for the upcoming voyage early the next day. To aid in hunting trips, a small skiff was purchased. The explorers were advised about mosquitoes and provided with mosquito bars for protection while sleeping on board. Captain Scott organized the watches, and the crew began their duties as the boat continued its journey up the river.|['1.

"By now, all the group had risen from their beds and gotten dressed in simple clothing. Felipe was getting the boat ready to sail, and the crew had tidied up the boat. ""I'm ready, but there's not much steering needed; just stay in the middle of the river,"" said the Bornean. Louis shared his knowledge about orangutans with the group, explaining the meaning of the name. The boat was prepared to leave the shore, heading towards the middle of the wide river. On the opposite side, they saw the village of the locals. As they sailed up the river, they observed houses on stilts, a common sight in the region."|"['1.

The village located ten miles upstream was built following a similar blueprint. The houses were strategically positioned just beyond the water's reach during high tides. They were made of a bamboo-like material, resembling structures in India, topped with kadjang leaves commonly found in low-lying areas. Each house had a flat boat, known as a sampan, parked in front. One sampan even had a roof made of the same material as the house. A bear sighting on the opposite shore caused a stir among the group, prompting Morris to grab his rifle in excitement. The creature, initially mistaken for a bear, turned out to be a tall and lanky animal resembling a Kentucky hog. Achang explained that their long legs were a result of foraging in swamps. The professor later discussed the geography of Australia and Borneo, highlighting their vast land areas and mountainous regions.|"['1.

In the low coastal areas, the weather is hot and damp, which might not be suitable for everyone. However, in the high mountainous regions, the temperature is more moderate, ranging from 81° to 91° Fahrenheit during midday. The rainy season from November to May brings strong windstorms and thunder-showers along the west coast. During hot weather, sea breezes can be felt quite far inland. The vegetation in these areas is lush, with various types of woods similar to those found in the Indian Archipelago. Borneo, specifically Brunei on the northwest coast, is known for producing high-quality camphor, a substance extracted from certain plants. The refining process of camphor involves boiling the oil with water, allowing steam to form, and then solidifying the camphor in a vessel before sending it to market. Borneo is also rich in spices, fruits, cotton, sugar-cane, and diverse wildlife, including monkeys, tapirs, bears, swine, cattle, deer, elephants, rhinoceroses, and an array of birds like eagles, vultures, peacocks, and swifts. The rivers and lakes teem with crocodiles, leeches, and various snakes, while the waters are abundant with fish.

The island of Borneo is so vast that you could fit all of New England, the Middle States, and Maryland within its borders, and you'd still have swamp and jungle to spare. The Dutch control most of the island, with the Sultan of Brunei governing the northwest. Sarawak, once part of Brunei, was taken over by the North Borneo Company. Labuan, off the coast of Brunei, is now an English coaling station. North Borneo, under the North Borneo Company, is larger than Maine and set to thrive. Sarawak, nearly the size of Pennsylvania, was transformed by Sir James Brooke, who ended the gruesome practice of head-hunting. His efforts improved governance and abolished the barbaric tradition on the island.|"['1.

The Sultan once tolerated piracy, making it rampant near the Malay states. Sir James Brooke bravely fought the pirates, driving them away swiftly. The Dyaks, simple but prone to head-hunting, were no match for the cunning, dishonest Malays who mistreated them unjustly. Under the new rajah's fair rule, justice prevailed. Brooke visited England in 1847, where he was honored by the Queen and appointed governor of Labuan. Accused of taking rewards for pirate killings, he proved his innocence. Despite facing Chinese attacks for halting opium smuggling, Brooke retaliated with Dyaks and Malays, defeating them decisively. His efficient governance led to Sarawak's prosperity, growing from 1,000 to 25,000 residents. Brooke's legacy continued with his nephew, Sir C. T. Brooke, who expanded the territory and sought protection from the United Kingdom. The Dyaks of Borneo, once associated with piracy and head-hunting, now lead peaceful lives as farmers and producers, showcasing social virtues worth emulating.|"['1.

"If any of the group want to learn more about the Dyaks, their ways and traditions, present and past, you can find a book in two parts, by the Rev. J. G. Wood, called 'The Uncivilized Races of Men.' The Blanchita continued on her journey up the river with Clingman steering. There was no table in the front cabin, so the six men, including the engineer, had their dinner served at the back after the ""Big Four"" had eaten. Louis looked after the engine while Felipe had his meals and sometimes at other times. A table isn't necessary for the crew of a ship, and one isn't used on a merchant vessel; but Louis wanted everyone on the little steamer to have an equal meal. The dinner was finished, and Wales was steering. The men had nothing to do, and a couple helped Pitts wash the dishes. It was a quiet time, and the ""Big Four"" were eager for some excitement beyond just sailing along the river. All of the group had their weapons nearby, including the three sailors who weren't busy; but they weren't expected to use the rifles unless ordered by the captain or one of the hunters. The people in the front cabin, the main figures on board, had the front of the boat to themselves, though the crew could use the seats when not needed by any of the ""Big Four.""

The captain was pleased with Louis's swift action in dealing with the crocodile, comparing the creature to a nuisance that needed to be removed. The crew hoisted the carcass out of the water for measurement, revealing it to be twelve feet and two inches long. The Bornean man skillfully severed the crocodile's head from its body with a sharp sword, impressing everyone on board. The head was kept as a trophy while the rest of the carcass was left for other creatures to consume. Later, they encountered monkeys with long noses, known as proboscis monkeys. Louis explained their unique features, such as their elongated noses that resemble those of elephants. The crew marveled at the wildlife they encountered during their journey.|"['1.

"While the group examined the creatures, the leader commanded the boat to reverse and then move forward. They anchored for the night shortly after. The following morning, following Achang's advice, they guided the Blanchita downstream as he claimed they would not find different wildlife along the Sarawak riverbanks. The group was active at daybreak; early hours are pleasant in the tropics, and they had adopted the habit of rising early in India. The trees teemed with various monkeys, with the proboscis monkeys prevailing. Felix emerged with his gun to observe the tree-dwellers with curiosity. ""I wanted to study the creature. Now everyone knows what a proboscis monkey is, unlike before when it was just a name. I'm glad I read up on it before encountering it,"" shared Louis, who had fashioned a peculiar implement.

The young gentleman decided not to harm the snake they encountered. Despite his companions' desire to hunt, he insisted on preserving wildlife. The group had a hearty breakfast after a failed attempt to shoot crocodiles. Louis, the leader, refused to kill monkeys for sport but allowed the shooting of harmful animals. As they continued their journey, they encountered more crocodiles, and each member took turns trying to shoot them. Louis managed to take down three crocodiles, showcasing his marksmanship. The group enjoyed their meal while hearing shots fired at distant crocodiles. Louis and the others successfully eliminated more crocodiles, with Louis displaying exceptional accuracy.

The crew had a successful crocodile-hunting expedition, with Achang showcasing his skills by taking down six reptiles. The heads of the crocodiles were measured by the chief of police in Kuching, totaling 108 feet. Each hunter received a share of the bounty money, except for Louis who declined any payment. The money was divided into ten parts, with each person receiving about four dollars in silver. The crew then explored the town, visiting a fruit store run by a Chinaman and making purchases at various shops. They also visited the English Mission and a school, learning about the Dyak language. The next morning, they set off towards the Sadong and Simujan Rivers, encountering Malays engaged in crocodile hunting. The crew observed the Malays using a rattan line to catch a crocodile, with the Blanchita following along to witness the process.|"['1.

A tough green bark was wrapped around a stick to prevent a game from biting it. A big fish was attached as bait and thrown overboard from a sampan. The Malays paid out their lines while the spectators watched eagerly. The crocodiles approached the bait and quickly devoured it. The Malays skillfully hooked the crocodiles, causing a struggle in the water. The yacht assisted in pulling the crocodiles closer for capture. The crocodiles were not killed immediately due to towing concerns. Eventually, the crocodiles were brought ashore, and their heads were skillfully removed to end their suffering. The larger crocodile measured twelve feet and four inches, while the smaller one measured ten feet and seven inches. The voyage continued up the Sadong River after the successful capture.|"['1.

The leader responded in their language that they wanted to reach Simujan for hunting. Bujang was praised as a skilled hunter, having taken down fifty-three crocodiles that year. The yacht, towing the sampan, journeyed up the river, reaching the junction of Simujan and Sadong at sunset. On one side stood a Malay village with coconut palms, and on the other, a Chinese quarter with shops. Louis Belgrave, acknowledged as the Guardian-Mother's owner in Sarawak, was respected. An official gave him a letter for the Chinese official in Simujan, where they were offered lodging in the government house. The rooms were elevated on stilts and well-furnished. The Malays earned money from their game and shared details about fishing with tuba plants to catch fish. The next morning, the group bid farewell to the agent and sailed up the river.|"[""1.

"The men on the sampan had a unique tool called a ""biliong"" that they used like an axe. They were cutting poles and saplings to build a framework. One man climbed the structure with his biliong to chop down a tree. The other man brought spears, a sword called a parong latok, and ropes. The ""Big Four"" on the yacht watched as the tree fell, and the orangutans were startled. The men rushed forward, ready to capture the animals. The engineer stayed behind.

The initial Malay, who had done the chopping, faced the orangutan, and they stood eye to eye. Suddenly, the animal leaped towards the man and was met by the tip of his spear. The orangutan was injured, but this only fueled her anger, leading to a fierce attack on the man. Despite her efforts, the spear proved too much for her, causing more wounds. Displaying a menacing double row of teeth and long tusks, the orangutan tried repeatedly to reach the man but was thwarted by the spear. The observers marveled at the Malay's skill in handling the weapon. Eventually, the orangutan broke the spear and the man switched to a parang latok. The skirmish continued, with the beast getting wounded each time. Meanwhile, the other Malay used a long cord to capture the young orangutan. The battle ended when the first Malay delivered fatal stabs with his parang latok. Following the fight, the wounded men sought medical help from Pitts, who skillfully treated their injuries.|"['1.

With the help of the sailors, the body of the old orangutan was pulled down to the river and placed in the boat of the Malays. The young one was extremely ugly and tried to bite the men. Clingman managed to stop him by putting a rope in his mouth and tying it tightly around his head. Despite being furious, the young orangutan couldn't bite anymore. The yacht resumed its journey with the Malay boat in tow, moving swiftly down the river. The strong outgoing tide caused some excitement as a large wave swept up the river, overturning smaller boats.

Chuckling at his own words, it was clear the speaker was not a follower of Darwin's theory.

Louis, a passionate naturalist, firmly rejected the idea of killing for pleasure. He believed in studying animals for knowledge and admiration. Equipped with his fowling-piece, he shot a large, colorful bird with a long tail for educational purposes. Louis explained that the bird's feathers, when alive, displayed eye-like markings on them, resembling the mythological figure Argus. Scott and his companions, on a mission to study natural history in Borneo, valued observation over indiscriminate shooting. Shortly after, Felix, a skilled marksman, shot a peculiar two-foot-long creature with a broad head and dark fur, sparking curiosity among the crew.

One of the otter family, called the otter-cat by Mr. Hornaday, could have been a great specimen for the ship's cabin. Covered boats on rivers are made of bamboo frames with leaf coverings sewn together like shingles to shed rain. The sides were sometimes curtained with the same material. The long leaves from the nipa palm, abundant on the island, serve many purposes. The boat waited for the covered sampan and two appeared. The Chinese agent invited the party to a Dyak village up the river to see a long-house. Sea Dyaks, not sea-faring now, used to have large war-boats. These boats were used on rivers and lakes for naval battles and were propelled by oars.

In this warm climate, people wear simple clothing like a bark-cloth wrapped around the waist called a _chawat_. Women and children in the village wear petticoats made of bark-cloth, some embroidered with figures. The women also wear red jackets and Malay hats on special occasions. They adorn themselves with brass wire rings, some worn tightly around the body or loosely around the neck. Their black hair is tied up neatly behind. The village has a large slanted structure with palm trees in the background.

In England and France, the construction of buildings amazed Morris. He noticed that the structures were supported by round poles tied with ropes, which a local man claimed were sturdier than nails. Mr. Eng shared insights about the unique construction methods of the Malays and Dyaks using flexible rattan. The house they examined had no windows, and the space underneath collected refuse, emitting an unpleasant odor. The structure was supported by numerous posts, some reaching the roof. Inside, a young girl graciously welcomed Louis and presented an intricately woven mat. The group explored further, observing human skulls, remnants of past head-hunting practices. Louis followed the girl into a room with mats for sleeping and a fire pit. The roof was made of palm pieces that could be lifted for ventilation.|['1.

The party walked the entire length of the hall, and then passed out upon the platform, which was not covered, and was used for various purposes, such as drying rice or other articles.

Louis shot the creature, and it fell into the water below the tree. Despite being wounded badly, the creature struggled to escape. Louis took another shot when the opportunity arose. The orangutan held onto a screw-pine but stopped struggling. The captain ordered the boat to be brought closer, and the men paddled towards the fallen animal.

"The crates and drums were shifted to the front and back, and a workspace was set up for the Bornean. The sampan was cleaned after dinner, and the ""Big Four"" hopped in, paddling themselves as there wasn't space for more. Each had a rifle. A short trip later, they were on dry land. Louis shot a deer right away, followed by Felix. Two more deer and wild pigs were taken down. It seemed they were in an untouched hunting spot. Scott was cautious about leaving the yacht due to water levels. The men skinned the deer, and the cook prepared the pigs. Achang worked in his workshop, preserving the animal parts. Scott steered the yacht back to the river, navigating carefully. Louis looked forward to exploring the lakes ahead.

The ship's captain signaled to slow down as the boat approached a narrow part of the river with a strong current and dense vegetation on each side. After a while, they encountered a blockage formed by fallen pine trees. The captain ordered the crew to cover the front of the boat to protect it from scratches. With full steam ahead, the boat attempted to break through the barrier but got stuck. The captain then used the anchor creatively to apply pressure on the barrier, causing it to break apart.

"The water was shallow, but enough for the boat. The captain steered the Blanchita north. The journey was calm, and they arrived at the lake's end. There was no suitable spot to dock, so they anchored afar. Achang and two sailors joined the ""Big Four"" on land. Armed with guns, they explored and found a Dyak long-house. The villagers were welcoming, sharing their hunting successes. Guides were hired for the mountains. The group hunted game, but found it tame.

The tide ebbed as they swiftly sailed to the sea. A strong south-west wind greeted them, causing white-caps to cover the bay. Despite not testing Blanchita in rough waters before, the rajah praised her as a capable and sturdy sea vessel. Captain Scott took the helm as they left Sadong. The first wave sprayed the boat but she elegantly rode the billows without taking in water. They secured loose items, and Scott was pleased with how the boat handled. Seeing a steamer in the distance, they later learned it was the Delhi from Calcutta. The crew sent fish to Rajah Brooke and officers. The Delhi was to sail to Saigon the next day.

The captain on the yacht was confident that the Blanchita wouldn't be able to overtake them. Despite Felipe's efforts to speed up their boat, the Blanchita was actually catching up. The crew on the yacht noticed this and set more sails to maintain their lead. As the race intensified, the Delhi captain made a strategic move by unfurling a fore squaresail. This move prevented the Blanchita from passing them. The crew on the yacht worked swiftly to adjust the sails and keep up the pace.

At noon today, the two ships were forty-four miles up the Gulf of Siam. Captain Rayburn and Achang's predictions about the weather were accurate. The monsoon blew steadily, and the yacht sailed smoothly, undisturbed by any squalls. The crew wished to explore Great Natuna Island but had no information about it. As they parted ways, Captain Scott of the Delhi praised the speed of the yacht and hoped to meet again in Saigon. The Blanchita sailed swiftly, making over nine knots an hour as it passed large islands off the coast of Cambodia. The day was uneventful, with the Delhi disappearing behind an island.

The pilot couldn't read the ship's name, but the interpreter helped him understand. The Siamese man's face lit up when he realized the ship was there. Achang revealed that the Guardian-Mother was anchored in the river, surrounded by boats and houses. The Americans found the locals similar to Burmese people. As the yacht approached the city, darkness fell, but they were excited to surprise their friends on board. The pilot pointed out the ship, and they heard singing from the music-room.

"""Good evening to everyone!"" he exclaimed. ""Please, Auntie, let's keep it quiet. The snake was having some trouble with brain indigestion, and I was too much for him! Just like soldiers surrounded by the enemy, I fought my way out, and here I am."" General Noury then approached, shaking hands with Scott, Louis, Morris, and Felix. Mrs. Blossom rushed towards Felix, but he managed to avoid her and took her hand instead. After the warm greetings from the Bornean hunters, the discussion turned to why the ""Big Four"" had cut short their explorations on the island after just one week instead of the planned three.

Many Dyak women resemble French women as they age, developing wrinkles and dry skin. The Dyaks have a high moral standard, being known for their honesty even amongst the working class. Unlike the Malays and Chinamen in Kuching who steal, the Dyaks refrain from such acts. The speaker, unimpressed by the Dyak women's appearance, hurriedly left the rostrum. Mr. Gaskette's map was displaced by Achang and the carpenter. The commander suggested postponing the lecture due to distractions on deck. The carpenter and second officer made space for the map while the Borneo hunters were entertained in the commander's cabin. The population of the city, mainly comprising Celestials, was estimated at around 300,000 to 500,000. The Nimrods shared their Borneo experiences at the table, where the ladies expressed regret at not staying longer. Scott regretted not exploring the Rajang River with the Dyak ladies.

"""Not everyone can build their home by the shore; it's a special right reserved for a select few,"" explained the teacher. ""Within the city, space is limited to palaces and temples, but outside the city limits, there's ample land for houses."" Morris added, ""These houses, made of bamboo, wicker, and plants, are like card-boxes. They feature a front veranda, perfect for reading, with extensions at each end.

The group visited a grand temple with a towering brass Buddha statue and other smaller statues. As they journeyed to the royal palace, they quickly explored more temples that seemed familiar. The palace, a stunning structure for a semi-developed nation, housed public offices, temples, a theatre, and even barracks for thousands of soldiers. The tourists were intrigued by the royal guards in unique Zouave uniforms, drilling with muskets. The palace also housed a white elephant, treated with utmost respect and living a regal life. After a day of exploration, they returned to the ship, sailing towards Saigon. The next morning, they marveled at the sights along the Menam River, including floating houses.

"In ancient times, Cambodia was a vast kingdom with strong Buddhist roots dating back to the 4th century. The ruins of Angkor Temple are a testament to Cambodia's grandeur, boasting 1,532 columns and impressive stone structures transported from a quarry over thirty miles away. The country's sturdy bridges, some spanning four hundred and seventy feet with thirty-four arches, have withstood more than a millennium of time and floods. Siam, known as ""The Land of the Free,"" covers around 250,000 square miles and is home to a diverse population. The Menam River, six hundred miles in length, sustains the majority of the population, with agriculture, especially rice farming, thriving due to abundant rainfall. Siamese culture embraces colorful attire, jewelry, and betel-nut chewing, while marriage traditions involve astrology, ceremonies, and feasting.

The Siamese people believe that diseases are caused by disturbances in the body's internal breezes. They think that a wind blowing on the heart can burst it, leading to 'heart failure' and eventual death. Their medical practices include using unusual items like cats' eyes, snake bile, sea-shells, and horns as remedies. Doctors in Siam are paid per job, not per visit, with a pre-agreed price for a cure. Poor individuals, upon passing away, are cremated after a few days. The current king of Siam, Chulalongkorn I, is a well-educated and fluent English-speaking monarch. Under his rule, the country has moved away from having two kings to a single hereditary king. The laws are established by the king alongside a council of ministers, and the forty-one provinces are overseen by commissioners appointed by the king. Justice is scarce, and theft is rampant in Bangkok, making property unsafe.|"[""1.

The third officer received orders to raise the gangway upon his return to the deck, and the ship set sail. The weather was pleasant, not overly warm for the tropics. Despite experiencing more heat in New York and Von Blonk Park than in Bangkok, the southwest monsoon provided a cooling breeze. An awning covered the platform for gatherings, with another over the back of the deck. The former, with its armchairs, was the favored spot. Once the ship reached deep waters, the pilot left, and the captain set the course south by east. Everything was functioning well onboard, and the captain joined the group on the deck. Louis mentioned reading about a large boat paddled by many men, sparking a discussion. Miss Blanche shared her observations of the locals' attire, noting the unique clothing styles.

The missionaries brought a group of people to a nobleman's private chapel. Inside, they saw around a hundred priests in yellow robes with shaven heads. The service involved repeating a phrase that meant 'So be it.' This reminded one of the visitors of the howling dervishes they had seen before. Louis explained that they were heading to Saigon, which was about six hundred miles away in French Cochin China. He mentioned that the French pronounced it as Sah-gong, while the English called it Sy-goń. Saigon was described as a city with a mix of French, Annamese, and Chinese people, boasting fine streets, canals, and a navy-yard. The voyage from Bangkok had been smooth, and the sight of land near the Mekhong River was not as exciting as expected. Captain Columbus's discovery of Watling's Island was mentioned in comparison.

A few hours later, Felix spotted the mouth of a grand river. The land was mostly low and sometimes flooded. He had a useful spy-glass from Aden, which he always carried when the ship was near land. After lunch, he stood near the pilot-house, watching for Cape St. Jacques. A light appeared, and a boat with a pilot approached. The passengers gathered to see the elderly French pilot. He joined the captain after lunch and guided the ship. The pilot and Quartermaster Bangs silently steered the ship up the river, passing villages and observing the rich soil used for rice cultivation.

The group, accompanied by the port physician, went ashore, where they were shown the landing spot and directed to their hotel. The accommodations were satisfactory, and they settled in before heading out for a walk guided by Captain Rayburn. They strolled through the French part of the city, admiring the wide tree-lined streets and two-story buildings. The governor's palace and cathedral were impressive, but the young travelers were more intrigued by the local produce and the French-trained native soldiers they encountered. The walk concluded at a botanical garden, where they explored various plants. Captain Rayburn shared insights about the city's three interconnected towns, but they had to skip visiting Pingeh and Cholon that evening due to time constraints.|"['1.

In the past, France faced challenges after the Revolution and could not fully honor its agreement with Annam. Despite missionaries being sent and some limited commercial ties continuing until 1831, a new king rose who opposed the missionaries. The king aimed to expel those spreading Christianity and persecuted them. France later intervened, sending troops to subdue the region. The soldiers faced resistance from French-built fortifications. After a peace treaty in 1886, Annam came under French protection. Captain Ringgold and Mrs. Belgrave enjoyed a historical-free breakfast before heading out for a ride through the city and botanical garden. They learned about the region's population and military presence, including the citadel and native troops. Mr. Frôler shared insights about the area, including the presence of pirates up the river.

In Tonquin, also known as Tonkin in English, the region is larger than Cochin China, covering 34,740 square miles with around 9,000,000 inhabitants. The main city is Hanoï, with 150,000 residents, and the key port is Hai-Phong. The region produces rice, silk, sugar, pepper, oil, cotton, tobacco, and fruits, along with copper and iron. Exports total 13,325,000 francs, while imports reach nearly 28,000,000 francs, with only a quarter from France. An expedition to open trade with Yun-Nan in China via the Songkoi River failed due to navigation challenges. Jules Ferry, whose colonial policies faced criticism, was involved in Tonquin affairs. The group then visited a bustling market where locals traded fruits and vegetables, with bananas being abundant.

Brother Avoirdupois chuckled as he discussed the climate of the tropical islands. He explained that the islands have two seasons, wet and dry, influenced by the monsoons. The temperature remains fairly constant throughout the year, with the coolest month being December and the hottest being May. The islands receive an average rainfall of about seventy inches annually, with variations by month. The flora of the islands is diverse, with abundant fibrous plants like abaca, which is used to make Manila hemp. The fauna is limited compared to other islands, with buffalo and gibbons being the largest animals. The islands are home to various birds, including gallinaceous birds, with cock-fighting being a popular sport. Coal and iron are the most common minerals, and the original inhabitants of the Philippines were likely Negritos, who have now mostly disappeared.|['1.

The inhabitants of the Philippines have diverse backgrounds and are classified into various groups such as Spaniards, Creoles, Tagals, Chinese, and Mestizoes. The Spaniards and Tagals are self-explanatory, with the latter being the native islanders. Creole, a Spanish term from _criolla_, signifies a person grown up in a specific location. In the Philippines, Creoles are offspring of Spanish fathers and native mothers. Mestizoes are children of Chinese parents and natives. The Spaniards in the islands are mainly Catholic, while many natives are Muslims or Catholics. The Philippines were discovered by Magellan in 1521, who proposed a westward route to the Moluccas to Charles V. Magellan's expedition, including the first circumnavigation of the globe, was a significant historical event. Manila, the capital, boasts a population of 270,000 and has modern amenities like telegraph and rail networks. The islands were governed by various authorities, and the Muslims in Sulu, north-east of Borneo, retained independence for a prolonged period.|"['1. What do Creoles in the Philippines signify?\nA.

In the afternoon of the second day, Professor Giroud gathered his students in the ship's library to resume lessons after a break since reaching Sarawak. The interruption had made the class eager and focused. However, the intense study session was short-lived due to the commander's commitment to sightseeing. The next morning, all passengers, including the siamangs, assembled in the Conference Hall for a lecture about Manila by Captain Ringgold. Manila, the Spanish East possessions' capital, has a population of 270,000, larger than Havana. The city is situated on the southwest coast of Luzon, 650 miles from Hong-Kong. Manila Bay, where vessels face challenging weather conditions, leads to the city located on both sides of the Pasig River. The city's architecture showcases a blend of Spanish and Oriental styles, with wooden structures favored due to earthquakes. Streets, often flooded in August, are unpaved, and houses are low-rise due to seismic activity. The Escolto street serves as the city's shopping hub, bustling with various trades and ethnicities.|"[""1.

The Manchus, a noble class in China, have played a significant role in the country's history. They have provided soldiers, magistrates, and police to the Chinese empire. China, a nation with a rich history, is believed to have existed for thousands of years. The country is also known as the Middle Kingdom or Chung Kwo. The name China has various origins, including the Russian name Kitai and the Indian name Chintan. The current emperor, Tsait'ien, belongs to the Manchu dynasty. China is divided into nineteen provinces, including Formosa. The country's population estimates vary but are believed to be around 400 million. China's vast land, with its few mountains and long rivers like the Yellow River and Yang-tsze-Chiang, contributes to its unique geography. The rivers flow from west to east and are crucial for transportation and irrigation in the country.|"[""1.

"Chinese history dates back over two thousand years before the common era, around the time of the first human kings of Egypt. The narrative begins with a massive flood, similar to the one in the Old Testament, which was just one of many devastating floods that have plagued China over the years. The Hoang-ho river, also known as 'China's Sorrow,' caused widespread destruction as recently as 1887. Despite these challenges, the Manchu rulers are working to repair damages and prevent future disasters.

The Grand Canal, a waterway commissioned by Kublâi Khan, once connected the north and south of China but is now less vital due to modern transportation. The Great Wall, built over two thousand years ago, was constructed as a defense against northern tribes. It stretches fifteen hundred miles and is an iconic symbol of China's history and resilience."|"['1.

In China, agriculture is the primary occupation, with various grains grown in the north and rice being a staple in the south. Vegetables, herbs, and condiments are widely used, along with sugar production in the south. Fruits like those from Florida and Louisiana are grown in different regions. The Chinese use primitive tools like hoes and plows powered by animals, with extensive irrigation methods. Fertilizers are carefully utilized. While the Chinese cuisine may differ from Western tastes, their dishes are enjoyed by many. While some may find it unusual, the Chinese breed dogs for consumption, and geese, ducks, and pork are common meats. Fish is plentiful from the sea and lakes, caught using cormorants. Tea is the preferred drink, promoting temperance. Alcohol is distilled from rice and millet.|['1.

During the twelfth century B.C., Chinese literature emphasized the importance of avoiding strong drinks, with tea playing a crucial role in discouraging alcohol consumption. Unlike some Chinese living in New York, those at home traditionally use tea more frequently than liquor. Tea, known as _ch'â_ in the vernacular, became popular in England under the name _t'ay_, possibly due to Irish influence. Silk production in China dates back to ancient times, with women primarily responsible for caring for silkworms and weaving silk. The cotton plant is also cultivated in China, with locally produced cotton cloth being durable but less refined than imported varieties. Nankeen fabric originates from Nanking. Chinese houses lack fireplaces, and warmth is achieved through layered clothing. Woollen goods are not commonly made. Streets in Chinese cities are often narrow and crowded, giving the impression of high population density. Furniture in Chinese homes is simple, with bamboo and rattan furniture being common. Bamboo is a versatile material used for various purposes, including as a tool for punishment. Wild animals are scarce due to dense population, but elephants, rhinoceroses, tapirs, and bears can be found in certain regions. Domestic animals include small horses, cattle, and lively donkeys. Mules are fashionable in Peking. Birds of prey are abundant, and magpies are considered sacred. Chinese people appreciate songbirds and flowers, reflecting their aesthetic sensibilities.|"[""1.

In China, there are seven reasons for divorcing a wife, including disobedience to her husband's parents and jealousy of other wives. Infanticide, though prevalent, is mostly among the poorest class due to the preference for male children. Chinese people have a yellowish complexion, long black hair, almond eyes, and are fond of opium and gambling. They bury their dead in horseshoe-shaped graves with elaborate ceremonies. The Chinese have no Sunday equivalent but celebrate a grand New Year holiday. Festivals like the 'Feast of Lanterns' and 'Dragon Boats' are popular monthly events. The Tâi-Ping rebellion in 1851, led by Hung, introduced a new religion emphasizing morality, the Sabbath, and banning idolatry and opium.|"[""1.

"In the mid-19th century, a rebellion led by Hung aimed to overthrow the ruling Manchu dynasty in China and place himself on the throne. Initially successful, the rebels faced setbacks due to lack of reinforcements and had to retreat to Nanking. Foreigners, including American General Ward and later General Burgevine, aided the imperialists. General Ward's successor, General Charles George Gordon, supported by British residents in Shanghai, captured Nanking, ending the rebellion in 1865.

The passage also discusses the historical interactions between Western powers and China, starting with Vasco da Gama's voyage in 1497. The Manchu rulers, claiming superiority, resisted Western influence. Opium trade disputes led to wars between China, England, and France. The Opium Wars resulted in the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, ceding Hong Kong to Britain and opening five ports for British trade. Subsequent conflicts in Canton led to another war and the signing of the Tien-tsin Treaty with provisions for diplomatic relations and missionary protection."|"['1.

The Chinese emperor faced humiliation due to a treaty clause requiring ratification in Pekin within a year. He hesitated to allow the ambassadors into the sacred capital and sought to avoid the issue. The forts were fortified, hindering progress. Despite some signing in Tien-tsin, France and England insisted on Pekin. An expedition faced resistance at the river mouth but overcame the forts. The treaty was signed in Pekin after the emperor fled. In 1861, the emperor passed away, succeeded by his young son. Foreign influence grew with the legal importation of opium and foreign officers in the military. China's navy improved, and educational institutions were established. The country developed telegraph and rail infrastructure. Despite opium concerns, China progressed and maintained peace with other nations.|"[""1.

The group continued their walk and reached a money-changer. The leader exchanged two English sovereigns for a bag of coins used in Hong-Kong, different from the native currency.
