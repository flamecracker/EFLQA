The United States gained permanent control of Puerto Rico, the oldest European-occupied possession. Discovered by Columbus in 1493, the U.S. Army occupied Guanica on July 25, 1898. Spain formally left on October 18, 1898, and a military government took over until Congress established civil rule. By an act of Congress on April 12, 1900, military control ended, and civil governance began on May 1, 1900. Puerto Rico's history is rich, with four centuries under Spanish rule. The author, Mr. Van Middeldyk, shares this history for the first time in English. The island's people were loyal to Spain, with a profitable economy. The author highlights the need for education to uplift the island's poor and create a more democratic society, which has been initiated by the civil government. The future looks bright for Puerto Rico with progress under civilian leadership.|"[""1.

A significant change in the island's social and political landscape four years ago necessitated the writing of an English history of Puerto Rico. American officials overseeing the development of this new addition to the Republic will benefit from understanding the people's historical background. The history of Puerto Rico is intertwined with the grand struggle between the Crescent and the Cross in Spain. After the Moorish king Boabdil surrendered Granada to Queen Isabel, Spain's conquests paved the way for Columbus's historic voyage. Despite facing skepticism and ridicule, Columbus returned with new discoveries, including gold, plants, and animals from the New World. His triumphant reception in Barcelona marked the beginning of a new era of exploration and conquest, leading to subsequent expeditions to the Americas.|"[""1.

During the voyage, the Admiral discovered the first island between 14째 and 15째 north latitude, part of a chain of islands stretching from Trinidad to Puerto Rico. These islands are divided into the Windward and Leeward Islands. The Admiral explored the islands, obtaining limited information. The fleet physician, Chanca, detailed the voyage's experiences in a report to Seville's Municipal Corporation. On November 3rd, joy erupted as land was sighted. The first island, Dominica, was mountainous, followed by Marie-Galante. The crew explored the lush forests, sampled fruits causing discomfort, and found deserted huts with unique items. Discovering signs of the Caribs, known for eating human flesh, the crew continued their exploration. Parties encountered captives and abandoned children, while some men went missing, later returning after days of hardships. The Spaniards discovered human remains in abandoned villages, learning about other islands yet to be found.|"['1.

On November 10th, the anchors were raised at sunrise. By midday the following day, the fleet arrived at an island marked on maps as Santa Maria de Monserrat. The Indian women aboard informed them that the Caribs had depopulated the island, leaving it uninhabited. Later that afternoon, they reached another island named Santa Maria de la Redonda by the Admiral. Due to dangerous shallows nearby, the fleet anchored for the night. The next morning, they discovered another island, la Antigua, before heading northwest to San Martin without making any stops. The Admiral's son recounts sending a small craft ashore to gather information from the locals. A skirmish ensued with the natives, resulting in the capture of several individuals. The fleet continued its journey, exploring various uninhabited islands until they reached San Juan Bautista, where they landed and claimed the island in the name of their royal patrons.|"['1.

Juan Ponce de Leon was a Spanish explorer who, driven by ambition and the allure of gold, set out to explore the uncharted island of Boriqu챕n. Despite initial resistance from the native islanders, Ponce's diplomatic approach and genuine interest in their culture led to a warm reception. The local chief, Guayb찼na, even went as far as to exchange names with Ponce as a sign of friendship. With the chief's guidance, Ponce discovered gold in the rivers, sparking his desire to further explore the island. Upon returning to la Espa챰ola, Ponce presented the gold samples he had collected, which were of sufficient quality for the king's purposes. Despite facing opposition and political turmoil, Ponce's determination and exploration efforts were recognized by the king, ultimately leading to his appointment as the governor of the island.|"['1.

Ceron and his friends were told not to bother Ponce or his officers, nor question their actions. They were advised to try to earn their favor. Ponce handed over his duties to Ceron and retired to Cap찼rra, having amassed wealth for future ventures. Shortly after Ponce's return from la Espa챰ola, Guayb찼na fell ill and passed away. The peace between the natives and the Spaniards established by the wise chief Guayb찼na seemed undisturbed. Ponce chose a site for his first settlement, Cap찼rra, where they faced challenges due to the swampy terrain. The settlers moved to Agu찼da due to mosquito troubles. The arrival of the aristocratic Christopher de Soto Mayor stirred tensions. The settlers' actions led to a rebellion among the natives against their harsh treatment and forced labor. The system of forced labor imposed on the natives by the Spanish settlers caused resentment and resistance among the indigenous people.|"['1.

In 1509-'10, the Spaniards distributed Indians as per orders from the metropolis. The Indians rebelled due to these distributions. Fugitives increased, holding secret meetings to plan rebellion. Juan Gonzalez, a soldier, disguised as an Indian to uncover the truth. He learned of a serious uprising and warned Soto Mayor. Guayb찼na planned simultaneous attacks on the Spaniards. Some caciques doubted the plan's success, fearing the Spaniards' weapons. Urayo찼n tested the Spaniards' mortality by drowning a young man. This proved the Spaniards were mortal, leading to open rebellion. Aymam처n captured a boy for a deadly game, but Captain Salazar rescued him, defeating the Indians. This event marked the beginning of the Indians' offensive actions against the Spaniards.|"[""1.

In June 1511, Soto Mayor faced danger when Guayb찼na planned a rebellion. Despite the peril, Soto Mayor bravely led his men towards the Agu찼da settlement. Guayb찼na pursued them, attacking Gonzalez first and then engaging Soto Mayor and his companions near the Yauco River. The fierce battle resulted in the deaths of the Spaniards, who fought valiantly against the enraged natives. Gonzalez, left for dead, managed to reach safety and inform others of the ongoing conflict. Upon receiving the news, Ponce de Le처n sent Captain Miguel del Toro to assist Soto Mayor, only to find the settlement destroyed and their comrades lost. Salazar's arrival at Cap찼rra revealed the dire situation, prompting Ponce to prepare for a bold offensive against Guayb찼na's forces near the Coay첬co River. Despite their small numbers, the Spaniards surprised the natives with a fierce attack, causing them to flee in confusion. Ponce wisely returned to Cap찼rra to tend to his wounded and await reinforcements from la Espa챰ola.|"['1.

The old chroniclers' accounts are doubted for another reason. The Borique챰os proposed an alliance with their enemies, the Caribs, against a common foe, despite the Caribs not suffering as much as the Borique챰os. This suggests a level of foresight and diplomacy that seems unlikely for both groups. It is more plausible that some fleeing Indians from nearby islands joined the Borique챰os after learning of their plans. Ponce de Le처n sent men to scout the Caribs, leading to a battle where the Spaniards emerged victorious. The Borique챰os, under Ponce's leadership, then faced a large Indian force, eventually defeating them after a strategic stand-off. The death of the Carib leader, Guayb찼na, marked the turning point, leading to the eventual subjugation of the Boriqu챕n people. The initial estimates of 600,000 indigenous people on the island are now considered exaggerated by modern historians.|"[""1.

Mr. Brau argues for reducing the estimated population of the island to about 16,000. However, this estimation is flawed because the knowledge of only a part of the island was available. Ponce's conquest was limited to certain areas, and it is likely that there were other regions with local leaders who did not take part in the conflicts. Brau's reasons for the reduction are valid: the island's small size would struggle to sustain a larger population, historical battles involved fewer warriors than expected, and only 5,500 natives were recorded after organized resistance. The mistreatment of natives led to rebellion and forced labor. The distribution of the indigenous people among various individuals and institutions further depleted their numbers. This historical pattern of exploitation and mistreatment led to a significant decline in the native population over time.|"[""1.

The king's favorites in the city aimed to enrich themselves by obtaining grants of Indians and sending their stewards to oversee them. Unfortunately, the Indians assigned in this way were often the most mistreated. Diego Columbus suspended Ponce as governor and sent the Admiral's nominees as prisoners to the city after becoming the permanent governor. The king's Indian council decided that the nomination of governors and mayors over the islands discovered by Christopher Columbus belonged to his son. As a result, Ceron and Diaz were reinstated in their roles. The king also instructed to build a chapel and a monastery for Franciscan friars. Measures were advised to keep the Caribs away from the island. The king desired the well-being of the natives, but the pressure for gold led to their suffering.|"[""1.

Until 1512, the Indians in Spain were restless and subordinate. In July 1513, efforts were made to improve their conditions through the Ordinances of Valladolid. These laws aimed to treat the natives well, assign them land for farming, and raise livestock for food. Masters were to provide housing and teach Christian beliefs. Children were to be baptized, and polygamy was forbidden. The encomenderos were to ensure fair treatment and education, including teaching one in every forty to read. The friars in convents were to educate boys serving as pages. Pregnant women were to be cared for and not overworked. The ordinances aimed to protect the Indians' rights and culture. Despite these efforts, many of the laws were not enforced, leading to continued struggles for the indigenous people.|"['1.

"After receiving various royal favors before leaving Seville, Diaz and his wife were granted permission to wear silk clothing and relocate their 40 Indigenous people from la Espa챰ola to San Juan. The king's instructions emphasized maintaining friendly relations with Ponce and supporting those who had helped suppress a revolt. However, Diaz and Ceron disregarded these orders, favoring their own followers over the conquerors. This led to protests and complaints, resulting in the appointment of Commander Moscoso. Moscoso's actions further aggravated the situation, prompting the Admiral to intervene personally. Ponce, seeking the legendary Fountain of Youth in Bemini, set sail on an expedition in March 1512.

In 1515, Ponce de Le처n set sail with three ships to conquer the Caribs. Landing in Guadeloupe, his men were ambushed by the natives, resulting in casualties and women being abducted. Ponce's response was brief, promising retribution. Discontent among the Spaniards in the Leeward Islands led to disorder and protests, exacerbated by the redistribution of Indians. The unrest culminated in a revolt by native chiefs and frequent attacks on Spanish settlements. Governor Mendoza's punitive expedition resulted in the death of a native chief but failed to quell the resistance. The Spanish population, divided into factions, struggled for power, with Ponce's party holding significant influence. The expedition to Florida and Ponce's new title as Adelantado further solidified his authority among his peers.|"[""1.

In 1515, Ponce, appointed perpetual prefect, faced challenges in redistributing Indians due to a prior delegation by Sancho Velasquez. Ponce was condemned to pay 1,352 gold pesos for his administration shortcomings. The state of San Juan was deemed tyrannical, with reports of abuse and injustices. Velasquez was accused of misconduct, including unfair Indian distribution and gambling. The island was divided into two jurisdictions, with Cap찼rra and San German as capitals. Settlements were scarce due to Carib threats. Ferdinand ordered forts' construction and arms provision for security. The island became a bishopric in 1513, but the prelate faced opposition. Ponce's reappointment aimed to restore order and combat Carib attacks, but challenges persisted.|"['1.

In October 1515, Haro, the treasurer, reported to the king about Ponce's discord-sowing actions in Puerto Rico. This led to accusations against Velasquez, causing turmoil even after Ferdinand's death. Cardinal Jimenez de Cisneros, the Regent of Spain, held immense power as Grand Inquisitor. Accusations continued, leading to the suspension of Diego Columbus and the appointment of a triumvirate of friars to govern. Bishop Manso returned armed with Inquisitor powers, and Velasquez faced judgment, dying in prison. The frequent changes in government fueled party strife. The relocation of the capital to a healthier islet sparked further discord. Epidemics, including smallpox, afflicted both Spaniards and Indians, leading to devastating consequences.|"[""1.

In the past, the island faced various challenges. Ants destroyed yucca plants, vital for making bread, and invaded homes, causing pain to adults and endangering children. Saint Saturnine was chosen to help, and the pests vanished. Later, a worm attacked yucca, and after choosing Saint Patrick, the island was saved again. Hurricanes in 1515 and 1526 caused deaths and destruction, leaving many poor. Governor Lando reported storms in 1530 and 1537, leading to widespread devastation and poverty.

The attacks by Caribs from nearby islands made the colony's survival even more uncertain. Whenever a new settlement was established, they would swoop down, killing Spaniards, destroying plantations, and abducting locals. In 1520, news of Cortez's exploits in Mexico reached San Juan, inspiring the old adventurer Ponce to action. Despite facing fierce resistance and losing men in encounters with natives, Ponce's attempts to settle Florida failed. The emperor granted his son the title of Adelantado of Florida and Bemini after Ponce's death. Unconquered Indians in other parts of the island remained free, with some fleeing to neighboring islands. Retaliatory attacks on Spanish settlements were common, prompting punitive expeditions that only temporarily subdued the unrest. The Carib invasions were driven by a thirst for revenge and a desire to reclaim their homeland from the Spaniards.|"[""1.

Ponce's defeat in Guadeloupe emboldened the Caribs, who started attacking settlements more frequently and in larger numbers. Five years after Dagu찼o's destruction, a new settlement by the Humac찼o River was thriving but faced the same fate. In 1520, Carib warriors attacked San Juan, killing Christians and Indians, burning houses, and taking captives. The attacks continued, with a major one in 1521 on the south coast and another in 1529 near the capital. The settlers urged for reinforcements to protect against the Carib raids.

In 1531, two brigantines were constructed in Seville and shipped to the island. However, they were unfit for service. The governor and officers urgently requested light-draft vessels for defense against the Caribs, who continuously attacked. An expedition was sent in 1534, led by Joan de Ayucar, resulting in the burning of villages and taking prisoners. Subsequent expeditions in 1536 and 1539 aimed to combat the Caribs. The Caribs retaliated, causing unrest in San Juan. By the late 16th century, French and English forces occupied Carib strongholds, leading to the decline of the Caribs in the West Indies. The islands were initially inhabited by peaceful races driven out by the warlike Caribs, who invaded from the continent.|['1.

The consequences of natural disasters and invasions led to the rapid decline of the indigenous population. In 1515, Sede챰o noted that the Indians were few and not serving well. Many had perished due to hunger caused by a hurricane. Efforts to prevent their extinction were championed by Father Bartolom챕 Las Casas, who denounced the mistreatment of natives. A triumvirate of friars was appointed in 1517 to govern the islands, ensuring the Indians were protected. Despite opposition, the emperor granted freedoms to the Indians in 1520, acknowledging their birthright to freedom. Licentiate Figueroa raised concerns about sustaining the island without 'encomiendas,' while others exploited the situation for personal gain. Despite these challenges, efforts to save the remaining Indians continued until it was too late to prevent their decline. The emperor's decree in 1543 aimed to grant freedom to the surviving Indians to allow them to thrive.|"['1.

During the colonization period, the indigenous people of Puerto Rico, known as the Boriqu챕n Indians, faced harsh treatment and exploitation by the Spanish settlers. Despite attempts to liberate them, the Indians were still treated as slaves as late as 1550. Governor Vallejo reported irregularities in their treatment, with many being sold in secret. By 1582, only a few remained due to diseases, mistreatment, and escape to other islands. The extinction of the natives led to the abandonment of gold mining and cultivation of crops like ginger and cotton. Hurricanes and Carib attacks further devastated the island, leading many to flee to seek fortunes in Peru. The Governor imposed strict measures to prevent mass emigration, fearing the complete depopulation of the island. The riches of Peru enticed many settlers to leave, causing concern for the island's defense against foreign invaders.|"['1.

The African slave trade in la Espa챰ola started alongside the decline of the indigenous population. In 1502, Juan Sanchez was allowed to bring five caravels of slaves duty-free, leading to tensions as slaves escaped to the mountains, causing unrest among the remaining indigenous people. San Juan required special permission for slave imports, with limited allowances for individual personal servants. In 1513, a royal decree permitted the general introduction of African slaves, but at a cost of two ducats per head. Despite attempts to regulate the trade, the scarcity and high prices of slaves in San Juan persisted until 1530. The incursions of French and English privateers added to the island's troubles, with attacks on settlements like San German. The political landscape in Europe, particularly the rivalry between Charles V of Spain and Francis I of France, further fueled conflicts that impacted Spanish territories in the New World.|['1.

In 1540, following an attack, a fort was ordered by the sovereign for San German, with Juan de Castellanos, the treasurer, appointed as its commander. The treasurer expressed the challenges faced due to lack of funds and resources. Work on the fort began in June 1540. By February 1543, more progress was made with the employment of labor at two and a half pesos per month. The bishop highlighted the need for the fort to protect the inhabitants from French privateers. However, by 1554, French ships attacked, leading to the downfall of San German. Despite the challenges, the capital showed signs of development with completed structures and a growing population. The island's connection to the mainland was strained, with no ships visiting for two years. The people of San Juan turned to agriculture for sustenance, with the return of Juan Castellanos and other colonists in 1535. Yet, the presence of opportunistic figures like Sede챰o added to the turmoil of the times, with a history of controversies and exploits in the region.|['1.

In the early 16th century, there was unrest in the Spanish colonies due to ambitious individuals like Sede챰o, who defied orders and amassed troops for unauthorized conquests. This caused strife between the colonists and government officials. The death of Sede챰o in 1538 did not alleviate the tension. The island faced a mass exodus of settlers due to discontent with the governance of Lando. The imperial ministers, tired of the constant complaints and self-serving requests from the island, decided to change the governance system. The Admiral lost the power to appoint governors, and an elective system was introduced, which was met with mixed reactions. Some believed that governors should be residents, while others argued for outsiders to prevent favoritism. The new system faced challenges, with calls for a supreme judge due to the rise in crime and dissatisfaction with the local authorities. The need for a competent and impartial governor was stressed to prevent further unrest and abandonment of the island.|"['1.

In 1542, a law was passed due to a single person's request, causing chaos on the island. This law declared the pastures, woods, and waters as public property, despite the pastures being considered private property due to land grants by the crown. This led to conflict between the landless and the landowners, resulting in violence and civil unrest. Despite objections from the ecclesiastical chapter, city attorney, and crown officers, the law was enforced. The appointed governor faced threats and violence, with the need for protection from the insubordinate residents. Changes in governance continued, with alternating systems of appointing governors and electing alcaldes. The island faced attacks from French and Carib forces, causing distress and economic decline. The island's defenses were poorly maintained, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. The loyalty of the inhabitants and fortunate circumstances were crucial in preserving the island's Spanish colonial status.|"['1.

"In 1527, an English ship sailed near San Juan, la Mona, and la Espa챰ola, but the Spanish officials ignored warnings despite requests for defense. After a French privateer attacked San German in 1537, Blas de Villasante purchased ordnance for San Juan's protection. The island's vulnerability led to calls for fortifications in 1529 and 1530. Construction on the first fort began around 1533 with stone suggested for durability. By 1540, the fort was completed, serving as a governor's residence. Criticized for inefficiency, a battery was built at ""the Morro."" San Juan lacked artillery until 1541, prompting urgent appeals for defense.

During the late 16th century, Francis Drake emerged as a notorious English pirate who targeted Spanish ships and colonies. His daring exploits and intense animosity towards the Spaniards made him a feared figure. Drake's early experiences, including a narrow escape from the Spaniards in 1567, fueled his lifelong vendetta against them. Despite England and Spain being officially at peace, Drake saw the Spaniards as treacherous enemies. In 1570, he raided Spanish vessels in the West Indies, seizing valuable goods. Drake's audacious attempt to capture Nombre de Dios in 1572 was thwarted by a wound, but he later succeeded in acquiring treasure from the Spanish. Despite accusations of piracy, Queen Elizabeth supported Drake due to her shared animosity towards Spain. Drake's plans to attack Spanish possessions in the West Indies in 1595 were foiled by administrative errors and delays, giving the Spanish time to prepare. A fortunate event involving the Spanish fleet in 1595 helped prevent an attack on the island of San Juan.|"[""1.

A few days later, news arrived on the island about England's preparations through a dispatch boat. Governor Juarez, General Sancho, and the local infantry commander decided to sink a dismasted ship and another vessel in the harbor entrance channel. Defenses were set up to prevent enemy landings. Pedro Tello de G첬zman's 5 Spanish frigates arrived to embark treasure for Spain, but had encountered English ships and retreated to Puerto Rico. The island's defenses were strengthened by Tello's frigates, distributing men and anchoring in the bay. The forces were prepared for resistance with shore defenses, forts, and ships. The English fleet approached but faced strong resistance, leading them to retreat. Launches attacked Tello's frigates, resulting in casualties on both sides. The English fleet attempted to enter the harbor but was deterred by the sunken ships. Eventually, the English fleet left, realizing the island's strong defenses.|"[""1.

Two days later, news arrived from Arecibo that the English fleet had passed by. A messenger sent to San German returned six days later with the report that the enemy had been there for four days, restocking on supplies before sailing southward on December 9th. Drake later regretted abandoning the conquest of Puerto Rico when he found out he missed the opportunity to add 2,000,000 pesos in gold and silver to the Queen's treasury. Puerto Rico and the treasure were now safe. Two years later, another English fleet with troops under Lord George Cumberland arrived. Governor Antonio Mosquera bravely defended the island, but the English, outnumbering them, took over the capital and forts. However, an epidemic struck the English, forcing them to leave the island. The century ended with Puerto Rico in turmoil, with little population, no education, and a struggling economy.|"['1.

"In 1582, Holland broke free from Spanish rule and became the ""United Provinces of Netherland."" Spain, weary of the long war, agreed to a 12-year truce in 1609. During this period, the United Provinces gained absolute independence. However, in 1621, King Philip IV of Spain resumed hostilities. France and England supported the Provinces with funds to raise troops. Dutch merchants also sent privateers to attack Spanish and Portuguese colonies. These privateers raided Brazil, San Salvador, Lima, and Callao in 1624. In 1625, Puerto Rico faced a new threat as 17 enemy ships appeared near the port. The governor, Juan de Haro, prepared the city for defense, distributing arms and ammunition. The people and garrison readied themselves for a potential siege, despite facing challenges with their artillery and limited food supplies. The enemy demanded surrender, but the governor refused, standing firm in defense of the fort."|"['1.

On the 4th of October, the governor commanded 80 men to launch a sortie in three groups. The following day, Captain Juan de Amezquita led another sortie. Between these actions, surprises, night assaults, and cannon fire continued until October 21st. On that day, Bowdoin threatened to burn the city if an agreement wasn't reached. The governor responded, showing Spanish resilience. Bowdoin carried out his threat, burning over a hundred houses, the bishop's palace, and city archives. To halt the destruction, Captains Amezquita and Botello led a sortie of 200 men, driving the Hollanders away. Discouraged, the Hollanders abandoned the siege on November 2nd, leaving a stranded ship and over 400 dead. Puerto Rico's successful defense inspired hope for future safety, despite Spain's struggles in Europe. Spain's power declined due to conflicts with other European nations, leaving the colonies vulnerable to privateers and pirates.|"[""1.

During the 17th century, the Antilles became a hub for buccaneers and filibusters who preyed on Spanish possessions. These lawless men, hailing from Europe, wreaked havoc in the Caribbean. The buccaneers, named after a Carib word for their cooking method, were ruthless and recognized no authority except force. One infamous figure was l'Olonais, a Frenchman known for his brutality. Sir Henry Morgan, a Welsh pirate, terrorized Spanish colonies with his inhumane acts. The buccaneers settled in the Windward Islands, establishing pirate havens. Despite Spanish attempts to expel them, the buccaneers persisted, occupying various islands. In 1630, Spain's fleet clashed with the pirates but failed to dislodge them. The struggle continued, with the pirates maintaining control until the late 17th century.|"['1.

Around 1665, the French Governor of Tortuga, Beltr찼n Ogeron, aimed to conquer Puerto Rico. He arrived near the coast with 3 ships, but a hurricane intervened, stranding the ships and leading to the capture of the Frenchmen. Ogeron, believed to have drowned, escaped with his ship's surgeon during the march to the capital. They returned to Tortuga, preparing for another invasion. In 1768, an English fleet led by the Earl of Estren demanded San Juan's surrender but was wrecked by a hurricane. In 1762, Admiral Rodney took control of French colonies, while Admiral Pocock captured Havana in 1762. The signing of a peace treaty in 1763 averted an attack on Puerto Rico. Charles III of Spain joined France in a war against England in 1778, lasting until 1783, sparing Puerto Rico from attacks.|"['1.

In February 1797, Admiral Henry Harvey led 60 ships with 6,000 to 7,000 troops to Trinidad, encountering little Spanish resistance. The fleet then moved to San Juan, where the Spanish garrison was well-prepared with a formidable defense. Despite being outnumbered, the Spanish forces, including 200 veterans, 4,000 militiamen, and others armed with lances and machetes, held their ground. Abercrombie's 3,000 troops landed at Cangrejos and demanded surrender, but Governor Castro refused. Skirmishes and encounters followed for thirteen days until the English unexpectedly reembarked, leaving behind spiked guns and supplies. The people credited the Virgin for the deliverance, but the English retreat was mainly due to the strength of the fortifications. The siege's end was celebrated with a Te Deum, and the city's officials were commended. Despite the retreat, the island remained blockaded, causing hardships for the inhabitants.

During the early 1800s, England's navy and privateers relentlessly chased French and Spanish ships near Puerto Rico. British privateers seized a French frigate in Salinas and captured Spanish ships. In Ponce, an English frigate captured a French privateer and rescued a British vessel. Even Haitian privateers, backed by the British, raided French and Spanish ships. Governor Castro struggled to defend the island due to lack of funds and arms. Puerto Ricans remained loyal to Spain, resisting calls for independence unlike other colonies. In 1819 and 1829, Spanish forces repelled Colombian insurgents attempting landings. The century saw Spain losing most of its colonies, leaving only parts of Hispaniola and the Antilles. Puerto Rico, once neglected, faced financial mismanagement and piracy. Agriculture stagnated, and the island's potential remained untapped.|"['1.

His Excellency Alexander O'Reilly, who arrived in the Antilles on a mission from Charles IV, described the living conditions of the people in Puerto Rico in 1765. He noted that there were only two schools on the entire island, and few outside the capital knew how to read. The inhabitants measured time based on changes in government, hurricanes, and other events. Many did not understand basic measurements like a league. The population lived in simple homes, with little furniture and open structures. They survived on abundant fish, crops like bananas and maize, and few possessions beyond a hammock and cooking pot. Despite the fertile land, there were suggestions to increase the population by distributing unoccupied lands to various groups. The report highlighted the lack of agricultural knowledge and basic protection from the sun. The political turmoil in Europe during that time affected the colonies, with Spain facing challenges due to its sympathies with France and subsequent war declarations.|"[""1.

During a turbulent period in history, King Charles IV of Spain, out of fear for his safety, aligned with the enemies of his family. This alliance led to Spain becoming an adversary of England, resulting in conflicts like the bombardment of Cadiz and the loss of Trinidad. As Napoleon's power grew, Spain reluctantly followed his commands, even against their own interests. The Spanish fleet suffered heavy losses in battles against England, further weakening the nation. Internal strife ensued as suspicions arose about Napoleon's intentions. Ultimately, a revolution led by figures like Rafael Diego and General O'Daly in Puerto Rico forced King Ferdinand VII to swear to uphold the constitution of 1812. This period marked a struggle for independence and constitutional rights, highlighting the resilience of the Spanish people against oppressive rulers.|"[""1.

"During the second constitutional period in Puerto Rico, the island was divided into 7 judicial districts, and tablets displaying the constitutional laws were placed in town squares. This sparked a sense of patriotism, leading to the formation of groups like ""the Lovers of Science"" and ""the Liberals, Lovers of their Country."" However, progress was hindered in 1823 when news of the fall of the constitutional regime reached the island after electing deputies to Cortes. Despite efforts to promote population growth and economic development through liberal laws, political importance remained small. The decree aimed to attract industrious foreigners by granting them land, exempting them from taxes, and offering other privileges. These measures encouraged the influx of skilled individuals, benefiting the local economy.

In 1825, Lieutenant-General Miguel de la Torre, the island's governor, brought positive changes to Puerto Rico. He stopped corruption, leading to increased public revenue. Troops and public workers were paid, debts were reduced, and confidence was restored. The era of prosperity attracted wealthy citizens from other countries, improving society. The aristocracy consisted of Spanish officers and wealthy creoles. Merchants and soldiers were transitory, while tradesmen were mostly locals. The island also had convicts who stayed, impacting society negatively. Puerto Rico faced a reputation for crime due to convicts mixing with the population. Horse-racing and cock-fighting were popular pastimes. Schools were scarce, and youths were sent abroad for education. A militia of 7,000 men was formed to encourage industry and social interaction, improving the quality of life for the people.|['1.

In 1830, the French Revolution inspired Spanish liberals. They hoped for change after the expulsion of Charles X. The liberals tried to invade Spain from France, but faced persecution. The king's death led to a more open government under the queen. Civil war erupted due to Don Carlos' claims. In 1836, a revolution reinstated the 1812 constitution. Political parties struggled for power. Isabel II became queen in 1843, leading to a tug of war between Progressists and Moderates. O'Donnell and Canovas del Castillo steered Spain in 1865. Amadeo briefly ruled before a republic was established in 1873. Disagreements over autonomy led to chaos. General Pavia's coup d'챕tat in 1874 restored order. The political turmoil in Spain affected Puerto Rico, with frequent changes in governance and a lack of focus on education and progress.|"['1. What event inspired Spanish liberals in 1830?\nA.

Gambling has been a prominent vice among the common people, encouraged by authorities who believed it kept them distracted from politics. Cockpits were established in every town, along with carnival games and the feast of San Juan lasting the whole month of June. General Pezuela criticized the people of Puerto Rico as lacking faith and thought, even though he later contributed to their intellectual development. In 1865, gambling was widespread, with a bustling gambling house in the capital. The systematic denigration of the people neutralized efforts by progressive governors. A seditious incident in 1867 led to the banishment of prominent citizens. Economic conditions suffered, with emigration of capital and misery spreading. The 1868 revolution brought positive change, allowing the island to elect representatives. The political education of Puerto Ricans began with the royal decree of 1865, leading to the organization of political parties and orderly elections in 1869.|['1.

In Puerto Rico, a group of individuals, including slaves promised freedom, gathered armed with knives and machetes at a coffee plantation. They declared independence, taking prisoners and forming a new government. The president, Francisco Ramirez, and his team assumed roles in the Provisional Government. Plans were made to march on nearby towns, but many participants lost enthusiasm and returned home. A remaining group led by Commander Rojas marched on Pepino, where a confrontation ensued with loyal militiamen. Shots were fired, resulting in casualties among the liberators. As news of approaching soldiers spread, panic set in, and most of the group dispersed, leaving Rojas and a few officers behind.

As soon as news of the disturbance reached San Juan, the Governor dispatched Lieutenant-Colonel Gamar to pursue the rebels. Rosas and his followers were captured without resistance, while Bruckman and a Venezuelan put up a fight and were unfortunately shot. The reactionists wanted severe punishment for the reform party, but General Pavia, a just man, handed the rebels to the civil court. They were imprisoned in Lares, Arecibo, and Aguadilla, where unsanitary conditions led to an epidemic that claimed the lives of seventy-nine rebels. The trial revealed that reform party members had been falsely accused and imprisoned. Governor Baldrich brought positive changes, allowing political freedom and respecting diverse opinions. The island saw peace during municipal elections, and the Liberal reformists gained representation in the Provincial Deputation.

The Spanish Republic faced challenges with the arrival of Governor Sanz, who suspended constitutional guarantees and persecuted those advocating for progress. The Republic's history was marked by political unrest and economic decline due to outdated trade restrictions, high taxes, and corrupt practices. The island's resources dwindled, businesses suffered, and land values plummeted. Efforts to reform the administration in Cuba and Puerto Rico were hindered by insurrection and failed to address the underlying issues. Despite promises of autonomy and reform, the people's aspirations were unmet, leading to disillusionment with the government. Ultimately, the inability to implement meaningful change contributed to the collapse of the Spanish colonial empire in the region.|"['1.

The decree granting autonomy to Puerto Rico was signed on November 25, 1897. Governor-General Manuel Macias declared the island in a state of war on April 21, 1898. Shortly after, Puerto Rico became part of the United States. Situated in the Atlantic Ocean, Puerto Rico is about 1,420 miles from New York and 1,000 miles from Havana. The island is around 104 miles long and 34 miles wide, with an area of 2,970 square miles. It is known for its fertile land and strategic location for trade. The mountains in Puerto Rico are impressive, with the highest peak, El Yunque, visible from far at sea. The island's valleys are lush and productive, with rivers nourishing the land. The north and south coasts have different landscapes, with the north being rich in cattle and picturesque, while the south is known for its sugar plantations. Puerto Rico has numerous rivers, with some navigable for small boats. The island's natural beauty and resources make it a unique and valuable place in the Caribbean.|['1.

Puerto Rico, an island in the Caribbean, boasts a diverse landscape with rivers flowing into the sea from the northeast to the southeast. The roads, well-constructed during the Spanish rule, were filled with gravel and stones. The island's coast features numerous harbors and bays, providing safe anchorage for ships. The climate in Puerto Rico is tropical, with mountains and running streams contributing to purifying the atmosphere. The island has a varied climate, with the north coast experiencing more rain than the south coast. Despite being a tropical island, Puerto Rico is known for its healthiness and lack of dangerous reptiles. The island was once inhabited by different races, with the Caribs being a warlike and cruel group that invaded from the mainland. The native inhabitants of Puerto Rico had diverse origins, with some possibly descending from a mix of Phoenicians and ancient locals.|"['1.

In the fourth chapter of his history, Friar Abbad describes the people of Boriqu챕n, relying on the writings of various authors. The natives were copper-colored, shorter than Spaniards, with flat noses, wide nostrils, and other distinct features. They were generally lazy and averse to work, only exerting themselves for food, games, and dances. They painted their bodies and wore minimal clothing. Their huts were made of cane, and they used hammocks for furniture. The j챠baros, a significant part of Puerto Rico's population, live in huts made of cane and palm materials, following traditional construction methods. These inhabitants, predominantly of European descent, live in unhygienic conditions, with cramped sleeping quarters and a lack of concern for the future.|['1.

Mr. Francisco del Valle Atil챕s, a respected writer from Puerto Rico, has provided a detailed account of the lives of the rural people. He classifies them into three groups: those near large sugar and coffee plantations working as laborers, small landowners tending their own plots, and wealthier landowners living away from towns. The typical j챠baro is slender, slow, taciturn, and often appears sickly due to poor diet and living conditions. They mainly eat rice, plantains, and beans, leading to a lack of energy and a reliance on tobacco and rum. Despite facing diseases like paludal fever, they show remarkable endurance when motivated. The j챠baro's illiteracy and simple lifestyle are changing with education and improved living standards, offering hope for a brighter future.|"['1.

During the initial period of conquest and colonization, no Spanish women came to this or any other conquered territory. Soldiers, sailors, monks, and explorers did not bring families. As a result, alongside the natives and pure Spaniards, a new population of mixed-race individuals emerged. The offspring of these diverse unions did not inherit the best qualities of their ancestors but often displayed moral decline. The mixing of races led to the creation of groups like mestizos, Eurasians, and mulattoes, where negative traits tended to dominate. Over generations, a fusion of races occurred, resulting in a population with varying skin tones and characteristics. The influence of Spanish, Indian, and African roots is still evident in the people of Puerto Rico today.|['1.

The introduction of African slaves to Puerto Rico solidified the institution of slavery. While King Ferdinand initially ordered rebellious Indians into slavery in 1511, the order was revoked the following year. In contrast, African slaves were deemed perpetual slaves. The Spaniards viewed them as inherently servile beings, regularly sold in Andalusia's markets. Despite Columbus reducing the Indians in la Espa챰ola to slavery, African slaves arrived as early as 1502. Ovando, the governor then, opposed this as the slaves joined rebellious Indians, complicating their control. Special permission was needed to bring slaves to Puerto Rico initially.

During the 18th century, contracts were made for importing slaves to the Antilles. Miguel Uriarte agreed to transport 15,000 slaves to various parts of Spanish America. In 1765, the Car찼cas company was permitted to bring 2,000 slaves to Car찼cas and Maraea챠bo to replace Indians who succumbed to smallpox. Duties on importing slaves to various colonies were replaced by a capitation tax. The company Aguirre, Aristegui & Co. was authorized to supply the Antilles with slaves at a reduced price. The British abolitionists like Wilberforce and Clarkson advocated for the end of the slave trade, leading to its abolition in Great Britain in 1833. Spain agreed to end the slave trade in 1817. Puerto Rico emancipated 31,000 slaves in 1873. Tensions rose between masters and slaves in Puerto Rico due to fears of insurrection. Governor-General Prim issued strict measures against armed resistance by African individuals.|['1.

All statements concerning the exact number of the original inhabitants of this island are largely based on guesswork. When Columbus arrived, he only visited one port and did not interact with the locals. Ponce and his crew only conquered a portion of the island, with no time or interest in studying the population. They focused on counting prisoners rather than the actual population. The estimates made by Abbad, O'Reilly, and others were mere conjecture due to the lack of accurate data. The fate of the indigenous population and their intermarriage with conquerors remains uncertain. Despite efforts to explain the decline of the aboriginal population, there is still much doubt and obscurity. Population numbers recorded by Spanish authorities were likely underreported due to various factors. The island's population growth was mainly attributed to agricultural activities, health benefits, frugal habits, climate, and increased peace and prosperity. The population census conducted in 1860 showed a steady increase in inhabitants over the years, indicating progress and development on the island.|"['1.

The Caribs' invasions, hurricanes in 1530 and 1537, emigration, internal conflicts, and heavy taxes hindered Puerto Rico's early sugar industry. Initially promising, the industry struggled due to royal taxes on sugar. Bishop Bastidas protested this tax in 1544, urging its suspension to aid mill construction. His plea led to the construction of water and horse-powered sugar mills. Despite such efforts, oppressive laws stifled agricultural growth. By 1644, only ginger, hides, and sugar were major exports. Tobacco and cacao cultivation faced challenges, with tobacco laws so strict that selling to foreigners was punishable by death. The cultivation of cacao struggled due to hurricanes, while coffee, coconut palms, and plantains were introduced later. Agriculture statistics in 1776 showed animal husbandry thriving, though the farming methods were criticized for being rudimentary.|"[""1.

The islanders' preference for cultivating low-lying lands due to laziness rather than lack of resources leads to soil depletion, prompting them to move to mountainous areas. Despite ample knowledge, tools, and government support, they shun agriculture, viewing manual labor as degrading. Instead, they focus on low-labor crops like cane, coffee, rice, and tobacco, with sugar cane being a potential main crop. The island's vast agricultural wealth includes various crops, livestock, and produce, valued at millions. The island's prosperity peaked from 1865 to 1872, but a decline ensued due to falling sugar prices, restrictions, and lack of market demand. This led to a state of ruin, with abandoned estates and reduced sugar production, causing widespread economic distress and despair among landowners.|"['1.

In 1813, Puerto Rico faced dire circumstances due to the oppressive practices of the government. Despite pleas from various sectors, little action was taken to alleviate the situation. The Minister of Ultramar in Madrid acknowledged the severity of the issues, but change was slow to come. A writer cautiously hinted at the need for reduced taxes, government spending cuts, and the elimination of monopolies. The island's financial woes were exacerbated by widespread smuggling and corruption in revenue collection. However, in 1813, Alexander Ramirez was appointed to bring about much-needed reforms. He overhauled the administration, improved accounting practices, and encouraged commerce. Under his leadership, Puerto Rico's revenues increased significantly, demonstrating the positive impact of his reforms. Ramirez's success led to his transfer to Cuba, but subsequent administrators in Puerto Rico failed to maintain his progress, leading to a resurgence of financial mismanagement and decline.|"['1.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Puerto Rico faced financial challenges due to its reliance on external funds. The island's people neglected their own resources, leading to extreme poverty when these external funds ceased. The introduction of paper money and emergency currency worsened the situation, causing a 400% depreciation. To combat this, officials introduced uncoined silver pieces to replace the paper money, but this led to speculation and economic instability. By 1857, Puerto Rico finally adopted Spanish national coinage. Despite financial distress, improvements in administrative systems and foreign commerce helped the island's economy. The financial history of Puerto Rico saw fluctuations in revenues, with occasional surpluses misused for external ventures. Various decrees and ordinances aimed to stabilize the economy, with reforms in financial administration and tax collection.|"[""1.

During the 1800s, Puerto Rico faced economic challenges due to high export duties that harmed agriculture. The Official Chamber of Commerce struggled to reform tariffs and exchange Mexican coins for Peninsular money. The lack of interest from commercial houses and Spain worsened the situation. Education also suffered, with few schools and limited subjects taught. Only ecclesiastical institutions provided Latin and philosophy education. Not until the 1820s did intellectual life improve, with efforts to establish primary schools and promote literacy. However, political changes brought setbacks, plunging the island back into intellectual darkness. Clergy-led education dominated for two decades until Bishop Pedro Gutierrez de Cos founded the Conciliar Seminary in 1831. Despite challenges, efforts by individuals like Rufo Fernandez to offer free lectures on physics and chemistry showed a glimmer of progress in education.|['1.

In the past, efforts were made to enhance education in Puerto Rico. Fray Angel, the rector of the seminary, proposed adding physics and chemistry courses to the curriculum. However, this idea was rejected by ecclesiastical authorities who believed that such scientific studies were unnecessary for students focusing on ecclesiastical sciences. Despite this setback, the Economic Society of Friends of the Country, established in 1813, played a crucial role in advancing education on the island. This society aimed to promote moral and material progress by establishing schools and offering classes in various subjects. Over time, more schools were opened, but illiteracy remained a significant issue among the population. The lack of access to books and educational materials, coupled with restrictions on learning, contributed to widespread ignorance.|"[""1.

The idea of public libraries in Puerto Rico did not emerge until the mid-19th century, unlike other colonies that had already embraced intellectual progress after gaining independence. Early collegiate libraries in the capital date back to the 16th century, with the Dominican friars and Bishop Don Bernardo de Valbuena establishing significant collections. Unfortunately, these libraries were destroyed during the siege of San Juan in 1625. Subsequent efforts by Bishop Pedro Gutierres de Cos and the Royal Academy of Belles-Lettres aimed to promote education through libraries, but disagreements led to closures and transfers of collections. Thanks to Governor Charles H. Allen and Commissioner Martin G. Brumbaugh, the first American free library was established, followed by public libraries like the one founded by Don Ramon Santaella in 1880. Today, Puerto Rico boasts several libraries, including the Puerto Rican Atheneum Library, the Casino Espa챰ol library, and the Provincial Institute of Secondary Education's pedagogical collection.|"['1.

In Puerto Rico, there are various libraries in cities and towns, including private collections like Don Fernando Juncos' in San Juan with 15,000 volumes. The desire for knowledge led to the establishment of libraries like the one in Ponce in 1894. Despite the lack of resources and poor conditions, efforts were made to promote intellectual growth. Since the American occupation, new libraries have emerged, like the San Juan Free Library, funded by Andrew Carnegie. The island's history with the press dates back to 1807 with the Official Gazette. Even with early restrictions, the periodicals flourished, fostering discussions on politics and society. Over time, regulations eased, allowing for more publications.

In Catholic countries, there are two main types of clergy: the regular clergy, which includes monastic orders, and the secular clergy, which is not bound by monastic rules. The regular clergy, such as the Dominicans and Franciscans, operate under the authority of their superiors, while the secular clergy work under bishops. When the Pope learned of the discovery of the new world by Columbus, he granted the monks the right to administer parishes and collect tithes, a privilege previously held only by the secular clergy. This led to competition between the Dominicans and Franciscans, especially in Puerto Rico, where the Dominicans gained more influence. Over time, the clergy faced challenges, including demands for tithes and disputes over wealth. Eventually, in 1757, the privilege of collecting tithes was revoked, and in 1835, the government expropriated the property of the regular clergy. Despite promises of compensation, the clergy never received full payment, and the orders eventually disappeared from the island.|['1.

In 1511, the first head of the secular clergy in Puerto Rico was nominated. The Catholic princes asked Pope Julius II to establish it as a bishopric. Alonzo Manso, a respected man at court, was recommended as the first prelate. The Pope approved, designating the entire island as the diocese. Over time, the diocese grew to encompass vast territories from the Orinoco to the Amazon and from Guiana to Bogot찼. In 1791, the diocese of Guiana was created, leaving Puerto Rico and Vieques as the original one. The first bishop, Alonzo Manso, faced opposition due to dissension and strife. His successor, Rodrigo Bastidas, was known for his capacity, virtue, and benevolence. Subsequent bishops like Friar Diego de Salamanca and Nicolas Bamos contributed to the diocese's growth. By 1842, the secular clergy had accumulated significant wealth and assets.|['1.

Queen Isabel II of Spain, under the guidance of the Spanish Monarchy's Constitution, along with Regent Baldomero Espartero, announces the Cortes' decree. According to Article I, all properties of the secular clergy are considered national properties. Additionally, Article III states that all estates of the clergy are to be put up for sale. Despite the law's approval, Espartero's support waned due to his adoption of progressist principles, leading to his downfall in 1843. Bishop Manso's arrival in Puerto Rico in 1513 revealed a state of anarchy. He was later granted Inquisitorial powers to combat prevalent immorality. The Inquisition's presence in Puerto Rico involved the burning and punishment of delinquents, with the Inquisition building still standing in 1647. The Inquisition's records were destroyed, and its actions remain a suppressed part of Puerto Rico's history.

In the early 16th century, the Spanish monarchy was shaken by political unrest. King Ferdinand VII was dethroned by conservative forces, leading to a wave of oppressive measures. The Cortes, a legislative body, and the Constitution were disregarded. Deputies who supported liberalism were exiled, imprisoned, or killed. The press was censored, religious institutions like the Inquisition were reinstated, and priestly influence dominated society. Meanwhile, the establishment of Spanish settlements followed a similar pattern. Gold was a crucial factor in site selection, with forts built for protection against hostile natives. Churches were erected for divine favor, and smelting houses were constructed to process gold. The first Spanish settlement in Puerto Rico, Cap찼rra, was established in 1508. Governor Ponce de Le처n played a key role in this endeavor, following instructions from King Ferdinand to exploit gold resources and develop the island.|"[""1.

"In the early 16th century, a young aristocrat named Christopher Soto Mayor, known as ""the Handsome,"" ventured to the Indies. He held a permit to trade in captive Indians and was appointed high constable by Ponce, a Spanish explorer. Unfortunately, the settlement they established was short-lived, destroyed by a native uprising in 1511. Diego Columbus suggested rebuilding the town, named San German, near the bay of Guayanilla. This new settlement became a vital port for Spanish ships heading to P찼ria. Despite facing attacks by French privateers, San German flourished until 1554 when it was razed. In 1570, Governor Francisco Solis founded a new town on the southwest coast, incorporating remnants of the original San German. This town, now known as San German, grew steadily, with 50 residents by 1626."|"['1.

During the next five years, the gold production rapidly decreased in Puerto Rico. The Indians who mined the gold either escaped or perished due to tempests and epidemics that ravaged the land. The Caribs and French pirates further devastated the region, prompting many to flee to Mexico or Peru. By 1534, Governor Lando lamented the depopulated state of the capital, fearing a small group could easily conquer it. Progress was seen when the inhabitants turned to cultivating sugar cane, but the population remained sparse with only 130 citizens in San Juan by 1556. In 1595, the English under Drake nearly seized San Juan, saved only by Spanish frigates. The island faced continuous threats, with only 330 men available for defense during a Dutch siege in 1625. By 1759, Puerto Rico had 18 new settlements, showing signs of growth with over 4,500 men capable of military service.|['1.

In the early 16th century, Spanish settlers established the settlement of Loiza along the river, but it met a tragic fate due to Indian attacks. The cacique Cacim찼r was killed by Sancho Ar찼ngo, leading to a vengeful attack by Yaureib처, resulting in the destruction of the settlement. Among the casualties were Pedro Mexia and his Indian companion Louisa. The settlers engaged in gold prospecting, with Indians doing the labor. The mountains of Puerto Rico were rich in gold, but proper exploration was hindered by Indian uprisings and lack of interest from the governors. The first samples of gold were found in rivers like Manatuab처n and C처a. The gold mining efforts in the early years yielded substantial revenues for the Spanish crown. Governor Bravo de Rivero attempted to establish the settlement of Fajardo on the east coast, but progress was slow due to illicit trade activities and lack of industry among the inhabitants.|['1.

In 1515, a new discovery of gold-rich earth was reported to the king by Sancho Velasquez, the treasurer. He described how gold deposits were found in rivers and streams near San German. The settlers there were able to extract significant amounts of gold, with the king's share amounting to thousands of pesos. The yearly gold output fluctuated but remained steady for several years until the placers started to deplete. Some new gold deposits were found, but the scarcity of gold became a growing concern. Besides the rivers mentioned, many others in the Luquillo mountains were also believed to contain gold. Silver was also discovered in some lead ore veins, but the lack of expertise in smelting hindered further extraction. The reports highlighted the challenges faced by the workers and the diminishing gold resources on the island.|['1.

The memoirs and documents of Juan Bautista Mu챰oz detail the value in gold pesos of bullion and pearls sent to Spain from the island of San Juan de Puerto Rico between 1509 and 1536. The total produce remitted to Spain over these years is recorded as follows: In 1509, 8,975 gold pesos; in 1510, 2,645 gold pesos; in 1511, 10,000 gold pesos; in 1512, 3,043 gold pesos; in 1513, 27,291 gold pesos; and so on until 1536. The total output for this period was 1,389,705 gold pesos, equivalent to $4,169,115 in Spanish coin today. The region's tropical latitudes are known for the birth of hurricanes. These storms, like the great hurricane of 1780, have wreaked havoc on the West Indies, causing immense destruction to life and property, with entire towns and fleets lost to their fury. The aboriginal inhabitants had ways to predict these catastrophic events, including changes in the atmosphere, the behavior of animals, and other natural signs.|['1.

Puerto Rico, a beautiful island in the Caribbean, has faced the wrath of hurricanes more than 20 times throughout history. The devastation caused by these hurricanes is well-documented, with four particularly standing out for their terrible impact. The hurricanes of Santa Ana in 1825, Los Angeles in 1837, San Narciso in 1867, and San Ciriaco in 1899 wreaked havoc on the island. The first recorded mention of a hurricane in Puerto Rico dates back to August 8, 1515, when the crown officers reported the loss of many Indians due to sickness caused by the tempest. Over the centuries, these powerful storms have destroyed homes, plantations, and livelihoods, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.

In 1818 and 1814, two hurricanes struck on July 23rd, affecting Yauco and San German severely. The Dario Econ처mico of August 11, 1814, detailed the aftermath. On July 26, 1825, Hurricane Santa Ana ravaged Patillas, Maunab처, Yabuc처a, and other towns, causing significant damage and casualties. The San Felipe hurricane of August 23, 1871, had no specific details available. In 1899, Hurricane San Ciriaco caused immense devastation, with excessive rainfall leading to floods and over 2,500 drowning deaths. The United States aided in relief efforts, distributing millions of rations. The West Indian Islands face frequent calamities from July to October, with unpredictable weather patterns. Despite the destruction, nature's resilience allows for rapid recovery, with green landscapes returning swiftly after tempests.

The widely accepted theory initially suggested that two distinct races inhabited the West Indian Archipelago at the time of its discovery. The larger Antilles and the smaller islands to the north were believed to be home to the Guaycures, a group allegedly driven from Florida by the Seminoles. The Guaycures were described as peaceful, hospitable, and fond of dancing and singing, making them vulnerable to Spanish conquest. Another race was said to have originated from the south, descending from the Orinoco and spreading to the lesser Antilles. Evidence supporting the south-continental origin of the Caribs includes Venezuelan hieroglyphics and the work of Mr. Aristides Rojas. The Caribs were known for their ferocity and influence over a vast territory. Various theories exist about the Caribs' origin, with some suggesting a connection to the Guaran챠 family.

"The belief that the Caribs were cannibals is based solely on the accounts of Columbus' companions during his second voyage. When they landed in Guadeloupe, they discovered human bones and skulls in abandoned huts. No concrete evidence of cannibalism was ever found beyond this initial discovery. The Spaniards' imaginations ran wild upon seeing what they believed to be remains of devoured individuals. However, this belief was likely fueled by the era's widespread gullibility. Even Columbus himself, in a letter to Santangel, expressed disbelief in encountering any ""human monsters"" on the islands. Father Bartolom챕 de las Casas and other reputable sources contradicted the notion of Carib cannibalism, suggesting it was a misconception. Humboldt and Sir Robert Schomburgh also dismissed the idea, describing the Caribs as a peaceful and organized society with no evidence of such practices. Their culture involved unique customs, such as using different languages based on gender and a belief in two spirits. The Caribs were skilled in crafting tools, canoes, and pottery, and their language had Italian-like sounds."|"[""1.

Father Rochefort, a Jesuit, mentions that the Caribs have changed from their virtuous ancestors due to the negative influence of Europeans. The Europeans mistreated the Caribs, broke promises, plundered villages, and committed immoral acts, leading the Caribs to adopt vices like lying and betrayal. Father Dutertre notes that before European contact, the Caribs were content, healthy, and honest. They had no theft in their society. The French missionaries' attempts to convert them failed due to the negative impressions left by the Europeans' cruel actions. The Caribs defended their homes fiercely and preferred suicide over slavery. By the late 18th century, the few remaining Caribs on St. Vincent, known as black Caribs, were absorbed by French colonists. The author's visit to the region revealed the ruins of Jesuit-Guarani missions, destroyed by the Brazilians. The history of Puerto Rico has been studied by native writers, providing valuable insights into the island's past.|"['1.
