The kind-hearted merchant shouted loudly but the friends slept deeply, unaware even if he was close by. Eventually, he gave up and returned to the boat. The sailors rowed swiftly towards the Relief ship. Mr. Yard watched the coast they left behind. On the ship's deck, he used a spy-glass and spotted a group of Indians on the beach. The ship sailed northward, leaving the rescue scene behind. Tim, Elwood, and Howard slept through the day. Howard woke at sunset, alarmed by the danger approaching - a dozen Indians searching for plunder. The boys, terrified, saw the Indians on the beach, appearing like giants against the setting sun.

Tim signaled his friends to approach without making a sound. The fire, once bright, was now dim. The aged Indian, with long gray hair, sat hunched over.

Howard had a sudden idea. He took off some brass buttons from his coat and gave them to Tim. Their host's eyes lit up, like a child seeing a desired toy. He stood up, walked towards them, and threw the buttons into Tim's lap. The native then stood up and gestured for them to follow him outside. Once there, he pointed east, nodded, and swept his arm. Elwood walked in the indicated direction to confirm their friend's message. He nodded, indicating it was safest to leave promptly in that direction. As they journeyed, they reached a hilly area close to the sea, barren and lacking vegetation. The climate turned chilly and foggy due to the mountains. They decided to head to Salinas Valley for safety, seeking food and weapons. They found the valley like a paradise with abundant fruit. The valley was surrounded by towering mountains with diverse trees, and the climate was drier but more pleasant than the coast.|"['1.

In the Salinas Valley, the lush vegetation amazed the travelers. Wild oats and tropical plants grew abundantly, while grapes, though not ripe, offered a pleasant taste. One morning, as they journeyed through rocky paths, their dog, Terror, signaled an approaching animal. Tim, alert with his rifle, shot a large mountain sheep for dinner. With skill, he dressed the sheep for cooking. However, lacking matches, Tim cleverly used his gun to ignite a fire for cooking. The group enjoyed the juicy steaks, wisely saving some for later. The warm climate limited their food preservation, prompting them to eat heartily. As they continued, a surprising find lay in their path: a beautiful, intricate Indian blanket. Elwood marveled at its craftsmanship, resembling Apache blankets, with vibrant colors and intricate designs. The mystery of how such a valuable blanket ended up there puzzled the group.|['1.

The group, relieved to have found a blanket and a rifle, encountered a Native American woman. Initially startled, she cautiously approached when Howard offered the blanket as a gesture of friendship. She then examined a gold watch he presented, showing familiarity with such items. With a smile, she traded the blanket back, bowed gracefully, and left swiftly. The travelers, happy with their acquisitions, still sought guns for the boys. Despite their lack of experience with firearms, they felt confident. After a meal and a break, they resumed their journey. Tim O'Rooney, content with his tobacco, pondered about his return home.

Our group had rested and began their journey towards the Salinas river. While walking, Howard spotted an Indian in a canoe on the river. The distance made it hard to see clearly, but they recognized him as the same person from before. Later, as they camped near the river, Elwood woke up to find a rattlesnake coiled near him. The snake's menacing presence paralyzed him with fear. Its shiny scales, venomous fangs, and hypnotic eyes made it a terrifying sight. Howard, unable to move, felt a chilling sensation as he stared into the serpent's eyes. The snake seemed to hold a strange power over him, mesmerizing him with its deadly gaze.

The strange sensations were akin to those of a man with a severe head injury. His thoughts struggled through blocked channels, unable to function properly. He needed clear thinking, but his brain felt frozen. As a beautiful yet menacing snake prepared to strike, Elwood's urgent words snapped Howard back to reality. With quick thinking, Howard covered himself and Elwood with a blanket as protection. Their shouts summoned Tim and their loyal dog Terror, who swiftly dealt with the snake. Grateful for their escape, they continued their journey cautiously. Elwood's concern about potential danger ahead lingered as they approached a campfire in the valley, where they encountered strangers.

Three young friends were approaching a campfire cautiously, aware of the need for stealth around sleeping Indians. Tim, their companion, had delayed them to scout the situation. When they finally reached the camp, they found three unkempt men preparing breakfast. As the men attended to their tasks, the boys observed their actions. The first man tended to cooking meat over the fire, the second wiped his face, and the third combed his hair. Upon being questioned, the man by the fire introduced himself as Ned Trimble. He humorously described his companions, George Wakeman and Alfred Wilkins, as being with him for menial tasks. Despite their lack of luck in the past, Ned expressed hope for future riches. The boys shared a laugh and were invited to join the men for breakfast.|"['Question 1: What were the three men doing when the boys first approached the campfire?\nA) Sleeping\nB) Preparing breakfast\nC) Fishing\nD) Tending to a fire\nE) Reading a map', 'Question 2: Which man introduced himself as Ned Trimble?\nA) The man cooking meat\nB) The man wiping his face\nC) The man combing his hair\nD) George Wakeman\nE) Alfred Wilkins', 'Question 3: What were George Wakeman and Alfred Wilkins described as doing by Ned Trimble?\nA) Cooking breakfast\nB) Sleeping\nC) Hunting\nD) Performing menial tasks\nE) Telling stories', 'Question 4: How did Ned Trimble describe their luck in the past?\nA) Unlucky\nB) Average\nC) Lucky\nD) Extremely lucky\nE) Superstitious', 'Question 5: What did Ned express hope for?\nA) Future riches\nB) Finding a new campsite\nC) Going home\nD) Meeting more strangers\nE) Getting lost', ""Question 6: How did the boys react to Ned's humor about his companions?\nA) They were offended\nB) They were confused\nC) They were scared\nD) They shared a laugh\nE) They left immediately""]"|['B) Preparing breakfast', 'A) The man cooking meat', 'D) Performing menial tasks', 'A) Unlucky', 'A) Future riches', 'D) They shared a laugh']
Ned Trimble and his friends had a lively meal conversation, discussing their recent adventures in California. They had spent five years there, seeking new opportunities after leaving the Sacramento Valley. Despite facing various dangers in the wild, they remained cheerful and hopeful.

On a Sunday, a young lady persisted in wearing shoes instead of going barefoot like others. Ned confronted her, leading to an exchange of presents and a parting of ways. Ned, with a grand air, returned a toothbrush and received a tin button. The group faced a crisis with little money but Elwood's valuable watch. They needed guns for protection against potential trouble with Native Americans. The eccentric miner, Ned Trimble, bid them farewell dramatically. As they left, Ned ran after them, offering more assistance. They continued their journey well-equipped with guns, ammunition, and their faithful dog. Spotting a strange animal-made structure, their dog, Terror, damaged it. The group speculated on the peculiar structure, likely built by mountain rats, known for their fine fur and hut-building skills.|['1.

The hunters, eager to find the canoe, hurried along the riverbank. After a mile, they spotted a dense area that caught their attention. Beneath the bushes, they found the hidden canoe, much to their delight. Elwood, excited, grabbed the paddle but ended up falling into the water. Despite the mishap, they all had fun learning to navigate the lightweight bark canoe. Tim skillfully guided them with the paddle, allowing the boys to relax and enjoy the gentle current. The tranquil journey offered them a chance to appreciate the beautiful surroundings of hills, mountains, and clear skies. Suddenly, their dog, Terror, sensed something and led them to a dying Indian hidden in the brush. Overwhelmed with pity, they discovered the injured man, a member of the Pah Utah tribe.|"[""1.

"The poor Indian mumbled incoherently, mentioning ""Shasta,"" gesturing to his mouth, and mimicking drinking. Tim, a kind-hearted boy, quickly made a leaf cup filled with water from the river to help the parched man.

The boys struggled to understand the Indian's gestures until Howard noticed a leaf he offered.

Elwood and Howard pondered the situation. Elwood realized that the Indians might see their kindness as a threat. They observed three Indians near the river, appearing to discuss something across the water. Tim O'Rooney, carrying an animal, cautiously approached the hidden canoe. Elwood tried to warn Tim discreetly, but Howard stopped him just in time, preventing their own discovery. Tim, unaware of the boys' signal, continued his journey across the river.

Howard aimed his gun at the savage on the shore, but the distance made his shot uncertain. The bullet alarmed the savages, who took cover. Tim used the carcass as a shield while paddling. The savages, undeterred, continued their pursuit. Tim, forced to defend himself, watched for their hidden position and waited for a chance to retaliate. Howard and Elwood, unable to help, could only watch as Tim drifted downstream. Tim's canoe turned left, showing he was trying to reach the opposite shore. The friends hoped for Tim's safety, but distant gunshots caused concern. Elwood noted the security of Ned Trimble's group, who were alert despite their few numbers.

"In everything that happens, there is a Providence, even if we cannot always see it. Remember the saying, 'Misfortunes are often blessings in disguise'? Sometimes we fail to appreciate such truths until a moment like this makes us see them clearly. It seems we are becoming philosophers,"" Howard remarked. They had been stationed on the island's lower end and returned to find the stranger standing, wrapped in his blanket, appearing to understand recent events. Tim O'Rooney, after crossing the river to the eastern shore, forgot about hostile Indians in search of food. He wandered into a wild, picturesque forest with hills, gorges, and ravines.

Carrying the deer on his shoulder, Tim made his way back, trying to avoid the savages. He climbed higher to stay hidden from below, making his journey tiring. As he walked along a ravine towards the river, the deer's body hit a rock, causing Tim to tumble down but luckily staying unharmed. He continued his trek, feeling the weight on his shoulder grow heavier, making frequent stops to rest. Tim prepared to defend himself if the savages appeared, planning to use the deer as cover. The savages followed his blood trail but lost it on rocky ground. Tim paddled away in a canoe, dodging a shot from the Indians.

By the afternoon, Tim realized it would soon be dark before he could catch up to his friends. He tried to spot them but they moved swiftly from cover to cover. Feeling discouraged, he decided not to fire. He focused on paddling faster in his canoe. Suddenly, he remembered a trick from his past and aimed his rifle at the approaching Indians. They shielded themselves with paddles. Tim didn't shoot, instead, he paddled hard. The Indians followed suit and gained on him. Tim then sprinted into the woods. As he ran, he encountered a grizzly bear. In a split second decision, Tim shot the bear, causing it to turn on the Indians, giving him a chance to escape.

After recovering from his fever, Shasta, a Pah Utah Indian, still appeared frail but regained his strong will. Elwood and Howard, unfamiliar with the natives, found Shasta mysterious. Despite the language barrier, emotions bridged the gap. Shasta, recovered, gestured towards the eastern shore and down the river, prompting the boys to nod in understanding. He swiftly maneuvered a tiny canoe, effortlessly gliding over the water with remarkable skill. As dusk fell, Shasta ferried Tim O'Rooney across the river, displaying his prowess in the canoe.

"As the gray light of dawn spread over the woods and river, Elwood Brandon woke up to find the Pah Utah Indian sleeping peacefully in the front of the boat.

Shasta, the Pah Utah, gestured for Elwood not to wander off, and Elwood understood. They all went ashore cautiously, following Shasta's advice. While exploring the riverbank, they heard a rifle shot, which turned out to be Tim preparing breakfast.

They had plenty of food, and now it was time to prepare it. Shasta, showing his excellent cooking skills, expertly cut the fish with his sharp hunting knife, leaving Terror's portion raw. He then skewered the fish on green prongs, making sure they were flat and fully exposed. The fire was ready, and the fish were cooked quickly and thoroughly. While the Pah Utah and Tim enjoyed their meal, Shasta brought out a beautifully carved pipe. After eating, they relaxed with a smoke. Howard and Elwood explored the area, staying within sight of Shasta. When Shasta tried to convey something about the north, the others were puzzled.

Tim and his friends ventured out on the river in a canoe, with Tim skillfully paddling while the Indian, Pah Utah, looked on with a hint of amusement.

Suddenly, they faced a pack of wolverines, but the Pah Utah remained calm. Tim, startled, grabbed his rifle, but the Indian's composure reassured them.

Attracted by the smell of cooking fish, wolverines approached the camp, howling in disappointment when they found the prey protected by fire. Terror, a dog, faced off against them, teeth bared. When guns were fired, the wolverines scattered but soon returned. The boys reloaded and fired again, with no effect. Then, unexpectedly, Shasta, an Indian, armed with a flaming brand and knife, chased and killed the wolverines. The boys continued to shoot, but the wolverines multiplied. Throughout the night, the campfire was kept burning as the wolverines circled, preventing any rest. Tim O'Rooney, restless and fearful, constantly shifted position. In a surprising turn, Shasta lightened the tense atmosphere with a clever prank on Tim, showcasing a rare sense of humor among his people.|['1.

The boys witnessed a thrilling scene around the campfire. The Irishman, in a panic, mistook a trick played by Shasta for a real threat, while the Pah Utah remained calm, lost in thought. The Newfoundland dog, Terror, was on edge, ready to protect his friends from the wolverines lurking nearby. The tense atmosphere was broken by bursts of laughter and nervousness. The dog's fierce battle with a wolverine added to the drama, with both creatures locked in a dangerous struggle. The group had to shout over the chaos to communicate, trying to maintain the fire to keep the predators at bay. Despite the danger, there were moments of quiet when they could exchange words, but the looming threat of the wolverines kept everyone on edge.|['1.

The battle between the Newfoundland and the wolverine was fierce but brief. The dog managed to defeat his opponent, but Shasta, an Indian, intervened with a flaming brand to scare off the other wolverines. As dawn approached, the group prepared to move, eyeing the canoes by the river. Shasta lit a fire to keep the wolverines at bay while they launched the boats. Despite the reluctance of the dog, Terror, to leave after his victory, he eventually boarded the boat. The party set off down the river, closely followed by the angry wolverines. With Shasta's guidance, Tim O'Rooney improved his paddling skills, learning to navigate the waters. Practice, they realized, was key to mastering the art of canoeing.|"['1.

The boy tried to imitate the Pah Utah's paddle strokes but found it challenging. They took turns paddling, each improving gradually. Elwood was eager to join in and Tim O'Rooney followed. Shasta led the way effortlessly, with the boys working hard to keep up. When they all got tired, they spotted a small island. Shasta headed towards it swiftly. The boys watched in awe as Shasta maneuvered his canoe expertly. Tim O'Rooney jokingly thought Shasta left to stretch his arms. As they waited for Shasta's return, a bird flew by, startling them. They watched it disappear into the distance.|"[""1.

A skilled hunter, Pah Utah, shot down a wild goose flying overhead with expert precision. The bird was swiftly prepared for a meal over a fire on their island campsite. The boys, Elwood and Howard, relished the savory meal, thriving in the outdoor life. Pah Utah's keen senses detected something down the river, prompting him to investigate. He stealthily paddled towards a distant campfire, leaving the boys intrigued. Despite their curiosity, they obeyed his silent command to stay hidden. As they continued down the river, their loyal dog, Terror, alerted them briefly. Eventually, Pah Utah signaled them to rise, and they saw the smoke of the campfire fading in the distance. The mysterious departure of Pah Utah left the boys pondering about his intentions and uncertain if they would meet him again.|"['1.

Howard hesitated but eventually agreed after his cousin convincingly explained the benefits of the plan. Setting their signals and strategies, the boys parted ways. The hill they intended to circle was unexpectedly large, rising to a considerable height. As Howard walked on, he realized the separation from his cousin might not have been wise. Doubts crept in about the decision. Feeling responsible for tempering Elwood's impulsive nature, Howard worried about the risks. As he hurried around the hill, he heard the nearby river but saw no sign of his cousin. Growing concerned, he whistled for Elwood, but the silence that followed made him uneasy.

Howard heard a faint whistle from far away, echoing among the hills, like it emerged from a distant cave. Uncertain of its origin, he debated following it or continuing to find his cousin Tim. Driven by his eagerness, Howard ventured into the hills, but the signal never returned. Despite whistling and firing his gun, no response came. As night fell, he retraced his steps toward the river. Eventually, he encountered Tim O'Rooney's dog, Terror, who was overjoyed to see him. Tim believed Elwood had strayed and would signal at daybreak. Howard, though, doubted Elwood would deviate from their plan unless for safety reasons. Tim's faith in Elwood's resourcefulness swayed Howard, but a lingering doubt persisted.|"['1.

Tim O'Rooney and Howard Lawrence sat in the dark woods, worried about Elwood Brandon's disappearance. They were eager for morning to search for him. Howard imagined where Elwood might be, hoping he was safe. The night was filled with wild thoughts and bizarre ideas. The darkness made it hard to see, and they relied on their dog for alertness. They heard strange sounds, even a distant gunshot. To mark their location, they used the rising sun's position and memorized the hills.

All this was decided, and they found themselves among the hills just as the sun was rising. They whistled and shouted for a while but got no response. They decided to search for where the boys had split up. It was far away, taking over an hour to find. Howard couldn't be sure he was right. Time was crucial, so they pushed forward. The dog sniffed the ground as if he had caught a scent but couldn't follow it accurately. They came to an opening in the hills just wide enough for a person to pass through. The path wound among rocks that barely allowed a man through. Eventually, the trail led them through the hills, revealing wild California scenery. They searched for Elwood's trail, but the dog couldn't find a definite scent. Howard doubted if Elwood had been there, but they pressed on. They saw several paths leading into the desolate scene. They chose one and carefully followed it for over an hour, navigating through rocks and ravines until they believed they were in the heart of the wilderness.|"['1.

As they stood up, they noticed the dark, stormy sky above. Thunder rumbled and lightning streaked across the clouds. The sky grew darker and more turbulent, almost turning into twilight. Tim O'Rooney praised the boy for his quick thinking. They hurried to find shelter as the storm approached. Climbing higher, they found a sheltered ledge to wait out the rain. The storm unleashed a downpour, creating a small stream. Meanwhile, five Indians investigated the antelope's remains, pointing in the direction Tim and Howard had taken. The rain forced the Indians to seek cover, allowing Howard to return to Tim and share what he had seen. After the storm passed, they cautiously returned to their canoe, determined to rescue Elwood Brandon from the Indians.

Excited and hopeful, Elwood rushed ahead, eager to surprise his cousin. However, as the path twisted and turned, he began to doubt if cutting across was a good idea. The growing darkness and a sudden shower of debris startled him, causing him to fall and feel sick. Ignoring Howard's calls, Elwood lay down, feeling indifferent to his surroundings.

In the darkness, surrounded by silence and occasional glimpses of stars, Elwood pondered his mistakes. He regretted his decision to separate from his friend Howard and venture into unknown territory.

The boy heard the animal's footsteps above him and sensed its danger. He searched for his gun in the darkness but found a stone for protection. The boy feared the animal's presence, but it kept his mind alert. He realized he was on a ledge and retrieved his rifle safely. As the light increased, he saw his precarious position.

Elwood had barely settled into his hiding spot when he heard Howard Lawrence's whistle echoing from the woods above. The sound startled him, feeling like the approach of Indians. Unable to respond to avoid capture, Elwood worried more for his friends who were unknowingly drawing closer to danger. Peeking out cautiously, he saw the Indians were awake but strangely unconcerned with the whistling. As he scanned the rocks for his friends, he caught a glimpse of Tim O'Rooney, but it vanished quickly. The distant sound of Tim's shot alarmed Elwood as it caught the Indians' attention. With a storm brewing overhead, Elwood hoped the distraction would shield him.

The group of Native Americans found Elwood hiding in fear near some rocks. They were not aggressive but took him as a prisoner. Elwood, realizing his situation, submitted to his fate. As they walked through the storm, one Indian tried to take Elwood's gun, but he reluctantly let go. Elwood noticed the intense gaze of the Indian but could not decipher his expression. Seeking shelter from the rain, they found a cave where they reunited with other Indians who had fled earlier. Elwood, drenched but unharmed, felt the Indians were indifferent captors, not showing hostility but also not kindness. The storm intensified, turning a small stream into a roaring torrent, emphasizing the need to seek safety.|"['1.

The Native Americans stood still like statues until the storm passed. Wrapped in blankets that shielded them from the rain, their long, dark hair adorned with feathers hung around their shoulders. Despite their peculiar appearance, they seemed content, untouched by civilization's vices. Elwood, their captive, observed them closely, wondering about their thoughts. When the rain stopped, two of them left to find Elwood's companions. As the day progressed, Elwood grew cold and hungry, prompting him to ask for food. The response was threatening, causing Elwood to retreat. Just as things seemed bleak, a familiar face appeared among the Indians - Shasta, Elwood's friend. Shasta quietly signaled Elwood to remain silent, and soon a fire was lit in the cave, providing a glimmer of hope in Elwood's uncertain situation.|"['1.

The fire blazed strongly, spreading warmth in the cave. Elwood, grateful for the heat, dried his wet clothes by the fire. Despite his hunger and weakness from fasting for thirty hours, he managed to endure due to his robust constitution. Although starving, the Indians paid no heed to his suffering. Elwood dared not disobey Shasta's command to remain strangers. When he requested food from the tall Indian, he was met with refusal and threats. The Pah Utah tribe debated Elwood's fate, causing unease in the boy. Eventually, the Pah Utah relented and provided fish for cooking. Elwood, starving, received fish that mysteriously fell into his lap, satisfying his hunger. Grateful but unable to express it, Elwood awaited the tribe's decision, staying at the back of the cave.|"[""1.

The Native Americans finished their meal and got ready to depart. Elwood observed them closely and when the tall man gestured for him to join, he eagerly took his place at the back of the line. As they were about to leave, Elwood noticed that Shasta was right behind him. Elwood had no idea where they were heading, but he followed Shasta blindly for a while until he sensed they were passing through a narrow passage. Suddenly, he was lifted by an iron grip, thrown into the air, and landed on a ledge. Elwood gazed at the stars above, feeling a sense of peace. Later, an Indian approached, lifted Elwood effortlessly, and carried him on his shoulder up a path. Elwood trusted the Indian's strength and skill, knowing he was in safe hands. After a while, the Indian gently placed Elwood on the ground, and they continued their journey through the woods.|"['1.

The Pah Utah and his companion moved silently through the dense forest, skillfully avoiding the trees. The Indian's arm effortlessly cleared a path, much like a snow plow cutting through snow for a train. Elwood, his young companion, followed closely, trusting the silent guidance. As they neared their destination by the river, Shasta deftly prepared a canoe for Elwood to rest in. The Indian's actions seemed to indicate a caring concern for the boy's well-being, ensuring he was comfortable and warm. Meanwhile, Tim and Howard waited by their own canoe, feeling anxious about leaving Elwood behind.

The two friends joyfully joined the canoes, with Shasta delicately motioning Elwood to his friends' vessel. They shared their experiences since parting, Elwood narrating his time with the Indians and Shasta's daring escape. Howard had little to add, leaving them to ponder the future cautiously. Shasta, focused on navigating the river, seemed indifferent to their conversation. The day after the storm was serene, nature refreshed. The Salinas River sparkled, inviting a landing where they encountered friendly fishermen. Shasta swiftly led them upstream, passing other travelers. Tim O'Rooney's comical pipe troubles amused the group, with his antics mirroring a steamboat's rhythm.
