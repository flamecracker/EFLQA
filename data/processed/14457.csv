In March, England welcomes spring with snowdrops blooming in Hyde Park, marking the season's arrival. The park is alive with the eager footsteps of soldiers from Kitchener's army, well-prepared after months of training. The grass is green, the roads firm, as they await their call to duty. The soldiers, a mix of Scots in kilts and other regiments, display a determined yet cheerful spirit. Bands play, feet march, and the crowd pays homage to these brave men. War is not just about battles; it's also about the sacrifices made by families and the hardships faced by soldiers. As I embarked on my journey in January, I witnessed the solemn preparations and the somber reality of war, reminding me of the courage and sacrifices of those who serve their country.|"['1.

As I passed through the narrow path, devoid of weapons or suspicious documents, I blamed myself and the woman who let me through. Had I revealed my true reasons, she would have kept me safe in England. The departure of the one-o'clock train from Victoria Station was both an event and a tragedy. Soldiers, returning to the front after a brief respite, were met with tears and joy. The platform was filled with soldiers heading back, their courage and patriotism evident. Among them was Sir Purtab Singh, an Indian prince, eyeing me suspiciously. As the train departed, the whistle sounded feeble amidst the somber crowd, leaving behind a scene of grief and tragedy etched on the faces of the women watching silently.|"['1.

The train had departed, and the car fell silent. Memories of the faces left behind lingered. Across from me sat a weary officer, motionless and gazing ahead. As we glided through the lush English countryside, he remained unchanged. I took a deep breath and ordered lunch. My journey to the war had begun, uncertain if I would reach my destination due to military restrictions. My mission was humanitarian, to assess the hospitals near the front lines. Reports of chaos in medical care spurred me on. The silence shrouding the war's realities compelled me to witness and document the human toll. My task was twofold: to evaluate hospital needs and to unveil the grim truth of modern warfare.|"[""1.

"There was much to discover during the war. What was happening in France? The powerful sister republic had a remarkable army in action. France and the United States shared strong bonds and mutual goodwill. The Statue of Liberty symbolized the friendship between the two nations. Thoughts of Lafayette and the battles fought for liberty in France arose. What was France's role in the war? The newspapers were filled with meaningless details about movements on the battlefield. What were the soldiers experiencing beyond the front lines? Men left for battle, never to return, their letters marked from ""somewhere in France."" Answers to these questions slowly unfolded. France fought bravely, Belgium persisted despite losses, and England held the line against fierce attacks, preparing for a significant offensive in the spring."|"['1.

The British soldier is well-equipped and well-fed, comfortably transported. England supports all allied armies, doing more than just controlling the seas. Witnessing the wounded, hospital trains, front lines, and soldiers' morale, one sees the war's humanity, inhumanity, bravery, and absurdity. The Belgian Red Cross aided in crossing the Channel to visit the war zone. America's support for Belgium was evident, but aid sent to Northern France was unknown. Doctor Depage, a Belgian Army colonel, showcased a remarkable hospital near Nieuport. Despite expected delays, permission was granted to explore. With letters to Belgian officials, access to the front seemed promising. The journey from Calais to La Panne was crucial for witnessing the realities of war.|"['1.

Some authors who made it there were given only a day, then sent back either across the Channel or to a harmless spot down south. But this small card, if things went smoothly, meant the chance to head fifty miles northeast to the real front. However, it offered no room for straying. A mile, just a hundred feet off the direct path north to La Panne, and I would be apprehended. But that worry could wait for later. I've never been arrested, except in hospitals. I was always where I shouldn't have been. I stayed at the Hôtel des Arcades in Dunkirk for weeks, near a house shut down for renting a room to a reporter. The journalist was given a five-year sentence but freed after five weeks. I was a writer through and through. I noted down all I saw openly and meticulously. I went on authorized trips to the front lines from Nieuport to La Bassée and Béthune, along Belgian, French, and English lines, always openly, always with a notebook. And nothing happened!|"['1.

It was crucial for me to reach Calais, but the boat changed course to Boulogne due to submarine reports, which was disappointing. I had a pass for Calais and dreaded being stranded in Boulogne. The journey was tense, with no other women on board, only British officers and imposing Indians. The day was bright but cold, the boat speeding with lifeboats ready. Lookouts seemed distracted, not focusing on their duty. I feared mines in the water and couldn't divert my eyes. Crossing the Channel felt like driving fast on a bumpy road, afraid to look away. Despite the initial fear, I grew accustomed to the crossings, even braving submarine attacks on subsequent trips. It taught me to develop a sense of calm amid danger, much like facing enemy fire.|"['1.

"I suspect the captain now. Many gulls were on the water. I searched for a post sticking out of the water. My joy and confidence vanished. I strained to watch all the gulls. ""Chase it,"" the captain said calmly. ""It's our only chance. If we spot the boat, we can catch them. These steamers go 26 knots, the sub only half that submerged. They manage 16 on the surface. Chase and sink them, that's my motto."" He explained the torpedo's snowy wake, its course-keeping mechanism, and detonator. My nerves turned to excitement. I craved to see the wake and the boat dodging it. It felt like a game until I saw the officer with an empty sleeve, a reminder of the war's cruelty. The Red Cross ship appeared, carrying wounded soldiers. Land came into view, the sand dunes of Ambleteuse. The sight was reassuring, but we stayed vigilant. Submarine attacks often occurred near harbors. Just days later, the boat narrowly escaped an attack outside Boulogne's harbor."|"['1.

As the twilight settled over the sea, the boat slowly docked, and I stepped onto French soil after showing my passport. Beyond the horizon to the north and east awaited the reason for my journey. Boulogne, a place many have visited and written about, now transformed by war into English hospitals, bustling with transport wagons and a mix of English and French uniforms. The damp chill of winter lingered in the air, penetrating fur and wool like an acid. Passing through customs with ease, I carried cigarettes for the soldiers, knowing their preference for a smoke over food. Witnessing the arrival of a British hospital train, the scene of wounded soldiers being carefully unloaded onto trucks left a lasting impression on me, a glimpse of the human toll of war.|['1.

Midway through the train, a broad window was opened, and two tall lieutenants, accompanied by four assistants, stood outside. The atmosphere was hushed, with commands whispered softly. The only sound was the muted rumble of trucks transporting soldiers with frozen feet. The lieutenants, with remarkable tenderness, received stretchers passed through the window. Each stretcher was carefully added to a row on the stone floor. The occupants, wrapped in brown blankets against the cold, lay quietly, some with knitted scarves around their heads. The line of stretchers grew, revealing the unwavering dedication of the British Army and people to caring for their wounded. The young lieutenant's strength and gentleness exemplified this commitment. As the train departed, the tireless work continued, showcasing the unparalleled care provided to the wounded during this historic war.|['1.

It took three hours to travel the twenty miles to Calais, from six o'clock to nine. I snuggled into my fur coat as two men in my compartment dozed off. One of them held a lit cigarette, which burned close to his fingers, a sight that caught my interest. However, just as it could have been exciting, he woke up, leaving me a bit disappointed. We started chatting, and I learned that he was an Englishman from a London newspaper. He relied on his luck to reach Calais and his cleverness to navigate through. He shared his name with me. Before leaving France, I heard about a generous and skilled man with the same name, entertaining recovering soldiers with movies near the front lines. I wish him success; he truly deserves it. As we finally arrived in Calais, the thought of food brought comfort. My special card transformed my status from a refugee to someone who could enjoy supper without fear. That night, I didn't spot any British troops at the Calais station, only French soldiers who seemed tired and unkempt. Although my initial impression wasn't favorable, my later encounters along the French front made me rethink. I still find the French uniform's loose fit and the soldiers' unkempt beards a little disappointing, despite their remarkable fighting skills. Upon closer examination, I noticed that the old French uniform was lighter and less durable compared to the English one. The new grey-blue uniform, although heavier, might not blend well with|"[""1.

On my writing desk, I have a German fatigue cap. When I shine my lamp on it, the cap loses its color and shape, fading away. Even in sunlight against grass, it disappears. This cap is part of the clever planning that equips German soldiers with white smocks and helmet covers to blend into the snowy landscape of Poland. In Calais, I had to find food and an address provided by Dr. Depage. Despite the poor food at the hotel, the French bread was delightful. The city was dark, anticipating a Zeppelin attack. I struggled to find a ride due to the curfew but eventually secured a carriage. Arriving at a large, cold house in a bewildering atmosphere, I found myself in a room with a funeral wreath and a chilly air.|"[""1.

By a window stood a narrow black iron bed, ominously devoid of a mattress. Where could it be? Had the previous occupant passed away, and the mattress disposed of? I cautiously sniffed around, detecting the lingering scent of disinfectant. The tale behind that room and its bed remains a mystery to me. Donning my fur coat, I retired to bed, only to be visited by a lady speaking French in the dead of night. The next morning, as I rose to a chilly seven degrees Celsius and got dressed, some of the enigma was unraveled at breakfast. The house sheltered the head surgeon of the Ambulance Jeanne d'Arc, a Belgian Red Cross hospital in Calais, along with others involved in Red Cross endeavors. It was also a residence for English nurses from the ambulance, elucidating why I was sent there, the simple furnishings, and the antiseptic smell. Yet, the enigma of the lady with the wreath and the black iron bed remained. She seemed older, with a son of nineteen fighting in the trenches. Although she never spoke of him, one can only imagine her emotions during the harrowing nights when wounded soldiers arrived at the hospital. The chaos of the autumn of 1914 had subsided, but hospitals were still brimming with patients. Surgical facilities, typhoid wards, and care for injured civilians were all in high demand.

Traveling from Calais to La Panne, one can witness the devastation caused by artillery fire, leaving towns destroyed and roads impassable. Even ambulances struggle to navigate through the rubble. Passing through military-controlled Calais, entry and exit are challenging. Despite this, the Belgian Red Cross managed to facilitate passage. The journey continues northeast through a desolate landscape of flat fields and canals. Passing Gravelines, once significant during the Armada, now a manufacturing hub, signs of war become more evident. Trenches line the roads, and barbed wire blocks paths, showcasing the war's impact. The landscape grows more desolate and warlike, with lookout platforms and low barbed wire entanglements. Barbed wire, mostly made in America, plays a crucial role in the conflict, originating from the Boer tactics in the South African War.|['1.

In Dunkirk, a bustling seaport for the Allied Armies, soldiers and marines filled the town square. British uniforms, transports, and ambulances were abundant, along with French and Belgian troops. The town buzzed with activity, from despatch riders on motorbikes to battered automobiles moving at a furious pace. The statue of Jean Bart, a privateer and pirate, loomed large in the square, observing the warlike scene. Despite the presence of historic relics like Bart's cutlass, modern warfare with aeroplane bombs and rumbling artillery guns puzzled the statue. While Dunkirk faced threats from German aeroplanes, the real front line lay fifteen miles away at Nieuport.

After crossing the bridge multiple times, the locals got used to seeing me, though they thought I was a bit crazy. They often grumbled until word spread that I had been received by the King. Suddenly, I was treated like royalty, with sentries saluting me as I passed. Once I crossed into Belgian territory, there were no more challenges. The atmosphere changed as the sound of distant gunfire and French planes flying overhead filled the air. The once bustling countryside became desolate, with tired soldiers trudging back to their billets. Despite the grim setting, the Belgian soldiers remained cheerful and resilient. As we drove through the town of Furnes, only one shell was fired, leaving the streets empty and eerie. Moving towards La Panne, a seaside town turned wartime capital, we navigated congested roads filled with troops heading to and from the trenches, witnessing the unwavering spirit of the Belgian soldiers.|"['1.

Most of the soldiers have been fighting since Liege. Out of the original 150,000 troops, only 50,000 remain. Their supplies are scarce compared to the English and French, and their uniforms are tattered. Despite holding the inundated region between Nieuport and Dixmude, constantly battling in water-filled trenches, they remain remarkably cheerful. The Belgian soldiers are described as courageous and resilient. The town of La Panne overlooks the sea, with the constant sound of guns from Nieuport. The base hospital for the Belgian lines receives soldiers with severe injuries, a grim reminder of the horrors of war. The Night Superintendent shared heartbreaking stories of the wounded, including a baby with both legs amputated and a nun who lost an arm. The hospital, once a bustling seaside hotel, is now a somber place filled with the suffering and sacrifice of war.|"['1.

The town of La Panne sits on sand dunes, similar to Ostend but smaller, almost like a village. Trees struggle to grow in the sandy soil, twisted by sea winds, with green trunks covered in smooth moss. The grass over the dunes turns grey and dry in winter, shaped by the wind into surging waves. The wide, level beach lacks surf, with the sea gently washing in white lines near cavalry horses training. Fishermen's boats mark the high tide limit, now also patrolled by soldiers due to the war. King Albert and Queen Elisabeth reside in six villas facing the sea, with the Queen visiting the hospital daily. La Panne, though under constant aerial surveillance, remains untouched due to its strategic insignificance and the Queen's royal status. The contrast between bustling Brussels and quiet La Panne reflects the stark change in Belgium from its pre-war state.|"['1.

In front of a grand building, German guns are now placed, turning the capital of Belgium into a simple fishing village on the sand dunes. The King of Belgium has swapped his lavish palace for a modest house, showing his disregard for opulence. This stark contrast struck me one winter morning as I gazed at the royal villa from the La Panne sands. Surrounded by sentries, the biting sea wind whipped the grey grass and sand around the cavalry horses. The Belgian soldiers I observed were on their rest day, part of the new army being trained for the upcoming campaign. Despite being shabby and cold, they were cheerful and eager to be photographed. Some soldiers were seen peeling and eating raw potatoes due to limited food supplies. Sending canned goods like baked beans could greatly benefit the underfed Belgian troops, providing sustenance and morale for their challenging days in the trenches.|"[""1.

In spring, knitted woollens become popular again, like socks, mittens, abdominal belts, and neck scarfs. A soldier shared that he prefers a wide scarf, eight feet long, to wrap around his body. Bully beef, a tinned cooked beef, is a common meal. Belgian bully beef is tougher than English, but both are appreciated. Soldiers desire variety, including sugar, tea, jam, and cheese. As winter ends, the Belgian army needs portable kitchens for hot meals. These kitchens, priced at $250 with a horse, provide warm food like coffee in the trenches. Additionally, surgical supplies, hospital equipment, field kitchens, jams, canned beans, cigarettes, and rubber boots are essential.

After that day, I often visited La Panne. I became familiar with the road from Dunkirk, lined with mud and ditches, heavy transports, and grey gunboats in canals. I witnessed scenes of soldiers cleaning trenches in cold waters, refugees fleeing towns by day and returning to sleep in cellars at night, and long lines of Algerian Spahis against the setting sun. The sight of aëroplanes and the injustice of war haunted me. The suffering of the wounded, the blind, and the maimed left me questioning their future after being discharged from hospitals. These boys and men, with their shattered lives and tattered uniforms, faced an uncertain fate.

The road, despite heavy traffic, is regularly maintained, though accidents were common during the harsh winter. Even now, with improved conditions, accidents still occur due to speeding cars. The lack of restrictions leads to vehicles overturned and abandoned in fields. To manage water, ditches are built alongside the road. Passing checkpoints is easy with just a password.

Advances in the war can be measured step by step. In the region from Nieuport to Ypres, battles are fought around isolated farms turned into small islands due to floods. These farms are defended by a handful of soldiers, machine guns, and barbed wire. Brave soldiers wade through water to capture these outposts, facing the risk of drowning if wounded. There are no glorious charges, just a relentless struggle with gains that can be lost the next day. Meanwhile, there is a growing feeling in England and France that their governments' silence was a mistake. The German propaganda in America continues unchecked, presenting only one side of the story. The war is not just a local issue but a global upheaval that impacts everyone. The English people are starting to regret their lack of communication, especially regarding Belgium's suffering.|"['1.

In the midst of war, the challenges of unpreparedness and overwhelming patient numbers were being managed with scientific efficiency. Yet, there were still areas for improvement. Ambulance drivers and nurses varied in their reliability and skills. Some supplies exceeded demand, while crucial items like proper food for the sick were scarce and hard to obtain. Despite these challenges, advancements in surgery, such as the stereoscopic X-ray and antitetanus serum, were proving invaluable in saving lives. However, the real battle for survival happened in the harrowing moments between injury and nightfall, where the brutality of war overshadowed surgical prowess. In the desolate No Man's Land, men lay wounded and abandoned, enduring thirst, cold, and exposure.

In a modern hospital, I observed two operating rooms with advanced equipment and sterile white surroundings. These rooms were connected to a laboratory and an X-ray room equipped with a stereoscopic X-ray apparatus. This apparatus helps in locating bullets and shell fragments in the body. I witnessed a surgery where a piece of shell was removed from a man's brain efficiently. The surgeons wore white uniforms, gauze masks, and used sterilized instruments under bright lights. The surgery was quick and precise, taking only twelve minutes from incision to wound closure. Despite the war setting, the care and professionalism reminded me of a peaceful hospital environment. The story of a soldier paralyzed from the waist down, smiling with hope before surgery, left a lasting impact on me. The uncertainties of war and the resilience of individuals facing such challenges were evident in these medical interventions.|"['1.

I wish I could brighten this somber scene with something joyful. I wish I could see the phonograph playing A Wee Deoch-an'-Doris in the room for patients with a view of the sea. I wish I could believe that the baby without legs will grow up content. I wish I could find peace knowing the fallen officer died honorably. I wish I could find solace for the boy who suffered. I wish I could see the women below as heroes of a noble cause. But I can't. All I see is greed and the thirst for power. In a cheerful moment, I met a German soldier, a blue-eyed, yellow-haired young man with a warm smile. He lay alone, bewildered, yet unharmed by hate. Despite the war, acts of kindness still exist, like when they saved his leg. Scenes like this play out across Germany, France, and Belgium daily. The German, French, and Belgian peasants are peaceful, not eager for war. They want to sing and garden, not fight. Yet, they bear the heavy burden of war machines marching over their lands, leaving them poor and struggling. The Russian peasant, too, toils under a distant government, loyal to a cause they may not understand.|"['1.

At the La Panne hospital during the war, the scene was a mix of tragedy and resilience. Women and children found themselves in the midst of chaos, while a brave telegraph operator continued his duties despite losing both legs. A Belgian aristocrat, unaccustomed to hardship, now oversaw the cleaning of soldiers' uniforms. The hospital's drawing-room, once a grand space, became a haven for recovering soldiers. Nurses wrote letters, surgeons took breaks, and soldiers with injuries sat around, some needing assistance to move. The young woman, lacking warm clothing, showed the meticulous process of cleaning and repairing soldiers' uniforms.

I was getting ready to leave the safety of the Belgian Red Cross to head to Dunkirk in General Melis's car. Uncertain about what lay ahead, my time at La Panne and Ambulance Ocean had made me friends. In wartime, things change swiftly, shedding the norms of ordinary life. La Panne felt like a familiar place. The wounded boy in the car, about nineteen years old, had a proud mother. Despite his broken arm, he was alert and observant. The drive to Dunkirk was chaotic, with the daring red-headed Flemish chauffeur at the wheel. Riding in a luxurious limousine, I faced danger but also comfort, with hot coffee and sandwiches during the journey. Despite the soldier-chauffeur and the carbines, it felt almost like a leisurely tour through Northern France and Belgium.|"[""1.

I was in a car, speeding through unfamiliar lands where I couldn't communicate with the driver. I clung to my seat as we raced around corners and narrowly avoided accidents. Thoughts of danger crossed my mind, but I found solace in the fact that other vehicles kept up the same frantic pace. Despite a few close calls, the journey remained mostly uneventful. Dusk settled in, and I longed for familiarity and English speakers. Eventually, I arrived at a grand building where General Melis awaited me. He listened to my concerns with kindness and understanding, offering me a permit to stay in Dunkirk and arranging for my journey to Ypres the next day.

I discovered that a room had been reserved for me at the Hotel des Arcades. The room was spacious, overlooking the public square and the statue of Jean Bart. It was truly a luxurious room, evident from the lavish upholstery even on the doors. The grandeur of the room made it stand out, enjoying a sense of grand isolation. Despite the desire for neighbors, I found myself mostly alone in this regal part of the hotel. The absence of women, except for a frantic lady manager and two chambermaids, was noticeable. The staff, including the boy who brought hot water, communicated in a language I misunderstood initially.

I wanted to seek refuge in the cellar or hide in the office safe. However, I felt a heavy responsibility as the sole woman and American present. The waiters had sought shelter in the cellar, while the officers gathered in the café below. Amidst the ringing alarm bell, Emil's face appeared pale under the candlelight. The gunfire had momentarily stopped but resumed shortly after. Suddenly, a bomb detonated nearby, its deafening noise penetrating the closed windows. Emil, visibly shaken, placed my coffee before me and vanished. Aerial bombardment is a dreadful experience, shattering the peace symbolized by the sky. Unlike ground artillery, there is no warning or escape from aerial attacks. The streets empty as people, yearning for a simple life, sit in fear awaiting the unknown. Outside, Belgian officers conversed over liqueurs, avoiding the grim reality unfolding.|['1.

The explosions were constant. Downstairs, the landlady screamed with each blast. As the chaos neared, cries and French words echoed up the staircase in a frightening rhythm. During a brief pause, I risked a glance out the window. The moon illuminated the square, revealing silent, darkened houses. No light seeped through closed shutters. The street lamps were extinguished, no cars or people in sight. The town lay eerily quiet under the moon's glow. Suddenly, another explosion shattered the peace. The bombardment intensified, shaking the town. The night was filled with chaos until the ambulances signaled the end.

The aftermath of the raid was mostly psychological, a tactic of intimidation that is a disturbing part of the German military strategy. This approach includes burning cities, attacking unarmed coastal towns in England, executing civilians in Belgium, and now sinking small trading ships and fishermen's boats in the British Channel. The raid did not yield any military benefits and was not meant to. No soldiers were harmed, and military supplies were left untouched. Tragically, the casualties were once again innocent civilians, mostly women and children. The destroyed homes belonged to non-combatants, and only two men lost their lives while seeking shelter during the attack.

In the spring, Kitchener's army arrived, causing the blue portion of the map to grow slightly. However, the yellow part remained unchanged due to the significant Belgian casualties.

Many great poems have been written about battles and charges on the battlefield. But what about the men who drowned in ditches, or the soldiers caught in barbed wire near inland lakes? The fighting in the winter has been a mystery to many noncombatants, with advances and retreats around outposts like farms, churches, and villages. In the flooded areas of Belgium, these outposts have become islands, defended by barbed wire and quick-firing guns. Troops on both sides fight for control of these strategic points, building pathways through the flood under constant fire. Behind the scenes, at headquarters, officers plan and strategize, playing out battles that determine lives and the fate of empires. Amidst the chaos, peasant women cook meals for the soldiers, their lives upturned by the war.|['1.

What were the thoughts of these people? What are they thinking now?--for they are still there. What does it all mean to them? Do they ever glance at the moving cord of the war map on the wall? Is this war to them only a matter of a courtyard or a windmill? Of mud and the upheaval of quiet lives? They appear to be waiting--for spring, probably, and the end of hostilities; for spring and the planting of crops, for quiet nights to sleep and days to labour. Twilight had fallen by that time. It had commenced to rain. I could see through the window heavy drops that stirred the green surface of the moat at one side of the old building. On the wall hung the advertisement of an American harvester, a reminder of more peaceful days. The beating of the rain kept time to the story Captain F---- told that night, bending over the map and tracing his country's ruin with his forefinger. Much of it is already history. The surprise and fury of the Germans on discovering that what they had considered a contemptible military force was successfully holding them back until the English and French Armies could get into the field; the policy of systematic terrorism that followed this discovery; the unpreparedness of Belgium's allies, which left this heroic little army practically unsupported for so long against the German tidal wave.

During the intense battle at the Yser, a German officer's diary revealed the harsh realities of war. The officer described the relentless German offensive and the challenges faced by the soldiers. The lack of proper medical care, scarcity of food and water, and the devastation caused by enemy artillery were highlighted. The officer expressed the struggles of the troops, enduring heavy losses while unable to make significant progress against the enemy.

A night of relative calm has passed. The safety of the Yser bridge is secure for now. The battle raged throughout the day without clear orders. The intensity of the infantry and artillery clashes continues, resulting in only casualties. Efforts are being made to connect with the sixth division of the Third Reserve Army Corps on the right. The previous night was dreadful with a fierce rainstorm leaving soldiers freezing in knee-deep water. The situation remains unchanged, with ongoing fighting and heavy losses. The need for artillery suppression of enemy guns is highlighted. The lack of clarity and chaos persist, with regiments disorganized under relentless fire.

"It was freezing cold as we approached the headquarters of the Third Division of the Belgian Army, known as the Iron Division. The building, humorously called the ""château,"" was constructed by officers and men using fresh boards and lined with newspapers. Inside, the atmosphere resembled a Western shack from the gold rush era. A war map of the Eastern front hung on one wall, marked with flag pins. The officers warmly greeted us as we entered, showing meticulous preparation for our visit. The headquarters buzzed with activity, with a well-organized desk, gleaming floors, and a room filled with American typewriters and mimeographing machines. A tall officer, fluent in English, guided me through a room displaying battlefield relics like shell fragments, rifles, and bullets."|['1.

During a visit to a château, a kind Belgian officer shared insights about German shells. He explained how early German shells splintered finely, unlike the later ones made with inferior materials. The officer even pointed out an aluminum nose, indicating the scarcity of copper in Germany. Reflecting on the officers' hospitality, the narrator appreciated their efforts to make her comfortable, providing food and warmth in the chilly dawn after a trench visit. As they neared the trenches in a car without lights, soldiers silently made way through the rain and mud. Approaching a church near the Belgian lines, the narrator witnessed a poignant scene of over two hundred soldiers huddled on straw-covered floors, their weary faces illuminated by dim candles, revealing the toll of war.|"['1.

"The scene inside the church was a mix of darkness and light. Four men played cards beneath an image of Our Lady, speaking softly to each other. A soldier sat in a corner, writing a letter by candlelight, using a loaf of bread as his makeshift table. Another soldier had a loaf of bread as his pillow, sleeping soundly. The bond between the Belgian officers and their troops was evident in this friendly setting. The officers affectionately called their men ""little soldiers"" and treated them with kindness. The soldiers acknowledged the necessity of war, even if it meant churches being destroyed for military purposes.

We rode in the car once more, moving towards the ominous boundary of No Man's Land. The road ran alongside the trenches, and the shelling resumed. The rain had stopped, and now the Germans were launching magnesium flares, known as starlights by the British and _fusées_ by the French. These silent but stunning lights illuminated the landscape for a brief moment, revealing everything below. The night was filled with these floating lights, silently watching over the fields, exposing movements of troops and vehicles. The officers in the car observed these signals closely, aware of the German spy system's reach.

During my nighttime travels through Flanders near the battle lines, I encountered a desolate landscape with destroyed homes, water-filled ditches, and fields in disarray. Yet, amidst this eerie silence, lights flickered in the distance, only to vanish when approached. These mysterious sightings raised questions about potential spies lurking in the darkness. Could they be Belgians or French, forced by desperation to collaborate with the enemy? It seems unlikely. Instead, the more plausible scenario involves German infiltrators navigating the treacherous terrain, slipping through gaps in the trenches inch by inch. As troops moved out of the trenches, our progress was hindered by the crowded road, where bandaged soldiers peered curiously into our car. The tense atmosphere escalated when a sudden stop led to fears of a German attack, highlighting the constant vigilance required in wartime situations.|"['1.

"On their journey, the officers in the car examined the map and settled on a path, engaging in conversation. Among them was an officer from the Third Division, with English heritage, who recounted a dramatic event during the capture of Liège.

Colonel Jacques, a decorated war hero, sat at the head of the table in a humble farmhouse, beaming at his guests. The wind howled outside, setting the windows to vibrating. A young officer stood and read a poem praising Colonel Jacques' bravery and leadership. Despite the war being a step away, the atmosphere was warm and cheerful. Colonel Jacques signed a copy of the poem for the guests as they prepared to leave. As they ventured out into the night, they faced the hazards of sniping and slippery mud-filled shell holes.

The embankment rose tall, with trenches in between and vigilant sentries halting our progress. The party would halt abruptly, cautious of the sentries who might shoot first and ask questions later. An officer would step forward with the password, the tension palpable in the air. The sentries stood alert, carbines at the ready, eyes fixed on any suspicious movement. We walked silently in the moonlight, the icy wind cutting through us. In the distance, the red flashes of guns from Dixmude pierced the silence. At a ruined house near the advanced trenches, officers gathered. The house, battered by war, stood exposed on the railroad elevation, surrounded by barbed wire and flanked by machine gun nests. Inside, the walls were riddled with shell holes, and the wind whistled through the broken windows.

During wartime, soldiers often find ways to cope with the stress of battle. For example, artillerymen might blow off steam by firing their guns after losing a game. Meanwhile, snipers keep watch for any suspicious activity, like noticing movement at the House of the Barrier. Despite the appearance of peace, the sounds of distant artillery fire remind everyone of the ongoing conflict. In one instance, the Germans launched a fierce attack to capture an outpost, but miraculously, no harm came to the narrator's soft hat. The trenches, built against a railroad embankment, provided shelter from the elements. Soldiers huddled in these shallow trenches, some resembling tiny houses, seeking refuge from the biting wind and rain. One major proudly showed off an American machine gun, emphasizing its reliability in combat. The presence of a cat and a telephone instrument added a touch of normalcy to the otherwise grim surroundings. The soldiers were surprised to see a woman visiting, speculating that she might be royalty. Despite the harsh conditions, the soldiers' resilience and camaraderie shone through in the face of adversity.|"['1.

That evening, I peered from a sheltered spot towards the German trenches, struck by the stark contrast between the soldiers' conditions and the picturesque landscape. The moon cast a silvery path over the gleaming water lagoon that stretched in every direction, adorned with twisted winter trees. Despite the beauty, the air reeked with a horrid stench from the lagoon. The cold, damp weather penetrated clothing to the bone, unlike the cold in America. The decision was made to traverse the road near the embankment, knowing the danger it posed. A tall Belgian officer guided me through the barbed wire, the moonlight both comforting and worrisome.

This is a new type of warfare, involving artillery and infantry in trenches. New laws have been established to govern this conflict. An interesting agreement exists where each side spares the sentries of the other unless active fighting occurs. These sentries are always visible in front of the trenches and are the first targets in case of an attack. Despite the constant vigilance, some parts of the front have experienced long periods of quiet. However, as time passes, more intense battles are likely taking place.

In Belgium, a Capuchin monk showed remarkable heroism by manning a church tower alone for months during intense fighting. Despite constant shelling from German forces, he bravely reported enemy movements via telephone. This monk, now a soldier, exemplified courage and selflessness. His duty was perilous, yet he remained steadfast. The day will come when the tower falls or is captured, but his bravery will be remembered. I had the privilege of speaking with him, a humble man in a Belgian officer's uniform. As we walked back, a cat guided us, a reminder of the war's impact on even the smallest creatures. Passing checkpoints, we returned safely, having witnessed the monk's unwavering dedication in the face of danger.|"['1.

Captain F---- was angry. The officers at the House of the Barrier raised their hands. They believed the risk was acceptable for men but foolish for a woman. Despite this, they found it interesting and somewhat amusing after the danger had passed. It was revealed that the captain and his companion had a plan to draw enemy fire by splashing in the water if shooting started. Returning to the car, we walked along the damaged roads in the cold wind, but my excitement kept me warm. I had experienced the front lines and even ventured beyond, witnessing the devastation of war in No Man's Land. The trenches, though uncomfortable, shared similarities: always behind railroad embankments, dirty, cold, and sometimes filled with mud and water. I later saw French and English trenches, but it was the combination of beauty and horror in the inundated area that left a lasting impression. A cow and a pig stood untouched between the armies, a stark reminder of the war's impact on civilians. One town, once beautiful and now destroyed, stood out. The church cemetery, once peaceful, had been shelled, with crosses scattered in disarray and graves exposed by explosions, leaving a haunting scene that I will never forget.|['1.

Standing amidst the chaos and destruction, witnessing the devastation and desecration, one could see the telephone wires connecting the trenches to headquarters and the château. As dawn approached, the automobile departed from the ruined town, heavy silence weighing on everyone. The officers, viewing the ruin through fresh eyes, were fatigued and disheartened. The typewriters clicked in the neighboring room, messages pouring in from the places just left. Despite the suffering inflicted by the German invaders, the Belgian Army persisted, fighting on. The landscape beyond the enemy's trenches lay devastated, yet the spirit of Belgium endured. The narrator anticipated being the first correspondent to explore the British front, having achieved one ambition of pronouncing Ypres but realizing the challenge of mastering Przemysl. Ypres stood out as a focal point in the ongoing conflict, with the French and English forces stationed there. The town's encirclement allowed for devastating bombardment, resulting in a harrowing scene of desolation.|"['1.

General M agreed to accompany me to Ypres, a town held by the French. As a Belgian general, it was customary during the war to have a French officer escort us from the town of Poperinghe. War has its own set of rules, much like a game of bridge. I often had passes to visit various batteries, escorted by members of the Headquarters' Staff. The sight of the uniforms created the illusion of visiting royalty. On a cold winter day, we traversed the snowy landscape, enveloped in rugs. The tired and dreary soldiers we passed didn't exhibit heroism but rather fatigue and depression. The English Tommy approaches fighting with a sense of fairness and sportsmanship, while the French soldier fights with passion and emotion, driven by memories of past injustices. Their contrasting approaches to war have shaped history.|['1.

In all armies, soldiers find contentment when they make progress in battle, despite enduring discomfort like wet trenches and freezing cold. Movement uplifts their spirits, while the monotony of trenches and shelling can be disheartening. Soldiers, like the British, protect themselves by rubbing oil on their bodies before battle. Each soldier's gear holds a story; a Bavarian soldier's cap, stained with blood and mud, symbolizes the sacrifice of many lives during a failed trench capture. The journey to Ypres reveals soldiers at rest, horses being tended to, and civilians getting inoculated against typhoid. Despite challenges, soldiers adapt to new terrains and conditions, facing the ferocity of Arab and Turco troops with courage.|"['1.

The car careened wildly, skidding before righting itself sharply. Amidst the chatter, no one acknowledged the brush with danger. Reluctant to bring it up, I hastily jotted down the Germans' harsh tax on Belgian refugees in my notebook. The general, fuming, erupted in rapid French, likely discussing the confiscation and destruction of their property. The tax aimed to lure back the elite Belgians to revive the country. This move was to halt American sympathy, urging refugees to return and kickstart the factories. Germany viewed Belgium as part of its empire, striving to revitalize the idle factories by coercing owners to return. The British government, through the Bank of England, guaranteed the monthly payment of Belgium's war indemnity to Germany, totaling over nineteen million pounds. The Société Générale de Belgique was compelled by Germany to issue notes backed by gold reserves to prevent the devaluation of Belgian currency. Upon seizing Brussels, German officers oversaw the transfer of the gold reserve from the great Brussels Bank.|"['1.

The vault keeper arrived breathless but without his keys, causing a delay as they descended through numerous doors to the vault. The journey was slow, with officers stamping about impatiently. The cold and foggy weather weighed heavily on spirits, making it easier to stay in the car than to investigate. On the return journey, they encountered a horse carcass being carved by peasants. The winter impasse and weather conditions made one wonder about the impact on soldiers' morale. Rumors of soldiers committing suicide due to discouragement circulated, but one tragic incident was actually an accidental gun explosion that left a sentry injured and alone in his hut at night.|"[""1.

In a solemn moment, a man sat pondering life without his right hand. He realized he couldn't pull a trigger with his left hand, so he ingeniously tied a cord to the gun's trigger and the door. As he sat on a bench and kicked the door, the gun fired. Meanwhile, during the town's evacuation, nuns led patients from an asylum. Despite shells falling around them, the patients cheered at the chaos, slowing the evacuation. The nuns struggled to move them as the patients marveled at the explosions. The scene was chaotic, with patients blocking roads and hindering the movement of necessary supplies. The city of Ypres, once a vibrant place, now lay in ruins, with the famous Cloth Hall destroyed beyond repair. The belfry, a mere shell, stood precariously, a stark reminder of the city's devastation.|"[""1.

The unique arcade at the end has vanished completely. Nothing remains of the iconic Cloth Hall, built in 1200, or the Cathedral from 1300. General M---- stood beside me, gazing at the ruins with a hint of Belgium's tragedy on his face. It was a lesson in modern warfare. Bombardment isn't just about destroying towns; it aims to cut off communications, hinder troop movements, and disrupt supply lines. I learned about aerial signaling for targeting, with detailed maps used by aviators to mark every feature. The destruction of towns behind enemy lines was met with anger, as seen in the furious response to Ypres' bombardment.

In America, grand buildings rise swiftly from steel and stone, but in Flanders, the ancient structures hold deep meaning. They embody history and art, unlike the American way of displaying art at home. The people of the Continent embed their art into their buildings, like the paintings in churches or the Cloth Hall. Their homes are simple, serving only for living. The destruction of the Cloth Hall in Ypres deeply affected the officers, a loss beyond just a building.

As we strolled through the town, the aftermath of destruction unfolded before us. The impact of shell fire was evident in the streets, leaving behind a surreal scene. Doors and lintels stood alone, furniture pieces scattered, and iron street lamps twisted into odd shapes.

Amidst the chaos, a wooden scaffolding for repairing the Cloth Hall tower remained unscathed. Despite the desolation, a few civilians had returned, seeking refuge in the sturdy stone houses.

"During the intense bombing, some buildings were destroyed, but miraculously, most remained unharmed. Unfortunately, the chapel suffered the worst fate, obliterated by a single shell while sheltering soldiers. Tragically, all inside perished. The devastation wrought by that one explosion was immense, leaving little standing. Despite the chaos, medical staff continued treating patients in the cellar with only a couple of candles. The wards were filled with innocent victims of war—children maimed, women paralyzed. As they lay in darkness, one can only imagine their thoughts during the long, silent hours.

The leader of the military base was stationed in the home of a legal official. Most of the residences used by the base personnel were also owned by notaries. It seemed that the notary held a significant role in a French town. The dwelling was grand, yet only had one modest lamp that was carried from room to room. Despite its simplicity, the lamp was a peculiar sight in such a cozy setting during wartime. A soldier's letter, recovered from a fallen German, revealed his dire health condition and longing for his family. The soldier, unaware of his heroism, expressed a desire to return home and be remembered by his loved ones.

Hedwig mentioned sending packages with essential items and even included her photograph in the latest one. Despite wanting to write a letter, she lacked writing paper due to being occupied with making clothes for their children. Otto, however, lay dead that night, a victim of the belief that duty to empire surpasses all else. The Commandant described how German soldiers, upon surrendering, emphasize their family status by removing their gear and repeating '_Pater familias_.' Even young boys would indicate the size of their families with their fingers. A nurse, with minimal notice, rushed to the front to aid the wounded.

During the war, medical supplies were scarce. The lack of surgical dressings forced workers to use iodine, causing a strong smell. The soldiers' clothes had not been changed in weeks, making them stiff and hard to cut through. Underneath, the men were infested with vermin. Many wounds were left untreated, turning green. Despite the challenges, the workers, including English Quakers and a dedicated curé, tirelessly cared for the wounded. The conditions were harsh, with limited access to clean water. The story highlights the heroic efforts and sacrifices made during wartime.

Four men sat around the table, inspecting my papers one by one. After the scrutiny, I was dismayed to learn that I couldn't board the Calais boat. The only option was a boat to Boulogne, where passengers were already preparing for the journey to Paris. Despite the well-lit and cheerful Boulogne boat, I needed to reach Dunkirk.

"At last, he was summoned elsewhere. I sought refuge in a cabin on the deck, securing the door behind me. I recall covering my feet with a life preserver for safety in case of a submarine threat and wrapping myself in a fur coat to ward off the cold. That's all I recollect until this morning, when I opened the door to find us nearing the port of Calais. The ship's officers, if surprised by my appearance, hid it well, knowing I couldn't easily evade the authorities in Calais under military rule. Currently, I'm battling a mild case of the flu at a hotel in Calais, having had my morning coffee and flu remedies. As I wait, I observe two torpedo boats named BE and ER in the harbor, humorously spelling out ""BEER"" when side by side. It's been said that the English and Germans have constructed replica battleships to deceive enemy submarines. This strategic ploy, amusingly dubbed a battle of expletives, aims to mislead submarines while real battleships remain elsewhere.

In France, American leaders found crucial support to establish the new republic. Despite France's monarchy opposing democracy, they sent their finest to aid America. Remarkably, during France's financial crisis, they loaned America six million dollars interest-free for a year. The bond between France and America endured beyond political changes. France's assistance to America ignited its own revolution, inspired by American ideals of liberty and individual freedom. France, like America, values internal conscience over external control. Both nations navigate the balance between liberty and democracy. France's victory over challenges, including a discontented nobility, mirrors America's struggles. The French Revolution, guided by the star of Liberty, echoes the American flag. Close ties prompted efforts to share French war efforts with America.

I traveled back across the Channel to witness the French and English forces. On a previous visit, I saw the Belgian Army at the front and the French Army in resting areas. This time, I was to observe the French Army in action. The journey began by leaving Calais, which was straightforward. The car arrived from Dunkirk with passes. After taking some medicine, I got ready and packed my bag. I bid farewell to the hotel with a tinge of sadness, especially to the porcelain tub made in my hometown. I left a cake of soap in the bathroom, imagining the surprise of the next guest. The car that picked me up showed signs of being at the front all night, covered in mud and battle scars.

Convalescing soldiers hobbled on crutches, babies rode in strollers, and young aviators in black leather watched a biplane fly low. English naval officers on leave strolled with an easy stride. The machine sped northeast, shedding dried mud like missiles through tidy French villages. These villages repurposed items efficiently, with no waste. A Red Cross card hiccup caused a delay, but eventually, passage was granted. Aviators buzzed overhead, women in bright aprons adorned the roads, and sentries halted traffic with chains. After a stop in Dunkirk, a trip to the French lines began, passing through Bergues, a town with a history of changing ownership. The peaceful countryside featured windmills, gardens, and shepherds.

Heading further south, the landscape changed with motor ambulances and convoys of motor lorries becoming more common.

From a window, a steep garden dropped away, dreary under the grey sky and snowfall. The same pale-green moss covered trees. Beyond the garden wall, a field had a hole from a German plane dropping a bomb. Hot coffee was ordered, and we moved to a smaller room with a fire where French soldiers gathered. One wrote while the others got their palms read. They laughed and chatted cheerfully. After coffee, I got a room at the end of a cold corridor. The room had two small windows, a basin, a pitcher, a torn bed, a pine chair, a candle, and a small stove. The windows rattled from Ypres' bombardment. I met General Foch, who invited me to lunch with his staff in a room set for fourteen.|"['1.

General Foch, a distinguished man with iron-grey hair and direct grey eyes, is known for his punctuality and neatness due to his military training.

Sure. One must choose sides; true neutrality is impossible in this conflict. Every nation has a stake in the outcome, whether actively or in the future when the victor is clear. Remaining impartial is not an option; taking a position is necessary. After conversing with General Foch, I inquired about the German advance, questioning if it was merely ruthless or truly barbaric. I acknowledged my inability to speak on behalf of American sentiments due to my lack of authority. General Foch shared insights on aëroplanes, shells, and French artillery, praising the courage of the soldiers.

During the initial part of the journey, the scenery was rather uneventful except for ongoing road repairs. In a vast field far from any immediate danger, some fresh British Army recruits were seen practicing digging trenches in the mud. Their once tidy uniforms were now covered in dirt, their expressions serious and flushed with exertion. Having completed their training at Salisbury Plain, they were now stationed within earshot of the distant sounds of warfare. It was only a matter of time before they would be called to the front lines. As our vehicle passed by, a group of Belgian soldiers paused from their roadwork to watch us go by. The constant rotation of troops is a crucial aspect of military strategy, as the toll of continuous combat can wear down even the bravest soldiers.

More guns meant more soldiers. Walking along the narrow streets was challenging. We seized an opportunity and finally broke through, entering a random house. Since each house had soldiers staying in it, we were sure to find some. I was able to witness not just selected living spaces but random quarters. Passing through a narrow, white-washed hall with rooms on either side, and a muddy kitchen where a family was gathered around a stove, we reached a small, brick-paved yard. In the yard, there was a shed with a roof that still held the remaining winter coal supply. Two soldiers were cooking there, one watching the stew and peeling potatoes while the other read a letter aloud. Upon our arrival, the soldiers saluted, observing the unusual group that included a woman. Further inquiry revealed that one of the soldiers, aged twenty-two, would rest after feeding his company. The soldiers, true republicans, saluted the officers as equals. Another soldier, smiling nervously, was pushed forward to greet us. We proceeded to an open area with an old coach house where more soldiers who had just returned from the front were stationed. The coach house, now a ruin, was wet and muddy, a stark contrast to its condition when the troops arrived. The men, awakened by our arrival, were joking among themselves, showing us their caps damaged by war.|"['1.

"I understood the situation, although ""here"" felt like a humble place—a damp, cold, and dirty stable open to the elements, with army horses standing in mud. Despite the conditions, the soldiers were alive, received letters from home, and were content, anticipating a heroic charge against the Germans. The cook prepared meals over small fires, and the savory smells filled the air. I watched the cook peel potatoes with a knife that seemed more suited for battle. As we traveled through Woesten, we learned of a tragic incident where a shell struck a church, killing the priest. The landscape changed as we saw cavalry horses in groves and encountered an American horse near heavy guns. We felt far from home, a bit scared, but also connected in our shared unease. Finally, we reached the battlefield near Ypres, witnessing troops, motorcyclists, and distant German artillery."|['1. What was the setting of the stable where the soldiers were stationed?\nA.

The balloon was descending. I wanted to go up in it, but changed my mind when I saw it up close. Unlike English balloons with baskets, this one had two observers seated on a horizontal bar. An English airship expert warned me that riding a stationary balloon was a severe test, causing worse nausea than sea-sickness. So, I opted out of the balloon ride at Ypres. Instead, we watched as soldiers moved the balloon to a new spot. It ascended again, offering a view of the trenches. But the true action in war lies beyond the trenches. The French officers with me shared tales of remarkable bravery by soldiers like Philibert Musillat, who held his ground against a German attack for over twelve hours. These stories, including the gallant acts of young St. Cyr students, showcase the extraordinary courage displayed in wartime.|['1.

The Germans retreated, leaving the boy motionless on the ground, seemingly lifeless. They might have wished he was dead, a quicker end than suffering in No Man's Land. Eventually, the boy lifted his head. A car pulled up at the French Army's wireless and telephone headquarters, a modest brick building with a van of telephone equipment nearby. The van had vanished by the time they returned later. As the German broadcast from Berlin came in, the operator at the station tuned in. It was intriguing to imagine the German operator doing the same nearby. The station controlled all the army's batteries. The colonel welcomed them and agreed to show the batteries in action. Despite the proximity to the front, the area was surprisingly calm. The Germans were bombarding Ypres, but the narrator couldn't believe it was still standing.

When a large battery fires at an unseen enemy, a strange feeling arises. The air is calm one moment, with a peaceful plain and heavy cart horses moving steadily. But then chaos erupts as the great guns unleash death. Amidst the noise and smoke, lies the uncertainty of what lies beyond. As the battery fires, soldiers watch from a distance, while chickens roam nearby. Despite the danger, a cave with water below a flat roof is discovered. The gunners swiftly prepare the guns, ready to unleash their deadly shells. The narrator, unsure of the safety of being near the battery, contemplates the risks as shells continue to fall.|['1.

The soldiers who had gathered behind us in the field were smiling as I turned to look at them. Despite their hospitality of offering me the cellar full of water, I declined and felt it was time to move on. The honor of being the only woman at the front in Ypres weighed heavily on me. Mentioning the passing time and road conditions, I finally got into the car. As I left, the officers of the battery bowed, and the men cheered. I think of them now with a lump in my throat. Standing in the mud of the Ypres battlefield, they were smiling and cheery, despite the German shells bursting overhead. Many of them had been killed or wounded. The car moved away but slid into the mire, and we had to be dug out. It was a period of uneasiness for me, a reminder that even righteousness offers no protection against the horrors of war.|"['1.

I have observed various anti-aircraft stations during my time at the front lines. English stations were located near the coast and south of Ypres, while French batteries were mounted on the battlefield plain. These stations fired at enemy planes, although I never witnessed them causing any damage. Their primary role seemed to be to keep enemy scout planes at bay, making it challenging for the enemy to gather intelligence. The real threat to hostile aircraft came from French aviators who successfully drove off German planes. The German aviators, although brave and skilled, seemed to prioritize the preservation of their aircraft. I was intrigued by the operation of the anti-aircraft batteries, especially how they targeted fast-moving planes at varying heights. As we approached the battery, Captain Mignot, a tall and serious man, welcomed us. The young gunners, mostly boys, ceased their game of prisoner's base and quickly returned to their positions. Despite their youthful appearance, their clean-shaven faces gave them a sense of military discipline. The battery consisted of five guns arranged in a circle around a central platform with an instrument on a tripod.|['1.

"""We will pretend,"" he explained, ""that a German airplane is getting closer. To shoot accurately, we must first determine its height. So we figure that out with this."" He touched the telemeter. ""There are two openings, one for each eye. In one, the airplane appears right-side up. In the other, the image is flipped, upside down. Now! By turning this knob, the images are brought together until they perfectly overlap. Immediately, the altitude in meters is displayed on the lit-up dial below."" Next, he displayed the guns. These were the renowned seventy-five-millimeter guns of France, adapted for aircraft by placing them in a pit with inclined sides, pointing their noses upwards. To rotate them easily towards any part of the sky, a circular wooden frame provided a smooth track for the muzzles to move on. The gun practice commenced. It was done swiftly and expertly. There was no fumbling, not a single incorrect move or an unnecessary one, as they performed the actions of loading, aiming, and firing the guns. It was evident why French artillery is so well-regarded. The training of a French artilleryman is twice as rigorous as that of an infantryman. Each soldier, besides mastering his own role with the gun, must also be capable of performing the tasks of all the other eleven crew members.

In London, there are pictures I never received. The English government likely intercepted them, sparking unjust suspicions. The images were captivating, featuring Captain Mignot and officers from General Foch's staff, smiling French gunners, and expensive equipment like the telemeter. As we headed back from drill, the evening meal was being prepared with bacon and codfish, a change from the usual rations. The French soldiers seemed to be dining well in Ypres that night. Attempting to reach the advanced trenches, we faced heavy gunfire and barbed wire entanglements. The landscape was deceptive until we saw men in the trenches ahead. A captain pointed out the strategic importance of a location and the preparations for a German advance.

The trenches were known as the latest fashion not just for looks. They were divided every fifteen feet by a two-foot thick bulwark of earth to limit the damage from shells. The captain explained that without this protection, a shell could kill all men in the trench, but with the bulwark, only eight could be harmed. As the sun set in the west, the guns fired sporadically, and the smell of battle filled the air. The trench took on a loathsome feeling as the reality of war sank in. Despite the cruelty of the enemy, thoughts of German prisoners and a kind gardener named Wilhelm, who could have been a soldier, made the senseless killing seem even more tragic.|['1.

Wilhelm, a loyal German, is a Socialist who opposes war and believes in living to help others. Despite his peaceful beliefs, if the Kaiser commanded, he would have gone to war.

These men, like fathers and good citizens, never sought war but followed their country's call with unwavering faith. Passing a buried machine gun, discussions arose among officers about its strategic value. The scene was filled with exhaustion and weariness, as men prepared for the trenches under the purple and gold sunset. Returning, sentries with lanterns checked passes, while men lined up for duty.

In a grand church in Dunkirk, soldiers and sailors knelt in silent reverence, their thoughts too vast for words as they prayed for France's safety. Women gathered around the statue of Mater Dolorosa, while the Mass began with the sweet sound of choir boys' voices. Morning light flooded through stained-glass windows, illuminating the scene. As the private service ended, the market women packed up, and the sailor quietly left. The square outside, once bustling with war activity, transformed into a peaceful market. Geese and chickens squawked, and curious boys watched East Indians with interest. The vendors sold meager supplies of vegetables and eggs, reflecting the scarcity caused by the war.

At midday, the market closes, and the canvas booths are taken down. Unsold goods are returned to the farm. Dunkirk's market square returns to its usual look. Dunkirk residents enjoy rabbit and Brussels sprouts for lunch. French aviator Roland Garros chases a German aircraft. War has moments of lightness amid its grimness. Soldiers play games in the trenches. London seeks relief in comedy. In France, a British naval air station houses an airship. Visitors are warmly welcomed.

"I was thankful but not very excited. I had noticed the officers keeping an eye on the sky for German planes. I had a strong feeling that a German pilot flying above, armed with a Belgian block or a bomb, could have easily torn open that yellow envelope, potentially taking away a bright figure from American literature. Moreover, even during peaceful times, I feel anxious about looking out of a third-story window.

To enter the station, you need to cross a bridge over a canal. The bridge is guarded by soldiers, and you need the daily password to get inside. Canal boats, painted grey and armed with guns, line the canal in both directions. Alongside these gunboats are regular canal boats that serve as homes for some residents, with women knitting or hanging out laundry on the decks.

The station is constantly busy with traffic from a main road behind the lines. Chauffeurs stop by to borrow petrol or fix their cars, while officers from other stations visit to observe the airship in action. England has been slow to trust airships, preferring heavier-than-air machines. The officers at the naval air station use the administration building of the factory as their headquarters. They relax and chat in a long room with western windows, enjoying some downtime between their missions to the front lines.

The officers are in good spirits. Those with free time come from the gunboats to smoke a pipe by the fire. Occasionally, a woman on her way to help wounded soldiers stops by to warm up.

In the hangar, a crew of three men operates an aluminum car beneath a cigar-shaped bag. The pilot steers from the front, resembling a car's wheel, while the observer manages the wireless system. The engineer completes the trio. Messages are relayed via a wireless van following the airship. The region is divided into lettered and numbered squares for navigation. The airship's stability and weight-carrying capacity suggest its future potential. The crew faces alarm from German aircraft, seeking refuge in a dugout cave. The station, equipped with anti-aircraft defenses, has endured attacks. Despite its vulnerability, the airship represents the future of aviation.

He led me to the trenches, surprisingly comfortable spaces dug in the sand. They resembled rooms with shelves, dishes, egg cups, rows of glasses, silver spoons, neatly folded napkins, tidy beds with mattresses and warm blankets. The floor was boarded, a chair or two, and even periodicals and books were present. Outside, a vestibule of boards kept the wind out. Despite the luxurious setup, it served a purpose, strategically positioned with a barbed-wire barricade facing the main road crucial for the German Army's advance. The station showcased the British youth's patriotism, with individuals, including Honourables, taking on roles regardless of their background. The atmosphere changed when a German plane approached, and a lieutenant broke a windshield, leading to a discussion. Later, by a fire that smoked, officers unsuccessfully tried to fix it with a car hood. A piano, salvaged from a ruined house, was played by some officers by ear, held up by a bandage, with its German nameplate removed.|"[""1.

In a room, a long table took up the central space. At one end sat the press censorship bureau, responsible for checking and marking outgoing letters. At the other end, it served as a dining table. Above the fireplace mantle hung a baby's shoe, a poignant reminder of a town under siege. The mention of press-censor stamps triggered memories for an English officer who had resided in Belgium. He recalled the daring operation of smuggling letters to and from interned Belgians through Holland for a high price. These couriers risked their lives, disguising themselves to slip past sentries. The letters, addressed by number, ensured secrecy even if intercepted. Amidst the cozy setting of an English tea, war felt distant until an English novelist seeking shelter due to a broken-down car brought a reminder of the conflict outside.|"[""1.

Two women explained how they provided food to injured men at the front. They made soup with whatever meat and vegetables they could find and carried it to the grateful men.

Originally, there were three brave young aristocrats in this group who remained loyal to their family's honor. One of them was the daughter of an earl, honored for her bravery. However, she had left for a nearby town a couple of days earlier. Despite the danger, the group was commended for their courageous actions in the trenches, aiding the wounded until help arrived. As we gathered around the fire, tired officers joined us briefly to warm up. The conversation was casual, with muddy officers sharing their experiences.

The data given about the Belgian, English, and French percentages seemed official, but the source was unknown. The transition from casualties to hospitals and nurses was swift. While I praised the frontline nurses' efforts, one officer disagreed, suggesting rotating nurses every three months due to the challenging conditions they faced. I disagreed, believing that like soldiers, nurses develop a resilient philosophy to cope with suffering. As the clock neared seven, with dinner at eight, I faced a nine-mile drive on slippery, foggy roads. The car's lights reflected off the mist like a milky lake.

We asked for volunteers to help move the car onto the road, but even with twenty men pulling, it wouldn't budge. They had to give up and rush to catch up with their units. Amid the _fusées_, only the muffled sounds of feet and darker shadows hinted at the passing troops. The night was so dark that faces were indiscernible, except for the occasional glow of a cigarette. The soldiers trudged along the muddy, slippery roads, burdened with gear like pack animals. Each carried a rifle, bayonet, knapsack, canteen, and more.

The town we reached was no longer a lively place but a ruin with walls and roofs destroyed by shells. The officer described it as a museum of prehistoric fauna.

The hotel room was cold and empty. Officers came in, looked at me, and left. A French man in a military cape walked around, chatting with the canaries in a cage. I was sure he had authority from the army or police. I was annoyed and cautious about what I said. The man's intentions remained a mystery. The canaries sang, and a porter in a leather apron lit a fire. There was a smell of onions and soap, and a dog barked when I spoke English. Later, I learned how diplomacy eased relations between the English and French Armies. General Huguet, a tall and dark man, was polite but firm. He offered to take me to British Headquarters for lunch. I made quick arrangements and went with him in a remarkable car.

The host was delightful as I sat at his right during lunch. General Huguet sat at the other end of the table, and a young English nobleman, part of the field marshal's staff, joined a bit late. The Prince of Wales had recently visited the trenches. The meal was served by two soldier-servants, including red wine that the officers avoided. Conversations were lively, touching on public opinion in America, Germany's resources, and the war's duration. Opinions varied on the war's end, with some predicting a quick resolution once the Allies took the offensive. Confidence in eventual victory was shared, despite differing views on the war's length and outcome. Discussions also covered the French Algerian and Indian forces, American press views, and censorship challenges. Plans were made to visit Indian villages despite the rainy weather.|['1.

"There is a new and trendy English term gaining popularity in America, known as ""swank."" This word can be used as both a noun and a verb. When someone swanks, they are essentially showing off or being boastful. However, despite this definition, the author argues that true English people are not characterized by swank. In fact, the King and Queen of England set an example of simplicity and authenticity. The English individuals the author encountered, from various social circles, displayed a remarkable lack of arrogance. They were described as modest, unpretentious, and highly efficient. The English officers met at the frontlines were particularly noteworthy for their humility and genuine demeanor. The author recounts conversations with officers from the Belgian, French, and English armies, discussing significant battles and the conditions faced by troops, including challenges like frostbite.

"During World War I, Sir John French, a soldier, not a diplomat, praised the Indian subjects for their valuable assistance to the British Empire. The Ghurkas, with their distinctive appearance and disciplined nature, played a crucial role along the British front.

From the car, I peered out at a fascinating sight in the village center - a tall cross with a life-size Christ at a crossroads. Beneath it, a group of Indian Mohammedans, some holding horses they had been exercising despite the rain. Dressed in capes and turbans, they exuded dignity. Led by Makand Singh, we passed through a stable to his tidy living space. The kitchen was spotless, a cat lay by the stove. The Indian major, regal even seated, wore a khaki British Army uniform. He oversaw the making of coffee, his alert eyes and warm smile revealing his interest.

A new and puzzling sight appeared before us - a Frenchman dressed in a British uniform, living among Indian troops! It turned out he was a student from the Sorbonne in Paris, serving as an interpreter. These interpreters, who are unable to join the French Army for various reasons, work with the British forces to help bridge the language gap. They wear British uniforms with a slight modification to their caps. They are vital for communication, as many soldiers like Tommy Atkins find themselves in foreign lands where English is as foreign to the locals as French is to them. Imagine Tommy trying to warn a French comrade of an approaching danger but ending up saying something about ill-fitting trousers or wanting ice and cheese! It was an interesting mix of people gathered around a stove in a peasant woman's house, including an Indian major, a young English officer, a French interpreter, and the narrator. After a coffee break, we explored the village of Ham, observing the daily life of the Indian troops and the unique setting of the British front lines near Béthune and Ypres. While the narrator did not venture into the English trenches, they had a close encounter with the realities of war, surrounded by artillery fire and military operations. Despite the dangers, the experience was captivating and memorable. The highlight of the day was meeting the Field Marshal of the British Army, Sir John French, who left a lasting impression with his soldierly demeanor and commanding presence.|"['1.

Sir John also spoke about the remarkable spirit of all British troops under adverse weather conditions. He mentioned the challenges of the ongoing war, the new warfare tactics, and the potential risks of diseases due to improperly buried bodies. Although the Canadian troops were not yet at the front, Sir John would have likely praised their bravery.

The British people should be informed about the remarkable work of their army. Lord Kitchener should proudly share their brave acts, selflessness, and courage. By shedding light on their achievements, turning national pride into patriotism, we can remove recruiting posters from London's walls and hear the echoes of marching soldiers across England. The comfort and care provided to the army, the well-being felt, and the confidence inspired by the British Army are truly commendable. The officer accompanying me, a young man who had been through tough battles, exemplified the army's strength and resilience.

As we continued our journey, we once again came across the Indian troops. The weather had improved, and the roads were bustling with them. They were busy driving their small carts, cleaning their weapons in the sunshine, and appeared proud and dignified even while performing simple tasks. The Indians, with their quaint ammunition carts, observed our car with solemn expressions, especially at the sight of a woman inside. Alongside them were Scots in kilts, making up for the Indians' lack of curiosity with their cheerful boldness. Ghurkas were also present, carrying rifles and walking gracefully beside British soldiers driving forage carts. The Ghurkas, with their distinct appearance resembling the Japanese, looked fierce and determined. The officer explained the routine of the soldiers, highlighting the importance of food in maintaining their strength and readiness for battle.

"A group of artillery soldiers marched past in perfect synchronization; their faces were sharp and tanned. They were impressive, well-built men, as sharp as English artillery soldiers always are. I observed them as far as my eyes could follow. We had strayed from our path due to the rules of the traffic team. We had to pause and ask for directions. Eventually, we crossed a small bridge over the canal and proceeded along the front, behind the primary trenches and just ahead of the secondary line. For a short distance, the land was quite level. The gunfire was to our right, and the second line of trenches was to our left. The congestion of Béthune had transformed into the serene daylight atmosphere of the area just behind the trenches. There were scarce wagons and soldiers. Only occasional clouds from shrapnel bursts were visible. The British Army was protecting me, just as it had pledged! Nonetheless, there were barbed-wire obstacles everywhere, constructed taller than the French ones, I thought. Roads on the right led to the primary trenches, deserted roads that buzzed with men during the night heading to or coming back from the front. Occasionally, at intersections, we had to ask for directions. I had no desire to encounter danger, but a strong desire lingered to mistakenly steer the car and abruptly reach the primary trenches.

Unexpectedly, around a bend in the road, a convoy of Canadian trucks appeared, driven and guarded by Canadians. The sight of these familiar American-built vehicles manned by fellow Americans in Northern France filled me with a sense of longing. The eager faces of the Canadian troops as they moved forward, some setting up temporary barracks, and others cooking meals beside the road, painted a picture of readiness. Amidst the war-torn setting, a moment of peace arrived in the form of a cart pulled by white oxen loaded with sugar beets, salvaged by a resourceful local. Interestingly, to keep their cavalry fit during the harsh winter, the troops resorted to riding beagle hounds, a practice that was later discontinued due to objections from the French.

The soldiers' exposure to vermin contributes to their infections, prompting measures like using gasoline to combat them. Soldiers wounded in the trenches or no man's land between enemy lines often face challenges in receiving timely aid. Brave acts of rescue are common, with ambulance dogs aiding in locating the wounded. Injured soldiers receive basic first aid from their comrades until nightfall when they can be evacuated. Despite the ongoing fighting, the injured soldiers' primary need is water, which their fellow soldiers provide amidst the chaos. Night brings some respite from the artillery duels, but the soldiers still face the constant threat of enemy flares overhead.|['1. What has surprised the doctors about the soldiers in the text?\nA.

During wartime, the journey of injured soldiers on ambulances or transport vehicles is filled with horrors. The roads are destroyed, making careful driving impossible. In the darkness near the front, ambulances cannot have lights. Men die during transit, reminiscing about their loved ones. At railway stations, the dead and wounded are separated. Wounded soldiers receive makeshift treatments, sometimes under dim lighting. The arrival of wounded soldiers by train is met with silence and solemnity. There is no rush to disembark, only a quiet sense of urgency. The injured soldiers show remarkable patience, having endured long waits on battlefields and in trenches. Their resilience and stoicism in the face of pain and uncertainty are truly admirable.|['1.

He lay alone in a small room, once a girls' school. Propped up with pillows to breathe, his grey face contrasted his fiery eyes. Alone in a crowded hospital, he waited for help. The nurse returned, his eyes greeting her. Feeling helpless, I left, haunted by his gaze. The burden of war hit hard, as a Belgian woman mourned her brother's heroic death. The Red Cross brought a glimmer of hope amid the darkness of war, showing mercy and brotherly love.

During the war, I closely followed the Red Cross flag. It led me to the front lines, field hospitals, railway stations, and great base hospitals. I witnessed the dedication of its workers, from ambulance drivers on dangerous roads to stretcher-bearers carrying the wounded. The Red Cross symbolized unwavering service amidst the chaos of war, where treaties and strategies faltered. As a hospital training school graduate, I marveled at the selflessness and sacrifice of countless men and women, including English aristocrats scrubbing floors and American surgeons toiling tirelessly amid the sounds of battle. In a Calais hospital, I saw the convergence of French and British forces in a former girls' convent turned into a place of healing.

In hospitals, men face life and death. Some die in quiet dignity, shielded from view. Others pass without a screen, their deaths just one among many seen by these men. Once focused on work, rest, and love, now thoughts turn to survival. Will this change bring about coarseness or elevate souls? Some believe it will cleanse pettiness and broaden perspectives. Yet, is labor and love trivial? Is national duty above personal responsibility? Are individuals less than the whole? Rows of men wait in wards, the air heavy with antiseptic smells. Nurses and surgeons move with purpose, but true cheer is absent. Patients endure, some awaiting recovery, others uncertain of what lies ahead.

In a converted school turned hospital, the former children's lavatory now serves as an operating room. Rows of basins, once used by kids, are now slightly stained with red, holding surgical tools. Lockers that once stored caps and toys now hold torn uniforms and medical supplies. The impact of war is evident in the makeshift hospital, where the surgeon's son, a teen injured and taken prisoner, is recovering from a bullet wound and fractured thigh. The father, a surgeon himself, traveled through enemy lines to be by his son's side, showcasing the lengths a parent would go for their child's well-being.

During the war, a father risked everything to save his son by taking him in a wagon to the hospital. Disguised as a farmer, they traveled to Holland and then to Calais by boat. Despite a German bullet in the boy's carotid artery, they managed to remove it in Calais. The hospitals they visited were once schools, now transformed into wards. Nuns, who no longer wore their traditional habits, worked tirelessly to care for the wounded soldiers. The nuns faced challenges like the high cost of food, making it difficult to provide proper meals. The Belgians struggled with contaminated water, leading to concerns about water supply for the troops. Efforts were made to sterilize water using methods like boiling, ozone, and violet rays to ensure the soldiers had safe drinking water.|['1.

Some may never understand the harsh realities faced by soldiers on the battlefield, where water is a luxury. The Belgian Army, lacking funds, struggles to provide clean water for its troops. With no resources for sterilizers or filters, soldiers rely on contaminated sources. The dire situation is reminiscent of a siege, with no relief in sight. In contrast, British troops have managed to prevent typhoid by prioritizing water safety. The Belgian Army, however, faces great challenges due to the war's toll on their resources. A quarter of a million dollars could transform their water supply, but the burden seems insurmountable. Perhaps a generous individual could offer the gift of clean water to ease the suffering of wounded soldiers. The reality of war's devastation is palpable in places like Dunkirk, where a hospital ship now cares for mutilated soldiers. The young officer, facing life with a lost leg, gazes out to sea, his pain and loss etched on his face.|"['1.

We descended below deck. As we emerged at the top of the stairs, those recovering below stood up respectfully. In a row at the end of their beds stood boys and seasoned soldiers, wearing a mix of clothes, leaning on crutches, sticks, or the back of a chair. These men, without a homeland, faced an uncertain future after the hospital ship. Some able ones would return to the army, but what about those who would never fully recover? The limits of mercy were clear. France couldn't care for them; even Belgian refugees were discouraged. Most would likely head to England, a kind but foreign land, where they would wait once more. The hospital wait would turn into a refugee's wait. Despite the somber tone, there were bright spots in hospital stories. Advances in treating tetanus with serum and open fracture treatments had saved many limbs. The focus was on preserving rather than amputating, marking a shift in surgical approach. A boy with shattered leg bones in a French hospital had his limbs restored through meticulous surgery, leaving no deformities. Railway stations served as temporary havens for injured soldiers, with one near the trenches at E---- exemplifying the care provided during a lull in fighting.|['1.

In a small village station, exhausted men rested on straw-covered floors after leaving the trenches. Nearby, women cooked soup in a tiny room, serving it to the hungry men from multiple kettles. In the waiting room, slightly injured men walked about or slept on benches. A young artist drew on the walls with colored crayons, depicting priests, soldiers, and caricatures. Despite the nearby firing, the men appreciated the boy's talent. Outside, soldiers filled the streets as spring approached. Amid the chaos, a sow escaped from a butchering area, chased by laughing men. As evening fell, the bombardment stopped, revealing the destruction in the shelled town. Despite the devastation, some residents returned, like a shoemaker reopening his shop and women gathered around a candle.|"['1.

He described how he had sealed off a small cellar entrance. His family, having no other refuge, was returning from the fields, where they had sought shelter, to spend the night in the cellar. Leaving a small opening to be closed with sandbags, in case the house collapsed during the night, allowing them to escape. He knelt in front of the house, a patient figure, uninvolved in politics, indifferent to war and diplomacy, adapting to new and terrifying circumstances. I remembered a story of the evacuation of Antwerp, featuring a tall American nurse called Morning Glory. When a young lieutenant asked to introduce her, I was excited. It was indeed Morning Glory, a Southern girl. Amidst the chaos of war, makeshift hospitals in France struggled with shortages of supplies, nurses, and coal due to the ongoing conflict.

On the 5th of September in 1914, a significant battle known as the Marne began. The French, along with their allies, resumed the offensive after a strategic retreat. In a small village called D----, during the first week of September, a train arrived at the station, carrying wounded soldiers. The lack of resources in the village led to the chemist, who had some medical knowledge, taking charge. Women and children helped transport the wounded on hand carts to the school. Despite poverty and limited supplies, the villagers cooked nutritious meals for the injured on a small stove. The schoolrooms served as makeshift hospitals with soldiers lying on beds covered in patchwork quilts. The villagers made do with whatever they had, even using old scraps for bandages.

This is not a unique situation, nor is it an exaggerated one. There are many details I choose not to disclose. Over three hundred similar hospitals exist. The French Government provides, or will provide, twenty-five cents daily for the care of these individuals. They can only afford black bread and _pot-à-feu_ with this budget. Recovering patients sit up in bed and painstakingly unravel their worn-out socks to salvage the yarn. They then piece the strands together, sometimes only a few inches long, to knit new soles onto old socks or, if they gather enough material, entirely new socks. The Germans control the wool-producing cities in France, where worsted typically costs between eighteen and nineteen francs per pound. Many French government wool reserves for soldiers were in these captured locations, and German captives were discovered wearing French government-branded woolens. Various structures, such as garages, town halls, private homes, and schools, are repurposed as these isolated hospitals. Initially lacking chloroform and proper tools, some hospitals had to resort to using automotive tools, kitchen knives, saws, or any available items in emergencies. On a cold March day, two hundred recovering patients were recalled to remove excess bandages from their wounds to reuse them when a hundred new wounded soldiers arrived. These hospitals heavily rely on untrained village women for nursing care, resulting in fundamental hospital practices being overlooked.

Efforts are underway to improve the conditions in French hospitals. A compassionate Frenchwoman, distressed by the cries of patients enduring surgeries without anesthesia, sought help in England.

During times of war, the humanities, which encompass compassion and mercy, are crucial. In the midst of suffering and death, individuals can become desensitized. However, in moments of despair, nations and people often turn to a Higher Power for solace. In France and Belgium, the devastation of war has led to a resurgence in faith. Priests have played a vital role, offering comfort and aid to the wounded on battlefields and in hospitals. The boy scouts of England also made significant contributions during the early days of the conflict, assisting with evacuations and providing support in various capacities.
