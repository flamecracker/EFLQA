In a peaceful homestead, the field-cornet watches his children with joy. Hans tends the garden, Jan helps, Hendrik cares for the horses, and Truey plays with her pet fawn. The field-cornet's heart is full of pride, but a hint of sorrow lingers when he sees Gertrude. Swartboy, a loyal servant saved by the field-cornet, saddles horses with Hendrik. Swartboy, a Hottentot, was abandoned to die but was rescued and has since served faithfully. Swartboy and Hendrik ride out to bring the livestock back before nightfall, a routine to protect them from predators.

As young Hendrik and Swartboy rode off to fetch the horses and cattle, Hans left his work in the garden to gather the sheep and guide them home. Walking with little Jan beside him, Hans felt proud seeing his family working hard. He especially admired Hendrik's horsemanship, reminiscent of his own youth. While watching Hendrik and Swartboy in the distance, a strange sight caught Von Bloom's attention. A peculiar dust or smoke-like appearance in the sky puzzled him. It was unlike anything he had seen before, causing concern among the family. As the riders approached, it became clear that they were coming from a vast swarm of migratory locusts, a rare and unsettling sight for everyone except Swartboy, who had witnessed such events before.|['1.

Contrary to what was initially feared, the man's face lit up with joy as he saw a swarm of locusts approaching. The dogs joined in the excitement, barking and howling, ready for what seemed like a hunt. Even the children, Truey and Jan, were amused by the sight of the locusts, knowing they were harmless insects. However, the man's joy turned to concern as he realized the potential threat the locusts posed to his crops. His fields of maize, buckwheat, and fruits were at risk of being devoured by the insects. As the locusts moved closer, the man's hope was restored by the wind blowing in a favorable direction, possibly steering the swarm away from his farm.

"A strange and fascinating scene unfolded before Von Bloom and Hendrik. The sky was darkened not only by a swarm of insects but also by a variety of birds. Among them were the large African vultures like the brown ""oricou"" and the yellow ""chasse fiente."" The air was filled with the majestic ""lamvanger"" and the fierce ""Caffre eagle."" Hawks, kites, crows, and ravens were also present, along with the peculiar ""bateleur."" However, the most abundant were the tiny ""springhaan-vogel,"" speckled birds resembling swallows. These ""locust-vultures"" fed exclusively on the insects, following them wherever they went. The horizon was covered with the blackened bodies of the locusts as far as the eye could see. As night approached, the birds scattered, and the earth fell silent. The cattle, unfazed by the insects, were devouring them eagerly. Von Bloom and Hendrik were amazed to witness this peculiar sight."|"['1.

The group had a tough time driving off the insects, but the sound of a lion and Swartboy's whip helped. They were cautious due to the abundance of snakes. The field-cornet was anxious as the wind could bring locusts to ravage his crops. The night was tense, fearing for the cattle too. Von Bloom checked the wind, but it stayed the same. The moonlight revealed the vast swarm of locusts. Amidst the chaos, the lion's roar, jackals, and hyenas could be heard. Swartboy shared his knowledge about locusts, explaining their origins and habits. The conversation turned to using fires to deter locusts, but Hendrik doubted its effectiveness against creatures with wings.|"[""1.

Hans explained that fires are lit to prevent wingless locusts, known as _voetgangers_ (foot-goers), from swarming. These locusts are actually larvae before developing wings. They crawl and leap like grasshoppers, migrating in a straight line, overcoming obstacles like streams and walls. When faced with broad rivers, many are swept away, while smaller groups are deterred by fires. However, when large numbers advance, even fires can't halt them. The flying locusts are more wind-guided, often ending up in the sea. In Africa, farmers fear locust invasions as they devastate crops, likening it to a calamity. Truey asked if these were the locusts John the Baptist ate in the desert, as mentioned in the Bible.|['1.

Hans modestly explained to his father that while the locusts mentioned in Scripture were not exactly the same as those in South Africa, they were similar in habits. Some believe the locusts were actually beans from the locust-tree, not insects. However, Hans firmly believed that Saint John ate the insect locusts, not the fruit. He pointed out that locusts and wild honey were often eaten together by desert tribes, as mentioned in Scripture. Hans, well-versed in locust literature, praised the Bible's account of these insects. He fetched the family Bible, a cherished book among Dutch colonists, and read a passage from the prophet Joel about a devastating locust invasion. Swartboy added that in South Africa, locusts are a vital food source for various animals, birds, and even the mighty elephant.|"['1.

The Bushmen and other native tribes in Africa have a unique way of preparing locusts for consumption. Swartboy spent the evening cooking the locusts he had collected. He first steamed them with a small amount of water for two hours, then dried them and removed the legs and wings by shaking them in a pan. After a winnowing process, the locusts were ready to eat with just a little salt to enhance the flavor. Some children even enjoyed them, finding them similar to shrimps. For many tribes, the arrival of locusts is a cause for celebration. They collect them in sacks and store them in their villages like grain. The night passed with discussions about locusts until it was time for bed. The field-cornet, anxious about the locusts, barely slept and woke early to find that the wind was blowing from the west, carrying the scent of the locusts.|['1.

A gloom covered everyone's faces as their leader remained silent and dejected. The day before, they were happy. Swartboy mentioned that the locusts couldn't fly in cold or rainy weather. They hoped for rain or a cloudy day to stop the locusts, but the sun rose, warming the locusts and making them fly towards the maize fields. The locusts covered everything like black snow, causing devastation. Von Bloom and his family stayed indoors to avoid the locusts. After two hours, when they looked outside, they saw the destruction caused by the locusts. The fields were stripped bare, trees were leafless, and the once-green landscape turned into a desolate desert. The locusts had ravaged everything in just two hours.|"['1.

The field-cornet, Von Bloom, faced a dilemma after a devastating locust swarm destroyed his crops. His children, unaware of the severity of the situation, watched their father's distress. Von Bloom, despite his faith, knew he needed to take action to save his family. He realized they couldn't survive without food for their livestock. With a heavy heart, he decided to leave their kraal in search of pasture. Quickly, he made the choice to prepare the wagon for the journey, knowing time was of the essence. Swartboy, a trusted helper, readied the yoke-oxen as Von Bloom inspected the wagon, a prized possession from better days. Once a symbol of prosperity, the wagon was now their lifeline as they faced an uncertain future.|"[""1.

As Swartboy and Hendrik rounded up the twelve yoke-oxen for the wagon, the field-cornet, with the help of Hans, Totty, Truey, and little Jan, loaded up the furniture and tools. It was a quick job since the kraal possessions were few and soon stored on or around the spacious vehicle. The direction they chose was crucial. Heading towards where the locusts had gone might mean no grass for miles, risking the cattle's and their own lives. The settlements lay east, but the locusts had likely devoured everything there. North was the Kalahari desert, a barren choice. Von Bloom considered the west. Forty miles away was a spring with good pasture he knew of, a better location for cattle. Swartboy was directed to steer west, crack his whip, and lead the way. The caravan moved on with Swartboy's voice and whip echoing across the plain, guiding them towards potential safety.|"[""1.

"Sometimes the boys were asked to assist Swartboy with the leading oxen when they misbehaved. Hans or Hendrik would quickly ride up, correct the oxen's direction, and use the ""jamboks"" to discipline them. A ""jambok"" is a long whip made from rhinoceros or hippopotamus skin, about six feet in length, used to control stubborn oxen. Swartboy's long whip also helped, but Hendrik's jambok was more effective in scaring the oxen into behaving. Von Bloom guided the caravan, dressed in traditional boor attire with a large felt hat, leather trousers, and a robe of leopard-skin.

For a full twenty miles, the plain was completely barren. The animals couldn't find any food or water. The sun was scorching, like in the tropics, making it hard for the travelers to bear, despite a constant breeze blowing. Unfortunately, the wind carried dust from the dry land, making the journey difficult. The locusts had loosened the earth, creating clouds of dust that covered the caravan, making progress tough. By nightfall, they were all thirsty, regretting not bringing water. Von Bloom blamed himself for the oversight, feeling sad and remorseful. They couldn't travel at night due to tired oxen and the danger of lions. They needed to rest, and the oxen were weak from hunger. Von Bloom realized he should have collected locusts for the oxen. They decided to halt, unsure of the direction and the danger of traveling at night.|['1.

A cry from the sharp-eyed Bushman brought excitement. He spotted grass ahead and some bushes with leaves! Though still a mile away, the oxen picked up their pace as if they understood. Another mile passed, and they found grass, but it was scarce. The poor animals were teased by the sight but couldn't fill their bellies. Von Bloom was relieved they had left the locusts behind. The land was barren due to lack of water. They should have built pens for the animals, but everyone was too tired. They hoped the animals wouldn't wander far from the campfire. By morning, all the animals had vanished except the milch-cow. They decided to head to the spring first and then return for the lost animals.|"['1.

"When everything was prepared, Swartboy once again climbed onto the front of the wagon, gathered the reins, cracked his whip, and the team started moving. The heavy wagon, loaded with supplies, glided off smoothly, much to everyone's joy. Von Bloom, Hendrik, and Hans cheered as it passed by, while they herded the milch-cow, sheep, and goats behind. Little Jan and Truey remained in the wagon while the rest walked alongside to lighten the load on the horses. Thirst plagued them, but the cow, ""old Graaf,"" provided milk that eased their discomfort. The horses, despite incomplete harness, pulled the wagon effortlessly, sensing their master's need and the nearby spring. Soon, they arrived at a lush valley with a cool spring where they quenched their thirst, dined on mutton, and rested. Von Bloom's mind was restless, worried about his missing cattle, and he planned to ride back with Hendrik and Swartboy to find them. They rode through the night, stopping briefly to rest and eat before continuing their journey, following the tracks of their lost animals under the moonlight."|"['1.

As the sun rose, the familiar homestead appeared different. The locust invasion had altered its look, but now, strange objects lined the roof and walls. Von Bloom questioned what they were as they approached the eerie sight. Vultures circled above half-eaten carcasses scattered around. Von Bloom recognized his lost herd among the remains. Lions, hyenas, and jackals had attacked the cattle due to the scarcity of game caused by the locusts. The predators were still close by, evidenced by their fresh tracks. Despite the desire for revenge, Von Bloom knew it was unsafe to linger. They quickly watered their horses and left, knowing the predators would return.

The lion's behavior when faced with the horsemen passing by the kraal was a strategic move to avoid confrontation, showcasing the lion's reasoning abilities akin to a human's. Contrary to common misconceptions, lions do not always exhibit cowardice but rather assess situations based on various factors like age, hunger, and the type of hunters in the area. Just like dogs vary in character, lions too display differences in courage and ferocity influenced by external factors. The lion's behavior towards hunters is shaped by experience, much like how alligators in different regions have adapted to human presence. Lions in Cape districts, for instance, may exhibit varying levels of bravery based on their encounters with hunters. The color of a lion's mane, like black or yellow, is often mistakenly linked to their courage, highlighting the importance of understanding individual differences within species.|"[""1.

Von Bloom was determined to confront the lion that had attacked his precious oxen and cattle. Despite the danger, he dismounted from his horse and took aim at the lion with his roer. The lion, with blood-stained muzzle and whiskers, lay still until Von Bloom fired. The shot hit the lion, causing it to leap into the air with a scream. In a matter of seconds, the lion closed the distance between them, but Von Bloom quickly mounted his horse and rode away. The lion, enraged and fierce, chased after them, its mane erect, teeth bared, and roaring furiously. The horsemen had to gallop away to avoid the lion's attack, leaving the beast behind them.|"['1.

None of the three were terrified out of their senses. Hendrik covered the lion with his rifle, took aim, and fired. Simultaneously, Swartboy shot an arrow through the air. The lion, previously brave, now seemed scared and fled into the kraal. Seeking shelter there showed his cleverness; there was no other cover nearby. The lion knew the house was empty, having prowled around it all night. As the lion entered the kraal, jackals fled through a window, startled by his entrance. The dogs, unaware of the lion until the chaos, joined the fray. A cacophony of sounds ensued, ending in a mournful howl and silence, indicating the end of the struggle. The dogs likely did not survive.|"['1.

The hunters felt intense anxiety as they listened to the sounds of a fierce battle behind the door. They called out for their dogs, hoping to see them emerge, but they realized the dogs had perished in the combat. Swartboy, a Bushman, came up with a clever plan to secure the lion inside the house. He used a cord attached to an arrow to shoot and lodge it near the door latch. This distracted the lion, causing it to growl angrily but not reveal itself. Swartboy remained ready to retreat in case the lion sprang out. Despite the danger of approaching the door or window, Swartboy's quick thinking showcased his hunter-craft intelligence, proving his worth in the face of adversity.|"['1.

Swartboy pulled the string tight, tested it, and successfully closed the door with a latch. The only way to free the lion was to cut the door. Hendrik shot an arrow to release the string, allowing Swartboy to shoot another arrow through the window. The lion was trapped inside a dark room with no way to shoot at it. Von Bloom considered cutting holes in the door and window, but it would take too long. Instead, they decided to set the house on fire. The roof was thatched and would burn quickly. The smoke might suffocate the lion before the fire reached it. They were ready to light the house to end the lion's threat quickly.|"['1.

There was a lot of rubbish left, the firewood the locusts hadn't eaten. This wood would help them with their plan. All three started moving it, piling it against the door. The lion seemed to understand what they were up to. After being quiet, he began roaring again. The noise of the logs hitting the door may have triggered it. The lion was trapped and eager to escape. They could hear him moving around, trying to break free. Despite their fears, they kept working, ready to mount their horses if needed. They planned to watch the fire from a safe distance once it started. They piled up all the wood and bush in front of the door. As Swartboy was about to light the fire, they heard a strange scratching from inside. It was the lion clawing at the wall. The lion's voice changed, sounding distant and muffled. Suddenly, the lion's roar came from above them. They looked up to see the lion's head emerging from the chimney. The lion was pulling himself out. Von Bloom and Hendrik quickly fired their guns, and the lion fell dead.|"['1.

Von Bloom and his companions hastily rode off without skinning the lion they had killed. As they rode, they chatted about lions. Swartboy, an expert due to growing up in the bush, shared his knowledge. Lions are easily recognizable by their appearance and mane. The lioness is smaller without the mane. Lions vary in size and mane thickness, with different species found across Africa and Asia. The maneless lion's existence is debated. Lions are not forest animals like panthers or leopards; they prefer open plains and bushy areas to hunt. Lions feed on various animals they hunt themselves and are not reliant on jackals for food, despite common beliefs.|"[""1.

Lions are formidable predators known for their cunning tactics and powerful leaps. With a unique anatomical structure that allows them to spring incredible distances, lions can surprise and overpower their prey. They fearlessly take down animals much larger than themselves, including rhinoceroses and young elephants. However, their hunting habits often lead to conflicts with farmers whose livestock they prey upon. While some see lions as a threat and actively hunt them, others, like the Bushmen tribes, view them as providers. These tribes track lions to scavenge leftover kills, relying on them for a source of food. Despite the danger they pose, the Bushmen have learned to coexist with lions, seeing them as essential hunters in their environment.|['1.

The group arrived at the same dark spot as the previous night. The sky was covered in thick clouds, hinting at a possible rainstorm. The hungry horses searched for grass, but there was none. Von Bloom recognized familiar trees, ensuring they were on the right path. Concerned about the children left behind, they pressed on to find water. After hours of travel, they couldn't locate the camp. Exhausted, they decided to rest until daylight. Von Bloom, unable to sleep, anxiously awaited the sunrise.

It seemed like their wagon in the distance, but doubts arose from the appearance of the place. The valley where they had camped was lush and green, unlike the brown, barren valley before them. Swartboy noticed tracks covering the plain, revealing a massive migration of springbok antelope had passed through. The missing sheep and goats were explained by this event.

Around midday, thoughts of dinner crossed my mind after a satisfying breakfast. Reluctant to hunt another sheep, I left Jan and Truey by the wagon and Totty in charge of the flock. With my gun in hand, I set off on foot to seek game, spotting springboks in the distance. The plain was a spectacle of graceful gazelles in motion, leaping and browsing. As they drew nearer, I observed their elegant forms, cinnamon backs, and lyre-shaped horns. Taking aim, I fired, causing the doe to fall. Surprisingly, the others remained unfazed, continuing their peaceful grazing. It dawned on me that this was a migration, a `trek-boken,' explaining their unusual behavior. Surrounded by the herd, I found myself in a peculiar yet unthreatening situation, unable to move faster than the advancing animals.|['1.

As I moved closer to the group of animals, trying to push through them, they jumped and leaped over each other, hindering my progress. Despite my attempts to clear a path with my gun, they were too slow. Just as I was about to break through, I noticed a large open space ahead. As I approached, I found the animals even more tightly packed. Suddenly, I saw a yellow lion in the center, causing the disruption in the herd. Feeling scared and unsure, I debated whether to shoot the lion but decided against it to avoid a dangerous situation. The lion then turned away, allowing me a chance to escape as it pounced on an antelope. Thankfully, the lion was preoccupied with its prey, giving me the opportunity to retreat safely.|"[""1.

In the African wilderness, Von Bloom faced a challenging situation. His flock of sheep and goats had vanished, leaving only the cows and horses with no grass to feed on. Tracking the springboks, who had mixed with his animals, seemed futile. Swartboy confirmed the difficulty of finding them amidst the vast herds. The horses were hungry, surviving on meager mimosa leaves. Despite the desolate landscape, Hans managed to secure two springboks for a meal, providing much-needed sustenance. As the weary travelers rested and refreshed near a spring, they observed vultures circling a distant yellow mass—the lion they had hunted. The carnivores wasted no time devouring the lion, revealing the harsh reality of nature's hierarchy. Von Bloom, accompanied by Swartboy, set out early on horseback, leaving the family behind to await their return, hoping to find a solution to their predicament.|"[""1.

They rode westward, guided by the springboks' direction from the north. Von Bloom spotted cliffs to the north, a sign of potential water nearby. Riding closer, he saw a beautiful landscape with grassy plains, mimosa copses, and towering trees. The area contrasted with the nearby barren desert of Kalihari. Despite his current troubles, Von Bloom focused on finding a place to rest his horses. Spotting guinea-hens and parrots, he followed them to a large tree where he found a crystal fountain. The sight lifted his spirits, and he and his horse quenched their thirst, grateful for the oasis in the midst of the harsh terrain.|"[""1.

"The field-cornet decided to let his horse graze for an hour before heading back to the wagon. He admired the giant ""nwana"" tree with its wide canopy and large fruits.

"Little Truey was overjoyed by the sight of numerous beautiful flowers surrounding the spring.

It was almost sunset, and the horses were grazing freely when Von Bloom noticed their increasing agitation. They were stomping and snorting, and upon closer inspection, Von Bloom, along with Hans and Hendrik, saw that the horses were surrounded by a swarm of brown insects resembling gad-flies. These insects were biting and stinging the horses, causing them great distress. The Bushman, Swartboy, explained that these flies were fatal, and the horses would not survive their bites. By the next day, the horses were swollen and in pain, indicating their impending death.

"The rhinoceros species in Africa are diverse. The Javan species resembles the Indian with scutellae and one horn but lacks the folds seen in the Indian species. The Sumatran rhinoceros has no folds or scutellae, with a slightly hairy skin and two horns resembling those of African species. Native hunters in South Africa recognize four distinct rhinoceros species, each with unique names. These hunters provide valuable insights into animal behavior compared to mere speculations of closet-naturalists. Gordon Cumming, a renowned hunter, has identified four rhinoceros types in Southern Africa: ""borele,"" ""keitloa,"" ""muchocho,"" and ""kobaoba.""

The rhinoceros, despite being a land creature, has a fondness for water, much like the hippopotamus. They often wallow in mud, giving them a muddy appearance. During the day, they relax under the shade of trees, either napping or resting lazily. At night, they venture out for food and water. Their keen sense of smell makes them alert to any approaching danger. The kobaoba rhinoceros, resembling a caricature of an elephant, is the second-largest quadruped after the elephant. With its massive body and broad muzzle, it exudes strength and grandeur. Von Bloom and Hendrik contemplate hunting the rhinoceros for food and resources, but the task is daunting without proper equipment.

The elephant had fallen with a loud splash into the water, sending waves across the lake. The hunters, ready to shoot, saw the massive beast rock, stagger, and then roll over. With a hole from a rhinoceros horn in its side, the elephant lay dead, its tusks gleaming in the sun. The hunters approached, Swartboy carrying tools for butchering. Von Bloom, standing by, gazed at the tusks, knowing their worth. The children, Truey and Jan, were called out to see the spectacle.

"""Yes,"" said the field-cornet, ""I estimate each tusk at a weight of one hundred pounds. With ivory selling at four shillings and sixpence per pound, these two could fetch between forty and fifty pounds in sterling money."" Hendrik questioned who they could sell the tusks to, being far from settlements. The field-cornet suggested there were more elephants around, and with their guns and ample ammunition, they could hunt for more ivory. Von Bloom was optimistic, believing that God had sent them this wealth amidst their hardships and that more would come. The children cheered at their father's happiness, as they envisioned a prosperous future. The field-cornet decided to become a professional elephant hunter, anticipating both thrilling hunts and substantial profits.

"The cow produced abundant milk on the lush pasture. The milk was so delicious that everyone received a generous portion. Elephants are well-known creatures, but there are two distinct types: the African and Asiatic elephants. The African elephants have huge ears that meet above their shoulders and hang below their breast, while the Indian elephants have smaller ears. The tusks of the African elephants are much larger, sometimes weighing close to two hundred pounds, compared to the Indian elephants whose tusks rarely reach one hundred pounds. The African elephants also have tusks in females, unlike the Indian elephants where females either have no tusks or very small ones. There are other differences between the two, including the number of toes and the shape of their front. Additionally, there are variations within the Asiatic elephants, with two main castes known as ""coomareah"" and ""merghee."" The coomareah is compact and strong, while the merghee is taller with longer legs. White elephants, which are albino, are highly valued in some Asian countries. Indian elephants are found in many southern Asian countries and are used as domestic animals. In contrast, African elephants are only found in the wild and are not tamed due to the lack of civilization in African nations."|['1.

"The African elephant, like its Indian relative, can be tamed and trained for various tasks. Historically, Carthaginian armies used African elephants in warfare. These majestic creatures once roamed freely from Abyssinia to Senegal and even as far south as the Cape of Good Hope. However, due to ivory hunters armed with long guns, their habitat has shrunk. Some believed Abyssinian elephants were Indian elephants, but this misconception has been corrected. There are likely different variations of African elephants across the continent, with larger ones found in tropical regions. Hunters fear a tuskless and aggressive type known as ""koes-cops."" While elephant meat is edible since they are herbivores, it may not be as tasty as other meats due to their diet. The Von Bloom family decided to cure the elephant meat for future consumption, as it could provide a reliable food source."|['1.

After extracting the ivory and storing it safely, Von Bloom and Swartboy began the serious task of butchering the elephant. Von Bloom and Swartboy were the main butchers, while Hans and Hendrik assisted. They focused on the upper half of the carcass as it was sufficient for their needs. They removed the thick outer coat and several layers of tough skin. The skin was discarded as they had enough water vessels. They then peeled off the pure flesh, separated it from the ribs, and removed the ribs to access the valuable fat around the intestines. Swartboy climbed into the carcass to remove the intestines. The feet were separated, and the meat was cut into strips for preservation. Swartboy had a secret method to preserve the feet, involving digging a hole and placing the feet inside before covering it with earth.|"[""1.

Under the direction of Swartboy, the boys gathered a large amount of dry branches and logs. Swartboy then constructed four pits and set them ablaze. As the fires burned down, he began the challenging task of clearing the hot coals from the first pit. With Von Bloom's help, they dropped a huge foot into the pit and covered it with sand and cinders. After a night of work, the feet would be ready for consumption or preservation. As they finished their meal and prepared to rest, strange voices interrupted the night. The familiar sounds of jackals and hyenas surrounded the camp, causing unease among the tired group.

Von Bloom, Hans, and Hendrik, along with Swartboy, armed themselves as a group of hyenas approached. The hunters realized the hyenas were attracted by the elephant meat hanging from the poles. To prevent the hyenas from stealing the meat, they decided to raise the poles higher out of reach. Hans came up with the idea to splice the uprights to make them taller. They quickly implemented the plan, raising the meat beyond the hyenas' grasp. Frustrated, the hyenas attempted to reach the meat but failed.

After many tries, jumping as high as possible, they seemed to get disheartened. They might have imitated the fox with the grapes and left quietly. But Von Bloom, angry at being woken from his rest, wanted revenge. He signaled the others, and a shot was fired from behind the tree. The sudden noise made the hyenas and jackals scatter. Their footsteps could be heard as they ran off. The ground was checked under the scaffold, and two large hyenas and one smaller one were found dead. The animals had discovered the elephant carcass in the lake and were feasting on it. The camp could hear them splashing in the water all night. Von Bloom and his crew didn't stay up to listen. The next morning, the hyenas and jackals were gone, and the elephant bones were picked clean. Two horses were also taken down during the night. The area was teeming with ravenous creatures, evidence of abundant game. Tracks around the water showed various animals had been there, including lions. Not much work was done that day. Swartboy cleaned the elephant's feet, and Von Bloom put the remaining horses out of their misery. The cow was the only livestock left and was cared for diligently. She provided precious milk for their diet. Each day she was taken to graze and locked in a thorn kraal at night. The kraal was well-protected, even lions would hesitate to enter.|"['1.

"On that day, another lovely pet joined the group, a tiny fawn, as beautiful as the springbok but even smaller. It was an ""ourebi"" fawn, a delicate antelope from the plains and bushes of Southern Africa. Hendrik, their friend, not only brought this pet but also treated them to a delicious venison dinner that day, which they all enjoyed more than elephant meat. Hendrik had shot the venison with his rifle after spotting two unfamiliar small creatures on a grassy meadow near the camp. They were a buck and a doe, likely antelopes. Hendrik tried to sneak closer but realized they were shy and kept feeding upwind, making it hard to approach. He then had an idea to use a decoy to lure them closer, but to his dismay, the decoy he needed was missing from his pocket."|['1.

He searched his pockets but couldn't find his handkerchief, realizing he left it in the wagon. Feeling annoyed, he recalled a trick about antelopes being attracted to strange movements. With a quick idea, he placed his rifle down, flipped upside down, and kicked his feet in the air to mimic the strange movements. The antelopes were puzzled by this odd display and ran off swiftly.

Jan was abruptly awakened by a loud squeak, resembling an animal in distress. Another cry, different from the first, startled them all. It was Jan's voice, followed by sounds of a scuffle. Jan's calls grew fainter, indicating he was being taken away. Swartboy's urgent barks redirected their attention. They found Jan near bushes, holding a thong tied to a dead fawn, with Swartboy brandishing a flaming tree after a confrontation with a hyena. Jan, aside from scratches, was unharmed.

Finally, Swartboy suggested sleeping. Jan agreed, but only if he could sleep next to Swartboy without sharing his blanket. Jan said he felt cold in the wagon, which was why he came to the fire. Swartboy hesitated but eventually agreed. Jan went back to the wagon, got his blankets, and lay down near Swartboy with the ourebi nearby. He had tied a rope around the ourebi's neck and his wrist to keep it close. Suddenly, Jan woke up to the ourebi screaming and being dragged away by a large black animal.

The hyena is often considered the ugliest and most brute-like of all wolves. Some early writers even linked them to the baboons, known for their extreme ugliness. The hyena's reputation for mystery and horror led to false stories, such as its ability to fascinate with its glance or imitate the human voice. Despite these myths, some have a basis in reality. For instance, the hyena's voice closely resembles certain human voices, leading to the belief that it can imitate them. The striped hyena, the most common species, has an ashy grey coat with dark stripes and a shaggy mane that stands on end when excited.

"The hyena comes in various species, each with its own distinct characteristics. The common hyena, known as the weakest and least ferocious, feeds mainly on carrion and is timid when it comes to attacking living creatures. On the other hand, Bruce's hyena, larger and stronger than the common kind, is bold enough to attack large animals and even humans. This species has been known to enter villages at night to snatch domestic animals and children. Another species is the spotted hyena, also called the ""laughing"" hyena due to its unique vocalization.

"Many naturalists believe that the hyena found in South Africa, known as the ""straand-wolf,"" is a different species from the common hyena. Another type, the ""brown hyena,"" resides in the Great Desert, distinct in appearance but similar in behavior. Hyenas, like larger wolves, live in caves or burrows and are voracious eaters, consuming almost anything, even leather or old shoes. They are known to be bold and often prey on the poor natives, even snatching children from their kraals. Despite the danger they pose, exterminating them is not as simple due to the difference between savage and civilized existence. Von Bloom, facing the threat of hyenas and lions near his camp, must protect his family and decide on the best course of action, possibly by building a secure shelter."|"['1.

In a remote area with sparse trees, Von Bloom pondered building a house in a giant nwana tree for safety from man-eaters. Remembering that some natives live in trees for protection, he considered the idea. With platforms on branches and ladders for access, they could sleep securely and leave the children while hunting. The concept seemed ideal, but the challenge was obtaining planks for the platform. Near the thorny jungle, suitable timber was scarce. Von Bloom's solution relied on creating a stable platform in the tree, using the leaves as a roof. While the idea seemed promising, the practicality depended on sourcing the necessary materials for construction.|"['1.

But hold on! There was no need to dismantle it - not a single nail needed to be removed. The exquisite wagon was designed to be disassembled and reassembled at will. The field-cornet, thrilled with this ingenious plan, shared it with the others. Everyone agreed it was perfect, so they wasted no time and got to work. First, they had to build a thirty-foot ladder, which took some time, but they managed to construct a sturdy one. Von Bloom climbed up and chose the perfect spot for the platform. The wagon was swiftly taken apart, and the bottom was hoisted up first. It was a challenge, but they managed to set it in place. Branches were pruned to make room for the tent, which was then lifted and mounted. By nightfall, their aerial abode was ready for occupancy. The next day, they extended the platform to the tree trunk using long poles and willow rods. They topped it with a layer of clay for a fire pit. Swartboy built platforms for himself and Totty with roofs for shelter. With their treehouse complete, the field-cornet was ready to embark on his elephant hunting quest, which he planned to start immediately to avoid disappointment and maintain his determination.|"[""1.

Von Bloom was uncertain if his plan was doable, but he had no choice. He needed a way to make a living and was determined to try. He believed in his calculations and had hope for success. Eager to start, he set out early with Hendrik and Swartboy, leaving Hans at the camp to watch over the children. They followed a stream towards the woods where they thought elephants might be found. The landscape changed from bushes to open plains and then to the wild karoo. They noticed the stream widening but with less water. After a mile, the water stopped flowing, and they only found stagnant pools. They saw small game but refrained from shooting to avoid scaring off potential elephants. The main goal was to find tusks, with fresh meat being a secondary priority. Swartboy used his bow silently, ready to shoot if needed.|"[""1.

"In the wild African plain, Hendrik and Swartboy stumbled upon a majestic bird that resembled a peacock but was actually a great bustard called ""pauw"" by Dutch settlers. The bustard was known for its shy nature and delicious meat. Swartboy, skilled in hunting, faced the challenge of approaching the bird for a shot. The bustard stood 200 yards away in an open glade, ready to run if alarmed. Observing the bird's behavior, Swartboy devised a plan. He crept towards the jungle's edge, mimicking the male bustard's call to lure the bird closer for a shot.

Swartboy, aware of the ""fighting season"" among the pauws, mimicked their call to lure a cock bustard closer. As two bustards engaged in combat, Swartboy seized the opportunity to shoot them with poisoned arrows. The hunters then proceeded along a stream and discovered fresh elephant tracks near a pool.

As they ventured into open clearings, they stumbled upon a vast anthill situated in the center of one of the open spaces. The elephant had recently passed by the anthill, pausing there for a moment. Von Bloom was surprised to discover that elephants sometimes lie down to rest, contrary to the belief that they sleep standing up. Swartboy, however, explained that elephants often lie down, especially in areas where they are not frequently hunted. This behavior indicated to Swartboy that the elephants in the vicinity had not felt threatened, making them easier targets for hunting. In regions where elephants are frequently pursued, they quickly flee upon hearing gunshots, making it challenging for hunters to track them. The group observed signs that the elephant had indeed rested there, leaving imprints in the mud and turf. Swartboy shared interesting insights about elephants, like their preference for leaning against objects when lying down to prevent rolling over, and their tendency to nap beside trees during the hot daytime hours.|"[""1.

The massive elephant displayed immense power as it effortlessly uprooted small trees with its trunk and used its tusks to tackle larger ones. The hunters, feeling a mix of fear and awe, understood the potential danger in provoking such a powerful creature, especially if it turned aggressive. The elephant's solitary nature and destructive tendencies hinted that it might be a rogue, a dangerous outlaw among its kind that could attack without reason. The hunters followed fresh signs of the elephant's presence, like upturned trees and broken branches, realizing they were getting closer to their target.

The elephant stood among tall _mokhala_ trees, which have umbrella-like foliage loved by giraffes. The giraffe, with its long neck, can easily reach the leaves, unlike the elephant. The elephant, using its strength, breaks the tree to eat. Swartboy, skilled in reading animals, saw something in the elephant's demeanor that made him decide to attack. Von Bloom, seeing the elephant's tusks, was determined to shoot. The plan was to get a good shot at the elephant's forehead, thinking it would kill him. Von Bloom approached the elephant, but the shot was a mistake. The elephant, walking silently, neared Von Bloom, who was hiding behind a tree. The elephant's stomach rumbled as it came closer.

Swartboy, a skilled Bushman, found himself in a perilous situation when he tried to outwit an elephant. Initially, he managed to escape the elephant's grasp by using a kaross, a type of garment, to trick the animal. However, his plan backfired when the elephant caught on to the deception and turned after him. In a swift turn of events, Swartboy was flung into the air by the elephant's trunk but miraculously landed on a tree's branches. As the tree collapsed towards the elephant, Swartboy clung to the animal's hind-leg for dear life. Surprisingly, the elephant, unable to dislodge him, fled into the jungle in a panic.

The elephant, frightened like the hunters, rampaged through the jungle, destroying trees in its path. It ran for miles, leaving the hunters behind. The group wanted to pursue but realized it was futile without horses or dogs. Von Bloom regretted losing his horses as elephants easily outrun hunters on foot. Upon returning to camp, they sensed something amiss. Totty, Truey, and Jan seemed troubled. Hans had left to follow strange, pony-like animals to the vley hours ago. The children, anxious, hadn't heard any shots. The animals were peculiar, with yellow-brown fur, manes, and horns. Jan thought they resembled ponies, while Truey likened them to lions. The creatures pranced and had split hooves, manes, and tails like ponies, yet resembled bulls too.|"['1.

Jan accurately described the distinct features of the wildebeest or gnoo, a remarkable ruminant animal. The tuft over the muzzle, long hair between the fore-legs, downward-curving horns, thick neck, horse-shaped body, whitish tail, and flowing mane are all typical of the gnoo. These creatures bear a striking resemblance to lions, especially the old bulls. Jan's keen observations noted their red fiery eyes, fierce look, buffalo-like heads and horns, stag-like limbs, and pony-like appearance. The males are larger and browner than the females, with calves being lighter in color. Wildebeests roam the South African karoos in large herds, emitting a moaning sound that gave rise to their name. They are typically harmless but turn dangerous when wounded, with old bulls becoming aggressive. These animals display capricious antics, running swiftly and circling around hunters with lowered heads, kicking up dust, and bellowing like lions. There are three distinct species of gnoos in Africa, each unique in appearance and behavior, with the wildebeest being the most common.|"['1.

Hans and Swartboy knew the value of the aard-vark they had caught. The creature was rare and a delicacy, making it a prized find. The aard-vark, difficult to capture, was a nocturnal animal with sharp senses of smell and hearing. Its long ears helped it detect even the slightest sounds. This creature was not the only ant-eater in South Africa; there was also the pangolin, covered in scales and with a long tongue to catch ants. The pangolin resembled a lizard and had similar habits to the aard-vark. The group had a simple dinner of roasted bustard, satisfying their hunger.

I hurriedly followed the herd, trying to stay hidden. Surprisingly, the wildebeests were not afraid of me. The old bulls even danced nearby, allowing me to get close. I aimed for a young bull or heifer for tender meat but couldn't get near them. The chase led me to open ground with ant-hills. The cone-shaped ones belonged to white ants, while the cylinder-shaped ones housed a different species. I used the ant-hills as cover to approach the wildebeests, but the bulls kept thwarting my attempts. Their behavior frustrated me, as if they were taunting me.

I was angry with the wildebeests and decided they wouldn't bother me anymore. If they wouldn't let me shoot one, then I would make them pay for their boldness. I aimed to shoot at one of them, but they were ready for a fight. They dropped to their knees, clashed their heads, and then sprang up to trample each other. They seemed serious this time, snorting and bellowing angrily. One was repeatedly knocked down, and I decided to take a shot. I walked closer, aimed at the victor, and fired. The smoke cleared, and to my surprise, the wildebeest charged at me. I climbed an ant-hill to safety, out of reach of its horns.|"[""1.

Hans found himself in a perilous situation with a fierce wildebeest charging at him. Despite being perched safely on top of an ant-hill, the enraged animal relentlessly tried to reach him. Hans observed the wildebeest's massive size and old age from his vantage point. The creature's dark color and thick horns indicated its strength. Even after Hans shot the wildebeest, causing it pain, the animal's fury only intensified. The wildebeest attempted to scale the ant-hill, knocking over smaller cones in the process. Hans, wiping his face with a handkerchief due to the intense heat, noticed that each time he shook the handkerchief, the wildebeest became even more enraged, roaring and charging at him with renewed vigor. Despite the challenging circumstances, Hans remained calm and observant, trying to decipher the wildebeest's unusual behavior.|"['1.

The lengthy explanation finally came to light. It wasn't the wiping of sweat that angered the wildebeest; it was the sight of the scarlet handkerchief being shaken out. Scarlet colors have a powerful effect on these animals, stirring them to a rage akin to madness. Wanting to calm the beast, I crumpled the handkerchief and hid it away, hoping he would calm down and leave. However, the wildebeest's fury only intensified, despite the scarlet being out of sight. Annoyed and worried about my absence from camp, I pondered the safety of my siblings. The wildebeest had damaged parts of the ant-hill, exposing its inner passages. I noticed ants rushing out, a sight I had overlooked earlier in my intense focus on the wildebeest.|"['1.

Swarming all over the hill, already clustering upon my shoes, and crawling still higher, were the crowds of angry ants. Every hole that the bull had made was yielding out its throng of spiteful insects; and all appeared moving towards _me_! Small as the creatures were, I fancied I saw design in their movements. They seemed all actuated with the same feeling--the same impulse--that of attacking me. I could not be mistaken in their intent. They moved all together, as if guided and led by intelligent beings; and they advanced towards the spot on which I stood. My first impression was that I would be destroyed by the termites. I had heard of such things--I remembered that I had. It was that, no doubt, that frightened me so badly. I had heard of men in their sleep being attacked by the white ants, and bitten to death. Such memories came crowding upon me at the moment, until I felt certain, that if I did not soon escape from that spot, the ants would _sting me to death and eat me up_! What was to be done? How was I to avoid both enemies? If I leaped down, the wildebeest would kill me to a certainty. He was still there, with his fierce eye bent upon me continually. If I remained where I was, I would soon be covered with the swarming hideous insects, and eaten up like an old rag. Already I felt|"['1.

I stood atop a cone, surrounded by termites. A new idea struck me - why not use my jacket to brush them away? With swift movements, I cleared them off. Despite the bull waiting below, I felt more at ease. Suddenly, the ground gave way, and I fell into the cone. Something strong lurked beneath me, swiftly moving away. Terrified, I scrambled out.

At first, I believed so, but I noticed that he didn't look up. His focus was on something at the hill's base. Rejoicing, I paid no mind to his departure. It must have been my tumble that caught his attention. Seizing my gun, I readied to descend. Halfway down, I saw the cause of the bull's terror—a strange creature. It had a long, cylindrical snout and long ears, resembling a steinbuck's horns. I recognized it as the harmless aard-vark. Without a sound, I struck its snout with my gun. As I carried the aard-vark, I saw the bull-gnoo, crippled by a leg stuck on its horn. I considered killing it for food but decided against it. The elephant, despite being shot, remained unharmed, only growing more dangerous.|"[""1.

The hunters were determined to bring down the strong old bull elephant. They had learned that regular lead bullets might not penetrate the tough skin of these giant creatures. So, they melted down old candlesticks and other metal items to create harder bullets. With these new bullets, they set out early the next morning, following the fresh trail of the elephants. The spoor led them through thick jungle, where only elephants, rhinoceroses, or men with axes could pass. They discovered a family of elephants had passed through recently, led by the old bull who cleared the way with his trunk and tusks. The trail eventually led to open ground where the elephants scattered, making it challenging to track them.|['1.

While searching for something in the sparse and scraggly bush, Swartboy suddenly dashed off to the side, urging Von Bloom and Hendrik to follow. They thought he had spotted an elephant and readied their guns, eager and anxious. Peering down, they noticed the ground beside a tree was trampled, as if animals had been tethered there, wearing the turf into dust. The bark of the tree was smooth on one side, showing signs of being used as a scratching post by cattle. They realized it was an elephant's sleeping tree. With haste, they gathered the necessary tools - an axe, a strong rawhide rope, and knives - to prepare for the elephant's return. Swartboy directed the operation, instructing them to cut and shape three sturdy stakes to secure the tree. Despite the urgency, Swartboy skillfully dug deep, narrow holes for the stakes without the need for a spade, ensuring a secure setup for the impending encounter.|"['1.

"Swartboy dug the holes with a stick called a ""crowing stick."" He loosened the earth in a circle, removed the soil, and repeated the process until the hole was deep enough. After camouflaging the stakes and clearing the area, the hunters retreated. The day turned scorching, but the shade provided relief. Swartboy anticipated the heat would lead the elephant to seek shelter under the camel-thorn tree. Moments later, they heard the elephant's stomach rumble, and it emerged from the jungle, approaching the tree as predicted. The elephant sprayed water from its trunk, enjoying a refreshing bath. The hunters hoped this signaled the elephant's impending slumber. Suddenly, the elephant collapsed, emitting a deafening scream.

It took an hour to cut out the tusks from the elephant they had hunted. The hunters carried the heavy tusks back to camp, leaving the carcass behind. Von Bloom felt uneasy despite their success. They had stumbled upon the elephants by accident, and the future hunts might not be as easy. Two weeks later, after many failed chases, they only had a pair of short tusks to show for their efforts. The hunters realized that stalking elephants on foot was challenging. Horses would have been a better option to catch the elephants. Von Bloom worried about the lack of success and the impact it would have on his children's future in the wilderness without proper education or society. Sitting on a platform in a tree, he pondered the difficulties ahead.|"['1.

Wild-asses are large animals resembling small horses, marching in a line like a caravan with about fifty individuals. They have a steady pace, unlike the erratic movements of gnoos. These animals have stripes on their cheeks, neck, and shoulders, similar to a zebra but less distinct. They share characteristics with horses, asses, gnoos, and zebras, but are distinct as quaggas. The Equidae family includes horses and asses, with key differences in manes, tails, and callosities. Asses have short manes and tails with long hairs only at the tip. There are various species of wild-asses in Africa, such as the onagra and dziggetai. The zebra family includes the true zebra, Burchell's zebra, Congo dauw, quagga, and white zebra, all marked with transversal bands. The true zebra is white with black stripes, while dauws have less defined stripes and different coloring. The habitat of these species varies across Africa.|"['1.

"In South Africa, there are four species of zebras. The mountain zebra lives among cliffs, while the dauw and quagga roam the plains and deserts. The ""white zebra"" has only been seen by one traveler, Le Vaillant, leading to doubts about its existence as a distinct species. Each species herds with different animals - the quagga with the gnoo, the dauw with the brindled gnoo, and the ostrich with both. The mountain zebra is shy, the dauw is untameable, and the quagga is timid and docile, easily trained.

"The hunters faced a dilemma on how to capture the quaggas returning to the vley to drink. Hendrik suggested ""creasing,"" a method of shooting the upper neck to immobilize the quagga without killing it. However, Hans found this method cruel and suggested using snares instead. But Hendrik argued that snaring might only catch one quagga and scare off the rest. The field-cornet noticed that the quaggas always entered the water at one point and left at another. This observation led to a new plan: setting a trap on the trail where the quaggas exited the water. By galloping the quaggas into the trap at that moment, they could capture the whole herd at once.

During the planning of their capture, the herd of quaggas remained visible on the open plain, frolicking. Although tempted, Hendrik refrained from showcasing his marksmanship skills on them to avoid deterring them from returning to the vley. The hunters observed the quaggas from the safety of the branches of a tree, hidden from view. The quaggas remained oblivious to their presence. As one quagga neared a bush, a striped hyena suddenly emerged and fled in fear. Surprisingly, the quagga pursued and swiftly subdued the hyena, demonstrating their animosity towards each other. The quagga's victory over the hyena showcased their protective nature, often used by farmers to guard their cattle. Von Bloom, observing the quaggas, proposed a plan that required immediate action to ensure its success before the quaggas returned. The group had the necessary tools and worked efficiently to dig a pit and cover their tracks before the quaggas' arrival.|"['1.

The hunters had outlined a pit and began digging with spades and shovels. The ground was loose, making the work easier. The field-cornet, Hendrik, and Swartboy dug, while Hans, Totty, Truey, and little Jan helped by carrying baskets of dirt. After a day's work, they stopped to rest and planned to finish the pit the next day. At dawn, they resumed digging until the pit was deep enough. They covered the pit with poles, bushes, rushes, and grass to camouflage it. The hunters hoped to trap quaggas by driving them into the pit. Each hunter predicted how many they would catch, aiming for at least four. They set up an ambush around the lake, waiting for the quaggas to approach. The hunters planned to scare the quaggas into the pit by creating a panic.|['1. What were the hunters digging in the passage?\nA) Wells\nB) Tunnels\nC) Pits\nD) Trenches\nE) Holes', '2.

The entire plan was well designed and executed successfully. The herd was seen moving across the plain, just like in previous instances. Von Bloom alerted the three hidden individuals to their approach by softly repeating the words. The leader, upon climbing the bank and noticing fresh grass and rushes on the path, hesitated momentarily but was startled by the loud gunshot, followed by echoes from other guns and Swartboy's loud shout from another direction. A glance backward revealed the quaggas were nearly surrounded by unfamiliar foes. With no other option, the herd rushed up the bank, heading towards the pit. Chaos ensued as the quaggas struggled to avoid falling into the pit, with some leaping high in the air and others running back into the lake. Ultimately, most of the herd made their way back through the gorge they had come from, disappearing from sight within minutes. In less than two weeks, four of the quaggas were trained to be ridden and obedient. Hendrik, a skilled hunter, was exceptional in providing food for the group, often hunting antelopes. Africa is known for its vast variety of antelope species, with over seventy types worldwide, more than fifty of which are found in Africa. Hendrik was particularly skilled in hunting antelopes, ensuring a well-stocked larder for the group.|"['1.

The largest antelope, the eland, is a massive animal weighing about one thousand pounds and standing as tall as a large horse. It has straight horns that are two feet long, spiraled with ridges. The eland is not a fast runner and can be easily approached by a mounted hunter. Their eyes are large and gentle, showing no fierceness. Elands are independent of water and prefer desert plains for security, although they can also be found in fertile areas. They are social animals, herding in groups of up to a hundred. The eland's meat is highly prized, compared to tender beef with a gamey flavor. The hunt for elands is not very exciting, as they are not fast runners and are quickly captured for their valuable venison.|"['1.

Hendrik, a skilled hunter, used strategy to approach the elands without alarming them. He circled around to position himself between the herd and a cliff. Riding his quagga, he bent low to deceive the elands, who watched him with curiosity and some alarm. When Hendrik drove the elands toward the cliff, they changed direction, giving him an advantage. He chased them across the plain, knowing he could drive the tired eland back to camp instead of wasting resources by killing it on the spot. As Hendrik reached the ravine, the eland, startled by approaching quaggas, tried to escape. Despite the interruption, Hendrik continued to investigate, discovering the source of the disturbance to be a troop of quaggas, much to his annoyance.|"['1.

Hendrik found himself in a predicament as his quagga unexpectedly broke free from the bridle and joined the herd of quaggas that had their tails docked by Swartboy. Initially planning to halt when the eland stopped, Hendrik's quagga had different ideas. Ignoring Hendrik's attempts to steer, the quagga galloped on, reuniting with its old companions. Despite the mishap with the bit, Hendrik, a skilled rider, remained calm, confident in his ability to stay on the saddle without the need for reins. As the quagga sped off with the herd, Hendrik's thoughts shifted from amusement to concern about the situation. Now, he faced the challenge of catching up with the runaway quagga and regaining control before it was too late.|"[""1.

The quaggas ran in fear, mistaking Hendrik for a monster thirsting for their lives. Despite his efforts to explain, they fled, kicking up dust. Hendrik, desperate to rejoin his old companions and escape civilized life, urged his quagga to no avail. He couldn't dismount, fearing injury. As the miles passed, Hendrik grew anxious, unsure of their destination. Lost and helpless, he worried about hunger and thirst in the desert.

The boy faced a tough decision. Should he risk his life by leaping off his quagga to avoid danger, losing his saddle and the animal in the process? Despite the potential embarrassment of walking back to camp, he knew he had to act. The quaggas showed no signs of stopping, and he couldn't keep up. Remembering a trick from taming the quagga, he fashioned a makeshift blind out of his jacket, covering the animal's eyes. The quagga halted, conquered by the simple contrivance. With determination, the boy reined in the quagga, replacing the broken bit-ring and guiding the animal back on track. Following the quaggas' tracks, he retrieved his gun and made his way back to camp, sharing his adventures with an eager audience.

Constructing a gun-trap to catch elusive animals can be a clever strategy. In South Africa, Von Bloom set up a trap using three trees in a line. The gun was placed horizontally, with the muzzle aimed at the entrance of a kraal. A string connected to a stick behind the trigger was tied across the entrance, so any movement would pull the trigger. Bait was placed inside to lure animals. That night, a tiger-wolf fell for the trap and was shot dead as it entered the kraal. The bullet pierced its heart, showing the effectiveness of this method. This demonstrates the importance of precision and strategy in hunting.|"['1.

Once the hunters reloaded the gun, they returned to rest. Despite the thought of moving the dead hyena to avoid warning the others, Swartboy knew better. Hyenas see their fallen comrades as prey, not a threat. By morning, another hyena fell into the trap. But a more dangerous visitor lurked - a family of lions. While the camp was safe in the trees from lions, the nightly roars were unsettling. The hunters adapted the trap for lions, using fresh animal bait. The lions fell one by one. With the predators gone, the children could play freely, always cautious of danger. Truey once strayed near the water with her loyal gazelle companion.|"['1.

Truey wandered along the shore of the lake with her pet springbok, enjoying the tranquility of the surroundings. As they strolled, they came across a small peninsula covered in green grass and a unique Babylonian willow tree. The tree's branches drooped down, almost touching the water, and on each branch hung odd-shaped objects resembling inverted salad-oil bottles. These objects were actually weaver-bird nests, intricately woven by the skilled birds. Weaver-birds are known for their nest-building abilities, with different species constructing nests of various shapes and using different materials. Some build nests resembling kidney shapes, while others create nests that look like suspended hedgehogs. The social gros-beak even builds a cluster of nests under one roof, forming a republic of nests in one clump atop a tree.|['1.

"Weaver-birds, like the red-billed weaver-bird, are known for their nest-weaving skills.

Slowly moving along a branch, a large serpent caught Truey's attention with its glittering scales. It was spiraling down a willow tree branch, seemingly coming from bird nests. Just as Truey noticed it, the snake slithered down the tree trunk towards her. Provoked by the birds and Truey's presence, the snake hissed angrily. Truey instinctively moved away, knowing a large snake is dangerous, whether venomous or not. She cautiously avoided the snake, hoping it would move towards the mainland. Unaware of the snake's venomous nature, Truey trembled at the sight of the menacing creature. The snake suddenly coiled and raised its head, resembling the deadly cobra of Africa.

"The snake, Jan! Did you not see it? It was just there, at our feet; but now--see! yonder it is. The secretary has got it. See! They are fighting! Good bird!

"The serpent-eater, also known as the ""crane-vulture,"" is a unique bird that primarily feeds on snakes. While it also consumes lizards, tortoises, and locusts, snakes are its preferred prey. Found in Africa, the Gambia, and the Philippines, this bird is solitary and nests in thorny trees. It is an excellent runner and spends more time on foot than flying. Despite being shy and wary, it is easily domesticated and kept by Cape farmers to control snakes and vermin. A tamed serpent-eater once saved Jan and Truey from a deadly snake bite. After being wounded and cared for by hunters, it repaid their kindness by protecting Jan from a cobra. The bird caught the snake by the neck in its beak, rose vertically to drop it, stunning the snake before it could coil around the bird's wings."|"['1.

The secretary bird swiftly swooped down from the sky to attack the snake. After the snake landed and coiled up defensively, the bird cautiously approached. Using its wings as shields, the bird struck the snake, stunning it. The bird then repeatedly pounced on the snake until it lay still. The family, lacking bread, subsisted on roots and nuts found in the area. They had various food sources like the pig-nut, bulbs of different plants, and wild onions. However, they longed for bread and had planted maize seeds from their last stock to eventually harvest a crop. The fertile ground near their home had been carefully tended for the maize to grow.|['1.

The field-cornet dedicated much time to tending the maize field, watering the plants and creating small mounds around them for protection and nourishment. The result was impressive; the cornstalks grew to a height of twelve feet with ears nearly a foot long. The anticipated harvest would provide maize-bread, hominy, and other dishes for feasts. Totty, observing from a platform in the nwana-tree, noticed a peculiar sight. A group of over two hundred baboons, resembling large dogs with greenish-brown fur and black faces, were approaching from the cliffs. Baboons, known for their uncouth appearance and habits, are native to Africa. These creatures possess strength and cunning, capable of outsmarting other animals and even humans for food. Their intelligence and mischievous behavior make them fascinating yet formidable creatures in the wild.|['1.

Totty watched from her perch as the baboons marched in an orderly manner towards the cornfield. The troop had scouts on the wings and leaders in front, communicating with calls and signals. The females and young ones were in the middle for safety, with mothers carrying infants. Some mothers would stop to nurse while others disciplined their young. As most of the troop entered the cornfield to feast, a line of baboons stationed themselves to receive the corn heads tossed to them by their companions. Totty, unaware of the danger, rushed to protect the cornfield with a broom handle. She was surrounded by angry baboons until horsemen arrived to save her. The field-cornet ensured the maize was safely harvested, away from any threats.|"['1.

After taming the quaggas, hunting became more successful for the group. They were able to collect pairs of tusks every week, creating a small pyramid of ivory near their camp. While the quaggas helped them catch elephants, sometimes they lost their prey. Introducing dogs to the hunt changed the game. The dogs couldn't harm the elephants but could track and bark, distracting the elephants and giving hunters a chance to shoot safely. Von Bloom, a hunter, considered training hyenas for hunting as they are effective like dogs. One day, while contemplating from a high platform, Von Bloom saw a pack of wild hounds chasing a herd of animals. The hounds resembled domestic dogs and were in pursuit of the fleeing animals.|['Question 1:\nWhat did the group collect every week after taming the quaggas?\nA) Feathers\nB) Pairs of tusks\nC) Fruits\nD) Shells\nE) Stones', 'Question 2:\nWhat did the group create near their camp with the tusks they collected?\nA) A small pyramid of feathers\nB) A small pyramid of fruits\nC) A small pyramid of shells\nD) A small pyramid of ivory\nE) A small pyramid of stones', 'Question 3:\nHow did the dogs help the hunters during the hunt?\nA) By attacking the elephants\nB) By hiding from the elephants\nC) By distracting the elephants with barking\nD) By climbing trees\nE) By swimming in the river', 'Question 4:\nWho considered training hyenas for hunting as they are effective like dogs?\nA) The elephants\nB) The quaggas\nC) The hunters\nD) The hounds\nE) The wild animals', 'Question 5:\nWhat did Von Bloom see from a high platform one day?\nA) A pack of wild hounds chasing a herd of animals\nB) A group of elephants resting\nC) A flock of birds flying\nD) A herd of quaggas grazing\nE) A family of hyenas hunting', 'Question 6:\nWhat did the hounds resemble during the chase?\nA) Elephants\nB) Domestic dogs\nC) Quaggas\nD) Hyenas\nE) Hunters']|['B) Pairs of tusks', 'D) A small pyramid of ivory', 'C) By distracting the elephants with barking', 'C) The hunters', 'A) A pack of wild hounds chasing a herd of animals', 'B) Domestic dogs']
"Von Bloom was well aware of the creatures approaching. They were the ""wilde-honden,"" wrongly named by some as ""_Hyena venatica_"" or ""hunting hyena,"" and by others as the ""hunting dog."" These names seemed absurd to Von Bloom. He believed the name ""wild hounds"" given by the boors was perfect for these animals. Their appearance and behavior resembled hounds more than hyenas or wild dogs. The wild hounds hunted in packs with great skill, similar to well-trained hounds. Von Bloom admired their hunting tactics as they chased a hartebeest, using their cunning to outsmart the swift antelope. The hounds' ability to anticipate the hartebeest's movements showed their intelligence and hunting prowess.

This was indeed the case as the dog managed to steer the antelope off its course, prompting the pack to adjust their direction diagonally, attempting to intercept the game. By doing so, they avoided the detour taken by the antelope and their companion. The hartebeest altered its path, with one hound leading the pack once more. As the antelope changed course again, the pack made another cut towards it, with a fresh dog taking the lead. The chase continued with the hounds yelping as they ran. The hartebeest made a final stand, but realizing escape was futile, it turned defiantly, foam dripping from its mouth and eyes gleaming fiercely. Von Bloom contemplated the taming of wild hounds for hunting, particularly elephants, a challenging but possible task. The dogs seemed to spare the antelope, surprising the onlookers.|"[""1.

Close to the cliff, the body of the hartebeest lay half-eaten by the puppies of the wild hounds. Over sixty pups were gnawing at the flesh, while the adult dogs rested nearby. These hounds had a unique way of feeding their young by driving the antelope to the cliffs. Von Bloom observed the puppies and tried to capture them, but they dashed into their caves. Eventually, Von Bloom managed to capture over a dozen of the pups and trained them to hunt elephants. After several years, he decided to return to civilisation, feeling a longing for human companionship. Despite his time in the wilderness, he had taught his children well, providing them with a balanced education and instilling in them values of honour, morality, and self-reliance.|['1.
