"""Take the children to bed,"" he said suddenly, at last, and Dorothea obeyed. August stayed behind, curled before the stove; at nine years old, and when one earns money in the summer from the farmers, one is not altogether a child any more, at least in one's own estimation. August did not heed his father's silence; he was used to it. Karl Strehla was a man of few words, and, being of weakly health, was usually too tired at the end of the day to do more than drink his beer and sleep. August lay on the wolfskin, dreamy and comfortable, looking up through his drooping eyelids at the golden coronets on the crest of the great stove, and wondering for the millionth time whom it had been made for, and what grand places and scenes it had known. Dorothea came down from putting the little ones in their beds; the cuckoo clock in the corner struck eight; she looked to her father and the untouched pipe, then sat down to her spinning, saying nothing. She thought he had been drinking in some tavern; it had been often so with him of late. ""I have sold Hirschvogel!"" said Karl Strehla in the same husky, dogged voice. ""I have sold it to a traveling trader in such things for two hundred florins. What would you?--I owe double that. He saw it this morning"|"['1.

The old man kindly called August a simpleton but acknowledged his wisdom surpassing his father's. He mentioned that Herr Steiner in Spritz would have given fair value for the stove. The neighbor suggested August wait until he was older to retrieve it, reassuring him that valuable items are well-protected. August, feeling a strong connection to the stove, considered going after it himself. He watched as the stove was carefully loaded onto a dray, bound for the railway station. August followed the dray, pondering if the stove would head north or south. At the station, he overheard the Bavarians discussing how to transport the stove. Eventually, they decided to send it on a luggage train passing through Hall, where swift trains rarely stopped. August eagerly awaited the stove's journey.|"['**1.

It is important to stay loyal and endure challenges until the end. The train journey from Munich to the Wurm-See was delayed due to snow, making the trip slower than usual. August observed the serene lake and distant mountains as the train stopped at Possenhofen. The stove was then loaded onto a large boat, crossing the calm lake to Leoni.

August was overwhelmed with a mix of emotions. The thought of two thousand gold Bavarian ducats for his father was both dazzling and distressing. The sale of Hirschvogel, the precious stove, for money troubled him deeply. Would the king let him stay with it? Begging with joined hands, he pleaded with the monarch, who, absorbed in his own troubles, finally spoke kindly. The king promised August he could stay at court, learn painting, and grow up to be a skilled artist. Overjoyed, August fainted from a whirlwind of feelings. Though just a scholar now, he promises to be a great man. He returns home occasionally, where his father prospers from the ducats.

In the garden, Rosa Damascena, a common yet beautiful rose, felt unappreciated among the more fashionable and rare roses. She longed to be like the Princesse Adelaide or the Duchess of Devoniensis. Despite her vibrant hues, she yearned to be pale or yellow, like the roses that were admired in the garden. Even the bees, who could change her colors, ignored her. Rosa Damascena's pride and vanity made her disdainful of the blackbird and other helpful creatures, causing her to suffer from aphides. Eventually, through grafting, she transformed into a Rosa Indica, producing a small yellow blossom that she deemed superior to her previous red clusters.

The evening rushed by; the lady of the house and her visitors departed; the table was reorganized; the rose tree stayed in its special spot; the lights flickered on; music played nearby; people danced in other rooms. Hanging above her was a chandelier—a circle of countless tiny flames and droplets resembling dew or diamonds. She imagined it to be the sun drawing near. As time passed, it grew scorching, its rays stinging her. Guests came and went, oblivious to her presence. They feasted, laughed, and flirted, then returned to dancing, the music echoing all night.

In the old days of Urbino, life was simple and content. The work was well done, living was affordable, and food was abundant and delicious. The houses were sturdy, adorned with intricate details, passed down through generations. Families lived in harmony, working from sunrise to sunset, then enjoying the calm evening air, overlooking the fertile plains. Giovanni Sanzio, a wise man, envisioned his son, Raffaelle, painting the beauty around them. Raffaelle, a dreamer, spent hours gazing at the world below, filled with bustling markets, noble processions, and peaceful pilgrims. Urbino was renowned for its pottery, with master craftsmen like Maestro Benedetto creating exquisite pieces. Raffaelle admired Pacifica, Maestro Benedetto's daughter, and Luca Torelli, a handsome apprentice. Despite the envy and ambition that lurked in the background, the serene atmosphere of Urbino inspired Raffaelle's artistic soul.|"['1.
