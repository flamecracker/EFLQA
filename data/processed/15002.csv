The positive impact was clear, and a repeat of such discipline did not occur. The boys, eager to maintain the reputation of their favorite activity, agreed to the rule for the current year in both clubs. Without these measures, boating could have become a nuisance that parents and teachers would not accept. So, the club members made a conscious effort to keep thoughts of their boating adventures aside when focusing on other important matters. It was surprising how successful they were when they earnestly dedicated themselves to the task. The exciting plan that captivated the Butterflies was to establish a fleet of boats on the lake under Commodore Frank Sedley's leadership. The dream of boats maneuvering gracefully on the water and exploring new territories was so enchanting that the boys couldn't easily let go of it. The boys were thrilled by the idea of commanding a fleet and exploring new waters, and they eagerly anticipated the adventures that lay ahead.|"[""1.

Tim Bunker voted against the advice given to Charles, which worried his friend due to Charles being easily influenced. Captain Sedley and George Weston were surprised by the noble actions of the club members, who quickly organized a May-day picnic.

Captain Sedley presented Mr. Walker to the group, and the kind man was keen to learn about how the boat clubs impacted the boys. He asked many questions to parents and Mr. Hyde, the teacher. They agreed the boys benefited from the clubs, finding the discipline useful and the physical exercise healthy. Some worried their sons might develop a strong liking for the water leading them to choose a seafaring life. Mr. Walker tried to convince the skeptics that Wood Lake was far from the open sea. Despite concerns, the benefits of the clubs were widely acknowledged, including access to libraries, lectures, and debating societies. The day continued with festivities, dancing around the May-pole, crowning the Queen of May, and enjoying a feast with lively music and speeches. However, two boys, Charles Hardy and Tim Bunker, seemed troubled, hinting at potential trouble ahead.|"['1.

Charles was filled with fear, not of the wicked act he had thought of doing, but of the consequences. He had found a purse on the beach and shared this secret with Tim, who encouraged him to keep quiet and not think about it. Tim warned Charles not to betray him, threatening to harm him if he did. Despite feeling guilty, Charles tried to act normal during the day's activities, hiding the secret. As time passed, the boys continued their usual routines, balancing school duties with their leisure time on the lake. Moderation in enjoying pleasures was emphasized, as excessive indulgence could lead to losing interest. Charles and Tim's friendship grew stronger, bonded by their shared secret of the lost purse. Mr. Walker, the owner of the purse, remained unaware of its loss, leaving Charles burdened with guilt and inner turmoil.|['1.

One Wednesday afternoon, Charles and Tim were on their way to the boat-house when Tim was suddenly expelled from the club by Captain Sedley. The director had taken this action due to Tim's behavior, which was deemed harmful to the club's moral welfare. Despite efforts to reform Tim, it became clear that he was not willing to change. The club then embarked on a mission to erect a lighthouse on Curtis Island to aid navigation through the difficult Calrow Strait. The boys worked hard, gathering rocks and building the tower. They faced challenges, like managing an ungainly raft, but with teamwork and skill, they successfully completed the project. The new member was admitted, and the club celebrated their accomplishment.|"[""Question 1:\nWhy was Tim expelled from the club by Captain Sedley?\nA) He was late for the meeting\nB) He damaged club property\nC) His behavior was considered harmful to the club's moral welfare\nD) He disagreed with the club's mission\nE) He was not a good swimmer"", ""Question 2:\nWhat was the club's mission after Tim's expulsion?\nA) Build a new clubhouse\nB) Organize a sailing competition\nC) Erect a lighthouse on Curtis Island\nD) Plant trees around the boat-house\nE) Host a fundraising event"", 'Question 3:\nWhat challenges did the boys face while working on the lighthouse project?\nA) Finding enough rocks\nB) Dealing with bad weather\nC) Managing an ungainly raft\nD) Lack of teamwork\nE) Lack of building materials', 'Question 4:\nHow did the club members feel when they successfully completed the lighthouse project?\nA) Angry\nB) Frustrated\nC) Disappointed\nD) Proud\nE) Indifferent', ""Question 5:\nWhat was the outcome of the club's hard work on the lighthouse project?\nA) Tim was readmitted to the club\nB) The club disbanded\nC) A new member was admitted\nD) The club relocated\nE) The lighthouse collapsed"", ""Question 6:\nWhat was the reason for the club's celebration at the end of the passage?\nA) Tim's return to the club\nB) The completion of the lighthouse\nC) Captain Sedley's retirement\nD) Winning a sailing competition\nE) The club's decision to disband""]"|"[""C) His behavior was considered harmful to the club's moral welfare"", 'C) Erect a lighthouse on Curtis Island', 'C) Managing an ungainly raft', 'D) Proud', 'C) A new member was admitted', 'B) The completion of the lighthouse']"
Several boat trips were made to bring additional supplies for the lighthouse construction. By six o'clock, the tower was completed with its capstone, standing six feet above ground and twelve feet above the water. The inauguration was celebrated with cheers as a candle inside a hollow pumpkin was placed at the top. As darkness fell, the light from the lighthouse guided the boats back home, ensuring safety on the water. Charles and Tim discussed plans to spend time on an island but faced moral dilemmas. Tim's persuasion clashed with Charles' conscience, leading to internal conflict. Despite the allure of adventure, Charles grappled with the ethical implications of their scheme, torn between loyalty to his friends and the temptation of freedom.|['1.

Charles pondered deeply, realizing he preferred the company of good boys over the rowdy Rovers. Despite being their leader, he found their profane language and quarrelsome nature unpleasant. Tim, who could easily control them with force, made Charles doubt his own ability. Feeling burdened by sin, Charles resolved to expose the Rovers' wrongdoing. However, fear of consequences and peer pressure weakened his resolve. His father's stern talk further shook him. Despite his mother's comfort, the weight of his actions weighed heavily on Charles.

Two leaders were selected in every group to oversee the squads. Tim realized that creating more positions would ensure more friends who would support him during challenging times. In Charles's group, one of these roles was given to the unruly Barney, securing his loyalty and resolving past conflicts. The stakes were driven into the ground, and poles were set up; however, sewing the cloth for the tent cover was so tedious that they abandoned the task. The cloth strips were draped over the tent frame and secured with pins. But there was only enough material for one tent, revealing Tim's miscalculation.

Monday was a cold, dismal day. The wind blew from the northeast, accompanied by a light, misty rain and a dense fog that covered the lake, hiding the Rovers' camp from view. A planned boat trip by the two clubs was canceled due to the unfavorable weather. Instead, club members gathered indoors for activities. Frank was shocked to find the Zephyr boat missing from its spot. Suspicions arose, especially around Tim Bunker, who had been involved in previous mischiefs. Mr. Hardy, distressed by his son's involvement, joined Captain Sedley in a search around the lake.

Around five in the evening, they came back to the island, and rain started before nightfall. A large fire burned on the island all evening, but the flimsy tents of the Rovers were not enough to shield them from the harsh weather. At nine, the Zephyrs left, leaving Uncle Ben to keep an eye on the Rovers. Discordant cries indicated trouble at the camp, possibly a fight. The night cleared, and Tuesday was sunny. In the morning, it was noticed that one tent had been moved. By nine, the Rovers gathered on the beach, split into two groups, engaged in a heated argument. A fight broke out when one group tried to board the Zephyr, but no side won. Eventually, both groups took boats and left the island. Charles was no longer the coxswain, having fallen out of favor. The Zephyr crew, feeling remorse, sought his forgiveness, showing that even the wrong path can lead to redemption.|"['1.

"This is a temporary plan, and once we have more boats, we will reorganize. We need skilled rowers for our current tasks. While we are away, Uncle Ben will teach the other boys how to row. The Lily and the Dart had eight oars each, while the Dip only had four and was meant to support the fleet. Uncle Ben assigned positions to the boys, but there were still around thirty boys left after all the oars were taken. After an hour of practice, he trained the crews to work together, and the boats were then used to transport the rest of the group to the boathouse. The others were also taught, and by noon, Uncle Ben had made them quite good at rowing.

When the Bluebird got to Center Island, Tim had just left in the Butterfly, and Barney was getting ready to do the same in the Zephyr. The Rovers were completely surprised by this unexpected intrusion into their territory and quickly fled from the beach. William Bright, the Bluebird's coxswain, brought her next to the Zephyr and towed her. They also took control of the Sylph and the gondola, leaving the Rovers stranded on the island with no way to escape. With the three boats in tow, they rowed back to the beach.

The Bluebird raced ahead. The agitated crew had spotted the Butterfly about a mile away, heading towards the river. Tim Bunker, at a safe"|"['1.

"A green flag was raised, and the squadron lined up. Then a yellow flag divided them into pairs. The boats glided down the lake, showcasing intricate maneuvers impossible to capture on paper. Circles were rowed around the Dip, and boats formed shapes like hexagons and stars. ""Now, boys, we're off to Rippleton River,"" announced Commodore Sedley. Caution was stressed, with flags guiding the way. The fleet navigated the river's mouth with care, avoiding dangerous rocks marked by buoys. Each boat followed color-coded instructions to pass safely. The Zephyr supervised the channel. The boys, grateful for the experience, had a hearty meal in a scenic grove before continuing their exploration further upstream.

Responding to the signal, the boats of the fleet aligned as instructed, and the boys filled the hills and woods with the passion of their song. It was a delightful and heartening scene to witness them gliding over the calm waters, their voices blending with those of the natural songbirds in the surroundings. Their spirits were uplifted, harmonizing beautifully with the serene setting. The rapids, though labeled as such by the commodore, posed no significant challenge. Despite a rocky ledge on one side, the fleet navigated the waters smoothly. The Lily faced a minor setback on the first attempt but managed to pass through on the second try. The arrival of the squadron astonished the onlookers on the shore, leaving them in awe. Led by Frank, the boats landed, and the crew was organized into a procession, parading through the village to a warm reception.
