In the Dutch Twins Primer, we meet Kit and Kat, whose real names are Christopher and Katrina. Growing four and a half feet of Boy and Girl takes time, much longer than it does for chickens, puppies, colts, and kittens. Kit and Kat had many meals, played countless games, and enjoyed numerous happy days while growing into their names. Looking out across the road, the canal, and the green fields to the distant blue sky, Vrouw Vedder, the Twins' Mother, saw the sun rising over the treetops. The sky was a brilliant blue, painting a serene picture of the world awakening.|"['1.

"Mrs. Vedder heard the sounds of the roosters crowing, ducks quacking, and birds singing joyfully. She sang her own tune as she returned to the kitchen. ""Kit and Kat,"" she said, ""the sun is up, the birds are singing, and Grandfather is going fishing today. Hurry to join him at six o'clock. Get dressed, I'll pack lunch in the yellow basket, and you can find bait in the garden, but mind the cabbages."" The twins quickly got ready with their mother's help, ate bread and milk on the doorstep, and headed out. Living by the canal, their father tended to rows of crops. Grandfather rarely had holidays as he delivered milk in town. They climbed the dyke, rested, and sat on the pier to fish. Grandfather warned them to stay still to catch fish while enjoying the sea view."|['1.

Kit and Kat were playing near the kitchen doorway while their mother prepared supper. The twins were helping their ducklings learn to swim in a pan of water. Suddenly, Kit fell in the water with a splash. Kat's hook caught on Kit's clothes as he splashed like a young whale. Kat shrieked as the tide carried her shoe away. Grandfather rescued Kit's shoes with his fishing rod. They all went back to the beach, where Kit was covered with sand to keep warm while his clothes dried. They had a lunch of bread, butter, cheese, and milk from Father's garden. After eating, Grandfather insisted they catch some fish. Kit and Kat played in the sand, built a dyke, and made sand-pies in clam shells. Later, they walked slowly along the road by the canal, tired but content.|"['1.

Kit, Kat, and their father worked diligently, washing vegetables and filling their boat with cabbages, onions, beets, and carrots. They sailed under bridges and along canals, passing homes with white curtains and pots of red geraniums. Some families waved from their breakfast tables, while others washed clothes by the canal. The market square bustled with stalls of fresh produce and colorful flowers. The twins helped unload the boat, then enjoyed bread and cheese. They learned to count and assisted their father with the sales. At the market, they marveled at the flowers, birds in cages, and stalls selling various goods. The Vrouw kindly rewarded them with dolls, and they returned home swiftly, eager to share their day's adventures with their mother.|"['1.

Vrouw Vedder needed help to prepare for Grandma's visit. She went to the pasture to milk the cow, while Kit and Kat helped keep the flies away. They used willow switches to shoo the flies. After milking, they carried the pails back home. On the way, they encountered a goose with her goslings going for a swim. The goose and gander chased them, causing a commotion.

The sun shone through the kitchen window, casting patches of light on the floor. The kettle sang on the fire as Vrouw Vedder tidied up after breakfast. Father Vedder, dressed in his Sunday best, lit his pipe without a glance at Kit and Kat. Kit and Kat were dressed in many layers, with colorful clothes for the day. They ate bread and milk as Father Vedder tended to the animals. Ready for church, they set off, passing a windmill singing its sleepy song.

Father Vedder reminded the children to learn their catechism well. He then gave them each a penny to contribute when the collection bag passed. Grandfather and Grandmother, dressed in their best, took Kit and Kat to church. During the service, the Twins fell asleep on Grandmother's shoulders. When it was time to put money in the collection bag, Kit struggled to find his penny. Grandmother, flustered by the Twins bumping heads, accidentally dropped a peppermint instead of a coin. After church, they returned home to a cozy house with shining windows. Grandmother prepared coffee, bread, cheese, smoked beef, and cakes. Outside, a band played the national hymn of Holland, and everyone joined in singing proudly.|['1.

Preserve, O God, the land of our fathers, where we were born and where we'll rest. We call to Thee for safety for our Prince and Fatherland. As the people sang joyfully, a grand carriage approached with white horses, soldiers, and the royal family. The Queen noticed Kit and Kat, waving and smiling at them. The royal procession passed, leaving a sense of magic in the air. Back at Grandfather Winkle's house, Kat hesitated to wear a faded apron for a ride in the milk cart, pondering the choice.

Kit and Kat were in a bit of a mess, with holes in their clothes and tears on their cheeks. Grandmother Winkle came to the rescue, patching up their breeches so well that the holes disappeared. She then cleaned them up, making them look good as new. When Grandfather Winkle returned, Grandmother even scrubbed the milk cart clean. Soon, the twins were dressed in their Sunday best again. Grandfather then took them home in the dog cart, with Kit and Kat excitedly nodding along. As they reached home, they found the geese unable to swim due to ice on the canal.

The stable, an extension of the house, had two stalls. Vrouw Vedder cleaned vigorously, scrubbing walls, stalls, and the floor. The Twins joined in until exhaustion, leaving the stable gleaming. Pleased, Vrouw Vedder found old skates, suggesting a try-on. Kit vowed to be good for St. Nicholas' visit, as only good children receive gifts. Soon, a cold wind froze the canals, creating icy paths. Kit struggled to skate, causing a tumble with Kat. Determined, they practiced daily, aiming to skate to town before St. Nicholas' feast. When they surprised their mother by skating hand in hand, she called Father Vedder to witness. Kit raced Kat to the windmill, only to be outpaced.

As Kit and Kat approached the town, they spotted a tent by the canal junction. A man near the tent called out to the skaters through his hands. After enjoying their soup, they strolled through the town's bustling streets filled with delightful shops. The bakeries displayed cakes adorned with candies and even some shaped like St. Nicholas. While Vrouw Vedder was out on an errand, Father Vedder, Kit, and Kat leisurely walked, waiting for her return. Suddenly, a commotion erupted up the street with shouts and the clatter of wooden shoes. Amidst the crowd, a grand white horse carried none other than St. Nicholas himself, spreading joy among the children. Following him was a cart brimming with various gifts. Father Vedder advised the children to place beans or hay in their wooden shoes for the horse, hoping for a surprise the next day. After a delightful evening, the family skated back home at dusk, forming a line on the canal. Kit and Kat quickly prepared their wooden shoes with hay for St. Nicholas's horse before eagerly heading to bed.

Kit and Kat, the Twins, sat on the edge of their cupboard bed to open their St. Nicholas packages. Kit's had a big St. Nicholas cake, while Kat's had cakes shaped like birds and fish. Their mother reminded them to get dressed for dinner with Grandfather and Grandmother. They were having roast goose, and there was much to prepare. Kit couldn't focus on two things at once but remembered how he thought about the cakes in the shop window. After breakfast, Kit helped feed the animals with his father in the snow.

They all gathered around the table for a long time, sharing stories. Grandfather reminisced about his childhood, Father Vedder recounted Kit and Kat's skating adventures, and the siblings shared their encounter with St. Nicholas. Grandmother Winkle mentioned a tale of getting lost in the woods, where the boys remained brave despite hunger and fatigue. As night approached, they noticed a light in the distance and followed it through the dark forest. They stumbled over roots and stones until they found a hut where a kind old woman offered them shelter. Meanwhile, a wicked farmer encountered St. Nicholas at the market, leading to a miraculous rescue of the lost boys.
