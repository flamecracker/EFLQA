Long ago, the Greeks were taught by God but forgot His teachings. They began to worship idols of wood and stone, falling into sin and shame. They believed in many gods and spirits, like Zeus and Athena, who they thought lived around them. Even though their philosophers told them about the One True God, they clung to their idols and sinful ways, leading them to ruin. These Greeks lived in simple villages and farms, working hard and valuing skill and courage over wealth. They loved fairy tales and admired heroes who did great deeds for their country. The term 'hero' was given to those who were brave, skilled, and helped their nation. These stories, though not all true, teach us to do what is right and trust in God to guide us.|"['1.

Pelias, a cunning man, drew Jason in with kindness and feasting, softening his anger. Jason, intrigued by his cousins, heard the tale of Phrixus and the golden fleece. Pelias, lying about Phrixus' spirit tormenting him, sought Jason's advice on ridding himself of a troublesome neighbor. Feeling trapped, Jason realized Pelias' deceit and his own predicament. Despite the trap, Jason remembered his promise to Cheiron and saw an opportunity to fulfill his destiny. Outwitting Pelias, Jason boldly agreed to retrieve the golden fleece in exchange for the kingdom. Pelias, impressed by Jason's courage, agreed to the deal.

On the next day, Jason approached Pelias and requested a victim for a sacrifice to Hera. After the sacrifice, Hera inspired Jason to ask Pelias for two heralds to gather the princes of the Minuai, former pupils of the Centaur. Pelias, hoping they would never return, agreed. Hera influenced the princes, who gathered at Pagasai. Heroes like Heracles, Tiphys, Castor, and Polydeuces, and others joined. They constructed the ship Argo under Argus' guidance. Jason sought Orpheus, who agreed to join the quest for the Golden Fleece. They journeyed to Dodona and obtained a magic bough.

Long ago, the brave heroes set sail on the grand ship, Argo, to seek the golden fleece. Led by the wise Jason, they made a solemn vow before the gods to stand together in their perilous adventure. With Orpheus's magical song, they sought the blessing of the centaur, Cheiron, on the misty hill of Pelion. As they feasted and listened to tales of ancient battles, the heroes knew their journey was fraught with danger. Peleus, father of the invincible Achilles, bade farewell to his son and the wise centaur, knowing their return was uncertain.

The heroes rowed past sacred isles and narrow straits until they reached the land of Cyzicus, a kind prince who welcomed them. Tragically, Cyzicus was killed by terrible men with six arms, but Heracles avenged him. The heroes held games in his honor and continued their journey. They arrived at a bay where they rested and Heracles went hunting. Hylas, a young boy, was enchanted by water nymphs and disappeared under the lake. As the heroes faced challenges from giants and monsters, they encountered Phineus, plagued by the Harpies. The winged sons of the North-wind offered to help if Phineus righted his wrongs.

Zetes and Calais bid a somber farewell to their companions, explaining that they are destined to hunt the whirlwinds forever. The heroes are awestruck by the chaos caused by the Harpies and the sons of the North-wind chasing them. The whirlwinds flee to the south, pursued by the heroes, bringing sunshine in their wake. Zetes and Calais disappear, with conflicting tales of their fate. The Argonauts venture into the Black Sea with trepidation, passing through dangerous ice-crags with the help of a heron sent by Hera.

Once, a rich and mighty prince named Aietes was filled with fear and decided to visit the river-side to calm the nymphs and heroes who dwelt there. He rode in his golden chariot with his daughters, Medeia and Chalciope, and a retinue of servants and soldiers. As they approached the river, they saw the magnificent ship Argo and its heroic crew, led by the noble Jason. Aietes, adorned in gold and radiating power like the Sun, questioned the heroes' presence. Jason, emboldened by Hera, explained their quest for the golden fleece and sought peaceful cooperation. Aietes proposed a challenge: if one hero could complete his tasks, the fleece would be theirs. Despite the daunting odds, Jason and his companions faced the dilemma with courage and hope, aided by the wise Medeia's knowledge and compassion.|"[""1.

No wall is insurmountable, no challenge unbeatable. In the tale of Jason and the Argonauts, the hero seeks the golden fleece with the help of the enchantress Medeia. She bestows upon him a powerful ointment made from the magic ice-flower, granting him immense strength and protection. Jason, now imbued with extraordinary power, faces the magic bulls and the earth-born warriors of Aietes. With Medeia's spells and his newfound strength, Jason overcomes the bulls and the warriors, outwitting them with his might and courage. The earth swallows the fallen warriors, and Jason emerges victorious. Aietes, witnessing Jason's prowess, realizes he must confront this seemingly invincible hero.

The Minuai approached their ship, angered by Aietes' deception. Oileus suggested seizing the fleece by force, but Idas proposed a risky plan involving drawing lots. Jason, hoping for Medeia's aid, restrained them. Medeia realized her fate due to aiding them. Jason offered her escape and proposed she join them, promising her queenship. Despite her reluctance, Medeia agreed to help. She instructed Jason to bring his ship to the wood-side at midnight with Orpheus and one other. The heroes agreed, and Medeia calmed them, suggesting Orpheus bring his magic harp. Brimo, a witch-huntress, appeared with her hounds, causing fear.

In the dark of night, the heroes of the Argo fled swiftly down a swirling stream, passing black walls, temples, and castles of the East. They raced past sluice-mouths, fragrant gardens, and groves of strange fruits, until they heard the merry music of the surge on the bar in the moonlight. Aietes, in pursuit with his fleet, mourned the loss of his son Absyrtus, cast into the sea by his daughter Medeia. The Argonauts, under a curse, escaped Aietes but faced a storm sent by Zeus. Lost at sea, they struck a shoal, losing hope until the magic bough spoke. Medeia was spared, and the heroes, guided by her, set off into the unknown sea towards the West.

Alcinous acknowledged the Colchi as his guests and welcomed the heroes. The noble guests were bathed, clothed, and treated with respect. They were admired for their stature and prowess, though weathered by time. The heroes, acknowledging their stiff limbs, offered to showcase their strength in other ways. Alcinous appreciated their gesture but emphasized the island's preference for feasts and merriment over physical contests.

The heroes were entertained with music and dancing, with Orpheus enchanting them with tales of their epic journey. The merchant kings applauded the Argonauts, moved by the harrowing adventures recounted.

Alcinous smiled and reminded everyone of justice despite the charming minstrel's song. He called the kings to the square and posed a question - whether it's safer to offend the nearby Minuai or the distant Aietes. Alcinous' wisdom was praised, and the princes agreed to be cautious. Jason of the Colchi dismissed their quest for the lady, warning of her magical powers. Some Colchi agreed to settle in the lands nearby instead of returning home. The heroes rowed eastward, but a storm drove them south to the treacherous Syrtis quicksands. They struggled, lost hope, and landed on desolate African shores. Starving and exhausted, they managed to relaunch their ship and rowed northward. They sighted Crete and hoped for hospitality from King Minos.

The giant, Talus, was a fearsome creature made by Hephaistos, the Fire King. He guarded the coast of Crete, burning those who dared to land. Medeia, an enchantress, devised a plan to defeat Talus.

Once upon a time in Trœzene, there lived a princess named Aithra. She had a son named Theseus, who was known as the bravest lad in the land. Aithra's husband had forgotten about her and lived far away, so she spent her days at the temple of Poseidon, gazing at the bay and the purple peaks beyond. When Theseus turned fifteen, Aithra took him to the temple. She led him to a tall plane-tree and asked him to lift a great flat stone underneath it. Theseus struggled to lift the stone for years, but on his eighteenth birthday, he finally succeeded. Beneath the stone, he found a bronze sword and golden sandals.
