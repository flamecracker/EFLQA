In one of the stories, a tortoise falls from a tree onto a jaguar, killing him. Another tale tells of a terrapin falling from a shelf, stunning a fox and saving a rabbit. The tortoise outsmarts a jaguar by convincing him he's holding a root, and a fox tries to drown a terrapin but lets him go when the terrapin claims his tail is a stump-root. There's a story where the tortoise outruns a deer and another where he pretends to be stronger than a tapir. The tortoise ties a vine to a whale and a tapir, proving his strength. Similar stories involve a bear, rabbit, fox, and jaguar in various contests and tricks. These stories, shared by different cultures, hint at a common origin, possibly originating in Africa and spreading to South America and beyond.|"['Question 1:\nWhat is a common theme in the stories mentioned in the passage?\nA) Tortoises being outsmarted by other animals\nB) Terrapins saving rabbits from foxes\nC) Animals engaging in contests and tricks\nD) Jaguars hunting tortoises in the wild\nE) Deer outrunning tapirs in a race', 'Question 2:\nWhich animal does the tortoise convince he is holding a root?\nA) Jaguar\nB) Fox\nC) Terrapin\nD) Deer\nE) Tapir', ""Question 3:\nHow does the terrapin manage to save the rabbit from the fox?\nA) By pretending to be a stump-root\nB) By outrunning the fox\nC) By tying a vine to a whale\nD) By convincing the fox he's holding a root\nE) By pretending to be stronger than a tapir"", 'Question 4:\nWhat do the stories shared by different cultures hint at?\nA) A common origin in Asia\nB) A common origin in Europe\nC) A common origin in Australia\nD) A common origin in Africa\nE) A common origin in Antarctica', 'Question 5:\nWhich animal does the fox try to drown in one of the stories?\nA) Tortoise\nB) Jaguar\nC) Terrapin\nD) Deer\nE) Tapir', ""Question 6:\nHow does the tortoise prove his strength in one of the stories?\nA) By outrunning a jaguar\nB) By pretending to be a stump-root\nC) By tying a vine to a whale\nD) By convincing a fox he's holding a root\nE) By pretending to be stronger than a tapir""]"|['C) Animals engaging in contests and tricks', 'A) Jaguar', 'A) By pretending to be a stump-root', 'D) A common origin in Africa', 'C) Terrapin', 'C) By tying a vine to a whale']
One thing is definite. The tales about animals shared by the African Americans in the Southern States and Brazil were brought from Africa. The exact origin, whether from Africa, the Arabs, Egyptians, or even more ancient civilizations, remains uncertain. It is also unclear if the Native Americans acquired these stories from the African Americans or from an earlier source. This opens up a captivating area for further investigation. In Professor Hartt's Amazonian Tortoise Myths, a tale resembling one from Uncle Remus is recounted. The story involves Br'er Deer and Br'er Cooter competing in a ten-mile race to win the lady's hand in marriage. The narrative is rich in drama, progressing logically from start to finish with compelling twists. It seems somewhat allegorical, showcasing the triumph of helplessness over strength and mischief over malice. While the exact origin of these intriguing myth-stories is uncertain, they are undeniably characteristic of African American storytelling.|"[""1.

Once upon a time, Brer Rabbit encountered a sticky situation with the Tar-Baby. Despite his pleas, the Tar-Baby remained silent, causing Brer Rabbit to get entangled further when he tried to free himself. Brer Fox watched from a distance, amused by the unfolding events. As Brer Rabbit's attempts to break free only made things worse, Brer Fox couldn't contain his laughter. Eventually, Brer Rabbit found himself in a predicament, unable to move.

Uncle Remus paused and picked up a live coal of fire, transferring it to his pipe with skill, impressing the little boy. He then shared a tale of Brer Possum and Brer Coon. Brer Possum, not afraid, explained that he laughed when Mr. Dog tickled him, making him defenseless. Brer Possum, though ready to fight, couldn't stand tickling. Uncle Remus explained that to this day, Brer Possum surrenders when tickled in the ribs. He chuckled and continued the story of Brer Rabbit, a clever creature who always seemed to come out on top.

One time, in a far-off land, before any of us were born, the animals and creatures gathered among themselves for an assembly. In those days, the animals had a lot of sense, just like people. They decided to hold an assembly to sort out issues and hear complaints. The Lion, being the king, was present along with other creatures like the Rhinoceros, Elephant, Camels, and even the Crawfishes. They spoke, argued, cursed, and conducted their affairs. During a dispute, the Elephant accidentally stepped on a Crawfish, squashing it. This angered the other Crawfishes, who tried to voice their concerns, but amidst all the chaos, their voices were drowned out. Eventually, the Crawfishes burrowed underground, causing water to gush out, flooding the land and drowning all the creatures. And so, the lesson was learned that no creature should consider themselves superior to others.|"['1.

One evening, a little boy rushed out after supper to join Uncle Remus, his favorite storyteller. The boy found Uncle Remus laughing to himself in great delight.

Brer Fox saw Brer Rabbit come to the well, stop, jump into the bucket, and then disappear from sight. Brer Fox was the most astonished Fox you'd ever see. He sat in the bushes, trying to make sense of it all but couldn't figure it out. Eventually, he thought to himself, ""Well, if this doesn't surprise me, then I don't know what will."" Brer Fox crept closer, listening, but heard nothing. He peered down the well but saw and heard nothing. Meanwhile, Brer Rabbit was nearly scared out of his wits, fearing the bucket might tip over.

Once upon a time, Brer Rabbit heard his friends calling him, and off he went. This time, he managed to get the butter out so cleanly that he could see his reflection in the bottom of the bucket. He scraped it clean, licked it dry, and then went back to work looking more innocent than ever. When dinner time came, everyone began to eat, but Brer Rabbit kept looking lonely. Brer Fox and Brer Possum tried to cheer him up, but Brer Rabbit stayed lonesome. They noticed the butter was missing, and Brer Rabbit suggested a plan to catch the thief.

Once upon a time, in a lively gathering where molasses bubbled, Brer Rabbit boasted of being the fastest, Brer Fox claimed to be the sharpest, Brer Wolf declared himself the most cunning, and Brer Bear asserted his strength. But sly Brer Terrapin sat calmly, rocking in his chair. When challenged to a test of strength, Brer Terrapin accepted confidently. While the candy cooled, the group headed to the branch to witness the challenge. Brer Terrapin, no bigger than a palm, tied a rope to a clay root underwater. Brer Bear, with all his might, tried to pull Brer Terrapin, but the clever Terrapin had the rope secured. In the end, Brer Terrapin emerged victorious, proving that brains can outwit brawn.

When Miss Theodosia Huntingdon from Vermont decided to journey South in 1870, three reasons influenced her. Firstly, her brother, John Huntingdon, had settled in Georgia after marrying a local woman with ties to the Confederate army. Secondly, she was eager to explore what she envisioned as a distant and slightly uncivilized region. Lastly, concerns about her health nudged her to travel. Upon her arrival in Atlanta on October 12, 1870, amidst the chaos of the bustling station, she anticipated her brother's welcome. Amidst the confusion, a tall, gray-haired African American man approached her, exuding a mix of confidence and hesitation. Recognizing the name her brother often mentioned, she extended her hand in greeting, acknowledging the unexpected but somewhat picturesque encounter.|"[""1.

The distinct contrast between the inland and coastal African American communities, evident in their dialects, habits, and beliefs, often leads to deep-rooted biases that surface when given the chance. This divide was humorously highlighted in a recent incident in Atlanta. A man from Savannah had taken his body-servant, a proud and disdainful coastal negro, with him to the mountains of north Georgia. The servant, oozing superiority, looked down on all not from the rice-growing region. While strolling the streets, he encountered Uncle Remus, who was leisurely soaking up the sun. The Savannah servant, with an air of curiosity and judgment, approached Uncle Remus, setting the stage for a clash of cultures and attitudes.|['1.
