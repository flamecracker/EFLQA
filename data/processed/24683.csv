They arrived at their destination and entered a beautiful corridor guided by a bellboy. They stopped at a particular door that belonged to Nan and Bess for at least a day and night. Walter tipped the boy, used a key to open the door, revealing a stunning blue and gold room with twin beds, tables, and reading lamps. Nan then recounted the mysterious events involving two suspicious men they had encountered on the boat and near their stateroom. Grace and Rhoda listened intently as Nan shared her concerns.

Mr. Mason was asked by Bess if it was true that Palm Beach was only for wealthy people and showy women. He humorously replied that while there were some millionaires and overdressed women, most guests were nice regular folks. He explained that the millionaires usually stayed in private bungalows by the shore. As they approached the Royal Poinciana Hotel, Nan marveled at its size and mistook a similar building for its twin. The family checked into the hotel and were impressed by the lobby's coolness. They signed in and were taken to their rooms by a friendly bellboy. Nan and Bess loved their room's view of Lake Worth, while Grace and Rhoda faced the lake.

Nan and Walter found themselves on the veranda of the Royal Poinciana one night. The veranda appeared empty as the dance inside was lively, and it was too early for couples to seek the porch's cool breeze. Nan and Walter dashed hand in hand to the _Bargain Rush_ waiting in the garden. They hopped aboard, started the engine, and glided into the serene night. Walter, gazing at the moonlit lake, asked Nan if she preferred this to dancing. As they enjoyed their moonlit ride, a motorboat stirred up the lake but was soon forgotten.

Mr. Mason, filled with excitement, suggested stopping the car to explore the orange grove where Nan's widow's property might be.

Nan was abruptly awakened by a familiar shout and hastily fixed her disheveled appearance. She quickly retrieved her fallen hat and placed it back on her head, then stumbled to her feet.
