In the Valley of Mo, a magical place, people live without any poverty. They can pluck hats and rings from trees when ripe, without asking for permission.

Truella bravely descended the steps with her basket, only to be faced with a terrifying serpent blocking her path. Thinking quickly, she threw a lump of putty into the serpent's mouth, causing it to tie itself into a knot. Moving past the serpent, she entered a dimly lit cave where she encountered a hideous old woman with a large tooth. The old woman accidentally scratched out her own eyes and could no longer see. Truella encountered a cave filled with flying knives and daggers, but she used an iron ball to destroy them and safely passed through. In the next cave, she confronted a monster with the body of a zebra and other animal parts. Using a mirror from her basket, she scared the monster to death with its own reflection. Truella finally reached a cave lined with rubies where a Wizard awaited her. The Wizard tried to deceive her, but Truella used a magic veil to protect herself from his fiery trap.|"['1.

Truella faced danger in the cave as the Wizard tried to harm her. He opened a gulf that moved towards her, intending to make her fall in. Truella, realizing the threat, tried to escape but found the door locked. In a moment of fear, she threw a dagger at the Wizard, causing him to fall into the gulf, which then closed. She retrieved her hidden toe from the Wizard's cupboard, put it on, and escaped. Meanwhile, the Duchess Bredenbutta found herself in a strange land after drifting towards a Great Hole in a boat.

Bredenbutta followed the peculiar-looking people and encountered more of them, all with noses in the air. They followed her out of curiosity. When they reached Upsydoun's house, over a hundred Turvyland residents were behind her. Bredenbutta, tired and unaware of their customs, declined to lie down, which they took as a yes. The Duchess, left alone, found their ways confusing. At dinner, the family ate with their food in their ears, shocking Bredenbutta. When the youngest child got a foot stuck in a pocket, the mother rushed to help. After dinner, they played music with their toes and danced on their thumbs. Bredenbutta, bewildered, ate and asked to return home. They kindly guided her to the river, where she found oars for her boat and bid farewell.|"[""1.

Bredenbutta happily took the oars and placed them in her boat. The people of Turvyland bid her farewell by kissing her with their left ears and waving their toes. As the Duchess entered the boat, she was engulfed in a whirl of foam and roaring root beer, gasping for air. She clung to the boat's sides until it settled in the Valley of Mo. Determined to row safely home, she avoided the Great Hole. The Duchess preferred the natural ways of her home to the absurd customs of Turvyland. Meanwhile, in the Valley of Mo, the King's animal-cracker tree ripened, but the animals fought and fell to the ground, spattering chocolate mud. The King's youngest son, Fiddlecumdoo, sought adventure and found a bush bearing violins in the far east of Mo.|"['1.

After continuing his journey, Prince Fiddlecumdoo reached the Maple Plains, a smooth area made entirely of maple sugar. Riding swiftly on his bicycle, he soon encountered a wide river of pure maple syrup that he couldn't cross. Determined to move forward, the Prince boiled some syrup, creating a stringy bridge to cross the river. Spotting a giant house in the valley, he decided to visit and introduce himself to Mr. Hartilaf. Upon playing his violin near the giant's house, the giant, startled by the music, came out to see Prince Fiddlecumdoo. The giant invited the Prince in for dinner, placing him on the table where he used a toothpick as big as a sword to eat. As Fiddlecumdoo played his violin in the kitchen, the dancing-bear sausages hanging from the ceiling began dancing uncontrollably, causing chaos in the kitchen.|"['1.

The giant was surprised by the dancing bears turned into sausages. He asked the Prince to abandon the concert until the sausages were eaten. The giant invited the boy for a walk, but he declined. The giantess, busy with laundry, invited the Prince to join her. He was placed in her pocket to watch her work. Fascinated by the clothes-wringer, the Prince leaned out too far and fell into it. The giantess was upset and tried to help but struggled due to the Prince's thinness. She placed him carefully on the drawing-room table, explaining what had happened.

Once upon a time, there was a giant who helped a prince named Thinkabit. The prince had been rolled into the Valley of Mo by the giant to save him from being blown away. The people in the valley were frightened at first but then helped the prince back to the palace. The king, shocked by the prince's condition, sought advice from a Wise Donkey. The Donkey suggested filling the prince with air to restore his natural shape. The king followed the advice, and the prince was able to walk again.

The young monkeys in the cage started tossing peanuts to Zingle, the Prince, who was hungry and ate them. This delighted the monkeys who laughed.

Despite the monkeys not understanding him, Zingle tried to communicate. Eventually, a baby hippopotamus arrived, diverting the monkeys' attention. Seizing the opportunity, Zingle escaped by squeezing through the bars due to his reduced size. He ran to his kite, evading the monkeys by flying away with it as they watched in astonishment.|"['1.

The Yellow Hen shared a tale that angered the King, leading to the arrest of his Wise Men. Seeking a solution to a monstrous Dragon plaguing their land, the King proposed a plan to remove its teeth. A large pair of forceps was crafted, and the army marched to the Dragon's castle. Despite the King's efforts to pull out the Dragon's tooth, the beast's unique dental structure thwarted their attempts. The Dragon, unafraid, cleverly tied its tail to the porch, causing its body to stretch as the forceps clung to its tooth.
