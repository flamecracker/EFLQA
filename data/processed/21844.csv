Turkey Proudfoot, the proud ruler of Farmer Green's turkeys, was adored by the hen turkeys for his magnificent tail and shimmering feathers. When he strutted, they marveled at his elegance. However, not everyone shared the same admiration. The geese on the farm hissed at him, finding his loud gobbling annoying.

Despite his grandeur, he was put in his place by Farmer Green when he tried to fight him. The geese, odd creatures who stuck together, kept their distance from the rest of the farmyard.

Turkey Proudfoot, despite disliking the sound of other turkeys gobbling, found joy in the opportunity for a brawl that their calls presented. He often stood still, hoping to catch a nearby young gobbler testing its voice. These fledgling turkeys had to go far to avoid Turkey Proudfoot's attacks.

Determined to locate the source, he noticed a cage swaying with a green figure clinging to it under the piazza ceiling.

Turkey Proudfoot's peace of mind was short-lived. While wandering through the meadow, a great commotion in the farmyard caught his attention. Old Mr. Crow flew over from the woods to investigate and then returned. Turkey Proudfoot, unimpressed by Johnnie Green's pets, expressed disdain for their lack of impressive tails.
