Once upon a time, the mighty dog Crusoe was just a tiny pup. Don't dismiss this fact too quickly, dear reader. Just like you've seen a towering man who once was a helpless baby, Crusoe too had humble beginnings. Picture a squirming, chubby pup, blind and round as a tallow candle. But Crusoe's puppy days are not just a trivial detail. In the wild Mustang Valley, where settlers sought refuge from the encroaching frontier, Crusoe's tale begins. Led by the intrepid Major Hope, these settlers faced the dangers of the untamed wilderness. As the squatters carved out a new home, the valley thrived.

Crusoe's parents were magnificent Newfoundland dogs, received as a gift from a friend who brought them from Newfoundland. The father, Crusoe, and the mother, Fan, were of genuine breed. Crusoe's name came from unknown origins, while Fan was named after the fisherman's wife who gave her to Major Hope's friend. Crusoe was later given away to a gentleman in Florida. Crusoe, junior, was born alongside siblings who tragically drowned in a river. Their mother saved Crusoe, who was named after his father. A Sioux Indian family arrived in Mustang Valley during Indian summer, watched by a young hunter. The Indians prepared supper, and the hunter, unlike most backwoods hunters, was spirited and loved solitary forest walks. He was earnest, amiable, and had a bright blue eye and a reddish-brown hair, dressed in traditional hunter attire.|"[""1.

The young man chuckled at the baby playing with a puppy, but his smile vanished when he witnessed the Indian woman cruelly beating the pup. The youth, named Varley, recognized the pup as Crusoe, a beloved dog in the region. Outraged, Varley rescued Crusoe from the woman's grasp. His companion, Joe Blunt, a seasoned hunter, disapproved of Varley's impulsive reaction. After the incident, Major Hope, the leader of the settlement, decided to leave, giving away his belongings, including Crusoe. To determine Crusoe's new owner, a shooting competition was organized.

"Major Hope organized a shooting competition where the winner would receive a unique rifle with two sets of locks, a dog named Fan, and her pup. The participants were a group of hunters, including Henri, a clumsy but good-humored man who was a favorite in the settlement. Henri was known for his reckless yet successful hunting style. Despite his awkwardness and poor shooting skills, he managed to excel in stalking deer due to his incredible agility and strength. Henri's unique ability to move silently through the wilderness made him the best stalker in the valley. Although he was short-sighted and could only hit targets within fifty yards, his exceptional physical abilities made him a formidable opponent in wrestling, running, and leaping. Henri's habit of ""plunging"" into action often got him into trouble, but his immense strength and agility helped him overcome challenges."|['1.

"Back in the day, hunters in the wild west used a practice called ""driving the nail"" to test their shooting skills. This involved shooting at a nail until it was fully driven into a plank or tree. During a match, the major set the distance to seventy yards. A hunter named Jim, known as Scraggs, used a Kentucky rifle with small bullets called a pea-rifle. The hunters quickly loaded their rifles and aimed without hesitation. After a few minutes, the nail was surrounded by bullet-holes, with Joe Blunt hitting closest. The best shots, Jim and Dick, were chosen to compete again. However, a commotion caused by a dog named Crusoe disrupted Jim's shot, and in his anger, he almost harmed the pup. The major then handed a silver rifle to Dick, confident in his shooting abilities."|"['1.

The hunters gathered around Dick to celebrate his success and admire the prize. Feeling a mix of shyness and joy, Dick quietly slipped away and approached a boy named Marston. Marston had always dreamed of owning a rifle but had little hope of getting one. When Dick offered him his old rifle, Marston's joy mirrored Dick's own. However, Dick faced a new challenge when his loyal dog, Fan, refused to leave his side. After a moment of hesitation, Fan decided to follow Dick to his cottage by the lake. In the evenings, Dick would return to his mother's cottage where he found comfort in her loving gaze. Mrs. Varley's face, weathered by age, radiated a timeless beauty of genuine love and care that touched everyone around her.|"['1.

Young Varley's mother lived in a small cottage made of logs in the Mustang Valley. The cottage had two rooms, one for Mrs. Varley and one for her son Dick. Daniel Hood slept in the kitchen, which also served as a living room. The cottage had a surprised look with two windows like eyes and a door in the center. The beautiful scenery of the valley always amazed visitors. Dick, eager to hunt, showed his mother a rifle and expressed his desire to venture out. Soon, a group of trappers arrived seeking supplies for a revenge mission against the Pawnee tribe. Despite warnings, they took the ammunition and rode off, fueled by a thirst for vengeance.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat type of building did Young Varley's mother live in?\nA) Brick house\nB) Cottage made of logs\nC) Mansion\nD) Apartment\nE) Tent"", 'Question 2:\nHow many rooms did the cottage have?\nA) One\nB) Two\nC) Three\nD) Four\nE) Five', 'Question 3:\nWho slept in the kitchen of the cottage?\nA) Mrs. Varley\nB) Dick\nC) Daniel Hood\nD) Trappers\nE) Pawnee tribe', 'Question 4:\nWhat did the group of trappers seek when they arrived at the cottage?\nA) Food\nB) Water\nC) Shelter\nD) Revenge supplies\nE) Money', 'Question 5:\nWhat tribe were the trappers seeking revenge against?\nA) Sioux\nB) Apache\nC) Pawnee\nD) Cherokee\nE) Navajo', ""Question 6:\nWhat fueled the trappers' mission as they rode off from the cottage?\nA) Greed\nB) Fear\nC) Curiosity\nD) Thirst for vengeance\nE) Hunger""]"|['B) Cottage made of logs', 'B) Two', 'C) Daniel Hood', 'D) Revenge supplies', 'C) Pawnee', 'D) Thirst for vengeance']
Young Varley's excitement diminished when he discovered the purpose of the trappers. He abandoned the idea of joining them in the mountains but still yearned to explore the rocky terrain and vast prairies. While he dutifully cared for his mother's livestock and occasionally hunted deer, he focused on training his dog, Crusoe. Crusoe, a Newfoundland dog known for its intelligence, had a black and white coat. Varley's first attempt to train Crusoe was unsuccessful, but he persisted. Despite Crusoe's clumsiness and initial lack of understanding, Varley patiently continued the training. Crusoe's eagerness to play and lack of interest in commands amused Varley. Despite the challenges, Varley remained patient and committed to Crusoe's training, showing no signs of frustration with the slow progress.|"[""1.

Young Varley used a clever strategy to train his dog, Crusoe. At first, he tried to reward Crusoe with pieces of meat to fetch a mitten but realized this wouldn't work. So, Varley changed tactics by withholding breakfast and focusing on training. Initially confused, Crusoe learned quickly when Varley used the meat as a reward for fetching the mitten. Over time, Crusoe's training progressed, and he became a skilled companion for hunting. Crusoe's abilities extended beyond fetching; he could swim powerfully, dive deep, and display remarkable intelligence. Crusoe's loyalty and intelligence made him an invaluable hunting partner, capable of retrieving lost items, herding game, and guarding objects diligently. Varley was amazed by Crusoe's abilities and the deep bond they shared, showcasing the dog's exceptional training and intelligence.|"[""1.

In appearance, Crusoe, a majestic Newfoundland, stood out for his immense size. Despite his potential for a wolfish look, his face bore a gentle, humble expression typical of his breed.

Crusoe, a loyal dog, showed his master, Dick Varley, his bravery and protectiveness when he swiftly rescued a little dog from a savage attack. Crusoe's actions demonstrated his devotion and quick thinking in the face of danger. Despite his heroics, Crusoe also enjoyed his own adventures, exploring the woods and lakeside with a little canine friend named Grumps. While Crusoe engaged in various activities like botanizing and geologizing, Grumps simply watched in admiration. The two dogs shared a silent companionship, finding joy in each other's presence. However, Grumps drew the line at water activities, preferring to stay dry while Crusoe reveled in swimming. Later, an officer and cavalry arrived in Mustang Valley to improve relations between settlers and Native Americans, with Joe Blunt leading the diplomatic efforts. Joe's selection for this crucial role highlighted his expertise and respect among the community.|"['1.

That evening, Dick Varley sat in his mother's kitchen cleaning his rifle while she prepared supper and chatted about a hen's egg-laying habits. Fan slept in a corner, and Crusoe watched quietly. Joe mentioned the soldiers eating buffalo tongues at the block-house and the need for peace talks with the Red-skins. Dick's mother blessed him for his peacemaking mission and chose Henri to accompany him.

For a while, they rode silently side by side, lost in their own thoughts. Crusoe stayed close to his master's horse. The older hunters pondered their mission and chances of success, their faces serious and eyes fixed on the ground. Dick Varley, however, was filled with the excitement of his first adventure. The landscape danced in his mind - mountains, plains, Indians, bears, buffaloes - fueling his youthful vigor. As they rode through forests, open grounds, and prairies, Dick's eyes sparkled with curiosity. Joe Blunt and Henri, seasoned hunters, remained calm in the face of nature's beauty, accustomed to its wonders. Joe explained how nature's abundance can be unpredictable, cautioning Dick about the challenges they might encounter. Spotting a deer in the distance, Joe advised Dick on how to approach it quietly. With Crusoe at his side, Dick stealthily closed in on the deer, using the undulating terrain to his advantage.

The small deer of the North American plains is very curious about things it doesn't understand and won't stop until it figures out the mystery. Taking advantage of this, Dick did what Indians and hunters usually do in such situations - he tied a piece of cloth to the end of his ramrod, hid himself, and waved the flag in the air. The deer noticed it, perked up its ears, and cautiously moved closer to investigate. When the flag was lowered, a loud noise rang out, and the deer fell dead. Meanwhile, Crusoe, the dog, startled the horse to get it moving. They rode through the woods and plains all day until Joe Blunt found a spot near a stream to camp under a birch tree. The horses were hobbled and picketed to prevent them from wandering, especially in areas where Indians might be nearby. Despite the precautions, crafty thieves could still sneak in, cut the horses' ties, and escape with them.|"[""1.

After finishing their supper, the hunters settled down with tea and pipes, engaging in conversation. They then prepared for rest by arranging their saddles in a row, wrapping themselves in blankets, and using their saddles as pillows. The night passed with each hunter sleeping by the fire, their rifles close by, and Crusoe the dog guarding them faithfully. As dawn broke, Dick Varley's excitement was palpable as he greeted the day with enthusiasm. He leaped up, embraced Crusoe, and set off into the woods with the dog at his heels. The sight of the vast prairie filled Dick with awe and joy, prompting him to let out a triumphant yell before galloping across the boundless grasslands with his companions in tow. The prairies, resembling an ocean of grass, were a sight to behold, dotted with islands of trees and bushes.

"The hunters changed course slightly and rode through a hollow between the prairie waves towards a clump of willows. Before reaching it, they crossed a barren plain with no flowers or birds. Suddenly, they came across a colony of ""prairie-dogs,"" which were actually marmots, not dogs, resembling squirrels. These little creatures burrowed under the soil and created mounds. As the hunters approached, the prairie-dogs became furious, chattering and wagging their tails impertinently. They would dive into their holes at the slightest movement from the hunters, only to pop back out as if by magic. Each prairie-dog lived with an owl, living in harmony in the same hole. The owls likely took over the holes dug by the doggies, finding them timid and harmless. This unusual partnership intrigued the hunters as they observed the lively activity of the prairie-dog city."|['1.

In the wilderness, a group of friends encountered a peculiar dog-like creature called a doggie. As they observed the doggies, dark clouds gathered overhead, signaling an impending storm. Hurriedly, they sought shelter under a clump of willows. Despite the rain pouring down, Crusoe, the loyal dog, refused to seek comfort. To shield themselves from the rain, the friends fashioned a makeshift hut using a bush and buffalo robes. However, the rain seeped through, leaving them drenched. Resigned to their fate, they sat together, enduring the wetness. Dick, trying to lift their spirits, suggested they eat and rest.

The day after the dark night was warm and splendid. The sun rose brightly, filling the air with steam from the damp ground. The wet campers quickly used the sun to dry their things and make soup. They endured the mosquitoes and flies. A week later, Joe Blunt predicted they would find buffaloes soon. Dick Varley, new to the prairies, was excited. He heard about the animals but wanted to see them himself. They spotted a buffalo wallow and heard a hissing sound. They dismounted and crept towards a group of buffalo cows and a massive old bull. The bison, not buffalo, were huge and fierce. The hunters aimed to hunt them for supper.|['1.

The movement of white settlers westward has pushed the buffalo to the prairies between the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains, reducing their numbers. Despite this, they remain countless in the distant plains. Their dark brown color changes with the seasons, lightening in winter. The buffalo resembles an ox but is larger in the head and shoulders, covered in shaggy hair, giving it a fierce look. With a large hump on the shoulder, the buffalo's front is bigger than its hindquarters. When wounded, the buffalo, especially the bull, becomes ferocious, charging with rage but can be scared easily. Their vision is limited due to the structure of their neck and eyes, making them less threatening to hunters. Despite their clumsiness, buffaloes can run fast when frightened, but they tire quickly. A herd of buffaloes in panic is a formidable sight, charging headlong in terror, oblivious to danger. The wallowing behavior, seen in the hot months, is a method to cool off and escape flies. The leader of the herd prepares the wallow by digging into the mud, creating a mud bath to cool down.|['1.

Bulls often coat themselves in mud, allowing it to dry before washing it off with rain and rolling on the grass. A group of hunters fired at a herd, causing chaos as the animals fled. One cow was wounded, and a young bull was hit. Dick, determined to finish the job, reloaded his rifle and followed the wounded bull. The bull charged at Dick, who stood his ground, dodging the bull's attack and shooting it. Crusoe, Dick's loyal dog, joined the fight, distracting the bull and allowing Dick to reload and take the final shot. With Crusoe's help, Dick successfully brought down the buffalo.|"['1.

"Crusoe's anger disappeared immediately when he saw his master safe, and he showed his joy by playing around him. Crusoe wagged his tail and looked at Dick with a look that said, ""I would do anything for you."" Crusoe's love for his master was immense, and only kindness could earn such loyalty. The group, after preparing buffalo meat, continued their journey. Joe, covered in blood, explained the mystery of the green circles on the plains, caused by buffaloes.

As they rode closer to their target, the horsemen encircled the buffaloes, causing chaos as the animals panicked and clashed. The hunters then charged in, initiating a destructive frenzy. Dust clouds enveloped the scene, hindering visibility. Some riders circled, shooting arrows into the cows, while others plunged into the melee, spearing the buffaloes. In the ensuing chaos, wounded buffaloes retaliated, injuring horses. Amid the tumult, some hunters leaped onto the buffaloes' backs, swiftly navigating the circle. Despite casualties, the hunters emerged victorious, with the buffalo herd decimated. The Native Americans, led by a formidable chief, met the hunters with suspicion, highlighting the strained relations between the two groups. The chief, wary of the settlers' encroachment on their lands, deliberated peace terms, while tensions simmered. The encounter turned tense when an Indian seized a hunter's rifle, prompting a potentially volatile situation.|"['1.

In the distance, a chief rode into the circle of horsemen, his authoritative presence overshadowing Mahtawa. The hunters felt uneasy as the chief scowled at them, although his noble demeanor was striking. Joe, standing proudly, conveyed a message from the Pale-face chief, proposing peace and trade. The Indian chief, San-it-sa-rish, doubted the Pale-face's intentions, pointing to the goods. Joe clarified that the gifts were for the Pawnee chief and peace offerings. The rifle was returned, signifying acceptance, and the hunters rode with the Indians towards camp. Along the way, they encountered women and children heading to the hunt, while braves ate raw buffalo liver, much to Dick's disgust.

As far as the eye could see, scattered herds of horses roamed the prairies. Little boys, devoid of clothing, tended to these horses, enjoying shooting practice with small bows and arrows. These young boys became skilled bowmen, able to hit their targets with remarkable accuracy. The survival of the Indian tribes depended on their hunting skills, particularly in hunting buffalo. The tribes would face extinction if the buffalo were to disappear. Despite the essential role of animals in their survival, the tribes hunted recklessly, sometimes killing animals needlessly for sport or specific parts. The precarious nature of their food supply meant that they could go from scarcity to abundance in a short time. The village was situated near a beautiful lake with islands, where children played in canoes.

Joe sat down on a grassy bank to watch an Indian dandy making his toilet. The dandy greased himself with buffalo-fat, then rubbed himself dry, leaving his skin shiny. He used a small mirror to apply vermilion to his face, giving it a fiery red look. He styled a scalp-lock on his shaved head, then adorned himself with ornaments, beads, and moccasins. The dandy spent time perfecting his appearance, adjusting his paint and attire. Once satisfied, he mounted his horse, decorated with red paint and feathers. With a fan of wild goose feathers and a whip, the dandy rode out for a leisurely stroll. Meanwhile, other men engaged in horse races, jumping, wrestling, and javelin-throwing games nearby.

Joe expressed gratitude for Henri's safety and mentioned sending gifts to the Native Americans. He explained how the Indians on the west of the Rocky Mountains traded goods for horses and skins. Suddenly, they heard cries of terror as they saw an Indian woman running towards a waterfall where a child was struggling in the water. Crusoe, a brave Newfoundland dog, leaped into action, trying to save the child. Despite his efforts, the child was swept over the fall. The child's mother, in a canoe, anxiously awaited the child's fate. Crusoe managed to rescue the child twice, bringing it to safety. Overwhelmed with relief, the mother embraced her child warmly.

"Joe noticed a significant shift in the mood of the meeting when he mentioned his mission of peace to rival tribes, causing the Pawnees to be upset that not all goods were for them. Some even threatened to object. San-it-sa-rish, however, stood by his promise of brotherhood. After a peaceful resolution, Joe shared goods with the tribes. A feast followed in another tent, considered a special event or ""medicine"" among the Indians. The term ""medicine"" holds mystical significance. The feast featured maize porridge.

After the passionate orators finished their speeches, wooden bowls filled with maize porridge were placed in front of the guests. Before eating, a portion was set aside for their gods with mysterious rituals. The feast began, and guests were expected to swallow every bite quickly. The faster one finished, the more esteemed they were. The Indians, accustomed to alternating between feast and famine, ate excessively. Children, especially, swelled like balloons after meals. Dick and Joe Blunt had voracious eaters across from them who helped finish their portions. Henri struggled to finish his own share, falling in the savages' esteem. The Indians' incredible capacity for food amazed the guests. Later that night, Henri listened to a unique serenade by nearly two thousand howling dogs, creating a surreal orchestra under the stars.|"['1.

When Crusoe first heard an unusual noise, he reacted swiftly, showing his teeth and leaping out of the tent in anger and surprise. After realizing what caused the disturbance, he returned calmly, displaying contempt as he settled back beside his master. Meanwhile, Dick Varley sat pondering by the fire, reflecting on his recent experiences in the Pawnee village. Joe expressed concern about their situation, fearing the intentions of Mahtawa, who seemed determined to take their possessions. As tensions rose, Henri's rifle, a marvel to the Indians due to its unique abilities, became a focal point. Misunderstandings led to a confrontation, resulting in Henri being restrained despite Dick's attempts to intervene.

Many Indians seemed to agree with the Pale-face's speech, but the crafty chief Mahtawa quickly intervened. He accused the Pale-faces of deceit, claiming they planned to make peace with the Pawnee's enemies and were spies. The chief threatened to hang their scalps in their wigwams and keep their goods. The hunters, including Joe Blunt and Henri, were caught in the middle of this tense situation. As they planned their escape over supper, they realized the challenges ahead.

Dick led his friends through the tents towards the lake, chatting loudly to avoid suspicion. They left their rifles behind. In a canoe, they crossed the lake, singing as they paddled. Once on the other side, they moved swiftly through the woods to the prairie. They circled around to approach the bluff from behind. They played a game with Crusoe, the dog, and then headed back to camp. Joe and an Indian woman made secret plans to lead the horses to the willow-bluff. Joe kept the Indians happy with trinkets and tales of white men's wealth. At night, Dick used Crusoe to sneak goods to the bluff while keeping up appearances with a stuffed pack. Joe decided to leave the camp, and on a dark night, they made their move, watched closely by the suspicious Mahtawa.|"['1.

The leader confidently approached the group, knowing they wouldn't dare use their weapons near the camp at night. Despite the surprise, they agreed to move forward. When the savage stopped, Joe swiftly subdued him to prevent an alarm. They disarmed him and escorted him away. The captive, realizing he was overpowered, complied. They tied him to a tree and left him under the watchful eyes of a fierce dog. Quickly gathering their belongings, they mounted their horses and fled into the night.

After a long and tiring day of hunting, the three friends found themselves resting comfortably under a willow bush, gazing at the twinkling stars above. The excitement and physical exertion had worn them out, but now they were at peace. They had just enjoyed a meal of freshly cooked antelope steak and were wrapped snugly in their blankets. The horses nearby were content, munching on grass, ensuring a safe night's sleep. The fear of danger was gone, and the scent of wildflowers filled the air. Henri teased Joe about the vastness of the stars, while their loyal dog, Crusoe, listened intently. As the night deepened, Dick's pipe fell, signaling the end of their evening. Joe, eager to start the day, roused his friends, prompting Henri to wake up with a start, coughing on pipe ashes. Henri, instead of blaming Joe, directed his annoyance at Dick for not being awake yet.|"['1.

Dick's horse stumbled into a badger hole, causing him to soar through the air in a graceful arc. Despite the fall, Dick quickly rose, chuckling, as his friends rushed to his aid. Accidents like these are common on the prairies, where holes dot the high, dry grounds. Dick, chasing a prong-horned antelope, showcased the animal's speed and agility. These creatures, with slender limbs and beautiful eyes, are hard to catch due to their keen senses. By exploiting their curiosity, hunters can draw them close for a shot. As Dick and his friends spotted buffalo herds, they decided to give chase, spurred on by the thrill of the hunt. With the buffalo in sight, the hunters spurred their horses, racing to close the distance.|"[""1.

As the three hunters approached the buffalo herd, each selected their target. Henri, being nearsighted, unknowingly aimed for the largest buffalo, a tough old bull. Joe swiftly took down a fat young cow with his first shot, while Dick almost shot Crusoe, their loyal dog, who leaped at the animal's throat unexpectedly. Henri, determined to catch the bull, spurred his horse forward, but failed to notice the warning signs given by the buffalo's tail. Ignoring the buffalo's fierce charge, Henri attempted a shot, only to find himself sprawled on the ground with his horse rolling away. Feeling remorse for killing more animals than necessary, the hunters left the bull carcass for the wolves.

Joe aimed his rifle and fired, bringing down the old bull with a final groan. Startled by the shot, the wolves scattered but lingered nearby, knowing they would soon feast on the remains. Dick, feeling regretful, pondered on the wolves' nature. He considered how they followed their instincts, unlike humans who often ignore their conscience. The trio reached a creek, where they halted to eat. Joe marveled at the need for food, contrasting it with snakes that can go long periods without eating. Despite missing their meat, Dick shot a wild turkey and found grapes and plums. Attempting a new dish, he concocted a thick porridge that Crusoe, their dog, refused. The hunters continued their journey, battling mosquitoes and horse-flies. Despite the annoyances, they pressed on, encountering minor obstacles like cockchafers and locusts.|"['1.

For many days, three hunters roamed the vast prairie in search of a Sioux Indian village but couldn't find one as the Indians often moved with the buffalo herds. They cautiously avoided small Indian groups, fearing they might be hostile. While well-fed by buffalo and deer, they dared not light a fire at night for fear of detection by prowling Indians. One night, desperate for water, they found a salty pool. Joe filtered the water to make it drinkable, though unpalatable. Spotting pursuing Indians, they raced on horseback, knowing their endurance was their only hope. The chase was fierce, with the hunters aiming for a distant line of trees. The Indians, on swift horses, closed in, but the hunters strategized to outmaneuver them.|"['1.

Crusoe's loyal dog, Dick, bravely leaped to defend his master when a savage on horseback tried to capture Crusoe. Despite the horse's frenzy, Dick managed to keep control and outpace the pursuing Indians. However, a mishap caused the horse to fall, injuring itself. With the Indians closing in, Dick made a daring move by leaping into a river from a high cliff to escape. The Indians, unable to follow, stood at the riverbank, ready with their bows.

Young though he was, and inexperienced in such wild combat, Dick knew what kind of welcome awaited him when he surfaced. So, he stayed underwater as long as possible, swimming vigorously while caring for his rifle. When he finally emerged, a flurry of arrows narrowly missed him, prompting him to dive back down. Escaping his Indian pursuers, he reached the safety of the opposite bank, where he pondered his next move. Despite the grim circumstances of being alone in a vast wilderness, Dick's resilient spirit and resourcefulness shone through. He checked his rifle and ammunition, finding his powder dry and his bullets sufficient. His belongings included essential supplies like a hunting knife, maple sugar, and a precious Bible with a comforting message from his mother.

Dick's eyes welled up with tears as he unexpectedly heard his mother's voice echo in the lonely wilderness. He had not embraced religion before, but the comforting words from his mother's parting gift touched him deeply. The sun was scorching, and a gentle breeze dried his clothes as he prepared his rifle and set off into the woods. Despite feeling light-hearted, he was determined to find his companions. Following the trail, he crossed a river and continued his pursuit, fueled by hope. As night fell, he lost the trail among buffalo tracks but found shelter under willow trees. With only unripe berries for supper, he sought solace in reading from the Bible, finding comfort in its words amidst solitude.|"[""1.

On the very same spot, Crusoe rested and slept deeply for four hours. He woke up, quickly ate a scrap of food, then hurried over the prairie to where he had the fight with the Indian. Following his master's steps, he leaped across the river, landing further up than Dick had. Crusoe, a strong swimmer, had no trouble crossing. He searched for Dick's trail, finally finding him by Salt Creek. Dick was overjoyed to see his loyal dog Crusoe again. The dog, confused by Dick's emotional outburst, barked and wagged his tail before realizing Dick needed help. Crusoe even tried a mournful howl to help Dick recover from his fainting spell. The dog then dug in the sand at Dick's command, expecting to find something buried beneath. Despite the false alarm, Crusoe's loyalty and dedication to Dick never wavered.|"['1.

Dick Varley's worries ended as he woke feeling refreshed and joyful the next day. His recovering strength surprised him, and he attempted to leap up, only to stumble. Thankful for his health, he drank from a pool, read the Bible earnestly, and rested. While journeying, he encountered prairie-dogs and shot one for food. He later rested by a stream, hunting a turkey. Continuing, he glimpsed a buffalo, shot it, and felt Crusoe, his dog, understood him. The buffalo fell after a second shot.

"Dick clearly understood Crusoe, as he laughed and called him a ""funny dog."" They planned to camp in a beautiful plain near a stream and a clump of trees. Dick talked to Crusoe about their buffalo and how they would watch over it together. He shared his plans to make a willow wigwam for them to sleep in. Despite Crusoe not fully grasping the conversation, Dick found solace in speaking to him. After cutting the buffalo's tongue and setting up camp, Dick lit a fire and cooked buffalo tongue slices. Crusoe watched attentively, responding with various head and facial movements. Dick found the syrup he made with maple sugar surprisingly delicious, showing the power of imagination and the mind's ability to find comfort even in challenging situations."|['1.

Dick intentionally withheld the dog's dinner so they could enjoy it together. Between each bite Dick took, he shared a bite with Crusoe. They ate lovingly together, making it the best and happiest supper for Dick. Feeling much better after his recent illness, Dick, now accompanied by Crusoe, was following the trail of his lost comrades towards the Rocky Mountains. Carrying buffalo and animal skins, they encountered a group of mustangs that fled in surprise. Creasing a wild horse, a delicate task, requires a steady hand. Mustangs, descendants of Spanish steeds brought to the New World, roam freely in the western wilderness. Indians learned to capture and tame these horses for hunting and war. The beauty and strength of wild mustangs in their natural habitat are truly remarkable.|['1.

Cortez brought not only horses but also priests on donkeys. The donkeys, though not used in battle, joined the horses in freedom. Wild asses roam the western prairies, unlike the domesticated ones at home. These wild asses are powerful creatures that resemble horses. Dick and Crusoe spotted a herd of mustangs in a green hollow. Dick prepared to approach them using a noose and hobbles. He admired the beauty of the wild horses, especially a dark brown leader. Dick aimed to crease the leader, shooting accurately and causing a commotion among the herd.

The challenge began for Dick as he tried to tame a wild horse. He knew about the method used by the Indians, but the horse's strength made it seem impossible. After struggling for hours, Dick decided to change his approach. He released the horse and mounted it, holding on tight as the horse bucked and leaped wildly. Dick managed to stay on, showing his skill as a rider. The horse raced across the plains, with Dick riding like a pro. The pace was intense, and they covered miles of open land.

Trees and bushes rushed by in a confusing blur as Dick rode his mustang towards the river. With a daring spirit, he urged the horse on, crossing the river in a single bound. As they galloped through the open plain, the mustang showed signs of fatigue. Dick then used gentle commands to calm and guide the horse, eventually crossing the river and making their way back. Despite the long journey and the horse's weariness, Dick's patience and care led to a successful return to camp. He tended to the horse, allowing it to graze, and rested with his loyal dog, Crusoe.

Dick approached the wild horse confidently, petting its head and stroking its nose. He made sure not to show any fear or hesitation, as this could startle the horse. After some time, he moved on to stroke its neck, shoulders, back, and limbs gently. He then walked around the horse, sometimes getting closer and sometimes moving away, always staying calm and steady. Dick went to the stream, filled his cap with water, and offered it to the horse, who was initially suspicious but eventually drank eagerly. He continued to offer water until the horse's thirst was quenched. Dick then patted the horse, untied him, and gently mounted his back, despite the horse's initial resistance.

Dick swiftly tracked his lost friends while ensuring not to overexert his loyal dog and newfound companion. Each evening, he camped under tree shade or in the open prairie, securing his horse and setting up camp. Charlie, his new companion, quickly adapted to the wilderness and became at ease with Dick's presence. However, Charlie's fear of solitude was evident when Dick and Crusoe wandered out of sight, causing Charlie to neigh loudly in distress. Despite struggling to find wood and water, Dick managed with a bladder of syrup and buffalo dung for fuel. Charlie's playful antics made capturing him a challenge, leading Dick to try a new approach by walking away. This left Charlie bewildered but eventually accepting his independence.

Walter Cameron led a diverse group of about 120 people, including men, women, and children, on a hunting trip to the unknown lands of the Snake Indians. The band, made up of Canadians, half-breeds, Iroquois, and Scotchmen, relied on their skills with guns and beaver-traps. Carrying over 200 traps and supplies on nearly 400 horses, they ventured into the wilderness. Depending on hunting for food, they faced uncertain meals, sometimes feasting and other times nearly starving. Despite the challenges, they had amassed a significant collection of valuable beaver-skins. As they prepared to confront a group of Peigans, young hunter Dick Varley eagerly joined the mission with his loyal dog, Crusoe. The group rode through moonlit valleys and rugged terrains, guided by an Indian scout, until they reached a resting spot with wood and water.|"[""1.

The horses were tied up, a fire lit, a quick bite eaten, the watch set, and then each man cleared the snow, laid branches on the ground, wrapped in a blanket, and slept with feet near the fire. After two hours, they woke, and as dawn broke, they resumed their journey. They traveled for two nights and a day until they stumbled upon nine Indians who seemed startled but made no move to flee. Cameron, realizing they were a war-party, confronted them, stating he sought peace and trade. The Indians, surprised by his knowledge, agreed to guide him to their camp. Despite their denial of knowing about the prisoners, Cameron remained hopeful, suspecting they were deceitful. As they set off towards the Peigan camp, the Indians led the way with minimal gear. Upon reaching a valley, they saw smoke rising from a distance, indicating the camp ahead. Although the group was outnumbered, the trappers, known for their courage and fearlessness, were undeterred by the odds. Most trappers were indifferent to the news, while some even mocked the idea of facing two hundred Indians. Cameron's men, including some unruly characters, were unafraid and ready for the challenge.|"['1.

Master Dick acknowledged his error in not stopping the man who had gone too far ahead. The trappers hurried forward on horseback, causing alarm among the Peigans. As the trappers approached on foot, the Peigans resumed their calm demeanor. A council was called, and both groups gathered around the fire. Crusoe, the dog, showed agitation towards the Indians. The traders expressed their desire for friendship and trade. The Peigans denied having any prisoners and offered peace through a pipe ceremony. Suspicion arose that the prisoners might have been hidden among the mountains. The traders prepared for possible conflict, with Cameron instructing his men to be ready but not to shoot until given the order. The tension between the groups grew as they negotiated the release of the prisoners.|['1.

In an instant, the trappers sprang up, rifles ready, facing the surprised savages. The Peigans, unaccustomed to direct combat, hesitated, knowing the deadly threat before them. Cameron, with Dick and Crusoe by his side, declared their mission to find the prisoners peacefully. If not found, they would offer gifts as an apology. However, any hostile move would be met with gunfire, a warning well understood by the Peigans. Crusoe, the dog, sniffed out a hidden spot in the dark woods, where Joe Blunt and Henri were found bound but alive, much to everyone's relief.

Here, he tried to stand but couldn't, falling back, which deeply affected him. He cried, then burst into laughter. Suddenly, he stopped, sat up, and looked at Dick. Dick woke him up, a bit roughly. Joe, now awake, complained of feeling like he was walking on pins. They got ready to go back to the Peigan camp. Joe suggested getting even with the others. Henri, in high spirits, suggested attacking them all at once. The trappers were amused. They decided to leave the Indians unharmed. Cameron, armed with rifles, felt confident.

Joe Blunt shared half of his goods with the Indians, who were surprised by his generosity. This act led to mutual respect and goodwill between the two groups. The Indians returned to the forest, while Joe and his companions rode back to their camp among the hills. Shortly after, Dick, Joe, Henri, and Crusoe decided to join Walter Cameron's trappers. Joe's mission aligned with the traders' goal of promoting peace among Indian tribes in the west. Dick wanted to explore the Rocky Mountains and hunt big-horned sheep. Henri joined for the adventure and because his friends did. The group set off, and Dick successfully shot a big-horned sheep. They then embarked on a fur-trading expedition, trapping beavers in the wild. Beaver skins were valuable, traded with the Indians for small items. The traders risked their lives to trade in these remote regions. Today, trade practices have evolved, ensuring fairer exchanges.|"[""1.

In a land where snow had melted away, trappers wandered through a beautiful country with sloping ridges dividing luxuriant vales of woodland and prairie. Rivers and streams flowed through, enriching the land, while lakes teeming with fish and prized beavers dotted the landscape. Salt and hot springs abounded, some hot enough to boil meat. Natural bridges spanned rivers, saving the trappers from dangerous fords. The land was alive with wildlife - red-deer grazed, beavers nibbled on trees, and otters played in the waters. Wild horses thundered across plains, elks trotted away swiftly, and bears roamed freely. Despite the natural beauty, the trappers had to remain vigilant due to the presence of savage tribes.|['1.

Civilization alone cannot improve the heart, as history shows that even in so-called civilized lands, dark deeds have been committed. Civilization is like a polish that can be washed away, while Christianity is like a dye that permeates every fiber. The success of trappers in catching beavers was remarkable, with a hundred and fifty caught at once. They marched in groups, with hunters leading the way and women, children, and pack-horses following. Joe Blunt was the most successful hunter, Henri enjoyed the company, and Dick was a skilled and agile hunter. They set traps near rivers where beavers were found, always returning to camp at night. Each trapper had ten traps and set them near trees cut by beavers. Beavers are similar to large water rats with broad, flat tails and powerful teeth. Their fur is dense and greyish, with a chestnut-colored coat of long coarse hair.|['1.

When a tree falls, beavers get to work cutting it into pieces based on weight and thickness. They drag the wood to the water, float it to their spot, and build their lodges under riverbanks. Beavers ensure the water is deep enough to prevent freezing to the bottom. If needed, they dam up shallow waters. These clever creatures construct strong dams and lodges of sticks, mud, and stones that freeze solid in winter. Wolverines, their foes, struggle to break in. Trappers set traps underwater to catch beavers. After skinning them, the beavers are used for food. Unfortunately, trappers face dangers too, like thefts and attacks.

Dick, a bold and adventurous young man, set off on a solo ride ahead of his companions, leaving behind his sulky comrade Pierre. As he rode, he stumbled upon a fierce battle between a wild turkey-cock and a white-headed eagle. Despite the eagerness of his loyal dog Crusoe to join the fight, Dick intervened, realizing the turkey-cock was blind. Just as he was about to step in, an arrow whizzed past him, and Crusoe saved an Indian from being attacked. Dick quickly secured the Indian, using a piece of leather to tie his hands and a noose around his neck, ensuring he couldn't escape.

The trappers camped on a grassy plain that night. Pierre decided to let the horses loose to graze, against Dick's advice. Suddenly, four Indians on horseback appeared, driving the other horses away. The men chased after them, but Dick encountered an Indian hiding in the grass. The Banattees were known for their deceitful tactics. The trappers, exhausted and disheartened, regrouped and headed back to camp. Unfortunately, wolves attacked their horses, leading the trader to set traps for them.

The Native Americans swiftly skinned the animal, a process taking about five minutes. They then cut the meat and prepared a pack, including extracting the tongue. To break the skull and remove the brains, they used a buffalo leg as a hammer. Although an axe would have been useful, they improvised in the rush of the moment. The entire operation of skinning, cutting, and packing the meat took around twenty minutes. Before leaving, they enjoyed some of the raw marrow and liver. Joe shared a story about a peculiar naturalist he once met, who collected insects. Despite his odd habits, the naturalist engaged Joe and another hunter for a trip, during which they convinced him to try horse meat. The naturalist's adventures with his revolver, including shooting a bee and accidentally hitting his comrade, added to his eccentricity.|['1.

In the wild frontier, Joe and Martin faced a buffalo stampede. Joe, out of bullets, grabbed the Natter-list's pistol, unknowingly loaded with insects and shot the buffalo. Martin swiftly ended its suffering. The Natter-list, disoriented, mistook his revolver for a container. Starving, Joe suggested slaughtering his horse, but the Natter-list refused. Martin later killed a wild horse, providing much-needed sustenance. The Natter-list, unable to discern meat, unknowingly dined on horseflesh. Subsequently, they encountered buffalo, ensuring their survival. As they parted ways, Joe revealed the horseflesh meal to the Natter-list. Soon after, a band of mounted Indians approached their camp, causing panic. Cameron and his men prepared to defend the camp, capturing the Indians and their stolen horses.

Cameron quickly gathered a group to search for Pierre and his friends, becoming deeply concerned about their well-being. Within thirty minutes, he dispatched as many men as he could safely spare towards the Blue Mountains. While some may consider this a trivial detail, having a confirmed fact in a world of uncertainties is a comfort worth acknowledging. As the pursuit of a horse in general led to the specific chase of Dick Varley's horse, the noble steed, ridden hard by savages, dashed off upon being chased, leaving his pursuers behind. However, the horse's flight was abruptly halted as he unwittingly entered a gorge, cornered by Henri and Joe. Amidst the chase, an impending avalanche caught their attention, prompting a warning cry from Joe. Henri narrowly escaped the avalanche, but Charlie was buried beneath the snowy mass. A grizzly bear, unnoticed until then, began digging into the snow heap, likely aiming for the horse's remains. As the hunters returned to camp, they found Pierre and his companions returning disheartened, only to be surprised by the unexpected return of their horses. The joy was short-lived as Joe arrived with news of Charlie's entombment, causing distress among the group.|"['1.

A group of men rushed to rescue Charlie, who was trapped in a hole dug by Bruin the bear. Despite the comical sight of Bruin's tail sticking out of the hole, the men prepared to fire. Crusoe, the dog, took charge and led the assault by grabbing Bruin's flank. The men worked tirelessly to dig out Charlie, with Dick Varley and Henri showing exceptional effort. Eventually, they found Charlie safe beside the cliff due to the overhang that protected him during the avalanche. As trapping continued successfully, the men prepared for a hunting expedition with new supplies. Suddenly, a tribe of Indians arrived, signaling a significant change in the valley's dynamics and prompting the friends to consider their next steps.|"['1.

In front of Dick, towering cliffs rose high above him against the clear sky. As he watched the rocks and caves, a distant sound caught his attention. It grew into a roar mixed with men's cries. Suddenly, the cliffs came alive with Indians and buffaloes rushing about in frenzy. The buffaloes were driven to the edge and plunged over, some falling to their deaths. Dick was horrified by the cruel spectacle. The Indians spotted him and gave chase. Dick quickly mounted his horse, Charlie, and fled towards the camp as the savages pursued him.|"[""1.

Dick, a young trapper, swiftly rode through the valley on his horse Charlie to warn the camp of an impending attack by a large group of hostile Indians. With Joe Blunt joining him, they raced back to the camp where Cameron had prepared defenses. As the Indians arrived, tensions rose, but Cameron proposed a peaceful council. After a series of polite but tense exchanges, gifts were offered, and a trade agreement was reached. The next day, the Indians set up camp nearby, revealing the vastness of their numbers. Cameron, aware of the potential threat, fortified the camp. The Indians were divided into three tribes: the Shirry-dikas, the War-are-ree-kas, and the Banattees, each with distinct characteristics and ways of life.|"[""1.

A group of men gathered in front of the fur-traders' camp, drawn by the news of Cameron's presence, attracting crowds of natives. Intense discussions ensued, aiming for peace. Pee-eye-em, a chief, warned of the Banattees' treachery. The second chief doubted peace with the Peigans and Blackfeet. Joe Blunt offered to trade with the Red-men for furs. Cameron gifted the chiefs and council members. Joe, Henri, and Dick were tasked with negotiating peace. As they discussed, a thundering sound approached—the wild horses stampeding towards the camp.

A massive herd of wild horses stampeded through the Indian camp, causing chaos and excitement. Henri and Dick watched in awe as the thundering hooves and howling dogs created a frenzy. The horses, terrified by the approaching herd, broke free and ran wildly. Amidst the commotion, a cloud obscured the moon, adding to the confusion. Dick's horse, Charlie, broke loose and joined the wild horses, guided by Crusoe, a loyal dog. The two friends were eventually reunited after Crusoe helped Charlie break free from the entangled line. Dick secured Charlie and joined a council meeting to discuss plans. The next day, the camp celebrated an abundant buffalo hunt, with feasting and gratitude for the plentiful food supply.|['1.

The arrival of the hunters was a lucky event that improved the mood of the Indians, leading to friendly interactions with the trappers. The trappers took advantage of the surplus furs the Indians had and engaged in a lively fur trade. With ample supplies and provisions, the trappers paused their trapping activities to focus on trading. Joe shared his plans to head to Mustang Valley with Henri and Dick, suggesting they could settle down as farmers. However, Dick preferred the hunter's life. The group prepared to depart the next day, carrying furs, goods for trading, and supplies for the journey.

Dick's thoughts wandered back to his **home**, a place he dearly missed during his first long hunting expedition. Despite his attempts to focus on the chase, his longing for home grew stronger. Eventually, Dick confided in Joe Blunt about his homesickness, finding relief in sharing his feelings. Joe, a seasoned hunter, shared his own experience with homesickness, highlighting the importance of returning home to cure such feelings. As they journeyed back, Dick's spirits lifted, especially when they reached the beautiful prairies. The group encountered a band of Blackfeet Indians, but through Joe's diplomatic efforts, they peacefully parted ways.

Several bands were friendly, except for one war-party. Joe noticed them in time, and they hid behind trees. A Blackfeet war-party was spotted on the horizon. The prairie lacked cover, so Joe led them down to hide in a hollow. The Indians discovered them, and Joe instructed the others to unload and create a barrier of packs. Joe approached the Indians alone to parley. When the chief's horse was shot, the Indians were startled. A second shot and an explosion scared them away. In the chaos, Henri's powder horn mishap singed his hair. The trio escaped another band of Indians by hiding in a hollow. They faced danger after danger, leaping from one peril to another.|"['1.

Henri, Joe, and Dick rode swiftly on their steeds, seeking refuge under the willows to evade the savages. A mysterious howl from Crusoe led them to a gruesome discovery of trappers brutally slain in their sleep. The hunters, filled with dread, realized the danger lurking in the wilderness. Despite the urge for revenge, their small group had to press on. The Camanchees, cunning and swift, trailed them, ready for an ambush.

The Indians had cleverly approached within shooting distance before the hunters noticed, forcing them to gallop their horses at top speed to escape. One Indian, on a swift horse, closed in with an arrow ready, but Henri, alert, aimed his rifle. The Indian hid behind his horse, and the arrow missed.

Communication through body language is a fascinating thing. Every little movement of Crusoe, the dog, spoke volumes without a single word.
