The bustling city streets greeted them with noise and newsboys selling papers. Inside the hotel, they met Mr. Garley, who expressed sympathy for their situation.

In the morning, around ten o'clock, Mr. Rover seemed worried and left the hotel in a hurry. He carried a package that looked like legal documents, and he talked to himself. He disappeared down Broadway, leaving his belongings behind. His notebook showed signs of worry, and he had few acquaintances in the city. The boys found letters and documents in his bag related to the Sunset Irrigation Company. They suspected he came to see Pelter, Japson & Company, possibly concerning stock transfers.

For a full hour, the boys discussed the situation until Sam was barely able to keep his eyes open from sleepiness. Eventually, they all retired to their rooms. Dick stayed in his father's old room, while Sam and Tom took the next one. Dick couldn't shake off thoughts about his missing father. Worried, he wondered if his father was hurt, killed, or held captive. The idea of never hearing from his father again terrified him. Suddenly, a figure rushed past their door, prompting Dick to chase after him with Tom and Sam. Despite their efforts, the mysterious man vanished.

The man slipped away from the hotel, leaving Dick to chase him through the bustling streets. Dick saw the man jump into a taxi and speed off downtown. Determined, Dick followed in hot pursuit. The taxi driver received instructions from the man and took off, zigzagging through the city streets. They raced down Fifth Avenue, with Dick close behind. As they reached Fifty-fifth Street, a furniture van slowed down the man's taxi. This delay gave Dick a chance to catch up, but the man's taxi managed to stay ahead.

Dick suggested that Tom head to Central Park to gather information about Crabtree.

They rode a crowded car down to Wall Street, passing tall buildings until they reached their destination. Dick instructed Sam to wait outside while he went up to the brokers' offices. The offices were shabby but bustling with prosperous tenants due to the high rents on Wall Street. Dick located the brokers' office on the fourth floor. Inside, he spoke with a broker who mentioned that Mr. Rover had visited but failed to return the next day as promised.

Subsequently, Dick discovered that the second man was indeed Japson from the company. This revelation hinted at a deeper conspiracy involving Crabtree aiding the brokers against their father.

Anderson Rover held substantial interests through options, funded by himself and friends. To secure these ventures, Anderson had to sign crucial papers within three days, or risk losing control to Pelter, Japson & Company.

Three boys observed Pelter and Josiah Crabtree talking seriously for a while. Pelter gestured towards a large bundle he carried, and Crabtree nodded. They then strolled slowly to a dock extending into the Hudson River. At the dock, a rowboat awaited with a sailor-like man rowing. Pelter and Crabtree boarded the boat, which was swiftly pushed off. As the sailor rowed into the river, another rowboat reached a schooner's side, and everyone transferred onboard. The tugboat was signaled to move forward. A steamboat passing caused waves, making the rowboat with the Rover boys bob up and down. The boys rowed towards the waves, but the schooner sailed away. The boys called out, but no help arrived. Eventually, the schooner disappeared down the river, leaving the boys stranded in the rowboat. They quickly left for the nearest elevated railroad station.|['Question 1:\nWhat did Pelter gesture towards before boarding the rowboat?\nA) A large bundle\nB) A map\nC) A fishing rod\nD) A book\nE) A suitcase', 'Question 2:\nWhere did Pelter and Josiah Crabtree board the rowboat?\nA) At a park\nB) At a restaurant\nC) At a school\nD) At a dock\nE) At a museum', 'Question 3:\nWhat caused the rowboat with the Rover boys to bob up and down?\nA) A steamboat passing\nB) A strong wind\nC) A sudden storm\nD) A whale\nE) A motorboat', 'Question 4:\nHow did the boys attempt to navigate the waves caused by the passing steamboat?\nA) They rowed towards the waves\nB) They jumped into the water\nC) They called for help\nD) They waited for the waves to subside\nE) They abandoned the rowboat', 'Question 5:\nWhere did the boys go after the schooner sailed away, leaving them stranded?\nA) They stayed on the rowboat\nB) They swam to shore\nC) They boarded the schooner\nD) They called for help\nE) They left for the nearest elevated railroad station', 'Question 6:\nWhat happened to the schooner after the boys were left stranded in the rowboat?\nA) It sank\nB) It disappeared down the river\nC) It returned for the boys\nD) It collided with another boat\nE) It caught fire']|['A) A large bundle', 'D) At a dock', 'A) A steamboat passing', 'A) They rowed towards the waves', 'E) They left for the nearest elevated railroad station', 'B) It disappeared down the river']
The boys felt discouraged as they hoped the police tug would find their father's craft. Unsure of what to do next, they returned to the Battery area and resumed the search up the river. Despite their efforts, the schooner remained elusive. Dick mentioned making charges and possibly arresting individuals in the city before they moved on with the police official's advice. Concerned about their father's situation, they discussed the possibility of him being forced to sign papers. Deciding to grab a quick lunch, they sought a private tug to continue their search up the river, suspecting the Ellen Rodney had gone that way.

"""I'll come aboard,"" said Dick, and without waiting for another word from the man, he made his way to the deck, followed by Tom. He had directed Sam to stay in the motor-boat with John Slater, to call for help if needed. Dick quickly realized his father wasn't on the schooner. He searched through the cabin and staterooms, noticing signs of a struggle in one room. ""We might as well go ashore,"" said Tom. ""We are wasting valuable time here."" The boys walked through a lumber yard to an office. ""The Blue Horseshoe Tavern must be an old roadhouse,"" said Dick. As they reached the tavern, they saw a touring car approaching.

The car swerved dangerously twice, nearly hitting trees on the roadside. Despite the chaos, the driver regained control until a sudden turn sent them spinning. The car hit a rock, twisting the wheel and damaging the mudguard. After a bumpy ride, they arrived at a white house behind a high hedge with an old windmill nearby. The boys cautiously approached the house, peeking through a window to find three men inside. Convinced their father wasn't on the lower floors, they quietly investigated upstairs. Armed with a stick for protection, Dick searched the second floor until he found a small bedchamber with a cot and a closet.|['1.

Dick peered out of the window and spotted a porch roof. At the far end, another window from the main building was visible. Acting swiftly, Dick opened the window, stepped onto the porch, and reached the other window. Inside, he found an empty room with an unused bed. Crossing the room, he entered a wide hallway, hearing voices downstairs where the troublemakers were still discussing. Moving through the house, Dick discovered empty rooms until he reached a garret filled with old furniture. In a dark corner, he found his father tied up. After freeing him, they quietly made their way down to the kitchen and into the cellar. They overheard a conversation revealing a sinister plot involving Crabtree, Pelter, and Japson against the Rovers. The boys were shocked to learn about the involvement of Belright Fogg, the lawyer who had previously tried to deceive them.|"['1.

After listening to the conversation between the brokers and Josiah Crabtree, the boys learned that the plotters aimed to make a lot of money from their scheme. Tom quickly grasped the situation and sprang into action. He fetched a square table and strategically blocked the door to prevent Crabtree from escaping. Using books as wedges, they secured the table in place. Suddenly, the blanket-rope snapped, causing Crabtree to fall from the window. Tom rushed to his aid, carrying him inside and tending to his injuries. Meanwhile, Pelter and Japson attempted to flee using a stronger rope. In the chaos, Pelter threw a footstool at Tom, knocking him unconscious. The plotters escaped, leaving Tom's brother, Dick, to find him injured on the ground.|['1.

Dick was extremely worried. He rushed his brother to the dining room and made him comfortable on some chairs with a blanket for a pillow. He cleaned Tom's head and tried to bandage it. Tom briefly opened his eyes but didn't speak. It took a long time to get an ambulance. Tom remained unconscious, and Dick was filled with fear. He wondered if his lively brother might die from his injuries. A doctor had treated Josiah Crabtree's broken leg and arranged for him to go to the hospital after Tom. Dick called Sam at the Outlook Hotel in New York to update him. He asked Sam to have the police watch Pelter, Japson & Company's offices and look out for Belright Fogg. Later, Dick contacted Sam again, and they both anxiously waited for news on Tom's condition.|"['1.

Dick quickly contacted Mr. Frank A. A. Powell, a lawyer well-connected in town, to seek help regarding the shady dealings of Pelter, Japson & Company. Mr. Powell agreed to meet the Rovers and advised taking strict action against the swindlers. Meanwhile, the police were monitoring the situation closely, with no sign of Pelter or Japson. Dick shared the incident of Tom's assault and the ongoing efforts to resolve the business mess. Mr. Powell arranged to discuss Anderson Rover's land deal in Brooklyn and asked Dick to meet him there.

There was a commotion in the streets due to a small fire nearby. Dick paused to observe a fire engine in action, and someone tapped him on the shoulder. Dan Baxter, an old acquaintance of the Rover boys, used to be a bully at Putnam Hall. However, after being helped by the Rovers when he was penniless, he became their friend. Dan mentioned seeing Japson and two others entering an apartment near Prospect Park. He offered to assist Dick without hesitation. They headed to the fourth floor and listened at a door where they overheard a conversation between Pelter, Japson, Fogg, and a former railroad lawyer. The men discussed Crabtree's silence and the need to keep him from revealing anything. Japson suggested leaving the country until the situation calmed down, regretting missing an opportunity to acquire land and stocks due to Rover's escape.|"['1.

After the incident, Jesse Pelter discussed his plans to pursue the business interests of the Rovers. He believed there was potential to untangle and benefit from the affairs left during Mr. Rover's sickness. Meanwhile, in the apartment, strategies were devised for Belright Fogg to assist Pelter and Japson while they hid in Canada. The lawyer was to use a power of attorney to act on behalf of the brokers and help establish an alibi for them. Dick overheard these deceitful plans, including their attempt to escape and shift blame. With the help of Dan Baxter, a plan was devised to catch the culprits red-handed. Despite protests, the scheming brokers were eventually apprehended by the authorities. They threatened retribution, claiming innocence, but their true intentions were exposed.|"[""1.

Several tenants in the building were worried by the situation, including Baxter's fiancée and her mother. Dan explained the events and introduced Dick, who praised Baxter's actions. The police wagon arrived, and everyone descended. The ride was short, and upon arrival, Dick briefed the authorities and requested communication between Brooklyn and New York. Pelter, Japson, and Fogg were detained for further investigation. Dick updated Mr. Powell and arranged transportation to his original destination.
