In a village by the river, a barrel sank, seemingly lost with money inside. A Russian kitchen-maid saw it floating and tried to grab it, but it eluded her.

Once upon a time, there was a skilled demon who learned the art of blacksmithing so well that he surpassed his master's abilities. The demon's master was extremely pleased with his work and trusted him completely to manage the smithy. One day, when the master was away, the demon saw an old lady passing by in a carriage. The demon, seeking to make her young and beautiful, poured milk and bones into a tub. To his surprise, the old lady emerged from the milk transformed into a youthful beauty. She demanded that the demon make himself young as well if he wanted her acknowledgment. In a panic, the demon sought the help of his master, who, unaware of the situation, attempted to replicate the transformation but failed.

In European folklore, evil spirits like demons or devils are believed to possess the bodies of the deceased, possibly to return as vampires. This concept is similar to a tale from South Africa where a lion takes on the skin of a girl it has slain. Russian peasants have a belief that those who drink themselves to death become wood and water carriers in the afterlife. Stories like these often involve disputes between husbands and wives, such as arguments over harvesting fields. In one tale, a wife falls into a pool while gesturing to her husband about clipping a meadow. These stories are found in various cultures, with different twists and endings, sometimes involving priests or clergy members.|"['1.

The sisters, being enchantresses, transformed their palaces into eggs and taught the Prince to convert them back. They handed the eggs to him, and together they journeyed to the upper world. When they reached the rope to ascend, the Prince fastened his sisters to it, but his jealous brothers planned to harm him. Sensing their treachery, the Prince tied the rope to a stone, fooling his brothers. As they cut the rope, the stone fell, and the Prince wept as he departed. He wandered until a storm hit, and he sheltered under a tree, protecting drenched young birds. The mother bird, grateful, offered him a wish. He asked for a container with food and water, and the bird flew him to his destination. Disguised as a servant, the Prince learned of the challenge to replicate otherworldly wedding attire without measurements, a task no craftsman dared attempt.|['1.

In oriental tales, there are stories of demon-infested waters that bring doom to those who come in contact with them. For instance, in an Indian legend, a king unknowingly sends his followers to bathe in a lake inhabited by a man-eating demon. As they plunge into the water, they are all devoured by the dreadful creature. However, in another tale, Buddha, in his earlier form as a monkey, cleverly saves himself and his monkey brethren from a similar demon by having them drink from a tank using hollow reeds. These malevolent beings are akin to evil enchantresses in female form, such as the Baba Yaga, a tall, eerie hag with magical powers, who dwells in a hut supported by fowl's legs and rides in a mortar while sweeping away her tracks with a broom.

In ancient stories, magical transformations were common. For instance, in Sanskrit tales, a handful of earth could become a mountain, or a cup of water could turn into a river. The use of everyday objects in these transformations was symbolic. A brush could represent a miniature wood, and a comb might resemble a serrated mountain range. In a story about Baba Yaga, a group of heroes encounters a spinning hut in a dense forest. They use magic to make the hut face them and enter to find it empty. When one hero stays behind and combs his hair, Baba Yaga appears, beats him, and steals their food. Each hero faces the same fate until Ivan bravely defeats Baba Yaga, rescues his friends, and outsmarts her.

Vasilissa gazed at her stepmother's dark house, devoid of any light. Bravely, she decided to bring the skull inside. Surprisingly, her stepmother and stepsisters warmly welcomed her, admitting they had been without fire since Vasilissa left. Struggling to keep a flame lit, they hoped Vasilissa's light would endure. As they brought the skull into the room, its eyes blazed at them, causing fear. The eyes relentlessly followed them, scorching them to ashes by morning, except Vasilissa, who remained unharmed. The next day, she buried the skull and moved to a nearby town. With the help of her doll, she weaved fine linen, impressing the king.

"The origin of eerie tales about forbidden relationships, like incest, likely stems from ancient myths. One such myth is found in the Rigveda, where Yama rejects his sister Yami's proposal, citing societal taboos against siblings marrying. The name ""Vyed'ma"" traces back to a Slavonic root akin to the Sanskrit word for knowledge, linking her to the concept of witches. In Ceylon, demons are depicted as offspring of human parents but possessing supernatural qualities. In Albanian folklore, the ""Sisters of the Sun"" assist a woman in need. Similarly, the figure of Likho embodies malevolence, as seen in a tale where a smith seeks out evil and encounters a sinister female form in a dark forest."|"['1.

"Moving from the various forms of popular fiction that embody ideas related to Fortune and Misfortune, let's explore the intriguing personifications of certain days of the week. Among these, Friday stands out as the most significant. While the Russian name for Friday, _Pyatnitsa_, lacks the mythological depth of our own Friday and the French _Vendredi_, it was once revered by the old Slavonians in honor of a goddess akin to Venus or Freyja. This ancient worship explains the superstitions linked to Friday. In Christian times, the goddess associated with Friday merged into St. Prascovia, often referred to as ""Mother Pyatnitsa-Prascovia."" It was believed that she roamed on Fridays and disliked certain activities, leading peasants to suspend them. For instance, sewing, spinning, or weaving on a Friday was considered a sin, as it could anger ""Mother Friday"" and bring about afflictions like sore-eyes or whitlows. The villagers took precautions like going to bed early on Fridays or sweeping their floors to appease her. Disregarding Mother Friday's honor was said to bring misfortune, as seen in the tale of a woman who spun flax on a Friday and faced the consequences. Similarly, Wednesday, connected to Odin, was considered sacred, with tales warning against dishonoring the day. These stories serve as cautionary reminders of the superstitions surrounding certain days of the week."|"['1. What is the main idea of the text passage?\nA.

In a Russian legend, St. Petka and St. Nedélya, akin to St. Anastasia and _Der heilige Sonntag_ of German folklore, are revered.

"The upcoming section will feature vampire stories that share similarities with tales of murderous undead creatures. However, most of these stories are categorized differently due to unique myths or superstitions. Vampires are driven by an unquenchable thirst for blood, motivating them to rise from their graves and wreak havoc. On the other hand, the animated corpses emerging at midnight, seeking to harm those around them, are believed to be possessed by demons. According to folklore, the bodies of deceased witches can be inhabited by devils, leading to horrifying actions akin to those attributed to evil spirits in Indian folklore. For instance, in the story of Nischayadatta from the ""Kathásaritságara,"" a group of pilgrims faces a female demon at a deserted temple. The demon transforms men into beasts through spells and consumes them. The hero outwits the demon by using her own flute and spell against her, rendering her powerless and gaining her assistance."|['1.

The Russian peasants hold various beliefs about where the spirit goes after death. Some think it stays with the body in the coffin, while others believe it lingers in the home or travels on the wind. They leave food and money with the deceased, indicating an old belief in the soul's journey after death. Feasts in memory of the dead hint at a belief in their continued presence at the burial site. These beliefs sometimes clash, showing attempts to merge them with Christian ideas. Folktales mention a land beyond the sky inhabited by magical beings.

"The ""Rip van Winkle"" tale needs only a brief mention. It likely originated from folk stories akin to the Christian legend of ""The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus,"" which in turn echoes an older tale. A Russian version of a monk enchanted by a bird in a garden is found in Chudinsky's collection. The Russian story ""The Two Friends"" closely resembles the Norse ""Friends in Life and Death."" In the Norse tale, a man is visited by his dead friend who guides him to the afterlife. The living man returns covered in moss and shrubs. Moving from these gentle depictions of the afterlife to more chilling portrayals, the dead in Skazkas are depicted as vitalized corpses with superhuman strength and malice.

"The tales in this class are plentiful, all stemming from the belief that the deceased, in physical form, rise from their graves to harm and feed on the living. This belief is not unique to the Slavonians but is a defining aspect of their spiritual faith. Among those who cremate their dead, little is known about typical ""corpse-spectres."" Only vague apparitions are thought to emerge from graves holding mere ashes. However, in regions where bodies are buried, a sort of ""half-life"" is attributed to them by folklore, with some cultures believing in periodic murderous impulses.

Russian folk stories provide detailed accounts of how vampires operate. In one tale, a stranger leads a peasant to a house where two sleepers lay, an old man and a youth. The stranger strikes the youth's back, causing rosy blood to flow into a pail, which he drinks. He then does the same to the old man. To stop a vampire's power, a stake must be driven through the corpse, with aspen or thorn stakes being common choices. Fire or decapitation with a grave-digger's shovel are also known methods of destroying vampires. The origin of vampires is mysterious, with some becoming vampires by accident or through cursed lineage. Folklore warns against striking vampires more than once, as a single blow must suffice to prevent their return to life.|"[""1.

Hanush suggests that the Old Slavonians, who cremated their dead, likely adopted the vampire belief from another group. However, it's uncertain if all heathen Slavonians practiced cremation. Kotlyarevsky's research on their burial customs indicates that some Slavonians buried without burning, while others cremated their dead before burying the ashes. The connection between vampires and werewolves is noted through the Greek word for vampire, which has Slavonic origins. The Regular name for a vampire in Servian further supports its Slavonian roots. Various names for vampires exist in different regions, such as καταχανᾶς in Crete and Rhodes. The belief in vampires driving stakes through corpses persists among Slavonian peasants, contrasting with modern laws. In comparison, a Scottish superstition requires killing animals that pass over a corpse.|"['1.

Russian folklore includes stories about the creation of man and the origins of certain traditions. According to the Schismatics, man was made of earthly materials but received the breath of life from God. Legends also explain the origins of hills, saying they were formed when the Devil filled his mouth with soil and then coughed it out, creating the landscape. Some Russian tales involve animals, like crayfish believed to be created by the Devil and the snake that saved Noah's family by stopping a leak in the Ark. Additionally, the horse is considered unclean because it ate the hay under which the infant Saviour was hidden, unlike the ox that protected the hay. These stories reflect cultural beliefs and values passed down through generations.|"['1.

Many graceful legends are connected with birds. One bird, possibly the peewit, is always on the wing during dry weather, crying _Peet, Peet_, as if begging for water. Legend has it that when God created the earth and commanded birds to bring water to seas, lakes, and rivers, this bird refused, claiming it didn't need water. Enraged, God cursed it, forbidding it and its descendants from approaching water, only allowing them to drink rainwater collected in hollows. In another tale, sparrows were cursed for leading people to Christ's hiding place, while swallows helped during the crucifixion. Russian legends also speak of Christ and his Apostles visiting homes in disguise, teaching the importance of hospitality. These tales, common in Christian lands, reflect old beliefs and traditions.|"['1.

In Slavonian tradition, the Prophet Elijah and St. Nicholas are depicted with contrasting attributes. St. Nicholas, akin to an ancient ruler of waters, is seen as mild, while Elijah, the thunder-god's successor, is more formidable. Just as Elijah resembles Thor, Nicholas has similarities to Odin. A story illustrates their differences: a Moujik honored St. Nicholas but neglected Elijah. When both walked over the Moujik's land, Nicholas praised the crops and the Moujik's piety, while Elijah predicted destruction. A storm hit, destroying the crops. However, the land miraculously recovered, yielding a bountiful harvest. Elijah then limited the Moujik's profits, showing the consequences of neglecting him.|"[""1.

"The Peasant and the Prophets

Once upon a time, a peasant, known as the Moujik, was blessed with a bountiful harvest after his crops were ruined by hail. Grateful for the abundance, he decided to offer wax tapers to Prophet Elijah and St. Nicholas. As he carried two tapers, he met the Prophets disguised as travelers. The Moujik planned to offer the big rouble taper to Prophet Elijah, acknowledging his generosity. Upon hearing this, Elijah was pleased and no longer threatened the Moujik. From then on, the Moujik led a prosperous life, honoring both Elijah's Day and Nicholas's Day. Legends also tell of St. George, celebrated as a protector and a chivalrous figure.

In a Bulgarian legend, St. George is portrayed as a dragon-slayer in a pagan city called Troyan. The city worshipped gold and silver instead of Christ. The city's water conduits began to flow with liquid gold and silver, leaving the people thirsty. To quench their thirst, the city had to sacrifice a maiden daily to a monster guarding a lake. When the king's daughter was chosen as the sacrifice, a figure resembling St. George, named Perseus, appeared. The princess wept, and her tears woke him from a deep slumber. St. George defeated the monster and converted the city to Christianity. St. George is also known for his kindness in helping the unfortunate, as seen in a story where a peasant's cart gets stuck in the mud, and St. Kasian refuses to help, but St. Nicholas comes to the peasant's aid promptly.|"['1.

In one tale, the Lord rewards Kasian and Nicholas differently for their actions. Kasian did not help a man in need, so people honor him with thanksgiving every four years. Nicholas, who assisted a man in freeing his cart, receives thanksgiving twice a year. Another story tells of Nicholas aiding an adventurer by disenchanting a princess. The merchant, guided by an old man, succeeds in the task and is rewarded with half the kingdom. In a final legend, a Pope serves Nicholas until he has nothing left. He then meets a mysterious man, and they share magical loaves that never diminish. The Pope, envious, tries to steal the loaves but fails.

Two travelers embarked on a journey and came to a kingdom where the King's daughter was gravely ill. The King promised half his kingdom to anyone who could cure her, but failure meant losing their head. Claiming to be doctors, they requested a private room, a tub of water, a sharp sword, and a big table. They cut the Princess into pieces, washed them, and reassembled her with the old man's magical breath, reviving her. In another land, the envious Pope attempted the same but failed, risking his life.

The tales of outsmarting evil spirits lack variety in their plots. Different stories from various cultures may have different characters and settings, but the methods used to deceive the spirits remain the same. For instance, a German story features a schoolmaster tricking the devil, while a Slavonic tale involves a gypsy outwitting a snake. In Russian stories, mortals often trick devils by using clever tactics like passing off cheese as a stone or challenging demons to competitions. In one tale from the Tambof Government, Zachary the Unlucky cleverly avoids falling asleep while working for a wolf-fiend, ultimately obtaining a fiddle as a reward. These stories sometimes showcase demons showing gratitude, like the devil in the story of the Awful Drunkard. Another tale features a boy named Vanka who helps a demon with turnips and receives a magical lute in return. One intriguing story tells of a man who unknowingly blesses the devil, leading to the origin of brandy in a folklore tradition.|['1.
