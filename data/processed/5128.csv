When I was a young student, we often sympathized with the Carthaginians over the Romans at my school. We felt this way perhaps because we tend to support the underdog. However, we didn't know much about the conflict since our textbooks didn't cover the Punic wars. Hannibal, a skilled general, won battles against the Romans, nearly capturing Rome. The Romans, in turn, showed cruelty when they captured Carthage. While we may admire Hannibal, it was ultimately beneficial for Rome to emerge victorious. Carthage was corrupt, and Rome, despite conquering, aimed to civilize rather than enslave. The soldiers in the story are depicted resting in the afternoon heat, showing signs of fatigue from the scorching day. The soldiers belong to different groups, with the Numidian horsemen being described as lithe and agile, accustomed to the sun, armed lightly with shields, bows, and javelins, wearing colorful clothing and leather belts.|"[""1.

Near them are a group of men lighter in color, taller and stronger. Their clothing is more irregular, with bare arms and shirts open at the neck and reaching the knees, held by a leather strap at the waist. Their flannel shirts, once deep purple, now faded to lilac from the sun, mark them as Iberian slingers from conquered Spanish tribes. They lie near heavy swords for close combat. Heavily armed men with helmets and shields are the Carthaginian heavy infantry. Greeks, Nubians, and others from Sardinia, Egypt, and more are among them.

The recent defeats by the Roman navy had fueled the nobles' military zeal. From childhood, noble sons were trained in warfare, enduring hardships and learning combat skills early on. Malchus, son of Hamilcar, was rigorously trained in arms since a young age. His father instilled endurance by exposing him to harsh conditions in Spain, teaching him to withstand cold, hunger, and pain. The nobles believed in setting an example of strength, wisdom, and courage to lead and command respect. With Carthage facing Rome's growing power, the nobles emphasized the need for Carthaginians to be prepared for the impending conflict.

"""I believe that you are just as eager as I am, Adherbal,"" the boy replied laughing. ""It's your first lion hunt as well as mine, and I am sure you are longing to see whether the assault of the king of beasts is more trying to the nerves than that of the Iberian tribesmen.""

""I am looking forward to it, Malchus, certainly,"" the young man replied; ""but as I know the lions will not quit their coverts until after nightfall, and as no efforts on my part will hasten the approach of that hour, I am well content to lie quiet and to keep myself as cool as may be.""

""Your cousin is right,"" the general said, ""and impatience is a fault, Malchus. We must make allowances for your impatience on the present occasion, for the lion is a foe not to be despised, and he is truly as formidable an antagonist when brought to bay as the Iberians on the banks of the Ebro--far more so than the revolted tribesmen we have been hunting for the past three weeks.""

The leadership structure in Carthage was flawed and led to its downfall. Initially, the government had three estates representing the king, lords, and commons. However, power shifted to a secretive council of thirty members who controlled all aspects of society. The judges were corrupt and easily influenced by the council, resulting in a mockery of justice. The state's resources were misused for personal gain rather than the country's welfare. Carthage's focus on wealth over military strength allowed Rome to surpass them. Malchus, torn between his father's wisdom and his cousin's ambition, witnessed the consequences of Carthage's mismanagement. An expedition led by Hamilcar to punish a tribe in Ethiopia faced challenges, including lions approaching the camp at night. In response, a hunt was organized under the moonlight to protect the soldiers and their horses.|"[""1.

The Numidian horse were stationed on the plain, while the infantry split into two columns, a mile apart, to enter the mountains. They left detachments behind as they moved along the hills' crest to meet and form a semicircle. Lighting torches prepared during the day, they advanced towards the plain, shouting and clashing their arms to drive all the wild animals enclosed in the arc down into the plain. The general, two young officers, his son, and fifty spearmen were divided between the two groves opposite the center, facing the line enclosed by the beaters, with Numidian horse stationed behind the groves to chase any escaping animals.

In the moonlit night, Malchus watched as a group of lions slowly approached. The leader, a massive beast, led the way with a majestic stride. As they neared, a hidden group of soldiers sprang into action, firing a volley of arrows. Enraged, the lion charged, but the soldiers stood firm, spears at the ready. A fierce battle ensued, with the lion striking down a soldier before meeting its end from a well-aimed arrow. The remaining lions were startled by fiery brands thrown by the soldiers and fled.

The infantry and Iberians cleared the grove of enemies, meeting in the center after sweeping right and left. Exhausted, they regrouped outside under the moonlight, casualties heavy. Bodies littered the plain, victims of Numidian horse and elephants. No further attacks expected, Hamilcar ordered rest. Survivors bound wounds, helped comrades. Any living foes were slain. A group looted Hamilcar's camp, but most goods were found discarded. Over half Carthaginian troops and 400 natives fell. Hamilcar offered lenient terms; hostages and ransom were handed over. Returning to Carthage, the landscape transformed, showcasing Carthaginian agricultural prowess. Villages, villas, and orchards displayed opulence and taste. Fountains, statues, and lush vegetation adorned the surroundings, a testament to Carthaginian wealth and sophistication.

Around the top of the rock was another thick wall. Above it stood the temple and other public buildings in a charming design. Below this natural fortress was the lower town, packed with people, houses, temples, and a forum. The city had a unique architectural style. Carthaginians disliked straight lines, so all buildings had curves. Rooms were mostly circular, semicircular, or oval, with rounded angles. They used an artificial stone made of rock pieces, sand, and lime. Houses had domes or cupolas. The city's towers were round, avoiding sharp angles. This was Carthage's maritime area, with docks for trade and ship construction. Megara, an upscale suburb, had mansions surrounded by greenery and white houses. The city was enclosed by a wall, covering a vast area with a population of over 800,000. Hamilcar feared that as nations grew wealthy, they lost virtues like patriotism, leading to corruption and ruin. Carthage was divided between factions led by Hamilcar's allies and Hanno the Rich, who used wealth and corruption to gain power.|"[""1.

Hamilcar Barca founded a powerful party, but his absence led his son-in-law Hasdrubal to lead in Carthage. Hasdrubal's energy and eloquence made him popular. The Barcine party faced challenges from the council and judges, supported by Hanno's wealth. Hamilcar's conquests in Spain had boosted patriotism. Hasdrubal succeeded Hamilcar after his death, winning battles and strengthening Carthagena. The death of Hasdrubal was a blow, but the people elected Hannibal to lead in Spain.

The issue at hand is whether Hannibal should remain at the helm of Carthage's army in Spain or return home to leverage his popularity and reputation to influence the populace. The decision has been made to retain Hannibal in his command. The strategy now is to rouse the people to support Hannibal. A small majority in the council favors Hannibal, but the middle class, crucial for votes, sides with Hanno. Giscon and Adherbal are tasked with rallying soldiers by reminding them of Hannibal's past triumphs and the fear Hanno has of his success overshadowing theirs. Stryphex is to sway weavers by highlighting the economic prosperity brought by Spanish conquests and warning of potential losses under Hanno's leadership. The goal is to incite public support for Hannibal and sway the middle class to secure his position.|"['1.

Malchus, a young noble, was tasked with a crucial mission to save Carthage's trade. He rushed to the busy port area, where he met a fisherman eager to have him on a fishing trip. However, Malchus had urgent matters to discuss. He explained how Hanno's opposition to Hannibal's command in Spain could jeopardize their trade. The fisherman initially seemed indifferent until Malchus highlighted the potential consequences: loss of Spanish trade, economic hardship for fishermen, and Roman threats to Carthage. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the fisherman rallied his fellow workers to support Hannibal's appointment.

Malchus expressed his desire for the fishermen to spread the word about the harmful proposal affecting their trade. He urged them to rally support against the tax gatherers and back Hannibal for general. The fishermen, facing heavy taxes, readily agreed to join the cause. Malchus promised generous rewards for their efforts. He then sought influential sailors and stevedores to garner further support. Malchus successfully enlisted their aid with promises of payment. As the agitation grew, the Barcine Club emerged as a key player in mobilizing the working class against Hanno's faction. The city buzzed with activity as both sides campaigned vigorously. The Barcine Club orchestrated a strategic plan, engaging various sectors of society to champion Hannibal's cause.

In ancient Carthage, soldiers wore distinctive gold bands on their wrists for each campaign. Their gear was lavish and varied, with helmets and shields of gold or silver adorned with plumes, and belts studded with gems. The infantry, from less noble families, wore red tunics and carried large shields made from the hide of river horses. These soldiers wielded short swords and fought barefoot. Carthage relied heavily on mercenaries, showing weakness in their defense strategy. In contrast, Rome valued martial virtues, with every citizen a soldier. The news of a campaign in Spain delighted Malchus but worried Thyra, betrothed to Adherbal, who was to accompany the troops. Despite concerns about the harsh winters in Iberia, Adherbal promised Thyra the comforts of Carthage while he was away.|"['1.

Malchus, however, disagreed with the violent methods proposed and withdrew from the scheme. He expressed his belief that the gods would not approve of such bloodshed.

The fleet sailed close to the shore, stopping at night, until they reached the northern coast of Spain. They then crossed over and sailed until they reached Carthagena. Despite its recent founding, the city was already grand and extensive, situated at the head of a gulf facing south. The town stood on a hill overlooking a wide lagoon that connected to the sea.

Sailing into the harbor, the fleet reached the bay's end, docking at the spacious quays. Carthagena's bustling trade routes connected it to Carthage, Spain, Africa, and the East.

Hannibal's face, characterized by kindness and sincerity, stood out among the Carthaginians. In battle, Hannibal donned a bronze helmet with laurel leaves, a coat of gold chain mail, and a purple mantle.

At night, Hannibal slept on a lion skin without a blanket, unfazed by heat or cold. Even in harsh storms, he rode bareheaded, seemingly unaware of the tempest. He was known for his impeccable morals, rarely drinking wine and never losing his temper. His patience and cheerfulness inspired his troops, who came from diverse backgrounds but were united in their love for him. Hannibal's personal influence bound the army together, enabling them to achieve remarkable military feats against Rome. The soldiers, including Malchus, embarked on a challenging campaign against the Vacaei, a long and arduous journey through mountains and rivers to punish the tribe and prepare for future expeditions.

"""I am pleased we are leaving immediately,"" he stated, ""as I was tired of wasting time in Carthage. The streets here are bustling, but glimpses of the mountains remind me of home."" Carthagena was founded by a Libyan colony and a mix of Phoenician and local people.

Hannibal, the general, advised his soldiers on how to make their beds comfortable for the night. He suggested digging out the ground where their hip bones and shoulders would rest, placing lion skins in the depressions, and lying down. Many soldiers followed his advice, while others like Malchus wanted to toughen up and sleep on the hard ground. However, Malchus soon regretted his decision when he woke up in pain. He then followed Hannibal's advice and found immense relief. The soldiers camped near a forest on the slopes of the Sierras after a long, tiring march. They prepared a meal, and as night fell, the howling of wolves echoed in the mountains, reminding Malchus of the desert sounds he was familiar with. The officer warned about the dangers of wolves and the havoc they wreak on shepherds' flocks. Malchus wondered about future hunting parties under the moonlit sky.|"['1.

The officer explained that wolf hunting was a popular winter activity near the mountains, where wolves were abundant. He warned of the dangers involved, citing instances where hunting parties never returned. The officer contrasted lion hunting with wolf hunting, noting that wolves fought in packs, unlike lions. He expressed a desire to hunt wolves in the future. The night was restless due to the wolves' howling, causing the horses to be on edge. Riders had to soothe their horses repeatedly. Despite the wolves' presence, the column continued its march, overcoming rough terrain to join the main army. Malchus encountered Gaulish mercenaries, noting their rugged appearance and unique attire.

The Gauls loved to wear shiny ornaments like necklaces, bracelets, and rings made of gold. They carried long heavy pikes, javelins, and swords. Hannibal, however, armed his Gaulish troops with straight swords only, specially made in Carthage. As they marched through a subdued land, the army was on high alert, with light horse scouting ahead and desert tribesmen guarding the flanks. The heavy armed soldiers were ready for battle. They reached the land of the Vacaei and laid siege to Salamanca. The town surrendered, and the people left behind their weapons and treasure. The Carthaginians inspected them as they left, ensuring they had no arms. The army then entered the town, finding a large amount of gold ornaments and other treasures.

Night fell shortly after the looting began. Malchus and his friends seized one of the largest houses, cleared it of debris, and readied it for the night. Suddenly, a chaotic uproar erupted—shouts, cries, clashing weapons, and enemy yells filled the air. The cavalry charged to monitor the Vacaei, thinking they had left quietly and abandoned their post, only to re-enter the town for plunder. The Vacaei exploited the city's disorder, returning and causing havoc by attacking the Carthaginians. A brief panic ensued, with many Carthaginians falling victim to the attackers. Hannibal and his generals attempted to rally the scattered troops against the enemy, but the chaos persisted. The Carthaginian legion, however, refrained from joining the looting and emerged as a cohesive force to counter the Vacaei onslaught. The Carthaginians regrouped and engaged the enemy, driving them out of the town. Hannibal's strategic approach and the Carthaginians' united front ultimately led to the defeat of the Vacaei.|"['1.

The Carthaginian army, led by Hannibal, faced a formidable enemy force of one hundred thousand soldiers. Despite being weakened from a previous battle and burdened with loot, Hannibal's strategic mind saw the impending danger. As they reached the river, the enemy planned to attack their rear during the crossing. Hannibal's troops maintained order, defending themselves with arrows and slings against the native attacks. Anticipating a morning ambush, Hannibal cleverly devised a plan to cross the river undetected. Under the cover of darkness, the army silently made their way across the ford, with infantry, wagons, cavalry, and elephants moving in unison. At dawn, the Carthaginians surprised the enemy, launching a successful counterattack as the Spaniards attempted to cross the river.

The victorious Carthaginians, led by Hannibal, triumphed over the Spanish army at Toledo, leading to the submission of southern Spain's tribes. Hannibal's army then returned to Carthagena for winter. The elite cavalry enjoyed a break from rigorous training, free to relax in the city. Hannibal's lavish household hosted grand events to entertain the people. Malchus, a young soldier, sought adventure and went hunting in the mountains with friends. He narrowly escaped being implicated in a failed plot against Carthage. Hannibal and Hamilcar warned Malchus about getting involved in political affairs, emphasizing the need for stability and caution in bringing about change in nations.

After a successful campaign, Malchus regained favor due to his good conduct and steady demeanor. Joining a hunting party in the mountains, they encountered various game like deer, bears, wolves, and wild boars. The Carthaginians skillfully hunted using javelins and arrows. At night, they hung up animal parts to attract bears, watching from trees for their arrival. While returning to camp, they got lost in the dark forest. To ward off wild animals, they lit a fire and cooked deer meat. Malchus, on watch, heard a large pack of wolves approaching.

Not long had passed since the wolves had taken the bodies of their fallen comrades. This event, showing the wolves' hunger and stealth, made the group more cautious. Halcon warned about the dwindling fuel for their fires, fearing it wouldn't last till morning. As the wolves drew nearer, the party defended themselves with arrows and fire. Running low on fuel, Halcon suggested climbing trees for safety. The group armed themselves with burning brands to fend off the wolves. In the struggle, Malchus managed to climb a tree, watching helplessly as his friends were overrun. With only a few arrows left, he sat on a branch, grieving their loss. The wolves, having devoured all, sat waiting. As the fire died, they disappeared into the darkness, but their presence lingered.|"[""1.

Malchus climbed a tree seeking refuge from wolves below. As dawn broke, his foes lingered, and he pondered his next move. Distant from his camp, Malchus knew rescue was uncertain. The wolves kept watch, hindering his escape. Nightfall brought fear, but an idea sparked hope. Using his belt as a noose, Malchus trapped and killed wolves, luring more with their blood.

The Barcine party believed in expanding Carthage's territories through conquests, differing from Hanno and the traders who favored focusing solely on commerce. They argued that Rome, with vast lands to conquer, wouldn't object to Carthage expanding in Africa. However, they overlooked the vulnerability of a wealthy but defenseless nation. Malchus, inspired by the idea of a grand expedition, envisioned a journey starting from conquering Northern Spain, crossing Gaul, overcoming mountains, and ultimately battling in Italy. The first step involved taking Saguntum, an outpost of Rome strategically located in Valencia. The Saguntines, fearing an attack, sought Rome's protection but were hesitant to send troops to such a distant spot. Hannibal, seeking a reason to attack Saguntum, prepared his army to march against the city without waiting for spring.|"[""1.

In the heat of battle, Hannibal expressed his preference for leading Gauls, but for the upcoming expedition, he favored Numidian footmen to scout and pave the way for the army. Malchus, eager for the challenge, accepted the responsibility to command this advanced company. With his trusted comrade Trebon as his lieutenant, they were tasked with being the eyes of the army, ensuring its safety during the perilous journey ahead. The Numidian footmen were put through rigorous exercises, and the two hundred most skilled were selected under Hannibal's watchful eye. Trebon, humbled by his unexpected appointment, thanked Malchus for the opportunity to serve.

Late one night, Malchus, a young soldier, noticed a peculiar gathering involving Carthaginian guards and natives. Intrigued, he decided to investigate further the next evening. Disguised in a skullcap and cloak, he observed the mysterious meeting from a window. Inside, he saw the Carthaginians conversing with the natives. The guards, though related to a noble family, seemed to support Hannibal rather than their own kin. As the meeting concluded, one of the Carthaginians handed a heavy bag to a native, hinting at a future meeting. Malchus overheard plans for the following night.

The group split up, with the Carthaginians continuing ahead and the locals following at a distance. Malchus lingered in the alley before trailing after them. Observing two natives part ways, he hastened past one who headed to the palace. Recognizing him as a servant from Hannibal's table, Malchus maintained his course without looking back. Inside, the captain of the guard teased him about his mysterious activities. Malchus, keeping his actions under wraps, pondered the implications of the secretive exchanges he witnessed.

That evening, a concert was held at the palace, bustling with guests. Malchus checked on Hannibal, wary of any danger. As the guests left, Malchus noticed a slave near a suspicious entrance.

In the morning, Hannibal's orders were carried out swiftly. The twelve natives taken as prisoners were beheaded without any torture. Fourteen others had died during the fight. Hannibal summoned the two Carthaginian nobles who were prepared to face death, believing they were implicated in the failed attempt on his life. However, Hannibal surprised them with clemency.

The army, now at a strength of 150,000 soldiers, prepared to march towards an undisclosed destination, causing much speculation among the troops. As they set out, it was revealed that their target was Saguntum, an ally of Rome. The journey was challenging, crossing mountains and rough terrain.

Hannibal faced a setback when a long delay forced him to abandon his plans for a summer march. With Saguntum behind him, he couldn't advance due to the risk of Roman armies cutting off his communication with Carthagena and Carthage. The only option was to lay siege to the town in a structured manner. The army encircled the town, leaving a strong force to prevent attacks from the garrison. Troops were then sent to gather timber from the hills for constructing towers and walls. Despite facing fierce resistance from the Saguntines, Hannibal's determination led the troops to push forward. After a prolonged battle, a breach was finally made in the walls, but the Saguntines quickly reinforced their defenses, setting the stage for a prolonged siege.|"['1.

During the lengthy siege, the Romans tried in vain to convince Hannibal to stop attacking Saguntum. Despite Roman envoys urging him to abandon the siege, Hannibal ignored their pleas. He believed it was necessary to punish the people of Saguntum, who he saw as hostile and relying on Rome for protection. The Romans then went to Carthage to protest against the attack on their allies. Rome, recovering from a previous war, wanted to delay conflict with Carthage, while Hannibal was eager to escalate the situation. The Carthaginian senate, influenced by Hannibal's supporters, rejected Rome's demands. Eventually, war was declared, and Saguntum fell to Hannibal after a fierce battle.

In the early spring, the army began its march along the coast until reaching the Ebro River. The rugged territory between the Ebro and the Pyrenees, now known as Catalonia, was home to fierce tribes untouched by Roman or Carthaginian conquest. The locals fiercely defended their land, using the mountains to their advantage. The people were hardy and ready to resist invaders, fleeing to the hills when needed. Hannibal's army faced significant challenges in conquering Catalonia, losing many men in the process.

Malchus and Nessus found themselves trapped in a cave, surrounded by hostile natives. With quick thinking, they devised a plan to defend themselves. Nessus used his spear and bow to keep the natives at bay as Malchus started a fire for light and warmth. They cooked a meal from a small bear that Nessus had hunted. As night fell, they knew they had to escape on their own. Malchus suggested rappelling down the precipice, but their clothing wouldn't make a long enough rope. They ruled out fighting their way through the natives and decided to wait until dawn to find a safer escape route. Their fate hung in the balance as they braced themselves for what lay ahead.|['1.

The two friends, Malchus and Nessus, found themselves in a precarious situation at the bottom of a steep slope. Using their bernouses, they fashioned a rope to descend the precipice. Nessus skillfully secured the rope to a tree trunk, ensuring its strength. With the rope in place, they began their descent. Malchus followed Nessus down the slope, relying on the rope to guide him. As they reached the bottom, they faced the challenge of navigating through boulders in the darkness. Suddenly, they heard shouts from above, signaling that their escape had been discovered. The natives were on high alert, searching for them. Malchus and Nessus realized they needed to find a way back up to safety. Despite the danger, they remained hopeful and determined to outsmart their pursuers.|"['1.

Nessus and Malchus were in a tight spot, hiding in a cave from the natives. They managed to escape a perilous situation by climbing a rope to the top of a rock. Nessus, being lightly armed, made it up with ease, but Malchus, weighed down by his armor, struggled. With Nessus's help, they both reached the top safely. Inside the cave, they watched as the natives took away the bear they had killed. The fugitives remained hidden, fearing discovery. The next day, the natives searched the ravine thoroughly, but they couldn't find Nessus and Malchus. The fugitives had to eat raw meat to avoid detection. Eventually, the natives seemed to give up the search, and the two friends cautiously observed from the safety of the cave.|"['1.

After feasting on the bear, Malchus and his companion ventured out into the dark, following a path. As they approached the end, they spotted enemies around a blazing fire at the ravine's mouth. The pair retreated, waiting for the fire to dim and the foes to doze off. When the time was right, Malchus and his companion cautiously moved forward. A misstep alerted the enemies, who gave chase. Malchus led the way, listening for the pursuers' shouts to gauge their distance. Eventually, they reached a wooded area and rested until dawn. Upon resuming their journey, they heard their comrades' horn, signaling their search. Reunited with their men, Malchus shared their adventure before allowing them to rest as he and Nessus stood guard.|"['1.

The locals who were chasing them didn't show up, probably hearing the signal horn alerting the Carthaginians' arrival. In two hours, the entire group gathered. After resting briefly, Malchus led them to reunite with the main army two days later. Malchus was warmly welcomed by his father and Hannibal, who thought he was lost. Nessus shared their adventure details, praising Malchus for his quick thinking in escaping a tough situation. The army crossed the Pyrenees, facing challenges like building roads and bridging streams. The Carthaginians used explosives to clear rocks, showing advanced engineering skills. The army faced mountain tribes but overcame them, reaching Southern Gaul. Negotiations secured a safe passage, with Gauls impressed by Hannibal's diplomacy. The army reached the Rhone, where locals assisted in crossing the river, impressed by Carthaginians' fair treatment and payment offers.|"['1.

To increase the modes of travel, the entire army was put to work. With the help of the locals, soldiers chopped down trees, carved out canoes, and made enough to transport the army across the river in just two days. Despite the opposition from the natives, Hannibal instructed one of his top generals, Hanno, to lead a division up the riverbank at nightfall. Hanno found a suitable spot after marching five miles and used rafts made from trees to cross the river. The Spanish troops swam across with shields of hides. Signal fires were lit to alert the troops, and they embarked on canoes and vessels, with some horses swimming alongside. The troops faced rough waters and yells from the natives but managed to land successfully. Hannibal then sent scouts to gather information on Scipio's army while preparing his soldiers for the final journey over the mountains into Italy.|"['1.

"The sturdy raft held firm as they confidently stepped onto it. Once four individuals settled at the raft's end, the ties securing it were cut. A fleet of rowboats towed the raft across the river, causing some elephants aboard to tremble with fear. The creatures stood paralyzed until reaching the opposite shore. Some panicked elephants leaped into the river, using their trunks as snorkels to swim to safety. Unfortunately, the Indian handlers were swept away. Hannibal then ushered in his cavalry and the army followed. Three days later, the Romans arrived, surprised by Hannibal's northern march. Scipio redirected his forces to Genoa to confront Hannibal emerging from the Alps. Meanwhile, Hannibal crossed the Isere and reached a region Polybius called ""The Island,"" although inaccurately named. Malchus and his crew navigated a canoe, but a loose horse capsized them.

Malchus and Nessus found themselves adrift in a canoe on a swift river. Realizing they needed to lighten the load, Malchus suggested removing their armor and tying their sword belts around the canoe for safety. After freeing themselves of their heavy gear, they tried to steer the canoe towards the riverbank but were unsuccessful. Resigned to drifting downstream, they eventually reached a point where the current brought them close to the eastern bank. Exhausted and numb from the cold water, they managed to reach shore, leaving the canoe to drift away. After wringing out their clothes and resting, Malchus spotted a group of natives approaching. Knowing he couldn't escape, Malchus instructed Nessus to hide and help him later. Malchus prepared to face the approaching natives, hoping for the best.|['1.

Malchus quietly moved towards the natives without drawing his sword, realizing that fleeing or resisting was futile. The natives, part of the force opposing Hannibal's landing, captured him after killing other Carthaginians. They discussed the day's events, planning to sacrifice Malchus to their gods later. As they marched, they spotted approaching Roman and Numidian cavalry. Malchus hoped for Nessus's rescue but knew it was impossible in his current situation. The Romans and Numidians clashed fiercely, with neither side gaining a clear advantage. Eventually, the Numidians broke away, closely pursued by the Romans. The ground was littered with fallen soldiers as the two forces fought fiercely. Malchus groaned as the Numidians fled, leaving behind many casualties.|['1.

As soon as the pursuers and the pursued disappeared in the distance, the natives rushed to the scene. They mercilessly slaughtered any surviving Numidians, stripping them of their belongings. The Romans were left unharmed, and the wounded were tended to by the natives. The natives debated whether the Romans would approve of taking the spoils, deciding to hand over Malchus, a valuable prisoner, to the Roman commander. The natives then moved to the woods with the loot, leaving a few to care for the wounded Romans. When the Romans returned, they were pleased with the care given to their injured comrades. Malchus was presented to the Roman commander, who sarcastically commented on his youth. The troops, exhausted, halted for the night, wary of a possible pursuit by Hannibal's forces. At daybreak, they resumed their journey southward and eventually rejoined the Roman army. Scipio, surprised by Hannibal's swift crossing of the Rhone, prepared for battle. Malchus, brought before Scipio, maintained his composure, impressing the Roman commander with his demeanor and physique.|"['1.

After the Roman guards fell asleep, Malchus finally followed suit. He awoke to a hand on his shoulder and another over his mouth. In the darkness, Nessus cut off the feet of the dead Romans to free Malchus from his chains. They quietly navigated through the camp, disguised as Roman soldiers. As dawn broke, they blended in with the soldiers making fires and tending to horses. Malchus concealed his irons under his cloak. They decided to stay close to the camp to avoid suspicion. Moving carefully, they hid in the brushwood near the camp, out of sight from the sentries.

The night before, the Romans were watchful, so Malchus couldn't act. He shadowed them until they entered camp. Learning a Carthaginian prisoner faced execution, Malchus sought to find help. In the dark, he navigated through tents, eliminating sentries. He finally located the right tent, the smallest, and freed Malchus from his chains. As they conversed, Roman horsemen appeared but retreated without spotting them. Nessus, after ensuring the coast was clear, helped Malchus break free from his ankle chains using a boulder. They then ventured away from the Roman camp, resting in the bushes overnight. Malchus and Nessus continued their journey, ensuring they weren't left behind as Scipio's army marched on.|"[""1.

In the morning, they agreed it was essential to find food. Malchus had eaten among the Romans, but Nessus hadn't since he was upset in the Rhone four days earlier. They spotted smoke and headed towards it, finding a village. Approaching cautiously, they saw goats and a boy. Nessus shot an arrow, they feasted, and then moved on. They reached where the Carthaginian army crossed, deserted. Following traces, they met the army. Malchus shared his capture by Scipio and Nessus' rescue. Hannibal thought Scipio wouldn't pursue. The army moved through civil war lands, settled disputes, and received supplies. They headed into the Alps as winter approached, facing the harsh conditions with uncertainty.|"['1.

Malchus received orders to lead his scouts and some Gauls to talk to the natives. The Gauls could understand the locals' language. The mountaineers, thinking the small group posed no threat, chatted with them. The natives refused to let the Carthaginian army pass and planned to resist. Malchus discovered that the natives left their posts at night. Hannibal used this information to his advantage. The Carthaginians pretended to camp for the night, tricking the natives into leaving their positions. Under the cover of darkness, Malchus scouted the deserted heights and reported back to Hannibal. With the path clear, Hannibal's troops advanced. The natives, realizing they had been outmaneuvered, tried to stop the Carthaginians by rolling rocks down the mountain.

Malchus and his scouts were praised for saving the army from disaster at a pass. The army reached a town, Conflans, where the people offered peace and help. But as they continued their march along the Little St. Bernard route, they were ambushed by natives hurling rocks. Hannibal's vigilance helped protect the army. The cavalry was attacked from the rear, and chaos ensued in the narrow valley. Hannibal managed to extricate the cavalry and repel the enemy. The soldiers suffered losses but held their ground. After a night of combat, the army moved forward, facing further attacks. The sight of elephants scared the enemy off.

Many animals carrying supplies died. The column reached a steep ravine with icy walls, a stream at the bottom. Troops slipped on old snow, hit boulders, broke limbs. Cavalry tried, failed worse. Hannibal led back, built a road. Engineers cleared cliffs, infantry made a path. Elephants passed after 3 days. Troops lost many due to enemy attacks, cold, falls. Hannibal reached Italy with 26,000 soldiers. Many died in Pyrenees, Alps. Exhausted, demoralized, they found allies in the plains. Insubres provided food, rest, care.

Hannibal took his young relative to an Insubres chief for care. The chief's followers made a litter to carry the boy to their village by the river Orcus. There, the women tended to his wounds from falls, giving him a steam bath and massages. After a night's rest and a hearty breakfast, Malchus felt rejuvenated. He stayed longer than expected due to frostbite on his feet. As he recovered, he learned the local language and joined the chief's followers as they joined Hannibal's army. Hannibal's siege on Turin was successful, using a clever tunneling tactic to breach the walls. Meanwhile, Scipio captured Piacenza as he pursued Hannibal.

Hannibal gave orders for the Carthaginian cavalry to charge the enemy's center, while the Numidians attacked from the flanks. The Romans were not skilled in using cavalry, often fighting on foot. Hannibal's troops were well-trained and fought with modern tactics. The Carthaginian horse charged fiercely, overwhelming the enemy's skirmishers and cavalry. The Numidian horse then struck the Roman flanks, causing chaos. Scipio, wounded in the battle, led his troops back. Malchus, rejoining the army, was appointed to lead the Gauls. Hannibal's army crossed the Po River, building a bridge with the help of the Insubres. Malchus assisted in crossing the elephants, and a chaotic scene unfolded when an elephant hesitated on the bridge.

Agents working for Hannibal also influenced the prefect of the garrison at Clastidium with a bribe to surrender the crucial location to Hannibal. This was a significant advantage for Hannibal and a setback for the Romans as Clastidium was a vital supply depot north of the Apennines. Sempronius, a strong and active general, was enraged upon hearing this news. He immediately rode to Scipio's camp and proposed an immediate attack on Hannibal. Despite Scipio's injury from a previous engagement, he suggested staying put through winter to weaken Hannibal's allies. Sempronius, ambitious and eager for glory, insisted on attacking Hannibal due to public pressure and his desire for personal recognition. Hannibal, aware of the Roman's movements, instigated a battle by provoking the Romans to fight. The Romans were defeated in the initial skirmish, leading Sempronius to mobilize the army for a direct confrontation.

The water was freezing cold as the soldiers waded through the waist-deep river during a flood. On reaching the opposite bank, the Roman general arranged his army for battle. The infantry, consisting of about forty-five thousand soldiers, formed three lines, with sixteen thousand Roman legionaries and six thousand light infantry. The cavalry, five thousand strong, positioned on the flanks. The infantry spanned a front of two and a half miles, while the cavalry extended a mile and a quarter on each side. Hannibal's forces, though inferior, had twenty thousand infantry, eight thousand light infantry, and ten thousand cavalry. The Carthaginian formation was deeper, with a battle line less than two miles long. As the Romans struggled with cold and hunger, Hannibal's troops, well-fed and in high spirits, prepared for battle. Hannibal motivated his officers and soldiers before the Romans, chilled and breakfastless, advanced. The Carthaginian slingers, skilled in using slings and stones, initiated the battle, forcing the Roman skirmishers to retreat. The Roman war machines were ineffective against the Carthaginian onslaught, leading to the Roman front line falling into disarray. Ultimately, the heavy infantry of both armies faced off in close combat.

Sempronius positioned his second line to close the gaps in the first, and the Romans moved forward steadily. The Carthaginians, with their tightly packed formation, advanced like a solid wall, shields interlocked, overpowering the Romans. Each Roman soldier had space on either side for weapon use, while the Carthaginians had two soldiers against each Roman. The Carthaginian slingers and cavalry also attacked, causing havoc. Despite being surrounded, the Roman legions fought bravely. The Carthaginians, led by Hannibal, unleashed elephants and infantry, causing chaos. The Romans, overwhelmed, tried to flee but were pursued mercilessly. Hannibal's tactics at the Trebia battle were praised as a military masterpiece by great commanders.

Cneius Servilius Geminus and Caius Flaminius were chosen as consuls. Flaminius led the Roman army at Arretium, while Geminus commanded at Rimini. These consuls had a bitter rivalry. Geminus was supported by the aristocrats, while Flaminius was adored by the people. This competition between the generals caused harm to their armies. The Battle of Trebia resulted in Malchus losing his father, Hamilcar. The Romans fought fiercely against Hamilcar's forces, eventually breaking through. Malchus was devastated by his father's death. Hamilcar had been his mentor and guide, shaping him for a role under Hannibal. Malchus cherished their bond, even amidst the chaos of war.

One might hope for a brighter future for Carthage, a time when she will break free from the grip of corrupt leaders like Hanno. Without this hope, Carthage's fate would seem bleak even with the brilliance of Hannibal and the bravery of his soldiers. The struggle between Carthage and Rome is not just about winning battles; it's about Carthage staying true to herself. Carthage's army is smaller compared to Rome and her allies, who can field ten times as many soldiers if needed.

Hannibal, using scouts, discovered that Flaminius was heading towards Rome in a careless manner, unaware of the impending ambush. Hannibal cleverly positioned his troops near Lake Trasimene, hidden from view. The Numidian cavalry and Gaulish infantry were stationed in a valley by a stream, while light troops were concealed in the woods. The Roman army, led by Flaminius, fell into the trap and was surrounded by Hannibal's forces. A fierce battle ensued, resulting in the death of Flaminius and the capture of many Roman soldiers. Hannibal's strategic surprise attack was a success, with only a small number of Romans managing to escape.

Hannibal knew that starting the mission now would be disastrous. He needed to defeat Rome's armies, weaken their allies, and sustain his troops on Italian land. Hannibal planned to wait for Carthage's support to launch a decisive attack on Rome. He assigned Malchus to persuade tribes to join their cause. Malchus, accompanied by twenty horsemen, set out with gifts and promises for the chiefs. The journey was perilous, as Roman agents could have bribed the tribes. Malchus reached the hills, where the terrain was challenging. He split his group to find a guide to Ostragarth's village.

Malchus and Trebon discuss the challenges they face as they strive to secure alliances with the hill tribes against Rome. Malchus believes that the tribes are hesitant due to Rome's influence over the plain tribes. He argues that the tribes fear Rome's retaliation if they side with Carthage prematurely. Trebon agrees, suggesting that the tribes are waiting for a clear victor before committing. Malchus acknowledges the risks, noting that Rome's power could crush any opposition. However, he also points out that if Carthage prevails, the tribes may benefit from the spoils of war. The group then encounters Ostragarth's village, where they hope to secure an alliance by offering incentives and promises of land and plunder.|"[""1.

The leader, Trebon, decided to enter the hut while leaving his men outside to watch the horses. He felt uneasy about the chief and his people. Inside, the chief sat on a chair and asked about the situation in the plains. Malchus, the visitor, answered truthfully but exaggerated the effects of Carthaginian victories. The chief seemed well-informed and asked to see the presents they brought. Trebon noticed more villagers arriving and suspected trouble. Suddenly, a horn blew, and chaos erupted outside as the men were attacked. Malchus and Trebon fought back, trying to reach the gate. Trebon managed to clear a path, but the others were trapped.

The group agreed to accompany Trebon after he instructed them to gather provisions for a week. They arrived in a valley and prepared to ambush. Stones were readied to roll down the hill. Malchus, a member of the party, returned to Hannibal's camp after losing the presents intended for the chiefs. Hannibal praised Trebon's intelligence in rescuing Malchus and promoted him in rank. Hannibal decided not to pursue the hill tribes further due to the Romans' influence. Rome prepared for battle after the disaster at Lake Trasimene, appointing Quintus Fabius Maximus as dictator. Orders were given to destroy crops and drive off cattle in Hannibal's path. Servilius was tasked with commanding the Roman fleet against the Carthaginians. Fabius led a well-provisioned army, anticipating a confrontation with Hannibal's forces.|"[""1.

Fabius positioned his army on the hills, watching Hannibal from a distance. Hannibal, unopposed, moved through Italy's rich lands into Campania's plain. Despite Hannibal's plunder, the locals stayed loyal to Rome, frustrating the Roman soldiers. Minucius urged Fabius to attack, but Fabius, aware of Hannibal's strength, waited. Fabius secured the passes, ensuring Hannibal couldn't bypass them. Hannibal, facing dwindling supplies, devised a plan. He lit torches on oxen horns, driving them up the hills to deceive the Romans. Thinking Hannibal was abandoning his baggage, the Romans left the pass unguarded. Hannibal seized the opportunity, leading his army through the pass unopposed.

Fabius, the Roman general, was outsmarted by Hannibal as the Carthaginian army outflanked the Romans. The Gauls and Spaniards joined the battle, pushing the Romans back into the plains. Hannibal, seizing the opportunity, moved into Apulia for the winter. Fabius, following Hannibal, left Minucius in charge with strict orders not to engage in battle. However, Minucius attacked a weakly defended Carthaginian camp when Hannibal's troops were out foraging. Hannibal, seeing Minucius's aggression, retreated and Minucius was hailed a hero in Rome. Elevated to Fabius's rank, Minucius proposed sharing command, but Fabius chose to divide the army instead.

Fabius and Hannibal met in battle, but Hannibal, satisfied with the damage inflicted, retreated to his camp. Minucius, acknowledging Fabius's rescue, handed back his command. Both armies settled in for winter. Malchus missed the fight near Geronium. Hannibal entrusted him with a vital task two days after breaking Roman lines. Malchus, the general's bodyguard, was highly trusted. Hannibal, Mago, and other generals agreed that Carthage's aid was crucial for success. A year since crossing the Alps, Hannibal's forces, though victorious, suffered losses. Rome readied a superior force for spring. Hannibal urged Carthage's support for victory.

Hannibal told Malchus about the importance of his mission to Carthage. He emphasized the need for sacrifices to defeat Rome and secure Carthage's future. Hannibal instructed Malchus to inform Carthage that Rome was vulnerable and needed a final blow to fall. He detailed the requirements for reinforcements and control of the sea. Malchus set off with a group to seize a ship and sail to Carthage. They arrived at a port, took a vessel, and sailed to Corinth. In Corinth, Malchus found a Carthaginian ship heading to Carthage and secured passage. The ship set sail, and Malchus enjoyed the journey's tranquility until Nessus approached him the next day.|"['1.

Malchus was on a ship heading towards Carthage when he overheard sailors recognizing him. Unconcerned, Malchus decided to distribute money to keep his identity secret. Unaware that the ship belonged to Hanno, a powerful trader, Malchus remained focused on his mission. As Carthage neared, Malchus prepared for the challenges ahead. Upon anchoring near the harbor, Malchus was suddenly locked in his cabin. Realizing he was a prisoner, he tried to break free but failed. Malchus suspected the captain was under Hanno's orders. He mourned the likely loss of his loyal follower Nessus. As night fell, Malchus waited for his captors to make a move, ready to defend himself. The next day, the door opened slightly, and Malchus declared his identity, ready to fight for his freedom.|"['1.

With those words, Malchus surrendered his weapons and was bound, gagged, and taken to a boat. Although he briefly considered resisting, he saw the distant lights of Carthage and knew escape was impossible. The boat rowed towards the city, where Malchus was carried to a citadel. Despite the late hour, few citizens paid attention to the scene, accustomed to such midnight arrests. Malchus was taken to the temple of Moloch, then down to a dark cell beneath the temple.

Malchus finally fell asleep. When he woke up, a dim light entered his cell through a small opening in the ceiling. This opening led to a chimney that extended twenty feet up to the surface, covered by an iron grating. Malchus realized he was in a cell beneath the temple, with similar openings providing light and air for the prisoners. He knew shouting for help was futile due to the narrow passage and the guards watching for any communication attempts. Escape seemed impossible as the cell was carved in rock and heavily guarded. A Numidian slave brought him bread and water, his tongue cut out as a punishment. Later, two men led him to a chamber where he faced Hanno and other influential figures. Despite the danger, Malchus boldly delivered Hannibal's message for reinforcements to defeat Rome, knowing his fate was sealed.|"['1.

Malchus delivered Hannibal's message to the senate, emphasizing the need for reinforcements to secure Carthage's victory over Rome. He warned that without aid, Hannibal's army would weaken, leading to defeat. Hanno and his companions listened silently, and Malchus was led back to his cell. A friend, Nessus, whispered to him from above, offering help to escape. Nessus worked to loosen the bars while planning Malchus's escape beyond the citadel gates.

Malchus admitted to once being part of a group without knowing its intentions. He withdrew upon learning their aims. Despite absolution from blame by Hannibal's commissioners, Hanno sentenced him to death. Malchus, fearing immediate execution, quietly accepted his fate. With the help of Nessus, he escaped through a narrow passage in the temple. They planned to hide in the vast underground reservoirs of Carthage, where water was stored to last six months. These reservoirs were a marvel of engineering, carved from solid rock.

The town's water supply was carefully maintained. Rainwater from roofs flowed to reservoirs, unused in normal times as water was brought from distant hills via aqueducts. Air holes were cut in the rock roofs of reservoirs, and steps led down to the water. Nessus and his friends had opened a gate leading to the water. Malchus followed them down to find two Arabs with torches and a raft made of sheepskins and planks. Nessus gave Malchus a paddle and a plan to signal safety or danger. Malchus paddled slowly, mooring near a pillar and signaling to a distant light. He slept and woke to daylight in the reservoir, columns standing out in the light, with darkness beyond.|['1.

The cavern was silent and eerie, with only the occasional rustling of bats and echoes from above breaking the stillness. Malchus, hiding in the darkness, pondered his escape. He imagined the frantic search in the citadel for him and weighed his options. Despite the heightened security, he remained confident in his hiding place near the reservoir. As he awaited Nessus' signal, time passed slowly, and Malchus feared for his friend's safety. Finally, the awaited light signaled his chance to escape. Nessus informed him of the strict surveillance and searches happening in the citadel. Malchus knew he had to wait for the right moment to make his move and remain hidden until then.|"['1.

Malchus patiently waited for his chance to escape. Nessus, his ally, devised a plan involving an elephant to help Malchus flee the citadel. The plan was to hide Malchus in the howdah of the elephant, and as the elephant simulated rage, they would charge through the courtyard and out the gate. The guards would step aside, allowing Malchus to slip away unnoticed. If they failed at the gate, Malchus could still find refuge in the stable until nightfall. Nessus assured Malchus that the stables had been searched thoroughly, and the guards were now less vigilant, believing Malchus had already escaped. Nessus would return before daybreak with a disguise for Malchus, leading him to the elephant for their daring escape.|"['1.

Malchus barely slept that night, eagerly awaiting Nessus' return. When Nessus arrived, he secured the raft and mentioned they might need it again. Malchus loaded it with his clothes and a bernous. Together, they crossed to the stables in the dark. Upon reaching the elephant stables, the Indian mahout and two Arabs were present. The elephant sensed a stranger but calmed down. Nessus revealed how he narrowly escaped capture, swimming to shore after being thrown overboard. He had been vigilant, anticipating trouble. Nessus had kept watch for Malchus and was relieved to hear his response the night before. As dawn broke, the elephants were readied, with Nessus preparing food for them. The day began with activity around the stables as the elephants were tended to.|"['1.

In a short time, one of the Arabs replaced Nessus in making cakes while Nessus went into the town to meet Malchus. The plan was for Malchus to hide in the howdah on an elephant. Each person entering the citadel received a brass slip for entry and exit. As the elephants were taken to the town's fountains, the mahout prepared the elephant with Malchus hidden in the howdah. The elephant, showing signs of anger, was set off by the mahout, causing chaos in the courtyard. The elephant charged out of the gate, rushing down the road towards the town, causing panic and chaos. Malchus eventually escaped and hid in a garden while the elephant was guided back to the citadel. Malchus met Nessus and another Arab, successfully completing their plan.|['1.

Nessus was thrilled by the success of the plan, and Malchus was relieved to have escaped the danger. They decided Nessus would continue his work until evening, then request to leave. At nightfall, he went to a Barcine leader's house with Malchus's message. They then visited Manon, Malchus's relative, who heard his story and advised caution. Manon warned against revealing Hannibal's plans too soon, as Hanno's faction was strong. He suggested waiting for a better moment when the people were ready to act. Malchus agreed, disgusted by Carthage's corruption. Manon explained that Carthage's downfall was inevitable due to its complacency and lack of virtues. Malchus, though angry, understood the need for patience and strategic action.|"[""1.

Malchus made a firm decision to abandon Carthage and seek refuge among the Gauls for a free and independent life. An old man advised him to stay hidden due to spies watching their movements. Malchus suspected they were being followed and devised a plan to outsmart the spy by splitting up at a crossroad. Nessus, Malchus' companion, successfully eliminated the spy. Later, they received news about a ship arranged by Manon to sail to Corinth and then to Italy. Malchus bid farewell to Manon and prepared to depart, assuming the role of a trader.

At midnight, in silence, Malchus and Nessus left for the port. A boat waited at a secluded dock, rowing them to the anchored ship half a mile away, ready for an early start. Malchus, anxious they might be followed, paced the deck until morning. Once the ship set sail for Corinth, Malchus bought attire and gear to disguise as Latin fighters. They aimed to reach Italy discreetly, negotiating with a ship captain to drop them off near Brundusium. After haggling the price, they set sail, stopping near Brundusium. Carrying supplies, they journeyed to Hannibal's camp, surprising the general with their return. Hannibal lauded Malchus' caution, avoiding danger in Carthage. Throughout winter, Malchus aided Hannibal, maintaining troop morale and discipline, a testament to Hannibal's leadership.|"['1.

As spring progressed, Hannibal's supplies dwindled, and the ravaged land offered no provisions. Forced to relocate, he faced Roman advantages of constantly replenished supplies and flexibility in movement. The Roman consuls, Varro and Emilius, prepared for battle. Hannibal seized the opportunity, capturing Roman magazines at Cannae, thus blocking Roman access to ripe crops. The Romans, outnumbered in cavalry, took a longer route to Cannae. Neglecting their defenses, the Romans left their magazines vulnerable. Hannibal capitalized on this, seizing the supplies. The Romans, reinforced, advanced for battle. Varro and Emilius disagreed on strategy. Varro led an engagement, repelling Hannibal's forces. The Romans camped near Cannae, with Emilius securing the riverbank. Hannibal attempted to provoke a battle, but Emilius held his ground. Hannibal then outmaneuvered the Romans, setting the stage for a decisive battle at Cannae.|"['1.

Hannibal's strategic positioning proved decisive in the battle against the Romans. By cleverly placing his army along the loop of a river, he prevented the Romans from outflanking him, nullifying their numerical advantage. The infantry was led by the Spaniards and Gauls in the center, supported by African troops on the wings. Hannibal commanded the center, with Hanno and Hasdrubal leading the wings. The cavalry, under Maharbal, played a crucial role. The Roman commander, Varro, attempted to match the Carthaginian formation. However, Hannibal's tactics, combined with the advantage of the wind blowing dust into the faces of the Romans, led to a devastating defeat. The Carthaginian cavalry overwhelmed the Romans, while the infantry engagement resulted in heavy losses for the Romans. Hannibal's well-coordinated attack left the Roman forces decimated, with only a fraction surviving the onslaught.|"[""1.

The Carthaginians were overjoyed by their victory, but Hannibal, knowing the Roman spirit, decided against attacking Rome. The Romans, fierce defenders, quickly gathered reinforcements after their defeat. Rome prepared for a siege, sending troops to defend against Hannibal. Despite Hannibal's astonishing victory at Cannae, he realized besieging Rome would be risky. Rome's resilience was evident as they confidently prepared for defense, showing unity and determination. Varro, fearing death for his defeat, faced the senate, who, impressed by his bravery, pardoned him. Hannibal, aiming to weaken Rome, released Italian prisoners and offered peace terms, but Rome refused. Hannibal chose to continue his strategy of weakening Rome's allies, recognizing that besieging Rome could jeopardize his gains.|"[""1.

After the victory at Cannae, Hannibal's success continued as Apulia, Arpi, and Celapia allied with him. Mago and Hanno were sent to Bruttium and Lucania to secure more support. Hannibal marched into Samnium, then Campania where Capua joined him. Despite Rome's efforts to rebuild its army, Carthage failed to reinforce Hannibal due to internal politics. Hannibal, stationed in Capua, sent Malchus to Sardinia to organize the locals against Rome. During a storm at sea, Malchus and his men faced peril, with the galleys at risk of sinking.

Malchus, son of Hamilcar, a relative of Hannibal, admitted surrendering was the best choice. The crew on board the ships observed the Italian galley, unaware of its Carthaginian passengers.

As he spoke, he stepped aboard, ordered the anchor to be lifted, and the galley, along with the two Roman boats, rowed to the shore. A messenger was sent to Mucius to inform him of the events, and soon the praetor himself arrived at the scene. The officer informed him about the Carthaginian leader and two noble officers accompanying him. The praetor saw this as a stroke of luck, as they could potentially be exchanged for Roman prisoners held by the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians were allowed to disembark, laying down their weapons. The Roman garrison, curious about their adversaries, gathered at the port to witness their arrival. The Carthaginians, led by Malchus and his friend Trebon, impressed the Romans with their strength and battle scars. The Carthaginians were then marched to the citadel to be put to work as slaves in the mines, following a senate decision not to exchange prisoners.|['1.

The main mine was in a narrow valley west of the town leading to the sea. Malchus and his friends were handed over to the officer at the top mining site. They were surprised by the large number of people living in huts made of boughs or sods along the valley. Roman sentries guarded the hilltops, ready to quell any uprising. Most were Sard slaves, others were free laborers forced to work. The labor was brutal, with small passages and stifling air. The officer promised Malchus and his friends overseer roles. They worked with Sards sorting lead ore. The men returned exhausted from crawling through narrow passages in the mines.|"[""1.

In the mines of Montepone, the Carthaginian captives toiled under harsh conditions. They were beaten and overworked, with some even perishing from exhaustion and illness. Malchus and his friends, seeing the suffering of their comrades, devised a plan for escape. Aware of the challenges, they decided to rely on makeshift weapons like stones and stakes. The only opportunity for action was after work when they were allowed near the stream. Malchus proposed a daring escape plan involving a sudden rush at the guards above the mine. The men were to hide sticks and stones, then converge and overpower the sentries. Despite the risks of betrayal and vigilant guards, the captives were determined to break free from their cruel fate.|"['1.

Even the most tired men, some even sick with fever, found renewed energy at the thought of fighting for their freedom. As the work gang assembled in the morning, no one lagged behind. By evening, the Carthaginians returned from their labor, quickly eating their provisions before heading towards the stream. Malchus, the leader, was the last to leave. He gathered rocks and joined his followers near the huts. Together, they swiftly overpowered Roman sentries, seizing their weapons and fleeing into the forest. After a long run, they rested near a stream, planning to stay hidden. Malchus strategized to hunt for food and set up a camp deep in the forest to evade capture. The group, feeling safe for the night, set up sentries and prepared for the challenges ahead.

When the soldiers had surrounded the valley and captured the herd of pigs, they celebrated their success. A peasant who was looking after the pigs was startled by the sudden commotion. The soldiers allowed the peasant to go free but confiscated the pigs for their use. The soldiers were excited about having meat but had no way to cook it. They quickly made a fire and cooked the meat on sticks. Malchus and his companions had their food prepared separately. After the meal, the soldiers improved their spears by hardening the points in the fire. Two men were assigned to keep the fire burning as they marched into the mountains. The soldiers found a suitable camping spot in a valley where they set up shelters and cooked more food. Malchus and Halco discussed their future plans, deciding that they could not stay hidden in the mountains forever and needed to rejoin Hannibal's forces to fight against Rome.|"['1.

Malchus doubted that Rome would agree to the terms proposed by the escaped prisoners. He expressed a desire to see Rome, even if as a prisoner. Malchus and his companions scouted the area, setting up lookout points and preparing for potential threats. They later ventured across the mountains, looting a village for supplies. The men returned to camp, laden with grain and other necessities. They repeated similar raids periodically for supplies. One day, a column of smoke signaled the arrival of a large force. The Carthaginians hid their belongings and prepared to defend themselves. Malchus had already planned defensive strategies, positioning his men strategically. As the enemy approached, the Carthaginians took their stand atop the rocks, ready to face the Roman troops and native allies.|"['1.

When the leader of the group reached the narrow valley path, the soldiers stopped, and the locals went ahead to scout. They returned with news that the path was clear, and the group continued. As they approached the gorge, a sudden shout echoed, and rocks rained down from the cliffs, injuring many Romans. The commander ordered a retreat, and the soldiers began to climb the hillside. After a strenuous effort, they reached the crag but found it deserted. Despite a thorough search, the Carthaginians remained elusive, launching surprise attacks from inaccessible spots. After days of pursuit, the Romans decided to return, having suffered losses. A native approached the commander with a message from the Carthaginian leader, proposing terms of surrender to avoid further conflict. The commander agreed to meet the Carthaginians the next day to discuss the truce.|['1.

The Roman general was pleased with Malchus' request for being sent to Rome as prisoners of war instead of being kept in the island. He saw this demand as more acceptable than having to admit defeat by returning Malchus and his companions to the Carthaginian army in Italy. After some negotiation, the terms were agreed upon. Malchus and his friends enjoyed a fortnight of hunting while awaiting Rome's response. Eventually, the terms were accepted, and they were escorted by Roman soldiers to the port for their departure to Rome. As they sailed towards their destination, Malchus and his companions looked out for any sign of Capua or Carthage's ships, but none appeared. Upon reaching the Tiber River and seeing the grandeur of Rome, they were in awe of the city's size and architecture, though it was less magnificent than Carthage. Upon arrival, they were greeted by a crowd, and Malchus and his companions were escorted through the city to their destination.|"[""1.

The captives, though surrounded by a hostile crowd, showed no signs of defeat. They bore themselves with the air of victors rather than prisoners, recalling their past victories over Rome's soldiers. The Romans, rough and brutal, taunted them, while the nobles admired their fearless demeanor. Lady Flavia, wife of the consul, set her eyes on a young Carthaginian noble, Malchus, to be her slave. Sempronius, a suitor for her daughter's hand, reluctantly agreed to her wish. He feared that Malchus, being a cousin of Hannibal and a noble in his own right, might win the affections of Flavia's daughter, Julia.

His family was less distinguished than hers. Her approval of his suit with Julia was a piece of good fortune he owed to Gracchus. Gracchus wanted his daughter to marry Julius Marcius, who had offended Flavia. He believed he would have no trouble with his father. The praetor wished his son to ally with Gracchus. Prisoners of war not sacrificed were given as slaves to nobles. There were no major arena contests yet. Sempronius went home feeling moody. The praetor had seen Malchus and officers in prison. Sempronius conveyed Flavia's request. The praetor hesitated but decided to send Malchus and his officers as gifts to powerful families to please Flavia. Malchus compared Rome favorably to Carthage. The Romans' simplicity, lack of luxury, and free spirit impressed him. The tyranny of the senate and secret arrests made Carthage seem subservient. Romans were more equal and free. Malchus pondered these differences in his cell when Sempronius arrived to take him. Domestic slavery in Rome was not harsh. Slaves were treated well, and the Romans were kind to their families and slaves. Favored slaves were trusted and sometimes freed.|['1.

Flavia, a wealthy Roman woman, praised Sempronius for finding Malchus, a handsome Carthaginian youth, to serve her. She instructed Sempronius to inform Malchus of his duties, which included accompanying her on walks, standing behind her at meals, and caring for her pets. Malchus was entrusted with the care of various animals, including a lion cub. Despite the lion's recent aggression, Malchus approached it calmly, earning its trust. The other slaves were impressed by Malchus's handling of the lion and sought to befriend him to gain favor with Flavia. Later, Malchus met Julia, Flavia's daughter, who was intrigued by his background and connection to Hannibal.

Malchus and Clotilde met after a long time. Clotilde shared how her father and tribe were defeated, and she was taken as a Roman slave. Malchus, surprised by her transformation into a beautiful woman, planned to escape and asked Clotilde to join him. They decided to act as strangers to avoid suspicion. Malchus, now a Roman slave, spent time with Flavia and her daughter. He was pleased to find Clotilde in Rome as he had planned to marry her.

"""I am not a suitable match for you,"" she explained. ""Even in the past, when my father was alive and our tribe was whole, what standing did we have for me to marry a noble from Carthage? Now, with the tribe scattered, I am just a Roman slave."" ""You are much more than that,"" she continued earnestly.

Sempronius hesitated, torn between seeking revenge and maintaining Lady Flavia's favor. Despite the contemptuous tone from both mother and daughter, he chose to suppress his anger and apologized for striking their slave. Meanwhile, Malchus, the Carthaginian slave, quietly left the room. Malchus, now at home in Rome, began planning an escape with Clotilde, another slave. They prepared disguises and a means to flee the city. Malchus was concerned about the challenges they would face once outside Rome, especially traveling with Clotilde. Sempronius, on the other hand, sought to exploit the growing affection between Julia and Malchus to his advantage, hoping to incite jealousy in Julia.

One day, Sempronius casually mentioned to Julia about the possibility of her mother's two slaves, the Carthaginian and the Gaul, being a good match. Julia, deep in thought, asked Clotilde if she knew Malchus before meeting at their home. Clotilde acknowledged recognizing Malchus from before and hinted at their past. Julia, in a sudden outburst, confessed her feelings for Malchus, revealing his noble lineage. Flavia, her mother, sternly rebuked Julia, pointing out the impracticality and scandal of such a union.

Lady Flavia informed Malchus that negotiations for his release were facing obstacles due to the Roman senate's refusal to exchange citizens who surrendered. However, the influential friends of Praetor Publius were striving to secure Malchus' exchange, offered by Hannibal. Flavia promised to support these efforts and even consider Clotilde's release to Malchus. Flavia's decision was influenced by her desire to avoid conflict with her headstrong daughter Julia, who had mistreated Clotilde. Additionally, Flavia saw potential advantages in befriending someone close to Hannibal in case of future events. Despite initial hopes for his release being dashed, Malchus still had a plan for escape. Meanwhile, Julia plotted to have Clotilde abducted, seeking Sempronius' help for the task.|"[""1.

Julia instructed Sempronius to remove the bolts from the back entrance of the house and bring two barefooted slaves at 2 a.m. to quietly abduct a girl. Sempronius agreed, planning to take the girl to a safe place until it was safe to leave the city. However, Malchus, a slave, mistook the situation for a robbery and intervened when he saw Clotilde being carried away. A scuffle ensued, and a lion in the house attacked the intruders.

Flavia was deeply troubled by the events of the night. She questioned the two slaves found in her house after midnight, shocked by the scandal unfolding. She ordered them to attend to the injured slave and fetch a healer. Concerned about her daughter, Julia, she discovered she was asleep, unaware of the chaos. Flavia suspected a plot to abduct a slave girl, involving her son and the deceased Sempronius. To preserve their families' honor, Flavia and the praetor decided to keep the incident secret.

The magistrate approved the plan, and it was executed smoothly. The secret was so well kept that nobody in Rome doubted Sempronius had succumbed to illness. Julia was furious upon learning the disappearance of the Gaulish slave girl and the Carthaginian. She demanded a search and reward. She was shocked by Sempronius' death and her accomplice's escape. Julia confessed to her mother, who sent her away in anger to a secluded summer retreat. Malchus secured Clotilde's safety first, then they fled disguised through Rome. They reached the wall, descended, and disguised themselves. They rowed down the Tiber and landed near Terracina. They traveled through hills and woods, avoiding the Roman army. Their journey was tough, but they managed to gather food and cover over a hundred miles.|"[""1.

"Twice, they had stumbled upon herds of semi-wild goats in the mountains, and Malchus managed to bring down a young goat with a stone. Their travels were not extensive, always taking breaks during the hottest hours of the day. It took them ten days after departing from Rome to catch sight of the walls of Capua. ""We will wait until dusk,"" Malchus suggested. ""The dye is fading, and your arms are too fair for a peasant girl. I will take you straight to Hannibal's palace, and you will be dressed splendidly.

Malchus explained his plan to travel beyond the Alps to find Clotilde's mother, who belonged to a tribe unfamiliar with Rome. He intended to convince her to join them, or journey to her tribe in Germany if she was deceased. Additionally, Malchus aimed to rally the Gauls for freedom against the Romans. Hannibal supported his decision, acknowledging the desire for a new life free from Carthage's declining influence. Malchus and Clotilde were married, and he set out with a group to raise Gaulish tribes. Nessus, who escaped from prison, joined Malchus, dismissing the idea of wealth and opting for the journey.

Malchus, a Carthaginian officer, was tasked by Hannibal to win the Gaulish chiefs' friendship. He set out with a troop, carrying gifts and money. Clotilde, a Gaulish woman skilled in horse riding, accompanied him. They faced minor skirmishes but continued their journey smoothly. Malchus reached Clotilde's village in ruins and sent scouts to find her mother, Brunilda. Finally, they reunited, and Brunilda was overjoyed to see her daughter and learn about Malchus. Despite Malchus's efforts to unite the Gauls against Rome, the people were disheartened and unwilling to fight. Malchus stayed through winter but left in spring, realizing the Gauls were not ready for rebellion. He decided to return to Capua, but Brunilda and her tribe chose to join their kinsmen in Germany.

Malchus, a man of wealth and knowledge, settled among the Gauls, introducing them to some civilized customs while maintaining their barbaric lifestyle. He built a house and led them in military formations, gaining immense influence. Malchus instilled in them a deep hatred of Rome, foreseeing its conquest attempts. Rumours of Hannibal's struggles against Rome reached Malchus, but he remained focused on preparing his tribe. Despite setbacks, Hannibal fought alone against Rome for years until Scipio's arrival in Carthage forced its surrender.
