When Pa and I arrived at the circus, he made quite an impression with his fancy clothes, black chin whiskers, and a watch chain over his checkered vest. The circus owners introduced Pa as an old stockholder who would assist in managing the show for the season. Pa tried to be friendly, but some circus workers doubted his abilities. They decided to play a prank on him by hoisting him up on a horse with a rope belt. Pa was surprised but tried to play along until he almost fell off the horse. The circus workers eventually let him down after a bit of teasing. Pa took it all in good humor and even paid them for the joke. Later, during dinner, Pa accidentally sat on a performer's lap, causing a commotion. Despite some mishaps, Pa had a great time and even joked with the circus crew. Later, we visited the animal barn, and the creatures inside seemed as curious about us as we were about them. The lion, tiger, hyena, and other animals put on a show of growls and laughs that made Pa a bit nervous. Nevertheless, Pa bravely went around visiting each animal, while I was fascinated by a female kangaroo and her babies. The female kangaroo's pouch was a marvel of nature, providing a safe space for her young ones to hide when scared.

Pa arrived at the circus without a coat while I was hopping around. His pants had a tear, so I asked what happened. Pa explained that he got too close to a sleeping leopard's cage. The leopard slyly grabbed the tail of Pa's coat and effortlessly snatched it off. Despite this mishap, Pa remains optimistic about our circus adventure. He believes that once we get the hang of things, it will be fantastic. Each day promises new thrills. Tomorrow, we're assisting in extracting a tooth from a boa-constrictor. Pa and I will also help scrub a rhinoceros and oil a hippopotamus. The excitement is just beginning, and I can't wait to write more in my diary after we attend to the snake. Pa had a tough day at the circus office dealing with issues between the fat woman and the living skeleton.

In a menagerie, animals mirror human society. Lions act as proud but poor leaders, always criticizing others. Sacred cattle pose as pious and holier-than-thou, stealing from others while pretending innocence. Goats are the new rich, trying to outdo society leaders but are merely tolerated due to their smell. Bears represent the working class, with grizzlies as the delegates controlling them. Hyenas and wolves are anarchists, causing chaos. Zebras and giraffes are the show-offs, while tigers would drive recklessly. Hippos are lazy, while seals are smart and clean. The circus is packed with precision, but chaos ensues when a snake needs a tooth pulled. Packing up for the road is a challenge, with the fat woman's mishap causing a ruckus in the sleeper car.|['1.

Pa's close call with death in a circus accident left him trapped in a brass helmet, looking like a boiled lobster. He narrowly escaped being arrested for speeding. During a circus parade, chaos ensued when the horses went off course, followed by camels and elephants. The band ended up in a stream, and the parade invaded a farmer's yard, causing a commotion. Eventually, the circus returned to normal, but Pa was examined for insanity. Railroad wrecks were common in the circus business, often resulting in financial settlements for the injured. One night, a train crash left everyone shaken, with pa dreaming about secret handshakes. Despite the chaos, the circus carried on, making the best of the unpredictable life on the road.|"['1.

One day, Pa and I were on a train that derailed, and chaos ensued. Pa believed he was being initiated into a secret Masonic degree, but it was just a train wreck. The conductor urged us to flee the burning train. Pa, thinking he was at a banquet when sprayed with fire extinguisher water, was a hero helping others escape. The circus performers, including a giant and a bearded woman, faced challenges. Claim agents arrived, offering settlements for injuries. Pa pretended to be injured severely, hoping for compensation.

Pa made a funny face and groaned. The agent consulted with another agent and then approached me, asking for pa's full name. They wrote a check and admitted it was the first time they didn't try to underpay an injured party in a railroad accident. The agents shook hands and left. Pa winked, and we boarded a special train to Pittsburgh. He promised to buy me a dog with the money. Trouble arose between Russian Cossacks and Japanese jugglers. The Japs were offended when I warned them about the Russians. The Russians got angry and a fight seemed imminent. The Japs, however, outsmarted the Russians using jiu-jitsu moves, causing chaos. Pa got involved but was swiftly overpowered by a Jap. The circus staff intervened, preventing further clashes. Pa, injured, jokingly claimed he was thrown from an airship and landed on dynamite.

A strange incident occurred in Germantown, Pa, involving a circus strike. Teamsters demanded better wages and shorter hours, causing chaos. The circus management struggled to transport goods from the train to the lot due to the strike. The teamsters even convinced local draymen to join them, halting all work. The Teamsters' union took over, leaving the show stranded. The situation worsened when the animals rebelled. Elephants performed carelessly, kangaroos refused to box, and camels growled. The show suffered as the animals acted out. The managers were puzzled until Pa, observing the animals, realized they were on strike. He resolved the issue by providing fresh hay and meat, restoring peace and success to the circus.|"['1.

Ever since we learned that our show was scheduled for Philadelphia on a Saturday, and we had to stay over Sunday in that town, there have been signs of unrest. Everyone involved with the show dreads the idea of staying in Philadelphia. They argue that it is too dull for the living and unsatisfactory for the deceased. A performer from last year claims that only newspaper people with free tickets attended the shows, and some would only enter the tent if promised a free lunch with potent ginger ale. A ginger ale binge is dreadful. When a person drinks too much ginger ale, their stomach gets upset, causing them to act irrationally. Last year, our press agents got the local press drunk on ginger ale, and this time the newspapers had warrants out for our show, accusing us of a crime related to ginger ale. The Quakers in Philadelphia are known for their reserved nature, wearing gray clothes and white hats, and showing little emotion during our parade. Last year, a Quaker died at our show, leading the community to turn against us. The Quaker was accidentally kicked by a performer and died, but the community felt we should have stopped the show out of respect. Philadelphia may seem quiet on Sundays, but my father found himself in quite a situation there. He had to deal with Indians from our wild west department, who held a corn roast near our circus lot. The Indians had a barrel of beer, and when my father tried to intervene, things escalated quickly. The Indians attacked|"['1.

Just then, the man in charge of our cannibals, each accompanied by a dog they wanted to roast, arrived. I informed him about the Indians' corn roast. He commanded the cannibals to drive the Indians away and roast their dogs instead. The plan succeeded, and the cannibals swiftly forced the Indians to flee. We freed pa just in time. The cannibals skinned and cooked their dogs, while pa, uncomfortable but grateful, watched. However, when the cannibals drank Philadelphia beer, they decided to roast pa. Despite offering him dog meat, which he refused, the cannibals were about to cook him when the performers intervened. A commotion ensued, resulting in the rescue of pa and the dogs. After a chaotic night, pa was reprimanded for the chaos and sent to New York to find a volunteer for a human roasting exhibition. This bizarre circus life is causing me to lose friends, even the monkeys avoid me. On a lighter note, we acquired a baboon that dines like a man, causing quite a stir.|"['1.

One lady on the ship has been following us since to collect money from Pa, as his eldest son, the monk, proposed to her. It seems a woman should know the difference between a baboon and a man, but some women marry anything in clothes. The monk took a liking to me, so Pa wanted me to teach him all men's tricks. I thought teaching him to chew tobacco wouldn't hurt since he could already smoke. I gave him a big chew of black plug tobacco, and he swallowed it. The monk got sick, kicked over a table, and hit Pa. The Humane Society had Pa arrested for animal cruelty. We thought we were clever when we demanded money from the railroad in Pennsylvania, but we faced a storm in Poughkeepsie that blew the tent down during the show, causing chaos and injuries. People filed claims, and lawyers pursued us. We settled in New York for a two-week show at Madison Square Garden. We are resting in hotels, and Pa is getting attention from the managers, who think he is trying to take over any act. One thrilling act involves lions, tigers, and leopards performing stunts, with a blindfolded horse ridden by a lion, tigers on bicycles, leopards jumping, a monkey clown, and a little elephant driving a pretend car. It's a show worth watching.|"['1. What did the narrator teach the monk to do?\nA) Smoke\nB) Chew tobacco\nC) Juggle\nD) Ride a bicycle\nE) Drive a car', '2.

The circus was in chaos when the regular trainer got drunk at Coney Island. Pa, my dad, stepped in to save the day by taking over the animal act. Despite his large belly, he dressed as the trainer. The tigers, lions, and even the blind horse seemed to sense something was off. Pa managed to get the animals to perform their stunts, but they were clearly plotting against him. The grand finale turned into a hilarious disaster as the animals ganged up on pa, tearing his clothes off. Surprisingly, pa emerged unscathed, much to the audience's amusement. The show's financial woes were also discussed, with creditors chasing them for money. Pa tasked me with finding a solution to re-energize the animals.

Animals have a funny way of reacting to things. If you try to give them something, they won't take it, but if you hide it, they'll find it and play with it. I once gave snuff to a lion, and he sneezed so hard it blew feed all over the crowd. The lion's sneeze even scared the sacred cow nearby. The lion kept sneezing and roaring, and even blew my dad across the tent! Then the hyenas started sneezing and fighting, causing chaos. The camels and giraffes got sick too, sneezing and acting wild.

Pa rushed over to the tank where the hippo was, just in time for the unexpected sneeze. The hippo had gone underwater, preparing for the sneeze, and when it finally came, it was a powerful blast. Water shot up like a torpedo explosion, drenching Pa and the audience. The hippo lay at the bottom of the tank, sneezing and panting. The manager praised me for preventing the show from becoming dull, suggesting I bring my snuff cure to the other performers. Later that day, Pa was terrified in Delaware, fearing the public lashings criminals received. We played a prank on him, making him flee to Washington, D.C.

Pa sighed and expressed his desire for a more exciting life to distract from his aging concerns, having ventured into the circus business. However, he found it too demanding. He asked his son, Hennery, to leave temporarily for some rest. Hennery reassured his father, promising to stay by his side until the circus season ended. They encountered a humorous situation when elephants invaded a farm near the Bull Run battlefield. Pa and the circus crew had to round up the elephants, who had gotten drunk on cider.

The president compared the political business to bear hunting, where you track your target like a bear with dogs or politicians. The chase intensifies until you corner your prey, facing obstacles like torn clothes from briars or opposition newspapers. Once you confront your opponent, you must aim for a vital shot to bring them down. The president shared this analogy, but when asked about facing another challenge after the first, he deflected. Later, a mischievous idea involving a seal and an alarm clock caused chaos at the circus, leading to a scolding from the narrator's father.

Everyone was eager to catch a glimpse of Dennis, the orangutan. Posters around town depicted Dennis in a suit smoking cigarettes and dining with utensils, drawing in more spectators. The managers feared the show would fail without an orangutan, so they dressed me as Dennis, complete with a monkey mask, to perform his act. Reluctant but pressured by my father, I mimicked Dennis' routine. Despite a mishap with the tail and a prank with my coffee and cigarette, I persevered through the performance until my monkey mask fell off, revealing my true identity and leading to chaos in the audience.|"['1.

I removed my fancy coat and headed towards him, but my dad and the monkey trainer each grabbed one of my arms, urging me to go back to playing the monkey role. They even attempted to put the monkey mask back on me, but I resisted. I refused to continue being a monkey with a fake tail, a belly filled with spicy pepper, and my nose stuffed with snuff. The audience erupted in anger, calling for the bald-headed man, who they thought was the monkey's father, to be punished. Just as chaos was about to break out, the chariot racers burst out of the dressing room and scattered the crowd, averting a disaster. Later, a lawyer threatened us for not delivering what was promised, but my dad paid him off to avoid trouble.

The zebras were up next, gobbling their horseradish quietly before bursting into a wild dance, resembling a million kaleidoscopic shapes. Pa, bewildered, compared it to his drinking days, suspecting something was amiss with the menagerie. Chaos ensued as the educated hog struggled, llamas cried in Spanish, and elephants gulped lemonade. Carnivorous animals, fed horseradish-spiked meat, caused a ruckus. The lion somersaulted, grizzly bear rolled, and hyenas howled. An investigation revealed the cause: turnips mixed with horseradish instead of the usual fare. To boost business, a plan involving political clubs was hatched. Pa and his son incited a near-riot in Atlanta, nearly jeopardizing the circus.

The African American man asked me how I kept hornets from stinging our workers. I explained that we used asafoetida on our clothes and faces, which kept the hornets away. He was impressed and said that Africans were gullible. He even praised his assistant for organizing a group to collect hornets' nests. We then placed the nests in Chinese lanterns for a show.

Amidst the pandemonium, a detective accused Hennery of foul play. His father, a prosecutor, defended him. The circus band was incapacitated by hornet stings, and the show ended abruptly.

The buffalo sensed the presence of the Indians and began to stampede, reminiscent of their days on the plains. All the animals followed suit, pulling along the men holding their ropes. The zebras led the way, with the elephants bringing up the rear. Cowboys and Indians trailed behind, shouting and making noise. Over 500 Indian dogs were barking. Pa made a foolish move by tying his elk's rope to his belt, causing him to be dragged along. Amidst the chaos, the narrator struggled to keep up with his antelope, which was terrified.
