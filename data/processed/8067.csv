Davy, as usual, was climbing trees and exploring every hole he could find. Monkey Jones, with his unique abilities, swung daringly from limb to limb like a squirrel. His chattering reminded Giraffe of Davy's tree-climbing ancestry. Among the branches of a large tree, Davy played joyfully, causing excitement among his friends. Suddenly, he shouted, alarming everyone. Bumpus, fearing a wild beast, searched for a weapon. Davy claimed a beast with yellow eyes lurked above, making his friends anxious. After Davy descended, they cautiously approached, suspecting a prank. Davy described the eyes in the tree, resembling a panther.

"The tall scout declined the offer to climb the tree due to hunger and a lack of enthusiasm for tree climbing. Another scout, Giraffe, was accused of having ""cold feet"" and being too nervous to climb. Thad, the scout-master, climbed the tree cautiously, checking for any panthers. The other scouts, except Allan, were nervous about the situation. Davy was convinced there was a real panther in the tree. Allan emphasized the importance of caution in such situations. Bumpus and Davy got into a playful argument, distracting themselves from the tension. Step Hen advised them to watch Thad, who seemed to have encountered something.

Two scouts were eager to visit the Soo Canal and witness the rushing rapids of the St. Mary River. As evening approached, they prepared a hearty supper of Boston baked beans, steak, fried onions, toasted bread, and coffee. Amidst their meal, they debated whether to release a captive owl. The scouts enjoyed the serene atmosphere, with one of them singing melodious tunes. As night fell, they chose to sleep by the fire, listening to the distant hooting of an owl. The prospect of embarking on their boat journey the next day filled them with anticipation. With no tent, they relied on the warmth of the fire for the night.

One night at camp, a scout woke up to a strange noise. Frustrated, he poured water on a sleeping scout who snored with his mouth open. Startled, the drenched scout danced around in his pajamas, revealing a cut on his hand. Concerned friends rushed to help, cleaning and bandaging the wound. The injured scout explained how he had been bitten by an owl he mistook for a wild animal in his dream.

Step Hen suggested tying up Bumpus at night to prevent him from releasing the pets in his sleep. Bumpus objected, blaming Step Hen for his predicament with the owl.

Thad carefully inspected the engine of the boat with Allan by his side. Despite his knowledge, Thad anticipated some challenges due to the outdated design of the Lake Superior vessel. Keeping their concerns private, they prepared to set sail. As the boat glided through the water, excitement filled the scouts, eager for the adventures that lay ahead. Davy Jones praised the stocked provisions, teasing Bumpus about potential mishaps. Suddenly, a loud bang silenced the engine, prompting Bumpus to fear the worst. In a moment of panic, he leaped overboard, expecting an explosion. Giraffe, though nervous, rallied the group to stand by Thad, seeking guidance.

The elderly man, in a foolish move, leaped into the water without a word, leaving his companions shocked. Step Hen, with a mix of sadness and a hidden smile, suggested the lake's rise as a reason for the sudden plunge.

The good news lifted their spirits, and the group got to work eagerly. A small stove on the boat used gasoline, providing them with the means to cook while away from land.

Thad couldn't clearly see the waiting figures, but the shifting light suggested they were nearing the shore. He anticipated an explosion when the mistake was realized. The cruiser bumped against rocks, almost toppling Giraffe. Three men emerged, dressed like fishermen. The leader, recognizing the scouts, revealed they were revenue officers looking for a smuggler. They laughed off the mix-up, having mistaken the scouts for smugglers. One officer, intrigued by the scouts' patrol, sought to share the encounter with his sons. The scouts introduced themselves, and the officer, Stebbens, expressed admiration for their adventures. Despite the disappointment, the revenue men had to leave to track the real smuggler, Cranston.

The tall scout, Giraffe, was determined to prove his fire-making skills using primitive methods with a bow and a revolving stick. Despite numerous setbacks, he persevered until he mastered the technique, becoming one of his proudest accomplishments. Each scout shared stories about slippery characters, adding excitement to the moment. Mistaken for notorious smugglers, the boys discussed their encounters with the Government revenue men. Bumpus, pleased with the adventure, planned to send his picture to two boys, Daniel and Luther Stebbens. The group settled down for the night, assigning Bumpus a spacious spot near the cabin doors due to his size.

"""Hey guys, did you know that Giraffe has been trying to predict the weather lately?"" mentioned one of his friends casually. ""He's been studying signs like goose bones and Washington's weather methods. He's been pretty accurate recently, predicting fair weather for the past three days. But today, he's seeing signs of change with clouds in the southwest, hinting at high winds and possibly a storm.""

Bumpus asked Thad for his opinion, skeptical of Giraffe's predictions. Thad acknowledged the clouds as a sign of a storm, despite Giraffe's usual joking demeanor. The group began to worry about reaching a safe harbor.

Giraffe, who initially thought of teasing Bumpus, became serious as the engine showed signs of trouble. Despite the engine's issues, Thad reminded them to appreciate the boat loaned by Dr. Hobbs.

No one seemed to have a plan to improve the situation as it was. Thad's request was met with silence for several minutes. The boys observed Thad tinkering with the engine, trying different things to get better results. Bumpus, gathering courage, suggested running the boat to the beach if they couldn't make the harbor. Thad warned that the rocky shore would likely wreck the boat before they could land. Davy noticed the clouds gathering quickly, hinting at an approaching storm. Bumpus reeled in the fishing lines, hoping for a catch. The mention of Sturgeon Island sparked interest in fishing. Bumpus shared his knowledge of sturgeon fish.

"""It seems like a race between the storm and reaching Sturgeon Island,"" Giraffe remarked, scanning the horizon from the boat. The success of their journey hinged on the engine's performance. The group, led by Thad, hoped to find refuge on the island's shore, shielded from the storm's wrath. As the boat navigated the northern waters, they were shielded from the worst of the weather.

In the swirling waters near the end of the island, the scouts faced a fierce storm. The wind howled, waves crashed, and the surf roared. Giraffe and Bumpus clung desperately to the boat. With faces expressing their fear, they braved the elements. Thad's voice barely cut through the storm, shouting about their slim chance to reach safety. They grasped poles to navigate the shallows around the island. As they neared the end, the scouts pushed the boat with all their might, anchoring it just in time.

As they parted ways, Allan expressed his worry, emphasizing the importance of being prepared. Thad assured him he'd be discreet and explore the island for any hidden structures.

Giraffe was confident in his ability to predict the weather changes, but Bumpus challenged him to use his talent for more practical purposes, like foreseeing food shortages. Bumpus believed Giraffe's weather predictions were just guesses and suggested he focus on more useful prophecies. Giraffe fell silent, realizing the wisdom in Bumpus' words. Thad instructed the group to stay close together, hinting at potential trouble ahead. Allan, armed and vigilant, awaited Thad's signal. Thad revealed that rough men occupied the island with a hidden boat and cabin, posing a mystery. Allan and Thad discussed the suspicious activities on the island, with Thad explaining his observations of a motorboat in a secluded cove.

Thad wasn't completely satisfied and decided to search for a cabin on Sturgeon Island, suspecting shady activities. He found it along a trail by the shore, noticing signs of a fire that had been hastily put out. He contemplated eavesdropping but realized it was too risky as he heard movement and muttering inside. Thad eventually left, having gathered some information. He intended to discuss his findings with his friend Allan, believing two heads are better than one. Thad suspected the men on the island were half-breed Canadians from the North Shore, as one spoke French.

The hefty scout shared his misadventure with the group, revealing how his curiosity led him to a confrontation with the lawless men on Sturgeon Island. Despite a scuffle that left him dazed, he managed to keep crucial information about a boat engine crank from the men. With the boat now in their possession, a daring escape plan was hatched. The scout-master commended the risky but clever move, emphasizing the importance of the seized weapon in intimidating the criminals. As they explored the fish house, they discovered clues suggesting it was a temporary storage for illicit activities. The group's focus shifted to securing the crank and outmaneuvering the men before departing the island swiftly.|"['1.

The scout-master skillfully lifted a square cut in the cabin floor, revealing a stone cellar beneath with a ladder. Inside, they found a pit filled with an impressive collection of game fish. Giraffe expressed concern about the overfishing depleting the Great Lakes. Meanwhile, Bumpus, seemingly dazed, began using a fishing line to try and catch a trout from the pit. His friends, including Step Hen, were amused by his antics. As a competition arose between Bumpus and another boy to catch the fish, Thad was asked to judge the fairness of using a hook and line to pull up the fish. Ultimately, they decided to make the fishing more challenging by having someone climb down the ladder to hook the fish for a fairer game.|"['1.

"""We believe in fair play,"" Thad stated seriously to his friends. ""Although the rules may allow it, we aim to be honorable sportsmen. Bumpus, remember our wager with Giraffe. The fish must be alive when hooked and swimming in the lake for it to count."" Bumpus agreed, admitting he was just joking. Giraffe, true to his word, descended into the opening to hook the fish. He sent up a big trout and a white fish, impressing Bumpus with their weight. As they all gathered outside, Allan inspected the catch, while Giraffe fanned himself. Thad explained that the poachers mistook them for militia, but fled upon realizing their mistake. Bumpus, nursing a sore head, was unforgiving, vowing to report the poachers. The boys found Bumpus's lost blanket, suspecting the poachers were hiding in fear at the other end of the island."|"['1.

"""Giraffe, excuse me for saying this,"" called out the scout-master. ""I believe you're not more peculiar than others here."" Step Hen and Davy glared, especially at Bumpus, nicknamed from Cornelius Jasper Hawtree. Thad suggested camping near the boat for safety. ""We can't leave until the sea calms,"" he explained. Disappointed, the tired group hoped to leave Sturgeon Island soon. The boat vanished in the night, presumed lost in the rough waves. Giraffe, cooking fish, joked optimistically. Thad warned fresh fish tastes best on the spot. Giraffe hurriedly ate the last piece, teasing Bumpus. Tired, Giraffe suggested rest, ending the banter. Davy, back to normal, agreed.

Thad mentioned that there was not enough water around to indicate the arrival of a boat. He suspected the men on the island were cooking food. Giraffe, uninterested, preferred to sleep. Thad warned about the need to stay vigilant on the island. An expedition was planned to the poachers' fish stash to gather supplies. Bumpus hesitated due to his past encounters with the poachers. Giraffe was urged to join the expedition. He retrieved a large fish and hinted at a future catch. The group took the engine crank to prevent theft. After securing food supplies, they remained watchful for any enemy activity. Eventually, fatigue overtook most of the scouts, leaving Thad and Allan to guard the camp.|['1.

The night crept slowly towards midnight, and the scouts remained vigilant despite the calm. The boat was secured, and the engine partly dismantled, making the scouts believe the poachers wouldn't attack. Suddenly, a bright flash and a loud crash startled them as the poacher's boat exploded. Amidst the chaos, they speculated that the poachers blew up the boat to trap them on the island. The next morning, their spirits were dampened, but they stayed hopeful. Thad kept watch for a passing vessel to rescue them. Eventually, a motorboat approached, carrying their missing companions, Smithy and Bob White. The scouts signaled for help, relieved that their ordeal was coming to an end.|"[""1.
