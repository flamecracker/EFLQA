At nearly sixty-two years old, I had never planned to write about my life until an injury forced me to stay home. With unexpected financial troubles and failing health, I accepted an offer to write for a magazine for much-needed money. The project became a pleasant distraction. As I delve into these memoirs, my aim is to be fair to all, despite the vastness of the subject. The stories of heroism during the war are numerous, and it's impossible to cover them all. My lineage traces back to Mathew Grant, who settled in America in 1630. Through my ancestors, I have a connection to both sides of the family. Despite health setbacks, I strive to provide an accurate account with the help of my son.|"['1.

My grandfather, Noah, was just nine years old when the Revolutionary War began. He joined the Continental army after the battles of Concord and Lexington. He fought at Bunker Hill and stayed until the end of the war at Yorktown. At times he was on leave, marrying and having two children in Connecticut. He moved to Pennsylvania, then Ohio with his son Peter. After remarrying, he settled in Ohio. My father, Jesse R. Grant, was his second child from a later marriage. Peter Grant, my father's half-brother, was prosperous but tragically drowned. My father learned a trade in Kentucky before setting up a tannery in Ohio. Despite limited schooling, he was a voracious reader and self-taught scholar. He became an expert debater and active in politics, supporting Jackson but remaining a Whig. He admired Henry Clay and served as the first Mayor of Georgetown.|['1.

My mother's family lived in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, for many years. Unfortunately, there is limited information about her ancestors because they did not show interest in genealogy. On the other hand, my father was very enthusiastic about it and discovered an estate in Windsor, Connecticut, that belonged to the family. He found out that his nephew, Lawson Grant, was the rightful heir. In 1832 or 1833, my father successfully claimed the estate for three thousand dollars. My maternal grandfather, John Simpson, moved from Pennsylvania to Ohio in 1819 with his four children. My mother, Hannah Simpson, was the third child and was over twenty years old at the time. Her oldest sister, still living in Clermont County, is over ninety years old. My father, Jesse R. Grant, married Hannah Simpson in June 1821. I was born in April 1822 in Point Pleasant, Ohio, and later moved to Georgetown in 1823. The schools in Georgetown were not advanced, and I did not have access to higher mathematical works like algebra until I went to West Point at seventeen.|"[""1.

When I was young, my father worked hard in leather manufacturing and farming. He valued education and ensured I attended school regularly despite also working on the farm. I began hauling wood at a young age and learned to plough by eleven. I did all the work with horses, tended to animals, and helped with various tasks, all while keeping up with my studies. Despite the hard work, my parents never scolded me and allowed me to enjoy fishing, swimming, and visiting relatives. I even made long journeys alone, showcasing my independence. Once, I traded horses with a neighbor and faced a challenging situation with a new, unruly horse on a trip. Through quick thinking and determination, I safely navigated the situation and completed my journey.|"['1.

During my time at John D. White's school in Georgetown, I learned about the political beliefs of the White family. Mr. White, a Democrat, and his son Chilton White, followed in his political footsteps. Chilton's older brothers, who were also my schoolmates, took different political paths. One brother was a Whig and later a Republican, and the other was a Republican soldier during the rebellion. Chilton once recounted a horse-trade involving me. I was eager to buy a colt from Mr. Ralston and followed my father's instructions on negotiating the price. Despite some heartburn over the transaction, I eventually sold the horse for the same price I had bought him for. My school days were filled with both work and learning, with Mr. White using a beech switch for discipline. Despite the strict school environment, I harbored no ill feelings towards my teacher, as he was well-respected in the community.|"[""1.

During the winter of 1838-9, I was a student in Ripley, near Georgetown. I spent the Christmas break at home where my father received a letter from Senator Thomas Morris about a possible appointment for me. He thought I would be chosen for West Point, a military academy, and I agreed to go if he believed in me. Although I was hesitant due to the high standards, I eventually accepted the appointment. This opportunity not only mended a political rift between my father and Congressman Hamer but also fulfilled my desire to travel.

I traveled extensively before heading to West Point. I journeyed east to Wheeling, Virginia, and north to the Western Reserve in Ohio. I also ventured west to Louisville and south to Bourbon County, Kentucky. The prospect of visiting Philadelphia and New York excited me. However, I hoped for an accident to delay my entry into the Academy. Unfortunately, no mishaps occurred. Georgetown, a democratic town, had a unique history during the rebellion. Despite conflicting loyalties, it produced numerous Union army officers. I embarked on a steamer from Ripley, Ohio, to Pittsburg, enjoying the leisurely journey. The canal ride to Harrisburg provided picturesque views, and the railroad to Philadelphia amazed me with its speed. After exploring Philadelphia and New York, I arrived at West Point in late May and passed the admission exam with ease.|"['1.

During my time at the Military Academy, I found the encampment before academic studies to be dull and tiring. I never intended to stay in the army after graduation, and the thought of being there forever made me uneasy. I didn't engage much with my studies, preferring novels from the Academy library. While I excelled in mathematics, my French was lacking. I hoped for the Academy's abolishment to secure my discharge but later changed my mind. After two years, I enjoyed a furlough with my father in Bethel. The cadets were divided into companies for military exercises, and my promotion to sergeant was overwhelming. General Scott's visit left a lasting impression on me, while President Van Buren's review did not. Despite my early ambitions, my path at the Academy took unexpected turns.|"[""1.

The last two years of my military training passed quickly, feeling much longer than my Ohio years. After passing all exams, we had to choose our service branches. I wanted the cavalry but ended up in the 4th infantry. I was sick, weighing only 117 pounds, with a bad cough. I had to wait for my uniform, choosing between infantry and dragoons. When it finally arrived, I felt embarrassed. A boy mocked me in my uniform, and a stable-man copied my pants in a joke. I reported for duty at Jefferson Barracks, St. Louis, with the 4th United States infantry. The post was under Colonel Steven Kearney, who maintained high discipline without unnecessary rules. Some older officers seemed to enjoy making life difficult for subordinates, but when the Mexican war started, they suddenly found themselves unfit for active duty.|"[""1.

During my time at West Point, I had a classmate and later room-mate, F. T. Dent, whose family lived near Jefferson Barracks. I often visited their estate called White Haven, where I met his family, including his two unmarried brothers and three sisters. One of the sisters, who had been away at a boarding school, returned home in February. Our visits to the neighbors and walks in the area became more frequent and enjoyable. However, my life took a turn in May when the annexation of Texas stirred up heated debates. The 3rd infantry was ordered to Louisiana, and the 4th infantry, including me, was to follow. Unaware of these events, I left for Ohio on a twenty-day leave, only to find out later. Upon my return, I reported for duty at Jefferson Barracks and was granted leave to join my regiment in Louisiana, where I would embark on a new journey.|"['1.

I swiftly obtained a horse and set off to the countryside without any luggage. A small creek, the Gravois, lay between Jefferson Barracks and my destination, lacking bridges in those days. The creek was usually dry, but due to heavy rain, it was now overflowing with a swift current. Despite the challenging situation, I decided not to turn back, a superstition of mine. I plunged into the stream, horse and all, and swam across to the opposite bank, drenched but undeterred. Upon reaching my destination, I borrowed dry clothes and continued my journey. In May 1844, I made a pact with a young lady, which we honored in August 1848. Despite my military duties and the war with Mexico, we maintained a correspondence. My aim was never to remain in the army long but to become a college professor. I had planned to be an assistant professor at West Point, but the outbreak of the Mexican War delayed this ambition. During my time at Jefferson Barracks, I diligently studied mathematics and history, keeping a journal of my readings. Unfortunately, this journal went missing, and I have often worried about its potential discovery and publication.|"['1.

The 3rd infantry chose a campsite at Fort Jessup, between the Red River and the Sabine. They settled at Camp Salubrity, near Natchitoches and Grand Ecore. The camp was on a sandy ridge with cool water springs, away from mosquitoes. The 3rd and 4th regiments were sent to Louisiana to prevent filibustering into Texas and as a threat to Mexico. The annexation of Texas was controversial, with the writer opposing it. Texas, originally part of Mexico, was annexed by the United States in 1845, leading to war. The manner in which the war was forced upon Mexico was unjust. The annexationists aimed to expand slavery territories, leading to the Mexican-American War and the Southern rebellion. Nations face consequences for their actions, as seen in the costly Mexican-American War.|['1.

In May 1844, the 4th infantry camped at Salubrity, awaiting orders. Initially in tents, sheds were added to shield from the summer heat. Officers enjoyed social visits at Fort Jessup, Red River, and Natchitoches. The pleasant interactions between locals and army officers were memorable. With a potential war, hopes of a West Point role faded due to many officers on special duty. As summer ended, huts replaced tents for comfort. The government's cost was minimal. Parties by planters made the winter enjoyable. The annexation of Texas in March 1845 led to anticipation of orders. After a leave to St. Louis, the regiment moved to New Orleans Barracks in July. Yellow fever afflicted the city, with a duel observed, highlighting the culture of dueling, which the narrator opposes.|['1.

At Camp Salubrity, the 4th infantry led by Colonel Vose, an elderly commander, decided to refresh his military skills as war loomed. During a battalion drill at the new post in New Orleans, he unexpectedly collapsed and passed away, likely due to heart disease. The regiment then journeyed to Corpus Christi in Texas by sailing vessels due to shallow waters. The debarkation process was slow, with troops and supplies transferred by small steamers to Shell Island. Once ashore, a commotion erupted on a ship, where the captain, frail and ill, accused sailors of mutiny. The situation was quickly diffused, and I inadvertently fell off the ship but was unharmed. The journey to Corpus Christi was arduous, requiring the steamer to be dragged due to shallow waters, but improvements were later made for smoother transport.|"[""1.

Corpus Christi, a town near the head of the bay bearing the same name, was initially a small Mexican hamlet with fewer than one hundred residents when occupied by United States troops. The town also had an American trading post where goods were sold to Mexican smugglers. The trade primarily involved leaf tobacco, cotton-cloths, and calicoes. Tobacco was a government monopoly, and many Mexicans, including children, smoked cigarettes. The cultivation of tobacco was a significant revenue source for the government. Under Spanish rule, Mexico was restricted from producing items like grapes and olives. The Spaniards adopted tobacco use due to its profitability. After gaining independence, Mexico continued the tobacco tax until it was eventually repealed. Today, citizens can cultivate various crops, and tobacco production has increased while its usage has decreased compared to earlier times.|['1.

"At Corpus Christi, the ""Army of Occupation"" gathered, including seven companies of the 2d regiment of dragoons, four companies of light artillery, and five regiments of infantry—3d, 4th, 5th, 7th, and 8th. General Zachary Taylor led this force of about three thousand men. These soldiers were trained despite being enlisted during peacetime, unlike later volunteers. The army was well-disciplined and prepared for battle. The troops were stationed near Mexican territory but did not provoke any conflict. The army was later moved to the Rio Grande near Matamoras to be in a strategic position. The journey was challenging due to the scarcity of water and lack of civilization along the way. The army had to rely on traders and smugglers for mules and horses to aid their transportation needs, highlighting the complexities of trade and war logistics."|"['1.

Between the Rio Grande and the Nueces rivers, a vast herd of wild horses grazed, as abundant as the buffalo herds to the north before they were nearly wiped out. The Mexicans captured these horses in large numbers, selling them in American settlements. Individual horses could be bought for $8 to $12, while a dozen could be purchased for $36 wholesale. These horses, resembling Norman horses with heavy manes and tails, proved valuable, especially for the army. The preparations for movement took several months, during which the army fulfilled various duties. Small cavalry-escorted trains were sent from Corpus Christi to San Antonio and Austin to pay troops, with officers encouraged to join. The distance from Corpus Christi to San Antonio was around 150 miles, now likely less due to improved roads. The area had sparse settlements, with some living underground for protection against Indians. The region was rich in game like deer and antelope, with wild turkeys and nut-bearing woods near streams. San Antonio had a mixed population of Americans and Mexicans, while Austin had few residences apart from German settlements. The old town of Goliad, once a thriving village, lay in ruins after a massacre by the Mexicans. This history of conflicts provided a backdrop for the ongoing tensions between Texans and Mexicans.|['1.

A couple of weeks before departing Corpus Christi on this journey, I was promoted from brevet second-lieutenant, 4th infantry, to full second-lieutenant, 7th infantry. Frank Gardner, of the 7th, was promoted to the 4th in the same orders. We promptly requested a transfer to return to our original regiments. Upon my return, I learned that our request had been approved in Washington. During my time in the 7th infantry, I served under Captain Holmes, who later became a Lieutenant-general in the Confederate army. Despite not crossing paths during the Civil War, Captain Holmes did not achieve notable success in his high position. My transfer led me to Captain McCall's company, who resigned after the Mexican war and settled in Philadelphia. He later volunteered and rose to the rank of major-general in the Union army during the rebellion. Unfortunately, I did not have the chance to meet him after his resignation. In the old army, Captain McCall was highly regarded as both a soldier and a gentleman, and our interactions were always pleasant.|"[""1.

During the war, foreign soldiers in our cities enlisted as teamsters, although most had no experience driving mule-teams. Each wagon had five mules, carefully selected for color and appearance. Teamsters, with assistants, harnessed the mules, using ropes with slip nooses for control. The mules, resisting at first, were eventually trained to work together. Mexican mules were especially challenging, requiring lassos for capture if they got loose. One mule, after working under the saddle, escaped and could only be caught by a Mexican with a lasso. Regulations allowed for replacing lost mules. While stationed in Corpus Christi, officers kept horses for riding, which were low-cost and self-sufficient. Unfortunately, an accident caused all of Grant's horses to run away, leading to a humorous misunderstanding about their value.|"['1.

General Taylor's army, with about three thousand men, prepared to advance on March 8th. Some troops and artillery were sent by water, while the rest, around twenty-five hundred men, were divided into three brigades. The cavalry operated independently. Colonel Twiggs led the dragoons and artillery first, followed by the infantry brigades with a day between each. General Taylor emphasized respect for civilians and fair payment for supplies. Officers with horses were allowed to ride if it didn't hinder their duties. Grant, belonging to a foot regiment, intended to march on foot but was given a horse by Captain McCall to ensure he didn't walk while his servant rode. Grant broke in the horse, which had been recently captured from a wild herd. The vastness of the wild horse herd in Texas was awe-inspiring, stretching as far as the eye could see in every direction.|"[""1. What was General Taylor's army's plan for advancing on March 8th?\nA.

At the point where the army reached the Little Colorado River, the stream was broad and deep enough for boats. The water was salty, and the banks had trees. The whole army gathered here before trying to cross. They didn't have pontoon bridges, and the soldiers didn't know how to build one. To make things worse, they faced opposition for the first time. Buglers on the other side signaled, making it seem like there were many of them. A few cavalrymen crossed the river, and the opposition quickly disappeared. The troops waded through the water, and wagons were pulled across using ropes. By mid-March, the army camped near the Rio Grande, opposite Matamoras. They started building a fort. The Mexicans got angry and attacked, capturing some soldiers. The fort was finished just in time as supplies were running low. The 7th infantry garrisoned the fort, and the rest of the army moved on to Point Isabel.|['1.

General Taylor, leading his army back to the besieged garrison, faced a formidable Mexican force at Palo Alto on May 8th. The Mexican army, mostly cavalry armed with lances, outnumbered Taylor's troops. As the two armies lined up for battle, the Mexican weapons glistened in the sunlight. Taylor strategically placed his artillery along the line and formed a reserve battalion. Men were sent to fill their canteens before the advance. When the command to move forward was given, Mexican artillery and infantry fired upon them. Despite cannonballs flying through the ranks, the slow speed allowed the men to dodge them. As the battle intensified, both sides engaged in combat, with General Taylor feeling the weight of responsibility commanding his troops in the face of danger.|"['1.

General Taylor's infantry was equipped with flint-lock muskets and paper cartridges filled with powder, buck-shot, and ball. The artillery included six-pounder brass guns firing solid shot, along with twelve-pounder howitzers launching shells. The Mexican forces had similar infantry armaments but lacked the artillery variety of the American troops. During the battle, the artillery advanced, with the infantry observing the impact of their shots. The eighteen-pounders and howitzers proved effective. Despite the loss of Major Ringgold and Lieutenant Luther, the American casualties were relatively low. The following day, the enemy had retreated, leaving behind dense chaparral. Captain Smith and Captain McCall led scouting missions, encountering Mexican forces near the ponds at Resaca. A long-range engagement ensued, prompting the American army's advance. Captain McCall's company navigated the dense terrain, facing enemy fire before strategically withdrawing to find better positioning.|"[""1.

"By now, progress had been made on our left. The cavalry had captured a section of artillery and taken some prisoners. The Mexican forces were retreating, likely leaving early. Eventually, I found a clear space between two ponds. Spotting a few men ahead, my company charged, meeting no resistance. We captured a wounded Mexican colonel and a few men. As I sent them back with a small guard, a private returned with one of our badly injured officers. Reflecting on the battle, I realized our victory at Resaca de la Palma would have been secured even without my presence.

General Taylor, a colonel in rank, was given the duty by the President as a brigadier-general due to his brevet rank. General Worth, not granted the same rank, likely received pay based on his division command. When the query was sent to Washington, it was too late, and General Worth resigned, missing the battles at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. However, he returned for the Battle of Monterey. General Taylor wore his uniform to greet a naval officer, who opted for civilian attire, leading to an awkward meeting. The troops waited at Matamoras, where pillaging was forbidden, fostering good relations. Among the reinforcements was an Ohio regiment led by Thomas L. Hamer, who passed away before Monterey. General Taylor's route to Mexico through Monterey was strategic.|"['1.

On August 19th, the army left Matamoras for Monterey, leaving a small garrison behind. Most troops traveled by steamers to Camargo, with exceptions for artillery and cavalry. Lieutenant-Colonel Garland led the march, realizing that daytime marches in August were harsh. They switched to night marches with success. Upon reaching Camargo, a tent city awaited. I was assigned as quartermaster and commissary. The army lacked enough men to handle the pack mules efficiently, requiring Mexican assistance. Each morning, preparations took hours, and mules often caused chaos. The army advanced from Camargo on September 5th, divided into four columns. By the 13th, the rear-guard caught up, and the advance resumed. The army camped near Monterey, facing formidable defenses. Monterey was well-protected, with forts, hills, and a stream guarding its approaches. General Taylor's army was ready for the challenge.|"['1.

General Taylor had a force of about six thousand five hundred soldiers, split into three divisions led by Generals Butler, Twiggs, and Worth. The troops set up camp at Walnut Springs while Major Mansfield, along with engineer officers, began surveying the area. Major Mansfield discovered a way to outmaneuver the enemy's Black Fort and works on the hills to the north-west by securing the Saltillo road. General Worth, reinforced, was tasked with seizing the Saltillo road and the outer works to the city's north-west. His division's march began on the 20th afternoon, supported by Generals Butler and Twiggs threatening the city's east and north sides. General Worth's advance was considered the main assault on Monterey, with other actions backing it. That night, General Worth reached a defensible position near the city, and a battery was set up to target Black Fort. The 4th infantry supported the artillery. The next morning, a fierce exchange of fire ensued. A charge was ordered, resulting in heavy casualties. The infantry retreated eastward to safety, with some soldiers mounting horses. The regiment reorganized, and Grant, who had been a quartermaster, took on the role of adjutant after the previous adjutant was killed.|"[""1.

Lieutenant-Colonel Garland's brigade received orders to charge the lower batteries of the city, creating a diversion for General Worth. Garland could have led his men beyond Black Fort's fire range, advancing towards the northeast city angle. Meanwhile, Quitman's brigade reached the eastern city end, under house cover with minimal losses. Garland's brigade, with some troops on house-tops, captured a battery at the lower city end. General Worth took the Saltillo road, capturing forts on both heights, securing the upper west end. On the 23rd, the U.S. troops held the east end undisputedly. Twiggs's division was well-covered but faced artillery commanding streets to the plaza. The 3rd and 4th infantry regiments advanced with heavy losses towards the plaza.

During the Mexican war, a sentry was spotted guarding a house filled with wounded American officers and soldiers. Upon entering, Captain Williams and Lieutenant Territt were found severely injured. After promising to report their condition, the narrator left to rejoin the troops. Meanwhile, General Worth advanced towards the plaza from the opposite end through houses, reaching a surrender agreement with the Mexican commander. The Mexican garrison marched out as prisoners, evoking pity from the narrator. Following the surrender, a peaceful camp life ensued until midwinter, with the Mexican people showing goodwill towards the American forces. The war was politically motivated, with General Scott's command being influenced by party politics. Despite the challenges, the American forces achieved significant victories under various commanders during the conflict.|"['1.

The leadership faced a challenging dilemma. Engaged in a war that needed success for political goals, the administration lacked officers from their party. The chosen general, once uninterested in politics, now eyed the presidency. To thwart his ambitions without losing ground, the administration aimed to discredit him. General Scott, against expanding conquest, withdrew forces from Taylor. Despite disagreements, Taylor's victory at Buena Vista propelled his presidential nomination. Meanwhile, General Scott's command faced logistical challenges and a restless division under General Worth. Despite Worth's hasty tactics, his fighting prowess earned respect. The troops prepared to move towards Vera Cruz, highlighting the complexities of military leadership and strategy during the Mexican-American War.|"['1.

The army camped on the sand beach near the Rio Grande mouth, waiting for ships to transport them to their new mission. The voyage was long and uncomfortable, enduring over thirty days at sea. The sailing vessels lacked proper passenger accommodations, making the journey even more challenging. The fleet gathered at Anton Lizardo, south of Vera Cruz, awaiting supplies and artillery. A steam propeller boat amazed the troops, a rare sight in those days. On March 7, 1847, the army of ten to twelve thousand landed near Vera Cruz. The debarkation was slow due to high waves, but with Mexican assistance, they managed to land. The army quickly surrounded Vera Cruz, leading to its surrender on March 29. The victory resulted in thousands of prisoners and artillery captured. Casualties on their side amounted to sixty-four.|['1.

General Scott had a small army of less than twelve thousand men at Vera Cruz. Despite promises of more troops, he had to march two hundred and sixty miles to besiege Mexico City with a population of over one hundred thousand. The mountainous terrain made the advance challenging, with only two roads available. Escaping the deadly yellow fever was crucial, so the army had to move quickly to Jalapa, sixty-five miles inland. Three divisions, under Generals Twiggs, Patterson, and Worth, set out. Twiggs encountered the enemy at Cerro Gordo, where Santa Anna's forces were well fortified. With the help of skilled engineers like Robert E. Lee and future famous generals, a new route was found to flank the enemy. General Scott ordered the attack for the 18th of April.|"[""1.

The battle unfolded as planned, and it was a rare occasion when orders given before a fight accurately matched the actual events that followed. Skilled engineers had created pathways over steep cliffs to the right, almost too steep for men to scale and impossible for animals. These paths were cleverly constructed under the cover of night, escaping the notice of the enemy. The engineers led the way, followed by the troops. Artillery was carefully lowered down the steep slopes by hand, with soldiers securing ropes to the rear axle and guiding the guns down gradually. The troops then ascended the opposite slopes in a similar manner. This strategic approach allowed Scott's forces to reach a key position behind most of the enemy's defenses without detection. The subsequent attack led to Mexican reserves retreating and surrendering. The battle of Buena Vista marked a pivotal moment in General Scott's campaign, securing thousands of prisoners and a significant amount of enemy supplies. The victory at Buena Vista set the stage for further successes in the Mexican war.|"[""1.

In early May, General Worth led his division from Perote to Puebla. The roads were wide, except for a mountain pass from the south. Despite this, the column split into two groups, a day apart. While resting in Amozoque, near Puebla, enemy cavalry was spotted nearby. General Worth swiftly sent troops to confront them, making them retreat. On May 15th, they entered Puebla. General Worth's command was brief but eventful, with enemy forces nearby. After General Scott arrived, the situation calmed. General Worth's restlessness under pressure was evident as he moved troops around the city. Later, General Scott's arrival brought stability. The troops faced delays due to Congress authorizing troop creation. General Scott's advance on Mexico began in August with divisions led by Generals Twiggs, Worth, Pillow, and Quitman. Twiggs's division led the march, with the others following a day apart for easier concentration. General Taylor and General Scott had contrasting leadership styles in battle, with General Taylor favoring comfort and informality, while General Scott was more formal and precise in his commands.|"[""1.

In their ways of communicating ideas, the two generals differed greatly. General Scott was known for his precise and cultivated language, often speaking about himself in the third person and using elaborate rhetoric. He was comfortable praising others without hesitation. On the other hand, General Taylor was not talkative but excelled in expressing himself clearly in writing, using simple yet effective language without unnecessary embellishments. Despite their contrasting styles, both generals were respected for their military prowess, patriotism, and integrity. They were both considered great and successful leaders. The army's journey from Puebla to the City of Mexico took them over Rio Frio mountain, with the road reaching an elevation of about eleven thousand feet above sea level. The route was not heavily defended, allowing the advanced division to reach the summit in three days. The City of Mexico, located west of Rio Frio mountain, is surrounded by lakes and mountains. General Scott prepared deliberate plans based on his staff officers' insights, while General Taylor made decisions on the spot to address immediate needs. Scott's army concentrated near Lake Chalco, exploring routes to flank the city from the south and southwest. By August 18th, troops were positioned close to the capital, navigating challenging terrains like El Penon and volcanic rocks near Contreras. Garland's brigade faced San Antonio, encountering obstacles like deep ditches and the Pedregal volcanic rock that hindered movement. General Scott ordered a cautious approach, awaiting further instructions before engaging the enemy's fortified positions.|"['1.

On the 18th of August, Garland's brigade reached San Augustin Tlalpam. They positioned close to the intrenchments of San Antonio, shielded by a built embankment. General Scott's engineers scouted Contreras' works on the 19th to plan an assault. The natural barriers of Pedregal and the mountain made flanking difficult. Despite this, a road was quickly constructed to position troops. The assault on Contreras began on the 20th, resulting in a swift victory with many prisoners captured. Garland's brigade observed the progress and movement of troops. Clarke's brigade engaged at Churubusco, leading to a severe battle. Shields' brigades were pivotal in turning the enemy's right flank. General Scott's strategic decisions and the engineer officers' reconnaissances were crucial. The demoralized enemy retreated, allowing for potential entry into Mexico City.

General Franklin Pierce had recently joined the army in Mexico at Puebla, just before the attack on the capital began. He hadn't participated in any battles until the fight at Contreras. Unfortunately, he fell from his horse on the 19th, sustaining painful injuries. The following day, when his brigade was ordered to engage the enemy, he tried to join but was too injured and fainted. Criticisms arose unfairly when he later ran for President. Despite his qualifications, General Pierce was a brave gentleman. Negotiations for peace with Mexico were led by Mr. Nicholas P. Trist, and the troops didn't enter the city then to aid the peace talks. Negotiations continued until September 2nd when Mr. Trist presented his terms, including Mexico ceding Texas, New Mexico, and California to the United States. The Mexicans felt the terms were unjust, and preparations for defense began. General Scott declared the armistice over after Mexico violated the truce.|"[""1.

The City of Mexico is supplied with water by two aqueducts on stone arches. One aqueduct starts from Molino del Rey, runs north near Chapultepec, and then east into the city. The second aqueduct begins at the east base of Chapultepec, fed by a spring, and runs northeast to the city. Both aqueducts run along broad roads. The arches supporting them also served as defenses. The roads leading to the city gates were fortified with water-filled ditches. In September 1847, General Scott entered Mexico City through these routes. Before the Mexican war, General Scott and General Worth had a falling out, but Scott tried to reconcile by giving Worth control of the battle of Molino del Rey. The battle was fought on September 8th, resulting in a victory that could have led to capturing Chapultepec if promptly followed up.|['1.

I was among the first troops to enter the Mills. As we moved towards Chapultepec, I noticed armed Mexicans on the building's top near our men. Without a clear way up, I improvised a ladder with a cart. Climbing to the roof, I found Mexican officers and a major, still armed. With a soldier, I disarmed them and disabled their muskets. After securing Molino del Rey, the troops returned to Tacubaya. The next day, batteries were set up to bombard Chapultepec. General Scott assigned the capture to General Pillow, who led two columns of 250 volunteers each. The assault was bloody but successful. Looking back, the battles seemed unnecessary. A different route could have been taken to avoid Molino del Rey and Chapultepec. General Quitman and General Worth led the assaults on Belen and San Cosme.

To the west of our position, there was a house at the corner where the San Cosme road met the road we were on. This house was surrounded by a stone wall that extended along both roads, enclosing a yard around the house. I seized an opportunity to cross the road and hide behind the south wall. After cautiously making my way to the west corner of the yard, I signaled for volunteers. About a dozen soldiers joined me. We crossed the road and took cover behind the wall before the enemy could spot us. From there, we closely monitored the enemy's movements and fired at them when they appeared. With Captain Brooks's company joining us, we advanced towards the city, causing the enemy to retreat. Later, I discovered a church south of the road with a belfry that offered a strategic advantage.

During the Mexican War, General Worth noticed the effectiveness of a howitzer in a church steeple. Lieutenant Pemberton was sent to bring the officer in charge, who was a second lieutenant. General Worth praised their service and ordered another howitzer to be placed, not knowing there was no room. That night, troops under General Worth stayed near San Cosme, while others were cutting passage-ways towards the city. Santa Anna and his army left the city, freeing convicts who later fired on the troops. General Scott declined an armistice but assured protection to those who behaved. The next day, troops cautiously entered the city, facing gunfire from convicts and hostile citizens. Despite casualties, lawlessness was suppressed, and the City of Mexico became peaceful.

In this story, I mentioned that the plain extends from the east of Perote to the cities of Puebla and Mexico. The army's route to Puebla goes over a pass in a mountain spur from the south, easily defensible by a smaller force. The highest point between Vera Cruz and Mexico City is Rio Frio mountain, also defensible. By moving north of the mountains, these passes could be avoided. The road from Perote to Mexico City is flat, like the prairies in the West. Approaching Puebla from the north, troops could have taken the city and then moved west without encountering mountains until reaching Mexico City. It seems that this northern route would have been better. General Scott's successes in the Mexican war show the importance of strategy in winning battles, even against larger forces.|"[""1.

The Mexican army in the past was not well-organized. Soldiers were often taken from the lower class without their consent, poorly treated, and left without pay. However, despite these conditions, many soldiers showed great bravery. Today, Mexico has a well-trained military with educated officers and a standing army larger than the United States. They even have a military school like West Point. While Mexico celebrates victories like Chapultepec and Molino del Rey, the truth is sometimes exaggerated. The Mexican officers lacked experience, which led to their defeat in the Mexican-American war. Despite this, the Mexican people show great patriotism. In contrast, in the United States, some writers try to diminish the Union's victories. It's essential to write truthful history that acknowledges the courage and endurance of all American citizens, regardless of their background or which side they fought for.|"['1.

In February 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed, ending the war between the United States and Mexico. The treaty secured the Rio Grande as Texas' boundary and included New Mexico and Upper California in the US for $15,000,000. General Scott faced opposition from some officers, leading to a court inquiry. Eventually, he was relieved of his command, and General Butler took over. Despite some viewing the treatment of General Scott as unfair, he left the country and had little command until 1861. The treaty had to go through approval processes, delaying the return of soldiers. Meanwhile, bullfights were held for entertainment, though Grant found them distressing, questioning the enjoyment of such events.|"['1.

In the past, bullfights were a popular sport in Mexico, with bulls being sacrificed and men armed with sharp spears and explosives tormenting the animals. The bull would become frantic from the pain and explosions, charging at horsemen and men with red flags. Matadores armed with long knives would then enter to kill the bull. The cruelty of the event often led to injuries and deaths among the animals and participants. Bullfights are now banned in Mexico City and other parts of the country due to the inhumane treatment of the animals. Another common pastime was Monte playing, where people of all ages and backgrounds would gamble with coins and even entire estates. These activities are no longer allowed, as they were deemed cruel and harmful.|['1.

"In the winter of 1847-8, while stationed in Tacubaya, I was kept busy as the regimental quartermaster and commissary. General Scott faced challenges in getting clothing for the troops from the North, so I had to ensure the men were provided for. I purchased materials for ""Yankee uniforms"" and supervised their production. The regimental fund had run low, leaving some musicians without their extra pay. To address this, I rented a bakery, hired bakers, and secured a contract to bake hard bread, generating more funds than my pay during the entire war. In 1848, I joined a group of officers to visit Popocatapetl, the highest volcano in America. Our journey included navigating hazardous mountain roads and encountering wild cattle descendants. Despite a mule accident, we were amazed to see it return unharmed."|"[""1.

One night at the Vaqueria was extremely unpleasant. It was cold, with heavy rain turning into snow as we climbed higher. The wind was fierce, and our log-cabin was barely holding up, causing a sleepless night. The next morning, we attempted to reach the summit despite the violent wind and cloudy weather. The wind carried snow around us, making it difficult to progress. Eventually, we decided to descend due to the storm. The journey back was rapid but perilous until we reached lower ground. After experiencing excruciating eye pain from the snow, we bathed our eyes in cold water. By the next morning, the pain had vanished, and we continued our journey. Some of the group decided to attempt the ascent again, while others opted to explore the great caves of Mexico instead.|['1.

Our group journeyed south from Ameca Ameca to Cuantla, a town about forty miles away. The descent in elevation led us from a temperate climate where common cereals and fruits grow, to a tropical climate with flourishing orange, banana, coffee, and sugar-cane crops. Unaware of the armistice limits set after the capture of Mexico City, bugles sounded as we approached Cuantla, and soldiers rushed towards us. Using a white handkerchief as a flag of truce, I proceeded to the town with Captains Sibley and Porter following closely. Despite being reminded of the truce violation, we were allowed to stay the night in a vacant house with the promise of a guide to Cuernavaca the next day. Our journey continued towards the great caves of Mexico, but we faced obstacles due to the armistice terms. After multiple delays and miscommunications, we decided to proceed unless stopped by a compelling force.|['1.

After traveling for a few hours, we arrived at a town where a scene similar to the one at Cuantia unfolded. The officer in charge sent a guide to show us around the village and lead us back on our journey. That night, we stayed at a vast coffee plantation about eight miles from the cave we planned to explore. It seemed to be a Saturday night as the laborers had been paid and spent the evening gambling with their meager earnings. Despite playing with mostly copper coins, their excitement was palpable. I recall one man who, after losing everything, even wagered his shirt in a game of Monte. The following morning, equipped with guides, candles, and rockets, we reached the cave entrance early. As we ventured about three miles inside, we encountered grand chambers adorned with stunning stalactites and stalagmites. The columns formed by these mineral deposits were awe-inspiring, some already resembling immense pillars. While exploring, some of our group inadvertently strayed off the usual path, only to be reunited later with the rest of the party. This experience during the Mexican war proved invaluable later on. The war not only imparted practical lessons but also brought together officers from the regular army and volunteers, many of whom would serve in the Civil War. Personally, having attended West Point at a time when future Civil War generals were cadets, I gained insight into their characters.

The peace treaty was finally approved, and the United States troops were ordered to leave Mexico. In early June, the troops in Mexico City started to depart. Many were gathered in Jalapa to wait for ships in Vera Cruz. Despite precautions, soldiers camped on the beach in the scorching July sun before embarking. The fever was severe in Vera Cruz, close by. My regiment was sent to Pascagoula, Mississippi, for the summer. I took a four-month leave and got married in St. Louis. After visiting family in Ohio, I went to Sackett's Harbor, New York. Later, I was stationed in Detroit, Michigan, where the state constitution was ratified. Mrs. Grant stayed with family while I sailed to the Pacific Coast with the 4th infantry. We sailed from New York on the steamer Ohio, arriving in Aspinwall after eight days.

As the quartermaster, I was responsible for the public property and organizing transportation for the regiment. A deal was made with a steamship company in New York for our journey to California, including crossing the Isthmus. Each man had a set amount of baggage, and officers and disabled individuals were provided saddle animals. Most of the regiment traveled by boat to Gorgona, then marched to Panama to board a steamer in the bay. I led a group to Cruces, where we faced challenges with the contracted transportation. The contractor failed to provide mules as promised due to high demand and cholera outbreak. Eventually, I had to make a new deal with a local at a higher cost. After delays and losses, we all finally made it to Panama. One lieutenant, Slaughter, had a humorous struggle with sea-sickness on multiple trips to California, regretting not joining the navy.

During my time on the Pacific coast, Indian wars were not a concern. Tribes near Portland, Oregon, and Fort Vancouver, Washington, had remnants. These tribes had picked up some bad habits from civilization but lacked its good qualities, except for a few individuals. The Hudson's Bay Company had trading posts in the North-west long before the United States had a presence on the Pacific coast. They had posts along the Columbia River and at Fort Vancouver. They treated the Indians well, teaching them farming and animal husbandry. The Indians were paid fairly for their work with goods of consistent quality and price. Before Americans arrived, pelts were used for trade, later replaced by silver coins. Diseases like measles and smallpox, brought by the white settlers, ravaged the Indian populations. The Indians had traditional steam baths to treat ailments, but these were ineffective against the new diseases.|"[""1.

During my time on the Columbia River, a deadly disease, smallpox, wiped out a small group of Native Americans and severely affected others. Recovery was rare until a doctor from the Hudson Bay Company intervened, setting up a hospital that saw a high rate of successful treatments. Although I didn't witness the medical care myself, I heard detailed accounts from those who did. The devastation among the Native Americans was evident, and the hospital, situated close to where I lived, was a Hudson's Bay building. A significant event in my life occurred when the passing of Colonel Bliss led to my promotion to captaincy in Humboldt Bay, California. To reach my new post, I had to board a sailing ship bound for San Francisco, where the bustling city had expanded rapidly since my last visit. The city had extended into the bay, with new streets and houses built on stilts over the water. San Francisco remained a hub of activity, with numerous establishments for eating, drinking, and gambling lining the streets, especially near the waterfront. Gambling was not limited to card games but also extended to speculation in city lots, leading to a booming real estate market. The city's growth saw the transformation of sand hills into prime real estate, with lots fetching exorbitant prices. The construction of more permanent structures over the bay marked the city's progress, with former temporary dwellings giving way to solid buildings.

In 1854, I reunited with my family in the East, now including a son born while I was away. Struggling to support them as an army officer on the Pacific coast, I decided to resign. Despite plans to settle there, a promotion dashed those hopes. Returning to St. Louis, we faced financial challenges. I toiled hard, even selling wood in town. Battling illness, I eventually gave up farming and ventured into real estate. While in St. Louis, I ran for county engineer but lost. Subsequently, I moved to Galena, Illinois, working in my father's store. My political views evolved during this time, aligning with the emerging Republican Party.

During my time with the American party, I believed in equal rights for all native-born citizens. However, I came to understand the dangers of secret political groups that oppose freedom of thought and worship. As tensions rose in the Presidential election of 1856, the Republican party's stance on slavery caused fear of secession and rebellion. I voted for James Buchanan to prevent immediate conflict, hoping for a peaceful resolution. Four years later, the Republican victory led to the emancipation of four million slaves and the expansion of civil rights. In Galena, I worked as a clerk, supporting my family while my brother managed our business. Sadly, he passed away in 1861, leaving me to take on more responsibilities.|"['1.

"During my time in Galena, I focused on my work and had few friends beyond customers and colleagues. When the election of 1860 came, I couldn't vote due to my recent move to Illinois. I was relieved as my pledge would have forced me to vote for Douglas, who had no chance. The real race was between Breckinridge and Lincoln, representing minority and majority rule. I preferred Lincoln. Excitement filled the air with torch-light parades. I didn't march but supervised drills for the Republicans. The election of Lincoln was predicted to trigger Southern secession. I hoped the South would reconsider, but they didn't. The South's threat to secede over slavery was debated. It was believed secession would be limited and short-lived. The right of revolution is inherent, but secession was illogical and impractical. The South's cry was, ""Let us alone,"" claiming constitutional protection. The North had to enforce the constitution strictly. War ensued due to a situation the constitution did not anticipate."|"['1.

The framers of the constitution were wise in their time, aiming to secure liberty for themselves and future generations. They understood that rules of government should not be rigidly set for unforeseen circumstances. Back then, only water and wind currents were harnessed for labor, with no thought of electricity's power. The material and immaterial worlds had transformed greatly since then. The fathers of the nation would have accepted the need for change under such different circumstances. During the winter of 1860-1, I traveled through the Northwest and discussed the future with locals, believing the war would end quickly. The prevailing sentiment in the South against secession could have been different with fair discussion. The South was influenced by demagogues, leading to the belief that separation was necessary. Many Southern voters, who did not own slaves, were swayed by those in power. They too needed liberation. The control over public affairs in the South was firm, with a class feeling entitled to dominance.|['1. What did the framers of the constitution understand about rules of government?\nA.

In the mid-19th century, the United States was deeply divided over the issue of slavery. The Southern states, where slavery was profitable, were staunch defenders of the institution. When Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860, South Carolina seceded from the Union, sparking a chain reaction with other Southern states following suit. The winter of 1860-61 was marked by tension and secessionist movements. While some slave states like Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri remained in the Union, they were represented in the Confederate Congress. The Southern slave-owners believed in the divine right to govern due to their ownership of slaves. President Buchanan's administration was ineffective in preventing the looming conflict, with some members of his cabinet actively supporting secession. The stage was set for the Civil War, with the South seceding and establishing its own government, led by Jefferson Davis.|"['1.

During the challenging winter of 1860-1, when the South was staunchly against any dissenting opinions, it took immense bravery to express loyalty to the Union. Meanwhile, influential Northerners claimed the government lacked the authority to compel the South to obey laws. As the President-elect journeyed to his inauguration, threats were so severe that he had to travel covertly. Abraham Lincoln was sworn in on March 4, 1861, just as states began seceding. The firing on Fort Sumter led to Lincoln's call for 75,000 troops, met with swift response. In Galena, citizens united in a meeting, setting aside political differences to support the Union. Volunteers enlisted, forming a company promptly. The events marked the beginning of a tumultuous period in American history.|"['1.

The women in Galena were just as patriotic as the men during the war. Although they couldn't join the military, they decided to outfit their first company in full uniform. They sought my help to describe the U.S. infantry uniform, bought the materials, and sewed the garments themselves. Within days, the company was fully uniformed and ready for duty. I then trained the men in drills and accompanied them to Springfield for assignment. The governor, Richard Yates, faced a challenge with the surplus of volunteers. The legislature passed a law allowing ten additional regiments to serve for a month, paid by the state but ready to join the U.S. if needed.

At dusk, the defenders of Camp Jackson were captured and held as prisoners at the St. Louis arsenal. The following day, I departed for Mattoon, Illinois, to enlist the 21st Illinois infantry, a regiment I later led as colonel. My State duties nearing an end, I mustered another regiment. Brigadier-General John Pope, a native of Illinois, oversaw the mustering at Springfield during my time in service. I met few prominent figures, mainly the governor and Senator S. A. Douglas. Despite my military background, I hesitated to seek high rank. General Townsend later found a letter I wrote offering my services for the war effort, which had been misplaced.

General Logan focused on recruiting troops in his area and soon the same people causing trouble became defenders of the Union. Logan started as a colonel but quickly rose to major-general. His district, initially troublesome, supplied troops without needing a draft. They always had more volunteers than required. When ordered to Quincy, Illinois, the regiment marched there as there was no transport for their gear. After crossing the Illinois River, they were redirected to Ironton, Missouri, to aid a regiment under siege. Grant, with his son Fred, headed to Quincy by rail. Despite initial anxiety, the situation at Quincy calmed down, and they later moved to Palmyra and then to Salt River to rebuild a bridge destroyed by the enemy.

During a military movement in Missouri, General Pope assigned me to lead a regiment in the town of Mexico. As we prepared to relocate, the deserted houses and empty roads made me uneasy. We marched without encountering anyone until we reached a creek bottom where Colonel Harris had been camped. Expecting a confrontation, my anxiety peaked. However, we found his camp abandoned, realizing he had fled upon hearing of our approach. This incident taught me that both sides can fear each other in war. Despite subsequent encounters with enemies, I never felt the same level of apprehension. Upon returning to Salt River bridge, the locals, initially fearful, welcomed us back.

Upon my arrival in Mexico, I noticed a lack of discipline among some regiments. Soldiers entered houses without permission, taking food and drink or demanding them. They carried muskets outside camp, forcing oaths of allegiance. I issued orders against these actions, ensuring respect for private property. The citizens of Mexico welcomed me warmly. My regiment had limited training until then, but now I seized the chance to drill them in battalion formations. I studied new tactics diligently, finding them more practical and efficient. With my regiment camped outside town, I adapted the drills to the surroundings. My appointment as brigadier-general came as a surprise, but I selected competent aides, including Lieutenant Lagow and John Rawlins, who displayed unwavering dedication to the service.|"['1.

During the Civil War, General Rawlins served as my chief-of-staff and proved to be a valuable and firm officer. He rose to the rank of brigadier general and remained loyal until his death. After being promoted, I was assigned to command a district in Ironton, Missouri. Upon my arrival, I found the troops demoralized and poorly equipped. I quickly took charge, sending the men home and preparing to face the Confederate troops at Greenville. However, my plans were interrupted when General B. M. Prentiss arrived with orders to take command. Knowing my seniority, I briefed him and left for St. Louis. Subsequently, I was ordered to Jefferson City to deal with the threat posed by General Sterling Price. The troops there were in disarray, with volunteers enlisted under varying conditions.

General Prentiss made a significant mistake during a past event, which affected his career later in the war. I regretted this mistake upon getting to know him better. Due to this error, he was off duty during a crucial campaign in the West, causing his juniors to receive promotions while he couldn't. He would have ranked next to me in south-east Missouri due to his service in the Mexican war. He was a brave and dedicated soldier, devoted to our cause. Upon moving my headquarters to Cairo, I encountered Colonel Richard Oglesby, whom I had never met. Despite being in civilian attire, I assumed command of the district, surprising the Colonel. Upon receiving intelligence of enemy movements towards Paducah, we swiftly organized a mission, reaching the town before the enemy, averting a potential threat.

The government of Kentucky at that time wanted to remain neutral between the North and the South. The rebels held towns in Kentucky, but the governor believed in the state's right to stay neutral. Even as National troops entered Paducah, Confederate troops were moving in. The governor and the majority of the legislature supported the actions taken. General Fremont arranged prisoner exchanges, and I was reprimanded for corresponding with the legislature. I had a large force by November, ready for action. General Fremont moved against General Sterling Price in Missouri, and I was directed to make a demonstration to keep the rebels in Columbus. I sent troops to prevent rebel reinforcements from reaching Price. I also ordered troops to move towards Columbus from different directions.

When I left Cairo, I did not plan to attack the National troops, but my soldiers were eager to fight for their country. I decided we couldn't return without trying. We couldn't attack the well-defended Columbus, so we moved to Belmont. We landed quietly on the west bank of the Mississippi and surprised the enemy. The ground was marshy and wooded, but we pushed forward. After a fierce four-hour skirmish, we forced the enemy back to their camp. Unfortunately, our troops got carried away with victory and failed to capture the camp. Despite this, our soldiers performed bravely in their first battle. The enemy retreated hastily, allowing us to enter their camp easily. Our officers and men celebrated the Union's success, picking up trophies and praising our cause.|"[""1.

During the battle, our troops were engaged for four hours while the enemy remained hidden under the river bank. They eventually emerged between us and our ships. As we noticed two steamers approaching with soldiers on board, some of our men fired at empty vessels down the river. Despite my attempts to redirect their fire towards the loaded steamers, they continued. To distract the enemy, I ordered our camps to be set on fire, prompting return fire from the enemy's guns. When the enemy troops were spotted between us and our ships, the alarm was raised. Despite feeling surrounded, I reassured our officers that we could cut our way out. We encountered the enemy again on our retreat, but their resistance was weak. We hurried back to our boats, leaving the Confederates behind as more enemy troops approached. Our wounded were taken to the boats, and I found our guard post abandoned. Realizing the enemy was near, I rode out alone to scout, encountering enemy troops up close before hastily returning to the safety of our boats.|['1.

The battle of Belmont in 1861 was a significant event during the Civil War. As the enemy attacked our transports near a dense forest, our men quickly boarded the boats. I found myself the only National army soldier between the rebels and our vessels. With the Mississippi River's banks steep and my horse understanding the urgency, we managed to board a boat safely. Despite the rebels' fire, only a few were wounded. Our gunboats retaliated effectively, causing heavy losses to the enemy. The battle achieved its objectives, halting the enemy's plans and boosting the troops' confidence. Belmont left a lasting impact, with many families mourning their losses. This victory instilled a sense of pride and determination in our soldiers that lasted throughout the war.|"[""1.

The day after the battle, I met officers from General Polk's command. We arranged to bury our dead at Belmont and started negotiations for prisoner exchanges. When our men went to bury the dead, they were escorted below where the enemy had engaged our transports. Some officers wanted to see the field, but were denied as we had no casualties there. While on the truce-boat, I spoke to an officer from General Polk's staff. He recalled seeing me in a cornfield near their troops, where Polk had allowed his men to target me, but no shots were fired. Belmont was criticized in the North as an unnecessary battle. At Cairo, I interacted with rebel officers from Columbus garrison under flags of truce. The South had an advantage with educated soldiers, while the North retained trained soldiers in the regular army. Major-General H. W. Halleck replaced General Fremont in command of the Department of the Missouri after the battle of Belmont.|"[""1.

The foe held a fortified line from the Mississippi River at Columbus to Bowling Green and Mill Springs, Kentucky. Points on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers were also heavily fortified. Fort Heiman and Fort Henry stood on the Tennessee, while Fort Donelson guarded the Cumberland. These positions were crucial for the enemy. Capturing Fort Henry would open a navigable route to Muscle Shoals in Alabama, while taking Fort Donelson would secure access to Nashville and rich lands in Kentucky. By controlling these forts, the enemy would be pushed back to the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, cutting off vital communication. General Grant, then in command of the District of Cairo, was directed to make a reconnoissance to aid General Buell in Kentucky. Despite harsh weather, Grant's expedition successfully prevented enemy reinforcements, setting the stage for future victories.|"['1.

In February 1862, Flag-officer Foote led gunboats near Cairo and collaborated with General Halleck. Together, they planned to capture Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. Despite initial setbacks, they received orders to proceed. With limited resources, General Grant loaded half of his 17,000 troops onto boats and sent them under General McClernand's command. The expedition advanced with gunboat support. Grant scouted the enemy's position and decided to land troops south of a stream to avoid enemy fire. After bringing up the rest of the troops, Grant ordered an advance on Fort Henry. The fort was well-defended with a garrison of 2,800 and reinforcements from Fort Donelson. The high river levels posed challenges, but Grant was determined to act swiftly before the enemy could strengthen their position.|"[""1.

The strategy was for the troops and gunboats to commence their attack simultaneously. The troops were to surround the garrison while the gunboats engaged the fort up close. General Smith planned to land a brigade on the west bank to flank Heiman. As scheduled, both troops and gunboats initiated the assault. General Smith discovered that Fort Heiman was deserted upon arrival. The gunboats confronted the water batteries at close range, but the troops tasked with besieging Fort Henry faced delays due to poor roads, dense forests, and high water levels. Despite these setbacks, the outcome remained unchanged. Tilghman had evacuated most of his forces to outworks near Dover and Donelson to avoid naval gunfire. Following the capture of Tilghman and his men, our cavalry pursued the retreating enemy towards Donelson, seizing two guns and a few stragglers. Gunboats sustained damage, with the Essex suffering a significant blow to its boiler, causing casualties. After securing Fort Henry, Captain Phelps destroyed a railroad bridge. Hindered by heavy rain and impassable roads, the advance on Fort Donelson was postponed until conditions improved. General Grant personally scouted the fort's defenses, noting two accessible roads leading to Dover and Donelson. Fort Donelson covered about 100 acres, strategically positioned on high ground overlooking the Cumberland River. The fort's defenses included water batteries and an extensive line of rifle pits, protected by felled trees forming an abatis. The terrain surrounding the fort was rugged and wooded, making|"['1.

General Halleck started sending reinforcements to me as soon as I left Cairo. General Hunter sent troops from Kansas, and General Nelson's large division from Buell's army was also on its way. Orders from the War Department were issued to consolidate companies into full regiments. Despite not giving a clear response to my plan to attack Fort Donelson, Halleck sent tools for fortifying Fort Henry. Anxious to reach Fort Donelson quickly, I urged Flag-officer Foote to send gunboats up the Cumberland River. When the first reinforcements arrived under Colonel Thayer, we set out with 15,000 men, reaching the enemy by noon without delay. The troops were positioned strategically without trenches, using natural cover from the terrain. Although suffering from harsh winter conditions, we prepared to lay siege to Fort Donelson.|['1.

During the 12th and 13th centuries, the National forces, consisting of 15,000 soldiers, faced an entrenched enemy army of 21,000 without major battles. There was sporadic skirmishing due to troop movements, but no significant fighting except for an unsuccessful assault led by General McClernand on the 13th. This assault resulted in heavy casualties, overcrowding hospitals near Fort Donelson. Captain Walke's gunboat engaged the water batteries near Donelson on the 12th and 13th, creating a diversion. On the 14th, Flag-officer Foote arrived with iron-clads and wooden gunboats to attack the water batteries closely. The gunboats faced heavy fire, with some disabled. Despite casualties, the plan was to force the enemy to surrender. By the afternoon of the 14th, the engagement with the water batteries had concluded for the day, with several gunboats damaged.|"[""1.

On the morning of February 15th, 1862, the situation at Fort Donelson was tense. The enemy had celebrated the disabling of our gunboats, proclaiming victory to Richmond. The weather turned bitterly cold, with soldiers lacking tents and warmth. General Grant, upon receiving a message from Flag-officer Foote, hurried to the fleet. Foote, injured in battle, suggested entrenching while his gunboats underwent repairs. Meanwhile, the enemy launched a surprise attack, scattering troops. Grant swiftly mobilized reinforcements, including a naval fleet and additional troops. Despite the challenging conditions, he reached the battlefield to find the enemy contained, thanks to the strategic actions of his commanders. The engagement had shifted in favor of the National troops, setting the stage for a decisive turn in the conflict.|"['1.

During the Civil War, General Grant faced a critical moment when his troops ran out of ammunition. The enemy tried to break through their lines, but McClernand's division bore the brunt of the attack. Despite ammunition being close by, not all commanders ensured their men were supplied during engagements. As the soldiers ran out of ammunition, they couldn't withstand the enemy's fire. Thayer's brigade intervened, allowing the Union troops to regroup. Grant observed the chaos and quickly decided to launch an assault on the left flank. He rallied the demoralized men, urging them to refill their cartridge-boxes. Grant's decisive action led to the Confederates retreating back to their entrenchments. The next day, the Confederates surrendered, revealing the panic among their high-ranking officers. Floyd, the commanding officer, faced fear and possible treason charges for betraying his oath as Secretary of War. General Pillow's conceit and false reports couldn't save them as they fled the advancing Union forces.|"['1.

A meeting was held by the enemy to discuss surrendering Fort Donelson. General Buckner, the third-ranking officer, decided it was best to surrender to avoid further loss of life. The Federal forces demanded an unconditional surrender, and Buckner accepted. He sent word to his commanders to prevent further fighting and raised white flags. General Wallace arrived and a friendly conversation ensued. Buckner estimated 12,000 to 15,000 soldiers were surrendered. Parties were allowed to bury the dead, and some soldiers left, tired of the war. Many slipped away unnoticed.|"[""1.

The approximate number of Confederate soldiers at Fort Donelson during the Civil War cannot be precisely determined. Colonel Preston Johnston estimated around 17,000 soldiers, but this is likely an underestimate. The commissary general of prisoners provided rations to 14,623 prisoners passing through Cairo. General Pillow reported 2,000 killed or wounded, but the actual number may have been higher. Confederate generals Floyd and Pillow, along with about 4,000 men, escaped following the surrender. It is believed that the Confederate force at Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862, was around 21,000. The fall of Fort Donelson was met with joy in the North but caused distress in the South. Major promotions followed the victory, and General Halleck praised the efforts of Flag-officer Foote and others. General Grant believed that after Fort Donelson's fall, a swift offensive could have been waged across the South-west.|['Question 1: How many Confederate soldiers were estimated to be at Fort Donelson during the Civil War?\nA) 14,623\nB) 17,000\nC) 21,000\nD) 2,000\nE) 4,000', 'Question 2: Who provided rations to the prisoners passing through Cairo during the Civil War?\nA) General Pillow\nB) Colonel Preston Johnston\nC) General Grant\nD) Commmissary general of prisoners\nE) General Halleck', 'Question 3: Which Confederate generals escaped following the surrender at Fort Donelson?\nA) General Grant\nB) General Pillow\nC) Colonel Preston Johnston\nD) Flag-officer Foote\nE) General Halleck', 'Question 4: How did the fall of Fort Donelson affect the North and the South during the Civil War?\nA) Caused distress in the North\nB) Met with joy in the South\nC) Caused distress in the South\nD) Met with joy in the North\nE) Had no impact on either side', 'Question 5: Who praised the efforts of Flag-officer Foote and others after the fall of Fort Donelson?\nA) General Grant\nB) General Pillow\nC) General Halleck\nD) Colonel Preston Johnston\nE) Commmissary general of prisoners', 'Question 6: What did General Grant believe could have been waged across the South-west after the fall of Fort Donelson?\nA) A swift offensive\nB) A retreat\nC) A negotiation\nD) A defensive strategy\nE) A peace treaty']|['B) 17,000', 'D) Commmissary general of prisoners', 'B) General Pillow', 'D) Met with joy in the North', 'C) General Halleck', 'A) A swift offensive']
I quickly told my superior officer about our victory at Fort Donelson and our plan to capture Clarksville on the 21st and Nashville by March 1st. General C. F. Smith went to Clarksville as planned and found it deserted. The enemy was retreating from Columbus to Bowling Green, and General Buell was advancing from the north. I sent General Nelson to Nashville with two brigades, as Buell's reinforcements arrived. I directed Nelson to assist Buell in crossing the Cumberland River, which was high and had limited transportation. Nelson took control of Nashville, and I informed headquarters of my intention to go there on the 28th. Upon reaching Clarksville, I received Buell's urgent request for reinforcements due to a potential enemy offensive. Although General Smith initially dismissed the order, he complied upon my insistence. I proceeded to Nashville, where Buell and I discussed the ongoing fighting and the importance of securing the valuable supplies in the city.|['1.

General Albert Sidney Johnston commanded Confederate troops west of the Alleghany Mountains. National forces were divided into departments, hindering harmonious action. Johnston's troops extended from Columbus to Mill Springs. The Confederate commander's advantage was supreme control over troops. General George H. Thomas's victory at Mill Springs led to Confederate retreat from Bowling Green to Nashville. Johnston awaited the outcome at Fort Donelson. He made mistakes in command, leading to the fall of Nashville and Chattanooga. Johnston retreated to northern Mississippi. Lack of communication from General Halleck resulted in missed orders. Dispatches were not received due to a rebel operator. Johnston surrendered after being surrounded at Fort Donelson.|"[""1.

On March 2nd, I was instructed to return to Fort Henry, leaving a small group at Donelson. Orders were given for missions to Eastport, Mississippi, and Paris, Tennessee from Fort Henry. We departed Donelson on March 4th and swiftly reached the Tennessee River. Unexpectedly, on the same day, General Halleck sent a dispatch expressing concern over the strength of my troops. This was news to me as I had not been aware of his request. By March 6th, he had written again, criticizing my unauthorized visit to Nashville, a place within my command's boundaries. Despite my efforts to explain, Halleck reported false accusations to Washington, leading to my temporary removal. However, after a brief investigation, I was reinstated to command on March 13th. General Smith, a respected officer, supported me upon my return, but sadly passed away shortly after.|"[""1.

When I resumed control on March 17th, I found the army split. About half was on the east bank of the Tennessee at Savannah. One division was at Crump's landing on the west bank, four miles higher up, and the rest was at Pittsburg landing, five miles above Crump's. The enemy was heavily fortified at Corinth, a key railroad junction in the Mississippi valley. I quickly moved all troops at Savannah to Pittsburg landing, anticipating a confrontation with Johnston's army at Corinth. I selected Hamburg as the base for Buell's Army of the Ohio. Sherman's expedition to Eastport was hindered by heavy rains, and the troops had to return without reaching the railroad. By March 17th, the army on the Tennessee River comprised five divisions, with reinforcements arriving daily. Buell was en route with 40,000 veterans. Johnston's cavalry hinted at an impending attack, with a skirmish occurring on April 4th. Johnston's forces left Corinth to engage my army.|"[""1.

During a critical moment, the enemy was detected near the Mobile and Ohio railroad, causing concern for Crump's landing safety more than Pittsburg. Although the capture of either place was unlikely, a surprise attack on Crump's to destroy supplies was feared. General Wallace's strategic position was secure, and I planned to move headquarters to Pittsburg but awaited Buell's arrival at Savannah. Injured by a fall while heading to the front, I met Wallace and McPherson, assuring all was calm. Nelson's arrival at Savannah on the 5th led to him being positioned to support Crump's or Pittsburg. Heavy firing at Pittsburg on the 6th shifted focus there, prompting orders for Wallace to move promptly. Unfortunately, Wallace's delay led to missing the initial day's fight, causing a later dispute over the intended orders.|"[""1.

General Wallace's division, an experienced unit, was crucially absent from the battle at Pittsburg landing. The absence was keenly felt as the division's commander, General Wallace, made a strategic error on the 6th of April, 1862. The key position at Shiloh was held by General Sherman, with his raw division, and supported by McClernand and Prentiss. The battle unfolded between Lick Creek and Owl Creek, with the Confederates launching vigorous assaults. Despite heavy losses on both sides, the Confederates managed to capture General Prentiss and a significant portion of his troops. The undulating terrain and dense woods provided cover for the troops, with the National forces forced to readjust their positions closer to Pittsburg landing as the fighting continued. The day ended with the National line pushed back a mile from its original position.|"[""1.

During the Battle of Shiloh, the Union forces faced intense fighting against the Confederate troops. Despite inexperienced soldiers and unprepared officers, the Southern troops showed bravery in the face of Northern resilience. The battle raged from Snake Creek to Lick Creek, with continuous heavy firing throughout the day. General Grant moved along the line, giving directions and witnessing the valor of his troops. General Sherman's leadership inspired confidence, while General McClernand benefited from having such able support. Stragglers were common, and cavalry was positioned to prevent them from fleeing. General Buell arrived to reinforce the troops but encountered many panicked stragglers.

At the end of Sunday, the situation was this: Colonel J. D. Webster positioned artillery along the bluff near the log-house at Pittsburg Landing, facing south. Hurlbut's division was on the right of the artillery, extending west. McClernand was next in line, looking more westward, with a complete and organized division. Sherman followed, with his right reaching Snake Creek, also ready for action. Wallace's division had lost its organization due to changes in command during the battle. Prentiss' division was dispersed after valiant efforts. The troops prepared for another day of battle as night fell. Buell's troops arrived after dark. The gunboats and artillery under Webster helped repel enemy attacks. Victory seemed certain with the arrival of reinforcements.

During the night of the 6th, more troops joined General Buell's army, doubling its size and strength. Despite heavy rain, the soldiers were exposed without shelter. General Grant, with a swollen ankle, sought refuge under a tree, later moving to a log-house turned hospital. The Union troops, under Wallace, Sherman, McClernand, and Hurlbut, were positioned on the right, while Buell's forces were on the left. On the morning of the 7th, the enemy was discovered in camps a mile back, unaware of Buell's arrival. The Union forces attacked, driving the Confederates back throughout the day until they retreated.

During the second day of the fierce battle at Shiloh, I moved back and forth across the field to witness the progress. While riding with Colonel McPherson and Major Hawkins, our chief commissary, we strayed beyond our troop's left flank. As we leisurely approached the river, suddenly enemy fire erupted from the woods across the clearing. Shells and bullets whizzed past us, prompting a swift retreat to safety. Major Hawkins lost his hat in the rush, and McPherson's horse was fatally wounded. Despite the harrowing encounter, we counted ourselves lucky that the damage was not more severe. The treacherous conditions of the roads post-battle made pursuing the retreating enemy challenging. The aftermath revealed abandoned provisions and signs of a hasty retreat.

During the Battle of Shiloh, our army found itself unexpectedly on the defensive, lacking defensive fortifications and with many inexperienced soldiers. Despite these challenges, we emerged victorious, instilling great confidence in our troops. The Confederate forces fought bravely but ultimately suffered heavy losses. Following the battle, I instructed division commanders to have regiments bury their fallen comrades and organized the burial of Confederate soldiers. The decision not to fortify our position at Shiloh was deliberate, as I believed our troops needed discipline and training more than fortifications. General Buell, a respected officer, faced unfair criticism after the war, which I defended against during my travels in the North.

General Albert Sidney Johnston led the Confederate forces at the start of the battle but was wounded on the first day. Despite a wound that was not immediately fatal, Johnston refused to abandon his command. He continued to lead until exhaustion forced him to dismount, and he later passed away. His death was a blow to the Confederate troops and a source of encouragement to the Union soldiers. Johnston's military abilities were initially highly regarded, but after studying his actions, it became clear that he was indecisive. Despite setbacks, Johnston planned an offensive campaign to regain lost ground. However, his hesitation and delays in executing this plan ultimately led to his defeat. General Beauregard took over command after Johnston's death, and although criticized, his actions during the battle were deemed reasonable given the circumstances.|"[""1.

Colonel Wm. Preston Johnston's vivid account of the Battle of Shiloh is detailed and engaging. He describes the intense fighting, with Union soldiers pushed towards the Tennessee River by Confederate forces. Despite Confederate success, the National troops were not completely defeated. The battle lasted for over twelve hours, with heavy casualties on both sides. The Union troops, although facing challenges, regrouped for the second day of fighting. Ultimately, the battle ended in a Union victory, with the armies of the Tennessee and the Ohio playing significant roles.

The battle of Shiloh, also known as Pittsburg Landing, was a significant engagement during the Civil War. The battle resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, with conflicting reports on the losses. General Beauregard reported a total loss of 10,699 Confederate soldiers, while General Grant disputed this estimate, claiming that more enemy dead were buried than reported. The battle was fought in challenging terrain, hindering the navy's support until the first day's end. The battle marked a turning point for Grant, who realized that complete conquest was necessary to save the Union. The battle's aftermath led to a change in strategy, focusing on consuming supplies that could aid Confederate armies. The battle of Shiloh remains one of the most misunderstood conflicts of the Civil War, with reports and accounts being published long after the war ended.|"['1.

General Halleck arrived at Pittsburg landing on April 11 and took command. General Pope, fresh from capturing Island Number Ten, joined with 30,000 troops at Hamburg landing. Halleck had three armies under him: the Army of the Ohio, Army of the Mississippi, and Army of the Tennessee. The forces were divided into the right wing, reserve, center, and left wing. Major-General George H. Thomas led the right wing, McClernand the reserve, Buell the center, and Pope the left wing. I was named second in command. Preparations for an advance on Corinth were made, with Owl Creek bridged, roads improved, and caution against engagements. By April 30, all was ready. Corinth was a strategic location, and efforts to capture it were planned. The area was covered in forests and had creeks forming a natural defense. The enemy was entrenched on the west bank.|"[""1.

In May 1862, Beauregard's Confederate forces at Corinth were reinforced by General Van Dorn with 17,000 men, totaling around 50,000 effective soldiers. Meanwhile, the Union army, with approximately 120,000 troops, advanced towards Corinth from Shiloh. The movement was like a siege, with the National troops always behind fortifications. Even small scouting parties were cautious not to engage the enemy directly. The armies were entrenched from the Tennessee River to Corinth, ready for any attack. General Halleck led from the right wing, while Pope, on the left, faced some challenges due to orders to hold the line. Despite minor skirmishes and advances, the armies remained mostly in position, preparing for potential confrontations without major battles.|"[""1.

Our troops strategically positioned themselves near Corinth, with the right wing extending about five miles from the city. The enemy held two key positions, one on an elevated ground defended by a battery and infantry, and another at a log-house. General Sherman's division successfully captured these positions on May 28th, completing the siege of Corinth. Despite suggestions for a night march, General Logan later reported the enemy's evacuation. Trains heard indicated the Confederates were leaving. General Halleck prepared for battle on May 30th, but found Corinth abandoned upon arrival. The victory was bloodless, with the Confederates removing all supplies. The occupation of Corinth was important strategically, but some soldiers felt capturing the Confederate army would have been more impactful.|"[""1.

General Halleck swiftly began constructing defenses around Corinth, indicating its strategic importance. The forts were fortified in all directions, requiring a massive force to man them. Although never used, the fortifications were a crucial point for a potential final battle. After the National troops occupied Corinth, General Pope pursued the retreating garrison, followed by General Buell. Despite a 30-mile pursuit, no significant captures were made. By June 10th, the troops were back at Corinth. The Confederates were pushed out of West Tennessee, and Memphis was taken. The National forces controlled the Mississippi River from its source to Memphis, securing vital communication routes. With a mobile force of 80,000 men, a major campaign against the rebellion could have been launched. However, strategic errors led to missed opportunities for swift victories. General Grant's request to relocate his headquarters to Memphis was granted, and he departed with a small cavalry escort on June 21st.|"[""1.

The journey from La Grange to Memphis covers a distance of forty-seven miles. Between these two points, there were no stationed troops except for a small force protecting workers repairing the railroad. Upon reaching La Grange, I was welcomed by General Hurlbut, who had set up his headquarters at a country house. The host, a Southern gentleman supporting secession, invited us for dinner. Despite our differing views, I respected his dedication to his beliefs. Continuing towards Memphis on a warm June 23rd, we encountered a hospitable Union supporter named Mr. De Loche, who, aware of rebel presence in the area, subtly hinted at potential danger. Our journey was further marked by an encounter with rebel General Jackson, who narrowly missed capturing our party as we rested innocently under the shade of trees.|['1.

"General Jackson did not express his disappointment in failing to capture me to a young drover who later shared the soldiers' conversations.

On July 11th, General Halleck received orders to lead all the armies from Washington. I, being next in command, was summoned to Corinth. Uncertain about my headquarters, I asked if my staff should follow. The reply was vague. I hurried to Corinth, arriving on the 15th. Halleck departed on the 17th, leaving me in charge of West Tennessee. I was effectively a department commander but officially appointed on October 25th. My district covered West Tennessee and part of Kentucky. Troops were spread across railroads for defense. The scattered army from Corinth required new fortifications. The region was hostile. I reorganized troops swiftly. Facing a sizable enemy force, we had to defend key points. The war's tensest time was guarding Corinth and Memphis before reinforcements arrived. Communication was vital, with Memphis isolated but well-defended by Sherman and gunboats.|"[""1.

In the weeks following General Halleck's departure, there were numerous skirmishes between small groups of soldiers from both sides. These clashes were overshadowed by the larger battles but were still significant. Around July 23rd, Colonel Ross in Bolivar faced a threat from the enemy and had to be reinforced. By the 27th, there was fighting near the Hatchie River. Meanwhile, Bragg was moving his troops to Chattanooga, with Price stationed in Holly Springs. Despite having the power to defeat Bragg, I was advised not to scatter my troops. The advantage of friendly territory was evident as Bragg moved with ease. I was later instructed to live off resources from hostile citizens and deal firmly with rebels. On August 14th, two divisions were sent to Buell, and on the 22nd, Colonel Mason surrendered Clarksville to guerillas after being misled about their numbers.|"['1.

At the time I am writing about, the government wanted to extract as much cotton as possible from the South. They instructed me to assist in this endeavor, offering payment in gold. This directive not only helped the enemy profit from the cotton trade but also provided them with valuable intelligence on our military position. This situation was demoralizing for our troops, as they had to protect the citizens involved in this trade. Despite these challenges, our forces faced and defeated multiple enemy attacks in late August and early September. Colonel M. D. Leggett repelled a 4,000-strong force near Bolivar, while Colonel Dennis and others successfully defended against guerillas and cavalry, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Meanwhile, General Buell's movements were crucial in countering Confederate advances towards Chattanooga.

Granger and Sheridan arrived in Louisville before Buell, and that night Sheridan built defenses around the railroad station for incoming troops. By September 4th, I had divisions stationed at Corinth, Rienzi, Jacinto, and Danville. Rosecrans led my left wing, Ord the center, and Sherman was in Memphis with part of his forces at Brownsville. This setup allowed rapid reinforcement at threatened points. On September 7th, I received news of Van Dorn and Price advancing towards Corinth. One division was moved from Memphis to Bolivar to counter any threat. My main concern was preventing further reinforcement of Bragg in Tennessee. By September 13th, Price reached Iuka, east of Corinth. Murphy evacuated the town, fearing a rebel move to reinforce Bragg. I quickly mobilized spare forces to Corinth to prevent Price from advancing into Tennessee. Within 24 hours, reinforcements arrived under General Ord, boosting our strength by nearly 8,000 troops. Our goal was to confront Price before Van Dorn could join forces with him.|"[""1.

On September 19th, General Geo. H. Thomas was sent east to reinforce Buell, making my army more defensive. The Memphis and Charleston railroad was abandoned, except at Corinth, with small forces left at Chewalla and Grand Junction. Eventually, Bolivar became our main position on the Mississippi Central railroad. Our cavalry patrolled the front, and we often sent expeditions to monitor enemy movements. The locals, except the slaves, were hostile to us. On the 22nd, Bolivar faced a threat from a large enemy force, but reinforcements from Corinth averted the attack. Van Dorn's movements near Memphis were closely watched. By October 1st, it was clear that Corinth was the target of a strong rebel force. The enemy attacked on the 4th but was repelled with heavy losses. Despite orders, General Rosecrans did not pursue the retreating enemy after the battle.|['1. What was General Geo. H.

General Ord assumed command of Hurlbut's troops on the 4th. They intercepted Van Dorn's retreating forces at a swampy area near Corinth. Ord attacked, pushing the enemy back, causing casualties. Despite being wounded, Ord held a crucial bridge, forcing Van Dorn to retreat. Meanwhile, Rosecrans, delayed and taking the wrong route, traveled with a slow wagon train. His pursuit was ineffective. The battle of Corinth was bloody, with significant losses on both sides. Grant considered it a victory but not as complete as hoped. The battle relieved fears for the region's safety. Grant then planned a move towards Vicksburg. Later, Pemberton's reinforcements at Holly Springs were noted. Rosecrans was relieved of duty and later promoted to lead the army in Middle Tennessee.

At the end of the described operations, my force totaled about 48,500 soldiers. Among them, 4,800 were in Kentucky and Illinois, 7,000 in Memphis, 19,200 in the area south of Mound City, and 17,500 in Corinth. General McClernand had permission to organize troops for opening the Mississippi. New troops and reinforcements started arriving. On October 25th, I took command of the Department of the Tennessee. By November 2nd, with more reinforcements, I was ready to take action. This was a relief after months of defense in enemy territory. Vicksburg was crucial to the enemy due to its strategic location near the river. The campaign against Vicksburg began on November 2nd with divisions moving from Corinth and Bolivar.

During the Civil War, General Grant faced challenges in supplying his troops in enemy territory. To ensure provisions, he organized the collection of forage and food under the quartermaster and commissary. With plantations deserted, he employed freedmen to harvest crops. Chaplain Eaton, later a prominent educator, helped oversee this effort. The freedmen were also tasked with cutting wood for steamers on the Mississippi River. Grant's strategy not only fed and clothed the freedmen but also provided them with comfortable facilities. Meanwhile, rumors of a separate command under General McClernand caused concern. Grant's authority was clarified by General Halleck, allowing him to consolidate troops and push the enemy back. Grant established Holly Springs as a supply depot and coordinated with General Sherman to reinforce their positions. Through strategic planning and resourceful initiatives, Grant navigated challenges and strengthened his forces against Vicksburg.|"['1.

The river Tallahatchie was too high, the bridge wrecked, and Pemberton fortified on the south side. Crossing was impossible with the enemy nearby. I sent the cavalry upstream to secure a crossing, causing the enemy to retreat, possibly hastened by Hovey and Washburn. Troops pursued the enemy to Oxford and then halted to fix the railroad for supplies. I learned an expedition down the Mississippi was needed and ordered Sherman back to Memphis to lead. He was to organize troops, move towards Vicksburg, and cooperate with the gunboats. The plan was to reduce Vicksburg as circumstances dictated. Rations and transportation were Sherman's responsibility. I suggested this plan earlier and acted swiftly to prevent McClernand from taking over. My orders did not initially involve going beyond the Yallabusha river.|"['1.

General Sherman and I had a plan to work together during our movements. If Pemberton couldn't be kept away from Vicksburg, I was to follow him. We didn't plan to abandon the railroad north of the Yallabusha. The idea was to use that spot as a backup supply base and consider moving down the Yazoo River until we could connect with the Mississippi. If the enemy retreated, I intended to pursue them even to Vicksburg's gates. The plan was to secure the road to Grenada and then establish a new supply base on the Yazoo or at Vicksburg, with Grenada as a fallback. However, maintaining a long supply line in enemy territory proved challenging. Eventually, I had to change my plans due to unforeseen circumstances and returned to La Grange and Grand Junction, making the Mississippi River our supply route.|"['1.

After the war ended, I discovered a diary detailing General Pemberton's challenging retreat from the Tallahatchie. Despite the difficult roads hindering artillery and trains, a sense of panic prevailed among the troops. This panic puzzled me, as no enemy expeditions had begun along the Mississippi River. Reflecting on the abundant army supplies in central Mississippi, I realized we could have subsisted there for two months instead of just two weeks. This lesson was crucial as it enabled our army to survive for twenty days on only five days' rations during a later campaign. Despite setbacks like the loss of supplies at Holly Springs, we managed to collect ample provisions from the region, teaching us the value of local resources. The news of our captured supplies led to mixed reactions among the people, highlighting the importance of strategic planning and adaptability in challenging situations.|"[""1.

On January 10th, the road from Holly Springs to Grand Junction and then to Memphis was finished, and I shifted my headquarters to Memphis. During the campaign, losses were about equal, mostly due to captures. Sherman began his expedition with 20,000 men from Memphis, reinforced by 12,000 more at Helena, Arkansas. The troops on the west bank of the river were under my command. McClernand received orders and joined Sherman at the Yazoo on January 2nd. They decided to attack Arkansas Post, capturing 5,000 prisoners and 17 guns. McClernand returned to Napoleon after the victory. Both Sherman and Admiral Porter expressed doubts about McClernand's leadership, prompting me to assume command. On January 20th, I ordered McClernand to Young's Point and Milliken's Bend while I made preparations in Memphis. General Hurlbut took command, and troops were sent to the front.|"[""1.

In January of 1863, I arrived at Young's Point and assumed command the next day. General McClernand, a prominent politician, reprimanded me in a letter for my actions. Despite his insubordination, I chose to overlook it for the sake of the service. The campaign and siege of Vicksburg began, with the challenge of securing a foothold on dry land east of the river to operate against the city. The Mississippi River winds through a wide valley, flanked by highlands on the east and lower land on the west. The terrain was cut by navigable bayous, making it hard to navigate or march through. Many believed the war was failing, and there was a lack of voluntary enlistments. To avoid further setbacks, I decided to move forward towards a decisive victory rather than retreat to Memphis, aiming to boost morale and secure support for the Union cause.|"['1.

I always admired the South for their boldness in silencing opposition during the civil war. War should be avoided if possible, but once started, aiding the enemy is intolerable. Vicksburg sits on high ground by the Mississippi River, with Haines' Bluff fortified on the Yazoo River. The river's course near Vicksburg has changed, creating an island where a peninsula once stood. The marshy area north of Yazoo made a front attack impossible. General Williams attempted a canal from Young's Point to the river, but it failed due to the river's eddies. Even if successful, the canal would not have been strategically advantageous. The enemy quickly established a battery to counter the canal, making it unusable.|"['1.

While this work was ongoing, we were also working on different tasks. Our main focus was to find a suitable spot for landing on high ground on the east side of the river or to create water passages to bypass the city's defenses. On January 30th, the day after I arrived at the front, I instructed General McPherson, who was stationed at Lake Providence, to breach the levee at that location. If successful, this would open a navigable route through the Red River to the Mississippi River, just above Port Hudson and four hundred miles downstream from Vicksburg. Lake Providence is an old part of the Mississippi River, about a mile away from the current channel. It connects to Bayou Baxter, Bayou Macon, and the Tensas, Washita, and Red Rivers. However, the narrow and winding bayous were filled with fallen trees, making navigation difficult. Despite our efforts, this route was eventually abandoned. Another attempt was made through Moon Lake and the Yazoo Pass in Arkansas, but it also faced challenges and did not succeed in the end.|"[""1.

Fort Pemberton was a strategic location during the Civil War, situated barely above the waterline. Attempts were made to flood the area by cutting the Mississippi levee. However, the plan did not succeed in dislodging the enemy forces. Admiral Ross, along with his fleet, retreated but later met with General Quinby at Yazoo Pass. Quinby assumed command and decided to revisit Fort Pemberton. After a thorough inspection, no attack was launched. Meanwhile, concerns arose for Ross's safety until reinforcements arrived. Admiral Porter explored the waterways connecting Steel's Bayou to the Yazoo River, facing obstacles like dense timber and sharpshooters.

During times of war, the President, as the Commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy according to the Constitution, has the responsibility of choosing commanders without feeling pressured. Once selected, the commander's duty is to perform to the best of their abilities. If a position is sought after or obtained through personal or political influence, the fear of failure may hinder independent decision-making. Those who secure important roles through such means often keep records of complaints and predictions of defeat, shifting blame in case of failure. As the waters receded, troops gathered at Milliken's Bend for a final successful move. A plan to move below Vicksburg was kept secret until necessary preparations were made. Cooperation with the navy was crucial for success, with Admiral Porter playing a key role in the strategy. The fleet's movements were shrouded in secrecy to prevent enemy detection. Porter's expertise in preparing steamers for dangerous passages through enemy territories was invaluable. The preparations involved concealing the boilers and fires from view with hay, cotton, and grain to protect them from enemy fire.|"['1.

Before this, I had gathered yawls and barges from St. Louis and Chicago for use as ferries downstream. On April 16th, Porter was set to embark on his dangerous journey. The lead ship, the Benton, under Porter's command, set off at ten in the evening. It was followed by the Lafayette carrying a captured steamer, the Price, tied to its side, along with the Louisville, Mound City, Pittsburgh, and Carondelet, all naval vessels. Then came the Forest Queen, Silver Wave, and Henry Clay transports, each towing coal-loaded barges for fuel. The gunboat Tuscumbia brought up the rear. As they sailed, the enemy batteries opened fire, hitting the vessels many times but causing little damage to the gunboats. Unfortunately, the Henry Clay was disabled and set on fire, burning to the water's edge. The enemy, anticipating the fleet, lit bonfires along the riverbanks. While the sight was magnificent, it was also terrifying. Fortunately, there were no fatalities on the transports, and only a few injuries. Men worked to patch any holes in the hulls with cotton during the battery run. Admiral Porter quickly repaired any damage.|"[""1.

I had begun the march with McClernand and his four divisions on March 29th, moving towards Grand Gulf via Richmond, Louisiana, and New Carthage. Unfortunately, the roads were in poor condition, almost submerged. Several miles from New Carthage, the levee to Bayou Vidal had multiple breaches, flooding the roads for about two miles. To overcome this obstacle, boats were gathered from nearby bayous and makeshift ones were constructed on-site to ferry the troops across the flooded area. By April 6th, one division and its artillery had reached New Carthage using these boats. Recognizing the inefficiency of this method, I visited the site on April 17th and saw the need for a better approach. McClernand had discovered a longer route from Smith's plantation to Perkins' plantation, increasing the march from Milliken's Bend. Despite challenges like rapid currents and the need to build bridges, McClernand's command, supervised by Lieutenant Hains, successfully constructed four bridges totaling about two thousand feet in length. These bridges allowed the entire army, including artillery, cavalry, and wagon trains, to cross without incident, except for the loss of one siege gun. These orders are crucial for the army's movement to secure a position on the east bank of the Mississippi River for the approach to Vicksburg.|"['1.

On April 14th, Brigadier-General J. C. Sullivan was given command of the forces safeguarding the area from here to New Carthage. He was reminded to focus on General Orders, No. 69, dated March 20, 1863. McClernand was already positioned south on the Mississippi, with two of McPherson's divisions starting their march. The third division was en route from Lake Providence to Milliken's Bend. Sherman was to follow McPherson, with two of his divisions at Duckport and Young's Point, and the third, led by Steele, returning from Greenville, Mississippi. To address the issue of rationing the army, six steamers were prepared to run the batteries, loaded with supplies and towed barges. Volunteers from the army, mainly from Logan's division, assisted in navigating the vessels through the perilous mission. By April 24th, reconnoissances were conducted to find suitable landing spots near Grand Gulf.

On the 27th, McClernand's corps reached Hard Times, followed closely by McPherson's. The plan was to land on the east side of the river. By the morning of the 29th, 10,000 men from McClernand's corps were ready to embark. The goal was to have the navy silence the Grand Gulf guns while troops landed swiftly and overtook the enemy works. Orders were issued to commence immediate embarkation, leaving only essential items behind. Troops were to form quickly on landing and secure strategic points. Admiral Porter's gunboats attacked the enemy for over five hours without success. The navy withdrew, and plans were made for a nighttime battery run. The high bluff at Grand Gulf made a front attack impossible. The navy suffered casualties, and a new strategy was devised for the next phase of the operation.|"[""1.

A strip of land juts out from Louisiana towards Grand Gulf, shaped by the river flowing eastward for about three miles above and then in the opposite direction for a similar distance below. The land was too wet and low for marching without a levee. Porter agreed to use his fleet as transports, anticipating the need. McClernand landed his troops on the west bank under the cover of night, while the navy passed the batteries successfully. A colored man's tip led them to a good landing at Bruinsburg, enabling a quiet landing without opposition. The goal was to force Pemberton to keep troops near Vicksburg while securing a foothold on high ground east of the river. Sherman moved with ten regiments and gunboats, preparing to attack without casualties. Orders were given to Sherman to withdraw from Haines' Bluff and follow McPherson. The embarkation took place at De Shroon's, Louisiana. The successful landing brought a sense of relief, marking a critical step towards the campaign's objective.|"[""1.

During the Civil War, the enemy held strategic locations like Grand Gulf, Haines' Bluff, and Jackson with a large force. To gain an advantage, we needed to capture Grand Gulf as a base. Bruinsburg, near high ground, was our first target. The garrison from Grand Gulf was expected to stop us, but we secured a foothold quickly. Despite challenges crossing the river, we landed troops swiftly. General McClernand advanced towards Port Gibson, meeting resistance at Thompson's plantation. The difficult terrain favored the defenders, but with strategic maneuvers, we outflanked the enemy. By sunset, we pushed the enemy back, securing a victory near Port Gibson. Our forces regrouped for the night, ready to continue the fight the next day.|"[""1.

The journey to Port Gibson began at dawn, with the troops crossing the South Fork of the Bayou Pierre on a makeshift bridge hastily constructed from wooden materials. Colonel J. H. Wilson took charge of the bridge's construction, with officers and men pitching in to help. Meanwhile, one brigade distracted a rebel battery, while two other brigades sought a crossing at the North Fork to repair another bridge. The enemy withdrew upon realizing our strategic moves. As we advanced, Crocker's division joined us from Bruinsburg without delay, marching swiftly to Grand Gulf. During this critical time, my son Frederick, barely thirteen years old, accompanied me through battles and sieges, showing remarkable courage and adaptability. Despite challenges with transportation and supplies, we pressed forward, collecting a motley assortment of vehicles and draft animals to transport ammunition. The focus was on swift progress, with formalities set aside until a secure position was established.|"['1. What did Colonel J. H.

At Port Gibson, I learned of Colonel Grierson's successful raid through central Mississippi. Starting with 1,700 men on April 17th, he split his forces, with Colonel Hatch engaging in a fierce battle at Columbus. Grierson continued, disrupting vital railroads and reaching Baton Rouge on May 2nd. As we crossed the North Fork on May 2nd, enemy fire greeted us, but we pushed forward. McPherson outmaneuvered the retreating enemy, securing Hankinson's ferry. Logan's division turned towards Grand Gulf, meeting resistance but prevailing. At Grand Gulf on May 3rd, we regrouped. Learning of Banks' delayed arrival at Port Hudson, I altered our strategy. Rather than wait, we moved to besiege Vicksburg independently, aiming to cut off the enemy's reinforcements and secure victory.|"[""1.

Grand Gulf was abandoned as a base, and officials in Washington were informed. I knew Halleck's caution would disapprove, but it was the only chance for success. Waiting for Washington's reply would take too long, giving me time to see if my plan was possible. Even Sherman, who later ignored supply bases while marching through four Confederate States with a larger army, warned me of the road's limitations. I replied that I didn't expect full rations from Grand Gulf but planned to gather what we could and rely on the country for the rest. We started with two days' rations and found plenty along the way. Delaying would allow the enemy to fortify. Troops waited for supplies, and reconnaissances were ordered to mislead the enemy. Sherman arrived and crossed with his command. Rations were issued, and a forward movement was planned. Troops were shifted, and the march towards Vicksburg began.|"[""1.

After crossing the Big Black River at Hankinson's ferry, McPherson's troops were withdrawn to approach Vicksburg from the east, as Pemberton was unlikely to permit a close besiegement due to the broken terrain. The troops moved towards the railroad east of Vicksburg, one or two corps at a time, with McClernand guarding the crossings on the Big Black. The cavalry played a crucial role in reconnoitring and finding the best routes. The plan was to engage Pemberton's forces in detail, estimating his strength at Vicksburg to be around 18,000 men. The movements were made without much opposition, with the army nearly parallel to the Jackson and Vicksburg railroad, about seven miles south of it. McPherson encountered the enemy near Raymond and successfully carried out an assault, driving the enemy away. The ultimate goal was to besiege Vicksburg by first eliminating any possibility of aid from Jackson.|"[""1.

On the 13th, new orders replaced previous ones for movements. McPherson was to head to Clinton from Jackson, Sherman was to march to Raymond, and McClernand was to move to Raymond with three divisions while guarding the Big Black crossing. I declined sending troops to Banks on the Red River due to the enemy's strongholds at Port Hudson and Vicksburg. General Johnston took command of Confederate troops in Mississippi on the 13th. Troops were strategically positioned and reconnoissances were ongoing. McPherson and Sherman advanced towards Jackson, while McClernand's divisions were strategically placed for reinforcement. Despite challenging road conditions, troops pressed on without complaint. By nine o'clock on the 14th, Crocker encountered the enemy's pickets, leading to a confrontation outside the intrenchments. Johnston's forces, reinforced overnight, awaited further reinforcements.|"['1.

On the night of the 13th, General Johnston urgently messaged General Pemberton at Edward's station, warning of General Sherman's presence at Clinton and the need for communication to facilitate reinforcement. Johnston emphasized the strategic importance of attacking Sherman's forces from the rear, highlighting the immense value of defeating them. The dispatch, sent in triplicate, was intercepted by a loyal messenger expelled from Memphis for expressing disloyal sentiments. Upon receiving this vital information on the 14th, orders were swiftly issued to McPherson to move back to Bolton to intercept Johnston. Simultaneously, McClernand and Blair were directed to converge at Bolton to prevent the enemy from crossing the Big Black River towards Vicksburg. The urgent need to assemble forces quickly to counter the enemy's advance was stressed, with a strategic focus on cutting off their supply lines and delivering a decisive blow. The troops, dispersed over different routes, were coordinated to unite and confront the approaching threat effectively.|"[""1.

McPherson's orders were to march at seven in the morning, reaching Hovey by four and camping. Meanwhile, Sherman was in Jackson, destroying roads and bridges. I rode to Clinton, instructing McClernand to move cautiously towards Edward's station the next morning, keeping an eye out for the enemy. Pemberton, however, moved south from Edward's station to cut off our base. By the 15th, Pemberton tried to cross Baker's Creek but was hindered by rain. He then decided to move south and get between us and our base, which we had abandoned a week earlier. By the 16th, Pemberton was marching east with a large force. I ordered Sherman to Bolton with all speed, while Blair and McClernand were directed to converge at Edward's station.

McClernand was positioned on the middle road and had a shorter distance to travel to reach the enemy's location compared to McPherson. I instructed him through a staff officer to advance and attack, but McClernand's progress seemed delayed despite repeated orders. Champion's Hill, where Pemberton awaited us, was strategically chosen due to its elevation and commanding view of the surrounding area. The terrain was rugged, with a ravine on the east side and a gradual slope on the west. The battle intensified by midday, with skirmishes evolving into a fierce confrontation. Troops under McPherson and Logan engaged the enemy, with Logan's maneuver inadvertently cutting off the enemy's retreat path. As the battle raged on, reinforcements were called for, but the enemy seized the opportunity to retreat once McPherson's command shifted to support the frontline.|"[""1.

During the Battle of Champion's Hill, General Grant's forces faced a tough fight. Hovey, with help from Logan and Crocker's brigades, launched multiple attacks on the enemy. By late afternoon, the enemy retreated hastily. Despite the challenging terrain, Carr's and Osterhaus's divisions joined the pursuit. The battle lasted four intense hours, with every man from Hovey's and McPherson's divisions fully engaged. McClernand's delay in advancing hindered the Union forces from achieving a more decisive victory. The Union suffered 2,441 casualties, while the Confederates lost over 6,000 soldiers.

McPherson quickly advanced with his troops, leaving a brigade to protect the wounded. The pursuit continued until it got dark. By the night of May 16th, McPherson's forces camped a few miles west of the battleground. Other commanders like Carr and Osterhaus were stationed at Edward's station, while Blair was three miles southeast. Hovey stayed on the battlefield. They found abandoned war supplies, including thirty artillery pieces. Despite being alone, they found shelter in a vacant house. Sherman's troops also moved westward. The next day, Sherman was directed to Bridgeport on the Big Black River to flank the enemy. The advance division resumed the pursuit early on the 17th and found the enemy at the Big Black River. The enemy had constructed defenses using cotton bales and dirt, commanding the area from a height.|"['1.

During the Civil War, a crucial moment arrived when an officer delivered an order from General Halleck to General Grant. The order directed Grant to return to Grand Gulf to join forces with General Banks against Port Hudson and then besiege Vicksburg. Grant, however, deemed the order too late and felt that obeying it would be unwise due to their current position. As they deliberated, the troops engaged in a successful assault on the enemy. The enemy fled, leaving behind guns and prisoners. To pursue the enemy, bridges had to be swiftly constructed. Lieutenant Hains, General McPherson, and General Ransom took charge of building these bridges using various methods. By the morning of the 18th, all three bridges were completed, allowing the troops to cross. Meanwhile, General Sherman's forces also made significant progress, with some minor resistance encountered and swiftly overcome. The narrative showcases the strategic and logistical challenges faced during this critical phase of the campaign.|"['1.

"McPherson, after crossing the Big Black River, reached the Jackson and Vicksburg road, situated behind Sherman's position. He camped near enemy lines under the cover of darkness. Meanwhile, McClernand advanced along the direct road towards Mount Albans, later turning left to align his troops on the route from Baldwin's ferry to Vicksburg, positioning himself south of McPherson. With my three corps strategically positioned along different roads leading to Vicksburg, the city was encircled. Skirmishes ensued on the 19th as we solidified our positions. Despite the enemy's demoralization, I ordered an assault on the 19th, resulting in advancements for our troops. The following days were spent fortifying our position and establishing supply routes. Facing dwindling rations, the troops eagerly awaited provisions. A soldier's cry for ""hard tack"" resonated, swiftly met with cheers upon assurance of forthcoming supplies. A second assault was planned amid concerns of Johnston's proximity and potential reinforcement of Pemberton. The attack on the 22nd, marked by a synchronized cannonade, saw gallant efforts but no breakthroughs.

I decided to lay siege to Vicksburg strategically to avoid further losses. The 22nd's experience convinced everyone that this was the best approach, and they diligently worked on fortifications and approaches. With the navy controlling the river, Vicksburg was completely surrounded. By holding our position, we limited the enemy's supplies. Troops began crossing at Bruinsburg on April 30th, and by May 18th, the army was behind Vicksburg. Within twenty days, the city was besieged, battles won, and the city captured. The Union forces, under 43,000 men, marched over 180 miles, capturing prisoners, cannons, and territory. Despite facing over 60,000 enemy troops, we managed to defeat them in detail. The regular siege work began after an unsuccessful assault, with Sherman, McPherson, and McClernand strategically positioned. Reinforcements arrived, roads were built, and preparations made for a prolonged siege.|"['1.

The terrain around Vicksburg is excellent for defense. To the north, it rises about 200 feet above the Mississippi River, with ravines filled with vegetation. Moving south, the land flattens, but remains cut by ravines and streams. The enemy's defensive line followed a ridge from the river north of the city, eastward, then south to the Jackson road, three miles back, and southwest to the river. Deep ravines lay in front of these defenses. The irregular line of defense followed gullies and ridges, making it challenging to fortify. Our task was immense, with only four engineers, led by Captain Prime. Graduates from West Point helped, but the work was demanding. The siege began with the establishment of artillery batteries, camps, and connecting rifle-pits. The enemy's use of explosive musket-balls was brutal but ineffective against our defenses.|"['1.

The foe couldn't use our tactic to shield their soldiers since we had an endless supply of ammo and used it freely. Wooden mortars were crafted by boring logs for shells and binding them with iron bands, successfully hurling shells at the enemy. The labor was mainly done by pioneers and paid African American workers, with troops assisting. By June 30, 220 guns were in place, with a strong defense against Vicksburg. Visitors flooded in, some out of curiosity, others to see loved ones. The Governor of Illinois visited early, and we showed them Sherman's headquarters. Blair's division was sent to secure supplies and render the area impassable for the enemy. Porter was asked to station the marine brigade at Haines' Bluff.|"[""1.

On June 26th, a letter from Banks requested ten thousand men at Port Hudson, which I couldn't provide as I believed it unnecessary. A brigade under General Kimball arrived on June 3rd from Hurlbut's command, stationed at Mechanicsburg to watch the Big Black River. Colored and white troops at Milliken's Bend were attacked on June 7th but repelled with gunboat support. Mower's brigade was sent to drive the enemy back. On June 8th, a division under General Sooy Smith reached Haines' Bluff. General Washburn took command there. General Herron's division arrived on June 11th, strengthening our left flank. General Parke's two divisions arrived on June 14th, bolstering our forces.

From May 23rd, our efforts to fortify and advance towards the enemy were in full swing. We were prepared for a potential siege from Johnston in the east, while also besieging Pemberton in the west. Despite being well-protected against Vicksburg, we fortified our positions against Johnston. Although we could have taken the offensive against him, I chose to maintain our defensive stance to safeguard our hold on Pemberton's army. By June 25th, we had successfully charged and exploded a mine near the enemy's parapet, causing a massive crater. The enemy's attempt to counter our mine failed, resulting in casualties on their side. A second explosion on July 1st further damaged the rebel redan.

From now on, we worked diligently to advance our positions closer to the enemy, planning to explode multiple mines simultaneously before launching an assault. We were strategically positioned at three different points, ready for action. Intercepted communication revealed Johnston's plan to attack us to aid Vicksburg. However, I knew Vicksburg wouldn't make a strong effort to save itself. Picket lines were so close that soldiers could converse. We learned of Pemberton's escape plan, constructing boats to cross to Louisiana. We took precautions to prevent their escape. By July 1st, our forces were at the enemy's ditch, preparing for a major assault on July 6th. White flags appeared, leading to a ceasefire as the enemy sought negotiations.

"During the siege of Vicksburg, there was friendly banter between the soldiers from both sides. The Union troops were called ""Yanks"" while the rebels were referred to as ""Johnnies."" The soldiers exchanged words across the lines, with the rebels taunting the Union troops about entering town and the Union soldiers responding confidently.

On the 4th of July, General Holmes led an attack on Helena, Arkansas, with thousands of soldiers. Despite his larger army, he was defeated by General Prentiss and his much smaller force. The Confederates suffered heavy losses, with General Holmes understating the true number. The Union forces had far fewer casualties. This battle marked the last attempt by the Confederacy to lift the siege of Vicksburg. Negotiations for surrender began, and preparations were made to take the offensive against Johnston. After the surrender, celebrations took place in Vicksburg. Many citizens had been living underground to seek safety from the constant shelling.

I wrote to General Banks about the surrender of Vicksburg and offered troops to capture the enemy's foothold on the Mississippi River. General Banks shared this news with General Gardner at Port Hudson, who then surrendered on July 9th. The Union forces gained control of Port Hudson, capturing many prisoners and supplies. Paroles were issued to Confederate soldiers, but some refused to sign, wanting to go North as prisoners instead of returning to fight.

The victory at Vicksburg and Gettysburg uplifted the spirits of the North during the Civil War. The capture of Vicksburg led to the surrender of 31,600 prisoners, 172 cannons, and a large cache of weapons. The Union army, armed with mostly outdated muskets, acquired superior arms from the enemy after the surrender. The success at Vicksburg and the retreat of the Confederate army marked a turning point. The military education gained through these battles was invaluable. Many officers proved their worth, with some rising to higher commands. General F. P.

During the Vicksburg campaign under Admiral Porter's navy, the collaboration between the army and navy was crucial for success. The campaign was prompted by the need for a decisive victory due to challenges faced during the Civil War. Rapid movements were vital for the Army of the Tennessee as they besieged Vicksburg. After the surrender of Vicksburg, immediate actions were taken to secure the region and inform authorities of the victory. General Sherman swiftly advanced towards Jackson, forcing the Confederate forces to retreat. Despite the challenges of the hot weather and bad roads, the Union forces successfully captured Jackson. The National loss was minimal, and the campaign's success was attributed to the coordinated efforts between the army and navy.|['1.

During the Civil War, efforts were made to provide aid to the wounded and sick Confederate soldiers left behind. Rations were distributed to families in Jackson, as well as to those in Raymond. Medicine and food were also sent to help destitute families and the sick in Raymond. General Sherman was urged to ensure his troops behaved respectfully while passing through the state, only taking what was necessary for survival. Provisions and forage were issued to people from Bruinsburg to Jackson and back to Vicksburg. Despite suggestions to campaign against Mobile, General Halleck favored focusing on the trans-Mississippi region. Grant's proposal was turned down, leading to defensive actions being taken. Grant believed capturing Mobile would have strategic advantages, but his requests were denied by Halleck. Grant faced challenges with troop movements and strategic decisions during this period.|"['1.

During my time near Vicksburg, my troops were busy dealing with guerilla bands and small cavalry groups causing trouble in the area. These troublemakers were not looking for a fight but to create chaos and would disappear at the first sight of our troops. Many deserters from Pemberton's and Johnston's armies roamed the region, refusing to fight further in the war. Some wanted to return home while others aimed to reach the North for work. A sense of peace briefly settled among the locals, but it didn't last. I had to send a corps to General Banks and cooperate on movements west of the Mississippi. Unfortunately, my plans were disrupted when a runaway horse caused me a serious injury, leaving me bedridden for a while. Despite my absence, General Sherman managed operations in my name, ensuring the smooth running of affairs.|"[""1.

"After the Battle of Chickamauga, General Grant received urgent orders to report to Cairo. Despite being injured, he immediately set out and met with the Secretary of War in Louisville. Grant was given the choice to lead the newly created ""Military Division of Mississippi"" with the option of replacing General Rosecrans with General Thomas. Grant accepted the latter. The Secretary of War caught a cold during this journey from which he never fully recovered. Grant had previously urged the government to act against Mobile after the fall of Vicksburg. He had advised Rosecrans to advance against Bragg to either hold his troops in place or capture Chattanooga.

During a critical time, a movement against Mobile was suggested to the general-in-chief. The Army of the Cumberland faced danger due to depleting troops and the enemy's reinforcement. Mobile's significance to the enemy was noted, and its defense was mainly artillery-based. Despite the proposal to threaten Mobile by land and water simultaneously, the idea was dismissed. Subsequently, assistance was urgently needed for Rosecrans, who was in trouble and required reinforcements. The strategic retreat was complicated by the challenging terrain, lack of supplies, and the enemy's control over crucial routes. The difficult situation required immediate action to prevent a disastrous retreat. The troops were mobilized to support Rosecrans, and a decisive battle ensued at Chickamauga, resulting in heavy casualties. The National troops fortified themselves in Chattanooga, facing the enemy on commanding heights. The urgency of the situation demanded swift action to avert a catastrophic defeat.|['1.

Troops at Chattanooga faced a dire situation. Lack of supplies meant they had worn-out clothing and no fuel. To address this, trees were cut on the north bank, formed into rafts, and floated down the river to the Federal lines. Upon receiving a dispatch from Mr. Dana, Mr. Stanton urgently sought Grant's presence to prevent a retreat. Grant quickly assumed command, telegraphed orders, and set out for the front. Traveling through difficult conditions, including mud and debris, he reached Chattanooga. Along the way, he made strategic telegraphs to Burnside and Admiral Porter, emphasizing fortifications and supply convoys. Despite challenges, Grant's decisive actions aimed to stabilize the situation and reinforce critical positions in the region.|"['1.

In the evening, many high-ranking officers visited to discuss the situation. They showed on a map the line Rosecrans intended to retreat to, marked in red or blue. General W. F. Smith, the chief engineer, explained the army's position and the terrain clearly. He had set up a saw-mill by the river and was building bridges and boats. The next day, I went with Thomas and Smith for an inspection. We crossed the river and reached Brown's Ferry unnoticed by the enemy. That night, I ordered the opening of a supply route to Bridgeport to feed the soldiers. Chattanooga is in a valley with Missionary Ridge to the east and Lookout Mountain to the west. The Tennessee River flows near the town, curving south towards Lookout Mountain. The Memphis and Charleston Railroad passes through this challenging terrain.|"[""1. What did General W. F.

The entrenched enemy line ran from the north end of Missionary Ridge along the crest to the south, crossing Chattanooga valley to Lookout Mountain. Lookout Mountain and Raccoon Mountain were also fortified by the enemy. In addition, there were fortifications in Chattanooga valley to complete the enemy's defenses. The Union forces were besieged with the enemy having superior fortifications to the east, south, and west. The Union army faced a shortage of ammunition and medical supplies, with the enemy blocking crucial supplies. General Halleck had sent reinforcements to Chattanooga, with General W. F. Smith playing a key role in the strategic planning. Operations were set in motion to secure Brown's Ferry, with General Hooker and General Palmer leading movements to flank the enemy.

General Grant made a personal inspection of the picket lines in Lookout Valley after securing a supply line to the army. Chattanooga Creek ran between the two armies' pickets, and soldiers from both sides drew water from the same stream. Despite the short-range fire risk, Grant rode alone from the right to the left of their line. The pickets of both armies showed respect, with the Confederate pickets saluting Grant. There was a friendly atmosphere among the pickets, even sharing a fallen tree across the stream for water. Grant also visited Burnside's desperate situation, a hundred miles from supplies, with starved animals and exhausted resources.

The Memphis and Charleston Railroad met the Tennessee River at Eastport, Mississippi. To aid Sherman's army, supplies were sent from St. Louis on small steamers, escorted by the navy. Upon receiving my orders, Sherman swiftly halted road repairs and moved his troops to Stevenson, Alabama. Notified of rebel movements towards Cleveland and possibly Nashville, Sherman acted promptly. By November 1st, he crossed the Tennessee at Eastport and reached Florence, Alabama. Sherman's force, including cavalry and artillery, relied on the Nashville single track for supplies. Recognizing the need to support Burnside's troops in East Tennessee, I directed General G. M. Dodge to rebuild the railroad from Decatur to Nashville. Despite challenges like destroyed bridges and twisted rails, Dodge, a skilled railroad builder, completed the task in forty days, restoring one hundred and two miles of tracks and one hundred and eighty-two bridges.|"[""1.

The enemy's troops, believed to be heading towards Burnside or Nashville, stopped at Cleveland. This alarmed Washington due to our vulnerable state in Chattanooga. Urgent messages pressed for Burnside's aid and holding East Tennessee to protect loyal citizens. Chattanooga lacked animals for artillery or supplies. Longstreet left with troops to face Burnside, causing concern. Washington urged action for Burnside's safety. On November 7, I ordered Thomas to attack, but he lacked artillery transport. I assured Burnside of relief, who suggested abandoning territory to draw the enemy away. Sherman's advance was delayed by high water. Plans were made to confront Longstreet and Bragg. Sherman's forces were to cross the river, while Thomas and Hooker attacked Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain.

Longstreet paused at Loudon until the 13th, likely waiting for further instructions as it was the end of his railroad line. He posed a threat to Knoxville while remaining close enough to return swiftly to Chattanooga. The day after Longstreet departed, Sherman arrived in Bridgeport and later met with the writer in Chattanooga. Battle plans were set, pending troop locations. Lookout Mountain's strategic value had diminished. Sherman and Hooker were to attack the enemy's flanks, threatening their connections and forcing a response. Thomas and the Army of the Cumberland would assault the center. Sherman would cross the Tennessee at Brown's Ferry, unseen by the enemy on Mission Ridge, to execute a surprise attack. The plan involved a night river crossing to secure strategic locations. Hooker's orders were adjusted to ensure success against Missionary Ridge.|"['1.

I showed them the terrain Sherman's troops would traverse and outlined their objectives. Despite our concern for Burnside's safety, Sherman had to wait until his troops arrived. After the inspection, Sherman hurried to Bridgeport to expedite matters. By the 20th, Sherman was at Brown's Ferry, but his troops lagged behind due to the challenging roads and weather. Orders were received for an assault on the 22nd. Bad weather and rising river levels hampered preparations. General Willcox reported threats from the east and was assured of support. Sherman's troops crossed the river under enemy watch and successfully reached their designated positions without detection.|"[""1.

On the 20th, amidst heavy rains and reports of battles, a letter from Bragg suggested the evacuation of non-combatants from Chattanooga. Suspecting deception, General Grant prepared for action. By the 22nd, news of Bragg's retreat and movements towards Knoxville reached Grant. Determined to act, Grant readied his troops on the 23rd. The Army of the Cumberland, well-fortified after months of siege, awaited orders. On the morning of the 23rd, General Thomas positioned his corps strategically at Fort Wood, ready for action. As the clouds lifted, signaling the advance, Union forces pushed forward, gaining ground despite casualties. By nightfall, the Union had secured a mile of new territory, turning enemy fortifications to face the other way. The initial skirmish ended, setting the stage for further engagements.|"['Question 1:\nWhat prompted General Grant to prepare for action on the 20th?\nA) Heavy rains\nB) Reports of battles\nC) Letter from Bragg\nD) Evacuation of non-combatants\nE) Suspected deception', ""Question 2:\nWhat news reached General Grant on the 22nd regarding Bragg's movements?\nA) Retreat\nB) Advances towards Chattanooga\nC) Retreat towards Knoxville\nD) Preparation for a siege\nE) Reinforcements from the South"", ""Question 3:\nHow did General Grant respond upon receiving news of Bragg's movements?\nA) He ordered a full retreat\nB) He readied his troops\nC) He requested reinforcements\nD) He initiated peace negotiations\nE) He fortified Chattanooga"", 'Question 4:\nWhere did General Thomas position his corps strategically on the morning of the 23rd?\nA) Fort Wood\nB) Fort Knox\nC) Fort Sumter\nD) Fort Ticonderoga\nE) Fort McHenry', 'Question 5:\nWhat happened as the clouds lifted on the morning of the 23rd?\nA) Union forces retreated\nB) Enemy forces surrendered\nC) Union forces advanced\nD) Enemy reinforcements arrived\nE) Union forces fortified their position', 'Question 6:\nWhat did the Union achieve by nightfall on the 23rd?\nA) Complete victory\nB) Stalemate\nC) Secured a mile of new territory\nD) Forced a retreat\nE) Surrendered to the enemy']"|['E) Suspected deception', 'C) Retreat towards Knoxville', 'B) He readied his troops', 'A) Fort Wood', 'C) Union forces advanced', 'C) Secured a mile of new territory']
The advantage was greatly on our side now, and if I could only have been assured that Burnside could hold out ten days longer, I should have rested more easily. By the night of the 23d, Sherman's command was ready to move, although one division had not yet crossed the river at Brown's Ferry. The rising water made the bridge unusable, but we decided to proceed without that division. Orders were given to Osterhaus to report to Hooker if he couldn't cross by eight o'clock the next morning. General W. F. Smith was tasked with directing the movement of troops by boats and laying the bridge. During the night, Giles A. Smith's brigade surprised the enemy's pickets. By the morning of November 24th, Sherman's troops were successfully ferried across the river, and the bridge was completed. Sherman then led his troops to assault Missionary Ridge, capturing the hill with minimal losses.|"[""1.

Sherman's cavalry swiftly moved after the bridge was finished, crossing to strike the enemy's communications at Chickamauga Station. General Giles A. Smith got wounded during the afternoon. Thomas fortified his position as planned, while Howard joined Sherman after crossing Citico Creek. Hooker engaged on the west side, advancing up Lookout Creek. Geary's division crossed the creek, seizing the bridge. Osterhaus moved up to cross it too. Geary's stealthy ascent up the mountain caught the enemy off guard, leading to skirmishes and enemy retreat with significant losses. The terrain was challenging, with Lookout Mountain's rugged side making troop advancement difficult.

During the battle, General Geary faced tough obstacles as he advanced up the hill, with the enemy directly opposing him and artillery on the mountain top. Eventually, the enemy retreated as Geary's forces, along with Cruft and Osterhaus, pushed forward. By noon, Geary reached open ground on the north slope of the mountain, near strong enemy fortifications. Meanwhile, General Thomas and I observed from Orchard Knob as Hooker's forces extended our line from the Tennessee River to Chattanooga Creek. Hooker's operations were obscured by haze, but the sounds of battle echoed continuously. By evening, Hooker reported a strong position, and reinforcements were sent. The next day, we received messages of appreciation for our progress. As night fell, preparations were made for the next day's strategic moves.|"['1.

On the morning of the 25th, the sky was clear and bright, providing a full view of the field from Orchard Knob. Bragg's headquarters were visible, and staff officers were seen moving constantly. Sherman's troops were separated from the main ridge by a low pass with a wagon road and a railroad tunnel. The challenge was to reach the main ridge, heavily fortified by the enemy. Despite the steep and wooded terrain, Sherman's troops advanced swiftly, capturing the rebel works and threatening Bragg's flank and supplies. The Union forces faced heavy resistance but held their ground. J. E. Smith's brigade charged up the ridge, supported by reinforcements from Baird's division. Meanwhile, Hooker's delayed crossing of Chattanooga Creek hindered the coordinated assault. Despite obstacles, the Union forces persisted in their advance against the Confederates.|"[""1.

Sheridan's and Wood's troops were poised for action early in the day, awaiting the command to charge. When I instructed General Thomas to initiate the charge, I was puzzled by the delay. Upon investigation, I found General Wood, one of the division leaders, engaged in conversation instead of leading the charge as directed. After clarifying the order with General Wood, the charge was finally set in motion. Cheers erupted as our forces advanced, driving the enemy back towards Missionary Ridge. The Confederates, entrenched on the ridge, faced fierce opposition as our troops swiftly overtook their defenses. Despite heavy enemy fire, our men pressed on, capturing many rebels and causing chaos among their ranks. The pursuit continued until our forces reached the crest, securing a significant victory.

During the battle of Chattanooga, General Sherman swiftly responded to the enemy's retreat. He directed his troops to cross the pontoon-bridge at Chickamauga and move towards Chickamauga Station. Meanwhile, General Howard repaired an old bridge to follow Davis the next morning. Morgan L. Smith scouted the tunnel and found only the remains of soldiers. The rest of Sherman's troops were to join Howard towards Graysville at dawn. General Hooker faced obstacles at Chattanooga Creek but managed to ford the stream and engage the enemy at Rossville. Many foes were captured, and Hooker's position extended east of the ridge. Troops from different armies were intermingled during the battle due to adverse weather conditions. Despite this, there was no rivalry as all were focused on defeating the enemy. The victory at Chattanooga was achieved against significant odds, thanks to the mistakes made by the enemy.|"[""1.

Bragg, an intelligent and upright man, had a contentious nature and often found himself in trouble in the old army due to his temper. He was vigilant in catching any neglect or infringement of orders. An anecdote exemplifies his dispute with himself as both company commander and quartermaster. In contrast, Longstreet was brave, honest, and just, defending his rights courageously. He was not eager to find faults but stood up for his rights when challenged. Mr. Davis, overestimating his military acumen, might have sent Longstreet to Knoxville for personal reasons. General Grant, after recovering from illness, focused on relieving Knoxville after securing Chattanooga. Troops and supplies were dispatched promptly to aid Burnside, with the aim to drive away Longstreet and secure provisions from East Tennessee.|"[""1.

On the 26th and 27th, during a crucial moment in the Civil War, General Grant made strategic decisions to save Burnside's troops in Knoxville. He observed the enemy's disorganized retreat from Ringgold and quickly directed his troops to move. Despite delays, he ensured Sherman's forces were mobilized to relieve Burnside. Grant's swift actions and coordination with Hooker and Sherman were vital in the race to save Knoxville. He understood the urgency, knowing Burnside's dwindling supplies left him vulnerable.

During a critical moment in the battle, General Grant felt an urgent need to communicate with General Burnside to offer support and encouragement. He dispatched Colonel Wilson and Mr. Dana to deliver a message to Burnside in Knoxville secretly. Meanwhile, Burnside had taken strategic measures to secure provisions for his troops by setting up a blockade on the Holston River to intercept supplies. Despite facing significant challenges, Burnside managed to stockpile provisions and hold his ground. Grant's forces faced intense engagements, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. The Union forces, under Grant's command, emerged victorious, capturing prisoners, artillery, and arms from the enemy. Grant reflected on the strategic errors made by the Confederate forces, particularly Bragg's decision to detach Longstreet and weaken his own position.

The chances are that our casualties were higher since we were the aggressors. The enemy reported 361 killed but had 4,146 missing, while we held over 6,000 as prisoners. Many deserted, so the accuracy of their report is questionable. There was discontent among the soldiers due to harsh treatment by Bragg, leading to a desire to escape. After Chattanooga, similar sentiments in the South arose as in the North after Gettysburg and Vicksburg. I recommended General William F. Smith for promotion due to his commendable services. Upon lifting the siege of Knoxville, I informed Washington, causing great relief. The President was particularly pleased with the bloodless relief of Knoxville. Burnside's safety had been a concern, and the President had anxiously awaited news. Burnside followed Longstreet to Strawberry Plains, and Foster took over. Sherman positioned troops along the Tennessee River, and I moved my headquarters to Nashville. In Nashville, I prepared for the upcoming campaigns against Atlanta and possibly Mobile.|"['1.

During my journey through the Cumberland Gap, I encountered a rugged road filled with debris and frozen clay ruts that made the six-day ride from Strawberry Plains to Lexington quite unpleasant. Despite the rough terrain, I met many loyal people in Tennessee and Kentucky who warmly welcomed me along the way. They often mistook my gray-haired medical director for the commanding general due to his appearance and the weariness from our travels. To maintain secure communication, I had to ensure that only trusted individuals had access to cipher dispatches. However, a telegraph operator initially refused to hand over the cipher key to a trusted captain, citing orders from the War Department. After some persuasion, the operator relented, but faced reprimand upon my return to Nashville.

After the successful relief of Knoxville, General Sherman considered joining forces with General Burnside to drive Longstreet out of Tennessee. However, Burnside felt confident with the troops under his command, including those brought by Granger, to handle Longstreet without additional support. Sherman's troops, lacking supplies and enduring cold weather, were prepared to sacrifice for the cause. Upon accomplishing his mission, Sherman leisurely returned to his camp on the Tennessee River. Later, he was tasked with distributing forces from Stevenson to Decatur and north to Nashville. Sherman proposed a mission to clear out remaining Confederates on the east bank of the Mississippi, which was approved. He organized troops in Memphis and Vicksburg and planned an expedition to Meridian, Mississippi, to confront General Polk. Scouts provided crucial intelligence, and Sherman set out on his expedition on February 3rd, encountering minimal opposition until reaching Jackson, Mississippi. After thoroughly destroying infrastructure in Meridian, he returned to Vicksburg upon learning of Smith's unsuccessful encounter with Forrest.|"[""1.

Sherman wrote to Banks suggesting they work together against Shreveport, pending my approval. I disagreed with Sherman going but allowed him to send a few troops to Banks. I obtained permission to visit my sick son in St. Louis, fearing I might find him dead. I had to keep communications open despite leaving Chattanooga. I directed Thomas to threaten J.E. Johnston in the south. Johnston had sent troops to Mobile and Longstreet in East Tennessee. I ordered troops to East Tennessee to push Longstreet out. General Foster advised keeping Longstreet in East Tennessee. I instructed Thomas to take Dalton to support Sherman. Thomas faced supply issues and had to retreat. Schofield also had to return due to supply problems. Sherman's success eased my worries. I was ordered to Washington to receive my promotion to lieutenant-general on March 3rd.

The President gave me a commission as lieutenant-general in the Army of the United States, acknowledging the nation's trust in my abilities and the responsibilities that come with it. Accepting the honor, I expressed gratitude and pledged to fulfill the expectations placed upon me with the help of the brave armies fighting for our country. I visited the Army of the Potomac and made arrangements for the upcoming spring campaign. Recognizing the importance of being in Washington, I decided to stay there despite initial plans to remain in the West. I made strategic changes in command appointments to ensure the smooth transition. General Meade offered to step down for someone more familiar to me, but I assured him of my confidence in his leadership.

General Sherman took over the military division of the Mississippi on March 18th, and we journeyed from Nashville to Cincinnati together. I had Sherman join me on my way back to Washington so we could discuss important matters without delaying my new command. The primary topic was the cooperation between his command and mine for the upcoming spring campaign. We also addressed restoring relieved officers like McClellan, Burnside, Fremont, Buell, McCook, Negley, and Crittenden. The objective was clear: defeat Johnston's army defending Atlanta and seize the city. The plan involved Banks moving on Mobile while Sherman attacked Johnston. Although Banks wasn't ready, the campaign's success resonates globally. I left Sherman in charge of reinstating officers in the West while I handled the rest. I recommended General Buell's reinstatement, but he declined due to his rank. Lincoln, whom I met upon receiving my commission as lieutenant-general, expressed his reluctance to interfere in military matters but acknowledged external pressures.|"['1.

During my command in West Tennessee, I occasionally communicated via telegraph at night when the lines were free. General Halleck and another officer advised me not to share my campaign plans with the President, fearing his kindness might lead to leaks. In a meeting, the President shared his own campaign idea, suggesting a strategic move via two rivers into Virginia. At that time, our forces held significant territories, securing the Mississippi River to the line of Arkansas and parts of Louisiana. In the East, the situation remained largely unchanged, with battles near Richmond and Gettysburg yielding mixed results. The Union armies were reorganized into nineteen departments to prevent enemy reinforcements. The Army of the Potomac was central, flanked by other forces, aiming for coordinated action. Plans were made for troop concentration and rapid advancement to gain strategic advantage.|"[""1.

During the Civil War, General Burnside led the 9th Army Corps with over twenty thousand soldiers in Annapolis, Maryland. This corps could reinforce the Army of the Potomac or be deployed to the sea-coast in Virginia or North Carolina. The main goal was to concentrate forces against the Confederate armies facing north, such as Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and Johnston's army in Georgia. To disrupt Confederate supply lines, simultaneous movements were planned, including Sherman advancing from Chattanooga and Crook targeting the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. Sigel and Butler were also part of the strategic plan. General W. F. Smith was promoted despite objections, and Sheridan was appointed to lead the cavalry corps. This reorganization aimed to enhance military efficiency and disrupt Confederate operations.|"['1.

During this time, I was contemplating whether to move the Army of the Potomac by the enemy's right or left flank. Each strategy had its benefits. If we moved by the enemy's right, we would have easy access to every position from the Rapidan to the James River. However, Lee could outmaneuver us by moving his army north on a more interior line. Moving by the enemy's left would prevent this, but we would have to rely solely on the supplies we started with due to the depleted countryside. As these decisions were being made, the enemy was active. In the West, Forrest raided West Tennessee, capturing Union City's garrison and attacking Paducah, Kentucky. In the East, the rebels were also active, capturing the garrison at Plymouth. The situation in the Red River also presented challenges, with General Banks' expedition facing setbacks.|"[""1.

By April 27th, spring was well underway, and plans were set in motion for a significant military operation. Burnside left Annapolis to take up a strategic position between Bull Run and the Rappahannock. Meade was instructed to advance his troops accordingly. Butler was informed of an impending advance on May 4th, with orders to swiftly move up the James River and beyond. Sherman was readied for action on the 5th, while Sigel in Winchester was directed to coordinate his movements with the others. The strategy aimed to avoid unnecessary loss of life by engaging the enemy outside their heavily fortified positions. By moving troops by water, the plan was to outmaneuver the enemy and secure victory. Regular consultations with military and political leaders in Washington were crucial for strategic planning.|"['1.

During the Civil War, General Banks and Sigel faced challenges. Banks failed on the Red River, losing 40,000 veterans. Sigel's forces, split into two columns, faced setbacks. While Sigel retreated, Crook and Averell succeeded in destroying Confederate supplies. Meanwhile, General Butler made a strategic move towards Richmond. He secured a strong position between the James and Appomattox Rivers, well-defended but unable to make offensive moves. General Barnard confirmed the defensive strength of Butler's position but noted its limitations for advancing. The situation was likened to being trapped in a bottle, with Butler's forces securely corked in.

I am sharing this statement here because, while I have said it before, I have never had the opportunity to correct the historical record until now. I aim to address any injustices I may have caused, especially to officers who bravely served during the challenging times of the Civil War. General Butler provided significant support to the war effort and personally dedicated himself to quelling the rebellion. The Army of the James' operations are closely linked to those of the Army of the Potomac, essentially forming one cohesive unit. Before delving into Sherman's Atlanta campaign, I want to touch on Sheridan's impactful raid on Lee's communications. This maneuver, though not part of the original plan, proved to be a successful independent campaign, disrupting the Confederate supply lines and achieving remarkable results.

On the 13th, Sheridan was at Bottom's Bridge over the Chickahominy. The next day, he crossed the stream and camped at Haxall's Landing on the James River. He contacted General Butler for supplies. Having left the Army of the Potomac at Spottsylvania, Sheridan was cautious in his return as he was unaware of the armies' locations. On the 17th, he began his return journey, passing by White House. Despite the enemy burning the bridge over the Pamunkey, a new one was quickly built for the cavalry to cross. By the 22nd, he reached Aylett's on the Matapony, where he learned the armies' positions. On the 24th, he reunited with the march from North Anna to Cold Harbor near Chesterfield.

Sherman's strategy for the campaign towards Atlanta faced challenges due to troop movements. Initially, Sherman planned for Schofield to advance from Knoxville, Thomas to move to Ringgold, and McPherson to cross the Tennessee River at Huntsville. However, McPherson's troops were delayed due to a furlough agreement, and Sherman's lent divisions did not return on time. Consequently, the armies converged near Dalton. Sherman realized Dalton's defenses were too strong and opted to flank Johnston. McPherson surprised Johnston by moving through Snake Creek Gap. Battles ensued near Resaca and Kingston, with the pursuit halting for railroad repairs. The campaign involved skilled flanking maneuvers, leading to hard-fought battles. By May 23rd, Sherman resumed the pursuit, reaching Allatoona. A week of fighting at New Hope Church ensued, with troops strategically positioning themselves. Johnston retreated, leaving Allatoona under Union control.|"[""1.

Allatoona, a crucial location, was heavily fortified by our troops before advancing further, serving as a secondary supply base. Despite completing the railroad up to that point and fortifying the area, heavy rains prevented the army from moving along the side roads needed to dislodge Johnston from his new position. Johnston retreated to Marietta and Kenesaw Mountain, where he awaited in strong fortifications. Our troops attempted an assault but faced significant losses. Meanwhile, Schofield and the cavalry made progress on the left and rear of the enemy. By July 3rd, Johnston had evacuated the area, prompting Sherman to pursue. Sherman had planned to abandon the railroad but was thwarted by Johnston's retreat to the Chattahoochee River. Sherman besieged Johnston again around July 5th, gaining control of the river and forcing the enemy to retreat across it on the night of the 9th. Johnston's strategies were met with disapproval, leading to a change in command and a shift to an offensive stance by the enemy. Hood attacked the Army of the Cumberland on the 20th, leading to heavy losses on both sides. Hood then abandoned his outer lines, and a battle ensued on the 22nd, with our troops ultimately driving the enemy back into the city.|"['1.

Garrard led his cavalry to cut the railroad east of Atlanta towards Augusta, succeeding before the Battle of Atlanta. Meanwhile, Rousseau arrived from Tennessee, crossing the Tennessee River and making a raid into Alabama. Facing pressure, he struck the railroad behind Sherman, reporting to him. The Battle of Atlanta, on the 22nd, saw preparations to flank the enemy out of position. Troops moved east to the road between Decatur and Atlanta, fortifying lines. On the 27th, a right flank movement began, with Logan resisting enemy assaults. By the 28th, the enemy withdrew into the town, leaving Sherman's army close to Confederate lines. In late July, Stoneman was sent to destroy railroads south of Macon and release prisoners at Andersonville, but the attempt failed. Stoneman surrendered with a small force after inflicting damage on the enemy.|"[""1.

In August, General Sherman faced challenges during the Civil War campaign. Attempts to reach the railroad on the right failed, causing communication issues. Meanwhile, Wheeler disrupted Sherman's supply lines. Kilpatrick's successful mission around Confederate lines had little impact. Sherman then planned a strategic flank movement towards Atlanta, engaging in battle with Hardee. Eventually, Hardee retreated, allowing Sherman to occupy Atlanta. The campaign, lasting four months, was well-executed, with no severe criticisms. Troops settled in Atlanta, turning it into a military base. Sherman regulated traders to prevent exploitation of soldiers. The North celebrated Sherman's victories, influencing the 1864 election. The campaign showcased effective leadership and military strategy.|"[""1.

Shortly after midnight on May 3rd-4th, the Army of the Potomac departed from its position north of Rapidan to embark on a significant campaign. This campaign aimed to seize the Confederate capital and defeat the defending army. The endeavor was marked by intense fighting and was not swiftly achieved. Both armies had been engaged in fierce battles for three years with substantial losses. The Confederates had ambitions beyond defending their capital, having previously sought to capture northern cities. The campaign ahead was projected to be the bloodiest yet, but it was expected to yield decisive results within a year. The Army of the Potomac, led by several corps and cavalry divisions, carried ample supplies for the challenging journey through difficult terrain and dense forests. The initial crossing of the rivers was successful, catching the enemy off guard and setting the stage for the arduous campaign ahead.|['1.

Burnside, along with the 9th corps, stayed behind in Warrenton to safeguard the railroad from Bull Run onward, ensuring control of it if crossing the Rapidan took longer. He was directed to move forward immediately upon receiving word of the army's successful crossing. The terrain was heavily wooded at all crossing points and throughout the battlefields. The area had narrow, poor roads, ideal for defense. There were two main roads from Orange Court House to the battlefields: the Orange Court House Plank Road and the Orange Turnpike. Lee's headquarters were at Orange Court House, offering him strategic advantages. As infantry crossed, cavalry divisions advanced towards Wilderness Tavern and Parker's store. The quartermaster's corps was efficiently organized, ensuring essential supplies reached the troops promptly. Marked wagons facilitated quick identification and distribution of provisions.|"[""1.

After leaving Culpeper Court House, all troops were set in motion. I crossed the Rapidan ahead of Sedgwick's corps and set up headquarters in a deserted house near the river. Orders were given to reduce baggage, but I saw new blankets and overcoats discarded along the road. Lee's pickets noticed the Army of the Potomac moving early on May 4th, but Lee only learned our route by the afternoon. Lee ordered Hill, Ewell, and Longstreet to attack us. Warren discovered the enemy at six o'clock and was ordered to prepare for an attack. Burnside, not under Meade's command, crossed the Rapidan promptly. I informed Meade of the enemy's proximity and moved headquarters to him. Warren attacked with some success, and Hancock was directed to support Getty. Getty was isolated for a while, and Wilson's cavalry was cut off. Hancock struggled to position his troops due to the terrain. At four o'clock, he was ordered to attack.|"[""1.

During the Civil War battle, General Hancock swiftly deployed divisions under Birney and Mott, along with brigades led by Carroll and Owen, to reinforce General Getty, saving the day. Despite sustaining injuries, Getty and Carroll valiantly stayed on the battlefield. Tragically, the brave brigade commander Alexander Hays, known for his gallantry, perished. Meanwhile, Sheridan's cavalry under Gregg clashed with a larger force led by General Rosser but managed to turn the tide. Anticipating Longstreet's imminent arrival, General Grant ordered an early assault at 4:30 a.m., modified to 5 a.m. at Meade's request. The Union forces, including Wadsworth and Burnside, prepared to engage the enemy, with strategic movements to outmaneuver Lee's army. Despite Lee's attempts to delay the battle, the Union forces emerged victorious after a fierce hour-long fight.|"['1. What action did General Hancock take during the Civil War battle?\nA.

During the Civil War, General Hancock made strategic moves to counter the Confederate forces. Sheridan's successful attack on the enemy's cavalry helped secure the left flank. Meanwhile, Hancock reinforced his position after hearing firing between Sheridan and Stuart. Troops approaching were later revealed to be convalescents, not enemy forces. Burnside was delayed due to dense forests, missing the morning engagement. In a fierce battle, Longstreet attacked Hancock, causing chaos. Despite Wadsworth's death, Hancock's brigade fought bravely. Lee's failed attempt to rally his men led to a Confederate retreat. Hancock's forces repelled the enemy, with Carroll's brigade driving them back.

Lee faced distress as his troops were in disarray, and his attempts to restore order failed. If we had known this sooner, we could have seized the opportunity for a major victory. While Lee withdrew his troops, I canceled the order for Hancock to attack due to low ammunition. Burnside, Sedgwick, and Warren continued assaults to prevent enemy reinforcements. Sedgwick's right was vulnerable, and Early exploited this, causing confusion and capturing prisoners. Lee's army retreated to their defenses, avoiding battle on the 7th. The Battle of the Wilderness showcased intense fighting, with both sides gaining and losing advantages. Despite heavy losses, successfully uniting the army after crossing a river was considered a victory. The Confederates likely suffered severe losses too.|"['1.

During the Civil War, the Army of the Potomac swiftly fortified their positions by digging ditches and stacking logs or rails for protection. They were skilled at constructing defenses even in the face of the enemy. The telegraph and signal corps played a crucial role in communication. Insulated wires wound on reels were carried by two men and a mule, ensuring messages could be transmitted even in adverse conditions. Each division, corps, and army had wagons equipped with telegraph operators and instruments. The signal service used high points to communicate movements through visual signals. The men were adept at intercepting and translating enemy signals, providing valuable intelligence. The telegraph wires were quickly set up by attaching them to poles, ensuring rapid communication between army headquarters.|['1.

On the 7th in the afternoon, I got news from Washington about Sherman's probable attack on Johnston. Meanwhile, Butler had taken City Point by surprise on the 5th. To counter Lee's potential move towards Richmond, I ordered a left flank maneuver. Preparations were made for a night march to Spottsylvania C. H. with one corps, Todd's Tavern with another, and the intersection of Piney Branch and Spottsylvania road with the road from Alsop's to Old Court House. Trains were to advance early to the Ny River. I suggested leaving Hancock until Warren passed, with Burnside moving to Piney Branch Church and Sedgwick along the pike. Sheridan's fight at Todd's Tavern opened the way for our troops. Warren and Sedgwick withdrew from the enemy's front, and we proceeded south, met with enthusiasm by Hancock's men. A road fork led us astray, but Colonel Comstock steered us clear of enemy lines. Ultimately, Lee reached Spottsylvania before us due to a misinterpretation of our movements.|"[""1.

Sheridan's cavalry engaged in significant fighting on the afternoon of the 7th at Todd's Tavern, successfully holding the field by nightfall. Orders were given to seize Spottsylvania and secure the bridge over the Po River to hinder Lee's troops. However, changes in orders by Meade led to missed opportunities to delay the Confederate forces. Wilson's cavalry division captured the town but couldn't withstand the Confederate corps due to the altered orders. Warren attempted to assault Anderson's entrenched position but was initially repulsed. Efforts to reinforce Warren were delayed, impacting the coordinated attack. Warren's strategic challenges included overthinking orders and micromanaging divisions. Lee's misjudgment of the Union army's movements allowed for strategic advantages.

During the Civil War, General Grant faced strategic decisions that could change the course of battles. One night, he considered a left flank movement that could have put General Hancock in the lead, giving them an earlier start and possibly crushing the enemy's forces. However, Grant chose a tactical approach to keep his troops together and fortified against potential assaults. The Mattapony River played a crucial geographic role in the region, with various streams and ridges affecting troop movements. Despite facing challenges like narrow, deep rivers and wooded terrains, Grant's careful planning and understanding of his commanders' strengths helped maintain strategic positions and defend against enemy attacks.

By midday on the 9th of May, the armies were positioned as follows: Lee's forces formed a semicircle facing north, northwest, and northeast, enclosing the town. Anderson was on Lee's left, extending towards the Po River, followed by Ewell and then Early. Warren held our right flank, guarding the roads converging at Spottsylvania; Sedgwick was to Warren's left, with Burnside on the far left. Hancock's corps, initially at Todd's Tavern, was ordered to join Warren's right after Early's departure. Hancock's troops crossed the Po River, aiming to flank the enemy. Despite facing rebel sharpshooters, Hancock's forces built bridges over the Po during the night. Lee reinforced his left in response, prompting an attack by Warren and Wright's corps, commanded by Hancock, on the enemy's center. Hancock's attempt to cross the Po was abandoned due to enemy entrenchments and artillery positions. Lee's weakened line led to a successful repulsion of enemy attacks by Barlow's division, with Birney providing cover. Stevenson was killed during the engagement.|"[""1.

Between the lines, where Warren planned to attack, there was a deep ravine filled with thick trees and bushes, making it nearly impossible to pass through. The slopes on either side were also covered with dense forest. Before noon, Warren checked his front twice, first with one division and then with two. Despite being pushed back both times, he gathered valuable information about the terrain and recommended the assault. Meanwhile, Wright scouted his front and advanced significantly. He organized a storming party of twelve regiments led by Colonel Emory Upton. The assault began around four in the afternoon, with Warren's and Wright's corps, along with Mott's division from Hancock's corps, moving together. The battle was intense, with the forest concealing much of the action. Warren suffered heavy losses but managed to regroup without being pursued. Upton's party made significant gains, capturing guns and prisoners, but lacked support from Mott. Despite setbacks, Upton's bravery earned him a promotion to brigadier-general. Burnside, on the left, unknowingly gained ground near Spotsylvania Court House, but the missed communication caused a strategic setback.|"['1.

The foe did not venture out of their line to pursue their advantage, except when attacking Barlow, who bravely repelled them twice despite being outnumbered. Barlow withdrew his troops in the face of the enemy's larger force. After six days of intense fighting, the outcome is mostly in our favor, though both sides have suffered significant losses. We mourn the loss of eleven general officers and around twenty thousand men. We have taken over four thousand prisoners, while the enemy has captured only a few stragglers. Reinforcements will boost morale, and I eagerly await their arrival. General Butler's cavalry has successfully disrupted the enemy's supply lines, and Sheridan has dealt a severe blow to Lee's forces.

Lee's victory was crucial, but he couldn't let us keep the position. He tried hard to retake it. Troops from his left attacked Hancock fiercely, making him retreat slowly while facing the enemy, causing heavy losses. Wright joined Hancock, despite being wounded, and held the line until early morning. Warren was slow to act, prompting me to give Meade orders to replace him if he didn't move quickly. Despite Lee's repeated assaults, we held our ground. The fighting continued until the next morning, with our troops enduring 20 hours under fire. Lee entrenched himself and suffered heavy losses. No whole unit was captured on our side. Warren's corps was split up, and rations were given to a Union-supporting lady.|"[""1.

On the 13th, there was only minor skirmishing between Mott's division and the enemy. I was concerned that Lee might be on the move, but it turned out he was just adjusting his position. Our fallen soldiers were laid to rest that day. Mott's division was downsized and placed under Birney's division. I recommended several promotions, including Sherman and Meade for Major-General in the regular army. The night of the 13th, Warren and Wright were repositioned to Burnside's left. The weather was harsh, with heavy rain making the roads nearly impassable. By the 14th, our line shifted east of the Court House without significant fighting. Lee adjusted to face our new front by the 15th. Hancock was ready for action. News arrived of successful missions by Butler, Averill, Sherman, and Sheridan. Despite the rain halting operations, our army remained confident.|"[""1.

The roads were in bad shape on the 17th, so no action was taken. Hancock and Wright planned a night march to their old positions and a dawn attack, but Lee's troops arrived in time to defend their line, leading to an unsuccessful assault. The news on the 18th was disheartening as Sigel suffered defeat at New Market and Banks in Louisiana. Hunter was suggested to replace Sigel. Butler was pushed back from Drury's Bluff, and Banks was relieved in Louisiana. Despite setbacks, a left flank movement towards Richmond was ordered for the 19th. Reinforcements had not arrived except for six thousand raw troops under Brigadier General Robert O. Tyler. Tyler's troops bravely held their ground against Ewell's attack until reinforced. Warren's attempt to flank Ewell was feeble, allowing Ewell to retreat with minimal losses. The order for a left flank march was canceled due to enemy attacks. General Ferrero's colored troops guarded the supply route, preventing the enemy from capturing wagons.|"[""1.

Due to recent setbacks, General Lee's forces were significantly reinforced. Troops under Beauregard were redirected to support Lee as the Confederate capital faced threats. With Butler's retreat and Sigel's defeat, additional troops were made available. Recognizing the burden of excessive artillery, I ordered over a hundred pieces to be sent back, streamlining our march. Anticipating Lee's tactics, I strategized to lure him out of his defenses by exposing a corps, allowing for a decisive counterattack. Our advance towards Richmond saw Hancock and Burnside moving to strategic positions, with Warren securing key locations. As we navigated unfamiliar territory, engineer and staff officers played a crucial role in guiding us. Despite encountering Pickett's division reinforcements, our forces swiftly neutralized the threat, showcasing our strategic prowess.|"['1.

Lee missed a chance to strike at the Army of the Potomac due to his misinterpretation of their movements. Burnside and Wright's corps faced minor attacks but were able to repel them. Orders were given for the corps to march at five A.M. the next day and scout the enemy's location. The 5th and 6th corps were to head towards Beaver Dam Station and Jericho Bridge. The 2nd corps was to move to Chesterfield Ford, and the 9th corps to Jericho Bridge. Warren's corps crossed the river at Jericho Ford, facing resistance from Hill's corps, but managed to repel the enemy. Wright's corps reinforced Warren. Hancock's corps captured the North Anna River bridge, securing it after a quick charge. Several prisoners were taken, and the enemy retreated. Hancock crossed the bridge the next morning.|"[""1.

During the Civil War, General Burnside's corps attempted to cross the North Anna River but faced challenges due to Confederate defenses. Hancock's corps successfully crossed to the south side, while Wright's corps took position to the right of Warren's corps. The Union forces destroyed the railroad in the rear to hinder Confederate movements. Lee's Confederate army, with its center at Ox Ford, posed a formidable defense. Despite attempts to cross the river, Union brigades found the enemy too strong. A new ford was discovered between Ox Ford and Jericho, allowing for additional crossings. Crittenden engaged Hill's corps and suffered heavy losses but joined Warren's corps safely. Lee received reinforcements, including troops from Richmond and North Carolina, yet chose not to attack the Union forces. General Grant and his staff observed these events from a plantation house porch, where a humorous exchange with a local lady lightened the tense atmosphere.|"[""1.

On the 25th, I ordered Hunter to move through the Valley of Virginia, cross the Blue Ridge to Charlottesville, and possibly reach Lynchburg. Meanwhile, news came that Lee was retreating to Richmond, which turned out false. I aimed to position ourselves between Lee and Richmond by shifting our supplies to White House on the Pamunkey River. Sheridan rejoined the Army of the Potomac. On the 26th, I informed Washington of our strategy, shifting our base to White House and directing Smith's corps to join us. I instructed Warren and Wright to withdraw non-essential artillery and teams discreetly. The cavalry would secure key points along the river. Troops would march to Hanover Town under cover of night, with Hancock's corps ready to follow suit. The plan was to outmaneuver Lee and reach the James River.|"[""1.

Wilson's cavalry, under the cover of night, executed a strategic manoeuvre to deceive Lee's army. This allowed the Union troops to secure a position south of the Pamunkey River. Sheridan's cavalry, along with infantry under General Russell, crossed the river with minimal losses. Warren's and Wright's corps, followed by Burnside and Hancock, moved via different roads. Lee was misled by the Union forces' movements, believing an attack from the left flank. The troops faced challenging terrains with numerous streams and swamps. The army successfully crossed to the north side, except for Burnside's corps left temporarily to guard the wagon train. The troops formed a defensive line south of the river, prepared to confront the enemy. Sheridan's reconnaissance towards Mechanicsville encountered Confederate cavalry, resulting in a successful assault with both sides suffering casualties.

On the 29th, a thorough search was conducted to locate Lee's troops. Wright's corps moved towards Hanover Court House, Hancock's towards Totopotomoy Creek, and Warren's on the Shady Grove Church Road. Burnside remained in reserve. Progress was made with minimal fighting. Sheridan was dispatched to intercept a potential flanking maneuver. The next day, Hancock encountered strong enemy fortifications at Totopotomoy, with Wright and Burnside adjusting positions accordingly. Skirmishes occurred, and Warren faced a fierce attack from Early, whom he repelled. General Smith's forces were set to disembark at the White House and advance up the Pamunkey River. Precautions were taken to prevent enemy interference with Smith's movement. Sheridan was directed to monitor enemy activities near Cold Harbor, while Wilson was tasked with disrupting the Virginia Central Railroad. Sheridan successfully captured Old Cold Harbor after a challenging battle, despite facing overwhelming enemy forces.|"[""1.

Wright's corps received orders to march to Cold Harbor, arriving at 9 o'clock on June 1st due to the dark night and long distance. The enemy made unsuccessful assaults on Sheridan before Wright's arrival. Smith, directed to Cold Harbor, mistakenly went to Newcastle, reaching the destination late with tired men. Lee anticipated Wright's move to the left and Anderson was seen moving along Warren's front. Warren's delayed attack allowed the enemy to fortify. Wright and Smith made a successful assault in the afternoon, capturing rifle-pits and prisoners. Warren repulsed enemy attacks while Hancock was moved to the left. Wilson returned from a raid, damaging the Virginia Central Railroad. The rebels quickly repaired the damage, illustrating their expertise in such situations.|"['1.

During the night, Lee adjusted his left to align with our forces, creating a continuous line from Totopotomoy to New Cold Harbor. My lines stretched from Bethesda Church through Old Cold Harbor to the Chickahominy, guarded on the right by cavalry. An attack was planned for the 3rd, led by Hancock, Wright, and Smith's corps, with Warren and Burnside supporting. The assault began at half-past four in the morning. Barlow advanced vigorously, capturing enemy positions and prisoners. Gibbon faced challenging terrain but gained ground. Wright and Smith's corps took outer rifle-pits, while Burnside and Warren also advanced. Despite heavy losses, the enemy did not counterattack. By mid-morning, I decided to halt further assaults after consulting with corps commanders. Hancock believed the enemy was too strong, while Wright and Smith saw potential with cooperation. Burnside was optimistic, but Warren was cautious. As a result, offensive actions were suspended.|['1.

The army commanders were cautious about launching an attack. Instead, they decided to hold their positions and reinforce them. Reconnaissance missions were needed to scout the enemy's movements. It was crucial to delay Lee's forces while General Hunter's expedition progressed. To prevent further casualties, a proposal was made for both sides to collect their dead and wounded soldiers without hostility. However, misunderstandings arose, leading to delays in retrieving the fallen soldiers. Despite efforts to avoid conflict, some soldiers were captured due to communication breakdowns.

I have always regretted the last assault at Cold Harbor. The assault of May 22, 1863, at Vicksburg also brought no gain to compensate for our heavy losses. The Confederate side even had advantages. The Army of Northern Virginia seemed to respect the Army of the Potomac's courage and soldierly qualities. They no longer sought to fight them at a disadvantage. The assault briefly revived the Confederates' hopes, but it was short-lived. The Army of the Potomac was negatively affected. However, when we reached the James River, the effects of the Cold Harbor battle seemed to fade. The assault at Vicksburg had more justification due to the Army of the Tennessee's victories prior. They believed they could defeat the enemy under any circumstances. The assault was made to avoid a prolonged siege during the hot season and to secure a well-equipped army for future operations. The men worked more willingly in the trenches following the assault. Lee's proximity to Richmond and the obstacles ahead led to a decision to move the Army of the Potomac south of the James River. The preparations for this move were quickly initiated.|"['1.

The decision to shift our forces was crucial, relying on Lee's lack of awareness of the imminent danger. With armies flanking the James River near the Confederate capital, securing it was paramount. Precautions were taken to avert any threats. Sheridan was dispatched to liaise with Hunter, disrupting vital Confederate supply routes. Hunter's progress towards Staunton was relayed, while Sheridan moved to meet him. The Virginia Central Railroad and James River Canal were strategic targets. By June 9th, preparations were underway to transfer troops across the James River, with reinforcements directed to City Point. The 18th corps was mobilized swiftly, with plans to secure Petersburg if feasible. Essential supplies and logistics were to be readied for the imminent maneuvers.|"[""1.

Postscript: Upon further consideration, I have decided to send the 18th corps via White House. This route will be shorter, allowing them to reach you at the same time while avoiding the uncertainties of navigating the Chickahominy River. Colonel Comstock, who scouted the James River to find the best landing point below Bermuda Hundred, has not returned yet. However, to ensure timely preparations, we will proceed with the planned move tomorrow night. The 18th corps will swiftly march with infantry only, while their wagons and artillery will accompany the rest of the army to Cole's Landing or Ferry for embarkation to City Point without delay. The other three corps will follow your directions, with one crossing at Long Bridge and two at Jones's Bridge. Once across, we will take the most feasible routes towards Fort Powhattan, assuming no opposition from the enemy. The 5th corps will secure the crossing for the remaining troops and can join or follow the corps crossing at the same bridge. Wagon trains should stay east of the troops, seeking alternative crossings if available. Considering the long march to Cole's Landing and uncertainties of embarking there, the 18th corps may be redirected to White House. They should load transports promptly without waiting for full divisions. Recent news of Crook and Averell uniting and moving east, along with Hunter's success near Staunton, is likely known to Lee. Sheridan's departure with cavalry poses a threat to Lee's communications, prompting|"['1.

During the Wilderness campaign, the Army of the Potomac, along with Burnside's unit, which joined on May 24th, had around 116,000 soldiers. Throughout the campaign, they received about 40,000 reinforcements. By June 14th-15th, when they crossed the James River, the army had about 115,000 troops. Besides losses from fighting and skirmishes, half of their artillery was sent back, and many men were discharged due to the end of their service. Both enlisted men and officers were included in their count, even those in bands, hospitals, or working as cooks. The Confederate army counted differently, only including those directly handling weapons. Lee's forces, estimated similarly to the Union's, started with about 80,000 soldiers. Despite challenges like unfamiliar terrain and lack of accurate maps, Lee maintained a strong defensive position. General Lee was highly respected in both the Confederate and Union armies and was praised after every battle, contributing to his troops' confidence and his opponents' fear.|"[""1.

On the 14th, I took a boat to Bermuda Hundred to meet General Butler and plan an attack on Petersburg while the Army of the Potomac crossed. General W. F. Smith was sent back to City Point with more troops for Butler. Smith, with reinforcements, including cavalry and colored infantry, was to move close to the enemy's lines and attack at dawn. I believed Petersburg could be taken easily. Smith faced delays but managed to push through. I informed General Meade of the plan and ordered Hancock's corps to move to Petersburg. Despite delays in getting rations, Hancock crossed and joined Smith, who had already captured some enemy positions. The next day, Meade took command and captured more redans. The assaults were successful but resulted in heavy losses. Petersburg could have been taken if not for the delays.|"['1.

During the Civil War, General Beauregard had been holding his position south of Richmond, urgently requesting reinforcements to secure Petersburg, a strategic location. The fighting on the 17th was intense, with heavy losses on both sides. Colonel Chamberlain, known for his bravery, was wounded but later promoted for his gallant conduct. General Hancock's missed orders could have led to an earlier capture of Petersburg, saving lives and gaining control of vital railroads. The Union forces, led by General Meade, advanced towards the Weldon Railroad on the 22nd, facing fierce Confederate attacks. The siege of Petersburg began, with the Army of the Potomac investing the city. Meanwhile, General Hunter's successful operations in the Shenandoah Valley prompted Confederate defenses. General Grant instructed Sheridan to join forces with Hunter, aiming for strategic gains against the Confederates.|"['1.

Sheridan moved north of the North Anna River to head west and learned of enemy troop movements south of the same stream. He hurried to Trevilian Station to start his destruction there. On the 10th, he camped east of Trevilian while Fitz-Hugh Lee and Hampton were nearby. During the night, Hampton tried to surprise Sheridan, but Sheridan outmaneuvered him by sending Custer to attack the enemy from the rear. The next day, Sheridan moved to Trevilian Station and began tearing up the railroad. Despite some fighting, the destruction continued. Sheridan found out General Hunter was near Lynchburg, so he decided not to head to Charlottesville. He returned north, reaching White House on the 21st, where he found supplies and safety. Sheridan dismantled White House on the 22nd and crossed the James River by the 26th. Meanwhile, Wilson's raid on the Weldon and South Side roads faced challenges, leading to a demonstration by Sheridan in support. After these events, there was relative calm around Petersburg until late July, with efforts to fortify the position. General Hunter, in the Shenandoah Valley, initially succeeded in battles but was forced to retreat due to ammunition shortages, allowing Early to move on Washington.|"['1.

In the absence of Hunter, General Lew Wallace, headquartered in Baltimore, led the department where the Shenandoah was located. With limited troops to face the enemy, most were inexperienced compared to the veterans with Early. Wallace acted swiftly to confront the enemy at the Monocacy, aiming to delay and weaken them until Washington could prepare for defense. Ricketts's division arrived in Baltimore to reinforce the capital. Wallace's forces, joined by Ricketts, engaged the enemy, halting them temporarily. Early, aiming for Washington, was delayed by Wallace's efforts. Meanwhile, reinforcements under Wright and the 19th corps, led by Emory, reached Washington in time.

On July 17th, a few soldiers deserted and reported that Richmond was in turmoil, with General Lee preparing to attack us to divert troops to Georgia where General Sherman faced difficulties. To counter this, I put Meade and Butler on alert, but no attack came. A few days later, I decided to launch an offensive, aiming to distract Lee and capture Petersburg. With troops moved to Washington, Lee could spare some to send West. On July 26th, Hancock's corps and Sheridan's cavalry moved to the north side via Deep Bottom. The plan was for the cavalry to disrupt Lee's lines and destroy the Virginia Central Railroad while the infantry protected them. This successfully drew Lee's troops north. The mine was set to explode on July 30th, and detailed instructions were given for the assault.

In Petersburg, there was much worry about a rumored mine explosion. The enemy failed to stop our mining efforts, and wild rumors spread among them. They feared we had undermined the whole city. When the mine exploded, chaos ensued as troops fled in confusion. The enemy's artillery was slow to respond, and Lee's reinforcements arrived late. The assault was a failure due to poor leadership. Meanwhile, Early's forces burned Chambersburg, leading to a pursuit by our cavalry. Recognizing the importance of the Shenandoah Valley, I sent Sheridan to counter the Confederate threat.

Sheridan had around 30,000 troops, including 8,000 cavalry. Early, with a similar number of soldiers, was outmatched by Sheridan's superior leadership. Early's defensive advantage was nullified by Sheridan's skills. As anticipated, Early faced off against Sheridan in the valley, leading to the liberation of Pennsylvania and Maryland. Recognizing the valley's strategic importance, Lee reinforced Early but not as extensively as feared. To deter reinforcements from Richmond, I devised a plan to threaten the city. Troops under Hancock and Birney crossed the James River to create a diversion. The goal was to avoid a major battle while keeping Lee occupied. Meanwhile, Sherman sought reinforcements near Atlanta, and I ensured no Eastern troops moved against him. Amid these challenges, Halleck warned of draft resistance in the North. Troops were withdrawn from the north side of the James River, but Warren successfully seized the Weldon Railroad. Lee fiercely defended the vital supply route, but Warren held his ground, extending our trenches to secure the area.|"[""1.

On the 20th, troops on the north side of the James were withdrawn to destroy the railroad. They were attacked at Reams's Station on the 25th, losing some artillery but holding the line. The Weldon Railroad remained under our control until the end of the war. Sheridan advanced on Early, but Lee sent reinforcements. I sent a messenger to inform Sheridan, who was about to attack Early. I then visited Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley to plan the campaign. Sheridan was confident in his strategy to defeat the Confederates. His wagon trains were kept at Harper's Ferry for supplies. I asked him to be ready to move by Tuesday, and he assured me he could attack by Monday morning. I returned to Richmond after our meeting.|"[""1.

On the way to Harper's Ferry, I met Mr. Robert Garrett, the President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. He was eager to know when work could resume on the railroad for repairs. I informed him that by Wednesday his workmen could start. Sheridan then engaged Early at Opequon Creek and secured a significant victory due to Early's poor decisions. Early's forces were separated, leading to a defeat at Fisher's Hill. The pursuit continued to Mount Jackson, capturing prisoners and guns. Sheridan then gathered crops and supplies in the valley, destroying what he couldn't take. This victory was crucial as it boosted morale and deterred the enemy. Despite concerns about a decisive battle affecting the elections, Sheridan's triumph was a powerful campaign point. The President worried when Sheridan's pursuit went beyond communication range, fearing a reversal like General Cass's Indian war incident. I assured the President that steps were taken to prevent reinforcements reaching Early by engaging Lee.|"[""1.

On September 28th, to maintain Lee's position, I dispatched Ord with the 18th corps and Birney with the 10th corps to advance towards Richmond to create a threat. Ord moved to Chaffin's Bluff, Birney took a more northern route, and Kautz with the cavalry went even further north. By the next morning, they crossed the river and attempted to surprise the enemy, but were unsuccessful due to the enemy's strong defenses. Stannard's division of the 18th corps, led by General Burnham's brigade, successfully assaulted and captured Fort Harrison along with sixteen guns and prisoners. Despite some successes, the main enemy line held. Our troops fortified their new position, extending it to the river and bringing Fort Harrison into the new line. Lee attempted to retake the captured works but failed with heavy losses. General Meade was instructed to maintain a deceptive appearance of troop movements, while Warren captured an advanced camp on the 30th. Sheridan's forces were reduced, with Wright's corps sent back to the James River. Sheridan's troops were to repair the railroad and maintain a small force in the Shenandoah Valley.|"['1.

The valley was crucial for the Confederate army. Despite expectations, they decided to make one final attempt to save it before all supplies were destroyed. Reinforcements were sent to Early, who prepared to strike Sheridan at Harrisonburg. However, Sheridan had already started retiring down the valley on October 6th, taking or destroying supplies and driving cattle ahead of him with Early in pursuit. At Fisher's Hill, Sheridan's cavalry turned back on Early's, led by Rosser, and routed them, capturing eleven guns and many prisoners. Sheridan then resumed his march down the valley, with Early following. Sheridan was ordered to threaten the Virginia Central Railroad and canal, but the order got intercepted in Washington. Sheridan was then directed to hold a forward position for offensive operations against Charlottesville and Gordonsville. Sheridan, summoned to Washington City, left Wright in command at Cedar Creek. Early moved his troops to the rear of Sheridan's left flank, causing a retreat with losses. Sheridan returned to Winchester and restored order among panicked troops before rejoining the battle.|"['1.

When Sheridan arrived at the front, he discovered Getty and Custer steadfastly holding their position against the Confederates while our troops retreated. Everything from the rear was swiftly brought forward. Sheridan immediately fortified his position and prepared for an enemy assault, which was fierce, mainly targeting Emory's corps. By one o'clock, the attack was successfully repelled. Early, damaged from the first attack, hesitated to strike again and instead fortified his gained position. However, in the afternoon, Sheridan advanced, sending cavalry to flank the enemy, leading to a breakthrough. The Confederate line crumbled as our cavalry captured artillery and regained lost ground. This victory essentially ended the campaigning in the Valley of Virginia. Confederate troops were sent back to Richmond, with only a division of infantry and some cavalry remaining. General R. B. Hayes played a commendable role in these battles, displaying gallantry and leadership qualities. Operations around Richmond ceased for the winter, with occasional skirmishes but no major battles.

In late November, General Hancock was relieved from leading the 2nd corps and sent to Washington to organize the 1st corps with veteran soldiers. The goal was to have a large force ready for spring operations. It was anticipated that Hancock would move towards Lynchburg for the final campaign, aiming to end the war. With Sherman advancing from the South, Meade around Richmond, and Thomas in Tennessee, the plan was to surround Lee and cut off his supplies. Mr. Davis visited Palmetto and Macon, criticizing Governor Brown and General Johnston. Johnston's strategy of avoiding decisive battles was praised by Sherman and Grant. Davis's speeches aimed to rally support and cut off Northern supplies. Hood's retreat from Atlanta led to destruction of railroads, while Forrest and Wheeler caused disruption in Tennessee and Kentucky. Governor Brown's actions, though depleting Hood's forces, helped gather supplies for the Confederate army. Sherman realized he needed to adjust his strategy to maintain offensive capabilities.|"[""1.

Mr. Davis's messages quickly reached Sherman, informing him of the need to prepare for potential attacks on his communications. Sherman, being a strategic thinker, realized the importance of maintaining pressure on the enemy. He planned to start a new campaign, suggesting moving troops to Savannah and Augusta. Sherman also proposed a bold move to control Georgia by taking the Savannah River and Chattahoochee. He mentioned fortifying his position and extending his left to control key roads. Additionally, he outlined a plan to secure Wilmington by landing troops north of Fort Fisher and using naval forces. Sherman sought feedback from his officers to finalize plans. Despite challenges, including Price's movements and supply issues, Sherman aimed for coordinated actions by early October. He took precautions against Hood's troops by reinforcing Chattanooga and Rome, Georgia. Communication between Sherman and Hood continued regarding prisoners and civilian treatment.|"[""1.

On the 29th of a particular month, General Sherman instructed General Thomas to return to Chattanooga and then to Nashville with another division of the advanced army. Sherman's plan was to move towards Milledgeville and then Savannah once he was fully prepared with supplies. However, Hood, operating in his own territory, was moving swiftly, covering two miles for every one mile Sherman advanced. Hood relied on the local resources for supplies, which allowed him to move without delays. Initially, Mobile was considered Sherman's target, but the focus shifted to Savannah. General Dodge, a skilled officer, left the army due to severe injuries, prompting Sherman to reorganize his forces into right and left wings. The right wing was led by General O. O. Howard, and the left by General Slocum, with various corps under their command. Despite some changes and challenges, Sherman's army remained strong and effective, ready to face the opposing forces.|"[""1.

On October 5th, the railroad from Atlanta was severely damaged by Hood's army. Sherman, observing from a high point at night, saw the road burning for miles. Our troops bravely defended the railroad, but were unable to hold against Hood's entire army. General Corse valiantly defended Allatoona with a small force, signaling his determination despite being severely wounded. Sherman realized the need to destroy the roads back to Chattanooga to prepare for his march. Hood, expected to move north, prompted Sherman to strengthen Thomas's forces. Reinforcements and garrisons were sent to Thomas, totaling about seventy thousand men. Beauregard urged citizens to hinder Sherman's advance. Hood crossed the Tennessee River near Florence, Alabama, to gather supplies. Hood's movements raised concerns about the need to confront him before his campaign began.|"[""1.

On November 2nd, I approved General Sherman's plan to march through Georgia, leaving General Hood's troops at the mercy of General Thomas. Sherman set November 10th as the start date for his march back to Atlanta, marking the beginning of his journey to the sea. The right wing, led by General Howard, and the cavalry headed towards Jonesboro and Milledgeville, Sherman's stop on the way to Savannah. Meanwhile, the left wing, under General Slocum, moved towards Stone Mountain. Atlanta was destroyed before the march began, with Sherman overseeing the operation. The troops were well-prepared, with only the fittest soldiers accompanying Sherman. The soldiers destroyed railroads by tearing up tracks, bending rails, and burning bridges. They lived off the land, collecting supplies without pillaging. The troops' ability to gather provisions was remarkable, often returning mounted on horses they had acquired during the day.|"[""1.

During the Civil War, the South used bloodhounds to track runaway slaves and convicts. Orders were given to kill these dogs on sight. In one incident, a soldier grabbed a poodle, mistaking it for a bloodhound. The pet's owner pleaded for its life, but the soldier insisted on following orders, fearing what the poodle might become. Despite these harsh actions, there was minimal looting by General Sherman's troops as they marched through enemy territory. The governor and state officials fled as Sherman's army advanced. The Southern militia tried to resist but was too weak. Desperate Southerners even released convicts to join the fight. Sherman's progress was exaggerated in Southern newspapers, causing panic among loyal citizens.

The journey from Milledgeville to Millen covered approximately one hundred miles. Wheeler, arriving from Tennessee, bolstered the troops facing Sherman, along with Hardee from Georgia. Hardee aimed to gather forces to intercept Sherman, managing to raise some troops. Despite skirmishes, Sherman's advance continued towards Savannah, their final destination. Bragg and Wade Hampton were in Augusta, attempting to hinder Sherman's progress. The march to Savannah faced little resistance until near the city, where entrenchments and torpedoes were encountered. Sherman's strategic use of prisoners to detect torpedoes allowed for a safe approach. The siege of Savannah began on December 10th after securing Fort McAllister to establish communication with the fleet. The city fell swiftly, with the garrison escaping across the river. General Foster supported Sherman with supplies and siege guns. The fleet also delivered essential mail and provisions, ensuring Sherman's army was well-equipped for further operations.|"[""1.

The limited information from the Southern press suggests no major obstacles to your progress. Your mail, previously gathered in Baltimore by Colonel Markland, has been directed to the blockading squadron near Savannah for forwarding upon confirmation of your coastal location. Since departing Atlanta, little progress has been made here. The enemy has been closely monitored to prevent any detachment against you. Bragg has left Wilmington, presenting an opportunity to secure the area. Admiral Porter and General Butler's preparations to destroy Fort Fisher have caused delays in our expedition. I aim to control key routes from east to west by securing Savannah and Augusta or other eastern ports like Branchville. I plan to visit you once things settle. Sherman has returned to Savannah to ensure the garrison's surrender. The city's defenses and marshy terrain made direct assaults risky, prompting a complete investment strategy.

Before Sherman's planned march to Savannah could even begin, he received word that the enemy had already left the city. Hardee, the Confederate commander, had blown up the navy yard before departing. Although some iron-clads and property were destroyed, a significant amount of supplies such as cotton, artillery, and small arms were left behind. After Savannah fell, a blockade runner arrived, unaware of the change in possession, and only realized the mistake upon reaching the Custom House. Despite initial doubts in Washington, Sherman's revised plan to destroy the railroad and move forward from Atlanta was eventually approved. President Lincoln even hesitated at the last minute, asking Grant to delay Sherman's march, but the campaign proceeded successfully under Sherman's leadership. Hood's movements towards Nashville were closely monitored by Schofield, who skillfully retreated to Columbia and then to Franklin to delay Hood's advance.|"['1.

Schofield retreated from Columbia on the 29th, passing Spring Hill without trouble, near the Confederate camp. The next morning, he reached Franklin. Hood quickly followed and attacked the same day. The battle was fierce, lasting late into the night. General Stanley, leading Union troops, was wounded but held his ground. The Confederates suffered heavy losses. Thomas, not reinforcing Schofield, ordered a retreat to Nashville. Hood advanced towards Nashville, but Thomas was well fortified. Despite bad weather, Thomas delayed attacking Hood. Concerned, I urged Thomas to act, fearing Hood could outmaneuver him. Thomas responded he would move soon. Eventually, I warned Thomas to act promptly or face removal.|"['1.

General Logan, a brave and efficient officer, was sent to Nashville to relieve General Thomas. However, upon reflection, I decided to go myself. While in Washington City, news arrived that General Thomas was ready to move. The battle on December 15 was in favor of the Union troops. The next day, the battle resumed with a successful assault on Hood's men. The enemy retreated, leaving behind their dead, artillery, and arms. Our cavalry, fighting as infantry, pursued Hood's army but encountered resistance. After a delay due to destroyed bridges, the pursuit continued to Columbia but Hood had escaped. In January 1865, an expedition was sent to capture Fort Fisher, a crucial Confederate port. The fort fell, and even English blockade runners were captured unknowingly after its fall.|"['1.

I chose General Weitzel from the Army of the James to join the mission, with instructions relayed through General Butler. General Butler, in charge of the region where Fort Fisher stood, had the right to prepare the expedition against it. The plan was to use a steamer loaded with powder to cause havoc near the fort. Admiral Porter supported the idea, and Washington approved. Although I doubted its success, I allowed the experiment. The steamer was readied in Beaufort, NC. General Butler led the expedition, delayed by storms, arriving at Fort Fisher on December 15. The powder-boat was towed close to the fort and abandoned. The explosion, at 2 a.m., had no impact. Fort Fisher, with limited troops, called for reinforcements upon our arrival.|['**Question 1:** Who was chosen by the speaker to join the mission against Fort Fisher?\n- A) Admiral Porter\n- B) General Butler\n- C) General Weitzel\n- D) General Washington\n- E) None of the above', '**Question 2:** Who had the right to prepare the expedition against Fort Fisher?\n- A) Admiral Porter\n- B) General Butler\n- C) General Weitzel\n- D) General Washington\n- E) None of the above', '**Question 3:** What was the plan to cause havoc near Fort Fisher?\n- A) Use a spy to gather information\n- B) Launch a direct attack during the day\n- C) Use a steamer loaded with powder\n- D) Negotiate a surrender\n- E) None of the above', '**Question 4:** Who supported the idea of using a steamer loaded with powder near Fort Fisher?\n- A) Admiral Porter\n- B) General Butler\n- C) General Weitzel\n- D) General Washington\n- E) None of the above', '**Question 5:** Who led the expedition against Fort Fisher?\n- A) Admiral Porter\n- B) General Butler\n- C) General Weitzel\n- D) General Washington\n- E) None of the above', '**Question 6:** What was the impact of the explosion caused by the powder-boat near Fort Fisher?\n- A) Complete destruction of the fort\n- B) Limited damage to the fort\n- C) No impact\n- D) Fort Fisher surrendered immediately\n- E) None of the above']|['** C) General Weitzel', '** B) General Butler', '** C) Use a steamer loaded with powder', '** A) Admiral Porter', '** B) General Butler', '** C) No impact']
On the 24th, the fleet organized for an assault in circles, with the iron-clads closest to the shore. They created spaces for outer vessels to fire through. Porter managed to launch 115 shells per minute, causing minimal damage to the fort. The firing forced the enemy to seek shelter. The next day, part of Butler's troops landed safely under the fleet's cover. They advanced towards Fort Fisher, capturing some garrison and reserves. Butler decided to retreat to the fleet, while Curtis's brigade remained close to the works. Despite the success of the landing, Butler's early withdrawal was criticized as a failure. Porter requested reinforcements to continue the operation. General Grant assured Porter of support and appointed A. H. Terry to lead the next phase of the expedition.|['1.

On January 6th, the troops set sail from Fortress Monroe on a secret mission. General Terry was unaware of their destination but knew he was to coordinate closely with Porter for a joint army-navy operation. They arrived near Beaufort on the 8th, but a storm delayed their landing at Fort Fisher until the 13th. The navy initiated the attack to draw out the enemy's positions, then bombarded the fort. Terry's troops advanced, facing heavy resistance, but managed to breach the palisades. After a fierce battle lasting into the night, the fort was finally captured. The sailors, initially repulsed, provided crucial support later on. By coordinating signals with the fleet, the troops secured victory through strategic teamwork.|['1.

Our victories were significant, capturing 169 guns, along with ammunition, and 2,083 prisoners. Sadly, there were also about 700 dead and wounded left behind. Our losses were 110 killed and 536 wounded. Secretary Stanton, returning from Savannah, reached Fort Fisher after its fall. On hearing the news, he promoted officers for their bravery. Terry, nominated for major-general, was confirmed due to this success. I then recommended him for a brigadier-generalcy, which he received. When Sherman took Savannah, visitors and officials flocked to meet him. The Secretary of War was pleased with the outcome. Mr. Draper was put in charge of abandoned property. Savannah was handed to General Foster. Sherman suggested marching through the Carolinas. I approved this plan as it would cripple the enemy's supplies. Sherman prepared for this challenging march, making arrangements with the navy and troops.|"['1.

General Sherman has communicated with Thomas, who has a surplus force ready to move towards Selma. Canby has been instructed to advance from the coast towards Montgomery and Selma. Thomas's troops will join Canby, forming a column of twenty thousand men. Fort Fisher has been captured, with eight thousand troops stationed there. New Bern holds half that number. Rumors suggest Wilmington has fallen, and if confirmed, Schofield will head there. Otherwise, he will move to New Bern. Reinforcements from both locations will converge towards Goldsboro'. Sixteen thousand men from Lee's army have been sent south, with fourteen thousand potentially opposing. Richmond will monitor Lee closely. Two corps of thirty thousand men can be dispatched to support your operations if needed. Canby will move from the Gulf, while A. J. Smith's involvement remains uncertain.

After the city's capture, Sherman quickly cleaned up the debris, starting by removing obstacles from the river. He then fortified the city with defenses that a small garrison could manage. By mid-January, all preparations were nearly complete, except for gathering supplies for the upcoming march. Sherman planned a dual-column movement, one from Savannah and the other from the east, threatening Charleston. The advance began with the right wing moving to Beaufort, South Carolina, and then to Pocotaligo by water. The left wing moved from Hardeeville towards Columbia, South Carolina. By early February, preparations were finalized for the march to Columbia, Fayetteville, and Goldsboro. Meanwhile, other military movements were underway in Mobile, Montgomery, Selma, and Lynchburg to further weaken the Confederacy.|"['1.

In January, I had a plan for Canby to build a railroad, but I changed my mind. I wanted him to focus on destroying railroads instead. I wanted him to capture Mobile and move inland to Montgomery and Selma, destroying enemy resources. Meanwhile, the enemy was trying to stop Sherman's advance. They sent troops to block Sherman, but Sherman's victory at Nashville weakened them. I sent Schofield to North Carolina to secure railroads. He took Wilmington on February 22. I also prepared supplies for Sherman's army in case he needed to change his route. I redirected Thomas to send troops to support Sherman. Thomas sent Stoneman to South Carolina, causing concern. Eventually, Stoneman moved through South Carolina. I also directed Thomas to concentrate supplies in Knoxville for a potential move towards Lynchburg.|"['1.

Goldsboro is 425 miles away from Savannah. Sherman's march to Columbia on February 17th was mostly uneventful, except for repairing roads and bridges. Skirmishes between cavalry didn't slow down the infantry. Delays were caused by destroying railroads and bridges, high water levels, and crossing a river near Columbia. The city was found burning upon arrival, sparking debates about who set it on fire. Sherman's troops denied responsibility, while the Confederates blamed each other. Despite this, Sherman's troops helped extinguish the flames and aided the citizens. After capturing Columbia, Sherman continued to destroy enemy resources. He learned of Hood's army and Beauregard's command. Charleston was evacuated, and Wilmington captured. Sherman then moved to Cheraw and Fayetteville without much resistance. Clothing was requested but not available from Wilmington.|"[""1.

On the 15th, Sherman departed Fayetteville for Goldsboro with caution due to Lee's nearby army and open territory still accessible to the enemy. Facing challenges similar to his previous march, Sherman encountered resistance from garrisons and remnants of Hood's army. Despite frantic calls for voluntary enlistment, Johnston's forces were limited to around 35,000 to 40,000 men. Skirmishes occurred at Averysboro and Bentonville, resulting in Sherman's troops reaching Goldsboro on the 23rd. Schofield's reinforcements from Wilmington ensured Sherman's safety. With Lee to the north and Johnston facing him, Sherman was secure with superior forces and naval support. Protected by streams and railroads, Sherman anticipated Lee's potential escape and maintained a strategic advantage. Peace negotiations in January 1865 with Confederate representatives were conducted at City Point, demonstrating Sherman's cautious and diplomatic approach to the situation.|"[""1.

By the 10th, he reached Columbia with the help of around two thousand African Americans who joined his forces. His cavalry remained strong as they found enough forage along the way, capturing many horses, including those of Early's. When attacked near Ashland, Sheridan fought back, crossed the South and North Anna rivers, and safely reached White House on the 19th. Meanwhile, I had to plan Sherman's movement from Goldsboro, ensuring he had enough supplies for the journey. Lee and Davis also planned to escape, with Lee launching an assault near Petersburg to divert my attention.|"[""1.

The attack by the enemy was successful, capturing Fort Stedman and Battery No. 10 with all the troops and arms inside. They then moved on to take batteries Eleven and Twelve, turning them towards City Point. General Meade was cut off from communication at City Point, but General Parke took charge and prepared to push the enemy back. With artillery positioned to sweep the narrow gap, the Confederates were trapped. Hartranft and Willcox led the charge to recapture the lost batteries. After securing the area, a new line was established, and the Confederates were captured. Lee's failed attempt cost about four thousand of his men. Our troops later reclaimed the enemy's picket line, setting the stage for a future attack. Sheridan, Ord, Humphreys, and Warren were all involved in strategic movements to target the South Side and Danville Railroads. Sheridan's arrival at City Point marked the beginning of a planned operation set for the 29th of March.|"[""1.

After reading the instructions, Sheridan left my tent, and I followed to chat privately with him. I had planned capturing Five Forks, driving the enemy from Petersburg and Richmond, and ending the war swiftly. However, the Nation was weary and many believed the war would only end through compromise. I instructed Sheridan to cut ties if needed and proceed south to join Sherman in destroying Johnston. Sheridan seemed hesitant, but I assured him our goal was to end the war promptly. Sheridan's cavalry moved out, and on March 29th, we set off despite the heavy rains, which made the roads almost impassable. By March 30th, Sheridan's cavalry advanced towards Five Forks to threaten Lee's right flank. Our strategy aimed to weaken Lee's centre for an assault. Lee anticipated our move and reinforced Five Forks, preparing for a defensive stand.|"[""1.

Sheridan moved back to Dinwiddie Court-House on the night of the 30th, then headed northwest to Five Forks with only his cavalry. He faced resistance from rebel cavalry but gradually pushed them back. Near Five Forks, he encountered more enemy troops and had to retreat. Sheridan requested Wright's corps for help, but it was impossible as they were already positioned for an assault. Instead, Warren's and Humphreys's corps were sent. Warren was slow to arrive due to swollen streams, prompting Sheridan to urge him to hasten. Warren's troops finally joined the fight, with Griffin's division initially moving away but returning to assist. Crawford's division also arrived later and provided valuable support. Sheridan aimed to assault Five Forks before nightfall to secure a defensible position. Despite Warren's delayed arrival, the assault was successful, leading to Warren's removal from command of the 5th corps.|"[""1.

I instructed a staff member to speak with General Sheridan about the issues we were facing, emphasizing that personal feelings should not hinder success. Sheridan acted on this and removed General Warren, which I regretted. At dusk, our troops, led by Sheridan, stormed the enemy's defenses, resulting in a chaotic mingling of the armies. The enemy eventually fled, leaving behind prisoners and weapons. Sheridan pursued the fleeing troops while I prepared for further assaults. The next morning, our troops under Parke and Wright launched a successful attack, capturing enemy positions. By daybreak, our forces had taken control of key areas, securing a significant victory.

Lee made urgent efforts to regain lost ground, with Parke on the right repelling repeated assaults. By noon, Longstreet was directed to support Lee's right flank. Upon learning this, I instructed Weitzel to stay close to the enemy, aiming to separate Richmond and Petersburg. Sheridan, returning to Five Forks, advanced towards Petersburg, linking our forces from the Appomattox River below to above the city. Reinforcing Parke, we fortified captured works and created defenses. Despite heavy losses, we assaulted Fort Gregg and Fort Whitworth, resulting in their capture. Miles engaged the enemy at Sutherland Station, while Sheridan and his cavalry defeated Confederate forces. The day concluded with our troops bivouacking on won ground.|"['1.

General Grant's army had successfully encircled the Confederate troops from the Appomattox River below Petersburg to the river above. Heth's and Wilcox's divisions were isolated, with Sheridan's cavalry and the 5th corps positioned above them. Miles's division engaged in combat with the Confederate forces near Sutherland Station on the South Side Railroad. General Humphreys was dispatched to support Sheridan. The Union forces captured around twelve thousand men and fifty artillery pieces since the advance began. President Lincoln was expected to visit the troops. Petersburg was evacuated by the Confederates, prompting General Meade and Grant to enter the city. Despite the suggestion to cross the Appomattox River, Grant believed Lee would retreat towards the Danville Road. Lee's plan to fortify a position was a ruse, and Grant aimed to cut off Lee's escape route by securing the Danville Railroad. Lee informed Richmond of his predicament, and the Confederate government evacuated the city.|"[""1.

At night, General Lee directed his troops to gather at Amelia Court House with the aim of evading and uniting with General Johnston to confront General Sherman before his arrival. Upon confirming this, I informed General Sheridan to swiftly move towards the Danville Railroad's south side. He reported that some of his troops were already nine miles out. Subsequently, I instructed the rest of the Army of the Potomac under General Meade to follow the same route the next morning. Parke's corps and the Army of the James were also given directions to repair the railroad alongside the South Side Railroad to Burke's Station. This railroad had a wider gauge than our rolling stock, necessitating adjustments. President Lincoln, present at City Point, saw our purposeful movement and bid us success, remaining there to await the outcome. Following the capture of Petersburg, I invited Mr. Lincoln to meet me there, as the streets were deserted post the National army's departure. Upon his arrival, Mr. Lincoln expressed his anticipation of our actions. Subsequently, I maintained open communication with Mr. Lincoln, sharing our strategies and objectives. The President was aware of the planned coordination with General Sherman to defeat General Lee's army. I emphasized the importance of the Eastern armies' victory over their long-standing adversary. The successful Western armies had advanced to the outskirts of Richmond, poised to join the Eastern forces in the final push. I highlighted the potential political implications of attributing credit for the victory solely to the Western armies, which|"[""1.

After I left President Lincoln, I got a message from General Weitzel informing me that Richmond was captured. The city was in chaos, with fires and authorities abandoning it. The Confederate government had left provisions for the people, but the city was deserted without notice. Our troops worked to put out the fires started by the retreating army. Lee's army was demoralized, and many were cut off by our cavalry. General Wright delayed our march to clear the roads and get rations. Despite the challenges, the Army of the Potomac was determined to follow through on our victory. We resumed the march early the next morning. Lee had ordered rations to Farmville, showing he had abandoned the railroad route to Danville. Sheridan was directed to seize the road to prevent supplies from reaching Lee.

At that moment, Merritt and Mackenzie, along with the cavalry, were positioned between the Army of the Potomac's path and the Appomattox River, engaging the enemy from the side. They captured many prisoners and caused the abandonment of some resources. Lee entrenched himself at Amelia Court House and sent troops to gather supplies, but the area was scarce. Griffin's corps fortified themselves south of Jetersville. Meade, despite being unwell, swiftly advanced at my command. I stayed overnight at Wilson's Station, informing Sheridan of Meade's progress the next day, urging an attack on Lee. Davies's cavalry intercepted the Confederates, capturing artillery and wagons, while Meade's troops arrived and Sheridan positioned them strategically to prevent Lee's escape.

Sheridan received a letter dated April 5th from Colonel Taylor at Amelia Court House, showing the Confederate army's demoralization. Urgently, Sheridan requested the presence of the recipient. A scout in gray delivered a second message wrapped in tin-foil for secrecy. Upon receiving the message, Grant directed Ord to move to Burkesville and then west to cut off Lee's escape routes. Grant and his staff, with a small cavalry escort, navigated through the dark woods to meet Meade's army, about sixteen miles away. After reaching Meade's headquarters, Grant persuaded Meade to change his orders for an advance towards Amelia Court House. Lee's troops were encountered near Sailor's Creek, leading to a fierce battle resulting in many prisoners and casualties.

The armies clashed at Sailor's Creek in a fierce battle involving infantry, artillery, and cavalry. Our forces gained the upper hand by attacking from higher ground and the enemy's flank. The rapid firing by our troops, combined with the enemy's westward retreat, led to significant losses for the opposing side. Multiple general officers were captured, and thousands of enemy soldiers were taken prisoner. The engagement began in the afternoon and continued until nightfall, with both sides bivouacking on the battlefield. Meanwhile, strategic movements were made to align corps and cavalry units for better coordination.

In Farmville, I encountered Dr. Smith, a Virginian officer, who shared insights from a conversation with General Ewell, a prisoner. Ewell believed their cause was lost after crossing the James River. Despite this, their authorities disagreed. Ewell felt every life lost now was unnecessary. I decided to contact General Lee about surrendering his army. Lee responded, expressing a desire to avoid bloodshed and asked for surrender terms. I proposed only one condition – that the surrendered soldiers could not take up arms against the United States unless exchanged. As Lee's army weakened, soldiers deserted, like a Confederate colonel who surrendered to me. Meanwhile, Sheridan's troops, marching tirelessly, neared the end of the four-year fight.

Sheridan directed Custer to move south of Appomattox Station, around five miles from the Court House, to cut off the trains and damage the roads behind them. Custer's division arrived on the 8th and managed to secure four trains while three others escaped. Lee's troops, marching towards the trains on the morning of the 9th, were surprised by Union soldiers. A skirmish broke out, leading to Lee's men burning one train but failing to retrieve anything. Custer then ordered the remaining trains to head towards Farmville. As Lee's army advanced, they encountered Griffin's corps and the Army of the James, resulting in a sharp engagement. Lee eventually raised a white flag, seeking an end to hostilities. Meanwhile, Grant, suffering from a headache, was moving towards Appomattox Court House when news of Lee's surrender reached him. Lee had requested a meeting to discuss surrender terms, and a temporary truce was established to allow for communication.|"[""1.

I got your message today while on the picket-line where we were supposed to meet to discuss the terms of surrender for the army. I'm now heading towards Walker's Church, about four miles west, to meet you as proposed in your letter. I just received your latest note at 11.50 A.M. as I switched roads. I'm near Appomattox Court House, ready to move forward to meet you. The Union troops were eager to fight, suspecting a Confederate escape plan, but I trusted General Lee's intentions. I finally met General Lee at a house in Appomattox Court House. The story of the apple tree near the Confederate forces, where General Lee sat, is a fiction based on a small truth.

General Lee and I engaged in a friendly conversation reminiscing about our time in the army. Despite our age and rank differences, we recalled each other vividly. The conversation was so engaging that I almost forgot the purpose of our meeting. Eventually, General Lee reminded me that we were there to discuss the terms of surrender for his army. I proposed that his troops lay down their arms until properly exchanged. After some pleasant conversation, General Lee suggested we write down the terms. I began drafting the terms, ensuring clarity in my expression. We discussed the terms further, including the ownership of private horses by cavalrymen and artillerists. General Lee accepted the terms, and we agreed that Confederate soldiers could keep their horses to aid in post-war farming. The terms were finalized, and General Lee accepted them, marking the end of a significant chapter in the war.|"[""1.

"The highly discussed exchange of Lee's sword and my return of it, along with many other details surrounding it, are often romanticized. The mention of the word ""sword"" or ""side arms"" wasn't part of our initial conversation until I wrote it down. There was no premeditation; it only occurred to me at that moment. General Lee mentioned the dire state of his army's lack of food and forage. He requested rations for about twenty-five thousand men, which I promptly authorized. After the surrender, our troops fired a salute, which I stopped out of respect for the defeated Confederates. I decided to return to Washington to cease unnecessary spending. Before leaving, I met with General Lee again, where we had a cordial conversation about the war's end.

During the Civil War, there was a great debate about the number of troops in battles between the North and South. The South often exaggerated Union troop numbers and downplayed their own. Both sides made errors in reporting. The South had around twelve million people, with four million being non-combatant slaves. They used conscription to enlist men aged eighteen to forty-five. The South was like a military camp, with everyone contributing to the war effort. In contrast, the North continued with daily life. The press in the South supported the rebellion, while in the North, the press was free until it promoted treason. The North had to guard against rebel plots to release prisoners and harm Northern cities. The copperhead press supported the Confederates.|"['1.

During the Civil War, the South was turned into a military camp. Four million colored people worked in the fields and cared for families while able white men fought. The cause was popular, and conscription took all able-bodied men, even the young and old. The South struggled to protect supply lines, unlike partisan officer John H. Morgan, who roamed freely and caused havoc. The North, despite having more troops, faced challenges guarding supply routes and areas not under direct threat. President Lincoln visited Richmond during the war, where he authorized a meeting of a group claiming to be the Virginia Legislature. However, his order was misinterpreted, leading to confusion and a countermand by Secretary of War Stanton.|"['1.

Mr. Stanton was known for his unwavering authority during the war. He was a skilled lawyer and jurist who didn't let the Constitution hinder his actions during wartime. The Constitution did not address rebellion like that of 1861-5, leaving it in abeyance during the conflict. Those rebelling against the U.S. government were not bound by constitutional provisions. After parting ways with General Lee, I traveled to Washington via Burkesville Station, facing train troubles. In Washington, I busily prepared orders and communicated with commanders. Despite being invited to the theater by President Lincoln, I opted to visit my children in Burlington, New Jersey. Upon learning of President Lincoln's assassination, I rushed back to Washington, witnessing the city in mourning. The tragic event set back reconstruction efforts and cast a shadow of grief over the nation.|"['1.

Mr. Johnson's actions towards the South caused bitterness among the people. His strong words against treason without offering reassurances of safety led many Southerners to feel threatened. The President should represent the people's feelings, but many Southerners felt alienated by his denunciations. The North and South had differing views on reconstruction, with the North leaning towards a mild policy. The South, supported by President Johnson, sought to control the nation, leading to tensions with the North. Congress, feeling threatened by the President's actions, passed measures to limit his power. Eventually, enfranchising the African American population became necessary due to the President's actions and the South's resistance to change.

After I returned to Washington, President Johnson and the Secretary of War were alarmed when they received General Sherman's proposed terms. A cabinet meeting was called, and I was urgently summoned. There was concern that Sherman might agree to terms the government couldn't accept. Orders were issued for troops in the South not to follow Sherman's commands. I was tasked to go to North Carolina immediately. I reached Raleigh swiftly and met with Sherman discreetly. I instructed him to inform General Johnston that the terms were not approved and to offer the same terms given to General Lee. Sherman was to handle negotiations alone without revealing my presence. I left quickly to ensure Sherman had freedom to act. On my way back, I learned of the uproar caused by Sherman's terms in the North.

For over two years, efforts were made to capture Mobile, but the city fell at a time when its significance was minimal. General Wilson led a successful expedition with 12,000 well-equipped men, swiftly securing strategic locations like Selma and Tuscaloosa. Despite facing Forrest's weakened forces, Wilson's cavalry prevailed. The surrender of Macon marked a turning point, aligning with the negotiations for Johnston's army surrender. General Taylor and Kirby Smith later surrendered, effectively ending Confederate resistance. Wilson's raid led to the capture of the Confederate president, Davis, preventing a potential resurgence of conflict.

During the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, there was much tension between the President and the Southern states. Some laws passed during this time were controversial but served their purpose. Mr. Davis, a prominent figure in the South, was captured and faced the possibility of being tried for treason. General Thomas, a respected soldier, was known for his commanding presence and the loyalty he inspired in his troops.

The troops in North Carolina and Virginia were ordered to march to the capital after the armed resistance ceased. Garrisons were stationed in key areas to ensure obedience and protect lives and property. Sherman led his troops to Richmond and then to Washington City, passing through various battlefields. The march was well-conducted and had a significant impact on closing the war. The soldiers were hardy and ready for duty. The armies of Europe were compared to the American soldiers, who fought for a cause they understood and believed in. A humorous anecdote about Governor Smith of Virginia and President Lincoln was shared, highlighting Lincoln's wit and humor.

President Lincoln and Governor Smith were faced with conflicting duties. While the President's instructions were unclear, Governor Smith was barred from his duties. If Lincoln had survived, he would have allowed citizens to freely leave or return to the country. A grand review of Sherman's and Meade's armies was conducted on May 18th. Meade's army took over six hours to pass the grand stand in front of the President's house, while Sherman watched from a distance. Sherman's troops, stationed across the Potomac, marched in review the next day. Their appearance differed from the Army of the Potomac, showing resilience and adaptability. The review showcased the soldiers' ability to endure hardships and gather supplies.

During the Civil War, President Lincoln and Secretary Stanton were key figures. It was once thought that they complemented each other, with the Secretary protecting the President and the President ensuring fairness. However, this view is not entirely accurate. Mr. Lincoln trusted his generals and did not need a guardian. He was bold and trusted his commanders to plan and execute strategies. In contrast, Secretary Stanton was timid and often interfered with military operations. The differences between them were evident during a crisis when the enemy threatened the capital. Among the notable commanders during the war were Meade, Hancock, Sedgwick, Burnside, Terry, and Hooker, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Meade, for example, was a skilled officer but sometimes struggled with his temper. Burnside, on the other hand, was well-liked but not suited for leading armies.|"[""1.

During the Civil War, I had limited contact with General Hooker, but I had known him well before. At the battle of Chattanooga, his skill in maneuvering his troops was impressive, yet I found him to be a risky leader due to his tendency to act independently. In contrast, General Hancock was a standout figure for his flawless command record and striking appearance. His bravery and presence in battle earned him the trust of his soldiers. General Sedgwick's death at Spottsylvania prevented me from fully assessing his abilities, but his bravery and conscientious nature were well-regarded. General Terry, despite lacking formal military training, proved himself through successful expeditions like the one against Fort Fisher. Generals Griffin, Humphreys, and Mackenzie, though competent, rose to prominence towards the war's end. Mackenzie, in particular, stood out as a promising young officer who advanced on merit alone.|['1.

The Civil War in the United States was primarily caused by slavery. Before the war, politicians believed that a state could not exist with both free and slave populations. Slavery required special protection, especially in territories where most people were free and did not support it. The South depended on controlling the government to maintain slavery, even as their power declined. They passed laws like the Fugitive Slave Law, forcing Northerners to assist in capturing runaway slaves. The North eventually rejected this, leading to tensions. The war, though devastating, ultimately helped the country progress and solidify its republican institutions. European nations, threatened by America's growth, tried to hinder its development, but the U.S. emerged stronger and more respected on the global stage.|"['1.

During the conflict in Mexico, most countries withdrew their support for establishing a monarchy with an Austrian prince. Despite this, obstacles continued from these nations until the end of the war. Following General Lee's surrender, I dispatched General Sheridan to the Rio Grande to assist Juarez in ousting the French from Mexico. The French requested our troops to withdraw from the Rio Grande, leading to negotiations for their own withdrawal. Eventually, the French forces were pulled out by their government, causing the Mexican empire to falter. It became clear that Mexico could now stand independently. To ensure future peace, readiness for conflict is vital. Strengthening our navy and coastal defenses is essential for security and prosperity. Investing in defense not only safeguards us but also boosts our commerce and economy, benefiting our nation in the long run.|"['1.

During the American rebellion, England's actions greatly angered the people of the United States, causing much resentment towards the mother country. This strained relationship was regrettable, as England and the United States share a natural bond as allies and should ideally be close friends. Both nations speak the same language and have familial ties. They are uniquely positioned to foster global commerce. England's governance of colonies, including those with diverse populations, is commendable for its fairness and self-sufficiency. Despite apparent hostility during the Civil War, England's support for the Union was evident. The potential for racial conflicts in the future, similar to the slavery issue, may arise. The annexation of Santo Domingo was proposed to address concerns about the treatment of colored citizens. This move aimed to create independent states for colored individuals within the Union, offering fertile land and economic opportunities. The acquisition of new territories after the Mexican War spurred westward expansion and economic development, illustrating how wars can sometimes lead to positive outcomes.|"[""1.

Before the rebellion, most people preferred to stay close to where they were born. Many feared they would struggle if they moved to unfamiliar places. The country was divided into small communities with distinct ways of speaking based on regions. New territories were settled by people who avoided contact with others, living on the outskirts of civilization. They survived by hunting, growing limited crops, and trading furs for essentials like powder, lead, whiskey, and tobacco. The war changed this by fostering independence and enterprise. People now believe that to succeed, they must leave their old surroundings. The country has become interconnected, with railroads spanning coast to coast. Our nation has grown in power and intelligence, aiming for peace, happiness, and prosperity. The war brought about unity among citizens of all backgrounds, showing that we can overcome differences.|"['1.

The armies in the East and West acted separately, hindering our ability to coordinate effectively and allowing the enemy to exploit their interior lines of communication. This advantage let them move troops between East and West to reinforce where needed and send soldiers home during our inactivity to produce supplies. Despite these challenges, I was certain that lasting peace required breaking the rebellion's military power. I aimed to use as many troops as possible against the enemy, preventing them from concentrating forces seasonally and hammering them continuously until they submitted. The situation at the start of the report showed our control of the Mississippi River and parts of the South, while facing challenges in the East. General Sherman was tasked to disrupt Johnston's army and damage enemy resources. The enemy concentrated forces under Lee and Johnston, with Sherman leading the charge against Johnston.|"['1.

In the upcoming spring campaign, it is crucial to have coordinated actions among all the armies in the field. While it may not be feasible to merge our armies into a few large units due to the need to hold onto the territory already gained, we can achieve concentration by moving armies from defensive positions to the enemy's interior. This strategic move places our forces between the enemy and the areas to be protected, reducing the troops needed to guard key locations. The primary focus for the next campaign will be Lee's army and Richmond. Although combining forces at the outset is impossible due to the need to defend Washington and other territories, a close alternative is proposed. The Army of the Potomac will advance towards Lee's army, while you will gather around twenty thousand troops from your command to target Richmond. Additionally, Major-General Gillmore will bring around ten thousand troops from South Carolina to support your operations. Major-General W. F. Smith will join your forces to command troops deployed from your department.|"[""1.

General Gillmore will be directed to report to you at Fortress Monroe with all troops on transports by the 18th instant or shortly after. If you do not receive notice by then, make the best decision to deceive the enemy about the true move to be made. Once you are informed to move, seize City Point with a strong force, fortify immediately, and gather all troops for the field there swiftly. Detailed instructions cannot be given now for further movements from City Point. The objective remains Richmond, with coordinated efforts between your force and the Army of the Potomac. Stick close to the south bank of the James River as you advance. If possible, use your cavalry to cut the railroad near Hicksford during the general advance for a significant advantage.

The Army of the Potomac started moving early on the 4th of May under Major-General Meade's orders. By nightfall, the entire army, along with a large number of wagons, had crossed the Rapidan with minimal resistance. The troops covered about twelve miles that day, a significant achievement that eased concerns about crossing the river in the face of a strong enemy. The next day, the fifth corps engaged the enemy near Mine Run, leading to a fierce battle. General Burnside's ninth corps also joined the action promptly, marching over thirty miles to reach the battlefield. Despite the dense forest and narrow roads, the troops were deployed quickly. The battle in the Wilderness continued on the 6th, with both armies holding their positions. The enemy attempted to flank our right but was repelled by General Sedgwick. Subsequent days involved more fighting and maneuvering, culminating in a general attack on the 12th. The battle at Spottsylvania Court House saw intense fighting, with gains but no decisive outcome. The following days were spent maneuvering and waiting for reinforcements. Orders were issued for a movement to the North Anna, which faced delays due to enemy attacks. Ultimately, the Army reached the North Anna on the 23rd, with General Warren repulsing a violent attack with heavy casualties. General Sheridan also rejoined the Army after a successful raid on enemy positions.|['1.

General Butler led his troops up the James River on May 4th, with General Gillmore and the tenth corps joining him. Simultaneously, he dispatched one thousand eight hundred cavalry via West Point to rendezvous with him and three thousand cavalry under General Kautz from Suffolk to target the roads south of Petersburg and Richmond.

In June, General Wilson's cavalry division destroyed South Anna River's railroad bridges after defeating enemy cavalry. General Sheridan reached Cold Harbor on the same day. On June 1st, the 6th corps and troops under General Smith attacked at 5 P.M., capturing the enemy's first line of works. The enemy made failed assaults to regain lost ground. On June 3rd, we assaulted again, resulting in heavy losses for us. Unable to flank Richmond, a move to the north or south was considered. The cavalry went to disrupt the enemy's supply lines. General Butler's forces attempted to take Petersburg but were forced to retreat. The Army of the Potomac moved towards James River, reaching it on June 13th.

During the forty-three-day campaign from the Rapidan to the James River, the army faced challenges in getting supplies due to the shifting base. The quartermaster and commissary departments worked diligently to overcome obstacles in transporting supplies over narrow roads through dense forests. Brigadier-General R. Ingalls supervised the efficient distribution of supplies. Meanwhile, General Sigel's movement in the Kanawha and Shenandoah valleys faced setbacks, leading to his replacement by Major-General Hunter. Hunter's offensive strategy proved successful, defeating the enemy at Piedmont and advancing towards Lynchburg. However, due to a lack of ammunition, he had to retreat towards Kanawha, impacting the defence of the North. Despite these challenges, Hunter's prompt actions and bravery deserve commendation.

General Butler received verbal instructions to send General Smith with all available troops, without compromising their current position, to confront the enemy near Petersburg. Despite delays, General Smith successfully captured enemy lines and prisoners. However, a missed opportunity to push further into Petersburg led to subsequent battles. The Army of the Potomac reinforced the area and gained significant advantages. Meanwhile, General Sheridan's successful expedition against the enemy's cavalry resulted in driving them out and destroying their infrastructure. Despite facing reinforced enemy positions, General Sheridan's strategic withdrawal led to a safe return to the Army of the Potomac, showcasing effective military tactics and maneuvers.|"[""1.

On the 22nd, General Wilson and General Kautz led cavalry divisions from the Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James to attack the enemy's railroads near Richmond. They damaged the Weldon and South Side railroads, defeating enemy forces. Despite reaching Burkesville Station and destroying the Danville Railroad, they faced strong opposition. Wilson's forces had to retreat after a skirmish at Stony Creek. Attempting to reach Reams's Station, they were met by enemy cavalry and infantry, resulting in losses. The expedition, however, inflicted significant damage on the enemy. Meanwhile, to counter the enemy's movements in the Shenandoah Valley, troops were mobilized from Richmond to Harper's Ferry.

Learning that Early was withdrawing towards Lynchburg or Richmond, I ordered the 6th and 19th corps to return to the armies near Richmond to prepare for a strike against Lee before his troops from the valley returned. Hunter was to stay in the Shenandoah Valley, defending against any enemy forces moving towards Washington. By the 25th, it was clear the enemy was advancing towards Maryland and Pennsylvania. The 6th corps was directed back to Harper's Ferry. The rebels raided Pennsylvania, burning Chambersburg, but were defeated by General Kelley. Due to unreliable telegraph lines, orders were often confused. I recommended a single commander for all forces in the area. General Sheridan was appointed to lead the forces against Early. The Middle Military Division was formed, and Sheridan led successful offensive and defensive actions. Finally, I trusted Sheridan's judgment and authorized an attack, which proved successful without the need for further personal visits.|"['1.

On October 7th, Kautz's cavalry was attacked by the enemy north of the James River. The cavalry suffered heavy losses and had to retreat, losing artillery pieces. The enemy then attacked our infantry line but was repulsed with significant casualties. A reconnoissance by General Butler on the 13th resulted in heavy losses for us as we tried to drive the enemy from new works. On the 27th, the Army of the Potomac moved, forcing a passage of Hatcher's Run. Despite reaching the Boydton Plank Road, we were unable to reach the South Side Railroad due to the enemy's fortifications. Orders were given to withdraw. General Hancock faced a desperate enemy attack but successfully repelled it. General Butler's demonstrations on the north side of the James River were partially successful. Operations continued until the spring campaign of 1865, focusing on defending and extending our lines and disrupting the enemy's communication. General Sherman's movements from Chattanooga in May were successful in forcing Johnston to retreat to Resaca, followed by battles at Adairsville and Cassville. Sherman captured Rome and moved towards Dallas, engaging in battles with the enemy. Johnston retreated to Kenesaw, where Sherman's assaults were unsuccessful. Sherman then flanked the enemy, leading to their retreat across the Chattahoochee River.|"[""1.

In September, General Burbridge led an expedition to destroy the saltworks in Saltville, Virginia. Despite driving the enemy into their fortified position, he couldn't dislodge them. After withdrawing his troops, he returned to Kentucky. Meanwhile, General Sherman stationed his armies in and around Atlanta after its fall, preparing them for future service. The long road from Atlanta to the Cumberland River limited the troops' rest. Jefferson Davis's speech in Macon, Georgia, revealed enemy plans, aiding Sherman in preparing. Subsequently, Hood's army moved southwest of Atlanta, prompting Sherman to propose abandoning and destroying the city. Sherman suggested reinforcing armies for a march on Augusta, Columbia, and Charleston. Hood's movements towards Middle Tennessee raised concerns, prompting strategic planning to counter possible invasions. Sherman considered a march through Georgia to the sea, shifting from a defensive to an offensive stance.|"[""1.

Your message from today has been received. If you are confident in the feasibility of the journey to the coast while securing the Tennessee River line, you may proceed with it. Consider demolishing the railroads south of Dalton or Chattanooga as you see fit. The original plan was to hold Atlanta and establish a garrison on the southern railways, cutting off the east from the west by reaching the coast. General Sherman's strategy effectively split the Confederacy in two, much like how the Mississippi River had divided it earlier. After concentrating his troops in Atlanta by November 14th, Sherman initiated his march towards the coast, threatening Augusta and Macon. The campaign's progress, the capture of Fort McAllister, and the occupation of Savannah are detailed in General Sherman's report. Additionally, other expeditions were launched to disrupt the enemy's communication lines and impede their movements. General Canby initiated two expeditions, while General Foster sent another to destroy the railroad between Charleston and Savannah. General Hatch's expedition faced resistance at Honey Hill, resulting in a retreat. Meanwhile, Hood's army continued its northward movement, seemingly sealing its fate.|"[""1.

General Butler, who led the army for the mission, was supposed to be the main channel for all commands due to military etiquette. However, General Weitzel, who was to lead the operation, was not aware of the instructions until he read about them in General Butler's report after the failed attempt at Fort Fisher. The expedition was delayed several days waiting for the powder-boat to be loaded. They finally set off on December 13th and arrived near Fort Fisher on the 15th. Admiral Porter joined them on the 18th after resupplying ammunition. Rough seas and low supplies forced the fleet to return to Beaufort until the 24th. The powder-boat was detonated on the 24th, but the enemy did not understand its purpose until informed by Northern newspapers. Despite a successful landing on the 25th, General Butler ordered a retreat on the 27th, against initial plans to capture the fort. Upon the troops' return, it was suggested that the fort could have been taken with little resistance. A second attempt was planned under Major-General Terry, with additional troops and siege equipment. The instructions emphasized cooperation with Admiral Porter to secure a position near Fort Fisher for a successful siege.|"[""1.

The mission to capture Fort Fisher was a pivotal success during the Civil War. The combined efforts of the navy and army led to the capture of the fort, securing control of the mouth of the Cape Fear River. The operation began with a reconnoissance that revealed the weakened state of the fort due to navy fire. On the 15th, the fort was assaulted, resulting in its capture after fierce fighting. The victory came at a cost, with 110 soldiers killed and 536 wounded. Following the fall of Fort Fisher, the enemy abandoned Fort Caswell and works on Smith's Island. General Thomas redirected surplus troops to co-operate with other movements, including sending troops to Fort Fisher and New Bern. The State of North Carolina became a military department under General Schofield's command, tasked with securing Wilmington and then advancing towards Goldsboro'. The objective was to provide support to General Sherman's march north and establish a supply base for his campaign.|"['1.

All requests should be made to the leaders of their departments with me at City Point. Stay in touch with me regularly and send a special boat to Fortress Monroe if needed. If the enemy's movements require it, you may need to leave your base and assist Sherman. In that case, use your judgment without waiting for orders, but inform me of your plans. The specifics on how to carry out these instructions are up to you. Prompt action is crucial, considering Sherman's imminent arrival near Goldsboro'. Rolling-stock can be obtained from Washington if not secured in Wilmington. Railroad workers have been sent to Beaufort and more to Fort Fisher. I visited Fort Fisher with General Schofield to discuss plans with Generals Terry and Admiral Porter. Sherman's army, foot-loose in Savannah, may take months to reach me, so I suggested he operate from there. After Hood's defeat, Sherman informed me of his preparations and plan to reach me by sea. I ordered him to break up railroads in the Carolinas and join us soon. General Schofield moved to reduce Wilmington, cooperating with Admiral Porter's navy. Wilmington was captured, and preparations were made to move towards Goldsboro. The enemy attacked our forces at Wise's Forks, but was repulsed. Kinston was occupied, and Goldsboro' was reached.

On January 31st, General Thomas received orders to send a cavalry expedition led by General Stoneman from East Tennessee into South Carolina towards Columbia. Their mission was to destroy the railroads and military resources in the area. The plan was for them to return to East Tennessee through Salisbury, North Carolina, and release any prisoners if possible. However, due to delays and changing circumstances, General Thomas was directed to alter Stoneman's course to repeat a raid towards Lynchburg instead. This was to prevent any potential raids by the enemy towards East Tennessee. Meanwhile, General Canby was preparing a movement from Mobile Bay against Mobile and the interior of Alabama. The communication emphasized the importance of attracting the enemy's attention, disrupting their communications, and capturing their forces. It was also advised to rely on the country for supplies and reduce the number of guns for the expedition. The ultimate goal was to cut off communications with Richmond before a general movement of the armies.|"['1.

As soon as travel is possible, reaching Lynchburg with a cavalry force should be easy. Destroying the railroad and canal from there in all directions would cripple the rebellion. Some cavalry must stay to handle Mosby's gang. If information justifies, head south from Lynchburg, following the streams west of Danville in Virginia, to join General Sherman. This raid, along with others from East Tennessee, Vicksburg, and Eastport, Mississippi, plus Canby from Mobile Bay, will target Tuscaloosa, Selma, and Montgomery. Sherman's forces in South Carolina will weaken the rebellion further. Overcome obstacles to achieve this. General Sheridan's successful movements against the enemy in Virginia show the impact of strategic raids.

General Lee is expected to head towards Danville with the remaining troops. Sheridan, who was with him last night, estimates Lee's forces at about 20,000, including horse, foot, and dragoons, and reports they are demoralized. The goal is to cut this number in half. The plan is to move to Burkesville and potentially Danville. It's crucial to strike at the rebel armies of Lee and Johnston. On the 6th, Lee was seen moving towards Danville. Sheridan engaged with the cavalry, forcing Lee to abandon wagons and artillery. Ord advanced towards Farmville, clashing with Lee's forces. The pursuit continued on the 7th, with significant success in capturing prisoners and artillery.

General Canby, who was tasked in January to prepare for an advance from Mobile Bay towards Mobile and the interior of Alabama, began the operation on March 20th. The 16th corps, led by Major-General A. J. Smith, traveled from Fort Gaines by water to Fish River. Simultaneously, the 13th corps, under Major-General Gordon Granger, departed from Fort Morgan and joined the 16th corps at Fish River. Together, they moved towards Spanish Fort, laying siege to it on March 27th. Major-General Steele's troops moved from Pensacola, disrupting the railroad to Montgomery and linking up with the other forces, partially surrounding Fort Blakely. After a fierce bombardment, Spanish Fort was partially breached on April 8th, leading to its evacuation by the enemy that night. Fort Blakely fell on April 9th after an assault, capturing many prisoners despite significant losses. These victories allowed access to the Alabama River and facilitated an approach to Mobile from the north.

However, it must be noted that General McCook's division had faced challenging conditions, having marched through muddy roads and fought in the rain without rest. Despite these challenges, the division performed gallantly in the battle, receiving commendation from division commanders. General Sherman acknowledged their bravery in his memoirs and reports. It is important to highlight these details to rectify any injustice done to General McCook in previous accounts. Additionally, commendations were given to Generals McPherson and C. S. Hamilton for their gallantry in various engagements. Colonel Ellet's daring actions, including blowing up his vessel to prevent it from falling into enemy hands, were also recognized. Governor Richard Yates of Illinois visited the army during this time and was provided with an ambulance for his use. General Sherman expressed concerns about a proposed move, emphasizing the importance of a secure base of supplies during military campaigns.|"['1. Why did General A. McD.

General Sherman wrote a letter to my adjutant general, Colonel J. A. Rawlins, sharing his thoughts on the campaign plans and asking for advice on the matter. Although Colonel Rawlins showed me the letter, I chose not to alter my plans. The letter was not responded to, and the topic was not discussed further between Sherman and me during the war. I considered the letter informal and did not keep a copy. Sherman later provided a copy to General Badeau for his campaign history. The conversation and letter were not protests but friendly advice. Sherman put in the same effort to ensure the campaign's success as if he had ordered it himself. I clarify this to dispel any unfair rumors about Sherman. I have included instructions for Major-General Thomas, and preparations should focus on attacking the enemy's position on Missionary Ridge by Saturday at dawn. Specific details are limited due to the lack of detailed maps. The overall plan involves Sherman crossing the Tennessee River, protected by artillery, while I co-operate with him to secure the heights and form a junction. Troops in Chattanooga Valley will concentrate on the left flank, with a division ready to move as needed. Howard's corps will be positioned on the north side of the river for further orders.

I want to express my deepest gratitude to you and your troops for securing your positions at Knoxville and Chattanooga. The citizens of Jo Davies County, Ill., showed their appreciation by having a special sword made for General Grant, known as the Chattanooga sword. It was a diamond-hilted sword with a gold scabbard engraved with the battles Grant had fought in. Congress also honored Grant with a gold medal for his victories at Vicksburg and Chattanooga. General Foster has requested to step down due to old wounds, and Schofield might be his successor. My plan for the upcoming spring campaign involves coordinating all army parts towards a common goal. Banks will finish his expedition, and troops will be relocated. Gillmore and Butler will target Richmond, while I focus on Lee's army with Burnside's corps. Sigel will lead operations against the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. I trust you will overcome any challenges and execute our mission effectively.|['1.

From the West Virginia expedition, I don't expect major success, but it's necessary to free up troops. Sigel must defend a long railroad line and can't spare any troops to move elsewhere. However, by moving directly forward, he can either damage the enemy or force the enemy to divert a large force to stop him. All armies are to move together towards a common goal. Banks is to hand over Red River protection to Steele, abandon most of Texas, except the Rio Grande, and concentrate on Mobile with at least 25,000 troops. Sherman will move towards Jo. Johnston's army and Georgia's heart, aiming to secure the Chattanooga-Mobile line with Banks' help. Sigel is preparing to move forward as directed, with two columns moving south - one from Beverly and the other from Charleston, Va. The cavalry will explore tributaries to establish a supply line. Lee could counter our move by moving north, but our limited supplies prevent us from altering our plan. Forrest raided West Tennessee and Paducah, Kentucky, but was repelled. Gillmore will join Butler with 10,000 men, aiming to seize City Point and advance towards Richmond. Butler's move will coincide with yours.|"['1.

Your mission is to follow Lee's army wherever it goes. The question is whether to cross the Rapidan River above or below Lee. Each option has its advantages and drawbacks. Crossing above cuts off Lee's route to Richmond, but we must act quickly with the supplies we have. Crossing below allows for a base at Brandy Station for supplies until reaching the York or James rivers. Burnside will join with 25,000 men to reinforce you. Prepare for reduced baggage, with two wagons per regiment, one per brigade and division, and two for corps headquarters. Arrange for supplies at White House if Lee moves right, or ordnance stores if he moves left. General Logan reported our losses at 3,521, with the enemy's at 10,000.

To ensure the safety of our troops and achieve victory, a strategic plan has been devised. Directly attacking the enemy's wings would result in heavy casualties. Turning the enemy's right is hindered by swamps and rivers. Therefore, we will cross at or near Hanover Town to outflank the enemy's right. Our army is being repositioned swiftly under the cover of darkness. Reinforcements have bolstered our morale, tipping the scales in our favor. Lee's army is on the defensive, avoiding open battles. We are disrupting enemy supply lines and considering moving our base to the White House. The goal remains to defeat Lee's army north of Richmond, then shift to besiege Richmond. The plan is to hold ground, cut off enemy communication lines, and eventually transfer the army south of the James River.
