Dad is the bravest man I ever saw when there is no danger, but when there is a chance for a row he is weak as a cat. I spect it is on account of his heart being weak. A man's internal organs are a great study. I spose a brave man, a hero, has to have all his inside things working together, to be real up and up brave, but if his heart is strong, and his liver is white, he goes to pieces in an emergency, and if his liver is all right, and he tries to fight just on his liver, when the supreme moment arrives, and his heart jumps up into his throat, and wabbles and beats too quick, he just flunks. I would like to dissect a real brave man, and see what condition the things inside him are in, but it would be a waste of time to dissect dad, 'cause I know all his inner works need to go to a watchmaker and be cleaned, and a new main spring put in.Well, this morning dad shaved himself, and got on his frock coat, and his silk hat, and said we would go over to the white house and have a talk with Teddy, but first he wanted to go and see where Jefferson hitched his horse to the fence when he came to Washington to be innogerated, and where Jackson smoked his corn cob pipe, and swore and stormed around when he was mad, and to walk on the|"[""1.

Dad inspired me with new thoughts about the father of his country, George Washington. I used to picture him crossing the Delaware in a skiff, but now, thanks to Dad, I see Washington as a planter, a neighbor, and a regular guy. I imagine him breaking colts, drinking buttermilk, and even asking Martha for a brandy smash. It's more fun to think of Washington camping out down the Potomac, fishing and cooking his own meals, than at a fancy state dinner. If we had a phonograph back then, we could hear Washington's conversations and maybe even some of his choice swear words. Dad and I had a funny incident at Mount Vernon, but it ended with a narrow escape from smallpox scare. Dad's mistaken for a rich man at the Waldorf-Astoria, and we had an extravagant dinner experience that almost broke the bank.|"['1.

"""No, sir, on the Irish plan,"" said the waiter. ""You pays for what you horders,"" and dad began to dig up. He looked at me as though I was to blame when he told me to order all there was in sight. Well, I have witnessed heart-rending scenes, but I never saw anything that would draw tears like dad digging down for that $43. The doctors at home had ordered excitement for dad, but this seemed to be an overdose, and I was afraid he would collapse. He got his roll half out of his pistol pocket, and then talked loud and said it was a damoutridge, and he wanted to see Astor himself before he would allow himself to be held up by highwaymen. All the other diners stood up and looked at dad, and a lot of waiters and bouncers surrounded him. Dad peeled off the bills to pay for the dinner, gave the waiter half a dollar, and smiled a sickly smile at the head waiter. I led him out of the dining-room, a broken-down old man. As we got to the lobby, where the horse show of dress-suit chappies was beginning the evening procession, I said to dad: “Next time we will dine out, I guess,” and at that he rallied and seemed to be able to take a joke, for he said: “We dined out this time.

If a court ever sentenced me to live in this town, I would appeal the case and plead for mercy. The thick fog here makes you feel like you're groping around like a blind person. People swim through the fog without a care. For two days, we stayed in the hotel, waiting for the fog to clear. Dad wanted to complain to the Lord Mayor about the fog, but I warned him he could be arrested. On the train to London, we had a run-in with a detective who mistook Dad for an embezzler. Dad's quick thinking saved the day, and we ended up having lunch with the detective. In London, we had more misadventures with baggage and transportation.

"Dear Friend,

I received your letter yesterday, and it made me miss home. I wish I could be back with you, playing in the sand and having fun. Here in London, things are different. The people here seem hungry and discouraged. I went to a market this morning and saw how the working class struggles to afford even a simple meal. The White Chapel district is a rough place where people look like they would do anything for a drink. Gin seems to turn them into angry, unhappy individuals. It's a stark contrast to how we see drinking back home.

The Tower of London was an eye-opener. Learning about the history and seeing where the little princes were murdered by Richard the Third was chilling. Dad was so upset he wanted the place burned down. Life here feels somber, but we're trying to make the best of it. I'll write to you soon about our visit to the American minister.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]"|"[""1.

Dad apologized to the man and explained that he assumed the boys had been killed a year or two ago. He then gave the man a dollar, which pleased him greatly. The Tower of London felt like an American slaughterhouse, where many kings and queens were beheaded. They showed us the axes and blocks used for beheadings, and where the heads fell. It seemed that in the past, when a king or queen misbehaved, they were swiftly taken to the tower and beheaded. Visiting the tower made me think about our American roots from the English people who beheaded Anne Boleyn. The experience made me feel hot and stirred up emotions. I didn't care for the armor or crown jewels but was fascinated by the beheading scenes. The Tower of London's history made me think about lynching and burning at the stake in America. It felt like a desire born in our blood that we can't shake off easily. The Tower of London and its history made me feel like I wanted to take violent actions.|"[""1.

On our way to the royal palace, I had to encourage my father to face meeting the king. Initially brave, as we neared the grandeur of the palace, he grew nervous. The thought of addressing the king, surrounded by his court and adorned in regal attire, made him doubt his courage. I insisted we proceed, threatening to pursue a life of adventure as a highwayman if he backed out. Reluctantly, he agreed. Upon arrival, we were led through lavish rooms filled with war paintings and scantily clad women. The English servants guiding us shared a rare laugh at my father's apprehension. Eventually, we reached the king, a humble and approachable man who welcomed us warmly. Despite my initial disappointment at his stature, his friendly demeanor won me over. His smile, unlike the usual solemn English countenances, was contagious.|"['1.

In London, an amusing encounter between Dad and the king took a serious turn. The king proposed that America and Great Britain join forces to maintain peace worldwide. Dad disagreed, insisting that Ireland must first receive justice. The king challenged dad to rally Irishmen in America, promising to vouch for those in Ireland.

Dad is in a terrible state here in Paris, France. We arrived in this town and the people seemed unable to speak, only making gestures and noises we couldn't understand. It's the first time we've been in a place where our language isn't understood. Normally, we enjoy teaching people English, but crossing the English Channel gave us a new kind of seasickness. It's not like the usual seasickness that goes away; this one feels like a permanent investment, getting worse every other day. The boat on the English Channel doesn't just roll or pitch; it does stunts like a crazy horse. The water boils, bubbles, and flows in all directions at once. The wind blows from all angles, hot when you're hot, freezing when you're cold. It's a dreadful experience. Dad was furious when he realized he was sick that way, ready to take on anyone he met once we got ashore.|['1.

Dad strongly believes that not understanding English is a crime. When people don't get him, he gets frustrated and wants to shoot up the town. Dad's solution is to swear at them, but it doesn't work. French people, in his opinion, are polite. They kick you out with a felt slipper and apologize. Dad struggles with tipping customs. He refused to tip, and our baggage was left unattended.

"Dear Uncle,

I am writing to you from Monte Carlo, a place that makes me feel ashamed to put its name at the top of a letter to anyone who believes in honesty and decency. It seems like dad and I have taken all the degrees of badness and are now reaching the end of our journey. Monaco, a tiny principality ruled by a prince, is all about gambling. From chuck-a-luck to high-stakes roulette, it's a haven for gamblers. I'm not sure what led dad here, maybe a new friend from North Dakota he met at a dance in Paris. One night, he went to a prayer meeting, but the next morning, he was dancing with a stranger in their underclothes, kicking so high that he got stuck on a gas bracket. Now they are planning to go to Monte Carlo to try their luck at breaking the bank.

Yours sincerely,

A man from Dakota suggested a scheme to win money at Monte Carlo by gambling. The man convinced Dad that they could break the bank and become wealthy. They prepared canvas sacks to carry the gold they would win. Excited, they traveled to Monte Carlo and entered the grand gambling room.

I would like to share a story about a family's adventure in Europe. The family found themselves in a tricky situation after losing all their money in Monte Carlo. They thought they would have to jump into the ocean, but a kind gesture from the hotel manager changed everything. The family was treated as guests of the prince of Monaco and provided with funds to continue their journey. On their way to Nice, they had a scary encounter when their car seemingly hit an old woman. The situation turned out to be a scam to extort money from tourists. Despite the ordeal, the family learned a valuable lesson about being cautious while traveling. It was a memorable trip filled with unexpected twists and turns that taught them to be more aware of their surroundings.|"['1.

In America, we thought we could outsmart the locals, but they beat us at their own games. Dad even thought of finishing an old woman with an ax for a corpse he believed was rightfully his. The police warned him against such thoughts and gave him 12 hours to leave France. So, we headed to Switzerland, where Dad hoped for freedom like in America. Switzerland turned out to be overrated, with no corpses in sight. Tourists obsessed over climbing mountains, which Dad foolishly attempted. He ended up stuck in a crevice until rescuers arrived, leaving him exhausted but determined. After this misadventure, Dad decided to head to Turkey for an easier time.|['1.

We spent two days exploring Venice in gondolas, navigating the canals when the tide was low and waiting for it to rise. One evening, under the moonlight near the Rialto bridge, I decided to give my dad some excitement. The Rialto bridge, a meeting spot for lovers for centuries, stood elegantly over the Grand Canal. Surrounded by gondolas carrying the elite of Venetian society, the music set a romantic tone. Dad, feeling adventurous, attempted to steer a gondola. However, his attempt led to a comical mishap as both he and the gondolier fell into the canal. With a mix of English and Italian yells, they were rescued, but not before causing a spectacle. Despite the chaos, we continued our adventures, with dad's clothes now smelling like a fish market.

When my dad and I arrived in St. Petersburg, Russia, we encountered a series of chaotic events. Initially mistaken for distinguished American statesmen, we were treated with respect and given back money that had been taken from us. However, as we witnessed a ceremony blessing the Neva River, a battery of artillery accidentally fired live shots at the Winter Palace, causing panic. The crowd, once blessing the river, turned hostile towards the czar. Amidst the chaos, my dad was lashed by Cossacks, prompting him to join a revolution against the monarchy. The situation escalated as we found ourselves suspected by the police and surrounded by strikers. Dad's encounter with a loaded whip left him injured, and we contemplated joining the upcoming revolution.

We believed a revolution was like a show worth traveling miles to witness. Once, Dad witnessed a revolution in South America where a group of men in mismatched uniforms, with non-functional guns, shouted against the government. They acted brave until a soldier in white pajamas stopped the chaos by shooting one in the thumb. Dad expected a similar spectacle in Russia, but the reality was grim. During the Russian revolution, innocent-looking people marched peacefully until chaos erupted. The streets turned red with blood, and the Cossacks ruthlessly attacked the unarmed crowd. Witnessing such brutality left Dad in shock. He found Russia to be the saddest place on earth, devoid of joy. To distract Dad from the horrors, I orchestrated a thrilling sledge ride with a drunk Cossack and a pack of dogs, pretending we were chased by wolves.

In Constantinople, Turkey, a Chicago man and his son narrowly escaped danger in Russia and sought peace in Turkey. The man's fascination with Masonic symbols caused humorous misunderstandings with Turkish locals. Mistaking all fez-wearing men as fellow Masons, he even tried to befriend a merchant's wife, leading to a comical confrontation. The man's antics escalated when he kicked dogs and ran through the streets, causing chaos. Eventually, they faced a Turkish court, where the man's lawyer, his son, convinced the court that his father was a distinguished American negotiating a loan to the sultan. The court, impressed, let them go with a warning about touching Turkish women or dogs.

The sultan wanted to showcase a selection of dancers from his harem to honor the American visitors. Dad was skeptical but agreed as long as they kept their distance. The dancers, resembling those from vaudeville shows, performed before the sultan. Dad was enjoying the show until a dancer approached him, causing him to almost join in. The sultan intervened, and the show quickly ended. The harem, contrary to popular belief, was more like a large household. The women, not just young and beautiful, were busy with daily chores. Dad and I explored the harem, seeing children and women going about their daily tasks. The sultan, pleased with the visit, even offered to gift 50 wives to the American president through dad, which he reluctantly accepted.

Dad and I embarked on a daring climb up the pyramid, but his struggles led to a hilarious yet chaotic adventure inside. As we ventured into the tomb, I decided to ignite my fireworks, causing a frenzy among the guides and tourists. The explosion sent everyone fleeing, and even the Arabs returned some of the money they had taken from us. Dad, in disarray, fashioned a turban into makeshift pants. After a boat trip on the Nile, we faced accusations of attempted sabotage, prompting us to flee in disguise. Gibraltar brought a sense of relief, especially hearing the Irish accent among the British soldiers. Dad praised the bravery of the Irish and criticized the mistreatment they faced.

We left the palace while the king's helpers were cooling him down with ice water. They managed to calm him down after the cayenne pepper episode, and we saw him at the bullfight later. It was quite a spectacle with bulls charging and Spaniards dodging, but it took a turn when a bull ripped a horse's stomach. Dad, unable to bear the cruelty, jumped into the ring to protest. The bull, however, didn't seem to understand and tossed him over the fence. The crowd cheered, mistaking Dad's intervention for bravery.

The Emperor was enraged and told dad not to interfere with German nobility. The atmosphere turned tense, but the Emperor soon lightened up.
