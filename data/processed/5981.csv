On the fifth of August, the once magnificent city of Warsaw lay in ruins after being devastated by bombs and alien invaders. The wealthiest citizens sought refuge in the lower part of the city, leaving behind their luxurious palaces to the invading soldiers. Warsaw, situated by the river Vistula, had streets so twisted and crooked that they resembled snakes. The old houses with heavy doors and shutters looked inhospitable.

A gray haze covered Warsaw, once bustling but now silent and deserted after the enemy's invasion. Citizens hid in fear in garrets, cellars, and even catacombs. Soldiers occupied modern homes while terrified people sought refuge in the lower city. In a dark corner of a building, a diverse group huddled, sharing personal grief amid the chaos. A wealthy boy, a sorrowful elderly man, a weeping woman, a terrified girl, and a wounded soldier represented the mix of emotions. A tall, bloodless boy held another close, his face a mix of desperation and grief. The group sought safety in an underground storeroom after fleeing the dangers of the city, narrated by the boy in rapid Russian to his professor.|"['1.

"Ivan paused, his ornate cane tapping against his boot. ""When the men arrived, they asked, 'What do you have?' The woman, with an evil laugh, replied, 'All the wine, bread, and fire we need for years.'"" Evelyn repeated the words softly, then suddenly cried out. She turned to her father, clutching the package with the dangerous manuscript. Overwhelmed by emotion, she couldn't speak. Her eyes pleaded with her brother, who hesitantly explained the dire situation. Their little sister was likely abducted to be forced into begging. A heavy silence fell as they processed the grim reality. Ivan, familiar with the region's darker practices, nodded knowingly. The others, shocked, struggled to comprehend. The Professor, recalling historical atrocities, insisted such horrors were a thing of the past."|"['1.

"""Ivan, you forget that I am in a position to know,"" said the Professor. ""My researches have led me, thanks to the presentations of your father and many others, into secret records never before opened to outsiders of any race. I regret the stand you take with me. I am unused to contradiction.""

""Pardon me,"" said Ivan wearily. He looked at Warren. In the minds of both boys, there was a feeling that the mystery was solved. There was no longer any need to discuss it. A little search around the house would show if the children were there; after that, it meant that Evelyn was right.

""Well, Ivan's right,"" said Warren doggedly. ""It doesn't matter what you have found in your researches, father; you have had those dry old records to prove everything to you. I have heard the people tell stories that would make your hair curl. They not only steal children, but sometimes they cripple them, just as they did hundreds of years ago in England. Why do you suppose boys like Ivan here are watched every second? Sometimes they take them for revenge, but when they are gone, they are gone. You can't go out with a wad of bills and stick it under the park fence, and go back and find your child on the front stoop like you can at home.""

""It makes sound sense, dad,"" said Warren sadly. ""Europe has been full of beggars from the beginning of time."|"[""1. What led the Professor to secret records?\nA. Ivan's father\nB.

"""No, I do not blame you for anything, father,"" Ivanovich reassured his father. ""It is a terrible thing, but we will find her, our precious darling, if we spend our lives hunting."" Turning to his sister and brother, he asked for their support. The wounded soldier, focused on Ivan, the young Prince, mentioned the workmen's extra blouses below. ""Let these Americans go, Prince,"" he pleaded, expressing his hope for Poland's future. Ivan, determined to find the missing children, shared his plan.

"""Wow, what a great idea!"" exclaimed Warren excitedly. ""We'll need to spread the word to them wherever we find them, but it's our best option, so let's get started.""

""That was quite unusual,"" remarked the Professor. ""There are times when a person is so focused that they may forget their surroundings, like my deep dives into Warsaw's history. But this situation is different. It requires a person with quick thinking and wisdom, and that's why I must go; I'm prepared.""

""Father,"" he began, ""you can't leave. Today has made me mature. We, your children, always bear the brunt of your absentmindedness, and today's events have been the hardest. We might never see little Elinor again, and I promised Mom to always care for her. I blame myself for her disappearance. You mean well, but we also need to look out for you. It's not typical for a son to speak this way to his father, but I have to say it. We've always had to watch over you, reminding you of meals, your belongings, and making sure you were okay.

Professor Morris, a brilliant but absent-minded man, lived in his world of ancient history, oblivious to the love and care his children provided. His son, Jack, finally confronted him about his neglect, but the professor failed to grasp the seriousness of the accusation due to his obsession with knowledge. Benjamin Morris, once an infant prodigy, had grown into a man consumed by learning, neglecting the present for the past. Despite his family's efforts to care for him, Professor Morris remained lost in his scholarly pursuits.

"Warren and Evelyn, who had finished reading ""Thaddeus of Warsaw,"" were thrilled. The ship journey was delightful, and they could easily spot the Professor debating with a knowledgeable Englishman daily. The two elderly men sought each other out each morning, only to be separated at night. Meanwhile, the children relished the voyage, making new friends. Upon reaching Warsaw safely, they settled near the grand Casimr Palace, now home to the University. Professor Morris arranged excellent teachers and reliable help. Warren, brimming with energy, quickly made many friends and introduced the Boy Scouts to Poland. The local boys embraced the idea enthusiastically. However, the outbreak of war changed everything.

On the day Warsaw faced turmoil, a young girl, around three years old, appeared at the Morris family's doorstep. Dressed lavishly, she couldn't disclose her identity or origins. Ivan and the staff believed her to be of noble descent, but her limited speech revealed no clues. She joyfully played with Elinor all day, and come bedtime, hidden beneath her attire were jewels fit for royalty. Adorned with diamonds, rubies, and valuable rings, the child astounded everyone. Professor Morris estimated the collection's worth at hundreds of thousands of dollars, casually stashing them in his coat pockets. Evelyn, however, safeguarded the jewels by sewing them into a belt around her waist. Despite her name being Rika, she couldn't provide more details. As the family awaited her rightful guardians, Rika seemed unfazed, though she occasionally called out a mysterious name at night.|"[""1.

Evelyn felt a deep bond with the children, akin to receiving a cherished doll. Despite the fear of separation, she clung to hope. The idea that the kids might be drugged and taken away conflicted with the wish that they were simply playing nearby. As she bid farewell to two young workers, Warren and Ivan, hope and trust filled her heart. The boys disguised themselves with soot and grime, blending into the chaos of the city. They sought help from Boy Scouts, who joined their search for the missing children. Despite no luck, they stumbled upon a deserted bakeshop and found food to keep their strength up.

After finishing breakfast, Warren and Ivan watched as two suspicious-looking men walked down the street towards the market. Ivan, surprised by something he noticed about the men, warned Warren about the danger and the need for caution. Warren regretfully explained that he had to go alone to protect his father.

Warren stumbled upon footprints leading to a mysterious, ancient building. The structure, once a grand residence, now appeared abandoned and ominous. Intricate carvings of mythical creatures adorned the eaves, while bare windows creaked in the wind. As Warren cautiously approached, he noticed the door, fortified with aged iron and modern hinges. Unbeknownst to him, a hidden observer watched his every move through a small hole. Warren decided to wait for the men to leave before attempting entry. Hours passed, and as he left to report back, a crowd gathered around the building. Inside, chaos reigned - furniture overturned, belongings scattered. The onlookers informed Warren that soldiers had taken his family. With a heavy heart, Warren realized the grim reality of war's consequences.|['1.

Warren returned home, feeling overwhelmed. It was a devastating blow just as he was about to rescue his sister and reunite the family. He couldn't understand why soldiers would harm American citizens. Sitting by the window, he felt lost. His mind couldn't process what to do next. Looking outside, he saw people moving away, but then noticed something closer. Written on the window with Evelyn's diamond was a message.

"Warren was puzzled by the urgent command to ""Find Ivan."" It became clear that Ivan was missing as Warren heard a faint shout echoing through the house. Following the sound, he searched every nook and cranny, from the dusty attic to the vaulted cellar. In the dark depths of the cellar, Warren discovered Ivan bound in one of the old dungeon rooms.

Warren understood his father well enough to envision the scene described by Ivan vividly. He found it amusing that his father's handwriting was so distinct that it would immediately arouse suspicion. Warren also knew his father cherished his writings and would not tolerate strangers handling them. Ivan recounted a time when soldiers arrived, and Warren's father, refusing to let them search his house, cleverly hid a book they mistook for military plans.

The man swiftly grabbed Ivan and dragged him through a dark doorway into a vast, chilly room. The fire barely illuminated the heavy oak beams and dusty windows. Emblems and drawings adorned the walls, barely visible in the dim light. A massive table and sturdy benches filled the space, looking fit for giants. A pile of wood from shelled buildings lay ready for a fire. A woman, resembling a fury from the French Revolution, watched closely. Ivan, once sheltered, learned English from the Morris family. His father, a noble, had sent him to study there for safety. Ivan had absorbed democratic ideas from Warren, the Professor's son.

Elinor, frightened by the man's presence, did not recognize Warren at first. When she saw his face, she screamed, but was silenced by a sharp word. Ivan, the second man, brought in a dirty boy, whom Elinor didn't recognize at first. Ivan hoped for signs of life in Warren's still body. Elinor, initially playing with Rika, had not noticed the family leaving. A woman offered them candy that made them fall asleep. The woman then kidnapped them and took them to a hovel.

After a quiet discussion, the men led Ivan to a distant, shadowy corner and securely fastened him to a ring on the wall. Though his restraints allowed him to lie down, he remained seated, alert and tense. Martha whispered in a tone that Ivan found oddly audible despite the distance.

In the United States, strict laws and dedicated societies work tirelessly to protect children from harm. These laws ensure their safety in streets, factories, and everywhere they go. Noble individuals sacrifice their lives to help those in need, especially children in impoverished areas. Special cases are highlighted in newspapers to garner support and assistance for these vulnerable children. However, in many European countries, children are not safeguarded by such laws. They are often forced into labor from a very young age, enduring hardships and deprivation. Some are even coerced into begging and stealing by criminals who exploit their innocence. Despite a dark past where children were maimed for sympathy, efforts are ongoing to ensure a better and brighter future for all children, free from exploitation and harm.|"[""1.

The day arrived, and Ivan sensed the time to leave was near. Warren, still silent and weak, seemed unaware. Ivan, hesitant to speak, watched the darkening room as night approached, unsure of their fate. A meager meal was offered, but Warren refused to eat. Ivan, fearing the poisoned food, promised to ensure Warren's next meal. The captors, focused on their tasks, allowed Ivan to speak. Eventually, Ivan was restrained near a heavy bench, while plans to take the children away were revealed. The captors intended to tame the girls and use them for profit.

Amid ruins, a few pristine white marble buildings stood untouched by destruction. Occupied by the invading army, these buildings concealed valuable possessions like art, jewels, and furs. The people of Warsaw, regardless of wealth, faced hardships, needing food and shelter urgently. In a lavish dining room, a group of German officers argued.

"The man at the table questioned, ""What exactly do you think?"" He expressed concern about rushing, suggesting the old man, likely a professor from Princeton, posed no threat. The use of sophisticated language made the man suspicious. Otto admitted to wanting to harm the old man but needed a valid reason. Otto's romantic notions were interrupted by the arrival of prisoners. Professor Morris, now a witness to the horrors of war, stood protectively with his children, embodying the harsh reality of the conflict.

War is a place where rules are scarce and responsibilities are few. Despite his education and citizenship, a man found himself powerless as a prisoner with his children in an unfamiliar place. In his mind's eye, he longed for the peaceful Princeton campus with its greenery, laughter, and friendly faces. But reality was harsh, with torn draperies and shattered glass in the room where he stood captive. Facing two stern German officers, he saw his children clinging to him. The officers hinted at his role as a spy and demanded information. The man, determined and defiant, insisted on his release and the return of his belongings.

"""Be cautious, little sparrow,"" he cautioned. ""One more time, and I will harm you! I'm leaving now,"" he informed the Professor. ""In thirty minutes, we will return, and you must choose between death or safe passage."" With a bow, he bid farewell to Evelyn and shut the door behind him. She rushed to the windows and peered outside, confirming the heavy bars on the casements and the solitary door through which the officers had entered. The room, with its oak-paneled walls halfway up, felt as secure as a dungeon, offering no means of escape. As the soldiers' impending return loomed, her father's plan emerged.

The mysterious girl signaled for silence with a finger to her lips, then motioned for them to follow her down a secret passage hidden behind a carved rosette in an oak panel. As they tiptoed through the stone passage, she closed the entrance behind them with an iron grating. Evelyn, gripping a revolver, followed closely, with the Professor clutching his manuscript and Jack bringing up the rear. The passage twisted and turned, passing near rooms filled with soldiers, their laughter echoing faintly. The girl used a flashlight to guide them down a steep flight of stairs, cautioning them to be careful. They entered a stone chamber with minimal furniture before proceeding through more rooms filled with casks. Eventually, they navigated a narrow passage until the girl revealed a hidden staircase behind a sliding stone.

The Princess was distraught when her baby disappeared in a crowd. Frantically searching all night, she was brought home through a secret passage. The building was safe from war damage, well-lit with its own electric system. The secret passage was revealed by the Prince, who had learned it from his father. Modjeska, a brave soul, ventured through dark passages to help. The Princess, anxious but hopeful, awaited news of her baby.

In the afternoon, Professor Morris and Evelyn rested while Jack played games with Modjeska. The Princess paced the vast chamber, checking her watch. She anticipated the men's return to send them to her house where her daughter, Rika, and the boys awaited. Gratefully, she thanked them for their kindness to Rika. Professor Morris reassured her, mentioning how Modjeska had saved them all. The Princess joyfully noticed the men's arrival, revealing a hidden passage where a dirty and weary figure emerged. He shared the story of his father's injury and their journey to Aunt Francoise's transformed hospital. The Princess then shared her experiences and the good news about Rika.

The chilly, damp passage led the girls to don heavy cloaks as they navigated through the dimly lit rooms. With a flashlight guiding their way along the stone floor, they reached the case they were searching for. Suddenly, an explosion echoed, and a faint light glowed at the corridor's end. Startled, the girls sprinted back, arriving in the dark room they had left. The Princess hoped the boys had taken the little girls to safety. They decided to head to the Prince in Lodz. Following the sound of trickling water, they found themselves under a narrow waterfall. Quietly moving through the park, they finally saw a dark shape ahead. As they walked in the fresh air, Warren and Ivan replenished their energy by raiding a bakery. They eventually located the building where Professor Morris and his children were held.
