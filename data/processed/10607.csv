**""Little Bo-Peep""**

Little Bo-Peep lost her sheep and didn't know where to find them. She left them alone and they all ran away. She cried and called for them, but they never came back. Little Boy Blue, who blew his horn in the meadow, saw the sheep and tried to bring them back. The clock struck one, and it was time for them to return, but they were still missing. Winter was approaching, and the shepherdess was worried about her flock. Fingers and toes were cold, and the seasonable song Dame Trot sang to her cat didn't comfort her. Three children skating on thin ice, Cross Patch, and the old woman under a hill couldn't help her find the lost sheep. Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee, oh dear! Old Mother Goose and Little Jumping Joan couldn't locate them either. Pat-a-Cake, Money, and the mare Robin Redbreast sang a melancholy song, but the sheep were still missing. Jack going to St. Ives with thirty days in September, Baby Dolly, and the bees that came out to play couldn't bring the sheep back. If wishes were horses, they would ride to market to find them.

Little Robin Redbreast hopped onto a spade, followed by Pussy-Cat. Robin chirped, and Pussy-Cat meowed, making Robin fly away. Girls and boys, come play under the moon's bright light. Leave supper and sleep, join your friends in the street. Up the ladder, down the wall, a roll for all. To market, to buy a fat pig, then home with a jig. Robin and Richard, two men, rise late, one on a nag. A man wooed a maid, asking for her hand, she inquired about food. A hen did house chores, baked bread, brewed ale, and told tales. Two birds on a stone, one flew, then none. Jenny Wren declined Robin's fancy offer, preferring simplicity. The tailor missed his mark, shooting his own sow.|"[""1.

Once upon a time, in a town nearby, there lived a man known for his wisdom. One day, he did something quite peculiar - he leaped into a thorny bush and gouged out his own eyes. Surprisingly, upon realizing his eyes were missing, he vigorously hurled himself into another bush and managed to scratch them back in place.

"Once upon a time, the Lion and the Unicorn clashed for the crown. The Lion triumphed over the Unicorn in the town. Some shared white bread, others brown, and even offered plum-cake before sending them away. In another tale, a tiny husband was placed in a pint pot to drum. A handkerchief was bought to wipe his nose, and little garters to tie his hose. ""Sleep, baby, sleep,"" the lullaby sings, with a lamb in the vale so deep. A ram encountered on market-day was the fattest ever seen, ten yards round and with horns reaching the sky.
