About 900 years ago, on a serene autumn evening in Greenland, two large hairy creatures resembling polar bears cautiously approached a hamlet. These creatures, walking on all fours, had long bodies, short legs, and large round heads. From a ridge, they observed the peaceful settlement below, with women, children, and men going about their daily lives. After their observation, the creatures retreated, stood on hind legs, and began to communicate like humans. They then hurried off towards a gorge. Later, a large group of similar creatures welcomed them back, leading to a lively assembly where a tall man with a flat face addressed the crowd passionately.

"The group gathered at the assembly wholeheartedly appreciated, applauded, and endorsed the sentiments expressed. Cheers and shouts of ""Hear, hear"" erupted in their unique way. After the lively display, the band hurried back to the mountain gorge, likely to feast on raw blubber, ready their weapons, and rest before the impending battle. Eric had passed away years earlier, leaving Leif his cottage in Brattalid, Greenland. Leif, tossing the child Olaf playfully, suggested they check on the boats and nets. Observing the horizon, Leif's seafaring gaze hinted at an approaching breeze. Meanwhile, Gudrid, a fair young woman, emerged from washing dishes, her deep blue eyes and rosy cheeks reflecting her robust health from hard work.

The Viking's eyes gleamed with emotion as he spoke of his friend, a man known for his strength and warm heart. Leif, eager to welcome the arriving ships, hurried down to the beach where the vessels gently touched the sandy shore.

Karlsefin quickly fell in love at first sight but didn't show it. After the introduction, he focused on talking with Leif, ignoring Gudrid who was preparing supper. During the meal, Gudrid served the guests, and Karlsefin paid her a bit more attention, although Thorward was equally attentive. As they drank ale, Karlsefin mentioned his lost taste for beer from his time at sea. Leif proudly shared that his tankard was a gift from King Olaf Tryggvisson.

Leif, the son of Eric the Red, shared a tale of adventure with his friends, Karlsefin and Thorward. About twenty summers ago, Biarne, a young man full of enterprise, set sail to Greenland to join his father. However, he and his crew lost their way and stumbled upon a land covered in woods, unlike Greenland's snowy mountains. Despite the crew's desire for wood and water, Biarne, knowing they were lost, refused to dock. Time was running out, and finding Greenland was crucial. Biarne's decision was tough but necessary. His daring voyage to the unknown land, later known as Vinland, showcased his courage and determination. Leif praised Biarne's actions, highlighting the importance of duty and the sacrifices made for exploration.|"['1.

Leif recounted his journeys to Vinland, where he discovered new lands. Biarne, who first saw these lands, was blamed for not exploring them further. Leif, inspired by Biarne's accounts, ventured to Vinland 14 years later. He named the lands Vinland after finding grapes there. His brother Thorwald also went to Vinland but was killed by the Skraelingers. Thorstein, Gudrid's husband, attempted to retrieve Thorwald's body but died on the journey. Leif's household now includes Gudrid. Leif encouraged others to explore Vinland for themselves. Thorward quickly left, and Leif and his men prepared for a fight. Norse people were accustomed to battles and easily donned their armor. Gudrid swiftly handed Leif his sword and helmet as they readied for the impending conflict.|"[""1.

Leif, with a grim laugh, prepared to face the Skraelingers, who sought to take advantage of their small numbers. With Biarne rallying the men, they mustered a strong force of about a hundred warriors. Leif, confident but cautious, instructed the men to advance quietly armed with shields and swords. The imposing Flatface led the Skraelingers, armed with walrus spears, to surprise the Norsemen. Flatface, aware of their limited numbers, planned a midnight attack. Meanwhile, Tyrker, a skilled trapper, stumbled upon the Skraelingers' band and rushed back to warn his comrades. With the element of surprise on their side, the Norsemen prepared to defend their settlement against the impending threat.|"['1.

Between the small village and the rocky point where Tyrker's traps were placed, there were a few jutting cliffs that had to be crossed before the point could be seen. Leif hurried his group past the first two cliffs. Then, he instructed his men to huddle close under the shadows of the cliffs while he went ahead alone to scout. Leif warned his men that when he sneezed loudly, they were to let out a roar and chase after him, making sure not to pass him. As Leif cautiously observed the approaching Skraelingers, he rejoined his men in the shadows. When the Skraelingers neared the ambush spot, Leif threw a stone over their heads, startling them. The Norsemen, unseen in the shadows, watched as the Skraelingers cautiously advanced. Leif's sneeze triggered a thunderous roar from his men, terrifying the Skraelingers and causing them to flee in panic. Leif chased them, using loud noises to keep them running until they disappeared around a cliff bend, ending the chase.|"['1.

Leif signaled his men to halt as they chased after the Skraelingers. Two young Scots, known for their speed, were introduced to Leif. Leif challenged them to catch the Skraelingers without weapons. The Scots, Hake and Heika, swiftly ran after the Skraelingers, surprising them with a playful dance. The Scots dodged the Skraelingers' attacks, leaving them in awe. Later, Karlsefin and Gudrid discussed the idea of exploring Vinland. Gudrid envisioned a lush land with forests and fertile fields, contrasting their current barren surroundings. Karlsefin, content with their home, preferred to stay. Gudrid teased him about being lazy, but they both enjoyed the beauty of their land as they walked along the sea-beach at sunset.|"['1.

"""Gudrid,"" Karlsefin said, ""grapes are magnificent. They make a drink that can madden youth and quicken the pulse of age, much like our beer."" Gudrid expressed concern about the effects of beer on the carls. Karlsefin agreed, stating that adding heat to warmth or artificial strength to natural vigor could be dangerous. He shared his plan to go to Vinland in the spring with one condition. Gudrid, blushing a little, agreed, pending her brother Leif's approval. Their conversation was interrupted by Olaf, who brought news of Aunt Freydissa's rage over a love affair. Thorward, the subject of the gossip, arrived looking troubled.

Thorward met Biarne near Brattalid. Biarne, unaware of the impact of his jest, restrained his laughter when Thorward accused him of lying. Thorward, in a fit of rage, demanded Biarne to go correct his falsehood or face dire consequences. Biarne, seemingly unfazed, returned after a brief absence. Thorward, surprised by Biarne's courage, was ready to retaliate. However, Biarne diffused the tension by delivering a message from Freydissa.

In ancient times, the Norsemen were skilled seafarers who crossed the northern seas in small vessels like the one Karlsefin sailed to Vinland. Cattle, horses, and sheep were also aboard, stowed between the rowers' benches. The rowers used oars during calms or when navigating tricky waters. Karlsefin and his companions slept under the high poop or in the forecastle. Freydissa, a strong-willed woman, disliked feminine weakness, especially tears. When Bertha, overcome with emotion, shed tears, Freydissa scolded her until a whale surfaced near the ship, diverting everyone's attention. The whale's playful antics brought joy and wonder to the travelers, momentarily easing tensions on the voyage to Vinland.|"['1.

The group unanimously agreed that the tale of Vinland's discovery and their own journey was true, although Gudrid felt it was brief, and Freydissa found it lacking. The story recounted a thrilling encounter with a massive whale during their voyage. The men were terrified, but Freydissa, a brave woman, scolded the creature. The debate ensued whether the story fit Karlsefin's composition. Eventually, it was decided to include the tale in the Vinland poem. As night fell, everyone retired to their cabins, leaving only the steersman and the watch on deck. The atmosphere at sea can swiftly change from tranquility to activity, as seen in the bustling moments of sailors adjusting to the ship's needs.

"Olaf was eager to help aboard the ship, but a sudden lurch sent him off course. Biarne quickly grabbed him and advised, ""Always look up and around, not down, to avoid accidents."" Olaf followed the advice and began asking Karlsefin about sailing. Meanwhile, the women on board felt seasick, their faces turning pale and green. As the ship rocked, a wave drenched everyone except Gudrid. Freydissa, soaked, retreated below deck. Karlsefin joked about washing the deck with the unexpected wave.

The boy felt indignant because the lookout had shouted 'Land ho!' without certainty. Karlsefin advised the boy that true bravery doesn't involve boasting but acting when necessary. Olaf, realizing his mistake, resolved to grow out of his foolish boasting. Despite some slips, he persevered and succeeded.

The land where the group stood was barren and rocky, just as Biarne had described. Not a single blade of grass was in sight, with snow-covered mountains in the distance. Freydissa found it uninviting and suggested returning to the ship immediately. Gudrid, however, thought they arrived too early in the spring and the land might look better in summer. The group split up to explore. Gudrid and Olaf searched for creatures among the rocks, while Freydissa sulked at first but then noticed the brothers, Hake and Heika, who were tall, strong, and had a serious demeanor. The brothers shared how they were captured by Norsemen and made slaves before being sent to Leif Ericsson.

During the reign of King Harald in Norway, my father, a trader, sailed to Hardanger to sell pelts. There, he met the king and had a merry time reminiscing. However, no one in Hardanger bought his skins, which puzzled him. At dinner with the king, he shared his frustration. The next day, the king visited my father's ship and asked for a wolf-skin as a gift. The king donned the skin, and soon everyone in his entourage wanted one too. This turned the tide for my father's business, as the demand soared. Later, they sailed to an island where little Olaf tasted the dew, hoping it was sweet like in Vinland.

"Biarne cried out with excitement, pointing to the land ahead. He spotted the ness that Leif had talked about, jutting out northwards, along with the island and the sound between them. Biarne was sure that the river mouth, flowing from the lake where Eric's son had built his booths, was also in sight. He cheered, ""Ho! Vinland! hurrah!"" as he waved his cap fervently. Despite the ship hitting sand due to the shallow water as they glided slowly over the sound, the determined Norsemen, led by Karlsefin, were unwavering in their quest to reach the land. With the tide ebbing, they knew they had to wait for the next flood-tide to move the ship. Karlsefin decided to lead a group ashore, well-armed with swords, axes, and bows, to explore further. They reached the river mouth, confirming they were on the right path. Karlsefin then proposed sending a few men to scout ahead, but his companions, Biarne and Thorward, suggested caution due to potential dangers. Karlsefin agreed to the plan but emphasized the importance of avoiding conflict with any natives they might encounter.

While the Norsemen explored the woods near the coast, the two Scots journeyed into the heart of the land. The brothers' movements were truly inspiring, noted Krake. Renowned for their speed and stamina back home, they trotted effortlessly, appearing to move at a leisurely pace that would challenge any ordinary runner. Despite their rapid pace, they conversed calmly, akin to a stroll. Running side by side, they effortlessly leaped over obstacles like fallen trees and small streams. When faced with wider creeks, one would pause to watch the other jump across before following suit. As they jogged along the riverbank, a sudden crash in the bushes revealed a deer. The brothers sprinted after it with laughter, showcasing their incredible agility and speed. Their journey led them to a breathtaking vista of a vast woodland surrounding a serene lake, reflecting the golden light of the sun. Their peaceful exploration was interrupted by the sight of a bear near the huts they sought, prompting them to use a massive boulder to startle the bear away.

""Wasn't it amusing to see Bruin endure the stones until he couldn't take it anymore? And his sprint afterwards! It was worth the trip to witness a bear change its pace so drastically.

Running swiftly without chatter, they reached the river branch. Pausing briefly, they contemplated the stream's direction. They decided to venture down the smaller streams, encountering cascades and rapids. Crossing where the water was shallow, they paused at a rapid, where a salmon leaped. Hake marveled at the sight.

Biarne suggested building a dam to dry up one channel and catch the fish easily. The next day, they began the construction under Biarne's direction, with Thorward supervising the details. Stakes were driven into the riverbed, trees were cut down, and materials were gathered for the dam. By sunset, the initial preparations were complete, and they returned to the huts to plan for the next day. The following morning, the group, including women and Olaf armed with a hook, set off to Little River to execute their plan. Everyone was eager to see if they could successfully catch the salmon.|['1.

Upon reaching the island, Karlsefin split his group into two teams. One group of about twenty-five men stood in the water at the lower end of the river, evenly spaced with long poles to scare fish from rushing downstream. The remaining men gathered at the dam. Karlsefin instructed them to work together to complete the dam across the island, sealing the gap quickly with logs, stones, branches, and turf. Some were tasked with deepening the stream's channel. Once the dam was complete, they readied their fishing gear. Little Olaf Ericsson was thrilled by the unusual task, eagerly helping with logs and branches. After completing the dam, the men prepared their nets and hooks. As the water lowered, the pool teemed with salmon, darting around frantically. The fish panicked, leaping and sliding on islets, creating a chaotic scene.|"[""1.

The islets gradually grew larger and connected, turning the stream into boiling fish-filled ponds. The Norsemen were ecstatic, with the women cheering and Freydissa leaping into the fray. With teamwork, they caught a multitude of salmon, their silver sheen and lively struggles captivating the group. Olaf's fishing prowess added to the bounty, even snagging a massive eel that caused chaos. Freydissa's mud-covered antics during the catch became legendary, with Krake teased for his unexpected mud bath. Karlsefin organized exploration teams, ensuring they stayed close and returned by evening. Biarne led the current expedition, following Karlsefin's strategy of balancing work and exploration in Vinland.|"['1.

After the party began, Hake noticed a woman vanish near the lake's edge. As the group headed into the dense woods, Hake asked Biarne to let him walk along the lake, planning to catch up with them before reaching the Willow Glen, a popular meeting spot for hunters and explorers. Bertha blushed easily when her emotions were stirred. Concerned about the Skraelingers, Hake explained the dangers of being caught off guard and taken away. Bertha, surprised by the realization, promised to be more cautious. Hake, asked why he wasn't with his group exploring, shared his preference for walking by the lake, reminiscent of Scotland's beauty. Bertha hoped for Heika's return to Scotland and teased Hake about his love for his homeland, describing its picturesque landscapes and wildlife.|"[""1.

"""I am uncertain. Unexpected events occur frequently, and what seems probable may not always happen. It is quite surprising that Karlsefin abandoned the beliefs of his ancestors. Yet, Karlsefin has embraced Christianity now.""

""Farewell, Bertha,"" the young man responded, watching her disappear behind the thicket. He then hurried into the woods towards Willow Glen.

""Just in time, Hake,"" Biarne greeted as the Scot joined them. ""We are embarking on a journey westward today, aiming to explore as far inland as possible before nightfall. From the size of the lake, river, and distant blue ridges, I believe this is a vast land, not just an island.""

Hake nodded and left his friend. The bear paused, growling and advancing menacingly. Confused by the sudden separation of its targets, it hesitated. Seizing the opportunity, both men charged at the bear. The animal reared up, unsure of which way to turn. The men attacked, and the bear fell. They decided to skin it and collect its meat for food. As they moved on, they discovered human footprints in the sand, realizing they might encounter strangers. Hake hurried back to inform Karlsefin of what they found. Meanwhile, a native attacked a Norseman, leading to a confrontation with more savages. The Norsemen prepared for a possible attack on their colony.

"When the sun rose above the trees the next day, Karlsefin noticed that the natives were nowhere to be seen. Just as he was about to leave his defenses, a man from the ship shouted, ""Skraelingers!"" It seemed he meant savages in general, as these men were different from the Greenland savages. Taller and well-dressed in animal skins with bright colors, the approaching group of natives caused a stir among the Norsemen. The natives, numbering around three to four hundred, were hostile, arriving in canoes shouting fiercely and brandishing weapons. Karlsefin quickly ordered everyone on board the ship, ensuring the women and livestock were safe. He instructed the men to use their weapons sparingly and aimed to avoid casualties. The Norsemen defended themselves with stones, showing restraint by not using heavy ones.

Karlsefin, Hake, and Heika stood on the ship's high poop, ready for battle. They wore iron helmets and shields. When the savages attacked, the Norsemen fought back fiercely with bludgeons, knocking them down. Karlsefin stayed vigilant, directing Hake's arrows at the boldest foes.

As the natives sat waiting, Karlsefin unveiled a surprise - the chief was bound and armed Norsemen emerged with swords drawn. The natives, taken aback, stayed frozen in fear. A distant yell indicated that the savages' allies had noticed the situation. The Norsemen swiftly secured their captives and brought them inside their defenses.

The chief, wounded and seated, was encouraged by Bertha to eat, and the others followed suit eagerly. The Norsemen shared jewelry and cloth with the prisoners, fostering a warm bond.

In the past, the Norsemen engaged in a flourishing trade of furs with the friendly natives, exchanging colorful cloth, beads, and trinkets. The natives, content with these offerings, even desired weapons, which Karlsefin wisely declined. Initially, the Norsemen were generous with their goods, but as supplies dwindled, they reduced the width of the cloth strips offered for furs. Despite this change, the natives happily adorned themselves with the narrow strips. Karlsefin, recognizing the natives' fondness for dairy products, arranged a feast with milk, cream, cakes, butter, and cheese. The natives relished the treats and displayed good manners by not asking for more. Karlsefin then planned to sail the ship, the _Snake_, to gather needed supplies and invite Leif Ericsson to visit.

While the baby was not the most pleasing sight, being compared to a piece of wrinkled beef, it was adored by all. Despite its appearance, Bertha found it ""perfectly lovely,"" and Astrid thought it looked wise. As Snorro grew, the men marveled at the infant, treating it delicately and with great admiration. Krake humorously remarked on the baby's appearance, likening it to his own past. When the men set out to find vines, Krake's jests about Turks led to a heated argument with Tyrker, who stormed off and disappeared.

After leaving his friends, Tyrker wandered aimlessly, lost in thought. Suddenly, he awoke from his reverie to find himself surrounded by hills covered in vines. Overjoyed, he filled his pockets and mouth with grapes, relishing the moment. Eventually, satiated, he rested under the evening sky, falling asleep among the vines like a contented Bacchus. Meanwhile, his friends, worried about his absence, set out to search for him. Karlsefin, particularly concerned, led the search party and soon encountered a peculiar sight.

Tyrker, in a joyful state, insisted he wasn't drunk but rather intoxicated by old memories and thoughts brought back by the grapes. Karlsefin, however, reminded him that he claimed to be as happy as possible, implying he didn't need alcohol. The men took some grapes from Tyrker, and he returned to normal. They then gave the first grapes of Vinland to the women. Gudrid, in gratitude, fed a grape to Snorro, nearly choking him. The passage transitions from Vinland to Greenland, where Leif Ericsson and Flatface the Skraelinger interact awkwardly due to language barriers. Leif mentions the departure of Flatface, pleased to have him leave. Leif, though baptized, kept his religious beliefs private, intriguing those trying to convert him. Leif's shrewdness and observant nature left others guessing about his true opinions.|"['1.

Anders, a hardworking and skilled hunter, engaged in a conversation with Leif, discussing the value of his contributions compared to others. Leif acknowledged Anders' worth and asked for his help in preparing for an unknown arrival. Leif spotted a ship approaching and recognized it as Karlsefin's vessel. The people of Brattalid gathered on the shore, eager to see who was on board. Thorward, a visitor from Vinland, shared exciting stories about the new land's abundance. Leif prepared a feast to welcome Thorward and his tales, showcasing Greenland's seasonal delicacies. The banquet was enhanced by Thorward's addition of smoked salmon, which delighted the guests.

During the winter in their new settlement, the Norsemen found the season relatively mild compared to their northern homes. Snow covered the branches, creating a fairyland effect in the sunshine, but it didn't hinder the cattle from finding food. The lake froze, allowing for ice walking and fishing. The colonists kept busy cutting wood, trapping animals for fur, and fishing. Men rotated jobs for variety, while women managed housekeeping. Evenings were spent by the fire, sharing stories and discussing daily experiences. Karlsefin introduced the new religion, emphasizing Jesus Christ as a savior from sin, which intrigued the Norsemen. They knew accepting the new religion meant letting go of the old beliefs. Leif and Karlsefin discussed the challenges and importance of embracing the new faith.|"['1.

Leif and Karlsefin discussed the challenges of their settlement in Vinland. Leif expressed concerns about the foundation of their community, noting that many men had left loved ones behind in Norway and Iceland. Karlsefin laughed, suggesting it would be difficult to convince families to uproot and move to a new land. Leif proposed that the men should return home to persuade their families to join them. Karlsefin, however, shared his deep connection to the sea and his reluctance to call Vinland home permanently. Despite this, he acknowledged his responsibility to support the settlers. Leif advised Karlsefin to give the colony more time to thrive before making a decision to stay or leave.

"Snorro decided to take a walk on a beautiful spring morning in the year 1010. He stumbled out of the hall and over the doorstep into the road, shouting his usual cry, ""O'af! O'af! O'AF! O-o-o!"" But there was no response as the villagers were away. Frustrated, Snorro yelled in despair. Olaf, a trustworthy boy, decided to take Snorro for a walk. They dashed along a woodcutter's track, and Olaf set Snorro on his feet, making him laugh. Snorro obediently followed Olaf, running off the track and through the woods towards a forbidden ridge with a view.

The sight before Olaf was a mix of beauty and mystery. The tall trees with their thick canopy created a natural roof over him, while the endless rows of smaller trees seemed to stretch out endlessly. The ground was covered in soft moss, making each step feel like sinking into a cushion. In the distance, the view shifted from intense blue to almost black, with a bright sunny spot ahead, hinting at a pond's shimmering waters. Despite the allure of the scene, Olaf couldn't shake the feeling of trespassing. Nevertheless, he pressed on towards the lake, only to find the ground turning into a swamp. Realizing his mistake, he tried to retrace his steps but soon realized he was lost.

Olaf tried harder to leave the dense forest, reaching a more open area that resembled where he usually traveled. This lifted his spirits, believing he was closer to familiar places. Despite the cloudy sky hiding the sun, he climbed a tree for a better view, but the vast forest offered no clues to his whereabouts. As evening approached, Olaf realized he would spend the night in the woods. He wisely prepared a camp in a dry hollow with leaves for bedding. He kept Snorro warm, both falling asleep. The next morning, they woke up to a makeshift roof of earth and roots, realizing they were truly lost. Olaf comforted Snorro, explaining their situation in a brave tone, despite feeling scared himself.|"[""1.

Olaf and Snorro were in a dire situation. They were confronted by a savage with fierce black eyes in a forest cave. Despite the fear that gripped Olaf's heart, he bravely shielded Snorro and faced the savage. In a swift move, Olaf struck the savage on the nose with a branch, turning it into a Roman nose. In retaliation, the savage hit Olaf on the ear, causing a temporary daze. Snorro's screams filled the cave, adding to the chaos. The savage then grabbed Snorro and forced Olaf to move ahead.

They journeyed through the woods, across open spaces, over ridges, and down into hollows, passing through forests similar to the first. Olaf wondered if they had crossed into another world as exhaustion set in. The noon sun beat down, burning his brain. Finally, they reached a rivulet with tents made of skins emitting smoke. The natives gestured excitedly, pointing at the captives with surprise and delight. Olaf couldn't understand their language. Snorro, exhausted and hungry, sought solace with Olaf. Guilt pricked Olaf's conscience. The savages fed them boiled fish and venison. The captives devoured the food eagerly, forgetting their sorrows. The natives then packed up, embarked on canoes, and paddled away. Back at the settlement, alarm spread as Olaf and Snorro were missing.

The search for Olaf and Snorro began near their home in the woods, but they were not found. Karlsefin realized the urgency and organized a thorough search. He sent men with torches and food into the woods. Karlsefin joined the search at Pine Ridge. They found Olaf's footprints but not Snorro's. Following the tracks, they concluded the children were in the forest. The search continued all night, but the vast forest made it challenging.

In the forest, a skilled native scout, with sharp senses, observed a group of men with torches. He stealthily followed their movements, disappearing like a shadow. As the men searched, the scout realized they sought lost children. Tracking their trail expertly, he discovered the cave where the children had rested. The next day, Karlsefin and his companions, undeterred, decided to resume their search, fueled by hope and determination. Following the children's footprints, they reached the cave by afternoon. Karlsefin's positive attitude uplifted the group, and they continued the search with renewed vigor.

Following the trail with determination, they reached the deserted camp by the stream. The recent departure of the children was evident from the smoldering fires. Examining closely, they found the children's footprints distinct from the natives'. Signs of launched canoes were found, causing concern. Heika suggested using captured canoes to pursue them. With provisions and canoes, the group prepared for the chase. Karlsefin and others readied for the journey while some rested at the settlement. Torch-lit, they carried canoes and provisions back to the camp. With skilled men and equipment, they embarked on the river at dawn. Karlsefin bid farewell, prepared for the rescue mission, leaving Leif and Biarne in charge. The Norsemen were familiar with the river's course, having explored the area extensively.

The captured canoes from the savages were fragile, being made of birch-tree bark that easily split upon contact with a stone, requiring careful navigation. Repair materials were readily available in the forest. While Heika and his brother were skilled, others in the expedition were less experienced. Karlsefin and Krake were decent, but Thorward struggled, overly confident in his abilities. The river was initially calm, with diverse scenic beauty and abundant wildlife. The Norsemen, anxious about the children's fate, still found moments to admire the surroundings. As they passed the natives' camp, they were hopeful of catching up soon. Karlsefin suggested a vigorous pursuit, while Thorward, known for his critical nature, advised traveling light to increase speed.

The group of explorers quickly fell asleep after their leader, Thorward, stayed awake to keep watch. As the moon shone brightly, they knew they were nearing rapids and needed light to navigate. Due to strong currents from recent rains, they couldn't reach the rapids until sunrise. Thorward, feeling uneasy, gazed at the turbulent river. Hake explained the challenging route ahead, pointing out rocks and eddies they needed to navigate. Despite initial skepticism, Thorward focused on the task ahead as they approached the rapids. With determination, the group paddled through the raging waters, guided by Hake's instructions. Thorward's demeanor shifted from jesting to solemn as they faced the daunting challenge of navigating the rapids.|"['1.

Their progress was slow but steady. They conquered the stream bit by bit, reaching the first eddy to the cheers of their friends. After a brief pause, they dashed towards the second eddy, causing disappointment as they seemed to lose distance gained. However, they skillfully maneuvered the canoe, turning it upstream towards the second rock. With each eddy conquered, they faced more danger due to the turbulent waters. Resting briefly under a large rock, they resumed their struggle, using every rock and eddy to their advantage. Finally, they reached the head of the rapids, waving triumphantly to their friends below. The intense journey tested their strength and skill, but they persevered, with each member of the crew playing their part.|"['1.

Karlsefin was skilled in canoe management, and Krake had experience with river rapids. Together, they navigated the rapids successfully. At the upper end, Hake and Heika joined to assist their friends, with Karlsefin taking the steering paddle. The group made a second successful attempt, reaching calm waters. Olaf and Snorro, Norse prisoners, were taken to a large, mobile savage camp by their captors. The chief, Whitepow, examined them closely, then directed the children to a tent with native women. The women treated them kindly, offering milk and berries. Despite the camp's unattractive aspects, there was much of interest to various observers, including Olaf and Snorro's experience as captives in this new environment.|"['1.

After the feast ended, the children were displayed in front of the women's tent for inspection by the entire tribe. Despite feeling uncomfortable, the children endured the scrutiny. Eventually, most of the onlookers dispersed, leaving only a few boys behind. These boys, including one named Powlet, had painted faces and feathered headwear. Initially hesitant, Olaf allowed Powlet to paint his face, much to the amusement of Snorro. Encouraged by Snorro's laughter, Olaf consented to further decoration. Powlet and other boys added red, white, and blue paint to Olaf's face, creating a striking and humorous look. However, their fun was interrupted by a tall savage who punished Powlet and dispersed the boys. Feeling homesick and ridiculous, Olaf decided to escape into the woods with Snorro on his back, hoping to evade the savages and find a way home.|"['1.

"After a few minutes, he spoke again, ""Yes, I know I didn't mean to disobey, but I did. I never thought such terrible things would happen, but that doesn't change what I did. What should I do? Snorrie, I wish I could give you back to your mother, even if it meant giving up my life."" Snorro was fast asleep, and Olaf sadly looked at the child on his shoulder. Realizing it was bedtime, he took Snorro to the women's tent, where they were welcomed warmly. Soon, Snorro was asleep on a soft pillow, and Olaf lay beside him on a cozy deer-skin bed, staring at the sky through the tent's opening. He pondered, ""Why did I disobey?"" filled with regret until sleep finally brought relief. Meanwhile, in Thorward's house, Freydissa's loud scolding filled the air, making Bertha's already swollen face from crying even worse.

Freydissa was upset with Bertha's crying and accused her of thinking about Hake instead of Snorro. She threw a soapy cloth at Bertha, but it missed and hit a hen instead, causing chaos. Biarne arrived and asked about Leif's whereabouts, diverting the tension. Leif and Biarne discussed the need to prepare for a potential threat from a group of savages. They quickly organized a team and loaded canoes with supplies for a possible rescue mission. Leif stayed back to guard the settlement while Biarne set off with his men. The colonists had been working on a fort for defense, which was almost finished due to recent tensions with the natives.|"[""1.

Leif built a fortress atop a rocky mound in the village to protect the people and livestock. The palisade was made of stout planks with narrow slits for arrows and a platform for defense. Leif worked tirelessly to complete the refuge, adding sheds for women and livestock, storing provisions, and making arrows and ammunition. Scouts were overlooked, but Hengler's close encounter with savages prompted Leif to prepare for an imminent attack. Leif's strategy involved surprising the savages by using pine cones and birch bark as weapons. As night fell, the villagers waited behind the walls, ready for any assault.

While Hengler and six men were away, a small group fetched a long log and some water-soaked planks for the fort. They quickly brought these items back. The log was placed upright with pegs for climbing, and a platform was made at the top. Leif had the men pile pine cones and bark on the platform. A small fire was lit discreetly. Leif instructed the men to rest with their shields and swords ready while he kept watch. The night was dark, perfect for the plan. Suddenly, savage yells filled the air as the attackers leaped over the wall. The Norsemen remained hidden, armed and ready. When the signal was given, a fire blazed, revealing the hidden defenders.

A sudden attack surprised Leif and his men as a shower of stones rained down on them from the savages. Leif's strategy to wound, not kill, the attackers led to a retreat. As dawn broke, the savages built a massive pile of timber to set the fortress ablaze. Leif and his men retaliated with arrows, forcing the savages back into the woods. Karlsefin and his group navigated the river to reach the native village, where nomadic tribes resided. The tense standoff continued as the savages persisted in their attempts to set fire to the fortress. Leif and his men remained vigilant, ready to defend their stronghold and take to the water if needed.

Thorward agreed with Karlsefin's cautious advice and acknowledged his peaceful nature, noting his ability to fight well when necessary. They carefully crossed the river, concealing their canoes in a thicket and then ventured into the forest towards a cliff overlooking a vast native encampment. Thorward questioned if these were the culprits who kidnapped the children, suspecting they were a smaller group. Olaf and Snorro unexpectedly appeared on the sand spit, recognized by the Norsemen leaders, who refrained from revealing their presence. Karlsefin expressed gratitude for Olaf's kindness towards his son. Hake proposed a daring plan to rescue the children, suggesting crossing the river alone to retrieve them. Karlsefin voiced concerns about the risks involved, including the weight of carrying the children and the potential pursuit by fleet-footed savages. Thorward contemplated a more aggressive approach but ultimately agreed to Hake's plan, with the men retreating to the canoes as Hake prepared to execute his daring rescue mission.

Hake embarked on a risky mission, driven by his adventurous spirit and bravery. Despite the overwhelming odds, he chose danger over safety. As he crossed the river towards his goal, thoughts of Bertha filled his mind. Swiftly moving like a panther, he approached his target, the spit of land where Olaf and Snorro played. Hake's stealthy approach would have gone unnoticed by the natives if Olaf hadn't spotted him. With a shout of joy, Olaf ran to meet him, alerting the others. Despite the close pursuit, Hake displayed his agility and skill, nearly reaching safety. As the situation escalated, Karlsefin and his men sprang into action, swiftly navigating the river in their canoes. A tense confrontation unfolded as the natives lined the banks, but Karlsefin's peaceful gestures were met with hostility from Whitepow, the chief. The encounter hung in the balance as tensions rose between the two groups.|"['1. What drove Hake to embark on his risky mission?\nA) Fear\nB) Bravery\nC) Laziness\nD) Avarice\nE) Indecision', ""2.

Karlsefin hesitated to rescue Hake, fearing for the safety of the hidden children. Despite his attempts to calm the situation, Whitepow threw a club at him. Karlsefin deflected the club with his shield, showing no fear. As Whitepow prepared to attack with an arrow, Karlsefin's men urged him to fight back. However, Karlsefin reminded them of the risks involved, emphasizing the importance of protecting the children and the colony. While Thorward was eager for battle, Karlsefin hoped for peace. Just as tensions rose, a fleet of canoes appeared on the river, carrying armed men who were their comrades.

Karlsefin thanked Biarne for arriving at the right time and asked his men to join the circle and spread out wider. He acknowledged the additional force brought by the Norsemen but knew it wouldn't change their situation significantly against the numerous savages skilled in bush warfare. As the savages approached in canoes and on foot, the Norsemen stood ready for a fight. However, a shout from the woods drew their attention to a deranged savage who performed strange actions. Thorward recognized him as Utway, a man they had encountered before. Utway gestured warmly towards Karlsefin, indicating a desire for friendship between the Norsemen and the savages. Despite the offer, Karlsefin declined by gesturing about staying separate and free from any binds.|"[""1.

"The natives seemed to understand and enjoy the situation, nodding and exclaiming ""Ho!"" excitedly. Whitepow, however, disagreed and Karlsefin looked displeased. When Karlsefin noticed a bright piece of cloth Gudrid had given him, the chief's demeanor changed. Karlsefin assured Whitepow of more treasures if he released the captives. To emphasize, he displayed metal ornaments and a precious silver brooch, an heirloom from his family. Initially hesitant, Whitepow eventually agreed, freeing Hake and the children. Overjoyed, Karlsefin reunited with his son, Snorro, and Olaf. Gratefully, he handed over the cherished brooch. As a sign of goodwill, Karlsefin and his men offered their ornaments.

Hake, the wise man, was thanked and asked to prepare two canoes for safety. The Norsemen offered ornaments to the savages, who in return gave furs. A trade was established, and the Norsemen were invited to the savages' village. However, Karlsefin preferred to stay on the sand spit for the night, with a few savages visiting their camp. The night was filled with feasting and merriment, displaying a free spirit to the savages. Only Utway, Whitepow, and little Powlet were allowed to join. The Norsemen entertained with stories, songs, and laughter, amazing the savages. Snorro, a young Norseman, showed affection for those who fed him well. The night ended with Hake's moving song, leaving the savages in silent admiration before they departed, and the Norsemen settled down for the night.|"['1.

Early the next day, as planned, the Norsemen set off at dawn, but they were not alone. A larger fleet than expected joined them, which Karlsefin accepted without objection due to the natives' friendly disposition. Unaware of the urgent need for haste back at Leifsgaard, they leisurely camped each night. Meanwhile, Leif's fortress was under attack, and he decided to abandon it. Under cover of darkness, they boarded the _Snake_ unnoticed by the savages. As they departed, a fire engulfed the settlement, causing great concern. The Norsemen paddled fiercely, driven by the sight of smoke and flames. Upon arrival, they engaged the savages, who fled. Karlsefin urged the friendly natives to intervene for peace. A group set off to search the woods, while Karlsefin reunited with Leif and the women on board the _Snake_, where joyful reunions ensued.|['1.

Biarne and Karlsefin, with their men, were lucky to arrive just in time to meet the natives peacefully. They decided to have a feast to celebrate their newfound friendship. The old chief, Whitepow, joined the feast, strengthening the bond between the two groups. Despite the language barrier, they communicated through gestures and expressions. The feast was filled with venison and salmon, speeches, and gestures of goodwill. The savages tried hard to convey something important, but their message was not immediately understood. Krake, the interpreter, struggled to grasp their meaning, adding a humorous touch to the gathering.

"The young savage opened his mouth wide, gestured down his throat, then up at the sky, spreading his hands in a vague manner, and exclaimed ""ho!"" to express clarity. Powlet understood his name and Biarne's gestures, prompting them to communicate through signs. A tall savage joined them, mimicking the Norsemen's casual manner. He then made dramatic gestures, conveying a message with howls and nods. Despite the language barrier, the joy and understanding were evident. The savages shared beautiful furs for simple items, creating a mutually beneficial trade. Leif suggested sending ships to Greenland to restock and oversee the loading.

"There was a moment of silence. Karlsefin then spoke, ""It appears to me, friends, that we are all thinking alike. I have pondered leaving Vinland for some time now. Many of our men yearn to return to their families, some to their sweethearts, and others to their homeland. It seems none of us are eager to stay."" ""I might agree. We faced numerous challenges settling here. It would be a shame to abandon our efforts unless absolutely necessary. Perhaps others share my sentiments. I suggest we convene a Thing, an orderly assembly, before deciding."" The next day, the Vinland colonists gathered. Several individuals delivered eloquent speeches, reflecting the Norse tradition of open discourse. While some speeches were light-hearted, others lacked substance, much like modern public debates. All men except thralls had a voice, excluding Hake and Heika. They privately discussed Vinland's potential, emphasizing its vast resources and friendly natives. Thorward proposed building a new nation in Vinland, but faced opposition from Krake, who longed for his loved ones in Iceland.

Krake expressed his deep desire to return home to Greenland, where his family resided, rather than stay in Vinland. He emphasized the importance of being with his loved ones over the allure of a new colony. The Norsemen resonated with Krake's sentiments, applauding his words with enthusiasm. Thorward, on the other hand, remained silent in response. Leif, Biarne, and Karlsefin suggested a return to Greenland to establish a more stable colony, emphasizing the need for families to feel at home in the new land. Karlsefin proposed organizing the colony in Iceland or Norway before settling in Vinland. He believed that a well-established community would fare better in the long run. Hake, inspired by Karlsefin's words, decided to join his brother in a daring plan to sail back to Scotland using a borrowed boat, showing his loyalty to family and homeland.|"['1.

For a while, the brothers argued about whether Hake should join Heika in their attempt to regain freedom. Eventually, Heika reluctantly agreed. They quickly made arrangements to leave Vinland, as the colony was easily uprooted. Before departing, Karlsefin hosted a grand feast for the natives, explaining their departure and promising to return with goods for trade. The Norsemen bid farewell to Leifsgaard, leaving with a cheer. As they sailed away, Karlsefin felt a sense of homecoming. The group reminisced about their time in Vinland, cherishing the memories. Upon their return, the colony was bustling with activity, with new settlers and a growing population. Despite the changes, they adapted and settled into a new routine.

They quickly arrived at old Haraldson's home, situated at the far west of Brattalid. Upon entering, they found the elderly man seated in a large chair with eider-down pillows, while Bertha sat at his feet holding his hand. Haraldson, in a shaky voice, invited the young man to sit and share a tale about Vinland, especially those that pleased Bertha. He expressed his frailty since her departure and the weariness of time. The young man, Heika, had business with Edwinsson but promised to return. Heika set sail on a boat, reached the skerries, and hid the boat before heading back to Brattalid by land.

Hake explained that he recognized Emma from his brother's description of a fair maiden. He mentioned that Leif, their countryman, could confirm this, as he loved talking about home. However, caution led them to be discreet about their plans. The brothers prepared for an early start on their voyage, with their weapons close at hand. Meanwhile, the Scottish brothers quietly gathered supplies for their journey across the Atlantic. The settlement thrived with missionaries teaching the new faith and assisting in construction. Leif oversaw the colony, while Karlsefin readied for a voyage to Iceland. Despite domestic challenges, Leif maintained harmony in the colony, showing care towards his household.

Returning to Heika, as he approached the inlet, he quickened his pace to a brisk walk, checking his surroundings cautiously. Unseen by anyone, a small boat arrived at the inlet from the sea, carrying Leif Ericsson and Karlsefin. They disembarked and found a secluded spot in the shadows. As Heika appeared before them, his emotions flared. Despite his initial reaction, Heika softened under their gentle approach. Leif expressed confusion over Heika's actions, hinting at ingratitude. Heika defended his actions, refusing to explain further. Karlsefin expressed disappointment, questioning Heika's loyalty. Just then, a sound of someone approaching rapidly caught their attention.

Leif and Karlsefin emerged from hiding, chuckling. Leif expressed his reluctance to let them go but eventually granted them freedom. He asked Hake if their boat was suitable for a risky voyage.

Leif abruptly dismissed any further discussion on the matter, offering Heika and Hake the option to leave for Scotland or stay in Greenland as his guests. The announcement of the thralls' freedom due to Christianity sparked theological debates and joy among the townsfolk. Bertha, timid yet joyful, looked forward to her impending marriage. Freydissa, surprisingly, shared her happiness. The morning after, Leif took Snorro to the sea-shore, reminiscing about the thralls' newfound happiness.
