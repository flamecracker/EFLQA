Once upon a time, a group of dolls faced a dilemma. The Large Doll decided they needed to hide during the day and start their journey at night. As they wandered the garden, the scarlet poppies and roses tried to stop them. Fortunately, a Toad offered to carry the little China doll, and the Oriole bird agreed to shelter the Spanish Doll in its nest. Squirrels took the others under the beech-tree.

The dolls were hungry as their first feeling. One doll took out a pewter gridiron from her pocket, grabbed from the kitchen fire when they escaped the night before. On it were three fish, red, yellow, and blue, which they shared and felt content for a while.

The Spanish Doll remained silent while Angelica Maria wondered if she would have recognized her. The trees quieted down, and the Spanish Doll regretted not revealing herself, feeling proud and damaged by the stream. Eventually, the Bull-frog rescued her, and the Musk-rat offered her shelter, where she shared tales of adventure. Meanwhile, Angelica Maria consoled herself with the thought that the Spanish Doll had retreated to her castles in Spain. Later, the dolls settled back home after their adventurous flight, except for the China Doll who struggled to survive until found by Angelica Maria. The middling-sized Doll with boots met a tragic fate in the wood-house spout. Solomon John's comical attempts to mount a horse for an apple-fetching errand brought amusement to the children.|"['1.

Solomon John rode quietly out of the village under the trees until he reached a bridge over a stream. His horse stopped to drink water, and Solomon John noticed how far the horse's neck curved. As he leaned forward to get a closer look, he accidentally slid off the horse and sat on a stone. Surrounded by frogs, he laughed instead of crying. Next, he tried to go to a cider-mill but the horse moved slowly. Solomon John threw apples to speed up the horse, causing chaos with cows, turkeys, and other animals. When he finally reached the cider-mill, the horse ran off without him. Solomon John was taken on a wild ride through the village until finally reaching home. Solomon John thought other children should walk to the cider-mill to enjoy the adventure. Robin, the youngest in another story, had a stormy temper and caused trouble, hurting his family and animals.|"[""1.

The man spoke carelessly, unaware of any danger of Robin being taken to Elfland. One day, Robin was sent over the moors to fetch the cattle. He journeyed across hills, past old battlefields and ruined houses, until he reached St. Mary's Loch. Pausing to rest, he noticed yellow flowers brightening the gray day. Unknowingly, he lay in a fairy ring, a circle where fairies are said to dance. Robin had heard tales of Scottish folklore about fairies, brownies, and water-kelpies. It was believed that the fairy queen had once tried to take him but failed when he sneezed as a baby. As the sun set, the sound of tiny hooves and bells signaled the fairies' arrival. The queen admired Robin and ordered her knights to carry him to Fairyland on a red-roan steed. Robin awoke in Fairyland, surrounded by curious beings and enchanting sights.|"[""1.

Bewildered Robin glanced at the tiny queen, appearing weary in the daylight. Despite her small size, she stood regally on a mullein-stalk, exuding queenly grace. She handed Robin a withered bean-pod and instructed a meek brownie to ensure he didn't overfill the acorn-cup or touch a grain of rye. Days passed, and Robin felt trapped in Fairy-land. He longed for home, missing his family's love and simple meals. A sympathetic brownie secretly helped Robin by bringing news from home. The brownie revealed that only on Hallow-e'en could Robin be freed. Following the brownie's guidance, Robin's sister Janet recognized him amongst the fairies and brought him back home, breaking the elves' hold on him.|"['1.

"In September 1758, Thomas Wales from Braintree, Massachusetts, made his Last Will and Testament, entrusting his soul to God and his estate to his family. He provided his wife, Sarah, with mourning clothes, household items, and a portion of their property. The division of his estate among his five sons and two daughters included giving the ""Homeplace"" to Ephraim and Atherton. Atherton's wife, Dorcas, was pleased to move into the old homestead, although she desired the southwest fire-room, which was granted to Grandma as per the will. Dorcas suggested having her son Samuel's young helper, Ann Ginnins, stay with her in exchange for her own servant, which caused some initial hesitation from Samuel and his wife, but they eventually agreed to the arrangement."|"['1.

Mrs. Dorcas was not happy about Ann living with them, especially since she felt Ann was getting too much attention from Grandma. She made Ann take care of her youngest daughter, Thirsey, a chubby and beloved baby. Ann's main tasks were helping Grandma and cooking. But things took a turn when Mrs. Dorcas started using the oven without considering Grandma's baking plans. One day, when the oven was full of Mrs. Dorcas' baking, Ann had to act. With no one around, she bravely removed all of Mrs. Dorcas' food from the oven to make space for Grandma's loaves. Ann's bold move showed her loyalty to Grandma and her determination to stand up for what was right.|"['1.

Ann returned to the southwest room and sat quietly at her spinning wheel. Grandma inquired if she had completed her tasks, to which Ann meekly replied in the affirmative. A red blush adorned her cheeks. When Mrs. Dorcas entered with Thirsey wrapped in a blanket, she was shocked to find the bread and pies in a half-baked, sticky mess. Grandma's loaves, however, were perfectly brown. Despite the chaos that ensued, Mr. Atherton intervened, ensuring Grandma's wishes were respected. Ann, although reprimanded, found solace in the outcome. Grandma appreciated Ann's growth and promised her prized gold beads in the future. Ann had matured but occasionally her mischievous nature resurfaced, much to Mrs. Dorcas's disdain. A particular incident involving candle-wicks in the cellar further strained their relationship.|"['1.

Ann was descending the cellar stairs with a lit candle to fetch some butter for tea when she noticed the beautiful rolls hanging above her. Curiosity got the best of her, and she decided to see how a little piece of fluffy flax would burn. To her dismay, the flame quickly spread through the entire bundle, causing a puff of fire and smoke that destroyed Mrs. Dorcas' candle-wicks. Frightened and remorseful, Ann's night took a turn for the worse when Mrs. Dorcas urgently sought help for her baby suffering from croup.

The storm was fierce, with icy sleet hitting her face like needles. Despite the harsh weather, Ann braved the dark, unmarked path to find the doctor. When she reached his house, she learned he had gone to the North Precinct. Determined to help, she trudged through the storm to Captain Lovejoy's house.

Thirsey's mother, convinced Ann had rescued her daughter, showed kindness towards Ann and even forgave Grandma for taking the southwest fire-room. Meanwhile, in the flower-garden behind the cottage, Nan, a delicate girl with flossy yellow curls and blue eyes, tended to the herbs. The garden flourished with sweet marjoram, sage, lavender, and dill. Dame Clementina, a noble count's daughter, managed the charming dairy with silver milk-pans and a stone churn adorned with intricate carvings. Despite being disinherited by her father for marrying a dairyman, she embraced her humble life with grace and nobility.|"[""1.

After Dame Clementina finished churning, she entered her cottage. Passing through the door adorned with sweet peas, she noticed the sprig of dill with a magical verse underneath. Inside, Nan was knitting by the window. Dame Clementina joked about pinning the dill and verse for protection, as no one would envy them. Suddenly, a visitor screamed in fear, believing her feet were paralyzed. Nan rushed to get the visitor's husband, who also froze upon arrival due to envy.

Once upon a time, a count and his horse faced a peculiar problem. The horse refused to move, and the count couldn't dismount. Meanwhile, Dame Clementina and little Nan were distressed by the weeping people in their yard. Unable to solve the issue, they decided to offer the people milk porridge.

Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a noble family who had a curious visitor – a Brownie. This Brownie was a tiny, old man dressed all in brown, who lived in the coal cellar of their grand castle. He was a mischievous but kind creature who played with the children and helped around the house. The family believed in him and left a bowl of milk for him every night. However, when a new, careless cook arrived, she stopped leaving milk for the Brownie, claiming she didn't believe in such things. As a result, strange things began to happen in the castle.

Once, when Brownie woke up at his usual hour, ten o'clock at night, he found no supper. Hungry and determined, he searched the coal cellar but found nothing edible. Tightening his belt, he decided to fetch his own supper. Surprised to find the door open, he entered the kitchen to discover a messy scene. Despite the chaos, a delightful spread awaited him: Devonshire cream, junket, bread, butter, cheese, apple pudding, cider, and milk. Brownie, who appreciated tidiness, feasted heartily.

Brownie, a mischievous creature, lived in a coal cellar and loved to cause a ruckus. One night, he dirtied the clean white tablecloth with his black footprints, much to the Cook's dismay. The next evening, the Cook locked up the cat, thinking it would keep Brownie away from the food. However, Brownie transformed into a mouse to escape the locked cellar and feast on the leftover supper. Despite a close call with the cat, Brownie managed to enjoy the meal and even calmed down the barking dog by reuniting it with its puppy.

After that, he had a great time and left more marks on the white tablecloth than ever before. He started bouncing around like a pea on a plate to help his big supper digest. When the cat was not around, he played with the puppy until it was time to transform back into a mouse and sneak into his cellar. Just in time before the cat noticed him, he turned back into a Brownie, surprising the cat, who then ran off. The next morning, Cook found the supper eaten and the tablecloth dirty again. She thought it was Tiny or her puppy, so she scolded them. The kitchen maid suggested leaving a bowl of milk for the Brownie. The milk disappeared, and the kitchen was tidy. The children enjoyed playing in the orchard, but the gardener cut their ladder. Their mother explained that the tree was important for its cherries, so they understood.|"['1.

"""Wait until the cherries are ripe,"" she said. The children waited patiently, watching the tree blossom with white flowers until the fruit turned red. The Gardener, looking cross, led them to the orchard. Suddenly, a fierce dog named Boxer appeared, causing chaos. The children were thrilled, knowing Boxer was friendly to them. The tree was too tall to climb, and the heavy ladder lay on the grass. The Brownie, a magical creature, instructed the children to hold out their caps and pinafores. Cherries rained down on them, filling their hats and clothes. They laughed and scrambled for the cherries, enjoying a playful feast.

"The children followed orders. The amount of cherries they ate and how quickly they devoured them is beyond my ability to describe.

"The golden leaves, like me, symbolize departure from home for the sake of a hidden fairy in an Egyptian ruin. If I recover her wand, she'll return joyful and pure as the snowdrops after winter.

Once upon a time, there was a family named Skratdj. They lived in England but had a Russian or Polish air. What made them unique was their tendency to never agree on anything, even though they rarely fought seriously. This peculiarity started with the parents, who would contradict each other's statements and opinions, causing discomfort to those around them. Even in public, they would engage in friendly disagreements. For example, during a dinner, Mr. Skratdj corrected Mrs. Skratdj's mention of the time and weather. Despite these constant contradictions, the family understood each other and continued to maintain a strong bond.

The onlookers were definitely in an awkward spot. Those nearby wanted to vanish, especially when dragged into the situation. Those further away weren't as bothered.

The law restricted children from going outside except between midnight and 1 a.m. when there was no moon or stars. Kids were also banned from hearing adult conversations and were kept hidden. But when the children defied the law and gathered in the park with lanterns, a fairy intervened. The fairy frightened the king's men and townspeople, making them flee to a mountain fortress.

Beechnut's father had a clever plan to hide his treasure in the clock's weights before traveling to America.

The captain signaled the sailors to reel in the line towards the shore amidst the deafening noise of the sea. A stronger cable was attached to the line connected to the barrel.

"No; it wasn't the wind: there it came again very hard, and what was particularly astounding, the knocker seemed to be in a hurry, and not to be in the least afraid of the consequences. Gluck went to the window, opened it, and put his head out to see who it was. It was the most extraordinary looking little gentleman he had ever seen in his life. He had a very large nose, slightly brass-coloured; his cheeks were very round, and very red, and might have warranted a supposition that he had been blowing a refractory fire for the last eight-and-forty hours; his eyes twinkled merrily through long silky eyelashes, his moustaches curled twice round like a corkscrew on each side of his mouth, and his hair, of a curious mixed pepper-and-salt colour, descended far over his shoulders. He was about four feet six in height, and wore a conical pointed cap of nearly the same altitude, decorated with a black feather some three feet long. His doublet was prolonged behind into something resembling a violent exaggeration of what is now termed a ""swallow tail,"" but was much obscured by the swelling folds of an enormous black, glossy-looking cloak, which must have been very much too long in calm weather, as the wind, whistling round the old house, carried it clear out from the wearer's shoulders to about four times his own length. Gluck was so perfectly paralyzed"|"['1.

Hans and Schwartz faced a strange encounter with an old gentleman who had a peculiar power. When they tried to grab him, they were both sent spinning and crashing into corners. The old man, with his corkscrew mustaches and cap tilted, calmly bid them farewell, promising a final visit at midnight. As he left, a cloud whirled away, and rain poured down. The brothers, scared and bewildered, secured the house and went to bed. At midnight, a loud crash woke them up. Their room flooded, and they saw the old man comfortably floating on a foam globe outside. The valley was destroyed, and the brothers found a card signed by the South-West Wind, sealing their fate. The once lush land turned into a desert, leading the brothers to abandon their home in search of a new life.|"[""1.

Two brothers and their younger sibling, Gluck, embarked on a goldsmithing venture using a hired furnace. However, their trade suffered due to two issues: the public disapproved of their coppered gold, and the elder brothers spent their earnings at the alehouse, leaving Gluck to tend the furnace. As a result, they melted all their gold and were left with only a special mug given to Gluck by his uncle. The mug was unique, with a handle made of golden hair and a fierce face on its front. When the time came to melt the mug for spoons, Gluck was heartbroken. As he gazed at the mountains outside the window, he heard a mysterious singing voice emanating from the furnace, causing him great surprise and fear.|"[""1.

Gluck summoned all his energies and approached the crucible with determination. As he peered inside, instead of seeing his reflection in the smooth melted gold, he was shocked to see the red nose and sharp eyes of his old friend, the mug, magnified a thousand times. The gold transformed into a little golden dwarf, dressed in spun gold with exquisite hair and beard. The dwarf introduced himself as the King of the Golden River and explained a prophecy. Only the one who climbs the mountain and pours three drops of holy water at the river's source will turn the river to gold. Failure in the first attempt means no second chance, and unholy water will turn the person into a black stone. The King then vanished into the flames. Later, Hans and Schwartz, drunk and angry over the lost plate, beat Gluck until tired. The next day, they fought over who would try the prophecy first, leading to chaos that required the constable's intervention.|"['1.

Hans, upon hearing the news, managed to escape and hide. Schwartz, however, was caught and fined for causing trouble. With no money left, he was thrown into prison. Hans, delighted by this turn of events, decided to embark on a journey to the Golden River. The challenge was acquiring the holy water needed for the quest. The priest refused to provide it to someone as reckless as Hans. Undeterred, Hans attended vespers for the first time and stole some holy water under the guise of making the sign of the cross. The next morning, he packed the holy water, wine, and food and set off with determination. Schwartz, consumed by anger, watched as Hans left with a mocking farewell. The morning was serene and captivating, with mist hovering over the valley and sunlight illuminating the mountains. Hans focused solely on the Golden River, setting out eagerly but facing unexpected obstacles like a treacherous glacier. Despite the dangers, Hans pressed on, driven by his desire for wealth. Thirst and exhaustion plagued him, and when he finally paused to drink from the flask, he encountered a dying dog in desperate need of water. Despite the dog's plight, Hans chose to drink and continue his journey, unaware of the ominous shadow that seemed to loom overhead.|['1.

The steep path grew rougher as Hans climbed, the thin air making him feverish. Distant cataracts mocked him, intensifying his thirst. With his flask half full, he spotted a child in need but chose to drink and move on. Shadows lengthened as he neared the Golden River's source. A cry revealed an old man dying of thirst, but Hans coldly passed by. Lightning flashed, the sun set, and Hans, overwhelmed, flung his flask into the river, then fell in, vanishing with a chilling shriek. Meanwhile, Gluck, waiting anxiously at home, feared for Hans. Unable to find him, he worked hard to pay his brother's debt, setting Schwartz free. Schwartz, now free, planned to claim the river's gold, while Gluck hoped to find Hans.|"['1.

When Schwartz learned that Hans had taken the holy water, he realized it was wrong. He decided to do better, so he used Gluck's money to buy holy water from a bad man. Confident in his actions, Schwartz set off early in the morning with bread, wine, and the holy water in a flask to the mountains. As he journeyed, he encountered a thirsty child asking for water, but Schwartz refused, consumed by his thirst for gold. The sky darkened, and a mist of red covered the sun, ominous signs appeared. Despite eerie encounters, Schwartz continued toward the Golden River, casting the flask into the water. Lightning flashed, the ground crumbled beneath him, and the river swallowed him as he disappeared.

Gluck faced a tough journey on the glacier, feeling weaker than his brothers. He encountered falls, lost his supplies, and heard strange noises under the ice. Thirst tormented him, but he encountered a feeble old man and a thirsty child. Despite his own thirst, Gluck shared his water selflessly. As he continued, the path improved, flowers bloomed, and butterflies danced. When his water ran low, he faced a dilemma with a panting dog. Remembering the dwarf's words, Gluck chose kindness over gold, saving the dog. The dog transformed into the King of the Golden River, rewarding Gluck's compassion.

As he spoke, the dwarf's form faded away, his robe's colors turning into a mist of light. Gluck reached the Golden River, its waters crystal clear. Dropping the dew, a whirlpool formed, disappointing Gluck. Obedient, he headed to the Treasure Valley. In the valley, a new river sprang, grass and flowers bloomed. Gluck lived there, sharing his wealth with the poor. The river turned into gold, fulfilling the dwarf's promise. Locals still point to where the dew fell. The Golden River flows underground, emerging in the valley. At the cataract, two black stones remain, howling at sunset. In a snowstorm, an old woman sat by the road, hoping for help.

In ancient times, children weren't as studious and responsible as they are today. Lessons were seen as a bother, treats were still popular, and toys weren't educational. There was a boy named Master No-book who was lazy, greedy, and mischievous. He avoided lessons, daydreaming about food instead. He was always asking for treats and often helped himself without permission. One day, fairies appeared in his room. The fairy Teach-all offered to teach him useful skills and knowledge, while the fairy Do-nothing promised a life of luxury and idleness at Castle Needless. Master No-book eagerly chose Castle Needless, where he enjoyed endless feasts, comfort, and entertainment without any effort. He lived in a world of leisure and extravagance, where everything was done for him, and he never had to lift a finger.|['1.

Master No-book spent hours and days dozing on luxurious cushions, surrounded by exquisite views of almond-covered trees, sugar-candy grottoes, and a pond teeming with goldfish. Despite the lavish setting, he felt increasingly discontent and bored. Nearby lived the monstrous giant Snap-'em-up, who devoured children as his favorite delicacy. One day, hearing Master No-book's sighs of misery, the giant whisked him away to fatten him up for a feast. Hanging in the giant's larder, Master No-book faced a terrifying fate until a heroic group of boys defended him. Witnessing the joy and purpose in the fairy Teach-all's garden, Master No-book regretted his idle ways.

Once upon a time, a boy named Master No-book was given a lecture by a fairy named Teach-all on the importance of being active, moderate, and well-behaved. Surprisingly, Master No-book transformed into a diligent and happy boy, excelling in his studies and activities. His change was so remarkable that he impressed everyone, even his old uncle who left him a grand estate. Renamed Sir Timothy Blue-stocking, he became a model of good conduct and generosity. However, when his grandmamma fell ill, Sir Timothy's siblings, Harry and Laura, were left in the care of the strict Mrs. Crabtree. Despite their initial mischievous behavior, their brother Frank advised them to behave responsibly in their grandmamma's absence.

Laura and Harry were thrilled when they decided to invite their friends over for a party. Laura quickly wrote out invitations in big letters to more than twenty friends, while Harry helped. Despite a few mishaps like burning a hole in her dress and spilling sealing wax, they managed to get the invitations ready. Old Andrew, the footman, who was always ready to help the children, was asked to deliver the invitations. He ran off immediately, carrying a big bundle of notes. The next day, the house was filled with smartly dressed guests arriving with their cards. Harry and Laura were overjoyed to see that all the invitations were for them. However, their excitement turned to panic when Mrs. Crabtree, the housekeeper, found out about the party and threatened not to provide any food or drink for the guests. Harry and Laura were devastated but tried to plead with Mrs. Crabtree to no avail.

The children were all dressed in their finest clothes, eagerly anticipating a grand feast. Laura and Harry felt distressed as they had nothing to offer their hungry guests. Charles, a kind-hearted boy, offered to fetch a loaf of bread from his house. Despite his lameness, Charles hurried back with the loaf, only to have it snatched away by Mrs. Comfit. Meanwhile, chaos erupted in the dining room as the children grew impatient for their tea. Peter Grey's impatience led to mischief, causing a riot. The boys, led by Peter, created a mess, breaking china and causing havoc. Mrs. Crabtree's arrival silenced the chaos, leaving the children in fear of her wrath.

In a distant town named Stumpinghame, there was a royal palace, seven windmills, a market, and a prison. The king, Stiffstep, and the queen, Hammerheel, had six children who inherited their large feet, a symbol of nobility in Stumpinghame. The town was surrounded by vast fields of corn, flax, and orchards, followed by expansive pastures and a dense forest whose size was unknown to the inhabitants. The people of Stumpinghame were known for their obsession with enlarging their feet to signify status. The king, addressed as Lord of the World, delivered grand speeches annually about the greatness of his realm. However, the arrival of their seventh son brought unexpected changes to the royal family.|"['1.

For a while, no one at the palace could understand the situation. The ladies-in-waiting appeared astonished, and the king was vexed. It was finally whispered throughout the city that the queen's seventh child had been born with incredibly tiny feet, unlike anything seen in Stumpinghame except for the fairies' feet. The common people believed it foretold a great calamity, while the scholars wrote books about it. The entire court and citizens mourned the queen's misfortune, but after seven days, they realized their mourning was in vain. The young prince, nicknamed Fairyfoot, was sent to be raised by shepherds in the countryside. Despite his small feet, Fairyfoot learned to walk, run, and jump, amazing everyone. The shepherds, however, despised him, considering him unlucky. Fairyfoot found solace in the wild pasture, where he encountered a mysterious little man named Robin Goodfellow.|"[""1.

A little man invited Fairyfoot to join a merry group in the forest, where they danced and feasted under the moonlight. They warned Fairyfoot to follow their customs and keep their secrets. The boy, forgetting his troubles, danced and drank wine with the little people every night. Despite dancing all night, Fairyfoot never felt tired during the day. One night, he discovered the reason for his boundless energy. He overheard two fairies discussing Princess Maybloom's large feet and the magical water that could shrink them. Fairyfoot was curious about the princess and her kingdom, different from Stumpinghame. The fairies' conversation left him astonished and intrigued.|"['1.

When Robin Goodfellow arrived to take him home, Fairyfoot kept the secret he overheard. Reluctant to get up that morning, he felt weary all day. While Fairyfoot dozed off in the afternoon, the old shepherd, Fleecefold, spotted him sleeping and his sheep wandering off. Fleecefold, with a bad temper and a thick staff, chased after him. Fairyfoot, fearing the shepherd's anger, fled into the forest. Following a stream, he ended up in a grove of rose-trees illuminated by the moon, with nightingales singing. Fairyfoot overheard the nightingales discussing his presence and decided to follow the ground-ivy to find Princess Maybloom. His journey led him through the forest and a city to the king's kitchen garden gate, where he encountered the princess and offered to lead her to a fountain that could help her with her large feet.|"['Question 1: Why did Fairyfoot feel weary all day?\nA) He had to chase after his sheep\nB) He overheard a secret\nC) He encountered the old shepherd, Fleecefold\nD) He was lost in the forest\nE) He was reluctant to get up in the morning', 'Question 2: What did the old shepherd, Fleecefold, do when he spotted Fairyfoot sleeping?\nA) He chased after him with a thick staff\nB) He dozed off as well\nC) He went back to his sheep\nD) He ignored Fairyfoot\nE) He offered Fairyfoot help', ""Question 3: Why did Fairyfoot flee into the forest?\nA) To find Princess Maybloom\nB) To escape the nightingales\nC) To avoid the shepherd's anger\nD) To find a fountain\nE) To rest under the rose-trees"", 'Question 4: Where did Fairyfoot end up after following a stream?\nA) In a city\nB) In a grove of rose-trees\nC) In a dark cave\nD) In a meadow of daisies\nE) In a castle', 'Question 5: What did Fairyfoot decide to follow to find Princess Maybloom?\nA) The nightingales\nB) The ground-ivy\nC) The shepherd, Fleecefold\nD) The stream\nE) The rose-trees', ""Question 6: Where did Fairyfoot encounter Princess Maybloom?\nA) In the king's kitchen garden gate\nB) In the forest\nC) At the fountain\nD) In the city\nE) In the shepherd's hut""]"|"['E) He was reluctant to get up in the morning', 'A) He chased after him with a thick staff', ""C) To avoid the shepherd's anger"", 'B) In a grove of rose-trees', 'B) The ground-ivy', ""A) In the king's kitchen garden gate""]"
"Once upon a time, there was a chamberlain who washed his face, and the young courtiers admired his beauty despite his age. The maids also washed, becoming the fairest in the palace. Lastly, the princess washed her feet, which unexpectedly shrank. To restore her feet, the princess and a boy named Fairyfoot set out to find a well in the forest that could make feet larger. They encountered a growing well near a bramble, where Fairyfoot hesitated to wash his feet due to a fear of them growing too large for dancing. Instead, they followed the fairies to a magical dance in the forest. Eventually, Fairyfoot and the princess were married and lived happily ever after, visiting the Growing Well and the Fair Fountain.

Alice kindly called out to the Mouse, asking it to return and promised not to talk about cats or dogs. The Mouse, looking pale and passionate, agreed to share its history once they reached the shore. As they all gathered on the bank, including a Duck, Dodo, Lory, and Eaglet, they discussed how to get dry. The Mouse, taking charge, ensured they all sat in a ring to dry off.

Alice then questioned why the Mouse called its tail sad, creating a humorous tale in her mind. The Lory expressed regret as the Mouse left, leading to a lesson on temper.

Alice pondered the idea of never growing older but also never stopping to learn new lessons, which didn't seem appealing to her. Just then, she heard the Rabbit approaching and got nervous, forgetting she was now much larger than it. As the Rabbit tried to enter through the door, Alice blocked it with her elbow. When she thought the Rabbit might try to come in through the window, she made a grab at it, causing a commotion with broken glass. Alice overheard whispers and then attempted to catch the intruders again, leading to more chaos. She wondered what would happen next and wished they could just pull her out of the window so she could leave the room.|"[""1.

Alice waited patiently, but all she could hear were voices and the sound of cartwheels. They were discussing ladders and the chimney. Suddenly, a loud crash interrupted the chatter. Bill was sent down the chimney, and chaos ensued. Alice, feeling curious, kicked up the chimney, causing a commotion. After a brief silence, pebbles turned into cakes, hitting Alice. She realized eating them might change her size. Excited by the idea, she pondered that eating a cake could make her smaller.|['1.

Alice ate a cake and started shrinking. She ran out and saw little animals. A lizard named Bill was held by guinea pigs. They rushed at Alice, but she ran into the woods. She wanted to grow back to her size and find a garden. While wandering, a puppy scared her. She played with the puppy using a stick. After the puppy got tired, Alice ran away. She rested by a buttercup and pondered how to grow back. She saw a mushroom and found a caterpillar on top smoking a hookah. The caterpillar asked if Alice felt changed. Alice waited for more but the caterpillar left, saying one side of the mushroom makes you taller and the other shorter.|['1.

Alice pondered the mushroom, struggling to discern its sides due to its round shape. After a moment, she broke off a piece with each hand, feeling a sudden fright at her shrinking size. Desperate to reverse the change, she hastily consumed the other piece. As she ate, she realized her chin was against her foot, her shoulders missing, and her hands invisible. Trying to reach her hands, she discovered her neck was flexible, like a serpent's. As she attempted to explore the green leaves below, a pigeon attacked her. The pigeon accused her of being a serpent, sparking confusion in Alice. Eventually, she nibbled on the mushroom pieces to return to her normal size, contemplating how to enter a nearby small house without alarming its occupants.|"['1.

"Alice stood near the house, puzzled about her next move when a footman in fancy clothes dashed out of the forest. She thought of him as a footman because of his outfit; otherwise, based on his face, she might have called him a fish. He knocked loudly on the door with his knuckles. Another footman, with a round, frog-like face and big eyes, opened the door. Both footmen had curly powdered hair. Alice was intrigued and crept closer to eavesdrop. The Fish-Footman handed a large letter to the other, saying, ""For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet."" The Frog-Footman repeated, ""From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet."" Alice laughed and ran back into the woods.

Alice observed the cook, hoping she would understand her hint, but the cook was too engrossed in stirring soup to notice. Alice pondered aloud about the time it would take for something to happen, but the Duchess, disliking numbers, dismissed her. The Duchess then handed her baby to Alice, hurrying off to play croquet. The baby was odd-shaped and difficult to handle, resembling a starfish. After figuring out how to cradle it, Alice feared for its safety and decided to take it away. She noticed the baby's peculiar features and worried it might turn into a pig. Eventually, the baby indeed transformed into a pig, and Alice let it go into the woods.

Alice cautiously approached the Cheshire-Puss, who only grinned wider. She inquired about the direction to the March Hare's house. Not receiving a clear answer, she continued on her way. As she neared the March Hare's peculiar house with chimney-ears and a fur-thatched roof, Alice hesitated, fearing madness. Upon arrival, she found the March Hare and the Hatter having tea with a sleepy Dormouse. The Hatter fiddled with his watch uneasily, discussing the best butter and time manipulation. The Dormouse, irritated by Alice's question, hinted at a story about living at the bottom of a well.

Alice found herself in a peculiar situation where she was surrounded by a group of characters in a garden. The gardeners were painting white roses red to avoid trouble with the Queen. As Alice watched, she was spotted by the gardeners who immediately bowed to her. The Queen arrived with a grand procession, including soldiers, courtiers, royal children, and important guests like the White Rabbit. The Knave of Hearts carried the King's crown, and finally, the King and Queen of Hearts made their entrance. Alice was unsure if she should also lie down like the gardeners, but she decided to stand and observe the procession. The Queen noticed the gardeners lying around the rose-tree and questioned their identity, unable to distinguish them due to their position.|"['1.

The Queen, after inspecting the roses, ordered the soldiers to behead the gardeners. Alice intervened, saving them and hiding them in a flower-pot. The soldiers, unable to find them, rejoined the procession. The Rabbit warned Alice that the Queen had sentenced her to execution for boxing her ears. The game of croquet began with live hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes as mallets. Alice struggled to control her flamingo, leading to comical situations. The chaotic game had players fighting and the Queen frequently demanding beheadings. Alice, fearing a dispute with the Queen, pondered her escape. Spotting the Cheshire-Cat, she eagerly awaited a conversation. After the Cat's head fully appeared, Alice shared her croquet experience with it.|"['1.

Alice was upset about the unfairness and chaos in the game. She complained that the players quarreled, didn't follow rules, and were confusing. Alice was about to hit the Queen's hedgehog in croquet, but it ran away. She thought it wasn't worth finishing the game because the Queen was likely to win. As she went to check on the game, she heard the Queen screaming and sentencing players to execution for missing turns. Alice then saw a fight between hedgehogs, but they disappeared. She decided to find her hedgehog. When she returned, she found a dispute between the executioner, the King, and the Queen.

Alice found herself in a peculiar situation. The Queen had ordered numerous executions, leaving all players but the King, Queen, and Alice in custody. As they walked away, the King pardoned everyone. Alice then encountered a Gryphon, who led her to the sorrowful Mock Turtle. The Mock Turtle shared his experiences of schooling under the sea, taught by an old Turtle they called Tortoise. The Gryphon scolded Alice for asking simple questions, leaving her feeling embarrassed. The Mock Turtle described the fascinating Lobster-Quadrille dance, captivating Alice's curiosity. The creatures sat quietly, reflecting on the dance, ending the encounter with a sense of melancholy.|['1.

Alice was eager to know what trial was taking place as she ran alongside the Gryphon. The Gryphon, however, urged her to keep up the pace without answering her question. As they hurried on, the faint sound of melancholy words reached them on the breeze, indicating that the King and Queen of Hearts were already seated on their throne. A crowd had gathered around them, including various birds, beasts, and the pack of cards. The Knave stood chained before them, flanked by guards, while the White Rabbit held a trumpet and a scroll of parchment nearby.

"Alice observed the White Rabbit struggling with a list, eager to know the next witness. To her surprise, the White Rabbit called out ""Alice!"" in a high-pitched voice. Startled, Alice jumped up, knocking over the jury-box. Apologizing, she hurried to pick up the jurymen, likening them to goldfish she had upset earlier. After the jury composed themselves, they diligently wrote about the incident. The Lizard, however, was too shocked to do anything. The King then declared that individuals over a mile tall must leave the court, causing confusion.
