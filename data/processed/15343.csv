Equipped with snowshoes he had made, Henry changed into his Scout uniform and set out into the snow-covered prairie.

The sky cleared quickly, revealing a few stars. Using his camping knowledge, the boy navigated by the stars to avoid getting lost.

Inside, he encountered three children, one introducing herself as Mary. Their father had left for Kiowa, leaving them alone.

It was Christmas morning, a day marking the birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem over nineteen hundred years ago. The child was born in humble surroundings, lacking even the basic comforts. Homeless and sheltered in a stable, the mother endured pain without protection. The scene of the birth paints a vivid picture of meekness and simplicity. Imagining the travelers nearby, engrossed in their revelry, while the cry of anguish from the shelter went unnoticed, brings a sense of stark contrast. The indifference or jest towards such news highlights the disparity between the grandeur of kings and the modesty of this birth.

On a winter night, the world lay in stillness, yet people went about their daily lives. They loved, worked, hoped, and dreamed as they always had. In the Bethlehem hills, a divine event unfolded quietly. A bright star shone overhead, visible to all, pointing to a sacred spot. The heavens proclaimed the birth of a Child with an angelic chorus. Despite the humble setting, people worldwide continue to revere this Child and His mother. From the snowy North to the tropical South, adoration persists. Even soldiers in battle pause, sailors at sea yearn for peace, and all eyes turn to the manger. The birth known as the Incarnation is a profound mystery that transcends human understanding. The simplicity and humility of this divine birth challenge worldly expectations. The King arrived not in grandeur but as a vulnerable Child, embodying poverty and humility.

"We shall not journey to Bethlehem alone. The humble shepherds came to the manger that night. They understood. To them, it was not odd that their God was poor, for they too were poor. I ponder how much the shepherds pondered. Their occupation fosters contemplation; they spend much time in solitude with nature. Did they think, ""God has come to us as a poor man because so many of us are poor""? Many poor souls have gazed at the sky and wondered if God grasped their plight. God always knew and cared, but by being born poor, He showed He understood. The Wise Men also came to the manger. They were learned and wise, seeing Divinity where others did not. The poor shepherds and the rich wise men both worshipped the Working Man, Jesus."|"['1.

Some of you who read this and many more who cannot are poor, perhaps very poor, but you can stand beside that manger and look at that Baby’s face. You can reflect upon the Child, how He grew, what He said, what He did, until a cross casts its dark shadow across your vision. The war is raising many crosses, and many walk the _via dolorosa_ to them today. You shall be blessed if you can gaze at that cross until it is transformed by the glory of the resurrection. In it all, you see your God—the poor man’s God, the rich man’s God, everybody’s God. Your God was poor, humble, struggled under adverse conditions, and suffered all things. Only a very great God could endure such pain. He understands your trouble. The poor and the bereaved have as much right to see their God in that manger as the rich and carefree. He came for all, rich and poor. He is the God of all classes, a democracy in which all are equal. Whether rich or poor, sorrowful ones can go to Bethlehem, look into the cradle, and claim the Child as their God. He notices your sorrow, offers comfort, and takes your hand.|"[""1.

During this Christmas morning, we think of loved ones who are far away, even those bravely serving. Remember, our Lord came for family, creating one by His arrival. Those distant are not forgotten; they are with Him, experiencing peace. Although we can't hold their hands or hear their voices, they remain in our hearts. Let's not forget their joy in His presence.

The West was settled by people from the East, and while there are similarities, life in the West offers more opportunities for personal growth. Westerners are often seen as brighter, quicker, and more progressive than their Eastern counterparts. The demanding frontier life brings out the best qualities needed for survival. However, some Easterners still hold onto outdated views. The East fails to understand the West's true potential and culture. Despite this, Western communities are often cleaner, better run, and more advanced than Eastern ones. The West has embraced modern amenities like water works and electricity, even in smaller towns. The West's resilience and resourcefulness are valuable assets, often more important than wealth. The West's climate can be extreme, with snowy Christmas mornings contrasting with rainy days. Nevertheless, the people remain thankful and optimistic in the face of challenges.|"['1.

I rented a sturdy sleigh and two horses to reach my destination, a quaint church in the prairie. Inside, a feeble fire barely warmed the room, filling it with smoke. The wind blew through the ill-fitting windows and doors, leaving snow on the altar. Despite the storm, only twelve people attended. The service, held in a buffalo overcoat, was brief. Afterward, I dined at a nearby farm. The simple meal of cornbread, ham, and scarce potatoes was a stark contrast to the usual Christmas feasts. The children, accustomed to meager fare, were delighted by the ham and a surprise mince-pie turnover. Touched by their joy, I returned to the church and adorned a collection basket with sewing supplies, creating a makeshift gift for the children.

A boy received a nearly new penknife, while a girl was gifted a church basket filled with sewing supplies. Their faces lit up with awe and joy as they explored the thoughtful presents.

One winter, I found myself stranded on a snow-bound train in the West. The Christmas spirit was overshadowed by the storm. Strangers became companions as we huddled around a stove, sharing stories and provisions. Among us was a widow with two children, dreaming of a Christmas with their grandmother. Despite the disappointment, the widow’s basket of food kept us fed. As night fell, we created makeshift beds for the children. Before they slept, a heartwarming scene unfolded as the men removed their hats as the children prayed. Each man felt the urge to give something to the kids, showing kindness in the face of adversity.

The rancher and cowboy found themselves in a similar situation. The rancher offered whiskey, feeling it inappropriate, while the cowboy insisted on buying chips for the game. They spent hours examining the goods spread out by a generous man on the train. The spirit of Christmas infected everyone, and they gathered a load of items for a grateful mother. The children and adults were thrilled by the festive decorations and gifts, including a generous donation. A heartfelt service was held, and the mother sang a hymn, moving the congregation. The cowboy turned to the whiskey flask for comfort. Later, a train-hand returned with a cooked turkey, delighting the children with a Christmas feast. The narrator, distributing clothing to those in need, recalled his own childhood disappointment with practical gifts. However, a box filled with toys and games brought joy to the children, making it a memorable Christmas.|"['1.
