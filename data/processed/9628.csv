Ariston rushed outside to find a hail of gray pebbles raining down from the sky, burning his face and stinging his arms. He heard a shrill cry from the other end of the house and found his master's sick son, Caius, lying exposed to the elements. Ariston remembered his master was away seeking a physician for the boy.

The ground shook beneath Ariston several times, feeling like a ship in a storm. Thunder and trembling made the house quake. A bronze statue wobbled on a column, crashing down in the earthquake. Covered by falling stones, Ariston grew more afraid, imagining Death lurking. Alone and fearing for his sick companion, Caius, Ariston wrapped them both in a blanket, tying Caius to his back. With a pillow over his head, he fled the house, passing his painting where Apollo seemed to smile. The street was filled with soft pebbles, forcing Ariston to crawl out.

Everyone was attempting to protect their most valuable possessions, rushing towards the gate at the far end as their means of escape. Ariston, feeling the urgency, picked up his pace and ran. Suddenly, the ground shook beneath him, accompanied by a deafening roar. It seemed as if the mountain was collapsing. Glancing back, he witnessed the columns of the porch swaying dangerously. A man emerged from a nearby building, attempting to flee, but the walls crumbled around him, burying him. Ariston, horrified by the unfolding chaos, prayed for safety. Exiting the forum, he descended a steep street towards the gate, joining a throng of people seeking refuge outside the city. The atmosphere was filled with cries and commotion, overshadowed by the volcanic eruption. Dust clouded the air, making it difficult to see and breathe. Ariston tore his garment to cover his face, shielding himself from the ash shower. Looking back, he saw the ominous cloud extending from the mountain, while ahead, the sun appeared as a mere red speck in the ash-filled sky. People scattered in all directions, seeking shelter under rocks, trees, or in nearby houses.

The mighty sea roared and churned violently, swallowing a ship whole before Ariston's eyes. The waves surged, reaching hundreds of feet up the shore, leaving strange fish gasping on the dry land. Rocks fell from the sky, creating steam as they crashed into the water. As darkness loomed, Ariston feared he would never see Athens again. Suddenly, a small boat arrived, rescuing him from the chaos. He awoke to shouts, finding himself in the boat as it plunged into the sea and soared into the sky. Tetreius barked orders, rowers toiling with sweat and seawater. Eventually, they made it to a waiting ship, propelled by oars and billowing sails, guided by a stern-faced master.

For an hour, the fast boat battled against the waves. The rowers worked hard, rowing desperately. The captain was brave, his heart unwavering. The wind was on their side. Eventually, they reached peaceful waters. Suddenly, fire erupted from the mountain, casting a red glow. The ship was engulfed in red light. When the fire subsided, darkness blanketed everything. Ariston felt suffocated with fear. The slaves screamed, and their leader tried to calm them. Whips cracked, and the mountain roared. Ash rained down, but the rowers continued.

In ancient times, a mighty mountain stood tall, covered in dense woods below and craggy cliffs above. At its peak lay a deep cave, rumored to reach the mountain's base, where a flickering fire danced. Periodically, like a roaring beast, the mountain would bellow, spewing massive cinders that posed a deadly threat to anyone in their path. Despite the occasional eruptions, the air around the mountain remained pure and healthy. Villages flourished at its base, unaware that they dwelled above the ruins of an ancient city, with vines drawing water from buried Roman structures. Centuries later, a catastrophic eruption devastated the land, causing earthquakes, darkness, and rivers of molten lava that consumed villages and lives. The mountain's wrath left a lasting mark on the landscape, reminding all of its power and unpredictability.|['1.

Since ancient times, Mount Vesuvius has been quite active. Eruptions have occurred almost every year, accompanied by thunder, earthquakes, showers of lava, causing significant damage at times. Even during its calm periods, a cloud typically hovers above its summit, sometimes white like steam, other times black and swirling like dust. Despite its danger, Vesuvius is remarkably beautiful. Its tall, graceful peak stands against the sky, often adorned with a waving plume of cloud. At night, the mountain disappears into darkness, but the glowing red rivers of lava flowing down its sides light up the sky. It is a sight both captivating and fearsome, akin to a tiger. Many have been drawn to Vesuvius, climbing it to peer into its crater, a glimpse into the earth's core.

One night, I witnessed a volcanic eruption with fiery flames shooting from the mountain. Red-hot stones soared into the sky, then cascaded like skyrockets. Through my telescope, I saw liquid lava bubbling over the crater’s edge, flowing down the sides. The mountain's peak glowed red with molten rock, surrounded by flames of changing colors. Another night, an earthquake shook the ground as Vesuvius erupted. The mountaintop glowed with red-hot matter, roaring and shooting fire into the air. Explosions echoed, shaking doors and windows, scattering objects. Despite the dangers, I decided to climb the volcano with friends. We rode horses part of the way, then trekked on foot over smoking hot rocks and suffocating ash, braving sulfur fumes.|"['1.

As we chatted, huge rocks were hurled out of the volcano, rolling dangerously close to us. To avoid being hit, I shielded my face with my hat and dashed across the lava stream. The molten rock was thick and heavy, scorching my hands and burning my boots but not pulling me under. My friends followed suit, and we reached safety on the other side. After climbing for thirty minutes, we reached the source of the flowing lava. It didn't spill over the crater's edge but gushed through a hole in the cone. The lava flowed smoothly, glowing like honey and shining brilliantly. Even heavy stones barely made a dent, floating down the stream. The lava changed color as it cooled, from golden to dark red, finally turning black and solid at the base of the mountain.|"['1.

We climbed higher above the arch and found a chimney in the rock with smoke and steam coming out. As I approached, the strong smell of sulphur overwhelmed me. I carefully picked some pure sulphur from the rock's edge. Peering down the hole, I saw red-hot lava flowing beneath us, making the mountain seem like a boiling pot. Earlier, we traversed gentle slopes through vineyards, fields, and villages. The landscape changed to rocky terrain with wild plants growing where the lava had turned into soil. We encountered old lava streams, piles of cinders, and twisted rock formations. Near smoking holes, remnants of red rivers from the night before lay cooled and blackened. Stepping on the hot ground, I felt the warmth and smelled iron in the air. The crust beneath us was thin, hiding red-hot lava flowing below, reminding me of the mountain's fiery nature.|['1.

For centuries, people have witnessed the mighty Vesuvius in action, spewing out tons of lava, glassy boulders, pumice stones, and fine ashes. This ancient volcano, older than any city or civilization, has created a mountain of its own with its explosive eruptions. The rocks it produces contain various minerals like iron, copper, and even precious stones like garnets and topaz. The ashes and dust it releases not only shape the landscape nearby but also travel far, carried by winds and ocean currents. Over time, the volcanic debris settles and forms a soft rock called tufa. The fertile lands surrounding Vesuvius owe their richness to the volcanic activity, with crops like tomatoes, grapes, and olives flourishing in the nutrient-rich soil created by the volcano's eruptions.|"['1.

Vesuvius is not the only volcano shaping the land; it is surrounded by a group of active volcanoes. Just ten miles away, there are over a dozen old craters. Further out in the bay, a volcano rises from the water. A hundred miles south lie small volcanic islands with hot springs, one even spouting every few minutes, acting as a beacon at night. One of these islands emerged just two thousand years ago during an earthquake witnessed by the people of Pompeii. South of these islands stands Mt. Aetna in Sicily, a larger and more active volcano than Vesuvius. This region, including places like Iceland, Mexico, and Japan, is a hub of volcanic and seismic activity, revealing the Earth's inner workings.

When visiting Pompeii, you will step through ancient gates in the thick walls, past watchtowers, and onto the same stones walked on by people fleeing the volcano almost two thousand years ago. Climbing a steep street once used by fishermen and sailors, you'll reach the forum, once bustling with merchants and buyers but now quiet and empty. Among the ruins, you'll find the temple of Jupiter, where a statue within a statue was discovered, left unfinished by an artist interrupted by the eruption. The excavators uncovered evidence of a previous earthquake that struck sixteen years before the eruption, causing damage that the city's residents had started to repair before the volcano's devastation.|"['1.

In a small town, archaeologists have discovered a variety of artifacts like bronze tables, lamps, wine jars, kitchen utensils, glass vases, silver cups, gold hairpins, jewelry, and statues made of bronze and marble. However, they found fewer treasures than expected, with many pedestals empty and paintings missing from walls. The excavators believe that after a volcanic eruption, residents returned to salvage their valuable items from the ruins. One significant discovery was a farmhouse on Vesuvius' slope, containing olive and wine presses, a courtyard for making wine, and a skeleton with gold coins, jewelry, and a set of silver dishes adorned with intricate designs. The origin of these treasures remains a mystery, raising questions about wealthy residents fleeing the volcanic disaster.

In the valley below the towering hill covered in dark green trees, a small stream flowed down to meet a winding river. Nestled in the convergence of these waterways was Olympia, a city of ancient stone structures like temples and walls. Surrounding this sacred area were tents of various shapes and sizes, from simple skins draped over sticks to colorful striped canvas tents. The meadow was bustling with activity as men in vibrant robes moved about, tending to horses, sculpting statues, and offering barber services.

Around the warm courtyard circled a deep, shady walkway. Here, boys lounged on the tiled ground or on stone benches, taking a break from their activities. Close to Charmides, a young man with his back turned was using a tool to scrape oil and dirt off his body. Charmides' eyes sparkled with delight at the sight of the strong, rounded legs and the muscles working in the shoulders of the athlete. When the athlete turned around, Charmides recognized him as Creon and ran to embrace him. After a cheerful exchange, Menon and Charmides bid farewell and made their way through the lively crowd to their camp on Mount Kronion. Under a linen cover, they found a table laid with cheese, bread, figs, and lettuce. Nearby, goats grazed as a man milked one.

When the graceful swan spreads its wings to land on the swirling waters of a rushing stream, it sends a message to Apollo. Similarly, when a melodious minstrel plays his lyre and plucks the strings, he offers a prayer to Apollo. Now, as a devoted bard with a heart full of reverence, I raise my voice to Apollo, the god of music. The bard then sang of the legendary minstrel Orpheus, who enchanted trees, tamed wild beasts, and moved rocks with his music. The boy, captivated by the song, imagined wandering through the enchanting garden of the dead or riding alongside Artemis in her moon chariot. As morning broke, the entire camp awoke early, adorned in their finest attire, bearing gifts for the gods.

Once the parade reached a small, ancient temple made of sun-dried bricks covered in plaster, Charmides and his father smiled at each other. As they walked through the temple's columns, each uniquely painted and shaped, they entered a long aisle flanked by open rooms with statues of marble, gold, and ivory. At the front, priests prayed to Zeus and Hera. Suddenly, Charmides stopped in awe before a room where Hermes stood with baby Dionysus. Charmed by the sight, he reached out to touch the golden sandal and gazed into Hermes' blue eyes, laughing at the baby's playful arms. After a sacrifice to Zeus, they entered the grand temple, where a massive pile of sacred ashes formed an altar.

Long ago, Olympia was a bustling place where grand games were held every four years. The plain was vibrant with new statues, gifts, and buildings. People from all over the world came to admire its beauty. Unfortunately, Greece faced misfortune as cities fought and were conquered. Romans took Greek treasures and statues to adorn their own land, leaving Olympia deserted. The emperor later stopped the games and took away the remaining treasures. Olympia fell into disrepair, with dust swirling under abandoned porches, animals making homes in temples, and statues crumbling into the river. It became a lonely place, forgotten by many, as nature slowly reclaimed what was once grand.|['1.

Long ago, people settled amidst the ruins, turning an old temple floor into a church. Men inhabited Zeus's temple, while women worked where the golden statue once stood. In Hera's temple, a wine press was set up. Did they realize the marble baby statue nearby represented the god of the vineyard who taught men to make wine? Using broken statues and temple stones, they erected a wall to ward off enemies. Discovering bronze warriors or marble gods, they likely crafted curious tales, having nearly forgotten the ancient Greeks. Marble statues were used for lime to plaster houses, while bronze ones were melted for tools. An earthquake struck, causing buildings to collapse, statues to break, and the town to be deserted.

About a century ago, English, German, and French explorers began visiting Greece not to see the new structures but to uncover the ancient remnants of its past glory. Intrigued by tales of Olympia in ancient Greek texts, they received funding to excavate the site. In October, the digging commenced, unearthing vases, figures, and pieces of statues.

The Temple of Zeus, believed to be magnificent, had figures in Parian marble. Zeus, central in the pediment, granted victory to Pelops, who then initiated the Olympic Games. The Labors of Herakles were depicted in marble near the temple. A statue of Victory, found near the temple, symbolizes gratitude for victory.

In ancient Greece, a magnificent statue resembling a goddess descending from heaven once stood on a towering thirty-foot base. The Greek artist who crafted this statue believed that beauty lies not only in the physical form but also in the mind and spirit. Today, the original statue resides in the Metropolitan Museum, a testament to the artist's vision.

As the guide spoke, the man explored the walls. He inspected every shadow, probed each crevice with a stick, and ran his hands over the stones. Turning to the guide, he confirmed the city's former glory. Mycenae, a once bustling city, housed beautiful people, not giants. Poets immortalized King Agamemnon's rule and the city's grandeur in song. However, with time, weak rulers and dwindling warriors left Mycenae vulnerable. Enemies invaded, destroying the city and scattering its inhabitants. For centuries, nature reclaimed the land, covering the ruins with flowers and grass. Despite the passage of time, the man vowed to reveal Mycenae's history, promising to uncover the secrets of their ancestors' lives buried beneath the ancient city's remnants.|"['1.

"""This is the grand entrance to the city,"" Dr. Schliemann explained. ""Long ago, the king and his soldiers marched through this gate. However, it's now filled with dirt that we need to clear out to reach the ancient stones they once walked on.""

Dr. Schliemann continued, ""In the past, the warriors of Mycenae defended this gate against the men of Argos, their foes. There was a fierce battle with arrows flying and stones being hurled. Eventually, the people of Mycenae ran out of food, and the Argives breached the gate, forcing the Mycenaeans out.""

Dr. Schliemann and his team tirelessly excavated the ancient city of Mycenae. They dug a massive hole outside the city, carefully sifting through each spadeful of dirt for precious artifacts. Despite the scorching August sun and dusty winds, they remained dedicated. Every discovery, whether a terra cotta goblet or a bronze ax, filled them with excitement. Initially, Dr. Schliemann closely inspected every find, but as the weeks passed, he trained his team to identify and preserve valuable items. The excavators diligently searched the earth, handing over any discoveries to be examined. Although only a few treasures had been unearthed after months of hard work, Dr. Schliemann remained hopeful, studying old Greek texts and drawing plans of Mycenae. As November brought rain and challenges, the team pressed on, eager for more remarkable discoveries beneath the ancient city.|"['1.

Long ago in Mycenae, the king's palace stood proudly on a hill. It wasn't just one building but many, including a grand hall for warriors, a spacious room for women's work, bedrooms, treasure vaults, baths, and storehouses. Narrow passages connected the rooms, with flat roofs covered in thatch and clay. The palace had open courts with tinted concrete floors and painted friezes on the walls. Thick stone walls surrounded the palace. A similar palace at Tiryns near Mycenae has been uncovered, allowing visitors to wander through the ancient king's house. They can explore the courtyard, imagine the warriors feasting in the great hall, and picture Greek maidens carrying water vases. The palace reveals the artistic skills of the people of old Mycenae through intricate carvings and precious artifacts.|"[""1.

Dr. Schliemann discovered a treasure of golden gifts in a circle, which he gifted to Greece. These treasures can now be viewed in the Museum at Athens. The stone above the gateway is incredibly sturdy, with a triangular space left above to reduce weight. This space was filled with a thinner stone carved with two lions, although their heads are missing. The lions were likely made of bronze and stood out from the stone. Despite some believing it was a giant's oven, it was actually a tomb where people of Mycenae worshipped their deceased. The tomb was elaborately decorated with marbles and bronze plates. From these remains, we learn about the Mycenaeans' art, government, trade, religion, daily life, and military practices from three thousand years ago.|"['1.
