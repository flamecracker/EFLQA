"""They float fine,"" said one boy, still peering through marine glasses at the biplane. ""But how do they take off again? Don't they need to roll on the bicycle wheels first?""

"Longley exclaimed, ""That's a strange thing to see!"" as he used the glasses to survey the lake and a biplane hovering above it. A surprising reply came, ""It's a baby, almost falling overboard.""

"""Watch the biplane!"" exclaimed Mr. Marsh as Larry, now barefoot, clenched his hands in anticipation.

"""Yes, sir,"" the boy replied promptly. ""Andy and I always hunt together. We're known as the Siamese Twins because we stick together. If you find one Bird boy, you'll find the other close by.

Frank and Larry were excited about the idea of camping out in the shop. Larry convinced Frank by suggesting they wouldn't take up much space. They both were happy to have the freedom to enter the workshop as they pleased. Suddenly, they noticed two hay wagons carrying crates of merchandise and recognized Percy Shelley Carberry and his friend Sandy Hollingshead. Percy had ordered a new aeroplane, which made the boys curious. The situation got more interesting when Percy's group stopped to talk to some men in a car, including the ones Frank and Larry were discussing earlier. It seemed like the mystery surrounding the boys with the aeroplane was growing, and there was a sense of anticipation in the air.|"['1.
