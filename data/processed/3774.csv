"Old Akla, the village Medicine Man, was astonished when he learned about the twins. He insisted, ""This has never happened before! Seals and humans do not bear twins; there is magic at play."" As the days grew longer in early spring, the sun lingered longer in the sky until it never set at all. The twins, Kesshoo and Koolee, enjoyed the best of times. They played with their dogs, Nip and Tup, who were faster due to their lifelong practice of running on all fours. The twins tumbled out of their igloo, with Menie rolling like a ball down the snowy slope. Menie had a special sled made by his father from driftwood. The twins' world consisted of igloos, rocks, snow, and the moonlight. The barks of Nip and Tup woke Koko, signaling the twins' return."|"[""1.

Three children, Monnie, Menie, and Koko, headed towards the Big Rock. Monnie rode the sled while Menie and Koko pulled it. The Big Rock had a steep side and a slanting side where they planned to coast down. The pups followed, sliding in some spots. The sled hit ice, spun sideways, and tossed the kids into the snow. Laughter turned to silence as the little dogs growled. The children, descendants of hunters, cautiously approached the rock's edge. Inside the igloo, Kesshoo and Koolee emerged, and everyone chattered excitedly. The villagers, armed with knives and lances, joined the commotion as the bear approached. Kesshoo bravely faced the bear, lancing it as the village women, with hair down like their mother's, stood ready with knives. The bear fell silent, defeated.|['1.

When the group reached the bear, everyone gathered around it. Each person dipped their fingers in the bear's blood and then sucked on them. This was a way to show the bears how much they wanted to hunt them. As they tasted the blood, they called out which part of the bear they desired. It was a bit of a challenge to round up the dogs as they were uncooperative. Tooky, the mother of Nip and Tup, cleverly pretended to be ill. While Koolee, Koko, and Menie prepared the sled and dog-team, the other women used their unique knives to skin the bear. Once everything was set, Koolee cracked the whip to get the dogs moving. The dogs, hungry and eager, pulled the sled back to the village, leaving a red stain on the white snow where the bear was slain. Upon returning, the dogs were fed bones while the villagers shared water from a stone bowl. Menie, eager to be brave, gulped down the water too quickly and choked. Koolee distributed the bear meat among the villagers, reserving the best parts for the Angakok's wives and Koko's mother.|"[""1.

"The storage area wasn't like a house but a massive stone platform on legs, resembling a giant's table. Meat was stored on top, out of reach from dogs. Koolee led everyone, placing the bear's head on a bench, nose pointing towards the Big Rock, sealing nostrils with moss and grease to prevent its scent. ""Bears love grease,"" she explained. Believing in signs and magic, Koolee said, ""Your grandfather sent this bear's spirit. Choose a gift for him."" Menie offered a carved fish, symbolizing a gift. The Angakok praised their choices, recalling the twins' grandfather's generosity, especially with bear liver.

The wise Angakok expressed concern about changing times where people prioritize themselves over others. Despite this, Kesshoo showed kindness by giving the Angakok the bear's liver. Impressed, the Angakok acknowledged Kesshoo's just nature and promised a reward for his actions. As the people dispersed, Menie and Monnie discussed their love for unique foods like reindeer's stomach and fish eyes. They planned to eat and then go fishing. Inside their igloo, their mother tended to the oil lamp, their only source of light and heat, fueled by dried moss. This lamp, made of soapstone, resembled a clamshell with moss wicks. The scene captured a blend of tradition, kindness, and family warmth in the Arctic setting.|"[""1.

Over the fire, a stone pan hung from a rack tied by leather thongs. Inside, bear's meat simmered, filling the air with a delicious smell. Koolee, the twins' mother, cut chunks of fat for them to eat while they waited for the meat to cook. With their hands full of food, the twins struggled to grab their fishing rods stuck in the igloo walls. Kesshoo, their father, hung the dogs' harnesses high on a narwhal tusk pole to keep them safe from the dogs. The twins, eager to fish before sunset, ran to their father with mouths full, unable to speak clearly. Monnie, in her rush, swallowed her meat whole, causing a funny moment. The family made their way to the beach, with the twins gobbling their food eagerly on the thick ice as they followed their father and the dogs.|"[""1.

The twins had finished their meat, leaving some as bait. They placed the bait on their hooks, squatted by the holes, and waited patiently. As the sun set, Nip and Tup played on the ice. Suddenly, Monnie felt a strong tug on her line, causing her to grab the rod just in time. She put more bait on and dropped the hook again. When darkness fell, Monnie decided to leave, feeling cold. The sky lit up with dazzling colors, with streamers flashing from the Edge of the World. The twins were amazed by the breathtaking display, unlike anything they had seen before in the sky.|['1.

Koolee marveled at the bright sky, sharing a tale about spirits of children playing harmlessly. Unsettled by the thought of Giants, the twins hurried home with fresh bear's meat. Kesshoo suggested a feast, as the village lacked fresh food. The family lived in a snow house until Koolee built a stone igloo. Kesshoo promised to help build a snow house for the dogs. The twins marked a circle and cut snow blocks, but struggled with the roof. Monnie helped pack snow, but the dogs evaded the twins. Kesshoo intervened to protect Koolee from the hungry dogs.|"['1.

The dogs eagerly chased the dried fish thrown by a woman into a snow hut until they were full and fell asleep. The Angakok, a man known for his plumpness despite his thin wives, got stuck in the entrance of his igloo, causing a commotion. Everyone, including the Angakok's wives and others, got stuck in the tunnel behind him. The noise of the chaos inside the tunnel reached the igloo, where Kesshoo, Koolee, the twins, Nip, and Tup observed in amazement. The Angakok's wives and Koko's mother bumped into each other, causing the baby to cry loudly, adding to the clamor. Nip and Tup, unaware of the Angakok's status, barked at him, thinking he shouldn't be there.|"['1.

The Angakok was furious and tossed Nip onto the sleeping bench, surprising both Nip and Menie. A sudden pull in front and a push from behind by Kesshoo, Koolee, and the two wives led to the Angakok sitting near the fire, still angry. The wives scuttled to a corner of the bench. The Angakok began eating a large chunk of meat without utensils. They all feasted voraciously, their lives depending on the food. The women chatted while Koolee showed off a fur suit she was making. The twins and Koko discussed making a hare trap. The baby slept on furs, and Menie fed the pups. Nip and Tup buried their bones under the baby and slept. The Angakok turned to the wall, signaling a story or song. Everyone listened intently, as the Angakok shared his knowledge of the sun, moon, and stars.|['1.

In the calm underwater world where the Spirits of the Dead reside, shadows of rocks, islands, and glaciers dance on the smooth water. An elder shared a tale of bringing back seals and walruses to prevent starvation among the Inuit. He described the saucer of the Old Woman of the Sea, teeming with sea creatures like whales and seals. To reach this underworld, he called upon his guiding spirit, Tornak, who led him through a perilous journey. They crossed a slippery wheel over an abyss and passed boiling oil cauldrons. After a daunting wait, the dog guarding the Old Woman's house slept briefly, allowing them to cross a narrow bridge to her dwelling.|"['1.

"Once we crossed the bridge, we bravely entered the Old Woman's house. She was a fearsome sight with a hand as large as a walrus and teeth like coastal rocks! The Angakok whispered, ""But when she saw me, she trembled. She recognized my power as a great Angakok. I spoke kindly and then mentioned my children's hunger."" Despite my pleas, she refused, so I grew furious and threatened. With a thunderous voice, I seized her hair and overturned a saucer. My strength overcame her sorcery!

Kesshoo swiftly extinguished the lamp and covered the tunnel entrance with a thick hide, plunging the room into palpable darkness. Everyone sat in silence, listening to strange voices that resembled the Angakok's, praising his powers. The voices claimed to float invisibly, boasting of knowledge of celestial secrets and the ability to reach the moon. When the light returned, it was revealed that the Angakok's spirit had supposedly left his body and roamed freely. Laughter erupted, except from Menie and the Angakok, who warned Koko's father about the disrespectful behavior. Kesshoo then shared his adventure of encountering a settlement with wooden houses and fair-haired men led by a chief named Nansen, who planned an unprecedented journey across the ice to where the Giants resided.|"['1.

Kesshoo believed the great chief might have been devoured by the Giants, but he wasn't certain as he never returned to confirm. Even if the chief had been eaten, no one would ever know. Kesshoo then displayed a magnificent knife from the white chief and two steel needles traded for a sealskin. Koolee treasured the needles in a tiny ivory case, using them solely for her finest sewing work. Proud of her skills, Koolee's sewing surpassed all others in the village due to the quality of her needles. This inspired the villagers to don their upper garments, bid farewell, and descend into the tunnel. Lastly, the Angakok hesitated, causing worry among Kesshoo, Koolee, and the Angakok's wives. After a moment, the Angakok proceeded, and the day after the feast hinted at the arrival of spring with sightings of ravens and sea-birds. Plans for a hunting trip unfolded, with Kesshoo, Koko's father, Menie, and their dogs preparing to embark on the journey.|"['1.

Kesshoo led the boys quietly towards the gorge's head, cautioning them to silence to avoid scaring off the reindeer. As they approached a potential reindeer spot, Kesshoo advised them to change direction to prevent the wind from carrying their scent towards the animals. Following Kesshoo's guidance, they circled to the north and discovered fresh reindeer tracks. The hunters swiftly took down a reindeer, while another dashed away. The dogs, excited by the hunt, pulled ahead, dragging Koko and Menie through the snow. Despite the bumps and bruises, the boys stayed silent, knowing any noise could spook the game. Meanwhile, back at the igloo, Monnie and Koolee hurried to join the hunters upon hearing Tooky's bark, with everyone celebrating the successful hunt, and the Angakok claiming his share of the reindeer.|"[""1.

"The wise Angakok decided to take the reindeer's stomach as he had dreamt about it. He shared his dream where his Tornak instructed him to consume a reindeer's stomach given by a grateful child. The twins were fortunate to have a father skilled in kyak hunting. One day, Menie and Koko ventured out alone on the ice to hunt. The seals in the cold country gnaw holes in the ice to breathe and sleep in igloos under the snow. Menie learned about seal hunting from his father and recognized the seal's presence by the distinct ""plopping"" noise. As Koko aimed at the birds, Menie spotted a seal hole and approached it cautiously."|"['1.

Menie bravely thrust his lance into the snow, causing the snow house to collapse with him inside. Despite the fall, Menie held onto his lance, realizing he had struck a seal. With determination, he carefully uncovered a young white seal, too small to swim away. Menie worried about being seen but called out loudly, attracting his father's attention. His father swiftly came to his rescue in a kyak, a small boat, amidst dangerous floating ice. Menie's father instructed him to secure the ice with a harpoon, and they started their perilous journey back to shore, navigating through treacherous ice floes. After safely reaching the shore, Menie's father released the ice raft and rescued a floating bladder, showcasing his impressive skills even in challenging situations.|"['1.

Kesshoo pursued the weak seal towards the ice, planning to tow it once it surfaced. With a powerful sweep of his paddle, he lifted his kayak onto the solid ice and sprang out. He pulled Menie's raft close, ready to catch the seal. As they neared the beach, the villagers cheered the great hunter. Koolee, proud of her son, distributed the seal meat. Koolee carefully crafted mittens from the white seal skin for the twins. Monnie cherished her doll, Annadore, dressed in fur like a baby. Nip and Tup, the playful dogs, caused a minor accident burying Annadore. Kesshoo and Koolee spent their time crafting tools and clothes, with intricate carvings adorning their creations.|['1.

Kesshoo enjoyed hunting eggs and setting fox traps on the cliff. He also helped Menie and Koko set up a trap for hares. Each season brought new activities. Menie and Monnie reminisced about the summer days when they didn't need to dive into their house through a hole. They decided it was time to put up tents for the upcoming season. Koko's father mentioned that it was safe to start as the ice melted, and the reindeer would come down for fresh moss. The twins helped gather supplies for the tents, including their sled and fishing rods. Everyone prepared for the journey to the beach, packing boats with essentials. Koolee removed stones from the roof of the igloo to prepare for the trip. After a meal of walrus meat and blubber, they settled down on the roof, excited for the adventures ahead. Menie and Monnie marveled at the bright sky through the open roof, eagerly anticipating the journey when they woke up. The families loaded into boats, ready for the next chapter of their adventure.|"['1.

The kids sat at the boat's bottom, but the twins and Koko could peek over. While the babies played, they watched the shores. They passed the Big Rock with flying auks and puffins. They saw puffins' red feet and a fox waiting to catch a bird. Beyond green slopes, they saw hills with white ice caps and streams pouring into the bay. A river of ice emerged from hills. Suddenly, a cracking sound scared Menie. They heard a loud crack as a piece broke off, followed by a splash. They followed the Angakok to avoid an iceberg. They reached a sunny valley. The Angakok made fire with sticks. Men caught salmon with spears. They cooked and ate, and babies slept.|"['1.

The women moved further up the beach, where the air was calm, except for the gentle sounds of water, distant chatter, the Angakok's snores, and buzzing mosquitoes. Everyone took a rest, except Menie and Koko, who played with shells and pebbles. They watched as mosquitoes buzzed around the Angakok, who eventually woke up and swatted one on his nose. Startled, he looked around, suspecting his wives, but they were far away. The Angakok, with a swollen nose, decided to stay at that spot for camping. He explained that he had consulted his spirit guide, Tornak, who approved of the location. Later, the women crafted a cozy shelter using layers of skin and fur, creating a flap for a door. Menie and Monnie explored their new surroundings joyfully, discovering a beautiful cave to play in and collecting treasures to share with their mother.|['1.

In just two hours, the camp was settled as if they had been there for a week, and everyone felt hungry again. The men had fun telling stories, playing games, and singing songs with the Angakok. They ate when hungry, caught salmon, hunted deer and bears, and the women dried the food for winter. The children played all day. When they grew tired of one spot, they packed up and sailed along the coast until they found a new place. As August ended, they saw beautiful sunsets and prepared to return to their winter village. Traveling back, they listened to the sounds of the sea and made plans for the long winter nights ahead.|"['1.

Koko sat down as the boat smoothly moved through the water, approaching the Big Rock. Soon, the entire village of five igloos came into view, appearing as if it had peacefully slumbered in the sunlight during their absence. Upon reaching the shore, the men paddled their kayaks to land, and the big boats were carefully pulled onto the sand. The beach bustled with activity as the men tended to the walruses and seals, while the women set up tents, prepared meat for storage, and organized their belongings. Although the village seemed unchanged, Nip and Tup, once small dogs, had grown bigger. Koolee, noticing the twins' growth, remarked on their need for new clothes to prepare for winter. As the days grew colder and nights lengthened, a snowstorm hit, prompting Koolee and the twins to reinforce their igloo. The twins were urged to take on new responsibilities to ensure their survival during the harsh winter ahead.|['1.
