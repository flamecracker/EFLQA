Eden Place, a small street off Eden Square, was not the paradise its name suggested. The square, more triangular than square, was hardly a park, with stunted trees and neglected plants. The green benches were worn from use by unemployed men. Children squabbled and dug up the earth there, followed by those down on their luck. The corner house was slightly larger, with a noticeable bay window and a tiny flower bed bearing a sign, ‘No Smoking on these Premises.’ The occupied houses exuded cheer and hospitality, with bed linens hanging freely from windows. The fences between yards sagged from the weight of shared gossip. One resident, however, kept to herself, causing her neighbors to chat loudly across her house. Mrs. Grubb’s house on the corner had an intriguing room adorned with charts and objects promoting various causes like temperance and social reform.|"['1.

“Please!” she exclaimed mockingly. “Thank goodness, I still have my dignity not to pray!—Yes, I have to pray, I _have_ to... Oh, God! I don’t seek forgiveness for him or me; I only plead that, somehow unseen, we may be punished, and she spared!” This is how young Alisa Bennett took on motherly duties at ten, earning the nickname ‘Marm Lisa.’ She became more humane under Mr. Grubb’s guidance, but with his passing two years ago, she regressed to her former vacant look, slipping back into a past worse than her present. Mrs. Grubb found it odd that she, desiring freedom, was tied to three children who weren’t hers biologically—and such children. Pacific Simonson, the twins’ father, was a boxer, but even that didn’t explain Pacific’s violent tendencies. Mrs. Grubb remained moderately cheerful despite her troubles, viewing them as vague as everything else in her mind. She planned to find a way out eventually, but she was more focused on growth than escape. Nothing seemed to matter much. Her body might be in Eden Place, but her mind was always elsewhere.

Lisa quietly turned the knob of the outer door, slipping into the inner room, a place she called Paradise. The peaceful atmosphere eased her troubled mind. As she lay down, thoughts of Mistress Mary brought comfort. Opening the closet, she found Mistress Mary's dainty sewing-picture, damaged by Atlantic. Lisa envisioned Rhoda's firm guidance.

Fortune favored the mischievous twins from the start. Pacific found a candy stick and shared it with a lovely Chinese girl named Spring Blossom. The girl, dressed in blue-and-gold satin, accepted the gift happily and ran to tell her mother. The children climbed up to a balcony to watch a grand parade with pagodas, musicians, and a dragon. The twins were thrilled by the spectacle and the chaos of the celebration. As darkness fell, lanterns lit up the streets, and the twins explored opium dens and sampled Chinese treats. However, hunger and fatigue eventually caught up with them, and they found themselves lost. Unconcerned, they decided to howl for help until they received supper and a place to rest, showing their trust in the kindness of strangers.|['1.

A large group gathered as the twins' voices carried, reaching even poor Lisa who sat miles away, shivering on the curb. The twins' chanting captivated the audience briefly before it soured.

Another day, my beloved work fills me with happiness. I find joy in weaving the fabric of my daily happiness from the threads of my work. My friends do not understand this happiness, but I feel blessed, like Mary of old. I believe that God sends us into the world for various purposes. While marriage may be important, it is the love within it that truly matters. I may find my highest potential without marriage, but I know that deep love is essential for my growth. I feel destined to care for other people's children rather than having my own. My heart is devoted to my work, leaving little room for a husband. Men, for the most part, lack spiritual depth in their tenderness and loyalty. I wish we could create ideal lovers as portrayed in books. While I may not find a man who aligns with the virtues my work instills in me, I cherish children's love, woman's love, and man's friendship. These relationships fill my life with happiness, and I am content with the prospect of evolving into a nurturing figure for many.|"['1.

On a remarkable morning, a teacher found courage in a challenging lesson as she observed a student with hidden talents. Despite struggles, the student showed potential for growth and learning. The teacher compared the student's progress to lifting a stone to allow grass to grow, symbolizing the unlocking of hidden abilities. The teacher reflected on the slow but steady improvement of the students under her care, noting the energy they possessed. A young minister's visit brought a mix of emotions, with the teacher observing the budding affection between him and another. Despite challenges and discouragements, the teacher remained hopeful for the transformative power of children in shaping a better future.|"['1.

In the vast expanse of the land, amidst the myriad growing things, some nurtured and some neglected, there lies a child.

I was surprised to learn about female Mahatmas, as I had always assumed that an Adept needed years of silence before becoming one. There are different levels of Adepts, from the topmost Mahatmas to the Nirmanakayas, who help humanity without a physical body. As we go down the ranks, some Adepts and second-class Mahatmas live in their bodies, retaining the ability to project their souls anywhere instantly. Mrs. Grubb, despite her intellectual gymnastics, needs time to grow into a Chela. She consulted me about Soul Haven for the twins, a plan I find reasonable. If the matter isn't resolved soon, I'll find a way to change her mind by the new year. I've thought about funding for their education and care, and may need to make a public appeal. Just like Pastor Von Bodelschwingh's Baby Castle, where parents donated a penny for each healthy child, I hope for a similar outpouring of support for Lisa.|"['1.

Even though I am grown up now, there are a few intangible things I wish to find in my stocking on Christmas morning. I hope that all the missed joyful moments of past Christmases will come to me this time. I wish Santa Claus would come down the chimney to grant my simple wishes. I sometimes doubt if he only goes to those who shout the loudest for grand gifts. But when I see his jolly face on a picture-book cover, all my suspicions vanish. I may be twenty-eight, but my whims and wishes will never change. I feel like sending a letter up the chimney to Santa! The children in the sunny land where it's a green Christmas seem content with the soft sunshine. Further south, mothers long for snowy days and warm fires. But the kids in the garden, surrounded by fragrant blooms, are happy. The city streets smell of violets, and the air is filled with the joy of the season. In Mistress Mary's garden, the children work in secret to prepare gifts for each other and for her. The anticipation and excitement fill the air as they eagerly await the day when the Wonderful Tree will bloom with gifts for all.|"['1.

As the girls busily labeled Christmas gifts, a chorus of fire alarms suddenly pierced the air. Edith glimpsed red flames in the distant direction of Lone Mountain. Rhoda dashed out for news and returned breathless, reporting three separate fires raging in the city. Lisa had warned the occupants of a coat factory next door, but the fire was spreading fast. The scene was chaotic, with residents evacuating their belongings and makeshift firefighting efforts underway. Mary and Rhoda navigated through the crowd to find Lisa missing. The tumultuous scene unfolded before them, with police struggling to control the onlookers and the fire spreading rapidly.

Mary observed the fire brigade, noting it was not referred to as 'she.' She noticed no particular interest in her. As she maneuvered through the crowd, she overheard disjointed sentences that gradually formed a dreadful narrative. Lisa, deftly freeing herself from the policeman's grasp, sprinted up the unstable stairs. The crowd gasped as Pacific was rescued from the flames. Lisa emerged at a window holding a child, recognized by Rhoda and Mary. The policeman instructed Lisa to jump, while onlookers held a counterpane below. Lisa hesitated, paralyzed by fear. The wind cleared the smoke, revealing her figure. The crowd urged her to jump, fearing she would perish in the fire. Lisa, having saved Atlantic, now stood frozen, contemplating the perilous leap.|"[""1.
