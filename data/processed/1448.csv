Dete decided to leave with the people from Frankfurt who had offered her a good position.

"Dete responded, ""What do you mean? I have fulfilled my responsibility towards the child. What should I do with her now? Taking a five-year-old to Frankfurt is out of the question. Barbel, where are you headed? We're halfway up the Alm."" Dete bid farewell to her friend as Barbel approached a small, dark hut nearby. The dilapidated hut, halfway up the Alm from Dorfli, creaked and trembled in the mountain wind. Within the hut lived eleven-year-old Peter, who led goats to graze on the mountain. Peter's daily routine involved guiding the goats down to Dorfli and back.

"The child silently indicated a spot below on the mountainside and replied, ""Down there."" Dete followed her finger and saw something with a red spot on it, likely the woollen wrapper. ""You thoughtless child! Can't you use your head?"" scolded Dete. ""Peter, go fetch them quickly; it's a half-hour walk!"" Peter swiftly retrieved the clothes and was praised by Dete, who gave him a shiny coin. Peter joyfully accepted it and headed up the mountain with the items. Heidi and the goats happily followed. After a steep climb, they reached the top where Uncle's hut stood. Uncle, sitting outside, greeted them gruffly. Heidi confidently said, ""Good evening, Grandfather.""

Dete was feeling uneasy about her actions and became irritable. Uncle rose from his seat, giving her a stern look and commanding her to leave immediately and never return. Dete hurried down the mountain to Dorfli, feeling agitated. She faced questions from everyone about the child's whereabouts and faced reproach for leaving the child with Alm-Uncle. Dete justified her actions, thinking she could provide better for the child with more money. Meanwhile, Heidi explored her new surroundings, finding an empty shed and listening to the wind in the fir trees. She returned to her grandfather, who remained silent. Heidi followed him inside the hut, where she found a simple room with a bed, table, chair, and a cupboard holding their essentials.

"Heidi was thrilled and quickly explored the corners to find the best spot to sleep. Spotting a ladder near her grandfather's bed, she climbed up to the hayloft. There was a heap of fresh hay with a round window offering a view of the valley. ""I'm preparing the bed now,"" she called down, asking for a sheet. Her grandfather found a coarse piece of fabric to use as a sheet. Together, they made a comfortable bed with extra hay for a pillow. Heidi was pleased with their work.

"""Good-night, Little Swan, good-night, Little Bear!"" she called out as they entered the shed. She sat down to eat and drink, but the strong wind nearly blew her away. After finishing her supper, she went inside to her bed, sleeping soundly like a princess. Later, the grandfather also went to bed early, as he rose at sunrise. The wind grew fierce during the night, shaking the hut. The old man got up, concerned for the child. He stood by her bed, watching the moonlight fall on her. The next morning, Heidi woke to the sun shining through the window, feeling like she was in a golden world. Remembering her new life on the mountain, she quickly got ready and went outside to meet Peter and the goats. Her grandfather reminded her to wash up, and he prepared food for Peter.

Heidi excitedly asked her grandfather if the sun would laugh at her now. After scrubbing herself red to avoid the sun, she was reassured by her grandfather. She ran to the mountain, captivated by the clear sky and colorful flowers. Heidi picked flowers to decorate her room like the meadows. While Peter herded the goats, Heidi sat among fragrant prunella flowers, savoring the scent. Peter warned her not to pick all the flowers, leaving some for the next day.

Peter expressed his disapproval of Heidi's idea more strongly with each exclamation. He reminded her of Uncle's warning not to climb too high, as even the goats couldn't reach there. Peter whistled loudly, calling the goats down from the rocks to the green plateau. Heidi marveled at the goats playing together, each displaying unique behavior. While Peter set out a meal, Heidi joined the goats in their playful antics. Peter shared the food, and Heidi generously offered him her share. Peter was astonished by her kindness and enjoyed a hearty meal. Heidi asked for the goats' names, and Peter introduced each one. Heidi quickly learned to identify them by their characteristics.

Heidi comforted Snowflake, promising to keep her company daily. The young animal nuzzled Heidi, feeling reassured. As the goats roamed, Heidi observed their behaviors. She noticed that her grandfather's goats were the most refined, treating the others with disdain. The goats grazed on the rocks, each in their unique way. Suddenly, Peter jumped up and chased after Greenfinch, who was near a dangerous cliff. Heidi rushed to help as Greenfinch teetered on the edge. Heidi calmed Greenfinch with leaves, preventing a disaster. Peter, trying to discipline Greenfinch, was stopped by Heidi. She offered Peter cheese and bread in exchange for sparing the goats from punishment. As the day ended, Heidi marveled at the fiery sunset, mistaking the glowing rocks for flames.|"['1.

Heidi was filled with wonder as she gazed at the beautiful sight around her. The crimson snow and the roses on the rocks captivated her. But her joy turned to sorrow as the colors faded away. Sitting on the ground, she felt as if everything had come to an end. Curious, she asked Peter if they would see this beauty every day while bringing the goats up the mountain. As they descended, Heidi eagerly awaited Peter's response. Reaching the hut, she ran to her grandfather, sharing her excitement about the scenery.

Heidi listened to her grandfather's explanation about the bird's mocking cries and the sun's colorful farewell to the mountains with great interest. She shared her adventures on the mountain, including the fiery sunset and the goats' mischievous antics. As autumn arrived, the wind grew stronger, and Heidi's grandfather warned her to stay indoors on windy days to avoid accidents.

Approaching the house from the back, one entered an open space with walls on either side, one of which was half in ruins. Above, an old window arch overgrown with ivy led to the remains of a domed roof, once part of a chapel. A large hall, open to the square outside, followed. The hall, with walls and roof partially intact, was divided by a wooden partition for goats. Endless passages led to a room with intact walls and dark wainscoting. An immense stove adorned with pictures in blue tiles stood in the corner. Heidi's bed, a hay mattress, and sheets were placed near the stove. The grandfather's bedroom was adjacent, and a vast kitchen-like room awaited further repairs. Despite the initial disorientation, Heidi grew to love her new home, exploring every corner with joy.|"['1.

"After a few days of snow, the sun finally reappeared, casting its bright light over the white landscape. However, it set early behind the mountains, seeming less interested in the snowy scene compared to when everything was green and flowery. The moon then took over, illuminating the snowfield like a giant crystal through the night. The next morning, the mountain sparkled like a massive jewel. Peter, expecting the frozen ground, was surprised when he fell and slid down the mountain on the hard icy surface. Excited that Heidi could now visit, Peter rushed back home, had a quick meal, and headed out. As he slid down the mountain on his little sleigh, he decided to continue towards Mayenfeld. After realizing it was too late for school, Peter returned to Dorfli. Bursting into Heidi's home, he exclaimed, ""She's got it now!"" Excited to visit her grandmother, Heidi quickly got ready.

"The kids were almost home when Peter finally spoke up. Lost in thought, he seemed unaware of his surroundings. As they approached, he stopped suddenly and grumbled, ""I'd rather go to school than face Uncle's threats."" Heidi agreed, supporting his decision.

Heidi released the child and hurried to summon Peter as darkness fell. Outside, under the moonlight, Peter readied the sleigh. With Heidi at the back, they sped down the mountain. That night, Heidi thought of her grandmother and the hymns that comforted her. She wished to read to her daily but couldn't visit for weeks. Determined, Heidi devised a plan to bring the hymns to her grandmother. The next day, Peter arrived at school with his dinner. After classes, he visited Heidi. She excitedly shared her idea with him. When Peter hesitated, Heidi warned him of the consequences. She described schools in Frankfurt, where boys faced strict teachers and ridicule for not learning. To help Peter, Heidi used a book Clara had sent her to teach him. Together, they began the lesson, with Heidi guiding Peter patiently.|"['1.

Heidi reassured Clara, urging her to rest near the goat, Snowflake. Clara, content with her new companion, happily accepted the leaves Heidi placed in her lap.

She felt a newfound sense of independence and a desire to bring joy to others, just as she was doing for Snowflake. Meanwhile, Heidi discovered a breathtaking field of golden cistus flowers and blue bell-flowers. Overwhelmed by the beauty, she rushed back to Clara, inviting her to witness the enchanting sight. Clara, unable to walk, watched as Heidi confronted Peter, who had been watching them. Heidi's determination frightened Peter, who feared his misdeeds being exposed.

Peter lay still among the flowers, fast asleep. Heidi, on the other hand, was up and about, taking in the sweet scent of the flowers swaying in the warm wind. The hours passed by until a group of goats, led by Greenfinch, approached the children. The goats seemed like they were on a mission, searching for their missing companions. When Greenfinch spotted the three friends among the flowers, she let out a loud bleat, prompting the others to join in. The goats trotted towards the children. Peter, waking from a dream about the chair, felt a sense of dread. Heidi, true to her word, shared the food from the bag with Peter, who ate it all but felt a gnawing inside. They were late for dinner, and when Grandfather arrived, Heidi excitedly shared the good news with him. Grandfather was pleased and took Clara for a walk, with Heidi skipping alongside in joy. Later, in Dorfli, Peter found the remains of Clara's chair, scattered on the ground, showing how magnificent it once was.|"['1.

The baker near Peter shared his opinion on the destruction of a chair carried up the mountain by men, estimating its worth at twenty-five pounds. Concerned about potential inquiries, Peter feared being suspected due to his proximity to the incident. Filled with dread, he hurried home, imagining being seized and imprisoned. At night, Heidi reflected on God's wisdom in not always granting our prayers, as there might be better plans in store. She encouraged Clara to continue praying, trusting that God knows what is best. The children planned a surprise for grandmamma, focusing on Clara's progress in walking. Clara's joy grew each day as she improved, eagerly awaiting grandmamma's visit.|"['1.

Grandmamma wrote a letter to let the children know she was on her way. Peter delivered the letter early the next morning. Grandfather, the children, and the goats were outside.

Uncle went a little way aside and blew a loud whistle through his fingers, echoing among the rocks. Soon, Peter, recognizing the whistle, ran down. He was handed a paper to deliver to the post-office in Dorfli. Afterward, they all had dinner at the hut, updating grandmamma about Clara's progress. Meanwhile, Herr Sesemann, after finishing his business in Paris, traveled to see his daughter. He reached Dorfli after a long climb up the mountain, encountering Peter on the way. Startled, Peter fell while trying to escape, tearing the telegram. Herr Sesemann, mistaking Peter's fear for shyness, was more worried about being pursued by a Frankfurt policeman.

"""Well done! Who among you will the wind send rolling down like a badly-sewn sack of potatoes tomorrow?"" chuckled the baker, watching Peter tumble. Peter, feeling embarrassed, hurried back up the slope to tend to the goats. Despite his desire to hide in bed, Uncle's strict orders compelled him to return promptly. Groaning and limping, Peter trudged up the mountain, exhausted from the ordeal. Meanwhile, Herr Sesemann, on his way to his daughter, Clara, encountered Heidi and Clara.
