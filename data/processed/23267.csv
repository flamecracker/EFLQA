This book tells the story of Captain Cook's voyages to Tahiti and other Pacific islands. Tahiti had been found by Captain Wallis before Cook was sent there to make astronomical observations that couldn't be done in Europe. The island was lush, and the people didn't need to work much, making them lazy and sometimes thieves. Some islands had gruesome customs like wearing slain rivals' bodies. Cannibalism was also practiced, leading to diseases. Captain Cook, born into poverty, became a renowned navigator through hard work and perseverance. He was self-taught and learned basics from an old woman and a short village school stint. His voyages and discoveries made him famous worldwide. Born in 1728, Cook's early career involved coasting trade and eventually joining the navy in 1755, where he rose to prominence.|"[""1.

As the voyagers neared Cape Horn in South America, known for its fierce storms, they readied themselves for bad weather. The crew encountered natives from Tierra del Fuego as they landed near a bay. Initially cautious, the natives signaled peace by throwing away sticks. A friendly exchange followed, with gifts exchanged. Despite the visitors' lack of curiosity aboard the ship, they accepted food but rejected wine and spirits. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, naturalists on the voyage, led an expedition to explore the uncharted land near Cape Horn, hoping to discover new plants and insects. The group set out to climb a mountain, eager to uncover unique species in the unfamiliar territory.|['**1.

It took them much longer to cross the pathless forest than expected. By afternoon, they reached what they thought was a plain but turned out to be a swamp with stubborn bushes. Sinking in mud up to their ankles, they were exhausted. The weather worsened with cold wind and snow. Despite this, they continued until Mr Buchan had a fit, forcing a halt. A fire was lit, and some stayed with him while the rest pushed on. They reached the mountain top, finding botanical treasures. Unable to return to the ship, they camped on the mountain, then moved to the valley for shelter. Some felt a dangerous urge to sleep from the cold. Dr Solander warned against it but succumbed himself. They struggled to keep awake, with some needing to be carried to a fire nearby.|"['1.

Meanwhile, the other black man and a sailor were instructed to care for the ill black servant until help arrived. Dr. Solander, once warmed by the fire, sent two strong men back to retrieve the missing black man. Sadly, the men returned alone, unable to locate their companions. It was later discovered that the missing bottle of rum, likely carried by one of the absent men, had been used to revive the servant. In the darkness and heavy snowfall, hope dwindled for their safe return. Eventually, a shout was heard, and one of the seamen was found barely standing. Despite efforts to rescue the others, the party was too weak. The night passed in anguish and distress, with two dead, one gravely ill, and the rest on the brink of collapse. Miraculously, a gentle breeze cleared the sky, allowing them to journey back to safety, surviving on a meager vulture meal. This land, similar to our southern hemisphere, is harsh and inhabited by a desolate native population.|['1.

The savage people living on the islands near Tierra del Fuego had a unique appearance with rust-colored skin and long black hair. The men were tall but clumsy, while the women were smaller and wore animal skins. Despite their poverty, they enjoyed adorning themselves with face paint and beads made of shells and bones. These people had no government or religion and spoke in a harsh language. Captain Cook and his crew later discovered coral islands in the Pacific Ocean, where they encountered natives who were brown-skinned and carried long spears. The islands had diverse landscapes with rocky areas, vegetation, and palm trees. The crew marveled at the paradise-like scenery after months at sea. Another island shaped like a bow was also found, inhabited by natives who were hesitant to approach the ship.|['1.

Dear reader, did you know that the beautiful coral islands in the Pacific Ocean are not made of regular rocks like most other islands? They are actually created by millions of tiny insects living in the sea. These insects have the amazing ability to secrete a lime-like substance, which they use to build their homes on the ocean floor. The coral insect is a social creature and enjoys working alongside its friends to create these stunning islands. Through their unity and hard work, these insects achieve remarkable feats, constructing vast structures that connect continents and form fertile islands. Despite their small size, these coral insects play a crucial role in shaping the landscapes of the Pacific Ocean. Working tirelessly, they build solid walls that rise above the sea, eventually forming the beautiful islands we see today.|['1.

The birth of an island begins with the demise of the coral insects, forming a ring emerging from the sea. Other creatures join in, as waves break the coral cells into sand, and ocean currents bring seaweed and debris. Winds carry land plant seeds, while seabirds contribute to the island's growth. Over time, a lush vegetation covers the island, attracting South Sea islanders. The coral reefs surrounding these islands pose dangers to ships, causing unexpected wrecks. Despite the risks, the corallines create natural harbors with splendid calm waters shielded by the reefs. These openings in the reefs serve as safe passages into the harbors, often found opposite valleys where freshwater prevents coral growth. Otaheite, now known as Tahiti, captivated Captain Cook with its beauty when he arrived in 1769. Tahiti's discovery marked a significant event, with the natives in awe of the first ship to visit their shores.|['1.

There was a lot of chatter among the natives before they felt comfortable. They were given trinkets and gradually their fears eased under Captain Wallis' kindness. However, a ship's goat attacked one of the natives, causing a commotion. The goat's actions led to the natives fleeing into the sea. Despite initial fears, they returned to the ship, where they were treated kindly and given gifts. The visit turned sour when a native snatched a hat and jumped into the sea. As tensions rose, the ship fired warning shots, but the natives attacked the boats. A musket shot was fired in defense, causing the natives to retreat. Peace was attempted again, but a subsequent attack led to a battle with canoes filled with stones. The conflict escalated, resulting in a full-fledged battle with the ship.|"[""1.

The crew of the ship Dolphin hurried to their battle stations. The sailors on deck quickly fired their muskets at the approaching attackers, and even the quarter-deck guns joined in. The fierce resistance initially halted the assault, but the natives regrouped and continued their attack with more determination. The ship's heavy cannons were then unleashed, causing chaos and forcing the attackers to retreat. As the situation escalated, the ship's captain decided to halt the firing to minimize harm. However, the natives regrouped for another assault, showing their resilience. Despite a brief peace offering, the natives prepared for another attack, prompting the crew to defend the ship once more.

When Captain Wallis visited Tahiti, the natives showed a surprising preference for nails and new halfpence over silver and gold coins. The friendship between Wallis and the natives grew strong during his stay, with the queen deeply saddened when he left. Shortly after, Captain Cook arrived on the island, greeted by timid but friendly natives offering symbols of peace. The visitors were welcomed with kindness and respect, with the natives sharing their fruits and hospitality. Cook and his companions were dressed in native clothes as a gesture of friendship. The island was abundant with trees bearing cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit, providing the locals with nourishing food. Despite their natural indolence, the South-Sea islanders thrived when introduced to the Christian religion. Cook's encounter with the natives included a dinner at Tootahah's house, where gifts were exchanged, and an incident of pickpocketing was swiftly resolved.|"['1.

Soon after this, Cook chose a spot on the shore close to the ship to set up his tent and prepare for the astronomical observations that had brought him to the South Seas. However, they quickly discovered that the islanders had a habit of stealing. Cook described them as the worst thieves in the world, yet they felt guilty when falsely accused. Once, when many islanders visited the ship, the chiefs and their followers stole items. When Mr. Banks accused Tubourai Tamaide of stealing, it turned out to be a misunderstanding. Another native had the missing items. Tubourai was upset until Mr. Banks apologized and gave him gifts. In another incident, a chief accused the ship's butcher of threatening his wife. Cook punished the butcher despite the natives' pleas for forgiveness. The islanders also tattoo themselves, a painful and lengthy process practiced from childhood to adulthood.|"['1.

The teacher, with his subject lying down, picks up his tool. It is a small stick with sharp bird or fish bones attached. After drawing the intended tattoo pattern with charcoal, he dips the bone points in a jet-black dye from the candle-nut kernel. He applies it to the skin and taps it with a stick, puncturing the skin and injecting the dye. The teacher works calmly and artistically, continuing until the patient can't bear the pain. The patterns vary among islanders, featuring lines, palm trees, and animals on the face and body. Tahitian tattooing is simpler and more elegant, with nature-inspired designs like coconut trees. The ankle and instep tattoos resemble Eastern sandals, and leg tattoos create the illusion of ornamental pants. The chest is heavily tattooed with various figures, from trees to weapons. Women also tattoo but with more tasteful designs. Tahiti, once savage, is now civilized, with Christianity replacing their old customs and superstitions.|['1.

In Tahiti, the islanders had admirable qualities despite their humble circumstances. Captain Cook noted their physical attributes, mentioning the men's stature, strength, and the women's smooth olive complexion. The islanders had sparkling eyes, good teeth, and black, coarse hair. Their custom of hair styling was unique, with women wearing short hair and men wearing long, anointed with coconut oil. They adorned themselves with ornaments like earrings made of stones and shells. The islanders lived in simple houses with thatched roofs and no walls, open to the elements. Their diet mainly consisted of vegetables, with occasional hogs and dogs for meat, which were shared among the community. The island's lush groves provided a cool escape from the tropical heat, making it a delightful place for a leisurely stroll.|"['1.

In the South-Sea islands, the natives have a unique way of cooking their food. For instance, when preparing a dog for a meal, they would first kill it by holding its mouth and nose shut for about fifteen minutes. Then, they would make a fire in a hole in the ground and heat small stones. The dog would be singed over the fire and cleaned with a shell. The entrails were washed and placed in coconut shells. The dog was then cut up and cooked in the ground with hot stones and leaves for about four hours. The natives also enjoy a variety of raw fish, lobsters, crabs, and breadfruit. The breadfruit tree provides a staple food source, with its large round fruit that is baked and tastes similar to bread. The breadfruit tree is a beautiful plant with dark green leaves and a rough trunk that can grow up to twenty feet tall.|['1.

In the South Seas, the bread-fruit tree is a valuable resource for the islanders, providing fruit, gum, bark for cloth, and wood for construction. The tree yields multiple crops a year, with nearly fifty varieties available. The cocoa-nut tree is equally important, thriving in various soils and climates. Its stem grows tall and straight, topped with a tuft of green leaves. The tree bears fruit year-round, with nuts at different stages of ripeness on the same tree. The nuts are encased in a tough shell and contain sweet milk. Islanders ingeniously climb the tall trees to gather the nuts using a method involving tying bark to their feet for grip. The trees also provide material for clothing, shelter, and tools, showcasing their versatility and the thoughtful design of nature.|['1.

Cannibalism is not a made-up story; it is a real practice among some tribes. Warriors in the South-Sea islands prepare for battle with human sacrifices to their god of war. They arm themselves with slings, pikes, and clubs made of hard wood, beautifully carved at times. Before the fight, champions challenge each other, leading to intense combat. The battle begins with a furious clash, lacking any defensive strategy. The warriors rely on the belief that their weapons are guided by the gods. There are no shields used, and the combat is brutal, with deadly blows and thrusts. Orators of battle encourage the troops with passionate speeches, urging them to fight valiantly. The fight continues with shouts, yells, and the clash of weapons until one side emerges victorious.|"['1.

In battles of ancient times, the capture of a wounded enemy was seen as a sacrifice. The wounded warrior, still alive, was adorned with sacred cinet and laid on spears while the priest watched. If a tear fell, it was believed he wept for his land; if he clenched his fist, his party would resist fiercely. When a chief fell, his comrades regrouped and launched a furious counterattack. Skilled slingers then pelted stones at close range, causing havoc. As the armies clashed, the fight grew fierce until one side retreated. In sea battles, islanders used large, ingeniously crafted war-canoes capable of carrying many warriors. These canoes were long, narrow, and elaborately carved, propelled by men with paddles. The battles were brutal, with pursuit and carnage until nightfall or retreat to strongholds.|['1.

"In ancient times, fierce battles were fought on the waters of the Pacific islands. One memorable clash occurred between the people of Huahine and Raiatea, resulting in a staggering loss of life. Ninety war-canoes, each over a hundred feet long, clashed near Hooroto, leading to a brutal and unyielding fight. The casualties were so high that the dead were stacked as tall as young coconut trees the next day. These conflicts birthed what we now call ""wild men"" who roamed the island mountains. These individuals, driven mad by war, lived in solitude for years. Their appearance was striking, with long, disheveled hair of varying colors and a wild, agitated demeanor. Captured by surprise, they exhibited extreme terror and resistance, haunted by the horrors of war. The captors' kindness failed to calm their fears, and they longed for escape. The cruelties inflicted on prisoners were unspeakably gruesome, with some bodies left to be consumed by animals. The victors even fashioned trophies from the bones of the fallen."|['1.

In ancient times, some tribes engaged in gruesome practices with the deceased. For instance, warriors would flatten the bodies of their enemies, then wear them like macabre clothing into battle. Additionally, bodies of celebrated figures were hung from trees, their limbs broken and then manipulated like puppets for entertainment. Other atrocities were committed on the dead, too disturbing to detail fully. A particular account from the Feejee Islands describes a war expedition involving two thousand men, including an English sailor named Jackson. The group faced challenges with provisions, resorting to eating dogs, cats, and even raw grubs. The journey led them to the town of Mouta, where they presented gifts to the king and partook in rituals to honor the god of war. The priest's prophetic speech emphasized obedience to the cannibalistic deity for the mission's success. The expedition continued towards Male, a mountainous region notorious for its hostile inhabitants who pillaged neighboring villages.|"['1.

"Upon arrival, the war-party encountered the natives who were taunting and challenging them. The natives expressed their impatience, stating they had long awaited the visit and were now ready to engage. They warned the war-party that they were armed with stones, gunpowder, and musket-balls. In response, the war-party exchanged similar insults. Eventually, three hill dwellers dared the war-party to come up the path. The war-party, not intending to attack at that moment, declined but fired muskets at the challengers, killing them instantly. The bodies were displayed on a pole in a canoe as the war-party departed, singing ""Goodbye."" The bodies were painted and presented in front of the king's house. An old man theatrically scolded the bodies before they were taken to a place for butchering and consumption.

The great navigator's visit to Tahiti marked the beginning of a romantic incident in maritime history - the mutiny on the H.M.S. _Bounty_ and the subsequent settlement of Pitcairn Island. Tahiti, now under French governance, is known for its produce like breadfruit, cocoa-nuts, and a variety of fruits and vegetables. The _Endeavour_ sailed from Tahiti to New Zealand, a large island in the South Seas. New Zealand today boasts British settlements, cities, cultivated lands, gold mines, churches, and schools. Cook and his crew anchored near white cliffs and encountered armed natives. A tense standoff ensued, with the sailors firing warning shots to deter the aggressive locals. Despite the initial hostility, Cook attempted friendly interactions the following day with the help of an interpreter, Tupia, to establish peaceful relations with the native population.|"[""1.

The marines were landed and positioned as Captain Cook approached the natives for provisions and water in exchange for iron. Despite attempts to trade peacefully, the natives refused to lay down their arms. When one brave native swam across the river without weapons, others followed. However, tensions rose when the natives tried to seize the sailors' arms. After warnings were ignored, a scuffle broke out, and shots were fired in self-defense. Unfortunately, four natives were killed, and the remaining three, discovered to be young boys, were captured. Captain Cook expressed deep regret over the incident, highlighting the challenge of controlling the outcome once a command to fire had been given.|"['1.

After this, the explorers had strong evidence that the people of New Zealand practiced cannibalism. During a visit ashore, Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Tupia, and others found a dog's body in an oven, surrounded by provision baskets. Among the baskets, they discovered two bones that did not seem to be from a dog upon closer inspection. These bones were identified as human bones, with marks of teeth gnawing on them. When questioned, the natives confirmed that they were indeed human bones and that the flesh had been consumed. To further prove their point, a native pretended to eat his own forearm and gnawed on one of the bones.

Our space limits us from delving deeply into Captain Cook's numerous voyages across the vast expanse of the South Seas. This book merely skims the surface of the wide array of subjects he encountered. Those seeking more detailed accounts can refer to the book titled _The Voyages of Captain Cook round the World_, which features his captivating journals. Fast-forwarding to the final voyage of this renowned navigator, we leap to the poignant conclusion of his life in the subsequent chapter. In 1776, Captain Cook embarked on his ultimate journey aboard the _Resolution_, accompanied by the _Discovery_ under Captain Clerke, a proficient officer. The expedition was well-equipped, carrying essential supplies and livestock intended to enhance the lives of South-Sea islanders. Despite his limited education, Captain Cook's competence in astronomy and navigation shone throughout the voyage. The narrative swiftly moves to the tragic end of his adventures on the island of Owhyhee, where he met his heroic demise in January 1779.|"[""1.

Soon after, the _Resolution_ was damaged in a storm and had to return to Karakakooa Bay for repairs. The reception this time was different, with no shouting or bustling. They were informed that King Terreeoboo was absent and had placed a taboo on the bay. This seemed suspicious. Despite this, they began repairing the ship. On February 13th, natives armed with stones disrupted the watering-party. Captain Cook intervened, ordering sentinels to be ready to fire if needed. A scuffle ensued when an officer seized a canoe belonging to a chief named Pareea, resulting in Pareea being injured. The sailors were forced to retreat into the sea.
