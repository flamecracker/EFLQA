The Bastables have two uncles, but neither are their blood relatives. One is a great-uncle, and the other is Albert's uncle. Albert's uncle used to live next door to the Bastables in the Lewisham Road. They called him Albert's uncle because he was related to Albert, their neighbor. The Bastables spent their summer holidays at the Moat House with their father and Albert's uncle. During their stay, they discovered Albert's uncle's lost love, Miss Ashleigh, who they were allowed to call Aunt Margaret even before the wedding. The upcoming wedding caused a lot of excitement and preparations, with boxes of clothes and gifts arriving from London. The Bastables enjoyed their time at the Moat House, playing games, having a Christmas tree for the village children, and making toffee in the kitchen. Despite the wedding fuss, they imagined adventurous lives in Rome, singing ballads in the streets and earning their living.|"[""Question 1: Who is Albert's uncle in the text?\nA) A great-uncle\nB) A blood relative\nC) Their neighbor\nD) Miss Ashleigh's brother\nE) Their father's brother"", ""Question 2: Where did the Bastables spend their summer holidays in the text?\nA) Lewisham Road\nB) Moat House\nC) Rome\nD) London\nE) Miss Ashleigh's house"", ""Question 3: What did the Bastables discover about Albert's uncle during their stay at the Moat House?\nA) His lost treasure\nB) His lost love, Miss Ashleigh\nC) His secret recipe\nD) His hidden talents\nE) His long-lost friend"", 'Question 4: How did the Bastables refer to Miss Ashleigh before the wedding?\nA) Aunt Margaret\nB) Mrs. Albert\nC) Lady Ashleigh\nD) Miss Margaret\nE) The Bride', 'Question 5: What were the Bastables imagining about their lives during the wedding preparations?\nA) Becoming famous actors\nB) Starting a new business\nC) Traveling to Paris\nD) Living adventurous lives in Rome\nE) Becoming professional chefs', 'Question 6: What did the Bastables enjoy doing during their time at the Moat House?\nA) Gardening\nB) Reading books\nC) Playing games\nD) Painting portraits\nE) Learning to dance']"|['C) Their neighbor', 'B) Moat House', 'B) His lost love, Miss Ashleigh', 'A) Aunt Margaret', 'D) Living adventurous lives in Rome', 'C) Playing games']
The day after, H.O. asked Dora for a private chat. They sneaked into the old creaky secret staircase. Dora sewed something white, a surprise wedding gift. Dicky suspected it was a surprise. Meanwhile, the rest of us skated on the moat, frozen hard. Dora disliked skating. Christmas flew by, leading to the wedding day. The girls were bridesmaids, dressed in white silk and silver-buckled shoes. H.O. fetched a parcel, possibly Dora's secret present. At the wedding, the house was festively decorated. The bride seemed sweet but not entirely thrilled. After the ceremony, the newlyweds left in a carriage. We toasted the bride with champagne. The bride, feeling cold and hungry, was offered hot soup. The day ended with thoughts on the cost of marriage and the journey ahead.|['1.

Just before the bride went to change, H.O. quietly retrieved a brown-paper package from under the sideboard and slipped away. We thought he might have shown us what was inside, but it was his secret. As the bride left in a cozy fur cloak, Albert's uncle lightened up, cracking a not-so-great joke to lift spirits. Oswald and Dicky went to find H.O., but he was nowhere to be found. Even in the kitchen, where the servants were having dinner, there was no sign of him. They searched high and low, but H.O. was still missing. Eventually, a parcel arrived for H.O., revealing a clown's costume he had secretly asked Dora to make. It turned out he had wanted to surprise Aunt Margaret and Albert's uncle.

"We were all understanding and patient, and finally, he shared what had occurred. H.O. didn't narrate like Oswald, but the author crafted the story from his fragmented words. This process is called editing. ""It was Noël's fault,"" H.O. explained, recalling the day they made toffee. He felt Dicky should have stopped him but didn't. H.O. believed it was equally Dicky's and Noël's fault. H.O. thought of a prank, dressing as a clown and hiding in a basket in a railway van.

"When the basket was dumped onto the platform, I was relieved to finally sit still. However, the label was off, and someone kicked the basket, making me squeak like a rabbit.

"When Father planned to talk to H.O. that night, it didn't happen because H.O. was genuinely unwell in bed. The doctor diagnosed him with a fever caused by a mix of chill and excitement, but I believe it was probably the lunch he had, the shaking, the bread and cheese, and the canned beer that made him sick. He was bedridden for a week. After he recovered, not much was said. My fair Father decided H.O. had been punished enough for missing out on the pantomime and ""Shock-Headed Peter"" at the Garrick Theatre. We all learned from this experience. None of us, especially H.O., would consider being a stowaway again. It was nearly a year after Mother's passing, and Christmas felt different without her.

Oswald hesitated about asking strangers for money, but the girls, Alice and Dora, did it anyway. They bought ingredients for a pudding, including holly for decoration. Matilda, the maid, pretended to clean to keep them out of the kitchen. The children prepared the pudding in the nursery, washing their hands and the ingredients. Chopping suet and bread was harder than expected. They mixed the ingredients, including currants washed with soap, and put it in a basin to cook.

Oswald disliked his cousin Archibald, who was boastful and untruthful. Archibald was rude to the servants and played mean tricks. He even pulled the girls' hair and pinched them. Oswald couldn't punch him due to hospitality rules, but Alice threatened to tell their father. Archibald's behavior made Oswald suspicious of him. Despite playing games together, like Snap and Beggar my Neighbour, Archibald would cheat. Oswald suspected Archibald of causing a leak in the pipes, but he couldn't be sure. The children decided to send Archibald a mysterious letter after he returned to school. They climbed into the loft through a trap-door and used a rope ladder to get up there. The loft had two cisterns and a small window, making it a secret hideout for the children.|"['1.

We had a fun game in whispers, with Noël as the bandit bard by the window. The cisterns were our hiding spots. Suddenly, Archibald called out, looking for us. Jane thought we had left. Archibald searched the house while Father and uncle were away. Noël sneezed, giving away our hiding spot. Archibald found us, and we had to stop our game. The next day, a leak was discovered. The plumber was called on Monday. Our cousin found a poem Noël wrote about him and gave him a pen. Noël and our cousin became friends, causing a disturbance in the house. Noël got upset, and water started leaking through the ceiling. Noël asked to send our cousin away.

Dicky was furious and adamant, echoing Oswald's stance. He refused to engage with those he considered unworthy, even in front of adults. Oswald, in his passionate plea, managed to bring a plumber home. Together with Dicky, they confessed to their father about damaging a pipe in the loft. However, they withheld further details to maintain honor. The punishment was harsh; they were forbidden from attending Mrs. Leslie's party. Archibald, cunningly distancing himself, was allowed to go. Noël, feeling guilty, tried to console his siblings but was too upset to do so.

Oswald entered the common-room where everyone was occupied. Noël and H.O. played Halma, Dora wrapped boxes with silver paper for treats, and Dicky crafted a model of a new screw.

We strolled through the Park and past the Naval College, bypassing attractions like a life-sized ship for Naval Collegians. Oswald coveted the ship to learn about ropes and spars. Skipping the Painted Hall, our hearts were with Pincher, our missing dog. The Hospital was next, where we inquired about Pincher. No luck there. As we left the grounds, we encountered a sailor who mentioned seeing Pincher with a Chinaman crossing the river. Though the sailor's tales of Chinamen eating dogs didn't scare us, we knew they consumed unconventional foods. Tired, we sought a boat at the Trafalgar Hotel's boathouse, where we were met by a boatman after showing our wealth in coins.|"['1.

The boy appeared less unfriendly and helped the girls onto the boat, which was on a wobbly raft with holes showing the water below. The rough water resembled the sea, not a river. The boy rowed, not allowing us, even though I can row well. The boat rocked like a ship. Halfway across, Noël tugged Alice's sleeve. The boy chuckled, but we acted like we didn't notice. We saw wharves, engines, rusty cranes, and a ship being dismantled. The sight of the ship being taken apart made me feel sorry for it. As we crossed, the waves grew larger, and some of us fell silent. Noël felt unwell, so he and H.O. stayed behind while the rest of us went on a Chinese hunt.|"['1.

We informed the kind lady about our situation. She was friendly, though quite stout, and advised us against wandering alone. Despite assuring her of our safety, Oswald was relieved that Alice hadn't changed into smarter clothes before leaving. The woman directed us to Rose Gardens through a series of turns and alleys, mentioning the presence of Chinamen in the area. Grateful for the guidance, Alice thanked the woman and received a kiss. As we proceeded down Nightingale Street towards the alley, we encountered a group of boys harassing an elderly Chinaman. Reacting swiftly, Alice bravely intervened, slapping one of the boys.

The glasses were tricky to come by for our group. We managed to gather three pairs from the uncle's collection and one from the housekeeper's grandfather. However, we needed a total of nine pairs. Albert-next-door wanted to join us for an adventure and offered to write a paper on the Constitutions of Clarendon as his way in. To our surprise, he succeeded in writing the paper.

Clarendon, also known as Clarence, had a single constitution that led to his demise when he was killed by a butt of Malmsey. If he had a stronger constitution, he might have lived longer. This serves as a cautionary tale for all. As Oswald began reading his paper, he improvised details about Sir Thomas Blank and the ancient garden. The sundial likely witnessed historical events like Charles the First's beheading and the Great Plague. Suddenly, a stern lady in a blue dress with wooden shoes interrupted, claiming the garden was private. Despite her initial anger, she invited the children to lunch after Oswald explained their innocence. Mrs. Red House, the lady, even joined in the fun, showing a kinder side. The children shared their papers in different summer-houses, each with its unique charm, except for Noël's and H.O.'s, which were read in the stable.|"[""1.

After a delightful lunch at the Morden House Antiquarian Society and Field Club's Field Day, a thrilling adventure unfolded. The details of this exciting escapade will be revealed later. Albert's uncle shared some French phrases from a newspaper, adding an air of authenticity to the experience. The children played antiquarians wearing spectacles vaselined to prevent rust, which left marks on their faces. Mrs. Red House kindly helped clean up the mess. The house, though simple, was charming with colorful furniture and tableware. The lunch was a feast of tongue, nuts, fruits, and ginger-wine in fairy goblets. Everyone toasted to each other's health, and Noël even offered to write a poem for Mrs. Red House. The Red House's hospitality was exceptional, allowing the children to explore freely. The house was filled with intriguing furniture and hidden nooks, making it a mysterious and enchanting place to explore.|"['1.

We discovered a hidden passage leading from the house to the cellar with the help of a general servant. The cellar was mysterious and cobwebby, with stone stairs that twisted unlike any we had seen before. It had various sections like a beer cellar, wine cellar, and a keeping cellar. While exploring, Dicky jokingly mentioned it was a perfect place for crimes. As we ventured further, Oswald, our brave leader, almost fell into a dark pit but was saved by catching himself on the edge. Despite the mishap, Oswald showed fairness and encouraged the others to continue exploring.

In a dark cellar, two brave youths discovered mysterious objects before their match went out. Denny, unfamiliar with Woolwich, urged for a candle to avoid retracing steps. Oswald shared tales of confined brothers, sparking eerie thoughts of toads or serpents. As the door finally opened, faces and lights flooded in. Mr. Red House identified items like a press and a settle. They all worked hard to move the finds to the kitchen, earning praise from Mrs. Red House. Despite the dirt, they were invited for tea, prompting a humorous exchange about cleanliness.|"['1.

"We all washed up and then had tea at the gentleman's charming cottage. He used to be a war reporter and had a wealth of knowledge and books full of pictures. After thanking Mrs. R.H. and everyone, she kissed the girls and boys. She then looked at Oswald and asked if he was too old. Oswald found it silly, but Noël's response seemed clever to everyone. Oswald felt awkward but ended up kissing Mrs. R.H.'s hand like a queen. Denny and Dicky followed suit. Later, the gentleman not Mr. Red House, accompanied us home in a cab with a white horse from Blackheath Station, concluding one of our most adventurous outings. The day may have ended, but its impact lingered. It's common for harmless activities, even approved by adults, to lead to unexpected and less desirable outcomes. Our exploration of underground places, even drains, inspired us to read Hugo's ""Les Misérables"" the next day. The thrilling tale of a convict and robber's escape through a drain filled with rats captured our imagination. Oswald pondered how different it was from typical book adventures. Despite the cold, he and H.O. ventured into the cellar, intrigued by its mysteries. Their exploration led to a door left ajar, hinting at more adventures to come. Excited, we hurried through dinner, donned our outerwear, and headed into the garden, descending the green, aged steps to the intriguing open door."|"['1.

"""They will not rashly leap into the light,"" said the discerning Oswald. He went to fetch a new dark-lantern he had not used before. Someone had taken Oswald's secret matches, and the lantern wouldn't light. Oswald thought the others could pass the time wondering if something would jump out on them. When he returned, no one was there. Alice explained they thought he had been delayed. Oswald played pretend golf with Alice while Noël and H.O. sat by the fire. Noël and H.O. found shelves with mysterious items in a vaulted place. They poured water on what they believed was a dynamite arrangement. Wet but feeling heroic, they changed clothes.

H.O. and Noël understood it completely; Oswald believes this was one of the rare times when Father wasn't as fair as he intended. Uncle wasn't fair either, but we must forgive him since he's older. We sent Mrs. Red House a Christmas card each. Noël sent a homemade one with his poetry. She invited us over in May. We went, realizing it wasn't her fault they cut the wires. They showed us a cradle in the cellar, once thought to be a rabbit hutch. Mr. Red House had fixed it, and they had a baby in it now. The morning was beautiful, the sky clear. We enjoyed the garden, with green plants sparkling in the sun. Oswald finally called a meeting with his siblings in the summer-house, as the birds sang in the warmth.|"['1.

"""Yes,"" said H.O., yawning, without raising his hand, which is impolite, and we reminded him of that. ""But I can think of things without being other things. Look how I thought about being a clown and going to Rome.""

""Yes, you think of things you'd much better not have thought of. Now my idea is let's each say what sort of society we shall make ourselves into--like we did when we were Treasure Seekers--about the different ways to look for it, I mean. Let's hold our tongues (no, not with your dirty fingers, H.O., old chap; hold it with your teeth if you must hold it with something)--let's hold our tongues for a bit, and then all say what we've thought of--in ages,"" the thoughtful boy added hastily, so that every one should not speak at once when we had done holding our tongues.

So we were all silent, and the birds sang industriously among the leafless trees of our large sunny garden in beautiful Blackheath. (The author is sorry to see he is getting poetical. It shall not happen again, and it was an extra fine day, really, and the birds did sing, a fair treat.)

We had an exciting day at the Hippodrome, but we felt guilty for enjoying it so much without Dicky. When we got home, we tried not to talk about it, especially the elephants, to spare his feelings. However, the memory was hard to contain. Dicky overheard a conversation between two porters about a mix-up with a turkey delivery meant for James Johnson at 8 Granville Park. This sparked an idea in Dicky's mind. He decided to prank James Johnson by sending him a hamper filled with fake parcels, including bottles filled with colored liquids, instead of the expected items. The group eagerly joined in on the plan, filling the hamper with amusing substitutes. This mischievous act brought laughter and excitement as they prepared the prank together.|"['1.

"We carefully crafted parcels to appear as if they were filled with the delectable items listed. Crafting a turkey shape was challenging, but we managed using coals, crushed newspapers, and firewood. The chains were made from rolled dusters, disguised with paper to resemble sausages. The plum-pudding and mince-pies were newspaper creations, as were the almonds and raisins. A fig-box held cinders and ashes to mimic figs. A French-plum bottle was filled with ink-soaked newspaper. The cake was concealed in a muff-box at the hamper's bottom. We anticipated the porter's surprise upon discovering our prank. While Dicky gloated, Noël expressed remorse, understanding the porter's potential anger. Despite the disagreement, Alice and Oswald intervened, urging reconciliation.

After completing our letters, we addressed, stamped, and posted them using various people in different locations. The under-gardeners in Greenwich and Lewisham, servants from places like Plaistow and Grove Park, the piano-tuner in Highgate, and the electric-bell man in Lambeth all played a role in mailing our letters. Although we used fancy names like Daisy Dolman and Everard St. Maur, and elaborate addresses, we eagerly awaited a reply to the one letter signed with Oswald's real name. Despite our efforts, no response arrived after a week. Feeling disheartened, we decided to take drastic action. Oswald and Dicky purchased a grey beard and mustache to disguise Oswald as a mature individual. Meanwhile, the girls gathered items to transform Alice's appearance into that of a discerning adult. The following day, we prepared to embark on the next phase of our adventure, fully committed to our new personas.|"['1.

Oswald left the room and discreetly put on his dark disguise. When he returned with a beard and his father's hat, expecting admiration, the others burst into laughter. Realizing he looked like a dwarf, Oswald hesitated. Eventually, persuaded by the noble cause, he agreed to the scheme. Reluctantly, he dressed as a girl, struggling with the tight and loose clothing. At the train station, the attention made Oswald uncomfortable. In a cab, his behavior as a high-born lady slipped, causing a scene. Despite the mishaps, Oswald maintained politeness.

Alice, appearing disheveled with her hair leaning to one side, agreed that they had come to commend the Doge's chapter. However, she blurted it out abruptly, perhaps forgetting herself. Oswald, in a state of disarray, couldn't speak. The hat elastic was slowly sliding up the back of his head, and he feared it would catapult off if it passed the bump on his head. The Editor acknowledged the success of the chapter, receiving sixteen glowing letters about it. He then discreetly gestured for Oswald to cover his boots with his petticoats. Oswald avoided looking at Alice, realizing only the piano-tuner and electric bell man had been faithful. Others hastily posted their letters, displaying selfishness. Oswald regretted the situation as the elastic in his hat crept up. The Editor subtly questioned Alice about spiritualists in Blackheath, hinting at the chapter's premature praise. Alice eloquently responded once the Editor asked her to remove her hat, revealing her true appearance. Oswald realized the Editor was slyly toying with them.|"[""1.

The Editor asked Oswald if he was done with Miss Daisy Dolman's attire, and upon Oswald's confirmation, the Editor assisted him in removing the feminine clothing and packing them up. Oswald cherished the memory of shedding the petticoats and enjoying the freedom of his own legs once more. In a letter to the children, the author urged them not to force art or fame but to use their natural voices. Alice remarked that if they had succeeded in their plan, they would have given the Editor fame as a wedding present. Eustace Sandal, a well-meaning but dull man, organizes concerts to uplift others. He invited Dora to help sell tickets for a concert aimed at elevating people's cultural standards. Dora, excited by the opportunity, sold tickets enthusiastically.

The tram ride was quite fun, but once we walked in Camberwell, it felt like scenes from old tales. The region was grim, with visions of dusty attics and dark cellars where children struggled. On a damp night, we found five bob on the ground, but Miss Blake said we were late. At the concert, Alice kept the money. Later, we all fell ill with measles from Camberwell. We were confined to bed, missing out on adventures. Mr. Sandal found the money's owner, a doctor's fee. The illness led us to the seaside. The journey was delightful, with a view of the sea, a sight we hadn't seen since Mother's passing. It made us all reflective.|"['1.

After a pleasant ride in a wagon, we arrived at Miss Sandal's charming white house near the village. The house had a unique feature of an old windmill where fishermen stored their nets. Miss Sandal welcomed us warmly, showing us around the simple, yet neat rooms. The interior was all white with minimal furniture and no decorations. The dining room had a clock and a few brownish pictures, one depicting a blind girl titled 'Hope.' Despite the plain surroundings, we were served plenty of wholesome, nutritious food. As we explored the area, we learned about seagulls cracking shells to eat clams. Miss Sandal, usually composed, showed a rare moment of agitation when a telegram arrived, disrupting her usual calm demeanor. Overall, our time at the White House was peaceful, with encounters with friendly coastguards and village folk adding to our coastal experience.|"[""1.

Miss Sandal, looking worried, informed Dora about her brother's accident and rushed to his aid. She sent Oswald for a carriage and asked the girls to fetch Mrs. Beale for company. After bidding us farewell, she left. Mr. Sandal had fallen while distributing a pamphlet on sobriety. Luckily, a passing dust-cart saved their lives. Mrs. Beale, our caretaker, prepared a hearty meal, including a delicious Yorkshire pudding. Despite suggestions of street-singing, our village lacked the means for such activities. To pass the time, we crafted a colorful cardboard sign. Days passed with no incidents until a gentleman noticed our sign and approached us. He suggested a secret nighttime adventure to the Mill, igniting our curiosity and excitement.|"[""1.

There are three levels to a windmill, excluding the ground floor. The first floor is quite empty, the next is almost full of millstones and machinery, and the top floor is where the corn flows down onto the millstones. We had just managed to sneak out the last of the six blankets from the house and concealed it in the Mill disguised in a clothes-basket when we heard the sound of wheels, and the gentleman had returned. Mrs. Beale was greeting him at the door as we got up. We had informed her that he had rented rooms, but we had not specified how many, fearing she might inquire where we were planning to sleep. The gentleman had only brought one small portmanteau. He had to settle for eggs and bacon as there was no spinach in the village. After dinner, Mrs. Beale did the dishes and left. We were left alone in the mill. The girls kept the lantern while we climbed up with a small candle Dicky had saved. We tried to get comfortable among the millstones and machinery, but it was challenging. Oswald was relieved when Dora called from below, expressing discomfort. We decided to go down to join them as it was more comfortable among the fishing-nets. Sleeping in the mill turned out to be less fun than anticipated. It was uncomfortable without pillows, and the fishing-nets were stiff. Managing the blankets to keep out the drafts was tricky. The empty mill made strange noises at night, and Oswald felt like|['1.

Sleeping in clothes can make one feel unkempt and less polite than usual. This explains why tramps might act aggressively. Oswald even felt the urge to kick someone. Fortunately, no one provoked him. A weary group, dirtied from sleeping in a mill, walked to the white house. After freshening up in the kitchen, they had tea and eggs. They hurried to another part of the house before Mrs. Beale arrived. They marveled at the transformed dining room, now adorned with beautiful chalk drawings.

As we watched, a man with chalk all over him entered, carrying a wire and paper contraption. He began to unfold a flying machine. Dora silently urged us to leave, and as we did, she locked the door behind us. Dora explained that the man was unwell and could have made us jump out of a window. The man's attendant shared that he had not been the same since a flying accident. We learned that the man's brother was hurt, and the man took advantage of the situation. Despite our efforts to help Miss Sandal by renting out the house, our first lodger turned out to be unstable. Miss Sandal never returned, and we felt sorry for her situation.

Oswald dislikes abandoning a plan just because it didn't work out initially. Failing at first is common even for heroes, like Bruce and the spider. Grown-ups often say this is true for difficult subjects like math, and even more so when pursuing your own ideas. Oswald and his friends discussed making Miss Sandal rich during breaks from playing by the sea. They enjoyed talking to the coastguards for interesting stories. The coastguards shared tales of shipwrecks and officers they didn't like. They didn't think smuggling was a big issue nowadays. The children longed to play games like smugglers and bandits but felt growing up meant wanting more realism in their play. They met an old man by the beach who shared stories of pirates and highwaymen.|"[""1.

The old man handed over the bundle to the coastguard, who carried it up to his mother's place, feeling remorseful for suspecting the old man.

The old man mentioned how innocent people get wrongly judged due to lack of smuggling activities in the area.

The aged Viking man, now fully intrigued by our plan, carefully strategized the night's fishing adventure. He selected a dark night, timed the tide perfectly, and chose the dusk hour when the sea appeared its wettest. Clad in layers to combat the cold, we bid farewell to our family, resembling a scene from a sailor's departure. Our bundles packed with provisions, we set off for the boat. The Viking insisted on a covert boarding like stowaways to avoid drawing attention. With a final effort, we launched the boat into the water, and the adventure began.

When Oswald and Dicky first boarded the boat, they were curious about the kegs but were quickly told to stop asking. Oswald started to worry that their grand plan had been abandoned. However, during a night of fishing, they had a great catch. Oswald was thrilled, but Dicky missed it as he was asleep. The experience of being out at sea at night made Oswald realize the vastness of the world. The sky seemed higher, the stars further away, and the fish abundance from the deep sea made everything feel immense. After a successful haul, the boys were surprised by a coastguard from Longbeach, who had been unkind to them before. Despite the mixed-up smells on the boat, they all worked together efficiently to unload the fish. Oswald felt a sense of impending trouble due to the coastguard's presence.|"['1.

Our brave crew was ready to carry out their plan. More coastguards were gathering, wanting to involve all of Longbeach's coastguards in a prank. They opened the keg, only to find seawater. Despite this, the smell of brandy lingered. The crew confessed to the Lymchurch coastguards. They suspected a real cargo was smuggled that night. The children learned smuggling was dishonorable. They decided to play gypsies to help Miss Sandal. Living in her neat house was dull, with little to do but look at pictures. Oswald sought a book on fate, not the Holy Book. He asked Mrs. Beale to fetch it from Miss Sandal's.|['1. What did the crew find when they opened the keg?\nA) Brandy\nB) Seawater\nC) Gold coins\nD) Smuggled goods\nE) Sand', '2.

Mrs. Beale mentioned where Oswald could find a red book on the mantelshelf beside a tea-tin. Oswald retrieved the book from Mrs. Beale's house without any issues. The children spent the day telling fortunes using methods like cards, dreams, and an Emperor's ingenious means. They wanted to dress up as gipsies and tell fortunes in nearby villages. They searched Miss Sandal's room for costumes but found only grey and brown clothes. They then explored the attic and discovered a box with colorful clothes and accessories, including a striking scarlet coat embroidered with gold. The box contained a variety of beautiful silk garments and ornaments, indicating Miss Sandal's past love for pretty things.|"[""1.

Oswald, with a touch of sarcasm, suggested writing a letter to Miss Sandal, proposing to borrow her items to play gipsies and raise funds for her. The children dressed up in the borrowed clothes, creating unique gipsy outfits. Oswald sported a Moorish toreador look, Dicky wore a scarlet and gold coat, Alice dressed like an Italian peasant, and Noël became a troubadour bard. They bundled up their costumes and set out, some walking while others rode in a donkey cart borrowed from the sweet shop lady. The journey began under the bright blue sky, with the children planning to gather bluebells. However, their donkey proved stubborn, causing a comical struggle that attracted the attention of passersby.

The car's occupants acted predictably. However, mishaps can occur even with cars, especially when laughter distracts. The driver turned to laugh, causing the car to bolt into a stone wall. Fortunately, no one was injured except the car, which had to be repaired at the blacksmith's. Oswald's retribution was fulfilled. Unharmed, he caught up with the group as they continued their journey. After some searching, a secluded wood was found near Bonnington for their secret mission. Disguised with walnut stain and water, they transformed into gypsies. To attract attention, they planned to perform with combs veiled. Despite the discomfort, they practiced their tunes under the veils. Amidst a smoky lunch, they enjoyed the picturesque setting before leaving the woods, drawing curious glances from onlookers.|"['1.

One man, dressed in his Sunday best with black clothes and a blue tie, directed a group of people heading in the same direction, seemingly to church on a Thursday. However, they were actually going to a Primrose fête at Sir Willoughby Blockson's grounds. The man revealed that the villages would be empty, with only the elderly, babies, and their caretakers left behind. The children, who were actually the Bastables, wanted to earn money for a friend in need by telling fortunes at the fête. The man agreed to pay them two quid for their fortune-telling skills.

The man instructed the children to pretend to be fortune-tellers at a show. He gave them two pounds and told them to stay until five o'clock. They told fortunes to many people, trying to make each one different. At first, people laughed, saying they were too young. But the children played along, with Alice dressing up to look older. They worked hard, even though it was less fun than expected. The man left in anger, so the children sneaked away to avoid him. They earned the two pounds and had an interesting story to share.|"['1.

None of us, not even Oswald, understood what we were involved in until Dora received a pink satin box with three large bottles of A1 scent and postmarks from foreign lands. Inside was a letter thanking the group for lending Eau de Cologne, which led to a successful marriage. The letter also mentioned Mrs. Bax, a tired traveler returning from Australia, coming to rest in Lymchurch. The children were asked to be quiet and considerate, especially to Mrs. Bax, who had once been nearly eaten by cannibals. Alice joked about a hypothetical letter requiring constant jokes for Mrs. Bax. The children were given pocket money and reminded to give Mrs. Bax peace during her stay.

We also selected quiet books like ""Sonnets on Sleep"" and ""Confessions of an Opium Eater"" for Mrs. Bax.

Mrs. Bax shared a funny story about a woman on the train with seventeen parcels, one of them being a kitten that kept hiding. Despite our curiosity about the kitten, we politely changed the subject. Mrs. Bax tried to engage us in conversation about Australia and trains, but we remained quiet to respect her wish for peace. After tea, we went to the beach for a yelling match to release the tension of the hushed tones we used with Mrs. Bax. The next day, we avoided Mrs. Bax except during meals. We even had to shoo away organ-grinders to keep the area quiet for her. Unfortunately, the following day, Jake Lee, a local vendor, got hurt due to a passing motor-car scaring his horse. We offered to help by selling his goods to farmers' wives, choosing to wear shabby clothes to appear more deserving.

The day was perfect, with a cloudless blue sky as we lounged on the beach after a refreshing swim, all thanks to Mrs. Bax's permission. Having a grown-up around had its perks; they often say ""Yes"" to what you want, and if anything goes wrong, it's on them. We were all eager to please her, and she suggested a picnic with our friends, the Red Houses. Oswald volunteered to arrange the waggonette for the outing. The day was splendid, driving through familiar roads in the best waggonette, feeling comfortable in our second-best clothes. Finally, we arrived at Lynwood Castle, a picturesque sight with a moat and eight towers, surrounded by greenery and history."""|"[""1.

"The girls eagerly volunteered to care for the baby, so we allowed them. We also ventured through the castle, a new experience for us. Despite searching diligently, we couldn't locate the deepest dungeon beneath the moat, but we discovered various castle features like the holes for pouring boiling lead on besiegers and arrow slits. Climbing all eight towers, some parts were perilous, so Dicky and I prevented H.O. and Noël from climbing those sections. After our thorough exploration, lunch awaited. Noël complimented Mrs. Red House on her knowledge of people's favorite foods. As we relaxed under the may-tree, a peculiar sight caught our attention—a row of knobbly bumps resembling human heads atop the castle wall. These ""heads"" turned out to be children who joined us for lunch. Despite their different background, we welcomed them warmly and shared our meal, even H.O. showed kindness. Later, we engaged in games with the village children, realizing their challenges in understanding simple instructions. The adults also participated enthusiastically, relishing the rare opportunity to play. Amidst the fun, we noticed another child peering over the wall. Oswald reflected on the concept of one's ""best I,"" the ideal version of oneself, and felt gratified to offer comfort to the boy with the imprisoned father, even though it took him away from the games he loved."|"[""1.

He left through the grand entrance, hearing the games restarting. It made him feel noble, yet he felt ashamed. Oswald noticed the worn-out boots of the boy whose father was in jail, standing by the broken wall. The boy explained his father's arm was injured, and they had no money due to a new baby. Oswald felt uneasy, wanting to help but also wanting to leave. When Dora arrived, the games ended, and the village children left. Oswald found Dora in tears. They gathered for a meeting where Dora explained the boy's family struggles. H.O. regretted not listening earlier, offering his support. The group realized Dora's actions were right, showing empathy for the boy's hardships.|"['1.
