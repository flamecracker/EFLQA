The train halted for the day and enjoyed a feast cooked by Bright Sun. They resumed their journey the next day, facing difficulties crossing a river with steep banks.

"Dick stood motionless for a moment, watching as the fire and the thundering hoofs drew closer. Suddenly, he recalled what he had learned about backfires. Amid the chaos of the camp, he dashed to the south side, knelt in the dry grass, and lit a match. Seeing this, Conway shouted, ""Back fire!"" The flame grew rapidly, spreading to the right and left, devouring everything in its path. As the men scrambled to hitch the horses and mules to the wagons, Dick and Albert helped, feeling the urgency of the situation.

Dick and Albert observed the herd vanish into the distance, then assisted in restoring the camp. Although Conway recognized the boy's heroism, he remained silent. The ground cooled slowly, and the group journeyed across the charred land for the following day. Traveling north for ten days, they approached a wooded region, crossing creeks with cottonwood, ash, and other trees. The area boasted abundant grass, sustaining their horses and mules. While lacking buffalo, signs of bear, mule deer, and other wildlife were abundant. Camping near a rushing brook, Albert encountered a silver-tip bear peacefully drinking. The group reached a flat plateau with antelopes and prairie chickens, signaling fertile land. As they neared the misty high mountains, excitement for their gold-seeking mission grew. Amidst the cold, a comforting fire was built, and Albert was wrapped in warmth by Dick's buffalo robe. Bright Sun, the Indian, appeared silently, emanating an aura of wisdom and strength.|"['1.

Albert was puzzled but tired when he finally found Dick. Bright Sun had warned him about an important message. Suddenly, rifle bullets filled the air, and the boys knew they were under attack by Indians. Despite their dislike for Conway and his men, they grabbed their rifles to defend against the assault. As they ran towards the pass, a triumphant war cry echoed, and they saw shadows moving in the darkness. Overwhelmed, Albert collapsed from exhaustion. Dick, torn between helping his brother and joining the fight, faced a difficult decision. The battle raged on, with the sound of gunfire fading into the night as the Indians gained the upper hand.|['1.

Dick shivered in fear but quickly picked up Albert and his rifle, showing great strength. Together, they ran towards a dense thicket for safety. After running for a while, Dick noticed a pool of water and used it to help Albert. As they hid, the battle sounds faded, and silence surrounded them. The dark night made them glad as they felt hidden. They found a faint trail among the pines and climbed the mountain together, relieved to be safe. Despite the danger, they were grateful to be together and silently climbed higher, with Dick helping Albert along the way.|"['1.

After climbing for about fifteen minutes, Dick and Albert paused to look down at the pass below them. They heard a distant gunshot and saw a brief flash of red light before everything fell silent and dark. Without exchanging a word, they continued their ascent, finding it easier this time. As they climbed higher, the undergrowth disappeared, giving way to orderly rows of pine trees stretching upwards. Despite the wilderness surrounding them, both boys felt safe after the first hour of climbing. They rested in a secluded spot among tall pines, under the cold moonlight, feeling the vast emptiness of the world around them. The chilling loneliness was broken by the rustling of wild creatures nearby. As the night grew colder, Dick worried about Albert's well-being. Finally, they found a sheltered nook among rocks and pine boughs, creating a warm and cozy alcove with dried leaves.|"['1.

Albert lay quietly, his breathing steady as he drifted into a deep slumber. Dick, noticing his brother's peaceful sleep, covered him with his coat and nestled under a pile of dry leaves to join him in rest. In the dead of night, Dick stirred awake, feeling a slight ache as he moved. Confused and disoriented, he gazed up at the moonlight filtering through the pine branches. As the cold seeped into his bones, he realized the challenges they faced surviving in the wilderness. Longing for the warmth of a lost buffalo robe, Dick pondered how to overcome the harsh elements. Though engulfed in an eerie silence, the brothers found solace in each other's presence, bracing themselves for the unknown trials ahead in the vast, unforgiving landscape.|"['1.

He came back to the rocky cave shortly and lay down once more. Despite their situation, he was too young and healthy to stay awake for long. Soon, he slept deeply again. The next morning, he was the first to wake up. The sunlight was warm and cheerful, casting a golden glow. Dick, taking care not to wake Albert, sang loudly and cheerfully, trying to rouse his friend. They laughed and washed their faces in a nearby brook, feeling hungry but hopeful. They found ripe wild plums to eat, giving them strength. Dick explained their plan to find supplies left behind by others. He assured Albert they would survive and thrive, determined to return with food to sustain them.|['1.

Albert wasn't quite strong enough yet, but he would be soon. There were no Sioux in the valley, and it was best for him to stay in the pine shelter. Dick assured him he would be safe with a rifle. Albert, with his clear mind, agreed. As Dick set off on his mission, Albert found refuge in the pine shelter. Meanwhile, Dick, descending toward the pass, felt a heavy heart, haunted by the events of the night before. Despite his initial dread, the sunlight and the mountains' beauty calmed him. The silence of the desert below reassured him further. As he cautiously entered the pass, the sunlight faded, and the narrow cliffs loomed above. Amidst the eerie moaning wind, he discovered two dead horses and an overturned wagon, confirming his belief that the Sioux had indeed departed.|"['1.

Dick carefully inspected the wagon, feeling brave as he found a large blanket and some bacon left by the Sioux attackers. Despite the grim scene of fallen bodies around him, including familiar faces, Dick gathered supplies from the wagons for his friend Albert, who was starving. He found blankets, food like crackers and sardines, brandy for illness, and more. Overwhelmed by hunger, Dick resisted the temptation to eat until Albert could share the provisions. After securing his findings, he carried the heavy load back to Albert, leaving a buffalo robe hidden from scavengers.

"As he neared the pine alcove, he whistled a familiar tune, ""Silver Threads Among the Gold."" He expected Albert to recognize his whistle and emerge. Albert indeed responded with a whistle, joining the tune. Dick explained that he hadn't stolen treasure but had explored a lost battlefield. They had enough food for a week and could find more. They lit a fire to cook bacon, not minding if the smoke was seen. Gathering wood and using matches, they cooked bacon strips on sticks, enjoying the sizzle. The food was delicious, and they ate eagerly. The mountain air seemed healing, making them stronger. Dick urged Albert to get ready to explore for more treasure, emphasizing the value of their findings. He advised Albert to rest in the pine den to avoid potential wildlife encounters."|['1.

They extinguished the fire, and while Albert retreated into the pine shelter, Dick resumed his journey over the mountain. The sun was setting with a crimson glow in the west, casting twilight shadows in the east. Entering the pass at night required a different kind of bravery, and Dick felt a shiver run through him. Sometimes, the darkness holds a fear that even the bravest must face. Despite his apprehension, Dick hastened his pace, familiar with the path down the mountain after resting and eating. However, as he hurried, the twilight shadows crept closer, enveloping the forest behind him in darkness. Upon reaching the mountain's base, the plain ahead was obscured, and the forest behind appeared as a solid black mass. As Dick stepped into the pass, a sense of awe overwhelmed him. The wind whispered mournfully between the mountains, and the few stars above flickered dimly in the dusky sky. With both physical and moral courage, Dick ventured further into the night, approaching the battlefield hidden in darkness. As he passed broken wagons and heard eerie cries, he encountered wolves lurking in the shadows. A large timber wolf locked eyes with him, a silent challenge passing between them in the wilderness where guns were foreign, and the night reigned supreme.|['1.

Dick refrained from shooting at the wolf with fiery red eyes, opting to throw a stone instead. The wolf, unfazed, retreated as Dick continued his task. He scavenged the wreckage, finding useful items like medicine, flour, tea, coffee, shoes, and a valuable shotgun with over a thousand cartridges.

Dick's curiosity was piqued as he stumbled upon a wagon in a gully. The wagon, though overturned, was a treasure trove of supplies including weapons, tools, clothing, bedding, provisions, and medicines. Excited by the discovery, Dick decided to salvage the goods and bring them back to their den. With Albert's help, they retrieved the supplies over a few days, feeling well-equipped for any challenge that may come their way. Albert took on the role of cook, skillfully preparing meals with the newfound provisions.

Both boys felt fortunate during their time on the slope. The absence of rain was a stroke of luck, especially for Albert's safety. The dry and cool weather, along with the healing air, helped Albert regain his health. Albert's cheeks even regained color. They found fishhooks and caught mountain trout and other edible fish from a nearby creek. They spent a week on the slope, sleeping under blankets in a pine alcove. Luck stayed with them as it didn't rain, and they saw no sign of danger. Dick decided they should move deeper into the mountains to find better shelter for the upcoming winter. Dick would explore alone while Albert stayed to guard their supplies. Dick warned Albert about potential thieves and wild animals but assured him that keeping a fire would keep them at bay.|"[""1.

Albert smiled as Dick embarked on his journey towards the higher mountains. Armed with his rifle, hunting knife, and a revolver, Dick waved goodbye and began his ascent. The crisp air and breathtaking scenery filled him with joy. As he climbed, the pines grew shorter, and the air grew colder. Looking back at their camp, he saw the thin gray smoke from Albert's fire, reassuring him that all was well. Upon reaching the ridge, he was greeted by a majestic view of towering snow-capped peaks. Overwhelmed by the grandeur of nature, Dick felt a sense of awe and insignificance. After a moment of reflection, he descended, hopeful to find shelter in the valley below for him and his brother.|"['1.

In his search for a suitable home, Dick followed a narrow valley filled with pine, ash, and aspen trees. Exhausted from his journey, he knelt by a cold brook to drink its icy waters. As he continued, the valley widened, revealing cascading springs and rocky walls. Dick even stumbled upon a brackish hot spring, which he found surprisingly useful. Despite encountering curious wildlife like a mule deer and a bear, Dick remained hopeful as he explored the uninhabited wilderness. The valley offered potential for a new home, with its wooded surroundings and flowing creek.

He saw a thin column of smoke rising above the trees. Smoke meant a fire, which meant people, likely enemies in this region. Dick was searching for a new home for himself and his brother Albert. However, the presence of Sioux at the source of the smoke meant they had to change their plans. Despite the danger, Dick's courage and determination pushed him to investigate. As he cautiously approached the spot where the smoke had been, he found a large open area devoid of any signs of a campfire. Perplexed by the mysterious disappearance of the fire and its builders, Dick stumbled upon a deep, round pit nearby. Suddenly, the ground started shaking beneath him, accompanied by a low rumble, seemingly emanating from the pit.|['1.

Despite the trembling of the earth, he bravely entered the open area and noticed that the pit was now filled with water. Additionally, this water was boiling, evident by the bubbling and seething he observed. Suddenly, clouds of steam shot up hundreds of feet into the air, startling Dick, who hurried back to the safety of the bushes. The loud explosion that followed made him jump as a massive column of water shot up about fifty feet from the boiling pit, rising and falling. This was a geyser, a natural wonder shooting hot water periodically from deep within the earth. As the column gradually subsided, Dick cautiously approached the pit again, now empty. Fascinated, he continued his exploration down the valley, encountering more geysers, hot springs, and breathtaking sights amidst the majestic mountains.|['1.

Dick stood on a rock overlooking a serene lake below. Wild birds flew above its blue waters, and he thought he spotted a deer in the distance. Intrigued by a distant whistling sound, he cautiously ventured towards it. To his surprise, he discovered a massive elk emitting the sound. Despite being able to hunt it, Dick chose not to harm the majestic creature. As he reached the lake's edge, he marveled at its beauty and the wildlife around him. Pondering the fish in the water, he realized it could be a potential food source. However, refocusing on his task of finding a winter home, Dick resolved to continue his search, leaving the tranquil lake behind.|"['1.

In the mountains, Dick explored two clefts near the river. The first cleft was short and full of trees, offering no shelter. Moving on to the wider second cleft with a brook, he found a deserted log cabin hidden among rocks and trees. Despite its decay, Dick recognized it as a trapper's cabin, possibly used by beaver hunters long ago. Excited by the discovery, he saw potential in the cabin to become their new home. Determined, Dick cleaned the cabin, envisioning it as a cozy refuge from the wilderness. The isolation made him feel time was limitless, and he embraced the challenge of turning the cabin into a comfortable dwelling, ready for him and Albert to settle in.|"['1.

Dick had an adventurous day in the mountains. After raising a cloud of dust, he refreshed himself by diving into a clear brook with a deep pool. Despite the icy water, he swam vigorously and felt invigorated. Hungry, he feasted on cold supplies and watched the sunset. As darkness fell, he decided to spend the night in a cabin. Feeling a duty to protect his brother in the distance, he settled down for the night, unfazed by the dust and odors. In the quiet of the night, he awoke briefly to the sound of claws scratching at the door, likely a bear or panther. Unperturbed, he drifted back to sleep until the morning sun's rays woke him up.|"['1.

He bathed again in the pool, ate the remaining food, and set off back home at a fast pace. Along the way, he made many calculations. It would take a week to move all their belongings to the cabin over the range. Once there, he believed they would be safe for a long time. They could stay in the valley for years without seeing strangers. Approaching the pine alcove in the afternoon, he saw the smoke from Albert's fire and knew his brother was safe. Albert, holding a fish, spotted him first. They agreed to start moving immediately. Albert was excited by Dick's description of the enchanted valley and their new home. Despite wanting to see it right away, he had to wait as Dick needed to make multiple trips to transfer their belongings. They finally completed the task after a week, with Albert joining on the last trip. The weather remained favorable, and Albert enjoyed the mountain air, feeling stronger each day.

"Albert was thrilled by the valley, matching Dick's descriptions. He marveled at the geysers' eruptions, sampled mineral springs, and planned to learn their properties.

They organized supplies in the cabin, using tools from a wagon for racks and shelves. Dick reinforced the door to keep out wild animals. Repairing the roof was a challenge, but they managed with makeshift pegs. Albert cleaned the cabin thoroughly and lit the first fire, hoping the chimney would draw smoke properly.

Dick suggested sleeping in the tent to enjoy the fresh autumn air, contrasting the stuffy cabin. Albert's health improved in the enchanted valley, where they found wonders daily. Albert, content with their new life, became a skilled fisherman and used hot spring water for cooking. Dick, feeling confident about their food supply, set out to hunt elk.

The intense heat lingered, and the clouds merged into one vast blanket covering the sky. Despite the season's lateness, thunder reverberated solemnly among the valleys, accompanied by flashes of lightning. Darkness enveloped the landscape, akin to twilight. Rain cascaded down the cliffs, pounding against the cabin with such vigor that the window had to be shut. Dick felt grateful for the secure shelter, cherishing it for both himself and Albert. As the rain, driven by a west wind, intensified, Albert ignited a roaring fire, filling the cabin with warmth and comfort. The flames danced merrily, casting a cozy glow.

With the help of a hatchet and an auger, they installed three sturdy wooden hooks on each side of the doorway, resembling those found on a frontier cabin. Three robust bars were then dropped into these hooks, securing the door. Although the bars were on the outside, it was deemed impossible for any wild animal to pry them loose.

Both boys' hands trembled as they aimed their rifles, not out of fear, but from sheer nervousness. The bear, focused on hidden treasures, paid no attention to them. As they gazed down the barrels, the bear appeared monstrous and ever-growing under the moonlight and their imagination. They fired simultaneously, but the bear kept coming. In a panic, they barricaded themselves in the cabin as the bear roared and clawed at the logs. After a tense wait, they cautiously checked outside.

In the mountains, Dick and Albert hunted and lived off the land. They cured a bear hide and shot a young buffalo for food. Albert diverted hot spring water to their cabin. They found a sheltered meadow with buffaloes and killed two cows for meat. They jerked the meat to preserve it. The boys worked hard, knowing they needed to store enough food for the winter. They were content but ambitious, planning to hunt more furs and improve their home. Despite the cold, Albert's health improved, and they marveled at the increase in game in the valley. The boys chose not to kill more buffalo, mindful of not wasting food. They worked together, making the most of their resources and the bountiful nature around them.|"['1.

Albert and Dick were busy preparing meat for preservation. Dick set up a square frame with forked poles, about seven feet apart, and laid fresh green wood poles across. They placed strips of buffalo meat on smaller poles above a fire of birch, ash, and oak. They kept a watchful eye on the fire to ensure the meat dried properly. During the night, timber wolves approached, attracted by the scent of the meat. To scare them off, Albert and Dick shot two wolves. To safeguard the rest of the meat, they used a spring pole to hang it out of reach. Although the wolves attempted to get to the meat, the boys outsmarted them. Dick's invention proved useful, and they continued to dry elk, deer, bear, and fish on the scaffold. Despite the wolves' persistence, the boys managed to protect their food with innovative solutions.|['1.

In the moonlit forest, Albert watched as a group of hungry wolves gathered beneath trees filled with tempting meat. Despite their longing gazes and the delicious scents wafting through the air, the wolves knew the food wouldn't simply fall into their mouths. They began leaping for the dangling meat, creating a comical midnight ballet. Each wolf jumped eagerly, teeth snapping at the air, but no one could reach the prize. Frustrated growls filled the night as teeth clashed and mouths remained empty. The wolves howled in anger, expressing their disappointment to the moon. Even though they were big and strong, the wolves couldn't capture the elusive food. Eventually, they gave up leaping and sat on the ground, staring up at the unreachable feast. Albert found the scene both strange and funny but resisted the urge to laugh.|"['Question 1: What did the wolves gather beneath in the moonlit forest?\nA) Stars\nB) Clouds\nC) Trees\nD) Rocks\nE) Lakes', 'Question 2: Why did the wolves begin leaping for the dangling meat?\nA) To catch fireflies\nB) To entertain themselves\nC) To reach the moon\nD) To capture the food\nE) To scare away other animals', 'Question 3: What did the wolves do after they gave up leaping for the meat?\nA) Started howling at the moon\nB) Slept under the trees\nC) Began dancing around\nD) Started fighting amongst themselves\nE) Sat on the ground staring up at the feast', ""Question 4: How did Albert feel about the wolves' unsuccessful attempts to get the meat?\nA) Annoyed\nB) Sad\nC) Amused\nD) Angry\nE) Indifferent"", 'Question 5: What did the wolves do to express their disappointment to the moon?\nA) Laughed\nB) Cried\nC) Howled\nD) Danced\nE) Slept', ""Question 6: What adjective best describes the wolves' attempts to get the meat?\nA) Graceful\nB) Comical\nC) Fierce\nD) Swift\nE) Stealthy""]"|['C) Trees', 'D) To capture the food', 'E) Sat on the ground staring up at the feast', 'C) Amused', 'C) Howled', 'B) Comical']
In the mountains, Dick and Albert set a trap to catch ducks and geese instead of shooting them. They made hoops of split saplings in the water, covered with a netting made from elk and mule deer hides. The trap had an enclosure at the end. Dick marveled at the birds' unawareness of the danger. After finishing the trap at twilight, they eagerly checked it the next morning in the crisp air. The exhilarating mountain air made Dick feel alive. The trap was set, and they awaited to see what it had caught.|"['1.

In the golden morning, two boys were engrossed in their tasks in the happy valley, not missing human faces. Approaching a trap, they found ten ducks and two geese trapped inside. The creatures swam around in confusion. Reflecting on the animals' predicament, one boy mused about human foolishness in not seeing easy solutions to problems. They swiftly disposed of the captured birds, using the feathers for bedding. The boys faced a new challenge as mountain lions plagued their cabin. In response, they devised a clever gun trap using a rifle and bait to catch the predators. With determination and resourcefulness, the boys adapted to the wilderness, learning valuable survival skills along the way.|['1.

"After preparing the trap meticulously, Dick loaded the rifle with a cartridge. He ensured this was done last to avoid any mishaps during testing. Dick and Albert cleared a path on each side to guide the cougar, if it was indeed a cougar, towards the muzzle directly. Once satisfied with their work, the boys inspected it closely. ""Maybe,"" Dick pondered, ""but wolves are known for their intelligence, unlike cougars or pumas. Still, traps are designed this way for cougars, so let's see if it works."" Satisfied with the trap's setup, they headed back to Castle Howard as the night grew colder. Inside, they warmed up by the fire, surrounded by skins of various animals, creating a cozy and prosperous atmosphere. Despite initial restlessness, Dick eventually fell asleep, only to be awakened by a gunshot. Alarmed, they rushed out into the cold night to find a cougar caught in the trap. With a swift shot, the cougar was taken down, and they salvaged its hide to protect it from other predators."|"['1.

The trap they set caught several cougars, adding their skins to the collection. Dick suggested becoming fur hunters due to the valley's abundance of game. Al agreed, loving the valley's transformative effect on him. The cold weather hardened them for the task. They hunted buffalo, gathered elk skins, and trapped wolverines. A grizzly tripped the gun trap but was shot. They used the fur for warm clothing. They discovered a beaver population, trapping many valuable skins. Timber wolves were also hunted for their hides. Their success led to the timber wolves leaving the valley.|"[""1.

The boys focused on their fur trapping as a serious business, paying close attention to every step. They skillfully removed the skin immediately after the animal's death or soon after if caught in a trap. Carefully cleaning the skin of any fat or flesh without damaging it was crucial to maintain its value. They dried the skins in a cold, airy place, away from sunlight and fire, on a sturdy scaffold with a thatched roof for protection. Despite hearing about using compounds for curing, they found the cold mountain air to be sufficient. To make their trapping more efficient, they built a bark shanty near the beaver pond for shelter during their long trapping days. Their hard work and persistence paid off as they adapted to their new way of life in the wilderness.|"[""1.

The boys lived in a bark shanty near a cliff, where they slept comfortably wrapped in furs. They knew not to leave anything in the shanty due to the risk of wild animals. Once, a grizzly bear damaged the shanty, causing Dick to repair it. Later, Dick faced a grizzly bear alone, but Albert saved him with well-aimed shots. The boys worked hard, hunting game and cooking meals with flour and meal. Albert perfected cooking trout by seasoning and burying them in hot ashes. They also cooked ducks and geese by covering them in ashes until tender. The boys enjoyed their meals in the valley, appreciating the simple joys of their rugged life.|['1.

"In the wilderness, Albert and Dick cooked birds and big game over an open fire at their ""Suburban Villa."" They plucked, washed, and cut the birds to roast them on sticks. Albert's transformation from a sickly boy to a healthy one amazed Dick. The cold winter didn't hinder their fur trapping as they found a rich area in the Rockies. They increased their traps and learned to classify furs. They used a substance called barkstone, obtained from beavers, to enhance their trapping success. This acrid secretion helped attract animals.

In the forest, Albert and Dick concocted a potent mixture using barkstone, peppermint, cinnamon, and whisky to attract beavers. Despite missing nutmeg, their creation proved effective, leading to a valuable fur collection. A sudden heavy snowfall trapped the boys inside. To navigate the deep snow, they crafted snowshoes from ash and hide, a challenging task. After mastering the art of securing the shoes to their feet, the brothers ventured out.

Albert and Dick had been busy setting traps far from their shanty, hoping to catch valuable furs. Despite the heavy snow crushing their shelter, they repaired it diligently. Their snowshoe skills improved, allowing them to move efficiently. Although the snow persisted, their trapping thrived with high-quality furs. The valley teemed with game, especially buffalo, elk, and bear. Albert, alone on an expedition, encountered a beaver trap yielding fine fur. Carrying his prize, he headed back to Castle Howard.

Albert gazed at the massive wolves with fear. Their size and power were intimidating, with gleaming teeth and eyes. Unsure of what to do, he contemplated running into the deep snow to slow them down but worried about tripping in his snowshoes. Summoning his courage, he dashed into the open space, the wolves in hot pursuit. Despite the deep snow hindering them, the wolves closed in on him. Albert, recognizing the leader, fired a shot, hitting another wolf. The pack turned on the wounded one, buying Albert some time.

The wolves' fierce howls echoed as they closed in on the fleeing boy. Desperately, he fired multiple shots into the pack, causing chaos with snapping jaws and snarls. Despite his efforts, the relentless pursuit continued, with reinforcements joining in from the woods. The leader, a demon-like wolf, remained unscathed until a well-aimed shot brought him down. Another hunter, Dick, joined the fray, swiftly taking out more wolves with precise shots and a spray of pellets from his shotgun. The pack, unable to withstand the onslaught, retreated into the woods with defeated howls.

He rushed back to Castle Howard and retrieved a bottle of whisky, a reserve they had saved for special occasions, like making barkstone for trapping beavers. After giving Albert a strong drink, he felt well enough to help Dick skin the massive wolf. Albert declared his satisfaction in using the wolf's fur for decoration rather than its insides. Despite the wolves' cunning, Dick was determined to combat them. They constructed deadfalls and hunted with rifles, taking down fifteen wolves until the rest were too terrified to approach. As the snow melted, they stayed indoors, crafting tools and implements to improve their daily life.

The boys found a hidden hollow in a cliff, perfect for storing their furs. With determination, they moved their beaver furs, buffalo robes, and more to this secret spot. They even planted pine bushes to conceal it. This new storage space relieved their cramped cabin, giving them more living room. Feeling like royalty with their multiple residences, they decided to venture to the other side of the lake for more furs. They crafted a sturdy canoe from a pine log, showcasing their resourcefulness and teamwork.

Albert and Dick, two adventurous boys, found themselves in the midst of a sudden cold snap in the valley. Despite the freezing temperatures, they learned valuable lessons about survival. Albert, eager but cautious, learned the importance of thinking before acting, especially when it comes to leaping into new experiences like a canoe. With guidance from Dick, they practiced paddling and soon mastered the art, even using the canoe to transport their hunting spoils across the lake.

Dick and Albert found themselves in a secluded valley where they discovered a herd of buffaloes huddled together for warmth. Despite the temptation to hunt for good robes, they decided to spare the animals. The boys had enough ammunition to last them a long time, thanks to their careful use and the supplies they had brought along. As the cold winter began to fade and signs of spring emerged, Dick and Albert felt a sense of contentment in their self-reliant lifestyle.

Dick embarked on his journey the next day, well-prepared with supplies including jerky, weapons, and tools. Leaving his brother Albert behind, they exchanged a brief farewell. As he traveled, Dick marveled at the greenery of spring and the snow-capped mountains. Remembering the tragic events of the past, he revisited the site where a massacre had taken place, finding remnants of wagons and skeletons. Despite the eerie atmosphere, Dick pressed on, salvaging some useful items. Spending the night under the stars, undisturbed by passing wolves, he continued his exploration the next day, using a book of maps to determine his location in the vast wilderness.|['1.

"Dick found a map of the Rocky Mountain territory, but most of it was vague, often blank, so he couldn't locate himself and Albert. ""I can learn about the world except ourselves,"" he said, returning it to his pocket. His adventurous spirit led him to explore. He walked southwest for a day, planning to camp before returning. As he gazed at the mountains, the open plains seemed vast and lonely. Spotting antelope and buffalo, he felt a sense of companionship. Suddenly, Sioux hunters approached, chasing the buffalo. Realizing the danger, Dick hid in a gully, fearing being trampled. He peeked out and saw the successful hunt, staying hidden as the Sioux rode past, ensuring his safety."|"['1.

Dick, filled with fear, lay hidden, knowing the merciless Sioux were nearby. As the sun set, bringing darkness, fires lit up the plain as the Sioux skinned buffaloes. With creaking joints, Dick cautiously crept away, avoiding the warriors. When he heard ponies nearby, he changed course, feeling trapped. But his courage returned, and he boldly continued southwest.

The sound of hooves indicated that Sioux ponies were nearby. Dick observed them with the buffaloes, unguarded and unsuspecting. He devised a plan to take one of the horses and ride towards the mountains. Slowly creeping closer, he heard more hooves to his right, signaling the ponies were grouped. Dick cautiously approached, hiding in the darkness. He noticed tall Sioux warriors passing by, contrasting their dignity with the ruffians from the wagon train. Despite their boldness, Dick knew they showed no mercy. As he reached the ponies, he carefully whistled and offered grass to the nearest one, aiming to seize its bridle and make a quick escape.|"['1.

The boy and the pony locked eyes, their gazes intense. With remarkable clarity and sharp sight, Dick noticed the pony's wavering belief turning into suspicion. Taking cautious steps forward, Dick saw the pony's eyes shift fully to suspicion. Seizing the moment, he leaped forward, grabbed the bridle, and swiftly cut the hobbles. The pony reared and neighed in alarm, but Dick mounted him skillfully and spurred him on. Rifle shots rang out behind them, but Dick, bending low on the pony's neck, evaded the bullets. The Sioux warriors pursued, their war cries echoing across the prairie. Racing through the darkness, Dick strategized to outdistance his pursuers. As the moonlight dimmed, Dick pressed on, determined to find cover and escape. Despite the danger, he held onto his rifle, ready for any challenge ahead.|"[""1.

Dick rode his pony, rising on a swell higher than the others, a dark silhouette against the sky. The Sioux fired, but Dick's horse responded swiftly, carrying him down a slope, then through a depression where he lost his pursuers. Despite hearing their hoofs, he pushed his horse to outrun them. As the shouts of his pursuers turned to chagrin, Dick galloped on, confident they couldn't catch him. Riding through the darkness for an hour, his horse suddenly stopped, throwing Dick to the ground.

Dick walked to the pony, now dead and cold for a few hours. A bullet hole explained the shivers he felt earlier. Feeling sadness, he turned to his own situation. Alone on the prairie with hostile Sioux around, he longed for his mountains, lost valley, and brother. The dark, cold wind made him shiver. With no stars and black clouds above, Dick knew he had to fight to survive. He had lost his sense of direction but decided to move forward. Feeling better with motion, hope arose. The eerie wind seemed to discourage him, but he pressed on. Hearing hoof beats, he realized it was the Sioux. Despite the danger, he remained determined to survive.|['1.

Dick felt a surge of bravery. The danger ahead was real, unlike the eerie fear the wind's moans had stirred in him. If the Sioux were after him, they seemed few in number. Gripping his trusty repeating rifle, Dick felt a newfound affection for the weapon. Though not naturally ferocious, Dick knew the Sioux sought his life. Determined, he continued on his path, anticipating the Sioux's pursuit. As the hoofbeats drew closer, Dick discerned a lone horseman trailing him. Emboldened, he readied his rifle, prepared to face his solitary pursuer. The Sioux appeared on the horizon, a solitary figure on horseback. Dick knelt, poised for a shot, but the Sioux halted, locking eyes with the boy. Minutes passed in a tense standoff, the desolate surroundings heightening the suspense. The Sioux circled Dick, neither advancing nor retreating, shrouded in an otherworldly aura. As time slipped by, Dick's uncertainty grew, his senses reeling from the surreal encounter.|"['1.

Dick was certain that the warrior and his horse were not real, just a product of the mist and vapors, and that he was dreaming. As they drew closer, a sense of dread washed over him, fearing a demonic force was near. He crouched in pain, everything blurring before him. Suddenly, a shot rang out, snapping him awake. The Sioux had fired first but missed. Dick retaliated, narrowly missing. The warrior's bullet grazed Dick's temple, awakening a fierce determination in him. He waited, then aimed carefully, shooting near the warrior's head. The silent battle continued, each shot intensifying the tension. Despite being wounded, Dick remained resolute.

Dick's accurate shot took down the pony, but the Sioux swiftly evaded him. Despite the chance to end the duel, a feeling of hesitation stayed his hand. As the Sioux fled, Dick's moment passed, and he missed his shot. The Sioux vanished into the darkness, leaving Dick feeling like the victor in a ghostly battle. Reloading his rifle, he left the fallen Sioux's weapon behind, walking away from the encounter. The falling snow added to Dick's challenges, obscuring his surroundings.

Dick carefully kept his rifle dry by tucking it under his deerskin coat. While adjusting it, he felt a lump on his chest, momentarily puzzled until remembering U.S. history and geography, which brought a chuckle. Crossing a rise, he paused to eat jerked buffalo meat from his knapsack, fueling his courage. After drinking snow water, he rested, deciding to conserve energy in the deepening snow. Suddenly, a shadow appeared, followed by a bullet grazing his cheek from a Sioux warrior seeking revenge. Enraged, Dick swiftly shot the warrior, feeling pity despite the attack.

After a couple of hours, the snowfall began to ease up. The flakes were still falling steadily but not as heavily. His visibility improved slightly, allowing him to see a few hundred yards ahead through the mist. Despite this, the landscape beyond remained a white blur, leaving him unsure if he was heading towards or away from the mountains. After resting and having a meal, both physically and mentally, he felt somewhat better. The fear of the Indian's pursuit began to fade. Despite his weariness and frayed nerves, he knew the snow would stop, the sky would clear, and he could find his way to the mountains and his brother. Resting longer than usual, he observed changes in the terrain and hoped to find shelter soon, perhaps in a gully or near a stream with trees for cover.|"[""1.

The warrior was now lifeless, his evil power forever vanished. Dick hesitantly reached out to touch the cold face, confirming the stillness. Despite the eerie feeling, Dick knew he had to focus on his own survival. He took the warrior's blanket, rifle, and ammo, leaving the rest behind. After concealing the warrior in a snow bank, he built a protective wall of snow around his shelter to block the biting wind.

Dick found himself in a dire situation, stranded in the cold with only a pair of sunglasses to help him survive. He knew the sun's rays could be his savior. With determination, he used the sunglass to focus the sunlight onto some dry wood shavings. After a tense wait, a spark ignited the shavings, but a gust of wind extinguished the feeble flame. Despite his initial despair, Dick persevered, scraping more wood and trying again. This time, the flame grew stronger, defying the wind's attempts to put it out. The fire roared to life, providing Dick with warmth and hope.

Dick found victory in taming the flames, feeding them wood and watching them crackle and grow. He learned the joy of a fire's warmth, drying his clothes and feeling comfort. As he ate and rested, fatigue overtook him. Wrapping in blankets, he sat between the fires, gazing at the glowing coals. Shielded by a blanket, he listened to the wind's whistle, finding solace in its sound. The coals whispered hope, and as the fire dimmed, Dick succumbed to sleep, safe from the bitter wind.

The fire had dwindled into glowing coals as Dick awoke in the warmth of his alcove. The day passed into twilight over the snow-covered landscape, and darkness enveloped him as he awoke from his slumber. Unperturbed, he stoked the fire and gazed over the icy expanse beyond.

Dick woke up to a clear, cold day, spotting the mountains in the northwest. Realizing he had been moving away from them, he prepared to trek back. Battling the deep snow, he struggled to make progress, facing obstacles like icy crusts and hidden gullies. Despite the bitter wind and wetness, he pressed on, longing for his cozy den.

Dick sang and waved at the elk, finding it hilarious. The whirl of mountain and forest was dizzyingly fast. Losing his balance, he fell into his brother's arms, Albert. When he awoke, he tried to wave at the elk again but was surprised by his weak hand. Instead of the elk, he saw furs and weapons in a log cabin flooded with sunlight. Albert, looking healthy and strong, teased Dick about his tales of fighting an Indian. Albert served him chicken soup, made from a prairie hen he hunted. Dick felt better and marveled at his thin hand, contrasting it with his previous larger one. The brothers, in their cozy cabin named Castle Howard, shared a moment of laughter and warmth.|"[""1.

The boys set out to build a canoe using birch bark. They carefully peeled off a large piece of bark from a white birch tree, big enough for the entire canoe. They marked and cut the bark, then folded and stitched it to create the outer shell of the canoe. Next, they lined the inside with cedar strips and ash ribs to make it sturdy. To seal the seams, they used pitch obtained from a local spring. After adding string pieces and pitching the seams, they had a strong, light canoe. Despite sore fingers and hard work, they were proud of their creation. They tested the canoe on the water and found it to be a success.

In the fall, Albert and Dick planned to expand their fur trading. They explored the mountains for game and signs of intruders, aiming to store $20,000 worth of furs by spring. They had a productive summer, building shelters and preparing food. They found a new rock cave for their furs, diversifying their storage to avoid risk. The brothers were cautious of the Sioux tribe but focused on their trapping and survival skills. They toughened up by bathing in icy streams, swimming in cold lakes, and taking hot baths in natural springs. As autumn approached, they resumed trapping, using their skills and new ideas to catch beavers and other animals successfully.

Early one spring morning, they began their journey down the valley, retracing their steps from when they first entered. Walking in silence, they both turned back to see their house nestled in the spring foliage, evoking sentimental feelings in Albert. As they left the valley behind and climbed the slopes, the mountains seemed to engulf their past. Crossing the mountains under favorable weather, they reached the vast plains, perplexed by the endless green expanse. Despite uncertainty, they continued their journey with filled water bags, spotting antelope and buffalo in the distance. The abundance of game reassured them, hinting at the presence of the Sioux on the warpath.

Albert and Dick, worn down by endless wandering, pondered if a curse forced them to roam forever. Despite the irrationality, the idea stuck. The vast plains, barren of life, stretched endlessly. Hoping for a sign of human presence, they found none. Days passed under the unbroken sky. Their spirits sank, the superstition deepening. Changing directions failed to break the spell. Finally, a change in scenery lifted their mood. Resting in a cozy hollow, they savored a meal of buffalo and antelope. As night fell, Albert drifted to sleep, reminiscing about their valley.

As Dick climbed the gentle slope, the trees thickened, and the moonlight illuminated the valley below. A river meandered through the center, flanked by dense forests. In a clearing, Dick spotted a Sioux village with over two hundred lodges. Intrigued, he cautiously descended towards the village, blending with the cover of pines and oaks. As he approached, he observed three Indians, one of whom he recognized as Bright Sun, a transformed figure exuding authority. Despite his initial fear, Dick was captivated by the scene, feeling like he was in a dream.

Dick had a good reason to flee. The village was in an uproar, with barking, growling, and a chilling Sioux war cry. Realizing the little dog had betrayed them, Dick reacted impulsively, shooting it dead. Regretting his actions, he heard the village's pursuit. Determined to protect Albert, he raced up the slope, then slowed to conserve energy. Accepting their fate together, he headed straight for the hollow. Despite the danger, Dick's outdoor experience aided his swift escape. Evading the pursuers, he reached the hilltop, dodging bullets. Gaining strength, he sped downhill, creating distance. Approaching their camp, he called out to an alert Albert, prepared for the imminent threat.|"[""1.

Dick and Albert ran through the forest, trying to evade their pursuers. They heard the distant howls of dogs and the shouts of the Sioux, signaling that danger was close. Desperate for a moment of respite, they dropped into a shallow hollow to catch their breath, hoping the darkness would shield them. As they lay low, the moonlight illuminated the trees around them, but the threat of the Sioux lingered. Suddenly, shots rang out, narrowly missing them. Dick, keenly observant, spotted movement among the pines and took a shot in return. A cry confirmed his hit, offering a brief sense of retribution.

After Dick fired a shot, silence returned. The boys remained motionless, listening to each other breathe. Moonlight illuminated the slope, making the boughs and twigs shine. The scene appeared peaceful, devoid of people. Suddenly, rifle shots echoed from higher up the slope. Brown figures emerged, and Dick and Albert fired back. Bullets whizzed past them, but they continued firing. Unaware of approaching footsteps, Sioux warriors surrounded them. Albert was captured, and Dick was knocked unconscious. Upon waking, he found himself in a Sioux village. Bright Sun, a Sioux warrior, explained their tribe's pride and history. Dick respected their heritage and admired their strength.|"['1.

Bright Sun proudly stated that their tribe, the Akitcita, comprised soldiers and policemen aged between twenty and forty. These warriors lived together in a common house where women and children were not allowed. He drew a parallel to the Spartan young men who lived as soldiers, a practice admired worldwide. The Sioux, unfamiliar with the Spartans, had a similar tradition of warrior living. Bright Sun asserted that they were a warrior race known as the Seven Fireplaces, strong and united. Despite being at war, Dick's brother Albert was safe in the village as a hostage. Bright Sun emphasized the importance of cunning in warfare and requested Dick's word not to escape, ensuring their safety.

Impressed by Bright Sun and the silent warriors, Albert and Dick found themselves in a village full of bustling activity. The warriors, focused on their tasks and smoking with dignity, paid no attention to the newcomers. Rush mats and a totem pole adorned the lodge. Albert, thrilled by the surroundings, helped Dick regain his strength. As they ventured outside, the vibrant village life unfolded before them. They observed children playing, women gambling, and the drying meat of buffalo, elk, and deer. Dick estimated the village to house about two hundred lodges and four hundred warriors. Amidst the picturesque setting, the boys watched the women play the Sioux game of dice, Woskate Tanpan. The atmosphere was alive with the essence of a prosperous and wild community.|"['1.

The two brothers joined a group of men watching a game of Woskate Painyankapi, involving hoops and wands. The warriors rolled ash hoops, aiming to land them on chokecherry wands marked like a clock face. The game required skill and judgment, with points awarded based on where the hoop landed. Despite their failed attempts, the boys were entertained by the spectacle and the villagers' reactions.

Dick and Albert stayed in the village for about two weeks, held as guests but under the constant threat of being taken as prisoners. They observed the organized structure of the Sioux tribe, noting the disciplined order within the Akitcita lodge. The Sioux followed ancient rituals and religious practices, governing much of their daily life. The boys respected the tribal customs and were cautious not to unintentionally offend any sacred laws. Despite their efforts to connect with the Akitcita members, they felt a growing sense of cultural and racial differences. Bright Sun, who had been educated in the boys' schools, seemed to embody this divide, making them feel even more distant. Despite their initial reservations, Dick and Albert began to recognize Bright Sun's leadership qualities, evident in the respect he commanded from everyone in the village. After their initial stay in the Akitcita lodge, they were relocated to their own small tepee, accepting their captivity with a sense of resignation.|['1.

After moving to a new village, the atmosphere changed drastically. The elderly women stopped playing Woskate Tanpan in the lodge shadows, and the men abandoned Woskate Painyankapi. The village buzzed with excitement and tension, indicated by the Sioux's stoic demeanor. The beat of war drums and constant medicine rituals heightened the suspense. Dick felt restless, sensing something significant was happening. Albert shared his unease but felt bound by their promise to Bright Sun. As the village erupted in joy, welcoming hundreds of formidable, armed warriors, Dick and Albert were swept into the jubilant crowd. The warriors, led by Bright Sun, convened a crucial council.

The dim light and the boys' vivid imaginations made the lodge seem larger and take on incredible forms. The presence of powerful chiefs gathered for a significant purpose captivated Dick's attention. Bright Sun, seated among his equals, appeared to be the central figure guiding the project. Although they saw nothing concrete, the boys were mesmerized by their own desires.

After a restless night, Dick and Albert woke early to witness Bright Sun's prophecy coming true as the village was swiftly dismantled. They rode alongside the warriors on bridled ponies, surrounded by silence. The journey led them through the valley and across a river, into the vast plains where they camped for the night. Dick sensed an air of caution among the warriors, suspecting the presence of white people nearby. His fears were confirmed as more Sioux warriors joined them, armed with modern weapons.

Every day, bands of warriors joined forces, ranging from a few to as many as twenty. They arrived silently from all directions, understanding their roles without words. A mastermind orchestrated their movements with great discipline. As Dick and Albert journeyed through hilly terrain towards a river, they encountered mounted Indians approaching to meet them. The warriors' joyous greetings indicated the proximity of a village. Upon reaching a valley, the boys were awestruck by the vast Indian town that sprawled along the riverbanks.

"""Thank you, ma'am,"" expressed Albert gratefully as one of the elderly squaws refilled his small earthenware bowl with cherry-bark tea. ""Your kindness is truly appreciated. I did not anticipate such warm hospitality.""

""Be cautious, Al, my friend,"" Dick warned playfully with a serious expression. ""These elderly Native American women sometimes adopt children, or who knows, she might propose marriage to you. I believe the latter is more probable, and you won't have a say in it.""

"""All right, Mr. Lone Wolf,"" said Dick cheerfully. ""Four are company, two are none.

Lone Wolf and Pine Tree were young, and maybe their youth caused them to smile slightly at Dick's pleasantry. Nor did they annoy the boys with excessive vigilance, and they answered many questions. It was, indeed, they said, the greatest village in the West that was now gathered on the banks of the Little Big Horn. Sioux from all tribes had come including those on reservations. All the clans of the Mendewahkantons, for instance, were represented on the reservations, but all of them were represented here, too.

It was a great war that was now going on, they said, and they had taken many white scalps, but they intimated that those they had taken were few in comparison with the number they would take. Dick asked them of their present purpose, but here they grew wary.

Dick and Albert, two brave boys accustomed to the wilderness, were impressed by the appearance of the fierce warriors they encountered. These men, dressed in buffalo robes adorned with vivid paintings of hunts and battles, exuded a warrior-like aura. Armed with rifles and revolvers, they spoke in the language of the white man but had shed all traces of his attire. The chief, Bright Sun, observed them closely, seeking the truth about the soldiers' movements. He warned of the impending clash between the advancing soldiers and the cunning Sioux forces.

The vast, grassy area in front was picked by the wise tribal leaders, with Sitting Bull at the helm. The women erected a massive circular tent, akin to a circus top, with a part open above. This tent spanned over a hundred and fifty feet. Following this, the elders chose a small tree, felled by a young, unmarried woman. After being stripped of branches, sanctified, and prayed over, the tree was raised in the center, reaching about twenty feet high. Long rawhide thongs were attached to the top of the pole, almost touching the ground. A group of young men emerged from the lodges, dressed in unique attire, each with painted skin and wooden sticks inserted into their chests. They linked the thongs to the cords on their chests, forming a circle. The ceremony began with a medicine man blowing an eagle bone whistle continuously, while warriors danced around the pole, aiming to tear the peg from their bodies to prove their warrior readiness. Despite the discomfort, Dick and Albert stayed to witness the dance, feeling compelled by the intense atmosphere.|['1.

The group of new members grew larger as they made space for each other, and the crowd around them became denser. Countless dancers twirled and leaped to the high-pitched, continuous sound of the eagle-bone whistle. Dick and Albert felt as though the ground shook with the powerful steps of the grandest sun dance. The Native Americans lost their usual calmness; sweat dripped from their dark faces, their eyes turned bloodshot from dancing vigorously, and wild shouts filled the air. The dance grew more chaotic as thousands of feet stirred up a fine dust that clouded the air, making the dancers' eyes and noses burn. Some collapsed from exhaustion, but others quickly took their place, swelling the dancing throng. Dick and Albert observed the Sioux tribe dancing as far as their eyes could see. The scene was a sea of moving heads and glistening bodies, all dancing with fervor. The piercing, unending rhythm of the whistle never faltered, dominating the dance and even affecting Dick and Albert. They felt their nerves pulsating in response to the whistle's call, and the energy of the dancers began to affect them too. As the sun set behind the hills, a twilight filled with red hues descended, adding an eerie atmosphere to the already intense dance. Despite the encroaching darkness, the dance grew more vigorous and electrifying. The moon's silver light illuminated the dancers, but the primal intensity of the dance remained unchanged, a display of ancient customs and raw|"['1.

Bright Sun left the group when they couldn't answer him, returning to the dance with more enthusiasm, bringing in new participants and increasing the excitement. Dick and Albert lingered, observing the scene. Lone Wolf and Pine Tree, their guards, remained close by. While the two young warriors followed orders and refrained from joining the dance, they were tempted by the revelry, but they resisted.Lone Wolf and Pine Tree seemed willing, and Dick suspected they might join later. After Albert went inside, Dick paused at the lodge's entrance, taking in the chaotic scene. The sun dance continued for three days and nights without pause, with participants dancing without food or drink. The village feasted afterward, consuming abundant game until they fell into a stupor. The boys marveled at the display of valor and readiness for battle among the warriors. As the village rested, Dick and Albert seized an opportunity to escape under the cover of darkness with only Pine Tree as their guard. They waited for the right moment, hoping Pine Tree's lax watch meant he was asleep. After careful observation, they prepared to make their move, relying solely on stealth and agility.|"[""1.

The calm of the village remained undisturbed as the lodges extended into the darkness. Suddenly, Pine Tree, who appeared to be asleep, startled Dick and Albert with his piercing gaze and a loud yell before chasing them. The boys, defenseless, sprinted through the lodges, only to be captured by the awakened townspeople. Albert was seized and taken away, while Dick found himself surrounded by warriors, squaws, and children. Despite being bound, Dick chose to yield gracefully, hoping for a chance to escape. Bright Sun, a stern Sioux chief, ordered Dick to be kept apart from Albert until they decided their fate. Dick, filled with mental anguish, realized the danger they were in and regretted their escape attempt. As the warriors ate their morning meal, Dick remained bound, anxious about their uncertain future.|['1.

No one responded to Dick's questions. They appeared to ignore him. Dick suspected some understood English but deliberately kept him in the dark. He decided to mimic their calmness and wait. When they tied his arms and legs again, he didn't resist, laying down quietly on the mat, gazing indifferently at the lodge's wall. All warriors left, except one guarding the door with a rifle. Though securely bound with soft deerskin thongs, Dick felt restless. Unsure of his fate—torture or death—he struggled to remain composed. The village's bustling sounds reached him, but the guard remained unmoved, resembling a statue. Dick pondered if the Sioux would ever move, feeling a mix of anger and wonder. As sunlight streamed in, he wished for darkness in his dire situation.|"[""1.

Dick's heart sank upon hearing those words, realizing his fate was sealed. Despite his fear, he forced himself to eat, trying to show courage in front of Lone Wolf. Led outside, the brightness of the day blinded him at first, but as his eyes adjusted, he saw a crowd surrounding him. Knowing his end was near, he silently prayed for bravery. Prepared to face his fate like a warrior, he was led by Lone Wolf, with the crowd's attention fixed on him. As he gazed at the familiar landscape, he felt a mix of emotions. Observing the cruelty of the Sioux, he despised them. Tied to a sapling, he faced a tormenting trial as young Sioux boys aimed arrows near him. Despite his fear, he stood firm, knowing any flinch could be fatal.|"[""1.

Dick, a bound boy, faced a daunting challenge as arrows whistled past him. Despite the crowd's applause, which was more of a taunt, Dick stood firm, determined not to flinch. Suddenly, three white cavalrymen appeared, signaling the approach of a potential rescue. The village erupted into chaos as warriors prepared for a possible confrontation. Dick, captivated by the unfolding events, watched as the cavalrymen vanished from sight. The chief, Bright Sun, acknowledged Dick briefly before turning his attention back to the hill. The village bustled with activity, hinting at an imminent clash. As the tension mounted, Dick remained bound but hopeful, his eyes fixed on the hill where the cavalrymen had briefly appeared. The scene was set for a dramatic encounter between the Sioux warriors and the approaching army.|"[""1.

Dick waited anxiously, surrounded by an eerie silence after the village noises faded away. The sun shone brightly, revealing nothing of the hidden Sioux army on the riverbank. As the tense moments passed, a murmur from the village hinted that the white army was not near. Suddenly, a black speck emerged, signaling the arrival of the white horsemen led by a yellow-haired general. Despite his attempts to break free, Dick remained bound, watching in fear as the army approached the river. He realized the danger they faced from the hidden warriors on the opposite shore. Desperate, he shouted a warning, but his voice was drowned out by the trumpets and the thundering hooves of the approaching army.|"['1.

They neared the river, warriors swarming on their flank, held by Bright Sun. Sitting Bull, the powerful medicine man, sweated profusely, creating potent medicine. Closer they rode, undergrowth waving gently. Dick stopped shouting, feeling helpless. Unnoticed, he watched the event unfold. Sweat dripped into his eye. The trumpet's mellow notes echoed, hoofs beating rhythmically. A line of flame burst from the bushes, rifles thundered, Sioux war cries echoed. The white army shivered under unexpected bullets. Despite casualties, they pressed on. Continuous rifle fire from the undergrowth, deadly and unrelenting. The cavalry fired back, attacked on the flank by Sioux warriors led by the fierce Pizi (Gall). The valley filled with rifle fire, smoke, and flashes of fire. Custer, unwounded, led the halted, dwindling army, unable to cross the river, surrounded by chaos.|"['1.

Three or four troopers had fallen or plunged into the terrible quicksand on the other side, and as Dick looked, they were slowly swallowed up. Unable to bear the sight, he shut his eyes. When he opened them, the men were gone. Custer's front ranks were now dismounted, bravely replying to the fire from the other side of the river. Despite the deadly trap, they rode so close to the bank that many were slain, falling into the water. The yellow-haired leader waved his hat, and the troopers turned back. The Sioux let out a ferocious yell as the white force, still firing, made its way. The attack grew heavier, but they pressed on. Custer's army, though thinned, maintained a steady front. Forced to stop, they formed a circle, firing at the encroaching Sioux from all sides. The leader with the yellow hair continued to cheer on his men. The white force divided, creating a circle with the horses in the center. Confident in their numbers, the Sioux pressed forward, led by chiefs like Gall and Crazy Horse, charging the white troops repeatedly.|"['1.

Dick watched the intense battle unfold before his eyes. The scene was chaotic, with his own blue-clad people at the center, surrounded by howling warriors. Despite the smoke and the red flashes of rifles, the fight raged on. Custer's force, though greatly diminished, continued to resist the overwhelming Sioux numbers. Dick was mesmerized by the bravery displayed on the battlefield. As the sun dipped low in the sky, he hoped that nightfall might bring respite. However, the savages pressed on relentlessly, their ammunition replenished. The leader, hatless and with wild yellow hair, urged his men forward.

Dick reached a low hill and paused to listen. In the distance, he heard faint sounds and saw lights flickering in the village. Feeling a sudden surge of hatred towards the hill, he shook his fist at it before continuing his journey. As he moved away from the battlefield and the village, he felt a sense of relief. Determined to find and rescue Albert, he crossed the river and headed back towards the village on the other side. Alone in the darkness, he was haunted by memories of the fierce battle and the Sioux horde. Despite the silence, he felt a heavy loneliness and fear, longing for the company of his own people. Ignoring hunger and fatigue, he waded through the cold river and cautiously made his way back towards the village, staying hidden in the dense undergrowth to avoid the celebrating Sioux.

"He climbed a small hill and gazed at the Indian village below, distant from where he had stood during the battle. The village glowed with torches and campfires, figures moving in the flickering light. Overwhelmed by despair, he pondered the challenge of finding Albert in the vast five-mile-long village. Despite his initial despair, he resolved to attempt the rescue. Descending the hill, he took cover in a bush near the Little Big Horn. Hearing a rustle and catching a glimpse of a shadowy figure, he realized a Sioux warrior lurked nearby. Initially tempted to retreat, anger surged within him. Determined to strike back, he cautiously advanced, rifle ready. After a tense ten-minute crawl, he spotted the warrior and aimed, but his civilized nature prevented him from firing. Instead, he called out, ""Throw up your hands!"" The two met in the bushes, sharing their harrowing experiences of the battle and captivity."|"['1.

The shooting continued for a long time, and I tugged and kicked at the lodge door for an hour. Despite my efforts and the noise I made, no one came. I realized something significant was happening, so I redoubled my efforts. Finally, when I peeked outside, I witnessed many warriors in motion and thick smoke billowing. I stealthily crept out, dodged a Sioux's bullet, hid in a ravine, then darted through the smoke to safety in the bushes. As night fell, I lay low until the gunfire subsided, and our men were forced to retreat after suffering heavy losses. Albert, recounting his escape, shared how he sprinted away when darkness fell, leaving the Sioux behind. He returned to find me, and together we fled. We spotted lights on the bluffs and encountered soldiers. One of the lieutenants questioned us suspiciously, but we explained our survival story from the emigrant trail massacre.
