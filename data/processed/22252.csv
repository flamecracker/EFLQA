Mr. Holiday's health deteriorated, delaying his return until September or even the following spring. Mrs. Holiday, though disappointed, accepted the situation cheerfully, inspired by her son Thanny's patience. Unable to visit her children, she suggested they come to her. Initially hesitant, she eventually proposed the idea to her husband, who, after some thought, welcomed it. They decided to bring Rollo and Jane across the Atlantic. Mr. Holiday planned for the children to travel on a steamer from New York to Europe, with arrangements made by Rollo's uncle George.

One evening in late May, Rollo and Jane received exciting news that they would be crossing the Atlantic. They were having supper by a brook in the garden when their uncle shared the plan. Their father, unwell, had arranged for them to join him in England. Rollo was thrilled, while Jane, unsure about leaving, accepted her fate. The children had a week to prepare, and their uncle quickly secured passage on a steamer in New York. He explained the process of obtaining a permit to board the ship, as access was restricted due to the high interest in these voyages. The children were to pack simple clothes for the journey, as most necessities could be found on the other side. The adventure was about to begin!|['1.

Mr. George had a ticket and boarded an omnibus at Wall Street, traveling to Canal Street. From there, he took another omnibus toward the East River, then walked the remaining distance. The streets were crowded with people, carts, and vehicles, making it hard to cross. Mr. George helped a servant girl and a boy get across safely. He then encountered a beggar boy who turned out to be pretending. Ignoring the boy, Mr. George proceeded to the pier, passing through enormous gates. Inside, he saw laborers moving merchandise under a vast roof. Boarding a steamship, he found luxurious cabins with state rooms.

Lottie's uncle Thomas and Rollo were both set to depart on the same day, Thomas to Charleston and Rollo to Europe. This seemingly minor coincidence led to significant consequences. In big cities, there are separate systems for transporting baggage and people. Expresses handle baggage, where owners keep records of items to be transported. Carriages are available for people to move around the city. Thomas planned to use an express for his trunk and walk to the ship himself. Meanwhile, Mr. George arranged for a carriage to take the children and their trunk directly. As they reached the pier, a commotion blocked their path. Mr. George, unsure of what to do, had to act quickly amidst the chaos of carriages and people.|"[""1.

Mr. George guided the children through a bustling crowd onto a ship's deck. They navigated a narrow passageway and climbed steep steps to the promenade deck, offering a view of masts, ropes, and curious objects. Mr. George left them on camp stools to watch people boarding. He instructed them to stay put while he fetched a trunk. As he hurried off, the children felt a moment of loneliness amid the busy scene. Rollo observed Jennie tearfully struggling for her handkerchief. They watched Mr. George head to the pier, speak to a carriage driver, and speed off to retrieve the trunk before the ship's departure. Despite the commotion, the children felt a mix of anxiety and fear, with Jennie shedding tears and Rollo grappling with fading courage.|"['1.

It may be thought that Rollo would feel down seeing Jennie sad, but the opposite was true. It's a common truth that having a woman nearby, relying on a man for protection, can give him courage to face challenges. Even though Rollo and Jennie were young, their instincts were developing. Rollo regained his confidence seeing Jennie cry. He knew he had a duty to fulfill. Instead of giving in to fear, he decided to face the situation bravely. Rollo pointed out the activity on the pier to Jennie, distracting her from her worries. As they observed the hustle and bustle of passengers boarding the ship, Jennie started to find it interesting. Rollo kept reassuring her about their uncle's return, though he didn't know when it would happen. The pier was getting busier as departure time approached. Carriages and people filled the area, creating a lively atmosphere. Despite the chaos, the ship remained anchored, its paddle wheels churning the water and steam billowing into the air.|"[""1.

Rollo witnessed a dramatic incident unfold as a child fell off a sloop into the water near the steamer. The child's screams pierced the chaotic scene as sailors and onlookers rushed to help. A brave man dived in, rescued the child, and brought her back safely. Despite the commotion, the crowd around the steamer remained engrossed in their own activities. As time passed, fewer people arrived, and the focus shifted to departing from the ship. Just as the ship was about to leave, Mr. George's carriage hurried in. Despite the rush, the trunk was passed through a porthole, and Mr. George reassured the children from below. Rollo remained optimistic, looking forward to reuniting with their parents in Liverpool.|"[""Question 1: What was the initial incident that unfolded near the steamer?\nA) A man dived into the water\nB) Mr. George's carriage arrived\nC) A child fell off a sloop into the water\nD) The ship was about to leave\nE) Rollo remained optimistic"", 'Question 2: What did the brave man do during the chaotic scene?\nA) Passed a trunk through a porthole\nB) Rushed to help the child\nC) Reassured the children from below\nD) Looked forward to reuniting with parents\nE) Engrossed in their own activities', ""Question 3: What did the crowd around the steamer remain focused on despite the commotion?\nA) Departing from the ship\nB) Reuniting with parents in Liverpool\nC) Rescuing the child\nD) Mr. George's carriage\nE) Diving into the water"", ""Question 4: What happened just as the ship was about to leave?\nA) Rollo remained optimistic\nB) Mr. George's carriage arrived\nC) The child's screams pierced the scene\nD) Fewer people arrived\nE) The trunk was passed through a porthole"", 'Question 5: Who reassured the children from below as the ship was about to leave?\nA) The brave man\nB) Rollo\nC) Mr. George\nD) The sailors\nE) The onlookers', ""Question 6: What was Rollo looking forward to as the story progressed?\nA) Departing from the ship\nB) Reuniting with parents in Liverpool\nC) Rescuing the child\nD) Mr. George's arrival\nE) Remaining engrossed in activities""]"|"['C) A child fell off a sloop into the water', 'B) Rushed to help the child', 'A) Departing from the ship', ""B) Mr. George's carriage arrived"", 'C) Mr. George', 'B) Reuniting with parents in Liverpool']"
As the ship began its journey, the passengers bid farewell in three distinct scenes. First, individuals said goodbye to their friends on the ship. Then, the passengers collectively waved and cheered goodbye to the spectators on the pier. Lastly, the ship itself bid farewell to the city with the firing of two guns. The passengers responded with enthusiasm, waving hats and handkerchiefs. The scene was lively with people climbing on boxes and bales to catch a last glimpse.

Rollo always carried his inkstand and pocket book with him while traveling. He wrote a letter to his uncle George on a sheet of note paper, sealed it with a wafer, and handed it to a gentleman who took it to the pilot boat. The pilot boat approached the ship, and a small boat rowed by sailors came alongside. Rollo watched anxiously as the boat was secured to the ship with a rope, ensuring the safe transfer of the pilot. Once the pilot was on board, the ship's engines restarted, and the journey continued. Meanwhile, Rollo and Jane noticed many passengers heading downstairs for lunch. Curious, they followed suit, descending a steep staircase to a lower deck filled with cabins and mirrors, eventually reaching a grand staircase leading further down into the ship.|"['1.

Jane felt anxious about bringing the kitten along but decided to follow Rollo's instructions. They walked through a narrow passage on the ship towards the front. The rocking ship made Jane hold onto the walls for balance. Climbing up and down some steps, they reached a dining saloon with passengers enjoying lunch. A waiter guided them to a table. The dining room had round holes for windows, thick glass panes, and ledges on tables to prevent dishes from sliding. The seats were cushioned settees. They enjoyed soup, roasted potatoes, and beef.

Rollo and Jane settled into their state rooms on the ship. Jane, delighted, released the kitten from its cage. The curious kitten explored the room, even climbing onto the marble washstand and gazing out the round window at the sea. Eventually, the kitten curled up on the couch and fell asleep. Rollo and Jane inspected the furniture, noting how securely everything was fixed to prevent movement during the ship's journey. The wash basin was immovable, with a plug to drain water. The tumbler was cleverly secured in a brass ring, and the other accessories were fitted into sockets on the washstand. Shelves were replaced by canvas pockets to keep items secure.

Maria explained the importance of having money in case of emergencies on a ship. She advised Jane to keep the money safe in her purse and the trunk locked. Maria also showed Jane a quiet spot on the ship where she could relax and be alone. Later, Rollo and Jane explored the deck and observed sailors climbing the rigging effortlessly. Jane chose not to ask the helmsman about the ship's bell, and they watched the sailors work on the sails. The bell rang four times, signaling a change in the ship's course. They spent hours observing the activities on the ship and enjoying the view of the vast sea around them.|"['1.

"Presently, a young man, around eighteen or nineteen years old, on another mast, did something even Rollo admitted he wouldn't try. He had to work on some rigging about fifteen feet down. He came down on a rope called a ""stay,"" hung over his shoulder, hand over hand. Once there, he tied one end of a short rope to the stay. Sitting on the cross rope, he could use both hands to work. He untied the cross rope after finishing and went back up the cable. Rollo and Jane watched the sailors unfurl sails as the ship sailed smoothly. Jane thought she saw whales, but they were porpoises. A passenger, the ship's surgeon, explained the bell signals and his role on the ship."|"[""1.

At sea, time is marked differently than on land. Clocks are impractical on ships due to the changing time each day. The ship's time depends on the sun's position. When sailing east, noon arrives earlier, and when sailing west, noon comes later. To keep track, sailors strike bells every half hour to signal they are on duty. The ship's bell system indicates time by half hours instead of hours. For example, eight bells signify 4 o'clock in the morning, afternoon, and evening. The gong at eight bells in the morning wakes passengers, and the captain determines the ship's position and plans for the day at noon. Lunch, dinner, and tea times are also marked by eight bells, with crew shifts coinciding.|"[""1.

"The surgeon explained that sailors don't like answering questions from landsmen on ships because they find them foolish. Landsmen often ask about the end of the voyage or when the wind will change, which sailors can't predict. Sailors give funny answers like ""The first of the month"" to tease passengers. The captain dislikes such questions too as he can't foresee the weather. Once a passenger asked a sailor about seeing whales, and the sailor joked about whales appearing the next morning, making the passenger wait in vain. The surgeon compared landsmen's questions at sea to sailors asking silly questions on a farm. Sailors find landsmen's ignorance about the sea ridiculous.

The surgeon advised Rollo to be cautious about the questions he asks the officers and seamen on the ship. He warned Rollo that not everything they say might be true and that they might even make fun of him. The surgeon assured Rollo that he could ask him anything, and he would answer honestly. He also shared that certain areas of the ship, like the paddle boxes, are restricted to passengers as they are meant for the seamen. The surgeon recounted a story of a passenger who climbed the rigging and was tied up until he paid the sailors a dollar. Rollo learned the importance of staying in appropriate areas on the ship and vowed to respect boundaries both on the ship and in other places.|"['1.

Rollo agreed to stay on the settee while Jane went downstairs. Jane smiled at him before descending the steep stairs from the deck. She held onto the green rope as she carefully made her way down. Rollo followed after a while and found Jane safe in her room with Maria. They all went to dinner as eight bells struck. Initially, Jennie didn't want to eat but Maria insisted she should. They navigated the narrow passages to the dining area, struggling to stay steady due to the ship's motion. The dinner was like a hotel meal, but they had to be cautious with the sliding plates and glasses. Rollo learned to be careful after witnessing a mishap with a glass. The dinner had many courses and was sumptuous. By the second day at sea, Rollo and Jennie felt more comfortable on the ship, making friends with other passengers and enjoying their time on board.|['1.

The mirrors in the saloon created fascinating illusions, reflecting the room and its surroundings multiple times. Rollo, lying on the sofa, was captivated by the intricate effects. The reflections were so clear that it was hard to distinguish reality from the mirrored images. At times, Rollo saw figures in the reflections that seemed distant, only to realize they were nearby. On the second day of his voyage, feeling unwell, Rollo was visited by two loud young men. Despite his reluctance to engage, Maria and Jennie, understanding his discomfort, silently offered him chicken broth. Initially hesitant, Rollo found the broth delicious and felt much improved after finishing it. Maria's thoughtful gesture taught Rollo that sometimes, when people are unwell, actions speak louder than words.|"['1.

Rollo felt much improved after having some broth. He decided to go up on deck to get some fresh air. As he ascended the stairs, he found a lady lying on a settee in need of help. Remembering how Maria had helped him, Rollo fetched a bowl of chicken broth for the lady. She hesitated at first but then enjoyed it. The lady returned the empty bowl, thanking Rollo. Meanwhile, there was a boy on the ship who was known for his mischievous behavior with a bow and arrows. He was asked to stop shooting near the passengers and was directed to the forward deck.

Rollo was searching for Hilbert and eventually found him dining with his father in the ship's dining saloon. Hilbert was accompanied by his bows and arrows. Rollo did not hear their conversation and decided to leave, not wanting to be part of their dialogue. He felt conflicted about whether he should inform a lady onboard about finding Hilbert. Rollo believed he should report back since it was his duty, but he chose not to disclose the full truth to spare the lady distress over her son's behavior. After dinner, Hilbert went to the deck, leaving his belongings behind. Rollo and Jennie were hesitant about the situation but were interrupted by the ship's surgeon.

Jennie found the kitten napping on a sofa in the cabin. She grabbed the kitten, waking her abruptly, and swiftly took her to her cage. Jennie placed the kitten in the cage, secured the door, and carried the cage to her room. She placed the cage on a shelf in the berth, drew the curtains, and left the room, closing the door. The kitten, feeling bewildered in her solitude, settled down and fell back asleep. Meanwhile, Hilbert, eager to retrieve his bow and arrows to shoot a bird, found them missing. Sailors, led by Hargo, passed the items along and eventually tossed them overboard, where they were broken by the paddle wheel. Hilbert, enraged and confused, confronted Hargo and the sailors, but they all appeared innocent. Hilbert's father arrived, and Hilbert vented his frustration to him about the missing items.|"['1.

Hilbert's father led him to his state room on the opposite side of the cabin from Jennie's. The bird, feeling safe now that his enemies were confined, rested on the rigging coil until he regained strength. Jennie and Maria brought bread for him, which he happily ate. After a few hours, he started flying around and eventually flew off towards the coast. He rested a couple of times on the way, once on an English ship and then on a fishing boat. He safely reached Nova Scotia, reuniting with his mate. Meanwhile, Tiger and Hilbert were released from their rooms after two hours. Tiger slept through it, but Hilbert struggled with feelings of regret. The vastness of the Atlantic seen from a steamer can diminish the grandeur of a storm at sea due to the ship's height above the waves.|"['1.

On an Atlantic steamer, passengers walking on the deck experience a unique perspective above the waves. The height at which they stand varies during the voyage, always keeping their heads above the wave crests. This vantage point allows them to look down upon the massive seas, diminishing their apparent size. In contrast, sailors on small vessels like those of Columbus's time faced towering waves that seemed ready to overwhelm them. However, with modern mighty steamers, passengers are raised above apparent danger, triumphing over the seas in both strength and position. Unlike sailing ships at the mercy of storms, steamers power through, unaffected by the winds that once dictated their course, offering a stable and controlled journey even in the face of tempests.|"[""1.

Rollo's sleep on the ship was repeatedly disturbed by sudden lurches that tossed him around in his berth. As he tried to find ways to secure himself, he discovered a cord with knobs that helped him stay steady during rough seas. Despite his efforts to get some rest, a swinging door in his room kept banging back and forth with the ship's movements. Rollo decided to shut the door to stop the noise, but it kept coming loose due to the ship's rolling. After several attempts to find a comfortable position, he moved to the couch on the other side of the room. However, even there, he faced challenges with swinging cloaks and coats above him. After removing the items, Rollo finally settled down, hoping for a peaceful rest.|['1.

Late at night, Rollo heard a strange noise from Jennie's room. The ship's movement had caused her kitten's cage to roll around, making the kitten meow. Jennie was asleep, unaware of the chaos. Rollo, determined to help, navigated through the dimly lit room and secured the cage. Suddenly, a loud crash startled everyone. Water rushed into Rollo's room through a broken window.

Hilbert was brave and determined to go up to the promenade deck despite the storm. Rollo, on the other hand, struggled along the rolling ship's passage, finally finding shelter to gaze at the raging sea in awe. As he headed back to share his adventure with Jennie, he encountered a drenched and distressed Hilbert. Hilbert had faced a terrifying wave on the weather side of the ship, leaving him soaked and shaken. Meanwhile, on a calm morning a few days later, Rollo sat listening to conversations on the deck. The passengers were in high spirits, enjoying the smooth ride powered solely by the ship's engines.

The men on the ship discussed the rockets used to rescue sailors in distress at sea. Rockets with lines attached were fired from one ship to another or to shore during wrecks or storms. In these emergencies, sailors might be stranded on a wrecked vessel, clinging to the decks or rigging. To rescue them, a line was shot across using rockets. A small line attached to the rocket was aimed to fall over the distressed ship, allowing a stronger line to be drawn over. This line served as a bridge for sailors to escape, though it was perilous due to the rough seas. Meanwhile, on the deck, a conversation about a ship's lottery unfolded, with tickets priced at half a sovereign each. The lottery was linked to the ship's course reckoning, a vital navigational practice at sea to ensure safe arrival at the intended destination.|"[""1.

Navigators at sea use a special tool called a sextant to measure the distance between the sun and the southern horizon at noon. This is known as making an observation. The captain then uses this information to calculate the ship's latitude (north and south) and longitude (east and west). These calculations help determine the ship's exact location on a chart. Passengers eagerly await the captain's bulletin, which reveals how far the ship has traveled since the previous day. In cases where the sun is not visible due to clouds, another method involves using a log and line to measure the ship's progress through the water. The log, a floating board with a marked line, is thrown overboard, and the reel lets out the line as the ship moves. A minute glass is used to time the distance covered. This method helps determine the ship's progress even on cloudy days.|"[""1.

"Two men on a ship use a method called ""heaving the log"" to determine the ship's speed. One man holds the reel while the other helps him draw in the line. The knots on the line indicate the ship's speed in miles per hour. They don't count the knots but can identify the speed by the last knot's form and color. The captain records the speed reported by one of the men. It takes several men to pull in the line due to the friction in the water. The log is brought on board for calculation. By ""heaving the log"" every two hours, the captain can calculate the ship's distance and direction traveled. This method is called ""by the reckoning.""

When Hilbert returned to the paddle box with his half sovereign at around eleven o'clock, preparations were underway for an observation to be conducted at twelve. The men were organizing a lottery based on predicting the ship's distance traveled in the next twenty-four hours. Hilbert joined in by contributing his half sovereign to participate. The men, including one known as the Colonel, made twenty tickets representing the possible miles the ship might cover, ranging from 261 to 280. Amidst jokes and laughter, each participant drew a ticket from a hat, with Hilbert drawing number 67, representing 267 miles. The scene was lively with bargaining, betting, and excitement as the participants discussed and traded tickets, hoping to secure the winning one. Hilbert, optimistic about his choice, shared his enthusiasm with Rollo, while the Colonel offered to buy his ticket for a slightly higher price to avoid potential loss.|"[""1.

"The Colonel agreed, ""Alright, as you wish,"" and left. Hilbert turned down several offers that followed. After about fifteen minutes, the Colonel coincidentally encountered Hilbert again and discussed his ticket. The Colonel mentioned that tickets under 270 were selling cheap as many believed the ship's run would exceed that. Still, he offered to buy Hilbert's ticket for a pound to ensure a profit. Despite the interest in buying his ticket, Hilbert refused all offers, keeping it safe in his wallet. Selling the ticket was against his conscience, as he believed that participating in lotteries and betting was wrong. Hilbert felt it was a sin to engage in such activities.

Mr. Chauncy held his ticket and checked the number, hoping to win. He decided to give it away to an Irishwoman returning to Ireland. The woman was surprised but understood the lottery system. Rollo explained how to sell the ticket for two shillings. The Colonel and his accomplice had secret plans to manipulate the lottery by tracking the ship's progress.

The intricate plan was executed with precision by the two men, aiming to influence the ship's run perception. They managed to create a belief that the ship's run would be no less than 270. Despite securing ticket 268 at a high cost, their attempts to acquire tickets 267 and 266 failed. Another man, a former ship's mate, devised a clever scheme. He planned to eavesdrop on the captain and officers during the observation of the sun's altitude to predict the winning ticket. While the mate calculated the ship's run to be 266 miles, the Colonel estimated it at 267. Each planned to buy specific tickets to secure the prize, but their efforts to persuade Hilbert to sell his ticket were in vain.

"""No, that is not certain,"" said the captain. ""It may be only that the quantity of line that is out is sufficient to float the lead.

The ship's captain was engrossed in conversation with the children when he noticed a large ship sailing down the channel. He quickly rose to oversee a proper lookout to avoid a collision. The seas between England and Ireland are vast and well-marked with lighthouses, making pilots unnecessary for navigation. As the steamer approached the Mersey, passengers gathered on deck to witness the pilot boarding. A signal from a small boat indicated the pilot's arrival. The steamer altered its course to meet the pilot boat. The pilot boarded the ship, and the steamer resumed its journey. Passengers prepared to disembark in Liverpool. Jennie felt anxious, while Rollo was eager to go ashore independently. Plans were made for their arrival, including meeting family at a hotel and assistance from the captain.|"[""1.

Rollo, unaware of his father's plan, agreed to Mr. Chauncy's proposal. When the captain arrived, Rollo expressed gratitude for his kindness but explained he was accompanying Mr. Chauncy and Maria. Rollo was puzzled by the captain's words, but it was later clarified to him. The steamers not only carry passengers but also transport the mail. The mail includes letters and papers exchanged between countries and a special bag for the American minister in London, known as government despatches. This bag is entrusted to a reliable passenger known as the bearer of despatches. Upon reaching Liverpool, the steamers anchor in the stream, awaiting a small steamer to collect the mail and despatches for immediate transport to London. While the bearer of despatches and their family can go ashore with the despatch bag, other passengers must wait for custom inspections. On this particular night, Maria and the children stayed up, expecting to disembark with Mr. Chauncy during the night. When summoned at midnight, they hurried on deck, where their trunks were quickly checked by officials. The descent to the small steamer was steep and challenging, especially in the dark night, adding to the sense of adventure and anticipation.|"['1.

A sensible girl, knowing there was no real danger, summoned her courage to continue. Men below assisted her descent, and her brother helped from above. Mr. Chauncy, distracted by a missing bag, searched the slide. The steamer crew, unaware of children waiting, prepared to depart. Sailors confirmed finding the bag, prompting the crew to cast off.
