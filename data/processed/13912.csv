"""Bébée, a child with a pure soul and a trusting heart, found herself in a dilemma as her neighbors, though well-meaning, discussed what to do with the hut and garden left by old Antoine. Each neighbor, in their eagerness to help, had ulterior motives hidden beneath their offers of assistance.

The women criticized Bébée harshly, feeling she didn't belong, despite her being a foundling. Anger exposed their true feelings, and their hurtful words stung.

The flowers wilted, the neighbors avoided her, and she felt alone in her hut. Despite this, she remembered Antoine's kindness and resolved to live as he had taught her. The flowers seemed indifferent, and even during Antoine's funeral, they remained unchanged. Bébée prayed to unknown powers in a corner with a delf pot that Antoine had cared for.

Bébée let out a small cry and froze, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment. The tinker's wife, who was nearby, didn't hear her as she was preoccupied with her husband's smoldering clothes.

They arrived at the point where the road leads up to the king's summer palace. Towering beech and lime trees shaded them. A tall gray wall loomed ahead, adorned with blossoming fruit branches cascading over it. In a ditch, young lambs bleated beside their mothers in the long grass. To the left, fields of colza, beetroot, and trefoil stretched out, dotted with large forest trees and red mill-sails and gray church spires on the distant horizon. The sound of distant bells filled the air, ringing a melancholic Flemish carillon.

"Bébée, a young girl from a quaint Flemish village, pondered the meaning of a ""dog's heart"" as she carried her baskets through the lanes, brushing dew off her feet. She recalled a dog's loyalty to its cruel master, even in death, wondering if that was the essence of a dog's heart. Lost in thought, she left an old woman working on parchment and walked along the quay, contemplating the complexities of life. Meanwhile, a renowned artist from a distant land found solace in the serene Flemish life during a political exile. Entranced by the charm of Antwerpen, he marveled at the town's blend of ugliness and beauty, reminiscent of a precious jewel.

He looked at himself as if paying tribute to Rubens, whom he had previously ignored, never having visited Antwerp (for, unless you have been to Antwerp, it's as silly to claim you've seen Rubens as it is to believe you've seen Murillo outside Seville or Raffaelle outside Rome). He carefully studied Gretchen, loving Scheffer, but failed to connect with her. His paintings were all about Phryne, in various settings and emotions, but always Phryne. One evening, pondering whether to paint in the historic Brabant street or seek new inspiration in the East, he saw a simple peasant passing by with a radiant face. He realized that there are women who repel evil, unlike Phryne. Despite this, he knew the inevitable outcome when the strong overpower the weak. Bébée, eager to help, wanted to pray for him but needed his name for Our Lady to understand.

His name appeared on a door ahead. A bell's handle dangled; she pulled it hesitantly. The door opened; she found no one, and entered. Dim lights flickered. Unfamiliar heavy scents filled the air. Old armor, weapons, and paintings created a mysterious atmosphere in the rich rooms. Her wooden shoes' noise vanished in the plush carpets. The room seemed like a dream. She saw him on the bed, laughing and playing cards. Women with flowing hair and jewels, and men gambling and drinking, filled the room. By his bed, a beautiful but sinister figure leaned over him. Startled, she dropped the rosebuds, turned, and fled. He noticed her, pushed the figure away, and cursed. She ran through the chambers and stairs, escaping to the bright streets. He had followed her to Paris, found her, and silently took her back to Brabant. She sat silently, looking frightened. Once home, she remained silent and bewildered until her pet bird greeted her. The women who undressed her regretted their past coldness. They laid her down, opened the shutters, and saw her vacant eyes and closed mouth. Remorseful, they recognized her as the lively Bébée who had brought joy to their lives.|['1.

The rooster crowed happily as the sun rose. The lamb bleated in the field, and bees buzzed around the pear-tree flowers. Lavender swayed in the breeze, casting shadows on the floor. People who cared for her came from the city, including the cobbler, tinman, and a woman who sold saints' pictures. The Varnhart children were scared and crying. Night came, and Mère Krebs watched over her. Jeannot prayed at the old church, while villagers gathered sadly, eventually returning home. The starling was awake as she sat in her home, feeling a deep ache. She kissed a rosebud and placed it gently in a shoe. She rose, feeling a heavy weight on her head, and walked out into the night, not recognizing her surroundings. The night air brushed against her, but she felt lost and confused, running towards the water with a sense of despair.|['1.
