In the far East, Alexander discovered a land unknown to him. The people there lived in peace, rich yet humble. When seated for a meal, servants brought forth what appeared to be fruits and cakes, all made of gold. A man explained how he found a treasure on land he bought, offering it to his neighbor who refused. Meanwhile, Aristomenes chased a fox through a narrow passage, where light shone at the end. He widened the way to escape and found himself free under the open sky. In another tale, a bomb interrupted an officer's writing, causing fear.

Robert had a clever idea. He attached a makeshift oarlock to the boat's stern and rigged a paddle to it. One boy could steer the boat with the paddle while the other turned the paddle wheels.

In ancient times, an abbey served as both a church and a fortress, offering refuge to the kind and the vulnerable during times of conflict. As the wind howled outside, the men huddled by the fire in the abbey, grateful for the safety it provided from the storm. The master woodman suggested singing to lift their spirits. Each man took a turn singing about their passions - the forest, fields, and sheep. However, Caedmon, the cowherd, felt anxious as he didn't know any songs and believed his voice was unpleasant. He slipped away to the cattle sheds to rest. In a dream, a beautiful figure encouraged Caedmon to sing.
