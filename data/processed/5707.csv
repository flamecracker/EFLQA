"""I'd be upset, Dick,"" he said, at last, ""if that wasn't so typically English--and amusing! However, I guess that's one reason why you British are such a vast empire.

That's what they used to call him at school, you know, before he even joined the army. And it stuck with him, they say, all the way through. Even after Mafeking, he was still called that.

Harry and Dick were discussing the importance of being prepared for challenges. Harry explained that even though the Boy Scouts don't go to war, the skills they learn help them be ready for anything. He compared it to organizing a regiment, asking Dick if he would prefer a thousand brave men with no camping experience or a thousand Boy Scouts who knew half of what soldiers need to learn. This made Dick realize the value of being prepared and how many people join groups like the Territorials after school to stay ready. Their scoutmaster, John Grenfel, joined the conversation, emphasizing the importance of friendship and preparation in the Scout movement. He highlighted the difference in military training between countries and how being prepared is essential for defending the country.|['1.

""I pray not,"" said Grenfel. ""But we don't know, Fleming. For the last few years--ever since the trouble in the Balkans finally flamed up--Europe has been on the brink of a volcano.

A gathering at Grenfel's home hinted at the uncertainty ahead. The boys sensed change in the air, pondering the impact of war on their lives and England's future.

As Harry entered, he noticed many young men playing tennis in the square. It was still bright outside, unlike the dusk back home. In England at the end of July and the beginning of August, daylight lasted until around ten o'clock. This long daylight was one of the things Harry appreciated about living in England. He enjoyed the extended evenings for sports and exercise after school. Harry and his friend Dick attended a nearby school, where some boys boarded while others, like them, did not. With summer holidays starting, the boys gathered at Grenfel's house. The scout-master, Grenfel, gathered the boys in his garden and shared news of Germany declaring war on Russia. Grenfel might have to leave for foreign service, prompting a serious discussion about the ongoing conflict.|"['1.

"""Yes, most likely,"" Grenfel stated. ""Germany's best chance to attack France is through Belgium, making the situation very serious. England's interest lies in self-defense. Imagine owning a house next to one on fire; you'd try to put out the fire to save your home. England sees itself in a similar position. If Germany controls Belgium or Holland, England faces danger. If war breaks out, it will be to stop the German threat. It's important to remember that Germans have their reasons, even if we disagree. Both sides may have valid perspectives.

"""I mean exactly that,"" said Grenfel. ""We don't know this--we can't be sure of it. But we've got good reason to believe that there are a great many Germans here, seemingly peaceable enough, who are regularly in the pay of the German government as spies. We don't know the German plans. But there is no reason, so far as we know, why their great Zeppelin airships shouldn't come sailing over England, to drop bombs down where they can do the most harm. There is nothing except our own vigilance to keep these spies, even if they have to work alone, from doing untold damage!""

""We could be useful as sentries, then?"" said Leslie Franklin. He drew a deep breath. ""I never thought of things like that, sir! I'm just beginning to see how useful we really might be. We could do a lot of things instead of soldiers, couldn't we? So that they would be free to go and fight?""

""Yes,"" answered the scoutmaster. ""And I can tell you now that the National Scout Council has always planned to 'Be Prepared!' It decided, a long time ago, what should be done in case of war.

As we face uncertain times, we may need to focus on important tasks ahead instead of playing games. If a war arises, there will be vital work to do, just as crucial as if we were in the battlefield fighting for our country. Not everyone can fight, but those who stay behind and fulfill their duties will serve their nation with the same loyalty. Let's prepare for what may come! Three cheers for King George!

As Harry marched alongside others, he couldn't help but notice a significant change in the streets. Union Jack flags adorned every house, swaying gently in the night air. The sight was unforgettable, signaling a nation readying for war, not at the command of a few, but demanded by the people themselves. The spirit of England was awakening, shedding its usual indifference. In a quiet London suburb, the stirring of England's soul was evident. Suddenly, the scouts' song was drowned by a menacing noise. Rushing towards it, they found a crowd trying to break into a shop in a poorer area. Franklin, the leader, called the scouts to action to protect the shop from the unruly mob.

"""No, it wouldn't,"" said Harry seriously. ""Don't start feeling that way, Dick. Imagine living in Berlin. You wouldn't want German troublemakers destroying your home or business and treating you like that, would you?""

""I guess not,"" replied Dick. ""I never thought about it that way! But I think Mr. Grenfel was right. London is full of spies. Isn't that scary, Harry? You can't tell who's a spy and who isn't!""

He felt grateful that America was not currently facing the imminent threat of conflict. The idea of war was both exhilarating and terrifying. Harry pondered how many of his fellow scouts and schoolmates might lose family members in the brewing war. Despite the allure of war, the lesson of peace seemed more valuable. Grenfel had left, and a new scoutmaster, Francis Wharton, took charge. Despite physical limitations from the Boer War, Mr. Wharton was eager to contribute to the war effort through the scouts. He expressed confidence in the scouts' ability to support him and the Empire during these challenging times.|"['1.

Ernest Graves, a scout in the patrol with Harry and Dick, believed he should be a leader despite his lack of popularity due to his pushy nature. As they awaited orders, the scoutmaster instructed them to head to Ealing by rail. Dick defended Ernest when accusations arose, and they set off towards the West Kensington station. In their khaki uniforms, they received admiring smiles from passersby appreciative of the Scouts' service during wartime. At the station, they were informed that uniformed individuals rode for free. Dick shared that Ernest studied engineering at the Polytechnic and boarded with Mrs. Johnson. Despite his skills, Ernest's disinterest in cricket puzzled his peers.|"['1.

As the train approached, soldiers in uniform peered out of the windows. Some chuckled at the sight of the scouts' attire, but most smiled warmly. Rushing into a first-class compartment, the scouts found two young officers conversing. One officer, intrigued by the scouts' serious demeanor, inquired about their troop and patrol. He then offered them a ride to Ealing Barracks, revealing they had just bid farewell to someone dear. The train arrived at Ealing station, bustling with soldiers and war preparations. A sentry questioned civilians, hinting at the town's martial law. Outside, the military presence was even more pronounced, with troops and vehicles everywhere.

"In a short while, they arrived at the large barracks. The hustle and bustle seen at the station were absent here. Everything was quiet. A sentry stopped them, and Harry requested to see the officer of the guard. After a brief wait outside, the officer returned, ushered them in, and handed them over to an orderly. They were led to a room where Colonel Throckmorton, overseeing important matters, greeted them with a stern look. ""I will have messages for you to deliver,"" the colonel began.

When they boarded the train at Ealing, they were fortunate to find an empty compartment as more people were arriving than leaving. Dick marveled aloud about the number of travelers and speculated on the command of the troops. Harry whispered about the importance of being cautious as they carried similar papers. They both understood the need for secrecy and met without any trouble at the station. The atmosphere was tense with war preparations evident, soldiers boarding trains discreetly. Major French, a busy and weary man, received their papers, signed receipts, and expressed concern momentarily. The boys grasped the seriousness of the situation as trains departed silently with whitewashed windows, concealing the soldiers inside. Despite the lack of cheers, they comprehended the need for caution in these uncertain times.|"['1.

As the cab journeyed through a quiet suburban area, Harry noticed strange signals being sent through flashes of light, like Morse code. He whispered to Dick to act normal and keep alert. Suddenly, the cab halted with a blown tire outside a mysterious house where the signals originated. The driver, visibly concerned, began fixing the tire. Harry observed a clean cut causing the blowout, not typical of road debris. Before he could investigate further, a young man in a British army uniform approached, noting their Scout attire and questioning if they had orders for troop movements.

Harry suggested waiting until dark to avoid alerting the locals. The boys explored the estate, Bray Park, on their motorcycles, noting the old grey house standing tall amidst the trees. Harry believed this discovery could be the key to unraveling the mystery they were investigating. To ensure their safety, Harry wrote a coded letter to Colonel Throckmorton and buried their credentials and codes before venturing into the estate, prepared for any unforeseen challenges.|"['1.

Crossing the wall proved easy. They expected broken glass on top but found none. Inside, they realized why no precautions were taken. They narrowly avoided being caught by armed guards doing rounds. Harry timed their movements, noting the guard's intervals. They planned their escape, understanding the need to secure a retreat before advancing. Moving cautiously, they avoided traps and reached a vantage point near the house. Despite the tension, they pressed forward, sensing the looming danger.

At the edge of the dense, ancient trees surrounding the area, Harry and Dick paused. They stood facing the open lawn, realizing the risk of crossing it. Opting to stay hidden, Harry whispered to Dick, pointing out wires near a tower. Dick, with his exceptional night vision, confirmed their presence. As they observed, a collapsible wireless installation was being set up. Harry recognized the setup and the urgency to leave.

As they journeyed back through the forest, a sense of danger loomed. Suddenly, Harry fell into a trap, his ankle caught, and his friends urged him to hurry and inform others about their situation. Despite feeling afraid, Dick bravely headed towards the wall alone, realizing the need to act swiftly. He understood the risks involved, knowing that every step could trigger an alarm. As he cautiously approached the wall, he heard approaching footsteps and hid behind a bush, narrowly avoiding detection.

One of the men with flashlights cried out, sounding like a dog catching a scent. The lights shone on the ground where they crossed the wall. Dick held his breath, hoping they wouldn't find him. As they followed the footsteps, Dick knew they'd discover he was hiding between them and the wall. He took a chance, using his agility to escape. When they passed, he made a noise, darted through a bush, and climbed over the wall just as a shot rang out. Unhurt, he ran, reaching a stream where he refreshed himself. Escaping pursuit, he relied on his scout training to navigate the unfamiliar terrain and avoid Bray Park, where important items were hidden.

Dick, a seasoned scout, relied on his instincts honed over two years of training. Despite the confusion caused by being chased, he carefully retraced his steps to locate their cache. Fearing pursuit, he avoided Bray Park and the nearby village, where strangers were viewed with suspicion, especially during wartime. The urgency to inform Colonel Throckmorton about the powerful wireless station drove Dick to navigate cautiously. Eventually, using the stars as his guide, he found the cache empty. The disappearance of the motorcycles and papers left him stunned. Just days ago, Harry and his friend Dick had embarked on a mission that uncovered a secret heliograph operation. Now, alone and injured, Harry pondered the events that had unfolded in such a short time, from bidding farewell to his scoutmaster to facing perilous situations.|"['1.

He listened carefully as the searchers approached, their flashlights giving away their position. Despite the pain in his ankle from the trap, he remained silent, fearing capture. He knew the searchers would follow footprints to find him and Dick. Just as he felt trapped, Dick made a daring escape, climbing the wall. Harry winced in pain as he heard the bullets fired after Dick. The commotion outside gave Harry a temporary reprieve. He cautiously checked his ankle with a flashlight, realizing escape was unlikely.

"""That's what I want to know about you, first,"" said the other boy - for it was another boy, as Harry learned from his voice. Never had a sound been more welcome in his ears than that voice. ""Tell me who you are and what you two were doing around here. I saw you this afternoon and tracked you. I tried to before, but I couldn't, on account of your motorcycles. Then I just happened to see you when you were on foot. Are you Boy Scouts?""

""If they give us two or three minutes, we'll both get out,"" said the newcomer confidently. ""I know this place with my eyes shut. I used to play here before the old family moved away.

Harry gave it to him, and the other scout bent over his ankle. Harry saw that he had a long, slender piece of wire. He guessed that he was going to try to pick the lock. And in a minute or less, Harry heard a welcome click that told him his newfound friend - a friend in need, indeed - had succeeded. His ankle was free.

He struggled to his feet, and there was a moment of exquisite pain as the blood rushed through his ankle, and circulation was restored to his numbed foot. But he was able to stand, and,"|"[""1.

Jack explained the situation to his friend Harry, who had ridden off on his motorcycle to chase after Ernest Graves. Harry and Jack had encountered an unfamiliar person meddling with their motorcycles. Harry immediately assumed it was their friend, but it turned out to be Graves, a larger and older member of their troop who felt entitled to special assignments. Graves, unhappy with Harry and Jack's selection, stirred up trouble by insinuating that it was risky to choose non-English members like Harry for important tasks.

The elderly man was adamant, feeling insulted by any doubt cast upon him. He vividly remembered seeing the machine, a large grey car with black stripes, much like all their automobiles. The man shared how the driver had come from London, observed them on their bicycles, and had an American flag on the car. This detail led the boys to realize how they were being watched. Despite Harry's chase being halted due to over-speeding and his subsequent arrest, he found himself in a comfortable cell for the night. The sleepy inspector advised him to wait to explain his situation to the magistrate in the morning, emphasizing the importance of obeying the law and the need for rest at his age.

Harry smiled and thanked the officer but had no plans to sleep. He didn't even change out of his clothes, only using the washstand in the room. He felt hungry but knew he had no immediate access to food. Despite having emergency rations in his motorcycle, which was impounded for the night, he couldn't reach them.

Straight ahead, above the rooftops, a shimmer caught his eye. It was a reservoir, likely supplying water to a large area. Suddenly, a flash illuminated the sky, followed by a massive column of water shooting up and crashing down like a storm. A deafening roar ensued. The water vanished, and it dawned on him - the reservoir had been destroyed! This posed a grave threat, not just from the loss of water but the imminent flooding of the nearby streets. Knowing the reservoirs in England were elevated, he sprang into action, alerting others as he dashed towards safety. Ignoring the chaos, he headed for London, aiding a broken-down lorry en route. The driver welcomed him aboard, joking about his mundane cargo amidst the wartime uncertainty. Harry sensed that conflict loomed, even for those not seeking it, as regular troops prepared for imminent deployment.|"[""1.

"The soldier was surprised by the news, exclaiming, ""Bli'me! What will those Germans do next? Coming to England and causing trouble like that! I'd have the law on them!"" Jack and Dick arrived at the vicarage around the same time Harry got into trouble for speeding. The vicar, still awake reading late, was surprised to find Jack not in bed. Initially angry, his mood softened upon hearing their story. The boys were hungry and dirty, enjoying sandwiches and milk. They explained their discovery of potential German spies at Bray Park.

"""Yes, but who will handle this?"" he asked. ""We only have one constable in Bray. If there are many Germans there, what can he do? Maybe we should contact Harobridge and request police or territorials. Yes, that's the best plan."" Dick then suggested, ""What if we inform Colonel Throckmorton directly?

Dick seemed ready to object, but a look from Jack stopped him. Instead, he bid goodnight and joined Jack upstairs. He opted for a cold bath, anticipating their upcoming adventure. Jack confirmed they were heading out, with a plan to investigate a cut telephone wire. Sneaking out was tricky, but Jack, eager for the thrill, mapped a route. Escaping via the scullery roof into the garden, they evaded detection. Following the wire quietly, they noticed a sag, indicating a nearby break.

Two linemen found a cut wire in a blackberry row. They crept through a gap in the hedge, tearing their clothes. Jack wondered why the linemen were there at night. They must have come a long way, possibly on bicycles. The linemen were repairing the wire after someone tried to send a message to Bray. Jack suspected Harry tried to telephone. Harry, giving up on catching Graves directly, sent a coded telegraph to Colonel Throckmorton. Harry also tried to call Jack's house but found the line cut. Boy Scouts guarding a gas works helped Harry get the wire repaired. The patrol leader, Burridge, knew Graves from a previous scout outing and thought highly of him.

Harry rode swiftly as dawn approached. The eastern sky glowed crimson, hinting at rain. Undeterred, Harry welcomed the leaden skies at Bray Park for the impending work. Puzzling over the German spies' risky endeavors, he questioned the value of their obtained British military information. Contemplating a potential German invasion, Harry realized the strategic importance of knowing British troop locations and destinations. Observing English army planes flying nearby, Harry's mind raced with possibilities. He envisioned Bray Park as a hub for directing aerial attacks on key English infrastructure. This unconventional warfare, devoid of traditional battles, involved surprise bombings on critical sites.

Harry was troubled by the unfairness of the situation. He believed in the honor of warfare, but the underhanded tactics he witnessed felt deceitful. As the truck entered London, the dawn broke, signaling a new day. Exhausted but determined, Harry pressed on to deliver his report. Suddenly, he spotted Graves on a bicycle, who revealed he had incriminating evidence against a suspected spy. Despite Harry's pleas, the lieutenant remained indifferent, focused on following orders.

They were so engrossed in each other and the cut wire that they didn't notice a silent grey motor car approaching without lights. Dick and Jack realized it was one of Bray Park's cars, making Dick's escape futile. Jack, who was thought to be captured, had actually slipped away unnoticed. In the darkness, Dick saw Jack's clever escape through a hole in the hedge. The car's headlight revealed armed men, including a bold German who didn't hide his identity.

Harry was fortunate once more in his efforts. He dialed the vicarage number at Bray, only to face another interruption at the nearby telephone center. However, this time he was requested to wait, and shortly after, he heard Jack Young's voice on the line. Securing a motor car proved challenging, as many had been requisitioned by the government. Yet, recalling an American business friend of his father's who owned one, Harry managed to borrow it. Known for his careful driving skills, Harry had practiced with his father's car, a fact Mr. Armstrong was aware of. With a reputation for honesty established, Mr. Armstrong agreed to lend the car upon hearing of the urgency. Evading possible pursuers, Harry's change of attire aided in altering his appearance as he neared Bray and reunited with his friends, who shared alarming discoveries about an impending event at Bray Park.|"['1.

Dick shared with Harry the mysterious references he had overheard about Von Wedel and plans to target the barracks at Ealing and Houndsditch. Harry, being resourceful, took detailed notes of the names mentioned by Dick and retrieved Morse signs they had observed being heliographed. Harry explained to Jack the two main types of codes, one saving words by representing phrases with single words, and the other involving letter changes and various tricks. Harry believed the code they were deciphering relied on inversions. They decided to match the names Dick heard with words of similar length in the message to decode it. After a challenging hour, Harry exclaimed in realization that Von Wedel, a commander, was planning a raid on the mentioned locations. Harry speculated on how Von Wedel, needing petrol, would execute the attack without naval or troop support.|['1.

"""Yes, in one of their large Zeppelins!"" exclaimed Harry. ""I assume she has been flying near the coast. She has also acted as a wireless relay station. The base here at Bray Park could communicate with her, and she could transmit the message further across the North Sea, to Helgoland or Wilhelmshaven. She has waited until everything was prepared.""

""Yes. They could be on rooftops, concealed from view except from above. They would be in specific fixed positions, and the Zeppelin crew would be able to calculate their target, dropping bombs a certain number of degrees to the left or right of the red marking lights.""

""I don't know yet, but we'll need to devise a plan. It would be awful to be aware of the plot and still be unable to prevent it! I wish I knew where Graves was. I'd like to...""

Contrasting the peaceful surroundings with the horrors of war, the idea of attacking unprepared civilians seemed more dreadful to Harry. While he understood the concept of war, the deliberate targeting of non-combatants troubled him. Suddenly, the buzzing of bees was overshadowed by a larger sound, a descending airplane with dun-colored wings. Harry and Dick observed the aircraft, speculating on its purpose and the pilot's actions. Despite the aviator's threats, the boys swiftly captured and restrained him, noting the possibility of impersonation due to the plane's make. The aviator, surprised by the attack, was no match for the determined boys, who remained focused on their capture, indifferent to his threats.|"['1.

Harry found a loose end of rope from a knot and led the angry German to the car, resembling a dog. Despite the humor, it was a serious situation. Harry planned to siphon the gas into a bucket from the tank. The German was secured in the car, preventing escape. Harry saw a way to outsmart the Germans and stop their harmful plans. He prepared the Bleriot plane, a new safety model, for a risky but necessary mission. Harry decided to take action to prevent the Zeppelin from causing harm. Jack had a role to play in informing others, as there was only space for two in the plane. Despite initial disappointment, Jack and Dick listened to Harry's plan with amazement and readiness to help.|"['1.

"""There's no use going up much before eleven o'clock,"" said Harry. ""Before that we'd be seen, and, besides, if a Zeppelin is coming, it wouldn't be until after that. My plan is to scout to the east and try to pick her up and watch her descend. I think I know just about where she'll land--the only place where there's room enough for her. And then-"" ""I imagine she'll have about a hundred and twenty miles to travel in a straight line--perhaps a little less,"" said Harry. ""She can make that in about two hours, or less. Big as they are, those airships are painted so that they're almost invisible from below. So if she comes by night, getting here won't be as hard a job as it seems at first thought."" ""I can't think of anything else that we can provide for now,"" said Harry, at last. ""Of course, we can't tell what will come up, and it would be wonderful if everything came out just as we have planned. But we've provided for everything we can think of. You know where you are to be, Jack?"" A little later Jack said good-bye in earnest, and then there was nothing to do but wait.
