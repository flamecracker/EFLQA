"Cub enthusiastically exclaimed, ""That's a fantastic idea!"" He proposed setting up a new radio aerial on the island using spare wire and insulators from the boat, allowing them to switch the radio between the island and the boat. Working efficiently with tools and materials, they constructed a two-wire antenna with spreaders and insulators placed high in the trees to avoid interference. As dusk approached, they used flashlights to continue their work. By nightfall, the radio was set up under the aerial, and Hal tuned in to a Rochester station, enjoying the music in the wilderness setting. Hal then received a surprising message from a Canadian amateur, revealing a plot against his cousin.

Cub expressed his admiration for his father's mathematical skills, stating that his father could even prove that water runs uphill using math. Mr. Perry advised them not to look too far ahead and to focus on the steps they are currently taking. Hal then tried to contact an amateur radio operator for help in locating Friday Island, where they believed Alvin, a friend in trouble, was being held. After several attempts, they finally reached a helpful operator in Port Hope who informed them that Alvin's situation was serious.

Bud firmly declined the idea of switching tasks with his friend, insisting on sticking to his commitment. He quickly completed his chore and returned to the radio table. Bud encouraged his companion to keep trying while he went to check the fishing spot. Hal agreed to call if he found anything interesting. Bud soon returned with unsettling news about some suspicious men near their fishing spot. He overheard their plans to scare them away.

Bud assured the group that they did not want anything that did not belong to them and were willing to leave if the island belonged to the men. Hal suggested using their radio to call friends for help. Max Handy, a Canadian youth, listened in on the radio conversation and followed the events closely. He was eager to help in the rescue mission. Max stayed up late hoping for more updates but eventually gave up. The next morning, he missed Hal's call for assistance due to oversleeping.

After a satisfying supper, the boys cleaned up while the men continued questioning the prisoner. Despite his stubbornness, the man's story began to unravel when asked about his business. A quick response about butter prices led to a revelation that exposed his lies. Mr. Baker, realizing the deceit, uncovered the man's fabricated tale about an international boundary line.

""Give me the one just before Bud's,"" Hal continued. ""There might be something happening between now and then. If anyone invades the camp at 1:30 sharp, I'll wake Bud and go to bed, letting him handle the intruders.""

""No chance,"" replied the cautious adult, shaking his head. ""I'd rather risk bandits than the chance of accidental harm. If you notice anything suspicious, call me, and I'll handle it. You can arm yourselves with clubs if you wish.""

For nearly thirty minutes, Bud kept watch on a shadowy spot near the tent. The moon was up, casting dim light. He noticed movement in the shadows, possibly a large animal or a person.

The boy quickly assembled his hand-catapult, testing its strength with rubber bands. Gathering stones for ammunition, he noticed movement in the shadows nearby. Prepared to defend against potential threats, he hesitated at the thought of causing harm. Spotting a figure near the tent, he readied his weapon cautiously.

Bud and Max were discussing their adventure when they noticed a spy creeping up behind their tent. Bud, without hesitation, used his slingshot to stop the intruder. The stone hit the spy, causing him to cry out in pain. Hal and Cub joined them, ready for action in their day clothes. Together, they illuminated the spy with their searchlights. It turned out the injured spy was a boy. The campers, including Mr. Perry, were surprised by this discovery. Despite the spy's injuries, the campers knew how to handle the situation due to their first aid training. The injured boy was placed on a cot, and the campers were more curious about his presence than his wounds.|['1.

Accordingly, the wound was checked and found to be a severe bruise on the right hip. Bud's shot hit the intruder where there was little flesh, right on a bony ridge, indicating it was a painful blow. Mr. Perry assessed the wound and applied liniment, advising rest for a few days. Concerned, Bud noted the lack of a broken skin, suggesting a possible bone fracture. Mr. Perry, cautious due to the pain, refrained from rubbing the liniment. The captive, defiant, refused to disclose his identity. Mr. Perry hinted at involving the boy's father, who was on the boat, demanding the location of the missing boy. The prisoner, terrified, finally relented, fearing the consequences.|"[""1.

"""Oh, yes, I did, my youthful minus quality,"" his father recalled. ""I multiplied my wrath very righteously, and this fellow is going to have his woes multiplied and his joys subtracted and his peace of mind divided into a thousand more pieces if he doesn't get busy on the square and see to it that young Alvin Baker is returned to his father.""

""He isn't hurt nearly as bad as he pretends to be, Mr. Perry,"" Hal added. ""He moved his leg several times. You better watch out or he'll be jumping up and making a dash for liberty.""

""I'd been noticing that,"" Mr. Perry replied.

The Catwhisker smoothly left the narrow inlet without any trouble from the hostile men on Friday Island. It was unclear if the islanders noticed their departure. The group sailed cautiously, avoiding any potential danger. They found a safe spot to moor the yacht for the night, ensuring everyone's safety.
