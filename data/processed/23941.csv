In this book, my aim has been to inspire young minds to seek knowledge independently. I want to show that nature walks can be both fascinating and educational for those who observe keenly. While some words might be challenging, with a little help from parents or teachers, children aged nine or ten can understand most of it. Today is perfect for a field trip. The birds are chirping, lambs are playing, and the sun is shining. Let's take a break from lessons and explore. Willy is excited and prepared with his net, ready to discover something intriguing. We can head to the moors where Jack hopes to find a peewit's nest. As we walk, we might encounter sand-martins soaring swiftly, a sign of spring. Let's sit and talk about the different swallow species that visit us from Africa each year. It's a delightful day for an adventure!|"['1.

Willy was fascinated by a strange insect crawling at the bottom of a drain. His father identified it as a water-scorpion, a common sight in drains on moors and everywhere. They decided to catch it for examination. The water-scorpion had a small head, pointed beak, lobster-like forearms, and a flat body ending in stick-like projections. Its color was blackish-brown, matching the mud it crawled on. The creature was an aquatic predator, using its beak to suck out the juices of its prey. The tail projections helped it breathe. After observing the water-scorpion, they headed home from their walk, planning their next adventure along the canal bank to the aqueduct and back through Lubstree Park. They discussed the beauty of green jelly balls in the canal and the microscopic world of infusoria living within them. Willy then spotted a black-headed Bunting, also known as a Reed Sparrow, flying to the hedge. His father explained the bird's features and nesting habits, distinguishing it from the reed-warbler.|"['1. What did Willy and his father find fascinating in the drain?\nA. A butterfly\nB.

"We peered into the canal and spotted many tiny whirligig beetles twirling on the water's surface. It's incredible how swiftly they glide! Some dive beneath, others rest on leaves. If we catch one and inspect closely, it resembles a miniature boat. It's surprising how these ""whirligigs"" dance so closely without colliding. Their eyes are split into two parts; one gazes at the sky, the other into the water. When we stay still, they rest, but once we move, they dart off. They use their upper eyes to spot us and the lower to avoid enemies like fish. Jack fished out a freshwater mussel, a fine specimen. These mollusks carry countless eggs in their gills. The young ones, with triangular shells, cling to fish fins. May wishes for pearl mussels in the canal, but finding pearls is rare and harmful to these creatures."|"['1.

In the countryside, we often spot charming little birds like the long-tailed titmouse. They flit about the hedges and poplar trees, adding life to the landscape. In Great Britain, we find several members of the titmouse family. There's the great tit, blue-tit, long-tailed tit, cole tit, marsh tit, crested tit, and bearded tit. While the crested and bearded tit are rare, the others are quite common. The long-tailed tit, with its distinctive long tail feathers, is a lively bird, constantly on the move. These birds feed on insects and their larvae, flitting from branch to branch in search of food. The blue-tit, known for its beautiful nest and hissing warning, is another common and active bird found in various habitats. Both these titmice play a vital role in controlling insect populations, making them valuable members of the ecosystem.|['1.

"A short educational passage suitable for middle school students:

A little verse to remember: ""Oh, look at his jaws, how wide he opens them!"" We have captured a dyticus larva, a creature with a long body like a shrimp. This larva suspends itself with bristly tails at the top of the water. They feed on other water insects but can't harm fish. When it's time to change into a pupa, the larva makes a hole in the pond bank and transforms into a beetle in about three weeks. Willy asks about beetles similar to water-beetles, known as _Colymbetes_, _Acilius_, _Cybister_. Then, they spot a weasel hunting. Weasels are agile creatures that hunt small animals like mice, moles, and birds. They are beneficial in controlling pests like rats and mice in grain ricks. Some farmers in Wales appreciate weasels for their role in pest control."|['1. What is the main focus of the passage?\nA) Water insects\nB) Weasels\nC) Dyticus larva\nD) Wales\nE) Willy', '2.

Let's take this home, with the nest and eggs inside. The nest, made of grass roots and weeds, now shapeless out of water. See the pinkish eggs with two specks in each for the fish's eyes. Notice the tiny things jerking their tails. Parents care for their young after hatching. A male stickleback showed anxiety for its young. It would retrieve truant young ones back to the nest. Sticklebacks are bold and fight enemies. Once, sticklebacks tormented a pike in an aquarium. Other fish, like the salt-water Lumpsucker, also care for their young. Jack found a snail-leech incubating eggs underwater. The snail-leech carries its young attached to its body. Leeches used for bleeding were once common in England but are now imported.|"['1.

"In Spring, blue speedwell and delicate stitchwort bloom in hedgerows. Our ancestors called stitchwort ""all-bones,"" linking its name to its use for ""stitches"" in the side. Calder Campbell's lines celebrate Spring flowers like the daisy, buttercup, and primrose. Adding marsh marigold, copper beech, and lilac to a wildflower cluster creates a beautiful bouquet. Tadpoles found in a ditch are likely from frogs or toads. Tadpoles breathe through gills, then grow legs and lose gills to become frogs. French people eat a different frog species than the common one. A domesticated frog once lived in an English kitchen, befriending a cat and enjoying the warmth by the fire."|"['1.

Frogs and toads are beneficial creatures that help control the population of harmful insects and slugs without causing harm. Unfortunately, some people mistakenly believe they harm gardens and try to kill them. Willy learns about the importance of frogs and toads from his father, who also introduces him to the microscopic animal called Melicerta. They set out to find these creatures in the water by collecting samples of water-buttercup plants where Melicerta can be found. Despite not finding any Melicerta immediately, Willy's father explains their unique features and assures they will observe them under a microscope at home. The passage highlights the value of these small creatures and the beauty of nature that can be discovered through exploration.|"[""1.

One creature that fascinated me is the Melicerta, a tiny but complex animal that builds its own intricate tower-like structure. Melicerta unfolds four flower-like expansions with cilia that move rapidly to create currents for food and house-building materials. It's like a skilled brick-maker, mason, and architect all in one. The creature's mouth, jaws, teeth, stomach, and intestine form a complex structure within its small body. Melicerta uses cilia to gather clay and mud particles, forming round pellets to build its tube. It's a fascinating process to watch, and with a microscope, you can see the intricate details of this tiny architect at work. Additionally, the sweet songs of birds like the sedge-warbler and the distinctive call of the cuckoo add melody to nature's symphony, making the outdoors a delightful place to explore.|"['1.

"May asked her father about the female cuckoo's voice, as she had never heard it. Mr. Jenyns described it as a chattering cry, fast and clear. Cuckoos have curious habits; they do not pair and lay eggs in other birds' nests. The larger cuckoo often displaces the smaller birds in the nest, leading to their ejection. The young cuckoo is left as the sole occupant, receiving all the food. They do not build nests due to laying eggs at intervals. Cuckoos arrive in mid-April, with males coming first. The eggs hatch in late May, and the young birds leave the nest in June, requiring further feeding. The parent birds leave by July, while young ones stay longer. The phrase ""Come August, go he must"" suggests the cuckoos' early departure."|"[""1.

"Willy inquired, ""How does the cuckoo's egg end up in nests too small for the cuckoo to lay it in?"" His father explained, ""The cuckoo lays her egg on the ground and carries it to other birds' nests in her bill."" Jack then pointed out a strange plant on the grass and asked about it. His father identified it as a horse-tail, noting its jointed stem and hollow structure. He mentioned the dust-like fruit at the top, containing spores with elastic threads. The plant's stems, used for polishing due to silex content, grow in moist areas. Later, they attempted to catch Hydras, tiny creatures with fishing-line-like projections around their mouths, using duckweed. These fascinating creatures can regenerate from cut parts and even be turned inside out, as described by a naturalist named Trembley."|"[""1.

The pain from a nettle sting can be relieved by rubbing the affected area with a dock leaf, but it may not always work. Nettles and dead nettles look different; the flowers of real nettles are small and green, while dead nettles have red, white, and yellow flowers. Although they look similar, dead nettles belong to a different plant family called the Labiate tribe. The sting of a nettle is fascinating under a microscope, with a hollow tube containing an irritating fluid. Foreign nettles can be more poisonous, causing severe pain lasting for days. Some species like the Roman nettle have a more severe sting. Nettles are also food for caterpillars of butterflies like the tortoiseshell, admiral, and peacock. Despite their sting, young nettle shoots can be eaten as a spinach substitute in spring.|['1.

Near the pond, you can spot yellow flags and common branched bur-reed with sword-like leaves. The arrowhead plant displays arrow-shaped leaves and pink flowers above the water's surface. Underwater, brown perfoliate pondweed leaves are almost see-through, resembling gold-beater's skin when dry. Horn-wort grows entirely submerged, featuring tufts of bristle-like leaves. Look for rose-colored spikes of amphibious persicaria too. A fascinating find is the fresh-water polyzoa, like the Cristatella colony hatched from round eggs. These colonies can grow up to 60 individuals, each with tentacles and delicate hairs. Floating grass ribbons may hold newt eggs between folds, while leaves of persicaria are chosen by female newts for egg-laying. Newt eggs undergo intriguing changes, developing rudimentary gills that later transform into feathered fringes. Newts breathe through gills initially, but as they mature, they transition to using lungs for terrestrial life.|"['1.

"Newts, often called ""askers,"" are misunderstood creatures. While villagers believe their bite is poisonous, it's actually a misconception. Newts like the smooth and warty ones are harmless. The palmated newt, found near Eyton, has unique features like webbed hind legs. The cocoons found on water-weeds are not eggs but the homes of beetles called _Donacia_. These beetles are beautiful with metallic colors and silky undersides. Planarian worms, seen as brown or black dabs on water-weeds, are fascinating creatures. They have a proboscis to extract juices from other animals. Planariæ can regenerate from cut pieces and are preyed upon by the dabs.

"Let's explore the moors once more, observing the coots and water-hens by the reedy pools near the aqueduct. Look at the great tit perched on the poplar branch, engaging in a bit of butchery with a small warbler. He's striking the little bird's head to reach its brains. ""Are there birds known as butcher-birds?"" inquired Willy, ""that impale their prey on thorns and then feed on them?"" There are three types of butcher-birds found in Great Britain: the great grey shrike, the red-backed shrike, and the woodchat shrike. The red-backed shrike is the most common, arriving in late April and departing in September. These birds are known to frequent quarry grounds in Shrewsbury. The shrikes have a unique way of eating their prey, often fixing the body on a branch or thorn to consume it. These birds are cunning and skilled predators, using mimicry to attract other birds before attacking them. Their curved beaks are perfectly designed for their hunting techniques."|"['1.

"May exclaimed, ""Look at all the little lady-bird beetles on this hedge-bank! The ground is almost red with them."" Her father confirmed that they are a common but beautiful species with seven black spots on their red wing-covers. Willy asked if these insects are harmful, but his father assured him that lady-birds are as useful as they are pretty. They help control plant-lice, those pesky green or black flies that harm trees and flowers. Lady-birds eat these pests both as larvae and adults. In fact, two lady-birds can clear two geranium plants of aphides in just one day. There are different types of lady-birds, like the seven-spotted and the two-spotted. These insects have been revered in different cultures and are even mentioned in nursery rhymes.

"This bird has very short legs. I recall lifting one off the ground as a schoolboy because it struggles to take off due to its short legs and long wings. The swift has unique feet compared to other swallows; its toes all point forward. There is another swift, the ""white-bellied swift,"" larger than the common swift, with longer wings and faster flight. Listen! A coot's call echoes from the pond. By staying quiet, we might catch a glimpse. The coot has unique feet with partly webbed toes and sharp claws. They care for their young diligently. Moor-hens, smaller than coots, share the habitat. They have different feet, each toe with a narrow membrane. They are known to move their eggs to safer spots. A water-hen tale tells of their clever nest-building to protect their eggs from rising water levels. Grebes, like the dabchick, are excellent swimmers and divers with unique feet and plumage changing with the seasons."|"[""1.

In this stream, we find the long green threads of a type of algae called Cladophora glomerata. This algae, like the frog-spawn algae, grows up to two feet long and thrives in clean water. It can be kept alive in an aquarium for weeks due to its refreshing green color and elegant shape, making it a great addition to aquariums. When detached from its original source, it forms compact balls, like the round green ball seen at home, which is a mass of Cladophora. Dr. Hassall explains that these balls are created when the algae is carried by a stream and forms into a ball due to repeated rotation. The brown color seen on some specimens is caused by the growth of other algae on its branches. Under a microscope, the brown deposit reveals the green threads of Cladophora. The area we are exploring was once covered in water, possibly a large lake, evidenced by the peat soil and sand found beneath it. The district extends from Longdon-upon-Tern to Aqualate and was once an island. The landscape has changed over the years due to cultivation. As we observe the wild moors, Jack notices a kestrel hawk hunting a small bird. The kestrel, a common British hawk, primarily feeds on mice, shrews, beetles, and lizards. While it may occasionally prey on young partridges, it plays a vital role in controlling the rodent population. The ke|['1.

Spiders create intricate webs to catch insects for food. The webs are made of delicate silk threads in a funnel shape. The spider waits at the bottom and rushes up if an insect is caught. Spiders also make nests to protect their eggs. Some spiders care for their eggs diligently, while others leave them in cocoons. The water spider spins a dome-shaped web underwater, creating a bubble of air for its eggs. Spiders have strong jaws with poison sacs to catch prey. They use their feet with claws to handle silk threads skillfully. Spiders are fascinating creatures with unique ways of surviving and reproducing.|['1.

"Let's head back to the fields once more, seeking shade under the trees to cool off from the scorching sun. Do you notice the vibrant scarlet flowers of the scarlet pimpernel, also known as the ""poor man's weather-glass""? This unique plant closes its flowers when it senses rain, unlike the convolvulus which does the same. The scarlet pimpernel is considered a reliable barometer. Interestingly, its blossoms rarely remain open after three in the afternoon. Even in Arctic regions, these flowers close during the extended daylight hours of summer. Another intriguing plant is the ""Jack-go-to-bed at noon,"" which Jack has discovered. This plant, also called goat's beard, has grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that close around noon. Caddis-worms, like the ones we see moving in the stream, build cases out of gravel or sticks.

"Here is a large pond, and from this bank we can look down into the water. There are some yellow water-lilies with their broad expanded leaves. I have noticed that the blossoms are often attacked by the larvæ of some two-winged flies. These flies lay their eggs within the petals, ""lily-cradled"" literally; the eggs hatch and the larvæ eat the cradle. I do not know more of these flies: I have often meant to trace their history, but have somehow forgotten to do so. Do you see that pike basking on the top of the water; how still and motionless he lies. He is a good-sized fish, at least I should say he was four pounds weight. ""I wish we could catch him,"" said Willy. We have no tackle with us; besides, when pike are sunning themselves in that way on the top of the water, they are seldom inclined to take a bait.
