Benny Badger was a diligent digger. He was so engrossed in his task that he didn't even pause to look back at the dirt he had tossed aside. Benny had a passion for digging and was determined to reach the end of the ground squirrel's tunnel before Mr. Coyote showed up. Despite hearing a mysterious sound that might have scared others, Benny remained unfazed. He worked tirelessly, flinging dirt with gusto. Meanwhile, Mr. Coyote, oblivious to the situation, roamed the moonlit landscape. Benny's intense digging woke Mr. Ground Squirrel, who swiftly exited his burrow as Benny made his way through the entrance. Mr. Coyote, unbothered by Benny's words, admitted he was too lazy to dig, understanding the importance of preserving Benny's joy in digging.|"[""1.

Benny Badger was perplexed by Mr. Coyote's remarks. He hesitated, unsure whether to respond pleasantly or with disagreement. Before he could decide, his chatty friend continued speaking. Benny preferred to sing his lively song in the night when Mr. Sun rested and Mrs. Wind whispered from the west. He described his joyful yips and doodles under the moonlight and howls in the dark. However, Mr. Coyote's unwanted company disrupted his peace. Despite Benny's clear disinterest, Mr. Coyote persisted, even suggesting bringing his brothers along. Benny, annoyed by the intrusion, shook his head firmly, signaling his unwillingness to entertain Mr. Coyote's ideas further.|"[""1.

"Benny Badger was adamant, ""Please, no brothers allowed here!"" he exclaimed. ""I can't stand a bunch of your relatives. Just hearing your six brothers from a distance is bad enough."" Benny's only response was a grumpy ""Humph!"" But Mr. Coyote seemed to understand and nodded in agreement. He assured Benny that he was willing to assist without involving his siblings.

Benny reluctantly accepted. While having Mr. Coyote around every night was not ideal, it beat having all seven of them. He started to see the situation in a more positive light, feeling somewhat fortunate. Benny hoped that with Mr. Coyote's help in catching Ground Squirrels, the mischievous scamp would soon lose interest.

As Mr. Coyote dashed off upon hearing his brothers, he promised to return the next night after dark. Benny watched him disappear into the moonlit night. Despite his hunger, Benny eagerly prepared to hunt for fresh Ground Squirrel holes, but his plans were interrupted by Mr. Coyote's arrival."|"[""1.

"""I was afraid you wouldn't,"" Benny replied. Mr. Coyote seemed puzzled for a moment, but then decided Benny was trying to be pleasant. ""Then you'd better hunt for one at once,"" Mr. Coyote said, sitting down. ""While you're looking, I'll sing a little song."" Instead of getting angry, Mr. Coyote pretended to wipe tears from his eyes. ""It's a pity,"" he sighed, ""that you don't understand music. I'll teach you to sing sometime."" Benny felt relieved when Mr. Coyote agreed not to sing that night and set out to look for a fresh Ground Squirrel's hole alone. Benny realized Mr. Coyote was not as helpful as he thought.

Mr. Coyote had many objections to Benny's plan. He boasted about his sharp eyes and speed, claiming he was superior to any Badger. Furthermore, he excused himself from digging due to a sore paw, though Benny couldn't see any difference in it. Before Benny could respond, Mr. Coyote yawned and fled. Later, Benny noticed his talks with Mr. Fox were one-sided and vowed to ask more questions next time. The next morning, Benny encountered Mr. Fox near Ground Squirrel's hole, surprised by his interest. A prairie chicken suddenly flew away, leaving Benny puzzled. He suspected her nest was on the ground and waited until night to search. Benny asked various animals about Mr. Fox's whereabouts, receiving conflicting answers. Perplexed, Benny decided to search in a different direction, unsure how Mr. Fox could seemingly be in three places at once.|"[""1.

Benny Badger was not known for his travels due to his heavy build and short legs. He often missed out on the happenings beyond his den. One day, three coyotes passed by quietly, surprising Benny with their unusual behavior and news about a nearby prairie dog village. Intrigued, Benny resisted the urge to follow them immediately, aware that the coyotes' presence would make the prairie dogs cautious. Later that evening, Benny cautiously followed the coyotes' trail and discovered the prairie dog village. Despite a brief encounter with an owl, Benny remained focused on the newfound interest of the prairie dog community.|"['Question 1:\nWhy was Benny Badger not known for his travels?\nA) He had short legs and a heavy build\nB) He was afraid of other animals\nC) He preferred to stay in his den\nD) He was a slow runner\nE) He was too busy with other activities', 'Question 2:\nWhat surprised Benny one day?\nA) A group of rabbits passing by\nB) Three quiet coyotes\nC) A sudden storm\nD) A loud noise from the forest\nE) An unexpected visit from a friend', ""Question 3:\nWhy did Benny resist following the coyotes immediately to the prairie dog village?\nA) He was scared of the coyotes\nB) He was tired and wanted to rest\nC) He knew the coyotes' presence would make the prairie dogs cautious\nD) He had other plans for the day\nE) He didn't believe the coyotes' news"", ""Question 4:\nWhat did Benny discover when he followed the coyotes' trail later that evening?\nA) A hidden treasure\nB) A group of squirrels\nC) The prairie dog village\nD) A lost puppy\nE) A new den for himself"", 'Question 5:\nWhat did Benny encounter briefly while focusing on the prairie dog community?\nA) A friendly rabbit\nB) An owl\nC) A group of deer\nD) A fox\nE) A squirrel', ""Question 6:\nWhat can be inferred about Benny's character from the passage?\nA) He is easily scared\nB) He is curious and adventurous\nC) He is lazy and prefers to stay in his den\nD) He is a fast runner\nE) He is unfriendly towards other animals""]"|"['A) He had short legs and a heavy build', 'B) Three quiet coyotes', ""C) He knew the coyotes' presence would make the prairie dogs cautious"", 'C) The prairie dog village', 'B) An owl', 'B) He is curious and adventurous']"
Benny Badger was thrilled with his plans until an unexpected encounter with a coyote made him grumpy. The coyote, ignoring Benny, roamed the village. Annoyed, Benny was about to growl but stopped when a woman claimed the passing coyote was her husband. She revealed her trick to catch prairie dogs after the coyote scared them. Benny was relieved when she left. Later, Benny heard news that the rancher planned to remove the prairie dog family due to their habits. Worried, Benny sought advice to save them, though secretly, he feared losing his friends.

Unfazed, his friends left him to his hole-digging routine, puzzled by his unusual behavior. Benny dug tirelessly, without a clear plan, leaving prairie dogs to mock him. Benny worked only at night, saving each day for sleep, and each night for digging. Suddenly, at midnight, he stopped, feeling he had ""saved the day.""

When Benny Badger decided to search for a new home in a safer and more pleasant area, he was unsure of where to go. He simply wanted to move far away from his current place of residence. A deer mouse nearby pointed out a water hole and cautiously kept an eye on Benny, a stranger. Benny confidently declared that he wasn't afraid of owls, gophers, or prairie dogs, and decided that the location was perfect for him to settle down. As he started to dig a den, the deer mouse, initially wary, became fascinated by the spectacle of dirt flying everywhere as Benny worked.
