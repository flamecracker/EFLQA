"In 1700, Fleet reprinted Mother Goose's songs. The latest verses include Scott's Donald Dhu, written in 1816. The collection's latest lines date back to 1822. Despite the American nationalism of the time, no references to American themes like a cent, dime, governor, or President are found. The editor of Boston Mother Goose allowed children's imaginations to roam freely, unlike a ballad where ""Long live the President"" was sung. The artist behind many distinctive designs remains a mystery, with Abel Bowen credited for some. Nathaniel Dearborn and a mysterious ""Chicket"" are also mentioned. The man in the moon design is attributed to an unknown genius artist. The engravings in the book are likely the work of Abel Bowen, a renowned wood engraver post-Revolution, known for landscapes and buildings.

I am not well-versed in genealogy, but I want to highlight that the English city of Norwich was where Fleet, the man in the Moon, was born and lived. The connection between our maritime community and London likely influenced our street names. For instance, Cornhill, where Thomas Fleet had his book store, mirrors London's Cornhill by the river. Washington Street, previously Main Street, led from Dover Street through Orange, Newbury, and Marlborough Streets to Cornhill. The names Orange, Newbury, and Marlborough honored historical figures, reflecting the Whig and Puritan sentiments of the time. Mrs. Harriet Blackstone C. Butler's work preserves this history. Mother Goose, a real person from Boston, left a literary legacy, and her family's land holdings in the city are a testament to her existence.|"['1.

"The initial known printed book in this land is titled ""Songs for the Nursery; or, Mother Goose's Melodies for Children."" The cover depicts a goose with an extended neck and wide-open mouth. Printed by T. Fleet at Pudding Lane in 1719, the price was two coppers. Some pages were absent, so the total count is unclear. T. Fleet, as per Isaiah Thomas, was talented and witty, hailing from England and trained in a Bristol print shop. He moved to Boston in 1712, setting up a print shop in Pudding Lane. Fleet married Elizabeth Goose in 1715, and together they had a son. Mother Goose's constant singing led Fleet to gather her songs and publish them, leading to ""Mother Goose's Melodies.""

"Once upon a time, there was an old woman tossed up in a blanket, seventy times as high as the moon. In her hand, she carried a broom. When asked where she was going, she replied, ""To sweep the cobwebs from the sky."" Meanwhile, the North wind blew, signaling the arrival of snow. The poor robin sought refuge in the barn to keep warm. This ram was round and fat, with horns reaching up to the sky. Lavender blue and Rosemary green, a tale of kings and queens. The lion and the Unicorn fought for the crown, receiving treats from the townsfolk. Little Johnny Pringle's pig met a tragic end, leading to sorrow in the household. Amidst chaos, a man proved his wisdom by outsmarting robbers. And the tale goes on, of hens, cocks, cats, dogs, and a man who ran fourteen miles in fifteen days without looking back."|['1.
