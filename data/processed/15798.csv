Rose was a great comfort during the initial lonely days. Her lively presence made it impossible for Clover to feel dull or sad. Rose's brightness, merriment, and affection kept everyone around her in high spirits. Elsie and John were enamored with Rose just as much as Clover was. They basked in her warmth all day long, while Phil and Dorry competed to assist her and Baby Rose. Although it would have been ideal for Rose to stay the entire summer, it was not feasible. Mr. Browne arrived promptly on the fourth day to take his family away. Despite everyone liking him for his cordial and friendly nature, Clover found it hard to bid farewell as the departure moment approached. Rose, disappointing Clover, expressed her attachment to her husband Deniston, making Clover realize that Katy might feel the same way about Ned.

The cold winter and spring passed, and another summer went by quietly for the Burnet family. Katy's early married life started to feel like a distant dream as time went on. However, as the second winter approached, a new worry arose. Phil, the delicate and spirited member of the family, fell ill after an accident while skating on a partially frozen pond. Despite the care of his sisters and the doctor's efforts, Phil's health deteriorated, and he developed pneumonia. The situation became more serious when Phil had a slight hemorrhage, prompting the need for immediate action. Dr. Carr explored various options, including sending Phil to a health resort in Colorado known for treating lung conditions. Despite concerns about Phil's well-being, the family decided that Clover would accompany him on this journey for his treatment.|"['1.

Dr. Carr expressed concerns about the accommodations in St. Helen's, a newly settled town. Clover felt a mix of emotions upon learning she would be responsible for a journey with Phil. They received conflicting advice on what to pack for the trip. Despite the uncertainty, they decided on a practical approach, packing essentials and a few comforts. To ease worries about their journey, Mrs. Hall recommended a respectable matron, Mrs. Watson, to accompany them. Dr. Carr found this suggestion comforting and agreed to the arrangement.

Clover expressed her admiration for the beautiful mountains and the rich colors of St. Helen's. As they approached the town, it appeared larger than expected, causing Clover some nervousness. Dr. Hope, a brisk man, greeted them warmly and offered to show them to a hotel. Mrs. Watson, Clover's chaperone, preferred more expensive accommodations, believing they were often better in the end. Dr. Hope suggested a quieter boarding-house for the young ones, which Clover agreed to follow. Mrs. Watson hesitated but decided to stay with the group.

Clover and Phil strolled down the street toward Dr. Hope's house on a beautiful evening. The shadows of the mountains cast a serene atmosphere. Phil appeared transformed, full of energy and skipping along. Clover, however, was cautious, knowing that Phil needed to avoid overexertion due to the high altitude. As they approached the house, they noticed the rose bushes and croquet arches surrounded by pools of water, with the flagged walks elevated above the grass-beds. Clover pondered if this design was intentional and made a mental note to observe this in other places. Meanwhile, Mrs. Watson expressed her feelings of being left out of a dinner invitation, emphasizing her social status and connections.

Mrs. Hope agreed, and Clover walked home feeling elated. Was this the St. Helen's she had feared? It turned out to be a cheerful place where kind things happened. She longed to tell Katy and her father how different it was from her expectations. The only worry was that Mrs. Watson might be upset. Luckily, Mrs. Hope managed to convince the doctor to invite Mrs. Watson to join the outing. The next morning, a polite note arrived, suggesting that Phil would ride the doctor's horse and escort Miss Chase, who would also ride. Phil was thrilled as he loved horses. Everyone was happy, and Mrs. Watson was pleased. They set off in a spacious carriage with fast horses, while Miss Chase and Phil rode alongside. The journey took them through beautiful fields of grain and colorful flowers. They crossed a lively river and entered a narrow road shaded by trees.

Mrs. Watson, in a grumpy tone, found the scenery unappealing, comparing the rocks to an unripe banana. The doctor's witty remark about the size of the rock started a laughter-filled party. Poppy showed off a bunch of columbine flowers while praising North Cheyenne's beauty. The group then explored South Cheyenne Canyon, a stunning mountain gorge with waterfalls and smooth rock basins.

It was early afternoon when they set out, the sun beginning to dip behind the mountain as they entered the High Valley. The park, a four-mile stretch nestled among the Colorado ranges, was a lush paradise. Verdant grass covered the land, trees dotted the area, and wildflowers painted the spaces around the house. Clover marveled at the breathtaking scenery, especially the lonely snow-capped peak visible to the south. The cabin, a humble abode facing the majestic view, was embraced by noble red cedars. Inside, a single spacious room served as both living and dining quarters, flanked by two bedrooms. Despite its masculine simplicity, the cabin exuded a sense of comfort. The room's floor was adorned with coyote and fox skins, while books, pipes, and newspapers cluttered the furniture. Clover noticed a corner with hymnals and prayer-books, piquing her curiosity. Clarence, their host, had arranged the rooms with a touch of care for the ladies, adorning the pine shelves with clean towels and tumbler vases filled with purple pentstemons.

She and Mrs. Hope joined the men for the round-up day. Positioned safely on a hill, they observed the thrilling scene unfold - cowboys riding fiercely, herding the cattle. Clarence and Geoffrey were skilled riders, yet the Mexican and Texan herders outshone them. The ladies marveled at the spectacle. During their rides, Clarence often took Clover, leaving Geoff with Mrs. Hope. Sunday brought a small service conducted by Geoff for the valley men.

The next day marked the end of their time in the valley when Dr. Hope arrived with the carriage. Bags were packed, saddles were loaded, and a bundle of wildflowers was carefully secured. Phil, torn from his beloved bronco, was reluctantly dragged back to civilization. His friend suggested they invite the stern Miss Perkins from a distant school to join them, much to Phil's dismay. The group rode to St. Helen's the following day, hoping to see Clover. However, they found her surrounded by other friends, including a young man in an eye-catching outfit. Despite the disappointment, Clover excitedly shared news of an unexpected invitation for a scenic railway journey over Marshall Pass.

Clover eagerly joined her companions for an early morning adventure in the Black Canyon. The refreshing air was filled with the scent of pine and mountain breezes, creating a delightful atmosphere. As they rode down the gorge on a hand-car, Clover marveled at the stunning sights around her. The river sparkled like jewels, flowing amid magnificent cliffs and forests. The canyon walls towered thousands of feet high, creating a breathtaking scene. After a pleasant journey, they returned to a warm breakfast. However, Phil's health began to decline after the trip, prompting Clover to seek advice from Dr. Hope. The doctor recommended a change of scenery to the Ute Valley for Phil's recovery.

Clover and Phil had settled in the peaceful Ute Park, a valley higher than St. Helen's. Surrounded by bird songs and rustling pines, they found solace in the quiet. The ranch house at the upper end offered a plain but cozy cabin where they stayed. The nearby High Valley was a favorite spot, easily accessible to Clover and Phil. Their friends, Clarence and Geoff Templestowe, often visited, bringing gifts and Phil's beloved horse, Sorrel. Phil's health visibly improved, and the simple, happy life they led was a welcome change. Despite occasional visits from Mr. Thurber Wade, Clover felt he didn't quite fit in. One day, caught in a thunderstorm, Clover and Clarence sought shelter in a cave, guided by a helpful young man.|"['1.

Clarence directed the horses as the rain poured down. He helped Clover down, finding shelter under a rock. Clover sat while Clarence lay on a ledge, holding the horses. The passing carriage struggled to navigate the storm with an umbrella. The lady inside glimpsed the scene - Clover's laughing eyes and dimpled cheeks, Clarence by her side. The lady imagined a romance unfolding. As the carriage rushed by, she smiled sympathetically at them. Clarence expressed his desire for Clover's company, hoping for a week together. He asked if she could like him a little, to which Clover replied playfully. Clarence, determined, expressed his feelings, asking if they could be good friends always.

Clarence expressed doubt about their chances, but then decided to give it a try because he valued Clover's companionship. Clover reassured him that things would get easier with time. Despite feeling uncomfortable about their conversation, she misunderstood Clarence's feelings. He was sincere and struggling with his emotions. They returned to St. Helen's and were accommodated in two small back rooms due to the influx of Eastern visitors. Mrs. Watson, preparing to leave for the East, shared her experiences and plans with Clover. She felt ready to return home and mentioned the cold weather in contrast to the peach season in the West.

Mrs. Marsh's home had lost its cozy feel, making Phil feel a bit down. Clover, concerned for him, pondered on solutions. Unexpectedly, while walking to see Alice Blanchard, she noticed a small furnished house for rent on Piute Street. Intrigued, she sat on the steps, trying to peek inside. A neighbor approached, explaining that the house was available because the previous tenant, Mrs. Starkey, had to leave suddenly due to her husband's health issues. Mrs. Starkey had made the house comfortable for her husband, who spent his days on the porch. Clover learned that Mrs. Starkey managed the household without much help.

Mrs. Starkey faced a sudden tragedy when her husband passed away unexpectedly. Shortly after, she received news that her son and his family were gravely ill. Overwhelmed, she decided to rent out her house until May. Clover, considering the idea, thought they could afford it with their current budget if they didn't hire a regular servant. The house, though small and modest, had some useful features like a fireplace and water already connected. Mrs. Kenny, who showed them around, praised the house's amenities like the kitchen supplies and bedding left behind.

Clover carefully considered the idea for a couple of days, discussed it with Dr. Hope, and ultimately chose to proceed with the experiment. She hired Mrs. Kenny to work two days a week, with occasional extra help as needed. Mrs. Kenny, a widow with a son working on the railroad, gladly accepted the job and became a valuable support to Clover. Phil, Clover's brother, found the plan delightful as he only enjoyed the fun part without any trouble. Despite the small house, Clover's friends eagerly assisted in preparing it. Clover was determined to spend wisely, resisting the temptation to make unnecessary improvements. With the help of friends lending items like blankets, curtains, and a lamp, No. 13 began to look inviting.
