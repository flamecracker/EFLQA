From his vantage point, Johnny Brainerd carefully surveyed the ravine. It sloped gently from the bank, offering a partial view of rocks and boulders on the opposite side. Some tall trees in the narrow valley stood high enough to reveal a significant portion of their trunks. Suddenly, rifle shots rang out, signaling imminent danger. As bullets whizzed past him, Johnny, having started the steam man, swiftly moved away from the ravine. Night fell, shrouding his friends' retreat in darkness, emphasizing the peril they faced. The steam man's initial fear-inducing effect on the savages had faded, revealing it as a harmless invention. Running low on water, Johnny knew he couldn't withstand another Indian chase. Despite the challenges, he persevered, refilling the tank. Johnny hesitated, torn between the steam man's utility and the need to keep the gold discovery secret. Baldy's warning echoed in his mind, urging caution to avoid attracting unwanted attention.|['1.

The trapper, invisible to the Indians, spotted a large force in the valley below. To communicate safely, he climbed a tree and used gestures in response to the steam man's whistle.

The boy whistled to alert the Irishman and Yankee of their location. A faint whistle in return hinted at approaching danger. Despite his sharp eyesight, Young Brainerd saw nothing, but the trapper spotted red-skins creeping near. He fired, hitting one with a screech. As the night passed, shots were exchanged. The trapper enjoyed targeting the Indians. The morning brought relief. They prepared to move with a steam-whistle signal. Approaching the ravine, they fired at the red-skins near the cave, causing chaos. The Indians fled, fearing defeat. The steam man's shrieks added to the chaos, aiding the miners in their victory. They worked tirelessly, even foregoing meals. The miners hunted for food, ensuring their continued success.|"['1.

When the four travelers were settled in the wagon with their belongings, there wasn't much space left for the wood they needed. They stored what they could, but it was only enough for twelve hours, posing a risk. The steam man managed the load effortlessly, and they sped homeward. Baldy Bicknell, the experienced guide, kept watch at night, but interruptions made his rest uncertain. To avoid attracting attention, they veered northward off the usual route, aiming for the Missouri River to catch a steamer. The cramped wagon led to weariness, prompting them to walk alongside the steam man. They faced challenges like wood shortages and a leak that almost caused an explosion. Eventually, they encountered a narrow valley that complicated their journey, requiring careful maneuvering to continue. They decided to stay put until morning due to the rough terrain and darkness.|"['1.

The trapper climbed the bank while his friends prepared to camp. He scanned the horizon and surroundings. Finding nothing amiss, he decided to stay put until morning. They had shot an antelope in the afternoon and cooked some meat. They lit a fire cautiously. After a delicious meal, they relaxed, smoked, and chatted. Later, they discussed who would stand guard. Young Brainerd volunteered for the first time. The trapper, confident in the safety, agreed. As night fell, the men slept, and Johnny, vigilant, patrolled around the campfire. Lost in thought, he missed a wolf observing him. The wolf, actually an Indian spy, signaled his comrades. Meanwhile, Johnny, absorbed in thoughts of improving a steam man, sat by the fire, unknowingly neglecting his guard duty. As drowsiness overcame him, he mistook a wolf for a hallucination. Unseen by Johnny, a group of fifty Indians rolled boulders towards the valley, preparing for an attack.|['1.

They persisted, working quietly like ghosts, moving giant stones to the ravine's edge. The Indians, silent, waited. Signals were given, and the stones rolled down without a sound. The trapper, waking, saw the unexpected wall. He knew the Indians had outwitted them. The danger was grave. The trapper realized the Indians planned to trap the steam man. They had to abandon it and escape on foot to the nearby Missouri River. The trapper remembered the Indians' horses in a distant grove. As dawn approached, they knew they were targets but the Indians didn't fire. The boy realized his mistake, feeling guilty. The group sympathized, understanding the peril they faced.|"[""1.
