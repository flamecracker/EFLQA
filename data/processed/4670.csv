In the fall, Lightfoot, the deer, impresses with his new antlers. They grow quickly, then harden, becoming pointed. Once fully grown, blood stops flowing, making them tough. Lightfoot rubs off the dry skin on trees. His impressive antlers are a sign of strength. Peter Rabbit admires Lightfoot's beauty and strength, but also knows to fear him when angry. The autumn, while often seen as sad, should be a time of happiness. Old Mother Nature meant it to be a glad time, with plentiful food and carefree days. Yet, the Spirit of Fear lurks, causing unease among the forest creatures, disrupting their peace and making them restless.

Peter was gripped by the Spirit of Fear that had spread through the forest, making even the bravest creatures tremble. It wasn't the usual predators like Reddy Fox or Redtail the Hawk that scared him. They were always on the prowl but Peter felt clever enough to evade them. However, a different fear had taken hold of him now, a fear that had also seized the hearts of his forest friends like Bob White, Mrs. Grouse, Uncle Billy Possum, and even Buster Bear. The distant sound of a bang made Peter shiver, knowing it was the hunters with their guns. He couldn't fathom why these men creatures found pleasure in hunting them, making autumn a time of sadness instead of joy. Meanwhile, Sammy Jay, an early riser, set out for breakfast, knowing that dawn was the safest time to visit the humans' dooryards.|"['Question 1: What is the main cause of fear for Peter and his forest friends in the passage?\nA) The presence of Reddy Fox and Redtail the Hawk\nB) The changing weather in autumn\nC) The distant sound of hunters with guns\nD) The arrival of Sammy Jay in the forest\nE) The scarcity of food in the forest', 'Question 2: Why does Peter feel clever enough to evade predators like Reddy Fox and Redtail the Hawk?\nA) Because he is faster than them\nB) Because he is stronger than them\nC) Because he is friends with them\nD) Because he is more cunning than them\nE) Because he is always hidden from them', 'Question 3: Who is described as an early riser in the passage?\nA) Reddy Fox\nB) Redtail the Hawk\nC) Bob White\nD) Sammy Jay\nE) Buster Bear', 'Question 4: Why does Peter find autumn to be a time of sadness instead of joy?\nA) Due to the scarcity of food\nB) Due to the presence of hunters with guns\nC) Due to the changing weather\nD) Due to the absence of his friends\nE) Due to the loud noises in the forest', ""Question 5: What time does Sammy Jay consider the safest to visit the humans' dooryards?\nA) Noon\nB) Midnight\nC) Dawn\nD) Dusk\nE) Afternoon"", 'Question 6: Who among the forest creatures is not mentioned as being gripped by the Spirit of Fear in the passage?\nA) Bob White\nB) Mrs. Grouse\nC) Uncle Billy Possum\nD) Buster Bear\nE) Sammy Jay']"|['C) The distant sound of hunters with guns', 'D) Because he is more cunning than them', 'D) Sammy Jay', 'B) Due to the presence of hunters with guns', 'C) Dawn', 'E) Sammy Jay']
Sammy perched atop a nearby tree and observed a man with a gun heading towards the Green Forest. Concerned, Sammy suspected the man was after Lightfoot the Deer, not Mr. and Mrs. Grouse. Worried for Lightfoot's safety, Sammy decided to warn him. Despite the challenges of hiding due to his large size, Lightfoot needed to evade the hunter. Unlike Danny Meadow Mouse, Lightfoot couldn't easily find hiding spots due to his size. Sammy knew the game of hide and seek between Lightfoot and the hunter was much more challenging than the one between Buster Bear and Danny. Sammy resolved to alert Lightfoot of the danger, determined to help the deer avoid the hunter's sights in the Green Forest.|"['1.

Lightfoot, the Deer, rested behind a brush pile on a hill, keeping watchful eyes and ears for any sign of danger. Despite the peaceful surroundings in the Green Forest, Lightfoot knew the hunter could still be following him. He observed the forest's inhabitants - Mr. and Mrs. Grouse, Unc' Billy Possum, and Jumper the Hare - going about their activities. Lightfoot remained cautious, understanding that danger could be lurking when least expected. As he contemplated taking a nap, a faint sound alerted him to the approaching hunter.

Lightfoot realized the hunter was patient and persistent, still hoping to get close enough to shoot him. To avoid making noise, Lightfoot moved cautiously, placing each foot down carefully. The hunter, following the direction of the wind, passed through the hollow below Lightfoot. Lightfoot, knowing the hunter's scent wouldn't reach him if he stayed ahead, stayed still until the hunter disappeared. He then silently left for Paddy the Beaver's pond, a secluded spot in the Green Forest.

Lightfoot, the deer, felt a sense of unease as he heard a sharp noise coming from Paddy's pond. It wasn't a gunshot but the warning signal of Paddy the Beaver slapping his tail on the water. Lightfoot instantly understood the danger and cautiously observed a hunter approaching the pond. The hunter, noticing Lightfoot's footprints, decided to wait, hoping the deer would return. Lightfoot, aware of the hunter's presence, stayed hidden among the hemlock trees, grateful for Paddy's timely warning.

The hunter circled the pond, checking all possible hiding spots where Lightfoot might be. He discovered Lightfoot's resting place and settled behind a log, staying still to avoid detection. Unbeknownst to the hunter, Lightfoot and Paddy the Beaver observed him. Patient and understanding of the forest's inhabitants, the hunter remained motionless like a part of the log. Mr. and Mrs. Quack landed in the pond, cautious but eventually feeling safe enough to clean themselves. Paddy refrained from warning them, waiting for any movement from the hunter.

Lightfoot, a deer, observed the hunter's intentions from the safety of the trees. He realized the hunter's target was him, not the other animals nearby. Confused, Lightfoot wondered why he was the target. Meanwhile, Mr. and Mrs. Quack searched for food in the pond, unaware of the danger. Bobby Coon went off for a nap in the forest. Suddenly, Reddy Fox appeared, eyeing the ducks hungrily. The hunter, hidden, noticed Reddy's interest in the ducks. Reddy patiently waited for the perfect moment to catch his dinner. The hunter, focused on the unfolding scene, momentarily forgot about Lightfoot. As the ducks moved closer to Reddy, the hunter hesitated, torn between scaring the ducks away or letting Reddy have his meal.|"[""1.

The hunter pondered, regretting not taking the shot earlier. The distant ducks were now in danger from Reddy Fox. Determined to protect the ducks, he planned to scare them away. However, before he could act, Sammy Jay arrived. With a mischievous glint in his eyes, Sammy Jay exposed Reddy's hiding spot, saving the ducks. Startled by Sammy's warning cries, Mr. and Mrs. Quack swiftly fled to safety. Frustrated, Reddy Fox abandoned his hunt and vanished into the forest. The hunter, hidden near Paddy the Beaver's pond, chuckled quietly, grateful for Sammy Jay's intervention. He realized Sammy had unwittingly helped him preserve the ducks. Reflecting, the hunter understood it would have been worse if he had harmed the ducks, as Reddy hunted out of hunger while the hunter had no need to harm them.|"[""1.

One day, Sammy Jay returned to the Green Forest after chasing a hunter away. He reassured Lightfoot, the Deer, that the danger had passed for the day. Sammy expressed his relief that Lightfoot was unharmed and shared his concern about the hunters lurking in the forest. Lightfoot, feeling the strain of being constantly hunted, found solace only in the darkness of night. His nerves were on edge, and he lived in fear of the next day's challenges. One morning, the sound of hounds baying signaled imminent danger. Lightfoot realized the hounds were after him, not Reddy Fox as he initially thought. The once familiar sound now filled him with dread as he knew he had to flee for his life, unable to evade both the hounds and the lurking hunters with their guns.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Sammy Jay do after chasing a hunter away?\nA) He warned Lightfoot about the danger.\nB) He joined the hunters.\nC) He went to find Reddy Fox.\nD) He stayed with Lightfoot.\nE) He left the Green Forest.', 'Question 2:\nHow did Lightfoot feel about the hunters in the forest?\nA) Excited\nB) Relaxed\nC) Anxious\nD) Indifferent\nE) Curious', ""Question 3:\nWhere did Lightfoot find solace from the constant hunting?\nA) In the river\nB) In the mountains\nC) In the darkness of night\nD) In the open fields\nE) In the hunter's cabin"", ""Question 4:\nWhat signaled imminent danger to Lightfoot one morning?\nA) The sound of birds chirping\nB) The sound of hounds baying\nC) The sound of a waterfall\nD) The sound of thunder\nE) The sound of a hunter's whistle"", 'Question 5:\nWhy did Lightfoot have to flee for his life?\nA) To find Reddy Fox\nB) To join the hunters\nC) To escape the darkness\nD) To evade the hounds and hunters\nE) To rest in a safe place', 'Question 6:\nHow did Lightfoot feel about the challenges he faced every day?\nA) Excited\nB) Relieved\nC) Fearful\nD) Indifferent\nE) Confident']"|['A) He warned Lightfoot about the danger.', 'C) Anxious', 'C) In the darkness of night', 'B) The sound of hounds baying', 'D) To evade the hounds and hunters', 'C) Fearful']
Lightfoot sprinted away with incredible leaps, a skill unique to Lightfoot. Soon, the hounds' voices faded, and Lightfoot paused to catch his breath, trembling as he listened. The baying of the hounds grew louder, their noses easily tracking his trail. In a panic, Lightfoot dashed off, and as he crossed an old road, a gunshot rang out, narrowly missing him. The unfairness of being hunted by numerous hunters with guns filled him with terror. Despite his efforts to shake off the hounds, they relentlessly pursued him. Exhausted, Lightfoot realized he couldn't outrun them forever. If he stopped, the hounds would catch him, leading to a brutal end.|"['1.

Lightfoot, a splendid swimmer despite his delicate feet, found himself in a dire situation. Pursued by hounds, he took a chance and plunged into the Big River. Exhausted from the chase, Lightfoot struggled to swim across the wide river. At one point, he felt his strength waning, fearing he might drown after all he had endured. Just when hope seemed lost, Lightfoot's feet touched solid ground on a sandbar. With renewed hope, he waded until the water deepened, forcing him to swim once more towards the safety of the shore.|"[""1.

For a while, Lightfoot stayed still, exhausted and scared, trembling in the water. He worried about being seen by a hunter on the shore who could easily shoot him. Resting on a sandbar in the Big River, he observed two hounds and a hunter on the bank he had left. As he caught his breath, a boat approached with the hunter on board. Lightfoot knew he had to swim again to escape. Despite his fatigue, he mustered the last of his strength to reach the unfamiliar shore, away from the imminent danger.

Lightfoot, the Deer, felt a wave of exhaustion and fear wash over him, with no hope in sight. But then, something unexpected happened. A man approached him gently, speaking softly and moving slowly, not with threats but in a friendly manner. Lightfoot, unsure but sensing a glimmer of trust, allowed himself to be guided towards a shed with a cozy pile of hay. Despite not understanding the man's words, Lightfoot felt a sense of safety and friendship. As he settled into the soft hay, feeling utterly drained, a hunter arrived on the scene, inquiring about a deer he had been pursuing. Lightfoot's newfound friend firmly declared that hunting was not allowed on his land, ensuring Lightfoot's safety.

Lightfoot's friend sternly reprimanded the hunter for his unethical hunting practices. The hunter, frustrated by Lightfoot's escape, plotted to hunt him down for profit. Ignoring the landowner's warning, he schemed to ambush Lightfoot as he sought refuge in the nearby woods.

Sammy Jay, usually concerned only about himself, found himself troubled about Lightfoot the Deer. Despite his usual self-confidence, Sammy was anxious because he couldn't find Lightfoot and hunters with guns roamed the Green Forest. He feared Lightfoot might have fallen prey to them.

In the Green Forest and Green Meadows, there was usually joy when the hunting season ended, knowing Lightfoot the Deer was safe. But this year, there was no celebration as Lightfoot was missing. Despite searches by Sammy Jay, Blacky the Crow, and others, no trace of Lightfoot was found. Paddy the Beaver noticed Lightfoot hadn't been to the pond, and Billy Mink found no fresh footprints. Jumper the Hare checked his favorite spots with no luck. Sammy Jay feared the worst, thinking the hounds or hunters might have harmed Lightfoot. Bobby Coon agreed, noting Lightfoot's absence would change the forest. Old Man Coyote couldn't find Lightfoot's scent either.

It was remarkably quiet and serene on the peaceful Big River, undisturbed by even the slightest ripple. The tranquility allowed them to hear a dog's bark from a distant farmhouse. Feeling safe from Reddy Fox and Old Man Coyote, they only had to keep watch for Hooty the Owl, who preferred hunting at that hour. When they heard Hooty's call from the Green Forest, Mr. and Mrs. Quack relaxed and conversed softly. Suddenly, a splash in the river caught Mr. Quack's attention. They cautiously swam closer to investigate, spotting a silver line approaching them from the shadows. Unsure if it was a hunter in a boat, they remained vigilant, ready to take flight at the first sign of danger.
