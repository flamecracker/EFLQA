When I was at the shore, a wooden spade was given to me. My holes filled with sea, like a cup overflowing. Three of us floating in the meadow, three aboard a basket in the field. Winds blow in spring, waves in the meadow like at sea. Where to adventure today? To Africa, Providence, Babylon, or Malabar? A squadron rows at sea, cattle charge in the meadow. Quick, let's escape to the harbor and garden. A man rides by in the dark, when the moon and stars are set. Why does he gallop about? I want to go where golden apples grow, parrot islands with cockatoos and goats. Eastern cities with mosques and minarets, where goods hang in the bazaar. I'll come with a camel caravan, light a fire in an old dining room. Explore old Egyptian toys, with a little shadow following me everywhere. The wind blows all day, singing its loud song, hiding its true self.|"['1.

My tea is almost ready, and the sun has set; it's time to peek out the window and watch Leerie pass by. Each evening at tea-time, before you sit down, he comes up the street with his lantern and ladder. I dream of joining him one day, lighting up the night. Lucky to have a lamp outside our door, Leerie stops to light it and many more. Before you rush past, see a child and nod tonight! Imagine sailing on a ship in a pond, turning around and about. When I'm older, I'll find the secret to sail beyond. We can be small, exploring caves and playing with tin soldiers. I am the captain of a ship, sailing on the water with breezes blowing. I discovered a little dell by a water well, where I ruled as king. I made a boat, a town, and explored the caverns. My mother's call brought me back from my adventures to the real world. With my nurse, I found a whistle made by a plane tree branch. I also found a stone that I'm sure is gold and a chisel made by a carpenter. When tired, I shut my eyes and sail to the Land of Play, where tiny people live.|['1.
