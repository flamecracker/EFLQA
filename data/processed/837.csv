Four children, Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane, spent their summer holidays in a white house between a sandpit and a chalkpit. One day, they discovered a peculiar creature in the sandpit, a Psammead or sand-fairy. This ancient being had eyes on long horns, ears like a bat, a tubby spider-like body covered in fur, and hands and feet resembling a monkey's. The Psammead had the magical ability to grant wishes. However, the children's wishes often led to unexpected outcomes. Eventually, their wishful thinking landed them in trouble, and the Psammead helped them out on the condition that they never ask for more wishes or reveal its existence. The children eagerly anticipated their next summer holiday filled with wonder and excitement. But their plans were disrupted when their father had to leave for Manchuria due to the war, and their mother was ill in Madeira. Left in the care of old Nurse in Fitzroy Street, the children felt miserable and cried after their father's departure. Despite their sadness, a meal of tea with shrimps and watercress brought a slight cheer to their hearts.|"['1.

After tea, Anthea went upstairs to Father's room, feeling his absence keenly as he was far away at war. She wept for him and for their sick Mother left alone. Remembering her responsibility as the eldest, she wiped her tears and suggested a family discussion. Recalling the past summer's adventures, they longed for the freedom of the countryside. Their current surroundings, Nurse's stuffy parlor, contrasted sharply with their memories. Anthea proposed exploring London on a budget, as they were now older and without their Lamb. Despite their constrained circumstances, they sought to make the best of their situation, focusing on the free wonders the city had to offer.|"[""1.

The children decided to take a walk to St. James's Park. They were excited to feed the ducks there. Despite old Nurse's warnings about road crossings, the children were confident, having lived in busy Camden Town. On their way, they passed many interesting shops filled with beautiful items that caught their attention. They were especially intrigued by a shop selling birds in cages. This made them reflect on the sadness of creatures with wings being confined. The children also saw cats and dogs for sale, feeling sorry for the animals trapped in cages. They dreamt of setting them all free. Finally, they reached a shop selling various small creatures like goldfish and guinea pigs, where they spent time feeding and admiring the animals.|"[""1.

On the sidewalk, Cyril and his friends chatted by the pet shop hutches. Cyril noticed a hedgehog looking sad and neglected. The Psammead, a magical creature disguised as a mangy monkey, whispered to Cyril not to draw attention to it. The Psammead suggested they ask about other animals first before inquiring about it. The shop owner, irritated by their curiosity, quoted fourpence for the Psammead. The Psammead urged Cyril to act disinterested to avoid a high price. Despite the shop owner's gruffness, the Psammead was grateful to be noticed. Cyril signaled to his friends to focus on a white rat while negotiating. The Psammead, trying to appear unappealing, hoped they could afford to buy it.|"['1.

"""Oh! wait a minute,"" said the poor Cyril, feeling foolish yet well-intentioned following the Psammead's instructions. ""Just tell me one thing. What do you want for the shabby old monkey in the third hutch from the end?""

""Ah, does he indeed,"" sneered the seller. Then he scratched his ear suspiciously, being a sharp businessman. His hand was wrapped, and moments ago, he would have sold the ""shabby old monkey"" for ten shillings. Now he demanded, ""Two pounds ten is my price. This monkey is unique, unmatched this side of the equator. The only one in London. Should be in the Zoo. Two pounds ten, or you leave!""

The children exchanged a look – they only had twenty-three shillings and fivepence, thanks to a sovereign from Father. Anthea held out her arms, and the Psammead leaped into them. The children went into the shop, the man surprised as Anthea held a bag open, and the Psammead crept in. ""If I'd known,"" the man muttered, ""I'd have charged you double. But I did well, considering I paid five shillings for it. But watch out for bites!""

They got sand, put it and the Psammead in the bath, where it cleaned itself and fell asleep. ""You saved me,"" it said. ""I'd have perished"|"[""1.

After finishing a delightful breakfast with warm rolls, Anthea decided to wake the Psammead from its slumber. The Psammead, a magical creature, stretched and spoke to Anthea about setting clear boundaries. Anthea, understanding the Psammead's need for respect, offered to take it anywhere it wished. The Psammead, though grateful for being rescued, reminded Anthea that their natures remained unchanged. It emphasized the importance of mutual respect and understanding. Anthea, showing kindness, listened to the Psammead's story of how it ended up in captivity.

Jane expressed her disappointment to the Psammead, hoping that it could help them retrieve their parents. The Psammead mentioned a powerful charm near the shop where they bought it. This charm could grant their heart's desire. Anthea, in an attempt to convince the Psammead, emphasized the urgency of their situation. The Psammead assured them that this charm would be different from the wishes it granted before. Anthea and the others decided to go to the shop to buy the charm. As they arrived at the shop, they saw a variety of items in the window display. The Psammead identified the charm on a dirty silver tray among other trinkets. Anthea was tasked with asking about the price of other items to prompt the shopkeeper to bring out the tray with the charm.|"[""1.

The children stood outside a shop, watching Anthea inside, where she encountered a mysterious diamond ring. The group felt that magic could only happen in the countryside, not near the busy city. However, they had the Psammead, a magical creature who could talk and had guided them to a charm that promised happiness. Disappointed by the unsuccessful attempt to find the other half of the charm, Cyril returned home. The children were downcast until the Psammead arrived, urging them to pay attention. Despite missing their parents and feeling a mix of emotions, they were ready for the adventure ahead.|"['1.

The Psammead, a magical creature, explained to the children that the red thing they found is half of an Amulet that can do amazing things like make crops grow and bring happiness. The complete Amulet can ward off negative feelings like jealousy and bad temper. To activate its powers, they need to read the name written on the charm aloud. The Psammead advised caution, suggesting they seek help from a wise man upstairs. The children, after preparing themselves, went to the learned gentleman's room to seek his aid. They found the room filled with odd objects and a cold mutton chop.

The gentleman, a thin man with long boots, sat at a table in the window, examining a small object with pincers and a spy-glass in one eye. Unaware of the children's presence, they cautiously entered, only to find a large, colorful mummy-case on the wall. Apologizing for the interruption, the children explained they had a charm that required a specific name to work. They sought the gentleman's promise not to reveal a stronger name.

"The children politely said ""thank you"" as they left, with Anthea returning to remind the man to eat his chop. She explained how important it is not to miss meals. The man sighed while eating, longing for care. The Psammead taught them how to use a word of power and make a charm speak. They gathered in a circle, and darkness enveloped them, followed by a faint light and voice. The light grew, resembling glow-worms, and the voice was sweet and comforting.

"""The Amulet, a powerful artifact, was shattered and scattered across lands and seas, lost in time. The Psammead, a mystical creature, explained that understanding the concept of time and space is crucial to finding the lost Amulet. Long ago, the Amulet was in a shrine, but was separated into two halves, one lost in the desert. Over centuries, it resurfaced through various hands until it reached the present. To unlock its power, one must speak the word of power and pass through a portal to the past. However, caution is advised to not lose hold of the Amulet or risk being trapped in the past forever. The enchanting voice revealed the Amulet's history, linking it to Napoleon's conquest in Egypt and the wonders unearthed by wise men.

The kids rubbed their eyes, the Psammead dashed to its sandy bath, and the rest went for tea. Until the cups were filled, tea felt less real than the lovely voice and green light. Anthea reminded them to eat breakfast before it got cold. They had an amazing time with the charm, experiencing darkness, green light, and a speaking voice. They were told the other half was lost in the Past, so they planned to search there. No one dared suggest not using the charm, though they were anxious about getting stuck in the Past. They prepared to be out all day, not wanting to excite old Nurse's curiosity. They bought waterproof sheeting for the Psammead in case it rained in the Past. With roses in their buttonholes, they sat in Regent’s Park, under dusty, yellowish trees, ready to travel back in time using the charm.|"['1.

"As the children stepped through the mysterious arch, a brilliant light enveloped them, causing them to blink and rub their eyes. When their vision adjusted, they found themselves in a clearing within a dense forest. The sky above sparkled like the sea under a bright sun. A river flowed nearby, bordered by black mud and lush greenery. In the distance, an unfamiliar landscape unfolded before them.

Suddenly, they encountered a girl, similar in age to Anthea, with short fair hair and sun-kissed skin. She wore minimal clothing, unlike the English children in their elaborate attire. The girl, carrying a pot on her head, made a humming sound as she collected fish from the river.

Startled by the appearance of the four children, the girl dropped her pitcher, spilling water and fish on the ground. She let out a scream, shocked by the unexpected visitors in her serene surroundings."|['1.

Anthea wore a cheap silver bangle with a turquoise glass heart, a gift from the maid-of-all-work at their old house. The group walked through a narrow path in a dark wood, emerging into the bright sunlight on a sandy beach with rocks and cactus plants. They followed the girl through a hedge into a village of huts made of wood, twigs, and clay, with low doors and sand between them. Cyril tried to explain they came from a place where the sun never sets, seeking peace with honor. The villagers were fascinated by their woven clothes and modern sewing. The villagers, with fair hair and blue eyes, wore animal skins and had rough tattoos. Their short hair and blue eyes were unusual for Egypt, and they seemed amazed by the children's clothing.|"['1.

The children were intrigued by the unfamiliar surroundings. They were eager to learn about the new place and its customs. The four strangers, the subjects of the villagers' talk, tried to find comfort in the girl's promise of friendliness. Sitting in the shadow of the village's center, they observed the crowd and marveled at the intricate flint bracelet and the huts being constructed with wood and mud. The girl shared how the men hunted with spears and arrows, made boats with reeds, and used fish-traps in the river. She displayed clay pots, jars, and stone ornaments. Jane whispered her unease, feeling like they were not in the past but in the present. The children pondered how to return home and find the missing charm.|"[""1.

Anthea absentmindedly removed the drooping red roses from the others' buttonholes, trimmed the stems, and placed them in a vase of water near a hut door. She always had a fondness for flowers. Meanwhile, the runner, who had been on his knees, rose and began speaking. He recounted a tale of encountering a group of strangers, describing them as numerous and armed. The villagers exchanged gifts with the headman as a sign of peace. Amidst the exchange, Robert revealed a toy pistol, claiming it as a sign of protection for the village's sacred item.

The children were guided through a series of hedges and lanes until they reached a village entrance. Anthea emphasized staying together and returning to the village if needed. They observed flint weapons being crafted and the sun setting abruptly like in ancient Egypt. The children were led to a safe spot to rest by a girl with deer skins. Despite the looming dangers, a growing trust in the Psammead made them feel secure. They drifted off to sleep, only to be awakened by terrifying noises echoing around them, signaling imminent danger.

"""It's the strangers' voices,"" the girl said, trembling as she approached them in the darkness. ""They've tried to breach the walls, but the thorns pushed them back. My father thinks they won't attack until morning. They're just trying to scare us, as if we were primitive swamp dwellers!"" she exclaimed indignantly. Just as the children felt relief, a rain of javelins flew over the thorn-hedge, forcing everyone to seek shelter behind the huts. Another wave of weapons came from the opposite side, prompting the crowd to move to another hiding spot. Amid the chaos, Cyril removed a javelin lodged in the hut's roof, its copper head gleaming brightly. The villagers rallied to the source of the noise and shouting, defending their village with stones and flint-headed arrows. The children witnessed the fierce determination in the eyes of the attackers, a stark contrast to the sanitized battles they had seen in newspapers. The besiegers were momentarily repelled by a barrage of stones, allowing the besieged to catch their breath. But soon, the fight shifted to another side of the village as the attackers regrouped. The children observed a leader performing a mysterious ritual with a red stone, signaling a pivotal moment in the conflict.

The noise of battle grew louder as the headmen defended their treasure from the approaching enemy. Suddenly, the roof was torn open, revealing a menacing figure with a knife. In a desperate move, the children used a charm to create an arch that transported them from ancient Egypt back to London. They found themselves in Regent’s Park, surrounded by the familiar sounds of sparrows and children playing. Despite the oddity of their return, the children were relieved to be back home. Anthea later visited the learned gentleman, recounting their adventure in Egypt, which he dismissed as a figment of his imagination. Meanwhile, Jane played in her makeshift house, and the others enjoyed tobogganing on the stairs until old Nurse intervened, ending their fun prematurely.|"['1.

It was a rainy day, disrupting plans to explore London's free sights. Memories of the previous day's adventure lingered, where Jane's charm transported them to ancient Egypt. The group, still spooked, hoped to avoid another time-travel trip. Cyril, trying to appear brave, suggested searching for the Amulet. Frustrated, they blamed Jane for their predicament. Anthea defended herself, asserting her courage despite being a girl. Amidst tension, Jane's tears subsided, and Anthea comforted her, urging her to consider the importance of finding the Amulet to reunite their family.

The ancient city of Babylon once stood as a magnificent hub of art and learning, but now lies in ruins buried beneath the earth. Scholars debate its exact location due to the extensive covering of soil. The charm discovered in Egyptian tombs, though possibly originating from Asia or brought to Babylon as spoils of war, evokes thoughts of the city's former glory. Babylonians, known for their gentleness and cultural achievements, created beautiful statues, jewelry, and grand palaces. Their libraries and towers for astrological observations showcased their high level of knowledge. As the children embarked on a magical journey through a charm, they found themselves in an orchard teeming with life, far removed from the violent history associated with Babylon.|"['1.

As they strolled through the refreshing grass, all they could see were endless trees. Beyond their orchard lay another, separated by a clear stream. Crossing it, Cyril, a gardening enthusiast, impressed the others by naming various trees like nut-trees, almond-trees, apricots, and fig-trees with large leaves. After traversing brooks, they reached a rugged road lined with cypress and acacia trees and tamarisk hedges. Ahead stood a grand wall with towering gates shining in the morning sun. The gates led to a town with wooden and stone houses amidst green orchards. The Psammead urged them to march into the town boldly. Approaching the gates, the children encountered a gatekeeper who seemed indifferent, but another man, more empathetic, offered to take them to his home for better attire before exploring the town.|['1.

The man guided them into the town through a dark arch, a stark contrast from London. Unlike London's patched-up appearance, the houses here seemed carefully crafted with similar tastes in mind. While they were all square, they varied in size and were adorned uniquely - some with bright paintings, others with black and silver designs. The town featured terraces, gardens, balconies, and open spaces with trees. A kind woman, spinning at her doorstep, lent the children mantles to explore the town until the Queen's audience. The town dazzled with bright houses covered in pictures and intricate carvings. The market boasted stalls filled with pineapples, peaches, crockery, glassware, jewelry, fabrics, and more. The grand palace, adorned with statues and guarded by soldiers in white and scarlet armor, glistened in the sunlight.

The crowd was surprised and excited as a black man spoke to someone before a big man beckoned them up red marble steps. Nervous Robert's boots clattered loudly. They reached the throne, where a splendid lady welcomed them. She mentioned the daily task of doing justice and expressed a preference for private audiences. Despite this, she proceeded with public justice, which she claimed to do admirably. The children found her beautiful and kind but slightly flighty. The Queen heard cases, including a dispute over stolen money and a stolen fox. She dismissed the fox case, stating there were no foxes in Babylon.

The Queen was approached by people seeking her help with various family disputes and misunderstandings. From brothers fighting over an inheritance to a woman not returning a borrowed cooking-pot from a festival, the Queen resolved each issue with wisdom and fairness. After dealing with the matters, she led them to a peaceful garden courtyard with roses and cool shade. Slaves arranged cushions, and a man served refreshing drinks in golden cups. The children felt a bit uneasy about the cups but were reassured when the man drank from the Queen's cup first. The drink was cold and delicious, tasting like lemonade and penny ices. Cyril shared a story about a magical creature called the Psammead, as he couldn't reveal the truth about their time-traveling adventures. The Queen was intrigued by their account-book and pencil, and Cyril gifted them to her. She was delighted and asked Cyril to teach her about famous names like Alfred the Great and Sherlock Holmes. The Queen then mentioned the King's many wives, and Anthea quickly apologized for the misunderstanding.|"[""1.

The Queen shared a humorous tale about the King's quest for an Egyptian princess to add to his collection of wives. The Queen described the elaborate gifts and journeys undertaken to secure the princess's hand in marriage. Despite the King's sister being offered instead, more gifts and journeys followed. Finally, the black-haired princess was on her way, and the King awaited her arrival in a grand chariot. The Queen then invited the children to dine with her in a cool hall, where they enjoyed a unique meal served on beautiful golden trays. The Queen ate with her fingers, showcasing different table manners than the children were accustomed to. The dinner included boiled corn, meat, raisins, quinces, dates, and cream, a lavish feast unlike their usual meals.

While the Queen prepared for an event, the children, feeling the weight of losing Jane, the Psammead, and the Amulet, engaged in a somber conversation. Blaming one another, they recalled the recent banquet where they enjoyed a luxurious bath, followed by being oiled and dressed for a meeting with the King. The banquet was lavish, with delicious food and drink, and guests reclined on cushions. Despite a lackluster dancer, the Court was pleased. When the Queen suggested a song, Anthea declined, recalling a past band they had formed. The children sang, and the King's response was overwhelming.

The King angrily ordered the children to the dungeons, suspecting they knew about the lost half of something important. Surrounded by guards, they were led through the grand hall, hearing horrified courtiers. Descending steps, they found themselves in a dark, damp cell below the river Euphrates. Feeling uneasy, they saw newts and creepy creatures in the shadows. Anthea and Cyril resisted blaming Robert, staying strong in the face of fear. As the soldiers left, the gaoler advised them to make up stories if questioned. Anthea reassured the others, believing it was all a dream and they would wake up safe.|['1.

In a quiet room, a cold blue light illuminated a terrifying figure with eagle wings and a human body approaching. This figure was exactly as depicted in ancient Babylonian carvings. Nisroch, the figure, pointed at a wall, revealing a luxurious room with the Queen and the Psammead. Jane was asleep on a couch. The Queen, surprised by their presence, offered to help them escape.

Anthea led the Queen away, followed by the children, as a crowd of angry gentlemen watched from the steps. As they reached the courtyard, the Queen's gaze fell on the bag containing the Psammead, causing her to stop abruptly. Suddenly, there was a loud crash as the glass swing doors shattered, revealing stone statues and various ancient objects floating into the courtyard. The angry gentlemen were taken aback and sat down, except for one who calmly closed the iron gates. The Queen, realizing the danger, expressed concern about being discovered and taken to Westminster. The man reflected on the unexpected turn of events, attributing it to thought-transference and Babylonian influences.

Around fifty-five years before the time you are familiar with,” grumbled the Psammead. “Is there anything else you wish to know?” it added, poking its head out of the bag formed by Anthea’s blue linen dress, and scanning the area with its slow-moving eyes. “I have been here before—it looks very much the same.”“Your thoughtless companion,” the Psammead retorted, “wanted to discover a place where they would be happy to welcome that unattractive and immature human girl you have taken in—no one knows how.

Your careless companion desired a place where someone would be pleased to have this unwanted stranger.

Cyril was busy lathering soap between his hands when he shared his thoughts with the group. He emphasized that they had only played with the Amulet so far but now needed to work with it seriously. He mentioned their parents, especially their father in the midst of fighting, as a reason to take action. The idea was to follow the example of traders who exchange useful items with indigenous people for valuable goods. They decided to gather items to trade on their next journey to the past.

Anthea suggested that luck might favor not making a choice, as in many stories where the seemingly insignificant object chosen by a commoner turns out to be magical. Cyril expressed his weariness of kings and suggested looking for the Amulet in a temple among common people. As they stepped into a boisterous crowd, the children found themselves surrounded by angry men, women, and children of various complexions.

The crowd was torn between heading to the granaries or presenting a petition to the King. Ultimately, the call to see Pharaoh prevailed, and the mass surged towards the palace, carrying the children along. Anthea struggled to protect the Psammead from being squashed in the commotion. As they passed through the market, Robert observed exchanges of goods, like onions for a comb and fish for beads. The people in the market seemed wealthier than those in the crowd. Suddenly, the atmosphere shifted from anger to fear as the sound of approaching Guards grew louder. The workmen dispersed as the Guards on chariots thundered down the street. Robert suggested befriending a Temple doorkeeper to gain entry, noting the grandeur of the nearby temple and palace structures.

Inside the grand hall, a garden bloomed with various trees and flowers, a serene lake housed fish and blue lotus flowers, and ducks swam merrily.

As they approached Pharaoh's throne, the priest and children prostrated themselves. The priest praised the children, mentioning their unique magic. The children presented gifts, not as tribute but as a gesture. Pharaoh, intrigued, directed the items to the treasury. Anthea revealed why Pharaoh's magic had waned.

Cyril interrupted, “It’s dull for you just guarding us. Want to see magic?

The children felt a bit shy as the people around them seemed so interested. They veered off the main path into a narrow one among trees. In a secluded spot between tall cypresses, they found a boy lying on the mossy ground. Anthea knelt by him, and he confessed to tearing a sheet of paper in the playground.

After the reformer, who lived in ancient times and believed in pursuing one's desires instead of just fixing what already existed, a lady named Anthea found herself in a dreary setting. Looking out the window, she saw a grey sky and a foggy street where people rushed by. Anthea noticed the misery and wickedness around her and yearned for a change.

Anthea, curious, asked the Psammead how they could remember the future. The Psammead explained that it was prophetic vision, akin to remembering dreams. Anthea bid Nurse goodnight, admiring the testimonial gift. The children, gifted with paint-boxes, painted happily. Suddenly, they found themselves in a boat with a unique design, manned by dark, busy crew members. The crew gathered mussels and frogs, paying no heed to the children. The children marveled at this unexpected journey, surrounded by other boats on the tranquil blue waters."|['1.

Jane questioned a man on the boat who appeared to be a leader due to his attire. He was not surprised by the stowaways' peculiar clothing. The man, identified as Rekh-marā, the priest who had guided them before, suggested they stay until morning. He mentioned Tyre, a city on an island rock, known for its grand ships. The man boasted about the riches brought back from trading voyages. He explained the trade involving cloth, glass, and silver mining. The man scorned the children for not knowing about the finest dyed fabrics, reserved for royalty. The children felt uncomfortable under his watchful eyes. The sailors shared information about the dye-fish used for cloth dyeing.|"[""1.

The boat, heavy with cargo, slowly circled the island's tip and docked in a bustling harbor protected by a long barrier. The harbor bustled with various ships, captivating Cyril and Robert more than their sisters. The breakwater and docks were stacked with goods and busy with slaves and sailors. In the distance, men practiced diving. The skipper praised the local pearl divers' skills, mentioning a unique freshwater spring beneath the sea that divers collected in skin bottles. As they approached the quay, the skipper tidied up, adorned himself, and revealed his magical abilities, having brought the children to the boat for a purpose. The children, uplifted by the morning's brightness and a glimpse of an Egyptian amulet, followed the skipper through the city gate, passing through fishy and garlic-scented streets to a dye factory. The dye-master, lavishly adorned, emphasized the importance of the two halves of an amulet and the need to stay together to find the missing pin.|"[""1.

Robert considered tipping the dye-master into a vat but thought better of it. They enjoyed their journey from the Island City to the mainland, riding donkeys through a garden-like landscape. In a mosaic-floored hall, they were left alone, admiring sea-themed pictures. A council was held after a surprising announcement, deciding to stay as they were not in danger. Pheles, the house master, left for a voyage, leaving his wife to entertain the children. The Priest sought help for a stolen Amulet. They boarded a ship bound for the mysterious Tin Isles, causing seasickness. Pheles revealed the secret destination, comparing it to the children's magic.|"['1.

Rekh-marā spoke confidently, planning to enlist barbarians to help in a night attack to retrieve a sacred Amulet. With a quick wish, they transported to a ship near the Tin Isles, altering time. The crew and ship appeared worn from the skipped months. Facing a foreign ship tailing them for Tyre's secrets, they decided to confront their pursuers bravely. Anthea and Rekh-marā summoned protective arches using Amulets, casting a green light over the waves and revealing the perilous rocks ahead.

The children were in for an adventure as they scrambled through the arch and found themselves in a parlour on Fitzroy Street. The echoes of the doomed sailors' triumphant shout lingered in their ears. Cyril and Jane were feeling unwell, but obliging Anthea overruled Robert as they made a promise. Little did they know what awaited them. There were thrilling encounters in the golden desert and the Temple of Baalbec, meeting the Phœnix and witnessing its prophetic trance. They had a magical time at a lantern show about soldiers in South Africa. An outing to the Egyptian Hall led to more mysteries. Despite missing parts of the programme, they marveled at the magical performances. The children's curiosity and sense of adventure led them on unforgettable journeys.|"['1.

At a magic show, Robert noticed a sudden appearance in the vacant seat next to him. While the audience marveled at Mr. Devant's tricks, an Egyptian Priest mysteriously appeared in the empty chair. Mr. Devant, seizing the moment, introduced the Priest as part of his act, surprising everyone. The children, along with the Priest, were taken home in a cab to avoid attention. Back at their house, a tense moment unfolded as the Priest's Amulet merged with theirs. Anthea suggested sharing the Amulet to avoid conflict, but Robert threatened to involve the police if the Priest caused trouble.

"""Listen,"" she said kindly, ""we want to be friends and help you. Let's form an agreement. Let's work together to retrieve the Amulet - the complete one.

Once upon a time, on a dusty floor cluttered with papers and oddities, a half Amulet quivered and moved towards a perfect Amulet, held by Robert. As the two Amulets merged, a Priest marveled at the deep knowledge it represented. The Priest contemplated staying in this future time, but the Psammead warned of the dangers of living in a different era. To seek guidance, they formed a mystic circle and consulted the Amulet. A profound darkness enveloped them as a powerful light and voice emerged. The voice proclaimed that no one could pass through the Amulet to any time or land anymore. Instead, the perfect union beyond time and space was possible through the perfect charm. Anthea, filled with trepidation, requested the voice to speak clearly about Rekh-marā's predicament.|"['1.
