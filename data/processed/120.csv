The stranger led me into the parlour, positioning us out of sight behind the door. His fear was palpable, evident in his actions as he readied his cutlass.

After my father's funeral, on a cold, foggy afternoon, I saw a blind man approaching. He wore a green shade over his eyes, looked frail, and draped in an old sea-cloak. His eerie appearance frightened me. He demanded help, claiming to have lost his sight defending his country. He grabbed my hand forcefully, commanding me to lead him to a sick buccaneer.

The small village was just a short distance away, hidden from view on the other side of the nearby cove. I felt relieved knowing it was in the opposite direction from where the blind man had come and likely returned. As we hurried along, occasionally stopping to listen, there was only the gentle sound of the water and the croaking of woodland creatures. By the time we reached the village, it was already dark, but the warm glow of candlelight in the windows lifted my spirits. However, no one was willing to accompany us back to the Admiral Benbow inn. Despite our pleas, the villagers refused, fearing the name of Captain Flint. Determined, my mother and I decided to return alone, with a loaded pistol for protection. As we embarked on this risky journey, the moon rose, casting an eerie light on our path. Upon our return to the inn, we found the door closed, and with a mix of fear and determination, we entered the dark building.

After bravely searching the chest, we discovered a key tied to a string. Excited, we rushed upstairs to the room where the mysterious box lay. Inside, we found a set of pristine clothes never worn. Beneath them, a trove of treasures awaited us - silver, pistols, a compass, and foreign trinkets. Buried in the chest was an oilcloth bundle filled with papers and a canvas bag jingling with gold coins. As we counted the coins, a chilling sound of tapping approached. Panic set in as the blind man tried to enter the inn. With quick thinking, we grabbed the treasure and fled, narrowly escaping the blind man and his companions.

My intense curiosity overcame my fear as I stealthily returned to the bank, concealing myself behind a bush to observe the road leading to our door. Soon, a group of seven or eight men, including a blind beggar, rushed towards our inn. Amidst the mist, I could discern their hurried steps and the blind man's commanding voice. They barged into the Admiral Benbow inn, creating a commotion and searching for us. As chaos ensued, a whistle pierced the night, signaling danger from the hillside. The blind beggar, Pew, urged his crew to find us, but they scattered in fear.

The squire had repaired everything, repainted, and added new furniture, including a beautiful armchair for my mother. He even found a boy to apprentice under her while I was away. Seeing the boy made me realize my situation for the first time, and I couldn't help but shed tears at the thought of leaving my home. After saying goodbye, we set out on foot, passing by the quays with a multitude of ships. The smell of the sea was new to me, and I marveled at the sailors and ships. We eventually reached an inn where Squire Trelawney awaited us. He handed me a note for John Silver at the Spy-glass tavern, where I found the man himself, Long John Silver, a tall and strong figure with a cheerful demeanor despite his missing leg.|"[""1.

From the moment I heard about Long John in Squire Trelawney's letter, I feared he might be the one-legged sailor I had seen at the old Benbow inn. But one look at him dispelled my worries. Having seen real buccaneers like the captain, Black Dog, and the blind man Pew, I knew Long John was different. Suddenly, a customer rushed out, and I recognized him as the tallow-faced man missing two fingers who had visited the Admiral Benbow before. Long John scolded him, hinting at a shady past. Silver, another pirate, praised the man's honesty but called him foolish. The mention of Black Dog and Pew stirred up excitement, with plans to confront them for Cap'n Trelawney.

Two voices conversed earnestly, one belonging to Long John Silver, discussing gold and loyalty. Another man, red-faced and hoarse, challenged Silver's plan. Suddenly, a distant scream shattered the conversation, signaling trouble. The man named Alan was mourned, and the other man defied Silver, walking away. Enraged, Silver hurled his crutch at the man, striking him down. The man fell, possibly with a broken back, and Silver mercilessly stabbed him. Hidden among the trees, I witnessed this brutal act, hearing the violent blows echo through the air.|"['1.

I do not know what it rightly is to faint, but I do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist. Silver and the birds, and the tall Spy-glass hilltop, going round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes, and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear. When I came again to myself, the monster had pulled himself together, his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head. Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit, cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass. Everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain. I could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes. But now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but it instantly awoke my fears. More men would be coming. I might be discovered. They had already slain two of the honest people; after Tom and Alan, might not I come next?

The figure reappeared and circled to cut me off. Exhausted, I knew I couldn't outrun this man-like creature bounding tree to tree. Although peculiar, I realized it was a man, easing my fear. As I pondered escape, my pistol gave me courage. I boldly approached the man, who, to my surprise, knelt in supplication. He was a white man, his sunburnt skin contrasting with his fair eyes. Clad in scraps of ship canvas, his belt was the only sturdy piece. Marooned for years, he survived on goats, berries, and oysters, yearning for cheese. He shared his rough past, claiming newfound piety. Hushed, he whispered of his riches, a secret he held dear.|"[""1.

I was certain the man had lost his mind in isolation. He insisted he was rich and promised to make a man out of me. After sharing our voyage's story, he pondered if our squire would reward us generously. He revealed being on Flint's ship when they buried the treasure. Flint returned alone, his crew dead. Ben Gunn, the man I spoke to, was marooned for three years by his crew who sought the treasure. Despite his hardships, he remained hopeful. He expressed his determination to find the treasure and shared his past experiences with Flint's riches. His resilience and unwavering spirit inspired me.|"[""1.

At around half past one, which is three bells in sea terms, the HISPANIOLA sent two boats ashore. In the cabin, the captain, the squire, and I discussed our situation. If there had been a breeze, we would have dealt with the six mutineers on board, hoisted the anchor, and sailed away. But the wind was absent, leaving us stranded. To make matters worse, Hunter arrived with news that Jim Hawkins had sneaked into a boat and joined the others ashore. We never doubted Jim, but we worried for his safety. With the crew's volatile state, it was uncertain if Jim would return. We rushed to the deck. The tar was bubbling in the seams, and the foul odor made me queasy. The six rascals were grumbling under a sail on the forecastle; on land, we could see the boats secured with a man in each, near the river's mouth. One of them was whistling “Lillibullero.”|"[""1.

"Hunter and I steered straight towards the stockade, while the guards at the boats seemed puzzled by our approach. They hesitated, possibly debating whether to inform Silver. Instead, they stayed put and resumed singing ""Lillibullero."" I navigated to keep the coast between us and the gigs, eventually landing near a spring atop a knoll. Surrounding the spring was a sturdy loghouse, fortified and well-equipped to fend off attackers. What caught my attention was the spring itself, a precious resource we lacked on the ship. Suddenly, a cry of distress echoed across the island, signaling danger. Without hesitation, I rushed back to the shore, boarded the jolly-boat, and prepared it with supplies and weapons. Despite the risks, we made a second trip to provision the blockhouse, a bold move that could have ended in disaster.

The squire was waiting for me at the back window, looking much better. He secured the boat and we hurried to load it with provisions like pork, powder, and biscuits. The only weapons we kept were a musket and a cutlass each. We tossed the rest overboard to hide them from the pirates. As the tide changed, the ship started moving. We heard distant voices from the direction of the other boats, signaling our friends were safe but urging us to leave. Mr. Smollett instructed us to join him, giving us little time. The boat was heavily loaded, and the current was pulling us off course towards danger. We had to row hard to reach our destination safely.|['1.

The pirates had the gun aimed towards us, and Hands, who was at the front, was most at risk. Despite our efforts, Trelawney missed his shot, narrowly avoiding disaster as another pirate fell. The pirates from the shore were now joining in the attack, rushing towards their boats. The captain expressed concern about the incoming round-shots, emphasizing the imminent danger. As we approached the shore, the ebbing tide was both helping and hindering our progress. The gun posed the greatest threat, but with a strong push, we managed to avoid the worst. The boat sank, but we were able to wade ashore safely. However, our supplies were lost, and only two guns were usable. Voices from the woods signaled approaching danger, leaving us vulnerable. We hurried towards the stockade, hoping Hunter and Joyce could hold their ground against the pirates.|"['1.

They exchanged weapons, and Trelawney, calm and collected as always, paused briefly to ensure everything was ready for action. Noticing that Gray was unarmed, I handed him my sword. Seeing him spit in his hand, furrow his brow, and skillfully wield the blade lifted our spirits. It was evident from his stance that our new crew member was skilled and reliable. As we approached the stockade, seven mutineers led by Job Anderson emerged. We managed to fire four shots, causing one of them to fall, and the rest fled into the trees. Suddenly, a shot rang out, narrowly missing me, and Tom Redruth fell wounded. Despite our return fire, we couldn't see the attacker. We then focused on helping Tom. The captain, laden with supplies, hoisted the British flag, offering us a sense of relief. He then counted the supplies, keeping an eye on Tom.

In the evening, the cannonballs kept flying over the enclosure. The shots buried themselves in the sand, making us feel safe from ricochets. The captain noted that the woods in front might be clear now that the tide was low, and our stores could be accessible. Gray and Hunter volunteered to retrieve supplies, but the mutineers, led by Silver, were already taking our provisions to a waiting boat. The loyal crew members, with limited rations, landed on Treasure Island, hoisting the British flag. Ben Gunn, a wise man, advised Jim on how to approach him for help, ensuring a secretive meeting.

He asked anxiously if I wouldn't forget. He mentioned precious sights and his own reasons. He emphasized the importance of personal reasons between individuals. Then, he allowed me to leave, warning me about the dangers posed by Silver and the pirates. Suddenly, a cannonball interrupted us, landing close by. Startled, we ran in different directions. The island was shaken by continuous reports and cannonballs. I cautiously moved around, avoiding the stockade area where the cannonballs fell. As the bombardment subsided, I regained some courage and cautiously made my way towards the shore. The HISPANIOLA ship was still anchored, with the Jolly Roger flag flying. After observing the chaos caused by the attack, I noticed an isolated white rock that might be the one mentioned by Ben Gunn for future reference. The log-house was constructed from pine trunks, with a unique iron basin under the porch. The surrounding area had been cleared for construction, leaving only a few green patches.|['1.

The chilly breeze blew through the simple building, filling it with sand. Sand was everywhere - in our eyes, teeth, suppers, and even dancing in the kettle. Gray had a bandage on his face from a cut, and poor Tom Redruth lay unburied. Captain Smollett kept us busy; dividing us into watches, assigning tasks, and lifting our spirits. We buried Tom, gathered firewood, and discussed our dwindling supplies. The plan was to weaken the mutineers, using rum and the climate to our advantage. The morning was cold and foggy, indicating an unhealthy island. The captain instructed us to be vigilant, and all hands prepared for any danger that may come our way.|"['1.

The captain, observing Silver's departure, commended Gray for his steadfastness. He reprimanded the others for neglecting their posts. The captain urged them to be prepared for a potential attack as Silver had threatened. Despite being outnumbered, the captain expressed confidence in their ability to defend themselves. The house had limited loopholes for defense, and muskets were distributed among the defenders. The captain assigned positions for each crew member, emphasizing the importance of discipline and readiness. Hawkins was reminded to eat his breakfast and return to his post. The doctor was instructed to guard the door, while others were assigned to specific sides of the house for defense.

As the captain mentioned, the cold was gone. When the sun rose above the trees, it shone brightly on the clearing, drying up the moisture quickly. The sand became hot, and the resin in the logs of the block house began to melt. Everyone removed their jackets and coats, rolled up their sleeves, and stood ready, feeling the intense heat and tension. We listened intently and scanned the surroundings for any signs of danger. Suddenly, Joyce fired his musket, followed by a volley of shots from all sides of the enclosure. Bullets hit the log-house, but none penetrated it. The attackers were silent, hidden. The captain anticipated an assault from the north, while shots were fired sporadically from the east and west. Pirates emerged from the north, leaping over the fence towards us. The attack intensified, with gunfire from the woods. The pirates closed in on us, and chaos ensued as they breached our defenses. Amidst the commotion, the doctor was attacked, but bravely fought back. In the heat of the moment, I grabbed a cutlass and rushed out to face the pirates in the sunlight.|['1.

I followed orders and turned to the east, holding my sword up, and dashed around the corner. Suddenly, I faced Anderson, who yelled and raised his weapon in the sunlight. Without time to fear, I dodged to the side, but slipped in the sand and tumbled down the slope. As I emerged from the house, the other mutineers were climbing the fence to attack us. Gray swiftly defeated the boatswain, and the doctor took down another. The battle was swift, and we emerged victorious. The attackers retreated, leaving behind fallen comrades. We tended to the wounded and mourned our losses. The mutineers dwindled in number as we secured our position. The captain, injured but stable, remarked on the improved odds. The attackers did not return, leaving us in peace to care for our wounded and reflect on the day's events.|"['1.

After dinner, the squire and the doctor talked with the captain. The doctor then prepared to leave, taking his gear and heading into the woods. Meanwhile, I envied the doctor's cool walk while I sweated in the heat. I decided to sneak out to explore the island. I filled my pockets with biscuits, planning to search for a hidden boat. I slipped away when no one was watching, heading towards the east coast. I reached the shore, hearing the sea's roar and feeling the cool breeze. The sea was never calm around Treasure Island. As I approached a white rock, the sun set, and fog rolled in. I had to find the boat quickly. Night fell as I reached the rock, discovering a tent made of goat-skins in a hidden dell.|"['1.

I found Ben Gunn's boat in a hollow. It was a small, homemade boat made of tough wood with a goat-skin covering. The boat was so tiny that it seemed it could barely hold a man. It had one low thwart, a stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle. It resembled an ancient Briton's coracle, light and portable. I planned to cut the HISPANIOLA loose to prevent the mutineers from escaping. As darkness fell, I set the coracle on the water. The boat was tricky to handle but buoyant. I managed to reach the anchored ship, the HISPANIOLA, by following the tide. However, cutting the hawser to set the ship adrift was risky due to the strong current. Luckily, a change in the wind helped slacken the hawser, giving me a chance to proceed with my plan.|"[""1.

I decided to act decisively, using my knife to cut the remaining strands holding the vessel. While I worked, I overheard loud voices from the cabin, belonging to Israel Hands, the coxswain, and my friend in the red night-cap, both clearly intoxicated. They were arguing fiercely, with oaths and threats filling the air. Despite their drunken state, they managed to avoid physical violence for the time being. Meanwhile, on the shore, a campfire glowed warmly as someone sang a melancholic sailor's song. As the coracle drifted towards the HISPANIOLA, I noticed a light cord trailing from the ship. Curiosity got the better of me, and I peered through the cabin window, witnessing a violent struggle between Hands and his companion. The ship's sudden change in direction and increased speed startled me, hinting at more trouble ahead.|"['1.

I woke up and saw ripples around me, glowing slightly in the dark. The HISPANIOLA ship swayed, and I noticed it veering southward. Glancing back, I saw the campfire's glow. The current turned sharply, carrying the ship and coracle towards the open sea. The ship suddenly veered, causing a commotion onboard. I crouched in the coracle, fearing for my life as we sped through the narrows. Exhausted, I succumbed to sleep, dreaming of safety. Upon waking, I found myself near Treasure Island, with cliffs and rough seas ahead. Sea lions barked on the rocks, deterring me from landing. Opting to head north to Cape of the Woods, I navigated the coracle cautiously, riding the waves with newfound confidence.|"[""1.

I was soaked and scared, falling back into my old spot on the coracle. It seemed to steer gently through the waves, ignoring any attempts to change its course. I was petrified but kept my composure. Carefully, I bailed out water with my cap. Observing the waves closely, I noticed their peaks and valleys. The coracle maneuvered through them, avoiding the steep slopes. I decided to lie still and occasionally paddle towards land. Slowly, I made progress towards the Cape of the Woods, battling thirst and exhaustion. Suddenly, I spotted the HISPANIOLA sailing nearby. As it changed direction erratically, I realized there was no one steering. Inspired by the adventure, I contemplated boarding the ship to return it to its crew. The current carried both vessels southward, but the schooner's unpredictable sailing gave me hope of catching up if I dared to paddle.|"[""1.

I rose from the water, greeted by a spray cloud, determined to chase after the unsteered HISPANIOLA. Despite rough seas, I paddled on, gaining on the ship. The schooner seemed deserted or its crew drunk below. The ship's sails caused it to drift away, but a moment came when it turned, offering me a chance. I leaped onto the bowsprit as the schooner struck my coracle, leaving me stranded. The ship's jib flapped, and I saw the empty deck, marked by mutiny. The ship lurched, and the main deck revealed itself.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did the narrator do after rising from the water?\nA) He decided to swim back to shore.\nB) He watched the ship from a distance.\nC) He chased after the HISPANIOLA.\nD) He gave up and let the ship drift away.\nE) He called for help.', 'Question 2:\nWhy did the narrator think the schooner seemed deserted?\nA) The crew was hiding below deck.\nB) The crew was busy repairing the sails.\nC) The crew was celebrating a successful voyage.\nD) The crew was asleep in their cabins.\nE) The crew had abandoned the ship due to mutiny.', 'Question 3:\nWhat happened when the narrator leaped onto the bowsprit?\nA) He was welcomed by the crew.\nB) He was struck by the coracle.\nC) He was able to steer the ship.\nD) He was left stranded on the ship.\nE) He was immediately rescued.', ""Question 4:\nWhat did the narrator see on the ship's main deck?\nA) Celebrating crew members.\nB) Mutinous crew members.\nC) Repairing crew members.\nD) Sleeping crew members.\nE) Rescuing crew members."", ""Question 5:\nWhat was the condition of the ship's sails?\nA) They were torn and tattered.\nB) They were brand new.\nC) They were being repaired.\nD) They were missing.\nE) They were flapping in the wind."", 'Question 6:\nWhat caused the narrator to be stranded on the ship?\nA) A sudden storm.\nB) A collision with the coracle.\nC) A rescue attempt gone wrong.\nD) A mutinous crew.\nE) A broken mast.']"|['C) He chased after the HISPANIOLA.', 'E) The crew had abandoned the ship due to mutiny.', 'B) He was struck by the coracle.', 'B) Mutinous crew members.', 'E) They were flapping in the wind.', 'B) A collision with the coracle.']
Two watchmen were on the ship, one with a red cap and stiff posture, and the other, Israel Hands, looking weak with his chin down. The ship rocked like a wild horse, sails filling on different tacks, and the boom swinging. Sprays of water hit the ship's bulwark, and heavy blows were felt as the ship rode the waves. Despite the rough seas, the watchmen remained unmoved. The ship was in disarray, lockfast places broken, and the floor muddy from ruffians. Barrels and bottles were missing or empty, showing signs of a mutiny. I found some brandy and food for Hands and took a drink before offering him the brandy. Hands mentioned the dead man, O'Brien, and offered to teach me to sail the ship in exchange for food, drink, and a bandage for his wound.|"['1.

It made sense to me, and we quickly agreed. In no time, the HISPANIOLA sailed smoothly along the coast of Treasure Island. The plan was to reach the northern point before noon, turn back to North Inlet, beach safely, and wait for the tide to land. I secured the tiller, then went below to fetch my mother's silk handkerchief. With my help, Hands tended to his wound and soon began to recover. The wind was in our favor, propelling us swiftly past the island's changing scenery. Despite my elation at being in command, the coxswain's unsettling behavior hinted at hidden motives. As the wind shifted west, we navigated towards the North Inlet, waiting for the tide to rise. During a meal, the coxswain cryptically suggested disposing of O'Brien, raising suspicions about his true intentions.|"['1.

I hurried down the ship's stairs making as much noise as possible, slipped off my shoes, tiptoed along the gallery, climbed the ladder to the forecastle, and peeked out cautiously. I knew he wouldn't expect to see me there, so I took every precaution. Unfortunately, my worst suspicions were confirmed. He had a knife stained with blood. It was clear he intended harm. He then retrieved the knife, hid it in his jacket, and returned to his spot on the deck. I realized I was his target. Although I couldn't predict his exact next move, I knew we both wanted the ship safely stranded. As I pondered this, I returned to the deck. Hands, weakened, looked at me, drank, and asked for tobacco. He spoke of his past and his belief in striking first.

We had a short distance left to sail, about two miles only. The entrance to the northern anchorage was tricky, being narrow and shallow, requiring skillful navigation due to its east-west orientation. I was a quick and efficient assistant, and Hands, our pilot, was exceptional. We maneuvered the schooner through the narrow passage with precision, dodging the banks effortlessly. As we passed the heads, the land enveloped us, resembling a river estuary with dense woodlands on the shores. At the southern end, we spotted a dilapidated shipwreck covered in seaweed and flourishing with shore bushes. While it was a melancholy sight, it indicated that the anchorage was peaceful. Hands instructed me on how to secure the ship, guiding me through the maneuvers with urgency and expertise as we approached the shore.|['1.

As I planned to evade, he stopped too; we both hesitated, making feints and movements. It was a game I knew well from home, but now my heart raced wildly. It was a boy's game, yet facing an injured sailor, my courage rose. I pondered the outcome, knowing I could prolong the encounter but saw no escape. Suddenly, the ship lurched, dumping water between the deck and bulwark. We capsized, the dead red-cap falling with us. I sprang up first, while Hands struggled with the body. I climbed the shrouds, escaping his reach. I quickly reloaded my pistol, surprising Hands. He realized the tables had turned, slowly climbing towards me. I aimed my pistols, and he hesitated. With a sudden move, he threw a knife, pinning me to the mast. In shock, I fired both pistols, and he fell into the water, dead.|['1.

I felt sick, faint, and terrified as hot blood ran over me. The dirk pinned my shoulder to the mast, burning like hot iron. The horror of falling into the water beside the coxswain petrified me. Clinging with aching nails, I shut my eyes to block the fear. Gradually, my mind calmed, and I regained composure. I tried to remove the dirk but failed, and a shudder freed me. I broke free and went back on deck. I tended to my wound and threw the dead man, O’Brien, overboard. The red cap floated as he plunged into the water. Alone on the ship, I secured the sails as evening approached. The schooner was in danger, but I did my best to secure it. The tide turned, the sun set, and shadows enveloped the anchorage. The ship settled, and I could only hope for the best.|['1.

I hurried forward and peered down. It seemed shallow enough, and clutching the cut rope securely, I cautiously lowered myself overboard. The water barely touched my waist; the sand was solid and marked with ripples, and I joyfully waded ashore, leaving the HISPANIOLA on its side, with the main-sail trailing in the bay. As the sun set and the breeze whispered through the pines, I was finally off the sea, successful in my venture. I headed towards the blockhouse and my companions, aiming to pass the river from the two-peaked hill. The wood was sparse, and I soon crossed the watercourse. Approaching where I had met Ben Gunn, the maroon, I walked cautiously, keeping watch on all sides. The night grew darker as I stumbled towards my destination. Suddenly, a faint moonlight illuminated the Spy-glass hill, guiding me towards the stockade, where a bright fire burned, casting a red glow through the trees. I cautiously approached, relieved to hear my friends snoring peacefully inside, ensuring all was well.|"['1.

At that moment, it was clear that their watch was terribly inadequate. Had it been Silver and his crew sneaking up on them, no one would have survived until morning. I realized the danger they were in due to the captain being injured. Regret flooded me for leaving them vulnerable with so few on guard. As I reached the door, the darkness inside obscured my vision. Amidst the snoring, an odd noise puzzled me. It was Captain Flint, Silver's green parrot, keeping a vigilant watch. The torch's red light revealed my worst fears: the pirates had taken over, and there was no sign of any captives. Only six buccaneers remained, some still drunk, one wounded. Long John, looking more serious than usual, asked for a light and then addressed me about joining their crew. I stood firm, hiding my despair, as Silver laid out the ultimatum.|"[""1.

"So far, everything was going well. My friends were still alive, and although I partly believed Silver's words about the cabin party being angry at me for leaving, I felt more relieved than upset by the news. ""I'm not saying you're in our control,"" Silver continued, ""but here you are, and you can count on it. I'm all for discussion; I've never seen any good come from threats.

""Do I need to respond then?"" I asked, my voice trembling. Despite his mocking tone, I felt the looming threat of death, my cheeks burning and my heart pounding in my chest. ""You might want to keep quiet until you're spoken to, my friend,"" Silver snapped at the other person. Then, in a more friendly tone, he said to me, ""Yesterday morning, Mr. Hawkins,"" he began, ""Doctor Livesey came with a flag of truce. 'Captain Silver, you're betrayed. The ship's gone.'

I paused, catching my breath, surprised to see that none of them moved. They all stared at me, unmoving like sheep. Breaking the silence, I addressed Mr. Silver, acknowledging him as the most capable among them. I requested that if things took a turn for the worse, he inform the doctor of my actions. Silver, in a commanding tone, warned against crossing him, citing the fate of those who dared defy him in the past.

Silver noticed the compass and pointed out the tip of Skeleton Island, indicating a line along the bones. The cook recognized the alignment with the Pole Star and potential treasure. The crew discussed the eerie scene, linking it to the notorious pirate Flint and his dark deeds. The pirates, spooked by the dead man's presence, moved cautiously through the woods. The plateau offered a view of the sea and surrounding landscape, enhancing the feeling of isolation. The crew identified landmarks to locate hidden treasure, all while feeling the weight of the dead man's presence.|"[""1.

Ever since they found the skeleton and began discussing it, their voices grew quieter until they were almost whispering, barely disturbing the silence of the woods. Suddenly, a thin, trembling voice broke the silence with a familiar song, startling the pirates. The color drained from their faces, some jumped up, and others clung to each other in fear. The song abruptly stopped, leaving an eerie silence. Silver, regaining his courage, urged the others to stay calm, dismissing the voice as someone playing a prank. But the voice called out again, this time with a distant cry for rum. The pirates were terrified, unable to comprehend the mysterious voice. John, trying to sound brave, questioned the nature of the voice, pointing out its unnatural echo. As they pondered the strange occurrence, Silver suggested they were mistaken in their assumptions, realizing the voice sounded more like someone else's than Flint's.|"['1.

"Their moods improved remarkably, and color returned to their faces. They chatted and listened as they walked, with Merry leading the way using Silver's compass towards Skeleton Island. Ben Gunn's presence seemed inconsequential to them, alive or dead. Silver remarked on the uselessness of a Bible for swearing, and Dick's health deteriorated rapidly, showing signs of fever from the heat and exhaustion. The group walked downhill across the island, passing tall trees and open spaces under the hot sun. The sight of the giant tree, a potential marker for the buried treasure of seven hundred thousand pounds, captivated their attention. The allure of the fortune overshadowed their fears, and Silver's greed became evident as he eyed the gold.

There was a sudden change in the situation, unlike anything ever seen before. Each of the six men was shocked by what had happened. However, Silver recovered quickly from the blow. His focus on the money was abruptly shattered, but he regained his composure and altered his plan before the others could react. He subtly moved northward, creating a divide between himself and the rest. Despite the unfriendly glances, Silver acknowledged the tight spot they were in. The buccaneers frantically dug in the pit, unearthing a two-guinea piece. Amidst the chaos, Silver faced accusations but remained composed.

In a relaxed manner, the group observed the survivors heading towards Mizzenmast Hill. Positioned strategically between the survivors and the boats, they took a breather. Long John caught up, and the doctor sent Gray to retrieve a pick-axe left behind by the mutineers. As they strolled downhill to the boats, the doctor shared a brief account of recent events. Ben Gunn, a marooned half-idiot, played a central role in the intriguing tale. He had discovered the treasure on the island, hidden it in a cave, and shared the secret with the doctor. Concerned about safety, they had swiftly relocated the treasure. The group then embarked on a journey, swiftly sailing over the sea towards Ben Gunn's treasure trove. Upon reaching the destination, they were met by the squire, signaling success and relief.|"['1.

Our last adventure on the island involved preparing to depart. We stored the treasure, packed enough water and remaining goat meat for emergencies. Finally, on a fine morning, we raised anchor, the same flag the captain fought under. As we sailed out of North Inlet, we spotted the three men kneeling on the sand, arms raised in supplication. Despite their plea, we couldn't risk a mutiny and left them with provisions. Heading to the nearest port, we were welcomed by friendly locals offering fruits and vegetables. The doctor and squire went ashore, and we met the captain of an English ship. Ben Gunn confessed that Silver had escaped with some treasure. Eventually, we returned home with only a few men, each using their share of the treasure wisely.|"['1.
