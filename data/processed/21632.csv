Mrs. Browning graciously accepted, trusting the boys' saving habits. She set meal times at seven for breakfast, twelve-thirty for lunch, and six for dinner. Pleased, the boys agreed on sharing expenses, with Dick paying five and a half dollars and Fosdick three and a half. They bought trunks, a new experience since they used to have all in drawers.

Fosdick and Dick were introduced, and to Dick's surprise, Fosdick could play the piano and sing beautifully. Dick expressed his aspiration for respectability, envisioning himself as a distinguished gentleman in the future. As they strolled along Broadway, they marveled at the illuminated shops and theaters.

Pleased with his transformation, Dick introduced Fosdick as his tutor, attributing his progress in literature and science to him. Mr. Whitney commended Dick's efforts and invited them to continue their conversation at the St. Nicholas Hotel.

"I am looking forward to joining Columbia College at the upcoming commencement. While I expect to be busy with studies, I will always make time for you and Fosdick. I hope both of you will visit me."" Both boys eagerly accepted the pre-invitation, and Dick pledged to write to Frank at his boarding school in Connecticut. Around half-past ten, the two boys departed from the St. Nicholas and returned to their boarding house. After a restful night's sleep, they promptly rose for a seven o'clock breakfast. They enjoyed beefsteak, hot biscuits, potatoes, and delicious coffee. Dick and Fosdick relished the meal, noting how much better it was compared to their usual restaurant fare. Following breakfast, Fosdick headed to the hat and cap store where he worked, while Dick went to Rockwell & Cooper's on Pearl Street. Initially feeling a bit shy in front of the grand warehouse, Dick overcame his nerves and entered the office to meet Mr. Rockwell."|"['1.

Mr. Rockwell warmly invited Richard to meet someone, explaining that his wife was eager to thank him for saving their son. He introduced Richard to his head clerk, expressing a genuine interest in Richard's well-being and offering guidance as he learned his new responsibilities. As Richard walked through the city, he encountered an old friend, Johnny, who shared his struggles as a boot-black. Richard generously helped Johnny financially and encouraged him to be more enterprising. Reflecting on his own journey from poverty to success, Richard realized how much his life had changed for the better. He then visited the New York Post-Office, where he retrieved some letters and encountered Roswell, a former rival who viewed Richard with condescension due to his humble background.|"['1.

"""Great job,"" said Dick, unfazed by Roswell's attitude. ""I now work wholesale and had to rent a big building on Pearl Street for my business. See these letters? They're all from wholesale clients.""

""No,"" replied Dick. ""I wouldn't want to. I'd fear you'd challenge me to a duel, and that wouldn't work as I haven't made my will. My heirs might fight over my vast estate.""

""That's my concern,"" mentioned Roswell, avoiding revealing his price. Thinking Dick would be impressed, he seemed incredulous. He couldn't grasp Dick's calmness or good humor. Despite possibly offending most boys, Dick responded casually, showing indifference to Roswell's opinion, which frustrated him.

It's important to note that the boys weren't lingering at the post office during this conversation. Dick knew his duty and promptly fetched the letters, some possibly urgent.

""I'm speaking for us both,"" said Dick. ""There's a twelve-year-old boy there who's been supporting his ill mother and sister for over a year, which is more commendable than anything you or I have done. How are you, Tom?"" he greeted the boy he mentioned.

Roswell had already left, unwilling to be seen conversing with a boot-black, fearing it would harm his reputation. Dick, however, was well-dressed, concealing his past job. Roswell, like many, struggled with pride, though he couldn't explain what he was proud of"|"['1.

Dick was kept busy throughout the day, impressing everyone at the establishment except the bookkeeper who seemed to have a dislike towards him. Despite this, Dick found his new living quarters in Bleecker Street comfortable and far better than his previous home in Mott Street. Mrs. Browning, their landlady, maintained a clean and orderly environment. Dick, once awkward at the dinner table, began to feel more at ease. His appearance improved as he took care to wash up before meals. Miss Peyton, a friendly face at the table, seemed to favor both boys. Dick, with his healthy complexion and strong build, stood out as the more handsome of the two. Henry, though delicate, had a quiet charm and honesty that drew people in. As the evening approached, the boys planned to dedicate time to study every night, aiming to better themselves despite their challenging pasts.|"['1.

Dick and his friend reached Union Square and strolled up Broadway to Madison Park. Near the park, they found an elegant house.

Mr. Rockwell praised Dick for his courage and stressed the importance of education for a successful future. Dick was surprised by the kindness and hospitality. The children, Johnny and Grace, engaged Dick in conversation, showing him pictures and asking amusing questions. As the clock neared ten, Dick was given an envelope to open later.

"Dick rushed home faster than when he had left. He imagined the surprise on Fosdick's face when he saw the new watch and chain. He also pictured the attention he would get at the table when he casually checked the time with his watch. ""I'm not sure,"" Dick thought. ""I'll save it in the bank until I decide. That'll be over eleven hundred dollars. I never thought I'd be worth that much back when I slept in boxes and old wagons.""

Mr. Clifton, who valued appearances and respected those who could afford them, had initially looked down on Dick. However, upon seeing Dick's elegant gold watch and chain, Clifton gained a newfound respect for him. Despite Clifton earning only slightly more than Dick, he spent extravagantly on clothes, unlike Dick.

The landlady was surprised by Dick's purchase, given his modest circumstances. This interaction reveals the dynamics among Dick's fellow boarders, including the good-natured but affected Miss Peyton. After breakfast, Dick felt empowered by the money in his pocket and sought advice on investing from Mr. Murdock, the head clerk.

During his work at the store, Dick's contentment was disrupted by the book-keeper's reprimand for reading the paper. Despite the book-keeper's attempt to assert dominance, Dick's confidence and lack of reverence surprised him, especially when he noticed Dick's impressive watch and chain for the first time."|"[""1.

Gilbert was surprised by Dick's mysterious behavior. He found it remarkable that a boy like Dick, especially considering his past work history as revealed by his cousin Roswell, would be gifted a gold watch. Gilbert, the bookkeeper, was puzzled by Mr. Rockwell's favoritism towards Dick, whom he considered impudent and was determined to get rid of. Despite this, Dick visited the Park Bank to cash a check made out to him. With the support of his employer and the cashier's recognition, Dick successfully received the money. Pleased with his deposit in the savings bank, Dick returned to work feeling fortunate. Mr. Murdock, a conscientious businessman, noticed Dick's dedication and decided to mentor him, disapproving of Gilbert's behavior.

"""I think I've found a good investment opportunity,"" Mr. Murdock shared. ""There's a person selling four adjacent lots on Forty-Fifth Street for twenty-two hundred dollars. He wants to sell them all together, but I offered a thousand dollars for two. It's a great deal because the development of Central Park is increasing property values in the area rapidly.""

""I can't buy something I can't pay for immediately. I have a family to support, so I save slowly. If it was just me, I'd jump at the chance.""

""I believe the owner might accept two thousand dollars down for all the lots, a thousand each. We both have that money. What do you think?""

""While it won't generate immediate income and we'll have to pay taxes, you could invest in bank stocks for annual interest. You need to choose the best option. The land might need to be held for a few years, paying taxes annually.""

""The city is expanding northwards quickly. Those lots could easily be worth a thousand dollars each in less than five years, providing a handsome return.""

""It seems Mr. Murdock and that boy are close,"" observed the book-keeper. ""I can't hear them, but they're deep in conversation. I wonder what they see in him.""

The book-keeper was curious about Dick's savings account but had no opportunity to ask. He returned to his work, feeling more biased against Dick.

At the end of the afternoon, Mr. Murdock and Dick traveled to Forty-Fifth Street to inspect the lots proposed for purchase. Situated between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, these lots measured twenty-five feet in width and one hundred feet in depth each. The four lots combined to form a plot of one hundred feet by one hundred, slightly less than a quarter of an acre. While this space might be considered small for a house and yard in the countryside, city dwellers must adapt to living in a more condensed environment. Mr. Murdock decided to promptly meet the owner that evening to negotiate the purchase, emphasizing the importance of seizing such a favorable opportunity without delay. Later, Mr. Clifton shared some personal anecdotes with Dick, revealing his confidence in his appearance and style, though he admitted financial struggles.

Mr. Layton suggested a study plan for Dick and Fosdick, focusing on algebra, history, and French. The boys committed to studying for an hour and a half each evening. Despite financial challenges, Fosdick was determined to learn and used his savings when needed. Dick offered to help, but Fosdick declined. As they progressed under Mr. Layton's guidance, Roswell Crawford, who looked down on Dick for his past as a boot-black, harbored resentment towards him. Roswell's family had faced financial struggles, and his mother, Mrs. Crawford, and cousin, Mr. Gilbert, shared his disdain for Dick's success. Unaware of the criticism, Dick remained focused on self-improvement, undeterred by others' opinions.

Roswell, a young man working in a dry goods store, felt discontent with his position. He believed he deserved better pay and resented carrying heavy bundles for customers. One day, while on an errand to deliver a letter for Mr. Rockwell, he encountered Dick, a fellow worker who seemed to have a more comfortable life. Roswell, feeling envious of Dick's appearance and better circumstances, decided to ask for a raise in his wages. Despite being a gentleman's son, Roswell felt that his current situation was unfair compared to Dick's. He planned to request a raise on Saturday, hoping for better compensation for his work.|"[""1.

Roswell, a young boy employed at the firm HALL & TURNER, felt disappointed when he asked Mr. Turner for a raise in his wages and was instead told that his job might be given to someone else. Despite his belief in his own capabilities, Mr. Turner saw him as just an errand boy. Roswell's pride was hurt, especially when he compared himself to a well-dressed boot-black who mocked him for carrying heavy bundles. Roswell's mother, however, believed in him. She reminded him that if his father were alive, their situation might have been different. Roswell wasn't content with his job, feeling that his status as a gentleman's son should earn him more respect. Despite the setbacks, he valued his mother's support and his own self-worth.|"[""1.

"There was a bit of an exaggeration about this, as Dick was far from gloating over Roswell; otherwise, he wouldn't have volunteered to carry the bundle himself. It's common for older individuals than Roswell to engage in a little misrepresentation now and then. After James Gilbert left the room, hope filled both Roswell and his mother. Roswell thought it would be satisfying to hear that Dick lost his job, even if he didn't secure it himself. Micky Maguire, known from ""Ragged Dick,"" had a prominent position among the downtown boot-blacks due to his strength, which he often used to bully weaker boys. He was a young troublemaker with few good qualities. Despite Micky's attempts to assert dominance over Dick, the latter, being respectful and capable of self-defense, thwarted Micky's efforts. Micky, clad in Dick's old clothes, eventually had to give them up due to their deteriorating condition.

Micky returned home to a rundown place on Worth Street, close to the Five Points House of Industry. This establishment greatly improved the area. At that time, the place was extremely dirty. Micky was pleased with his trick and shared the story with his friends. Unaware of James Gilbert's approach, Micky was surprised when Gilbert caught him. Instead of punishment, Gilbert offered Micky a job, surprising everyone. Fosdick and Dick were curious about mysterious letters they received, leading them to Mr. Greyson's daughter, Miss Peyton. Miss Peyton entered the scene with her ringlets, trying to charm the gentlemen. Dick joked about being open to marriage, showing his humorous side.|"['1.

"The boys left the table and headed to their room to review their evening lessons. They were happy with their new teacher, who was not only skilled but also dedicated to helping them progress. He assisted them with their challenges and motivated them to keep going. As a result, they began to anticipate their evening studies as enjoyable activities.""It's odd,"" remarked Dick one evening after the teacher had departed, ""I used to love going to the Old Bowery so much. Now, I'd much rather stay home and study."" A few days later, Dick was strolling through Chatham Street around half-past one. While he was allowed an hour for lunch, he was now on his way back from the eatery he usually visited. As he paused to observe something in a window, he sensed a disturbance nearby. Suddenly, he felt a hand in his pocket, withdrawing a wallet. Looking up, he spotted Micky Maguire darting away. He found himself holding the wallet, accused of theft, and escorted to the station by his accuser and a group of boys. Among them, Micky Maguire lingered at a distance. Despite past mistakes, Dick had never stolen, guided by an innate sense of right and wrong. Although he lacked moral guidance, he understood that stealing was wrong. His recent efforts to lead a respectable life made the false accusation all the more distressing.

After Dick penned a letter to his friend Mr. Murdock, explaining his unfortunate arrest for pickpocketing, he reached out to his dear friend Fosdick from the station-house. He shared the distressing turn of events that landed him in this predicament. Dick's worry grew as he considered how his absence would be perceived at the boarding-house and by his acquaintances like Miss Peyton and Mr. Clifton. Despite the grim situation, he hoped for a favorable outcome. Feeling the weight of uncertainty, Dick contemplated the potential consequences of failing to prove his innocence and the possibility of being sent to the Island.

Dick was feeling miserable at the thought of being mistaken for a pickpocket by Ida. Despite being too young for love, he admired her vivacity and company. The possibility of missing out on a party invitation due to his arrest added to his unhappiness. Unaware of the plot against him, Dick never suspected Micky or Gilbert's involvement. Meanwhile, Micky, reveling in his success, planned to inform Gilbert about Dick's situation. He anticipated a reward for his scheme and had his eye on a five-dollar silver watch as a personal upgrade. As Gilbert saw Micky approaching, his demeanor changed, showing a different side to his young accomplice. He agreed to a shoeshine but urged Micky to be quick.|"['1.

Micky was correct in feeling dissatisfied with the small sum he received for the risk he took, which made Gilbert appear mean and lacking generosity. Gilbert, expecting praise for his supposed generosity, was irritated by Micky's ingratitude. Mr. Murdock, understanding Gilbert's animosity towards Dick, planned to visit Dick later that day. As Mr. Murdock pondered the situation, he wondered if Gilbert and Micky were working together against Dick. Gilbert, curious about Tim Ryan's visit to Mr. Murdock, refrained from asking questions. Later, Mr. Murdock visited the station-house where Dick was held, a clean contrast to the surrounding rundown area.
