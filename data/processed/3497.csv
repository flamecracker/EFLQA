At five o'clock the following morning, Father and Mother Adolf were already awake, and the cuckoo's call stirred Fritz, but his attempts to wake Seppi and Leneli were in vain. He tried tickling Leneli's toes and shaking Seppi, but they slept soundly. Eventually, he resorted to pulling Seppi from bed, causing a ruckus that woke Leneli and the baby. Mother Adolf, drawn by the commotion, found Seppi on top of Fritz, playfully wrestling. She shared the exciting news that Father had been chosen to take the village herds to the high alps for the summer, with Fritz accompanying him. Overjoyed, Fritz somersaulted with delight. However, the responsibility of caring for their goats fell to Seppi and Leneli. Despite the challenges, the family resolved to face the summer bravely.

Leneli was sulking because she had no lunch, but Bello comforted her by sitting beside her and licking her hand. Fritz offered her a slice of bread and planned to ask their mother for more food the next day. When they tried to milk Nanni, the goat evaded them by climbing a cliff. Fritz cleverly coaxed Nanni down with salt. He advised Seppi not to get into such tight spots, as it's wiser to avoid trouble.

On a bright morning, the cattle were ready to head up to the high alps for the summer. The little gray farm-house was bustling with activity as everyone prepared for the journey.

Fritz gave his little horn to Seppi, urging him to blow it. Seppi, unable to play Fritz's tune, blew a loud sound, guiding Bello to the goats. Bello, usually playful, walked solemnly beside Leneli. Seppi wisely noted that Bello knew more than many people. They all reached the pasture, where Leneli knitted, and Bello watched the goats. Seppi tried to play the horn, but it only made a loud noise.

Seppi and Leneli sat high on the mountain, watching the clouds gather around the peaks. The goats grazed peacefully as the air grew warm. Suddenly, wisps of clouds enveloped the mountaintops, signaling an impending storm. Seppi reassured Leneli as thunder rumbled and lightning flashed below. As rain poured down, they sought shelter under a rock with their faithful dog, Bello, and the goats. Amidst the storm, a terrifying rumble echoed through the mountains. Leneli recognized it as an avalanche, a deadly force feared by all. The children clung together in fear as the world seemed to tremble.

Seppi and Leneli found themselves in a challenging situation on the mountain. An avalanche had blocked their path home, leaving them stranded with their goats. Despite the looming danger, Seppi took charge and decided to keep blowing his horn periodically while Leneli responded by blowing on a grass stem. This communication method was their way of staying connected as Seppi ventured off to seek help.

Leneli, feeling scared and lost on the mountain, prayed to God for help to find her way down before dark. She heard Seppi's horn in the distance, signaling his presence. Seppi suggested they eat to gain strength and continue their journey. As they walked, the path became wilder, and they worried about bears and wolves. Seppi reassured Leneli that the predators would likely go after the goats instead. Just as they thought they might have to spend the night on the mountain, they saw a herdsman playing a hymn on his horn. This sight comforted them, knowing their family was also praying.

After finishing their prayers, the children hurried onward, urging the goats ahead, as cow-bells jingled alongside the goats' bells. A bend in the path revealed a lush meadow where cows grazed, and nearby stood a rustic shelter with the herdsman, holding his horn, looking surprised to see two children alone on the mountain so late. He was an elderly man with a bushy white beard and curious eyes. Beside him, his dog growled. Initially hesitant, the children were reassured by their friendly dog, Bello, who greeted the herdsman's dog warmly. The herdsman, noticing their hunger, offered them shelter for the night and milked the goats while the children ate.

At midnight, the Austrians attacked through the stable floor, but the brave men of Lucerne, led by Peter, defeated them, driving them out of town forever. The herdsman encouraged Seppi and Leneli, telling them this was their chance to be heroes. They spent the night in the hayloft and were woken by the herdsman for an early start. The children washed up, had breakfast, and set off on their dangerous journey. The herdsman gave them food and advice, pointing them towards the path.

After a loud noise, the forest fell silent, and the children halted their race, but the goats continued on with Bello close behind. The children knew their father had stressed the importance of the goats for their family's well-being. Following the goats through the forest, they reached a cliff edge where the goats huddled, distressed. Suddenly, a golden eagle swooped down, trying to snatch one of the goats. In a brave move, Seppi saved the goat with help from Leneli. The children then herded the goats away from danger and found a stream for them to drink.

"Leneli seemed unsure. ""I'm worried we won't find the Pass,"" she said. ""We could end up like Moses, never reaching our goal. Hunters might find our bones scattered here."" She teared up at the thought. Seppi stood up, looking serious. ""We won't end up as bones,"" he declared. ""I'll lead us and the goats down this mountain."" Suddenly, an idea struck him. ""The stream flows downhill. If we follow it, we'll reach the valley,"" he realized. The journey wasn't easy. The stream cut through rocks, obstructed by fallen trees. But finally, they reached a waterfall. Below, they spotted farm buildings and villages. Seppi found a way across, leading the caravan to safety.

Seppi and Leneli ventured into the forest, following the sound of a waterfall. Pushing through underbrush and over rocks, they finally emerged from the dense trees to a breathtaking view of green slopes adorned with daffodils and gentians. The goats happily grazed on the fresh pastures as the tired children rested beside them. Seppi, noticing the glacier and river ahead, realized they needed to cross it.

To reach the other side, Seppi and Leneli crossed a natural ice bridge over a deep chasm. Seppi, though fearful, led the way, urging Leneli and their goats to follow. Carefully stepping with his stick, Seppi made it across first. Leneli and the goats soon joined him, relieved. As they continued, Bello the dog showed excitement, sensing their journey's end.

The children left the farmer's wife's house after a hearty meal and a warm farewell. They embarked on a long journey back home, filled with eagerness and determination to reunite with their worried mother.

Their mother was nowhere to be found, and the house was still and empty. Despite their initial shock and disappointment, the children refused to believe the worst. They searched every nook and cranny, calling out for their mother, but only the sound of Bello barking and Nanni playing in the garden echoed around them.

Leneli fell to the step, crying, wondering if their mother was lost on the mountain. Overwhelmed, she sobbed. Despite fatigue, they rose to start anew, the sun setting. As they turned the house corner, Seppi pointed to their mother and Baby Roseli on the goat-path. They dashed up to meet her, relieved. The mother, tearful, embraced them, relieved they were safe. Seppi blew the horn, signaling their safety. Villagers rejoiced, bells ringing, horns sounding. Neighbors gathered, grateful for their return. After sharing their adventures, they prayed, giving thanks. The cuckoo clock chimed, signaling bedtime. The mother tucked the children in, then retired herself. In the quiet house, the cuckoo peeked out, the moonlight casting shadows, as the night settled in.|"['1. What caused Leneli to cry and wonder if their mother was lost on the mountain?\nA.
