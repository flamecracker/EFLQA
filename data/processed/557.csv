"The kids performed a play based on Shakespeare's ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" at the Theatre in a meadow called the Long Slip. Dan played Puck, Nick Bottom, and the Fairies, while Una portrayed Titania. The stage was a Fairy Ring of darkened grass in the middle of the bend of a millstream. The setting was so perfect that even Shakespeare couldn't have imagined a better one. They acted beautifully, remembering all their lines. After their performance, they heard a whistle and saw a small, brown, pointy-eared person with a freckled face. He introduced himself as a resident of Pook's Hill and praised the kids for their exceptional performance, claiming they had broken the Hills, something that hadn't happened in a thousand years."|"[""1.

Long ago, when people bought and sold land, a tradition was to hand over a clod of earth to seal the deal. Only then would the land truly belong to the buyer. Puck, a magical being, explained this to two youngsters by giving them turves and declaring them rightful possessors of Old England. Puck assured them they could explore freely and witness events from the past without fear or doubt. He distinguished real magic from the fanciful creatures depicted in stories, recounting a tale of Sir Huon and his troop braving a storm with the aid of powerful magic.

Long ago, many Gods arrived in England with various ancient tribes like the Phoenicians, Gauls, Jutes, Danes, Frisians, and Angles. These Gods demanded sacrifices and worship, but as time passed, people grew tired of their demands. One particular God, Weland the smith, was left behind by his fellow deities and had to find his own way to survive. Puck, a mischievous spirit, witnessed the decline of these once-powerful Gods as they lost their followers and temples. He recalls encounters with different Gods who eventually faded into obscurity or took on new forms to adapt to changing times.

He insulted me and dismissed me, so I decided to go and inform the people inland. However, the pirates took control of the land, and for many years Weland was a highly revered deity. He had temples scattered all over, from Lincolnshire to the Isle of Wight, and his rituals were quite scandalous. To be fair, he favored horses over humans, but I knew that eventually, like the other ancient beings, his influence would diminish. I gave him ample time, around a thousand years, and after that period, I visited one of his temples near Andover to check on his status. The scene at the temple was peculiar, with fake sacrifices and a lackluster atmosphere. Eventually, Weland disappeared, and a Christian bishop took his place in the church at Andover. Puck recalled an encounter with Weland at a ford near Pook's Hill, where he witnessed the deity disguised as a blacksmith.|"[""1.

Once upon a time, a farmer and a novice had an unexpected encounter. The farmer was ungrateful for the help he received and accused the novice of worshipping heathen Gods. In a fit of anger, the novice showed his strength by tossing the farmer off his horse. Despite the farmer's rudeness, the novice thanked the oak tree for its kindness and charity. The novice then received a special gift from a skilled blacksmith named Weland. Weland crafted a magnificent sword with magical runes and prophesies. The novice, thrilled with his gift, displayed it proudly. The Abbot, impressed by the novice's actions, allowed him to keep the sword and praised his courage and kindness.

Puck stood at the edge of the meadow near Pook's Hill, observing the tranquil surroundings. The meadow was peaceful, with the sound of a corncrake in the nearby hay-field and the brook's small trouts leaping. As a white moth fluttered around the children, a faint mist rose from the brook. Puck asked if they truly wanted to know more, promising to reveal events that occurred thousands of years ago. However, he suggested returning home before they were missed. Reciting a verse about the significance of Oak, Ash, and Thorn trees, Puck accompanied the children towards the gate. The passage then describes a fishing excursion in a brook with overhanging trees, creating tunnels of sunlight. The children's secret fishing spot, shown to them by old Hobden, was a hidden haven. Upon reaching an open area near a weir, they were surprised to encounter a majestic grey horse drinking from the pool, ridden by an old man in medieval attire.|"[""1.

"""Pardon me,"" Sir Richard said to Dan. ""When these lands were mine, I never wanted mounted men to cross the brook except by the paved ford.

At Santlache, beyond the hill in the distance towards Fairlight, we encountered Harold's soldiers. A battle ensued, and by day's end, Harold's men fled. Following the skirmish, my troops joined De Aquila's forces for pursuit and plunder. Engerrard of the Eagle fell in the pursuit, and his son Gilbert assumed command. Unaware of these events due to attending to an injured comrade, I encountered a lone Saxon by a brook. Despite engaging in combat, I refrained from delivering a fatal blow when the Saxon's sword slipped from his grasp. Grateful for sparing his life, the Saxon guided me through the woods to safety, saving me from other Saxons. Reaching his abode, the Saxon's sister, Lady Aelueva, initially hostile, relented upon learning of the mercy shown to her brother. Despite our past conflict, a sense of camaraderie emerged as we faced the trials of that fateful night.|"[""1.

I was exhausted but sincerely prayed for my classmate Hugh's health. Around midday, I heard horses approaching, and the three men untied me and quickly left as De Aquila's men arrived. Gilbert de Aquila, a fierce man with eagle-like features, including a sharp nose and piercing yellow eyes, came with his men. He rode powerful warhorses, bred by himself, and detested help mounting. Seeing the rope hanging, he and his men laughed, finding me too stiff to stand. The knight, De Aquila, admired a woman named Lady Aelueva, hinting at a plan to save her and her home through a jest. Despite my shaky voice, I acknowledged the Saxons' courtesy. De Aquila chuckled at the situation, deeming it a miracle that a young knight like me had taken charge of the Manor. He decided to grant me the Manor until his return or my demise, as we set off to support the Duke in Kent. He warned me of the challenges ahead but advised me to use wit and cunning to navigate them wisely. As he rode off, he left me with a daunting task to hold the Manor against all odds, emphasizing the importance of strategic thinking over reckless fighting.

Dan and Una set out on a peaceful boating adventure on the brook one hot afternoon. They named their dinghy the Daisy, but for their explorations, it became the Golden Hind or the Long Serpent. Dan used a boat-hook to guide the boat while Una punted with a piece of hop-pole.

Once upon a time, a man named De Aquila held the Manor while another man went on a journey after Lady Aelueva passed away. De Aquila, an old Warden of Pevensey, rode tall, roan horses and looked like a little white falcon in the saddle. When Hugh at Dallington heard of this, he gave his second son the Manor of Dallington to hold. While riding with De Aquila, a Marsh man warned of a black goat carrying the King's body, and shortly after, King Red William died. De Aquila suspected trouble and prepared for a fight. Despite signs and omens, the man and Hugh boarded a wine-ship bound for Bordeaux. However, fate took a turn when a Dane ship collided with them in the mist, causing Hugh to fall overboard. They were captured by the Danes, but a Yellow Man freed them from their bonds.|"[""1. What was De Aquila's occupation?\nA) Blacksmith\nB) Warden of Pevensey\nC) Farmer\nD) Baker\nE) Carpenter"", '2.

The bright land stretched to our left, the gray sea to our right. Despite being a knight, I rowed with the crew, gathering seaweed to cushion the fragile pots. Knighthood suits the land, not the sea where a man is like a rider without reins. I honed my skills at sea, learning to tie secure knots and mend ropes discreetly.

Our ship needed care, even burning off seaweed. The ship's bird was a marvel, knowing all the rowers by name. Our journey led us to a strange land of black people offering goods for iron wedges.

In the midst of unfamiliar terrain, we stumbled upon a welcoming village beside a broad river after losing track of time. Grateful for the sight of the sun, the villagers greeted us warmly. Witta, enticed by the villagers' display of gold, showcased our iron and beads. They brought forth gold bars and dust, along with large elephant tusks. However, a towering figure, taller than a man and covered in reddish hair, emerged from the forest. He beat his chest fiercely and gnashed his teeth, alarming us. Hugh swiftly shot an arrow, hitting the creature in the throat. Three other beings swiftly took him away. Despite the tempting gold on the bank, we hesitated to step ashore, wary of the mysterious beings. Witta, bold and clever, devised a plan to approach the gold cautiously, but fear gripped the crew, preventing them from venturing ashore.

Fulke, a wise man with a bald head, assured De Aquila that no harm would come to him or his land. De Aquila, in turn, decided that his son would copy out the tale of Fulke's life as a form of penance. This story would spread far and wide, entertaining many. As Fulke left under the King's banner, he appeared grand and noble. De Aquila accompanied him to the New Mill landward before returning. The events of the night seemed like a dream. Sir Richard recounted how Fulke's actions prevented any repercussions from the King. Despite De Aquila's son causing mischief, he grew fond of the old men at the keep. Eventually, his father came to take him home, but the boy was reluctant to leave due to his love for hunting.

"Dan had struggled with his Latin and was held back, so Una ventured alone to Far Wood.

Pook's Hill lay beneath her, with the winding brook meandering out of the Willingford Woods, through hop-gardens, towards old Hobden's cottage at the Forge.

Una retrieved Dan's catapult from its hidden spot and prepared to face Lars Porsena's army sneaking through the wind-rustled aspens by the brook. A gust surged up the valley, and Una sang mournfully: ""But the wind, not charging fair to the wood, started aside and shook a single oak in Gleason's pasture.

Allo warned us of danger, and we hastily retreated under the moonlight, back to safety near the ruins. The next morning, as we awoke stiff and cold, Allo prepared our meal cautiously, wary of alerting the Picts with smoke signals.

They climbed up Long Ditch into the lower end of Far Wood, a place sadder and darker than Volaterrae end. An old marl-pit filled with black water sits there, surrounded by weepy, hairy moss on the stumps of willows and alders. Despite the gloom, birds perch on the dead branches, and Hobden claims the bitter willow-water is a remedy for sick animals. Puck suddenly emerges, comparing the scene to a story about little Picts. Parnesius recounts an event when Maximus unexpectedly arrived at Segedunum on the Wall's East end, leading to two days of Games. The atmosphere was tense, with the garrison demanding things from Maximus. Parnesius explains the delicate balance of power, likening it to wolves in a cage. The narrative unfolds in the Temple of Victory, where Maximus issues strict orders, placing the boys in charge of the Wall's defense.|['1. What is the setting described in the passage?\nA.

In the spring, strong East winds brought many ships near Segedunum. Allo vowed to capture a tower in open combat. A fierce battle ensued, lasting a whole day. After the fight, a man swam ashore from a wrecked ship. Parnesius, noticing a medal on the man, spoke a secret question related to the Mithras god. The man gave the correct response, revealing his allegiance to the same degree of Gryphons. Parnesius shielded him until he could stand. The man chose to leave on a ship waiting at sea, a gesture of friendship from the Winged Hats. Allo suggested that Parnesius and Pertinax could lead the Winged Hats to support the Emperor in Gaul.

Allo conveyed a message to the Winged Hats proposing peace to avoid further losses. They accepted, allowing safe passage for corn-ships to the Picts. The Picts, somewhat considered his children, were well-fed that winter. With only 2000 men on the Wall, he repeatedly requested reinforcements from Maximus, who was preoccupied with his victories in Gaul. News of Gratian's defeat by Maximus led to a request for more men, but Maximus deferred due to ongoing uncertainties with Theodosius. Despite the peace, Parnesius felt vulnerable and requested more troops and catapults. Maximus, focused on potential threats from Theodosius, could not spare additional men. The Wall remained peaceful, but Parnesius was aware of its vulnerability against the Winged Hats, who were steadily growing stronger.|"['1.

Thus, gradually, day by day, the War unfolded. Initially, the Winged Hats attacked from the sea, but we repelled them with our catapults. They hesitated to venture on land, fearing to reveal their secrets. They served as both spies and foes, oppressed by the Winged Hats. 

Later, the enemy encroached from both ends of the Wall. We faced challenges with supplies and foraging. We lived in the saddle, eating our tired ponies. The townspeople caused unrest until we consolidated them behind Hunno. 

As the conflict intensified, the fighting centered near the statue of Roma Dea. Rutilianus, once underestimated, displayed surprising valor.

A letter was read, offering a choice: serve Theodosius for a Legion or return home for a Triumph. Hobden whispered, pondering Mus' Reynolds. Rome's heavy hooves tread without care, causing harm. The Little Folk, too small to love or hate, plot behind Rome's sentries, waiting to reconquer the Wall with tongues as swords. They work unseen, like mistletoe on an oak.

"""I won't harm you, young man,"" Hal reassured, while Puck laughed loudly.
