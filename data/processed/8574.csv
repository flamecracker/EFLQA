Once upon a time, there were two doll families - one that was cherished and another that was neglected. Little did people know that dolls are not as still as they seem. When no one is watching, they come to life, dancing, singing, and playing. Fairies, who visit agreeable dolls, avoid those that are proud or ill-tempered. In a nursery corner, Racketty-Packetty House stood, overshadowed by the grand Tidy Castle. Cynthia, the owner, favored the new castle, leaving the old dollhouse behind the door. Racketty-Packetty House, filled with memories and old-fashioned charm, was once treasured by Cynthia's Grandmamma. However, as neglect set in, the doll family and their Victorian attire fell into disrepair. Despite their faded glory, the Racketty-Packetty House family had known better days, cherished by fairies and loved by Cynthia's Grandmamma.|"['1.

In the attic, Meg, Peg, and Kilmanskeg hurried downstairs, rolling all the way to the drawing-room.
