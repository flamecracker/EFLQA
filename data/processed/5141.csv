Elsie and John arrived at the peculiar house, where the lack of trees and green grass made it seem like it was standing on tip-toe, gazing at the dust in the road.

"John directed them upstairs, and Elsie sadly watched Alexander drive away. Feeling abandoned by their last friend, she and Johnnie followed Isaphiny to the hot spare chamber under the roof. The room smelled stale, and Elsie struggled to open the window. After a loud crash, she managed to open it but faced a challenge with a blue paper shade. With some effort, she pinned the shade up. The room, though plainly furnished, was neat. The children inspected the room and found a pincushion with ""Remember Ruth"" pinned on it. John found it amusing, but Elsie was dismayed at the thought of sleeping on a feather bed for two nights. At tea, where the butter was melting and flies buzzed around, Elsie couldn't eat due to the stifling heat.

"Elsie felt overwhelmed with homesickness and guilt for feeling that way. She struggled to sleep in the stifling room, disturbed by the noisy surroundings. Despite trying to distract herself with a book, the uncomfortable lounge made her restless. She accidentally fell off it twice, making her nervous.

The family gathered on the porch, welcoming the absentees with hugs and kisses. They shared stories of the past two days: a letter from Cousin Helen, Daisy White's kittens, Dorry's water-wheel invention, and Phil's chicken swap.

Katy's father introduced a tall gentleman and a stylish lady, Mrs. Page, who was surprised by how much Katy had grown. Mrs. Page preferred to be called Cousin Olivia and made Katy feel uncomfortable with her scrutinizing gaze. During supper, Dr. Carr praised Katy's housekeeping skills, making her blush with delight until Mrs. Page's judgmental look made her uneasy. The evening continued with Mrs. Page telling lively stories but with the children feeling like they were being watched and judged. The next morning, Mrs. Page commented on Katy's serious demeanor, contrasting her with her own bubbly daughter, Lilly.

"""My dear, that's the very thing I complain of: you don't know it! You are altogether ahead of your age. It's very bad for you, in my opinion. All this housekeeping and care, for young girls like you and Clover, is wrong and unnatural. I don't like it; indeed I don't."" This was unpleasant; but what was worse had Katy known it, Mrs. Page attacked Dr. Carr upon the subject. He was quite troubled to learn that she considered Katy grave and careworn, and unlike what girls of her age should be. Katy caught him looking at her with a puzzled expression. ""I'm afraid you don't,"" said Dr. Carr, with an odd sigh, which set Katy to wondering. What should papa sigh for? Had she done any thing wrong? She began to rack her brains and memory as to whether it could be this or that; or, if not, what could it be? Such needless self-examination does no good. Katy looked more ""solemn"" than ever after it. Altogether, Mrs. Page was not a favorite in the family. She had every intention of being kind to her cousin's children, ""so dreadfully in want of a mother, poor things!"" but she could not hide the fact that their ways puzzled and did not please her; and the children detected this, as children always will.

"""Yes, I agree,"" Dr. Carr replied softly. ""Listen, Katy, don't be too upset, my dear. I've carefully considered the plan, and it seems like a good idea, even though it pains me to be apart from you. Your cousin is right: the responsibilities at home are aging you prematurely. I don't want to see you lose your youth to worries. I want you to enjoy being young and not feel old before your time.""""The girls jokingly call it 'The Nunnery.'

"""Dad, please don't make us leave. I promise to be lively and not grow old or anything boring if we can stay. Cousin Olivia doesn't know what she's talking about. Cousin Helen would agree,"" pleaded Katy. ""Actually, Helen approves of the plan; she just wishes the school was closer,"" replied Dr. Carr. ""No, Katy, don't persuade me. I've made up my mind. It will benefit you and Clover, and once you settle at Hillsover, you'll be happy,"" he explained. Katy understood her father's firmness and stopped asking. She went to share the news with Clover, and they both shed tears. But after wiping their eyes, they saw a brighter side to the plan. ""Don't worry, darling,"" Katy said. ""Imagine how nice it will be to exchange letters. I'll write to you every Saturday. Get the atlas, please, and let's see where we're heading."" Elsie fetched the atlas, and the girls eagerly traced their journey route. It looked so exciting! They traced the railroad, winding through several states, with towns and villages along the way. As the route curved northward beside the Connecticut River and toward the hills, they anticipated the beauty of the Connecticut valley.

Getting ready for school in Hillsover was a big task. Mrs. Hall, kind and wise, helped with sensible advice. Dr. Carr ensured the girls had warm clothes. They prepared for both winter and summer, as they wouldn't be home for the fall break, spending it with Mrs. Page instead. Christmas plans were dashed due to the long journey. The girls received gifts, including watches from Papa. Elsie got watch cases, and Johnnie and Clover gifted pencils and a pen-knife. Miss Petingill gave useful items.

The previous night had a somber tone for Elsie. She had been so engrossed in packing that she hadn't fully grasped the reality of her departure. However, as she began to lock the trunks, her composure faltered. Overwhelmed with sorrow, her distress infected everyone around her. Just then, a package arrived from Cousin Helen, timely as always. Inside were two lovely silk umbrellas, one brown and one dark-green, each personalized with the initials of Katy and Clover. The discovery of these gifts lifted the family's spirits, distracting them from their sadness. The next morning was a flurry of activity as they prepared to leave, leaving no time for tears.

"""Why not? Don't you know how famous they are for waffles at this hotel? I thought everyone knew that,"" Lilly said as she ordered waffles with confidence.

The strict rules at the Nunnery prevent girls from having male visitors without parental permission. The protagonist wanted her mother to allow George Hickman, who is not a first cousin but related through marriage, to visit. Despite many younger girls having male visitors, the protagonist's mother deemed her too young. The girls discuss the different rows at the Nunnery: Attic Row is favored for its distance from Mrs. Florence, while Quaker Row is also decent. They reminisce about Berry Searles, the president's son, who would entertain the girls by trying to make them laugh during silent study hours.

The elegant Mrs. Florence, a respected figure at the school, commands attention with her tall stature and exquisite attire. Her eyes, usually lovely, turn fearsome when angered, as described by Rose Red. As the train journeyed northward, the scenery transformed into a picturesque landscape with green grass and budding trees. The river meandered alongside the road, framed by blue hills in the distance. Katy and Clover marveled at the beauty, reveling in the cool, invigorating air. Lilly expressed concerns about the lack of privacy in the crowded room, feeling homesick and out of place.

Clover observed Rose Red, whose face captivated her. She likened it to a pink carnation or a twinkling wild rose with brown calyx whiskers. Rose Red's words and actions had a distinct charm. Her blue eyes sparkled mischievously, and her cheeks were soft and round like a baby's, dimpling when she laughed. Rose Red's pretty head was like a flower on a stem, exuding a unique aura. Despite the laughter and noise around her, Clover could only catch snippets of Rose Red's witty remarks. The girls laughed uproariously, and Rose Red expressed her annoyance at Lilly Page for not introducing them. Later, Katy and Clover returned to the hotel, grateful for a quiet evening with their father after the day's chaos and Lilly's chatter. They realized the Nunnery would be different from their expectations but far from dull, especially with Rose Red around. The night passed quickly, and the next morning, Katy and Clover were awakened by the sounds of the day. They discussed the location of the Nunnery, eager to explore their new surroundings. After breakfast, Dr. Carr took them for a walk to the school, with Clover and Katy on either side. The school building was tall and narrow, with dormer windows and a porch supported by whitewashed pillars.

"The room they entered was filled with antique, bulky furniture, stiffly arranged. The sofa and chairs were draped in black haircloth, tightly pressed against the wall. Books were neatly stacked two by two on the table, forming perfect right angles. Dried grasses adorned the fireplace, and the only painting was a stern portrait of an elderly man in a wig and glasses, pointing imperiously at a half-open Bible. It was not a welcoming room, making Katy, who was sensitive about spaces due to her seclusion, gravitate closer to her father. Two women stood up to greet them. One was Mrs. Florence, tall and poised, while the other was introduced as ""my assistant principal, Mrs. Nipson,"" a shorter woman with a round face and sharp eyes. Dr. Carr, surprised that the teacher he had heard about was considering leaving, asked about the timing of her departure. Mrs. Florence deftly shifted the conversation to the girls' classes and suggested showing them their room upstairs. She mentioned that Lilly Page, who claimed to be their cousin, might have described the house's layout. She led them through an uncarpeted hallway to a room with rows of wash-bowls and pitchers on shelves, revealing it as the dreaded wash-room. Beyond it was a long, well-lit hallway with numbered doors. At No. 6, Mrs. Florence paused."|['1.

Clover gladly accepted Rose's invitation to walk with her, feeling honored by the popular girl's request.

Lilly stumbled over her words, feeling scared by Clover's stern gaze. She tried to explain that Katy's mature behavior made them mischievous girls cautious. Katy, blushing, wasn't preaching but simply pointing out how scandalous their actions might seem to their mothers. The next day, Saturday, was packed with chores, gym practice, tidying up, and letter writing. Miss Jane instructed Katy to bring specific items for the bath and emphasized punctuality. Rose Red made faces and snide remarks about Miss Jane, causing laughter among the girls. During the bath outing, Rose's behavior led to a scolding from Miss Jane.

"""Yes, ma'am, I have them all,"" replied Rose confidently, touching her hat. She had the crash towel hanging like a veil, the sponge pinned like a cockade, and a pink soap cake pinned on a black velvet bow. Miss Jane quickly removed these adornments, hinting at Mrs. Florence's opinion of Rose's behavior. The bath-house had eight small rooms with hot and cold water. Despite the nice bath, Katy worried about their walk home looking silly with sponges and damp towels. Later, Rose had a long talk with Mrs. Florence, leaving with red eyes. She later sent a note expressing her struggle to be good. Katy learned from Clover that Rose had a playful past with the Hillsover boys, but now they were dignified acquaintances. Katy felt relieved that Rose, despite her mischievous behavior, still carried herself like a proper lady."|"['1.

At Hillsover, Katy and Clover quickly settled into their new life, feeling like they had been there for years within just six weeks. They stayed busy, making time fly by with various activities. They befriended Ellen Gray and Louisa Agnew, which caused some jealousy in Lilly. Katy struggled to share Clover with Rose Red initially but eventually grew fond of Rose. Despite Rose's mischievous nature, her friends were often involved in her escapades. One day, while admiring Rose's window, Mrs. Nipson caught the students in the act, leading to a lecture for Rose.

Mrs. Florence was upset and unfairly marked Katy and Clover for disobedience. Rose, feeling terrible about it, tried to explain but Mrs. Florence wouldn't listen. Mrs. Florence had decided to leave the school and didn't bother with justice among the students. It was Saturday afternoon, and Clover was relaxing in No. 6, finishing her chores. As she sat by the window, she saw Berry Searles and others playing ball. Lost in idleness, Katy rushed in, annoyed by the girls gossiping about the students. Katy found it improper for young girls to talk about love. Clover joked about Carrie's childish crush on Harry Crosby. Carrie even made a lozenge necklace with his name, but it melted and stuck to her dress.|"[""1.

"**Secret Signals**

In a secret society, members communicate using subtle signals. The first signal involves a discreet grip where fingers are intertwined and a small motion is made. Practice is crucial to avoid detection. The second signal alerts danger by rubbing the nose vigorously and stomping the left foot thrice. It must be done casually. The third signal, for urgent consultation, is a pinch on the back of the right hand while whispering ""Holofernes."" These signals help members discreetly coordinate. In a playful twist, Rose encourages sharing by inserting secret messages in a poem, fostering camaraderie among the members.

Katy excused Mary for not contributing at the first meeting but warned that all members must participate in the future. Rose, with seriousness, requested a moment for everyone to prepare emotionally for her moving piece in Scottish dialect. She began reciting a sorrowful verse, causing laughter among the group. Katy then proposed a word game where each member had to write a rhyme incorporating a randomly chosen word. The girls struggled with the questions but eventually completed the task.

Clover was delighted when Clare suggested starting a correspondence on his own. The next day, they all headed to Hillsover. The girls cherished Clarence's friendship and the memories of their time with the Agnews from their autumn break. Elsie, I couldn't write last Saturday as we returned to school. Miss Jane kept us busy with abstracts on Sunday. Rose Red thinks something upset Miss Jane during the vacation as she's been cross. I dislike returning to be scolded by her. We must write abstracts on Sunday sermons and include the texts and main points. Some girls stop listening when Dr. Prince outlines the sermon. Katy and I try to listen. Miss Jane pretends to read all abstracts but doesn't catch everything. Our journey back was pleasant with Mr. Page accompanying us. Clarence gave me a lovely pencil as a goodbye gift. Cousin Olivia gave Katy and me thoughtful presents. Apologies for saying we didn't enjoy the vacation, it wasn't Cousin Olivia's fault. Some people don't know how to make things enjoyable.

Rose Red arrived by train before Katy and her friend. She was happy to see them and cried because she felt homesick waiting at the Nunnery for four hours. Rose had a great vacation, attending three parties and a picnic. Interestingly, both Rose and Katy have winter bonnets made of black velvet with pink trim. Despite initially wanting a blue bonnet, Katy is now pleased with pink as Cousin Olivia mentioned it was more fashionable. Katy and her friend now have a new room, Number 2, which they find more pleasant than their old one. Although the windows are covered with thick cotton except for a small opening at the top, the girls are upset about it. They even held a meeting to discuss their discontent but eventually decided to stay. The new dining room is larger, allowing all the girls to eat together without the distinction of first and second tables. However, the girls must make a daily French remark at dinner, with topics assigned by Mrs. Nipson. The girls found humor in Rose's comment about liking roasted birds. Tomorrow's topic is Julius Caesar, which leaves Katy unsure of what to say as she hasn't learned about him in her French studies.|"['1.

There are fewer new students this term compared to the last one. Some girls believe it's because Mrs. Nipson isn't as well-liked as Mrs. Florence was. Louisa Agnew is one of the friendliest girls here, alongside Rose. Lilly Page thinks Louisa is common because her father paints portraits and they don't know the same people as Cousin Olivia. However, Louisa's family is wonderful, and their home is filled with interesting things and paintings. Louisa's little sister Daisy, who is only two years old, is adorable with her ten teeth and rare crying.

On October 19th, I started a letter to you, my dear Katy, but had to stop as I wasn't feeling well. The doctor says I'm getting better and will soon be up and about. Little Helen, a bright girl, brings me roses and reads me her composition on 'Stars.' She's like a fairy prince. Ben, my canary, is now so tame he's like a friend. He flies around curiously, even mistaking his reflection for another bird. Ben loves to perch on my finger, shoulder, and even eats from my mouth. He's jealous of my pencil and combs.

"Dear Clover,

I hope this letter finds you well. Elsie mentioned that she would write to you today, but I wanted to quickly send you a message before I head out fishing with the Slacks this Saturday. Blue Brook is teeming with trout these days. Eugene managed to catch five the other day, well, one was a minnow. Papa gifted me a fantastic fishing rod that extends as tall as a house. I am eager to see if I can catch some trout with it. Alexander joked that the trout would be so impressed by the rod that they would bite right away, but he was only teasing. Elsie and I have been playing chess almost every night. She plays remarkably well for a girl. Occasionally, pa joins in, and then she manages to beat us both. Miss Finch is doing fine. She doesn't run the household quite like Katy did, and I prefer your style, but she's quite pleasant. Recently, we had a delightful nutting picnic, and Miss Finch gave me and Phil a loaf of Election cake and six quince turnovers to bring along. The boys cheered for her when they saw the treats.

I hope you are well. I go to school with Elsie now. Writing compositions is challenging. We don't play in the loft as much as before. Mrs. Worrett visited last week, saying she weighs 280 pounds.

Next time you visit, we'll go there. Pa is in Maine for business. I'm guarding the house with Jim's gun. If robbers come, I'll be ready. Briget moved the broom, and I thought robbers were here.

Miss Jane didn't seem pleased as Katy added more wood to the fire and poured water into the iron cup. The room was a mess; books and papers scattered everywhere, clean clothes on chairs. Katy, knowing Miss Jane's love for order, decided to tidy up. She silently placed the clothes in drawers, organized the papers and books on the table, and dusted the surfaces. Surprisingly, Miss Jane allowed it, perhaps feeling too weak to object. Katy even brushed her hair gently, which Miss Jane enjoyed.

""Isn't it a shame to have to stay up here?"" The Professor gave a start, then glanced up at the hungry faces peering down and burst into laughter. ""Wait a moment,"" he whispered back, disappearing into the parlor. Soon, the girls watched him navigate through the crowd with a huge slice of pound cake in each hand.
