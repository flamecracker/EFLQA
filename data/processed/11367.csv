"The Ming Epoch, from 1368 to 1644, was a significant period in China's history. It marked a time of national pride, with wars fought against the Mongols and Japanese. Social reforms were introduced within the existing societal framework, leading to colonization and advancements in agriculture. Commercial and industrial progress flourished, alongside the growth of the small gentry class. Literature, art, and crafts thrived, reflecting the cultural richness of the era. Political dynamics at the royal court influenced the nation's direction, while naval expansion towards the south expanded China's influence. Internal struggles and external threats shaped the Ming Dynasty's legacy.

The subsequent Manchu Dynasty, spanning from 1644 to 1911, saw the Manchus rise to power and face challenges of decline in the eighteenth century. Expansion into Central Asia and cultural developments were significant achievements. Interactions with foreign powers and internal revolts characterized the dynasty's later years. European imperialism in the Far East, conflicts with Japan, and reforms leading to the Boxer Rebellion marked this period. The Manchu Dynasty's eventual end highlighted the changing tides of Chinese history, emphasizing the need for new perspectives and continued research to understand the complexities of China's past."|"[""1.

"In ancient times, a unique human ancestor known as the ""Peking Man"" roamed the Far East. The Peking Man lived in caves near Peking and was different from modern humans. Anthropologists believe the Peking Man may have shared characteristics with the yellow race. Living around a million years ago, the Peking Man was a hunter who used simple stone tools and knew how to make fire. Evidence suggests that the Peking Man had burial customs, indicating early religious beliefs. Following the Peking Man, a gap in knowledge exists until around 50,000 B.C. when a hunting community with distinct stone tools thrived in North China and Inner Mongolia. These communities lasted for a long time and were spread across North China, Mongolia, and Manchuria. Later, a new human type emerged in North China around 25,000 B.C., possibly related to the Ainu people of Japan. Their disappearance suggests assimilation into other populations. Further excavations are needed to uncover more about these ancient civilizations."|['1.

During the period around 4000 B.C., significant cultural developments were taking place in China. In the north, a Mongoloid people emerged, transitioning from hunters to cattle breeders who also practiced some agriculture. This shift was essential for securing food and fodder during the winter months. Meanwhile, in other parts of China, distinct neolithic cultures were flourishing. In the northwest, a culture combining cattle breeding with agriculture stood out with finely polished rectangular axes. To the east, a culture with round or oval axes prevailed, while the south and coastal regions boasted a shoulder-axe culture. These diverse cultures eventually influenced regions as far as eastern India and Melanesia. By 2500 B.C., various local cultures were thriving across China, such as the north-east culture focusing on hunting and primitive agriculture and the northern culture evolving into pastoral nomadism. These cultural developments laid the foundation for the rich history of the Far East.|['1.

In ancient China, various cultures thrived in different regions. The north-west culture, not Mongols, were hunters turned pastoralists with agriculture, mainly growing wheat and millet. Horses became their prized possession by 2500 B.C. These tribes also relied on sheep, goats, and cattle for sustenance. The Tibetan ancestors, in western provinces, were shepherds in mountain regions. Towards the south, distinct cultures emerged. The Liao culture, primitive Austroasiatics, were hunters. The Tai culture excelled in agriculture, cultivating rice in valleys. The Tai descendants now populate Thailand, Burma, and Laos. The Yüeh culture, a mix of Yao and Tai, spread across Indonesia. By 2000 B.C., new cultures like Yang-shao and Lung-shan emerged, showing signs of stratified societies due to population growth and cultural interactions.|['1.

The Yang-shao culture is named after a historic site in Honan, where Swedish researchers found it. Their fine pottery, painted in white, red, and black, was likely used as gifts for the deceased. The designs are stylized, with few copies of natural patterns. This pottery can be classified into sub-types, existing from around 2200 B.C. It started disappearing with urbanization and writing. The culture ended around 1600-1500 B.C., persisting in remote areas until 700 B.C. The pottery was found across China and even in Sinkiang. People lived in villages near rivers, practicing agriculture and domesticating animals. They used stone tools, with some bone implements. Axes were rectangular, and metal was introduced later. Burials were on high ground, where the painted pottery was discovered. Resemblances were noted with Western pottery, and some link its origin to the Indo-Europeans. Excavations will provide more insight into this ancient culture.|['1. What is the Yang-shao culture primarily known for?\nA) Metalworking\nB) Pottery\nC) Weaving\nD) Architecture\nE) Sculpture', '2.

Around 2000 B.C., while the Yang-shao culture thrived in the mountainous regions of northern and western China, the Lung-shan culture emerged in the flatlands of eastern China, specifically in Shantung province near Chinan-fu. Discovered only about twenty-five years ago, the Lung-shan culture is characterized by its high-quality black pottery devoid of metal. The pottery has a polished exterior, lacks paint, and is usually plain or has simple geometric designs. The vessels' shapes are reminiscent of traditional Chinese and Far Eastern pottery. The Lung-shan people lived in settlements built on mounds, indicating their long-standing agricultural lifestyle. Their society showed signs of hierarchy and was spread across several provinces in eastern China. The culture lasted until around 1600 B.C., with some evidence suggesting a longer presence in the south. The introduction of bronze around 1800 B.C. marked a significant advancement, with indications that it came from northern regions and was not initially produced in China.|"['1.

The Hsia state possibly emerged due to advancements in bronze technology. The Chinese tradition mentions the Hsia dynasty, but details are scarce. Excavations suggest it thrived around 2000 to 1600 B.C. in southwest Shansi. The Shang dynasty succeeded the Hsia around 1600 B.C., showcasing a high civilization. The Shang's central territory was in northwestern Honan, with a peasant society and towns like Anyang. The Shang buried their kings in large tombs with sacrificial objects. They crafted bronze weapons and vessels, and their culture was marked by stone sculptures. The scarcity of metal in China led to cycles of inflation and deflation, impacting the value of currency. This scarcity also led to the early development of porcelain as a more affordable alternative to metal vessels.|"['1.

During the Shang period in ancient China, earthenware vessels were almost porcelain-like, lacking only the glaze that porcelain has. These vessels were used for formal occasions, while simpler grey pottery was used in daily life. Silk was already being used, originating from the south of China, along with other plant fibers like hemp. The Shang people were farmers using basic tools like hoes since plows were not yet invented. Wine made from millet was a popular drink, as evidenced by the many wine vessels found. The Shang state was centered in northern Honan, with various towns serving as capitals. The population of the Shang state was estimated to be around 4-5 million. They were in continuous conflict with neighboring tribes identified as Ch'iang, Ti, and Hsien-yün, among others. The Shang period also saw the development of writing, with over 3,000 characters being used for communication.|"['1.

During the ancient Shang period, people used tortoiseshells and bones for divination. They would burn a depression in the shell, creating cracks to predict the future. Over time, questions were scratched onto the shells with answers, forming early documents. Thousands of these oracle bones have been found in Anyang. The Shang people worshipped many nature deities, with no fixed pantheon. The supreme god was Shang Ti, associated with vegetation and birth. Sacrifices were made to ensure fertility, sometimes involving human sacrifices. The earth was seen as a mother goddess, and various gods like the river god and thunder god were worshipped. Festivals and rituals were an integral part of their religious practices, with some customs lasting till today.|"['1.

"In ancient China, below the nobility were many dependent people, often referred to as ""slaves"" in modern Chinese studies. Some farmers were considered ""free farmers,"" while others were ""serfs"" tied to noble families, working on land claimed by these nobles. Artisans and craftsmen were also in servitude to noble families. Real slaves were personal property of noblemen. The Shang state captured foreign aristocracy and resettled them with their own noblemen, along with captured serfs. The Chou dynasty emerged after the fall of the Shang dynasty around 1028 B.C. The Chou, influenced by Turkish and Tibetan cultures, overcame the Shang state, leading to the establishment of the Chou dynasty and the beginning of China's recorded history."|"['1.

During the early Chou period, the land was transformed into a feudal state due to the conquest by an alien minority. The conquerors spread across the vast territory, establishing garrisons and rewarding tribal chieftains. Building roads was challenging in the northern region of China, leading to the establishment of garrisons as fiefs governed by the chieftains. Feudal lords were appointed through symbolic ceremonies transferring land rights. These lords distributed land to their clan members, creating sub-fiefs and sub-lords. Over time, the concept of landed property evolved, leading to the development of family names, and eventually, new clans emerged. The imperial central power was situated in Shensi, surrounded by over a thousand feudal states. The conquerors formed new towns with a distinct upper class, while the indigenous population lived around these garrisons. This feudal system persisted until the Han Dynasty when family names became widely accepted.|['1.

"During the early Chou period, there was a significant shift away from human sacrifices, with the Chou opting to use prisoners of war as laborers instead. The Chou employed Shang and other slaves as servants for nobility and as farm workers. The land under Chou control was considered ""state land"" with farmers as ""serfs"". Serfs were a class dependent on another but had the right to work the land. Cultivation was shifting, with serfs tending standardized plots for a year before moving to new ones. They lived in huts during the growing season and in adobe houses in winter. The produce from the serfs supplied lords and farmers. Villages of ""natives"" were further from towns. The Chou capital had a twin city, one part for the ruling Chou and the other for the subjugated population. Loyang, another capital, was in the middle of the state and was considered the center of the universe for Heaven-worship. Loyang housed administrative buildings and the transferred population from the Shang capital, likely artisans. The Chou brought new fabrics but maintained Shang bronze vessel designs and tomb styles."|"['1.

"During the early Chou dynasty, significant changes occurred in the religious practices and social structure. The Shang priesthood faced challenges as the Chou rulers, who did not have priests, integrated Heaven-worship into their family system. The ruler was considered the Son of Heaven, leading to a decline in the need for priests as intermediaries. Some priests transitioned to becoming scribes due to their literacy skills, while others continued as village priests organizing religious events. The Chou rulers, valuing propriety, sought the expertise of these scholars for ceremonies and moral teachings. As the Chou empire expanded, the ruling house weakened due to internal issues and struggles with nomadic tribes. The Chou rulers had to combat rising tribes near their capital, facing challenges as feudal lords prioritized their own interests. The scholars, later known as ""scholars,"" played a crucial role in maintaining social and religious order in the evolving Chou empire."|"['1.

During a period of turmoil, China experienced changes in its outer regions. The concept of frontiers in China differed from that of Europe, as China believed all countries were under the Chinese emperor, known as the Son of Heaven. The level of subordination to the ruler varied across regions, with those closer to the center being more dependent. Feudal lords in the inner territories were less subordinated, while those further away considered themselves independent. Notions of frontiers were blurred due to this system. Feudal towns evolved into states with dominion, especially in the south, where states like Ch'u, Wu, and Yüeh gained prominence. The feudal lord of Ch'i became a dictator, centralizing military power and trade, leading to a luxurious civilization. Conflict arose with nomad tribes, culminating in the attack on Wei in 660 B.C. This conflict highlighted the continued strength of nomads within China.|"['1.

"During the period of the dictators in ancient China, a shift occurred leading to the era known as the Contending States. This transition was driven by the weakening of feudal states and the rise of alliances that rendered dictators powerless. The intellectual history of this time, from 550 to 280 B.C., saw the emergence of influential scholars who specialized in traditional morals, sacrifices, and festival organization. Confucius, one of China's most renowned philosophers, was born in 551 B.C. and played a significant role during this period. He imparted his teachings to a circle of disciples, laying the foundation for the moral code followed by the upper classes in China for centuries. Confucius emphasized the importance of harmony with the universal law, or ""Tao,"" advocating for adherence to established ceremonies and rites for societal well-being."|['1.

Confucianism, an ancient philosophical system, emphasizes the importance of family and the state. In this belief system, the family is seen as the fundamental unit of society, with the eldest male as the patriarch. The state is viewed as an extension of the family, with the ruler's role akin to that of a father to his subjects. Confucius, the philosopher behind this system, also highlighted the significance of moral qualities in rulership. According to Confucius, rulers should be chosen based on their virtue rather than solely on birthright. This idea of meritocracy suggests that leadership should be earned through moral excellence rather than inherited. Confucius's teachings, as recorded in the _Annals of Spring and Autumn_, offer valuable insights into the principles of good governance and the importance of ethical leadership.|"['1.

"Confucius had ideas for reform but did not challenge the feudal system. His teachings focused on social order and morality, not metaphysics or logic. He didn't found a religion but systematized existing beliefs. Confucianism evolved over centuries, becoming a moral guide for Chinese society. It emphasized social harmony and individuals' roles in the family and state. Unlike the West's focus on individualism, Confucianism prioritized group cohesion. Lao Tzu, another philosopher, taught harmony with the universe in the ""Tao Te Ching."" His teachings were vague, aiming to align human life with universal laws. Lao Tzu's approach was intuitive and emotional, contrasting Confucius' more rule-based method.

Confucius and Lao Tz[)u] had different views on living harmoniously with nature. Confucius believed in assimilating man into society and maintaining harmony within the community. On the other hand, Lao Tz[)u] proposed a path for those disillusioned with societal life. Followers of Lao Tz[)u], known as Taoists, chose seclusion, living in harmony with nature and following their true nature, known as the Tao. Lao Tz[)u] believed in passive achievement, where individuals should act according to their nature without artificial restrictions. He suggested that a ruler should govern by emptying people's hearts of desire and envy, providing for their basic needs, and keeping them away from evil influences. Lao Tz[)u] believed that without active government, everyone could find happiness and unity with nature. His teachings were against social and official obligations, advocating for individual freedom and living in accordance with the Tao.|"[""1.

The story of Master Mysticus living in seclusion on a mountain reflects the Taoist philosophy of withdrawing from the world to purify the spirit. Mr. Rationalist, on the other hand, believed in seeking fame and repute through societal achievements. Mr. Rationalist tried to persuade Master Mysticus to rejoin society, emphasizing the value of civilization and culture. However, Master Mysticus cherished his freedom and the tranquility of nature in his villa, surrounded by cypresses and flowing water. He enjoyed music, hunting, fishing, playing the lute, and reading. Despite his brief return to official duties, Master Mysticus valued his moments of solitude and contemplation in his secluded retreat. This contrast between the Taoist and the societal perspectives is a recurring theme in Chinese literature, illustrating the balance between worldly pursuits and inner peace.|['1.

Lao Tz[)u] was an individualist and anarchist whose doctrine did not fit well into mainstream Chinese society. Despite this, Taoism, the philosophy he inspired, was embraced by the elite. Taoism's core beliefs, rooted in nature and a reluctance to disrupt its order, were not directly from Lao Tz[)u]. The timeline of Lao Tz[)u] and other influential Chinese philosophers like Chuang Tz[)u] and Huai-nan Tz[)u] extended until the fourth century A.D. However, original thought among Taoists dwindled after this period. The Contending States era followed the Chou dictatorships, marked by intense conflict among feudal states. These states formed alliances that were constantly shifting due to bribery and intrigue. Feudal lords lost lands, leading to a rise in migratory politicians and scholars offering advice on gaining power. Despite their realistic approach, these advisers respected the tradition of imperial divine origin, often fabricating genealogies to legitimize claims to the throne.|['Question 1:\nWhat was the core belief of Taoism according to the passage?\nA) Embracing mainstream society\nB) Disrupting the order of nature\nC) Rooted in nature\nD) Following strict rules\nE) Rejecting the influence of Lao Tz[)u]', 'Question 2:\nWho were some of the influential Chinese philosophers mentioned in the passage?\nA) Confucius and Sun Tzu\nB) Lao Tz[)u] and Huai-nan Tz[)u]\nC) Plato and Aristotle\nD) Socrates and Descartes\nE) Rousseau and Voltaire', 'Question 3:\nWhat marked the Contending States era according to the passage?\nA) Peaceful coexistence\nB) Intense conflict among feudal states\nC) Stable alliances\nD) Lack of bribery and intrigue\nE) Decrease in migratory politicians', 'Question 4:\nWhat led to a rise in migratory politicians and scholars according to the passage?\nA) Decrease in power struggles\nB) Increase in feudal lands\nC) Stability in alliances\nD) Feudal lords gaining lands\nE) Feudal lords losing lands', 'Question 5:\nHow did advisers legitimize claims to the throne according to the passage?\nA) By fabricating genealogies\nB) By engaging in battles\nC) By forming stable alliances\nD) By rejecting imperial divine origin\nE) By following strict rules', 'Question 6:\nWhat happened to original thought among Taoists after the fourth century A.D. according to the passage?\nA) It flourished\nB) It remained unchanged\nC) It dwindled\nD) It expanded globally\nE) It became more radical']|['C) Rooted in nature', 'B) Lao Tz[)u] and Huai-nan Tz[)u]', 'B) Intense conflict among feudal states', 'E) Feudal lords losing lands', 'A) By fabricating genealogies', 'C) It dwindled']
In ancient times, wars were fought by nobles and their followers. But as conflicts intensified, nobles hired mercenaries and armed peasants to join the battles, significantly increasing the size of armies. While historical accounts may have exaggerated casualty numbers, battles involved thousands of soldiers. Initially, armies consisted of nobles in chariots, but infantry and cavalry were later added. The introduction of cavalry by the state of Chao in the fifth century B.C. brought a military advantage. This change in warfare led to the adoption of new clothing styles, like trousers and riding caps. To strengthen their armies, states encouraged immigration and settlement of peasants to increase tax revenue for recruitment. Land ownership shifted, and farmers migrated to cultivate new lands. The concept of land ownership changed over time, allowing families to buy and sell land as a valuable asset.|['1.

During ancient times in China, significant changes in land inheritance and agricultural practices occurred. In the past, primogeniture dictated that the oldest son inherited the family fief, but due to population growth, land was divided equally among all sons. New farming techniques like the animal-drawn plough and iron implements improved cultivation methods. The diet also shifted, with less mutton and beef consumed, and an increase in pig and dog meat and beans due to population growth. The rise of metal production and coins boosted trade, leading merchants to invest in land. With the decline of small feudal states, merchants began collecting taxes for rulers, becoming influential administrative figures. These changes marked a shift in societal structures and economic practices in ancient China.|['1.

During ancient times, as cities expanded due to growing businesses, their populations increased significantly. For instance, Lin-chin, near present-day Chi-nan in Shantung, had around 210,000 residents by the third century. The city walls spanned 4,000 meters, making it larger than the famous city of Loyang, the capital of China during the Later Han dynasty. These cities had two main types: the planned rectangular city of the Chou conquerors, serving as an administrative hub, and irregularly shaped cities evolving from marketplaces into administrative centers. Rivers were crucial for long-distance travel due to the scarcity of draft animals, leading to the construction of canals and roads. These developments facilitated trade, agriculture, and the growth of industries like silk weaving and metalworking. The cities also saw the early stages of a money economy and the establishment of laws to regulate commoners' lives. Foreign policy during this period was limited due to the decentralized ruling system and struggles with neighboring tribes. This era also marked the beginning of the Great Wall of China to protect against northern invasions.|['1.

"During a period of significant economic and social changes, cultural transformations also took place. New ideas emerged as people sought solutions to pressing issues amidst the upheaval.

Mencius believed that the ""people"" would identify the rightful ruler if the existing dynasty fell. Hsün Tz[)u] recognized the unchanging laws of nature but emphasized that man's actions also shape his destiny.

"During ancient times in China, various schools of thought emerged, reflecting the changing society. Mo Ti's principle of ""universal love"" arose from the weakening family bonds and breakdown of clans. His emphasis on frugality mirrored the mindset of businessmen in a growing economy. The Legalists, led by Shang Yang, advocated for a strict hierarchy where only the ruler and chancellor had active roles, while the common people were to obey without question. This approach was implemented in the state of Ch'in, eventually leading to its dominance over other regions. Similarly, the dialecticians like Kung-sun Lung and Hui Tz[)u] focused on logic and persuasive communication to gain power.

During ancient times in China, a unique school of thought emerged, focusing on natural science akin to Greek philosophy. This school, led by Tsou Yen, explored the elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, known as Wu hsing. Tsou Yen proposed a theory that the world consisted of nine continents, influenced by Indian beliefs. Despite his groundbreaking ideas, Tsou Yen and his followers faced ridicule and persecution for their views, including the notion of a spherical Earth. As their teachings delved into political implications and the calculation of dynasties, they were suppressed by authorities, forcing them underground. Secret societies, influenced by Tsou Yen's philosophy, emerged, blending elements of foreign religions and Taoism. These societies provided an emotional outlet for common people, especially farmers, during times of turmoil. While Tsou Yen's school faced repression, scientific advancements continued in China, driven by governmental interests in fields like mathematics and astronomy essential for administration and taxation.|"[""1.

The state of Ch'in, encompassing present-day Shensi and eastern Kansu, served as a vital transit region due to its geographical location. Bordered by steppes and deserts in the north and almost impassable mountains in the south, the only cultivable area lay between the Wei and T'ao rivers. This fertile zone acted as the primary east-west transit route, essential for trade with Turkestan. The state fostered strong ties with eastern Turkestan, benefiting from foreign trade. The growing population, encouraged by the government through immigration, led to economic prosperity, especially with the development of irrigation systems. This period marked a shift towards bureaucratic administration, influenced by the Legalist School, culminating in the rise of Shih Huang-ti, whose reign saw the conquest and unification of feudal states under a centralized rule.|"[""1.

The enormous task of organizing the administration in the vast realm began after the conquest of other feudal states. The ruling families and nobles were deported to the capital, stripping them of power and allowing their land to be sold. This led to the rise of a class of luxury consumers in the capital, attracting craftsmen and businessmen, transforming it into a hub of arts and crafts. A uniform system of administration was established, dividing the realm into provinces and prefectures, each overseen by officials. Initially, the prefectures were under central administration with tax collection handled by merchants, while provinces were military command areas. However, with the militarization of the realm, provinces gained importance. Civil and military governors were appointed to each province, supervised by a controller accountable to the emperor, eliminating the distinction between civil and military administration. The unification of language and writing styles was mandated to facilitate communication among officials, ensuring all texts were written in a standardized script. Additionally, weights, measures, and wagon axle lengths were standardized to streamline tax collection and transportation.|['1.

In 221 B.C., Shih Huang-ti became the emperor of all China. Opinions about him vary greatly. Official Chinese history rejects him because he tried to eradicate Confucianism, a belief system followed by later historians. Western scholars, however, often view him as one of the greatest men in history. Research shows that Shih Huang-ti was an average man with no exceptional talents, superstitious, and influenced by mystical ideas of his time. He believed he was the first of ten thousand emperors in his dynasty, hinting at megalomania. His Chancellor Li Ss[)u] was the real standout figure. The Legalists, a philosophical school before Shih Huang-ti, shaped his rule. They believed the ruler should delegate tasks to ministers, and the emperor was a symbol of Heaven. Shih Huang-ti's grandiose plans for the capital and his mausoleum were based on astral concepts. The Great Wall was built to protect the northern frontier from nomadic tribes. After Shih Huang-ti's death, rebellions broke out, leading to a period of chaos until Liu Chi emerged victorious in 206 B.C.|"[""1.

"In 206 B.C., Liu Chi became Emperor and named his dynasty the Han Dynasty, with the posthumous title of Emperor Kao Tsu. This marked the start of the Chinese Middle Ages, transitioning from the Ch'in dynasty. The Han dynasty introduced a new form of state, the ""gentry state,"" ending ancient feudalism. Emperor Kao Tsu, from eastern China and a peasant family, faced the challenge of governance. He rewarded allies with positions but later distanced himself from them. The administration was practical, retaining laws like the ban on Confucianist writings. Kao Tsu allocated fiefs to his relatives and close followers, creating a mixed administration. Officials were drawn from the gentry class, who owned substantial estates leased to tenants. The gentry families were the backbone of the empire, with their rents forming their livelihood."|"[""1.

"In ancient China, gentry families held positions of power and influence. These families had a system where the most educated members, known as the ""literati,"" would take up official roles in the government. Those less able or uninterested in official careers lived as free ""literati"" in cities or on family farms. The families supported their capable members in official roles, providing security and influence. If family members in official positions faced challenges, they could use their power to protect family estates. Even if officials lost their positions, the family could recover over time. Gentry families aimed to have many children to secure positions of power and form political alliances through marriages. This system led to stability but limited social mobility.

During the Chinese Middle Ages, the gentry society was crucial in governing the land. Tax collectors were often selected from influential gentry families due to their power and connections. These tax collectors, even if assigned outside their home regions, were familiar with other districts and could garner support by appointing locals as their assistants. The gentry society evolved over time, with around a hundred leading families concentrated in the capital and surrounding areas. This period marked a transition from the feudal era to a more organized society, starting with the Han dynasty. The Hsiung-nu, a formidable nomadic power, posed a threat to China, aiming to conquer and rule by assimilating Chinese administrative practices. However, their state's success depended on maintaining their nomadic lifestyle and resisting Chinese influence, which they managed for about seven centuries.|['1.

During the reign of Emperor Kao Tsu, the Hsiung-nu continued their hostilities against China despite a treaty that was supposed to end the raids. The treaty, sealed by the marriage of a Chinese princess to a Hsiung-nu leader, marked the first international agreement in the Far East. However, the raids persisted as the Hsiung-nu's needs grew with their expanding empire. In the south, around Canton, another empire under a Chinese leader was formed. When Kao Tsu sent a diplomatic mission to this ruler, he voluntarily accepted Chinese suzerainty to avoid conflict. After Kao Tsu's death, his widow, Empress Lü, faced opposition while ruling until 179 B.C. Wen Ti succeeded her and brought peace and economic prosperity, reducing peasant burdens and increasing agricultural production. This period also saw the rise of a new gentry class devoted to Confucian ideals, leading to the introduction of the examination system for selecting officials around 100 B.C.|"[""1.

The ancient Chinese society had a structured system where only officials and farmers were considered fully respectable. Artisans and merchants faced restrictions, while lower classes and slaves were excluded from society. The examination system allowed officials to be selected from the upper classes, neglecting peasants. Sons of officials had access to special schools, although complaints arose about the quality of education. Despite the flaws, the system instilled high ethical values in officials, preserving Chinese cultural values. During Wen Ti's reign, there was an economic and intellectual revival, leading to the rise of a new upper class, the gentry. Legal codes were developed, with the Han dynasty expanding and revising them extensively. Confucian writings were used as precedents for legal decisions, emphasizing the importance of education and social class in the legal system.|"['1.

"During ancient times in China, a significant change occurred as the power of feudal princes was gradually reduced. Initially, these princes were divided into two classes, with only privileged ones allowed to reside in the capital while others stayed in their own territories. Over time, the feudal princes lost their authority, retaining only a symbolic title. Tax income from a specific number of families was allocated to them, often exaggerated. The Chinese government gradually evolved to its form until A.D. 220. The emperor held absolute power but was bound by moral responsibilities towards ""Heaven"". Emperors could not alter the law code and were accountable for their actions. While the emperor was the head of the state, policy execution was overseen by ministers. The central administration managed various aspects like economic and military statistics, labor service, and conscription. Local regions had independent administrations, loosely linked to the central government.

"During the Han period, the administration evolved into civil and military branches within provinces. Each province had a military governor representing the imperial army, activated only during war. The Han administration lacked organization but had a central statistical authority, the court secretariat, overseeing ministries and offices. This institution developed into an independent censorship during the T'ang period. The T'ang system included a ""State and Court Secretariat"" unifying the executive. A ""Privy Council of State"" emerged due to continuous war, taking over executive functions. The provincial administration was modern, with governors and district officers having large staff. These staff members handled various departments like finance, justice, and education.

The unique aspect of this system was the autonomy of provincial administration from the central government. Governors and their prefects had significant power in their regions, resembling feudal lords with the authority to appoint and dismiss at will. This setup, a relic of feudalism, acted as a counterbalance to excessive centralization. It ensured that even if the central power collapsed or parts of the empire were cut off, the country could still function. In a distant frontier town like Tunhuang on the Turkestan border, local Chinese life continued unaffected by disruptions in communication with the capital due to foreign invasions. Officials were subject to reassignment at any time and relied on the practical knowledge of local gentry families for governance. These families controlled local administration for over a thousand years. While officials underwent state examinations for appointment, they lacked specialized training, except for some key positions like jurists or physicians. Notably, during the late T'ang period, a Department of Commerce and Monopolies was established with specialists directly appointed by the emperor. This marked a shift from the traditional system where officials could be transferred across ministries regardless of expertise. In the period between 160 and 140 B.C., there were tensions with the Hsiung-nu, prompting a strategic shift under Emperor Wu (141-86 B.C.). China adopted an aggressive stance against the Hsiung-nu, aiming to counter their threats to the capital and its vital hinterland. The rugged terrain of northern Shansi allowed for incursions|"['1.

In ancient China, around 133 B.C., the Chinese attempted to capture the leader of the Hsiung-nu state, known as a _shan-yü_, but their plan failed as the _shan-yü_ escaped. Over the years, there were numerous battles with no clear victory until 119 B.C. when the Chinese changed their strategy. They launched a strong cavalry attack, causing heavy losses to the Hsiung-nu. Meanwhile, in 125 B.C., Chang Ch'ien returned from his mission to the west, bringing valuable information about distant lands. His reports sparked interest in establishing trade routes and diplomatic ties with these regions. This led to military successes, like General Li Kuang-li's campaigns to Ferghana, expanding Chinese influence. The Chinese also conquered parts of Korea, securing trade routes with Japan. Despite facing setbacks, the Chinese continued their efforts against the Hsiung-nu, weakening them and inciting conflicts among other tribes.|"['1.

During the Han dynasty in China, powerful groups called cliques influenced the government. These cliques aimed to control important government positions by forming alliances through marriages within their families. They ensured their dominance by marrying off their daughters to the emperor and placing loyal eunuchs around him. The cliques also had a say in selecting officials, favoring candidates from their own families or associates. Emperors often became figureheads under the influence of these cliques, with some even being removed by them. The fall of the Han dynasty was hastened by the actions of the widow of Emperor Yüan Ti, who placed her relatives, including Wang Mang, in key government roles. Wang Mang eventually seized power, deposing emperors and establishing the Hsin dynasty. His actions set a precedent for future rulers, emphasizing the importance of public support and formal ceremonies in legitimizing their rule.|"['1.

"Wang Mang's brief rule from A.D. 9 to 23 was a significant time in Chinese history, filled with both praise and criticism. His reforms, like legalizing the transfer of power and economic policies, were admired and even adopted later. However, many of his actions were seen as unacceptable. Wang Mang cleverly used propaganda and Confucianism to gain support, even tampering with ancient texts to suit his agenda. Despite being labeled as the ""first Socialist Emperor,"" his laws were more about consolidating power and filling the treasury than helping the poor. Measures like state-controlled land redistribution and monopolies on goods were designed to benefit the state rather than the people. Wang Mang's regime was marked by deception and manipulation, with policies that often worked against the interests of the common folk."|"[""1.

"Wang Mang, a ruler of ancient China, implemented laws that were not socialist but were exploited by his officials for personal gain. This led to a worsening of the peasants' living conditions and did not benefit the state financially. Facing financial needs due to his extravagant lifestyle and plans for war against the Hsiung-nu, Wang Mang's actions caused unrest among the people. A popular uprising by the ""Red Eyebrows"" emerged, leading to mass murders and chaos.

During the Later Han dynasty, the country experienced a period of recovery after the turmoil of previous years. The population had decreased due to massacres, but this allowed peasants to have more land since many lords and moneylenders had perished. The government relocated to Loyang in Honan, closer to wheat-producing areas, which reduced the cost of transporting grain to the capital. The Later Han period saw the rise of new landowners supporting the imperial house, descendants of earlier Han landowners. The dynasty had success in foreign affairs, expanding Chinese settlements in regions like Yünnan and Annam. General Ma Yuan's campaigns added these areas to the empire. The Hsiung-nu faced challenges and were eventually subdued by the Chinese. The Hsiung-nu split, with the southern group submitting to China, marking a significant victory for the Chinese without direct conflict.|"['1.

"By around the year 200, the political landscape in China had settled into three main factions. Ts'ao Ts'ao held power in the north and maintained control over the emperor. In the west, Liu Pei had established himself in the province of Szechwan, while Sun Ts'ê's brother held sway in the southeast. However, the struggles between these factions were not the only significant events of the time. The country faced immense distress, reminiscent of the troubled era under Wang Mang. The plight of the rural population worsened, leading to a popular uprising known as the ""Yellow Turbans"". This movement was characterized by its religious roots, influenced by Iranian Mazdaism and teachings of Lao Tzu. The sect gained support from the peasantry, who saw their unauthorized local priests as leaders against the gentry. The movement established a state in Eastern Szechwan province, promoting communal welfare and discouraging class differences. Despite facing opposition, remnants of this movement persisted for centuries, influencing religions in other regions. The Yellow Turbans' revolt in 184 posed a threat to all factions, prompting a united army to defeat them. Ts'ao Ts'ao emerged as the most powerful general, even recruiting foreign troops to bolster his forces. This strategic move allowed him to solidify control over the empire, leading to the establishment of the Wei dynasty in A.D. 220."|"[""1.

During the Han period in China, a new group of educated individuals emerged, eager to engage in what had previously been a pursuit exclusive to the aristocracy - education. This led to the compilation of numerous encyclopedias for the dissemination of knowledge in an easily accessible format. The first such compilation was by Lü Pu wei in the third century B.C., which covered various topics like ceremonies, customs, and historical events. Subsequent encyclopedias, like the renowned Book of the Mountains and Seas, expanded on geography, natural philosophy, and myths. The historical work, Shih Chi, authored by Ss[)u]-ma Ch'ien, marked a shift towards structured historical accounts, drawing from official records, private documents, and extensive research. This work set the standard for future historians, featuring annals, biographies, and monographs on various subjects. The Han period also saw the authoring of philosophical works, with notable contributions from Tung Chung-shu and Prince Liu An, who delved into Taoism and alchemy.|"['1.

During the Han period, Wang Ch'ung's _Lun Hêng_ promoted rational thinking and the development of natural science. He criticized the influence of superstition on ancient literature and daily customs, advocating for a modern scientific approach. However, the gentry suppressed this movement to maintain their traditional dominance over merchants and artisans. Poetry flourished at the imperial court, with grandiloquent verses praising the emperor. Women from southern China introduced new poetic forms, evoking natural emotions. Chinese art, largely produced by the cultured gentry, reflected philosophic ideas and emotions. Paintings depicted idealized landscapes and scenes of daily life. While artists were traditionally from the gentry, craftsmen also created works of art. The Han period saw the emergence of intricate bronze vessels and artistic representations in tombs. Buddhism, introduced by foreign merchants, influenced Chinese society, particularly during the decline of the Han dynasty. Buddhist priests from India and Central Asia spread their teachings, attracting lower-class members and sparking interest in Indian science among educated circles.|"[""1.

The end of the Han period marked the completion of the gentry's social order in China. Subsequently, conflicts arose with populations on the northern borders. This era saw China divided into multiple kingdoms, each with its own dynasty. The initial division into three kingdoms (Wei, Wu, Shu Han) was followed by a brief reunification under the Western Chin. A sharper division between north and south ensued, with non-Chinese nomad dynasties in the north and a succession of Chinese rulers in the south. By 580, a united China emerged, blending northern culture and gentry traditions. This period, from 220 to 580, mirrored the Roman Empire's decline, with challenges to the gentry's social order from the northern nobility. The era also saw the introduction of Buddhism, influencing Chinese culture and expanding intellectual horizons.|"[""1.

During a period of economic change in South China, a shift occurred between the traditional Chinese lifestyle from the north and that of the southern natives. Many Chinese groups transitioned from growing wheat in dry fields to cultivating rice in wet fields and from field farming to market gardening. Meanwhile, in North China, a conflict arose between Chinese agriculture and the cattle breeding practices of Central Asia. The rulers in the region faced decisions about whether to prioritize pasturage or maintain the agrarian traditions of the people under their rule. Turkish and Mongol conquerors had abandoned their supplementary agriculture, becoming nomads who obtained agricultural goods through raiding or trade. This shift led to questions about the treatment of peasants and the potential installation of ruling classes over them.

During the Three Kingdoms period in ancient China, the state of Shu Han, led by the wise premier Chu-ko Liang, faced a decline after his death in 234. In contrast, the state of Wu had a challenging terrain of marshy plains and mountains, where the Tai and Yao peoples lived. Peasants from the north struggled with rice cultivation and adapted to breeding pigs and water buffaloes. Wu focused on consolidating its territory and engaged in diplomatic relations with neighboring states. Wu's plans were disrupted when Wei used diplomacy to ally with Japan against them, leading to Wu's downfall. Both Shu Han and Wu were states conquered by northern generals, leading to a disconnect between the ruling military and native populations. Despite challenges, the period saw economic growth in the south with the emergence of an imperial court, fostering trade and cultural development.|"['1.

In 280 A.D., the Chin troops managed to conquer the Wu state, reuniting the empire after the fall of the Shu Han to the Wei. Following Wu's defeat, a general disarmament was ordered to stabilize the economy. This disarmament affected the imperial troops but not those under the princes, who claimed they needed personal protection. Despite a decree for arms surrender, soldiers kept their weapons, many selling them to northern tribes like the Hsiung-nu and Hsien-pi. The ineffective disarmament led to increased military strength among the frontier people, weakening the central government. The Toba, Tibetans, Hsien-pi, and Hsiung-nu benefitted from the demobilization law, forming complex relations with the Chinese. The Toba, primarily Turkish, formed a tribal federation, with the ruler at the top and layers representing different tribes based on loyalty and influence.|['1.

"During ancient times, federations displayed two main tendencies. Firstly, leaders attempted to establish a bureaucratic system within the federation by using their followers as a core group. Secondly, there was a shift towards replacing original tribal leaders with members of the leader's family. Military units based on ""Groups of Hundred"" and ""Groups of Thousand"" were created, dissolving the original tribes into military regiments. Over time, these military units began to resemble tribes again. The Tibetans split into the Ch'iang and the Ti sub-groups, with the Ti eventually rising under the leadership of Ch'i Wan-nien in A.D. 296. The Ch'iang later pursued an independent policy from 312 onwards. Unlike aristocratically organized ""Turkish"" states or non-aristocratic ""Mongol"" states, Tibetan states had a military structure due to weak tribal organization.

South of the Toba, there were nineteen tribes of the Hsiung-nu, also known as the Huns. In A.D. 287, Liu Yüan led the Hsiung-nu and was a prominent figure during this time. Liu Yüan, despite his Chinese name, hailed from the Hun _shan-yü_ lineage, specifically from the family and line of Mao Tun. His noble lineage and strong organizational skills elevated his status. Meanwhile, at the official court of the Chin, the Yang family wielded significant influence. However, when the emperor passed away, the wife of the new emperor Hui Ti orchestrated the assassination of the old empress Yang and her entire family. This marked the rise of the Chia family at court. The power struggles within the ruling factions led to a period of disunity, with various princes vying for control and the border regions experiencing relative peace. This era also witnessed significant Chinese migration towards the periphery, notably into the present-day province of Kansu, where a governor had established a prosperous and peaceful domain despite being surrounded by rival groups.|"[""1.

"During the ancient times, Chinese people moved northwards into the territories of frontier communities, including the Hsien-pi and the Huns. These groups were considered barbarians by the Chinese, yet they maintained peace in their territories, allowing peasants, craftsmen, and even educated individuals to settle there. Families of the gentry who had lost influence in China found refuge among the Huns, serving as teachers and advisors. The Huns, led by Liu Yüan, adopted Chinese education and culture, gaining confidence and even claiming a right to the Chinese imperial throne. Despite historical prejudices against the Huns, Liu Yüan's dynasty, named the ""Han dynasty,"" aimed to rule China peacefully. By linking themselves culturally and historically to the Chinese, the Huns sought legitimacy in their quest for the throne. Their success led to the establishment of the ""Hun Han dynasty"" and the eventual capture of Chinese capitals, marking the end of the Western Chin dynasty."|['1.

"During ancient times in North China, Shih Lo, a former follower of Liu Yüan, controlled the eastern region. Shih Lo, who had escaped slavery in China, led the detribalized Huns and waged a brutal campaign in 310, slaughtering over 100,000 Chinese, including forty-eight princes. His power grew, causing tensions with Liu Ts'ung. Shih Lo rejected Chinese methods, preferring nomadic traditions, and focused on raids rather than territorial control. Many Huns preferred his rule and abandoned Liu Ts'ung. The Huns valued strong leaders, which Liu Ts'ung lacked, leading to his downfall. Shih Lo eventually declared himself emperor of the ""Later Chao dynasty."" He disliked Chinese culture and aimed to make north China a grazing land for his Hun tribes. Meanwhile, in the province of Kansu, a Chinese governor established the ""Earlier Liang dynasty"" after the fall of the Chin empire, fostering prosperity and trade with Turkestan.

"After a journey to the remote west, we returned to the Hun capital. Shih Lo ruled an expansive but unstable empire from 329 onwards. He felt insecure due to his humble origins, leading the Huns to see him as a ""revolutionary"". Shih Lo eliminated all members of the Liu family to secure his throne, but struggled to gain the loyalty of the Hun and other Turkish tribes under his rule. Many Huns left for the Toba realm, while others lived as nomads in Shansi and the Ordos region. This lack of security weakened Shih Lo's empire, leading to his death in 333. Shih Hu succeeded him and moved the capital to Yeh in northern Honan. The court at Yeh was renowned for its magnificence, with foreigners, especially Buddhist monks, playing significant roles. Shih Hu's administration, though efficient, lacked support from the masses or gentry. After Shih Hu's death, conflicts between his sons ensued, leading to the rise and fall of different rulers, ultimately resulting in the end of the Later Chao dynasty. In the north, the proto-Mongol Hsien-pi tribes regained independence, with a leader from the Mu-jung tribe establishing the state of Yen in 337.

Fu Chien, a ruler of the north, introduced a new military strategy by incorporating infantry into his army alongside the traditional cavalry units used by the nomadic tribes. This innovation allowed him to dominate neighboring states swiftly. Despite annexing territories and defeating other realms, he faced challenges when attempting to conquer all of China. His million-strong army faced difficulties in the southern regions due to unfamiliar terrain and lack of proper supplies. The southern troops, led by Hsieh Hsüan, capitalized on these weaknesses, causing panic among Fu Chien's forces and leading to his eventual retreat. The instability of his empire became evident as it fragmented soon after. A noble from the Mu-jung tribe even broke away to establish the Later Yen dynasty in central Hopei.

"In the year 384, a new dynasty called the ""Western Yen dynasty"" was established in western China by a group of commanders who declared independence after the collapse of Fu Chien's rule. However, they failed to form a stable state and were eventually dispersed. Another attempt in 384 led to the rise of the ""Later Ch'in dynasty,"" which took over the capital Ch'ang-an but remained limited to the province of Shensi. The tribes of Hsien-pi formed the ""Western Ch'in dynasty"" in 385, controlling the eastern end of the western Asian caravan route but failing to attract commerce due to insecurity. The region mainly relied on cattle-breeding for sustenance. Additionally, the ""Later Liang"" dynasty emerged in the far west of China, focusing on trade and transit traffic for prosperity.

"During the division of north China, two empires were established by non-Chinese rulers, the Hun Liu Yüan and the Tibetan Fu Chien. Both aimed to create ""Chinese"" empires, but their different traditions led to contrasting outcomes. Liu Yüan's empire, built on feudal tribes, failed as his successors rejected his vision, causing the empire to disintegrate. In contrast, Fu Chien's militaristic empire, with a mix of Tibetans, Chinese, and other tribes, also collapsed due to internal betrayals.

During the fourth century in north China, the Huns, once a powerful group, seemed to have vanished, leaving only a small Hun state in the Northern Liang region. Despite their apparent disappearance, the Huns still existed as separate nomadic tribes in the Ordos region and Shansi. The intellectual sphere in north China during this time was considered lacking, with culture primarily thriving in the south. The decline of the gentry class in the north, who traditionally supported Confucianism, led to a void in intellectual leadership. As a result, Buddhism gained prominence during this period, spreading among the middle and lower classes due to its teachings on reincarnation and social justice. Buddhist monks found acceptance among the lower classes, leading to the influence of Buddhism in China during this era.|"['1.

"During the translation of Buddhism into Chinese, significant changes occurred as it traversed Central Asia. The original Indian form, known as Hinayana, was a solitary salvation-focused religion without a deity, much like true Taoism. It divided people into two categories: monks who could attain salvation and the masses who supported the monks but could not achieve salvation themselves. This form of Buddhism did not take root in China, only leaving traces in certain Buddhist sects. On the other hand, Mahayana Buddhism evolved into a popular salvation-based religion that did not interfere with local deities or societal life. It offered a hereafter with desirable joys to strive for, ensuring its success in Asia. As Buddhism journeyed from India to China, it branched into various streams, each characterized by distinct texts and influences from Central Asian Shamanism and Tibetan magical beliefs. Despite Buddhism's influence, traditional peasant religions persisted, incorporating Buddhist terminology. Local diviners, Chinese shamans, and sorcerers continued their practices, sometimes integrating Buddhist concepts. The state cult in China, infused with Confucianism, coexisted alongside Buddhism and local traditions. The ruling foreigners adopted a blend of worship of Heaven and shamanism, organizing competitions between priests of different faiths and showing interest in skilled monks. The position of the ""official"" religion remained unresolved, posing a challenge since the fourth century.

The new Toba kingdom was a tribal state, not a military one. The tribes were different from those a century earlier. Their total population was likely small, remnants of 119 tribes rather than full tribes. Some lived nomadically while others led Chinese peasants. Facing challenges due to arid land, the Toba sought to conquer fertile eastern China. The question arose of what to do with the captives. Enslaving them was an option, but it would weaken central power. Chinese officials advised against tribal rule in the east, opting for central administration. The Toba converted tribes into military units, strengthening the government. The Toba realized Chinese were more reliable and integrated them into the administration, leading to sinification of the Toba empire.|['1.

"During the rebuilding of the Toba empire, many Hun tribes moved westward into the Ordos region, forming the Hun ""Hsia"" kingdom. The ruler, Ho-lien P'o-p'o, changed his family name to Ho-lien, showing a rejection of Chinese culture and a Hun nationalist sentiment. This created two realms in North China, one becoming more Chinese while the other embraced traditional Hun ways.

In the west, the Juan-juan people, a mix of Mongol and Turkish tribes, threatened the Toba from the north, leading to conflicts.

"During ancient times, a significant change occurred with the implementation of new land laws that legally defined social classes in China. This distinction between ""free burghers"" and ""commoners"" existed informally but became a legal concept under the new laws. Only the ""burghers,"" which included gentry and free farmers, were considered full citizens with all rights. Below them were the ""commoners,"" who were either partially or completely unfree. The lowest class consisted of real slaves, treated as property rather than human beings. Serfs, hereditary state servants, formed the next class, followed by private bondsmen attached to gentry families.

"The emperor, once known as Toba, embraced Chinese culture to integrate as a ruler in North China. He envisioned himself as the emperor of all China, viewing the South Chinese empire as a rebellious state. Despite overall success, the campaign against the south faced setbacks. The relocation of the capital to Loyang negatively impacted the Toba nobles, separating them from their tribes and livelihoods. The nobles struggled in an unfamiliar environment, marginalized by the Chinese in important roles. Buddhism gained prominence among the Toba rulers, uniting them with the Chinese under a common faith.

"We only know a few names of the artists behind these sculptures. Some may have been foreigners from Turkestan. Despite the Chinese influence, some sculptures resemble works from Turkestan and the Near East. In the past, people thought Greek art made its way through India and Turkestan to China, but this was exaggerated. Greek art influenced the Toba sculptures at Yün-kang, but the contents were different due to cultural development. Steppe rulers had a keen interest in sculpture and architecture. After the Toba period, sculpture thrived in China during the T'ang period, influenced by Turkish peoples. Buddhism faced conflicts between state and popular beliefs, leading to revolts among tribes. Confucianism gained power with the Chinese gentry, becoming the official religion. The struggle between central power and impoverished tribes intensified, leading to uprisings. Eventually, the Kao family took control, establishing the Northern Ch'i dynasty in the east, while the Yü-wen family founded the ""Northern Chou dynasty"" in the west."|"['1.

The Toba empire split into two separate realms due to a policy enacted during its foundation. Tribal chieftains and nobles were separated and organized militarily, leading to different social destinies. The nobles struggled against the Chinese and often merged into Chinese families. The tribespeople became destitute, sparking revolts. The Toba people failed to maintain their tribal and military structures. The emergence of the Gök Turks under their khan altered the dynamics in the north. The Turks allied with the Northern Chou, leading to the decline of the Juan-juan. The Turks emerged as a dominant force in Central Asia. The Northern Chou state focused on negotiations with the Turks and other neighbors. The state expanded its influence into South China through shrewd diplomacy. The Later Liang dynasty was established under Chou's protection in Hankow. Despite efforts to revive Toba traditions, the inner cohesion of the state had eroded, and a new state model similar to the Toba empire was established.|['1.

The Ch'i dynasty's internal politics were chaotic, with rulers lacking positive achievements. Confucianism was reinstated, causing trouble for Buddhists and Taoists. Despite this, impressive Buddhist cave-temples were built in Lung-men around A.D. 555. Ch'i faced ongoing battles with the Northern Chou state, often resulting in defeat. In 571, Ch'i briefly triumphed over Chou in the west but lost territory to the South Chinese empire and was later defeated in a counter-offensive. The Turks played a crucial role, annexing Ch'i's northern territories. Intrigues plagued the Chou court until power shifted to the Yang family. Yang Chien eventually declared himself emperor, establishing the Sui dynasty in 581. The Toba vanished after the Chou empire fell, with their nobility assimilating into Chinese society. South China also underwent changes during the 260 years of alien rule in the North.|"[""1.

The southern region was not devoid of inhabitants. Two groups resided there: the ancient local population comprising of Yao, Tai, and Yüeh, and the earlier Chinese settlers who had migrated from the north during the Three Kingdoms era in the third century A.D. The influx of new immigrants led to conflicts with the established settlers. Both groups held disdain for each other and engaged in verbal abuse. Not only did they speak different dialects, but they also varied in customs and manners. Economic and social differences also existed; the old settlers possessed capital and large properties, while the new immigrants, many of whom were military personnel, lacked land and sought government positions for stability. The surge in Chinese migration led to a rush for land cultivation, creating tensions and differences between the two groups.|['1.

"During a significant period in ancient China, the wealthy gentry in both the northern and southern regions indulged in leisurely pursuits. They retreated to expansive ""manors"" with fruit orchards, luxurious buildings, and artificial landscapes. These manors, once village commons, transformed into tax-free havens for the elite, featuring water-cooled houses, ponds, and bamboo groves. The gentry enjoyed the company of friends and women, escaping government duties. These estates, larger than legally restricted farmlands, played an essential economic role by producing goods like fish, vegetables, and bamboo for trade. Meanwhile, dietary habits shifted over time, with rice becoming the staple food in the south, compensating for protein deficiencies with increased vegetable and seafood consumption. The elite in the capital embraced luxury and civilization, engaging in music, poetry, and harem social life."|['1.

During the Eastern Chin dynasty, the rulers lacked significant personal or political qualities, limiting their power. The founder, Yüan Ti, was an exception as he had a strong foothold. A rising led by Wang Tun started near Hankow, a crucial trade hub. Wang Tun aimed to control the southern empire but was defeated by Yü Liang, whose family held power. After Yüan Ti's death, Emperor Ch'eng took the throne with Yü Liang's guidance. Su Chün, another northerner, briefly captured the capital but was overthrown. The Huan family, close to the imperial house, strengthened Yü Liang's group. Huan Wen led campaigns westward, reconquering Szechwan. Jointly, the Yü and Huan families fought northern states to safeguard their territories. The northern campaigns aimed to counter the north's expansion into the southern plains. These battles were challenging due to internal court politics and the threat from the north.|"['1.

During the historical period following, Huan Wen's influence grew steadily. He strategically placed his brothers and relatives to govern areas along the upper Yangtze, which were crucial for his authority. In 371, he removed the ruling emperor and replaced him with an elderly prince who passed away a year later, leading to a child taking the throne. Despite the opportunity to claim the throne for himself, Huan Wen passed away, leaving a void no one in his family could fill. The balance of power between the Huan and the Hsieh families temporarily preserved the dynasty. In 383, the Tibetan Fu Chien launched a significant attack on the south. Diplomacy and intrigue played a vital role in defending against this assault, resulting in the north facing a catastrophic outcome. The victories of the southern state notably bolstered the Hsieh family, whose military leaders rose to prominence. The emperor during this time, Hsiao Wu Ti, focused on Buddhism, women, and wine, rather than governing. Huan Hsüan, Huan Wen's son, emerged as a key figure in the court, forming alliances with the Wang and Yin families. This new alliance initially thrived but later faced setbacks, leading to internal conflicts and power struggles. Ultimately, Huan Hsüan seized power, deposed the emperor, and established his dynasty.

"During the rise of Liu Yü, his military strength and political influence grew steadily. He led a movement against the ruling Huan clique, eliminating their key supporters and eventually forcing Huan Hsüan to flee and meet his demise. Liu Yü's power became so dominant that the emperor was merely a figurehead. Before claiming the throne, Liu Yü embarked on a northern campaign to conquer western China, securing alliances and defeating the ""Later Ch'in"" in Shensi. His goals were to open new trade routes, strengthen his military, and weaken pro-Huan Hsüan elements. Despite initial victories, Liu Yü faced setbacks, losing territory to the Hun ruler Ho-lien P'o-p'o. After political maneuvering, Liu Yü became emperor in 420, founding the Sung dynasty. Conflict with the Toba ensued, leading to economic turmoil and territorial losses for the Sung. The Toba shifted their capital to Loyang, expanding southward and clashing with the Sung. Amidst power struggles and uprisings, the Hsiao family rose to prominence, establishing the ""Southern Ch'i"" dynasty. The Toba eventually prevailed, solidifying their rule in Loyang.

"The conflict between the Toba and the Liang lasted until 515. The Toba were often successful, aided by deposed princes of the ""Southern Ch'i dynasty."" In 507, the Toba suffered a significant defeat. They allied with native chieftains from the south against the Liang, causing unrest in the upper Yangtze provinces. The natives, pushed back by Chinese peasants, faced servitude or migration to the mountains. The southern state's strength was limited to the Nanking region. Emperor Wu Ti (502-549) of the Liang dynasty was known for his love of literature and Buddhism. He left politics to his court and the north gained political power. In 549, Hou Ching took control of Liang but was later overthrown by a Chinese army.

The end of the Northern Chou dynasty marked the rise of the Sui dynasty in China, reuniting the country under Chinese rule after 360 years. This transition brought about a new era in the Far East, despite the lasting impact of centuries past. The Sui period served as a bridge to unified governance, with the Chinese gentry gaining influence over the warrior nomads in the north. Culturally, the gentry adopted foreign customs while maintaining a sense of hierarchy within their ranks. The challenge of uniting the culturally and economically diverse north and south posed a significant obstacle for the Sui empire. Disparities in language, social structures, and population distribution between the regions required careful navigation for successful unity.|['1.

The founder of the Sui dynasty, Wen Ti, was a practical man from the west who lacked theoretical understanding. He was anti-intellectual and favored Buddhism over Confucianism. Wen Ti demanded obedience and thriftiness from his officials to stabilize the state's finances. He faced opposition from the gentry in the east and south due to budget cuts and exclusion from political affairs. Prince Kuang rebelled against Wen Ti, taking the throne as Yang Ti. Yang Ti moved the capital to Loyang, constructed canals for grain transport, and reformed the Confucian examination system.

During the rule of Emperor Yang Ti, P'ei Chü expanded policies by instigating the Tölös tribes to attack the T'u-yü-hun, a group residing in the far north of Tibet. P'ei Chü then launched an attack on the T'u-yü-hun, weakening their influence. The conquest aimed to secure access to Central Asia, but faced challenges due to the powerful Turks. To deter Turk dominance, strategies were employed to keep the Turk factions separated. In 615, the Turks retaliated, besieging the emperor in the Ordos region. Employing a clever ruse, the Chinese commander Li Shih-min tricked the Turks into believing reinforcements were imminent, leading to the Turks lifting the siege. The Sui period also saw conflicts with Korea, prompting China to consider alliances to counterbalance potential encirclement. The costly warfare, canal projects, and extravagant spending of Emperor Yang Ti led to economic strain and unrest, culminating in his assassination in 618 and the fragmentation of China into numerous small states.|"[""1.

During the Turkish siege, Li Shih-min, a key figure, formed an alliance with the Turks due to his family's tradition of marrying Toba women, earning him the trust of the Toba faction among the Turks. The origin of Li's family, the Li, remains debated. Claiming descent from the Western Liang ruling family, Li Shih-min continued the collaboration with the Turks to overthrow the Sui dynasty. In 617, Li Shih-min, with the support of a Turkish army, seized Ch'ang-an, placing a puppet emperor on the throne. By 618, Li Yüan, his father, became emperor, establishing the T'ang dynasty after internal conflicts until 623. The T'ang dynasty initiated land reforms aiming to equalize land ownership among peasants, but exceptions favored the gentry, leading to a new privileged class emerging.

During the Han period, there were two separate administrations: civil and military. Each area belonged to both an administrative prefecture and a military prefecture. The military power in the seventh century relied on a militia recruited from the farming population for short-term service. The emperor's guards were part of this militia. Over time, the system evolved, and the importance of the provincial armies declined as wars became longer. Special regional armies were created, and their commanders became more influential than civil administrators. Towards the end of the T'ang period, a state secretariat was established to handle economic and political affairs. The reforms of A.D. 624 initially worked well, increasing tax revenue and leading to a growing population and a bustling capital. The state budget grew significantly, supporting the expanding administrative needs of the empire.|"['1.

During the early T'ang period, the capital cities of Ch'ang-an and Loyang thrived with rich cultural life. Poets and artists of that time created masterpieces still admired today. These pioneers laid the foundation for the flourishing culture of the later T'ang era. Alongside this cultural growth came luxury and refined manners. Those who sought a quieter life outside the bustling capital turned to Taoism and Buddhism, particularly meditative Buddhism. Confucianism was the norm for the gentry, providing a moral basis without much discussion. The decentralization of power across cities like Loyang and the south created diverse cultural and commercial hubs. Foreign policy focused on relations with the Turks and Turkestan, leading to diplomatic maneuvers and conflicts. The Chinese sought to prevent alliances between Turks and Tibetans to safeguard their borders and interests.|"[""1.

The Turkestan wars commenced in 639 when the city-state of Kao-ch'ang (Khocho) faced an attack. Despite its prior friendly terms with North China, Kao-ch'ang had to yield to the western Turks, leading to Chinese intervention. By 640, Turkestan fell under Chinese control. The conflict primarily targeted the western Turks, who were weakened by internal unrest and the rise of the Uighurs. Li Shih-min played a crucial role during the T'ang rule, eventually becoming Emperor T'ai Tsung. His reign marked China's peak power under the T'ang dynasty, bolstered by internal stability and military control. China's influence extended to Korea and Japan, fostering cultural exchange and trade. The influx of foreign merchants enriched Chinese culture but posed economic challenges in the long run.|"[""1.

During this period, the power of the western Turks weakened as they faced threats from the advancing Islam and Arabs to the west. Meanwhile, the Tibetans grew stronger and expanded into the Tarim basin, defeating the Chinese in 678. The Tang dynasty faced challenges, with Empress Wu gaining influence after being made a concubine by Emperor Kao Tsung. She eventually became regent and later deposed her own son to become empress herself. Empress Wu favored the eastern gentry and Buddhism, moving the capital to Loyang and endowing Buddhists with wealth. Buddhism played a role in the rise of large-scale capitalism, with monasteries accumulating wealth in the form of bronze Buddha figures and influencing the money market. The eastern gentry, aligned with Empress Wu, also had ties to foreign merchants and Buddhism, shaping economic affairs during this period.|['1.

During the T'ang period, the cultural impact of Buddhism was evident in the translations of numerous texts and the journeys of pilgrims along trade routes, supported by merchants, reaching as far as western Asia and India, exemplified by the renowned Hsüan-tsang. Translations were not only from Indian to Chinese but also from Chinese to Uighur, Turkish, Tibetan, Korean, and Japanese. The Turks' actions were influenced by the eastern Chinese gentry during Empress Wu's reign. The Turks, previously under Chinese rule, sought to restore the T'ang dynasty under their control. Despite Empress Wu's efforts, the Turks continued their attacks until a T'ang prince, Emperor Hsüang Tsung, took power, initiating a period of cultural flourishing marked by significant advancements in literature, painting, and poetry. The T'ang poets, like Li T'ai-po and Tu Fu, introduced genuine emotions into their works, enriching Chinese literature.|"[""1.

During the T'ang period in China, Wu Tao-tz[)u] was a renowned painter influenced by Central Asian art. He painted for temples and was a devoted Buddhist. Another notable figure, Wang Wei, excelled in both painting and poetry, merging the two art forms. Chinese landscape painting began with Wang Wei and reached its peak in the Sung era. Porcelain, though initially brownish-yellow, was of high quality. It was a rarity in the T'ang period but later became a significant Chinese export. Emperor Hsüan Tsung supported the arts, with poets and painters enhancing court ceremonies. Taoism and Confucianism gained prominence over Buddhism during his reign. The emperor's capital shifted from Loyang to Ch'ang-an due to the influence of Li Lin-fu, who rose to power by manipulating court dynamics. An Lu-shan, a military governor, played a crucial role in the political turmoil of the time.|"[""1.

During a turbulent period in ancient China, the emperor faced rebellions from generals like An Lu-shan and Shih Ss[)u]-ming. An Lu-shan's uprising revealed the dangers of military governors gaining too much power when the central authority was weak. The conflict involved non-Chinese generals and even foreign allies like the Uighurs. The rebellion led to immense suffering for the population due to wars and looting. After Emperor Su Tsung's death, the Uighur khan Tengri attempted to seize control of China, but his plan was thwarted by P'u-ku Huai-en and Tibetan forces. The alliance between the Turks and Tibetans posed a significant threat to China until the Chinese under Kuo Tz[)u]-i managed to break it, aligning with the Uighurs to defeat the Tibetans and secure China's safety once again.|"[""1.

During the Tang dynasty, the Uighurs demanded silk and horses from the Chinese in exchange for their friendship, causing strain on the government. Military governors grew stronger, keeping tax revenue for themselves to fund their armies. The central government struggled to maintain control, leading to financial troubles. The Uighurs lost power, and the Chinese government seized foreign assets to address metal shortages. In 843, foreign religions were banned, and Buddhist temples were secularized to fill government coffers. Confucianism and Buddhism aligned to benefit the ruling class. The new emperor implemented policies favoring Buddhism, reshaping its doctrines to support the gentry.

The common people suffered greatly due to continuous warfare among military governors and internal conflicts, resulting in widespread poverty in ancient China. Popular uprisings were common but lacked organization until a major revolt sparked by famine in 860 in Chekiang. Led by Wang Hsien-chih, a peasant, and Huang Ch'ao, a former salt merchant, who joined forces with hungry peasants. Despite being educated, Huang faced limitations as a merchant, unable to participate in state examinations and facing discriminatory laws. The rebels quickly gained control of eastern China, as provincial troops sympathized with the peasant armies. The government's attempt to arm citizens against the rebels backfired, further strengthening the peasant forces. Wang refused a high-ranking government position to stand with his people. Ultimately, Huang Ch'ao seized power, becoming emperor after defeating the ruling family, marking a significant victory for peasant uprisings against the ruling elite.|"['1.

"During the fall of the T'ang dynasty in China, disorder reigned. Peasant armies rebelled against their governors, fighting for their own interests. The Turkish Sha-t'o, led by Li K'o-yung, remained loyal to the government until its overthrow, causing them to revolt. They faced defeat by a Chinese army commanded by an Uighur and fled to the Tatars. Despite this, the Chinese sought the Sha-t'o's help to eliminate Huang Ch'ao. Li K'o-yung's forces attacked the capital in 881, leading to a fierce battle. Huang Ch'ao managed to hold on until a final defeat in 883, resulting in his death by the Sha-t'o in 884. The T'ang dynasty ended, paving the way for a power struggle between Li K'o-yung and Chu Ch'üan-chung, with the latter eventually establishing the ""Later Liang dynasty"" in 907.

In ancient China, the ruling gentry faced significant changes after Huang Ch'ao's rebellion and the subsequent wars. Many noble families lost their influence, paving the way for commoners from Huang Ch'ao's followers to rise to power and wealth. By the year 1000, almost half of the gentry families were of humble origins. To protect their newfound status, these new gentry families established clan rules, kept private genealogies, and set up clan schools for education. The family head's power grew, allowing them control over property and even life and death within the family. Emperors also played a more prominent role, with some prioritizing the welfare of the masses over the gentry's profit. This period saw increased social mobility, with individuals gaining freedom to climb the social ladder through various means, like merchant families supporting lesser gentry families. The gentry became divided into big and small factions, with the former directing policy in the capital and the latter handling local affairs. Craftsmen also saw newfound freedom, organizing into guilds that provided welfare services, standardized products, and regulated prices. Guilds, however, did not hold political power but focused on trade within their respective cities.|"[""1.

"During the period of the Five Dynasties in China, which lasted from 906 to 960, regional associations known as ""hui-kuan"" were established. These groups brought together individuals from the same city or area who were living in a different city. Mainly consisting of businessmen from various trades, these associations elected chiefs and councillors to lead them. Some of these regional groups acted as pressure groups, often being financially stronger than guilds and owning city property or farmland. While not all merchants were part of these organized associations, they were able to bypass restrictions on their clothing and transportation. Trade, particularly overseas trade, expanded significantly during this time, with the emergence of specialized offices in coastal ports to handle customs, registration, and interactions with foreign traders. Additionally, the eleventh century saw the rise of industrial enterprises, with some individuals running monopolistic operations in areas like iron production. The economy shifted towards a money-based system, leading to increased urbanization as farmers moved to cities for work. Wealthy individuals invested in both industry and agriculture, implementing innovative techniques like creating fields below water levels for irrigation and combining pig and fish breeding. The introduction of money taxes spurred the need for more coinage, with iron coins and paper money being issued. This period also saw a rise in speculation and financial planning, both in business and government operations.

During ancient times in South China, the state of Ch'u thrived due to trade, notably the tea trade. Tea drinking, originating from Tibet, spread in the third century A.D. to regions like Szechwan and southeastern China. By the Tang era, tea consumption was widespread, leading to the rise of wholesalers who bought tea from farmers and distributed it. Attempts were made by the state in 783 to monopolize the tea trade but failed to make cultivation a state monopoly. This led to collaboration between officials and wholesalers, who eliminated small traders for profit. Similar situations occurred with salt production; officials associated with wholesalers or monopolies, particularly in Szechwan. The region's salt wells, dating back to the first century B.C., were vital due to the high salt consumption in China. South-eastern China also emerged as a significant porcelain production center, with exports reaching Eastern Africa by the fourteenth century. The porcelain industry required substantial investment and state control in its early stages.|"[""Question 1: What was one of the main factors that contributed to the thriving of the state of Ch'u in ancient South China?\nA) Silk trade\nB) Tea trade\nC) Spices trade\nD) Salt trade\nE) Porcelain trade"", 'Question 2: In which century did tea drinking spread to regions like Szechwan and southeastern China?\nA) First century A.D.\nB) Second century A.D.\nC) Third century A.D.\nD) Fourth century A.D.\nE) Fifth century A.D.', 'Question 3: What led to the rise of wholesalers in the Tang era?\nA) Silk production\nB) Rice cultivation\nC) Tea consumption\nD) Salt mining\nE) Porcelain crafting', ""Question 4: What was the outcome of the state's attempt to monopolize the tea trade in 783?\nA) Successful state monopoly\nB) Collaboration between officials and farmers\nC) Collaboration between officials and wholesalers\nD) Elimination of large traders\nE) Increase in small traders' profits"", 'Question 5: In addition to tea, what other industry faced similar situations of collaboration between officials and monopolies?\nA) Silk production\nB) Rice cultivation\nC) Salt production\nD) Porcelain crafting\nE) Spices trade', 'Question 6: Where did the exports of porcelain from South-eastern China reach by the fourteenth century?\nA) Europe\nB) Middle East\nC) Eastern Africa\nD) South America\nE) Australia']"|['B) Tea trade', 'C) Third century A.D.', 'C) Tea consumption', 'C) Collaboration between officials and wholesalers', 'C) Salt production', 'C) Eastern Africa']
One significant advancement was the invention of printing, starting with wood-block printing around 770 AD. The first mention of a printed book was in 835, and the pivotal moment came when the Classics were printed under Feng Tao's orders around 940. While movable type was attempted in China around 1045, it gained more traction in Korea from the 13th century and later revolutionized Europe from 1538. This innovation democratized access to books, making them more affordable and abundant. Scholars could amass personal libraries and explore a wider range of texts. Education spread, with more people learning to read and write. Private libraries emerged, diversifying literature beyond classic works. In North China, the introduction of paper money prototypes facilitated trade by overcoming the limitations of heavy copper coins. This led to the development of a banking system and boosted commerce.|"['1. What significant advancement is discussed in the text?\nA. Invention of the internet\nB.

The southern states were significant for the northern dynasties' strategic plans. Despite internal conflicts among the southern kingdoms, any of them could ally with the Turks or other northern powers. The capital of the initial northern dynasty, the Later Liang, was situated near the southern territories, close to present-day K'ai-feng. This location was easily accessible due to the fertile plains and good transportation. However, the town's defense solely relied on the Yellow River, making it militarily vulnerable. The founder, Chu Ch'üan-chung, faced threats from both northern and southern fronts. Internal turmoil within the Later Liang state arose from a dynasty established through a peasant uprising, leading to conflicts with the gentry. These internal and external challenges paved the way for the rise of the Later T'ang dynasty in North China.|"['1.

In 936, the Later T'ang dynasty was replaced by the Later Chin dynasty (936-946). However, this change did not alter the empire's structure. The shift in dynasties simply meant that instead of a son succeeding his father, the son-in-law took the throne. What was more significant was that the son-in-law, Sha-t'o Turk Shih Ching-t'ang, secured his position by forming an alliance with the Kitan and giving them control of some northern provinces. The new ruler of the Later Chin dynasty soon realized that the Kitan saw his dynasty as a mere stepping stone to annexing all of North China. The Sha-t'o nobles, who had not adopted Chinese ways, suggested a preemptive war, while the sinified court group hesitated but eventually had to engage in war. The conflict was swiftly resolved as several eastern Chinese governors defected to the Kitan, who then occupied the capital and most of the country by 947.|"[""1.

Chao K'uang-yin, the founder of the Sung dynasty, hailed from a Chinese military family near Peking. Rising from a general to an emperor, he initiated a new approach in foreign policy. Unlike his predecessors, his dynasty endured due to his longer reign and strategic decisions. The Sung dynasty shifted its focus to the south, engaging in peaceful annexations of economically prosperous but militarily weak states. This expansion led to increased economic stability and trade opportunities, extending as far as Indonesia. The empire's policy of nonintervention in the north, paying tribute to the Kitan, proved more cost-effective than maintaining large armies. By pacifying the south and bolstering tax revenues, the Sung dynasty saw significant financial growth, setting the stage for potential prosperity had military expenses not escalated.|"[""1.

"During the Sung dynasty, the emperor's role evolved. Emperors were once chosen for their military prowess, like in Imperial Rome. However, over 300 years, the emperor's position changed. They had more personal influence if active and intelligent but were also closer to their ministers. Ministers showed familiarity, patting the emperor's shoulder, even falling asleep on his knee without punishment. Emperors like ""_kuan-chia_"" (Administrator) saw themselves as guides rather than owners of the empire. The Sung rulers were ""moderate absolutists,"" not despots. The new emperor in 963 reorganized the country's administration, merging civil and military administrations. The army transitioned to mercenaries, growing in numbers but not in strength. Military costs rose, leading to increased coin production and circulation, with minting costs high. Metal production boomed, but the capital's distance from the metal source posed challenges in coin distribution."|"['1.

During the 11th century in China, there was a significant increase in the circulation of money to meet rising expenses. The state budget surged from 22.2 million in A.D. 1000 to 150.8 million in 1021. The Kitan state minted a lot of silver, and some tribute was paid in silver. This led to more silver being used in China, creating new opportunities for speculation, especially with silver and copper rates. Deposit certificates were issued by the state, and the first paper money soon followed. The paper money and certificates could be redeemed but at a slight reduction in value, providing revenue to the state. However, inflation resulted from these actions, benefiting large merchants who had to cover various non-agricultural taxes. Despite official anti-business sentiments, economic insights began to emerge, such as the impact of peace times and population decreases on deflation. The government attempted to manipulate prices, including through intervention in grain markets. These financial and fiscal changes mirrored developments in medieval Europe that eventually led to industrial capitalism.|['1.

During the Sung period, large landowning caused problems for officials in China. First, the officials received small salaries, so they were given land to supplement their income. This land was tax-free, and soon officials managed to avoid paying taxes on all their land. Second, a new tax system made the amount of tax proportional to the land owned, hurting small peasant-owners who barely survived on their land. In the south, big landowners evaded taxes, forcing small peasants to pay or become tenants. In the north, war had devastated the land, leading to the disappearance of landlords. The capital attracted land control by the gentry, shifting production to silk and vegetables. As the capital moved, reorganization occurred, affecting revenue and causing budget deficits. Emperor Shen Tsung supported reforms by Wang An-shih to counter the ruling gentry clique's _laisser-faire_ trade policy, benefiting small landholders and dealers.|"['1.

During Wang's reforms, prices fell sharply, causing deflation. This change faced opposition from large plantation owners, allied merchants, officials, and landlords near Loyang. Even some of Wang's former supporters turned against him. The emperor eventually had to abandon the new policy due to the strong resistance. Economic interests were clearly at play, as Wang faced backlash even on non-economic decrees. The struggle between the two groups continued, with monopolistic landowners dominating from 1086 to 1102. The advocates of Wang's policies briefly regained power but faced challenges. Both groups opposed granting too much freedom to the middle class and merchants, leading to illegal practices for gaining freedom. Social classes were distinct with specific dress codes, house designs, and burial norms. The lower classes received social security measures to maintain stability. State initiatives included granaries, medical care, housing for the destitute, and orphanages. Buddhist priests often provided medical care, burial services, and hospitalization. Geisha houses and public baths were also established for social welfare.|"[""1.

"During the eleventh century in China, social services were extended to officials and even criminals. Offices closed every tenth day and during holidays, totaling about eighty days annually.

Scholar circles and private schools were established across the country. Philosophical schools had varying political stances and literary preferences.

In 1126, during the Juchên's capture of the Sung capital, a brother of the emperor escaped and established the ""Southern Sung"" dynasty in Nanking.

During the Southern Sung period, the Sung dynasty faced a severe threat from the Mongols. The Sung were defenseless without buffer states and lacked adequate military defense. They hoped to resist the Mongols as they had done with previous invaders but misjudged the situation. The Mongols defeated the Sung multiple times, eventually capturing their capital and emperor in 1276. The period saw a flourishing culture, but the imperial court was controlled by the greater gentry. The lesser gentry and intellectuals struggled financially, leading to a lack of political involvement. The greater gentry lived elegantly, speculating in land and paper money. The Hakka people, ancestors of migrants from Honan, faced hardships due to war and migration. Chia Ssu-tao proposed a reform to strengthen military power, but faced opposition from the greater gentry, leading to his demise.

The Juchên, once a league of Tungus tribes, rose to power under the Kitan rule after the fall of Po-hai in Korea. After defeating the Kitan in 1114, their leader declared himself emperor in 1115, establishing the Chin dynasty. By 1125, the Kitan empire was no more, and the Sung fell in 1126. The Chin's conquests reached the Yangtze River by 1130. However, internal conflicts arose due to land acquisition and wealth distribution, leading to a united Chinese front against the Chin. The Chin's struggles with internal crises and external threats, like the emerging Mongol power, weakened their empire. The rise of the Mongols in 1147 marked the beginning of their dominance in Asia, posing a significant threat to the Chin. As a result, the Chin shifted focus away from the Sung to deal with the looming Mongol threat.|['1.

In 1210, the Mongols initiated a major attack on the Chin after conquering the Hsia. By 1215-17, they seized crucial military positions from the Chin, weakening their defense. The Chin empire eventually succumbed to the Mongols in 1234. Many Chin people joined the Mongols and later returned to Manchuria, regressing culturally. It wasn't until the sixteenth century that these Tunguses, now known as Manchus, reemerged. During more than half of the period from 1280 to 1911, China was under foreign rule for 355 years, first by the Mongols and later the Tungus Manchus. The Mongols' success over previous rulers was attributed to their advanced military and numerical strength. They integrated different ethnic groups into their administration, with Mongols holding top positions and auxiliary peoples like Uighurs assisting due to their language skills.|"[""1.

During the Mongol era, two significant influences impacted the peasants: organized religion and traders. While the Chinese upper classes generally showed little interest in religion, the Mongols, being historically religious, embraced Buddhism and Shamanism. Chinese Buddhists and Taoists sought to engage the Mongols, resulting in many adopting Buddhism or popular Taoism. Temples received vast estates, exempting them from taxes, leading to peasants working on temple lands as servants. Additionally, some peasants were compelled to serve in military settlements, providing support for the army. The state's increased expenditure, due to many Mongols receiving benefits, led to higher taxes. Foreign traders enjoyed privileged status, accumulating wealth that left China, causing economic decline. The outflow of metallic currency forced the government to issue depreciating paper money, further impoverishing the population.|"['1.

During the Mongol era in China, trade flourished, connecting Europe to the Pacific, but this led to China's decline. Magnificent temples rose, yet the country suffered. The Mongol rule brought both grandeur and impoverishment. Travelers like Marco Polo praised the empire, but they only saw the privileged side. By 1325, about 7.6 million people were starving, a significant portion of the 45 million population. Rebellions erupted in 1329, led by commoners against the rich, not the Mongols. The gentry, fearing for their lives, supported the Mongols against the rebels. In 1351, floods triggered revolts, leading to central China falling to rebel groups. The rebels' goals shifted from fighting the rich to expelling the Mongols, turning a social movement into a national one. The rebels spared some gentry to gain their allegiance, altering the rebels' cause.|"['1.

In 1352, Kuo Tz[)u]-hsing, a successful leader from southern Honan, rose to power. He was joined by Chu Yüan-chang in 1353, a former monk from a peasant family. Chu's group, identified by red turbans and banners, allied with Kuo. After Kuo's passing in 1355, Chu inherited his army and expanded his control over eastern China. Chu's strategy shifted from attacking individuals to gaining control over regions, supported by influential gentry members. This transition marked Chu's transformation from a popular leader to a rebel against the dynasty. His conquests included Nanking and provinces in the south-east, leading to the collapse of the ruling dynasty by 1368. The Mongol ruler fled, and Chu's forces captured Peking, ending the Mongol dynasty's rule with minimal resistance.|"[""1.

The downfall of the Mongols had several key reasons. Firstly, their military strength waned due to idleness and a lack of preparedness during times of peace. Secondly, their attempt to govern through foreign rulers and exclude the Chinese elite led to financial mismanagement and alienation of the populace, causing widespread poverty and unrest. Thirdly, a growing sense of apathy among the Mongols towards maintaining their rule in China, coupled with a desire to return to their homeland in the north, contributed to their eventual collapse. It is crucial to understand these factors to compare them with the later decline of the Manchus. Despite the political turmoil, the Mongol period saw notable advancements in opera, with intellectuals contributing to librettos, creating a rich theatrical tradition that remains influential today.|['1.

During the Mongol period, foreign influence strongly impacted the fine arts, particularly in sculpture and architecture. The Mongol rulers' preference for Lamaism, a form of Buddhism from Tibet, led to significant artistic developments. Lamaism, blending Tibetan beliefs with Buddhism, spread through Mongolia and China, influencing religious sculptures and architectural styles. Notably, Tibetan pagodas gained prominence in China, distinct from traditional pagodas. The Mongols also introduced carpet-knotting and cloisonné techniques to China. While painting remained largely uninfluenced, popular uprisings marked the latter half of Mongol rule in China. Chu Yüan-chang's movement, initially social, evolved into a national struggle against the Mongols, resulting in the Ming dynasty's establishment. The Ming epoch was shaped by these events, emphasizing China's cultural identity and fostering a sense of nationalism.|"['1.

"During the Ming dynasty in China, the Mongols were driven out of the country but retained strength in their own land. Despite Chinese efforts, the Mongols reorganized and launched counter-attacks. Over time, the Chinese gained influence in Turkestan, though it was always contested. As the Mongol empire fragmented, small states emerged in Turkestan. China engaged in conflicts with the Mongols during this period. Japanese piracy plagued China's coastal provinces, disrupting trade and necessitating fortifications. The Ming government struggled to defend against Japanese raids due to logistical challenges and the inability to garrison the entire coast effectively. The raids hindered the development of a Chinese navy. The Chinese viewed foreigners arriving by ship as ""barbarians,"" including Europeans.

Chu Yüan-chang and his group were influenced by Mongol ideas and traditions, leading them to maintain a monarchy. Huang Tsung-hsi was the first to timidly discuss alternative forms of government at the end of the Ming dynasty. Chu saw the emperor as an absolute ruler, mirroring the Mongol emperors' grandeur and lavish spending in Peking. Chu failed to realize that Peking had been the capital of a vast empire, and the expenses were justified. Chu's regime distributed vast land grants to relatives and supporters, draining the state's resources. The Ming dynasty enforced strict laws on craftsmen and merchants, limiting their freedom and mobility. The Ming dynasty faced challenges with military colonies to supply troops in distant regions, leading to clashes with native tribes. The government incentivized merchants to transport grain to the borders, but the system was short-lived due to rising grain prices and decreased army efficiency.|"['1.

"The history of Chinese agriculture underwent significant changes during the Ming dynasty, leading to what is known as an ""agricultural revolution."" Innovations such as deep-lying fields near cities, terracing mountain slopes, and introducing new irrigation machines like the Persian wheel transformed agricultural practices. The introduction of drought-resistant rice from Indo-China's Champa kingdom in 1012 was a game-changer, allowing for increased productivity and the ability to grow two rice harvests in a year. Fish were also introduced into rice fields, providing both food and fertilization, enabling continuous cultivation without a decrease in fertility. This revolution not only boosted food production but also impacted population growth and urbanization. Cotton cultivation also played a significant role in Chinese agriculture, with its introduction leading to the development of textile industries and urban centers like Nanking and Shanghai becoming hubs of cotton cloth production."|['1.

In the Yangtze cities, the rise in consumption led to an increase in land value, prompting small farmers to move south. Absentee city landlords depended on seasonal labor from Chekiang farmers after their own harvest. The area near cities saw more planting of vegetables, mulberries, and cotton. Rice prices surged, prompting the growth of a large organization of rice merchants. These merchants bought rice from Hunan, transported by smaller merchants from river boats. This led to increased local grain prices, causing tension as locals attacked grain boats to protect their markets. Salt merchants in Hsin-an also thrived, specializing in silver trade and later monopolizing various businesses like salt, rice, cotton, and silk. The porcelain industry also flourished, with private factories emerging due to high demand. The paper industry boomed alongside printing advancements, while silver became popular for speculation due to the Ming dynasty's currency changes.

During the Ming dynasty, blue and white porcelain from Ching-te-chen, Kiangsi, gained popularity. Initially coarse, it improved in the 15th century but declined in the 16th century due to a change in cobalt source. Ming porcelain also featured brilliant red and three or five-color designs. Exported to Europe, it influenced European ceramics like Delft. The Ming era was known for lacquer and cloisonné work. After founding the dynasty, Chu Yüan-chang faced challenges with his revolutionaries. He managed internal conflicts by pitting them against each other. Nanking became the capital, but power struggles persisted. Yung-lo, the third emperor, moved the capital to Peking, sparking social and economic tensions. His reign was marked by luxury, reflecting Ming's decline.|"['1.

After the Mongol rule fell in Indo-China, leading to independence movements in parts of China and Indo-China, wars erupted in Annam in 1393. Yung-lo saw an opportunity to expand Chinese trade and influence by annexing these regions. He dispatched armies to Yünnan and Indo-China and commissioned a fleet led by Cheng Ho to protect Chinese interests. Cheng Ho embarked on a significant journey in 1405, reaching as far as Arabia. The expeditions were costly, and with the region's canals repaired by 1415, trade routes shifted away from the seas. Cheng Ho's travels also brought cultural exchanges, introducing Middle Eastern fairy tales to China, enriching the country's storytelling traditions. These tales, originating from Persia and India, eventually made their way to Europe through various routes.|"[""1.

During the rule of Yung-lo's successor, the emperor Hsüan Tsung, the state examinations faced issues. Candidates from the north were being excluded as the gentry from the south manipulated the system. This led to protests from the northern military, resulting in a compromise where one-third of the candidates were to come from the north and two-thirds from the south. When Hsüan Tsung passed away, his eight-year-old son Ying Tsung inherited the throne but was under the influence of the Yang clique. Subsequently, the eunuch Wang Chen took control and led a failed military campaign against the Mongols, resulting in the emperor's capture. After several power struggles between different cliques, the deposed emperor Ying Tsung was reinstated, leading to further political unrest and conspiracies. This period saw the rise of dictatorship tendencies with the establishment of a secret police headquarters. In 1505, Wu Tsung came to power but was manipulated by the eunuchs, particularly Liu Chin, who orchestrated purges and amassed immense wealth for personal gain, leading to further corruption and political turmoil.|"[""1.

In 1510, a group led by Liu Chin, who had punished members of the Yang clique and the philosopher Wang Yang-ming, learned of Liu Chin's plans through a palace eunuch. The eunuch, unknown to Liu Chin, became an army commander during a revolt in western China. This led to an attack on Liu Chin's palace, resulting in his arrest. The philosopher Wang Yang-ming then rose to power. Liu Chin's rule, marked by high taxation for personal gain and the emperor's extravagance, led to a popular uprising. The rebellion spread from the west to the east, targeting officials who did not join. In 1512, rebels were defeated due to a typhoon sinking their fleet. In 1517, the emperor toured the north, while Wang Yang-ming crushed a rebellion in Kiangsi in 1518. Wang Yang-ming's expeditions included defeating salt-merchant rebels in Kiangsi and learning about European rifles from the Portuguese.|"[""1.

"All major schools of Chinese thought were influenced by Confucius. Wang Yang-ming, a philosopher, also followed the teachings of Confucius but broke away from the Neo-Confucian trend led by Chu Hsi. Wang Yang-ming introduced the concept of ""intuition"" into Confucian philosophy, viewing it as the key to true knowledge. This idea was influenced by meditative Buddhism, particularly the work of philosopher Lu Hsiang-shan. Wang Yang-ming's philosophy was part of the Southern or Lin-ch'uan school, originating from Wang An-shih's teachings. Despite his efforts, Wang Yang-ming's philosophy did not gain traction in China due to its alignment with individual despotism. However, his ideas found popularity in Japan and even attracted figures like Chiang Kai-shek. The political landscape during the reign of Emperor Shih Tsung was marked by internal intrigues, revolts, and external conflicts with countries like Annam and Japan. The Mongol ruler Yen-ta posed a significant threat, leading to prolonged battles and eventual compromises. The trade relations with the Mongols gave rise to a local merchant class in Shansi. The subsequent reign of Emperor Shen Tsung was also marked by political influences and conflicts within China and with neighboring tribes. These events set the stage for the rise of the Manchus, who would later dominate China for centuries."|"['1.

In 1592, Japan invaded Korea in an imperialistic move, prompting Korea to seek aid from China. Although the Chinese army initially struggled, by 1598, Japan was forced to abandon Korea. In retaliation, the Japanese intensified raids on central China's coast, causing devastation. The conflict in Korea also influenced the Tungus tribes, indirectly strengthening them. Meanwhile, in 1600, the East India Company was established. European Jesuit Matteo Ricci gained access to the Chinese court in 1601, impressing them with European astronomy. Despite missionary efforts in China, the conversion to Christianity faced political obstacles. By the early 18th century, missionary activities were restricted for political reasons. The Manchu threat emerged around 1620, with Nurhachu leading successful attacks and establishing the Tai Ch'ing dynasty. Other challenges included a pirate uprising in Formosa and popular uprisings in western and eastern China, reflecting deep-seated social issues.|"['1.

"In the capital, there were fierce conflicts between different groups that reached a peak. After the death of Shen Tsung, his son took over briefly before his sudden death, leaving his 16-year-old grandson as the new emperor. This young emperor was heavily influenced by a eunuch named Wei Chung-hsien, who quickly rose to power and eliminated all his rivals, including other eunuchs. The literati gentry formed a defensive group known as the Tung-lin Academy to counter Wei's influence. As chaos spread across the country, the gentry, organized in these academies, no longer supported the government. Insurgents like Li Tz[)u]-ch'êng and Chang Hsien-chung emerged, seeking personal gain rather than a coherent vision. Meanwhile, the Manchus were gaining strength, eventually conquering Korea and establishing a new military structure called the ""Banner Organization.""

In 1644, Li Tz[)u]-ch'êng captured Peking due to the city's weak defense caused by disorganization and lack of pay for the soldiers. The Ming emperor committed suicide, and a new prince fled through China but faced defeat. Li Tz[)u]-ch'êng failed to establish a stable government, allowing General Wu San-kui to seize power with Manchu support. The Manchus, despite being foreigners, gained control by exploiting China's internal turmoil. They imposed laws that offended Chinese national pride, leading to their acceptance. Manchu soldiers were stationed in cities without the need to work, and a dual government favored the Manchus. Despite initial resistance, the Manchus eventually established control by capturing economic centers and gaining support from the gentry. The Manchus' ability to maintain power despite initial opposition was due to their strategic conquests and eventual collaboration with the Chinese elite.|"[""1.

During the reign of Louis XIV in Europe and while Cromwell was reforming England, the Manchus conquered China. Wu San-kui, a key figure, tried to unite with the gentry against the Manchus, but they did not support him. Wu San-kui's successor, Wu Shih-fan, was defeated in 1681. This marked the end of national governments in China. The Manchus established a reputable government in Peking, winning over the gentry by allowing land ownership and using troops to clear rebels. The young emperor Sheng Tsu (K'ang-hsi) promoted Chinese culture and scholars, leading to a period of stability and recovery. However, by the 18th century, there was a decline due to foreign wars, extravagant building projects, and European trade. The lack of focus on internal developments during this period has left gaps in historical understanding.|"[""1.

The decline of the Manchu dynasty started before significant European trade and not after China yielded to foreign Capitulations in 1842. The real reason for the decline wasn't just financial; it was also due to a general impoverishment of China. While the number of wealthy gentry decreased, the middle class, educated but with little money, grew. The population steadily increased from 1578 to 1850, reaching over 400 million. However, agricultural productivity didn't match population growth. By the 18th century, the pressure on land was immense. Internal colonization helped in some regions but not enough. In contrast, Europe and Japan managed population growth through industrial development, preventing a decrease in farm sizes. China's heavy reliance on farming remained high, leading to economic challenges.|"['1.

From the mid-17th century onwards, trade activities, especially along the coast, continued to grow. Wealthy families supported sons who were not interested in studying or becoming officials by providing them with money to start businesses. Areas like Kwangtung and Kwangsi were perfect for trading Chinese goods at high prices to native tribes and settlers. Some introduced new methods to set up dye and textile factories in the south. European trade played a significant role, with American silver flowing into China from the early 17th century. By the late 18th century, opium trade became profitable, affecting silver prices and farmers. The gentry were against industrialization, preferring land investments due to government control. Despite obstacles, Chinese business and industry progressed slowly under the Manchu dynasty, especially during the K'ang-hsi rule. Campaigns were conducted to remove opposition, leading to the occupation of Formosa in 1683. The Manchus' cultural shift towards Chinese ways caused tension with the Mongols, resulting in attempts to establish an independent Mongol realm.|['1.

The Manchus were concerned about the expansion of territories that could threaten their homeland, Manchuria. Battles between 1690 and 1696 led to the defeat of Galdan. In 1715, there were new disturbances in western Mongolia when Tsewang Rabdan rebelled against the Chinese. This conflict extended into Turkestan and involved the Dzungars and Turkish populations. The Chinese eventually conquered Mongolia and parts of eastern Turkestan. They also intervened in Tibet, installing a new Dalai Lama and making Tibet a protectorate. Around the same time, the Russians were expanding their empire in Asia, leading to tensions with the Manchus. The Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689 marked the first agreement between China and a European power. Subsequent negotiations in 1727 led to a new treaty allowing Russians to establish a presence in Peking, marking the beginning of foreign Capitulations.

"During the K'ang-hsi period, Chinese culture experienced a revival. The emperor attracted scholars to his court to help govern the vast empire, as his Manchu advisors lacked the necessary education. He had a keen interest in Chinese culture and compiled extensive encyclopedias to deepen his knowledge. These encyclopedias provided a wealth of information on various topics, aiding the emperor in his rule. Unlike French encyclopedias of the time, which aimed to spread knowledge widely, Chinese encyclopedias of the 17th and 18th centuries were primarily for the emperor's personal use. Notable works from this era include the geographical encyclopedia by Ku Yen-wu and the monumental _T'u-shu chi-ch'eng_. The period also saw the rise of the ""Han school"" of the Archaeological School, led by Tai Chen, known for his empirical and scientific approach. Literature flourished in forms like novels, short stories, and dramas, with works like _Hung-lou-meng_ and _Liao-chai chich-i_ gaining international acclaim.

During the mid-1800s, European influence grew in China. Yen Fu and Lin Shu led the translation movement, introducing Western ideas through books. This sparked a literary revolution in 1917. Porcelain craftsmanship flourished in the Manchu era, with exquisite pieces fired in Kiangsi kilns. European painting techniques, like those of Italian missionary Lang Shih-ning, influenced Chinese art. Missionaries at court promoted European science, shaping the idea of an enlightened monarchy in Europe. However, European merchants' questionable actions led to conflicts with the Chinese. Christianity faced a ban due to political suspicions. Guerrilla fights in southwest China and conflicts in Turkestan marked this period. The Kalmuks clashed with the Chinese, leading to territorial agreements. Unrest among Muslims in Turkestan prompted Chinese military actions.|['1.

"In 1795, the Ch'ien-lung emperor stepped down after a sixty-year rule and passed away in 1799. Jen Tsung (1796-1821), known as Chia-ch'ing, succeeded him. During his reign, a group called the ""White Lotus"" was suppressed, but a new uprising, the ""Society of Heaven's Law,"" emerged in North China in 1813. This secret group attempted to attack the emperor, but his son intervened to save him. The government quelled the uprising, but the discontent among the Chinese people persisted due to poverty and a growing anti-Manchu sentiment. Meanwhile, Western powers sought to colonize China, leading to cultural exchanges and conflicts. In 1842, China ceded Hong Kong to Britain after losing the First Opium War, which resulted from British merchants smuggling opium into China, causing social and economic turmoil."|"[""1.

"In the mid-19th century, China faced challenges due to treaties like the Nanking Treaty and the Treaty of Tientsin. These treaties, signed with Britain, France, and the United States, allowed European supervision of Chinese customs and opened ports to foreign trade. The Most Favoured Nation clause in these treaties caused further issues, as any privilege granted to other nations had to be given to Britain automatically. The treaties also led to the rise of treaty ports like Shanghai, which rapidly developed into important cities. Despite attempts to evade treaty terms, conflicts arose, leading to the ""Lorcha War"" of 1857. Subsequent conflicts and the Treaty of Tientsin in 1860 further opened China to European influence, impacting its economy and society. This European penetration brought adverse effects, such as a negative trade balance, financial crises, and inflation, ultimately leading to China's dependence on foreign loans and economic privileges granted to other nations."|['1.

"The emperor Hsüan Tsung, also known as Tao-kuang, faced serious concerns beyond dealing with the Europeans. In Turkestan, where Turkish Mohammedans lived under Chinese rule, tensions arose due to conflicting religious and political beliefs. The Chinese government, rationalistic in nature, required all citizens to participate in official worship, causing unrest among the Mohammedans who refused to practice any other religion. The Chinese also imposed their laws on Turkestan, leading to continuous uprisings by the feudal lords and the Mohammedan population. In 1848, unrest spread to provinces like Hunan and Kwangsi due to pressure from Chinese settlers and European influence. Hung Hsiu-ch'üan, influenced by Christianity and ancient Chinese ideas, led a peasant revolution that aimed for social change. His movement, known as T'ai P'ing (""Supreme Peace""), advocated communal property, equal land distribution, women's rights, prohibition of vices, and equality for foreigners. Hung's vision attracted widespread peasant support, and by 1853, he had captured Nanking and established it as his capital, aligning with traditional Chinese customs to garner further backing."|"['1.

During the T'ai P'ing rebellion in China, the Europeans faced a dilemma. The T'ai P'ing claimed to be Christians, and the missionaries hoped to convert all of China to Christianity. However, the Europeans decided to side with the Manchus instead. The Manchus were supported by three key figures: a Mongol named Seng-ko-lin-ch'in, and two Chinese men named Tsêng Kuo-fan and Li Hung-chang. Tsêng and Li organized a militia to protect their homes from the T'ai P'ing. The T'ai P'ing movement was eventually pushed back to Nanking by 1856. Meanwhile, other parts of China were facing challenges like the Yellow River changing course and various uprisings. The Mohammedan revolts were particularly brutal, with estimates suggesting millions of lives lost. These revolts were fueled by general distress in China and tensions between different groups.|"[""1.

During the 19th century, several uprisings occurred among the Chinese Muslims known as Dungans. These revolts were distinct in that they did not aim to establish a unified Islamic state but rather resulted in the formation of small, short-lived states. One notable rebellion was led by Yakub Beg, who sought independence from Chinese rule in Turkestan. Despite forming alliances with powers like Russia and Great Britain, Yakub Beg's heavy taxation policies made him unpopular among his followers, leading to his eventual defeat by the Chinese general Tso Tsung-t'ang in 1877. Although Yakub Beg's rule ended, the region of Turkestan remained a point of contention between major powers like Russia and Great Britain, with the area eventually coming under Chinese control again. The region saw further changes in the 20th century, including periods of quasi-independence and eventual Soviet influence.|"['1.

During the reign of Emperor Wen Tsung and later Emperor Mu Tsung, China faced numerous rebellions, wars with Europeans, and conflicts with Japan. Emperor Mu Tsung ascended the throne as a child and was overshadowed by Empress Tz[)u] Hsi, who played a significant role in Chinese politics. Meanwhile, Japan underwent rapid Westernization and pursued an imperialist policy, expanding its territories to create the Greater Japanese Empire. Japan's aggressive actions led to conflicts with China, resulting in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894. China, under the leadership of Li Hung-chang, lost the war to Japan and had to sign a treaty relinquishing its protectorate over Korea and ceding Formosa. Russia's expansionist policies in the Far East also clashed with Japan's ambitions, leading to the Russo-Japanese War, where Russia lost and had to concede Manchuria to Japan.|"['1.

In the late 19th century, China faced challenges due to its lack of modern armament, which led to its defeat in the war against Japan. While Japan swiftly embraced Western industrialization, China's ruling class, particularly the dowager empress Tz[)u] Hsi, resisted modernization. The empress failed to grasp the necessity of modernization for China's independence, fearing it would undermine the existing power structures. However, reformers like Li Hung-chang recognized the urgency of change. The failure in the war with Japan intensified the call for reform in China. Japan's success in modernizing was contrasted with China's struggles, attributed to differences in social structures. Japan's strong middle class facilitated its transition to modern capitalism, while China's weak middle class hindered progress. Scholars like K'ang Yo-wei advocated for radical reforms, met with resistance from conservative gentry. The divide between north and south China further complicated reform efforts, with tensions escalating over foreign policy stances and suspicions of revolutionary sentiments.|"['1. **Question:** Why did China face challenges in the late 19th century, leading to its defeat in the war against Japan?\n- A) Lack of natural resources\n- B) Resistance to modernization by ruling class\n- C) Strong middle class hindering progress\n- D) Successful implementation of Western industrialization\n- E) Absence of foreign policy strategies', ""2. **Question:** Who among the following recognized the urgency of change and advocated for reform in China?\n- A) Tz[)u] Hsi\n- B) Li Hung-chang\n- C) K'ang Yo-wei\n- D) Conservative gentry\n- E) Middle class"", ""3. **Question:** What was the main reason for Japan's success in modernizing compared to China?\n- A) Strong foreign policy\n- B) Weak middle class\n- C) Conservative gentry\n- D) Lack of natural resources\n- E) Strong middle class"", ""4. **Question:** Who faced resistance from conservative gentry when advocating for radical reforms in China?\n- A) Tz[)u] Hsi\n- B) Li Hung-chang\n- C) K'ang Yo-wei\n- D) Dowager empress\n- E) Middle class"", '5. **Question:** What factor further complicated reform efforts in China, leading to tensions over foreign policy stances?\n- A) Lack of natural resources\n- B) Successful implementation of Western industrialization\n- C) Strong middle class\n- D) Divide between north and south China\n- E) Weak middle class', '6. **Question:** What did the dowager empress Tz[)u] Hsi fear would happen if China embraced modernization?\n- A) Strengthening of existing power structures\n- B) Weakening of social structures\n- C) Intensification of reform calls\n- D) Success in the war against Japan\n- E) Implementation of radical reforms']"|"['** B) Resistance to modernization by ruling class', '** B) Li Hung-chang', '** E) Strong middle class', ""** C) K'ang Yo-wei"", '** D) Divide between north and south China', '** B']"
In 1898, the empress Tz[)u] Hsi swiftly thwarted the emperor's reform efforts, leading to their arrest or execution. The emperor was confined in a palace near Peking until his passing, allowing the empress to resume her regency. The brief reform period ended abruptly due to the empress's reactionary rule. Subsequently, the Boxer Rising of 1900 targeted the gentry and Manchus, but negotiations redirected the movement against foreigners. This backfired when an international army marched to Peking, capturing the city and forcing the empress and emperor to flee. The peace treaty imposed heavy indemnities on China, aiding educational initiatives. The empress's return in 1902 prompted modest reforms to appease supporters, particularly in South China. Despite these efforts, the south remained hostile. Sun Yat-sen then emerged as a key figure in the reform party. General Yüan Shih-k'ai's loyalty wavered, and the empress's death in 1908 ushered in a period of political upheaval.|"[""1.

In 1911, China faced a challenging situation. Powerful countries like Europe, Russia, America, and Japan had their eyes on China, using it for their own interests without much regard for the Chinese government. Foreign capital was flowing in through loans and railway projects. The Chinese government needed money for war debts and reforms, leading to more freedom for regional leaders. This resulted in a struggle for independence among governors, similar to the end of the T'ang dynasty. Progressive movements started, leading to the establishment of a national assembly in 1910 with two houses. The Lower House, mainly representing provincial gentry, proved more practical than the routine officials in Peking. Revolts erupted against the regency and anti-Manchu sentiments grew. The situation escalated, leading to negotiations between revolutionary forces and the prime minister, Yüan Shih-k'ai, as they sought to navigate the changing political landscape.|"['1.

After the revolution in 1911, a provisional government was established in Nanking on December 29th, 1911. Sun Yat-sen became the president, and Li Yüan-hung became the vice-president. Subsequently, Yüan Shih-k'ai convinced the Manchu government to renounce the throne on February 12th, 1912, declaring the Republic as the constitutional form of the state. The last emperor of the Hsüan-t'ung period was placed in Manchuria but had no real power until 1945. The period between 1911 and 1927 saw significant social and intellectual changes in China. The gentry class was declining due to economic shifts, with their land losing value and facing competition from foreign goods. The emerging middle class, including traders and students influenced by Western ideologies, began to play a more active role in shaping China's political landscape.|"[""1.

In China during the early 20th century, there were three main social groups. Firstly, there was a small working class in Shanghai created by big capitalists. Secondly, there was a large uneducated peasantry willing to support anyone promising to improve their harsh living conditions. These peasants were prepared for uprisings against the ruling gentry. The middle class, a diverse group opposing the gentry and monarchy, faced challenges in achieving political success. Sun Yat-sen advocated for three stages of progress: fighting the old system, educating the public, and establishing true democracy. Economically, China needed Western industrial progress but lacked capital. The gentry resisted industrialization, and foreign investments led to political compromises. The intellectual landscape was changing, with Confucianism being rejected by the middle class in favor of Christianity, Buddhism, and modern philosophies like pragmatism and positivism. Education was modernizing, with universities becoming centers of progressive thought and scientific advancement.|"[""1.

"In 1919, China underwent a significant change known as the ""Movement of May Fourth."" This movement began when students at the National University in Peking protested against the government and pro-Japanese supporters on May 4th. The demonstrations led to more protests, student strikes, and a boycott of Japanese goods. Professors like Ts'ai Yüan-p'ei and Ch'en Tu-hsiu, who founded the progressive journal ""New Youth,"" played key roles in these actions. The movement aimed to modernize Chinese education and language. Ch'en Tu-hsiu advocated for a literary revolution, shifting from classical to vernacular language to make literature more accessible to all. This revolution also introduced new scientific and technical terms into the Chinese language. Despite proposals to switch to an alphabet, the unique Chinese characters have preserved cultural unity and linguistic diversity across China."|"['1.

"The goal of modern education in China is to promote a unified language, ""High Chinese,"" across the country and limit the use of regional dialects. This unity aims to prevent political divisions and preserve cultural cohesion. Progress has been made in standardizing spoken language, but the written script remains complex. Efforts are being made to simplify the script, following the example set by Japan. However, the transition to simplified characters has faced challenges, with differences between Chinese and Japanese forms. The early years of the Republic were challenging, with only a small educated class supporting the new government. Divisions existed within the revolutionary party regarding the form of the state, with differing visions ranging from socialism to liberal democracy. Despite these challenges, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen, enthusiasm for change grew, leading to the establishment of the Republic in 1912. Turbulence persisted in the early years, with various generals attempting to assert independence, hindering the government's effectiveness. The period leading up to 1927 was marked by internal strife and external pressures from foreign powers seeking to partition China. Tibet, a region of interest to European powers, faced tensions with China, leading to unresolved disputes and eventual military occupation by the communist regime in the 1950s."|"['1.

In the early 1900s, Outer Mongolia was a region where Russian interests were prominent. In 1911, there were diplomatic issues related to Mongolia. By the end of the year, the Hutuktu of Urga declared independence, expelling the Chinese. A treaty with Russia in 1912 recognized Outer Mongolia's independence, with Russia playing a role in the country's development. A 1913 treaty acknowledged Outer Mongolia's autonomy but kept it within China. The Russian revolution influenced Mongolia, leading to conflicts between White Russians, Reds, and Chinese. Mongolia eventually became a Soviet Republic. China initially didn't recognize Mongolia's independence. Japan also sought influence in Manchuria during this time. Japan occupied Tsingtao during WWI and aimed to control Shantung. Yuan Shih-kai attempted to turn China into an empire but faced opposition. Yuan's death ended the monarchy attempt. China faced challenges as provinces declared independence, leading to a dictatorship and power struggles among generals.|"[""1.

In the years following the First World War, China faced significant political turmoil as different factions vied for power. The southern region, under Sun Yat-sen's influence, established an opposition government in Canton, challenging the authority of the Peking government. Meanwhile, in the north, military generals like Chang Tso-lin, Wu P'ei-fu, Fêng Yü-hsiang, and Ts'ao K'un held sway, overshadowing the Peking government. Japan's control over China post-war led to tensions, with China feeling betrayed by Japan's actions. Efforts to exploit China financially led to international banking consortiums, which China resisted due to Japan's unfavorable reputation. Despite attempts to limit Japan's influence through international conferences, China continued to struggle with internal instability and external pressures. Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925 further complicated the political landscape, leading to internal party conflicts and the rise of leaders like Chiang Kai-shek in the south.|"['1.

In 1925, tensions rose between the People's Party of the south and foreign powers, except Japan, who supported them briefly due to anti-British sentiments in South China. Conflict escalated when British troops fired at a Shanghai protest on May 30th, 1925, sparking a boycott of British goods in Canton and Hong Kong. This boycott boosted Japanese trade as they gained control of Chinese coastal shipping. By 1926, the second party congress in Canton saw Chiang Kai-shek leading a campaign against the north with communist support. The southern government moved to Hankow as the communist-fueled peasant uprising gained momentum. In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek allied with capitalists in Shanghai, securing their support over land reforms. By 1928, Chiang Kai-shek unified China under his dictatorship, despite internal struggles and Japanese threats in North China.|"['1.

"Until 1931, the Nanking government was gaining strength and the confidence of western powers. They aimed to oppose Japan's expansion in the Pacific. This led to the removal of foreign control over the ""Maritime Customs"" and the government gained financial independence from the provinces. They built a modern army that faced challenges from the Communists and remaining generals. When Japan occupied Manchuria, Nanking couldn't prevent it due to loose association. The League of Nations condemned Japan's actions, but China broke away from Western powers. This allowed Japan to continue its advance. Chiang Kai-shek sought to delay conflict with Japan to strengthen his power and army. Western powers, focused on Europe, didn't intervene.

During World War II, Chiang Kai-shek's government fled to Ch'ung-k'ing, a vital city in China's interior. The Japanese swiftly conquered China's coast, cutting off supplies. Despite hard fighting, the Japanese advanced inland, seizing the eastern half of China. Chiang Kai-shek had limited support from the province of Szechwan and surrounding areas, lacking industry. People moved west with machinery and supplies, working under tough conditions. By 1940-1941, Japan had weakened China. Puppet governments were established, hoping to sway Chiang Kai-shek's supporters. Wang Ching-wei, an ex-democratic leader, cooperated with Japan. Japanese capitalists took over Chinese industries. Japan aimed to defeat Western powers in the Far East. The situation looked grim for Chiang Kai-shek's government, but hope emerged with slow progress and eventual liberation after Japan's defeat in 1945.|"[""1.

Although socialism and communism were concepts known in China for a long time, Chinese intellectuals were more intrigued by liberalistic and democratic Western ideas than by these ideologies. Initially, it was believed that communism was not suitable for China, as it was perceived to be more relevant in industrialized societies rather than agrarian ones. However, following the success of communism in Russia and the influence of Lenin's writings, Chinese intellectuals began to shift towards communism. Figures like Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-chao embraced communist ideologies, with Mao Tse-tung emerging as a prominent figure. The formation of the Communist Party in 1921 marked a significant turning point. Despite initial resistance, even Sun Yat-sen showed interest in Soviet Russia's developments, although he did not fully embrace communism. The collaboration between the Chinese Communist Party and the KMT faced challenges, leading to the eventual retreat of communists to Hunan. Mao Tse-tung's focus on organizing farmers laid the foundation for the success of communism in China. The tensions between the KMT and the communists escalated, leading to a split and the retreat of communists to the Hunan-Kiangsi border area. The Long March marked a pivotal moment as the communists fought their way to create a new socialistic state in Shensi. Despite setbacks, the communist movement continued to gain momentum, laying the groundwork for the future of Communist China.|"['1.

During the Japanese War, the communists in Yen-an and the Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek agreed to work together against the invaders. However, past distrust hindered their cooperation. With the Japanese controlling all of China's ports, supplies could only reach China in small amounts. The Nationalists believed Japan could only be defeated by the Western powers, not China. The communists set up guerrilla operations behind Japanese lines, controlling the countryside. American politicians were split on supporting the Nationalists or forming a coalition with the communists. After the war, the Nationalist government lacked popular support in areas freed from the Japanese. Farmers feared losing land to former landlords, workers sought new rights, and businessmen faced economic challenges. The civil war favored the communists, leading to their control over mainland China, while the Nationalists retreated to Taiwan. Taiwan's original population consisted of aborigines and Chinese settlers. Taiwan was under Japanese rule, which brought law and order, infrastructure development, and agricultural focus.|['1.

"After Chiang Kai-shek and his followers arrived in Taiwan, they were joined by many others fleeing the communist regime, mainly from Chekiang, Kiangsu, and the northern provinces of the mainland. Over time, around two million of these ""mainlanders"" settled in Taiwan. The Chinese Nationalists took control of the government, causing tensions with Taiwanese nationals who had resisted the Japanese occupation. The early years saw turmoil and violence until around 1960 when tensions began to ease. The educational system was reformed to promote Mandarin Chinese as the primary language and to provide more years of schooling. Initially, mainlanders dominated the government, military, and education, but over time, more Taiwanese took on leadership roles.

Before the war, China's transportation system was underdeveloped. Railroads linked industrial hubs, while bus and truck services connected smaller towns. However, crucial elements were missing: laws to safeguard investors, efficient credit systems, a supported insurance setup, and a modern tax structure. The monetary system was prone to inflation, and available resources were either sent abroad or invested for quick returns. Chronic unrest from warlords, revolutionaries, and foreign invaders hindered the Nationalist government's focus on development. With stability, China's progress accelerated. Communist China's development is unique for abandoning its native culture for a foreign ideology. Mao Tse-tung's success in adopting European ideas contrasts with analysts predicting a blend of traditional Chinese practices with socialist or communist principles. The Soviet Union supported China's industrial growth post-1950. While this boosted heavy industry, consumer goods lagged. China's military might grew, evident in the Korean War and the annexation of Tibet in 1950. Tibet's resistance to Chinese rule was quelled in 1959.|"[""1.

"In 1959, conflicts arose between China and India due to Chinese control of Tibet, leading to disagreements over the international border. The uncertainty of borders was evident in varying maps, whether Manchu or Indian. China also settled border disputes with Burma in 1960. Communist China took over Sinkiang, rich in oil and atomic industries, and encouraged Chinese immigration, altering the ethnic demographics. Inner Mongolia's dream of independence under Japanese protection during the war was short-lived. The Chinese Communists aimed to reclaim borders from the eighteenth century. They discussed territorial claims over areas like the Hi region and parts of Eastern Siberia. China's industrialization led to aggressive policies towards neighboring countries, funded by land reforms and socializing land.

Chinese leaders realize that achieving a better standard of living is challenging with high birth rates. They have hesitated to implement a family planning policy due to conflicts with Marxist doctrine, although it was briefly encouraged. The primary approach to controlling the birth rate has been advising delaying marriage. The restriction on private businesses and subsequent nationalization left many jobless. The shift of rural youth to cities for work led to returning excess urban populations to the countryside and enlisting urban youth for farming. The liberation of women in 1950, though promoting equality in marriage, also led to increased divorces. The new marriage law aimed to disrupt traditional family structures, seen as potential centers of resistance. The youth rebellion against established norms and the ensuing power struggle between Mao and Liu Shao-ch'i in the 1960s have caused unrest and division within China.|"['1.

Three key factors will shape China's future. Firstly, the rise of neo-communism, akin to Czechoslovakia in 1968, may alter traditional communist practices. Secondly, the Vietnam War's outcome will impact China's ambition for dominance in Southeast Asia. Will North Vietnam align more closely with Russia, creating separate spheres of influence in Asia, Africa, and South America? The third factor involves human nature. Can Chinese communism truly change ingrained tendencies towards family, property, and individuality? Scholars, writers, and poets face pressure to conform, risking their integrity for survival. While China's regime has weakened since 1966, it remains resilient. Taiwan's success suggests China's potential for rapid industrialization without ideological constraints.

Money and credit in ancient China are fascinating topics that have been studied extensively. Lien-sheng Yang's book, ""Money and Credit in China,"" published in 1952, is a great starting point for understanding these concepts. E. Stuart Kirby's ""Introduction to the Economic History of China"" from 1954 is also highly recommended for an overview of Chinese economic history. The size and structure of early cities have been explored by researchers like T. Sekino and Kat[=o] Shigeru. Scholars have differing views on the organization of cities during ancient times, with some believing they had a square layout. Additionally, the importance of irrigation systems and transportation networks in ancient China has been a subject of debate among historians.

"The concept of social mobility in traditional Chinese society has been extensively studied by scholars like Fr. L.K. Hsu and H.T. Fei. The focus is not solely on the economic or political power of families, but also on their social status as outlined in _Social Mobility in Traditional Chinese Society_. The social status was increasingly defined by law, according to Ch'ü T'ung-tsu. Differences in family sizes between gentry and non-gentry families have also been highlighted. Research suggests that gentry families tended to marry earlier on average. The Han examination system and the social origins of candidates have been analyzed by Yang Lien-sheng.

"The Chinese use of gold, dating back to around 600 B.C., is a topic of interest for M. Lombard's theories on gold's significance in the West. By A.D. 200, the use of gold in China declined, aligning with an economic downturn. Throughout history, China often made payments to border tribes, similar to British payments to tribes in India post-Independence. Tributary gifts in China were divided: one third for Imperial ancestor temples, one third for Imperial mausolea, and one third for guests of the Emperor. Glass found in Chinese tombs from the fifth century B.C. suggests trade with the Near East. The role of eunuchs in China, possibly originating in Asia Minor, remains to be fully explored.

During the T'ang period, relief measures were established, laying the groundwork for future social legislation. Chu Hsi's comprehensive study is essential, with Feng Yu-lan's essays providing insight into his influence on the Far East. Po-hai resumed tributary relations with North China post-defeat and engaged with South Chinese states. Kao-li adeptly played one state against the other. Early political developments are detailed by H.D. Martin in _The Rise of Chingis Khan and his Conquest of North China_. Economic questions were addressed using works by Wan Kuo-ting and H. Franke. The fate of Mongol groups post-dynasty breakdown was studied by H. Serruys. Lamaism's evolution in Mongolia and Japan-China relations require further research. The emergence of Hsin-an and Hui-chou merchants was driven by the need for grain and salt transport.|"[""1.

"The tax system during the Ming dynasty has been analyzed by various scholars. Liang Fang-chung studied this system, while Yoshiyuki Suto delved into tax evasion methods pre-reform. Wan Kuo-ting's data was used for land grants. It is believed that further research could reveal the significance of the ""agrarian revolution"" in China's economic and social progress, potentially altering dietary habits and increasing labor input. The revolution may have shifted focus away from technology and industry. The porcelain hub of Ching-tê-chen housed workers and merchants, with over 200 private kilns. Research on Central Chinese urban centers is needed. _Pien-wen_ studies by R. Michihata and translations of classic Chinese novels by various authors are also essential for understanding Chinese history and literature."|"['1.

On the topic of ancient weaponry, various scholars have delved into the history of explosives and cannons. Notable works include those by L.C. Goodrich, Feng Chia-sheng, G. Sarton, J. Pru[vs]ek, J. Needham, and M. Ishida. Additionally, K. Huuri's comparative study offers a broader perspective. For insights into historical figures like Wang and Lu Hsiang-shan, Chang Wei-hua and Huang Siu-ch'i's works are recommended. Altan Qan, also known as Yen-ta, played a significant role in Mongolian history, while the introduction of Lamaism into Mongolia is attributed to him. The influence of figures like M. Ricci and Coxinga, as well as events like the Szechwan rebellion, have been well-documented by various researchers. Furthermore, the development of Chinese industry has been explored by scholars like Norman Jacobs and Marion Levy, offering different perspectives. Relations between Tibet and China have also been thoroughly examined by scholars like L. Petech and M.W. Fisher.|"['1.

During the period under review, notable figures like Huang Tsung-hsi (1610-1695) were pivotal in discussing alternative forms of government, a departure from traditional monarchic systems. The emergence of trade entities known as _hong_ since 1686 and the dynamics of foreign trade are well-documented by scholars like H.B. Morse and J.K. Fairbank. The era saw significant events such as the Mohammedan revolts and the T'ai-p'ing Rebellion, extensively studied by scholars like Lo Hsiang-lin and Jen Yu-wen. The Nien-fei's connection to the White Lotus and the lesser-known Salars, Dungans, and Yakub Beg's rebellion are subjects that warrant further exploration. Insights into the early stages of Japan's industrialization, notably by scholars like H. Rosovsky and Th. Smith, contrast with the nascent research on China's industrial past. The political and social landscapes of the time, including the reform movements and the role of the Chinese gentry, are rich areas of study, documented by scholars like M.E. Cameron and Chang Chung-li. The legacy of figures like K'ang Yo-wei and Sun Yat-sen, alongside contemporaries like Atatürk in Turkey, underscores the global nature of political thought during this period.|"['1.
