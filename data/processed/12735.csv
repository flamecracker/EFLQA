Presently, after signaling for quiet and moving ahead cautiously, Prescott led the way. He aimed to track where Ripley, Dodge, and their group were headed to prevent a sudden encounter. The rest of the team followed in a single file. Eventually, Dick paused, his friends gathering closely behind him.

Dick proposed a new way to determine the winning school in a swimming contest. He suggested that each school should enter seven swimmers, and the school with the swimmers finishing ahead of the other school's swimmers would win. This would prevent schools from entering one strong swimmer and six weaker ones to win easily. By having seven swimmers from each school, it would showcase the average abilities of the swimmers from both schools. Len suggested involving the editor of the local paper as the umpire to settle the dispute. Dick challenged Martin to a separate one-on-one race in addition to the team race to determine the fastest swimmer between them. The race was set for Friday, with the team race followed by the individual race. Spencer, a supporter of school sports, ensured that the event would be well attended by High School athletes.|"[""1.
