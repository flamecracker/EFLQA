"Dear Hubert, if I ever found a wishing-carpet lying around, I'd stand on it and say, ""Take me to Hubert, right away!"" Then we'd travel to magic lands we'd never see, choosing lovely gifts for you from me. But alas, no wishing-carpets come my way. So, I give you this book, yours and mine, along with hers, Margaret's. Anthea was pondering a disagreeable answer when she remembered the wet day and the boys' missed tram ride to London. So, she suggested using the eightpence saved for fireworks. Robert proposed testing the fireworks by sampling them. The children moved the table, revealing a hole in the carpet. Anthea covered it with a tray. Each child blindly chose a firework - Robert a cracker, Cyril and Anthea Roman candles, and Jane the prized Jack-in-the-box. Despite Jane's accidental selection, they abided by their rule to accept the outcome. Cyril reminded Jane that they must stand by the results, planning to enjoy the Jack-in-the-box last."|['1.

The crackers and Roman candles were lit, providing the expected entertainment. However, the Jack-in-the-box refused to ignite, despite numerous attempts with different methods. Anthea, resourceful, fetched a jar of paraffin from the cupboard. When poured over the tray, a sudden burst of flame startled the children, singeing their faces.

In a tale of magic and mischief, four siblings embarked on a mystical adventure. They believed in the power of ancient spells and decided to play at being Knights Templars.

The egg glowed red-hot, cracking open to reveal a flame-colored bird that grew larger before the children's eyes.

Once upon a time, the Phoenix shared its life-secret with a group of children. The Phoenix had lived for thousands of years in the wilderness, feeling weary of its existence until it met a prince and princess. The royal couple gifted the Phoenix a magic carpet, which the Phoenix used to lay its egg. The Phoenix asked the carpet to transport the egg to a place where it would hatch after two thousand years. The royal couple helped the Phoenix with its egg, and the Phoenix burned itself up, only to awake on an altar. The children were amazed by the Phoenix's story and admired its beautiful wings.

Robert and the girls were excited about the adventures they could have with a magic carpet and a Phoenix. The children had already witnessed the Phoenix hatch from an egg in their nursery fireplace and learned that their nursery carpet was a wishing carpet that could take them anywhere.

Jane suggested using the carpet to reach the top of the tower to prevent the natives from taking it. As the carpet descended, walls magically rose around them, trapping Robert in a window embrasure. He found himself in a precarious situation, with a narrow ledge separating him from the outside world. The carpet then shrank and stiffened, leaving them all standing on firm ground.

Robert urged the Phoenix to fetch food, while Anthea corrected him politely. The Phoenix returned with a basket of chestnuts, bread, and a juicy pear. After eating, the children discussed their predicament of being trapped in the tower. The Phoenix reassured them that it could help. It flew out to seek a solution.

Amid great excitement, the children saw the stone heap nearly vanished, revealing a dark archway leading to the unknown. All worries about finding their way home were forgotten in the thrill of the moment. Anthea urgently warned about bad air in closed places causing torches to go out, fearing fire-damp. The group fanned the archway to freshen the air before cautiously venturing in. Cyril led, lighting matches to reveal a stone vault with steps down. Jane hesitated, fearing snakes or lions, but the children descended the seventeen steps into branching passages. Cyril discovered a low arch, pulling out a canvas bag that seemed like a treasure.

On a pleasant Sunday at 18, Camden Terrace, Camden Town, the day began with a beautiful breakfast table adorned with flowers that Father brought home on Saturdays. In November, the chrysanthemums added a touch of yellow and copper to the setting. Sausages on toast were a delightful treat for breakfast, a welcome change from the usual eggs. The day continued with a special dinner of fowls and an angel pudding made with rice, milk, oranges, and white icing. After dinner, Father, who had been working hard all week, took care of the Lamb, who had a cough. The family gathered in the drawing-room, but their peace was interrupted by the cook, who wanted to leave. The reason? The children had dirtied the new carpet with mud from a foreign tower.

"""We're not taking him out,"" Anthea said, pausing as they had no intention of taking him out on Kentish Town Road. However, they did plan to take him elsewhere, just not where the cook thought.

The savage shouted, summoning more people. The children, realizing the danger, fled back through the forest. Anthea let Cyril pass with the Lamb, who joyfully urged them on.

Anthea sat up straight on the carpet, surrounded by copper-colored dancers adorned with parrot feathers in their hair. They performed a mesmerizing dance to the beat of small drums and strange songs, making the children feel like they were in a dream. The Phoenix refused to translate the request for the queen to join the natives in their huts. The cook, ready to embrace her royal destiny, bid farewell and disappeared into the forest with her dusky companions. The Phoenix revealed that the natives mistook the children for dreams, as foretold by prophecy. Anthea commanded the carpet to take her home, where they discovered the cook missing. Anthea felt guilty but decided to confide in her mother. The next day, Anthea used the magic carpet to transport herself to the sunny shore, where the Lamb's whooping cough was miraculously cured.|"['1.

The chef wore a white robe, no shoes or stockings, and a flower wreath on her hair. She sat under palm-leaves, fanned by boys with peacock feathers. She planned to clean her hut and teach the islanders to cook. Anthea felt guilty keeping the secret of the wishing carpet and the Phoenix from her mother. During home-lessons, Anthea decided to reveal the truth to her mother. The family took a carpet ride, but without the Phoenix. They couldn't go out after 6 pm, except on Saturdays. They sat on the carpet, thinking of a destination, and suddenly found themselves in a pine forest with their mother and the Lamb. Jane felt uneasy about her mother's distant behavior.|"['1.

Anthea and Jane couldn't resist kissing the adorable boy in his blue hat, his face dirty but endearing. The invisible children had to leap back to avoid being felt by Anthea, who was quick to sense their presence. Mother, carrying the Lamb, hurried away from the pinewood, but the children wanted to make sure she was safe before going home. They used a wishing carpet to transport to a gleaming white Indian town, where they met a ranee in a palace. The children declined to sell the carpet, opting to use the proceeds to help the poor. Anthea promised the queen a magic show, where they and the items in the palace would disappear like smoke. After washing up, they bid farewell, and suddenly, the story ended as the gas lights came on in the schoolroom, signaling the end of their magical adventure.|"['1.

The smart rug had delivered the kids into a dim area where two stalls met. The ground was covered with string and brown paper, and baskets and boxes were piled against the wall. The kids sneaked out from under a stall draped with table covers and mats, beautifully embroidered by ladies with idle hands. They emerged near a sideboard-cloth decorated with a pattern of blue geraniums. The girls and Cyril slipped out unnoticed, but Robert, as he cautiously emerged, was stepped on by Mrs Biddle, who managed the stall. A crowd quickly gathered as Robert let out a yell. Mrs Biddle was angry upon realizing she had hurt him accidentally. The children hesitated to explain that the treasures on the rug were their mother's contributions to the bazaar. Mrs Biddle claimed the items as hers, but a note revealed the truth, leading to the treasures being sold by Miss Peasmarsh for a good sum. Anthea and Jane offered to help sell the items to make up for their brother's accident.|"['**1.

It took some time to set up the stall with the Indian bazaar items. The dark colors of the carpet made the brass, silver, and ivory pieces stand out. After selling everything, the children enjoyed fishing, diving into a bran-pie, and listening to music. The curate surprised them with a lovely tea. Although the children felt wretched about the carpet being sold, they maintained their manners and thanked everyone. Despite feeling sad, they stayed to watch over the carpet until Mrs. Biddle took it away. The children were tired and waited under a gas lamp until Mrs. Biddle left. They saw her examining the carpet in her dining room through the window.|"[""1.

Anthea led the way into the room, followed by the others. Mrs. Biddle, unaware of their presence, was busy smoothing the carpet with the boot that had previously hurt Robert. Cyril quickly shut the door before she noticed them. Startled, Mrs. Biddle's face turned a deep violet as she scolded them for daring to visit at night. Yet, her tone softened as she offered cake and apologized for stepping on Robert's hand. Surprisingly, Mrs. Biddle's demeanor changed for the better after that incident. She even sent a silver tea-pot and a kind note to Miss Peasmarsh when she married the curate. The Phoenix advised giving the carpet a break to avoid losing the use of their legs.

"""The Phoenix and the Children"" 

The Phoenix, a majestic bird, shared wisdom with the children. It revealed how it gathered knowledge from a carpet and deciphered inscriptions on a papyrus. Together, they embarked on a journey to the Phoenix's temple. Riding a tram, they faced challenges from locals but managed to outsmart some troublesome boys who tried to steal the Phoenix. Despite the chaos, the Phoenix remained calm and dignified. The children, feeling lucky, learned valuable lessons about courage, wit, and the importance of staying composed in difficult situations.

"The majestic bird spoke, ""I am the Phoenix, Head of your House, here to receive your homage. I am no ordinary bird but the one and only Phoenix."" The children, perplexed, were led by the bird to the temple to find the High Priest. Inside the grand hall with Doulton tiles, they encountered clerks and mahogany desks. An attentive clerk approached, sending for Mr. Asterisk. A friendly gentleman with a beard then appeared, understanding their unusual situation. He guided them upstairs, where a beautiful image of the Phoenix adorned the staircase. Cyril explained the secret the children carried, revealing the Phoenix hidden within Robert's Norfolk jacket.

In the absence of our manager, the gentleman began, as if speaking to a valued customer. He seemed disoriented by the warm weather and mentioned feeling off. The gentleman admitted to momentarily believing the remarkable bird was the Phoenix and was amazed when others in the office also believed. They decided to hold a ceremony in the board-room to honor the Phoenix's visit. The children were surprised that everyone believed in the Phoenix, even the cleverest men in the office.

Our esteemed Phoenix, the leader of this old House, has finally graced us with their presence. We greatly appreciate this honor and enthusiastically welcome their long-awaited arrival. The Phoenix spoke about the benefits of our fire insurance system and expressed gratitude for the warm reception. The Phoenix requested a recitation or song to mark the occasion. The children observed the scene nervously as the Phoenix made its requests. The Phoenix acknowledged the kindness shown and bid farewell, thanking everyone for a pleasant time. The Phoenix then left with the children, followed by the office staff returning to their duties. The boardroom remained in disarray, indicating that the Phoenix's visit was real. The children discussed their upcoming Christmas plans and expressed a desire for normalcy without any extraordinary events. Jane and Anthea shared feelings of wanting to be honest with their mother. Cyril pondered ways to convince their mother of the magical experiences they had.|"['1.

Cyril mentioned that their actions could be seen as those of a hardened criminal, but Robert reminded them not to be ungrateful and waste the day dwelling on secrets. Anthea suggested using the magic carpet for a good deed. They envisioned scenarios of witnessing a will signing or aiding in a war. The children, along with the Phoenix, set out to do a kind action. Cyril found matches, and they lit candles to explore further. They hoped to find a prisoner to free or the bones of a prisoner to bury.

Anthea suggested leaving to discuss their situation on the way. They attempted to enter the topless tower but found a large stone blocking their path. Cyril used his father's oil can to oil the bolt holding the stone. After multiple attempts, they finally managed to move the stone with a joint effort. The children emerged into a dusty shrine by the road leading to the tower. The shrine was neglected but provided a place for travelers to rest and reflect on being good. They cleaned up at a nearby spring, feeling refreshed despite using small handkerchiefs. Anthea felt inspired to do something kind after seeing the shrine dedicated to St Jean de Luz.|"['1.

The children approached a quaint white house with green shutters and a slate roof. The garden path was adorned with stone vases, now holding only dried flowers. A vine-covered veranda led to the narrow green door, where a rusty bell awaited a pull. Inside, a tall lady with pale ringlets greeted them warmly, despite her tear-stained eyes. The hall had red and white tiles, and the sitting room sparkled with silver candlesticks and polished furniture. A little French boy in black velvet admired a tiny Christmas tree adorned with tinsel and candles.

"The lady, Manon, shared a tale of hidden treasure with the children. Robert explained how they discovered the gold and offered to help retrieve it. The group, including a priest, ventured to a wayside shrine where the treasure lay. With excitement, they unearthed the golden riches.

Robert suggested calling a four-wheeled cab for Aunt Emma, confident she'd be at the theatre. Anthea, cautious about the gold coin's worth for the cab fare, instructed the cabman to drive carefully. Upon arrival, they found the house locked. Cyril, fearing being mistaken for burglars, rang the bell repeatedly, but no answer came.

The kids sneaked to the pantry window, next to the house with a green gate labeled 'Tradesmen's Entrance', always locked. They managed to climb over by stepping on the fence and gate handle. Once inside, they lit all the gas-jets in fear of burglars. The children explored the empty house with the Phoenix, a magical bird, and even made friends with the blackbeetles in the cupboards. Anthea then showed how to light a fire from scratch, starting with cleaning out the old ashes, placing cinders, newspaper balls, wood sticks, and coal in the grate. Despite some minor mishaps like a bleeding knuckle and a cut finger, the fire was successfully lit, and Anthea washed up after. Remember, this method works well in London, but lighting fires in the countryside is done differently and more beautifully.|['1.

Anthea was warming the little blackbeetles by the fire while Jane set the table for a meal resembling tea. The kettle whistled on the fire, inviting everyone for tea, but there was no milk. Instead, they had tea with six sugar cubes each. The food was better than usual, with cold tongue, bread, butter, cheese, and a bit of pudding. They even found a Christmas cake, strawberry jam, and candied fruits. The Phoenix listened to their adventures and mentioned that their helpers wouldn't return that night. The children decided not to wash up for them and planned to go on an adventure using the magic carpet. The Phoenix offered to fetch them entertainment while they cleaned up, suggesting various items like musical instruments and books. Eventually, the Phoenix proposed going back to its birthplace to bring back beautiful treasures. Robert was intrigued but realized they needed someone on the carpet to make wishes.|"['1.

The carpet in the kitchen vanished suddenly, leaving behind a horde of hungry Persian cats. The children and a mystical Phoenix found themselves surrounded by 199 meowing felines. The room turned chaotic, with the cats demanding food in a deafening chorus. To quell the uproar, the Phoenix suggested sending the carpet for provisions. Just in time, the carpet reappeared, now covered in rats. The cats fell silent as they turned their attention to the rats. The children, in a panic, summoned a policeman to help manage the bizarre situation.

The policeman arrived, demanding an explanation for the commotion. Despite the children's attempts to clarify, the noise from the cats and rats made it impossible for him to understand. The policeman remained unmoved, determined to investigate further. However, a scream from outside diverted his attention, allowing the clever Phoenix to escape. The Phoenix revealed that the policeman didn't know their location, bringing relief to the children. As the Phoenix retired for the night, the children pondered the musky smell left behind.

Anthea, feeling tired and anxious, debated with the others about the meaning of foreign words like Persian for milk. They were surrounded by mewing cats until a magical carpet appeared, revealing a cow instead of milk containers. The children, in a heroic attempt, tried to milk the cow but found it challenging. Anthea, seeking to soothe the cow, failed in her attempt and the cow trampled the saucer. Overwhelmed, Jane suggested leaving the cats and cow alone. The children gathered in the drawing-room, noticing the neglect in the absence of their mother. Anthea comforted Jane with a blanket, while Robert and Cyril fought for the fur hearthrug.|"['1.

Cyril suggested putting the animals in baskets on doorsteps, but Anthea pointed out the challenges, especially with the cow. Robert dismissed the cow's issue, claiming it could stay the night. The siblings decided to wrap the cats in dusters and pillowcases for the night. Exhausted, Jane and Anthea snuggled under a blanket on the sofa. Suddenly, Jane awoke to find a burglar in the house. Remembering stories where burglars were kind to children, Jane approached the burglar calmly. The burglar entered the nursery, prompting Jane to follow cautiously.

Cyril whispered about the large consignment they had received, which was more than they wanted and a hassle. He suggested using a barrow and some sacks or baskets to help transport the items. The burglar, moved by their situation, offered to lend a hand and brought along a friend who was knowledgeable about cats. They decided to take the Persian cats away in sacks on the barrow.

Anthea suggested getting a nice gift for their mother, but worried about where they could find it. She thought of a scenario where they discovered a purse with foreign coins and intricate designs, making it impossible to spend. Anthea's sisterly concern led her to mend a hole in the carpet, despite the mishap caused by the magic carpet. The siblings accidentally landed on a rooftop and had to find a way back home. Cyril reassured that they would be fine, and they could use the carpet to return. The Phoenix, their magical companion, discreetly hid itself as Uncle Reginald approached, expressing regret for not being able to join them due to his work as a solicitor.|"['1.

With a cheerful wave, the uncle left, leaving Cyril and Anthea exchanging glances over a shiny golden sovereign. Anthea quickly sewed the torn edges, and Cyril bought marble-patterned oil-cloth to line the carpet, making the nursery feel empty without the others. The Phoenix grew restless, wanting to know what happened to Jane and Robert. They found a trap-door on the roof, leading to a fat lady sitting among clothes, screaming. She called for Septimus, then returned with a prim lady. The children hid as the ladies searched for them. The room was calm, with books and slippers. They noticed an empty missionary-box.|['1.

The Reverend Septimus pondered over the unusual dream, suggesting it might be a glimpse into another life where madness could take hold. Robert, however, feared being trapped in the dream-asylum forever if they were sent there. Just as despair loomed, the children vanished, leaving the Reverend with his aunts.

"At breakfast, the Lamb made a messy moment by spilling jam on himself. Cleaning up the sticky mess diverted attention from the carpet. Mother, skilled but puzzled by the cook's accounts, managed the situation. The Lamb then played with siblings in energetic games like 'Whirling Worlds' and 'Climbing Vesuvius'.
