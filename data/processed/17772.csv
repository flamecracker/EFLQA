That year, spring arrived early. In February, despite the lingering snow, the air grew warmer. By the end of the month, a true spring day emerged, melting away all the snow. After being cooped up indoors due to the weather and a cold, it was a delight to step outside. Despite having limited entertainment, she enjoyed running along the gravel paths, dreaming of gardening. She hoped the gardener might grant her a plot large enough to grow mustard-and-cress in the shape of a capital I. Positioned in the kitchen garden, Ida gazed through a thin hedge, catching glimpses of the high road, a horse watering trough, and a distant wood. The melting snow created a watery landscape, with moss appearing dry but actually damp. The bubbling water declared the arrival of spring, echoed by the joyful songs of birds in the woods.

The children emerged from the woods, their voices filled with chatter and laughter, except for one child who lingered, singing a song about eternal life. Ida, distracted by the children collecting woodland treasures, noticed they had primroses in their hands. An idea sparked in her mind - flowers for Mrs. Overtheway. Ignoring the rules, Ida crossed the hedge, leaving part of her dress behind. She ventured into the woods, following the trail of plucked primroses. As she reached a brook with primroses on the other side, she faced a dilemma. Remembering fairy tales, she spotted a moss-covered stone in the stream that could help her cross.

Ida had a plan to create a ford across the stream by piling stones together. As she worked, a cloud covered the sun, making it chilly. She was a bit scared of the creatures under the stones but continued. After finishing the ford, Ida tried to cross but fell when the stone she stepped on shifted. She got back to the bank, picked primroses, and headed home. At Mrs. Overtheway's gate, Ida realized she didn't know her name. She gave the flowers to the housekeeper, explaining they were for Mrs. Overtheway. Back home, Nurse scolded Ida for her adventures. Ida, feeling guilty, confessed her actions.

The bells chimed the next morning, and Mrs. Overtheway came out with primroses. She hoped someone would see her, but no one did. Ida was sick, not sure how or for how long. She dreamt of wandering lost in the woods and facing strange creatures. Waking up to church bells, she found Nurse by her side. Recovering from illness was tough. Ida yearned to be outside, watching the sun set, longing for the freedom of the open air. Feeling lonely and neglected, she wished for someone to tell her a story.

Nurse brought up tea, and Ida was thrilled to see her fancies come true. The tea was served without any bread and treacle, making it a grand affair. However, the enjoyment of tea and buttered toast has its limits. After the tray was taken away, Ida settled in an easy chair by the fire with Mrs. Overtheway. Mrs. Overtheway expressed her concern for Ida's illness and offered to tell her a story to lift her spirits. Mrs. Overtheway reminisced about a childhood memory that left a lasting dislike for a certain shade of brown satin. Despite doubting the amusement value, Ida eagerly settled in to listen, along with the attentive hyacinth.

Fifty years ago, I cherished the companionship of Sarah, the housemaid, whose love for friendly gossip matched my passion for romantic discovery. We both found solace in exploring deserted gardens and uninhabited houses, delving into the mysteries of the past. The allure of abandoned places, like the manor with its hidden stories and forgotten relics, captivated my imagination. Peering through gates, glimpsing marble halls, and discovering rusty scissors, each artifact held a tale waiting to be unraveled. Despite the fever that kept me away from home, my time at my grandmother's was filled with wonder and adventure, except for the vexation of lying awake in the nursery turned workroom, overhearing the maids' lively chatter behind the red silk screen. The tantalizing snippets of their conversations teased my excitable mind, leaving me restless yet fascinated in the dim glow of the candlelight.|"['1.

My grandmother sighed softly as she reminisced about the past, hinting at the arrival of a wealthy Indian merchant, Mrs. Moss, who had faced immense tragedy. I longed to hear more about this mysterious woman but was interrupted by my uncle calling from below. As my aunt hurried off, I contemplated sharing my wakefulness with my grandmother, eager for more tales of Mrs. Moss.

Money is a valuable thing, especially when you can spend it on things you love. I thought about all the golden coins I had and what I could buy with them. But then, I made a personal list from my mother to my yellow cat, Sandy Tom. I realized that Sandy Tom was priceless to me, even more than all the toys money could buy. I imagined having a carriage drawn by mastiffs and a fairy purse that never empties, yet nothing compared to the love I had for Sandy Tom. I cherished his soft head, tender eyes, and melodious purr. Despite the tempting toys, Sandy Tom was irreplaceable. As I lay down, I pondered about my appearance, hoping to grow up beautiful like Mrs. Moss. Examining myself from head to toe, I reflected on my hair, eyes, and nose, wondering about their features and if I would ever look as elegant as Mrs. Moss.|"[""1.

In front of the warm fire sat an old-fashioned chair with a high back and a frilly cover. Next to it, a footstool was placed where the grandmother had been seated. The child, in a silly attempt, placed the footstool on the chair to see their reflection in the mirror. The child's memory of this moment remained vivid even after many years. Despite the dim firelight, the child could make out their tired eyes and tousled hair. The child's attempt to view their profile using the reflection of Mr. Joseph's portrait hanging on the nursery wall led to a comical accident where the chair toppled over, but thankfully no one was hurt. The child's reflection remained a mystery due to the dusty mirror and uncooperative Mr. Joseph.|"['1.

Aunt Harriet got up and picked up Mr. Joseph, trying to hide her laughter. I avoided the chair and mirror, leaving Mr. Joseph untouched. I stopped worrying about my nose. Instead, I focused on Mrs. Moss, sketching her endlessly. I used my uncle's paint-box to paint portraits of her, but they never felt right. I longed to visit Mrs. Moss with my grandmother and aunt. One day, I overheard my family planning to visit Mrs. Moss without me. Disappointed, I was told I couldn't go because Mrs. Moss was old.

As we grow older, our admiration for others can become mixed with selfish thoughts. A few years later, when meeting someone we've admired, we might worry more about how we look than about the person we're meeting. But when I was younger and eager to see Mrs. Moss, my focus was solely on her. I hurried to get ready, grabbed a special pincushion as a gift, and rushed to meet her. Despite my excitement, as we drove to her house, I couldn't shake some doubts. Would Mrs. Moss meet my expectations? I imagined the grand entrance, her beauty, and the anticipation of our meeting. However, upon arrival, reality didn't match my daydreams. The hall was no longer empty but filled with luxury that made me feel insignificant. The footman's presence disrupted my idealized image, and as I finally faced Mrs. Moss, my fantasy began to crumble.|"[""1.

I faced a tall, elderly lady with hunched shoulders, a hooked nose, and black eyes that glowed in their deep sockets. She sported a beard on her chin and wore a dress of _feuille-morte_ satin with a black lace shawl. Her cap sat askew over her brown hair. This was Mrs. Moss, the widow of Mr. Moss, who had passed away long ago. She was not the vision I had imagined. Mrs. Moss lacked the grace and intelligence that my grandmother possessed. While my grandmother had a gentle smile and bright eyes that hinted at a rich inner life, Mrs. Moss seemed devoid of any depth or beauty. Despite the disappointment, I observed their meeting with curiosity. Mrs. Moss's gruff voice hinted at her habit of snuff-taking, a detail that explained her rough tone.|"['1.

Aunt Harriet and Mrs. Moss had a formal meeting where Aunt Harriet was introduced as Mrs. Moss's daughter. Aunt Harriet played the role of a child, sitting quietly while I, introduced as a grandchild, tried to blend in behind her chair. The room was full of interesting items like Indian screens, japanned boxes, and cabinets with glass shelves displaying various trinkets. The highlight of the room was the three fat pug dogs that I found endearing. Despite my initial disappointment with Mrs. Moss's appearance, I eventually warmed up to her, especially after she showed kindness towards me. Mrs. Metcalfe, Mrs. Moss's companion, was particular about being addressed with the title of respect she felt she deserved. Our friendship hit a bump when I mistakenly called her 'Miss Metcalfe,' but we eventually resolved the misunderstanding.|"['1.

The lady was humble in every way except in her knowledge of horticulture, which she shared with the narrator. The old lady vanished, leaving a sweet scent behind. Ida awoke to find herself in Nurse's arms. The lady had been downstairs telling Nurse how peacefully Ida slept. Ida eagerly awaited the old lady's return the next evening. Nurse exaggerated the time the lady had been gone and made up conditions for Ida to behave to earn another visit. Ida spoke of pugs and curl-papers, annoying Nurse, who was skilled at changing the subject. Ida had to endure the discomfort of curl-papers to achieve ringlets like other girls, despite the dampness or a good romp ruining her hair.|"['1.

One day, Ida expressed her gratitude for not having a red screen on her bed, recalling a conversation with Nurse about being thankful for what one has. The next morning, she eagerly awaited the appearance of Mrs. Overtheway, waving at her with joy. During tea time, Mrs. Overtheway shared stories, and Ida apologized for falling asleep during one of them. Eager for more stories, Ida expressed her interest in hearing a ghost story, intrigued by the idea. Mrs. Overtheway reminisced about her first independent visit with her sister Fatima, sharing stories of their father's diverse interests that influenced their household.

Birthdays hold different significance at various stages of life. While they are highly anticipated in youth, they may seem less important as one grows older and nears the end of life's journey. Certain birthdays stand out more than others. For instance, turning ten or thirteen may bring feelings of pride and advancement. The transition to being a teenager can feel like a significant milestone, bringing new privileges like reading more mature books and staying up later. Each birthday may not always bring drastic changes, but they can still be special occasions with lovely gifts and celebrations.

We found my mother sewing with an open letter by her side. Written on a large sheet, the letter mentioned a friend named Mary who had moved nearby. My mother shared that Mary wanted her two girls, around thirteen years old, to visit. Excited, I mentioned being thirteen now. The next day, my mother, Fatima, and I sat by the window. My mother knitted, giving us advice about our upcoming visit. She warned us about neglecting good habits while away and becoming critical of others.

My mother, in her wisdom, prepared my sister and me for our first venture into society. We discussed the importance of maintaining good habits and certain Sunday customs, as we were going to be away for a week. After a discussion, my mother agreed to let us take a valuable book with us, teaching us to care for such items. We spent the evening finalizing our plans and did not talk much more. We then prepared for the journey, drawing up lists of good habits in red ink, but unfortunately spilling it, setting a messy tone for our preparations. We packed a big box lent by my father, struggling with awkwardly sized books and using folded stockings to fill up the trunk.

We entered the drawing-room where the lady of the house sat at a delicate writing-table, engrossed in a letter. She was shortsighted, like most others in the room, who were focused on intricate needlework. Our hostess greeted us kindly, inquired about our journey, then returned to her letter. As we observed the room, we noticed several young ladies engaged in needlework and a dark-eyed Irish gentleman making paper pellets while chatting with a red-haired lady. The atmosphere shifted when the hostess seemed agitated, and the Irishman's playful demeanor changed. The red-haired lady then whisked us away to the yellow room, where our box awaited, but the key was forgotten. Despite our distress, the gentleman cheerfully resolved the situation, revealing his carefree nature. As he left, his whistling echoed through the halls, leaving behind a sense of lightheartedness.|"['1.

I won't go into great detail about unpacking, dear Ida, but it was enjoyable and quicker than packing. We loved the spacious drawers and cupboards, following our mother's advice to unpack everything at once. We even unpacked a book I meant to study but never did. We shared shelves and pegs equally and found a use for the fancy watch-pockets above our pillows. Bedford offered to help, providing meals, comfort, and anecdotes. Miss Lucy, a sharp young lady, hosted us in the schoolroom, where she talked about a recent wedding and her dresses. She was warm and chatty with us but distant in the company of older guests. We felt a bit ignored but kept busy with a scrapbook while she mingled with the adults. Her conversation was a mix of various topics revolving around a recent wedding.|['1.

Cecilia and the major were in Bath, and their letters were read aloud at breakfast. The ladies were deeply interested in Cecilia's letters about fashions, drives, and the pump-room, even though they had no connection to the people and places mentioned. When a familiar name was recognized, it was like finding a treasure. Miss Lucy followed the letters closely, remembering details despite never having been to Bath or knowing the people mentioned. Remembering family connections and past events was seen as a useful skill, demanding attention and time. Later, in a private moment with their hostess, the girls listened attentively as she shared stories about Cecilia and the major, military exploits, and family history.

Miss Lucy shared tales of school drama, where two sisters despised each other but had to dress alike. The younger sister wished for the elder to marry, and now they both fancy the same man, the curate at their church. Miss Lucy pondered how gentlemen propose, finding it awkward. She mentioned her cousin's romantic elopement to Gretna Green with a handsome officer, leading to quarrels and his departure. Miss Lucy's frivolous talk on serious matters showed her lack of understanding. She chattered about family trees, boasting of royal descent from King Stephen.

Sunday was a day of mixed experiences for us. Miss Lucy, dressed in her best clothes, was overly patronizing, and a general stiffness filled the air, even affecting the ladies' silk dresses. After a leisurely breakfast, we hurried to get ready for church. Miss Lucy lost her Prayer Book, causing a delay. Finally, we all squeezed into the carriages and rushed to the quaint church. Unfortunately, we were late, missing the bells. Inside, the congregation's behavior varied. Some knelt during prayers, while others sat. The red-haired young lady knelt, and we followed suit. Responses were diverse, with one man standing and responding loudly. During the sermon, our hostess drew the curtains around our pew. I noticed an old gentleman facing the pulpit with intense focus. Later, I saw the red-haired young lady and an Irishman leaving for church together, leaving me puzzled about their interaction.|"[""1.

I recall that stroll vividly, Ida! It was a warm, delightful summer afternoon—the dusty plants along the path, the clematis in the hedges (I tucked a piece into my Prayer Book, where it stayed for years)—the grasshoppers and flies our dresses picked up from the tall grass, only to reappear as we sat through the sermon. The elderly gentleman was in his pew, his gaze almost kindly, as we took our seats in due time. We enthusiastically followed his lead in the responses; even the Irishman rejected compromises. During prayers, if he glanced over at our pew (which he could hardly avoid), he must have noticed our unity. A hymn followed the sermon, a tradition of the church to conclude Evening Prayer. It was Bishop Ken's evening hymn, well-known to all. The highlight was the Irishman's unexpected singing voice, clear and moving, distinct from the schoolchildren's and the fiddle's sounds. Despite the less satisfying evening that followed, the hymn sung by the Irishman remained a memorable moment from that day.|"['1.

Dear Ida, it's vital for young ladies like you, at the age of thirteen, to not disregard the importance of dressing nicely and having good manners. It's also crucial to learn from older friends about these things. However, some people place excessive value on appearances and wealth, making you feel inadequate if you don't meet their standards.

Miss Lucy began a chilling tale from years ago about an old man named Mr. Bartlett and his daughter who fell in love with a man of inferior family. The daughter's father threatened to disinherit her if she married him. The man, driven by greed, murdered Mr. Bartlett but couldn't escape the haunting presence of the old man's ghost. Despite trying to rid himself of the ghost, the man and his wife met tragic ends, and the property passed to a cousin. The story lingered in the minds of the listeners until they were distracted by the arrival of unexpected guests, Cecilia and the major.

Fatima was unable to speak any longer. In the moonlight filtering through the blinds, I hurriedly got up, assisting her out of bed and across the room. The hardest part was opening the door at such a moment. We fumbled our way down the passage, feeling for the door handles. As we entered the room, bathed in moonlight, we saw a chair draped in white, a muslin dress, black satin shoes, and delicate ornaments. In the bed lay our friend Kate, fast asleep, her red hair cascading over the pillow. I climbed up and gently woke her, explaining our predicament. Kate, sympathetic but sleepy, allowed us to join her in bed. Despite the earlier ghostly fright, we found comfort and soon fell asleep, holding onto her hair for reassurance.

After breakfast in the drawing-room, Pat joked about pawning family ghosts, intriguing us with tales. He mentioned a ghostly snore from the night before. Enticed by a mysterious clue, we followed him outside where he revealed the source of the noise - barn owls nesting in the spout. Initially frightened, Fatima clung to me, hesitant to explore. Pat's playful demeanor eventually reassured her. With a long pole, he coaxed out a shy owl, dispelling our fears. Later, Ida, now recovering, ventured out for a walk with Nurse, enjoying the fresh air despite the unfamiliar street. Transitioning from indoors to outdoors felt like a delicate process, akin to a moth emerging from its cocoon. Eventually, Ida gained confidence and was permitted a solo run in the garden one afternoon.|"['1.

Ida, a young girl, unable to run due to illness, found solace in the touch of fresh flowers. Her uncle's formal evening summons filled her with nervousness and disappointment. Alone with him, his stern gaze made her uncomfortable. Attempting to engage in polite conversation, she mentioned the budding hedge. However, her uncle's piercing eyes intensified her unease until she burst into tears. Overwhelmed, her uncle sent her away with kind words and treats. Despite her efforts to be good, his scrutiny left her in tears.

Tea was prepared quickly and laid out on a small table. The white cloth appeared exceptionally clean to Ida, the silver and glass sparkled, the china was adorned with a delicate rosebud design, and a reading lamp cast a gentle glow over everything. The spread included top-quality tea, cream, brown bread with butter, fresh eggs, and honey. Even the maid was attractive, with a warm smile reminiscent of the old lady's.

"Ida quietly approached the elderly woman and gently caressed the slipper resting on the hearth. As the wind howled outside, she settled near the fire, eager to hear the tale.

As I grew older, the fanciful ideas I had about my father faded, but my unique fondness for him only grew. Our bond deepened as we shared harmonious tastes and understood each other well. Unlike Fatima, who sometimes struggled to connect with him, I found comfort in his refined manners and considerate nature. My father believed in practicing good manners at home, a principle he often emphasized. He encouraged us to treat our family members with the utmost courtesy and respect, setting a high standard for our behavior. When we embarked on a journey to find a new home, I experienced the excitement of staying at an inn for the first time. The novelty of the experience, from the quaint room to the view of the sparkling river, filled me with wonder. Despite the simplicity of the inn, every detail felt enchanting and new. The joy of exploring this unfamiliar setting, from the dining room to the town, left a lasting impression on me. Even the modest bookshelf in the inn's parlour became a source of fascination, offering me a glimpse into a world of stories and adventures. In an era where illustrated storybooks were a rarity, the simple engravings in the book I chose captivated me, blending entertainment with valuable lessons. The experience of that day, filled with new discoveries and moments of rest, left me with cherished memories and a deep appreciation for the simple joys of life.|"['1.

Pictures of anglers in traditional hats, fishing under trees, or bringing their catch to a cozy inn with a fish sign were enchanting. Small wood-cuts of fish and country scenes, often with a river, filled the pages. The desire for a riverside home grew, imagining cooking fish for loved ones. In a small town, news spread fast. The landlord suggested older riverside homes, sparking hope. On a delightful evening, a stroll led to charming houses with gardens. A lady tending flowers caught their eye, joined by a man with a green shade.

Mary, my father and I were drawn to Reka Dom for various reasons. The garden, with its three lush lawns divided by sweet-smelling hedges, felt like a magical realm. The swing between the elm trees on the second lawn delighted me until it broke, but that didn't stop me from exploring further. The discovery of a children's garden with letter-shaped flower beds, including an 'M,' felt like a gift. The presence of two tea-chests and a barrel added to the charm. My father, a lover of languages, was intrigued by the Russian name of the house and the traces of a foreign language. He also appreciated the spacious grounds where he could wander undisturbed. The old housekeeper shared stories of the former English tenants with a Russian connection, adding to the mystique of Reka Dom.|"[""1.

Even though I didn't deserve credit, I was praised for the good news. I narrated the story skillfully, making the six gardens the highlight. My siblings cheered, and our little sister, Phil, hugged our mother in excitement. Despite warnings that we'd tire of Reka Dom, we found love and joy in that place.

We learned the names of the little Russians and matched them to their respective garden beds. Each of us mimicked the habits of the Russian we succeeded. We played partisan games, pretending to be Scottish chieftains or English barons in our gardens. Our pets joined as retainers, with dogs barking energetically and a tortoise unmoving. I discovered Ivan enjoyed boating and reading. I found delight in books, particularly 'The Complete Angler,' which fueled my love for nature. My interest in languages led me to study Russian, starting with the alphabet. I practiced diligently, impressed with my progress in mastering the characters.

I took the thick grammar book again, even though my father warned me it was too hard. I wanted to learn the language of the little Russians. But elders' warnings often come true. After struggling a bit, I gave up and turned to easier hobbies. I was always inventive and usually led our games. I know I could be annoying and bossy, but I hoped my efforts for my siblings balanced it out. One troublesome idea I had was creating a post office for letters to the little Russians, which I pretended to answer. We all enjoyed it, and they believed the replies were real. But when it became too much, I stopped replying to myself, and the others wondered why. We speculated, and little Phillis suggested Ivan might be dead.

The small town we now called home had a special charm for us. It was where the Misses Brooke, our dear old friends, settled after their brother passed away. I cherished these kind ladies, just as I did when I was young. Their homemade treats and cherished albums made our evenings delightful. Despite their virtues, a tendency to doubt and plot sometimes strained our bond. As we reunited years later, their suspicions grew, especially about my enjoyment of their company as a young lady.

The prolonged anxiety from a misunderstanding had left me on the verge of hysteria. I vividly recall lying on the horsehair sofa in the dining room, tearfully murmuring, 'You shouldn't, you know. You shouldn't!' while the two sisters comforted me and blamed themselves. The incident ended with kisses and tea, bringing peace for a while. The Misses Brooke, known for their humble apologies, invited me to tea at Belle Vue Cottage, urging me to decline if I felt unwilling. The sisters hoped my father would accompany me.

Fatima didn't like the Misses Brooke as much as I did. She found it tiresome to maintain close relationships with the old ladies, who were touchy.

But they treat their friends like we used to care for our flowers at Reka Dom! They are always checking up on them, and I prefer peace.' Despite feeling hurt and gloomy, Fatima comforted me. She reminded me that good people have flaws too. 'Let's be understanding,' she said. 'They care for you. Let's not dwell on it. Come upstairs, forget it, and let's discuss my new ideas.'|"['1.

We had many houses, but that one was our favorite, cherished by my dad and all of us. The song's refrain brought back memories of past joys. I comforted Miss Martha and thought of Reka Dom. The river flowed in tune with the music. I swayed under the elm trees with Walton and Cotton. I wandered through the lawns and gardens. The song led us to chat about London. The merchant and I conversed effortlessly. He grasped my thoughts with few words. I envied those with one home. My father loved the place early on. The foreign name attracted him. I shared the history of Reka Dom with the merchant. It was delightful to talk beyond small talk. I felt uneasy about speaking so much to a stranger.

We chatted about our friend, his homes, and then turned to discussing ourselves. I blushed as Mr. Ward, the curate, engaged in polite conversation. My mind raced, recalling our shared memories of Home and Ivan. I worried he might think I knew his identity. The evening ended, and as I prepared to leave, the merchant offered help, which I declined. He lingered, his eyes betraying distress. He shared that our hosts had not mentioned us to Ivan, despite knowing us all as tenants of Reka Dom. They called him John, not Ivan, to prevent affectation. John shared stories of his troubled past, and Mr. Smith believed his reformation was due to his family's unwavering support.

It is a special privilege to share surprising news, but it's wise not to rush. I slowly revealed to Mr. Smith that my hopes were dashed. As I managed the household in my mother's absence, I dreaded his return. Despite my hopes that he might have left quietly, he stayed. My father, fond of him, was pleased by his visits, unlike the Misses Brooke. They had hoped for a romance between us, but Mr. Smith's prolonged stay upset their plans. Miss Martha, suspecting ulterior motives, disapproved of his frequent visits. She felt it was improper for me to accept his attentions. Frustrated by their interference, I distanced myself from Bellevue Cottage, wishing for peace. Reflecting on the past, I pondered the man before me and the boy I once knew.

When I left the house, the merchant stood up too, causing me distress. Despite looking guilty, he explained he wanted to talk. Days after, my life was uneasy. Ivan's persistence led to tears, and my father was surprised and upset by my refusal. He couldn't fathom why the merchant proposed or why I declined. My mother's absence made matters worse. The Misses Brooke's interference added to the chaos. However, under my mother's guidance, I faced Ivan again.
