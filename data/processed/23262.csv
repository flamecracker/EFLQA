Sam named his dog Titian as a tribute to a great painter, but often shortened it to Tit or Tittles. Tittles was covered in shaggy light grey hair, with only his nose and tail visible. During a fierce storm near the coast of Norway, the men struggled to keep the schooner afloat. As the sky darkened and the sea churned, the Captain steered towards the islands. Despite the menacing waves, the schooner navigated through narrow channels between the rocks.

A sense of relief washed over everyone on the ship as they sailed through calm waters after a tumultuous storm. Sam Sorrel, feeling less queasy, even had his spirits lifted. Tittles, the dog, wagged his tail happily. The tranquility that followed the storm was a common occurrence. The storm subsided as the _Snowflake_ reached the islands, leaving a peaceful atmosphere. The night and the next day were quiet, with the ship resting among the islands. Most were asleep, except the helmsman and Captain McNab. The sun still lingered in the sky due to the ship's northern latitude. Amidst the calm twilight, only the faint sounds of the ship and seabirds were heard. However, a new sound broke the silence - Sam's loud snoring. A mishap with a tin can of water disrupted his sleep, prompting him to head out with his sketchbook and a gun, ready for an unexpected encounter with a majestic eagle on a nearby island.|"['1.

The city of Bergen, a historic place, was once a Viking stronghold. These fierce warriors, known for their sea exploits, had a bold spirit that led them to explore far and wide. They were daring colonizers, settling in various lands, including parts of Great Britain. Bergen, nestled at the base of steep mountains, seems to be squeezed between the mountains and the sea. The houses, painted white with red-tiled roofs, appear to jostle for space, some even perched precariously on the mountainside. Near the sea, houses stand on piles, resembling creatures peering into the water.

"When Temple, Sorrel, and Grant arrived in Bergen, the time was well past midnight. Despite their hunger and exhaustion, the awe-inspiring scenery had captivated them, causing them to skip supper and resist sleep. Landing in the historic city of Old Norway, one might expect thoughts of grand adventures and Viking heritage to fill their minds. However, their immediate concerns were more primal - food and rest. Madame Sontoom, the kind-hearted owner of a unique private hotel, welcomed them warmly. Unlike traditional hotels, her establishment felt more like a home, with her daughters treating guests like friends rather than customers. Temple's prior study of the Norse language aided in communication, while Grant struggled and Sorrel relied on a few phrases to get by. Temple even humorously explained the phrase ""ver so goot"" as a jovial expression of goodwill and comfort in Norse culture."|"[""1.

Norwegian beds are unique, being wooden boxes that are quite narrow and short, making them uncomfortable for taller individuals. Despite this, Norwegians seem to prefer this style of bed. The beds are filled with feather-beds above and below instead of blankets, making the night uncomfortably warm. Fred and Sam had a restless night due to the heat. In the morning, they were surprised by a ghostly visitor who turned out to be the house servant offering them coffee. Sam, initially startled, realized it was just the servant and accepted the coffee. Fred, teasingly, declined the offer, urging Sam to wake up and explore the city. The fish-market was calling, and they didn't want to miss out on the sights of the unique old city.|"['1.

The young Norwegian caught up with the girl, who greeted him warmly with a smile and a handshake. They walked together, chatting earnestly, along a winding road up the mountain. Fred followed, but soon they stopped at a small white house with a green door, forcing Fred to pass them. Feeling guilty for eavesdropping, Fred decided to walk ahead to hide his curiosity. As he walked, he overheard two men speaking in Norse. Hans, one of the men, expressed his determination to not give up on his love for Raneilda despite financial challenges. Fred, who had been eavesdropping, approached Hans and offered to help him with his situation. Hans, surprised but grateful, confided in Fred about his love for Raneilda and his financial struggles.|['Question 1:\nWho greeted the young Norwegian warmly with a smile and a handshake?\nA) Fred\nB) Hans\nC) Raneilda\nD) The girl\nE) The young Norwegian', 'Question 2:\nWhere did the young Norwegian and the girl stop walking together?\nA) At a small white house with a green door\nB) At a cafe\nC) At a park\nD) At a riverbank\nE) At a bookstore', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Fred decide to do when he felt guilty for eavesdropping?\nA) Approach Hans and offer help\nB) Continue eavesdropping\nC) Walk ahead to hide his curiosity\nD) Confront Hans and Raneilda\nE) Leave the area', 'Question 4:\nWho expressed determination to not give up on his love for Raneilda despite financial challenges?\nA) Fred\nB) The young Norwegian\nC) The girl\nD) Hans\nE) Raneilda', 'Question 5:\nHow did Hans react when Fred offered to help him with his situation?\nA) He rejected the offer\nB) He was surprised but grateful\nC) He ignored Fred\nD) He laughed at Fred\nE) He got angry with Fred', 'Question 6:\nWhat did Hans confide in Fred about?\nA) His plans to travel\nB) His financial struggles and love for Raneilda\nC) His favorite hobbies\nD) His dislike for Fred\nE) His desire to move away']|['D) The girl', 'A) At a small white house with a green door', 'C) Walk ahead to hide his curiosity', 'D) Hans', 'B) He was surprised but grateful', 'B) His financial struggles and love for Raneilda']
Hans, son of Eric, lived in a valley at the Nord Fiord's head. He aimed to manage his father's farm but needed to buy out family shares for $500. After two years of hard work, he still owed $200. Eager to marry his beloved Raneilda, he didn't want to wait longer. Hans and his friend Fred arranged to travel to Nord Fiord, with Fred organizing a pilot for their ship, the _Snowflake_. They rushed to stop the unnecessary slaughter of sheep for the journey. Norway's wild beauty awaited them with mountains, rivers, and stunning landscapes.

Their journey that day, like every other day, involved a challenging mix of uphill and downhill terrain. The landscape was so hilly that a leisurely pace was out of the question. They had to descend steep slopes quickly to make up for the time spent climbing up. The thrill of this wild ride excited the travelers, each with a hint of daring in their nature. The Norwegian ponies, small and usually cream-colored, with black or white manes and tails, were sturdy and lively creatures. They seemed to enjoy the fast-paced gallop after each demanding climb. The shooscarle, typically the pony's owner, wore a distinctive red nightcap and simple clothing. Fred led the way, Norman stayed in the middle, and Sam followed behind to ensure they stayed together. As they approached a steep section of the road near a river, Grant attempted to take the reins, but the ponies knew the way well. Fred and Grant navigated the descent and the bridge safely, while Sam, initially dozing off, had a close call near the river's edge before regaining control.|"['1.

When Sam realized his situation, he opened his eyes and braced for trouble. Not being an experienced driver, he didn't anticipate a large stone on the road. Despite the impending crash, the sturdy little cariole handled it well. After safely crossing a river, they faced a challenging hill. A sudden halt by the leader caused a jam, but they managed to mend the trace easily. The harness was simple, made of reins, a wooden collar, and saddle. Fred's detour led them into a lost state among the hills. They changed horses every ten miles, but confusion set in at a gloomy spot. Surrounded by mountains, the valley had a serene, rosy glow from the mountain-tops. The night was tranquil, with only the soothing sound of distant waterfalls breaking the silence.|"[""1.

The sun rose, and the birds chirped as they arrived at the next stop. To their surprise, this station was even poorer and more dismal than the previous one. Nestled in a rugged gorge, it seemed more suitable for wolves and bears than humans. Evidence of these wild creatures was apparent as a wolf skin and a bear skull adorned the walls of the first hut they entered. The villagers were impoverished and lacked intelligence. Accustomed to solitude, they were taken aback when asked for food. The travelers had to scavenge for sustenance themselves, finding only barley meat and sour milk. The Norwegians relished this sour milk, a staple made from cows grazing in mountain pastures. The hut was basic, furnished with log beds, stools, and a chest. Despite the humble setting, the travelers were welcomed, with the locals helping prepare a meal of porridge and fresh fish caught by Fred.|['1.

The issue of where to sleep arose. Grant solved it by lying on brushwood with a stool as a pillow. Fred and Sam faced dirty beds with straw bedding. However, these beds were not just for them. Unpleasantly, creatures lived there, fighting the boys all night. Fred and Sam battled the pests for hours until dawn. Just as they hoped for rest, an old woman barged in. She inspected them closely, even peering into Grant's mouth. After examining their belongings, she left but returned, causing a ruckus. The commotion woke the boys, except Grant. As they settled back, a strange noise outside grew louder, hinting at a new disturbance.|"['1.

Fred was startled by a loud noise and a massive rock crashing past his door, demolishing a shed and trees in its path. The rock had tumbled from the cliffs above, narrowly missing the hamlet. The valley was littered with fallen rocks, a common occurrence in Norway. The region experiences continuous daylight in summer and darkness in winter. Fred, delayed by calm seas, missed the sun's complete circle in the sky. The perpetual daylight amazed him and his friends. The scene evoked heavenly imagery from the Bible. Countless islands surrounded them, some small as boats, others towering mountains. Sea-birds filled the air with cries and melodies. Judging distances was tricky, as Bob Bowie mistook a large island for a smaller one. The deceptive appearance surprised the voyagers as they sailed through the serene waters.|"[""1.

Once, while sailing up a fiord, the passengers debated its width. Most believed it to be a mile across, but sailor Bill insisted it was only three-quarters of a mile. Bill, a seasoned sailor, claimed to have survived many shipwrecks and even murder, making him an authority. Despite frequent calms, the travelers enjoyed the journey north, with Fred starting each day by diving into the water. Accompanied by Sam for bird-shooting and stuffing, and Hans for rowing, they explored islands and sketched rugged hills.

Sam was completely confused by the perpetual daylight in the Arctic. He once went to bed at ten in the morning, mistaking it for night after working on Grant's eagle. Fred teased him about it, joking that maybe Sam needed a lunatic asylum. They were cautious not to fish or shoot on Sundays. The friends rowed to a creek for fishing and hunting. Grant bagged grouse, Fred caught sea-trout and a salmon, while Sam painted. Hans, fascinated by fly-fishing, was amazed by Fred's skills. When Fred hooked a salmon, Hans missed gaffing it the first time but succeeded on the second try. They returned to the schooner with their catch, where Captain McNab and Bob Bowie awaited them with smiles.|['1.

During their voyage along Norway's rugged coast, Fred and his friends rarely attended church. This didn't mean they weren't Christians; in fact, they aimed to live like Christ. On a calm Sunday, as their yacht sailed at a leisurely pace, they gathered for a service on deck. The crew joined in prayer as the vessel glided under towering cliffs and past rocky islands. Suddenly, as they rounded a promontory, a picturesque bay unfolded before them. With a sandy beach, green mounds, and quaint cottages, it stood out amidst the rugged landscape. A church on the highest mound overlooked the bay where a Norwegian vessel and small boats floated. Despite their limited church visits, Fred and his companions lived out their faith through their actions, finding moments of peace and beauty in nature's grandeur.|"[""1.

The cape around which the ship had just sailed provided complete protection to the bay, making the water as smooth as glass, reflecting boats, rocks, houses, and even the church. The sound of the church bell, though small, rang sweetly across the sea like a familiar hymn to the voyagers. The scene became more captivating as people gathered for church, arriving in boats from all directions. The men in red caps and women in white kerchiefs added a colorful touch to the otherwise somber attire. The church itself was unique, resembling a cluster of dove-cots with a steeple and weathercock. Inside, the church was plain yet clean, with minimal ornamentation around the altar. Despite some confusion, the visitors observed the Lutheran service respectfully, with Bob unintentionally finding himself seated among women. Embarrassed, he quietly left and was later found enjoying a smoke near the boat.|['1. What did the cape provide to the bay?\nA. Stormy weather\nB. Protection\nC. Strong winds\nD. High waves\nE.

In their view, the pastor's kindness and genuine nature only solidified their opinion. His wife and four children, including a boy and three fair-haired girls, warmly welcomed the visitors. The pastor, dressed in a black robe with a white frill reminiscent of Martin Luther, entertained them with coffee and homemade cakes. Despite language barriers, Grant conversed in French with the pastor, Fred spoke Norse with the hostess, and Sam entertained the children. The group spent a delightful Sunday and Monday exploring the pastor's home and village. They bid farewell with a tinge of sadness, knowing they had to set sail soon. The pastor guided them to a scenic mountain before they embarked on a cart journey to visit Laplanders inland.

During the rainy end of their journey to the Lapp village, Bob Bowie surprised his fellow travelers by revealing a large red cotton umbrella he bought in Bergen. The Lapps, a small and jolly people who wear hairy clothes and live in bee-hive-like homes, warmly welcomed Fred and his friends. Despite their small stature, the Lapps were friendly and curious, examining the visitors' attire with great interest. The schoolmaster, a comical figure at just under five feet, amused everyone with his antics, especially when he paraded around with Bob's umbrella. The Lapps, though uncouth, could read Norse, with one elder engrossed in a New Testament. Fred, impressed by their literacy, gifted them a Norse New Testament. The schoolmaster, with his peculiar appearance and behavior, added a touch of humor to the encounter.|"['1.

Late in the evening, our friends bid farewell to the Lapps and headed back on their journey. Despite trying to stay awake with conversation and song, they struggled to keep their eyes open. As they traveled, Fred, almost falling asleep, didn't realize they were close to their goal in Norway. Upon reaching a ridge, Hans pointed out the sun dipping close to the sea. Fred, surprised, doubted they were far enough north. But Hans, having been there before, knew otherwise. Climbing a nearby hill, they saw the sun had started to rise without setting.

Once, the crew left their schooner becalmed near the shore and rowed towards land. Pulling along the shore beneath a towering cliff, they heard voices above. Though bushes obscured their view, the sounds suggested a dispute. Suddenly, a crash and a dark object falling caught their attention. It was a pony and cariole that had tumbled off the cliff into the sea. The splash and foam marked where it vanished beneath the waves, only for the pony to resurface unharmed. On a different day, they encountered a whale while sailing up the Skars Fiord, a startling and impressive sight. The calm waters revealed the whale swimming near the yacht, close enough to see its features clearly. The crew was excited, especially when the whale dived beneath the yacht, reemerging on the other side. Fred even took a shot at the whale, causing it to swim away. Another adventure led them to a remote fiord, where the locals welcomed them warmly. While sketching, Sam was invited to a local's cottage, experiencing the simple yet cozy wooden homes of Norway.|"['1.

"The language here puzzled our artist quite a bit. As a lazy student, he had let Fred do all the talking, but now he was alone for the first time with a Norwegian! He tried to string together the little Norse he knew and pretended to know more. However, his speech turned into a mix of bad Norse and broad Scotch. Having lived in Scotland for many years, Sam found his knowledge of Lowland Scotch helpful, as it was similar to Norwegian. For example, they call a cow a ""ko"" or a ""coo."" ""Bring me meen skoe"" means ""Bring me my shoes."" ""Gae til land"" means ""Go ashore."" If you talk about bathing, they advise you to ""dook oonder.""
