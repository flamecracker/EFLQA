Marjorie's Uncle Steve carefully arranged various items in a book, teaching her how to do it herself. Thinner items like letters were pasted, while heavier ones like postcards were tucked into slits. Bulkier objects were tied to pages with ribbons. Marjorie, initially impatient, learned to be patient and careful, improving her work over time. Uncle Steve added dates and notes to each page, making the book precious to Marjorie. However, Marjorie struggled to obey Grandma's rule of using the carpeted stairs instead of the polished wooden stairs, often leaving marks and scratches. Despite many reminders and promises, Marjorie kept forgetting. Grandma warned of possible punishment if she continued to break the rule. Marjorie, eager to know the consequences, awaited Grandma's decision with curiosity and affection.|"['1.

Marjorie had been avoiding the Front Stairs diligently after her grandma's warning, except when she wore her delicate house slippers. The rule was clear: only light shoes were allowed on those stairs. However, one sunny morning, Marjorie was all set to go rowing with Carter and Molly. Dressed in a pink gingham dress and heavy-soled shoes for the boat trip, she was excited. With her hair tied back and a trowel in hand for fern digging, she was ready. But her plans were dashed when Grandma reminded her of the punishment for using the forbidden Front Stairs. Despite Marjorie's pleas to delay the consequence, Grandma stood firm, emphasizing the importance of discipline.

Marjorie sat on the stairs, feeling overwhelmed by the endless day ahead. She longed to have taken the Other Stairs and regretted her choice. Her kitten, Puff, had scampered away, leaving her alone. Attempting to pass the time with books and painting, she found herself frustrated by the lack of good light and missing materials. Determined to make the best of it, she devised a plan to sit on each step for five minutes. However, this proved unbearable, and she abandoned the idea. Jane, the kind maid, brought her a delicious lunch, lifting Marjorie's spirits. As she ate, the stairs seemed less daunting. With renewed energy, she declared the day half over and requested water to pursue her passion for painting.|"['1.

Grandma smiled slightly at the request but still gave Marjorie the glass of water. Marjorie spent a good thirty minutes painting pictures, but the uncomfortable position made her restless. Suddenly, she got an idea - sliding down the banister seemed like great fun. After a few tries, it became painful, and she eventually fell off, bumping her head. Reflecting on the incident, Marjorie realized that falling on the stairs side was fortunate as she had promised Grandma not to leave the stairs. The afternoon dragged on slowly, and Marjorie struggled to find ways to occupy herself. Despite feeling down due to the punishment, the love between Marjorie and Grandma was evident during a heartfelt embrace.

Carter quickly assessed the situation and without a word, he dashed back to the barn for a replacement ladder with Moses. The broken ladder needed a longer one, so they swiftly carried it across the field and propped it up. The loud firecracker noise had awakened Stella, who began crying upon realizing what had happened. Molly and Marjorie, relieved to see Stella awake, also broke down in tears. Carter, climbing up the ladder, found the girls wet and tearful. Concerned, he learned Stella had been struck by lightning and was presumed dead until the firecrackers woke her. Carter decided to take them to their grandma's house. Despite the seriousness of the situation, Marjorie found walking in the storm amusing without an umbrella, now that Stella was safe.

Uncle Steve drove to the caterer's to buy a can of ice cream for the Dunn family. Mrs. Dunn was deeply touched by Marjorie and the girls' kindness. The Dunns were struggling, but Mrs. Dunn was grateful for the support. The children were overjoyed with the ice cream, and the girls devised a plan to lower themselves into a well using buckets.

Excitedly, Molly climbed the stairs to meet Marjorie, who welcomed her warmly. They decided to have some fun by making paper dresses, a favorite activity. Today, without Stella's help, the dresses weren't as stylish. They used double sheets of newspaper for skirts, creating gowns with long trains. They added paper accessories like fans and hats. As they got engrossed in their creations, time flew by. Marjorie suggested climbing onto the wardrobe for more fun. They carefully climbed up using a table and chair. Molly's chair slip caused a minor mishap, but they enjoyed pretending to be on a high motor car. Eventually, they made a makeshift rope ladder from their paper skirts to safely descend.
