"Every night, the Katydids sang their familiar chorus, ""_Katy did, Katy did; she did, she did!_"" However, some members of Kiddie's clan liked to stand out by insisting, ""_Katy did, Katy did; she did, she didn't!_"" Despite the occasional disagreement, the majority drowned out any dissent with their loud clamor, confirming that Katy indeed did whatever it was. Kiddie, the loudest of them all, enjoyed making noise near Farmer Green's house, surpassing even the other Katydids. While the warm nights were filled with sounds like Chirpy Cricket and the Frog family's songs, Johnnie Green disliked Solomon Owl's eerie hooting. Kiddie remained focused on his chant, oblivious to the night's other noises. During the day, the Katydids stayed quiet, avoiding the many birds that filled Pleasant Valley. They joked about only caring for birds that didn't care about them, especially when Mr. Nighthawk was around hunting."|"['1.

Kiddie Katydid was cautious not to draw the attention of the night rover, Mr. Nighthawk. Despite his friends urging him to be quiet, Kiddie believed in taking a few risks. He knew if everyone stayed silent, it would be tough on Katy, who needed support. As he watched Mr. Nighthawk, Kiddie hoped the bird wouldn't notice him camouflaged among the leaves. When Mr. Nighthawk discovered him, Kiddie tried to remain composed. The encounter revealed Kiddie's family's talent for jumping, which surprised Mr. Nighthawk. Despite feeling startled, Kiddie managed to keep his cool and declined to showcase his jumping skills that night.|"['1.

Mr. Nighthawk had a strange habit of talking through his nose, perhaps due to his late-night habits giving him a cold. Despite his attempts to be pleasant, his nasal tone made Kiddie Katydid want to laugh. Mr. Nighthawk begged Kiddie to jump for him, growing hungrier as time passed. He suggested Kiddie ask his relatives or the Katy he always spoke of to jump instead. Kiddie refused, hinting that Mr. Nighthawk should figure it out himself. Despite being pressed, Kiddie remained secretive, leaving Mr. Nighthawk puzzled.|"[""1.

Mr. Nighthawk felt a bit silly. He used to think that repeating the same thing every night made someone dull. But when Kiddie Katydid asked him a question, he realized he was wrong. Kiddie praised Mr. Nighthawk's flying skills and asked for a demonstration. Although Mr. Nighthawk was proud of his flying, he worried about Kiddie disappearing. Suddenly, a loud call from Solomon Owl made Mr. Nighthawk flee in fear. Kiddie Katydid, relieved, knew Mr. Nighthawk was gone. Everyone laughed at Mr. Nighthawk's abrupt exit. Kiddie was smart not to fly away, knowing Mr. Nighthawk catches food mid-air.|"[""1.

"Kiddie Katydid had a secret that nobody knew about until Freddie Firefly stumbled upon it one night. Freddie was curious about Katy's secret song, so he approached Kiddie to ask questions.

Freddie Firefly faced a dilemma, pondering a solution when he heard the loud croaking from the swamp - the Frog family's nightly chorus. This sparked an idea in Freddie's mind. He rushed to speak to Mr. Frog, the tailor, who knew Mr. Crow well. However, upon reaching the swamp, Freddie found the party had ended. Luckily, Mr. Frog lingered behind. Freddie, using his light, caught Mr. Frog's attention. Mr. Frog, busy with tailoring, still agreed to help deliver a message to Mr. Crow.

"Freddie Firefly corrected Mr. Frog, revealing that Kiddie Katydid had been tricking them all by making the ""Katy did"" sound by rubbing his wings together. Startled, Mr. Frog hurried home at dawn to avoid Mr. Crow flying over. As he swam away, Mr. Frog mused about the discovery, feeling clever. Upon reaching home, he perched on his tailor shop's roof, eager to share the news with Mr. Crow. When Mr. Crow arrived, he gruffly inquired about the news, suspecting it was about tailoring. Mr. Frog, bursting with excitement, was ready to spill the secret about Kiddie Katydid's trick."|"[""Question 1: What did Freddie Firefly reveal to Mr. Frog?\nA) Mr. Crow's secret\nB) Kiddie Katydid's trick\nC) Mr. Frog's tailoring skills\nD) Mr. Frog's favorite food\nE) Mr. Frog's hiding spot"", 'Question 2: Why did Mr. Frog hurry home at dawn?\nA) To avoid Mr. Crow\nB) To catch Kiddie Katydid\nC) To find Freddie Firefly\nD) To go tailoring\nE) To take a nap', ""Question 3: How did Mr. Frog feel upon discovering Kiddie Katydid's trick?\nA) Angry\nB) Confused\nC) Clever\nD) Scared\nE) Sad"", ""Question 4: Where did Mr. Frog perch when he reached home?\nA) On a lily pad\nB) On a tree branch\nC) On his tailor shop's roof\nD) On Mr. Crow's nest\nE) On Freddie Firefly's back"", 'Question 5: What did Mr. Crow suspect the news was about?\nA) Tailoring\nB) Gardening\nC) Cooking\nD) Flying\nE) Swimming', ""Question 6: How was Mr. Frog feeling when he was about to reveal Kiddie Katydid's secret to Mr. Crow?\nA) Anxious\nB) Excited\nC) Bored\nD) Angry\nE) Tired""]"|"[""B) Kiddie Katydid's trick"", 'A) To avoid Mr. Crow', 'C) Clever', ""C) On his tailor shop's roof"", 'A) Tailoring', 'B) Excited']"
"""Don't!"" Mr. Crow pleaded. ""Please, don't! It's already annoying to hear that silly chorus when I wake up at night, and now I have to endure it in broad daylight too."" Mr. Frog, with a worried look, asked if Mr. Crow would share the story with others and give credit to him. Mr. Crow, wise and old, knew Mr. Frog's tricks and said he would share the news his way. Soon, all the animals in Pleasant Valley knew about Kiddie Katydid's music. Mr. Frog was upset when he heard that Kiddie might join the orchestra. Mr. Crow even sent a committee to invite Kiddie to the concert.

A group of field folk gathered at Mr. Frog's door, waiting for the tailor to appear. They all needed warm overcoats as they planned to be out late that night. Unbeknownst to them, Mr. Frog watched and giggled at their shivering discomfort. The crowd was actually Mr. Crow's committee, intending to invite Kiddie Katydid to join the Pleasant Valley orchestra. As the weather chilled, the group grew discouraged, fearing Mr. Crow's anger the next day for not visiting Kiddie Katydid. However, Chirpy Cricket lightened the mood by suggesting that Katydid would seek shelter indoors. Mr. Frog then set off to deliver the coat to Katydid, taking a river route to avoid the cold.

""I hear you're a musician,"" he continued. ""Join our singing society in the swamp. If you fiddle for us, Farmer Green will be listening."" Mr. Frog asked Kiddie not to play for anyone else.

One evening, Mr. Crow's group visited Kiddie Katydid on a pleasant moonlit night near Farmer Green's home. They could hear Kiddie's music from a distance. Kiddie declined Mr. Crow's invitation, which upset the group. Jasper volunteered to deliver the news, hoping for a reaction. Mr. Crow was furious upon hearing Kiddie's refusal. Kiddie enjoyed moving freely, hopping from tree to tree or flying. Benjamin Bat often crossed paths with Kiddie at night. Kiddie would stay hidden until Benjamin finished eating, finding him more pleasant then. Benjamin suggested sports at Farmer Green's yard, proposing a jumping contest with Mr. Frog and a race with Freddie Firefly. He recommended holding the activities in the evening.|"[""1.

Kiddie Katydid and Benjamin Bat were preparing for a night of sports at Farmer Green's place. Kiddie Katydid wanted to wait until late at night to join in because he knew he could jump and fly better then. Benjamin Bat, on the other hand, preferred to start the fun soon after dark because he felt lighter before eating much. When the night arrived, a crowd gathered eagerly, even though Benjamin had mentioned the fun would start almost at dawn. Mr. Frog, however, objected to the jumping contest with Kiddie Katydid, suggesting a swimming competition instead. Meanwhile, Benjamin Bat struggled to find a participant for the hanging-by-heels sport. Kiddie Katydid was clever enough to realize that Benjamin Bat might have other intentions, so he wisely avoided participating to avoid being eaten. Benjamin's bad temper made others wary, potentially spoiling the night's enjoyment.|"[""1.

"""Yes, indeed!"" Mr. Frog agreed. ""I've been pondering ways to stop all this bickering. It's not fair to Kiddie Katydid to have all this noise right at his doorstep. And since you're causing the most ruckus, I suggest you leave so we can enjoy the rest of the night peacefully.""

Benjamin, the Bat, thought it was odd. ""He must have turned off his light to trick me. But I don't mind because Kiddie Katydid is hiding somewhere in this tree, and I'm famished. I'll find him.""

Benjamin darted among the maple branches, twisting and turning wildly. Kiddie Katydid watched closely, ready to jump if needed. Despite Benjamin's keen night vision, he couldn't spot the hidden Katydid, perfectly blending in on a leaf. Benjamin overlooked the grayish tree branches, focused only on the green figure. Unbeknownst to him, the cat had sneaked into the tree for a bird hunt. Startled by the cat, Benjamin narrowly escaped, fleeing to the swamp.

"Kiddie Katydid had a neighbor much like him, Leaper the Locust. They were hard to tell apart, except for their horns. Kiddie had long horns, while Leaper's were short. Despite seeing each other often, they didn't get along. Their quarrels over their horns were as bad as Jimmy Rabbit and Frisky Squirrel's tail dispute. The field folk and Farmer Green's family confused them, calling both ""Grasshoppers."" Leaper disliked Kiddie's long horns and was tempted to move. They both refused to be called Grasshoppers until neighbors teased them. Eventually, they embraced the name. Kiddie claimed it was meant for him, while Leaper argued the same.
