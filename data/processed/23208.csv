The young girl raced away swiftly like the wind, her worn-out shoes making a clattering noise on the pavement. Janice watched her go and let out a sigh. A sudden heaviness settled on her thoughts. The brightness of the sun seemed dulled, and the fresh scents of Spring lost their pleasantness. Instead of heading down to the dock as planned, Janice turned back with slow steps towards home.

""He hurts her--and her mother--and the two little boys--and that unnamed baby--whenever he takes money to spend for drink. It doesn't particularly matter whether he beats her.

Nelson felt uneasy about the delay in his trial, suspecting the committee's intentions. The accusation of stealing a valuable coin collection weighed heavily on him. Despite the pressure, he decided to resign from his teaching position, feeling it was inappropriate to continue in light of the accusations. His resolve to face the situation head-on was evident as he planned to submit his resignation immediately. The community's judgment and the impending trial made him feel isolated, causing him to skip church to avoid the judgmental stares.

After school, Janice visited the Trimmins family, a group of Georgia ""crackers"" who had struggled to fit into the Vermont community.

It was a clever ploy that left Nelson in a worse position than if the case had gone to court. The public still viewed him with suspicion, and the legal principle of innocence until proven guilty was not respected in the New England village. Nelson could only clear his name by finding the real thief. The discovery of the stolen coin in circulation actually harmed the committee's case. Joe, in charge of the cash-drawer, denied receiving the gold piece from the fiddle buyer. Janice recalled a foreign man interested in the violin at Hopewell's store. She wondered if he was the mysterious buyer. Thinking about Cremona's famous violins, she pondered the value of Hopewell's instrument.|"[""1.

Janice sighed, pondering the mystery of Hopewell's fiddle's origin. She considered the possibility that Mr. Drugg might have owned a valuable violin without anyone knowing. Meanwhile, Walky Dexter delivered the daily mail to the library. Janice checked the New York paper for news about the Zapatist chief, Juan Dicampa, who had met a tragic end.

The family's financial woes were evident, with Hopewell having to sell his violin to cover expenses.

Janice's cousin grabbed the letter and anxiously examined the envelope. It was postmarked from a border town days after Juan Dicampa's reported death, yet the handwriting matched the guerrilla chief's. Breaking the seal, she found her father's familiar handwriting on the letter inside. Despite Juan Dicampa's demise, her father's letter made no mention of it, acting as if nothing had changed. Hopewell Drugg returned, revealing Lottie's uncertain fate after being under the doctors' care. Janice pondered the mysterious five-dollar gold piece found with Jim Narnay, wondering if it could clear Nelson Haley's name. She sought advice but found no one suitable to confide in, not even her uncle, aunt, or the minister. Janice visited Mrs. Beaseley, hoping to see Nelson, but only found the widow in tears, lamenting Nelson's farm work despite his other talents.|"[""1.

Joe Bodley found himself in a situation where he was eager to have money, not someone else's, but his own. He had saved up all he could and even borrowed against his future wages to gather the hundred dollars needed to buy a violin from Hopewell Drugg. Joe believed it was a valuable Cremona violin that could fetch a good price in the city. He instructed Walky to place it carefully behind the bar, planning to install a spigot soon. Joe felt deceived by the buyer who had only paid a portion of the agreed price and later claimed the violin was not worth what Joe had paid for it. As the expressman departed from the Inn, a storm cloud loomed over Old Ti, signaling a potential summer tempest.

""I traced your steps,"" Nelson chuckled. ""I stopped by Mrs. Beaseley's, and then heard you had gone to visit Jim Narnay's family. But I missed you there. Janice, the Narnays are truly unfortunate! I can't imagine how you can stand to visit them.""

""Oh, Nelson, the poor baby is very ill, and my visits bring some comfort to Mrs. Narnay. Besides, Sophie and the little boys are incredibly endearing. I can't help but feel for them.""

The wind had stirred the lake, creating whitecaps and waves crashing on the shore. The wind, carrying dust before the rain, swept through the town. Janice shielded her face as the rain began, and Nelson guided her through the storm. They sought shelter at the Inn, where the storm raged outside.

The thunderstorm raged above the Lake View Inn, making it seem like the storm's fury was centered there. Janice clung to Nelson's hand as the tempest reached extreme heights. Suddenly, the door burst open, revealing a tall, lean woman with a fierce gaze and trembling lips. Marm Parraday fell to her knees, her wild appearance shocking Janice. The thunder drowned out her cries. Meanwhile, as summer progressed, more visitors arrived in Polktown, filling up the Lake View Inn. Lem Parraday complained about the chaos in the kitchen due to his sick wife, Marm. Walky teased Lem about impending trouble. Despite the influx of visitors, the campaign against liquor sales continued, fueled by the disturbances caused by the railroad construction camp workers after payday.
