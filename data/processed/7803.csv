David quietly left the room, while Bob snuggled back under the covers. It was enjoyable to lie there, watching the fire crackle and seeing your breath in the cold air. The best part was knowing there was no rush to get dressed for school. No bells to make you hurry. Bob reveled in the idea of ten days without the need to rush. Glancing at his friend Van, still asleep, Bob couldn't resist the urge to play a prank. He carefully aimed his pillow and let it fly. After a leisurely breakfast of pancakes, they set off for a day of adventure. Bob assured his father they wouldn't be back until late afternoon due to the snowy climb ahead. As they trekked up the mountain, Bob marveled at the snow-covered landscape, pointing out familiar landmarks to Van. Despite the cold, they were excited for the journey ahead.|"['1.

Van was stuck in the mud up to his knees and called out to Bobbie for help. Bobbie refused, fearing he might get pulled in too. Van, feeling betrayed, asked for a pole to help him out. As Bobbie handed it over, the dead wood broke, causing Bobbie to fall into a snowdrift and Van to sit down abruptly in the mud. Despite the messy situation, Van managed to get his feet out and scolded Bobbie for not helping. Bobbie joked about being buried alive, and they continued their banter. Nearby, David and the Admiral were making maple sugar, with David pouring sap into a barrel on a sledge.

Mr. Hennessey chuckled as he explained to the boys about their father's honest business methods in making his fortune. They were provided with duck coats to protect their clothing as they visited the factory's basement where raw sugar was unloaded for cleansing and refining. The superintendent shared that the raw sugar came from various places like Cuba, Porto Rico, Java, and more. He explained the process of sugar production, starting from the tall sugar cane plants with broad leaves to the extraction of juice through crushing rollers. The liquid then went through evaporation and crystallization before being separated into sugar and molasses. Finally, the sugar was dried, packed, and sent to refineries for further processing. This was an eye-opening experience for the boys, learning about the intricate process behind something as simple as sugar.|"[""1.

Sugar refining plants are not found everywhere due to the high cost of building them. It is more practical to have these plants in large cities with good shipping facilities for receiving raw sugar and distributing the refined product. Each plantation does not need its own mill, as smaller growers may not produce enough to operate one. Instead, a central mill in a sugar district allows growers to bring their crop for processing in bulk, saving time and money. The cane is stripped of leaves before shipping, and the stalks are crushed to extract the juice. Raw sugar is usually transported to refineries by water, but during times of scarcity, like in the Great War, alternative methods like overland train transport may be used, affecting sugar prices. Mr. Hennessey emphasizes the interconnectedness of global trade and the importance of world peace for prosperity. The United States is a significant consumer of sugar, with even the poorer classes able to afford it for household use. Moderation in sugar consumption is advised for health benefits.|['1.

"""It appears so when you view it in numbers, right?"" replied the superintendent. ""Following the United States in sugar consumption is England, as they produce vast quantities of jam due to their fruitful country. The moist climate yields superb strawberries, gooseberries, and plums. With abundant, inexpensive fruit, the English excel in fruit canning, creating top-quality jams and marmalades. The Germans and French are more frugal than Americans, as sugar is less common. In Germany, it's normal to take unused loaf sugar from restaurants. Foreigners find our love for sweets excessive, considering it self-indulgent. Sugar refining involves various processes to purify the raw sugar into a clear liquid.

Mr. Hennessey pointed out that to make sugar successfully, it is crucial to prevent fermentation by stirring it constantly with paddles. Cleanliness is key, ensuring vats and equipment are spotless. The process involves washing walls with lime to maintain freshness. Making cane sugar is manageable if done carefully and correctly. Skilled chemists oversee the process, testing liquid samples to ensure quality. Crystallization follows, requiring precision to regulate crystal size. Expertise is needed to determine the right moment for crystallization. The sugar is then spun in centrifugal machines to remove liquid, leaving dry crystals. Dust is blown off, and the sugar is packaged. Automatic machines fill boxes with precise weights, sealed by workers. The sugar is packed for distribution to stores. Mr. Hennessey acknowledged the complexity but emphasized the importance of attention to detail in sugar-making.|['1.

"""No, they're not; they are, however, not unlike them. They differ in having more juice and in usually being white,"" explained Mr. Powers. ""To grow beets, the ground is plowed and harrowed, then laid off in eighteen-inch rows for planting from seed. The crop requires thinning and weeding for proper growth. After about five months, the ripe beets are dug up, washed, and sliced into cossettes. The sliced beet-root is placed in warm water tanks to extract sugar. The remaining process is akin to refining cane-sugar, with syrup thickening in tanks and molasses extracted. Molasses is boiled multiple times for different grades.
