The old and mismatched furniture in Janice's uncle's home was a sight to behold. Despite the shaky chair, toppling bureau, and scratched washstand, it was the bed with only three legs and a soap-box propping up the fourth corner that raised eyebrows. Mrs. Day nonchalantly explained that Uncle Jason had intended to fix it but never got around to it. Janice, feeling uneasy, tested the bed's stability. This scenario was a common occurrence in the Day household, where repairs were only made when absolutely necessary. Janice also observed her cousin Marty, a carefree and idle teenager, and felt doubtful about his future. Despite the dilapidated surroundings, Janice tried to remain positive, suggesting other activities she could do in the garden.

Janice was silently shaking her head, acknowledging the likelihood of Marty's words. Marty's persistence made her willing to abandon the carrot patch. Despite this, she took pride in tidying up a portion of the bed. Walking alongside Marty through the barnyard and paddock, it was evident Marty was right about the neglected horses' coats and the poor cow's condition. Janice refrained from suggesting repairs to Marty, as neglect and decay were evident all around the farm. The climb through the pasture and woodlot was delightful, and the sound of falling water delighted Janice. However, Marty expressed the challenges of working on rocky farms. Inside the house, Aunt 'Mira was busy with supper despite the unwashed dishes. Janice changed into a fresh frock and sat by the window, the loose rocker clicking as she swung back and forth.|"[""1.

Janice spotted a young girl on the old wharf. The child, about eight or nine years old, was blind and heading towards the edge of the broken wharf. Janice, alarmed by the danger, rushed to help. The blind girl was unaware of Janice's presence and seemed upset about losing something. To prevent a mishap, Janice lightly touched the girl and guided her away from the edge.

"""I used to hear,"" said the girl who was struggling. ""And I could see, too. Oh, yes! I haven't forgotten how things look. You know, I'm Lottie Drugg. I can find my way about. But--but I've lost the echo. I used to hear _that_ always. I'd run down there to the wharf and shout to the echo, and it would answer me. But now I've lost it.""

Janice gently squeezed the small hand once more. Tears welled up in her eyes, yet the child remained silent. It was becoming increasingly difficult for her to speak. Like many who are completely deaf, soon she would be unable to speak as well. She mouthed her words in a heartbreaking manner.

""Do you love me?"" asked Lottie Drugg, returning the embrace. ""I wish I could hear you. But I can't hear father anymore--nor his fiddle; only when he makes it quiver. Then I know it's crying. Did you know a fiddle could cry? You come home with me. Father will play the fiddle for you, and _you_ can hear it.""

I am heading to a place I call The Overlook, a grand rock up ahead. Climbing to its top, I see so much of the world that I realize how small I am. My troubles seem tiny in the grand scheme. I understand that God has much to tend to in the Universe, and I must wait my turn. As we walked through the pasture and into the wood lot, we reached an unexpected opening with a huge boulder surrounded by hazel-nut bushes. From there, we saw the lake, the fortress in the northwest, and the spot of historic events. The view from The Overlook made God's world seem bigger and greater. It comforted me, reminding me of the vastness of God's care over all. It taught me to appreciate God's bigness and to wait patiently.|"[""1.

Janice and Mr. Middler discussed the need for a safe place for boys like her cousin Marty to hang out. They talked about opening the church basement for them, but some were concerned the boys might misbehave. Janice suggested a well-lit room with games and books, even dreaming of a gymnasium. The minister supported the idea, and it led to the creation of the Poketown Free Library. The library grew slowly, but Janice found solace in promoting the reading room. Mr. Middler was inspired by the visit and preached a different sermon, bringing hope to troubled members.

The Union Sunday School had a library, but it faced similar criticisms like many other institutions of its kind. In Polktown, what was truly needed was a space for the village's youth to read and engage in recreational activities. The concept of a club-room for reading and games had to originate from the boys themselves, with minimal adult interference. An empty store on High Street was identified as a potential location for this room. To furnish it, a long table, small tables, a desk, shelves for books, lamps, a stove, chairs, and curtains were required. Janice Day sought Elder Concannon's help to cover the rent for the first three months.

Janice sparked interest in the young people's society for a project to raise funds for a new piano. With her enthusiasm and that of others, they successfully acquired a grand silk flag to replace the tattered one that had long flown at the Town Hall. The changes in Poketown didn't stop there. A new dock, inspired by an idea from a local girl, Walky, brought further improvements. A garbage-collection ordinance was initiated by Mr. Cross Moore after a diphtheria epidemic, leading to a cleaner town and a new garbage collection system.

Mrs. Marvin Petrie made it clear that they would take their business elsewhere if stores weren't cleaned up. Eventually, even Mr. Jones had to give in to the pressure and join the movement.
