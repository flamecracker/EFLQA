"By ""branch"" he meant a brook, and Dick happily followed. They discovered a clear stream, a few feet wide and shallow, rushing between slopes, likely flowing into Bull Run. Many soldiers, mostly young, were already bathing in its cool waters. Dick and the sergeant joined, feeling invigorated by the sparkling current. ""It's great. But a taste of that beef and coffee will bring us closer to Heaven,"" said the sergeant. After hard work and battles, appetite surged. The sergeant shared his past as a lumberman with mighty hands, able to pull apart horseshoes. Soon, a horse charged, and with a swift move learned in cavalry, the sergeant calmed it.

Dick, Warner, and Whitley were part of a division that camped near the capital after marching over the Long Bridge. Despite the defeat at Bull Run, the capital saw an influx of troops from the north and west. The men yearned for leadership and discipline to face the enemy again. Lincoln, despite the defeat, remained calm and collected, listening to the narratives of those who witnessed the battle. The defeat spurred a surge of recruits pouring into the capital, including men and boys from various states. Amidst the apparent pause in hostilities, Dick sensed a brewing conflict between the North and South.

"The commander wore a striking uniform, his stature short and robust, barely reaching the President's shoulder. Brimming with youth and confidence, his lively gestures and assertive demeanor caught the attention of two boys. Despite the sergeant's concerns about his youthfulness, the soldiers in the capital had unwavering faith in ""Little Mac,"" as they affectionately called him. As they followed him and the President into the White House, the boys, though thoughtful, observed the scene. Reflecting on the challenges of leading during a war, they contemplated the South's defensive strength and troop numbers. The regiment later joined forces near Arlington, awaiting action amid the scorching summer heat.

European newspapers criticized the Northern troops, predicting the Union's collapse. Monarchs and elites celebrated the Republic's peril, revealing their disdain. Dick felt wounded, but Warner remained calm. The balloon ascended daily from the Northern camp, scouting the Southern forces. Dick finally boarded with officers and aeronauts, marveling at the landscape below. The scenery, now brown from summer's end, captivated him. The Blue Ridge and Southern campfires came into view, reminding him of Bull Run. Despite the beauty, the Southern army's presence loomed. As the sun set, Dick observed the Capitol in the distance, but his focus returned to the South's serene yet ominous landscape.|"[""1.

Dick observed the campfires of the Southern army from a great height. He reflected on the defiance to the Union that the fires symbolized. Despite the Northern army's strength and equipment, McClellan delayed in taking action.

In the midst of a tense situation, a young Vermonter discussed the principle of exceptions with great seriousness. He allowed Dick to shoot in the air as a sign of peace when encountering his cousin during battle. However, establishing this exception was challenging. Failure to do so meant Dick would have to aim straight at his cousin's heart. As days passed without any significant movement, Dick returned to Colonel Newcomb's quarters to write despatches. The summer faded into autumn, with leaves turning vibrant colors and falling from trees. The air grew crisp, hinting at the impending winter. Despite pressure from the army and the public, Little Mac, also known as the Young Napoleon, delayed his actions due to a distorted perception of the enemy's strength. The South prepared for battle, while the North faced delays and uncertainties. As the weather turned colder, Dick and his friend sat by a warm fire, reflecting on the turmoil in the country and hoping for Providence's protection in the midst of the brewing conflict.|"[""1.

Warner and the sergeant received a letter from Dick's mother, but they respected his privacy and didn't ask questions. Dick carefully folded the letter and put it back in his coat. He gazed into the fire, thinking deeply about the news. He shared with his comrades that a Confederate general was gathering troops near Bowling Green, and fighting was imminent. Dick expressed his desire to join the action out west. The sergeant suggested influencing Colonel Newcomb to move the regiment westward. Dick agreed and successfully persuaded the Colonel to send them to aid the Union forces in the mountains of West Virginia and Kentucky before heading to Western Kentucky and Tennessee.

Dick and Warner were preparing for a journey to Washington with Colonel Newcomb and Major Hertford. The regiment, consisting of seven hundred men, was set to travel on a long train with primitive coaches. As they departed from Arlington to Washington, the soldiers were ready for new adventures. The landscape outside appeared desolate and gloomy, with the last leaves falling from the trees. Despite the cold, drizzling weather, Warner remained optimistic, relying on his mathematical calculations. He recalled the challenges faced in Baltimore during a previous fight and warned Dick about the city's sympathies toward the South.

"""It's likely,"" Dick said, ""we'll face this challenge often when we head South. Winning this war, George, will take hard fighting, more hard fighting, and even more of the same."" Dick scanned the coach filled with young soldiers. Apart from officers and sergeants, no one was over twenty-five. Most were nineteen or twenty, the same in other coaches. Despite initial gloom, their spirits lifted. The vigor of youth shone through. Eager to see Baltimore, the brief stop didn't allow them to leave. Heading west, rain intensified, obscuring the view. After a meal, many dozed in cramped seats. Dick, too, fell asleep. By afternoon, most in their coach slept, except Sergeant Whitley. As the train rumbled westward through the mountains, the rain and wind persisted. With added engines, speed slowed. The engineer, unsure of the track, navigated cautiously. The Alleghanies, though not towering, posed challenges. In the Civil War, these mountains demanded utmost vigilance. Colonel Newcomb and Major Hertford joined the anxious engineer in the cab, as the train crept along perilous tracks. The thunderous train echoed through deep valleys, battling gusts of rain and darkness."""|"['1.

Curious eyes watched Dick and the sergeant near the stove. Dick, warm and satisfied, felt like sleeping but observed the boy operator finishing dispatches. The trio, warmed and fed, awaited a reply from Washington. Dick and the sergeant stepped outside. A farmer warned of guerillas led by Skelly in the hills.

Dick carefully stowed away the important message from the President, eager to deliver it to the colonel. The trio, well-rested and prepared, bid farewell and set off at full speed towards the pass. As they rode, Red Blaze pointed out the signs of an impending snowstorm approaching from the southwest. Despite the ominous clouds, the wind at their backs propelled them forward. Riding hard, they ascended the slopes, with Dick feeling the weight of the message in his pocket. The wind, though strong, seemed to aid their journey. Petty, with his keen eye, noticed a horseman and a group trailing behind on a path intersecting their route.

The guerilla leader reined in his horse, signaling his men to retreat. Though it seemed like a withdrawal, the three companions knew better. Riding among the scrub, Whitley warned his comrades to stay in the middle of the road. Red Blaze urged his horse into a gallop, with Dick and the sergeant close behind. The raiders fired shots, but the sergeant, an expert marksman, returned fire, hitting one of the pursuers. As they rode on, the pass widened, revealing a plan by the raiders to ambush them in the forest. Red Blaze, familiar with the terrain, predicted a snowstorm that would provide cover.

In the snowy landscape, Dick, the sergeant, and Red Blaze rode together, guided by the sure instincts of the wise horse. Despite a distant shout and a flash of a firearm, they pressed on. Red Blaze's knowledge of the path led them safely through the blizzard towards Townsville. As they descended, the snow lessened, and the village came into view. Reaching the waiting train, Dick delivered the crucial dispatch to Colonel Newcomb. The colonel's face lit up with satisfaction as he read the message.

The Vermonter emphasized the importance of knowing the way and being prepared for the journey, stating that it accounted for a significant portion of marching and fighting.

As the journey continued, the boys on the train chatted and laughed, reflecting on their recent victory and the recognition from the President.

Dick and his companions were on a mission in the icy wilderness, navigating false trails with loyal mountaineers guiding them back. Major Hertford's troop grew with volunteers, mainly sympathetic mountaineers loyal to the Union. One day, Dick, Warner, and Sergeant Whitley scouted ahead. As they rode, they discovered a cozy valley with a house emitting smoke. The place was well-kept, unlike typical mountain homes. They heard a captivating voice singing a heartfelt melody, echoing through the ridges. The trio paused, sensing the singer's extraordinary talent and depth of emotion. The haunting tune stirred their hearts, expressing longing and love. They couldn't see the singer but felt his exceptional spirit in the music.|"['1.

"""I'm curious to see that singer,"" said Warner. ""I heard grand opera once in Boston, just before I started to the war, but I never heard anything that sounds finer than this. Maybe time and place help to the extent of fifty per cent, but, at any rate, the effect is just the same.""

The three rode at a rapid pace until they reached the valley. There they drew rein, as they saw near them a tall man, apparently about forty years of age, mending a fence, helped by a boy of heavy build and powerful arms. The man glanced up, saw the blue uniforms worn by the three horsemen, and went peacefully on with his fence-mending. He also continued to sing, throwing his soul into the song, and both work and song proceeded as if no one was near.

""I judge that the singer will talk about almost everything except what we want to know,"" said the shrewd and experienced sergeant, ""but we can certainly do no harm by speaking to him. Of course they have seen us. No doubt they saw us before we saw them.""

After welcoming them, the old woman sat down and stared into the fire, lost in thought about the dangerous early days with lurking Indians.

Jarvis suggested that Dick and Harry might be reincarnations of historical figures.

The moonlight glowed brightly, casting a silvery sheen over the deep blue sky filled with countless stars. Dick rode alongside a small river flowing southward, its frozen surface gleaming like cold steel under the moon's rays. Leaving the river behind, he continued northward as the sky darkened briefly before the dawn broke, painting the mountains with a red but chilly hue. Dick paused at a brook to drink and feed his horse, then journeyed through hills gradually giving way to flat lands. As night approached, he ventured into the peaceful hill country, untouched by war, where he found shelter with a welcoming farmer. The next morning, Dick stocked up on provisions and set off through the hills, benefiting from the cold that kept troops at bay.|['1.

The day was clear, the temperature well below zero, but his warm clothing kept him comfortable. His horse showed no fatigue, its sinews seemingly made of steel. At noon, Dick didn't stop at a farmhouse for lunch, eating from his saddlebags as he rode on. With determination to reach Pendleton, he pressed forward, passing in the night. As twilight fell, he recognized familiar surroundings, riding swiftly to avoid being seen. Approaching Pendleton under the starlit sky, he saw the town's landmarks, including the academy where he and Harry Kenton studied. Despite the distance, he could not see the specific house he sought, hidden by evergreens. Taking in the scene, he prepared to ride straight to his destination.|"[""1.

The boy's heart raced with excitement as he approached the low house among the evergreens. Despite his eagerness, he urged his horse to slow down, moving silently on the dead turf beside the road. As he neared the house, a light shining from a window in the second story caused his pulse to quicken. He carefully approached the portico, staying hidden in the shadows. He threw sand at the window, and a beautiful woman's head appeared, framed by yellow hair and blue eyes. She disappeared briefly but quickly reappeared at the door, embracing her son.

When he was about fifteen miles from Buell's camp, heavy snow started falling. But he didn't worry. His strong horse safely carried him to his destination. By sundown, the young messenger stood before General Don Carlos Buell, a mysterious figure he would remember from the war. Buell, even more reserved than General Thomas, received him in a simple tent. After handing over the dispatch, Buell read the message from General Thomas, warning about Johnston's imminent attack. Impressed, Buell commended the messenger, Mr. Mason, and granted his wish to join a detachment heading to Elizabethtown. The detachment, led by Colonel Winchester, would travel to Louisville, then to Cairo by water. Dick was pleased to join Colonel Winchester, a respected man from Pendleton.

When Colonel Winchester and the boy saluted and left General Grant's tent, they noticed steamers with smoke billowing from their funnels on the Mississippi River. Along the shores of the Ohio and Mississippi, they saw troops in tents. Heavy cannons lined the wharves, while supplies were being loaded onto steamers from wagons. It was clear that this expedition would travel by water. As Dick and Colonel Winchester observed, a small steamer docked, and soldiers disembarked. Excited, Dick recognized his former commander, Colonel Newcomb, and his comrade, Lieutenant George Warner. Dick's friends greeted him warmly, expressing relief at his safe return. Dick was transferred to Colonel Winchester's staff and spent the night in Cairo.

The River Queen steamer carried his regiment, with cabins torn away to accommodate troops sleeping on the decks. Most soldiers were young, around twenty or even sixteen, but adaptable. They lounged comfortably, playing music. Dick noticed a boy in deerskin attire, Frank Pennington, a Kentuckian and Nebraska hunter. Frank joined the Kentuckians, becoming fast friends with Dick. As the engines roared, the flotilla left the Mississippi for the Ohio River. The vast, gray Ohio impressed them, surrounded by a wintry wilderness.

Since arriving in Cairo, Dick learned about Fort Henry, situated on marshy ground facing the Tennessee River, armed with seventeen big guns. He also knew of the larger Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River in Tennessee. The two forts were close due to the parallel rivers. Dick speculated they might attack both. He praised General Grant's leadership, contrasting public opinion with their firsthand experience. As they sailed on the fleet, Dick, a descendant of a learned ancestor, felt the Union's naval superiority would secure victory.

The Tennessee River, though not as mighty as the Ohio, is considered a giant river in many lands. It stretches far, allowing ships to navigate hundreds of miles upstream. The fleet, moving through the waters, could even venture into Alabama, deep into the heart of the Confederacy. As evening approached, the sky darkened, clouds blending with the landscape. The river's surface reflected the dark hulls of the fleet, emitting sparks from smokestacks and a massive cloud of smoke trailing behind. Dick, observing the scene, knew his uncle Colonel Kenton's people would provide aid if needed. The soldiers, nestled under blankets on the deck, rested as the boats sailed through the Tennessee River, surrounded by the wilderness.

The cannons roared, echoing across the river as the Confederate troops near the fort hesitated. General Tilghman and his brave gunners fought valiantly against the approaching fleet, despite the overwhelming barrage. The fort's defenses offered little protection as the enemy closed in. Despite the fierce resistance, the Confederate forces were gradually overwhelmed. Colonel Winchester acknowledged the fleet's superior tactics and firepower, foreseeing the fort's fate. As the battle raged on, casualties mounted on both sides. Eventually, General Tilghman signaled surrender, knowing further resistance was futile. The Union forces, led by General Grant, swiftly occupied the fort. The victory was celebrated, but it was clear that more significant challenges lay ahead, with the formidable Fort Donelson looming across the Cumberland River.

Much of the news was shared by farmers, Union supporters, and Dick and his friends. As they gathered around the fires after the short winter day, they grasped the situation almost as well as the generals. Warner mentioned that Donelson held a significant strategic advantage over Henry. He predicted that an attack on Donelson by both land and water was imminent. Despite Dick's doubts about the army and fleet's coordination, days passed without any word from the Confederates. Dick observed Grant's energy and determination. Supplies and reinforcements were mobilized as Grant prepared to besiege Donelson. Johnston recognized the strength of his opponent and the influx of Union troops.

All eyes now turned westward as the action shifted from Kentucky to Tennessee. The telegraph buzzed with reports about Grant, a new name causing a stir. While some doubted his abilities, others admired his daring moves. In the South, confidence in Johnston was unwavering. Grant's plan to besiege Donelson stirred up both fear and excitement. Buell's army also prepared to join the fight, utilizing the rivers to their advantage. As troops from different states gathered, the anticipation for battle grew. Grant's army, unaware of the world's speculations, braced themselves for the upcoming mission. Despite the challenges ahead, they remained resilient and eager for the march towards Donelson.|"[""1.

That night, bags of mail arrived at the camp by steamer, traveling through the Green, Ohio, and Tennessee rivers. To his joy, Dick received a letter from his mother, learning that only one of his letters had reached her, written from Cairo. His mother expressed concern about the impending battle and General Grant's reputation for being stern. She shared news from Pendleton about the armies moving south and the possibility of a great battle. Dick's uncle, Colonel Kenton, served with General Johnston, adding complexity to the looming conflict. His mother praised Colonel Winchester, expressing relief that Dick was under his command.

The command to move forward didn't arrive the following morning, making Dick briefly doubt if it would come at all. Reports from Donelson were concerning, and Grant's army wasn't ready for winter. With limited wagons for supplies and some regiments ill-prepared for the cold, the army faced challenges. Despite this, the determination to advance was clear. The troops, including Dick and Pennington, set out at dawn, braving the winter chill. As they marched towards the Cumberland, encountering Confederate cavalry, they pressed on. Approaching the formidable fortress defended by thousands, Dick felt the weight of the task. Yet, led by Grant's resolve, they moved forward undeterred. The belief in the strength of leadership was evident as they faced the imposing enemy stronghold, ready to confront the challenges ahead.|"[""1.

After the initial sinking feeling, Dick felt an intense excitement. He was perceptive and imaginative, aware of the significance of the unfolding events. The immediate surroundings didn't captivate him as much as the broader implications. Dick possessed a foresight that allowed him to grasp the importance of the landscape around him, including fortresses, hills, rivers, and forests. Understanding the dire situation, Dick realized the fleet was crucial not just for morale and combat but also to address the army's shortages of food and ammunition. As the cold evening set in, Dick and his comrades braved the chill, stationed near Fort Donelson. Throughout the night, they observed the Union army encircling the fortress, except for the northern side guarded by Hickman Creek. Despite the tense atmosphere, the night passed slowly with mist rising from the rivers. The following morning, under heavy clouds, the Southern cannons threatened the besiegers, setting a tense tone for the day. General Grant and other officers strategized while watching the river for the approaching steamers from the Ohio.|['1.

"Nothing appeared on the surface of the Cumberland River. The dark gray river flowed calmly under the gloomy clouds, passing by Fort Donelson. Occasionally, there was a flash of fire from the fort, followed by the booming sound of cannons echoing through the forest. The Northern batteries would sporadically retaliate. It was a preliminary battle with lots of noise but little danger, hinting at what was to come.

Dick hurried back, suddenly ducking as a shell whizzed over him from the fort, narrowly missing him. Unscathed, he continued his mission. The lieutenant-colonel acknowledged his return, and Dick rode back to the generals, who were eagerly awaiting the start of the battle.

After a brief lull, the fierce artillery exchange began, lasting what felt like hours to many soldiers. The Union troops had to retreat, unable to breach the Southern fortifications. Despite this, they managed to secure strategic hills, holding their ground. Eventually, the battle subsided, leaving Dick's regiment victorious on the hills above Dover, ready to threaten the Southern lines."|['1.

"""We have not failed utterly,"" he said. ""Don't you see that we have here a projection into the enemy's lines? If those reinforcements come, it will be thrust further and further. I tell you, that general of ours is a bulldog. He will never let go."" Yet, there was little but gloom in the Union camp. The short winter day, somber and heavy with clouds, was drawing to a close. The field where the assault had taken place was within the sweep of the Southern guns. Some of the Northern wounded had crawled away or been carried to their camp, but others and the numerous dead still lay upon the ground. The cold increased. The Southern winter is subject to violent changes. The clouds, which had floated up without ceasing, were massing heavily. Now the young troops regretted bitterly the blankets they had dropped on the way or left at Fort Henry. Detachments were sent back to regain as many as possible, but long before they could return, a sharp wind with an edge of ice sprang up, the clouds opened, and great flakes poured down, driven into the soldiers' eyes by the wind. The situation was enough to cause the stoutest heart to weaken, but the unflinching Grant held on. The Confederate army within the works was sheltered at least in part, but his own, outside, and with the desolate forest rimming it around, lay exposed fully to the storm. Dick, at intervals"|"[""1.

During the intense cold and darkness of the night, Dick and his companions, Pennington and Warner, tirelessly assisted the wounded and gathered wood for the fires. Sergeant Whitley, wise and experienced, guided them through the harsh conditions. As they huddled around the fires, the sergeant assured them that they could endure whatever challenges lay ahead. Despite the deep snow covering the battlefield, the men found comfort in the warmth of the flames.

"""I think this is covering fire,"" said Sergeant Whitley, standing nearby. ""Four small boats can't take down a strong fortress like Donelson. It's a different battle from Fort Henry."" The sergeant was right. Down the river, troops and supplies were arriving to support Grant's forces. Five thousand men and supplies were brought in, boosting morale. The gunboats tried to pass the fortress but faced heavy resistance. Despite setbacks, the soldiers found comfort in having food and reinforcements. Grant focused on fortifying their position.

Colonel Winchester, overhearing the conversation, decided to take three boys on a scouting mission requested by General Grant. The task was perilous, as they had to gather information near the Southern army lines. Despite the danger, the group's shared heritage and language might aid them. They approached Hickman Creek, a northern barrier, under the cover of darkness and snow. The group observed Southern sentinels near the fort and noticed no signs of heightened defense preparations. Colonel Winchester assessed the Confederate leaders, noting weaknesses in their command. While animosity lingered, human kindness occasionally prevailed, even among opposing forces during lulls in battle.

Colonel Winchester found his suspicions confirmed within the fort, where confusion reigned. The retreating garrison from Fort Henry had exaggerated Grant's army's threat, leaving many inexperienced young soldiers in doubt and fear. Pillow and Floyd arrived, failing to inform Johnston of their position. Buckner and Kenton planned an attack, while Forrest paced, expressing urgency. As they ventured closer to the fort, they encountered a vigilant picket.

As George and Dick huddled by the fire, preparing for battle, the Union army faced challenges. Grant's troops, mostly inexperienced farmer youths, struggled to follow orders and maintain cohesion. Despite gaps in their lines, Grant positioned heavy guns to bombard Fort Donelson. The continuous fire aimed to unsettle the Confederate troops within.

Dick wrapped himself in a heavy blanket and rested his head on a log by the fire, struggling to sleep due to his nerves. He noticed uneasiness among the officers who felt unprepared for the siege.

Pillow stated that Grant could still be defeated, but later agreed with Floyd. They had two small steamers in the Cumberland that could transport them up the river. Leaving the command to Buckner, the third in rank, they authorized him to surrender. Forrest, with his black beard, declared firmly, “I won't surrender my cavalry to anyone,” and led them through hidden paths to freedom. Colonel George Kenton rode alongside him. The news of an imminent surrender spread among the soldiers, causing confusion as high-ranking officers were preoccupied with escaping by river. Throughout the night, the two small steamers worked tirelessly, but many troops were left behind. Dick, unaware of the situation, slept deeply until Warner woke him at dawn.

Twice they crossed streams. One was shallow enough for the horses to walk through, but the other was deep, forcing them to swim.

Despite the lurking danger, they found joy in their open-air adventure. Heading towards Nashville, they reached a more populated and cultivated area. At nightfall, they spotted a grand red brick house on a hill, surrounded by trees. The troop's leader, Colonel Winchester, approached the house with a few others, seeking information about nearby Southern forces.

Dick enthusiastically helped search for firewood, venturing farther than the others into a forest. As he reached the edge and glimpsed fields, he heard the rhythmic beat of approaching hooves.

Dick felt a surge of anger upon learning that Grant was stripped of his command. He understood the importance of holding onto their hard-won victories. Johnston's forces were regrouping at Murfreesborough, growing to forty thousand strong. The North's leadership was indecisive, lacking the initiative of the Southern generals.

In a few days, they arrived at the large camp near the Tennessee River. Spring was breaking through the winter's grip, with green sprouting in the forests and fields. The wilderness's fresh scent invigorated them, making life feel vibrant. Despite their young age, the horrors of Donelson didn't linger.

During the Civil War, new generals joined Grant's forces. One of them, Sherman, caught Dick's attention with his brief yet wise words. Sherman's division was stationed near a small church, where Dick often delivered messages. Sherman doubted an easy victory over the South and predicted a challenging battle. Despite waiting for reinforcements, the Union army remained optimistic. The soldiers enjoyed plentiful food and good shelter. As nature bloomed around them, they eagerly awaited Buell's arrival to resume their march southward. Seeking refuge from a sudden rain, Dick and his friends found Sergeant Whitley in the church.

"""The rain is almost over,"" he said. ""It was just a passing shower. But it seems to have already given a new shade of green to the leaves and grass. It's amazing how quickly a rain can transform everything in spring, when nature is eagerly waiting to grow and bloom. I've been on the plains where everything looked brown and lifeless. Then a big rain came, and the next day, everything was a vibrant green as far as the eye could see, with little flowers blooming under the grass.""

""I think there's a part of it in every person,"" replied Sergeant Whitley seriously. ""I remember once after a long chase through rough, dry country, we found a lush valley, like a pocket in the hills, filled with green trees, grass, and wildflowers. It not only provided comfort but also touched our hearts. Every one of us, even those who couldn't read, appreciated its beauty and began speaking more softly and kindly. You feel these things more intensely in war than any other time.""

""I guess you do,"" said Dick. ""Spring is arriving in Kentucky, where I live, and I'd love to see the new grass swaying in the wind and the young leaves rustling together.""

""Enough with the sentimentality,"" said Warner. ""If you keep at it, Pennington will start talking about the Nebraska plains and the massive buffalo herds.""

As Dick rode away from his comrades, the words of Sergeant Whitley echoed in his mind, warning of the Confederate forces. Yet, the thought of seventy thousand strong Union troops marching under Grant's command filled him with hope. Riding through the lush forest, the scent of nature invigorated him, pushing him to reach Buell's army. Hindered by swollen rivers and delayed orders from distant commanders, Buell's progress was slow. Unbeknownst to Dick, a missed order and a change of mind by Grant altered the course of history, leading to unexpected outcomes. Despite the challenges, Dick remained unaware of the intricate web of events unfolding around him, focused on his duty to deliver the crucial dispatch to General Buell.|"[""1.
