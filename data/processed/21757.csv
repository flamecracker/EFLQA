About 2700 years ago, a Phoenician sea-captain named Arkal lived in a Greek port. He commanded a unique vessel with one mast, fifty oars, and a dragon's tail. One morning, Arkal prepared to set sail when a loud call from his mate signaled readiness. As Arkal left for the harbor, his baby cried, contrasting his calm demeanor. The captain awaited a prince from Albion and his friend. The crew, including slaves and stalwart men, readied the ship. A group of excited young men approached, including a towering fair prince and a dark, elegant companion.

"""I hope I can help you,"" said the prince, ""even though I don't know much about seamanship beyond what I learned on my journey here six years ago.

"Dromas chuckled, ""I don't know about that. Your grandmother is quite the adventurer, much like me. I could probably convince her to sail to the Cassiterides if I wanted to. I can easily appeal to her emotions, but her intellect is a different story. She doesn't value intellect much, she sees it as a gateway to emotions. I once discussed the future of cats with her, and instead of taking it seriously, she laughed and teased me. But let's talk about your family. I can vividly describe the beauty of your homeland, the grandeur of your father's palace, the warmth of your mother, and the stunning beauty of your sister. She must be tall like you, right? Oh, maybe not as tall, but with a gentle, feminine charm."" The farewell was brief, and as the vessel set sail, a storm threatened their journey. Captain Arkal's quick thinking saved them, repairing the torn sail. The sea was treacherous with pirates, and soon they encountered a galley with armed men. Bladud was handed a sword, a family heirloom, sturdy and powerful, as they prepared for a potential confrontation."|['1.

As Captain Arkal spoke, his stern expression softened into a friendly smile, causing Prince Bladud to chuckle. The captain then explained his plan in hushed tones as they approached the pirate ship. He instructed Bladud to sneak to the bow, showing only his head above the bulwarks, armed with his sword, javelin, and shield. The crew concealed their weapons and lowered the sail to appear as intimidated traders. Just as the pirates prepared to board, Arkal gave a signal. The _Penelope_ surged forward, catching the pirates off guard. Bladud swiftly hurled his javelin, striking down the pirate chief. The _Penelope_ rammed the pirate ship, causing it to sink. Despite a brief retaliation, the pirates met their end in the sea. Captain Arkal praised the successful encounter, wishing all sea-robbers could be defeated as decisively.|"[""1.

"Four men lifted him up, revealing Maikar, a small seaman, in a semi-conscious state underneath. As they moved Bladud aft, Maikar began gasping and sneezing. ""Not quite,"" Maikar sighed, struggling to breathe. ""I've never been so close to being squashed flat. Squeeze me the other way to give me some room to breathe."" The captain tended to Bladud's wound as the mate remarked on his javelin throw. The captain teased the mate about doubting Maikar's resilience. The prince chose to rest, boasting of his thick head and solid brain. The crew shared stories of the sea serpent, enjoying the calm weather after a rough start to their voyage.

"""Yes, we have!"" exclaimed one person excitedly; ""My father used to tell me about it when I was a little boy. He never saw it himself, but he had heard stories from sailors who had been to the Tin Isles and Albion. They described it as having a bull's head, horns, a long body covered in scales, and an ass's tail at the end."" Another person chimed in, ""I met a man who claimed to have seen it on his first voyage as a youth. He described it as a sea serpent with a bull's head and horns, a long body covered in scales, and an ass's tail."" Little Maikar dismissed these descriptions as nonsense, suggesting that they were exaggerated. A skeptical man added, ""I don't believe in sea serpents or the golden fleece. The descriptions are too wild to be true."" Maikar then proposed that there might be more than one sea serpent, arguing that each creature could have a family. The conversation shifted, and the topic of the sea serpent was temporarily forgotten."|"[""1.

"""I am unsure if it's wise to risk so much,"" he stated. ""Besides, our journey is not over yet. It's not worth worrying about the end when we're only at the start."" ""Still,"" Bladud replied, ""thinking about the end from the beginning isn't unreasonable, even if we may never reach it. Many ships set sail never to return."" ""Indeed,"" the captain recalled, ""I've learned this the hard way. Once, I sent a ship like this in search of gold, inspired by tales of Jason and the _Argo_. But she never returned, along with my friend. Since then, I've settled for copper and tin."" As the _Penelope_ gracefully cut through the water, a squall passed, followed by a calm. The crew rowed on, encountering traders and narrowly escaping pirates. Eventually, they reached the southern coast of France, fulfilling the captain's hopes for a successful voyage. At dawn, a change in the weather loomed, signaling potential trouble ahead. Captain Arkal prepared the crew as dark clouds and strong winds approached, ready to face the challenge ahead."|"['1.

The captain of the ship warned everyone to hold on tight as the vessel faced a fierce blast, creating a white squall that flattened the sea. The crew had to manage the sail carefully to survive the storm. The gale intensified, forcing them to reduce the sail further and eventually sail under a bare pole. Despite the challenging conditions, the captain, Captain Arkal, showed his skill and expertise in navigating the ship. The mariners found comfort in having a capable leader during the perilous journey. As the storm raged on, the crew faced dangerous waves and uncertain waters. With the captain's guidance, they managed to anchor the ship and face the challenges ahead with courage and resilience.|"['1.

The ship faced a perilous situation as it approached a sandy bay. Despite the mate's impatience, the captain's calm demeanor and Bladud's serene presence helped soothe the panicked crew. As they cut the cables and hoisted the sail, the vessel raced towards safety but struck the shore violently. Waves engulfed the ship, breaking it apart. Some men swam to safety, while others struggled in the water. Bladud and the captain aided non-swimmers, using planks and oars to reach the shore. The land was a vast wilderness, inhabited by wandering tribes and wild animals. Captain Arkal, Bladud, and a survivor worked together to rescue their comrades.

The group embarked on a challenging journey, expecting to find signs of life along the coast but were met with desolation. Despite their disappointment, they pressed on, knowing the current would lead them to the wreckage. After a thorough search, they discovered a plank wedged in a rock crevice. With resourcefulness, they kindled a fire for warmth and cooked dried meat found by chance. As night fell, they rested on a cliff ledge, shielded from nocturnal creatures. The calm weather hinted at a better tomorrow, and they drifted into a peaceful slumber, their resilience and adaptability guiding them through the unknown.|"[""1.

As the fire dwindled, the wolves' cries ceased, and the night-birds returned to their nests, the camp fell silent except for the sleepers' breaths and the distant waves' echoes. Grateful for surviving, they felt a pang of sadness for their lost crewmates on the _Penelope_. Hope flickered that some might have reached the nearby western shore, though it seemed unlikely. Despite the vast distance and treacherous terrain back home, they set out along the coast, hoping for a miracle. The Phoenician captain suggested seeking the Isles of the Cassiterides to the west, while Bladud and Maikar had differing opinions on the islands' location. They decided to compromise and head towards a middle ground. Determined to survive, they began crafting bows and arrows for hunting. Each man clutched his weapon, ready to face the challenges ahead.|"[""1.

The prince led the party to craft sturdy bows with feathered arrows and flint tips. Bowstrings were woven from tree roots. When a fawn appeared, Bladud strung a bow, but Maikar hesitated. They hunted the fawn for food, drying it for their journey. Bladud suggested javelins for defense, and they readied their weapons. Bladud played a prank on the snoring captain, tossing a bird at him. They started a fire and cooked the birds. Bladud's hunger was evident, urging Maikar to hasten. The group prepared for the journey, knowing they might face danger.

Three friends prepared a meal in the wilderness by roasting birds over a fire. Despite the meat being underdone, they feasted and readied themselves for a journey through the unknown. Guided by the stars, they traversed varied terrain, encountering timid wild animals. As they moved forward, a discussion about navigating by the stars arose, revealing the seaman's knowledge. Soon, they encountered a large boar, requiring a strategic approach to take it down. The friends coordinated their attack, aiming carefully at the boar's side with arrows before switching to javelins.

Bladud, with a whispered command, aimed his arrow just behind the wild boar's fore-leg. His companions followed suit, but Maikar's bow snapped loudly. The forest echoed with the boar's deafening shrieks as it charged towards them. Bladud's arrow hit the boar between the eyes but got stuck. The captain's arrow missed, and Maikar's javelin went astray. The boar focused on Maikar, who bravely prepared for the attack. As the boar lunged, Maikar's agility saved him from its tusks. However, he fell, leaving him vulnerable. The captain acted quickly, thrusting his javelin into the boar's side but to no avail. Bladud then intervened, delivering a mighty blow with his sword that ended the boar's rampage. The prince stood, solemnly witnessing the aftermath of their intense battle.|"[""1.

Equipped with materials to make shields, the group decided to set up camp for a day. The rough terrain ahead required better footwear than their sea-worn shoes. They chose a hilltop campsite with a view but also concealed themselves from potential natives. With a picturesque landscape around them, they spent two days crafting what they needed. Captain Arkal demonstrated making sandals from boar-hide, a simple yet practical solution for their journey. While working, they noticed a young savage observing them.

In all the changes, the enormous size and kind appearance of Bladud helped to calm uncertain feelings, attract friends, and frighten enemies. It's strange how a combination of immense strength with a gentle face can intimidate even the fiercest. Perhaps only strong, angry men can truly understand each other. When faced with strength combined with tenderness, they are confused, which can unnerve even the bravest. Bladud's face was well-liked by many, but his sudden bursts of anger were known to strike fear in others. Little Maikar, brave as a lion, almost lost his life once, mesmerized by Bladud's ferocity.

Competitors, few with professional skills, wore light attire. Bladud, as Omicron, joined a race. He matched Gunrig's pace, causing a stir among spectators.

Bladud swiftly reacted to the robbers' attack, hurling his club at one and sending him sprawling. The other two bandits fled in fear. Bladud then made a deal with the fallen robbers, warning them never to return to the area. After ensuring they left, he found the robbers regaining consciousness.

The boy sat by the fire all day, fetching water for the sick prince who groaned restlessly at night. The lad, Cormac, defied orders to care for the prince, who was delirious for days. The prince, Bladud, recovered from his delirium due to his healthy lifestyle, except for the leprosy. Cormac nursed him, and Bladud warned him of the contagious disease. Despite the risk, Cormac continued to care for the prince. Bladud, realizing it wasn't a dream, watched Cormac's graceful movements. Cormac reassured Bladud, offering him berries mixed with water.

After recovering from a fever, Bladud regained his strength and explored the woods with his loyal dog, Brownie, and friend Cormac. The prince's health improved as he enjoyed the beautiful river and fresh air. One day, he noticed a skin disease on his dog, similar to what afflicted some pigs. Cormac mentioned that the pigs bathing in hot waters seemed to recover. Intrigued, Bladud visited the hot springs with his dog and found relief in the cooler waters. After a failed attempt at hunting, he successfully shot a bird for dinner. That night, thoughts of the hot springs kept him awake. The next day, he visited the springs again, where his pigs retreated upon seeing him. Bladud and Brownie bathed in the cooler waters, enjoying the experience before returning home to a surprised Cormac.|['1.

From that day on, the prince's health started to improve. The spot on his arm began to shrink and look healthier. Brownie, too, was getting better, and Cormac showed no signs of the illness. Despite the progress, they kept their distance as a precaution. The prince noticed that the healthier he got, the more the lad avoided him. A tall old man with a long white beard visited and shared his story. He mentioned hiding the prince's beloved Branwen from Gunrig. When Gadarn, Branwen's father, found out she was missing, he was furious. The old man led Gadarn and his men to find her, but she had already left.

Cormac revealed to Bladud his desire to return home, a wish he had hinted at before.

The young boy laughed and warned the old man not to ask questions. He urgently mentioned a suspicious situation involving robbers, an old mother, and a bad son. The boy quickly changed the subject, emphasizing the need for secrecy and making the old man promise not to reveal anything about him. The prince praised the boy's care during his illness and diverted the conversation to inquire about the boy's interactions with the hunter of the Swamp. Meanwhile, Cormac rushed to Gadarn's camp and was interrogated by the sentinels. Gadarn, a powerful chief, was visibly distressed, shedding rare tears. The boy, eager to share important news with his father, reminisced about their past and discussed their upcoming journey to find his missing daughter.

A group of soldiers marched out of the camp, led by Cormac on a pony. Meanwhile, Bladud and Beniah talked about various topics, including religion. They both worried about Cormac's safety. Bladud expressed his determination to rescue Cormac if needed. The prince even mentioned challenging Gadarn to a fight for Cormac's freedom. Beniah shared his concern for a missing girl and offered to help search. The chief decided to split the forces into three groups to find both Cormac and the girl.

Beniah, feeling exasperated, expressed uncertainty about the interest of princes and chiefs in finding the missing lad and lass. He suggested that since the two were lost at the same time and place, they might be found together. Just then, an officer approached them and directed one to lead a marching band while taking the other to the chief's force. The group led by Gadarn inspected various locations meticulously but found no trace of the missing individuals. They planned to widen their search the next day. As they returned to camp, Gadarn made a slight noise, catching Beniah's attention. The chief, however, remained focused on camp activities. Later, Branwen and the escort reached Beniah's hut, deciding to stay there for the night as it was too late to reach King Hudibras' town. The lieutenant and his men, respecting Cormac's authority, agreed to stay. The evening passed uneventfully until a mysterious old woman emerged from the hut, startling the officers. The woman conveyed Cormac's message to let him rest in the morning, leaving the officers uneasy and awake throughout the night, discussing witches and the strange events unfolding.

A quick search showed the boy was missing. A thorough check confirmed no one was around. They couldn't find the cave but peered into the dark abyss, pondering if Cormac met a grim fate. The looming issue: how to explain this to King Hudibras? Would he believe them? Unlikely. And Gadarn? He might, but his anger was a risk. The only option seemed to flee into the woods.

In an old land called Albion, a powerful war-party led by the outlaw Addedomar gathered in a secluded hollow. This band of nearly four hundred warriors aimed to conquer lands through theft, disguised as noble conquest. With little law in the land, they sought to raid territories and attack scattered detachments. Upon receiving news that men were searching for someone in the valley, Addedomar altered his plans to strike a blow. Scouts reported the presence of King Hudibras' men and Gadarn's force, both searching for their daughters. Addedomar saw an opportunity for a grand victory by capturing the daughters and Hudibras' son. The outlaw's ambition soared as he plotted to gain multiple wives through these conquests.|"['1.

While the leader of the thieves spoke with his scouts, two men, Arkal and Maikar, were exploring the forest. Little did they know they would soon cross paths with a bear that would change their fate. Engrossed in their adventure, the sailors were unaware of the pivotal role they were about to play in history. Maikar expressed his desire to bring back a wolf skin for his beloved, while Arkal supported his friend's romantic gesture. As they ventured deeper, they encountered a massive brown bear. Startled, the men reacted quickly, firing arrows at the bear. Although their first attempts were not fatal, they managed to wound the bear.

The name squirrel was fitting for Maikar, who moved even faster than the agile creature. He danced around the scout, delivering quick blows. The scout fought bravely, raining blows in all directions. Maikar narrowly avoided harm, and after a fierce battle, both combatants were exhausted. They paused, leaning on their staves, catching their breath. Suddenly, they heard a voice from above. Arrows were aimed in that direction, revealing a surprise: Gadarn was searching for his lost daughter, and Bladud was looking for a youth named Cormac. Gunrig was taken aback by the news.

Bladud felt a mix of fear and determination as he faced the notorious rascal, Addedomar, and his band of chiefs in the Hot Swamp region. The council of war convened, with plans to outsmart the enemy. The commander-in-chief proposed a strategic attack: luring the foes down a slope to a flat battlefield near the Swamp, then driving them into the treacherous waters. Dromas suggested a divided ambush to sow confusion among Addedomar's men. Gadarn endorsed the plan, assigning different bands to strategic positions.

Gadarn was wise. The robber chief rose early that day, leading his silent army through the forest. Birds barely stirred as they passed, giving only a sleepy glance. Addedomar, unfamiliar with the terrain, faced minor obstacles, delaying his approach to Gadarn's camp. Rushing to avoid ruin, he bypassed caution and headed straight for the enemy. Scouts had pinpointed the camp's location for him, ensuring a surprise attack. As Addedomar positioned his men for the final assault, Gunrig's ambush lay nearby, ready but under strict orders to hold back. On the other side, Captain Arkal's contingent waited, unaware of the unfolding events. The tension mounted as they readied to act upon the signal, eager to join the fray.

The robbers, closely pursued by Gadarn's and Gunrig's bands, found themselves cornered by Bladud's group. Panic ensued as they dashed into a swamp, the water initially warm but turning scalding near the springs. Some sought relief, while others suffered in the heat. Chaos erupted as Bladud's pigs added to the commotion. Gadarn's decision to retrieve weapons was thwarted as the robbers swiftly crossed the swamp. They swam across a river, disappearing into the woods. The battle, though fierce, ended with the robbers escaping. Bladud's healing skills were sought, impressing even the wounded. Gunrig's condition deteriorated, prompting his return home with an escort. Plans were made to inform the king and seek Prince Bladud, leaving many questions unanswered.|"['1.
