"Only time could heal it, and it proceeded to its end to the sorrow, entertainment, or enlightenment of the spectators, as its victims engaged in all sorts of odd behaviors in their frenzy.

As they sailed along the beautiful Rhine, their interest and excitement grew. Amy, dissatisfied with the guide-books, urged her uncle to share the legends of the ruins, rocks, and rivers they passed. Hoffman narrated so well that he spent an hour describing dramatic histories and legends. At lunch, the major was delighted to find his favorite dishes without needing a dictionary.

"Helen inspected the ring, finding it far more precious than the small pearl one it replaced. The ring had two delicate hands made of the finest gold clasping a brilliant diamond.

The window was open, and she was watching the lake when she heard a heavy sigh. In the starlight, she saw a man's figure among the shrubs below, looking forlorn. Helen felt sorry for him, thinking of his wife and child left alone. As Amy chattered about the place, Helen couldn't sleep, haunted by the lonely figure.

I had a strange feeling that something was amiss and decided to observe closely. The feeling intensified until today when I made an amusing discovery. While going through uncle's belongings brought by the laundress this afternoon, I found a collar that did not belong to him. It had the initials 'S.P.' engraved on it, sparking my curiosity. Upon inquiring, the laundress mentioned it belonged to Monsieur Pologne. Later, little Roserl appeared in tears, revealing a prayer book she had taken from the Pole's room. It had the same coat-of-arms as a glove and handkerchief. This led me to examine his hands closely tonight, noticing peculiarities matching those on the glove. I suspect he is involved in some mischievous activities, possibly political plotting, which may explain the changes in uncle's behavior.

My observation isn't as I hoped. I overlook the business district and witness various activities. It's my duty to observe the businessmen, and sometimes I'm truly disappointed. During the war, they were commendable, sacrificing time, money, and even their own kin, and I felt proud. However, many have regressed to their old ways. It seems like their motto now is 'Every man for himself, and the devil takes the hindmost.' Deceit, dishonesty, and corruption are prevalent. There's a lack of integrity in the business world, turning it into a game of chance where luck triumphs over hard work. In the past, people built secure fortunes, enjoyed them, and left behind a good legacy. Nowadays, it's all about money, with health, happiness, and honor being sacrificed in the pursuit of wealth. Dishonest practices lead to grand failures, affecting many, yet the cunning manage to save enough to retire comfortably.

Despite my criticisms, I cherish my children, whom I affectionately refer to as such, for not all are perfect. Many are not swayed by wealth to neglect their duties or harden their hearts. They generously share their abundance, show compassion to the less fortunate, console the afflicted, and bring honor to our city both near and far. They face their own challenges, losses, and sorrows, just like those less fortunate; life isn't always easy for them. Recently, they have been under the tutelage of a warm, talented, and beloved teacher who imparts lessons of kindness, goodwill, and joy through tears and smiles.
