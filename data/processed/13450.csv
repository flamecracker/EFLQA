Miss Campbell expressed her gratitude to O'Haru, the housekeeper, for her dedication, but O'Haru seemed more focused on observing the room and its occupants. While the guests were being assisted with their rain gear, Mme. Ito took care of their hats. Nancy blushed at the attention from the handsome and poised young Japanese man. Suddenly, O'Haru knelt before little Kenkyo, offering a colorful toy before leaving the house.

"""A samurai was a soldier,"" he explained. ""He was brave and unafraid of death or pain. He carried two swords, a long one for fighting and a short one for defense. The sword symbolized the samurai spirit, and he took pride in keeping it sharp and bright.""

Reginald asked, ""Aren't some descendants of samurai against foreigners coming to Japan and bringing new ideas? Has that feeling disappeared?""

Yoritomo replied, ""Samurai defended Japan from foreigners. No descendant would let foreigners learn their country's secrets. It's not fanaticism, it's patriotism. They protect their country's honor.

"After breakfast, Billie hurried to the mysterious back area of the house. Behind a hedge of althea bushes, she discovered a kitchen garden and a chicken yard. In a charming building used as a carriage house named the ""Comet,"" Mr. Campbell had readied the car for a drive. Billie started the car and, with Komatsu beside her, set off on a modern picnic called _hanami_, enjoying the city's beauty. Cherry blossom trees lined the streets, with Mount Fuji visible in the distance. The group felt the thrill of the road, eager to explore. They decided to head to Arakawa Ridge, passing pedestrians and rickshaws. The journey led them to a roadside tea house for lunch, where a stunning azalea bush adorned the garden, adding a touch of magic to their adventure."|['1.

The ear was abandoned in a pine grove near the house, and following Komatsu aboard a rocky path they soon found themselves in this delightful little garden. An old man and his wife, a very aged couple, greeted them with gentle expressions that nearly brought Miss Campbell to tears. Miss Campbell, with a strained voice, instructed the girls not to laugh and urged them to admire the beautiful garden. Laughter filled the air as Miss Campbell struggled to compose herself. Billie, recalling a lesson from her father, wrapped money as a gift for tea and handed it to the maid with a note. The proprietor graciously accepted the gift with thanks. Each guest received a fan as a parting gift, a customary practice in Japan. As they left, the old woman clung to her husband, fearful of the car's vibrations. The group then arrived at the stunning Arakawa Ridge, lined with blooming cherry trees, where they encountered a lively festival with colorful kimonos, music, and dancing. Billie's mistake of driving through the crowded road led to a startling incident where a child was injured.

"In Japan, children are cherished, and harming them is deeply frowned upon. Miss Campbell, trying to calm a tense situation, faced a mob with a bottle of smelling salts. She reassured the mother that her child was unharmed, while Billie, the young protagonist, spotted a group of menacing young men approaching. Despite the danger, Miss Campbell remained focused on the child's well-being.

In a gentle, cultured tone that carried far despite its softness, she addressed the crowd, gradually causing them to disperse. The group of fierce young men stowed away their weapons and blended into the crowd. The young boy, the source of the commotion, now stood before Miss Campbell, blinking in astonishment. The scene was etched vividly in their memories. Miss Campbell generously gave the boy's mother some money from her purse, not bothering with exact calculations, pouring all the coins into her hand. The mother's face lit up with joy, bowing deeply in gratitude. Billie expressed immense thanks, acknowledging that Miss Campbell not only saved the car but potentially them too. Miss Campbell reassured them that the group, though fervent in their beliefs, would not have harmed them, likening them to children.

In the bustling streets of Tokyo, Billie and her friends strolled under blooming trees until they reached a gate leading to Mme. Fontaine's enchanting home. The house was a blend of East and West, with European furnishings, Japanese prints, and teakwood cabinets holding exquisite treasures. The drawing-room on the second floor was a masterpiece of artistry, adorned with deep chairs, Oriental rugs, and a grand piano. Despite their desire to linger, Miss Campbell, in her usual conventional manner, limited their visit to twenty-five minutes. As they left, Mary noticed two splendid swords near the door, hinting at further adventures. Though Miss Campbell was hesitant about Mme.

Yoritomo acted as an interpreter for his mother, aunt, and sister, O'Kami San. The Japanese ladies arrived in jinrikshas, bowing and smiling graciously. Tea was served in the garden by the household maids. O'Kami San, dressed in a pink robe with cherry blossom embroidery, impressed the girls with her elaborate attire.

At the shrine of the Compassionate God, a girl laid down a bunch of wild roses as an offering, her tears evident.

Miss Campbell decided it was time to gather everyone inside the house. She escorted Mme. Ito up the path and instructed the others to follow.

The house was transformed with decorations for the celebration, including large paper carp symbolizing courage and perseverance. Lanterns lit up the garden, and the girls, dressed in their best, added to the festive atmosphere.

Billie was startled by a gunshot and grabbed her father's pistol, which led her into a dark room where she encountered someone else. Terrified, she fumbled towards the door with the pistol, only to be grabbed and thrown to the ground. A shot rang out, followed by silence. When she regained consciousness, she found herself in the library, being tended to by her family. Her father reassured her that she hadn't killed anyone but had wounded the intruder.

The following morning, Mr. Campbell hired a new night watchman. His task was to patrol the house, making hourly rounds through the halls and living areas, with breaks in the library. O'Haru seemed sadly understanding. While Onoye was on the payroll, her mother would cover her duties when she wasn't actively working. The Japanese belief is that as long as the work is done well, the person doing it is inconsequential. Despite Onoye's absence, the household ran smoothly. Miss Campbell felt Onoye should be visible if she was being paid. The other maids amusedly awaited Onoye's appearance. A series of maids entered, causing giggles.

Mary and Billie found themselves in a dark and peaceful place, contemplating the fear their absence might bring to their loved ones. As the wind picked up and thirst crept in, they decided to descend the mountain. A mysterious light approached, followed by a blinding flash of lightning and thunder that rocked the world. Seeking shelter, they stumbled upon a small temple, finding refuge from the raging storm.

Billie and Nancy, along with their friends, were enchanted by a visit from a Japanese gentleman in elaborate attire. Billie found the scene so whimsical that she compared it to living on a Japanese fan. Mary, more versed in English, explained the Japanese use of synonyms.
