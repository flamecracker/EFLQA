He left me alone for long periods, bringing provisions and money to the shack. He stored cash under a board, checking it daily but never counting. He grew less cautious as my leg healed, leaving me locked up for days, fearing discovery. Once, in a panic, he mentioned being seen and hid from pursuers.
