During the summer holidays, Ingred and her family were enjoying a break at a farm near the seaside. Her father and brothers had recently returned from military service, and the whole family was finally reunited. The days spent by the sea felt like a peaceful pause between the end of the war and the uncertain future. Ingred cherished these moments with her loved ones and the beautiful scenery around them.

"Ingred was thoughtful during the ride back in the sidecar that evening, while Hereward, perched on the luggage-carrier, kept the mood light with his jokes. She pondered deeply on certain problems that she could no longer ignore. To understand her concerns, we must look back at her family's history. Mr. Saxon, an architect, built a stunning house in Grovebury and generously hosted gatherings for friends and family. When war erupted, he volunteered for duty, and the family turned ""Rotherwood"" into a Red Cross Hospital. As the boys enlisted in the army, Mrs. Saxon devoted herself to nursing at the hospital. With the war's end, the hospital closed, and the Saxons awaited the return of Mr. Saxon and their sons. The house required refurbishment after its hospital days, and the family eagerly anticipated their reunion."|"['1.

"The Saxons were a close-knit family, proud of their English heritage evident in their blue eyes, fair skin, and flaxen hair. Egbert and Athelstane were tall young men, while Hereward, only thirteen, was already taller than his older sister, Quenrede. Quenrede, who preferred her full name over the nickname ""Queenie,"" had just finished school. She longed for adventure, feeling she had missed out on wartime opportunities. Ingred, the second youngest at fifteen, felt overshadowed by Quenrede's beauty and success in school plays. Despite her plain appearance, Ingred had depth in her eyes and long brown hair. The family's financial struggles due to the war made it impossible to return to their grand home, Rotherwood. Ingred's mother explained the situation, emphasizing the need for financial caution during these challenging times."|"[""1.

"At the bungalow that Daddy constructed on the moors, we were fortunate that the tenant was leaving, and we hadn't arranged it for anyone else. Given the current situation, it will be perfect for us. Athelstane will begin his studies at the medical school in Birkshaw, riding over daily on his motor-bicycle. Although we had hoped to send him to study in London, that plan, like many others, has gone awry. ""Hereward can handle it fine, but I'll make arrangements for you to stay at the new hostel on weekends. Don't cry, dear,"" Ingred comforted, wiping away a tear. ""We have much to be grateful for. As long as we have each other, we have the most precious thing in life. Let's stick together as a family and support one another. Cheer up!"" The Girls' College at Grovebury, led by the capable head-mistress, Miss Burd, had gained a good reputation in the area. The governors, realizing the need for more space, built a new school near the Abbey. However, the outbreak of war led to the building being used as a recruitment office until after the Armistice.

Nora excitedly informed her friend about the changes at school. Some familiar faces were missing from their class, but a new teacher had joined. Nora admired Miss Strong, but her friend preferred a fresh start with a new teacher.

After Sir James had taken a seat, the Mayor and others gave brief speeches. Once the applause quieted, the piano played, and the school sang the Empire Song and the National Anthem. Visitors then left for tea and cakes in Miss Burd's study. The whole event lasted an hour, finishing before four o'clock. The girls orderly left the lecture-hall to receive textbooks and desks in their new form-rooms. After the bell rang, they headed to the playground and cloak-rooms before going home. Ingred, with a stack of books, descended slowly. She hesitated to face her classmates and delayed in Miss Strong's room. In the cloak-room, Francie greeted her, asking about Rotherwood. Ingred, feeling proud, responded sharply, revealing her family's change in circumstances. Despite her rudeness, she struggled with the reality of her situation and the school's perception of her.|"['1.

Verity chose not to respond, avoiding a potential argument with Beatrice on the first day of the new term due to past disagreements.

Ingred left the college on a sunny Friday afternoon feeling excited and relieved to be heading home. She took a tram to the Waterstoke terminus and then changed to a light electric railway to reach Wynch-on-the-Wold, a suburb of Grovebury. The journey was picturesque, passing by hills, rivers, and moorlands. Wynchcote, a modern bungalow where the Saxons had settled, offered a beautiful view of the gorge and the river. The bungalow was strategically located, close enough to Grovebury for Mr. Saxon to commute to work but far enough to escape social pressures. The house had a well-thought-out design and advantages like a stunning view and a bracing atmosphere.

Mr. Hardcastle, a retired man living with a housekeeper, surprised the Saxons by erecting a tall wooden barrier between their gardens instead of chaining the dog.

She started lessons with Dr. Linton, a renowned music master at Grovebury. Dr. Linton, an organist and composer, was known for his anthems and cantatas. Despite his busy schedule, he agreed to teach Ingred after she turned fifteen. Nervous but determined, Ingred played a Beethoven piece for him, making a few mistakes. Dr. Linton saw potential in her and decided to work on her technique. He promised progress if she focused on simpler studies for now, saving the complex pieces for later. Ingred left the lesson feeling encouraged and eager to improve her piano skills under Dr. Linton's guidance.|"[""1.

Dr. Linton, despite his abrupt manner, showed interest in students with artistic talent. He believed pupils were divided into two categories: those with musical ability and those without. While he could help the latter improve technically, they would not excel. His favorites, on the other hand, could benefit from his teaching and become outstanding pianists. Fil, not musically inclined, preferred comic opera to cantatas. When Bess, a new student, arrived, Ingred found her pretty and decided to befriend her. Bess shared her interests in hockey, tennis, dancing, and painting. Ingred admired Bess's charm and considered sitting next to her in class. The school welcomed Bess warmly, and Ingred discussed her with classmates the next day.|"['1.

Ingred, pretending to hand out exercise books, quickly left. Her heart was in turmoil. The news of new neighbors at Rotherwood, especially a girl her age in her class, felt like a sudden shock. Ingred was biased against the new girl, Bess, assuming she would be conceited. However, Bess, unaware of any offense, greeted Ingred warmly, only to be met with coldness. The rest of the class welcomed Bess, admiring her modern art supplies. Ingred, feeling left out, stayed silent. Meanwhile, the school introduced the College Council to teach self-government. The girls were excited about the elections and responsibilities it would bring. Despite her initial feelings, Ingred's friend, Verity, comforted her, showing support in the midst of change.|"[""1.

"""When I was in Fourth grade, we never had a chance to use the tennis courts, and it felt impossible to ask the older students for help,"" said Ingred. ""I always thought there should be a way for our voices to be heard.""

""Well, if you get elected, you'll have the opportunity to give your first speech!"" joked Verity. ""Will there be a 'Strangers' Gallery for us to come and listen to you? I wouldn't want to miss the excitement!""

The election was set for Friday afternoon, and an idea emerged from VA, spread throughout the school, and was embraced by the Sixth. It was suggested that each class should celebrate the event. The head girl, Lispeth Scott, proposed to Miss Burd that students could bring thermos flasks, cups, and bags of treats to hold parties in their classrooms.

""It would make the event more special,"" she argued. ""If we just stop for ten minutes after school to vote, it might not be as exciting. But if each class has a festival to choose their warden, it will make the council seem more important. We'd like to stay until around 5:30, if possible, to have some fun.

After gathering supplies and fending off curious classmates, the VA members returned to the classroom for a celebration. The girls pooled their cakes and enjoyed a feast on their desks. Bess brought an impressive contribution, including cheese cakes and meringues. As they indulged in tea and treats, more surprises emerged. Bess revealed a hamper with beautiful grapes from her family's vineyard. Ingred recognized them from her past but couldn't bring herself to eat them. Despite her inner turmoil, the other girls eagerly shared and enjoyed the grapes. Avis then redirected the group to the task at hand: selecting a representative for the School Council.

The girls had a delightful time on an unexpected adventure in the countryside. They strolled, chatting about school, until they reached a bridge with two paths: one well-trodden and the other overgrown. Choosing the latter, they walked along the riverbank until they saw Waverley church across the water. Feeling lost, they spotted a drifting punt and called for help. A kind gentleman ferried them across the river, and despite the muddy mishaps, they were grateful. With the help of their rescuers, they climbed over a fence and found a cinder path, lifting their spirits. Even though they missed a meal invitation, they saw the adventure positively. However, a sudden warning call dashed their hopes, leaving them feeling worse than when they missed their train earlier.|"['1.

During the play, there was a slight hiccup when the courtier, who was supposed to enter at a crucial moment, was delayed. Verity, feeling bored waiting offstage, went to change her costume and misjudged the timing. As the actor playing the scolding role struggled to keep up the act, an awkward silence fell until the peasant husband, despite his rheumatism, hurried to call for the missing performer.

Since the Junior Rainbow League was formed, Dorrie had developed a strong liking for Lispeth, almost to the point of complete infatuation. She stuck to her like a shadow, always by her side, whether it was convenient or embarrassing. Dorrie dashed off like a messenger from Olympus, determined to find string for her idol. String was hard to come by, as most of it had already been used and was closely guarded by its owners. Undeterred, Dorrie, a spirited and resourceful girl, spotted some twine holding up a damaged toy exhibit. She cleverly cut and took it, but her success was short-lived. The trestle collapsed, burying Dorrie under a pile of toys. Despite the chaos, she managed to sneak the twine to Lispeth, unknowingly receiving stolen goods.

At the College, the start of the new term was challenging for everyone, especially those at the Hostel. The workload felt heavier after the holiday break, with tougher homework and limited study hours in the evenings. Some students, like Fil, struggled to complete their assignments, feeling unlucky and frustrated. The weather added to the difficulties, often being rainy during hockey afternoons, disrupting practice sessions. To stay active, the girls engaged in indoor activities like Indian clubs and Morris dancing. During their free hour, they could relax in the garden or gymnasium. One day, Ingred helped a teacher by returning forgotten music to the Abbey, inviting her friend Verity along. They sought permission from Miss Burd before heading out.|['1.

The school was built on land that was once part of the Abbey's grounds. The old buildings where monks and nuns lived were gone, leaving only a few walls. The Abbey's nave was still used as a church, but the chancel and transepts were destroyed. Miss Burd allowed the girls to leave Dr. Linton's music at the church's organ. They explored areas not usually seen by church visitors, like the choir vestry and a dark storage room. Verity was curious about the Nuns' Ambulatory, a high passage for exercise. Ingred noticed a stone gallery added later, called the peep-hole, to prevent theft during services. The girls found the church's hidden areas fascinating but thought the added stone gallery spoiled the Abbey's beauty.|"[""1.

Balancing on a narrow plank pathway, Ingred reached a peep-hole in the wall overlooking the church below. They saw two young people, too engrossed in each other to notice the girls above.

I was the only one with access to Dad's private room. When I told him I had been out, it only made him angrier. None of the clerks saw me leave or come back, so I had no proof. I had actually gone out before Dad and returned after, but he wouldn't believe me. Trying to explain only made things worse. I had treated someone to tea with money from a short story I wrote. Dad was upset, but Mom defended me. I wouldn't even ask Miss Bertrand for help. Dad finally accepted my explanation, and the tension lifted at home. Tea that day was the most peaceful meal we had in a while.|"[""1.

"At first, the conversation was filled with sweet words: ""Darling!"" he called her, and she replied, ""Oh, Donald, don't!"" Ingred, listening nearby, almost giggled at the kiss-like sound. She worried about being late for supper due to the couple's lingering. As the hostel bell rang at eight, she debated sneaking away. Just as she was about to leave, a voice outside interrupted. Once the lovers finally left, Ingred hurried back to the dining room, arriving late. Her roommates later proposed a daring adventure to sneak out at night. With courage from the dimly lit room, they crept downstairs and into the garden. The moonlit garden, once part of a medieval nunnery, had a serene beauty.

It is fascinating how different settings can transform a place. During the day, the bustling streets made it ordinary; yet under the moonlight, it turned into a magical spot. The girls moved quietly, stepping lightly on the grass. A mist rose near the Abbey, resembling a lake in the moon's glow. Every detail seemed altered - the sumach bush looked like a crouching tiger, and the laburnum tassels swayed eerily. As they walked from the sun-dial to the Abbey wall and back, the garden appeared mysterious but not supernatural. Their courage grew until a figure in white approached. Startled, the girls fled, only to realize it was their head-mistress. She scolded them for ghost-hunting and sneaking out, punishing them with no tennis for a week. Despite the penalty, the adventure sparked an idea among Nora, Fil, Ingred, and Verity.|"['1. What effect does the moonlight have on the setting described in the passage?\nA.

"The colorful costumes added a festive touch to the setting of trees and flowers as the sun dipped below the horizon. Chinese lanterns began to illuminate the gathering twilight. A mix of characters from different eras mingled - a Japanese damsel with a Lancashire witch, an Italian peasant with the ""Queen of Sheba."" Amidst the dancing and laughter, Ingred noticed two unfamiliar figures: one in Victorian attire and the other in a shimmering Turkish costume. As the mysterious pair evaded them, Ingred and Verity made it a game to catch them. Finally, they cornered the duo under a lantern's light, only to discover that they were local friends in disguise.

Ingred and Bess bonded over shared interests like tennis, art, nature study, acting, and music. Both were skilled musicians, with Bess excelling at the violin and Ingred at the piano. They dreamed of creating a school musical society with a choir and orchestra. However, their music teacher, Signor Chianti, was leaving, and they hoped for a new enthusiastic instructor who would organize musical activities. Despite their busy schedules, they planned to advocate for more music in school. They admired Dr. Linton's musical talents but felt he was too preoccupied with other commitments to invest time in their musical development. Ingred was particularly inspired by Dr. Linton's accompaniment skills and wished to experience playing with him to feel the orchestra-like effect of his accompaniment.|['1.

Bess had an idea sparked by her friend's remarks but hesitated to share it immediately. She thought of asking Dr. Linton if her friend, Bess Haselford, could play the violin with the organ at the Abbey. Unsure of Dr. Linton's reaction due to his irritable mood, she decided it was worth a try. When she finally mustered the courage to ask, Dr. Linton warmly agreed to let Bess Haselford play with the organ after his pupil's lesson the next day.
