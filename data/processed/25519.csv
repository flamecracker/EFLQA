The unfortunate situation you are currently facing, dear Imps, is a direct result of your mischievous behavior. You are now condemned to be thorny bushes until you repent and commit to being well-behaved Imps. However, there seemed to be a flaw in the Wizard's spell, or perhaps the creatures possessed magic of their own, as the bushes began to move as soon as the words were uttered. Initially, they just waved their branches, but soon they started sliding and even pricked the Wizard with their thorns, causing him to cry out in pain. Ozma and the Wizard were then chased by the transformed bushes, which had turned into pigs. The Wizard, in his confusion, had intended to change them into mice but made a mistake. The pigs, now angry, tripped the Wizard and Ozma multiple times, causing chaos until the doves attacked them. In the end, the Wizard had to use his magic to dry himself and help Ozma, while the pigs and doves created more trouble.|"[""1.

In the Land of Oz, the Wizard used magic to transform mischievous doves into buttons named Imp Olite, Imp Udent, and Imp Ertinent. He planned to sew them on his coat, believing they would turn into silver, gold, and aluminum as the spirits of the Imps repented. Meanwhile, Princess Ozma, the ruler of Oz, watched events unfold through a Magic Picture in her palace. When she saw two lost children in a forest, she called upon Jack Pumpkinhead, a quirky resident of Oz, to help rescue them. Jack, with a pumpkin head and a body made of sticks, was eager to assist.

"""We're going to rescue two babes in the wood,"" was the reply. Then he climbed into the saddle, and the wooden animal pranced out of the stable, through the streets of the Emerald City, and out upon the highway leading to the western forest where the children were lost. Small though he was, the Sawhorse was swift and untiring. By nightfall, they were in the far west and quite close to the forest they sought. They passed the night standing quietly by the roadside. They needed no food, for their wooden bodies never became hungry; nor did they sleep, because they never tired. At daybreak, they continued their journey and soon reached the forest.

Jack now examined the map Ozma had given him and found the right path to take, which the Sawhorse obediently followed. Underneath the trees, all was silent and gloomy, and Jack beguiled the way by whistling gayly as the Sawhorse trotted along. Finally, they reached a place in the very heart of the forest where they came upon the lost boy and girl. But they found the two children bound fast to the trunk of a big tree, at the foot of which they were sitting."|['1.

Two children were in a forest with Jack Pumpkinhead, who had lost his head. They placed Jack's body on a saddle and mounted behind it on a Sawhorse to escape the squirrels. The Sawhorse, carrying all three easily, wandered aimlessly when the paths branched. They found a fruit tree for supper and rested on leaf beds. Ozma, through her Magic Picture, sent the Wizard on the Cowardly Lion to rescue them. The Wizard guided the Sawhorse out of the forest and returned the children. He then carved a new head from a pumpkin for Jack, saving his life. Jack thanked the Wizard and promised to be careful with his new head. The Wizard remarked on Jack's tender thoughts and lack of wisdom. This adventure unfolded in the Land of Oz, where the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman, two unique friends, lived happily together.|"['1.
