Once upon a time, a hardworking girl found herself in possession of a dress made of moonbeams, thanks to the help of a fairy. The king generously adorned the dress with rubies and diamonds, making it so bright that it required smoked glasses to look at it.

As the clock struck twelve, footsteps neared the house. Robbers advanced cautiously, but herdsmen, alert, sprang from behind the hedge and drove them away with their cudgels. Grateful to Bobino for the warning, they offered him a home, but his wanderlust prevailed. Walking all day, he reached a peasant's house at night. Hearing frogs play with a bottle, he knocked on the door. Inside, he learned the peasant's daughter was gravely ill after losing the doctor's medicine. Bobino, understanding animal language, retrieved the bottle from the frogs, saving the girl. The next day, he met two men resting under a tree. Upon hearing sparrows, Bobino predicted one of them would be chosen as the town's ruler.

Once there was a mistreated sheep-dog who decided to run away from his unkind master. Along the road, he met a helpful sparrow who fed him meat and bread. The sparrow warned a careless carter of impending danger, but the carter's actions led to the death of his horses.

Neangir wanted to shake off his gloomy feelings and make plans for the future, so he walked around the city until darkness fell. As he returned home, he found a sparkling gold watch with precious stones. Thinking he could sell it for a good sum, he kept it with his silver watch. Later, to his surprise, the watches slid out of the room and down the stairs, disappearing into the street. Neangir tried to follow but couldn't. The next day, he confronted the merchant who sold him the silver watch, accusing him of deceit. The situation escalated, involving the Cadi and the Bassa. Neangir shared his strange experiences, including being turned into a pot and restored by a turban. The Bassa recognized Neangir as his lost son, confirming the magical events.|['1.

Sumi, the daughter of Rabbi Moizes, pleaded with Izaf and his brothers, Izif and Izouf, to reconsider their dangerous pursuit of the three rings belonging to the daughters of Siroco. The brothers, skilled in magic, were warned by their father to avoid falling for the beauty of the sisters, who were betrothed to the sons of the Bassa of the Sea. Despite the warning, the brothers disguised themselves as merchants to approach Aurora, Argentine, and Zelida. Izaf, influenced by a love elixir given by Sumi, was stopped by a message from her, preventing Zelida from drinking it. Aurora and Argentine vanished when their rings were exchanged for merchandise, leaving only watches behind.

At midnight, the watches with golden and silver keys transform back into their original forms under the care of a woman, the daughter of Moizes. Sumi received the watches, causing anger in the brothers. The watches turned into Aurora and her sister at midnight, unaware of their fate until Sumi's explanation. They sobbed but found solace in Sumi's promise to never abandon them. At one o'clock, they resumed their watch forms. The narrator, feeling a sense of foreboding, left with Izif and Izouf, parting ways to avoid detection. The narrator later encountered a tall slave guarding the son of the Bassa of the Sea, who possessed a talisman. To eliminate a rival for Zelida's affection, the narrator tricked the boy into transforming into a pot and fled with him. The pot disappeared, but the narrator found the brothers, who had lost their talismans in a foolish escapade. They sought Sumi's advice, who suggested selling the silver watch each morning to ensure the daughters of Siroco returned to her every night.|"['1.

The Cadi assured Neangir that it was not his fault for not winding the watch at the right hour. The Cadi promised to have the merchant hand it over to him that evening. As they reached his dwelling, they saw two veiled women with beautiful attire. One of them offered a bag of silk without revealing its contents, hinting at its increasing value each day. Inside the house, they found a lady named Zambac, who was overjoyed to see Neangir, her lost son. Neangir was emotional and knelt at her feet. In another room, they saw two young men, one crying over his ebony hand, and the other collecting coral beads. The Bassa mentioned that one mourned over his hand for three hours daily, and the cause was unknown. When Sumi suggested fetching the Book of Spells for a cure, Neangir was hesitant as he awaited his beloved Argentine's return.

It revealed a curse on his hand that would only be lifted when the last of a cursed race was drowned at sea. The Bassa sought the advice of the wise Sumi to locate the cursed race responsible for his son's plight.

As soon as we regained our composure, we lamented our impending journey to Constantinople that very day. However, Thelamis comforted us by assuring that he and the prince would follow and find a way to communicate with us. After bidding farewell to our parents, we boarded camels with box-like seats. During the journey, a clever disguise allowed the prince to join us in our box. The prince, disguised as a slave-dealer, shared a plan with us. Thelamis had befriended a dervish who agreed to help us escape the caravan. In the dead of night, we escaped with Thelamis's aid and found refuge with the dervish. The dervish then proposed a plan involving talismans owned by two Jews at an inn. Through our cunning, we secured the talismans and left the Jews behind. Encouraged by our success, we embarked for the Isle of Black Marble, where we encountered challenges but found a warm welcome from the locals. Despite the prince's desire to visit the capital, we opted for safety and headed to Thelamis's palace in a vast forest.|"['1.

To my sister and me, who grew up in a small cottage, Thelamis's grand house felt like a magical place. It was made of shiny pink marble that reflected the beauty of the flowers and streams around it. I had a special set of rooms decorated in yellow silk and silver to match my dark hair. We were pampered with new dresses every day and had servants to attend to our needs. Unfortunately, our happiness was short-lived due to Thelamis's jealousy towards my sister. He couldn't bear to see her friendly with the prince, even though he knew my heart belonged to him. Despite daily confrontations and tears, Tezila's distress always softened Thelamis's heart. One day, news of the king falling ill led the prince to leave in haste, promising to return by nightfall. However, when he didn't, tensions rose, leading to a bizarre turn of events involving a magical powder that swapped our heads. Despite the confusion, we decided to keep things as they were rather than risk another transformation. Thelamis offered us two magical pastilles to reverse the change if needed in the future.|"[""1.
