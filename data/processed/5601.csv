One of Jan's earliest memories was of little Miss Amabel from the Grange being held in the windmill's hopper for whooping cough. Jan, a quaint boy with a serious face and eyes like slans, was three to four years old then, adored by his foster mother and siblings. While Mrs. Lake was making dumplings, a nurse with a finely dressed baby visited. The baby, suffering from whooping cough, was smothered in finery. Mrs. Lake, familiar with nursery etiquette, engaged in conversation with the nurse, who mentioned trying various remedies without success. Mrs. Lake shared her husband's family history of being millers and the story was interrupted by the baby's coughing fit. Mrs. Lake comforted the nurse, saying children will get what they're meant to have, reflecting the common belief among her class about disease spread.|"[""1.

The nurse shared remedies she tried on the baby, including ointment and an old miller's tale cure for whooping cough. The miller hesitantly agreed to try the miller's charm by holding the baby in the hopper while the mill was running. Jan, a simple boy, watched attentively and kissed the baby when prompted. The nurse and Mrs. Lake exchanged pleasantries while the children interacted. The miller, nervous but determined, dipped the baby briefly in the hopper.

Mrs. Lake was proud of Jan's good manners, reminiscent of her own childhood training. She pondered why she hadn't raised her own children the same way. Just as soldiers forsake cleanliness after leaving service, some nurses abandon good manners in parenting. Jan enjoyed a genteel playdate, then Abel took over when he returned from school. The windy evening was cozy inside, where Jan cuddled his kitten. Abel watched over them, resembling a guardian angel. Mrs. Lake found Jan asleep, and Abel attentive. Despite George's attempts to bond with Jan, the child remained aloof. Abel and Jan played happily in the mill, sifting flour for fun.

"Jan enthusiastically jumped up, causing the kitten to tumble from his shoulders. He hurried over to Abel, who was crouched near spilled flour, smoothing it on the floor. Slowly, Abel drew the letter A in the flour, observed closely by Jan. Jan clapped her hands and quickly began to trace A's in the flour row after row, moving sideways like a crab. ""B,"" Jan exclaimed, urging Abel to write B's next. Jan effortlessly drew the entire alphabet, but his memory of the letters' names was less reliable.

Mrs. Lake's weak will and unselfish nature had been molded by long habits of yielding and disuse of her judgment. The Cheap Jack, though a knave, knew how to manipulate situations to his advantage, especially when alone with unsuspecting customers. Mrs. Lake, despite knowing his deceit, often fell prey to his tactics, buying things she neither wanted nor needed. The Cheap Jack's cunning ways were evident in his ability to switch from bullying to charming in a heartbeat.

The carters and horses in Wiltshire have a unique way of communicating, but the Cheap Jack had a different approach with his beast. Instead of the usual commands, he used a sharp whistle that the horse understood. With a quiver and a faint prick of its ears, the horse obediently moved forward. The Cheap Jack, like a cat, cautiously surveyed the area before using a softer tone with the miller's man. After the Cheap Jack's visit, Jan, inspired by the Cheap Jack's drawings, urged Abel to make pictures instead of letters on his slate. Abel, following Jan's instructions, drew various things like a man, a miller's thumb, and even a scarecrow.

"Abel and Jan worked together on pictures, with Abel suggesting ideas and Jan drawing them. Jan was particular about not drawing ""Gearge"" on his slate.

One evening in November, after tea, Jan and the yellow kitten vanished. Mrs. Lake searched for Jan everywhere, while Abel scoured the mill with a candlestick, but they were nowhere to be found. The moon shone brightly, casting shadows of the sails on the grass as small clouds drifted across the sky. Mrs. Lake eventually stumbled upon Jan, lying on his face, but unharmed, just weeping. Jan had attempted to draw the moon and passing clouds on his slate but struggled with the changes. Frustrated, he tossed his slate and pencil, with the kitten playing on his unfinished sketch.

Shortly after the recent events, Mrs. Lake had to visit the nearby town for business. Despite rarely venturing out, she made an exception to see her unwell aunt. The miller, her husband, permitted her excursion. Jan, their son, had a keen interest in exploring the town and found it immensely enjoyable. Unlike the Lakes, who usually approached everything with calmness, Jan's excitement was a novelty for his foster mother, leading to a delightful time. On their way to meet a neighbor for a ride home, they encountered a crowd near a church. Mrs. Lake, who led a dull life, found such disruptions intriguing, providing a break from the monotony. Amidst the commotion, a wedding procession caught their attention. Although Mrs. Lake was fixated on the bride's familiar face, she struggled to recall where she had seen her. Eventually, it dawned on her that the bride was the woman who had brought Jan to the mill during a storm.

George felt a mix of satisfaction and resentment towards the Cheap Jack for attracting the attention of a flashy lady. As they strolled through the fair, the lady's charm effortlessly coaxed money from George's pocket. Unbeknownst to him, his other pocket held a small pocket-book with his savings and a letter.

George proudly explained the contest to her, refraining from mentioning his own past participation.

As George left, he urged the Cheap Jack to take his wife home, noting her distress. He mentioned getting a drink to quench his thirst after chasing her around. The Cheap Jack jokingly asked for a drink too, but George declined, insisting the Cheap Jack take his wife home. George appeared as a non-commissioned officer, not overly intellectual, but with striking looks. He had a well-made figure, neatly trimmed nails, and a good imitation of officer accents.

Master Salter was impressed by Jan's talent for drawing pigs and offered him a job as a pig-minder. Jan's mother was initially hesitant, but the windmiller believed it was a good opportunity for Jan. Jan, however, had bigger dreams and desired a blue coat like the shepherd-boys wore. He envisioned the coat with long sleeves that he could fold up in summer and let down in winter. Abel had a similar coat, but it was unsuitable for mill work, so Mrs. Lake gave it to Jan. Jan proudly wore the coat to Master Salter's farm the next day, eager to start his new job.|[]|[]
Jan's predecessor had accurately described the challenging behavior of the pigs he herded. Jan found the thick coat he wore while tending to the pigs too hot for comfort, but his understanding of pig behavior helped him outsmart them. Despite the pigs' playful antics, Jan developed a bond with them. As he matured, Jan's interests shifted from drawing pigs to sketching landscapes. While drawing in the woods, he discovered a newfound appreciation for the beauty of nature. Jan's passion for painting trees grew, and he learned to capture their essence on his slate. The enchanting woods where he tended the pigs became Jan's artistic muse, inspiring him to explore the intricate details of trees and landscapes.|"['1.

Jan enjoyed observing the vibrant colors of autumn in the woods. He noticed leaves of various hues on the ground, matching those on the trees above.

Master Swift, the schoolmaster, advised Jan against pursuing poetry, claiming it wasn't suitable for a working-class person. Instead, he encouraged Jan to focus on science as a path to success. He also warned Jan about the poet Keats, calling him a heathen, and suggested reading poems by Herbert or hymns by Charles Wesley for a more religious influence. Despite the confusion about the schoolmaster's intentions, Jan learned to sing well and joined the church choir, finding solace in the old church's atmosphere. Abel, another choir member, influenced Mrs. Lake to attend church, but her husband, Master Lake, remained skeptical. Jan's fascination with the church's stained window led to daydreams of painting colorful pictures, illustrating his imaginative spirit.|"['1.

"Jan enjoyed learning poetry, especially martial poems by Mrs. Hemans and ""Marmion"" by Sir Walter Scott. He often recited poetry to Abel, imitating Master Swift. While he excelled in writing and drawing, he struggled with basic mechanics and arithmetic. Despite his talent for poetry and art, Jan lacked interest in inventors and natural science. One winter day, he got distracted by sketching on his slate and arrived late to school. When Master Swift broke Jan's slate in response, Jan felt ashamed and wept silently. Later, Master Swift invited Jan to his cottage, expressing a desire to share his life story and wisdom with the young boy.

I would have gone insane if not for the boy. All I could think about was making up for her absence by caring for him. A child teaches a person to be selfless. I used to believe that God must be the ultimate source of selfless love, given how many children He has who are helpless without Him. I believe He showed me how to care for that boy. I dressed him, mended his socks, and did all I could for him. I even saved up to buy him a silver fork and spoon with his name on them. I taught him poetry, just like his father. I dreamed of him growing up to be a gentleman, looking down on me, but I didn't mind. I wanted him to have a better life. I saved every penny for him, hoping he would see the world. But he never left our town, and now he rests beside his mother in the churchyard for over thirty-five years.|['1.

"""Poor lad!"" his master said, giving him a friendly pat. ""You're a good soul, too! Well, Jan, I'm here, you see. It didn't defeat me. I might have lost my way for a bit, but they held the school for me, and I got back to work. I'm resilient, lad, and not easily broken. I've found solace in animals as well. Many of them, like Rufus, found me. Stray puppies, cats with troubles, they all found a home with me. I always had company at mealtimes, which mattered most. People have said, 'Master Swift, how do you continue to teach after losing your own child?' But they're mistaken, Jan: it's made me care for every boy I come across.

Do you think my ambition had faded, lad? It resurfaced, Jan. I realized there might be boys in this dull place who could succeed with the opportunities I'd offer. I've seen nearly seven generations of boys come through this school, but that special one has never arrived. Society isn't to blame. There have been no hidden talents here since I arrived. Many boys with good hearts have passed through, but none with a thirst for the unknown. I've been disappointed over time, and though I've accepted the Lord's will, I've prayed for the chance to guide another man's son to greatness.

The old man talked about fame and fortune, but Jan only thought about how they could give him time and money to pursue his passion for painting without judgment. The white horse had a good life after surviving a dangerous journey. Amabel, a girl who loved the horse, visited him often and even groomed him. Despite objections from her nurse and family, Amabel's affection for the horse remained strong. She was adventurous and once ended up in a wood after climbing a wall. Though she had been scared of a creature named Bogy, her curiosity led her to explore the wood. Her escapades caused concern among her caregivers, but Amabel's free spirit continued to shine.|"[""1.

The elderly Rector was in the midst of his sermon, and Lady Craikshaw had dozed off, when Amabel energetically poked her Sunday hood through the dark curtains and whispered. Jan, holding the old cedar-wood box, felt a surge of excitement. Would the colors inside be as vivid as those in the church window? He imagined the pale faces in the window sharing his joy. Back home, under the mill's shade, he opened the box to find brushes and twelve quality color cakes. They were Ackermann’s, top-notch. Jan, with a strong sense of duty instilled by the schoolmaster, didn't neglect school for his new paints. Rising early, he painted studies of color in the woods on scrap paper and stones. During summer, he sketched more, learning to paint from memory with precision. Jan's interest in painting grew, especially when he proposed a design for a sign-board at Master Linseed’s shop, only to face delays and excuses.

The landlord wanted to annoy Master Linseed but also considered Jan's talent. Jan spent the week between the inn's hay-loft and the woods, painting watercolors. Master Chuter provided paper for his studies. Jan kept his work secret, but Rufus and the schoolmaster found him. The schoolmaster praised Jan's painting and suggested adding a figure. Jan sketched the schoolmaster and added him to the painting, impressing everyone. Jan became famous in the parish, with people admiring his work. However, Jan's fame was overshadowed by a cholera outbreak in the village. Despite his success, many believed that Master Linseed's death was due to Jan's achievements.

The illness spread strangely in the village. It hit one side of the main street, then popped up in distant houses, only to return to the village. The mill was in a good spot, but the living area lacked ventilation and proper sanitation, as pointed out by Master Swift to the miller. The disease started in the village, worrying the schoolmaster for Jan's safety. Despite concerns raised about poor sanitation, the sudden outbreak caused chaos. The hot, still weather worsened the situation. Trades slowed, and Master Lake took over household chores with Jan and Abel. The tragedy weighed heavily on him. Jan, observant and helpful, took on cooking and cleaning duties. As more fell ill, only Abel and Jan remained active. Master Swift's visits brought comfort and aid.

The doctor was challenged with inconsistency, but the intention was not to provide a small amount of money from the fund. Certain necessary things that the affected individuals are unable to do should be assisted. They were compelled to burn their bedding for public safety, so it's fair they receive aid to replace it. Sanitary tasks require funding, and if obtained, it can employ idle individuals. New blankets may motivate women to tidy their homes, improving the village's appearance. The churchyard's beautification and monument's erection are essential for everyone to return to order and respectability. The Rector agreed to support the public appeal. The lawyer, Mr. Ford, received a visitor, a middle-aged gentleman, who questioned the accuracy of the aid provided to Abel Lake, the windmiller, in light of the epidemic's severity.|"['1.

The Cheap Jack aggressively grabbed Jan, and his dog, Rufus, attacked. Tensions rose as Jan tried to protect Rufus from harm. Eventually, with the threat of violence, Jan commanded Rufus to go home. Despite his inner struggle, Jan let Rufus go to safety. Overwhelmed by his loneliness, Jan pleaded with the woman to let him go and tell his guardian, Master Lake, about the situation.
