Currumpaw, a vast cattle range in northern New Mexico, was ruled by a powerful old gray wolf known as Old Lobo or the king. His pack of five wolves, including a giant second in command and a beautiful white female wolf named Blanca, terrorized the valley for years. Despite the cattlemen's efforts to eliminate them, the wolves were elusive, cunning, and selective in their prey, often targeting the finest livestock. Lobo's keen sense of avoiding traps and poisons made him a formidable opponent, with only firearms posing a threat. The wolves' preference for freshly killed heifer meat and disdain for tainted or human-killed animals added to their survival tactics. Despite numerous attempts to eradicate them, Lobo and his band continued to thrive, evading all efforts to bring them down.|"['1.

Once, a cowboy heard the familiar cry of Old Lobo and found the Currumpaw pack cornering a small herd of cattle. Lobo sat on a knoll while Blanca and the others tried to isolate a cow. The cattle formed a protective circle, making it hard for the wolves to attack. Lobo, impatient, charged in, scattering the cattle. He swiftly took down the chosen cow. Despite numerous attempts, no one could harm the cow until Lobo intervened. The wolves devoured the cow, avoiding the poisoned parts. The legend of Lobo grew, and a ranger named Tannerey set out to claim the bounty. However, Lobo outsmarted the ranger and his dogs, leading to their demise.

One night in November, a cunning wolf named Lobo outsmarted the shepherds by attacking the goats that the sheep followed for protection. Lobo caused chaos among the flock, leading to the loss of many sheep. Despite efforts to set traps for Lobo, he proved to be too clever and avoided them by detecting and exposing each trap. Even when a new trap setup was attempted, Lobo's keen senses allowed him to evade the danger. The narrator, recognizing the irregularities in the wolf pack, discovered that a she-wolf named Blanca was aiding Lobo by breaking away from the pack. To outwit the wolves, the narrator devised a plan involving setting traps around a heifer carcass and using a decoy head to lure Lobo into the traps, ultimately leading to his downfall.|"['1.

I thought he would stay in the area until he found her body. I focused on catching him before he left, while he was still reckless. I realized it was a mistake to use Blanca as bait. I set 130 steel traps in the trails leading to the canyon, carefully concealing them. I used Blanca's body to lure him into the traps. After days of waiting, I heard a commotion among the cattle. There, trapped in the iron jaws, was Lobo, the legendary wolf. Despite his struggles, he was helpless. I spared him, capturing him alive. With a stick through his jaws, he surrendered, accepting his fate. The once fierce king was now subdued, ready to be taken back to camp.|"[""1.

In the peaceful mornings, the crows flew high and straight, but in windy weather, they flew low along the ravine for protection. From my windows overlooking the ravine in 1885, I first spotted an old crow. A long-time resident told me that the crow had been flying in the ravine for over twenty years. Silverspot, the crow, stuck to his route despite the changes in the surroundings. Twice daily in March, April, late summer, and fall, he passed by, allowing me to observe his movements and interactions with his fellow crows. The crows displayed remarkable intelligence, with a language and social system akin to humans. One windy day, as the crow approached a high bridge, it noticed me and warned the group of potential danger. The crows adjusted their flight to avoid the perceived threat. The next day, when I pointed a walking stick at them, the crow sensed danger and flew higher. On the third day, carrying a gun, the crow recognized the threat and alerted the group to disperse and fly out of range. Their communication and responses revealed their complex social structure and ability to navigate dangers.|"['1.

The Sugar Loaf hill stands alone in the Don Valley. It is covered with woods that connect with Castle Frank's woods. Between the two hills, there is a pine-tree with a deserted hawk's nest at the top. Every Toronto school-boy knows this nest. One day in May, I saw a crow named Silverspot and his wife. They had an old nest that never fell apart despite its age. Silverspot had a peculiar hobby of collecting shiny objects like pebbles and clam shells.

The crows were on a foraging mission when the alarm was raised - 'A man with a gun!' The sentries alerted the company, and they swiftly flew towards safety behind the trees. Sentry duty is a serious task for some crows who are always on watch, balancing vigilance with foraging. Crows are known for their organized society, but at night, they fear the owl, a formidable predator. The owl's hoot at night strikes fear in the crows, causing them to shiver until morning. In cold weather, this fear can lead to crows losing their eyesight and even their lives. Despite this, crows rally in the morning, seeking revenge on the owl that preys on them.

During the season, Rag spent a lot of time learning the lay of the land and navigating through the bramble and brier mazes. He mastered the routes so well that he could circle the swamp using two different paths without leaving the safety of the briers for more than five hops at a time. However, a new threat emerged when humans introduced a formidable obstacle known as the barbed-wire fence, which posed a danger to many creatures in the area. Despite this new challenge, Molly Cottontail, Rag's mother, fearlessly maneuvered through the barbed wire, using her knowledge and skills to thrive. She passed on her wisdom to Rag, teaching him essential survival techniques like identifying safe food and water sources and communicating through thumping signals. Through playful games and lessons in woodcraft and trail tracking, Rag learned the necessary skills for survival in the wild.|['1.

He was skilled at various tricks like 'tree,' 'dodge,' and 'squat.' He excelled at playing 'log-lump' and 'baulk' with 'wind' and 'back-track.' He was well-versed in 'sand,' 'change-off,' 'fence,' and 'double,' and knew about 'hole-up.' He understood the signs of foes like hawks, owls, and foxes, and learned remedies to thwart them. He was taught to heed warnings, especially from the bluejay. His mother and the bluejay were his early warning systems. He learned the dangers of 'barb-wire' and 'brierbrush.' He discovered that 'hole-up' could be a death trap. The Swamp had two ground-holes, the Sunning Bank and the fern-hole. The Cottontails enjoyed sun-bathing on the Sunning Bank, while the fern-hole was a last retreat. The hollow hickory was another refuge, and the residence of a coon named Lotor. Molly took over Lotor's nest after he was killed raiding the henhouse.|"[""1.

In the Swamp, the bright August sun shone down, casting a warm glow over everything. A small brown swamp-sparrow perched on a long rush in the pond, overlooking patches of water that reflected the blue sky and yellow duck-weed. Behind him, the skunk-cabbage grew vigorously, creating shadows over the swamp tussocks. The sparrow noticed furry creatures under the cabbage leaves, their noses constantly moving. Suddenly, a bluejay's warning alerted Molly and Rag to the approaching danger of Olifant's dog. Molly led the dog into a thorny area, causing him to retreat in pain. Molly then cleared a path, teaching Rag the importance of keeping runways clear.

One warm evening in August, Molly guided Rag through the woods. The white cushion under her tail acted as their beacon, twinkling ahead until she sat on it. They reached the pond, where hylas sang 'sleep, sleep' from the trees, and a bullfrog croaked from a log in the water. Molly dove in, urging Rag to follow. He hesitated but plunged in, discovering he could swim. They climbed onto the log, finding safety. Rag learned to trust his wits over speed to survive the dangers around them. From evading predators like foxes and hawks to outsmarting a hound named Ranger, Rag's adventures taught him valuable lessons in the ways of the wild.|"['1.

Rag, a clever rabbit, knew how to outsmart his predator, the hound Ranger. When chased, Rag led Ranger on a zig-zag path through a brier-patch and over logs to confuse him. Rag's strategy worked, and Ranger struggled to follow the trail. Eventually, Rag managed to outwit Ranger by sitting still on a log until the hound passed by without noticing him. Despite the danger, Rag stayed calm and patient, waiting for the right moment to escape. His quick thinking and bravery saved him from the hound's pursuit. However, Rag faced a new challenge when a bigger rabbit intruded on his territory, triggering feelings of jealousy and the need to defend his home.

Hurt and chased by a bigger rabbit, Rag faced a reign of terror. His usual enemies were nothing compared to this new foe. Molly, a rabbit he cared for, was also in danger. The big buck pursued her relentlessly, making her life miserable. Rag's only escape was to lie low and run when found. The big rabbit's relentless pursuit pushed Rag to the edge. Exhausted and with limited options, Rag decided to make a daring move. He led a hound straight to his enemy's hiding spot, ensuring his mother's safety.

The chase was on, the hound close on their tails. Rag and his mother, expert rabbits, knew all the tricks - 'double,' 'wind,' and 'hole-up.' But this time, there was no time for tricks. The hound's baying grew louder, the chase intense. The brierrose tried to help, but it was no use. Suddenly, the sounds stopped, replaced by screams. Rag shivered, knowing the fate of the captured rabbits. Their home, the Swamp, was under threat from Old Olifant's actions. The wood was being cut, their territory shrinking. Despite the dangers, they persevered, facing perils like the mink and the encroaching threats. As Rag sat under the sun's rays, the smell of cabbage from Olifant's barnyard teased him, but he knew better than to risk another visit so soon.|"['1.

Hence, he made a wise decision. He moved away from the smell of cabbage and had his dinner from a bundle of hay. Later, as night fell, Molly joined him after her meal. The sun had set, leaving the world dark. A strong wind blew, making the weather colder. The Cottontails sought shelter on the south side of the pond. As the night grew colder, a fox approached them. Molly and Rag were alert and ready to flee. Molly ran towards the pond, chased by the fox. Despite the cold and strong wind, Molly swam across the pond, fighting the elements. Exhausted, she succumbed to the freezing water. Her brave effort to escape the fox ended tragically.|"['1.

"In the early days of November in 1882, the Manitoba winter had just begun. I was relaxing in my chair after breakfast, gazing out at the prairie through our shanty window. Suddenly, a large gray animal sprinted into the cowshed, followed closely by a smaller black and white creature.

Startled, I recognized the larger animal as a wolf and grabbed my rifle to help the smaller dog, a collie from our neighbor. As I rushed out, the wolf and the collie darted out of the stable, engaging in a fierce chase over the snow. Despite my attempts to intervene with shots, they continued their intense pursuit.

The collie displayed remarkable courage and strategy, leading the wolf back towards the settlement with each run. After a mile of relentless fighting and running, I finally caught up with them. The collie, with renewed confidence from my presence, swiftly subdued the wolf by gripping its throat until I could end the struggle with a fatal shot.

When Frank was absent, I had to settle for his supposed offspring - the son of his wife. This likely descendant of a renowned father was a chubby ball of black fur resembling a bearcub more than a puppy. He sported tan markings akin to Frank's coat, hinting at future greatness, and a distinctive white ring around his muzzle. After acquiring him, the challenge was to name him. The solution was apparent - the rhyme of 'Franckelyn's dogge' led to the grand naming ceremony, christening him 'little Bingo.' During that winter, Bingo resided with us, growing into a plump, well-intentioned, but mischievous puppy. Despite mishaps, like meddling with the rat trap and misinterpreting the cat's signals, he eventually excelled at herding our yellow cow. Bingo's enthusiasm for this task led to an excess of herding, disrupting the cow's grazing and milk production. Attempts to curb his fervor were futile, resulting in Fred resorting to a comical yet ineffective method involving a brick tied to the cow's tail.

In the vast prairie between our home and Carberry village stood a significant corner-stake, a post marking the farm's boundary. Bingo, our loyal dog, had a peculiar fascination with this post. It turned out to be a meeting point for all the dogs and prairie wolves in the area. Through observations aided by a telescope, I unraveled the mystery behind Bingo's visits to the post. It was a sort of message board for the canine community, where they left traces to communicate with each other. Each dog would check the post to learn who had been there recently, much like humans checking a club register. Bingo's reactions and behaviors at the post conveyed messages about encounters and intentions with other dogs in the region.

Sometimes during the night, the aim was to harm a distant neighbor's dog, but there was no fear of the Bingo breed disappearing despite threats of revenge. One man claimed to have seen a prairie wolf with three young ones resembling the mother but larger and black with a white ring around the muzzle. Late one March day while out with Bingo, a prairie wolf was chased, but there was no fight despite Bingo catching up.

Kennedy's Plain was a prime spot for trapping due to its seclusion. The traps were expertly set, hidden beneath the earth, waiting for unsuspecting prey. One day, while resetting a trap, a careless move led to a dire situation. The trap snapped shut on the trapper's hand, leaving him stuck. As he tried to free himself, another trap clamped down on his other foot. Trapped, with no one aware of his location, the trapper faced the grim reality of being alone in the wilderness.

As I lay there, the sun went down over the spruce swamp. A shorelark sang its evening song nearby. Despite the creeping numbness and chill, I noticed the bird's ear-tufts. Thoughts of a cozy supper at Wright's shanty crossed my mind. My faithful pony waited, unaware of the danger. Night fell slowly, and prairie wolves howled nearby. Helpless, I wondered if they would attack. The wolves approached, but my pony scared them off. Yet, they returned and dragged a fallen comrade away. They circled me, growing bolder. Suddenly, a massive black wolf appeared and saved me. Bingo, my loyal dog, brought the trap-wrench, freeing me.

Old Bing, a loyal dog, lived a wolfish life and met his end seeking help. The disappearance of hens was a mystery until fox-tracks and a barred feather led to the culprit, Reynard. The crows exposed the fox's thievery, aiding in the recovery of a hen. Following the hound into the Erindale woods, a fox was chased off. The hound's baying faded into the night, leaving a peaceful silence broken only by the song of a hidden spring. Ranger's return signaled the proximity of the fox den, where the old foxes tried to divert attention. Scarface, named for a scar from a past injury, was cunning in leading the hunt astray.|"['1.

Last winter, I had an encounter with a clever fox named Scarface. While out shooting after a snowfall, I spotted him in the brushy hollow near the old mill. When he caught sight of me, he pretended not to notice, then circled around behind me, amused by my failed attempt to outsmart him. In the spring, Scarface tricked us again by blending in with the landscape, showing his cunning nature. I later discovered his den cleverly hidden in the pines, a tactic he used to mislead potential threats. One day, I observed Scarface with his family, including four mischievous fox cubs. They played innocently, but their sharp features hinted at their future slyness. Scarface's mother proudly watched over her young, showing a mix of delight, wildness, and cunning, but above all, a mother's love and protection.|"['1.

For many days, I observed the young animals being trained. They quickly learned to react to sounds and seek shelter when afraid. Unlike some animals that show kindness to others, Vixen, the fox, displayed a disturbing form of affection. She would bring live prey to her cubs, allowing them to torment the creatures without causing serious harm. One day, Vixen and her mate decided to teach their cubs about woodchucks using an orchard resident as an example. The woodchuck, known as Chuckie, was cautious and knew how to protect himself. When the foxes tried to catch him, Chuckie cleverly retreated to his den, outsmarting them. Despite the foxes' attempts, Chuckie managed to escape and seek refuge in a thicket. The cubs, excited by the chase, tried to catch him but failed. Eventually, Vixen intervened to end the woodchuck's suffering.|"['1.

"Not far from the den was a hollow with tall grass, where field-mice played. The young foxes' first lesson in hunting was here. Mother Fox showed them how to catch mice by watching her example. She had signals for ""lie still"" and ""do as I do."" One calm evening, she made them wait quietly. When a mouse moved, Vix sprang up, standing tall to see. Mice hide in the grass, so the trick is to spot the shaking grass. Vix caught a mouse, teaching her cubs to do the same. They learned to use the weaknesses of other animals, like the squirrel's curiosity, to hunt.

The young children were learning valuable lessons from their experiences in the woods. They were taught to trust their senses - like the saying 'Never follow what you can't smell' which proved wise when they encountered something unfamiliar. As they explored with their parents, they discovered new animals and learned to recognize scents. One night, their mother exposed them to a strange object that filled them with fear and instinctive hate. Meanwhile, the mystery of the disappearing hens troubled the family. Despite not revealing the den of fox cubs, the narrator faced criticism about their woodcraft skills. To address the issue, the narrator took the hound to track a fox named Scarface. The fox's clever maneuvers and the hound's comical reactions were observed, leading to a dramatic conclusion when the narrator's uncle took matters into his own hands.|"[""1.

Vix, the clever fox, outsmarted her enemies by leading them on a wild chase. When her den was discovered, the hired man tried to dig out her family. Vix, desperate to protect her young, tried to distract everyone. Despite a close call, the little fox cub was saved at the last moment. The cub, with a mix of lamb-like innocence and cunning, was kept alive. Chained in the yard, the cub made attempts to catch the hens but was limited by the chain.

An hour later, the young fox had stopped running around or making noise. I peeked outside and saw the mother lying next to the cub, gnawing at a chain in the moonlight. Meanwhile, the cub, named Tip, was having a warm drink. The mother fled into the woods when I went outside, but I found two mice near the shelter-box, brought by the mother as food for the cub. In the morning, I noticed the chain near Tip's collar was shiny for a short distance. The three baby foxes were lying there, licked clean, with two hens nearby that the mother had killed. The ground showed signs of where the mother had mourned her young. She never returned after realizing they were gone. Tip, now the sole survivor, received all her love. The dogs were set loose to protect the hens, and orders were given to shoot the old fox on sight. The mother tried to dig a hole to free Tip from the chain but failed.

My sympathies shifted towards Vix, the mother fox, as she tried to free her captive young one. Despite multiple attempts, Vix's efforts were in vain. She braved dangers and tried every means to help her little one, but all failed. In a final act of sacrifice, Vix chose to free her young one by leading him to a poisoned bait, knowing it would bring him a swift death rather than a life in captivity. Vix's love for her offspring was strong, but her wisdom and sacrifice were even stronger. Eventually, when the snow covered the ground, it was revealed that Vix was no longer in the woods of Erindale.

Around midday, the Pacer arrived, now alone after his group was captured. The path on the opposite side of the muddy area was rarely used. Old Tom hoped to guide the Stallion by throwing fresh rushes to ensure he took the usual route. Who protects and watches over wild animals? Despite reasons to stick to the usual path, the Pacer chose the other. The suspicious rushes didn't deter him; he calmly drank water. To prevent failure, Bates and Smith swiftly approached the trail behind him. As the Pacer neared the trap, a shot was fired, but the Stallion leaped over the ground and escaped unharmed. Wild Jo was determined to catch the Mustang using the relay chase plan. The Pacer's range was within a sixty-mile triangle, and Antelope Springs was his base. The chase began with horses sent ahead, each man ready at their post. The Pacer arrived alone, circled the Springs cautiously, then led the chase across different terrains. Jo tried to gain ground but struggled. The Stallion managed to elude Jo's efforts and reach Arroyo Alamosa, with Jo following closely, exhausted yet determined.|"['1.

The rider dashed out on a sturdy horse, racing across the rolling plain. The Black Horse, frothy with sweat, showed signs of exhaustion but pressed on relentlessly. A young rider joined the chase, urging his steed to follow. Despite a stumble in a gulch, they continued towards the Carlos Hills. The Pacer abruptly changed course northward, leaving the pursuers behind. Jo, determined to catch up, pushed his mount to its limits under the scorching sun.

Old Turkeytrack had a solitary winter following the loss of his harem, and the wise Turkeytrack knew it. He decided to capture a magnificent stallion using a clever trick. He borrowed his friend's brown mare and set off with hobbles, a spade, a lasso, and a stout post. As he rode, antelope and cattle roamed the land, signaling the arrival of spring. Turkeytrack found a strategic spot, hid in a hole, and set a trap with the lasso and post. The stallion, lured by the mare's call, fell into the trap. Despite the stallion's fierce struggles, Turkeytrack skillfully subdued and captured him. However, a dilemma arose as Turkeytrack needed to brand the stallion, and the branding iron was miles away.|"['1.

Old Tom checked the horse's hooves, finding a loose shoe. He made a fire, heating the shoe to brand the horse with his mark. The Mustang, now marked, was to be taken home. Tom tied the horse's forefeet and began the journey. The Mustang resisted fiercely, but Tom was determined. Despite the horse's struggles and falls, Tom pushed on, leading the exhausted horse towards the ranch. As they neared the canyon, the Mustang made a final desperate attempt to break free. In a last act of defiance, the Mustang leaped off a cliff to its freedom. Wully, a yellow dog, embodies the resilience and survival instincts of mixed breeds over purebreds.

In the hills of the Cheviots, a little yellow sheep-dog named Wully was born. He learned the ways of the sheep under the guidance of an experienced collie and an old shepherd. Wully grew into a bright and capable dog, trusted to guard the flock while his master stayed at the tavern. Despite the shepherd's faults, Wully adored him faithfully. When the sheep were driven to the Yorkshire markets, an incident in South Shields caused a commotion. The sheep scattered through the town, but Wully, at the command of his master, rounded them all up except for one. Determined to fulfill his duty and full of pride, Wully searched the city until a helpful boy pointed out that all the sheep were accounted for.

Wully decided to leave his post at the ferry and follow Dorley to his home in Derbyshire. Dorley was a farmer who owned sheep, and Wully took on the role of guarding the flock with great dedication. Despite the challenging terrain of Monsaldale, where rocky ridges and stone walls made fox-hunting difficult, a cunning fox plagued the area by preying on livestock.

Cuddy, a hunter living near Toronto, led a simple life focused on hunting. He often flouted hunting regulations, shooting partridges out of season. The partridges, now wary of hunters, changed their roosting spot to a hemlock tree to avoid predators like coons and owls as the season changed.|"[""1.

The partridge's ruff, similar to the peacock's train, is its main beauty and pride. A hen's ruff is black with a hint of green, while a cock's is larger, blacker, and glossed with vivid bottle-green. Occasionally, a partridge is born with an extraordinary ruff, larger and intensively colored in coppery red, iridescent with violet, green, and gold. Redruff, a remarkable partridge in the Don Valley, developed a stunning gold and copper ruff. During the November moon of their first year, partridges go crazy, driven by an urge to wander. This behavior prevents inbreeding and is most intense in young partridges. Redruff's family was scattered during this time, and he found himself alone in the Mud Creek Glen. As winter progressed, Redruff faced challenges like scarce food and icy storms but adapted with nature's provisions, such as snow-shoes and icecreepers on his feet.|"['1.

She distracted Cuddy by pretending to be injured to protect her young. Despite her efforts, Cuddy struck her down. Redruff returned to find the tragic scene. He led the surviving chicks away to safety. Redruff raised and trained the chicks, ensuring they thrived despite the challenges. By summer's end, the brood had grown into a fine family of six.

Cuddy always aimed his gun at the red-ruffed cock, Redruff, but the clever bird always found a way to escape behind trees or banks. Redruff lived happily with his family in the Castle Frank woods, where they found plenty of food and shelter among the trees. There was a magnificent pine tree on the east slope where the bluejay and his mate would sing and dance. Redruff loved this pine tree, especially for its base where they could find food like partridge-vine and acorns. Cuddy set a trap for Redruff and his family, but the wise bird managed to warn his mate and escape the danger. Unfortunately, Redruff got caught in a snare set by Cuddy, and despite his struggles, he was left hanging in agony until a merciful owl ended his suffering.|"[""1.
