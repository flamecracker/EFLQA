"Long ago, in a remote land, lived a boy known as the Boy that carries the Ball on his Back. He dwelt with his sister in the wilderness, pondering about the existence of others like them. One day, he encountered an elderly woman who warned him of a treacherous village. She advised him on how to navigate the dangers that awaited him there, emphasizing the importance of invisible bones for protection.

Undeterred, the boy continued his journey until he reached the mysterious village. Following the old woman's guidance, he approached a tree with a suspended lodge, where two deceitful sisters resided. Despite his efforts to reach the lodge, the tree thwarted his attempts. Through perseverance and the use of the invisible bones, the boy finally gained access to the lodge.

Inside, he met the wicked sisters, Azhabee and Negahnabee, and cleverly discerned their powers. By addressing them strategically, he manipulated the tree's movements, ultimately outwitting the sisters and triumphing over the village's dangers."|"['1.

At the request of his cousin, many men went to the fish-fire. There were no signs of a struggle, and every leaf was undisturbed.

Around noon, the group began to gather, and Wassamo had never seen such a diverse assembly before. There were Spirits from all over, dressed in unique and wild outfits. One friendly Spirit caught Wassamo's attention. He learned that this Spirit oversaw a tribe in the North and was warm and cheerful. Shortly after, a Spirit representing a nearby waterfall arrived, followed by another controlling whirlwinds in the area. Then, a gentle Spirit symbolizing a summer breeze that favored young lovers entered. The last to appear was a stern Island Spirit who eyed Wassamo's wife disapprovingly.

Long ago, in a distant land, a poor Indian and his family faced hardship. Despite his struggles, he remained grateful to the Great Spirit. One day, as they decided to leave their country, they encountered a mysterious and terrifying sight. A skull and a headless body seemed to chase them along the shore. Desperate for help, they called out to a stately crane perched on a rock in the rapids. The crane warned them not to touch his head, for he was tender there. Safely guided across the river by the crane, they found refuge and prosperity. Grateful for the crane's aid, the family adopted it as their emblem.
