Imagine this: I, with my strict beliefs and love for order, watching as my roommate casually embroiders on this peaceful Sunday afternoon. Her room is a mess - her bed, chairs, and dressing table look like chaos. Seeing her slippers in the middle of the floor at this hour frustrates me. Living with someone who mixes their belongings with yours can be a challenge. The disorder sometimes drives me to the edge. But I've learned to compromise. Margaret, a fellow student, taught me this. She once dealt with a roommate who liked cheap perfumes, which she despised. Margaret cleverly used mothballs to make a compromise. I tried a similar tactic with E., who kept the light on when I wanted to sleep. By hum a tune repeatedly, I managed to get her to change her ways.

Mama always refers to you as 'my other' boy, and Mary quotes you on every occasion, believing you are almost perfect. When she sees you, she'll be overjoyed, maybe even jump and squeal at the station."" The mention of Mary brought back memories of her joyous expressions. In the year Joyce was away, Mary was often remembered as the eight-year-old, rather than the sixteen-year-old she had become. Phil, used to Mary at the Wigwam, was surprised by her growth. She was taller, almost as tall as Joyce, with longer skirts, but it wasn't her physical changes that struck him. There was a girlish charm, a subtle transformation that intrigued him. Mary's demeanor had shifted, displaying a gentle grace and poise that puzzled Phil. He had envisioned her as strong and rugged, influenced by her desert experiences. However, her newfound gentleness and dignity caught him by surprise. It reminded him of Princess Winsome, a character Mary admired. Mary's shyness towards Phil's teasing highlighted her transformation. As they navigated the bustling streets, Mary's joy and wonder at the snow and city sights were evident, bringing back a sense of childlike abandon."|"[""1.

After a delightful outing at Wanamaker's, Betty surprised Mary with a long-awaited bloodstone ring. Over lunch, they shared the joy of the gift. Later, they prepared to visit Eugenia's for Christmas. On the train, they met a talkative old lady who shared her stories. Mary, lost in thought, reflected on the old lady's tales of Christmas joy with her family. The old lady's excitement about her grandchild's gift brought a smile to Mary's face. As the train journey continued, Mary imagined herself as a grandmother, looking forward to sharing the joy of gifts with her family.

Mary had been having a joyous Christmas, feeling content with her bloodstone ring and soft fur boa. But a conversation with an old lady made her dream of spending even happier Christmases with someone special. As they rode in a sleigh towards a house-party, Mary daydreamed about romantic possibilities. The sound of sleighbells delighted her, and the prospect of a longer drive made her eyes sparkle. Phil, the driver, noticed Mary's happiness and thought she was growing into a pretty girl. Upon arrival at Eugenia's house, they were greeted warmly, and the place was beautifully decorated for Christmas. Eugenia shared that Patricia, a remarkable child, had just fallen asleep, and Eliot, her guardian angel, was with her. Mary felt grateful for the warmth of the welcome and the joy of the holiday season.|"['1.

"As the girls unpacked their suitcases and changed into evening attire, Eugenia stood in the doorway between the rooms, answering questions quickly. Mary, relieved that her white outfit was unwrinkled, split her attention between getting dressed and listening to Eugenia. The baby was named after Stuart's great-aunt Patricia, who had been like a mother to the boys and Elsie. Mary felt it was a way to honor the old lady for her love despite the boys' antics. Father Tremont couldn't join them for Christmas as he was in the south of France with Elsie. Phil approved of the name but planned to get the baby a monkey named Dago. Mary admired the wedding gifts at The Locusts and marveled at the luxurious furnishings. Stuart, the young doctor, returned from visits, showing care and consideration as a host and husband. Phil, known as ""Pat's Pill,"" arrived with Mr. Forbes, bringing joy to Betty, who cherished the memories of their trip to Europe.

"Eugenia looked at the dolls she was counting, then at the toys on the tree. She decided that the little girl should learn to be selfless. This Christmas tree was for her to share with the orphans the next day. Only children's gifts were on the tree, but surprises were left for the adults by a secret Santa. Mary found a stocking with treats and a thimble from Patricia. She also received gloves from Eugenia, a book from ""Cousin Carl,"" and roses from Phil. Mary treasured the roses, feeling special despite knowing Phil loved someone else. She wore a rose to breakfast and to the Christmas service at St. Boniface church. Eugenia suggested the walk through the snow-covered park to the church."|"['1.

Stuart had urgent visits to make, so he couldn't join the others. A message from the Orphanage needed Eugenia's attention, keeping her home to adjust her plans. Only four guests set off across the snowy lawn towards the village. They walked Indian file at first, allowing Phil to make a trail through the snow. It was colder than expected, and Mary fell to the back to shield a rose from the frost. In church, the warm air wilted the rose, and Mary planned to preserve its leaves in a potpourri. During the service, an offering was collected for charity. Mary mistakenly dropped her English shilling instead of a quarter into the plate, causing embarrassment.

Mary found herself in a dilemma after losing a cherished shilling meant for the church collection. She felt self-conscious and anxious about rectifying her mistake without anyone noticing. Phil, her companion, unknowingly provided a solution by mentioning the rector's name, Dudley Eames. Mary decided to call the rector to explain her situation. Nervously, she dialed the number and stumbled through her explanation. The rector kindly directed her to Mr. Charles Oatley, the church treasurer, who handled all collections. Mary learned that Mr. Oatley lived nearby at Oatley Crest and would likely take the money to the bank the next day. Relieved to have a plan, Mary felt grateful for the guidance and prepared to contact Mr. Oatley to retrieve the lost shilling.|"[""1.

Mary hurriedly thanked the person she was talking to and then listened for footsteps, hoping to reach Oatley Crest. Disappointed, a maid answered the call, revealing that the family had gone to dine with the James Oatleys, about twenty miles away, in a touring car. Feeling perplexed and anxious, Mary realized she had forgotten to ask about the bank. Seeing her worried reflection in the mirror, she tried to calm herself. A friend, Stuart, asked her opinion on the offertory, but Mary was distracted by a man at church with multiple chins and a shiny bald head. Stuart joked about the man, revealing his importance at the bank due to his marriage. Mary finally learned the bank's name and planned to visit it the next day.

The girls received a new invitation for a weekend getaway, replacing the one they had to decline. Excitedly waving goodbye from the sleigh, they looked forward to a quick return. Mary quoted a line about feasting and merry-making, reflecting on the constant celebrations since the mock Christmas tree event. Arriving at the flat, they enjoyed a picnic-style supper before venturing into the slums for a unique Christmas night. Betty found writing inspiration, Joyce got ideas for illustrations, and Mary felt a strong urge to help neglected children. Mary also made a discovery near the Mission, planning to visit a bank alone early the next morning. After a simple breakfast, Mary insisted on doing the dishes herself to allow Betty to start writing immediately. As Mary sang happily in the kitchen, the others focused on their tasks, with Joyce curious about Mary's next adventure.|"['1.

There was always something her busy fingers could turn to when tired of household tasks; bead-work and basket-weaving, embroidery, knitting, even strange feats of upholstering, and any repair work that called for a vigorous use of hammer and saw and paint-brush. A girl who could sit by the hour watching ants and spiders and bees, who could quote poems by the yard, who loved to write letters and could lose herself to the world any time in a new book, was not a difficult guest to entertain. She could easily find amusement for herself even in the top flat of a New York apartment house. So Joyce went on with her painting with a care-free mind. Meanwhile Mary was slipping into her travelling suit, hurrying on hat and gloves and furs, and with her heart beating loud at her own daring, boldly stepping out into the strange streets by herself. It was easy to find the corner where they had taken the car the night before. Only one block to the right and then one down towards a certain building whose mammoth sign served her as a landmark. But the night before she had not noticed that the track turned and twisted many times before it reached the corner where they changed for the East Side car, and she had not noticed how long it took to travel the distance. Rigid with anxiety lest she should pass the place she kept a sharp look-out, till she began to fear that she must have already done so, and finally mustered up courage to tell the|"['1.

Mary found herself in the midst of a bustling crowd, feeling lost and unsure of what to do next. As she wandered through the unfamiliar streets, she stumbled upon a group of women admiring discounted hats in a store window. Despite not being interested in hats, Mary found comfort in their presence. Following them to a familiar store, Wanamaker's, where she had recently lunched, Mary felt a sense of relief. The sight of a saleswoman who had helped her select a Christmas present brought back memories of warmth and kindness. When Mary called her sister Joyce for help, Joyce was surprised to hear Mary's voice coming from a distant location.

Mary blushed as she pondered how to evade revealing her secret adventure. She skillfully dodged questions, impressing him with her quick wit. Despite his teasing, she refused to spill the beans. Later, she agreed to cook two dishes of his choice if he kept quiet about her morning escapade. He requested doughnuts and left the second choice to her.

It was fascinating how all his small likes and dislikes flooded back to her as she prepared lunch. He had specific preferences, like wanting his lemon cut in triangles, enjoying cauliflower in mixed pickles but not tiny white onions, and having his fried eggs hard and boiled eggs soft. These details stuck with her because the habits of a regular guest leave an impression on a perceptive child involved in household chores. Mary recalled how others had their unique preferences too, like Holland always using salt and Norman only eating apple-sauce cold. Despite her inexperience, Mary efficiently prepared a delicious meal, impressing everyone with an oyster stew, a delightful chicken-pie, a simple salad, and delectable doughnuts paired with aromatic coffee.

Betty excitedly presented a check to Mary, revealing that Mary's shilling contribution had sparked the idea for a story that would grant Mary a trip to New York. Mary, feeling undeserving, questioned her claim on the story. Betty reassured her, explaining how the story evolved from Mary's initial inspiration.

Betty blushed as Mary shared Jack's admiration for her picture, a departure from typical American girl illustrations. Jack, in his busy days, often glanced at the photograph on his desk, appreciating the sweet seriousness it portrayed. He longed for the companionship he had back home, engaging in activities like golf, tennis, and picnics with girls who exuded a sense of camaraderie he missed. Mary, unaware of the impact of her stories about Betty, filled her letters with praise for her friend. Jack, moved by Mary's success in getting a short story accepted, sent his congratulations. This marked the beginning of a regular correspondence, with Jack faithfully sending letters to Betty every Thursday.

Mary was completely surprised to discover that the celebration was in her honor when she was escorted to the head of the table, where a birthday cake adorned with seventeen green candles awaited her. The heartfelt gestures of her friends touched her deeply, from the sweet acrostic poem to Cornie Dean's touching toast. Despite feeling a bit apprehensive about the challenges presented, Mary embraced the spirit of the festivities. The playful antics that ensued, including attempting daring stunts to prove the worth of their birthstone charms, filled the room with laughter and joy.

I can hardly believe that three whole months have passed since the Christmas holidays. School work was tough at times, but there was always fun mixed in, making time fly by. In New York for five days, time has whizzed by. Miss 'Henry' has made our stay enjoyable. She hosted a studio reception to introduce us to her famous friends. Betty received encouragement from Mrs. LaMotte, a magazine illustrator, who wants to illustrate Betty's next story. It was amazing to see Joyce playing hostess to such a distinguished group. They were friendly and extraordinary in their conversations. I helped serve refreshments and poured tea. Joyce noticed a change in me, saying I had grown up. We went sightseeing, attended matinees, and dined out. Phil took us on a tour in his car, and we're looking forward to visiting Eugenia's.

Promptly at the agreed hour, Phil met them at the hat shop.

Mary paid little attention to his teasing, excited about the beautiful white hat inside the mocked box. She regretted not being able to wear it for him. Joyce and the mirror assured her it was the most flattering hat she owned. During the drive, she thought of him gratefully. At dinner, she wished he was there. The day was enjoyable, yet a longing to see him again crept in, almost like homesickness. Back at the flats, Phil insisted on seeing the contents of the box.

To Madam's surprise, the words of praise did not provide the comfort she wanted. Mary, in tears, expressed her struggles.

Aldebaran often thought of Vesta, the stroke that marred his appearance and strength had taken away his ability to find happiness. It was foretold that the bravest would keep eternal vigil by the hearth. Despite his ancestors' bravery, Aldebaran felt he could not show greater courage in his weakened state. Even if Vesta, out of pity, were to come to share his hearth, his pride prevented him from accepting her sympathy. As days passed, hunger forced him to seek food in the village, where he once hoped to be celebrated as a hero. Instead, he faced rejection due to his disfigured form. A jester, known for lightening others' burdens, approached Aldebaran with concern, offering a glimmer of hope in his despair.|"[""1.

The Jester gazed at Aldebaran's pale face, reflecting the torment he endured. After a comforting meal, the Jester praised Aldebaran's bravery in facing Despair for a day.

The small mining camp of Lone-Rock was nestled high in the hills, making April there different from what Mary had experienced at the Wigwam. Snow patches lingered under the pine trees above the camp, yet the promise of spring filled the air. Mrs. Ware rested in the afternoons, allowing Mary to wander on long walks.

Jack successfully facilitated a trade to Norman's complete satisfaction and engaged in a conversation with Lúpe in Spanish about the mines and workers. It turned out that Lúpe was the son of a miner saved by Jack previously.

Something thrilling occurred recently! The Leverings had a visitor over this afternoon, a grumpy, middle-aged, absent-minded professor from the East. Initially uninterested in us, he became lively when he saw my collection of desert wild-flowers, butterflies, trap-door spiders, and insects. He was amazed by the data I had gathered and my personal observations. The professor, a noted naturalist studying insects and plant life, was impressed by my rare specimens and notes. He plans to buy my collection to aid his research. Additionally, he will employ me to assist with his work, copying notes and gathering new material. This unexpected opportunity will provide me with a chance to earn money and gain valuable experience. My brother, Jack, is returning to work soon, and I am confident that more opportunities will arise for me once my work with Professor Carnes concludes.|"[""1.
