A dock is a place where ships are received and inspected. There are dry-docks and wet-docks. Dry-docks are used for ship repairs, where water can be let in or out as needed. Wet-docks keep ships afloat. Docks maintain a uniform water level for loading and unloading ships without interruption. The first commercial wet-dock in the UK was built in 1708 in Liverpool. The docks were bustling with men of various nationalities, creating a confusion of languages and work. Despite the chaos, seeing other boys working gave hope to the narrator, who observed the daily ship activities.

No one could have predicted the orange-peel causing such a fall. I slipped and heard my foe's breath close above me. Fortunately, my tumble revealed a shilling and a penny, leading my enemy away. However, my last penny rolled into the dock, leaving me vexed and weary as night fell. Sitting on a heap of seeds, I pondered my next move.

"I overheard most of this from a corner of the tarpaulin where I hid unnoticed. I saw Biddy coolly mixing coffee with a stone bottle as the watchman neared.

I didn't need anyone to tell me it was my chance. My limbs were trembling with fear as I passed the sleeping man and reached the wharf's edge. The ship was groaning and moving slightly, tempting me towards the dark hole. But the gangway was gone! I had to jump across the gap standing still. With all my courage, I leaped but fell short. Luckily, I caught the edge of the hole and hung over the water. The watchman's light missed me, and I managed to climb into the ship undetected. I found myself among cargo, struggling to find a hiding spot. Suddenly, I touched a warm arm and heard a voice whispering, claiming to be a stowaway.

"I shouldn't have come in tonight, but the person in charge is asleep, although this is the first time I've seen him asleep in four days. It seems like it might be whiskey, as I overheard him talking loudly with one of those rowdy, drunk Irish people. The Scotsman's tone was dry and unpleasant, making it hard to express my anger in whispers. I was still feeling dizzy, leaning against some lumber. ""Have you not forgiven me for mistreating the old lady? I apologize to you and to her. It's not for any of us to judge the mistakes of others unless it's our duty,"" he said. ""I've been in court all day,"" he replied vaguely. ""I'm not a big eater, but I had some orange peels and some spilled corn.

"He wasn't handsome, yet the word ""noble"" suited his face in sleep under the light. Thin and drawn with pain, his face hinted at intelligence. His fair hair lacked luster, falling in locks without grace. The ship moved, revealing men working purposefully on the dock. The noises they made were strange, like a dance.

With a single breath, I and my friend declared our readiness to do anything, even if it meant securing a free passage as idlers. The captain's response to this, amid laughter from the crew, was dismissive, implying that it was a common claim made by sneaks and stowaways. Alister's hands clenched at his sides, unimpressed by the captain's taunt. Despite the tension, Alister's bold response and the captain's observation of his hands seemed to soften the captain's demeanor. As for me, I quickly explained the situation regarding my attire change and the advice I received in Liverpool, which led to an unexpected reaction when I mentioned the shop owned by Mr. Moses Cohen. Laughter erupted among the sailors, but the captain's amusement turned to anger upon learning that I had money to pay for passage. Despite the crew's chuckles, I assured the captain of my intention to work hard for my passage. Eventually, under the watchful eye of Mr. Johnson, the third mate, I struggled to maintain composure on the deck, feeling the effects of the turbulent seasickness.

The boatswain's kind words lifted my spirits, but before I could thank him, he was off. The boatswain then guided me to a seat and handed me tools to clean the ship's brass. Despite feeling sick, I rubbed the brass vigorously. Soon, the boatswain returned with a crew to clean the deck. When the water threatened the polished stanchions, I moved them, earning a drenching from the hose. Despite the laughter, I kept working.

On the ship's main deck, I was scrubbing away with a squeegee when a blast of sea-water knocked me off balance. The boatswain rescued me, but the crew was on edge as the storm approached.

"Down we went to the right, and the walls went up. All I saw was the sky, stars, masts, and yards. The excitement grew, so I climbed up to the forecastle, held on tight, and looked down to see what was happening. Alister was there, helping me hold on. He pointed to where everyone else was looking. The men quieted down, and the captain and officers on the bridge stood still. Alister yelled over the wind, ""Wait a moment, the moon will be out again."" The cloud passed, and I saw a streak of light on the water with a black object bobbing up and down like the porpoises. The men got excited, and a crowd rushed to the forecastle.

The crew of the ship's whaleboat amazed me with their silent and alert demeanor, contrasting with rowdy sailors on deck. The smooth launch of the boat, almost touching the roaring waves, was a stark difference from my canal experiences. As the boat ventured out, battling the elements, we strained our eyes to follow its progress. Eventually, we spotted a man clinging to the capsized boat. Tension rose as the crew approached, trying to rescue him. Amidst the uncertainty, the moon provided a glimpse of the rescue operation. Despite challenges, the crew persevered, eventually managing to haul the man on board. The scene was a mix of anxiety and relief, highlighting the bravery and determination of the crew in the face of adversity.|"[""1.

After completing some odd tasks, I returned to the deck too late to witness a rescue. Amidst a group of men, I couldn't catch a glimpse of the heroes and the saved man. Two Irish sailors were engaged in a heated conversation nearby. Eager to know more, I approached. The dialogue sounded spirited, resembling the yapping of terriers. One sailor recounted a daring rescue, praising Tom for his bravery. His friend, Pat, grew impatient, revealing a tattoo of the Crucifixion on his back. As I observed, the crew attended to the rescued lad, Dennis O'Moore, who lay unconscious. His pale face against the dark waves evoked a somber image. The sight revealed the depth of the sailors' emotions and the profound bond of friendship at sea.|"['1.

Alister and I shared a watch after picking up Dennis O'Moore. News about the rescued man spread quickly, and I became popular for my help between the galley and steerage. The boat demanded attention due to rough winds and waves. I was sent to assist the steersman, clinging to the deck in wet socks. The boatswain's mate teased me about my discomfort, but I embraced the challenge. Despite the harsh conditions, I found pride and pleasure in helping. Some sailors despise the sea, but it had always called to me. I felt the sea's charm even in the bone-chilling wind. I later questioned if I would trade this life for a different fate, but the answer was a resounding no as I stood by the steersman, fully committed to my chosen path.|"[""1.

Our new crew member was initially assumed to be a gentleman, despite his accent reminiscent of old Biddy Macartney. His soft brogue with a unique finish made me wish I could introduce myself as a midshipman instead of a stowaway. He curiously asked why I stowed away, suggesting it might have been due to boredom or seeking adventure. Despite his impertinent questions, his kindness made me feel at ease. He shared his desire to see the world and his dislike for his uncle's lawyer profession. He reminisced about a boat named Tim Brady's, expressing regret over a lost friend named Barney, who sacrificed himself in a storm. His emotional reflection on past events highlighted the impact of decisions and the importance of forgiveness and remembrance.|"[""1.

I started to realize that one of the world's wonders is the presence of many kind individuals who are different from oneself and close family. I wasn't conceited enough to disapprove of my new friend who surprised me. From the moment Barney came to mind, everything else seemed forgotten. I gazed at him in amazement, unaccustomed to seeing a man show emotions publicly, let alone crying in company or praying before a stranger. His prayers were brief, and as he finished, he blushed, apologizing for forgetting me. He shared a touching story of how Barney, who raised him after his mother's death, had a deep connection with his family. Barney's act of giving him his mother's crucifix showed the profound bond they shared.|"['1.

I think it was because both Dennis and I were crying that I didn't notice Mr. Johnson until he was next to Dennis's hammock. I received a stern lecture about Dennis's condition and was advised to use common sense. After confiding in Alister about Dennis's health, he shared a story about Protestant martyrs. Later, we were given tasks on the ship, and I struggled to climb the rigging. Despite my fear, I managed to reach the main-top with guidance. Although I was uneasy and felt light-headed, I made it back down with some difficulty. Mr. Johnson praised my efforts and mentioned a reward of extra grog for my health.|"[""1.

The ship's crew cheered upon receiving an announcement to gather at the fo'c'sle. The boatswain instructed the sailors to stow their cleaning-tackle and proceed to the designated area. Attire was casual, with a mention of white ties and kid gloves for those who had them. Laughter ensued as the crew prepared for the gathering.

My first friend thawed and went ahead cheerfully, which made me glad. Dennis noticed and mischievously held me back, teasing about the Scotchman's tuft of hair. Suddenly, chaos erupted as men tumbled over each other towards the forecastle. Dennis, thrown against Alister, accidentally touched the stubborn lock of hair. Alister, suspecting a prank, playfully hoisted Dennis on his back. Amid cheers, Dennis was placed on a deck-tub. A circle of smokers welcomed Dennis, making space for him. The third mate prepared grog, sparking a debate on its strength. Despite the tobacco-filled air, we drank the grog. The cook sang a lamentable song, off-key but entertaining. Dennis suggested using a fiddle for accompaniment, sending me to fetch it. The fiddle, once owned by a musical cook who passed away, brought joy to the crew.|"[""1.

It took me some time to find everything, and when I returned to Dennis, another song had started. A young sailor I didn't know was singing, and it nearly caused a commotion. The song was supposed to be funny, but except for one witty yet very crude line, it lacked humor. I felt uncomfortable hearing it, remembering similar songs from Snuffy's. Alister, with anger in his eyes, pulled me away, expressing his disgust for the indecency. Before the situation escalated, Dennis intervened with his fiddle, playing a lively tune that drowned out the inappropriate song. The distraction worked, and the men shifted their focus.

"The sailors cheered as the oldest and hairiest one approved, and the song began. Sambo's fiddle paused, making way for Dennis O'Moore's beautiful voice as he sang: ""There's a bower of roses by Bendemeer's stream, And the nightingale sings round it all the night long."" The sailors put down their pipes to listen. Although they didn't look like nightingale exiles, they nodded in unison as the song continued: ""That bower and its music I never forget.""

The boatswain was foiled once more in his scheme. Alister's voice, though different from Dennis's, carried a powerful, stirring tone that resonated with all on board. As they sang a verse together, Alister's strong voice filled the air, drawing everyone in. Suddenly, the captain appeared, unnoticed until then. The solo turned into a chorus, uniting Englishmen, Scots, and Irishmen in a patriotic fervor. The voyage took a challenging turn as dense fogs enveloped the ship near Newfoundland.

"Alfonso was right about sailors' grumbling being a luxury. It acts as a safety valve for their frustrations. We had learned seamanship and the art of grumbling aboard the _Slut_, a ship we found to be the worst we had known. The captain promised repairs before heading back to Halifax, or so we thought. It turned out we were to sail ""down south"" to trade cheap goods. Alfonso, an experienced sailor, believed we were heading to Demerara. Despite our protests, we had no real choice and decided to go along. We even arranged for our letters to be forwarded to us in Demerara.

After leaving New York, we sailed away from the coast. I was thrilled to learn we were heading to Bermuda for repairs. The leak in our ship, the _Slut_, had us pumping day and night, but the water kept seeping in. The starlit nights nearing Bermuda were unforgettable. The stars in the sky were unlike anything I had seen before. Approaching the tropics, the constellations, moonlight, and warm waves' glow were magical. The days were hot, but the pleasure of sailing on the blue waters, spotting dolphins and birds, was immense. The sight of Bermuda with its twinkling lights and clear waters was a sight to behold. The black pilot who guided us through the Narrows was dignified and skilled, despite his unusual appearance. The channel to Bermuda was a colorful underwater garden with reefs and marine life.|"['1.

That evening, our ship anchored, and the pilot disembarked. Despite the pleasant day, we felt unusually tired, which often led to mischief with Dennis and intolerance with Alister. The situation was all too familiar, and I could sense it coming when they began discussing the pilot. While we all acknowledged the pilot's skill and unique appearance, Dennis and Alister couldn't see eye to eye. Dennis, without directly contradicting Alister, made comments that irked him. As evening approached, I found myself feeling irritable too. Dennis became hysterical at the sight of the pilot, and his behavior rubbed off on me, much to Alister's dismay. We stood at attention, trying to contain our laughter, as the pilot approached. The tension was palpable, and I couldn't shake off a silly story I'd heard earlier.

The sky above the sea formed a half-circle of deep blue-black, with a peculiar patch in the eye of the storm. The sea beneath it shimmered white, while the area in front was a strange green-black, tossing about aimlessly. The wind moaned eerily, barely felt but creating a terrifying atmosphere. As darkness descended, the sea and sky merged into a tumultuous mass of ink and the horizon widened with a strange hissing sound. Suddenly, a black cloud connected with the sea, forming a twisting column of water. The scene was mesmerizing and eerie, culminating in a blinding squall of rain and crashing waves.

"Alfonso described Georgetown as peculiar when seen from the sea. At first, the sight of tree tops emerging from the water catches your attention. As you approach, you realize this is due to the low-lying land, shielded by a sea-wall. My first glimpse of Georgetown was not under usual circumstances.

As I watched my friend Dennis prepare for a special occasion, the engineer advised him to wear a fresh tie and have a neat appearance. Dennis was getting ready with a flower for his coat and needed a pocket-handkerchief. The squire, who must have been handsome, seemed to forget something important. As they left, I admired their departure from the verandah. The night was beautiful, despite the heat and buzzing insects. Fireflies danced among the trees, and moths fluttered around the lamp. O'Brien, the caretaker, took great care of me, serving a delicious supper and teaching me to mix drinks. Suddenly, I heard noises from his room, thinking there was a struggle, but it turned out to be a battle against cockroaches.|"['1.

The young officer expressed hopes that I had been comfortable, while Dennis regretted that I had not joined them. I pondered my future as idleness led me to weary thoughts without action. I wondered about the sugar-planter's treatment of Dennis and if he would assist more than wealthy relatives typically do. The stars faded with my unanswered speculations as my friends returned. Dennis, disheveled and flushed, accidentally dropped gloves and a handkerchief. As he retrieved them, the lieutenant sang a tune. Willie remained silent, seeking rest, and I settled into my hammock. I overheard Dennis and Alister quarreling over whether the song Dennis sang was Scotch or Irish, a dispute I couldn't arbitrate as I only heard the Irish perspective.|"['1.

Facts are indisputable, and the melody of 'Robin Adair' has been passed down through generations. The song holds a rich history, originating from ancient Irish tunes.

When Dennis and I went to the stelling to meet Alister, we delivered messages of hospitality from the young engineer and Dennis's cousin. Alister had agreed to help the burnt-out store-owner while we were out of seamen's work, with terms including board and lodging. Dennis praised Alister's hard work and perseverance, admiring his industrious nature. Alister boasted about the work ethic of Aberdeenshire men, claiming they excel in any task, even building a mountain to the moon. Despite Dennis's admiration for Alister's qualities, he questioned his own worth and future prospects. Mr. Macdonald, the store-owner, closely watched the Chinamen working, but found amusement in Dennis's antics. The young engineer advised Dennis to return to Halifax and start a new chapter in his life. Alister considered enlisting in a regiment for better opportunities and advancement, especially in the Royal Engineers, where he could excel in both peace and wartime service.|"['1.

Alister, Dennis, and Willie were discussing their future plans. Alister, with dreams of fortune, considered trading in natural curiosities to make a living. Dennis, eager to assist, wanted to collect exotic birds for him. Willie, the visionary, proposed a grand scheme involving trading goods from different parts of the world. Amidst their excitement, a mysterious Chinese man arrived with letters from Mr. Macdonald. Alister, Dennis, and Willie were intrigued by the unexpected delivery.

"After explaining, he stood motionless, his face calm but his eyes scanning the room. I was so engrossed in observing him that Dennis had already started reading his letter before I even opened mine. The letters were identical, except for the names, written on pink paper and scented. Dennis's read: ""_Hymeneal_.--Mr. Alfonso St. Vincent and Miss Georgiana Juba request the pleasure of Mr. Dennis O'Moore's company at their wedding celebration. Luncheon at noon on Saturday."" We responded politely and the Chinaman swiftly took our notes, bowing before leaving. Dennis, brushing off the doorpost touched by the Chinaman, followed him out.

"Ah-Fo seemed happy with our praise and the coins he received for his performance. Despite this, he still appeared discontent. He sadly told Dennis, ""Ah-Fo likes to do the same as you."" He attempted an Irish jig but failed. We tried to hold back laughter, but Ah-Fo noticed and stopped, reminiscing about his original act. On the day we left for Halifax, Alfonso and his wife Georgiana visited. Georgiana was well-dressed and elegant. Dennis approved of her and discussed Alfonso's career prospects with her. Dennis, wanting to support his friend, decided to sail as a seaman with us. Although some disapproved, Dennis was resolute.

Dennis spoke slowly, sharing his belief that a person's true character can be judged by their kindness towards family and friends. He emphasized the importance of being good to those close to us, comparing it to passing through challenges with support like the children of Israel. As they prepared to head home, the group received help from friends, including the engineer officer and the sugar-planter's family. Despite challenges in packing, they were grateful for the assistance. Before boarding the ship, they bid farewell to Dennis's cousin, with Miss Eileen helping them through a garden shortcut.

Our journey on the steamship was smooth, thanks to the well-equipped vessel and the first mate's interest in science. He kept a log of weather data, and we enjoyed assisting him with observations. The captain sent money to Dennis, correcting his mistake, and Dennis excitedly planned purchases upon receiving the letter. We eventually boarded our old ship for the return voyage, filled with both rough weather and camaraderie. Alister's progress in learning French from Dennis was commendable, despite his thick accent. The boatswain, who knew a bit of French, felt a hint of jealousy towards Alister's newfound skill. As we neared Ireland, Dennis's enthusiasm for his homeland was evident, and upon reaching Liverpool, we sought out Biddy Macartney, only to discover she had faced challenges lately.|"[""1.

Biddy was at her home, and I can never forget that place. The small court surrounded by tall buildings had only one entrance through an archway. All the houses faced the court; there were no back doors or spaces. Everything happened in that court: the dirt, the cleanups, the arguments, the love, the elderly resting, and the kids playing. It was the center of all activities, from emptying a bucket to getting fresh air. We were directed to a house, and the stench grew as we climbed the stairs. We reached Biddy's locked door, but a woman with children appeared, asking which one of us was Biddy's son. She shared how Biddy feared being taken away and had hidden money to bring her son home.

I stopped him abruptly because he didn't notice the lost look on the old woman's face. She sat down, searching for Micky's letter, then wept over it. Despite our efforts, she didn't fully recover. Dennis patiently comforted her, listening to her talk about Micky's struggles and yearning for home. She almost revealed her savings but hesitated. Dennis gave money to the other woman to feed Biddy. He reassured the old woman that Micky could return home. We returned the next day to find a commotion. Biddy had vanished while the caretaker was out. We raced to the dock gates, learning that Biddy had inquired about a ship from New York. Alister showed keen interest in Biddy's story, planning to join us the next day.

"Dear Jack and Dennis,

I have safely returned home, albeit missing the funeral due to an unfortunate mishap with the engines on the train. This incident, caused by the Company's thriftiness with second-hand equipment, was seen as a providential event by the family. Except for Miss Margaret MacCantywhapple, who, though virtuous, is not in her prime due to various health issues. My mother, thankfully, is well and sends her regards and blessings to both of you. She is now financially secure due to an inheritance left by my father's cousin, ensuring her comfort in her old age.

Returning home has been a joy, with familiar sights and sounds of Scotland welcoming me back. The train journey, despite its delays, allowed me to appreciate the beauty of the cliffs and sea. I look forward to hearing about your safe return and hope Dennis writes in French so I can practice with my father's old dictionary.

Yours sincerely,
