"Katie stood at the mill, daydreaming and turning the handle swiftly when suddenly Ruth, the kitchen-girl, playfully grabbed her and placed her in the sink. Katie, unfamiliar with chores like grinding coffee, was surprised by Ruth's actions. Ruth, unaware of Katie's efforts to help, didn't realize she had upset her friend. Mrs. Clifford, used to her daughter's antics, sent for new clothes without much concern. Flyaway, known for mischief, was starting to remember things. The baby's first memory would be of Ruth's playful act. Flyaway later wrote her first letter to a friend, Dotty Dimple. Despite appearing innocent, Flyaway was sly and sneaky, trying to sneak off to church. Despite trying to comfort her sick grandma, Flyaway was eager to leave. Grandma pondered using nicknames like ""Mosey"" and was amused by Flyaway's antics with an orange before she left the room."|"['1.

"Flyaway tiptoed downstairs after Ruth had kissed her and turned away to prepare a poultice. She sneaked into the nursery, donned Horace's straw hat, grabbed her grandfather's old cane, and snatched a daily newspaper. With the paper hugged to her chest and her dress lifted to avoid mud, she mused, ""Naughty thing! I wish I hadn't taken you today, you're so bad!"" As she stumbled for the fifth time, she slung the ""naughty thing"" over her shoulder like a gun. Approaching the meeting-house, she assumed everyone was inside eating, so she decided to explore upstairs to find them. Clattering up the stairs, she made quite a racket with her cane. Inside, Mr. Lee was preaching about the Sabbath, and Flyaway, swinging her cane, marched up the aisle to her family's pew, where her antics surprised and amused everyone."|"[""Question 1:\nWhat did Flyaway take with her as she tiptoed downstairs?\nA) A poultice\nB) Horace's straw hat\nC) Her grandfather's old cane\nD) A daily newspaper\nE) All of the above"", ""Question 2:\nHow did Flyaway lift her dress to avoid mud?\nA) She tied it in a knot\nB) She tucked it into her socks\nC) She held it in her hands\nD) She lifted it with her teeth\nE) She didn't lift her dress"", 'Question 3:\nWhat did Flyaway do when she stumbled for the fifth time?\nA) She threw the newspaper away\nB) She lifted her dress higher\nC) She slung the ""naughty thing"" over her shoulder\nD) She sat down on the ground\nE) She cried for help', 'Question 4:\nWhere did Flyaway assume everyone was when she approached the meeting-house?\nA) Inside eating\nB) Outside playing\nC) Sleeping in the pews\nD) Shopping in town\nE) None of the above', 'Question 5:\nWhat was Mr. Lee preaching about inside the meeting-house?\nA) The importance of family\nB) The Sabbath\nC) The weather\nD) The latest news\nE) The art of storytelling', ""Question 6:\nHow did Flyaway's family react to her antics in the meeting-house?\nA) They scolded her\nB) They ignored her\nC) They laughed and were surprised\nD) They left the pew\nE) They joined in her antics""]"|"['E) All of the above', 'C) She held it in her hands', 'C) She slung the ""naughty thing"" over her shoulder', 'A) Inside eating', 'B) The Sabbath', 'C) They laughed and were surprised']"
All the people in the room wore their hats; why? No one spoke, and the preacher continued talking; why? Flyaway didn't talk either; it wasn't allowed. If they did, a man would descend from the chimney and instruct others to take them home. It was the holy Sabbath, after all. Flyaway's mind wandered as she lay on the seat, her eyes closed, imagining Noddle's Island. A fly buzzed around her, but Horace protected her from it. The others in the pew sat still, ensuring the little sleeper stayed safe in her dream world. Flyaway sat with Dotty and Jennie, tending to her doll's feet. She thought about heaven being on Mount Blue and decided she would go there too. With candy and a cookie in her pocket, she was determined to join Charlie in heaven.|"['1.

Flyaway imagined someone at the gates of heaven offering a hand like a train conductor. To prepare, she took a five-dollar bill from her mother's purse, wore Horace's boots for the journey, and put on eyeless spectacles to see better. With her toy doll Dinah, she ventured outside, passing the family cat and heading towards Mount Blue in the distance. Unaware of the vast distance, she felt brave like a fly on the Great Wall of China. Along the way, she dropped her doll and the cat, but a dog helped her fix her boot. Despite losing Horace's boots, she continued towards her imagined destination, the Pines, encountering thorns and friends Dotty Dimple and Jennie Vance. Flyaway remained determined on her journey, sometimes remembering her heavenly destination as she navigated the challenges ahead.|"[""1.

Flyaway, a small girl, snuck away quietly and happily nibbled on a stick of candy, feeling ahead of her friends on the path to heaven. A bumblebee, drawn by the candy, followed her closely. As she walked, growing tired, she realized the candy belonged to Charlie and felt guilty. When she held it up, the bumblebee mistook her for a threat and stung her thumb. Distressed, Flyaway thought she had reached the end of the world, finding only trees where she expected people and houses. Frightened and hungry, she longed for dinner or some comfort. Overwhelmed by fear and pain, she wished for her mother or a meal to appear magically.|"['1.

"Someone had arrived to fetch her. It might have been Charlie, coming to take her on a journey to heaven. There was a sudden burst of light followed by a loud crash. Flyaway then realized what was happening. Logs were being rolled up in the sky, on the blue surface. She had seen logs at a mill before. The noise was deafening. She fell into a deep sleep, and in her dream, someone descended from the clouds and handed her a peach turnover as large as a dinner basket, or so she thought. Just as she was about to eat it, she was awakened by raindrops falling into her eyes. Startled, she exclaimed, ""If you pees um, I want some cheese um."" She turned to her doll, Diny, for comfort. Flyaway, three years old, contemplated going to heaven and sitting in God's lap. After the rain had stopped and the sky cleared, the sun had set, and the birds had bid good night. The new moon appeared, and Flyaway emerged from the bushes like a rabbit, causing a commotion at grandpa Parlin's house. When dinner was served, everyone wondered where little Fly was, and Dotty Dimple innocently replied. Aunt Louise expressed her concern, stating she would not allow Maria to leave town again and leave Katie in their care. Horace rushed out but returned relieved after checking the attic and roof, finding no trace of Fly. The last memory they had of Fly was"|"['1.

Mrs. Dr. Gray, Grace, and Susy were preparing to leave when Mrs. Dr. Gray expressed her thoughts about Flyaway, the little girl who seemed like a spirit. She felt that Flyaway and Charlie were too lovely for this world. Abner and Horace went up to the Pines but didn't explore the forest beyond, thinking it unlikely for such a small child to wander so far. Abner then mentioned the railroad surveyors who were in the town with their equipment. He recalled seeing a little girl through his spy-glass, far beyond the Pines. Flyaway, exhausted, mentioned going to heaven to see Charlie, and then fell asleep. When the group arrived, Dotty Dimple excitedly shared that a railroad surveyor found Flyaway. The relieved family brought Flyaway back home, where she only complained about a bee sting on her thumb. After some care and a bowl of bread and milk, Flyaway laughed in her sleep, dreaming of Charlie guiding her to heaven.|['1.

Seeing Jennie Vance, Dotty planned to call her over. Jennie, confident in her looks, took offense at Dotty's comment. The artist, ready to paint, decided to start with Flyaway, a lively child. Prudy ensured the wheelbarrow was secure before assisting Flyaway. The artist, unable to calm Flyaway, suggested her mother accompany her the next day. The children, unable to find the missing wheelbarrow, marched Flyaway to Aunt Martha's for dinner.
