For a couple of days, everything continued normally. Mrs. Woodward didn't mention her problems again, Percy had conveniently forgotten them, and the younger children were unaware. However, Winona couldn't shake off a troubling thought. A letter arrived on the fourth morning with an old-fashioned handwriting and the Seaton postmark.

Mrs. Woodward hesitated, unsure about Winona's future. She considered Aunt Harriet's suggestion that transferring Winona to Seaton High School might be beneficial. Mrs. Woodward criticized Winona's music skills, implying that her teacher, Miss Harmon, was inadequate. Despite any grievances Winona had against Miss Harmon, she adamantly opposed the idea of changing schools. Winona's determination clashed with her mother's indecisiveness. However, when Mr. Joynson, the family's trusted solicitor, intervened, he strongly supported sending Winona to Seaton. He convinced Mrs. Woodward that it would be beneficial for Winona to attend a proper school. Despite Winona's protests, she was ultimately overruled and had to accept the decision. Percy, Winona's sibling, playfully teased her about the situation, predicting that she would eventually come to appreciate the change.|"[""1.

"Letty confidently declared, ""If Win leaves, I'll take charge at home. I'll pour tea, unlock the apple room, and play the piano first."" Winona countered, ""Don't forget the governess. Your freedom will be short-lived."" Percy humorously remarked on the ladies' indecision. Winona, torn between staying at Seaton or returning home, felt a mix of emotions. She didn't want to fail but disliked the idea of settling down. In a flurry, she sought Winona's opinion on clothing choices and fretted about sending her to Aunt Harriet's.

"""Don't worry,"" Letty reassured her, ""I'll lead by example when you're away. I'll strive to improve like a copybook.

Remember, while you're enjoying your teenage years, Winona will be a mature person of twenty-two. 'That eldest Miss Woodward is aging, you know!' people will say."" The short time between Aunt Harriet's offer and the scholarship exam kept Winona occupied. Miss Jones, the seamstress, was busy in the nursery with the sewing machine, making adjustments to Winona's dresses. Despite the fitting process, Winona disliked it. ""They hardly ever fit and need alterations,"" her mother explained. ""You should be studying every morning for the exam. If only Miss Harmon were here to coach you. I heard she might give up teaching and move in with her uncle. I hope it's true, then I can take the younger ones without guilt. I don't want to treat her poorly, but teaching might not be her calling."" Winona tried to prepare for the exam by reading her school books in the garden. She became despondent"|"['1.

"""Whom the gods love die young,"" began Winona as she pondered her writing task. Her thoughts turned to Lady Jane Grey, a painting she once saw, and she began to describe it vividly. She painted a picture of the innocent face, the yellow hair, and the grey eyes fixed on a book. Winona then delved into the surroundings, reminiscing about Hampton Court and the children who once roamed there. She imagined their conversations about philosophy and their tutors. The atmosphere of the old-world garden by the Thames came alive in her words. As Winona's imagination soared, she delved into Jane's life, pondering her desires and struggles.

Mrs. Woodward was thrilled that she hired Miss Jones in time and Winona's school clothes were ready. There was a rush when they found Winona's mackintosh was too short and her boots small.

Afternoon attendance at the High School was not mandatory. Most classes were held in the morning, leaving afternoons for optional activities like drawing, singing, or physical education until four.

"""Enough!"" she exclaimed after about eight lines. ""Your incompetence has been quite evident, and we will spare the form from any more of your mistakes. We need to find a way to sharpen your thinking skills. It seems like your brain has not been active since you started school! You must see Miss Bishop at four o'clock today.""

Winona felt anxious about going back home. Despite the challenging schoolwork, High School had opened up a whole new world for her. She couldn't settle for her old routine anymore.

"After a rocky start, Aunt Harriet's relationship with Winona became more formal. They exchanged polite conversation, but Winona mostly responded with simple ""Yes"" or ""No"" answers. Winona found solace when her aunt delved into books. Although Winona occasionally shared news from home, she rarely spoke about her school life and new interests. Despite this, the new governess at Highfield was making an impact on her students, as Mamie's letter revealed. Winona's second term at school was going more smoothly, thanks to Miss Lever's guidance. Margaret Howell, the head girl, noticed the positive changes at the school. Margaret, along with Kirsty Paterson, revamped the school's atmosphere, fostering a sense of community and achievement. They introduced ""The Order of Distinguished School Service"" to recognize outstanding contributions from students like Daisy Hicks, Agnes Heath, and Gladys Vickers. These efforts were elevating the school's reputation and spirit."|"[""1.

A new library was established at the school this term, thanks to Margaret's initiative as head prefect. Before the Christmas break, she urged everyone to contribute books they found interesting and would recommend to others. The response exceeded expectations, with a total of 341 volumes donated. While waiting for shelves to be built, Margaret enlisted Winona to help catalog and label the books. Meanwhile, Kirsty, the Games Captain, focused on hockey training for junior students. As Kirsty needed help supervising practices, Winona stepped in despite her busy schedule. School rules were strictly followed, and Winona juggled her library duties and assisting with hockey training. Garnet, during her drawing lesson, devised a plan to help with the library.|"[""1.

Kirsty was an excellent organizer. She quickly identified the abilities of her peers and had a talent for motivating even those who seemed unenthusiastic. She worked very hard herself and expected the same from everyone else. Her focus for the term was to improve the athletic skills of all students. While she could have gained more recognition by concentrating on a few talented individuals, Kirsty believed that it was best for the school's overall benefit to train all students equally. This approach ensured that even the youngest students were closely monitored during their training sessions. The school's Governors and headmistress supported the sports department, providing numerous tennis courts for the girls to use. Winona, a Fifth Form student, worked with great enthusiasm under Kirsty's guidance. Despite Kirsty's tendency to be critical, Winona valued her feedback and made significant progress. Kirsty encouraged Winona to devote equal effort to both tennis and cricket, emphasizing the importance of all-round training. The summer was pleasant at Seaton, with beautiful flowers in the park and green foliage in the Abbey Close. Winona enjoyed studying by her bedroom window, captivated by the peaceful surroundings. The sound of a passing biplane or bugle call served as reminders of the changing times, with the ongoing war constantly on everyone's minds, including Winona's.|"[""1.

Winona faced a dilemma with Percy, who seemed to have fallen in with the wrong crowd at Longworth College. Despite his requests for money and a strange suggestion to borrow from Miss Beach, Winona refused to comply. Percy's subsequent enlistment in the Royal Rytonshire Fusiliers caught Winona by surprise. Initially, his mother contemplated seeking his discharge, but trusted advisors advised against it, believing military service would instill responsibility in him. Winona eagerly anticipated seeing Percy in uniform and even started knitting socks for him. Meanwhile, she prepared to lead her combined V.a. and V.b.

The day at school was quite unusual. V.a. had the entire place to themselves. The Fourth Form room turned into a temporary clinic where Dr. Barnes vaccinated the girls. Each girl first had her arm cleaned by Miss Bishop, then received the vaccine. The process was quick and painless. Afterward, the girls waited for their arms to dry before putting on their blouses. They gathered cricket and tennis equipment and school books for their camp. A motor char-à-banc arrived at five o'clock to take them to the quarantine camp on a hill, five miles from Seaton. The camp had a simple wooden shelter with beds, a kitchen area, and a space for Miss Huntley. The girls were excited about the adventure and the chance to live outdoors.|"['1.

During the quarantine at Camp, Winona took charge as the V.A. team Captain. They set up a cricket pitch and a tennis court on the pasture. An old man cut the grass with a scythe, making the ground bumpy. Tennis had a makeshift net, and cricket was comical due to the players' limited skills. Despite the challenges, the girls found the games amusing. They enjoyed outdoor living with beautiful sunsets and starlit nights. On Sundays, they had prayers and sang hymns. The ancient Hymn of St. Patrick was a favorite. The girls stayed healthy, with Dr. Barnes checking on them regularly.

It seemed like a simple plan. Beatrice, in charge of the kitchen, took salt from the box and shared it with her friends. They rubbed it into their hair roots.

Leaving camp was bittersweet, as they had enjoyed their time there. Winona spent the summer coaching her siblings in cricket and playing tennis with the Vicarage girls.

Lieutenant Mainwaring, a daring pilot, caught Winona's attention as she watched him practice aerobatics. She admired him and wished her cousin Percy could join the Flying Squadron too. Winona's patriotic spirit led her to collect aircraft pictures and even wave at Lieutenant Mainwaring from her balcony.

Miss Kelly, the hostel's strict disciplinarian, clashed with the girls over rules. Winona felt unfairly reprimanded for innocently waving to gentlemen. The girls, used to more freedom, resented the strict boarding-school regulations. They disliked the early hostel curfew, interrupting their post-school chats. Winona, over sixteen, found it absurd to seek permission for simple tasks. She struggled to concentrate in the noisy study hall, where Miss Kelly monitored them closely. Despite Winona's plea to work in her cubicle, Miss Kelly insisted on group study. This arrangement frustrated Winona and affected her academic performance.

The school's hockey season was set to start in October, but in September, while the weather was still warm, the girls continued playing cricket on Wednesdays. The school had spacious playing fields next to a large public park, providing a great open area. One day, during a cricket match, Elsie spotted an airplane doing loops in the sky. It turned out to be Elsie's cousin, Lieutenant Harry Mainwaring, showing off his flying skills. The girls waved at him, and he landed the plane on the school grounds, much to everyone's excitement. Lieutenant Mainwaring graciously explained the plane to the girls before taking off again. Winona, one of the girls, later received a surprise gift of chocolates dropped from the airplane. However, her teacher, Miss Kelly, disapproved, leading to a comical mix-up that ended with Winona's room being changed.|"['1.

Miss Kelly, the strict hostel supervisor, believed she had stopped a budding romance and closely watched the girls, especially Winona, to prevent any further incidents. The girls in Room 2 mischievously waved towels from the balcony at an airplane passing by, risking Miss Kelly's reprimand. However, Lieutenant Mainwaring's departure ended the excitement. Despite clashes with Miss Kelly, Winona found joy with her hostel mates, engaging in games and dormitory antics. She even proposed forming an Old Girls' Hockey Club, sending out invitations eagerly.

At break, Agatha placed a paper on Winona's desk, questioning her about an invitation postcard sent to Margaret. The head girl scolded Winona for taking the initiative without consulting the prefects. Winona had unknowingly overstepped her authority by organizing a meeting without approval.

Winona was determined to enhance the sports field, and the tennis courts would not be neglected. She proposed that once the war ended, the Governors might cover the costs for the entire playing area. To begin, she sought an estimate for the rolling expenses. Due to the lack of able-bodied individuals during the war, finding someone to maintain the hockey field was challenging. Eventually, a volunteer was secured for a monthly rate of £1, with an additional thirty shillings for the initial field preparations. The total expenses for the season were estimated to be around six to seven pounds. Winona, mindful of past incidents, consulted Linda Fletcher to organize a fundraising event. The plan involved a variety of performances, including music and drama, to raise funds for the cause. The event was eagerly anticipated, with a packed hall and high expectations for the entertainment.|"[""1.

Miss Beach, a resident of Seaton for a long time, had never seen Wickborough Castle until today. The castle, originally built by King Canute during the Saxon and Norseman wars, was now mostly in ruins but still held historical significance. Queen Margaret found refuge there, and Richard II pursued Anne of Warwick. Princess Mary and Anne Boleyn had also been associated with the castle. The location of the castle on a cliff by the river offered a splendid view of the surrounding area. Winona and Miss Beach explored the castle, marveling at the ancient Danish tower, the medieval armory, and the wax figures depicting Sir Bevis and Dame Philippa.

Miss Beach invited Winona to spend the day at her friend Miss Carson's fruit, flower, and poultry farm. They set off on a new road, passing through beautiful woods with blue hyacinths and blackthorn blossoms. Miss Carson ran the farm with women pupils, focusing on simplicity and labor-saving.

Once the exams ended, Winona's mood shifted from contemplative to cheerful. Coaching Garnet had been demanding, but the sense of relief was immense. With just a month left in the term, the Sixth form would focus on regular work instead of intense exam preparation. The extra classes with Miss Goodson were no longer needed, granting leisure time at school. Winona planned to use these free moments for cricket practice, tennis, helping in the museum, and pursuing other interests. She was pleased to resume her role in the Games department and trained her team diligently. The upcoming matches against Binworth College were anticipated eagerly, offering a chance for the school to shine. Despite previous sports challenges, Winona was determined to lead her team to victory. Apart from school, she enjoyed evening drives with Aunt Harriet, learning to drive skillfully and relishing the freedom and thrill of the open road.|"[""1.

During the war, when the men were away, Winona thought about driving a taxi or a war van to help the government. She believed she could clean the cars well if needed. Aunt Harriet laughed, saying it was hard work, especially for a woman. When the garage attendant fell ill, Winona got a chance to clean the car. After a muddy day, she found it tougher than expected. She decided being a lady chauffeur wasn't for her. Apart from this, Winona enjoyed swimming classes organized by the school. The baths were luxurious, with hot-air apparatus for drying hair. The girls loved the comfort and convenience. They even joked about the Romans' bath luxuries. Audrey wished she lived in ancient times for such indulgences. Winona reminded her of the lack of baths in earlier centuries.|"['1.

At the end of the term, a swimming competition was organized for the girls, with prizes up for grabs. This was a first-time event at the school, so there was a lot of excitement. Miss Medland selected around thirty girls to compete, while the others watched from the sidelines. An afternoon was set aside for the contest, with parents invited to cheer on the participants. Evelyn was disappointed not to be chosen and hoped for a chance if someone fell ill just enough to avoid swimming. The event took place in the ladies' bath, with a lively audience of parents and friends. Supporters cheered for their favorites, with popular girls like Barbara receiving more encouragement than others. Juniors showed their support, even if it meant overlooking stronger contenders like Olga. Garnet noted Evelyn's unexpected participation and speculated on who might have had to drop out, suggesting it could be Freda due to toothache.|"[""1.

Winona didn't think she would win since she missed half the lessons, putting her at a disadvantage. Despite this, she aimed to do her best. The first event was the Upper School Championship for the fastest swimmer. Winona and Elsie tied for first, surprising everyone. In the Lower School Championship, Daisy won, cheered by her peers. The diving competition followed, with Audrey and Jess excelling. The style contest had candidates swim in different positions. The Midnight Race was a highlight, where swimmers held lit candles while swimming on their backs. It required skill and steadiness.

Audrey was uncertain about the outcome of the competition due to the differing judging styles of the teachers. The Obstacle Race, with planks over a bath and wash-tubs, was a hilarious challenge. The girls had to balance in the tubs and paddle to the planks. Winona, the Games Captain, faced tough competition from Elsie, who excelled in swimming. Despite losing, Winona graciously cheered for Elsie, emphasizing fair play over favoritism. She upheld the school's tradition of sportsmanship and inclusivity. Winona's loyalty to her friend Percy, serving in France, was evident through their secret communication system. She treasured his letters, marking his location on a war-map, and kept a special album with his photos and mementos as a precious keepsake.|['1.

Winona regularly sent packages to Percy, who still had a sweet tooth despite being in the campaign. He shared the treats with his friends in the dug-out, where they had fun. While Percy's letters were usually cheerful, Winona noticed a more serious tone at times. He shared the sad news of losing friends in battle. Winona prayed for Percy's safety, believing that God would guide him. Meanwhile, Aunt Harriet's health declined in the hot July weather. She struggled to rest and was no longer as energetic as before. Winona observed her aunt's change in demeanor and saw a vulnerability she hadn't noticed before. One evening, she found her aunt wiping a tear, revealing a new side to the usually strong and capable woman.|"['1.

"Winona walked across the room, hesitated but did not follow Aunt Harriet.

Linda had planned a French play set in a garden for the school program. The girls were to put on the show themselves, with some help from Mademoiselle. They worked hard on the costumes, holding sewing sessions every afternoon. The play featured a Fête Champêtre theme with costumes inspired by Watteau's paintings.
