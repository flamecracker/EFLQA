Bulgaria has a rich history that dates back to the arrival of the Bulgars in the Balkan Peninsula between 600 and 700. The early years of Bulgaria saw the introduction of Christianity from 700 to 893. The First Bulgarian Empire rose and fell between 893 and 972, followed by the rise and fall of 'Western Bulgaria' and Greek supremacy from 963 to 1186. The Second Bulgarian Empire experienced its rise and fall from 1186 to 1258. Subsequently, Serbia's supremacy and the final collapse occurred from 1258 to 1393. The Turkish Dominion era and emancipation spanned from 1393 to 1878. Prince Alexander of Battenberg played a significant role from 1878 to 1886, leading to the regeneration under Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg from 1886 to 1908.

In medieval history, both in the East and the West, there were many instances of violence and cruelty. The Middle Ages have extended into modern times, especially in the Balkans. It is crucial to remember certain things when discussing this region today. Less than two hundred years ago, England had highwaymen, Scotland had caterans, and Ireland had moonlighters. Religious fervor often worsened rather than lessened savagery. Our recent policies in the Balkans have not always been wise. The Balkan Peninsula is mainly inhabited by Slavs, including Bulgarians, Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Other inhabitants include Albanians, Greeks, Turks, and Romanians. Bulgaria and Serbia, along with Greece, currently dominate the peninsula. The ultimate solution to the region's issues may require territorial compromises. Failure to reach agreements could lead to external powers dominating the Balkans and eroding the independence of its nations.|['1.

In A.D. 6, Moesia and Thrace became Roman provinces, followed by Illyricum, Dalmatia, and Pannonia. Emperor Trajan conquered Dacia beyond the Danube, but it was lost after 150 years. The Balkan Peninsula thrived under Roman rule for three centuries. The Romans faced defensive battles against Germanic tribes like the Goths. Emperor Diocletian reorganized the provinces, establishing Thessalonica as the capital. Constantine the Great elevated Byzantium to Constantinople in 325. The arrival of the Huns in Europe and the battle of Adrianople in 378 were significant events. Theodosius placated the Goths, but after his death in 395, they devastated the peninsula. The empire split along the Drina and Save rivers, leading to lasting consequences. Latin and Greek influences shaped the Western and Eastern Empires, with Latin influence strong in the Danubian provinces. The spread of Christianity in the region began early, with Macedonia and Dalmatia as early adopters.|['**Question 1:**\nWhat event occurred in A.D. 6 regarding Roman provinces in the text?\nA) Conquest of Dacia\nB) Split along the Drina and Save rivers\nC) Establishment of Thessalonica as the capital\nD) Arrival of the Huns in Europe\nE) Loss of Dacia', 'A) Conquest of Dacia\n\n**Question 2:**\nWhich emperor reorganized the provinces and established Thessalonica as the capital?\nA) Trajan\nB) Constantine the Great\nC) Theodosius\nD) Diocletian\nE) Adrianople', 'D) Diocletian\n\n**Question 3:**\nWhat significant event occurred in 325 according to the text?\nA) Loss of Dacia\nB) Split along the Drina and Save rivers\nC) Arrival of the Huns in Europe\nD) Establishment of Constantinople\nE) Battle of Adrianople', 'D) Establishment of Constantinople\n\n**Question 4:**\nWho placated the Goths in the text?\nA) Trajan\nB) Constantine the Great\nC) Theodosius\nD) Diocletian\nE) Adrianople', 'C) Theodosius\n\n**Question 5:**\nWhat consequences followed the empire splitting along the Drina and Save rivers?\nA) Loss of Dacia\nB) Establishment of Constantinople\nC) Spread of Christianity\nD) Arrival of the Huns in Europe\nE) Latin influence in Danubian provinces', 'E) Latin influence in Danubian provinces\n\n**Question 6:**\nWhich region in the text is mentioned as an early adopter of Christianity?\nA) Dacia\nB) Illyricum\nC) Pannonia\nD) Macedonia\nE) Thrace']|['**', '**', '**', '**', '**', '**']
In the fifth century, the Huns moved from the Black Sea to the Danube and Theiss plains, devastating the Balkan peninsula despite receiving tribute from Constantinople for peace. After Attila's death in 453, they retreated to Asia, allowing the Goths to dominate the region. Theodoric settled in Novae in 483 before moving to Italy. Huns returned to the Danube, ravaging the Balkans repeatedly. The region regressed due to invasions, with walled cities like Salonika and Constantinople being the only safe havens. The Byzantine Empire struggled to defend against continuous invasions, with the Slavs appearing in the sixth century. They lacked central authority and unity, unlike the Avars, who were feared nomads of Asiatic origin. Avars and Slavs invaded the Balkans, posing a significant threat to Constantinople under Emperor Justinian I. Despite setbacks, the Byzantine defenses held strong against the invaders.|"[""1.

During the seventh century, the Avars were defeated by Charlemagne in 799, marking the end of their power in the Balkan peninsula. In Russia, the downfall of the Avars became a famous saying, 'they perished like Avars.' Meanwhile, the Slavs continued to thrive. By the middle of the seventh century, their migration into the Balkan peninsula was complete. The Slavs moved southwards and westwards, occupying territories between the Danube and the Balkan range, Macedonia, and even Greece. The Slavic influence was strong, with place-names indicating their settlement. The Greeks managed to maintain control over the Aegean coasts, absorbing any Slavs who entered Greece. The interior of the Balkan region became a solid mass of Slavs, while those north of the Danube were assimilated. The Byzantine Empire regained power through diplomacy and military strategies, leading to the decline of Avar might and the resurgence of Greek influence in the region.|"['1.

During the late 600s, the Bulgars, led by Prince Kubrat, united their nation spanning from the Volga to the Danube. After Kubrat's death in 638, his sons divided the realm. One son settled in Pannonia, aligning with the Avars, while another son, Asparukh, established in Bessarabia before moving south. By 679, the Bulgars under Asparukh captured Varna and settled between the Danube and the Balkan range. Over time, the Bulgars fused with the Slavs, adopting their language. Despite conflicts with the Greeks, the Bulgars, led by Krum, achieved victories, capturing Sofia and defeating the Greeks in 811. Krum's reign brought stability, laws, and economic growth to Bulgaria until his death in 815. His rule marked a period of advancement and unity for the Bulgarian people.|"[""1.

Prince Boris of Bulgaria played a crucial role in the country's conversion to Christianity during his reign from 852 to 889. The brothers Cyril and Methodius, known as the founders of Slavic civilization, were instrumental in spreading Christianity in the region. They created the Slavonic alphabet still used today in various countries. Despite initial challenges, such as the rivalry between Rome and Constantinople, the brothers' missionary work was successful. Prince Boris faced resistance in establishing an independent church and hierarchy but eventually aligned Bulgaria with the Byzantine Church. Under the rule of Simeon the Great, Bulgaria flourished economically and administratively, although his ambitions to conquer Byzantium went unfulfilled. Despite his efforts, Simeon was unable to secure recognition as basileus.|"['1. What role did Prince Boris play in Bulgaria during his reign?\nA. Military conquests\nB. Conversion to Christianity\nC.

In 924, Simeon launched a major attack on Constantinople after devastating Macedonia and Thrace. Despite facing formidable walls and catapults, negotiations ensued, yielding no rewards. In the west, he conquered much of eastern Serbia. Simeon, though lacking diplomatic finesse, expanded his kingdom significantly. His realm encompassed vast territories in the Balkans. Simeon's reign saw the Byzantine Church's influence in Bulgaria surge, with theological works flourishing. Upon his death in 927, his son Peter ascended the throne, fostering peace and marrying a Byzantine princess. Peter's reign, however, was marred by revolts and setbacks, leading to the division of Bulgaria into eastern and western regions. The spread of the Bogomil heresy in the tenth century also posed challenges to Bulgaria's stability.|"['1.

In the 10th century, the Emperor Nikiphóros faced danger from an alliance with Bulgaria, only for it to fall apart with Peter's death and Nikiphóros' murder by John Tzimisces. Svyatoslav of Russia took advantage, sacking Philippopolis in 970. John Tzimisces, a skilled leader, defeated the Russians at Arcadiopolis in autumn. The Greeks pursued the Russians, besieging and capturing Preslav in 972. Svyatoslav fled to Silistria but was defeated again. Peace was made in 972, with the Russians leaving Bulgaria. The Greeks triumphed, integrating eastern Bulgaria into their empire. Western Bulgaria remained untouched, leading to revolts under Samuel after John Tzimisces' death. Samuel's reign saw him reconquer territories but ultimately fall to Basil II in 1014. Basil II's victories led to the end of Bulgaria's independence until 1186, marked by oppressive Greek rule.|"['1.

The Balkan peninsula saw a diverse mix of settlers over the years. Tartar settlers arrived first, followed by colonies of Armenians and Vlakhs. The Normans arrived in 1081 and the crusaders in 1096, causing turmoil. The Greeks' heavy-handedness led to the rise of the Bogomil heresy, a refuge for patriotism. Emperor Alexis Comnenus persecuted the heresy, leading to its growth westwards. The Bulgarians faced challenges due to lack of unity, Byzantine influence, and the spread of the heresy. In 1186, a revolt in Tirnovo led by Vlakh shepherds crowned John Asen I as tsar. His relative, Kaloian, succeeded him and expanded Bulgaria's territory. Despite setbacks, Bulgaria flourished under John Asen II, reaching its peak by annexing Thrace, Macedonia, and more. However, the dynasty's decline began in 1258 due to internal strife, marking the end of Bulgaria's golden era.|"['1.

From 1258 onwards, Bulgaria struggled until its final demise as a state in 1393. Throughout this time, it lacked control over the Balkan peninsula due to internal turmoil. The country faced constant power struggles among rival leaders, political alliances, and betrayals, leading to a fragmented Bulgaria. Foreign powers took advantage of this chaos, with Serbia emerging as a dominant force. Various rulers, including Constantine and John Alexander, tried to navigate the turbulent political landscape, often seeking alliances with neighboring states. However, the looming threat of the Ottoman Empire grew stronger. The Turks made significant advances, culminating in the fall of Bulgaria in 1393. The once-proud nation succumbed to Turkish rule, marking the end of its independence.|"[""1.

During the 19th century, the Slavs of Bulgaria and Serbia saw Turkish rule as oppressive. The Bulgarians suffered the most, being crushed by the Turks. The Greeks, with their resources, managed to manipulate the Turks to their advantage. The Serbs were less affected due to their geography. Bulgaria, with a diverse population, faced annihilation and Turkish colonization. The Greeks controlled the Bulgarian Church, erasing Bulgarian identity. Russian influence grew as a defender of Orthodox Christians. Bulgaria's intellectual revival in the 19th century led to the establishment of schools and a push for emancipation. The ecclesiastical question was resolved in 1870 with the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate, freeing the Bulgarian Church from Greek control. This marked a step towards Bulgarian national identity and independence.|"['1.

During the 19th century, Bulgaria faced a series of revolutionary outbreaks that were harshly suppressed. In 1875, Stambulóv incited a notable uprising in solidarity with Montenegro, Hercegovina, and Bosnia. This led to the infamous Bulgarian massacres of 1876. Outraged, Europe pressured Constantinople for action. Midhat Pasha introduced the British constitution in Turkey, but Bulgaria's situation did not improve. Russia prepared for war, declaring it in 1877 alongside Prince Charles of Romania. The Russian and Romanian forces, aided by Bulgarian insurgents, made significant advances against the Turks. Despite initial victories, the Russians faced setbacks at Plevna but ultimately prevailed. The Treaty of San Stefano in 1878 created a Bulgarian principality, alarming other powers.

The initial Bulgarian Parliament convened in 1879 amidst challenging circumstances. The Treaty of Berlin had dashed both Russian and Bulgarian aspirations. Although Russian influence remained strong, the viceroy oversaw the administration. An ultra-democratic constitution was established, which proved unsuitable for the inexperienced Bulgarians. Prince Alexander of Battenberg, appointed ruler, struggled due to his lack of diplomatic finesse. Tensions with Russia grew, prompting him to briefly adopt dictatorial powers. The union of eastern Rumelia with Bulgaria further strained relations with Russia and Serbia, leading to conflict. Prince Alexander's reign was tumultuous, culminating in his forced abdication and eventual departure from Bulgaria. Stambulóv, a formidable figure, assumed control, implementing repressive measures to solidify his power. His fierce patriotism and ruthless tactics alienated Russia, setting the stage for a turbulent period in Bulgarian history.|['1.

Stambulóv's methods, though harsh, were deemed necessary to restore order. However, his tyrannical rule and delay in finding a prince led to his unpopularity and sparked revolutionary outbreaks. Eventually, Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg assumed the Bulgarian throne. Ferdinand, a skilled diplomat, faced opposition from Russia but gained support through his mother's influence and international connections. Under Ferdinand's rule, Bulgaria experienced significant progress, including railway development and economic growth. Ferdinand's increasing power and influence were recognized both at home and abroad. As tensions rose in the region, Ferdinand's ambitions clashed with those of other European powers. Ferdinand's strategic decisions, such as declaring Bulgaria's independence in 1908, further solidified his position as a key player in southeastern Europe.|"[""1.

The events in Bulgaria since 1908 revolve around the complex Macedonian question, which involves the territorial claims of Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece in the region of Macedonia. The dispute dates back to 1885 when eastern Rumelia united with northern Bulgaria, sparking territorial ambitions. Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece sought to influence the population in Macedonia to align with their national identities through propaganda and political maneuvering. The competition intensified as each country aimed to expand its sphere of influence. The rivalry was fueled by historical and ethnic claims, leading to tension and conflicts. Albania also played a role in the region, seeking to secure its borders against neighboring countries. The Macedonian Slavs, under Turkish rule, were influenced by Bulgarian missionaries, leading to a dispute over their national identity. The intricate web of territorial claims and influences in Macedonia created a volatile situation in the Balkans.|"['1.

The events leading up to 1908 regarding the Macedonian question can be summarized briefly. Russia and Austria-Hungary, the most involved nations, had divided the Balkans into their respective interests in the 18th century. In 1897, they agreed on a final settlement for Turkey, but it was never implemented due to the worsening chaos in Macedonia. Serious uprisings in 1902-3 raised concerns, leading to the appointment of Hilmi Pasha as Inspector-General in December 1902. In October 1903, the Emperors of Russia and Austria met at Mürzsteg to devise a reform plan known as the Mürzsteg program, which included an international gendarmerie. However, due to delays by the Porte and financial complexities, final negotiations were only completed in April 1907. Germany's policy of supporting Turkey's delays contributed to the chaos in Macedonia. The emergence of the Balkan League in response to the Young Turk revolution and the events leading to its formation were closely watched by Russia, who welcomed the League's formation as a means to counter the influence of Germanic powers in the region.|"[""1.

In the years leading up to 1912, Bulgaria experienced a period of relative calm, focusing on strengthening its military and improving its economy. Relations with neighboring Balkan States like Serbia and Montenegro improved, marked by visits between royal families. Agreements were made for the division of territories from Turkey in case of war. Celebrations in 1912 marked King Ferdinand's 25th year in Bulgaria, but were overshadowed by a massacre in Macedonia, fueling patriotism. By October 1912, Bulgaria, along with other Balkan States, declared war on Turkey to protect Christian populations. The Bulgarian army mobilized swiftly, engaging in battles and achieving significant victories against the Turkish forces. The siege of Adrianople was a key event, culminating in its surrender in March 1913. Subsequent negotiations in London led to the delineation of new boundaries, sparking tensions within the Balkan League and ultimately dissolving the alliance.|"['1.

The Balkan Wars of 1913 saw Bulgaria initiating conflict against Serbia, only to face defeat. The unexpected outcome led to Serbia's triumph in Macedonia. In response, the Turks reclaimed Adrianople, and Romania invaded Bulgaria from the north. The war concluded with Bulgaria ceding territories to Romania and losing central Macedonia. The Treaty of Bucarest in August granted Bulgaria parts of Thrace and eastern Macedonia but resulted in territorial losses. The Treaty of Constantinople signed in September allowed Turkey to keep Adrianople. The conflict between Bulgaria and Serbia, leading to the second Balkan War, had roots in political maneuvers rather than individual blame. The narrative also delves into the historical context of the Serbs and Croats, emphasizing their shared roots and recent efforts towards national unity.|"[""1.

"In the past, the Serb race faced challenges due to their fragmented political landscape. Divided into six regions, the Serbs lacked unity, unlike Bulgaria, which remained cohesive. Historical divisions, like the boundary drawn by Emperor Diocletian, separated the Serbs, hindering their solidarity. The geographical split between Serbs and Bulgars led to disputes over territories. The Macedonian region, once under Bulgarian and Serbian influences, saw a mix of Slavic populations. Albanian migrations further altered the demographic landscape. Despite periods of foreign rule, including Greek and Bulgarian dominance, the Serbs struggled to establish a defined territory. The Serbs were led by tribal chiefs and occasionally united under a ""veliki župan."" The Serbs' history, starting around A.D. 650, was marked by foreign control until A.D. 1196, with Greek emperors as nominal rulers. Bulgarian supremacy also influenced Serb territories."|"['1.

During the early centuries of Serbian history, the land was divided into small principalities that often quarreled among themselves. Attempts to form larger states, like those by Časlav and Bodin, were short-lived. The country was split into two main regions: the coastal Pomorje and the inland Zagorje. The Serbs interacted with neighboring powers like the Franks, Bulgars, and Magyars. Croatia became part of Hungary, while Venice gained control of coastal areas. Three political centers emerged: Raska, Zeta, and Bosnia. Bosnia remained independent and was influenced by both Constantinople and Hungary. The division between Roman Catholicism and Orthodoxy shaped the region's religious and political allegiances. The spread of Christianity was slow but significant, with the influence of Cyril and Methodius felt in the tenth century. The Bogomil heresy gained traction among the Serbs, challenging the authority of Constantinople and reflecting a sense of patriotism.|['1.

From 1168 onwards, the influence of the Serbs, particularly the central Serb state of Raska, expanded steadily. This growth culminated in the establishment of the powerful Nemanja dynasty, which played a pivotal role in shaping the most formidable state the Serb people had ever seen. The dynasty ruled continuously from 1168 to 1371, facing internal disputes and external pressures. The decline of Byzantium and the Greek Empire, along with the fragmentation of Bulgaria, allowed Serbia to expand its territory. However, Hungary posed a constant threat to Serbian lands. Despite conflicts, Venice maintained friendly relations with Serbia, fostering trade and cultural exchange. The Nemanja dynasty's early rulers, like Stephen, expanded southward and founded significant religious institutions. Stephen's son, Stephen Nemanjić, solidified Serbian independence from the Constantinople Patriarchate, laying the foundation for a national Serbian Church. The legacy of these early rulers, including Stephen Nemanjić and his brother Sava, contributed to the prosperity and stability of the Serbian Empire.|"['1.

During the reign of Stephen Uroš I, Serbia saw economic growth and improved internal administration. Despite no territorial gains in external affairs, he defeated a Bulgarian and Ragusan alliance. His son, Stephen Dragutin, succeeded him but faced setbacks in wars against Hungary and the Greeks. Stephen Uroš II, known as Milutin, took over in 1282, expanding Serbia's borders and developing its resources. His rule marked significant progress until his death in 1321. His son, Stephen Uroš III, or Stephen Dečanski, reigned until 1331, achieving victories against the Bulgarians and Greeks. His son, Stephen Dušan, became Serbia's greatest ruler, expanding its territories to Macedonia, Albania, and more.

In the 14th century, Serbia faced turmoil under Tsar Uroš, weak like his father. Disorders and rebellions plagued the empire, leading to its disintegration. The Turkish conquests posed a significant threat, culminating in the defeat of the Serbs at the Maritsa river in 1371. With the demise of Tsar Uroš, the Nemanja dynasty and the Serbian Empire fell. The heroic Marko Kraljević, ruling under Turkish control, fought valiantly. Despite setbacks, Prince Lazar led a reduced Serbia from Kruševac. The pivotal Battle of Kosovo Polje in 1389 marked the last united defense by Serbian armies, ultimately defeated by the Turks. Serbian alliances and conflicts with Hungary and the Turks continued, with shifting control over Belgrade and northern Serbia. The fall of Smederevo in 1459 marked the end of Serbian resistance against Turkish dominance.|"[""1.

During the late 15th century, the Serb lands faced turbulent times under Turkish rule. Bosnia, once an independent kingdom, fell to Turkish conquest in 1463 after the last king was captured and slain. Many Serbs fled to neighboring regions, while others embraced the faith of their conquerors to keep their lands. Hercegovina, previously part of Bosnia, gained independence in 1448 under Duke Stephen. In Zeta, the last independent Serb province, Ivan Crnojević established the first Serbian printing press in 1496 before it too succumbed to Turkish rule. Despite the hardships, the Serbs' widespread presence and mountainous terrain hindered complete Turkish control. Serb emigration to Dalmatia and Slavonia increased after the fall of Belgrade in 1521, establishing Serb colonies in southern Hungary and Croatia as a defense against Turkish incursions. Ragusa, a prosperous city-state, served as a trade hub and sanctuary for both Roman Catholic Croats and Orthodox Serbs, fostering Serbian literature and culture during the Middle Ages.|['1.

In 1787, Russia and Austria-Hungary formed an alliance to wage war against Turkey and share the spoils. Around the same time in 1788, Serbian patriots like Kara-George and Captain Koča led a rising against Turkey in Šumadija, Serbia. Despite this, Austria faced setbacks, leading to a peace treaty in 1790 where Turkey retained Bosnia and Serbia. Meanwhile, Montenegro, under Bishop Peter I, achieved victories against the Turks, securing independence. Serbia's struggle for freedom was hindered by its geographical isolation and internal conflicts. The Karagjorgjević and Obrenović families' feud impeded progress. Economic development was stifled by Austria-Hungary and Turkey's control, limiting Serbia's trade options. In 1804, Black George and Miloš Obrenović led a successful uprising against Turkish rule, liberating northern Serbia by 1807. Russia supported Serbia diplomatically during this period.|"['1.

In 1807, conflict erupted between Russia and Turkey. However, fighting ceased after the Peace of Tilsit in June 1807. During the subsequent peace years, disagreements arose among Serbian leaders. In 1809-10, Russia and the Serbs fought the Turks, initially facing setbacks but later achieving victories. Kara-George was elected as sovereign in 1811, yet Serbia remained a Turkish province. In 1812, Russia defeated the Turks, but due to Napoleon's invasion plans, a hurried peace treaty favored the Turks. The Serbs were promised autonomy but had to return captured towns. By 1813, the Turks invaded Serbia, regaining control. A rebellion led by Miloš Obrenović in 1815 resulted in Serbian independence efforts. Miloš's diplomatic skills led to successful negotiations with the Turks, securing Serbia's autonomy. Kara-George's return in 1817 ended tragically, leading to Miloš being elected as the hereditary prince. Meanwhile, significant events in Dalmatia and Montenegro impacted the Serb race's future.|"['1.

In 1805, the Treaty of Pressburg made Dalmatia part of France, but the Montenegrins resisted and took over Bocche with Russian support. However, at the Peace of Tilsit in 1807, Russia assigned this area to France, leading Montenegro to lose control. The French occupied Ragusa in 1806, abolishing its independence in 1808. In 1812, Montenegrins, aided by the Russians and British, expelled the French and regained Cattaro. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Austria took complete control of Dalmatia, excluding the Serb race from the Adriatic. Prince Miloš of Serbia faced challenges in securing recognition from the Porte and quelling revolts. The Greek revolution in 1821 shifted focus from the Serbian question. Russian intervention in Balkan affairs in 1826 led to the Akerman Convention, granting the Serbs internal autonomy and trade rights. Peace was achieved at Adrianople in 1829, recognizing Miloš as hereditary prince of Serbia. Serbia gained autonomy but remained tributary to the Sultan, excluding certain territories. Miloš's rule focused on church independence, trade promotion, and infrastructure development. Despite facing discontent, Miloš initially resisted sharing power but eventually conceded to a constitution in 1835. After several revolts and pressure from the Tsar and Sultan, Miloš agreed to a new constitution in 1839|['1.

The king, once popular, lost control after a war in 1885. In 1888, King Milan granted a more liberal constitution, but his failures led to his resignation in favor of his son Alexander, aged thirteen. Placed under a regency, Alexander faced domestic and political turmoil. In 1893, he declared himself of age, arresting his ministers the next year. German influence grew, leading to a change in the constitution. King Milan's return in 1897 fueled pro-Austrian sentiments. Alexander's impulsive marriage to Madame Draga caused unrest. Attempts at coalition failed, leading to a pro-Austrian period. The dynasty's discredit and financial disarray culminated in the June 10, 1903, assassination of King Alexander and his wife. The Obrenović dynasty's pro-Austrian stance and internal strife made the assassination, though cruel, a perceived necessity for Serbia's progress.|"[""1.

Serbia was left alone to spread its message from 1903 to 1908. Facing limited funds compared to Austria and Germany, Serbia's efforts weren't driven by greed. Belgrade, Serbia's capital, was lacking in allure due to past turmoil, leading to poverty and stagnation. Despite this, Serbia's propaganda for a Pan-Serb movement found success, especially in Bosnia, Hercegovina, and northern Macedonia. Simultaneously, the Serbo-Croat coalition made strides in Dalmatia, Croatia, and Slavonia. Austria's fear of Serbian influence prompted a new foreign policy. In 1908, Baron Achrenthal proposed a railway plan through Novi-Pazar, alarming Europe. Serbia and Montenegro reacted with a Danube-Adriatic railway project. The Young Turk revolution and Bulgaria's independence further stirred the Balkans. Europe was shocked by Bulgaria's independence and Austria's annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina, leading to a crisis. Serbia's response triggered an international uproar, while Austria's withdrawal from Novi-Pazar corridor dealt a blow to Serbia and Montenegro's ambitions.|"['Question 1: What was one of the main challenges faced by Serbia in its efforts to spread its message from 1903 to 1908?\nA) Lack of political support\nB) Limited funds compared to Austria and Germany\nC) Lack of interest from neighboring countries\nD) Excessive greed\nE) Abundance of resources', ""Question 2: Which region showed particular receptivity to Serbia's propaganda for a Pan-Serb movement?\nA) Romania\nB) Greece\nC) Albania\nD) Bosnia\nE) Italy"", ""Question 3: What prompted Austria to adopt a new foreign policy in response to Serbia's activities?\nA) Serbia's military aggression\nB) Serbia's economic prosperity\nC) Fear of Serbian influence\nD) Serbia's diplomatic isolation\nE) Serbia's cultural achievements"", ""Question 4: How did Serbia and Montenegro respond to Baron Achrenthal's proposed railway plan through Novi Pazar in 1908?\nA) They supported the plan enthusiastically\nB) They ignored the proposal\nC) They proposed a counter railway project\nD) They declared war on Austria\nE) They requested financial aid from Germany"", ""Question 5: What event further stirred the Balkans in addition to the Young Turk revolution?\nA) Greek independence\nB) Serbian civil war\nC) Albania's unification\nD) Bulgaria's independence\nE) Montenegro's secession"", ""Question 6: How did Austria's annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina impact the region?\nA) It led to economic prosperity\nB) It caused a political crisis\nC) It strengthened Serbia's influence\nD) It resulted in peaceful negotiations\nE) It had no significant impact""]"|"['B) Limited funds compared to Austria and Germany', 'D) Bosnia', 'C) Fear of Serbian influence', 'C) They proposed a counter railway project', ""D) Bulgaria's independence"", 'B) It caused a political crisis']"
In the winter of 1908-9, Serbia faced its lowest point. Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria's actions threatened Serbia's expansion plans. Serbia's army and treasury were ill-equipped for war. The annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina by Austria-Hungary left Serbia isolated. Internal strife grew in southern Slav provinces. The Croato-Serb coalition faced arrests, and a trial fueled nationalistic sentiments. Austria accused Serbia of conspiracies, leading to a libel trial. The trial exposed forgeries and discredited Count Achrenthal. Serbia's diplomatic skill and the recantation of claims to Bosnia saved its reputation. Crown Prince George renounced his rights, and a compromise resolved the crisis. The events showcased the importance of diplomatic finesse and the consequences of reckless actions in international relations.|"['1.

In 1911, significant events unfolded in the Balkans, hinting at impending changes. Serbia's military advancements were noted, preparing for potential shifts in the region. Austria-Hungary sensed Serbia's focus shifting towards Macedonia and the Aegean Sea. Meanwhile, the death of Count Aehrenthal in February and the subsequent reforms proposed by Count Berchtold for Macedonia stirred unease among Balkan nations. Agreements between Bulgaria and Greece, and Bulgaria and Serbia, were reached to delineate their areas of influence in Macedonia. Surprisingly, these agreements were made despite historical tensions between the nations. Bulgaria and Serbia agreed to split Macedonia, with Bulgaria gaining central Macedonia and Serbia acquiring northern Macedonia. The division left an undetermined zone, including Skoplje, for future arbitration. The Balkans were on the brink of change, with alliances forming and tensions rising, hinting at a turbulent future.|"['1.

In June 1913, a territorial dispute between Serbia and Bulgaria in Macedonia was arbitrated by the Tsar of Russia in St. Petersburg. Bulgaria, feeling shortchanged compared to Greece and Serbia, secretly amassed troops along its frontier to invade Macedonia. Tensions rose, leading Greece and Serbia to sign a military pact and prepare for a Bulgarian attack. Bulgaria launched a surprise assault on Serbia, resulting in a fierce battle where the Serbs eventually triumphed. Following a month-long campaign, Bulgaria succumbed to defeat. The Treaty of Bucharest in August 1913 solidified Serbia's control over northern and central Macedonia. The defeat of Bulgaria by Serbia and its allies boosted Serbian morale, while Germany and Austria-Hungary plotted revenge. Austria-Hungary later issued an ultimatum to Serbia over territorial issues, marking the end of the Balkan Wars' aftermath.|"[""1.

The Treaty of Bucarest was believed to bring peace, but in reality, it was a temporary measure. Serbia and Montenegro linked their territories, making it hard for invaders to pass through. Greece has a rich history, from ancient literature to modern trade. Ancient Greece thrived with art, science, and philosophy, but eventually faced internal conflicts. The rise of Rome marked the decline of Greek city-states, yet Rome embraced Hellenic culture, spreading it across its empire. However, the fall of Rome led to the decline of Hellenism, with invasions by Goths and the eventual shift westward. The Byzantine Empire in Constantinople tried to preserve Greek culture but faced internal decay. The history of Greece is a complex tapestry of triumphs and challenges, showing the resilience and evolution of a civilization over time.|"['1.

During the rise of Christianity, the Roman Empire faced a seismic shift. The Christian Church harnessed the essence of Hellenism, transforming Greek intellectuals into bishops. The Nicene Creed, a blend of ancient Greek philosophy and Christian beliefs, marked a pivotal moment. As Christianity gained strength, it clashed with the Imperial administration, ultimately becoming the official religion of the Empire under Emperor Constantine, who established Constantinople. Meanwhile, the once-thriving Hellenistic culture faced challenges from within and without. The rise of Islam in the East led to the political and cultural separation of regions like Syria and Egypt from Greek influence. Concurrently, Slavic migrations from the north reshaped the European landscape, engulfing the Greek race. The Slavs left their mark, with Slavonic names still dotting the villages and landmarks of European Greece.|['1.

By the middle of the ninth century A.D., the Imperial Government had restored order in the Peloponnesos. Three distinct groups existed in the region. Most of the people were loyal Christian subjects known as 'Romaioi'. However, two Slavonic tribes in the hilly areas and the communities in Tainaron, now Maina, still worshipped pagan gods like Zeus and Athena. The 'Romaioi' were the future, speaking a language called 'Romaikà', derived from Ancient Greek. This language had evolved from the 'koinè' dialect used in the Septuagint and the New Testament. The Romaic language had shifted from a pitch-accent to a stress-accent, akin to English. This linguistic change also influenced the development of a new poetic technique based on accent and rhyme. Additionally, the Romaioi were influenced by the Orthodox Church, which preserved Ancient Greek literature and traditions.|"[""1.

During the medieval period, the Romaic Greek race flourished within the boundaries of the Byzantine Empire. The Slavic population had either been assimilated or expelled south of a line connecting Avlona to Salonika. The empire maintained control over parts of Europe east of Salonika, including key ports and a military highway connecting them to Constantinople. However, beyond the Bosphorus, the empire's reach extended into Anatolia up to Taurus and Euphrates, becoming the focal point of the Romaic state and nation. A new Greek nation emerged, interacting with previously unknown neighbors like Armenians and Arabs. The Bulgarians to the north had absorbed Latin-speaking provincials and Rumans, while the Serbs in the Morava basin embraced Orthodoxy. The Romaic Empire expanded under Emperor Nikiphóros Phokas and Basil, subduing Arab pirates and the Bulgarian kingdom. Despite cultural and political advantages, the Romaic Empire faced a setback when Seljuk Turks defeated them at the battle of Melasgerd in 1071, leading to Turkish dominance in Anatolia and the decline of Romaic culture.|"['1.

The fall of Constantinople in A.D. 1204 marked the beginning of the end for the Byzantine Empire. The city was besieged by a Venetian fleet and a crusading army, leading to the destruction of many treasures of Ancient Hellenism. The Empire dissolved into chaos, with Italian trading cities like Venice and Genoa seizing control of the Mediterranean. Latin dominion was short-lived in Constantinople but lasted longer in southern European provinces. Anarchy prevailed with Burgundian barons, Catalan mercenaries, and Florentine bankers vying for power. The Balkan peninsula saw social upheaval with Bulgars reconstituting their kingdom, Vlachs moving into Thessalian plains, and Albanians asserting their dominance. The Seljuk sultanate in Anatolia gave way to the rise of the Ottoman Empire, which rapidly expanded into Europe, culminating in the fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the consolidation of Ottoman power in southeastern Europe.|['1.

During the Dark Age, Greece faced a desperate situation when Constantinople was depopulated by Mohammed II to make way for a Turkish majority from Anatolia. This influx of Turkish settlers, along with the arrival of Sephardim Jews expelled from Spain, posed challenges for the Greek population. The Greeks, already burdened by oppressive taxes and military conscription, saw their vitality drained under Ottoman rule. The Ottoman military system, including the Janissaries who were forcibly recruited from Greek families, further weakened the Greek population. However, as the Ottoman Empire began to decline in the 17th century, the Greek peasantry found some relief.

The janissaries, originally a celibate Christian tribute-children army, changed in 1566 to allow marriage and recruitment of their sons, evolving into a hereditary urban militia. They barred Christian recruits by 1676, becoming a privileged urban class. Western Europe's centralization influence reached the Ottoman Empire in the 17th century. The Köprili brothers modernized administration, relying on Greek officials. Greek officials from Khios filled key roles, expanding to voivodes in Moldavia and Wallachia. The Phanariot aristocracy, allied with the Orthodox Church, gained political power. Mustapha Köprili's New Ordinance in 1691 expanded Christian rights. Ottoman defeats led to territorial losses to Christian neighbors like Venice and Austria. Russia emerged as a powerful Orthodox adversary, aiding Greek interests and securing rights for Ottoman Greeks through treaties.|"['1.

By the late 18th century, the situation of the Greeks had notably improved. French and English travelers visiting the Ottoman Empire believed a significant internal change was imminent. The Napoleonic wars had ended the Venetian Republic and involved the Ionian Islands in the conflict between England and France for control of the Mediterranean. England and France fortified themselves on different islands, while Ali Pasha of Yannina maintained a powerful neutrality on the mainland. Ali governed the region with almost royal authority, impacting the Greek population. His rule reflected a shift from old traditions to new ways. Ali's administration was notably Greek in nature, with Greek being the language of business in his capital city, Yannina. The rise of a new Greek middle class, influenced by Western Europe, was evident in the city's prosperity and intellectual growth. Greek culture had long been secluded in monasteries, but a resurgence of intellectual activity was seen, breaking away from medieval influences. The Greeks abroad, involved in trade, brought back new ideas and economic growth, leading to a national revival. The commercial and intellectual activities of the Greeks abroad influenced those back home, leading to a resurgence in Greek identity and prosperity.|"['1.

In the early 19th century, the Greeks were building small ships for trade, navigating them skillfully in the Mediterranean. Their economy relied on cooperation among sailors, captains, and ship owners, who shared profits. However, politically, an oligarchical system was in place with an executive council elected by ship owners. Feuds and intrigue were common, but the Greek islands were on the brink of a new national awakening. Greek colonies worldwide were flourishing, and a sense of Greek identity was strong among various groups. The desire to liberate Greece from Ottoman rule led to the formation of a secret society called the 'Philikì Hetairía.' The revolution began in 1821 when the Greeks rebelled, starting in Peloponnesos and spreading rapidly, marking the successful beginning of the Greek War of Independence.|['1.

In 1821, the Greek islands' merchant marine faced losses due to the fall of Napoleon and the Vienna settlement. This changed with the revolution, as privateering fleets from Hydhra, Spetza, and Psarà set sail, quickly ridding Samos of Turkish control. The Ottoman squadron, attempting to retaliate, was thwarted by the islanders. Psariots, inspired by Russian tactics, used fire-ships to defeat a Turkish vessel. Despite initial successes, the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud regained control, quelling uprisings and preventing widespread revolt. Rebellion spread to mainland Greece, with towns like Galaxídhi and Mesolonghi joining the cause. However, the movement faced setbacks in Athens, Negrepont, and Agrapha. The revolution was contained within Greece, with naval battles resulting in devastating losses for Greek towns like Kydhonies and Khios. By 1823, the revolution was limited to its birthplace.|"[""1.

During 1821, Sultan Mahmud successfully isolated a region to maintain the Ottoman Empire's Moslem ascendancy. In February 1822, Yannina fell to the Ottoman forces, leading to the demise of Ali and the disbandment of his troops. This victory allowed for a counterattack on Peloponnesos. Khurshid's army broke camp at Lárissa in April, and Dramali led a new expedition southward. By July, Dramali crossed the Sperkheiòs with an army of twenty thousand men. Despite Athens capitulating and the surrender of northeastern Greece, the Greeks under Kolokotrónis fought back. Dramali's supplies dwindled, and his attempts to break through were thwarted. Eventually, the Turkish army weakened, leading to Dramali's death at Korinth and Khurshid's execution. Nauplia fell in December, marking a significant victory for the Greeks. Meanwhile, in the northwest, the Suliots faced challenges, aligning with the Greeks after Ali's downfall. The struggle in 1823 seemed to reach a stalemate, emphasizing the deadlock between the Ottoman Empire and the Greek revolutionaries. The intervention of a third party or self-destruction among the Greeks appeared necessary to break the impasse.|"['1.

The new house of Hellenism quickly became divided soon after its rise. The national movement's strength lay in local communes that found fighters, armed them, and expelled the Turks from Peloponnesos through collaboration. However, to sustain this cooperation, a central organization was needed, leading to conflicts. In 1821, a 'Peloponnesian Senate' formed, dominated by the 'Primates', the wealthy class controlling communal governance. Phanariot princes like Alexander Mavrokordatos and Demetrius joined, advocating European political theories. A 'National Assembly' convened in 1821, electing Mavrokordatos as the Hellenic Republic's first president. Internal strife persisted, with the Peloponnesian Senate opposing the National Government. European 'Philhellenes' arrived in 1823 amid political turmoil. Civil war erupted, with Kolokotrónis facing off against the Primates. Sultan Mahmud sought aid from Mohammed Ali Pasha to reclaim Peloponnesos. Ibrahim's forces, backed by Egypt, overpowered the Greeks, seizing territory by 1825.|"['1.

In 1826, Mesolonghi faced a final Ottoman siege. The Greeks valiantly defended their city against the Ottoman army. The Greek and Ottoman fleets played a crucial role in the conflict. Ibrahim's arrival in 1827 marked a turning point. His forces bombarded the city, leading to its surrender. Despite a brave sortie by the garrison, Mesolonghi fell. The situation worsened as Ibrahim advanced, ravaging the land. Athens faced a siege in June. The Greek cause seemed bleak, with defeats and betrayals. However, in 1827, allied powers intervened to pacify Greece. A naval battle at Navarino Bay further shifted the tides. By 1829, a new Greek frontier was established. Despite challenges, the Greeks persevered, eventually leading to the assassination of President Kapodistrias in 1831.|"[""1.

Greece faced chaos as different factions fought for power through violent means. Eventually, realizing the need for a stable government, the three powers decided on a monarchy and offered the crown to Prince Otto of Bavaria in 1832. However, negotiations dragged on, and it wasn't until 1833 that Otto arrived in Greece with support from allies. Despite the establishment of the kingdom of Hellas, disappointment lingered as the new state struggled with foreign administration and failed to unite the Greek population fully. The early years of the kingdom saw little progress, with financial instability, bureaucratic challenges, and ongoing issues with brigandage. Successive rulers faced difficulties, leading to a sense of disillusionment among the Greek people. The kingdom's failure to fully liberate the Greek race from Ottoman rule and address internal issues hindered its ability to fulfill its mission effectively.|"['1.

Until a nation secures its right to exist fully, it struggles to establish a fulfilling life. In western Europe, before facing adversity, existence was taken for granted, with politics focusing on improving the internal economy. However, a foreigner reading a Greek newspaper would find discussions on foreign politics dominating, unlike the financial and economic issues familiar in their own country. The intense conversations revolved around international power balance, unlike the internal economic matters of Englishmen. The nation's main public utility was the army, necessary for survival but maintained poorly due to national poverty. Public infrastructure like railways and roads were lacking, hindering economic growth. Greece's focus on future aspirations of national unity and self-government overshadowed addressing present deficiencies, leading to a struggle between the parties advocating for the present and the future.|"['1.

"In 1906, a man named Venezelos emerged in Krete, becoming a key figure in the fight for constitutionalism. His role in the successful 1906 revolution showcased his leadership. He later joined Zaimis' government and opposed premature unionist movements while advocating for national unity. Venezelos' close ties with the Greek kingdom led to his appointment to restore order. He dissolved the Military League and ushered in a new era of Greek governance. Venezelos' popularity surged, leading to a sweeping victory in the 1912 elections, despite opposition attempts to undermine him.

Venezelos focused on rebuilding the country internally, following Trikoupis' lead. However, he remained committed to the national cause. With the help of French and British missions, the army and navy were reorganized, preparing for the right moment. In 1912, Turkey was weakened by a year-long war with Italy, creating an opportunity for the Balkan nations to act. The Balkan League, comprising Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria, joined forces. Despite past conflicts, Serbia and Montenegro united easily. However, Greece and Bulgaria had overlapping claims. Venezelos skillfully negotiated an alliance with Bulgaria without specific territorial demands. The Balkan allies launched a successful campaign against Turkey, leading to the Treaty of London in 1913, where Turkey ceded its European territories to the Balkan League. Greece and Bulgaria then had to divide the gained territories, with Venezelos proposing a fair division.|"[""1.

The main population in Salonika is not Greek or Bulgarian but around 80,000 Spanish-speaking Jews who settled in Turkey as refugees in the 16th century. Despite Venezelos' conciliatory proposals, Bulgaria's refusal led to conflict. The Bulgarian government demanded Salonika after gaining Thrace, causing tensions. Fighting near the Struma River in May escalated the situation. Bulgaria's treacherous attack on its allies in June 1913 resulted in war with Greece and Serbia. The Treaty of Bucarest marked the end of the conflict, with Greece making territorial concessions. Venezelos proposed leaving Bulgaria a coastal zone for a southern outlet. However, King Constantine's ambitions led to further border disputes. The unresolved issue of Kavala hinders Greece's national consolidation and internal development.

The paragraph above reveals its own age, as it was written before Bulgaria sided with the Central Powers, halting hopes for a resolution based on mutual agreement. The Greek nation faces new internal challenges due to outstanding issues linked to the European conflict. The integrity of land-frontiers involves struggles with neighboring nations, while islands can easily shift political allegiances based on sea-power dynamics. The arrival of the _Goeben_ and _Breslau_ at the Dardanelles in 1914 reignited questions about Aegean islands. Greece occupied various islands during the war, with most assigned to Greece except for Imbros and Tenedos. The status of Mitylini and Khios remains unresolved, with Greece and Turkey at odds over their sovereignty.

Greece has aspirations for the islands occupied by Italy during the war with Turkey in 1911-12, known as the Sporades. Italy kept them as a pledge until the last Ottoman soldier in Tripoli left. The Treaty of Lausanne was affected by the European War, simplifying the status of the Sporades. The people on these islands are Greek and wish to unite with Greece. However, Italy's interests in Anatolia might lead to the retention of the islands. Similarly, Cyprus, with a Greek-speaking population, desires union with Greece. Despite British control, the island's inhabitants seek national unity. Greek nationalism is a strong force driving populations of Greek descent towards political unity. The Epirots, of Albanian descent, turned to Greek culture for civilization, showcasing the enduring power of Hellenism.|['1.

For the Epirot child, attending school is a gateway to the future. Learning the language there not only connects them to their nation but also opens up a world full of opportunities where their talents and energy can thrive. Whether seeking success in cities like Patras or Peiraeus, or within the vibrant Greek communities of Alexandria and Constantinople, education provides a bridge to broader horizons. Even if they choose to stay in their hometown, education links them to the wider European culture through Greek newspapers. By embracing Greek culture, the Epirot child embodies the spirit of Hellenism, equating it with their sense of nationality. The arrival of Greek troops in Epirus in 1913 marked a turning point, bringing security and hope after enduring attacks from neighboring communities. Despite external pressures, the Epirots stood up for their rights, securing a degree of autonomy and recognition for their language and heritage. Through resilience and determination, the Epirots paved their own path towards a brighter future, free from the turmoil that plagued neighboring regions.|['1.

The revival of Greek national pride, particularly in Epirus, is a significant achievement, showcasing the vitality of modern Hellenism. While some in Western Europe may belittle this resurgence, claiming it lacks the grandeur of ancient Greek culture, the reality is that modern Hellenism has its own vigor. It adeptly absorbs diverse influences, motivating others to embrace its ideals. The assimilation is evident in various regions, like Albanian enclaves in central Greece and the Peloponnese, where villagers now identify as Greek. The Vlachs, once nomadic shepherds, are transitioning to settled life in Greek villages, signifying a shift towards a more advanced social structure. Even in Cappadocia, where Greek culture was submerged centuries ago, a resurgence is palpable with the establishment of Greek schools. This resurgence, guided by leaders like Venezelos, aims for a unified Greek state, a goal that is now within reach. However, while political unity is crucial, the true measure of a nation lies in its ideals and achievements. The Greek revival faces challenges, including strained relations with Balkan neighbors due to historical disputes. Economic prosperity is a key focus, with newly acquired territories offering opportunities for growth, especially in sectors like tobacco, timber, and mining. To truly thrive, Greece must look beyond its borders and form economic partnerships with neighboring countries, creating a unified economic entity in the Balkans that transcends political boundaries.|"['1.

Central Europe and southeastern Europe are closely linked economically. The industries in central Europe will increasingly use raw materials from the southeast, while the southeast will import more manufactured goods from central Europe to develop its resources. This economic connection will lead to intense negotiations between the two regions. Cooperation is crucial for the Balkan States' future prosperity. Without working together, they risk being economically dominated by Vienna and Berlin. To avoid subjugation, the Balkan nations must form a Balkan zollverein, a customs union. This union should evolve into a federation to ensure they can negotiate with stronger neighbors on equal terms. Balkan nationalism must evolve to support this cooperation and prevent economic and political subjugation. The influence of American immigrants returning with new perspectives and wealth from the United States is already reshaping the region, offering hope for a brighter future through collaboration and unity.|"[""1.

In ancient times, the region now known as Romania was a land of diverse tribes. The Thracians and Illyrians conquered the northern Balkans around the 5th century B.C. Among these tribes were the Dacians, who settled in present-day Oltenia, Banat, and Transylvania. The Dacian Empire expanded until it bordered the Roman Empire. Emperor Trajan led successful campaigns against the Dacians, bringing Dacia under Roman rule in A.D. 106. The Roman province of Dacia Felix flourished under Roman civilization. However, barbarian invasions led to the Roman legions' retreat in A.D. 271. Goth, Hun, and Avar invasions followed, causing the Daco-Roman population to seek refuge in the Carpathian Mountains, away from the marauding hordes. Despite these tumultuous times, the Daco-Roman population maintained its distinct identity and language, largely unaffected by the invaders' presence.|"[""1.

When the Slavs arrived in the Balkan peninsula around the early seventh century, significant changes occurred in the ethnic landscape along the Danube. The Rumanians were separated from the Romans due to the Slav occupation of Roman provinces between the Adriatic and the Black Sea. Those not lost during Avar raids were either captured or forced to migrate south towards modern Macedonia and north towards the Dacian regions. Parts of Rumania fell under the influence of the Bulgarians, a Turanian people who established a state between the Balkans and the Danube in 679. The Hungarian arrival at the end of the ninth century ended Bulgarian dominance in Dacia. Despite some Rumanian duchies being subdued, the ‘land of the Vlakhs’ in Transylvania maintained a degree of autonomy under Hungarian rule. The Hungarians had minimal ethnological influence on the Rumanian population, preserving their race and language purity.|"['1.

The story of Moldavia's founding is steeped in legend. Dragosh, while hunting a bison, stumbled upon a breathtaking view of Moldavia at sunset. Moved by its beauty, he decided to establish a state there. Moldavia's banner bears the head of a wild bison to commemorate this event. The political landscape in Moldavia was shaped by the invasion of the Tartars, which wiped out existing political structures. Immigrants from Transylvania, mainly nobles, imposed their authority on the native population. This led to the mass population falling into servitude. The nobles strengthened their class's dominance in the newly founded states. The Rumanians played a crucial role in European history by resisting the Ottoman invasion, contributing to the security that enabled western civilization's development. Notable figures like Mircea the Old and Vlad the Impaler fought bravely against Turkish domination, with Mircea facing defeats and Vlad ultimately succumbing to internal strife. Stephen the Great fought for Moldavia's independence, achieving a significant victory at Racova in 1475 against the Ottomans.|"['1.

During the reign of Stephen, Moldavia and Wallachia were under Turkish control. John the Terrible of Moldavia refused to pay tribute to the Turks, leading to battles where he was ultimately defeated. Michael the Brave, the Prince of Muntenia, fought against Turkish aggression, successfully uniting the Romanian lands under his rule. However, he was betrayed and killed by various enemies. The succession system, where princes were selected by nobility and clergy, led to corruption and Turkish domination. The agricultural people suffered economically due to high taxes and land confiscation. The nobles faced coercive treatment from the princes. The Phanariotes, Greek merchants, gained power through auctions in Constantinople. The Romanian princes sought support from Russia against the Ottomans, but their joint military action failed. The threat of Turkish control led the nobles and people to consider leaving the country. Ultimately, the Romanian people welcomed Nicholas Mavrocordato as the first Phanariote ruler of Moldavia in 1711.|"[""1.

During the Phanariote period, foreign language skills helped them secure diplomatic roles in Constantinople. In return, they gained control of the Rumanian principalities. The princes had to pay for their positions and were often moved between provinces to maximize profits. The princes heavily taxed the people, leading to great suffering. The Phanariotes ruled with corruption and luxury, hindering the country's progress. Russian influence grew, posing a threat to the Rumanian nation. The Greek revolution in 1821 was initially supported by Rumania but faced opposition due to fears of Greek dominance. Russian intervention in 1828 brought relief from Turkish oppression. The Treaty of Adrianople in 1829 limited Turkish influence and established Russian protection. The provinces remained under Russian military control until 1834, reflecting Russia's aim to dominate the region.|['1.

French culture had a significant impact on the Romanian principalities during the Russian occupation. The Phanariote princes, serving as dragomans of the Porte, introduced French culture by employing French secretaries and tutors. This influence was further enhanced by the pre-eminence of French culture in Russia at the time. The younger generation, influenced by French civilization, sought new forms of political life and civilization in Paris. The Treaty of Adrianople opening the Black Sea to all nations facilitated economic growth by providing an outlet for agricultural produce. The Romanian Renascence, sparked by the 1848 revolution, led to a national awakening and a desire for freedom from oppressive influences. Despite setbacks, the movement towards union of the principalities gained momentum, supported by Napoleon III and opposed by Austria and Turkey. Ultimately, a compromise was reached in 1857, leading to new elections and a call for the union of the principalities under a native prince.|['1.

The Rumanians had clear wishes for progress, but Europe delayed action in 1856 for peace. In 1858, a Paris Congress resulted in the 'United Principalities' with shared laws and military but separate governance. Colonel Cuza was elected in Moldavia, and later in Wallachia, uniting the states under one leader. This move led to Rumania's recognition in 1861. Cuza introduced laws like free education and universal suffrage. His reforms faced opposition, leading to his abdication in 1866. Cuza's focus on land reform and secularization of monastic lands sparked debate. Peasants, once free landowners, faced increasing burdens under feudal lords. The Rural Law of 1864 aimed to address these issues, but it stirred political unrest ultimately leading to Cuza's downfall.|"[""1.

During Turkish rule, the Romanian provinces were vital for the Ottoman Empire's food supply. Land values and taxes increased, burdening peasant owners who often had to give up land while boyards sought more. Boyards obtained permission to increase labor dues and control daily work hours. Legislation in the 18th century allowed lords to reserve a portion of the estate, reducing peasants' land. A law in 1864 made peasants full owners of their holdings, but problems persisted. Peasants lost land rights and had to pay for pasturage. Labor dues were abolished, but landowners received compensation. These reforms mostly benefited the upper class, leaving younger peasants vulnerable. Peasant uprisings and land distributions occurred due to economic hardships. Legislation aimed at protecting peasants but faced challenges due to social circumstances.|['1.

Numerous solutions have been proposed for the challenges faced. It is evident that a resolution is attainable. One argument is based on official data indicating that peasants had only 91 days of work in 1905. The proposal suggests that introducing circulating capital and new activities can instigate a transformation. Although the remedy may be debatable, the author is correct in pointing out that the country is currently controlled by an agrarian class. Their power lies in land ownership, the nation's primary asset. Introducing circulating capital could lead to the loss of this unique wealth and the decline of its owners. This fundamental issue hinders progress on the rural matter. The population, despite compulsory education, remains largely illiterate due to inadequate educational funding. The majority are excluded from the country's political and social life, perpetuating a system benefiting only a select few.|['1.

Prince Carol, being new to the throne, did not have much influence when a very liberal constitution was passed shortly after he became king. The constitution, similar to Belgium's, was created by an elected assembly and is still in effect today. It gives executive power to the king and his ministers, with the legislative power held by the king and two assemblies—a senate and a chamber. The budget and army strength bills must be approved by the Chamber. The king has the authority to convene, adjourn, and dissolve parliament, promulgate laws, and veto bills. The constitution guarantees rights like freedom of the press, assembly, and religion, and equal rights for all citizens. Education is free and compulsory in state schools. Military service is mandatory, and capital punishment is only for military offenses in wartime. The state religion is Greek Orthodox, and the clergy are state officials. Religious matters are overseen by the Holy Synod of Bucarest. Throughout history, religion has not played a significant role in Romanian life, mainly due to foreign clergy and external practices.|['1.

Although Prince Carol faced many challenges, he always followed the constitutional path and did not allow his opponents to question his integrity. He used his origin and family alliances to gain respect from his new subjects. To instill discipline, he energetically organized the army, ensuring security from internal and external threats. Rumanian political parties initially supported different candidates for the throne, but eventually divided over internal reforms. The Liberals pushed for ambitious changes, while the Conservatives aimed to maintain a sense of reality. Despite facing opposition and political instability, Prince Carol persevered, maintaining unity amid conflicting ideologies. His decision to abdicate due to internal strife was met with strong opposition, but he ultimately continued to reign with increasing respect and influence. The Rumanian political system, resembling that of Spain, allowed the king to play a crucial role in maintaining stability and guiding the country's progress.|"['1.

In the absence of direct successors, Prince Ferdinand became the Heir Apparent to the Romanian throne as per the constitution. He married Princess Marie of Coburg and later became King Ferdinand I after King Carol's passing in 1914. However, internal politics faced challenges with parties focusing more on personal agendas than principles. The peasant question was largely overlooked. King Carol's diplomatic skills and strategic alliances strengthened Romania's position internationally. Despite territorial losses to Austria and Russia, Romania's strategic location deterred individual attacks. Prince Carol's accession brought attention to Romania, leading to improved foreign relations. His influence ensured Romania's status on the global stage, with other sovereigns recognizing his significance. Romania's foreign policy post-1866 largely reflected King Carol's vision for the country, guided by its best interests.|"[""1.

Prince Carol of Rumania was a staunch advocate of strengthening German influence in his new realm. He believed in the future of Rumania and saw no threat from Germany. He also aimed to foster closer ties with Russia, considering them a potential ally or adversary. Despite initial French support, Prince Carol faced challenges from French diplomats. Bismarck's advice led to a shift in alliances, with Austria emerging as a potential partner. Prince Carol sought to break free from Turkish control, aligning with Russia for support. As tensions rose in the Balkans, Prince Carol navigated diplomatic complexities, ultimately forging an alliance with Russia in 1877. This move was met with opposition from other major powers, but Prince Carol remained resolute in securing Rumania's independence.|"[""1.

In 1878, Russia recognized Romania's independence through the Treaty of San Stefano. However, Russia aimed to exchange territories, including Dobrudja and the Danube delta, for parts of Bessarabia. Despite Romania's assistance in the campaign, Russia's promises were not fulfilled. At the Berlin Congress, concerns arose about Romania's future. England expressed sympathy but prioritized other interests, leading to Romania losing Bessarabia. The Congress made Romania's independence contingent on internal changes, including Jewish emancipation. Romania faced hardships but secured independence in 1880. Russia's actions strained relations, prompting Romania to seek alliances elsewhere. Russia's shortsighted policy in Bessarabia led to missed opportunities and increased Austria-Hungary's influence. Romania's foreign policy shifted to balance relations with dominant powers in the region.|"['1.

During the 1870s, Germany showed animosity towards Romania, which puzzled Prince Carol's father. The German Emperor was genuinely surprised by this, indicating that Bismarck had not fully informed him. When Sturdza met with Bismarck, it became clear that Romania could not rely on Russia. Bismarck suggested Romania seek protection from France and Germany due to her vulnerable position between Russia and the new Slav state. King Carol later accepted a defensive alliance with Austria in 1883. Despite internal discrepancies, Romania aligned with the Central Powers due to German influence and King Carol's belief in following Germany for peace and development. The Balkan League's rise in 1912 to break from the Ottoman Empire was supported by King Carol, who sought Balkan independence. Romania remained neutral during the Balkan Wars but later demanded territorial considerations regarding the Dobrudja frontier from Bulgaria.|"[""1.

The Balkan League's formation and the fall of Turkey dealt a blow to the Central Powers' peaceful penetration policy. The Balkan states faced tensions due to conflicting interests. Austria blocked Serbia's access to the Adriatic Sea, leading Serbia to ally with Greece against Bulgaria. Despite Rumania's initial refusal to join, they later advanced towards Sofia when Bulgaria attacked. The Balkan premiers met in Bucarest to negotiate peace terms. Cholera outbreaks and great power interests complicated the situation. The Treaty of Bucarest was signed, with Rumania gaining territory to secure against Bulgaria. This treaty marked a significant moment of peace and harmony among the Balkan peoples. Rumania shifted alliances towards Russia to counter German influence in Bulgaria. The Rumanian population outside its borders maintained its nationality despite political influences. Bucovina faced Germanization and Slavic influence, but the Rumanian identity remained strong.|"[""1.

The history of the Rumanians in Transylvania is marked by struggles against Hungarian oppression. Despite desperate uprisings, the Rumanian peasantry faced serfdom due to the loss of autonomy. The Magyars, failing to gain independence from Austria, turned to assimilating nationalities through political and national oppression. Hungarian became compulsory, and ‘State’ schools enforced Hungarian-only policies, even in Rumanian villages. Electoral regulations favored Magyars, and press laws were biased against Rumanians. Grievances led to a failed 1892 memorandum and imprisonment of Rumanian representatives. Despite hardships, Rumanians in Transylvania developed a strong middle class through commerce and professions. The clergy provided moral support, and the national struggle united the classes. Detached from Austria-Hungary after the Peace of Bucarest, the Rumanians in Hungary formed a vital part of the Rumanian nation.|"['1.

In the summer of 1914, Rumania found itself in a whirlwind of unexpected possibilities and anxieties due to the unfolding crisis. Previously distant hopes and fears suddenly became tangible realities. Rumania, still adjusting to its shifting alliances with Austria and Russia, faced conflicting influences. While a strong bond with France existed, Germany's military might posed a significant concern. The idea of siding with France clashed with the allure of German financial power. Sympathy for Serbia was juxtaposed with suspicion of Bulgaria. Amidst these tensions, the prospect of reclaiming Rumanian territories under foreign rule emerged as a pivotal opportunity. Rumania grappled with the choices of neutrality, aligning with the Central Powers, or joining the Triple Entente.

In the realm of practical politics, Romania's stance in the conflict will dictate its wisdom. However, it's crucial to touch upon the moral dimension of their choices. By acknowledging the unspoken plea from Transylvania, Romania could have invigorated its national spirit, fostering a readiness for necessary sacrifices. Many Transylvanians gazed longingly at the Carpathians, torn from their homeland to fight for their oppressors. Yet, the Romanian leaders remained oblivious, neglecting the common will and aspirations crucial for national vitality. The sentiment that politics should be devoid of moral considerations is untenable in a nation striving to fulfill its national aspirations. Romania's claim to Transylvania rests on the numerical superiority of Romanian inhabitants there and the unjust treatment they endure from the Magyars. Romania's passive approach sacrifices national unity for territorial gains, jeopardizing its future autonomy in international affairs.|"[""1.

Turkey is not the most fitting name for the Osmanli dominion or any part of it, just as Normandy would not be for Great Britain. It is an old-fashioned name that has been used for a long time by people outside the region, but it is not what the Osmanlis themselves would call it. The true ‘Turkey’ is actually Turkestan, and the real Turks are the Turcomans. The Osmanlis are not the typical Turks. Only a small number of them have Turkish ancestry, and it is hardly noticeable in their appearance. The Osmanlis are quite different from the original Turks who lived in Turkestan. The Turks we hear about first came from Chinese sources and were strong inhabitants of the Altai plains and valleys. They later settled in Turkestan and started moving towards the west. By the sixth century A.D., they had embraced Islam and spread towards the Caspian Sea. This was the westernmost extent of Turkish expansion in large numbers. The Turks who migrated from there into Asia Minor did so in small groups, either as nomads looking for new pastures or as military groups seeking opportunities. The Seljuks were one such group that made a lasting impact by establishing a kingdom in Asia Minor that lasted for about two centuries. Their forces, made up of professional soldiers, were stronger than the Byzantine troops in the area and were supported by native Christians who found their rule more favorable than that of the Byzantine emperors|"['1.

In the early days, a small group of nomadic adventurers from the Turks settled in Persia ventured into Asia Minor seeking new lands west of the Euphrates. Legends surround the arrival of these Turks, believed to be only around four hundred families. They journeyed from Erzerum through Armenia, hoping to find fertile unclaimed territories. The Byzantine influence was weak, with Constantinople under Latin rule. The Turks settled on the north-western edge of the Seljuk territory near Nicaea. As the Seljuk kingdom weakened, the Turks under Ertogrul were poised to expand their influence. Ertogrul, later succeeded by Osman, forged alliances with Greek feudal lords, blending Turk and Greek cultures. Osman established the Ottoman dynasty, recruiting soldiers from Greek and Christian backgrounds. Under Orkhan's rule, the Ottomans expanded, capturing Nicomedia and Nicaea, forming a self-sufficient state. The blend of Turk and Greek cultures became the foundation of the Ottoman Empire, which grew to rival the Byzantine Empire in the region.|['1.

If the new state wanted to grow through conquest, its path was already shown. Currently, it couldn't move back into Asia Minor, since it was held by Muslim territories approved by the same tradition as itself, the Seljuk power. To attack them would be against Islam. However, ahead was a wealthy but fragile Christian nation, the heart of the culture to which the popular part of the Osmanli society belonged. Just as the state of Nicaea transitioned to Constantinople, the Osmanli state of Brusa also aimed for this. An invitation from John Cantacuzene in 1345 and later from Orkhan's son, Suleiman, led to the first Osmanli crossing into Europe. These invitations diverted the Ottoman forces, delaying the fall of Constantinople. The Osmanlis got entangled in Balkan conflicts, battling the Serbs and others, instead of focusing on the Greeks. These diversions prolonged the Ottoman-Greek conflict until Timur's intervention.|"['Question 1: Why did the new state avoid moving back into Asia Minor?\nA) It was held by Muslim territories\nB) It was against Islam\nC) It was too far away\nD) It was not wealthy\nE) It was not strategically important', 'Question 2: Who extended an invitation to the Osmanlis in 1345?\nA) Timur\nB) Suleiman\nC) John Cantacuzene\nD) Orkhan\nE) Constantinople', ""Question 3: What delayed the fall of Constantinople?\nA) Muslim territories\nB) Balkan conflicts\nC) Timur's intervention\nD) Osmanli conquests\nE) Invitations from John Cantacuzene and Suleiman"", 'Question 4: What did the Osmanlis get entangled in instead of focusing on the Greeks?\nA) Muslim territories\nB) Serbs\nC) Christians\nD) Asia Minor\nE) Constantinople', 'Question 5: What was the main aim of the Osmanli state of Brusa?\nA) Conquer Asia Minor\nB) Defeat the Serbs\nC) Invade Muslim territories\nD) Transition to Constantinople\nE) Expand into Asia Minor', 'Question 6: What was the significance of the Christian nation mentioned in the text?\nA) It was wealthy and fragile\nB) It was against Islam\nC) It was held by Muslim territories\nD) It was unimportant to the Osmanlis\nE) It was in Asia Minor']"|['A) It was held by Muslim territories', 'C) John Cantacuzene', 'E) Invitations from John Cantacuzene and Suleiman', 'B) Serbs', 'D) Transition to Constantinople', 'A) It was wealthy and fragile']
In Europe, the Osmanli Empire faced a devastating defeat in Angora in 1402 against Timur, losing their army and sultan to the enemy. However, their administrative system remained intact. A new ruler rose in Adrianople, securing the European territories. As the Tartars retreated, the Osmanlis quickly regained lost ground. Within two decades, they reclaimed their Asian territories and turned to strengthen their position in the west. Victories followed as Salonika fell, Greek rulers were subdued, and Murad II triumphed over his adversaries in Kosovo. Despite failing to defeat the Albanian Skanderbey, the Osmanlis brought stability to the Balkans. Mohammed the Conqueror's reign saw the empire flourish, maintaining Greek privileges, protecting Christian foreigners, and expanding into Europe and Asia. By 1481, the Osmanlis established themselves as a dominant force in the region, embracing European influences and fostering trade and culture.|"['1.

The successors of Mohammed, particularly Bayezid II, Selim I, and Suleiman the Magnificent, played a pivotal role in shaping Ottoman history. Their ambitious military campaigns led to the expansion of the empire but also sowed the seeds of its eventual decline. The increase in the professional army caused various issues like the rise of praetorianism, subjection of land to military seigneurs, and wars abroad to keep the soldiers occupied. The empire's expansion beyond its capacity, the recruitment of tribute-children, and conflicts with neighboring states further strained the empire. The Janissaries' power, provincial governors' independence, and financial troubles plagued the empire. Selim I's assumption of the caliphate consecrated militarism to a religious end, marking a shift in Ottoman policy. Suleiman's conquests, notably Hungary, while bringing military prestige, ultimately weakened the empire by exposing it to strong Christian forces and rousing Europe against Ottoman expansion.|"['1.

The Ottoman Empire, under Suleiman's rule, faced challenges due to its vast size. Suleiman, known as El Kanun, worked to reorganize the administration, but the system was strained. The empire's governing class lacked new blood, leading to changes like admitting free-born Muslims to the Janissaries. This shift disrupted the old Osmanli rule of having all key roles filled by slaves of the sultan. Suleiman had to divide the army to manage the empire's expanse, leaving the Janissaries to march without him. As the empire grew, so did religious fervor, leading to fanatical adherence to Islam. By the seventeenth century, under Ahmed I, the empire reached its peak, but faced challenges from Austria and internal strife. Praetorian tumults and military setbacks marked the following centuries, with Albanians taking a prominent role in the empire's affairs.|"[""1.

In the 18th century, Russia sought to challenge the Osmanli Empire's control over the Black Sea, leading to a fierce battle for dominance. Despite initial setbacks, Russia gradually weakened the Osmanlis, eventually gaining control over key territories. The Osmanli Empire faced internal strife and external pressures, losing its grip on crucial regions like the Crimea and the Danubian principalities. The rise of powerful Anatolian feudal families further eroded central authority, with provinces like Macedonia and Albania becoming more autonomous. As the empire's influence waned, European powers like Britain, France, and Germany took an interest in maintaining the balance of power in the region to prevent any one nation from dominating Constantinople. This strategic importance ensured that the Osmanli Empire, despite its weakened state, continued to attract support from major European nations.|['1.

After Selim's rise to power, about thirty years passed before significant changes occurred in the Osmanli state. Internally, the situation worsened as the Janissaries' insubordination escalated, leading to chaos. Mahmud II ascended the throne in 1809 amid turmoil but with a vision to reform. Despite setbacks, Mahmud aimed to abolish the Janissaries and other obstacles to his authority. He spearheaded critical reforms, transitioning from Byzantine-era practices to modern governance. Mahmud's reforms included replacing mercenaries with national forces, centralizing provincial governance, ending tax-farming, and streamlining administration. Despite facing challenges, Mahmud successfully implemented these reforms, transforming the Osmanli state. Amidst revolts by Serbs and Greeks seeking autonomy and independence, Mahmud navigated internal strife while reshaping the empire. Mahmud's reforms marked a significant departure from Byzantine traditions, paving the way for a reformed Osmanli state.|"[""1.

In the 19th century, Mahmud, the ruler of the Ottoman Empire, faced numerous challenges. After sacrificing his best troops and dealing with internal chaos, he confronted a Russian attack. Despite the valiant efforts of his inexperienced troops and interference from other powers, Constantinople was saved, but Mahmud had to accept humiliating terms. Mahmud's struggles continued with Mehemet Ali of Egypt, who rebelled due to feeling unappreciated. Despite setbacks, Mahmud focused on reorganizing the administration. Although many predicted the empire's downfall, foreign powers increasingly supported it. Mahmud's reforms, like imposing military service, helped unify the empire. By Mahmud's death, the empire had grown stronger, especially in its Asian territories. Mahmud's efforts laid the foundation for a more organized government in the empire.|"['1.

The Osmanli Empire, despite its decline, held latent strengths that helped it endure. Firstly, its predominant creed, Islam, united its subjects and ensured loyalty to the sultan. Secondly, the Osmanli Turks maintained a military governance capacity, preserving their rule. Thirdly, the sultanate of Stambul retained prestige and religious influence, bolstering the empire's image. Lastly, strong populations in Anatolia and other regions provided a solid foundation for the sultan's rule. These elements, often overlooked by critics, allowed the empire to withstand challenges and even consolidate itself in the 19th century. Despite financial troubles and weak rulers, the empire's international support grew, ensuring its survival. The Osmanli Empire's unique blend of military strength, religious unity, and loyal populations helped it weather external threats and internal challenges.|['1.

During Abdul Mejid's rule, a significant decree known as the Tanzimat was issued, aiming to reform the administration and promote equality between Christian and Muslim subjects in the empire. The sultan, influenced by various advisors, hoped for a harmonious future. However, his haste in implementing reforms caused discontent among traditionalists and moderate liberals. Despite facing internal and external challenges, Abdul Mejid continued administrative reforms, including restructuring the army and civil institutions. His reign also saw the codification of civil law. Yet, financial issues, provincial unrest, and opposition to reform marred his legacy. His successor, Abdul Aziz, shared similar reformist goals but faced personal struggles leading to a decline in the empire's affairs.

The new sultan unexpectedly found his empire in a dire situation. Despite being part of the Concert of Europe, he was more of a dependent than a true ruler, relying on the goodwill of other powers. The empire faced internal revolts and external threats. Midhat Pasha, a prominent figure, pushed for a constitutional change to modernize the empire. A parliament was established, but before any progress could be made, the Russians invaded, leading to a devastating war. The parliament was dissolved, and Midhat was banished. The sultan, Abdul Hamid, then focused on a pan-Islamic approach to strengthen the empire. Despite losing territories in Europe, he aimed to consolidate power in Asia. This shift in strategy aimed to revive the declining empire and assert its influence in the region.|"[""1.

The outcome dashed all hopes. Abdul Hamid's lack of success was primarily due to circumstances beyond his control rather than his abilities or leadership. The spread of Islam across vast regions with people at different levels of development and diverse political and social backgrounds likely made a universal caliphate unattainable. The original concept of the caliphate assumed all Muslims were ruled by their own creed, possibly under a single government. Even if a caliph were to emerge, an Ottoman sultan would not be a strong contender due to his lineage and the compromised status of his empire. Abdul Hamid's reign was marked by a retreat into his palace, using his cunning to exploit his country's dependence on foreign powers. His administration deteriorated, plagued by corruption, neglect, and brutal measures like the Armenian massacres. Foreign incursions increased, with regions like Egypt and Macedonia slipping from Ottoman control. The loss of Macedonia, with its mixed population, would be particularly bitter, leaving Albania vulnerable and altering strategic control of key coastal areas. Macedonia's disorder, exacerbated by Ottoman neglect and interference, became a focal point for nationalist movements, ultimately contributing to the army's revolt against Abdul Hamid's rule.|"[""1.

Looking back over seven years of consequences from a significant revolution, it becomes clear that the motivation behind it was more about the shame of the Osmanli military decline rather than a desire for progress. The movement's core was militant nationalism, aiming to regenerate the empire by making it more Osmanli rather than humane. The revolutionary Committee in Salonika, known as 'of Union and Progress', initially played its cards close, but events forced its hand by 1910. The Committee's pan-Osmanli and pro-Moslem intentions were showcased through actions against _rayas_ to appease reactionaries. The Greeks in the empire leaned towards Hellenic nationality rather than Ottoman fraternity, while Arab-speaking societies sought fair representation and resisted assimilation by the Turk-speaking Osmanlis. Despite suggestions for local autonomy, the Committee focused on assimilating all societies into the Osmanli fold.|"['1.

The conflict's course, detailed elsewhere, warns of the risks of an alliance surpassing expectations. The nations involved anticipated a tough battle with the Ottomans, aiming to divide Macedonia or secure its autonomy. However, the Ottoman collapse exceeded all predictions. The allies' timing was fortunate, catching the Ottoman forces weakened from previous conflicts. The Ottoman armies were ill-prepared, lacking in strength and training. As a result, the Bulgarians advanced further than planned, the Serbs broke through into Albania, and the Greeks claimed more territory than expected. Disagreements arose among the allies over the division of conquered lands, leading to a second Balkan war. Ultimately, the Ottomans lost significant territories and population, but the conflict provided valuable lessons for military reform.|"[""1.

An advantage that Serbia valued highly was the potential support from the strongest military force in Europe. The success of Serbia threatened the plans of Germany and Austria in the Balkans. This led the Central Powers to court Turkey even more intensely and seek an alliance to counter the Serbian threat. Germany and Austria had been influencing Turkey for over twenty years, promoting German interests in various ways. As tensions escalated in Europe, Turkey aligned itself with Germany, receiving military aid and financial support. The Ottoman Empire's fate became intertwined with the outcomes of European conflicts. The Osmanlis' influence rested on Constantinople, the sultan's caliphate, and their character traits of power and courage. Constantinople symbolized the Osmanlis' historical conquests and the legacy of Rome, representing imperial authority and rule.|"['1.

The reputation of the Osmanlis in the Near East is a paradox considering their foreign origins in much of their empire. The establishment of Constantinople as their capital did not signify a victory of the East over the West as it did in Europe, but rather a continuation of Roman dominion. The peasants in regions like Asia Minor and Egypt have been ruled by many different races under the guise of Roman authority. The Osmanlis, being foreigners in their own empire, maintained the old Roman ways. The belief in the Osmanlis' superiority is slowly fading, but their control over Constantinople remains crucial to their perceived power. The economic and social benefits of relocating their capital to Asia are clear, yet the symbolic importance of Constantinople keeps them rooted in Europe. The religious prestige of the Ottoman power as the guardian of caliphial authority and Islam in Arabia is immeasurable. The potential for a Holy War to unite Muslims under the Ottoman sultan remains uncertain and could have significant implications.|"['1.

Undoubtedly, the Ottoman sultanate relies heavily on its religious influence to appeal broadly, overshadowing opposing feelings and potentially igniting formidable reactions. Disregarding the caliph due to his non-Koreish lineage and his title's relatively recent establishment in the 16th century would be unwise. Many Sunnites are unaware of these facts, which may not hold as much weight as the sultan's long-standing control over the Holy Cities. The religious authority of an Ottoman sultan who loses governance over these sacred sites would swiftly diminish, similar to the secular standing of one who surrenders Constantinople. The Committee of Union and Progress should have reconsidered advice from European commentators, as an Arab uprising could spell the downfall of the Ottoman Empire. The inherent qualities of the Osmanli Turk, coupled with their historical background, contribute significantly to their prestige. The courage displayed by the Osmanlis, especially in battle, is well-documented, with troops from northern and central Asia Minor standing out. Failure to address Arab concerns and include them adequately in governance structures may exacerbate the risk of regional secession. The Committee's Europeanized approach may not fully grasp the nuances of Asian dynamics, potentially fueling discontent among Arab-speaking populations.|"[""1.

An Arab revolt might occur in the Ottoman Empire, but its success would be uncertain due to the diverse population and lack of unity among the Arab peoples. The region's physical geography forces many to be nomadic and feared by settled communities. The people are divided by religion and sects, making it challenging to coordinate any collective action. The only groups with political organization are the Christians, particularly the Maronites. In contrast, Asia Minor strongly supports the Ottoman cause, rooted in historical ties and national unity. The Anatolian population, predominantly agricultural, lacks the zeal for war and would likely not resist foreign occupation. The Christian minorities, such as Armenians and Greeks, may present challenges due to their nationalist aspirations. The future of an autonomous Armenia remains uncertain due to the dispersed nature of the Armenian population.|['1.

If Russia decided to make a self-denying ordinance, she would need to heavily police the newly acquired Armenia for several years. The acute Kurdish problem in the region would pose a significant challenge. The Armenia Irredenta, including regions like Diarbekr, Urfa, Aleppo, and others, would need public security to be assured before any concentration of nationals could occur. The Kurdish population, although Indo-European like the Armenians, would take a long time to accept the dominance of a race they have historically plundered. The assimilation of Osmanlis in eastern Asia Minor, who are descendants of converted Armenians, would also be slow and uncertain. The Anatolian Greeks, particularly those in western river basins and coastal areas, are politically advanced and closely tied to Hellenic national politics, making their future integration complex. Smyrna, the second city of the Ottoman Empire and a significant Greek urban center, poses challenges regarding its potential union with Greece due to geopolitical complexities.|['1.

The Emperor Hadrian ruled over various regions such as the Haliacmon Valley and the Halys River. Hasa, Hatti Sherif, and Hejaz were among the territories influenced by Hellenic culture and civilization. The Hellenic Republic and the Hellespont were significant areas. The annexation of Hercegovina by Austria-Hungary, the origin and independence of Turkey, and revolts against Turkey are historical events. Hilmi Pasha and the Hungarians played roles in the conflicts in the Balkan peninsula. Hungary and the Balkan peninsula saw wars with Turkey, including the conquest by Suleiman I. The arrival of the Huns in Europe, Hunyadi John, and the Hydhriots are also notable. The speech of Krete and the conquest of Kosovo by the Turks are part of the region's complex history.|"[""1.
