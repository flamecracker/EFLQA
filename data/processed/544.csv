"""We can't see it yet--the belt of birch running up from that little cove hides it. It's about two miles from Glen St. Mary, and there's another mile between it and the lighthouse.

Long ago on Four Winds Island, an old man reminisces about the schoolmaster's bride, a woman unforgettable even thirty years after her passing. The schoolmaster, John Selwyn, was a remarkable man who stood out from the usual drunken teachers of the time. He was a fine, handsome fellow who shared his love for poetry with the young boy. When John's sweetheart, Persis Leigh, finally arrived after a long and difficult journey, the old man saw the joy in John's eyes, much like the joy he sees in Dr. Blythe's eyes when he brought Mistress Blythe in that night. The old man reflects on the memories of his time spent with John, their walks, talks, and shared love for poetry, all nearly sixty years ago.|"[""1.

Almost everyone gave him a small gift to help furnish the house. When the Russells moved in, they were wealthy and decorated it beautifully, as you can see now. But the first furniture was simple. However, the house was filled with love. The women sent quilts, tablecloths, and towels, while men made furniture. Even blind Aunt Margaret Boyd made a basket from sand-hill grass. The schoolmaster's wife used it to store handkerchiefs. Finally, everything was ready, even the logs in the fireplace. Captain Jim reminisced about the fireplace, where many memories were made. The schoolmaster eagerly awaited his bride, expected in mid-July. But days passed, and the ship was delayed. Concern grew as weeks went by.

She was the most beautiful girl there, and the Prince even danced with her. The other women, whom he didn't dance with, were envious because of their higher social status and believed he shouldn't have overlooked them. Elizabeth always cherished that dance.

"No, he wasn't. And he needn't come either. I could have had him long ago when he was fresh. I don't want any second-hand goods, believe me. As for Horace Baxter, he was in financial difficulties a year ago last summer, and he prayed to the Lord for help; and when his wife died and he got her life insurance, he said he believed it was the answer to his prayer. Wasn't that like a man? It sounds like it mighty often, believe me. But trust one man to excuse another. I have no use for Robert Baxter. He turned Methodist just because the Presbyterian choir happened to be singing 'Behold the bridegroom cometh' for a collection piece when him and Margaret walked up the aisle the Sunday after they were married. Served him right for being late! He always insisted the choir did it on purpose to insult him, as if he was of that much importance. But that family always thought they were much bigger potatoes than they really were. His brother Eliphalet imagined the devil was always at his elbow--but I never believed the devil wasted that much time on him. I don't know,"" said Captain Jim thoughtfully.

Miss Cornelia shared a tale with Captain Jim about the struggles of building the Glen St. Mary church. She highlighted the inefficiency of the men's committee, which held numerous meetings without progress.

"The evening blossomed with joy around the crackling driftwood fire. Captain Jim shared stories, while Marshall Elliott sang ancient Scottish songs with a splendid tenor voice.

Captain Jim remarked, ""He can't appreciate music, that cat."" The lively tunes inspired Marshall Elliott to dance, and he invited Leslie to join him. The room was filled with the rhythmic grace of their dancing. Anne was mesmerized by Leslie's vibrant and charming nature as she danced with passion.

It's true. I must confess, there have been times when I hated you, Anne. I envied you deeply for all the love and happiness you had. I was sick with envy. I longed for the dear little home, the love, the happiness, and the glad dreams you possessed. It hurt me that I could never have those things. I was rebellious and filled with shame for hating you. When you were gravely ill, I thought I was being punished for my wickedness. I realized then how empty my life was without anything to love. I wanted to tell you how unworthy I felt of your friendship. I was afraid it would turn you against me. But now that I've begun, I want to share everything with you.

I was very unhappy that evening. I had a hard day with Dick, who was difficult to manage. Usually, he is good-natured, but that day was different. I was heartsick, so I escaped to the shore once he fell asleep. I thought about my father's tragic end and feared I might face a similar fate. My mind was filled with dark thoughts. Then, you appeared, dancing along the cove like a carefree child. At that moment, I despised you more than ever, yet I longed for your friendship. My emotions were a tumult, shifting between hatred and desire. When I returned home, I was ashamed of how you might perceive me. This conflict persisted during my visits. Sometimes I found joy in your company, while other times, a bitter envy clouded everything. Your home held treasures I could never possess. I even harbored a ridiculous resentment towards your china dogs. It was a constant struggle, witnessing your happiness with Gilbert, surrounded by love and laughter, while I returned to my desolate existence. Oh, Anne, I don't think jealousy is my natural state. As a girl, I lacked things my peers had, yet I never resented them. But now, I've become consumed by bitterness.|"['1. Why was the speaker unhappy that evening?\nA.

She felt a pang of guilt for not seeing it sooner. Such feelings were unheard of in Four Winds. Anne worried for Leslie, who had never faced such a situation before.

Once, Owen visited the Point to fish with Captain Jim but the rough weather kept them ashore. Returning, he saw Leslie drying her hair in the sun. Her golden hair cascaded like a fountain.

Miss Cornelia performed comedy amidst life's tragedies, bringing laughter to Anne and Owen. In her presence, sentiment and passion faded, leaving Anne feeling less hopeless. However, sleep eluded her that night. The next day, Owen departed, leaving Anne to visit Leslie, but the house was empty, giving a sense of desolation. Anne then joined Gilbert to visit Captain Jim, only to find him absent. Alone on the misty shore, Anne embraced the eerie charm of the night, envisioning the surroundings as a mystical realm.

Leslie stopped attending the meetings after feeling hurt by the Fiske-man's remarks. He even publicly prayed for her to change her ways.

"""Oh, Anne, that night in April when Gilbert told me he thought Dick might be cured! I can never forget it. It seemed to me that I had once been a prisoner in a hideous cage of torture, and then the door had been opened and I could get out. I was still chained to the cage but I was not in it. And that night I felt that a merciless hand was drawing me back into the cage--back to a torture even more terrible than it had once been. I didn't blame Gilbert. I felt he was right. And he had been very good--he said that if, in view of the expense and uncertainty of the operation, I should decide not to risk it, he would not blame me in the least. But I knew how I ought to decide--and I couldn't face it. All night I walked the floor like a mad woman, trying to compel myself to face it. I couldn't, Anne--I thought I couldn't--and when morning broke I set my teeth and resolved that I WOULDN'T. I would let things remain as they were. It was very wicked, I know. It would have been just punishment for such wickedness if I had just been left to abide by that decision. I kept to it all day. That afternoon I had to go up to the Glen to do some shopping.
