Nyoda requested me to write about our memorable car trip last September. She believed it was too good to keep to ourselves, especially since I was the official reporter for the Winnebagos. Sahwah wished for a ride in a patrol wagon to add some thrill, but our adventures were sparked by a simple event - the popularity of tan khaki outfits. While watching the stars, thoughts of Evangeline's lost love crossed my mind, pondering if two souls could just miss each other. As I observed two girls playfully chasing each other, I got engrossed in their game, waiting to see who would win. Fate seemed to listen to my musings, hinting at more adventures on the horizon. When Gladys's father allowed us to plan a trip within a 500-mile radius, he challenged us to be self-reliant, testing our resourcefulness. Gladys's father teased her about needing help, but she was confident with Nyoda's experience. If we completed the trip without seeking aid, he promised to build us a permanent Lodge for our Winnebago meetings. Gladys was thrilled by the prospect of a new Lodge.|"['1.

"We excitedly poured over the road map, torn between Cincinnati and Chicago. Nyoda and Gladys debated passionately, leading to a tennis showdown to decide. The intense game ended in a tie of 44-44. Sensing sunburn danger, we united forces and planned a trip to both cities. The route: Cleveland to Chicago via Toledo and Ft. Wayne; Chicago to Indianapolis; Indianapolis to Louisville, with a detour to Vincennes. From Louisville, we'd head to Cincinnati, visiting Rookwood Pottery. Attired in khaki hiking-suits and Camp Fire hats, we felt ready for the adventure. Goggles were a debate, but Nyoda's Preparedness motto won. The cars were named the Striped Beetle and the Glow-worm. Teams were decided by a game of ""John Kempo"", linking our fates with our cars. The night before departure, elation filled the air, marking the beginning of an unforgettable journey."|"['1.

The chance of rain had never crossed our minds, envisioning only sunny country roads. However, Gladys mocked the idea of letting a little rain deter the Camp Fire Girls. To invoke rain, she created a Rain Jinx using Hinpoha's dry Latin book as the centerpiece of an altar, sacrificing rain gear to the Rain Bird. In a whimsical ceremony to protect against mishaps, Nyoda accidentally disrupted the Jinx. Despite the chaos, the next day dawned beautifully for our journey. Divided between two cars, we set out, each with a camera in hand, ready to capture the adventure. Our departure was marked by cheers, banners flying, and a bet for luck. As we drove off, our spirits high, we attracted attention with our matching outfits and green veils, feeling a sense of pride and excitement.|"['1.

"I always thought September was the loveliest time to travel through the countryside in the lake region due to the abundance of grapes. The vineyards extended for miles along the road, filling the air with the sweet scent of the purple fruit. There were vast corn-fields that reminded me of a poem. One striking sight was a long row of vibrant red geraniums planted through a green field, creating a stunning effect. As we journeyed, the girls in the car ahead were singing and joking around. We even sang the ""Glow-worm"" song, adding to the joy of the trip. Despite a small incident with a lady crossing the street, we managed to help her and continue our journey to Toledo. The fun continued as we reached Ft. Wayne, playing games and enjoying each other's company."|"['1.

After the commotion settled down and the crowd dispersed, we went back to the car, only to realize that the Striped Beetle was missing. It seemed that Gladys, caught up in the busy street, had driven on without noticing our absence. As the one with the road map and our planned route, she had the upper hand. We hurried to the end of the street, hoping to spot the Striped Beetle, but it was nowhere in sight. Upon inquiring at a store, we learned that the car had turned left up --th Street. Racing after it, we expected to catch up any moment, yet there was no sign. As we ventured out of the city onto a country road, the mystery deepened. The man we encountered had seen the car pass by half an hour earlier, leaving us baffled by Gladys's unexpected speed. Despite the Glow-worm's slower pace, we were determined to catch up before reaching Ft. Wayne. Nyoda, taken aback by the change in route, questioned the sudden deviation from our original plan. The man's vivid description of four girls in matching tan suits assured us we were on the right track, even though the road ahead held more surprises than we anticipated.|"['1.

Nyoda believed that the girls in the car ahead were playing a prank on them. Despite the unexpected stop for gasoline in Napoleon, they were unable to catch up. Nyoda, responsible for seven girls, was determined to lecture Gladys for running away. The Frog, who had been trailing them, stopped for gas too.

As the red car passed by slowly, the Frog kept staring at Nyoda, who was focused on fixing the engine. After realizing a gear issue, they sought help at a nearby repair shop. Unfortunately, the repair couldn't be done, and they had to stay overnight in S----. Nyoda sent a message to the girls waiting in Ft. Wayne, informing them of the delay. The hotel in S---- was full due to a wedding, but they were directed to a large house where they were warmly welcomed. The spacious and elegant house provided a comfortable respite for the tired and hungry travelers. The old but luxurious furnishings hinted at the house's grand past, making the unexpected stay more pleasant.|"[""1.

Upon entering the grand mansion, we could sense the lady's elegance despite her need to rent rooms for a living. Sahwah, practical as always, questioned why she didn't sell the house. Curiosity drove us to see the former mistress of the grand estate. The bedroom we were led to was luxurious, unlike anything at home. The mahogany four-poster bed draped in lace and the faded oriental rug exuded opulence. The bathroom featured a shower, and we marveled at the embroidered towels with long fringes. Suddenly, the lady of the house appeared, stunning in plum-colored satin. Our comical mishap of using towels as props left her speechless. She revealed this was the bridal chamber for her daughter's wedding, not a hotel. The mix-up left us in a humorous predicament, as we stood amidst the chaos of towels, clothing, and the shower's cold surprises.|"[""1.

We felt weak and frozen when we realized we were in the wrong room. Nyoda's towel slipped, and Sahwah froze mid-step with towels in hand. We all stood like statues until Sahwah burst out laughing, breaking the tension. Nyoda apologized for the mix-up, caused by the hotel's wrong directions. We hurriedly dressed and tidied up, overhearing Mrs. McAlpine telling the story to someone in the next room. A man's booming laughter followed, finding the situation hilarious. We couldn't face the embarrassment, so we dashed out, laughing uncontrollably on the sidewalk. It was a mix of feeling small and silly but also finding humor in the mishap. We couldn't wait to share this funny escapade with our friends the next day.|"[""1.

After a refreshing bath, we eagerly devoured supper at Mrs. Butler's house on North Vine Street. Hungry and tired from our long day outdoors, the simple yet cozy rooms felt like a haven. During breakfast, a message arrived for Nyoda, revealing that Gladys and the others weren't at the Ft. Wayne hotel as expected. Concerned but optimistic, Nyoda suspected they might be stranded like us. As we prepared to hit the road again, we encountered the Frog, the mysterious roadster that had been trailing us. Nyoda's subtle reaction hinted at her unease, but we continued our journey, wondering about the unexpected turn of events and the whereabouts of our friends.|"[""1.

Why did the man stay in S---- all night without any car trouble when accommodations were scarce? We were puzzled by his presence, especially when he followed us the next morning. Even though he didn't do anything suspicious, both Nyoda and I felt uneasy around him. We searched for any sign of the Striped Beetle along the way but found nothing. As we drove through Indiana, Sahwah entertained us with a game of counting windmills. Suddenly, we spotted a girl waving at us from a field. She signaled for us to stop, looking hesitant. She appeared young, dressed in a dark blue suit with a white sailor hat covering her face. As she gazed at us, her eyes focused on Nyoda, seeking help.|"['1.

"""Would you take me to Decatur?"" the girl asked hesitantly. ""I'll pay you whatever you think it's worth,"" she added quickly. Decatur was not on our way to Ft. Wayne, where we were headed to find out about Gladys. But the girl seemed troubled. She appeared frightened, desperate, and much older than her thirteen years. She was actually running back home to her mother, who had been fighting for custody. Dressed in clothes too big for her, she looked like someone else.

We were close to Decatur when a sudden noise startled us. We all thought it was Margery's uncle, but it was just a tire bursting. I believe fate intentionally caused it. With the help of a passing farmer, we quickly changed the tire. Margery anxiously paced as we fixed it. Time felt endless to her. As we continued our journey, Nyoda noticed the time was running short. We rushed to buy gas, worried we might miss the train. Unfortunately, all the clocks were wrong, and we arrived at the station too late. Margery was scared and unsure what to do next. She feared her uncle's watchful eyes.

Nyoda made a firm decision not to leave Margery alone on her journey to Ft. Wayne. Instead, they would travel together through Louisville. Nyoda planned for Margery to blend in with their group by getting her a dress and veil like the other girls. This way, Margery could safely reach her destination without drawing attention. However, upon reaching Ft. Wayne, they discovered that the girls they were looking for had already left for Chicago through Ligonier. Nyoda's keen observation skills allowed her to notice a red roadster following them, which turned out to be the Frog.

We were driving from Ft. Wayne when a mysterious figure began following us, causing chills. The afternoon grew misty and chilly, and our car started acting up. We were being tailed by a roadster. The car trouble forced us to stop in Wellsville for repairs. While waiting, we sought shelter in a small inn. The parlor had a garish carpet, and outside, noisy men were singing and smoking. One man's impertinence led to a scuffle, involving the mysterious figure we dubbed the Frog. Not wanting to witness any more trouble, we retreated to the garage. Soon, the commotion in the inn subsided, and our car was fixed by the evening. Despite the unexpected delay, we were relieved to resume our journey towards South Bend.|['1.

"It was almost eight o'clock, and we kept checking the Glow-worm, hoping it was almost done. But the man was taking his time, scattering parts on the floor and not rushing to finish. By eight, it still wasn't ready. We walked along the main street for two hours, hoping the work was done, but it wasn't. Finally, by half-past ten, it was finished, too late to start. Reluctantly, we stayed at the inn for the night. The rooms were full of noise from the racket below. We planned to leave early the next day. Suddenly, a cry of ""Fire!"" pierced the air.

We fumbled through the smoke, found our clothes, and hurried into the narrow wooden hallway of the old-fashioned hotel. The stairway was engulfed in flames, leaving us trapped. Suddenly, a man with a towel over his face emerged and guided us to safety. We formed a line and followed him to an open window where we were rescued one by one. Standing on the burning building, we awaited blankets to jump to safety. Despite the danger, we managed to hold onto our belongings, giving us a tourist-like appearance.

"Our rescuer bravely leaped after us during the fire, but as we regained our composure, he had mysteriously vanished. We assumed he was the hotel owner due to his familiarity with the building. Later, as the fire drew crowds from all around, we sadly watched the hotel collapse in flames. Despite the chaos, Sahwah found humor in the destroyed piano, relieved that its discordant notes would no longer be heard. The night was eerie, with flames illuminating the fog, creating a haunting scene. When the wind shifted, endangering the garage where our car was parked, panic set in. Discovering our car missing, we frantically searched, only to spot it being driven away by the Frog.

We had a sudden collision with a stationary car in the fog, causing a jolt in our vehicle. Fortunately, Nyoda had braked just before the impact, lessening the severity of the crash. Surprisingly, the man by the car was not who we expected. Our car's front wheel hit the other vehicle, damaging it more. The man, worried about potential legal consequences, inspected the damage.

Nyoda turned the car and we drove a short distance, hoping to find the road soon. Suddenly, the car sped downhill, splashing into a stream. The mud beneath was soft, so we had to continue across. Thankfully, the water was shallow, and we didn't get wet inside. After a tense moment, we reached the other side. Nyoda refused to drive further. Stranded in a foggy field at 2 a.m., we were lost, with no idea of our location. The cold pierced our bones, and we weren't dressed for the weather. To keep warm, we danced around the Glow-worm, creating a strange sight. As morning came, the fog lifted, revealing our location near the stream. We decided to find a road west to reach our destination, avoiding Wellsville.|"['1.

Our journey to Rochester felt like a bad dream. The road was rough, full of mud holes and stones that shook our car. Passing a sleeping town, we learned it was Byron. The road to Rochester twisted like a serpent, making us fear for our wobbly wheel. Hungry, we snacked on apples from a tree. The morning was sunny, lifting our spirits until we spotted the red roadster ahead. Nyoda, furious, sped up, but the red roadster vanished around a bend. Nyoda suspected the Frog was avoiding us after the hotel incident. Confused by the Frog's actions, we focused on the scenery. A cautious motorcyclist behind us entertained our thoughts.

The young man, a motor tourist, approached the group politely as they awaited repairs for their vehicle. He inquired about their journey to Chicago and kindly recommended a nearby restaurant for breakfast. After parting ways, the group went for a walk in the hot town, opting to wear tinted goggles for relief from the sun. Frustrated by their frequent vehicle troubles, they joked about walking to Chicago instead.

We returned to the small eatery where we had our morning meal and ordered dinner. The options were boiled fish or fried steak, and all of us except Margery chose steak. The heat had reduced our hunger, but Margery enjoyed her fish. After dining, we ventured back into the sweltering weather. Yearning for relief, we checked if the cinema was open. Thankfully, it was, and we entered, relieved. During the movie, Sahwah nudged me, pointing out the Frog on one side, while Nakwisi discreetly drew my attention to the motorcyclist on the other. Later, as we left to fetch the Glow-worm, Margery felt unwell under the scorching sun. Unable to find a room due to a local event, we sought help from a nearby woman.

Margery was more upset about delaying our journey than her own discomfort. The Glow-worm was ready, but we were not. It felt like Margery had eaten a special fish from the zodiac, making us unable to leave town that night. Margery was too weak to travel by car. We sent a telegram to Gladys at the Carrie Wentworth Inn, explaining our situation. The mysterious motorcyclist left the telegraph office before us. Margery slept while we read a newspaper revealing her family searching for her. We suspected the Frog might be a detective. The heat and confusion left us exhausted.

Confused, they realized that their trunk had been swapped with Gladys's trunk, which was identical. The garage man had no record of the Striped Beetle or the girls. Despite the puzzling situation, they decided to continue their journey. As they prepared to leave, a messenger boy approached them, inquiring about Miss Elizabeth Kent.|"['1.

We gazed at each other in confusion. How did Gladys end up in Indianapolis? The city was far from our intended route, miles to the south. It seemed impossible for her to have gotten lost with the clear road markings. But if Gladys had taken a detour and fallen behind us, who had passed ahead of us along the northern route to Chicago, the path we blindly followed? How did Gladys in Indianapolis receive the telegram we sent to Chicago, providing our address in Rochester? If Gladys hadn't taken the northern route, how did her trunk end up in Wellsville? It was a perplexing puzzle no matter how we analyzed it. We eagerly anticipated noon when the mystery would unravel. To pass the time, we explored the local stores, marveling at the variety of goods from handkerchiefs to farm tools, creating a stir among the locals. The store owner's suspicious behavior added to the intrigue, leaving us wondering about the mysteries surrounding us.|"['1.

Everywhere we turned, we faced a wall of mystery. Was the Frog behind it? Why did he linger in the shadows, not openly confronting us? His silent presence was more unsettling than an armed highwayman. Though he hadn't shown up yet today, we sensed his lurking presence. As we waited, a motorcyclist approached. Longing for noon when Gladys would arrive, we endured the oppressive town. Passing time in a store, we were shadowed by the owner, relieved when we left. Frustrated, we returned to Margery, waiting for the Striped Beetle. Hours passed, the sun scorching as we sang to distract ourselves. Tourists passed, but not our awaited friends. Nyoda found a strange beetle in her pocket, leaving us speechless. The day dragged on, our anticipation turning to disappointment as we watched and waited in vain.|"[""1.

Nyoda tried to remember where she had been all day. She and Sahwah were at the restaurant, and no one else was nearby. Nyoda was puzzled because the scarab she found wasn't from their town; it must have come from a city or a collector. They went to the police station, but the officer told them to take the scarab elsewhere because of a strange incident with a necklace. Nyoda suggested they head towards Indianapolis to find their missing friends. Sahwah found it odd that Gladys didn't send another message when she couldn't make it. Nyoda worried that something bad had happened to their friends. They decided to search for them, fearing the worst.|"['1.

Sahwah suggested that maybe the wire got misplaced, so Nyoda and I rushed to the telegraph office to check for any new messages. Unfortunately, there were none. Nyoda quickly decided to head towards Indianapolis, but left instructions for any messages to be forwarded to Kokomo. We all hopped into the Glow-worm, picked up Margery, and left Rochester behind, covered in thick dust. The scorching heat made us seek relief in the car, despite the swirling dust. We kept a watchful eye on Margery, worried about the intense heat. We stopped at various places, asking about a brown car with black stripes carrying four girls in tan suits, but found no trace. Our search felt like looking for a needle in a haystack, with the added challenge of a moving target. We even had a moment of panic when we heard about a similar car accident, but thankfully, it wasn't the one we were looking for.|['1.

If destiny plays a role in the color of paint, then brown might be an unlucky choice for a car. The road seemed cursed for brown cars, with numerous accidents. One car even flipped over a bridge, tossing its male passengers into the river. A woman recounted a tale of four distressed girls whose car was stolen while they admired a calf in a field. The girls were headed to the nearest town to seek help. As storm clouds gathered ominously, the group raced towards Kokomo to check for a message from Gladys. The impending storm chased them, with thunder roaring and rain threatening to drench them.

After a long search for Gladys, we found ourselves stranded on the road without gasoline for our car. A sudden storm hit us, drenching us instantly. Seeking refuge under a tree, lightning struck nearby, making us flee to safety. A kind driver in a limousine offered us help, his demeanor changing upon seeing a scarab we possessed. He quickly towed our car to his grand mansion in the countryside. The chauffeur, nicknamed Heinie, assured us of refueling the car while a maid welcomed us inside the vast estate. The chauffeur's unique baseball finger caught our attention as he skillfully maneuvered the car towards the garage, leaving us in awe of the unexpected turn of events.|"['1.

Nyoda suggested waiting until the rain passed, but the maid started giggling uncontrollably, possibly still amused by the chauffeur's antics. She then led us upstairs to a luxurious bedroom in a wealthy man's house. The maids quickly helped us dry off and offered warm broth and sandwiches. We were grateful for the shelter from the storm, which had intensified since we got inside. The maids were attentive, especially Carrie, who seemed talkative but later acted mysteriously. As we waited for the rain to stop, we felt fortunate to be in such a lavish home and momentarily forgot about our initial worries. The downpour outside made us anxious about the road conditions ahead, but for now, we were content to be safe and dry.|"['1.

Carrie, their host's maid, informed the girls that they were welcome to stay the night. This unexpected offer added a new adventure to their journey. Later, Carrie mentioned a fancy dress ball hosted by Mrs. McClure that night. Due to some guests canceling last minute, the girls were asked to attend the ball in their place. Excited and feeling out of place in such high society, they agreed to go. Carrie suggested they dress as tourists, using their automobile suits, veils, and goggles. After getting ready, they were led to the ballroom, where a grand spectacle of masked guests awaited. Overwhelmed by the opulence and the vibrant scene, they realized they had to find Mrs. McClure among the masked attendees. Despite feeling like outsiders, they were invited to dance, with one of the girls engaging in a conversation with a Scottish highlander, trying to gather information discreetly.|['1.

At the ball, while we were in the sun parlor, Nyoda discovered a diamond necklace instead of the scarab she had kept safe. Shocked, we realized something suspicious was going on. Nyoda warned us that thieves might be at work, and we needed to leave. We decided to escape through the garage to get the Glow-worm. However, finding a way out was tricky as the rooms were filled with guests. Luckily, the maid Carrie helped us sneak out through a reception-room and the footman guided us to the porte-cochere entrance. We quickly boarded the Glow-worm and drove away into the night, trying to piece together the strange events of the evening. It was not until the next day that everything became clear.|['1.

We understood that a diamond necklace was stolen at a ball, and the servants might have been involved. We laughed at the idea of the necklace hidden in the sun parlor. Stranded without a place to stay, we decided to drive all night to escape. We feared being pursued and struggled on bad roads. After a storm, we encountered a washed-out bridge, forcing us to find an alternate route. We got lost on muddy back roads with dim lights. Singing in the rain, we tried to lift our spirits. Opening a gate on private property, we faced a sudden downpour. Eventually, we found our way back to the main road, feeling exhausted and disheartened.|['1.

Nakwisi, sounding a bit annoyed, mentioned not to answer if unwilling. We lowered our veils, puzzled by Sahwah's silence. Suddenly, we realized Sahwah was missing from the car! She had vanished into the rainy darkness mysteriously. Let's rewind to when we almost hit an old lady and lost sight of the Striped Beetle. Hinpoha and Gladys were in the front, with Mr. Bob. The street was chaotic, with a wagon nearly tipping over. While Gladys navigated carefully, the noise was overwhelming. When they noticed the Glow-worm missing, Gladys turned back but couldn't find us. Inquiring around, they heard conflicting directions. They pursued the Glow-worm, puzzled by Nyoda's unusual route. It turned out we had passed ahead of them. Gladys wondered why Nyoda didn't wait and took a quieter path.|"[""1.

Mr. Bob, our mascot, usually gentle, turned fierce when a yellow dog provoked him. Despite Hinpoha's efforts to stop him, Mr. Bob chased the yellow dog into an alley, with Hinpoha close behind. The yellow dog found refuge in an empty store, closely followed by Mr. Bob and Hinpoha. Inside, they found a scared girl sitting on the floor. The girl, Pearl Baxter, explained her predicament: falsely accused of stealing bonds from her office, she ran away and hid in the store overnight. Now afraid to leave, Pearl sought refuge from the angry accusations. As Mr. Bob cornered the yellow dog, Hinpoha comforted Pearl, who was terrified.

She guided the girl to the Striped Beetle and shared her tale with the other girls. They all decided to rush her to Nyoda. Sitting in the car's backseat, Pearl, with her face veiled, nervously scanned the surroundings as they drove through the streets. Gladys furrowed her brow in confusion as they turned corners without finding the Glow-worm. Boys playing outside mentioned it had passed by 15 minutes earlier. Hinpoha hoped to spot the car soon to hand Pearl over to Nyoda. Chapa joked that it was like a game of Hare and Hounds, with Nyoda as the hare and them as the hounds. They realized the Glow-worm had taken a different route. Despite the confusion, they found humor in the situation. Pearl, usually quiet, appeared unwell, causing concern among the girls. Medmangi, aspiring to be a doctor, checked on Pearl's health.|"[""1.

Hinpoha expressed regret, realizing they had not thought about Pearl's hunger. They halted at a village to get her food. Despite her hunger, Pearl ate little due to her worries. The girls tried to uplift her spirits, promising things would improve once they found Nyoda. Passing through the village, they encountered a road strewn with broken china. The car's tires were damaged. Gladys struggled to change them. She sought help from a man in a nearby house. The man assisted, suggesting they move the car to the shade. While the man worked on the car, the girls went to a pump for water. A woman with a baby asked them to sit on her porch. Medmangi offered to hold the baby, easing the woman's load.|"['1.

Medmangi and Hinpoha tried to calm a crying child while the mother worked. Another child peeked through the door, shy and sleepy. The mother, grateful for the help, awaited the doctor.

Gladys interrupted the doctor's enjoyment, as he left with his shiny case and a message, leaving the guard to watch the house. Frustrated, Gladys couldn't start the Striped Beetle.

A man mistakenly placed a trunk on the wrong car, leading two girls on a mission to retrieve it. Despite the odds, they reached Indianapolis smoothly but couldn't locate the trunk owner. They decided to wait, hoping he'd return soon. As time passed, they faced setbacks like an undelivered telegram and a broken-down car. They persisted in their efforts, calling the trunk owner's home frequently. Ultimately, they drove to his house, but he still hadn't arrived. The girls debated whether to leave without the trunk, but one insisted on seeing it herself. They sent more messages and stayed another night in Indianapolis.

The girls felt disheartened by the news, especially Hinpoha, as the scarf from her late mother was missing. Where could the trunk be? It could be anywhere between the north and south poles by now. Gladys hoped it was misplaced, not stolen, and that an honest person would find it. Just as they were about to head back to Chicago, they received a telegram from the Carrie Wentworth Inn with an address in Rochester, Indiana. They decided to make the trip to Indianapolis for the races. As they drove through the crowded streets, Gladys searched for her trunk on passing cars but found nothing. Pearl, a girl who seemed sheltered and disapproving of many things, made the group uneasy with her comments. It made Hinpoha wonder if Pearl would fit in with the Winnebagos.|"['1.

They were driving along country roads when they crossed a small river with beautiful early autumn flowers. Hinpoha, captivated by the colors, wanted to explore them. Gladys, Chapa, and Medmangi also decided to take a stroll by the river. Pearl stayed in the car, offering to watch their purses. The girls admired the flowers but didn't pick any, knowing they could bring joy to others if left on the stems. They dipped their fingers in the cool water as they walked. Suddenly, they realized the car had left them behind. They were stranded with no houses or phones nearby. After a long walk, they found the car abandoned with an empty gas tank.

Gladys and Hinpoha had walked two miles to town only to realize they had no money for gas. The station owner refused to help without payment. Exhausted, Hinpoha leaned against a post, feeling the heat. They sent a wire from the telegraph office, waiting anxiously for a response. As time passed, hunger set in, and they couldn't afford dinner. They felt the weight of their situation, from carefree tourists to broke travelers. A storm approached, causing chaos at the station. Seeking shelter, they watched the storm unfold. Despite their struggles, Hinpoha found humor in their predicament.

"Chapa proposed, ""Why don't we search for oil? We're in the oil-rich area. There must be gasoline beneath our feet, and here we are missing out on it! It's like the stories where someone dies of thirst in the desert right next to a water source."" Suddenly, something dark leaped out from the shadows and landed at their feet. It was Mr. Bob, returning from his walk, carrying an apple in his mouth. Excited, the girls exclaimed. Hinpoha proclaimed, ""Where there's honey, there are bees, and where there are apples, there are trees. The famine is over, now it's time for a feast.""

Gladys insisted on getting the answer before moving forward. The boy, determined, demanded a nickel first. After receiving the nickel, he headed towards Number 43. They waited for his return while staying hidden from the house. In just five minutes, he came back. Surprised, Gladys handed it to him, and he swiftly ran down the street. Gasping, she questioned what had transpired. Hinpoha suggested looking for a candy store, as Sahwah would likely stop there. They visited three candy stores on Main Street, but found no clues. They then went to the department store, where the owner couldn't help them locate the missing quartet. Puzzled by the odd responses, they encountered the red-headed boy again, who offered information in exchange for another dime. Despite his dubious appearance, they considered hearing him out.|"['1.

In a small town, a mysterious car incident unfolds. A man demands ten cents from Gladys before sharing details about a car with a smashed lamp and fender. The proprietor recalls fixing a similar car with a broken headlight and fender. The car's occupants, four girls in tan suits, had left town but returned due to illness. The story intertwines with a messenger boy's encounter with the girls. As Gladys and her friends navigate the crowded streets, they unwittingly join a parade, trailing behind wild beast wagons and elephants.

During a circus parade, chaos erupted when an elephant playfully grabbed a camera from a car. The girls inside, Gladys and Medmangi, were startled. As the elephant teased them, Gladys accidentally bumped the car into a mountain prop, creating a loud noise. The commotion caused Mr. Bob, a noisy dog, to be wrapped in a robe to calm him down. Later, an anaconda escaped, causing panic in the crowd. The chaos escalated as the elephant trumpeted and thieves tried to take advantage of the situation by attempting to break into closed stores. Amid the confusion, the girls and their friends found themselves in the midst of a circus adventure beyond the parade.|"['1.

The girls found themselves unexpectedly taken on a wild ride when a man from a circus wagon leaped into their car, grabbing Gladys and steering the vehicle in pursuit of a snake. The chase led them through the streets until the snake entered a mansion. The man calmly followed the snake inside, returning with it coiled around him. Alarmed, Gladys quickly took over the wheel and drove away. As they left the circus chaos behind, they encountered two men arguing about a trunk, with Gladys recognizing her own trunk by its initials.

The grey car raced ahead, leaving Gladys and her Striped Beetle trailing behind. Passing through towns at high speed, they finally caught up when the car stopped at a hotel. Gladys approached, explaining they lost their trunk and the one the car had matched theirs. After unlocking it, they found it empty with initials matching Gladys's. The car's owner, Mr. Johnson, kicked the trunk and sped off. The police returned the trunk to Gladys, suspecting theft. Arriving in Chicago, they were met by an arresting officer. Initially spooked by Sahwah's disappearance, they realized it was just the eerie setting. With Sahwah's voice, they snapped back to reality, lost but not in a supernatural realm.|"['1.

Nyoda and her friends found themselves in a challenging situation during a car ride. They realized Sahwah might be missing. Nyoda, trying to navigate through a difficult path, quoted a car advertisement humorously. The car nearly got stuck but managed to turn back onto the road. Despite the muddy adventure, Nyoda kept a positive attitude, mentioning the benefits of mud baths. They searched for Sahwah with no luck, feeling fear in the eerie surroundings. The darkness and the unknown of the swamp made them anxious. The disappearance of the car lights heightened their unease. They felt vulnerable without the Glow-worm's light, surrounded by mysterious shadows. The disappearance of the light left them feeling exposed to the unknown shapes in the dark.|"['1.

Margery shivered and clung to Nyoda as they felt the swamp surrounding them like a living being. In the darkness, Sahwah was lost, and eerie sounds filled the air. Margery's vivid imagination made the night unforgettable, with imaginary sights and sounds haunting her. As they waited in the Glow-worm, hoping for Sahwah's return, dawn brought relief. The sunrise revealed a beautiful landscape, turning the treacherous swamp into a mere swamp. Searching for Sahwah, they found no trace near the lake, leading them to the farmhouse. The farm workers greeted them, and the mystery of Sahwah's disappearance deepened. From the farmhouse, they spotted another road, realizing Sahwah might have mistakenly taken that path in the darkness.|"[""1.

We discovered a narrow lane submerged in water, with deep footprints on the fresh road. Following the footprints, we expected to find Sahwah nearby, but they continued without pause. Passing only a deserted red barn covered in tobacco ads, we reached a highway where the footprints merged. Nyoda spotted Sahwah's coat button on the ground, indicating her proximity. A signpost revealed we were 20 miles from Lafayette. Traces of a car ahead of us were evident, until the footprints abruptly ceased, leaving us puzzled. Nyoda deduced Sahwah had been picked up by the car. Drying off in the sun, we improvised with hanging wet clothes for drying. Margery, feeling cold, wrapped herself in the Winnebago banner, a thoughtful item saved from the storm.|"['1.

Sal's friends, who had stayed at the Ft. Wayne hotel before us, were involved in daring thefts in Toledo. The police nearly caught them, prompting their escape in a car. Sal, in trouble with the law, sought refuge in a storeroom. She tricked Hinpoha into helping her leave Toledo. While traveling with the girls, Sal pretended to be innocent and unworldly, fooling them into trusting her. When the girls left her in the car to admire flowers, Sal seized the opportunity to drive back to Indianapolis, leaving them stranded. However, her plan failed when the car broke down. She abandoned it and took a train to Chicago. There, she attempted to pawn stolen items but was caught. A detective mistook us for Sal's group and trailed us to Chicago, suspecting we were involved in the thefts. Mrs. Moffat evicted us due to the false accusations, causing suspicion in town.

When we suddenly left town towards Indianapolis, a detective followed us, but a storm threw him off our trail. The next day near Lafayette, he caught up with us and decided to stick around. Our frantic escape upon realizing his presence removed any doubts about our identity. When he saw the scarab, it confirmed our connection. The arrest of Sal and her friends and the arrival of Margery's mother changed the situation at the police station. We chatted comfortably, sharing our experiences.

The person who slipped the scarab into Nyoda's pocket was part of a group that had planned a diamond heist but abandoned the idea due to police surveillance. They headed for Chicago while the girls were expected at Ft. Wayne. The real culprits missed their chance to plant the scarab on the girls and ended up dropping it into Nyoda's pocket in Rochester. Later, one of Sal's accomplices turned informant, revealing the stolen scarab's significance as a gang identifier. The police gathered evidence, including the scarab, linking the gang to a Boston theft. Nyoda's mother arrived at the police station after hearing about Margery's situation. The Winnebagos befriended the officers and were given a tour of the station, but Nyoda mysteriously vanished during the visit.|"[""1.

Sahwah quietly opened the door, and we peered inside. Our eyes were fixed on Nyoda and the Frog, who were standing apart, engaged in a lively conversation. The Frog, also known as Sherry, had been Nyoda's camp admirer from the previous summer. Despite a rocky start to their relationship, they had reconnected through letters and secret visits. The Frog had followed us discreetly, wearing goggles and a mustache as a disguise. He had even rescued us during a fire at the hotel and helped us escape. Misunderstandings led to comical situations where he was mistaken for a thief. Despite his heroic deeds, the Frog remained humble and never sought recognition. Eventually, all misunderstandings were cleared up, except for the curious case of the missing trunks, which remained a mystery.|"[""1.
