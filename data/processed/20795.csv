Meanwhile, at John Peerybingle's house, there was a commotion as they prepared to leave, with Mrs. Peerybingle taking her time to get the Baby ready. The Baby went through various stages of dressing and feeding before they were finally ready to depart. Mrs. Peerybingle and Miss Slowboy made themselves presentable, and after some delays, they all left for their destination. John easily lifted Mrs. Peerybingle into the cart without the need for a chair. As they set off, Miss Slowboy's legs were noted for their tendency to get grazed due to a peculiar fatality. Dot apologized for forgetting the Veal and Ham Pie and beer, emphasizing the importance of these items for their regular picnics at Bertha's.|"['1. What did Bertha describe the man as?\nA.

The journey on a foggy January day was chilly and raw, but Dot, Tilly Slowboy, and the Baby were undeterred by the cold. Dot found joy in the simple act of riding in a cart, while the Baby slept soundly. Despite the fog limiting visibility, there was much to see if one looked closely. The misty surroundings made the fireside more inviting and heightened anticipation for summer. The group encountered various scenes, from burning weeds to frozen canals promising future ice-skating. Boxer, a perceptive dog, guided the Blind Girl safely home, showcasing his understanding of her condition. Upon arrival, they were greeted warmly by friends, including May Fielding and her mother, and the jovial atmosphere was enhanced by a feast prepared for the occasion.|['1.

Caleb sat beside his daughter, Dot, who was seated next to her old school friend. The kind Carrier attended to the end of the table. Miss Slowboy was deliberately placed in isolation, with only a chair to prevent her from accidentally harming the Baby. Tilly gazed at the dolls and toys surrounding her, while they seemed equally intrigued by her presence. The elderly gentlemen near the street doors showed a keen interest in the gathering, pausing occasionally as if eavesdropping on the conversation. Tackleton, on the other hand, grew increasingly displeased as Dot and his intended bride, May, grew closer. Dot reminisced about their school days and the dreams they had of their future husbands.

During a cheerful gathering, John Peerybingle suggested a toast to celebrate the upcoming wedding day. As they enjoyed their meal, two guests, Dot and Bertha, seemed preoccupied. Dot, usually composed, struggled with her pipe, while Bertha abruptly left the table. The jolly Carrier bid farewell, leaving with his horse and cart. Meanwhile, Caleb, the Blind Girl's father, watched her with a thoughtful expression. The Blind Girl expressed her desire to see her loved ones just once. She shared her gratitude for their kindness towards her despite her blindness. Despite feeling a pang of sorrow about the upcoming wedding, she wished the couple all the happiness and acknowledged the groom's kindness.|['1.

"While talking, she had let go of May Fielding's hands and held her clothes in a posture of mixed pleading and affection. Gradually sinking down as she continued with her unusual confession, she eventually fell to the floor at her friend's feet, burying her tearful face in the fabric of her dress. Dot, the cheerful and industrious little Dot, was there, a beacon of light and support. It was fortunate that she was present, for the outcome could have been uncertain without her intervention. Before May or Caleb could speak further, Dot, regaining her composure, stepped in. ""Come on, dear Bertha! Come away with me! May, give her your arm. That's it. Look how composed she is already.

When night fell and tea was finished, Dot's demeanor shifted as she awaited the Carrier's return. Restless and anxious, her color fluctuated, unlike typical wives awaiting their husbands. The Carrier, content with a quiet corner by the fire, was easily pleased. Bertha, curious about their visitor, lost interest once described. Jovial John proposed a game of cribbage, diverting attention from the visitor. The Carrier, engrossed in the game, was startled by Tackleton's presence. They proceeded to Tackleton's counting-house, where a bright window revealed a shocking sight: the old man with false hair, whispering to Dot and holding her close.

The man clenched his hand tightly, then relaxed it, showing tenderness even in his weakness. As they left, his hand fell limply on a desk. The husband signaled affirmatively, and the horse carriage moved on. Boxer, the dog, ran joyfully around. After Tackleton escorted May and her mother home, Caleb sat by the fire, remorseful, wondering if he had deceived his daughter all along. The toys for the baby had stopped. The clock struck ten, and the Carrier sat troubled by the fire. Thoughts of revenge began to stir within him. The Stranger was under his roof. Could he commit a violent act? He felt consumed by the image of his beloved daughter with another man. She came to him, putting her hand on his, her expression shifting from alarmed to a dreadful smile of recognition.|"['1.

Even though he possessed immense power, he couldn't bring himself to harm her, as mercy outweighed his wrath. The emptiness beside him after she left was more painful than her presence, reminding him of his profound loss. The thought of her suffering made him consider using a gun against his enemy, but memories of her love and innocence halted his actions. Her image softened his heart, urging him to put down the weapon and weep. The Cricket reminded him of the warmth she brought to their home, transforming his anger into sorrow and regret.

Dot, a cheerful and skilled young woman, sat by the fire, sewing and singing happily to herself. Outside, there was music and laughter as a group of young people, including Dot's friend May and other girls, came to invite her to join their dance party. Despite having a talent for dancing, Dot declined playfully, pointing to her cooking and table preparations. She dismissed her admirers with a comical indifference. Later, a Carrier arrived, and Dot warmly welcomed him.

During the night, the Carrier sat quietly in the corner, reflecting on the events. The Cricket chirped faithfully, and the Household Fairies were busy with him. As dawn broke, he rose, feeling low. It was Tackleton's wedding day, and he had planned to go to church with Dot. However, their own wedding was now off. The Carrier expected Tackleton's visit and soon saw him approaching in a decorated chaise. Tackleton, dressed for his marriage, looked more like a bridegroom than himself.

"""It is a humble dwelling, Bertha, very meager and lacking. The house may struggle to withstand the harsh elements of another winter. It offers little protection from the wind and rain, just like your father in his worn coat,"" Dot spoke softly.

Looking across the room, Mary described her father as an aged man, burdened by work and worry, appearing weary and downtrodden. Despite his despondency, she admired his efforts towards a noble cause, honoring his dedication.

Overwhelmed with emotion, Bertha realized her blindness to her father's true character, now seeing his loving nature and sacrifices clearly. She embraced him, expressing profound gratitude for his unwavering care.

Through tears of affection, she acknowledged her previous misconceptions, now cherishing every detail of her father's appearance and character.

"Dot's complete focus had been fixed on the father and daughter during the conversation. However, as she glanced towards the little Hay-maker in the Moorish meadow, she noticed that the clock was about to strike. Instantly, she became nervous and excited. ""I would have done it, my dear, if I could have made her better than she was. But I might have made her worse, or not improved her at all. Bertha couldn't have been better,"" Caleb replied. Dot interjected, ""Unexpected changes, for the better, may occur, my dear. Don't be too startled if they do happen and affect you. Can you hear wheels on the road? You have a keen ear, Bertha. Are they wheels?"" Caleb was puzzled by Dot's behavior. She seemed so agitated that she could hardly breathe, leaning on a chair to steady herself. ""They are indeed wheels!"" she gasped.

The man took his leave with a grand gesture, grabbing the flowers and favors from his horse before giving it a swift kick. The day called for a grand celebration, and Dot spared no effort to make it a memorable feast.
