The snow-storm lasted a day, then cleared up overnight. The next morning, Tanglewood woke to a white wonderland. Peering through frost-covered windows, the small group saw a pristine hill-country in Berkshire. Excited, they bundled up and ventured out into the snow for a day of frosty fun. They slid down hills, tumbled, and even lost one of their own, Squash-blossom, only to find her emerging from a snow-bank with a bright red face. Eustace Bright then had them dig a snow cave, which promptly collapsed on them. Unharmed, they emerged from the ruins, covered in snow. After some play, Eustace wandered to Shadow Brook and the lake, marveling at the winter beauty. As the sun set, he headed home, intending to write poetry but was interrupted by Primrose and Periwinkle.|"['1.

Wrapped in a lion's skin, armed with a club, bow, and quiver, he sought the garden of the Hesperides. Along the way, he encountered kind-hearted maidens who warned him of the danger posed by the dragon with a hundred heads. They urged him to return home, away from the perilous adventure.

The stranger grew impatient at their objections. He casually raised his club and shattered a rock with a single blow. Seated on the grass, he recounted his life, starting from being cradled in a warrior's shield. As an infant, he strangled two serpents. In his youth, he slew a lion and battled a hydra with nine heads. The damsels prepared bread and grapes for him. He chased a swift stag for a year, fought half-horse, half-men, and cleaned a stable by diverting a river. He tamed wild horses, caught a wild bull, and conquered Hippolyta. He gave her enchanted girdle to his cousin's daughter. He also fought Geryon, a six-legged man. The maidens crowned him with flowers, acknowledging his renowned deeds.|"['1.

Upon reaching the beach, Hercules spotted an old man peacefully dozing off amidst the green shrubbery and clover. The hero had been travelling through forests, swinging his club at mighty oaks, eager to face giants and monsters. The damsels he had met earlier had guided him towards the Old Man of the Sea, who could reveal the secrets of the garden of the Hesperides. Hercules thanked the damsels for their kindness and set forth on his journey. As he approached the sleeping old man, the sea roared in the background.

Once upon a time, Hercules encountered a mysterious old man who seemed to be more sea creature than human. This old man had scales like a fish, webbed feet and hands like a duck, and a beard that resembled seaweed. Hercules realized this was the Old Man of the Sea, who could change his form at will. The Old Man tried to scare Hercules by transforming into various creatures like a stag, a sea-bird, a three-headed dog, and even a giant snake. But Hercules, determined and brave, held on tight despite the terrifying transformations. Eventually, the Old Man returned to his original form and demanded to know why Hercules was squeezing him so hard.

Once Hercules heard who had captured him, he understood that he needed to share all the information. The Old One was a sea dweller and roamed far and wide. He had heard of Hercules and his incredible feats. The Old Man guided Hercules on his journey to find the garden of the Hesperides. Hercules faced many challenges, including a giant named Antaeus, who gained strength from the earth itself. Hercules defeated Antaeus by lifting him off the ground. Continuing his travels, he reached Egypt, where he was imprisoned but managed to escape. Finally, on the shore of the vast ocean, Hercules spotted a massive cup floating towards him. Realizing it was meant to help him, he climbed in and rested, allowing the cup to carry him towards his next adventure.|['1.

After a long nap, Hercules woke to a loud noise from the golden cup he was in, floating towards an island. As he approached, he saw an enormous giant holding up the sky with eyes as big as a lake. The giant looked weary and burdened, like those overwhelmed by life's cares. The giant's face was immense, with a mile-long nose and a mouth just as wide. The giant roared like thunder, and a storm erupted around him, making it hard for Hercules to hear. The giant's legs disappeared into the tempest. Despite the giant's attempts to speak, his voice blended with the thunder. When the storm passed, the giant stood tall again, holding up the sky against the sunshine, dry even after the rain. The giant lamented that he couldn't fetch the golden apples from the Hesperides due to his sky-holding duty.|"['Question 1: What did Hercules see as he approached the island?\nA) A group of golden apples\nB) An enormous giant holding up the sky\nC) A stormy sea\nD) A rainbow in the sky\nE) A flock of birds flying overhead', 'Question 2: How did the giant appear to Hercules?\nA) Happy and carefree\nB) Enraged and aggressive\nC) Weary and burdened\nD) Playful and mischievous\nE) Calm and peaceful', ""Question 3: What did the giant's face look like?\nA) Small and delicate\nB) Round and chubby\nC) Immense, with a mile-long nose and wide mouth\nD) Hidden behind a mask\nE) Covered in tattoos"", 'Question 4: What happened when the giant roared?\nA) A gentle breeze blew through the island\nB) The sky turned pink\nC) A storm erupted, making it hard for Hercules to hear\nD) Flowers bloomed all around\nE) The sun set quickly', ""Question 5: Why couldn't the giant fetch the golden apples from the Hesperides?\nA) He was too lazy to go\nB) He was afraid of the Hesperides\nC) He was holding up the sky\nD) He didn't like golden apples\nE) He was too busy sleeping"", 'Question 6: How did the giant feel about not being able to fetch the golden apples?\nA) Excited\nB) Indifferent\nC) Sad and lamented\nD) Relieved\nE) Angry']"|['B) An enormous giant holding up the sky', 'C) Weary and burdened', 'C) Immense, with a mile-long nose and wide mouth', 'C) A storm erupted, making it hard for Hercules to hear', 'C) He was holding up the sky', 'C) Sad and lamented']
Atlas suggested that Hercules take his place in holding up the sky, offering to complete Hercules' task in return. Hercules, known for his strength, hesitated at first but eventually agreed. Once the sky was shifted to Hercules, Atlas celebrated his newfound freedom by dancing and leaping joyfully. He then stepped into the sea, disappearing from view as he walked on. Hercules, now burdened with the weight of the sky, began to worry about what would happen if Atlas didn't return. The sky's weight and the elements made Hercules uncomfortable, and he realized the immense responsibility he now bore. As he reflected on the simpler life of a shepherd, Hercules hoped Atlas would come back soon to relieve him of his duty.|"['1.

Long ago, Hercules met the giant Atlas while on a quest for golden apples. Atlas, who carried the sky on his shoulders, had just returned from the Hesperides garden with the apples. Hercules asked Atlas to hold the sky while he adjusted his lion's skin for comfort. Atlas hesitated, boasting about his strength and how long he had carried the sky. Hercules, growing impatient, made Atlas hold the sky briefly. Stars fell from the sky as Atlas chuckled, assuring Hercules he had not let stars fall in centuries. The two bantered about patience and strength, with Atlas suggesting Hercules might have to hold the sky for a thousand years. Despite the back-ache, Atlas had carried the sky longer. Hercules, determined, wanted to prove his strength and relieve the burden.|"[""1.

The giant agreed to give back the sky to Hercules for just five minutes, as he desired a break from his burden. Hercules swiftly retrieved the golden apples and left without heeding the giant's protests. The giant, known as Atlas, remains rooted in place, his voice now imagined in thunder. The student, Eustace, and Mr. Pringle discuss the tale, with Mr. Pringle cautioning Eustace against Gothicizing classical myths. Eustace defends his interpretation, arguing that these myths belong to all and should be open to reinterpretation. Mr. Pringle suggests Eustace try his hand at a legend of Apollo next, to which Eustace considers the challenge.|"['1.
