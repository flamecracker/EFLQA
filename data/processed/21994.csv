Dick confronted the Dwarf, ready for a deadly duel. The Dwarf, wearing a dirty yellow jacket, claimed to be a widower seeking new opportunities. However, Dick defended the honor of Princess Frutilla and refused to disclose the name of his beloved. As tensions rose, two lions with two heads each charged towards Dick.

At this moment, King Prigio watched the events unfold in the magic globe, fearing for Ricardo's life. Just as he was about to make a wish to the dwarf at Jericho, a giant vulture swooped in through the window, knocking off the king's wishing cap. The Fairy of the Desert, an ally of the dwarf, had arrived to cause mischief. The vulture flew away, leaving the king anxious as he looked back at the crystal ball. Would he see Ricardo in danger? To his relief, he saw Ricardo and his loyal dog, Pepper, bravely facing the dwarf and a fierce cat. With Pepper's help, Ricardo defeated the cat and then engaged in a sword fight with the dwarf.

Upon his return, Dick shared the encounter with a wasp, reminding the king of his gratitude towards Jaqueline. They decided not to worry the queen with the dangers Dick faced. One day, a colossal letter arrived for Dick, addressed in giant letters. The letter challenged Dick to a return match against the Giant. Despite feeling it was unfair to use the Cap of Darkness, Dick accepted the challenge to defeat the tyrant. Equipped with restored items, including a horn and mace, Dick faced the Giant in a tunnel.

As soon as Dick fled, the giant regained his composure. Jacqueline, unable to flee or use her fairy lessons, stood frozen. She had saved Dick but lost the sword and boots. The giant, not a man-eater, pondered what to do with her. He boasted of enjoying punishment but failed to mention the stolen livestock. Reluctant to take her home to his jealous wife, he decided to place her with the Earthquaker, who stirs only every fifty years. Carrying her across mountains, he reached a blue hill with a strange whirlwind. Helpless against it, he tossed Jacqueline into the whirlpool, which gently carried her into a stunning rocky hall with marble floors and a mysterious black void.|['1.

Jaqueline, now fully alert, transformed into an eagle to escape but was trapped in a powerful whirlpool of air. Unable to fly out, she turned back to her human form and discovered a living, black, soft, and strong substance at the edge of the darkness. This mysterious entity pulsed with a heartbeat.

Dick, a clever bird, led the king on a mysterious quest. The king, desperate to find the missing princess, turned to the magical crystal ball for answers. With Dick's help, they discovered a hill where the princess vanished. The king, filled with dread, demanded answers from Dick. The queen, trusting in Prigio's abilities, urged him to find a solution.

The king summoned the Grand Vizier, who swiftly readied the Flying Horse. King Prigio received a magnificent diamond and mounted the horse, soaring high above the earth. As night fell, the world below shrank to the size of a spinning top. Riding through the moon's silver dawn, he approached two enchanting ladies representing the bright and dark sides of the moon. They guided him to the Mountains of the Moon, where they entered a mysterious mountain filled with various forms of Stupidity. The dark lady revealed that this Stupidity could affect the world when the volcano erupted. King Prigio selected the Stupidity of the Learned, knowing its weighty impact.

From high above on the Flying Horse, King Prigio and Ricardo gazed down at the City of Manoa nestled in the mountains. The city sparkled with golden battlements and temples, adorned with intricate carvings of faces, beasts, and serpents. Massive stone walls enclosed the city, while pyramids loomed in the groves. Drums beat loudly from the temples as a wild crowd in shining armor gathered in the main square, incited by priests in terrifying masks. Amidst the chaos, a figure in serpent skins stood on a red stone column, pointing at his shadow. The people, frenzied and desperate, failed to notice the king's arrival until he descended slowly. The figure in serpent skins recognized King Prigio, lamenting the impending doom of the Earthquaker's awakening due to the failure to sacrifice a maiden.

The sun was nearing its highest point in the sky, and Prigio urged the Flying Horse onward. In just a few minutes, the sun would shine directly into the hollow hill's crater, awakening the Earthquaker from his slumber. As the light slanted down the hollow cone, the Flying Horse was pulled by a whirlpool of air towards the shadowy halls below. Nurses knelt and wept for the Earthquaker, while Jaqueline, pale but composed, stood apart. Ricardo, leaping off the horse, embraced Jaqueline, bringing her joy amidst the danger. King Prigio, holding a weighty object, approached the edge of the Earthquaker's abyss. The Earthquaker stirred as the sun's rays touched him, causing a great commotion.
