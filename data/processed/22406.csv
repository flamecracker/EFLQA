"_Alice._-- No, Uncle John, those tales are too childish for Willy and me. How about a story of elves riding by night or gnomes of the mine? Water-fairies could make Willy's eyes stay wide open, and Aunt Mary might even forget her knitting!  
_Uncle John._-- Let me tell you a story from long, long ago, before our oak tree was even an acorn. There was a cottage by a glen and a brook where a couple lived. The winter brought white flowers and snow-covered peaks. A young girl named Eva lived there, a restless spirit. One autumn, childlike forms from a cold mountain visited, creating frosty magic. But when spring arrived, these Little People of the Snow were terrified of the warmth. Eva bravely ventured out one mid-winter day and encountered a snow-maiden, embarking on a magical adventure beyond the great linden tree."|"['1.

Eva was enchanted by the snow-maiden's sweet words and followed her into a magical world of snow. They walked through a passage with white walls and a snowy vault above, feeling like they were in a winter wonderland. The snow-maiden led Eva to a stunning garden where the Little People of the Snow would play after their tasks were done. The garden was filled with snow-crafted versions of summer plants like palms and roses, all made of pure white snow. The snow-maiden explained how they created these beautiful scenes using the northern lights to light up their palaces. She then showed Eva a magnificent hall made of ice, where a joyful dance was happening with sparkling ice-cups and transparent cymbals. Eva was mesmerized by the sight until the cold air reminded her of her responsibilities. She hurried back, feeling guilty for neglecting her duties. But as they reached the cold outside air, Eva felt a sudden weariness and fell asleep on the snow, never to wake again. The snow-maiden, realizing Eva's fate, wailed in sorrow at the loss of her new friend.|"['1.
