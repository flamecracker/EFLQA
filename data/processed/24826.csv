Miss Wealthy gazed out the window at the serene lawn and the blue river. She contemplated asking Martha if everything looked right but stayed silent.

Martha had a young helper in the kitchen, so Miss Wealthy had work to do. The two girls walked slowly in the garden, arm in arm.

Rose reminisced about her fair maiden friend, Eglantine, a sweetbrier-bush by her window. Eglantine had two lovers, Sir Scraggo de Cedar and the fickle South Wind. Rose felt sorry for Sir Scraggo, who loved Eglantine deeply but was often ignored in favor of the South Wind's fleeting affections.

Rose shared a little rhyme she wrote about Larry Larkspur and Miss Poppy one summer, making Hildegarde highly delighted and eager for more. As they enjoyed the verses, Martha approached with a tray of creamy milk and freshly baked cookies. Delighted by the treats, they sat down for dinner at one o'clock as planned. Miss Wealthy then mentioned Dr. Abernethy, a distinguished physician who prescribes gentle exercise and lives in the stable with four legs and a tail.

The two girls were amazed and half expected to see a horse's head at the door. Instead, a majestic black cat named Dr. Samuel Johnson entered. Miss Wealthy introduced the cat to the girls and emphasized the importance of making a good first impression. The cat, with large yellow eyes, observed the girls gravely. One of the girls, Hildegarde, quickly mentioned that she had read 'Pilgrim's Progress' many times. Miss Wealthy was pleased and offered the cat almond-pudding. However, when a saucer was broken, there was a tense moment. Miss Wealthy tried to ease the situation, praising Martha's almond-pudding and reassuring everyone that accidents happen.

Rose asked Hildegarde about her reading of 'Pilgrim's Progress,' wanting to change the topic and uplift their hostess's mood. Hildegarde explained how she initially found the book dull as a child but was inspired by a story her father shared about Dr. Johnson's high regard for the book. This motivated her to read 'Pilgrim's Progress' with enthusiasm until she finished it. Miss Wealthy praised the importance of the book in education.

Miss Wealthy appeared content and expressed gratitude towards Rose for her offer to help. However, she suggested that the first day should be dedicated to play, as there was nothing urgent to be done. Miss Wealthy even mentioned that she might take a nap after lunch. Rose, following a nod from Hildegarde, reluctantly left her seat by the window to let Miss Wealthy rest comfortably. Upon hearing a faint sigh from Miss Wealthy, Rose noticed that the tidy on the chair had slipped and quickly fixed it. Miss Wealthy admired Rose's manners and thought highly of her and Hildegarde. Later, Rose went to her room decorated with roses, where she lay down to rest. Hildegarde sang a lullaby to help Rose fall asleep, showing care and kindness towards her new friend.|"['1.

Hildegarde admired the beauty of the day, feeling content and peaceful. She quietly left the room where Rose was sleeping peacefully, embodying the idea of sweet content. Downstairs, the house was quiet, with only Cousin Wealthy and Dr. Johnson napping. The serene atmosphere made Hildegarde feel like she was in an enchanted palace. She strolled out onto the lawn, savoring the beauty of the day. She refrained from picking the daisies because they looked so joyful. Hugging a majestic elm tree, she expressed gratitude for its grace. Hildegarde even followed a Camberwell Beauty butterfly, reflecting on how she had learned about butterflies in the past year. The butterfly, offended by her lack of previous knowledge, fluttered away.|[]|[]
"""I don't wonder!"" exclaimed the girl. ""But you should be careful, my dear. I know you now, and I don't think Bubble has more than two of your kind in his collection. I promised to gather all the butterflies and moths I could for him, and if you act too superior, I might start with you."" As a faint creak reached her ear from the garden, she recognized it as the sound of a wheelbarrow. ""Jeremiah! Boat! River! Now I remember what I wanted to do."" Rushing to the garden, she found Jeremiah wheeling away a large load of weeds. ""Oh, I didn't mean that!"" she laughed. ""I meant, is it safe for me to go in? Miss Bond mentioned I could go out on the river if you approved. Please say it's okay, Jeremiah!"" Jeremiah's demeanor lightened a bit as he assured her, ""She's steady as a rock, the boat. She may not be pretty, but she's reliable. She doesn't like boats, but I'll take you down and get her out for you."" Understanding that ""her"" referred to the boat, Hildegarde followed Jeremiah to the riverbank, where she found the boat-house and a moss-covered wharf. With the tide high, Jeremiah quickly brought out the green boat. ""I don't think I'll have any trouble,"" she said as she stepped into the boat and took the oars."|"['1.

Hildegarde floated along the river, admiring the beauty of nature around her. She noticed a cluster of purple bells growing on a rock above her, nodding cheerfully. Feeling a connection with the flowers, she greeted them and marveled at their beauty. As she continued her journey, she encountered a pine tree casting a perfect reflection on the water. Resting in its shadow, she pondered the unique experience of being both in a boat and under a tree simultaneously. Moving on, she discovered a serene cove with ferns dipping into the water, creating a picturesque scene. Exploring further, she found a nest with four spotted eggs, carefully hidden among the greenery. Hildegarde appreciated the wonders of the natural world and the peaceful moments it offered her.|"['1.

The small brown bird was in a frenzy of maternal alarm, causing Hildegarde to pull the boat away from the bank. She rowed along, filled with joy and thankfulness, surrounded by new wonders and beauties. She reflected on her past ignorance of nature, recalling when she only cared about city life.

As she rowed back home along the west bank, she encountered shallow waters filled with brown weeds that gently brushed against her boat. The afternoon sun cast a warm glow on the white and dusty highway nearby. Admiring the water-plants and willows along the shore, she encountered a splendid blue dragonfly resting on her oar. She admired its glistening armor and delicate wings before gently urging it to depart.

"He had no time to say more. I grabbed him by the shoulders, strong as I was then, and tossed him out the door like a sack of flour. Then I did the same to the other man who stood there stunned, like a fish out of water. They stumbled and sat there with mouths agape. ""Go home and take care of yourselves,"" I said firmly.

Miss Wealthy shared a tale with Hildegarde about Mildred's adventurous escapades. Mildred once disappeared after reading a story and fell asleep in a haystack, causing a frantic search.

"""There!"" exclaimed Hildegarde in satisfaction. ""I believe that's everything.

Bubble was surprised when the doctor unexpectedly told him to get off at the Bywood station instead of going back to work. The doctor instructed Bubble to look after a patient named Miss Chirk and find lodging until she was ready to return to New York. Bubble was taken aback by the doctor's sudden decision but was grateful for the opportunity. Meanwhile, a scorching heatwave swept over the region, making everyone uncomfortable, even in quiet Bywood. Miss Wealthy recalled a similar hot season in 1853 but found this one more severe. To combat the heat, the girls wore light muslin dresses, and Miss Wealthy took up crocheting with linen thread.

"""Oh, if we could only discover a suitable place!"" exclaimed Hildegarde, describing the town's suffering from the intense heat. ""If only there was an unoccupied home,"" she murmured, avoiding eye contact with Miss Wealthy, focusing on the river where they all sat on the porch awaiting the cooling afternoon breeze. Hildegarde shared the tale of Islip, with its Seaside Home where underprivileged children find respite, cared for by compassionate Sisters. Miss Wealthy remained silent, hands clasped, work forgotten. Rose turned pale, sensing impending trouble, while Hildegarde's excitement was evident.
