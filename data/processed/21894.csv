Situated at the head of Clearwater Lake, a stunning body of water with islands, the town was bordered by the Rick Rack River. The river, originating from the hills, was wild upstream but calm near Colby Hall. The Military Academy was a bit over half a mile from the train station, along a road flanked by the river and farms. Upon arrival, the boys were impressed by the Hall's stone structure, classrooms, dormitories, and the building housing Colonel Colby and the professors. The property had boat storage, bathhouses, a stable, a garage, and even a vegetable garden. Professor Brice assigned the boys their rooms, ensuring their trunks were brought up and unpacked.|['1.

In the letters sent to Colby Hall, the Rover boys asked to be near their friends, Spouter Powell, Gif Garrison, and their pals. Colonel Colby said he'd try to help, but many rooms were taken. Fatty offered to switch rooms so the cousins could be together. The boys found the rooms cozy with beds, desks, and closets. Spouter explained they could arrange the rooms as they pleased. Some doubled up beds for studying and sleeping. The twins made one room a hangout space. Fred and Jack went to check on Nappy Martell's old room and found him with Slugger and another boy. Nappy got angry and threatened them for a past incident. The boys wore uniforms like those from Putnam Hall and West Point.|"['1.

Jack advised against causing a disturbance early on, fearing trouble with Colonel Colby. He suggested that if Martell took the suitcase, he would likely return it the next day rather than risk stealing. The boys then returned to the others and unpacked their trunks. Spouter announced they would be measured for uniforms the next day. The boys would receive them immediately if the school had the right sizes; otherwise, they would be custom-made, taking around ten days. The trunks were soon taken away, providing more space. At dinner, the boys were assigned to a table led by a senior cadet named Ralph Mason. The meal was hearty and most were hungry after their journeys. The Rovers sat near acquaintances, avoiding Nappy Martell's group. Later, they met other students at the gymnasium, including a skilled mandolin player named Ned Lowe and a curious student named Dan Soppinger.|"['1.

"He led the way, and all of the Rover boys followed at a safe distance. They saw Walt enter a large living-room at the Hall, connected to the school library. Nappy Martell was casually reading a magazine at one of the library tables. In the living-room, Walt joined Ned Lowe, and they walked up behind Nappy. ""Why, yes, it was the strangest thing I ever saw,"" said Walt to Ned in a loud voice, ensuring Nappy could hear. ""The fellow seemed to come from a stack of cornstalks down in the cornfield.""

The boys learned from Spouter that May and her friends usually attended a church near Clearwater Hall. They decided to accompany the girls the next morning. At the church, they heard a good sermon and walked the girls back to their school. Later, Professor Lemm warned the boys to focus on their studies instead of horseplay. The school had elections for battalion officers, and the cadets enjoyed a parade and a feast after the results were announced.

The Rover boys discovered that Gif, Spouter, Ned Lowe, Walt Baxter, and Slugger Brown were part of the regular eleven. The scrub team mostly consisted of freshmen, with a few older cadets like Dan Soppinger. Gif emphasized giving their best and focused on squad work before games. With Mr. Crews, a former football player, assisting, the team quickly prepared for a match against the regulars. Gif urged them to improve, leading to better gameplay. During a match, Jack was unfairly tackled by Brown, causing injury. An investigation ensued, resulting in Brown being suspended from the team for unsportsmanlike conduct.

Slugger Brown was eager to learn his fate. Despite being informed that he would stay on the team as a substitute, he was not satisfied. The football captain explained that Mr. Crews wanted Brown off the team entirely but managed to keep him as a substitute. The captain emphasized the importance of playing cleanly and without unnecessary aggression. Brown, feeling unjustly treated due to his association with Nappy Martell, refused to accept the decision and threatened to quit if he couldn't play on the regular team.

Struggling against the strong wind and choppy waves, the Rover boys aimed to reach the shore near the girls' school. Jack suggested they face the wind directly to stay safe.
