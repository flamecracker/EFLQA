Nimble's mother was astonished when she first laid eyes on her delicate and tiny fawn. She doubted her ability to raise him for a life of adventure in the wild. Nimble's mother, a fan of Farmer Green's vegetables, likened her son's size to an overgrown beet top and his legs to pea pods. Despite his mother's concerns, Nimble was eager to explore.

However, Nimble, feeling spry and confident, didn't take her words seriously. One day, while his mother was sleeping, Nimble quietly slipped away into the forest, careful not to disturb her.

Nimble, a young deer, had a strong liking for water lilies. He didn't just admire them but enjoyed munching on the flat, round, glossy pads. At night, his mother would take him to the lake near Blue Mountain for a feast. However, Nimble couldn't stop thinking about carrots. He craved the taste of a real carrot, not just the word. Despite his constant pleas to visit Farmer Green's garden for carrots, his mother insisted they wait until the carrots were ready to eat. Nimble practiced being obedient and quick, hoping his mother would eventually take him to the garden.

Nimble's mother praised his progress, noting his increased speed. She cautioned him to follow orders precisely, emphasizing the importance of immediate obedience, as even a slight delay could be dangerous. Nimble agreed but soon forgot the instructions in his excitement to go to the garden at moonrise. Jimmy Rabbit spread the news to Fatty Coon and Cuffy Bear. As night fell, Nimble eagerly awaited the trip. His mother led him silently through the woods towards the pasture fence, expecting to see the moon from the hillside.

In the shadowy area where the darkness extended, Nimble and his mother were standing by the water, their sleek bodies gently touched by the waves as they ate. Unbeknownst to them, a blurry shape silently approached. Suddenly, a light swiftly moved towards them, but they had already vanished, leaving only ripples and swaying willow branches behind. A thunderous noise echoed, startling Nimble more than a previous whistle. In a rush, they sprinted towards safety, his mother setting a fast pace. Nimble felt grown-up for suggesting a quick escape, a first for him. He felt important for being part of a strange event by the lake.

"""A bullet!"" his mother exclaimed. She moved to a clearer spot among the trees and pointed to the moon in the sky. ""Look, it's still there, just as you've always seen it."" Nimble, as he grew older, didn't mind losing his spots. He found joy in something else - two new toys, a pair of horns. Though small, they suited him perfectly. Proudly named ""young Spike Horn,"" Nimble joined the other yearlings in playful mock battles. Unfortunately, after a mishap, Nimble worried he couldn't join the fun anymore.

After losing his horns, Nimble avoided his friends, not wanting them to see him. One day, he met Dodger, who had also lost his horns. Nimble realized all Spike Horns in the area had lost their horns too. In his first summer, Nimble missed visiting Farmer Green's carrot patch due to a party. When his second summer arrived, Nimble felt old enough to explore alone. He found carrots unappealing compared to the big green balls Jimmy Rabbit found. Nimble's mother praised the juicy and sweet carrots, buried in the ground. Despite Jimmy's preference for the green balls, Nimble's mother believed nothing was tastier than young carrots under the moonlight.|"[""1.

Nimble, a Spike Horn, once encountered Cuffy Bear near Blue Mountain. Nimble, cautious of Cuffy's sharp claws, avoided mock battles. One day, Nimble strayed up the mountain to escape old dog Spot. At a spring, Nimble met Cuffy, who seemed careless and sleepy. Nimble waited outside Cuffy's cave as a snowstorm raged, growing anxious. Peter Mink appeared, having tracked Broad Brook for mice. Despite the weather, Peter was determined to complete his hunt.|"[""1.

Nimble realized seeking help from Peter Mink was futile. Hungry, he pawed the snow for food. While nibbling, someone warned him not to step on them. Nimble asked for help watching for Cuffy Bear while he went to Cedar Swamp. Near the cave where he awaited Cuffy Bear before, Nimble remembered feeding on greenery under the snow. Suddenly, he saw Cuffy Bear at the cave's entrance after a long nap. Nimble explained the situation, mentioning hearing dog Spot. Nimble discovered new antlers sprouting, excited to engage in mock battles again. However, he worried if the Spike Horns had no horns. Looking into a pool, Nimble saw his new Y-shaped antlers with two points, bringing him immense joy.|"['1.

"If just one of them had been poked, things might have turned out differently. Then, maybe only one of them would have lost his cool. As they moved away from each other, they got angrier by the second. And when they turned and glared at each other, old Mr. Crow, perched in the pine tree, shouted, ""Don't stop! Keep it lively now!"" He screeched so loudly that his cousin Jasper Jay heard him from far away and rushed over to see what was happening. Nimble and Dodger staggered back from another fierce charge just as Jasper arrived. Mr. Crow loved watching others argue almost as much as he enjoyed watching fights. He didn't like to fight himself, but he loved seeing his neighbors tussle. Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay were amazed by the furious clash between Nimble and Dodger the Deer. The two animals charged at each other with such force that it seemed like their horns would break off. Sometimes they reared up and struck each other with their front hooves. Initially, whenever Nimble felt a blow, he fought even harder. But as Dodger's horns and hooves landed harsh blows, Nimble retaliated with more force. ""Not at all! What do you want me to do for you?

"""Nimble Deer, the Muley Cow, and the Fence Contest""

One bright morning, Nimble Deer greeted the Muley Cow with a cheerful ""Good morning, madam!"" As the Muley Cow replied, Nimble leaped over the fence into her pasture and back again into the back pasture without a single touch.

However, Mr. Crow intervened, allowing the Muley Cow to jump the fence once more.

"At first, during those moments, Nimble only spoke kindly to Jimmy Rabbit. However, he couldn't ignore the fact that Jimmy Rabbit always behaved strangely. He appeared to be lost in thought.

Jimmy Rabbit hosted a party where he cleverly used Nimble Deer's antlers as a hat-rack. However, when guests Billy Woodchuck and Fatty Coon couldn't reach to hang their coats, Jimmy Rabbit tried to discreetly signal Nimble to lower his head.
