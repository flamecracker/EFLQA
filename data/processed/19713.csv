Janko understood the task at hand. He sneaked into the garden and faced twelve stern guards with wide eyes. Remembering the Little Fox's advice, he bravely passed them as they seemed asleep with their eyes open. Janko made his way to the center of the garden and found the Grape-Vine pouring wine into a golden bucket. Excited, he grabbed a spade and started digging, unknowingly using the golden one. The loud sound awoke the guards, who caught him and brought him to the king. Janko explained that the Grape-Vine belonged to his father and vowed to retrieve it. The king proposed a deal: Janko could have the Grape-Vine if he fetched the Golden Apple-Tree. Guided by the Little Fox, Janko faced twenty-four watches of guards in the new garden.

The Old Woman had a peculiar request for the Prince. He had to guard her mare and foal for three nights to earn any horse from her stable. If they escaped, he risked losing his head.

Years passed, and the Poor Man toiled tirelessly day and night. His children grew up, left home, and started families of their own. After his wife passed away, he found himself old and alone. One evening, reminiscing about his past promises, he remembered the Beggar he had pledged to visit. Gathering the golden horse-shoes and silver bolts he had kept hidden, he set out with his donkey to follow the silver tracks. Passing through various bridges, he arrived at a Garden enclosed by walls adorned with precious gems. Inside, the Beggar welcomed him warmly, explaining that the animals he saw were once humans who led unkind lives.
