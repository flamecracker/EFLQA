"Frank's fears were unfounded. Despite some flaws, the latter part of the game was commendable. Merriwell was delighted.

A bee buzzed in the professor's mind. His plan was to escape into the wilderness to regain his health and claim a gold mine. Young Merriwell was asked by his father to investigate a camp. With the help of a prospector, they found the professor. Merriwell saved the professor's mining claim from being stolen. The professor disappeared, causing concern for his safety. Unscrupulous individuals could take advantage of him. A telephone message added to the worry. Merriwell, Clancy, and Ballard set out to seek help from Mr. Bradlaugh. They hoped to get guidance on how to handle the situation. Ballard's dream about the professor's absence became a topic of discussion.

Mr. Bradlaugh offered the use of his car, which was currently being repaired. He mentioned that there were motorbikes available at the mine if they needed to rush anywhere. He encouraged them to help locate the professor and then focus on forming a winning football team. The boys observed the bustling activities of the gold mine at night, with the stamp mill pounding ore and workers moving around with lights. They asked a blacksmith for directions to the superintendent's office amid the loud sounds of the mill. They eventually found the office where a man, identified as Nick Porter, was smoking a pipe. The superintendent, Pardo, indicated that Nick was known for his storytelling but had been quieter lately. Pardo then led them to where Nick was with another worker in the mill.|"['1.

"The helpful superintendent left his cozy chair and walked along a camp trail that led up a steep slope. At the top, part of the mill shone brightly against the dark sky. ""That's Bosley, the crusherman,"" he said. ""He'll guide you to find Porter. Bring him to my office for a quieter chat."" The crusherman, leaning on his shovel, pointed to the feed loft where Porter was. Frank and his friends followed the directions and found themselves in a noisy area with rows of stamp batteries. While searching the loft, Clancy signaled Frank towards Porter, who sat smoking a pipe. Suddenly, Porter pushed Clancy aside and swiftly disappeared down the stairs.

The stairs led down to the floor with boxes and plates of gold and silver in the mill. Amalgamators and batterymen worked amid the loud racket. The prospector, Porter, had vanished, leaving Frank and Clancy searching. Following the noise, they found rows of tanks in the cyanide plant. Porter, familiar with the area, leaped across the tanks, with the boys in pursuit. Porter tried to harm Ballard by making him fall into the cyanide solution, but Ballard managed to hold onto a plank to avoid being fully submerged. Pardo instructed Merry to help Ballard rinse off the cyanide in a nearby tank of clear water. The pursuit of the prospector almost turned tragic, but Ballard was saved from a dangerous fate.|['1.

The boys quickly realized that the motorbikes they were riding were excellent vehicles. With the bright searchlights cutting through the darkness, Merry and Clancy felt like they were flying down the trail. In no time, they reached Loco's adobe, where they decided to gather information. Clancy checked for any signs of a recently used horse at Pete's place while Frank knocked on the adobe's door to inquire. After their investigation, Clancy suggested they head to McGurvin's ranch to look for Porter. They rode fast, guided by the searchlights, towards the ranch, the last place before Happenchance where they could find water. Unfortunately, upon reaching the ranch, they saw only McGurvin reading inside. Realizing their mistake, they decided to rethink their search strategy.|"['1.

"""No, Clan. We can't be much more than half an hour from the mine; if we suppose that Porter had a full hour the start of us--it couldn't have been more than that--then he had only an hour and a half to ride here, and no time to pick up food and water and push his tired horse on into the desert. We'd better go back to Loco's and take the fork to Gold Hill.""

The rancher was not surprised to have visitors drop in on him at that hour. The better part of his income was derived from the sale of water, brought up from his well by burro power, to prospectors and others who happened along that way. Such customers were liable to straggle in from any quarter at any hour.

""'Pears mighty like I've seen you fellers some place before,"" said the rancher, staring hard at the boys. ""Say,"" and his face cleared, ""wasn't you along this way a few days ago with Barzy Blunt an' some more, runnin' some fool race or other.""

Merry and Blunt were rivals in various competitions, with Merry often coming out on top. Blunt's idea led to a relay Marathon where Frank and his friends emerged victorious. Despite this, Blunt remained unsatisfied, driven by false notions instilled by his upbringing.

Merry had a keen habit of observing his surroundings carefully. He had only visited the old camp of Happenchance once, but he remembered the route well from a previous trip with Nick Porter. Riding back to McGurvin's on a horse after a relay race, Merry used his observation skills to navigate through the landscape. His sharp eyes scanned the terrain, avoiding obstacles and staying on course with the help of landmarks. As they approached the mountains, Clancy recognized familiar landmarks and praised Merry's navigation. They eventually reached the narrow gap in the mountain wall. Inside, they found the remains of a building where they had discovered Professor Borrodaile living in primitive conditions. The room was now empty, leaving them surprised.

"""It's crucial to find the professor,"" Merry emphasized. ""Dad's message makes it our responsibility. Let's wait until morning, bring in the equipment, collect some samples, and try to rest a bit."" The motorcycles were stored in the rundown building, lights extinguished, and the boys settled on the hard clay floor with broken adobe chunks as pillows.

Clancy greeted him cheerfully, joking about their uncomfortable sleep. They refreshed themselves at a nearby spring, bantering as they washed up.

The ore found was wire gold, a rare and valuable type. Clancy and Chip discovered pieces of the ore scattered along the path, likely dropped by a thief in a hurry. Clancy pointed out the shiny chunks of gold on the ground, evidence of the thief's haste. As they gathered the scattered ore, they noticed a trail of gold leading through the ruined camp. Clancy remarked on the coincidence of finding the ore pieces in line with Ballard's dream of a golden trail. Chip, not one for superstition, remained skeptical but intrigued by the discovery. The boys decided to collect the ore and head back, pondering the mystery of the golden trail and its connection to the professor's claim.|"['1.

Professor Borrodaile's decision to stick to the yellow stepping-stones puzzled the boys. They hurriedly ate breakfast, excited about following the ore trail to catch the thief. After checking their motorbikes, they set off with canteens filled and rations packed. The scattered ore led them uphill and through a gap into the foothills, away from Gold Hill. The boys followed the irregular trail, guided by hoofprints left by the burro. They noticed additional horse tracks, causing concern. As they reached the end of the ore trail, they were surrounded by four horsemen, including Blunt, who recognized Merriwell. The unexpected encounter left the boys surprised and unsure of what would happen next.|"[""1.

"Blunt snapped, ""That's a lie! We're cow-punchers and athletes, not thieves. We were heading to a ranch beyond the Picket Posts after some Bar Z strays. We watered at the spring by old Happenchance yesterday afternoon, and reached our range at ten last night. Couldn't find the cattle, so we turned back before dawn. Found that ore trail half a mile from here and followed it until it ended. Heard you two coming and hid for a surprise. We can help find the professor, but it'll cost you a fight.

Frank and his opponent, Blunt, were getting ready for a wrestling match at the gym. Both stripped down to their gym clothes, ready to face off.

Blunt struggled to flip Merriwell over, but Merriwell remained unyielding. Suddenly, Merriwell shifted from defense to offense, surprising Blunt. Merriwell swiftly gained the upper hand, leaving Blunt stunned on his back. Blunt revealed that the professor was seen at McGurvin's and shared a suspicious conversation overheard in Gold Hill. It seemed the professor and Turkeyfoot were scheming to retrieve goods from Happenchance. Blunt urged Merriwell and Clancy to act quickly to thwart the plan at McGurvin's that afternoon.

"""Why do you want to apprehend him?"" he inquired. ""Outsmart him and leave it at that. Hop on your motorbikes, and we'll ride along with you in a hurry. We can reach the ranch in time to catch McGurvin and his gang off guard."" Merriwell understood the urgency. The sun was rising high, and the afternoon was approaching, along with the execution of the scheme against Borrodaile. Without delay, he dressed and, along with Clancy, started their motorcycles towards McGurvin's. The cowboys followed closely behind. Frank and Owen sped through the rugged terrain like shooting stars. With the daylight aiding their escape, they raced over the path covered the night before. Once again, the professor's claim was in jeopardy, and they pushed their motorcycles to the limit to reach McGurvin's and thwart the plotters' deceitful actions. The plan was executed as they left the motorbikes at a safe distance and stealthily approached McGurvin's corral. Concealed by the growing corn, Merry and Clancy cautiously advanced towards the house. Merry reached the cornfield's edge, where he spotted a flamboyantly dressed man with a red mustache seated comfortably. Opposite him sat Professor Phineas Borrodaile, looking alarmed. In the background were McGurvin and two rough-looking Arizonians. It was a clever move by Merry to rush ahead of the cowboys. Although"|"[""1.

Turkeyfoot, a deceitful character, misled the professor by pretending to be his friend and involving him in Heppner's plan.
