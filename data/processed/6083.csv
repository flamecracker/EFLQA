The rain poured heavily over the battlefield as Hal Paine and Chester Crawford sneaked from the American trenches under the cover of darkness. The vigilant sentinels kept watch as the two lieutenants headed towards the German lines, just ninety feet away. These American lads, once captains in the British army, had seen action with various allied forces before joining the American expeditionary forces in France. Carrying a wooden box with wire coils and armed with revolvers, they aimed to place the box near the German trenches for a secret mission. After a quiet night with no sniper shots or artillery fire, they returned to their lines, listening in on German conversations using a wiretap. Captain O'Neill, in charge of the American troops, appeared as they made their way back.|"['1.

Captain O'Neill instructed Hal to move south along the trenches to General Dupres' quarters with a message. The message was for Captain O'Neill to advance his troops ten yards, then move a hundred yards north, waiting to fire until the French troops did. Hal delivered the message, and Captain O'Neill's American troops silently left the trenches, ready for action. As they reached a group of shell holes, Captain O'Neill ordered his men to stay hidden for a surprise attack on the Germans. Amid the chaos, soldier Briggs bravely advanced alone, throwing a grenade through a loophole in the German parapet.

The Germans surrendered immediately when the young lad spoke, becoming prisoners of war. The French general then decided to halt the pursuit of the enemy, which disappointed the American troops eager to continue chasing the Germans. Hal and Chester understood the reasoning behind the French commander's decision, knowing the risks of advancing too far into enemy territory. As they returned to their trenches, they noticed a man approaching them. This man was Briggs, a soldier who Hal had helped enlist in the army. Hal hurried to catch up with Briggs, concerned that he might be too close to the German trenches. After throwing his last bomb at the Germans, Hal was relieved to see Briggs safe. The next day, Hal and Chester were commended by General Pershing for their bravery and resourcefulness, but the general also expressed concerns about a new mission that would require even more courage and skill.|"[""1.

Before proceeding, I must stress that this task is perilous, likely leading to the demise of one of you. Hence, the mission necessitates the involvement of at least two individuals. One to depart and return, the other to embark - and ideally return. Though both may not make it back, one must for the sake of national security. General Pershing then informed the young men of the escalating presence of German agents in the U.S. post the American declaration of war on Germany. The state department urgently requires a list of key German agents within America to safeguard coast defenses and munitions plants.

The man skillfully avoided a collision, but his vehicle hit the curb, causing him to fall off. As he got up, he noticed a car with three friends turning a corner at high speed. McKenzie checked his guns, knowing Hal's fear was the powerful motorcycles used in Germany. Hal guided them by instinct toward the Dutch border, keeping an eye on distant cars that he suspected were following. He cautiously approached the stopped cars ahead in the dark, suspecting they might be Germans. Hal's car closed in, and he realized one might contain his friend Chester.

As the big car neared, some of the Germans stepped into the road, signaling to stop. Hal noticed about a dozen men ahead, with many others around. These others seemed uninterested in the car but focused on their tasks. The German rifles fired, and Chester and McKenzie drew their revolvers, returning fire as Hal drove. Suddenly, the car exploded, jolting Chester back into his seat, while McKenzie fell out. Despite his fall, McKenzie quickly recovered and fired back as the Germans approached. Hal was nearing the Dutch border, guarded by Dutch soldiers. Chester and Stubbs followed, with McKenzie realizing they needed to get the crucial list out of German territory. McKenzie, known for his shooting skills, fired instinctively. Eventually, the group crossed into Dutch territory, showing Dutch passports to the officer in charge.

The bullets hindered his progress, but he reached safety among the Dutch troops. An officer warned the Germans that any bullet on Dutch soil would mean war. The friends were treated by a Dutch physician and later taken to Amsterdam under heavy guard. Herr Block offered to help them escape, revealing Holland's sympathy for the Allies.

The ongoing stalemate on the western front, stretching from the North Sea through Belgium, Flanders, and France towards Alsace-Lorraine, had the world anticipating the outbreak of a significant battle. Germany, emboldened by successes in the east, surprised by launching a fierce offensive in Italy under Field Marshal von Hindenburg. The Austrians, backed by German forces, swiftly reclaimed lost ground, threatening Italy's heartland. To counter this, French and British troops reinforced the Italian front. Meanwhile, the Allies planned offensives in Flanders and Cambrai, taking advantage of German distractions. Despite occasional German attacks, British and French forces steadily advanced. In Egypt, British troops made progress towards Jerusalem, while internal turmoil in Russia raised concerns. The Allies found hope in America's entry into the war, bolstering their cause against Germany. Recent victories near Vimy Ridge showcased Allied strength and determination.|"[""1.

The British troops, led by General Byng, advanced in a unique way during a crucial battle. Unlike traditional warfare tactics, they decided to surprise the enemy by not using heavy cannon fire before their advance. This departure from the norm caught the German forces off guard. The British tanks, resembling mythical monsters, slowly made their way across the battlefield towards the Hindenburg line, a key German defense. The tanks cleared the path for the infantry without any warning to the enemy. As dawn broke, the tanks approached the German defenses, causing surprise and confusion among the German troops. Despite the German attempts to defend their positions, the British tanks proved to be formidable and unstoppable. This surprise attack, without the usual heavy bombardment, led to the successful advance of the British troops towards Cambrai, a vital German stronghold.|"['1.

General Byng's report stated that the British captured around 5,000 prisoners on the first day of the offensive, along with a significant amount of artillery and munitions. Cambrai was on the verge of being taken by the British forces. The victory held immense strategic importance as it threatened the German defensive system in Flanders and along the entire battlefront. The British success also jeopardized the German communication lines at Douai, Cambrai, and St. Quentin. Trench systems near Havrincourt and the Canal du Nord were seized. Villages like Graincourt and Anneux were under British control. The soldiers were elated and anticipated further advances towards Cambrai and Berlin. Hal and Chester, not directly involved in the initial combat, assisted General Byng and awaited their chance for action.

The Canadians were successful, advancing their lines towards Douai, while General Byng's forces to the south didn't progress as far. In a tank explosion nearby, the crew emerged unharmed. Chester led some Canadians into the tank, despite their lack of experience. The tank jostled as it moved over the German trench, but continued forward, joining other tanks in attacking the enemy's second-line trenches.

The American boy, the French soldier, and the four Canadian soldiers quietly descended the stairs, just like Hal had done before. They cautiously approached the door of the room where the German officer was guarding his prisoners. Chester peeked through the keyhole and quickly assessed the situation. Unlike Hal, Chester proceeded with caution and strategy instead of force. Taking advantage of his German uniform, Chester devised a plan and whispered it to the others. Calmly, Chester entered the room and addressed the German officer, pretending to be a lieutenant. Hal, who had been injured, also played along. As they waited, enemies approached outside. Hal instructed everyone to hide in the dark room, ready to ambush the intruders as they entered.|"['1.

"A voice replied, and Chester found his hand held by his old friend, the British colonel. ""I'm glad to see you again,"" said Anderson, ""though this is quite a reception for old friends."" ""I found him back in the British lines,"" said the colonel. ""I was sent here to see a woman in this house and asked Stubbs to join me."" Three days later, Hal and Chester were safe in their quarters in the American lines. They had escaped the Germans and returned safely. Captain O'Neill approached them with a new mission.

Captain O'Neill led Hal and Chester to his car as German prisoners moved to the rear. Aeroplanes buzzed overhead, signaling in the dark. Hal saw colored flashes and flares from a pilot's pistol. The captain explained they needed a substitute for a man named Jean Brosseau, weak from service. Brosseau showed them a map of German positions. The Germans burrowed deep to avoid French artillery. Hal changed into Brosseau's dirty clothes to blend in. The sound of guns intensified. A messenger arrived, delivering urgent news. Captain O'Neill tore the message, realizing there was no time for Hal to reach his position behind enemy lines.|"[""1.

Hal and Captain O'Neill discussed a daring plan to infiltrate enemy lines by faking an aircraft crash to rescue trapped allies. Hal, dressed in ragged attire, boarded a biplane with Chester. As they flew over the battlefield, they observed the chaos below. In the darkness, lights marked villages and decoys aimed to confuse enemy aircraft. Approaching the frontlines, Hal saw the ongoing infantry attack and the hazardous conditions faced by soldiers. Guided by French and American pilots' lights, they targeted German batteries. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, they released bombs, disrupting enemy operations. The French artillery paused to clear the area for the biplane's simulated crash. With precision and teamwork, they executed the dangerous mission under the cover of darkness.|"[""1.

The altimeter on the biplane showed it was flying below 2,000 feet as Chester ignited a preparation on the plane's top to create flames. Hal steered the biplane down, pretending it was out of control, towards the French lines. As the German gunners saw the burning plane, they fired closer. The biplane fluttered and spiraled down, seemingly out of control. Chester saw Hal's face illuminated by the flames but realized it was part of their plan. The biplane stabilized briefly but then spiraled down again. Hal didn't intervene, allowing the plane to crash. Chester and Hal both leaped out before impact. They followed their orders to split up, each crawling in a different direction. The burning biplane was left behind, creating the illusion of a bombing machine shot down during operations.|"[""1.

Chester, after sneaking a hundred yards, hid in another hole and waited. The Germans who had been nearby approached the burning wreckage of the biplane. They seemed satisfied and didn't raise an alarm. Shells from distant trench guns exploded around them, causing them to scatter. Chester cautiously moved towards the front lines. As he advanced, the shells stopped bursting in his direction. He felt the support of Captain O'Neill and his superiors who had planned this risky mission. Until five minutes to 10 o'clock, Captain O'Neill had assured him of safety. The French artillery cleared a path for him while protecting him. Chester navigated through the darkness, dodging shells but remaining unharmed. The shells acted as a shield, allowing him to move freely behind enemy lines. Troops were present but hidden, unaware of anyone daring to advance openly. Chester consulted a map and a timetable, guiding his path towards safety until 10 o'clock when he would need to fend for himself.|"['1.

Chester's mind quickly grasped the pattern of the upcoming numbered square, recalling the time intervals. He hurried out of the shell hole, leaving the falling shells behind. Wondering about Hal's safety four squares away, he pondered if the French fire was paving a path for anyone. As the shells ceased on his square, it marked 24 minutes to 10 o'clock, the time for the French forces to advance. For ten minutes, the French fire would pause on that square where Hal and Chester were to reunite. Chester cautiously searched for the ruins of a demolished house, the meeting point with Hal. As he crept into the cellar, he encountered no one but sensed the presence of hidden French soldiers. Suddenly, a revolver shot was fired at him, narrowly missing. The Germans working nearby were forced to seek cover from incoming shells. Amidst the chaos, Chester swiftly adjusted his gas mask for protection against the fumes.|"['1.
