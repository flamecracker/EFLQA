Once upon a time, a troublesome Dragon caused chaos every Saturday, resting only at noon to avoid catching fire from the scorching sun. One fateful Saturday, the Dragon snatched the King's cherished Rocking Horse, leading the King to cry for days. However, after a week of tears, the King's perspective shifted. Encouraged by the Blue Bird's melody and the Butterfly's grace, the King resolved to save his people. With courage in his heart, he opened _The Book of Beasts_ to a page about a Hippogriff. In a flash, a magnificent white horse with wings emerged. As the Dragon approached, the King mounted the Hippogriff, urging it to fly to safety.

The people of Rotundia, a magical island, were just the right size due to their unique history. Tom, the gardener's son, attended school to win a prize, but his plans changed when the Princess promised to marry him. She even offered Tom her pet elephant, Fido, as a gift. Fido, a tiny but wise elephant, curled his trunk around Tom's fingers affectionately. Tom, excited about his impending marriage to the Princess and winning the history book prize, struggled to sleep due to the loud barking of the kingdom's only dog, a large Mexican lapdog. The next morning, Tom decided to investigate the dog's incessant barking by heading towards the pillar, a rock formation in the middle of the island.

In the land of Rotundia, kindness prevailed among all its inhabitants. One day, a large purple dragon with broken wings was found by a rocky pillar. Tom, a brave young boy, approached the dragon without fear. He offered the dragon currant buns from the bun tree, a unique tree that grew different kinds of food. The dragon, despite being ungracious, enjoyed the buns. Princess Mary Ann, known for her courage, suggested visiting the dragon with acid drops. The titled children took turns feeding the dragon, and it wagged its long purple tail in delight. However, the Princess's Uncle James, a wicked magician, had sinister plans.

Tom went home and shared the news with his elephant. The clever creature paid attention and then moved from Tom's lap to the table. It pointed to a date on the ornamental calendar - the fifteenth of August, the Princess's birthday. The elephant looked worriedly at Tom. Initially, the people of Rotundia enjoyed the dragon living by the pillar, feeding on bun trees. However, the dragon's mischievous behavior began to trouble them. It played hide-and-seek, cracked its tail like a whip, and small animals started disappearing. When the Princess's favorite rabbit vanished, followed by the disappearance of the Mexican lapdog and even the army, fear spread among the people.

"Early one morning, Tom visited the palace. Looking out at the downs where few rabbits played, he gathered white roses and playfully tossed them at the Princess's window to wake her.

The next day, Uncle James, a magician, arrived in his finest attire to take the Princess out. He emphasized the importance of thinking of others' happiness. As they approached the dragon, the townspeople demanded fairness and urged the Princess to give the dragon his birthday present.

Once upon a time, a dragon wound himself around a pillar, trying to capture the Princess. When the Princess cleverly taunted the dragon, it got so angry that it tried to fly at her, causing chaos. The spinning motion of the island caused all the animals to change sizes. Elephants became small, and guinea pigs grew big. The dragon, too, shrank and turned into a small creature. Meanwhile, the magician, Uncle James, also transformed into a small being. The Princess eventually married Lord Thomas Gardener, who was titled Clever Conqueror of the Dragon. The newlyweds rode an enormous elephant named Fido on their wedding tour. The story teaches us that true happiness comes from love and having what we need, just like the Princess and Lord Thomas with their elephant.|"[""1.

The doctor was amazed at the peculiar creature he found in Effie's eye. It had limbs, a tail, and even traces of wings. Excited, he called for the professor to examine the specimen. Effie's brother, Harry, then discovered a tiny newt in his tea, which the professor eagerly bought. Soon, more strange creatures started to appear all over the country, resembling dragons. Initially mistaken for lizards, the newspapers eventually acknowledged the alarming presence of dragons. These creatures, ranging from the size of earwigs to sheep, caused chaos and discomfort. The smaller ones invaded homes, while the larger ones flew around breathing fire.

The County Council and police tried their best, but offering the Princess' hand to dragon slayers was futile. In the past, one dragon and one Princess existed, but now there were more dragons than Princesses. The Council cremated dragons brought to their offices. Kids and boys delivered dead dragons daily. The police set up towers covered in glue to trap dragons. Despite efforts, more dragons appeared. Shops sold dragon poison, soap, and curtains. Effie and Harry grew tired of the night life, yearning for daylight. They decided to wake up St. George, the only one who knew how to handle dragons.

Effie and Harry decided to walk to St. George's Church hand in hand. Despite the numerous St. George's churches, they luckily chose the right path. The sun shone brightly as they walked, feeling brave and adventurous. The streets were empty except for dragons, swarming everywhere. Luckily, none were the right size to eat children, or the story might have ended there. Dragons lounged on pavements, roads, doorsteps, and rooftops. Even the fields were teeming with dragons. Effie held Harry's hand tightly, startled by a fat dragon brushing against her. The noise made her scream, causing a flight of dragons to take off into the sky. As they reached St. George's Church and found the door open, they entered but found St. George absent. They discovered his stone tomb outside. Despite their efforts to wake him, St. George remained unresponsive, revealing that things had changed since his time. The dragon ultimately captured the children, lifting them into the air.|"[""1.

Harry and Effie soared above the countryside, watching hedges, rivers, churches, and farmhouses pass by below much faster than from a speeding train. The enormous dragon they rode on flew steadily, ignoring other dragons in the sky. Eventually, the dragon landed on a mountain, exhausted from the long flight. Effie used a small knife to free herself from the dragon's grasp, leaving only a silk bow behind. Despite their efforts, they couldn't free Harry completely. Seeking refuge in a cave, they found a mysterious room with taps labeled for weather control. As they observed the world through a magical looking glass, they realized the dragons thrived due to the sunny weather. Effie tried to turn off the sunshine tap to bring cold and snow, but it was broken, causing chaos among the dragons below.|"['1.

"Effie turned the rain tap on, and the dragons began to move less until they were still, indicating the water had put out the fires inside them. They then used hail to ensure the dragons were no longer a threat. Effie hoped the waiting dragon was also defeated. They pondered what to do with the dead dragons, realizing burying them would take years and burning them was no longer an option. Effie found a tap labeled ""Waste"" and turned it on, washing away the dragons into the sea. The rain poured down, washing the dragons off the map. The dragons disappeared down the waste pipe. The taps got stuck on certain settings, influencing the climate. The tale ends with the dragons being forgotten, and the nation getting interested in new inventions."|"['1.

When the Prince's first tooth came in, celebrations were not just allowed, but expected. December eleventh became the official day for fireworks. Everyone eagerly displayed their loyalty while having fun. Fireworks, torchlight processions, and displays at the Crystal Palace filled the day. Even the most exclusive schools had half-days, and even children from humble backgrounds received a small sum to spend. George and Jane used their coins to buy a firework that took a while to light and fizzled out quickly. They watched neighboring gardens' fireworks and the grand ones at the Crystal Palace. As they watched, they saw a distant row of lights resembling fairy spears near the dark world's edge. The lights were more enchanting than the nearby bonfires. George explained that the stars were too far away for a visit. The siblings then set off on an adventure to the North Pole, where they encountered snow-covered fields, icicles, and even Arctic animals. They discovered a long, icy road lined with frost-covered trees and starry moonbeams, perfect for sliding towards the North Pole.|"[""1.

The grand slide is similar to regular slides, but once you start, you must continue unless you fall. George and Jane slid down rapidly, too fast to appreciate the scenery. They only glimpsed frosted trees, bright stars, a vast white world, and a dark night. The stars sparkled overhead and in the trees. Suddenly, a cry interrupted their slide. A sportsman with a gun appeared, seeking a firework to shoot a white grouse. George offered a squib, but the shooting reason had ceased. They declined, and the sportsman departed. Continuing their slide, they encountered a butterfly collector. Jane mentioned a needle book, and George's experiments had used all the needles.|"['1.

The collector wanted Jane to use a pin to preserve a magnificent Arctic moth, but Jane refused. Instead, she politely asked the moth to step outside. As they slid toward the North Pole, George and Jane found themselves in a heap of snow. They eventually reached the North Pole, a towering ice structure surrounded by colorful flames. George decided to plant the British flag at the top. Near the Pole, they discovered a beautiful dragon made of ice, frozen in place. Despite its terrifying appearance, the dragon was also captivating.|"['1.

The dragon was stunning with his deep blue and rainbow glitter. The North Pole rose like a diamond pillar from the dragon's icy coil, cracking occasionally from the cold. The crackling broke the white silence as the dragon lay like a jewel, flames rising around him. Suddenly, a crowd of brown, furry dwarfs appeared, dancing and joining hands around the fires. They were the sealskin dwarfs, made entirely of the finest sealskin. The dwarfs explained that they were thawing the dragon to wake him up and devour everyone except them. The dwarfs tied George and Jane to the North Pole, warning that the dragon would eat them first. The children, shivering from the cold, were comforted by a flurry of white feathers from grateful white grouse, burying them in warmth.|['1.

The children found warmth under the feathers, protected by the grouse and his friends from the sealskin dwarfs. The dragon, still frozen, could move at any moment. The grouse assured the children of their safe nest. Moths descended on the dwarfs, eating them until they vanished. The dragon, now free, carried the children southward. Dragons can move in the fourth dimension. The dragon melted near the bonfire, leaving the children in a pool of water. They were sent to bed with wet boots. Despite the dwarfs' demise, the Aurora Borealis still shines brightly on cold nights.|"['1.

Once upon a time, in a mystical kingdom, there lived a Queen and a King. The Queen, seeking a child, visited a witch who brewed a magical potion. The witch promised the child would have golden hair, blue eyes, and a soul as pure as lilies. The Queen drank the potion and returned home to find a baby girl in the cradle.

The Queen experienced unparalleled joy cradling her baby. Over time, the King excelled in magic but grew unpleasant. The Princess blossomed, becoming more beautiful and cherished each day. One day, as they fed goldfish, the King, in a foul mood, appeared with his raven. Annoyed, he hinted at the need for a clever son-in-law. Determined, he secluded the Princess on an island, guarded by a dragon and a griffin, challenging suitors to brave the Nine Whirlpools. The Queen, aided by a witch, reached the Princess.

Once upon a time, a Princess was trapped on an island surrounded by Nine Whirlpools. She awaited her deliverance as the years passed. A sailor-boy named Nigel, wise and brave, sailed with his uncle and saw a mysterious light from the Lone Tower above the whirlpools. His uncle warned him to stay away, but Nigel was drawn to the enchanting Princess's tale. For seven days, he observed the tower, learning its secrets.

Nigel discovered a secret on the island: for five minutes each day, the whirlpools quieted down, revealing the yellow sand as the tide receded. This daily occurrence happened five minutes earlier than the previous day. Armed with this knowledge and using the ship's chronometer, Nigel carefully timed the event. On the eighth day, five minutes before noon, he rowed to shore, beached his boat, and hid in a cave. As the whirlpools calmed, a beautiful Princess appeared. She explained that a dragon on the island turned to stone once a day, while a griffin slept at teatime. The Princess, busy preparing for her wedding, left Nigel with a math problem involving the dragon's sleep pattern and the tide's timing. Nigel struggled with the arithmetic using various methods but couldn't find the right answer.|"['1.

Nigel and the Princess devised a daring plan to outsmart the dragon and the griffin. With the tide receding, they sprinted onto the sands, where Nigel embraced the Princess and kissed her in defiance of the dragon. Enraged, the dragon pursued them, breathing fire and leaving a trail of destruction. As the dragon closed in on Nigel, the Princess clung to a cord, ready to act. Nigel, at the water's edge, saw the dragon turn to stone as sleep overtook it. He raced back to safety just as the tide rushed in.

Once upon a time, in an ancient castle where only ruins remained, a poor blacksmith named John had his forge set up. The castle was so old that only two small rooms were habitable. These rooms were offered to John rent-free since all the castle's lords had long passed away. John worked diligently at his forge, though most of the town's business went to the mayor, who had a grand forge in the town square with many apprentices and advanced equipment. Despite this, John managed to make a living from occasional jobs brought by travelers. He stored his tools and materials in a dungeon under the castle, a place of mystery with steps leading down to an unknown destination. Even the lords of the castle used to throw prisoners down these steps, and they never returned. The blacksmith and no one else dared to venture beyond the seventh step, as the secrets of the dungeon remained hidden.|"['1.

Two children used to peek at a dragon through an iron grating, hearing his sad mewing. As they grew older, news spread that a giant was approaching the town. The giant clashed with the dragon, causing chaos. The dragon, exhausted, planned to devour the town. The children intervened, tricking the dragon into believing the giant would eat him.

The Prince dismounted his elephant and dashed into the dense forest, seeking refuge from the dragon. Crawling on all fours, he found shelter in a hollow tree, hoping the dragon couldn't breach the thick bushes. As he rested, the woods remained eerily quiet, offering a sense of safety.

Edmund witnessed a colossal yellow dragon approaching, leaving a trail of destruction. Despite Edmund's master not believing his tale, he knew the dragon was real. As the dragon prepared to devour the town, Edmund sought refuge in a cave and encountered a cockatrice.

The young dragon sighed, and Edmund could hear it rising from bed. Soon, it emerged from its room, small in size compared to its mother. Edmund alerted the cockatrice, who then instructed the dragon to wait for its mother. While the dragon waited, the cockatrice whispered to Edmund, burning off a bit of his hair in the process. Without interrupting, Edmund listened intently. After the whispering, Edmund offered to show the hungry dragon where to find fire. Following Edmund, the dragon discovered a hole leading to a fiery pit. As the dragon ventured down, Edmund secured its tail with an iron hook, preventing its return. When the dragon returned, Edmund played a trick by pinching the dragon's tail, causing it to seek its drakling in the fiery pit. The dragon, being a caring mother, followed her drakling, leaving them to feast on their favorite food.
