Ni-ha-be and Rita, two Apache girls, rode their mustang ponies through the mountain pass. Ni-ha-be, the daughter of a chief, had coal-black eyes that could see far. Rita, adopted by Ni-ha-be's father, had brown eyes. Both girls wore fine antelope-skin garments embroidered with porcupine quills. As they rode, they spotted a white object near a bush. Curious, they dismounted to investigate. The Apache band, led by Many Bears, had encountered marks left by a United States military expedition. Many Bears decided not to pursue the cavalry, knowing they were headed out of Apache territory.

Rita sat on the grass, engrossed in an old magazine, while Many Bears and his warriors explored the area. Over sixty armed Indian warriors, equipped with modern weapons, gathered in a circle to discuss their next move. To-la-go-to-de, a proud chief, vowed not to return without confronting the Apaches. The discussion turned to the bravery of a young man named No Tongue and a boy named Yellow Head. They were determined to prove themselves in battle to avoid being ridiculed by their tribe. Murray, known for his silence, showed signs of anger as memories of a past Apache attack resurfaced. The group had believed they were safe in their mine and hacienda, but the unexpected arrival of the Apaches changed everything.|"['1.

"Cattle and horses were taken by the people, including the Spanish-Mexican lady who owned the mine and land. After burying her, they pursued the Apaches. The man, Steve, was advised not to head toward Texas due to Comanche presence. Instead, he was brought along for safety. The man assured Steve that he would not be sent back alone, as Indian knowledge would be crucial in the Arizona deserts. The Indian maiden was displeased by the white girl's language skills. The two girls, curious about lions, read from the ""talking leaves."" The Indian warrior, Red Wolf, displayed haughtiness towards them. Ni-ha-be, the chief's daughter, showed self-will, riding off with Rita. Red Wolf, although stern, softened his approach near the spring where the camp was being set up."|['1.

Many Bears, a seasoned warrior, had seen much of the white man's world. He had interacted with army officers, missionaries, and government agents. Yet, he was unimpressed by their written papers and printed materials. When Ni-ha-be, Rita, and Red Wolf approached him with news, Many Bears showed a rare smile. His lodge stood nearby, and his wife, Mother Dolores, a Mexican woman, awaited the girls. Dolores, although not Ni-ha-be's mother, commanded respect. She surprised the girls by cherishing a picture of a Spanish shrine. The Lipans, led by Red Wolf, were on a mission through rough terrain to track down a band of Apaches. The mountains and valleys ahead held the promise of adventure and danger.|"[""1.

Up they went, through craggy ravines and gorges for nearly an hour, then down almost as far, until they unexpectedly found what they sought. The valley wasn't as vast or beautiful as Many Bears' camp miles away. It lacked the broad plain, river, and distant forest. Yet, there was ample grass for weary horses, prompting To-la-go-to-de to decide to camp there for the night. With no tents or baggage, the Lipan war-party quickly set up camp. Before settling, every fifth brave was sent to hunt for fresh meat to preserve provisions. Steve, with his distinctive war-paint, stood out among the Lipans. Murray revealed how Steve was sold for six ponies and a pipe. The chasm's walls rose hundreds of feet, stunning Steve as they advanced. The antelope's majestic horns and wisdom were no match for Murray's rifle. The secrets of the range seemed unimportant for now.|"[""1.

In the Apache country, a strip of rock sparkled with yellow bits, hinting at hidden gold. Ni-ha-be and Rita sat with Mother Dolores in a colorful tent. Dolores, a skilled cook, prepared a meal over the fire. She made cornbread and fried venison, impressing the hungry chief. The girls communicated through signs and sweet voices, a common practice among outdoor dwellers. Despite their limited knowledge, Dolores's cooking skills stood out.

Red Wolf signaled to Ni-ha-be, urging her to hurry. Rita concealed the magazines in her cap and headed towards the grove near the corral. The Apache nation lacks stables or barns, corralling their horses and cattle when needed. Pack animals roamed freely while the freshest horses were tethered nearby for quick access. Rita found a secluded spot in the thick bushes to rest. Overwhelmed by a picture in the magazine resembling her past, she reminisced about a kind man who taught her to read. As she read the simple poetry, her headache grew, and she pondered the absence of a loved one in the magazine. Rita's emotions surfaced, blending Apache and English expressions as she searched for familiar voices in her surroundings.|"['1.

"The tales of hunting deer and tigers are often exaggerated, resembling ""fish stories."" Steve wished the buck was closer, despite his reliable rifle chosen by Murray.

The cougar snarled, but the hunters quickly reloaded, preventing an attack. The cougar's defeat led to a meal for the Lipans, who praised Steve's marksmanship.

When Steve and his friend left the ancient town ruins, they thought they were escaping solitude. The town was desolate, with scattered stone enclosures and no roofs. The windows had no glass, and the furniture was long gone. As they left, a group of rough-looking men on horseback and wagons approached. Their appearance would have intrigued any art lover. The men were heading towards Mexico but seemed lost. Led by Captain Skinner, they followed the footprints of Steve and Murray, who had killed a cougar.

Captain Skinner, a fair boss, directed three men to ride to a gap for a mission. They rode with cold venison for breakfast. At the gap, they waited hidden in bushes for their targets.

Rita, a white girl among them, had a vision that puzzled her. She planned to seek answers away from camp the next day.

Rita and Ni-ha-be cherished their three prized possessions, treating them as if they were alive, whispering secrets in the stillness of the night. Exhausted from their journey, they drifted into a dream-filled slumber. The next day, the young Apache girls, accustomed to horseback rides, were seen scolding boys to fetch their horses. But when Rita vanished, Many Bears grew anxious. Red Wolf set out to search, only to stumble upon three menacing pale-faces blocking their path. Despite the threat, Red Wolf stood his ground, armed with his lance and courage. Ni-ha-be's swift arrow struck one intruder, sending a clear message.

"Steve was amazed by Murray's expression. His face, usually tanned and lined with wrinkles, now appeared ghostly white, with blazing eyes. The tension was high, especially with Murray's nickname ""No Tongue"" hinting at a bad mood. The buckskin thongs worn by Indian warriors weren't just for show; they were strong and practical.

As Murray skillfully chiselled, he advised Steve on how to secure his property rights once they reached the settlements. He emphasized the importance of documenting every detail, from landmarks to compass directions. Despite uncertainties, Murray encouraged Steve, highlighting his youth and potential. Meanwhile, To-la-go-to-de led his Lipan warriors cautiously, awaiting news from the scouts. As night fell, they camped where Steve and Murray had halted. Anxious, To-la-go-to-de dispatched scouts to explore the pass. Unaware of the Apaches' departure, they missed the presence of pale-faced settlers. Captain Skinner, troubled by recent events, scoured the pass for clues. Finding buckskin thongs, he noted horse tracks leading out of the forest. With no sign of danger, the group continued their descent, eager to navigate the valley's exits.|"['1.

The Captain's sharp reply ended any talk about hunting that day. Despite having enough fresh meat, they discussed the Apache's recent movements. Captain Skinner mentioned the Apaches heading west, not their direction. One man suggested a day of hunting before moving closer to the Mexican border. Meanwhile, Ni-ha-be and Rita faced scolding from Mother Dolores. Many Bears ensured all had ponies for the journey. The squaws sensed danger, hurrying to care for the children. A mule carried a squaw and her pappoose, acting as a mobile transport. The squaw asserted her dignity by allowing her charges to ride ahead. Although quiet in public, Indian women are vocal among themselves. Rita searched magazines for Steve Harrison and Murray while riding slowly with Ni-ha-be.|"[""**1.

In the back of one of the magazines, Ni-ha-be discovered something that distracted her from the image of Send Warning. It was the Knotted Cord, a story that made her feel less sorry for the white women. Rita let her keep the magazine, but all Ni-ha-be found interesting were the beautiful dresses. She had never seen such outfits before and felt a mix of fascination and confusion. Ni-ha-be wanted to see a real pale-face woman dressed like those in the pictures. Rita, on the other hand, recalled forgotten memories stirred by the faces and dresses in the magazine. Dolores, who had seen similar dresses before near a military post, understood more than the others. Suddenly, Rita exclaimed in triumph, leaving her friends curious and eager to know what had excited her.|"[""1.

Rita found a simple short story about hunters and St. Bernard dogs in the Alps. The girls admired the pictures of the dogs and chamois. Ni-ha-be and Dolores were amazed by Rita's ability to translate the story from the magazine. The girls rode through the grassy plains and halted at a strong campsite by a river. Murray hunted deer easily, roasting venison over a fire. Steve obeyed Murray and fell asleep. Murray contemplated a plan better than fighting Apaches. The mustangs were in good condition for another journey. The friends rode off, leaving the Buckhorn Mine behind. Murray suddenly exclaimed as they rode on.|['1.

They had much to discuss, but certain sections of the path were pitch black, forcing them to grope their way like blind individuals. Progress was slower at night, and Murray's estimate of their arrival time in the valley was almost accurate. As the sun rose, they stood at the forest's edge, using a spyglass to observe the miners' wagons in the distance. Despite riding faster, catching up to the miners seemed like a challenge due to their head start. Murray decided they needed to intercept them to prevent any mishaps. Meanwhile, Captain Skinner noticed signs of danger ahead and gathered his men, while Many Bears and his warriors prepared to defend their camp against any threats. Steve was amazed by Murray's trust in the Apaches, contrasting his usual caution around them. Murray's confidence stemmed from his understanding of Indian customs, a trait Steve admired but couldn't fully comprehend.|"['1.

To-la-go-to-de and his Lipans could have witnessed Captain Skinner and his men leaving on their expedition if they had moved a bit earlier. They were puzzled by the appearance of the pale-faces, wondering where they came from. The miners met the Lipans bravely, although they were taken captive. The Lipans were impressed by the horses and mules in the camp. The miners were bound to trees while the Lipans took over the camp. The Lipans considered the stolen horses their own.

Even old Two Knives, known for his cunning, made a mistake by trying to scare the fearless miners. The miners were ready to fight the Lipans to retrieve what was taken. When the Lipans threatened to charge, they faced a line of pale-faces armed with repeating rifles. The rifles fired rapidly, causing the Lipans to retreat in disarray. Captain Skinner's men maintained cool accuracy in their shooting. The Lipans, angry but wise, took a break to regroup. The chief ordered a search for a ford to cross the river. Surprisingly, squaws and children found the ford near the camp, causing a commotion. Discipline was enforced by punishing those who disputed over the discovery. The night was spent in a bivouac, which was comfortable for the experienced band. Memories lingered, hazy like the sky's streaks, as they settled in for the night under the stars.|"[""1.

Many Bears was troubled. He wanted to travel west quickly, but his tribe's enemies were nearby. Captain Skinner and his men were also a concern. Many Bears felt the weight of being a chief, making important decisions. Murray tried to advise peace, but the young braves were eager for war.

A group of Lipans suddenly arrived on horseback, their hands still bound. Despite not understanding the fierce words exchanged, the warriors' gestures were clear. Some tended to wounds, others mourned fallen comrades. A tall Lipan faced Captain Skinner, discussing dividing spoils and returning prisoners' weapons. The Lipans reluctantly agreed, planning retribution once the battle with the Apaches was over. Captain Skinner and his men then entered the camp to negotiate the division of property. Both sides felt they were sacrificing, but only the miners knew the true extent of what they were regaining.|['1.

Captain Skinner addressed his men after a successful rescue, mentioning a water source and the need to prepare for possible retaliation from the Lipans. The miners, aware of the danger, concealed their gold in the wagon. They decided to leave the gold hidden under a false bottom to avoid detection by the Lipans. As they prepared to depart, messengers arrived to inform them of To-la-go-to-de's readiness. The miners were cautious, knowing the Lipans were observing their every move. Despite a hearty supper, they carried minimal provisions due to the weight of the gold. Many Bears, known for his eating speed, was admired for his skills.

Send Warning's advice was wise and practical. As a respected chief, his words carried weight among the tribe. The urgency to prepare for crossing the river was clear, and the need to secure their ponies was emphasized. Murray, although not a war strategist, recognized the importance of having the river as a barrier against potential attackers. Many Bears, a seasoned chief, quickly rectified the oversight of having the river behind them in case of a battle. As the sun set, the young braves herded the ponies across the ford, while the mischievous youngsters enjoyed some playful antics in the water. Steve, feeling the need to leave the Apache camp with his friend Red Wolf, observed the preparations for the crossing and hoped that their actions would deter any potential conflict with the Lipans.|['1.

"Two Knives and Skinner rode out together ahead of their group after dinner, with the sun setting but still a while before dark. The miners, carrying extra weight, were mounted but left no guards at camp. Two Knives questioned this, but Skinner reasoned, ""No use leaving men. Lipans might attack. Need all to fight Apaches."" Two Knives deferred to Skinner, knowing the miners would return for their belongings. Two Knives planned to surprise the Apaches on the right, while the miners rode straight ahead.

"He never imagined finding a ford near the village, and there were no women to help or show him. Over a mile down, he reached the wide, rippling shallows the Apache fighters had told their leader about, and he guided his group into it without hesitation. Their desire to leave the United States, especially that area, must have been strong. They were restless until they crossed this second ""fork"" too. They had to search for food unless they wanted to go hungry. They set up camp, unsaddled the tired horses, except for a few ridden by hunters, and then the hungry miners could finally ponder if the Lipans were searching the prairie for them. ""I can tell you,"" the miner who shot the unbranded Mexican steer said. ""There were more. Wild like buffalo. They're unclaimed cattle."" Captain Skinner added, ""Plenty of ownerless herds here. The natives hunt them for meat, just like we did. Not the best food. I prefer deer meat."" ""We won't be safe, boys, till we reach a town. We can split up later, but we should stick together for now.

Many Bears, anticipating an attack, positioned his braves to intercept the approaching Lipans. The young Apache warrior, defying orders, played a crucial role in alerting his people. As the Lipans advanced, they were ambushed by the Apaches, resulting in a fierce battle. Despite initial success, the Lipans were swiftly outmaneuvered and suffered casualties. The Lipans, recognizing defeat, retreated swiftly, leaving behind captured warriors. The Lipans blamed Captain Skinner for their loss and retaliated by burning wagons and seizing plunder.

The Apaches strategically positioned their wounded and animals ahead as they retreated through the pass, eager for a final strike. The warriors, filled with anger, rode behind, anticipating a chance for one last battle. As night fell, thoughts of revenge brewed among them. Crossing the mountains would grant them safety, but their vengeful minds were unpredictable. Meanwhile, Murray and Steve, seeking their Lipan foes, were led to a lodge reserved for them, a gesture of respect from Many Bear. Despite the honor, Murray couldn't rest, recalling his captivity. Approaching the chief's lodges, Murray encountered a stout squaw, Mother Dolores. Their conversation in Mexican Spanish intrigued Ni-ha-be and Rita, stirring unexpected emotions.

Murray cautiously questioned Dolores, noticing her strong Apache influence. Ni-ha-be wanted to interject but Rita remained silent, feeling as though Dolores was speaking directly to her. Murray, realizing Dolores' identity, hurried away, leaving Dolores curious about his abrupt departure. Meanwhile, Steve, puzzled by Murray's absence, observed the Apache horsemen returning victorious. Soon after, the Lipans, guarded by Apaches, heard a warning signal from Murray. With his swift actions, he freed the captives, guiding them towards escape. Choosing horses, they silently rode towards the river, swimming across without hesitation.

Ni-ha-be's father arrived swiftly at the campfire for a venison steak. Dolores had it ready on the coals. While the steak cooked, she thought of Send Warning and the potential of another clash with the Lipans. Murray was questioned by the squad's chief about a possible fight. The Apaches quickened their pace, gathering more warriors as they neared the camp. Reports came in about the absence of enemies, disappointing the group. They decided to collect only what they could carry quickly. After a hearty breakfast, they unpacked their loot, expressing regret for leaving some behind. The men found comfort in their treasures, bringing peace to their weary faces. Captain Skinner called them to ride through a wild region, passing the remnants of old settlements.
