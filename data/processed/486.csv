Dorothy had a sudden adventure when a windstorm blew her hen-coop away from the ship. Despite the chaos, she remained calm and managed to stay afloat on the coop's wooden bottom. As she drifted on the vast ocean, the ship grew smaller in the distance. The storm eventually calmed down, and Dorothy, wet and uncomfortable, decided to rest and wait for her fate. She fell asleep and dreamt of her home in Kansas. Upon waking to a hen cackling, she realized her predicament as a castaway at sea. The hen explained how she clung to the coop, avoiding drowning in the rough waters. Dorothy's unexpected journey had just begun, and the vast ocean surrounded her with uncertainty.|['1.

The yellow hen, usually silent, found her voice and shared her thoughts with Dorothy. The hen, named Billina, revealed that she had never spoken before but found it natural to respond when asked a question. Dorothy, surprised by the hen's ability to talk, compared it to the animals in the Land of Oz. As they approached a beautiful land, Billina explained her habits, like laying eggs every morning and preferring a quiet spot for nesting. The land they were nearing had sandy beaches, rocky hills, and green trees but no signs of people. Dorothy, eager to reach the shore, quickly made her way there after Billina flew ahead. Once ashore, Dorothy dried her wet shoes and socks under the sun.|['1.

Dorothy was deep in thought after what Billina had said. It almost ruined her appetite for breakfast. Meanwhile, the yellow hen pecked away contentedly at the sand. Billina showed Dorothy where she had found something in the sand. As Dorothy dug, she uncovered a large golden key. She speculated on its origin and purpose. Looking around, she saw no signs of a house nearby. She found strange markings on the sand further inland. The yellow hen warned about automobiles, but Dorothy reasoned they were in a new, undiscovered land without such things. Eventually, Dorothy found trees bearing lunch boxes and dinner pails. She enjoyed a delicious lunch from one of the lunch boxes and decided to take a dinner pail for later. Excited to explore, she and Billina set off to discover more about their mysterious surroundings.|"['1.

In a magical land where lunch-boxes and dinner-pails grow on trees, Dorothy and her talking hen, Billina, encounter strange creatures known as Wheelers. These beings have wheels instead of hands and feet, dressed in vibrant clothes and rolling swiftly. As the Wheelers approach, Dorothy and Billina seek refuge on a hill of rocks, where a hidden path leads to the top. At the summit, they discover a large round rock with a crack that hints at a secret chamber. Billina suggests the crack could be unlocked to reveal treasures like diamonds and gold.

Dorothy found a golden key in her pocket and used it to open a hidden chamber behind a rock. Inside, she saw a man made of burnished copper with joints like a knight's armor. The man was a mechanical being created by Smith & Tinker, capable of thinking, speaking, and moving with clockwork mechanisms. The copper man shared that he was bought by a cruel king but couldn't be harmed as he wasn't alive. The yellow hen was amazed by the mechanical man's abilities, though she thought it might be a gimmick. The copper man thanked Dorothy for rescuing him and shared his story briefly, mentioning his manufacturers and the cruel King of Ev.|"['1.

"Once upon a time, a cruel king had a lovely wife and ten beautiful children - five boys and five girls. In a fit of anger, he sold them all to the Nome King, who used magic to transform them into other forms and placed them in his underground palace as decorations. The King of Ev later regretted his actions and attempted to rescue his family but failed. In despair, he locked a machine in a rock, threw the key into the ocean, and drowned himself.

The machine, named Tiktok, explained that it could tell time by speaking and never needed sleep. Tiktok assured Dorothy that he could wake her up at any desired hour. The machine also shared that the Wheelers, although mischievous, were harmless to those who dared to fight them. Dorothy wound up Tiktok's voice, allowing him to run for twenty-four hours. While Tiktok thought, Dorothy had her dinner from a tin pail, offering some to Tiktok, who declined because he was a machine. She then offered some to Billina, the hen, who preferred her bugs and ants. Tiktok shared that the trees belonged to the royal family of Ev, but with no ruler currently, the Wheelers claimed the trees for themselves."|"['1.

"""No; they only inhabit a small portion of it just back of the woods,"" answered the machine.

""It is true,"" said Dorothy. ""I met him in the Land of Oz, where he traveled with me to see the Wizard. But it seemed he thought just as well before getting brains.""

""I know,"" said Tiktok. ""There was a revolution in Oz, and the Scarecrow was deposed by General Jinjur, who was then deposed by a girl named Ozma, now the ruler of Oz.""

Clatter! The dinner-pail banged against the Wheelers, causing chaos. Startled, they scattered in fear, except for their leader. Tiktok, a copper-handed being, subdued the leader, revealing the Wheelers' weakness: they couldn't harm anyone. The leader, in distress, confessed their secret plan to scare people away. Dorothy, empathetic, urged the Wheeler to stop frightening children. The Wheeler, relieved, promised to change their ways. Tiktok, holding the Wheeler captive, advised them to mend their mischief.

The Wheeler stated that Princess Langwidere was vain and lived surrounded by mirrors to admire herself. As they left the forest, they saw a beautiful valley with fruit trees, green fields, and farmhouses leading to the royal palace. The palace had tall spires, surrounded by gardens with fountains and marble statues. Approaching the palace, they found a sign saying the owner was absent. They followed the sign to the left wing, where they encountered Princess Langwidere's room filled with mirrors. The princess had thirty heads stored in her cabinet, each in a separate velvet-lined cupboard with gold numbers. She would change heads to maintain her beauty.

In the morning, the Princess would rise from her crystal bed and select a head from one of the velvet-lined cupboards in her cabinet. Using the mirror, she would neatly place the chosen head, then call her maids to dress her in a simple white outfit that matched all the heads she possessed. With thirty heads of varying beauty, each unique in hair color, eye color, nose shape, and mouth size, the Princess could change her appearance at will. However, one head, No. 17, with black hair and dark eyes, had a fiery and haughty temperament that often caused trouble. When visitors arrived, the Princess, intrigued by Dorothy's unique charm, decided to exchange heads with her, claiming her will was law in the Land of Ev.

Billina, on the other hand, was proud of standing up to a speckled rooster in the chicken house. Dorothy, who witnessed the scene, reprimanded Billina for her slang and advised her against associating with common chickens. Despite the disagreement, Billina remained firm in her self-defense, asserting her independence and upbringing in the United States.|"['1.

"The Tiger, eyeing Billina hungrily, remarked, ""Your appearance makes me hungry, but eating you wouldn't satisfy me for long."" Dorothy then brought Billina to the drawing-room where Tiktok, sitting between the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman, joined Ozma and Princess Langwidere. The Tin Woodman shared his army's composition, with officers being more reliable than common soldiers. Ozma revealed that the Nome King had enslaved the wife and children of the former King of Ev. To rescue them, Glinda provided a magic carpet to cross the desert. The Princess explained that the Nome King transformed the captives into ornaments. Ozma described the Nome King as the ruler of the Underground World, where precious gems and metals are hidden. Despite the dangers, they resolved to confront the Nome King, with the Scarecrow expressing apprehension due to being made of straw."|"[""1.

Princess Langwidere, tired of ruling her kingdom, wished success to the visitors from Oz. Though she stayed indoors due to the heat, the palace staff ensured their comfort. The Army of twenty-seven was well-fed and housed. The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger roamed freely, causing some fright but no harm. The Hungry Tiger, with a massive appetite, requested a feast. Dorothy learned about Ozma's adventures and how she reclaimed her throne with the help of friends like the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman. Dorothy shared her own adventures and joined her friends to find the Sawhorse, now gold-shod by Ozma. They met the Sawhorse, who humbly accepted his magical existence and obedience.

In the valley, a grand procession set off from the palace at dawn towards the Nome King's domain. Ozma led the way in a golden chariot with Dorothy and Billina. Following were the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Tiktok, with the Army marching proudly behind. The generals oversaw the officers down to the private soldier. As they journeyed, Billina flew off suddenly, prompting a brief stop. The Scarecrow retrieved an egg she found, considering it a keepsake. Continuing, they approached a narrow path between mountains. Ahead stood a giant iron man pounding the earth with a massive mallet. The travelers had to pass single file through this challenging terrain.|"[""Question 1: Who led the grand procession from the palace towards the Nome King's domain?\nA) Dorothy\nB) Scarecrow\nC) Ozma\nD) Tin Woodman\nE) Tiktok"", 'Question 2: Who found an egg during the journey and considered it a keepsake?\nA) Tin Woodman\nB) Tiktok\nC) Scarecrow\nD) Dorothy\nE) Billina', 'Question 3: What prompted a brief stop during the journey of the grand procession?\nA) A sudden storm\nB) A fallen tree\nC) A discovery by Billina\nD) A mechanical issue with Tiktok\nE) An ambush by enemies', 'Question 4: Who had to pass single file through a narrow path between mountains?\nA) Army\nB) Generals\nC) Officers\nD) Private soldiers\nE) Travelers', 'Question 5: What was the giant obstacle the travelers encountered on their journey?\nA) Giant spider\nB) Giant dragon\nC) Giant iron man\nD) Giant troll\nE) Giant ogre', 'Question 6: Who was pounding the earth with a massive mallet in front of the travelers?\nA) Scarecrow\nB) Tin Woodman\nC) Tiktok\nD) Dorothy\nE) Giant iron man']"|['C) Ozma', 'E) Billina', 'C) A discovery by Billina', 'E) Travelers', 'C) Giant iron man', 'E) Giant iron man']
They stopped at a safe distance from the giant iron mallet. The magic carpet couldn't shield them from dangers in the air like this. Tiktok praised the iron giant's craftsmanship, made by Smith & Tinker to guard the underground palace. As the mallet struck the path with thunderous blows, the Scarecrow noticed a momentary gap beneath the giant. The Tiger carried Dorothy to safety, followed by Tiktok and the Tin Woodman. The generals hesitated, fearing the hammer. The Lion and Tiger bravely carried the officers across, but the private was left behind. The Sawhorse tried but was hit, leaving him dazed. The Scarecrow cushioned the private's fall, sustaining minor injuries. As they approached the dark mountain blocking their path, the silence grew eerie without the usual sounds of nature.|"['1.

Ozma and Dorothy, along with their companions, were startled by the sudden jeering laughter echoing through the mountain pass. The path ahead was blocked by a massive mountain, forcing them to halt near a rock wall. Strange rock-like figures, resembling the very mountain they clung to, darted around the rocky surface in an erratic manner. These rock fairies served the Nome King, as informed by a machine in their group. Despite the eerie atmosphere, the group continued forward, passing through a jeweled passage into a grandly furnished cavern where the Nome King awaited them on his rock throne. The King, resembling the rocks around him, appeared amiable but firm in his decision to keep the Queen and her children.

"The king expressed his disdain for cruelty, claiming to have transformed the delicate Queen of Ev and her children into decorative objects dispersed throughout his palace. Ozma proposed a deal to free them, offering ten ornaments for each one released. The Nome King, initially amused, then led Ozma to a balcony overlooking a vast underground world filled with Nomes in gleaming armor. He agreed to Ozma's plan, allowing her to enter the palace alone to find and restore the royal family. She could touch eleven objects, saying ""Ev,"" to release them.

"""We must not fail!"" exclaimed Ozma bravely. ""We've journeyed far to free these people; it would be cowardly to abandon now. I'll accept the Nome King's offer and enter the royal palace."" Inside, she discovered a magnificent hall, more grand than anything she had ever seen. The ceilings soared high above, adorned with arches, while walls and floors gleamed with tinted marble. Luxurious velvet carpets and silken draperies adorned the rooms. The furniture was exquisite, made of rare woods and delicate satins. The palace was bathed in a rosy glow, creating a magical atmosphere. Ozma explored the rooms, filled with ornate decorations and precious objects.

The King, in high spirits, mentioned that the failure of their leader, now an ornament, didn't mean the end. The adventurers, disheartened, feared they'd share the same fate. The Tin Woodman's ornamentation brought laughter to the King. The next victim, a colonel, tried his luck. Refreshments were served, and Dorothy enjoyed cakes and coffee. She was now with the Scarecrow, Tiktok, and a private. The Cowardly Lion and Hungry Tiger slept after eating cakes. Billina found a spot under the throne to sleep. The private, slow in guessing, became an ornament. The Nome King, eager for more ornaments, decided to finish the job the next day. The King, noting it was late, announced bedtime.

The King remained silent as the Chief Steward guided Dorothy into a long hall with plain but cozy sleeping rooms. Dorothy got the first room, the Scarecrow and Tiktok the next, the Lion and Tiger the third, and the Sawhorse the fourth, standing stiffly until morning. The nights were dull for the Scarecrow, Tiktok, and Sawhorse, but they learned to be patient and quiet. Dorothy felt sad about the Tin Woodman becoming an ornament. The Steward explained his strategy of turning the Queen of Ev and her children into ornaments. The King, wanting to mix green ornaments from the Emerald City with the purple ones, faced the Steward's criticism.

The monarch, relieved to be rid of the talking bird, sat back on his throne, wiping his brow. Billina, the yellow hen, felt important as she alone knew the Nome King's secret. She could distinguish between objects that were transformed and those that were not. Billina explored the underground palace, counting purple ornaments and spotting green ones. She then enchanted the palace's inhabitants, turning them back to their original forms. The Queen was overjoyed to see her children and was grateful to Billina for saving them.

For some time, they searched in vain for anything green. The Queen, now able to focus, met with the hen. Ozma of Oz, graceful as ever, greeted the Queen of Ev. Billina, the hen, promised to find their missing friends: the Scarecrow, solid gold, Tiktok, also gold, and the Tin Woodman, transformed into an unknown object by the Nome King. Despite their efforts, they couldn't locate the Tin Woodman's new form. Ozma, determined, led the group out. As they left, they faced the Nome King's army, motionless and armed. The King's rage grew as Billina continued to undo his spells. Dorothy, amused by the King's antics, laughed joyfully. The King, desperate, summoned his warriors. However, the Lion and Tiger's fierce presence deterred them. Dorothy, holding Prince Evring's hand, stood her ground, flanked by the Lion and Tiger.

The Sawhorse, despite its magical appearance, charged at the King so swiftly that the King couldn't dodge. Bam! The wooden hooves struck the King, sending him flying into his captain. At that moment, the palace doors burst open, revealing the people of Ev and Oz. The King, angered by the turn of events, declared them his prisoners. However, the generals expressed concerns about their health and suggested using a private soldier to fight. The private soldier, inspired by the Scarecrow, knocked down the Nome warriors. Seeing this, the Nome King was struck by an egg thrown by the Scarecrow, causing chaos as the warriors fled. Dorothy seized the King's belt, and the Nome King, defeated, vowed to return them to Ev.

Dorothy and her companions were determined to find their friend, the Tin Woodman, who had been transformed by the Nome King. As they searched the palace, they encountered challenges and the King's attempts to stop them. But Dorothy, with her quick thinking and the help of her magic belt, outsmarted the Nome King's warriors and ensured their safe escape.
