There are two main reasons why Conrad is not suitable for a particular job, and secondly, the speaker prefers not to have him around as much as required. A position outside the house has been arranged for him. The only question left is about the expected wages. It's worth noting that there was never such a close relationship between them, but Mrs. Hill and her son wanted to create that impression to possibly increase their claim on their wealthy relative. Ben was sent by Mrs. Hamilton on errands to various parts of the city. One time, he was sent to a tailor with a note, resulting in a fine suit that caught Conrad's eye. Ben kept the source of the suit's payment, Mrs. Hamilton, a secret from Conrad to avoid any jealousy. Conrad, suspecting the source of the suit, was irritated that someone else was favored by their rich relative.|"[""1.

Ben followed his guide up the stairs, and a door swung open at the first landing. He mechanically trailed the servant into the room but stopped short in surprise and confusion. Despite his inexperience, a quick glance revealed he was in a gambling house. The opulent double room boasted a plush carpet, hanging chandeliers, numerous mirrors reflecting bright lights, and a flashy bar at one end. Men of all ages were gathered around tables, their eyes fixed on the games of chance. Moments later, Ben found himself back on the street, puzzled by the evening's events. He wondered who had invited him there and why James Barnes had not shown up. Little did he know, a scheme was afoot, orchestrated by Conrad to deceive Mrs. Hamilton into believing Ben frequented gambling houses.|"['1.

"""I won't explain myself,"" Mrs. Hamilton said, smiling, ""but I plan to treat you coolly for a bit, as if you've upset me. Don't take it personally, consider it an act."" The plan unfolded. To Mrs. Hill and Conrad's delight, Mrs. Hamilton barely spoke to Ben at dinner. When she did, it was abrupt and cold, unusual for her warm nature. Ben looked sad, focused on his food, and barely engaged in conversation. Mrs. Hill and Conrad, however, were cheerful. They chatted happily, occasionally including Ben. They felt generous, thinking he had lost their cousin's favor. While they anticipated revenge on Ben, Conrad still faced financial troubles. His weekly allowance ran out quickly, and Ben refused to lend money. Mrs. Hamilton owned a fancy opera glass she bought in Paris for fifty dollars. It caught Conrad's eye, thinking he could pawn it for cash. Mrs. Hamilton noticed the missing glass and valued it sentimentally. She sought a detective's help, suspecting it could be pawned. She shared details with Mr. Lynx, hoping to recover the stolen item."|"[""1.

Mrs. Hill craftily shared a false account of Ben leaving a gambling house to prejudice the detective against him. She hoped this would lead to Ben's removal from the house without implicating herself. Meanwhile, Susan, the chambermaid, witnessed Conrad planting a pawnbroker's ticket in Ben's room, believing it incriminated him. The detective, Mr. Lynx, discovered the ticket and was saddened by Ben's alleged actions. Mrs. Hill and Conrad, who harbored animosity toward Ben, observed Mrs. Hamilton's cold demeanor towards him during a meal. Despite the mounting suspicion, Ben remained composed.|"[""1.

Conrad suggested taking Ben to Simpson's or the detective, but he realized it might not be a good idea as the attendant could confirm Ben didn't pawn the glass. To keep the matter private, Conrad planned to let Mrs. Hill and Conrad believe Ben was let go. Ben was taken by Mrs. Hamilton to her farm in Pennsylvania to investigate why her tenant, Jackson, wanted to buy it for more than its worth. Ben, using a railway guide, met a man on the train who shared how the town transformed due to oil discovery. Mrs. Hamilton's agent revealed that Jackson hid the oil discovery to buy the farm cheap. Jackson offered more money, valuing the farm for sentimental reasons. Ben stayed at a country hotel in Centerville, listening to conversations about the oil discoveries.|"[""1.

Ben and Mr. Taylor exchanged glances once more. The old farmer's intentions were clear, driven by a desire to secure the farm for a substantial profit. The following day, after a hearty breakfast, Ben and his new companion strolled to Peter Jackson's farm, located just a short distance away. The farmhouse appeared worn, lacking maintenance, with aged outbuildings matching its weary appearance. A tall, thin man, Peter Jackson, was spotted mending a fence nearby. Dressed in typical farmer attire, he seemed shrewd and greedy, his eyes sharp and his demeanor standoffish. Ben and Mr. Taylor approached him, but Jackson, sensing their purpose, remained reserved. Jackson, hoping for a positive response from Mrs. Hamilton regarding the farm sale, received only a disappointing circular in the mail. His plans to deceive Mrs. Hamilton were thwarted, leaving him visibly distraught. Mr. Taylor, seeing through Jackson's deceit, decided to end the conversation, opting to deal directly with the true owner or her representative.|"[""1.

Conrad, now Mrs. Hamilton's private secretary, felt a mix of elation and disappointment. Despite his promotion, his weekly salary of five dollars left him dissatisfied. He confided in his mother about his discontent. Meanwhile, Ben, who had orchestrated a lucrative sale for Mrs. Hamilton, pondered seeking her help but hesitated due to a lack of acquaintance. He was relieved to learn that his family could keep their cottage, saved from a deceitful scheme by Squire Davenport. Ben, reflecting on his past, shared how a newfound inheritance had led him to reform his ways, now striving for respectability.

Conrad decided to use $50 collected for Mrs. Hamilton's rent to invest in the stock market through a broker. The broker bought fifty shares on a one percent margin as a favor since Conrad had helped him before. Conrad bought the shares at $44 and sold them at $45 1-4, making a profit of $50 after deducting the commission. However, Mrs. Hamilton grew suspicious when Conrad postponed paying the rent and received a letter addressed to him from the brokers. Mrs. Hamilton planned to investigate the situation further. The brokers requested Conrad to pay the commission for buying and selling the shares as the stock price had fallen, depleting the margin money.
