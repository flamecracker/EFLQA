They continued walking until the prince heard what he thought was the sound of a saw-mill, but his guide said it was the grandmother snoring.

Stan returned home exhausted but hopeful, only to find his house overrun with children. Every corner was filled with children of all sizes, each more noisy and daring than the next.

Once upon a time in Japan, two frogs, one from Osaka and the other from Kioto, set out to explore their country. They met on a mountain between their cities and decided to rest before parting ways. As they stretched to see their destinations, they realized they were facing the wrong direction. Laughing at their mistake, they bid farewell and returned home, believing their cities were identical. In another tale, a beggar finds a silver coin and dreams of a good meal. He later acquires a gazelle from a trader. The gazelle, grateful but hungry, asks for permission to find his own food. The beggar agrees, and the gazelle returns every evening after foraging.|"['1.

When six of his heads were gone, the snake thrashed his tail fiercely, raising a cloud of dust that obscured the gazelle and the old woman.

Once upon a time, there was a mighty emperor who ruled over a vast empire. People noticed that the emperor's right eye laughed while his left eye wept, a mystery known only to him. The emperor had three sons, and the youngest, Petru, was carefree and always laughing and singing. The emperor revealed to Petru the reason for his eyes' behavior. He explained that his right eye laughed because of his strong and handsome sons, but his left eye wept out of fear that they wouldn't be able to protect the empire after his passing. To ensure eternal laughter in his eyes, the emperor tasked his sons with bringing water from the Fairy of the Dawn's spring. The eldest son, Florea, embarked on the quest, facing challenges like a dragon with three heads.

The magical journey of Petru and the Welwa led them through the kingdom of Mittwoch, where the air turned icy and fires tempted them to warm up. Despite the freezing cold, Petru remained steadfast, resisting the allure of the fires and the icy chill.

Petru endured the blistering heat, ignoring the lush valleys and enchanting maidens that tried to distract him. Eventually, they reached the hut of the Goddess of Thunder, who advised Petru to beware of the temptations of Venus' kingdom.

Once upon a time, a king sought a worthy suitor for his daughter through a challenging task. Many wealthy suitors tried to win her hand by bringing the finest pearls and completing difficult tasks, but all failed. In a far-off fishing village, a poor fisherman's three sons, Peter, Paul, and Jesper, found pearls in oysters. The brothers decided to present themselves as suitors. Peter and Paul failed when their pearls turned to cinders before the king. It was then Jesper's turn. Jesper cleverly allied with the ants and defeated the beetles, impressing the king.

Jesper kept a serious expression, accepted the old woman's offer, and continued walking. Suddenly, he encountered her again. She admired the pearls Jesper carried but warned they wouldn't suffice to win the princess without completing tasks. She requested his lunch in exchange for a whistle that could summon lost items. Jesper presented the pearls to the king, impressing everyone but revealing he was a fisherman, disappointing the king. The next day, the king tasked Jesper with sorting grains by type before sunset. Overwhelmed, Jesper called on the King of the Ants for help, and the ants swiftly sorted the grains. The following day, Jesper faced herding a hundred hares, each fleeing in different directions.
