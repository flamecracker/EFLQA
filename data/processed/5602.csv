Rand and his friends were discussing an organization for boys aged twelve to eighteen that focuses on self-reliance and good citizenship.

"Pepper eagerly began unpacking pots and pans for breakfast, but Donald, the more practical of the group, stopped him, reminding Pepper that he would have to wash all the dishes if he used them all. Just then, Jack, a brown-haired, brown-eyed boy, burst into the room. Jack grabbed some biscuits and settled in to chat.

They included Rand, a natural leader from Virginia; Donald, with Scottish roots and a cautious nature; Jack, the son of a newspaper editor, always on the lookout for news; and Pepper, Jack's impetuous and imaginative younger brother.

Jack pondered about Monkey Rae's involvement, jingling coins in his hand. Rand cautioned Jack not to scare the fish away as Jack accidentally went overboard while handling the anchor. Jack caught a perch, attributing it to luck, and prepared to share a story. He explained the concept of a Boy Scout patrol to Rand. The Dart, a white yacht, approached swiftly with a loud whistle. Rand admired a skilled canoeist and suspected they might need help. Suddenly, a girl on the canoe fell overboard after a wave from the passing Dart caused a commotion. Donald urged the boys to row fast as the group in the water struggled.|"[""1.

Rand, standing at the bow of the boat, searched for the missing girl. Suddenly, a pale face surfaced ahead. Rand dived in and rescued her with Donald's help. Together, they brought her aboard. Meanwhile, another girl from the overturned canoe was also rescued. Pepper checked the rescued girl's pulse and advised clearing water from her lungs. They hurried back to shore.

Frank explained that Nellie had tried to wave to them from the deck, causing them all to end up in the water. Suddenly, a boy stole their pan and ran into the woods. Despite searching, they couldn't find him. Pepper was upset about the overturned stove, but the colonel suggested cooking the fish in clay. They gathered leaves, twigs, and clay to make a fire.

The boys carefully followed the track, with Rand being quick and Donald persistent. As they reached a shack in the woods, they found it small but cozy, adorned with animal skins and weapons. The colonel shared a story about a scout's camaraderie, emphasizing unity regardless of social class. Soon, they boarded the Scout, chasing a boat on the river. With skilled maneuvering, they tried to catch the elusive boat, but the occupants escaped into the woods. The colonel praised their efforts, steering the Scout back home to Creston.

Judge Taylor's office was in an old two-story brick building on a street corner. The building had windows on all sides, but a new building next to it made some windows useless. Jack and the officer found a handprint on a clean window sill, hinting at a break-in. The officer found steel tools between the buildings, likely used in the burglary. The judge was puzzled by how the burglars got in and out without leaving clues. The officer suspected multiple people were involved.

"The judge suggested, ""See if you can find anything else."" A search in the office for more clues failed. The boys decided to explore outside.

Later in 1777, Congress decided on the design of the flag with thirteen alternating red and white stripes and thirteen white stars on a blue field. Meanwhile, a group of Scouts was practicing archery under the guidance of Colonel Snow. The boys, dressed in Scout uniforms, were learning to use their English bows and arrows.

Pepper started his journey confidently but soon found himself lost in the thick underbrush. Feeling disoriented and realizing he had strayed about four miles off course, he sat down to have lunch. As he pondered his situation, he came across a cabin and a boy perched on its roof.

"Pepper pondered, ""Can I reach that tree?"" He decided, ""I must do it, might be better there."" Carefully, he slid down to a ledge, grasping a tree for support. Moving cautiously, he reached another ledge below. Slippery but determined, he descended to a small plateau. Relieved, he exclaimed, ""Made it to the bottom!"" Suddenly, a friend called out, ""We've been searching for you!"" They shared rations and Pepper recounted his journey. Despite Pepper's reassurance, his friends escorted him to Creston. Exhausted yet relieved, Pepper rushed home. Near his house, he learned his brother and friends were at Judge Taylor's office. The judge, perplexed by the disappearance, planned a new search. As Pepper arrived, the judge considered the boys' tracks and their recent spending. Though unsure, the judge kept the tracks, suspecting an escape by boat.

The judge concluded that someone around the area must have taken the missing items. He urged Jack to use his wits to solve the mystery. The judge advised the boys to head home after their eventful day and to watch over Pepper. The Uncas crew prepared for a race against the heavier and stronger Alton crew the next day. Monkey stirred trouble by suggesting a surprise party involving the boys' missing boat. Gerald doubted Monkey's abilities, and the group planned to catch Monkey and Sam at the boathouse.
