"""I have an idea,"" exclaimed the hump-tail alligator. ""Since you won't let me take him home alone, and I won't let you either, let's carry him together.

"""New places can be exciting,"" the bunny uncle remarked. ""But old spots have their charm too, if you know where to find it. Let's go explore and have some fun in the lovely woods,"" he suggested.

Uncle Wiggily and his friends were in the woods, trying to find a solution for Squeaky-Eeky's desire to sled without snow. Uncle Wiggily discovered a fallen tree that was perfect for sledding because its bark was slippery. With Jillie's help, Squeaky-Eeky slid down the tree on her sled, having a thrilling ride. Meanwhile, Nurse Jane called for Uncle Wiggily at their home, concerned if he had encountered any trouble. She wondered if the skillery-scalery alligator had caused any mischief.|"['1.

Uncle Wiggily, feeling lazy and wretched, was urged by Nurse Jane to dig fresh sassafras root to cure his Spring fever. Reluctant, he set out with his rheumatism crutch, only to encounter the cunning fox. The fox, long waiting for Uncle Wiggily, demanded the sassafras root. Uncle Wiggily, taken aback, obliged. As the fox yanked the root, he fell over in a somersault. The fox, with a grin, planned to take Uncle Wiggily to his den to meet his numbered little foxes.

"""Oh, my goodness!"" exclaimed the fox, wincing as he hit his nose. ""What's going on?"" But Uncle Wiggily didn't stick around to explain. He dashed through the forest, leaving his Spring fever behind. He was completely over it. 

""How are you feeling today, Uncle Wiggily?"" inquired Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, spotting the rabbit gentleman grabbing his tall silk hat from the china closet, preparing for a stroll in the woods one morning.

""I'm feeling quite well, Nurse Jane,"" replied the bunny uncle. ""After I hurried home to escape the fox, who did a somersault after tugging too hard to reach the sassafras root, I feel much better, thank you.""

""It was,"" the reply came. ""I'm a Jack-in-the-Pulpit plant, you see, and I began to sprout, like all plants and flowers do in summer.

Uncle Wiggily, the kind rabbit, met some blue violets in the woods. The violets were sad and didn't feel useful. Uncle Wiggily encouraged them, saying they were pretty and fragrant, unlike some things. The violets felt better and traveled with Uncle Wiggily. A fox tried to harm Uncle Wiggily but was touched by the violets' beauty and changed its mind. The violets even helped color water for washing clothes.

Uncle Wiggily and Grandpa Goosey faced a dilemma with a hat stuck in a high tree. They pondered three solutions: asking the wind to blow it down, climbing the tree themselves, or requesting the tree to shake it loose. The wind was out at sea, the tree couldn't shake without the wind, and climbing was out of the question. Uncle Wiggily then sought the help of Toodle Flat-tail, a beaver known for cutting trees. Toodle obliged, and with the wind's assistance, the hat was retrieved safely. Later, Nurse Jane requested peppermint juice for her indigestion, but the drug store was closed. Uncle Wiggily's adventure ended with a closed store sign due to the store owner being at a baseball-movie show.|"['1.

The cow lady pointed to some green plants near a babbling brook. The plants had square, dark red stems. Uncle Wiggily and the cow lady squeezed juice from peppermint plants between flat stones. The strong scent made Uncle Wiggily's eyes water. He thought it could cure indigestion. As he headed to the hollow stump bungalow, a big black bear appeared. Uncle Wiggily handed the bear the bottle of peppermint juice. The bear's throat burned, and he ran off to find water. This shows that peppermint can scare bears and is good for candy.

"""It's time to head home,"" Uncle Wiggily announced. He locked up the school and left the key under the doormat for the lady mouse. With the Bushytail squirrel boys, they ventured through the woods. The path over the duck pond ocean seemed like a shortcut to Uncle Wiggily's bungalow, but to their dismay, the bridge was gone. The approaching fox added urgency to their dilemma. Just in time, a white birch tree offered a solution. They crafted a makeshift canoe from the bark and sailed to safety, evading the fox.

They also found red and yellow flowers, along with unusual Jacks-in-their-pulpits. The little bunny girl was delighted and eager to visit Uncle Wiggily's hollow stump bungalow for a meal. Suddenly, a mischievous monkey appeared, insisting on pulling tails. Despite rabbits not having good tails for pulling, the monkey was determined to pull something. He attempted to grab Uncle Wiggily's ears, but the clever bunny uncle surprised him by revealing a bunch of white snowdrops. The monkey, unfamiliar with snow, shivered and shook, realizing the cold. Uncle Wiggily cleverly outwitted the monkey, teaching him a lesson about the cold snowdrops.|"['1.

Uncle Wiggily encountered a bad bear in the woods on his way home. The bear wanted to hug him, but Uncle Wiggily knew it wasn't a friendly hug. Bears give hard, rib-cracking squeezes, not loving hugs. Uncle Wiggily tried to make the bear laugh by twinkling his nose, as he knew that if he could get the bear to laugh, he wouldn't be harmed. But this bear wasn't amused. Instead, he growled and repeated his demand. Uncle Wiggily was relieved when the bear finally left, and he continued his journey through the woods. The mother tree explained to Uncle Wiggily that unlike animals, trees couldn't move to find water when they were thirsty. They had to stay rooted in one place and wait for rain or someone to water them.|['1.

Once upon a time, Uncle Wiggily Longears, a kind rabbit, was out for a walk in the woods when he met two squirrel boys, Billie and Johnnie. The boys were looking for fun since many animal children were sick with measles. As they strolled, they found a mud turtle stuck on his back. Uncle Wiggily helped the turtle back on his feet. Grateful, the turtle gave Uncle Wiggily some green rushes. Later, Uncle Wiggily met Mother Goose, who needed a scrubbing brush to clean her kitchen. Remembering the green rushes, Uncle Wiggily offered them as a substitute. The rushes, though common, were smooth when rubbed up and down and rough when rubbed sideways, perfect for cleaning. Mother Goose was delighted and used the rushes to scrub her kitchen floor.|['1.

Uncle Wiggily guided the way to the bee tree in the woods, with the bear by his side. Soon, a loud buzz filled the air as hundreds of bees emerged from the hollow tree, stinging the bear all over. The bear cried out in pain, but Uncle Wiggily remained unharmed as the bees liked him. Grateful for the bees' protection, Uncle Wiggily continued on his adventure. He then made his way to the home of Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, delivering Mrs. Bow Wow's thimble. As he searched for the puppy dogs, he encountered foxes chasing them. A dogwood tree with white blossoms and red centers came to life, scaring off the foxes and ensuring the safety of the puppies. Jackie and Peetie thanked the tree, and it promised to protect them from any future dangers.|"[""1.

Uncle Wiggily, the kind rabbit gentleman, saved himself from a bear by using his umbrella to shield himself from sharp beech nuts. He then visited Mrs. Bow Wow, whose puppies had been sick with measles. One of the puppies, Jackie, needed to take bitter medicine to get well. Despite Mrs. Bow Wow's efforts, Jackie refused to take the medicine. Uncle Wiggily came up with a clever idea to help Jackie. He asked Jackie to pretend to take the medicine by holding it near his lips without actually swallowing it. This way, Jackie could trick his body into thinking he had taken the medicine.

Uncle Wiggily, the friendly rabbit, wanted to draw a picture of Jackie pretending to take bitter medicine. The bunny encouraged Jackie to act as if he were taking the medicine bravely. While drawing, Uncle Wiggily instructed Jackie to hold the cup closer to his lips but not to swallow the medicine. However, Jackie accidentally swallowed it when he tipped the cup too high. Surprisingly, this meant Dr. Possum didn't need to intervene, and Jackie soon recovered. Next, Uncle Wiggily found himself stuck to a pine tree due to its sticky gum.
