We provide the funds for the kennels, where dogs are bred and trained for the army at no cost. For the past eight years, I have enjoyed visiting the kennels, where up to fifty dogs undergo constant training. During my last visit, I met Hero, who had suffered a leg injury during training. Despite doubts about his ability to serve again, I took him in. With successful treatment, Hero's leg has fully recovered. Although I feel the urge to return him to service, given his intelligence and training, it's hard to part with such a loyal companion. As an elderly man, Hero understands our bond. The Major then instructs Hero to fetch his shoulder-bags, used for aiding wounded soldiers, showcasing the dog's training in locating and assisting injured personnel.

Three years later, I learned from the news about the devastating floods in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, leaving thousands homeless. Bertie, who was just six at the time, heard about the children suffering without shelter or food. Without a word, he took down his red savings bank from the mantel. Although we were still living in a cabin, we were slowly getting back on our feet. Bertie emptied his bank of ninety-three cents, added his tin soldiers, his grandmother's knitted mittens, and even his best Sunday clothes to the table. He was repaying the debt of gratitude he felt towards the Red Cross for their help during the floods. The Red Cross also played a crucial role in providing aid during other disasters like the Galveston flood and the Johnstown flood. The society collects donations to help those in need, ensuring that contributions reach those affected by disasters promptly.|['1.
