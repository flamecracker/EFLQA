"Miss Heath expressed regret for bringing up a topic that might not be relevant to Maggie. She explained that the subject directly related to marriage. Miss Heath had refrained from discussing it earlier, thinking it was a result of delirium when Annabel mentioned it. Annabel, before passing away, wanted Maggie to know that she was happy about her upcoming marriage. Later that evening, the girls of St. Benet's were set to perform ""The Princess,"" a play by Tennyson. Despite some initial setbacks, the girls were well-prepared for the performance. The scene was picturesque, with the audience eagerly anticipating the play. As the curtain rose, the girls beautifully portrayed the garden scene from the play, capturing the essence of the poem.
