Rollo and his uncle George traveled from Naples to Rome on a diligence, a type of stagecoach. In Italy, diligences are public coaches that transport passengers for hire. Unlike the large diligences in France with multiple compartments, the Italian diligence they took had only three sections: the interior, the coupé with a glass front, and the banquette above. Due to the unhealthy Pontine Marshes they would pass through at night, they opted for seats inside. Traveling by diligence in Europe requires booking seats in advance, with specific rules and regulations outlined on printed receipts. Rollo secured seats 1 and 2 in the coupé and studied the regulations in Italian. The day before their journey, Rollo dropped off their luggage at the diligence station with a boy named Cyrus. The station was a grand courtyard with offices and diligences lined up under a colonnade.|['1.

While traveling through the picturesque countryside of Naples on their way to Capua, the bridal party was consumed by internal discomfort and unhappiness, overshadowing the beauty around them. This phenomenon is common among European tourists, where despite favorable circumstances and long-awaited visits to dreamt-of locations, internal conflicts often plague their peace. Such disquietude arises from selfishness and lack of consideration for others, magnified during extended journeys. In contrast, Mr. George and Rollo remained carefree and content, exploring the courtyard before boarding their diligence. Observing the postilions driving the horses in their ornate red-trimmed livery was a fascinating aspect of European travel, where each postilion rode and drove a pair of horses.

A grand diligence, pulled by six horses, and with brightly dressed postilions on each pair, arrives in town at a gallop. The postilions crack their whips, drawing the attention of all the children in the streets. Rollo enjoys the speed and clear windows without a driver's seat blocking the view. After a half-hour delay at the city gate for passport checks, the postilions joke around before setting off at a fast pace. The road leads through a beautiful avenue filled with peasants in unique costumes heading to market day in Naples. The countryside is lush with mulberry groves, vineyards, and orange tree gardens. Mr. George explains the importance of silk worms and the search for new varieties by the Society of Acclimatation. The journey continues with a stop at an inn in a village for fresh horses and postilions seeking a small tip before departing.|"['1.

"In Italy, it is customary to give a present known as ""buono mano"" in addition to payment for services rendered. Rollo, along with Mr. George, received coffee from a waiter at a hotel during their journey. The waiter brought the coffee on a tray, allowing them to enjoy it quickly before their diligence continued its journey. As they traveled through picturesque landscapes, the road eventually led to the town of Mola di Gaeta near the sea. Upon arrival, they were ushered into a historic hall where a table was set for dinner. The table was adorned with fruits, nuts, cakes, and flowers, creating a welcoming atmosphere for the twenty passengers from the diligence. The meal consisted of soup and boiled beef, served with utensils for the guests to help themselves. Overall, Rollo had a delightful ride and enjoyed a pleasant dining experience at the hotel."|"['1.

After the passengers finished their elaborate dinner, the plates were changed for each course, starting with fried potatoes, then mutton chops, green peas, roast beef, cauliflower with drawn butter, roast chicken with salad, and finally puddings. Fresh plates were provided for each dish. Every two guests shared a decanter of wine, although it tasted more like sour cider. The passengers paid for their meal and tipped the waiter. Later, they boarded a new coach at the frontier, as the Neapolitan coach and its crew were left behind, and the Roman coach took them towards Rome. The transition took time due to passport checks, baggage transfers, and formalities. Passengers exchanged money and awaited the coaches under torchlight. The luggage was shifted between coaches without being unloaded. Eventually, the passengers settled in their new coach for the journey to Rome, commencing their night ride around nine o'clock.|"['1.

The Pontine Marshes, known for centuries, are vast lowlands drained by canals allowing grass to grow for sheep and cattle. Uninhabitable due to being low and unhealthy, the marshes are traversed by a straight road bordered by ancient trees, creating a beautiful avenue. A canal runs alongside the road, with boats passing by. The landscape is a vast expanse of green meadows divided by hedges and groves. Flocks of animals and herdsmen on horseback can be seen. Traveling through the marshes at night, the view is limited to the trees illuminated by lantern light. A stop for a quick supper of chicken, rolls, and oranges is enjoyed, with the travelers taking their time to savor the meal and pass the time. At half past three, Rollo notices a bend in the road ahead.|['1.

Mr. George and Rollo settled in for sleep on their journey to Rome. They dozed off, waking briefly as the diligence changed horses. When they awoke, the sun shone brightly as they neared Rome. The landscape was dotted with ancient ruins like tombs and aqueducts. They traveled on the famous Appian Way, the same road the apostle Paul once journeyed on. The road's ancient stone pavement, still visible today, was smooth and sturdy. Passing through the city gate, soldiers patrolled the area. The conductor collected their passports, a common practice in European capitals. Inside Rome, they navigated narrow streets, glimpsing ancient ruins amidst modern buildings. Rollo observed masked penitents and a grand carriage before arriving at a customs office to have their luggage inspected.|['1.

"Mr. George opened his trunk and a customs officer approached. The officer tapped the clothes in the trunk, hinting not to reveal what was underneath. He then marked the trunk as ""Passed"" without inspecting further. The officer subtly asked for a gift in exchange for not checking the luggage thoroughly, a common practice among travelers. Some pay the fee willingly to avoid scrutiny, while others refuse, seeing it as a bribe. Mr. George instructed Rollo to find a carriage to take them to the hotel. Rollo, unable to speak Italian, gestured to the coachman where to go. They ended up at the Hotel d'Amerique, which was full. Mr. George directed the coachman to try other hotels until they found one with availability. They first headed to the Piazza del Popolo, a famous square in Rome with three streets leading from it."|"['1.

The Piazza del Popolo is a popular spot for public events and parades. It features a grand hill with gardens on top, adorned with statues, fountains, and marble seats for weary travelers. Every year, during Holy Week, a spectacular fireworks display lights up the sky from the hill and terrace above, drawing crowds to the Piazza below. Mr. George and Rollo arrived at a hotel facing the square but found only a large four-room suite available. Rollo ingeniously suggested making a cozy bed on the floor using coats and cloaks. Later, they secured a smaller room in a quieter area with unique marble and column models for sale. Rollo, intrigued by the sculptures, headed to the dining room to plan breakfast.|['1.

Cameos are intricate pieces of art created from stones or shells with different colors on each side. Artists carefully carve away the unwanted parts to reveal a design, such as a man's figure, in contrasting colors. In Rome, skilled artisans craft stunning cameos used in jewelry like pins and bracelets. On the other hand, mosaics are made by fitting together small colored stones or glass pieces into a pattern on a surface. Rollo and Charlie observed a mosaic artist at work, breaking colorful glass bars into tiny pieces and placing them vertically into a soft material. Once the design is complete, the surface is smoothed and polished to resemble a painted picture. Despite using separate pieces, the colors blend seamlessly, creating a beautiful and harmonious final piece.|['1.

In Rome, ancient churches display large, stunning mosaics that mimic famous paintings. Visitors often mistake them for paintings until they see the intricate stone details up close or through a magnifying glass. Surprisingly, the oldest church artworks in Rome and Italy are mosaics, not paintings. Mosaics seem to have inspired paintings, with the practice of arranging colored stones evolving into decorative designs on floors and walls before portraying figures. Rollo and Charles were lured into a mosaic shop by a friendly worker. Fascinated, they explored the shop and were gifted cards. As they strolled along the vibrant Corso street, they encountered an elegant carriage, learning about the government officials who rode in such grand vehicles. Despite getting lost, the boys decided to enjoy their walk and explore more of the lively town.|['1.

As the boys continued their walk, they reached a vast square with a towering column at its center. Rollo recognized it from a model he had seen at the hotel, noting its spiral sculptures worn by time. Approaching a gentleman with a guidebook, Rollo inquired if it was Trajan's Column. The Englishman, using an opera glass, examined the carvings. Rollo marveled at its age, almost two millennia old. These columns celebrated victorious generals with spiraling sculptures depicting their conquests. Nearby, a sunken area with ancient columns caught their attention. Rollo suggested finding the Corso street to locate the mosaic shop. Spotting a carriage, they directed the driver to the Corso, enjoying the unfamiliar sights of Rome as they rode through the city.|"[""1.

Rollo and Charles ventured into a maze of dark, twisted alleys, relying on Rollo's guidance to navigate the labyrinth. They passed ancient ruins, some with solitary columns or massive broken arches strewn about. In other spots, remnants of old temples were integrated into the modern cityscape, a blend of past grandeur and current decay. Standing in the carriage, the boys scoured the surroundings, eager to spot familiar landmarks. Rollo directed the coachman with gestures, leading them through the bustling streets of Rome. Despite the search for their hotel, the boys embraced the adventure, absorbing the sights and sounds of the historic city.|"[""1.

Rollo and Charles decided to turn back instead of crossing the bridge. They were searching for a shop that made Roman scarfs for Rollo's cousin Lucy. These scarfs were colorful and made of silk, perfect for ladies. Rollo wanted a small green scarf, but had trouble communicating with the shopman. Eventually, they found a shop with girls weaving scarfs on silk looms. Rollo then made a note of the shop's name and address. They got back into the carriage and Rollo directed the coachman to the Hotel d'Amerique. When they arrived, Rollo asked a waiter to help them find their hotel by driving to different hotels until they recognized the right one.|"['1.

"Mr. George advised, ""Always seek a commissioner when in trouble in a European town."" The Coliseum was constructed for games and shows, with an oval shape, rising seats, and a central arena without a roof due to its immense size. Spectacles there included combats between captives and wild beasts like lions and bears, brought from distant lands by Roman generals for the people's entertainment. Mr. George and Rollo arrived at the Coliseum by carriage, passing through ruins and ancient structures. They explored the arena, now stripped of its marble finish, feeling awe at the grandeur of the place. Sitting on a stone step, they admired the cross in the center and the chapels around it, all part of the historical site's Catholic symbolism."|['1.

The Coliseum arena was neatly kept, with no beggars in sight. Instead, well-dressed visitors strolled the paths or sat on stone fragments under the arches. Above, the tiered seating platforms towered high, covered in grass and shrubs. Rollo, using an opera glass, counted over twenty different plants on the ruins. Mr. George explained the history of the Coliseum, including how it was used for fights and how Christians were sent to face wild beasts. The conversation turned to the structure's decline, from being pillaged for materials to failed plans of conversion. Mr. George noted the French interest in preserving historic sites. Comparing the Coliseum to the Great Eastern ship, they discussed the ship's potential as a future relic. Rollo marveled at the unique yellow bricks used in the construction.|"['1.

After searching around for a while, Rollo discovered a brick with the letters P. D. imprinted on it. It was clear that the letters were stamped while the brick was still soft. Rollo then checked other bricks with exposed sides, finding some with the letters and others without. Feeling frustrated, Rollo thought about how the popes had taken so much from the Coliseum to build their palaces, yet he couldn't take a small brick for his museum. As they wandered, they explored the arena's margins and the vaulted corridors within the walls. They eventually reached a wooden gate leading to stone steps. A man with a key appeared, speaking in Italian. Mr. George explained that the gate might be locked to prevent accidents. Rollo ventured up to the second-story corridors, observing the ruins of the seating area and the vast openings below. They continued exploring the upper levels, encountering different staircase ruins and meeting other visitors along the way.|"['1.

Mr. George stood in an elevated position inside the Coliseum, imagining the grandeur of the past when it was filled with spectators. Rollo refrained from asking Mr. George to add plant specimens to the Guide Book, knowing he disliked them there. The Coliseum, with its oval shape, towering walls, and intricate architecture, once hosted fierce spectacles. As they climbed staircases, Mr. George noted that gladiators, often prisoners or criminals, fought wild beasts for entertainment. These warriors, like the Dying Gladiator statue, symbolized triumph over pain.

After exploring the ancient ruins, Mr. George and Rollo collected specimens of marble and stamped bricks. Rollo carefully wrapped the bricks in newspaper for safekeeping. As they descended from the ruins, they passed broken columns and arches in the Roman Forum. They then ascended a steep paved road adorned with statues of lions and horses. At the top of the hill, they entered a square surrounded by grand palaces filled with art treasures. They visited a museum of sculptures and statues, where a sentinel allowed them entry.

Mr. George and Rollo strolled through rooms filled with ancient sculptures, marred by time and neglect. These artifacts were once considered worthless rubble until unearthed centuries ago. Mr. George conversed with a gentleman in French, learning the way to the hall housing the renowned Dying Gladiator statue. As they approached the statue, Mr. George explained the uncertainty surrounding its original purpose, pointing out the intense expression on the gladiator's face. After admiring the statue, they explored the room's other sculptures. Mr. George emphasized the statue's significance, noting its enduring presence in art and literature. Following breakfast, Mr. George left for the bookstore, leaving Rollo to meet Mrs. Beekman and her family, including the lively Almira.|"['1.

Mrs. Beekman initially dismissed the idea of visiting a small rock face, claiming it wasn't worth seeing compared to the Hudson River Railroad views. However, Rollo and Charles were keen on the adventure itself rather than the destination. Despite Mrs. Beekman's reluctance, she eventually agreed. They headed to the hotel's entrance where carriages awaited. Coachmen vied for their attention, but Rollo chose one and communicated in Italian to go to the Capitol. As they ascended steps towards the Tarpeian Rock, local children eagerly joined them, offering to guide.

Rollo gestured to the girl and took out a copper coin from his pocket. He signaled to the other children to leave but they continued clamoring. Ignoring them, Rollo walked with Charles and Allie. Soon, they reached a gateway with an iron ring that the children pulled to ring a bell inside. The children lined up, hoping for money. Rollo generously gave the girl three coins, causing the others to clamor more. Unfazed, Rollo led his group through the gate into a garden surrounded by buildings. The girl guided them along a path past vegetable beds and blooming flowers. They reached a spot by a wall overlooking a precipice where a historical event took place. Rollo recounted the story of Tarpeia, a girl who made a deal with soldiers to open the gates in exchange for what they wore on their arms, intending to receive bracelets but ended up crushed by their heavy shields.|['1.

One night, Rollo recounted a story about Tarpeia, who betrayed her people by letting enemy soldiers into the town. As the soldiers rushed in, they threw their shields at her, crushing her to death near the Tarpeian Rock. This rock was named after her, and people visit it to this day. After a walk through a garden, a girl in the group gathered flowers and presented a bouquet to Allie. Rollo gave her money as a thank you gesture.

The ancient Pantheon, originally built by the Romans two thousand years ago, now serves as a church. Its immense size, nearly a hundred and fifty feet in diameter and height, showcases the architectural grandeur of that time. Rollo and his companions explored the Pantheon, admiring the statues, paintings, and chapels while observing the pilgrims and visitors. After an hour, as the sun emerged following a passing shower, they headed back. During his time in Rome, Rollo met an English boy named Copley, who shared his plans of traveling slowly to Florence, then to Milan, Venice, and Switzerland. Copley expressed his excitement for the journey and his desire to have his own whip for the trip.|['1.

Rollo always sought his uncle's permission before going anywhere. Mr. George usually granted permission unless there was a good reason not to. Even if Rollo disagreed with his uncle's decision, he would always accept it without argument. Rollo believed that to travel with his uncle, he needed to make it enjoyable for him. This meant not causing any trouble and always following his uncle's wishes. Mr. Holiday explained to Rollo that while independence is good, it must be within the right boundaries. He emphasized that as a minor, Rollo needed to follow his father's guidance until he could support himself. This was to ensure that Rollo acted in a way that was best for him until he reached adulthood.|"[""1.

Mr. Holiday entrusted Rollo to his uncle George for a journey, emphasizing the importance of obeying him to maintain a pleasant trip. Rollo understood that following his uncle's lead was crucial to ensure a successful journey. Meanwhile, Copley's brother William and his wife planned an outing to ancient ruins but were left waiting as Copley went off with another boy. The boys explored the Corso and stumbled upon a shop selling whips. Copley, unable to communicate in French or Italian, relied on Rollo to purchase a whip. Later, they visited the diligence office but found no available transports. Eventually, they reached the river and discovered a steamboat heading to Ostia, sparking their interest in taking the voyage. Rollo was captivated by the idea of sailing down the river to explore Ostia's surroundings.|"[""1.

After spending some time on the bridge admiring the steamer, the boys headed back home. Rollo made sure to reach the hotel before the two hours were up. Finding Mr. George finishing a letter, Rollo shared the day's events. They strolled along the Corso until Copley bought a whip, then continued to the bridge where they spotted a steamboat bound for Ostia. Copley proposed a trip for the next day. Aware that their families might not approve, Copley decided to keep the plan secret and invited another friend instead.

Dear Father, We have been well during our stay in Rome and have enjoyed it. However, we are now preparing to leave for Florence and the north of Italy. I have decided to send Copley back with his uncle due to his reluctance to follow my guidance. It's not entirely his fault, but our close ages may be the reason he struggles to accept my authority. I worry about his safety, especially in a country with thieves and rogues. Copley takes liberties that concern me, like going on a river trip without informing me. Therefore, I have arranged for him to return with his uncle to England. Uncle readily agreed to take charge of Copley. Thomas will wait for Copley's return and then bring him to his uncle. I will be at the Hotel of the Post, Civita Castellana. Copley and his companion had a safe river trip but were disappointed by the barren scenery.|"[""1.

Thomas informed Mr. Copley that his brother had left for Italy and Switzerland, leaving behind a note advising Copley to return home with his uncle. Copley's uncle withheld his brother's exact whereabouts to prevent Copley from following. The next day, Copley received a letter from his brother suggesting that he return home due to their age difference. Copley was initially furious but felt powerless since both his brother and Thomas had left. Meanwhile, Rollo went to a reading room in Rome to find Mr. George. The reading room, part of Piale's establishment, served as a hub for English and American visitors, offering a library, news, and various services. Upon arrival, Rollo observed visitors checking the register for acquaintances and engaging with the bookstore's offerings.|"[""1.

Rollo's interest was piqued by the conversation he overheard. It was clear that a group of men was planning an outing, and Rollo was sure his uncle George would want to join. Rollo paid the entrance fee to the reading room and found himself in a spacious area with comfortable seating and tables filled with reading materials. The walls were adorned with paintings for sale. Rollo located his uncle George and led him to the group of men, introducing him. Rollo took the opportunity to explain the grandeur of the Vatican, a vast complex of buildings filled with priceless art and treasures. The Vatican's extensive collection includes ancient statues, paintings, manuscripts, and more, attracting visitors from around the world. The group discussed the possibility of a nighttime visit to the Vatican to view the statues illuminated by torchlight, a unique and costly experience that requires a group of twelve to fifteen to share the expense.|"[""1.

The group was thrilled when Mr. George, a young gentleman, agreed to join their outing. He even paid for three spots in advance. Mr. George was enthusiastic and offered to find more people to join. The party was set to meet at the foot of the grand staircase at eight o'clock. Despite young people like Charles and Allie usually having little interest in sculptures, they were excited about the torchlight and eager to go. Mr. George and Rollo planned to pick them up at seven o'clock. Mrs. Beekman was left out as she had other plans. At seven o'clock, they all headed to the carriage and set off towards the Vatican. Upon arrival, they walked around the grand colonnade and piazza, waiting for the rest of the group to arrive before entering the Vatican galleries.|"['1.

After climbing up and moving forward for a while, they finally reached the entrance of a long gallery filled with sculptures. Here, the torch bearers paused to get their torches ready. They cut the long candles in half to create pieces around eighteen inches long. Gathering six to eight of these pieces, they bundled them together like sticks, tied them up, and inserted the ends into the pole's socket. Lighting the wicks, they had several candles burning as one. The torch bearers led the way, and the group followed. Due to time constraints, only a few statues could be shown during the two-hour exhibition. The torch bearers selected the most important ones to display, quickly moving from one to the next. When approaching a statue, they would illuminate it to highlight the features. The company passed through the galleries, stopping at significant sculptures before exploring smaller chambers. Rollo was fascinated by the exhibition, while Allie seemed overwhelmed by the grandeur and beauty around her. After an hour, the first set of candles burned out, and the torch bearers replaced them with the remaining halves. After seeing the main statues, the group left the palace, where carriages awaited to take them home, all pleased with the experience. Rollo, pleased with the Vatican visit, planned a torch light visit to the Coliseum a few days later, which turned out to be equally impressive.|['1.

Rome is very unhealthy in summer, with the surrounding area almost uninhabitable due to fever. Steamers from Rome to Marseilles, the port for France and England, offer two routes: direct across the sea or coasting with stops. While Mr. George considered the coasting option, he chose the direct route to avoid passport hassles and delays. In these countries, strict passport control is used to maintain government authority and prevent uprisings. Despite the inconvenience, the system helps authorities control movement and catch criminals. Mr. George and Rollo learned that the steamer to Marseilles departs from Naples, with passengers from Rome needing to travel to Civita Vecchia to board. They hurried to secure spots on the diligence to Civita Vecchia to ensure they wouldn't miss the steamer.|"['1.

Mr. George entered the diligence office and found clerks behind a counter. They were busy talking to people who wanted to book places. Mr. George approached a clerk and requested two spots for Civita Vecchia on Wednesday. He asked whether they preferred morning or evening travel. Morning meant leaving early, staying overnight in a strange place, while evening travel meant riding alone in the dark. Mr. George then secured seats for both times. On Wednesday morning, Rollo woke early as the porter brought candles. He insisted on going alone to the office, declining Mr. George's offer to accompany him. Rollo felt confident in handling the journey himself. After a silent walk with the Italian-speaking porter, they reached the bustling diligence office. Rollo boarded the banquette, and the journey began with stops for passport checks as the sun rose, marking Rollo's departure from Rome.|"['1.
