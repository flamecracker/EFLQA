Master Meadow Mouse was a chubby little creature with short legs, a short tail, and short ears, making him appear even plumper than he truly was. Despite his rotund figure, he was well-liked by friendly animals like Paddy Muskrat and Billy Woodchuck for his good-natured ways. On the other hand, unfriendly creatures such as Peter Mink and Tommy Fox saw him as a tasty treat due to his size. Living in Pleasant Valley, Master Meadow Mouse had to be cautious of predators like Grumpy Weasel, Solomon Owl, Ferdinand Frog, Henry Hawk, and even Miss Kitty Cat. Despite the dangers, he found joy in swimming in Broad Brook and burrowing tunnels in the snow during winter. The only time he lost his temper was when Farmer Green mowed the meadow, exposing him to more risks. Despite the challenges, Master Meadow Mouse embraced the excitement of evading his foes and never complained about the dangers that kept his days interesting.|"['1.

One day, Master Meadow Mouse felt a strong urge to touch the distant blue spot he saw through the round tunnel. When his mother was away, he climbed through the hole and was surprised to find the blue disk much bigger and farther than he had imagined. Puzzled, he stood in the meadow near the tunnel's mouth, marveling at the new sights. Suddenly, his mother poked him into the tunnel, warning him to stay put. Master Meadow Mouse obeyed, wondering about his missing siblings and the mysterious Henry Hawk. As he grew, he explored the meadow but disregarded his mother's warnings about dangerous creatures. One day, he encountered a kitten, mistaking it for a giant threat. The kitten hesitated, surprised that Master Meadow Mouse didn't run like other mice. Unaware of his family's tactics, he stood his ground, ready to defend himself.|"['Question 1: What did Master Meadow Mouse see through the round tunnel that made him curious?\nA) A distant blue spot\nB) A red disk\nC) A green leaf\nD) A yellow flower\nE) A purple rock', 'Question 2: Why was Master Meadow Mouse surprised when he climbed through the hole in the tunnel?\nA) He found a smaller blue disk\nB) He saw his siblings playing\nC) The blue disk was closer than he thought\nD) The blue disk was bigger and farther than he had imagined\nE) He found a new tunnel', 'Question 3: What did Master Meadow Mouse do when his mother poked him into the tunnel?\nA) He ran away\nB) He stayed put\nC) He started exploring the meadow\nD) He searched for his siblings\nE) He confronted Henry Hawk', ""Question 4: Why did the kitten hesitate when it encountered Master Meadow Mouse?\nA) It was surprised that the mouse didn't run away\nB) It was hungry\nC) It was scared of Master Meadow Mouse\nD) It wanted to play\nE) It was looking for its siblings"", 'Question 5: What did Master Meadow Mouse do when he encountered the kitten?\nA) He ran away\nB) He stood his ground\nC) He climbed a tree\nD) He called for his mother\nE) He tried to befriend the kitten', 'Question 6: Why was Master Meadow Mouse ready to defend himself against the kitten?\nA) He thought the kitten was a giant threat\nB) He wanted to play with the kitten\nC) He was hungry\nD) He was looking for his missing siblings\nE) He was scared of the meadow']"|"['A) A distant blue spot', 'D) The blue disk was bigger and farther than he had imagined', 'B) He stayed put', ""A) It was surprised that the mouse didn't run away"", 'B) He stood his ground', 'A) He thought the kitten was a giant threat']"
"As she watched Master Meadow Mouse, the kitten felt he was growing larger by the second. She hesitated about pouncing on him. It was easier to chase someone who ran away. But seizing someone who didn't flee was a different story. ""Hunting isn't as fun as I thought,"" she mumbled. She briefly considered running back home. Then she imagined how happy her mother would be if she brought the plump mouse home. The Meadow Mouse family loved swimming and lived near water in the low meadow close to Broad Brook and Black Creek. Master Meadow Mouse learned to swim on his own, as natural as walking.

During his initial summer in Pleasant Valley, Master Meadow Mouse often observed old Mr. Crow flying from the woods to the cornfield. Mr. Crow occasionally visited the meadow, but Master Meadow Mouse wasn't afraid. The tall grass concealed his movements from prying eyes. However, after the hay was gathered, the meadow became exposed, and Master Meadow Mouse had to be vigilant. Henry Hawk would swoop down swiftly if he spotted any movement. While Mr. Crow continued his daily trips between the woods and the cornfield, Master Meadow Mouse wasn't concerned. He thought Mr. Crow harmless as long as he didn't catch small creatures in the cornfield. Mr. Crow was very protective of the corn and would become furious if anyone else ate it. Despite wanting corn, Master Meadow Mouse avoided the cornfield during the day to avoid Mr. Crow's anger. His mother had warned him never to be caught taking corn, advising him to wait until after sunset when Mr. Crow was asleep.|"['1.

Master Meadow Mouse was used to birds swooping down from the sky, not lurking on the ground like Mr. Crow did. Startled, he narrowly escaped the bird's clutches by slipping into his home. Mr. Crow, a clever old bird, hunted mice on foot, waiting until the grass was low after haying season to catch his prey. Although Mr. Crow almost caught Master Meadow Mouse, the little mouse outsmarted him and dashed to safety. After this close encounter, Master Meadow Mouse felt uneasy living in the meadow and decided to explore Farmer Green's yard, where the grass was long and provided better hiding spots. The tall grass offered him a sense of security, shielding him from prying eyes.|"[""1.

Master Meadow Mouse had a sudden idea to move to the farmyard. He thought it would be a great place to live with scattered grain for food and a nearby duck pond for swimming. So, he began building a cozy home in the woodpile. As he emerged to admire the stars, a plump gray mouse greeted him. Despite the newcomer's advice, Master Meadow Mouse continued building his new home, seemingly unaware of any nearby dangers like the lurking cat, Miss Snooper. However, after a close encounter with Miss Snooper, Master Meadow Mouse decided that the farmyard was not the safest place for him. With hunting being a constant threat, he preferred to spend his time searching for food and taking daytime naps in his house away from the farmyard.|"[""1.

Master Meadow Mouse initially settled near Farmer Green's woodpile but later moved to a spot close to the fence between the meadow and the pasture for safety from birds. Despite the comfort, he found a drawback due to potential disturbances. Eventually, he relocated to the cornfield after Farmer Green left ripe ears in the shocks. This move delighted Master Meadow Mouse as he realized the cornfield provided ample shelter and food. The shocked corn and the moonlit field brought joy to him, and he discovered many of his cousins had the same idea. They all sought out corn shocks as new homes, enjoying the golden glow of the moonlit night.|"[""1.

Many opted to be close to Broad Brook for a quick swim. Building their homes was a breeze with everything they needed nearby.

Life was comfortable in the cornfield, with plenty to eat without leaving home.

Master Meadow Mouse bravely faced Fatty Coon in the moonlight, feeling frightened by the intruder's huge and dangerous appearance. Remembering his mother's advice, he decided to retreat and seek a safer place.

Despite the unwelcome presence of predators like Solomon Owl and Simon Screecher, the large Meadow Mouse family still found joy in their nightly gatherings under the stars during winter. Johnnie Green, exploring the snow-covered fields, often spotted the delicate imprints of Master Meadow Mouse and his numerous cousins. The Meadow Mouse village, hidden beneath the ground, remained unknown to most, except for the observant owl and hawk who criticized the layout of their tunnels. Solomon Owl expressed a desire to join the mice in their festivities, while Simon Screecher lamented the scarcity of their prey due to the harsh winter conditions.

Master Meadow Mouse struggled to find enough seeds under the snow to satisfy his hunger. He had stored food but it wasn't sufficient. He promised not to repeat this mistake. Despite his promises, he couldn't find a meal. Following his cousin through the snow tunnels was tough, with many wrong turns. Finally, he found his cousin and realized he couldn't eat trees. So, he went to Farmer Green's orchard and enjoyed a big meal by gnawing on a young fruit tree. Peter Mink, like Master Meadow Mouse, enjoyed swimming in streams. He often visited different water bodies in Pleasant Valley, including the meadow where meadow mice swam.

When Peter Mink roamed near a frozen stream in winter, he chose to travel beneath the ice rather than on top of it. He didn't mind if there was a dry strip along the stream's edge where he could sneak along quietly without getting his feet wet. If he couldn't find a place to walk, he would swim instead. Master Meadow Mouse knew about Peter Mink's habit of lurking under the ice in rivers and creeks. Despite the lurking danger, Master Meadow Mouse still enjoyed taking a cold dip now and then. He was cautious, peeking around before venturing out. He felt safer when a Muskrat family member swam with him, as they had a warning signal for danger. One day, Master Meadow Mouse spotted Peter Mink's head darting out from under the bank, prompting him to rush back to safety.|"[""1.
