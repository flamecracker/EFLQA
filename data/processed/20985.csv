As soon as Paul entered the large hall, he raised the lamp above his head to illuminate the area. This helped him see without being blinded by the light.

Jack felt like time was dragging on forever as he anxiously waited. He imagined the vandals causing chaos at the camp, tossing their supplies and damaging their tents. This made him extremely agitated. Paul, on the other hand, remained calm, reassuring Jack that it was just a short wait until their friends would meet them at the high school campus. As they strolled down the street, Jack expressed his frustration at the troublemakers and their intentions to disrupt their camp. Paul, determined and protective, hinted at the possibility of standing up to them if needed. Their friend William, known for his past confrontations, shared their sentiments and suggested caution as they approached the school.

Jack grunted in response, acknowledging that breaking a pane of glass wouldn't deter the reckless individuals they were discussing if they had a big task at hand. He even speculated that they might resort to setting fire to the church if pressed. However, he believed their actions would be driven by fear of consequences rather than anything else. As they neared the old stone church, Paul, who had been observing the surroundings, noticed that the night was not as dark as when the church bell rang unexpectedly. The young moon in the sky promised brighter nights ahead, and an electric street light that was previously out was now illuminating the area. Paul, familiar with the land around the church, could plan their approach to the building's rear without leaving the cover of shadows. He recalled an incident with an old sun-dial that was now placed against the wall, which prompted him to tap a piece of wood with a steel nail to signal their accomplice without giving away their presence. Paul cautioned against making noise to avoid detection and instructed William on the location of the clubs they needed. William eagerly anticipated the opportunity to execute their plan, expressing excitement at the prospect of outsmarting their adversaries.|['1.

William returned with the clubs he had made, hoping they would be useful. They were ready for action against Ted Slavin's group, familiar with their schemes. Quietly, they moved near the entrance, armed and determined. William, eager to use his club, was cautioned by Paul. Ted's voice was heard, suggesting breaking in. Ward warned against damaging property. Bud knew of a weak window latch, and another boy offered to open the back door. Ted's forceful nature made his followers obey. Moving around camping gear, they navigated the dark. Paul found the furnace room and heard noises from a nearby window. Watching a figure against the night sky, Paul listened to footsteps and saw a match light up the intruder's face.|"['1.

Paul decided it was time to quietly retreat towards the chosen ashcan for cover. He signaled caution to the others, indicating they should stay alert. Bud approached, making noise and bumping into things. He struggled to see in the dark, while Paul observed him. Bud, startled by a rat-like noise, was actually tricked by Bobolink's ventriloquism. Terrified of rats, Bud panicked and fumbled with matches. He realized he was surrounded by rats and panicked even more. Frustrated, he yelled for someone inside to open the connecting door. The person inside claimed rats were attacking him, causing Bud to fear for his safety. Bud's impatience turned into anger as he demanded to be let in.

Bud Jones found himself in a dire situation, surrounded by imagined foes inside and a menacing bully outside. As he struggled with the ashcans in the dark, a mysterious voice startled him. Despite his plea of innocence to Ted, the furious leader was determined to teach Bud a lesson. The tension rose as the door swung open, revealing Paul and his loyal scouts waiting inside. Ted's bluster led his group into the dimly lit church, unaware of the impending surprise. Suddenly, a blinding light filled the room, accompanied by the Fox Patrol's signal barks. The tables turned as the intruders faced the unexpected turn of events, setting the stage for a thrilling encounter.|"['1.

The Boy Scouts acted swiftly, not bothering to count their enemies. They knew they had to act fast to capitalize on the surprise and demoralize the intruders. Chaos erupted immediately, and Ted realized it was time to retreat. William, relishing the chance to let loose, skillfully defended his friends. Meanwhile, Scissors tried to escape but only found obstacles. Among the scouts, a tradition of performing good deeds daily existed, symbolized by turning their badges upside-down until a kind act was done. Paul, wiping his face after the scuffle, knew they had taught a valuable lesson. William, disappointed the fight ended early, wondered why the intruders fled.

Paul doubted Bud's realization of his wrongdoing. Bud's comment about being tired of being the scapegoat showed his lack of understanding. Despite learning a lesson, Bud seemed unaware of his actions. William, still holding his weapon, asked if they were going to act now. A loud crash from the gym indicated Scissors' struggles. William, eager for action, suggested using a lamp to search the gym. They found Scissors trapped under blankets. The boys, excited, attacked him. Paul, wanting to end the chaos, unlocked the door, leaving the lamp unattended. Scissors, frantic to avoid the clubs, accidentally knocked over the lamp in his panic.|"[""1.

There was a loud crash, and Scissors let out a scream as he tripped and fell headfirst. Paul noticed a sudden burst of light; the lamp had shattered, spilling its flammable oil everywhere. Although kerosene is not as explosive as it used to be, it can still ignite under certain conditions. The church was in danger unless they acted fast! Paul swiftly grabbed a stack of blankets, with Jack close behind, grabbing a tent in the heat of the moment. Together, they beat the flames fiercely. Meanwhile, Scissors struggled as the fire caught on his oil-soaked clothes. William, who had dropped his club, rushed to help, using a blanket to smother the flames.

William gently reassured Scissors about his burn, noting that it was not too serious. Paul searched for a remedy in their medicine chest that had been upturned in the chaos.

Scissors hobbled towards the door, wary of William. The boys, though finding humor in the situation, were sobered by the near catastrophe.

Preparations were underway for an all-night vigil, with each member taking turns to stand guard in two-hour shifts. Despite the thorough defeat of the enemy, there was no fear of their return. Paul struggled to sleep, disturbed by the loud clock in the steeple. William's announcement of the morning tasks woke him abruptly. Bobolink complained of feeling sore and unwell, joking about needing an ambulance for the upcoming hike. William teased him, suggesting he had kicked too hard during the night. Bobolink eventually shook off the soreness, likely from sleeping on the hard floor. The boys of Stanhope were buzzing with excitement, eagerly awaiting the day's adventures.

The circus caravan sprang to life as the women performers peeked out from their wagons. All eyes turned to the rocky hill where flags waved. William, excited, called out for buckets, offering the coldest spring water for free. The elephant handler signaled the massive animal to kneel, allowing the keeper to climb down.

A group of young scouts was on a hiking trip, led by Paul. As they trekked away from town, the memory of a circus passing lingered in their minds. Dobbin, the horse, seemed eager to distance himself from the jungle animals they had encountered. By noon, they were five miles out, further than most had been. Despite some sore feet, the boys were in good spirits. William lightened the mood with his songs. Paul, feeling the weight of responsibility, led them to a water source for a break.

Andy Flinn was busy giving advice and helping the wounded ease their pain. He walked barefoot, his calloused soles indifferent to the stones. Familiar with the terrain from a recent bike ride, he guided the troop to set camp. The bugle's sound signaled the spot. Bobolink, though inexperienced in cooking, volunteered. Paul ensured tents were placed correctly to avoid rain pooling. Scouts swiftly erected tents, creating a military-like scene. Each tent had a waterproof cover. Fires were lit for cooking, carefully tended to avoid detection. The Stanhope boys learned valuable skills from Wallace Carberry. Despite hunger, Paul insisted on three meals a day.

Wallace responded to Ted's imitation of Indians in cheap library stories, noting how the redmen in those tales always attacked camps before dawn, not after moonset. Paul planned to be ready for any attack after 11 pm, anticipating the new moon's disappearance. Dobbin, the horse, was tethered closer to the camp for safety. The bugler's call dispersed the boys, who understood the importance of discipline in organized forces. They settled into their beds after lights out, avoiding any trouble during the night. Paul, Wallace, and others kept watch, exchanging signals if anything suspicious occurred.

What could stop a boy from competing with other things when trying to solve a mystery? Some boys can climb like monkeys; Paul knew some who could effortlessly move from tree to tree. He saw a swinging object from the limb he was staring at. Despite the tricky light, Paul recognized a boy hanging, trying to stay still to avoid being caught. Paul doubted anyone but an expert climber could pull off such a feat. He guessed the boy was Monkey Eggleston, known for his acrobatics. Monkey had likely received orders from Ted. Paul suspected Monkey planned to sneak into camp unseen to cause mischief. Paul debated whether to alert the camp or observe. Curiosity led him to approach quietly to see Monkey descending from the tree. As Monkey dropped to the ground near the mess tent, Paul watched closely. Monkey moved among the supplies, and when a dark figure suddenly sprang away, he tossed something into the fire.|"['1.

In a camp, the threat of a fire is almost as concerning as a sudden hurricane. Paul had warned everyone about these dangers, making even the newest campers aware of the seriousness.

Despite the darkness, Paul pursued Monkey, dodging obstacles skillfully. Aware of the risks, Paul continued the chase, closing in on Monkey.

The scouts were amazed and kept watch for more tricks. Despite the scare, they repaired their defenses and got some rest. Paul hoped the troublemakers learned their lesson, but he doubted it.

William was the host when it was time to begin making pancakes. The other cooks in the two groups followed his lead. Although they didn't have as much success as William, the scouts were happy with the results. They used up all the batter but were still sad because there weren't enough pancakes. Around nine o'clock, the group started moving with Bluff's drum and the bugle playing. By noon, some scouts were limping but were determined to keep up. The area was becoming more remote, and they caught glimpses of the river. As they rested after lunch, they noticed a man driving by, making Paul suspicious. Paul thought the man might have stolen the vehicle. Joe seemed to know the man but didn't want to share any information. Paul tried to figure out the mystery but couldn't place the man.|"['1.

Paul and his group of scouts were on an adventurous trek towards Rattlesnake Mountain, a place shrouded in mystery and strange stories. As they trudged along, the rough terrain tested their endurance. The boys, usually confined to the familiar paths near Stanhope, were now exploring the wild and untamed wilderness. Despite the challenging journey, the promise of reaching the mountain's base spurred them on. Even the slowest among them quickened their pace at the thought of their destination.

Paul, the patrol leader, signaled to Bobolink, and the bugle sounded, ending a long day's walk for the tired troop. Setting up camp became a lively affair as tents went up amidst banter. Each boy learned woodcraft firsthand, a lesson never forgotten. The majestic mountain beckoned, the stream's rush either soothing or keeping the boys awake. Amidst the trees, the camp sparkled under the moonlight. Paul approached Joe, offering help regarding his father's lost tin box. Joe, surprised, followed Paul to the riverbank.

Paul, recalling the man who ascended the mountain, pondered if Wallace was correct and if the unknown figure was watching them from above. That evening, the Banner Boy Scouts were joyous, singing to the tunes of a banjo. As storm clouds gathered, the boys secured their tents. Suddenly, loud cries woke Paul to chaos. The violent storm threatened to sweep everything away. Amidst the turmoil, William found himself tangled in the tent. The scouts, drenched in rain, struggled to hold on.

William recounted his adventure by the river to his friends. He joked about not wanting to disturb them during the storm, so he stayed put. His friend Paul, prepared for emergencies, started a fire with kindling from his tent.

"Paul saw Tom struggling in the water and immediately sprang into action. He threw a rope over a nearby stump and plunged into the swirling water to rescue his friend. Despite the strong current, Paul managed to reach Tom and keep him afloat by holding onto the rope. With great effort, Paul dragged Tom to safety and performed artificial respiration to revive him.

After a tense moment, Tom showed signs of recovery, much to the relief of everyone. Grateful for Paul's quick thinking and bravery, Tom thanked his friend for saving his life. The boys decided to skip further swimming and focused on breakfast instead. Tom, wrapped in warm clothes, watched his friends with gratitude for their support during the ordeal.

Paul, overwhelmed by the responsibility and relieved by the successful rescue, eagerly awaited the arrival of another friend to share the load. The boys reflected on the close call and the importance of looking out for one another during their adventurous journey."|"[""1.

Paul and Jud were discussing the art of Indian picture writing, where signs represent words. Paul explained that a whole story could be told using just a few characters. He demonstrated by drawing figures on a piece of bark to convey a message to their scoutmaster. Paul used a lead pencil to draw figures representing twenty-one white soldier boys having a picnic at noon. He added details like hats, a flag, a wagon, and a horse to make the story clear. Paul emphasized that the key to Indian picture writing is to make the signs simple and easy to understand, like a primer of writing.

Paul and his friends were on a trail, following clues left behind by someone who had stolen their ham. They found broken twigs and a stone overturned, leading them to a footprint in the soft earth. Paul used his common sense and knowledge to track the thief. They reached a spot where yellow eyes were seen, and Paul discovered marks on the ground where the ham had been taken. It was evident that a man, not a boy, had been there. The friends were dismayed at the loss of their ham. They suspected it might have been someone from the Slavin group but concluded it was a man due to the size of the foot and the homemade patch on the shoe.|['1.

Nuthin excitedly suggested that the old humpback rattlesnake oil man had returned to life like Rip Van Winkle. He speculated that the man might have been tempted by the delicious smells from the camp the previous night. Paul pondered the mysterious man's presence, seemingly out of place. Joe suspected the man of stealing ham, but the mention of his long foot and patched shoe cast doubt on this theory. Suddenly, Joe spotted a man on a fast-moving wheel, sparking curiosity among the scouts. Mr. Gordon, a knowledgeable scoutmaster, engaged the scouts in a lively discussion about recent events, including the missing ham incident, which ended in laughter. The scouts shared their adventures, and Mr. Gordon praised their efforts, particularly Paul's quick thinking during a rescue.

Bobolink cheerfully bid farewell to the ham and greeted Mr. Trout warmly. He expressed his dilemma of liking both trout and ham equally. The boys at the camp praised the fish served at lunch, sharing cooking suggestions. Some boys immediately went fishing after the meal, causing concern for the lake's fish population. Bobolink enjoyed listening to the cooking discussions. William made a mistake by asking for Bobolink's opinion, leading to chaos among the camp cooks. The story of blind men describing an elephant was shared, leading to a humorous chase through the woods. Paul and Mr. Gordon decided to fish from a raft, with Paul showcasing his fishing skills.

"Paul excitedly exclaimed, ""It's a dandy too, sir!"" as he witnessed the magnificent rainbow colors when the large trout leaped into the air, attempting to free itself by diving back into the water. ""Keep a firm grip on the line, sir, and if it pulls too hard, give it a bit more slack. Oh, what a beauty!"" Mr. Gordon pondered the mysterious lake, noting its lack of a visible outlet. Paul agreed, speculating that a hidden whirlpool might be present. Suddenly, Andy Flinn dived into a peculiar swirl below. Concerned, Mr. Gordon swiftly grabbed a rope, prepared for action.

Paul confidently reassured the group, closely monitoring the time. As they anxiously waited, gasps and groans filled the air. Despite the urge to act sooner, Paul stuck to his set time limit. When he finally emerged carrying Andy, cheers erupted! Two campers, unaware of the unfolding drama, raced to the scene. Guided by Mr. Gordon, Paul applied life-saving techniques to revive Andy successfully. Andy, recounting his near-drowning experience, vowed never to swim in the lake again. Though swimming activities continued, the boys avoided the dangerous area. Mr. Gordon, skilled in water sports, emphasized the importance of knowing rescue techniques.

The next day arrived without any disturbances. The scouts stationed on the mountain were prepared to defend the camp but had no need to act. As the scouts worked on photography, a distant sound caught their attention. A group of cyclists approached, with one member tumbling off his bike.

The patrol leader couldn't fathom what had frightened the others so much. He noticed Ted holding his injured left arm as they appeared rattled. The rest of the day passed pleasantly with camp activities. Nuthin was relieved that guard duty on the mountain was over since Ted and his group had left. However, William insisted on keeping watch in case of more trouble. Bobolink shared rumors of two other mysterious men in the area, making the scouts uneasy.

Shrill cries filled the air as the storm raged on. Scouts scrambled to wake up and dress quickly, having learned from past experiences. Tents flapped wildly, and some boys called out for Mr. Gordon, though he couldn't protect them from Nature's fury. Paul, recognizing the danger, sprang into action. He collapsed tents to prevent them from blowing away, guiding others to do the same. Despite the chaos, Paul managed to secure the provisions tent with heavy stones. Only two tents were lost to the storm, a feat considering the violent winds. The camp, once serene, now lay in ruins, with trees down and signs of a fierce tempest.

Hank quickly reacted to the alarm, showing more fear than his companion. Initially willing to confront the approaching danger, he soon realized he was alone and hurried after Hank, who carried the lantern. Paul discovered evidence of two sleeping men with cooking supplies, indicating they may have forced Ted's group out of the cave. Hank, a stranger called Pim, seemed like a criminal capable of any mischief. Paul recognized Pim as the man from the road incident. Joe finally confessed that Pim was his uncle, a convict from Australia, suspected of stealing valuable papers. Despite his reluctance, Joe sought Paul's help in recovering the missing documents, revealing a family secret to his trusted friends.|"['1.

Paul consoled Joe about his missing papers, suspecting that his uncle, possibly desperate for help, took them. As the boy scouts explored the tramp's hideout, they found food, liquor, and a revolver. Joe discovered kerosene for the lanterns but not the papers. They decided to stay for the night, with Paul troubled by the possibility of Chief Billings searching for the papers. Paul, burdened with responsibility, pondered the night's events, especially the encounter with Hank. Recalling the stumble that alerted Hank to their presence, Paul felt the weight of the situation as he lay under the same blanket that once belonged to the tramp.|"[""1.

Paul made a remarkable discovery while investigating Hank's coat. He found a bunch of folded documents in the inside pocket, possibly the lost papers that had caused Mr. Clausin distress. As he debated whether to tell Joe about his find, a noise startled him. Believing Hank was returning for his coat and its valuable contents, Paul readied his revolver for protection. Suddenly, a whisper and a touch on his arm made him shiver. Paul signaled his friends, and they captured Hank, tying his hands. Despite Hank's protests and threats, Joe, saddened but relieved, knew the precious papers were safe. As they kept watch through the night, they realized Hank had escaped, likely with Joe's help to protect his family's honor. The group, now fully awake, decided to head back, with Paul feeling indifferent about the escape.|"[""1.

Joe confessed to the boys that the man they encountered was not his uncle but a bad man who escaped after taking his dad's papers. Mr. Gordon praised the boys for their quick thinking during the storm, and they were able to return to Camp Surprise undamaged. Joe's father, along with Mr. Norris and Chief Billings, arrived, relieved to find the papers returned. The boys continued to learn valuable skills from Mr. Gordon and each other, improving their cooking and wilderness survival abilities. The troop headed home with Old Dobbin pulling their wagon downhill easily. The success of their first trip led to discussions of future outings. As the camp ended, the boys forgave a hunchback caught stealing food, showing their Scout values. Paul also suspected that Ted and his friends were scared off by encountering Pim and Hank.|"['1.
