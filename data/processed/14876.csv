More fighters, walking on the logs, demonstrated that his caution was justified. They prodded occasionally in the water, among the large amount of debris, and one stood on a log so close to the two boys that they could have touched his moccasined feet. However, their hiding spot was too near to be noticed, and soon the man moved on. Paul did not object, but he was getting cold. The cold from the river water was seeping into his veins, and he yearned for dry land and a chance to move around. Yet he gritted his teeth and decided to endure. He would not budge until Henry gave the signal. Henry understood that the Shawnees, unable to locate a spot beyond the debris where the runaways had emerged onto the bank, would think they might be concealed under the logs and would not abandon the search there. Henry laughed. He, too, was stiff and cold; however, a natural woodsman, he now dismissed their long concealment in the water as merely an episode. They reached the valuable rifles and ammunition, extracted them from hiding, and stepped onto the bank, streams flowing from their clothes, and even their hair. Henry started immediately, and Paul walked briskly by his side. The streams that dripped from their garments reduced to tiny rivulets, and then only droplets fell.

However, his search was fruitless until he expanded his circle and stumbled upon a vast flock of wild pigeons. This unexpected discovery provided him with an abundance of food. With no need to worry about gunfire, Henry simply used a stick to knock down as many pigeons as he desired. He swiftly returned to the cabin with his catch. Finding Paul still asleep, Henry decided to surprise him. He rekindled the fire, prepared two plump pigeons, and cooked them in a pot. As the savory aroma filled the air, Paul stirred in his sleep. Eventually, Paul woke to Henry offering him the delicious pigeon stew, which they both enjoyed heartily. The fortuitous encounter with the pigeons left Paul feeling grateful and reminded him of the cabin's timely discovery, leading him to believe that they were being watched over by a higher power.

Henry, full of confidence, spoke lightly in the little cabin, feeling it was an impregnable castle. The rifle fire ceased, leaving silence in the wilderness. Paul hesitated about sleeping with enemies nearby but agreed due to the warmth and need for rest. Henry, admiring Paul's courage, watched the forest lazily, knowing the conflict would come at night. After two hours, Henry woke Paul to take his place on guard. As the afternoon waned, they awaited the approaching twilight. The night fell thick and black, concealing the forest.

A loud cry echoed, followed by a chilling silence that gripped Paul's soul. Henry, spotting movement in the shadows, fired with precision. Paul, peering through a loophole, saw figures darting towards the cabin. He fired his rifles, unsure if he hit his targets. Suddenly, heavy thuds against the walls and deep breathing outside filled the air. Henry reassured Paul, urging caution near the loopholes. As they reloaded, they stayed hidden against the walls, listening keenly. Shots from outside pierced the cabin, but missed. Paul, fueled by imagination, felt the intensity of the situation. Henry predicted an attack on the door, fortifying it silently. The rain began to fall, and Henry spotted men approaching with a tree trunk to break in.

Paul was filled with horror as he sat in the cabin, surrounded by the dead warriors. The heavy rifle smoke made him feel faint and sick, as if he were breathing poisoned air. But as the smoke cleared, his strength and spirit returned. He eagerly accepted the task of removing the bodies, finding it better than being watched by the dead men with their lifeless eyes. With Henry's help, they heaved the bodies out the window, the dull thuds echoing below. The sound of rifles from the forest made them tense, but the rain's calming patter soothed Paul. He scattered ashes over the dark spots on the floor, finding the sight repulsive. Henry reassured him that the attackers were not likely to strike again that night. Paul refused to sleep, determined to share the watch with Henry.|"[""1.

Henry lay down on the floor and closed his eyes. He felt certain that no further attacks would come that night. If they did, Paul would wake him. The rain on the roof soothed him like a lullaby. His nerves were steady, his body and mind calm. He drifted into peaceful sleep. Paul, alert again, watched the dim forest through the loopholes. They seemed alone in the world, safe and dry in the cabin. As the sun rose, the cabin grew warm. Hours passed, and the warriors did not leave. Henry warned Paul of the possibility of being starved out. They ate what little food remained, knowing the situation was dire. Paul, feeling the weight of the silence and limited rations, feared the future. He suggested slipping through the enemy lines at night.

The afternoon slowly passed, and darkness fell as Henry had hoped. Rain showered intermittently, carried by gusts of wind. The two boys drank from the barrel and ate venison. The darkness enveloped them like a sable curtain. The forest, clearing, and hut disappeared in the blackness. The sky had no stars. Rain pattered on the cabin roof. Despite the somber nature, it lightened their hearts. Paul felt comfort in the darkness. They stepped lightly, avoiding noise. Henry led them around the cabin unnoticed.

They journeyed through the night, taking brief rests, navigating rough, dense woods. As dawn broke, rain stopped, clouds dispersed, revealing a starry sky and a gentle breeze. Henry gazed sympathetically at Paul, who, though weary, showed determination. Henry halted suddenly, pointing to a red spot deep in the woods. Paul, exhausted but obedient, settled in a sheltered spot. As Henry stealthily advanced, Paul felt a sense of peace, eyes heavy with fatigue. Nearby creatures observed him undisturbed. Paul, rousing himself, followed Henry to a campfire where six rugged men, armed and at ease, enjoyed breakfast.

Paul and Shif'less Sol were in a forest combat. They waited patiently, with Paul feeling more stoic. Suddenly, a shot rang out, and a Shawnee fell dead. More shots followed, and the enemy crept closer. Shif'less Sol remained calm, firing with precision. The Shawnees began yelling to intimidate, but the noise stopped abruptly, and the battle ended. Paul was amazed by the sudden silence and disappearance of the foe. Unfortunately, one of the hunters had been shot and died instantly. Despite some injuries, the borderers remained resilient. Shif'less Sol reminded Paul that noise wasn't as dangerous as bullets. The forest was quiet once more, with only the still, fallen figures as a reminder of the fierce battle.|"[""1.

The Shawnees stayed quiet and hidden in the woods, while the white men also remained silent, waiting behind the trees. The fallen lay in between, their faces looking up to the red sun in the cloudless blue sky. As the day passed peacefully, the men prepared for a possible attack by the Shawnees in the darkness. Paul, feeling a sense of awe and weirdness, focused on the present, checking his ammunition and preparing for battle. When the night fell, the battle began with shots fired in the dark. Paul, fascinated by the flashes of light, was soon caught in the chaos of the midnight battle. Despite the confusion, he followed Shif'less Sol's advice to stay close and focused on the fight. The darkness seemed to thicken, and the battle intensified, with bullets flying and soldiers on both sides engaged in the fierce conflict.|"['1.

Paul found himself in the midst of a fierce battle, struggling to distinguish friend from foe in the darkness. As he followed Sol and Henry's guidance, he fired at shadows and heard the chaos of combat around him. The savages closed in, and soon Paul was overtaken and captured. Dragged deeper into the forest, he witnessed the defeated warriors around him, their eyes filled with anger and defeat. Despite being a prisoner, Paul felt a sense of pride that his companions had emerged victorious. As the moonlight revealed the scene, Paul's fate hung in the balance, unsure if he would be spared or killed by the vengeful warriors.|"[""1.

A slim, sharp-faced warrior, seeming to lead the group, spoke briefly to the others before they nodded towards Paul. With a warrior on each side, they headed north. Paul, regaining clarity, realized they saw him as a trophy, to display in their village before his demise. As they silently marched through the forest, Paul observed about twenty warriors, likely having lost half in battle. Their fierce appearance repulsed him, unlike Henry who once embraced the wilderness. To Paul, the wilderness would be a future home for a great white race. Resting by a creek at dawn, Paul's arms were freed, and he ate venison ravenously. Exhausted, he fell asleep. Upon waking to a larger group, he found Braxton Wyatt, a disliked acquaintance from Wareville.

Wyatt explained that he had gradually learned some words from Chief Red Eagle, making communication easier. The chief assured Wyatt that if they caused no trouble, their hands wouldn't be bound again. As they marched northward, Paul felt more optimistic, especially with Wyatt's companionship. Wyatt advised Paul not to get his hopes up about escaping, as the Shawnee group was strong. They were treated relatively well, allowed to talk and not mistreated. The group camped in a forest, where they feasted on venison. Paul observed the warriors conversing and realized that their fate might be decided once they reached the Shawnee village. Despite the feast, Paul couldn't shake off the feeling of repulsion towards the warriors, understanding that their ways could never align with his.|"['1.

He spoke to Red Eagle, and the thin-faced chief nodded. Braxton picked up two sharpened sticks and two large pieces of venison. He handed one stick and one piece to Paul. Paul felt grateful towards Braxton. Although he had misjudged him in the past, Paul's heart warmed as he fried the deer meat over the coals. After eating hungrily, peace settled within him, and he slept soundly that night by the fire. The Shawnees were slow to depart, showing laziness in their movements. They hunted plentifully, eating voraciously, spending days indulging in food and rest. Paul observed their alternating laziness and energy, their gluttony, and lethargy. He maintained a friendly demeanor, following Wyatt's advice. Wyatt mentioned that Red Eagle might consider adopting Paul. As they reached the Ohio River, the Shawnees delayed crossing, spending days idling by the riverbank. Paul remained hopeful of escape or rescue, never losing sight of his goal to aid Kentucky.|"['1.

"""I do not know,"" he said. ""It is true they build no camp fires, at least no big ones, and they do not seem to be much interested in hunting; but I cannot guess what they are about, and I should not dare to ask Red Eagle."" Paul noticed that Red Eagle himself often went down to the bank of the river, and would watch its surface with the keenest attention. But Paul observed also that he always looked eastward--that is, up the stream--and never down it. Paul and Wyatt were allowed an increasing amount of liberty, but they were held nevertheless within a ring through which they could not break; Paul was shrewd enough to perceive it, and for the present he made no effort, thinking it a wise thing to appear contented with his situation, or at least to be making the best of it. Braxton Wyatt commended his policy more than once. On the morning of the seventh day the chief went down to the bank of the river once more, and began to watch its surface attentively and long, always looking up the stream. Paul and Braxton Wyatt and some of the warriors stood among the trees, not fifty feet away. They also could see the surface of the river for a long distance, and Paul's eyes followed those of the chief, Red Eagle. The Ohio was a great yellow river, flowing slowly on in its wide channel, the surface breaking into little waves, that crumpled and broke"|"[""1.

The final act of cruelty shook the boy's kind heart. Despite his urge to warn, the warriors forcefully held him back, threatening with a tomahawk. Paul knew any signal would mean his end, unable to alert the boat. Trembling, he feared for the passengers. As the boat approached, he noticed men, a woman, and a child on deck. Realizing the boat's safety in the wide river, he felt relief until a familiar face, Braxton Wyatt, emerged in distress. Wyatt's desperate cries reached the boat, prompting a turn towards him. Paul, shocked by Wyatt's betrayal, overcame his fear, risking his life to shout a warning, disrupting the savages' deadly plan.|"['1.

Paul witnessed chaos on the boat, with people running around and the oars bucking. Suddenly, rifle shots rang out, and a heavy impact knocked him into darkness. When he awoke, he found himself bound among trees, his memory flooding back. He saw the boat disappearing down the river, his heart filled with relief. Observing the Indians nearby, he noticed no signs of victory. Braxton Wyatt approached, explaining his actions were to save them from torture. Despite Wyatt's words, Paul remained silent, feeling the loneliness of crossing the Ohio River into the unknown wilderness. The river symbolized a boundary between his familiar world and the untamed wilderness. Paul's imagination painted a bleak picture of what lay ahead.|"['1.

They arrived at the northern shore easily, concealed the canoes for later use, and continued their relaxed journey northward. Braxton Wyatt, who appeared to Paul to have a lot of freedom, restarted his attempts to rekindle their old friendship, but Paul remained firm. Despite Wyatt's pleas and excuses, Paul couldn't shake off his repulsion. Wyatt insisted that Paul would one day appreciate his actions, claiming it was necessary to combat cunning with cunning in the forest. The days passed in hunting, eating, resting, and walking, and Paul lost track of time, distance, and direction. Eventually, they reached a place where the forest thinned out, revealing a small prairie. The warriors, painted in even more frightening colors, began a mournful chant, signaling their return after a disaster. The old squaws welcomed Paul with jubilation, surrounding him with their eerie presence. Despite their torment, Paul tried to fight back, causing laughter among the tormentors. Eventually, the warriors intervened, ending the ordeal. The group then proceeded towards the Indian village, situated in a well-chosen location with signs of abundance all around.|"['1.

When Paul arrived at the village, Red Eagle, the chief, shielded him from persecution. Although Paul's pride prevented him from asking about his fate, he found himself confined in a small hut. The cramped space had only a skin couch and some gaps letting in fresh air and village sounds. Paul felt despair, separated from his friends by the Ohio River and now by the Shawnee village. He longed for the growing settlements and civilization. Despite initial resistance, he eventually showed kindness to the old couple who cared for him, though he remained resolute in not becoming a savage. Allowed to roam the village after a week, he felt watched by every eye, but treasured the freedom and the sight of the autumn forest.|"['1.

Paul felt abandoned in the wilderness, longing for his friends from Wareville. Sitting on a rock at twilight, he watched the sun disappear, feeling forsaken. The village buzzed behind him, but he found no solace in the savage life around him. As he headed back to his nightly hut, a warrior stumbled into him, whispering in English. Startled, Paul hid his excitement, wondering who the mysterious English speaker was. Despite the darkness, hope flickered within him at the thought of friends nearby.

Paul walked quietly to his prison hut, trying to hide his excitement. He was relieved to know that his friends hadn't forgotten him and were willing to risk their lives to help him. As he gazed at the campfires and shadowy figures outside, he felt a mix of emotions. Soon, he would be leaving behind the wild life he had known. Inside his hut, he waited patiently, listening to the sounds of the village. Eventually, he heard someone working on the door. With bated breath, he watched as the door opened, revealing a familiar figure. It was Sol, disguised as a Shawnee warrior. Sol explained that Henry and others were waiting in the woods to help him escape.

Paul quickly lay on the couch, pretending to sleep, while Shif'less Sol concealed himself in a corner. Braxton Wyatt unexpectedly entered the room, suspiciously finding the door unlocked. Approaching Paul cautiously, he was suddenly attacked and overpowered by hidden figures. Paul and Shif'less Sol then bound and silenced Braxton Wyatt, leaving him on the bed. Despite feeling sorry for him, Paul followed Shif'less Sol's lead in this charade. They then left, securing the doors behind them, and casually strolled through the village.

At the edge of the village, near the forest, Shif'less Sol planned their escape. Paul stuck close, noticing the dimming light with relief. The forest was close, his heart raced. Passing the last wigwam, an old squaw blocked their path. Recognizing Paul, she cried out, trying to stop them. Shif'less Sol intervened, freeing Paul from her grip. Fleeing towards the forest, the village alarmed. Shawnee warriors pursued, bullets whizzing past. Paul glimpsed the approaching danger. Suddenly, Henry, Tom, and Jim emerged, offering support. They ran north through the woods, the pursuers falling back. Reaching safety, they paused, breathing deeply. The group continued westward in silence, relieved and grateful for their escape.|"[""1.

Paul, Jim, and Hart quickly fell asleep on the soft grass. Henry and Ross stayed awake, their faces lit by the moon. When Paul woke up, the group ate dried venison for breakfast. Henry handed Paul a piece, and they discussed the urgent tribal movements in Kentucky. The Shawnees were uniting with other tribes to attack the white settlements. They mentioned Braxton Wyatt's threat. Paul, Sol, and Jim were ready for action. They checked their ammunition and headed north through a beautiful land filled with game. As they entered a dense forest, Paul caught a glimmer of gold in the setting sun.|"['1.

"Kentucky had no lakes, and Paul knew little about them. As they hurried forward, Paul thought more about the lake than Henry's mysterious words, ""We're going to live in it."" Upon reaching the lake's edge, Paul gasped in delight. The lake was a magnificent half-moon shape, about seven miles long and two miles wide at its center. In the widest part stood a beautiful wooded island with towering trees. Surrounding the lake were high hills covered in lush forests. The beauty of the scene touched everyone, even uneducated men like Shif'less Sol and Jim Hart. They all stood in awe, gazing at the lake and the wooded island as the sinking sun painted the waters silver and the trees with a fiery glow. Shif'less Sol closed his eyes briefly, savoring the heavenly moment, before the boat reached the island. Paul, too, felt the enchantment of the island and the darkening lake but kept his ghostly fears at bay. As they hid the boat and settled on the island, Henry revealed that it was an ancient burial ground, believed to be haunted by the spirits of the departed. Despite the eerie history, they all settled down to rest, lulled by the gentle wind under the starlit sky, ready to uncover more mysteries in the days ahead."|"[""1.

Paul and his friends enjoyed a peaceful evening by the fire after a successful hunt. They cooked venison and made fishing tackle from their clothing. The group explored the island, feeling safe and free from danger. As night fell, they hid their canoe and waited quietly for wildlife to approach the water. A massive buffalo came to drink but was left unharmed as it was too large to handle. Other creatures followed, including a mysterious predator, but the hunters remained still, waiting for the right opportunity. The night passed with tension in the air, and Paul marveled at the beauty and danger of the wilderness around them.|['1.

A heavy step approached, and Paul saw a grand stag emerge into the moonlight. The stag drank from the water when a shot rang out, felling the majestic creature. Henry, Ross, and Paul loaded the stag into the boat with care. Meanwhile, Shif'less Sol and Jim Hart caught fish. The group planned to leave the island to spy on a confederacy threatening settlements. Paul stayed behind with Jim while the others departed. Paul felt lonely but found solace in the fire's warmth.

Paul and Jim Hart spent a week on the island, enjoying their time together. They fished and hunted, building a shelter to keep dry. They killed deer and a bear, using the skins for warmth. One day, they saw smoke in the distance, likely from an Indigenous hunting party. Feeling safe, they continued their work on the lean-to. Despite wanting tools to improve their shelter, they made do with what they had. The smoke disappeared, and they decided to explore the mainland for more game. Jim stayed in the boat while Paul ventured into the forest, being cautious not to get lost. They hoped to find more animals to hunt.|['1.

Paul ventured into the woods armed with his rifle, hoping to find game near the stream. Moving silently under the moonlight, he carefully observed the surroundings, absorbed in his hunting mission. Unaware of the time passing, Paul's focus was suddenly broken as a Miami warrior stealthily approached him. The warrior attempted to capture Paul, but with a burst of strength, Paul broke free and landed a powerful punch on the warrior, stunning him. Seizing the opportunity, Paul ran towards safety, with the warrior's companions in pursuit. Jim Hart, a brave man, joined the fray, firing at the pursuers and helping Paul escape in a canoe.

Paul and Jim were in a canoe, carefully navigating the lake to reach their hidden island. They knew they had to trick the Indians who were chasing them. Jim skillfully shot the chief with his rifle, causing the others to miss their shots. As they paddled, the Indians tried to keep up but eventually lost sight of them.

The two cautiously observed the lake from their hiding spot among the trees on the island. They watched as a line of canoes approached, their hearts pounding with fear. The canoes, carrying warriors, seemed to be heading straight for the island. Paul and Jim lay low, hidden from view, hoping the Miamis wouldn't discover them. The tension was high as the canoes circled the lake, but thankfully, they kept their distance. After days of waiting in the shadows, Jim cooked deer steaks on a dark night, ensuring their safety.

A couple of days later, a powerful thunderstorm arrived unexpectedly, even though it was late in the season. The thunder rumbled loudly, and the landscape was illuminated by dazzling flashes of lightning. Jim Hart was awestruck by the display of nature. Following the storm, heavy rain forced them to seek refuge in their hut, which thankfully kept them dry. As the rain subsided, the night grew dark with lingering clouds overhead. Jim suggested fishing, and Paul agreed. Despite the darkness and the lack of bites due to their basic fishing gear, they patiently waited. Suddenly, a distant wailing sound caught their attention. Jim and Paul understood the need for caution, suspecting possible danger. They navigated through the dark waters carefully, following a predetermined path towards safety.

Five cautiously boarded the canoe, distributing their weight carefully. Shif'less Sol, now handling the paddle, paused mid-sweep, ears alert to a distant splash. The sound drew nearer, prompting them to hide among the bushes in the shallow water. A Miami war party, seven or eight strong, paddled by closely followed by five more canoes. Hearts raced silently as they passed. Once the coast was clear, they resumed their journey to the hidden island, navigating the dark, foggy waters with skill. Ross and Shif'less Sol steered expertly, avoiding detection. Safely ashore, they took refuge in a hut, grateful for the shelter.

While the others slept, Jim Hart, a brave and faithful watcher, observed the moonlight breaking through the fog as autumn waned. With the dawn, he alerted his comrades about a looming threat: a league of tribes uniting to attack the white settlements in Kentucky. Among them was Braxton Wyatt, a venomous renegade. Henry shared that the Shawnees sought to rally other tribes for a winter assault, aiming to catch the settlements off guard.

The trio had gathered fresh ammunition supplies during their absence and refilled Paul and Jim Hart's powder-horns and bullet pouches. They also brought soft, warm blankets likely traded from European merchants by the Indians, giving one to each of the boys. Under the cover of a dark night, they set off in a canoe towards the western shore, leaving behind the island that had been their refuge. Shif'less Sol expressed relief at the thought of the upcoming mission, contrasting it with their current situation.

The old chief, Gray Beaver, was puzzled by the conflicting tales from the belt bearers and Braxton Wyatt. Yellow Panther raised doubts about the Shawnees' intentions for war or peace. Braxton Wyatt, shaken by the situation, couldn't confirm the existence of the warriors who brought peace belts.

Henry Ware responded to Tom Ross's concerns about the village, acknowledging that something was amiss. Yellow Panther, the cunning wolf, and Braxton were suspicious and eager to uncover the truth. Despite this, Henry, also known as Big Fox, decided to stay in the village to thwart their plans. He planned to influence Gray Beaver, the cautious elder, to support their cause. After a brief discussion, Henry transformed back into Big Fox, the Shawnee chief, and mingled with the villagers. His presence commanded respect and admiration, with his stature and demeanor leaving a lasting impression. Yellow Panther approached Big Fox, hinting about white men in the region, hoping to extract information. Despite the lurking danger, Big Fox navigated the village effortlessly, impressing everyone with his knowledge and demeanor.

In the Miami village, Big Fox, Brown Bear, and The Bat witnessed Miami boys practicing archery with owls as targets. When the chief, Yellow Panther, showcased his skill, Big Fox stepped up to the challenge. With his extraordinary strength and precision, Big Fox not only matched but surpassed Yellow Panther's shot, impressing everyone present. The belt bearers were then urged to stay longer by Gray Beaver and Yellow Panther, but they politely declined, citing the Shawnees' upcoming Northwest hunt as their reason for departure. Despite Braxton Wyatt's silence, he was outplayed by Big Fox's diplomacy throughout the encounter.

Big Fox noticed that Yellow Panther and Braxton Wyatt offered no resistance to their departure. This observation did not escape him, and he drew his own conclusions from it. His ability to understand people's expressions was almost as remarkable as his skill in interpreting the signs of the forest. Autumn had progressed further, with leaves falling rapidly and the wilderness becoming more open. A brisk wind blew in their faces as they journeyed. The three men, now known as Henry Ware, Tom Ross, and Solomon Hyde, moved swiftly for many miles. Shif'less Sol was the first to speak. Henry nodded, and they continued southeast at an easy pace. They made no effort to conceal their tracks, moving through the undergrowth with visibility from a distance. Despite being aware of the Miamis following them, there was no fear among the trio. As they approached a creek, they changed direction and circled back, eventually hiding in a thicket. From there, they saw the Miami warriors pass by, led by Yellow Panther and trailed by Braxton Wyatt. Shif'less Sol expressed his disdain for the renegade Wyatt. When Wyatt was alone and distracted, Henry seized the opportunity and captured him with the help of Tom and Sol. Wyatt, taken by surprise, realized his imminent fate.|"['1.

The next morning, Paul woke to a frost-covered landscape, grateful for the shelter they had found. Working together, they expanded and fortified the hut with bark and brush, while Henry and Ross returned with a deer for food. Days passed with fishing and hunting, gradually accumulating meat and skins for warmth. Paul took pride in decorating the hut with furs, creating a cozy retreat. As they settled into their routine, Paul felt content knowing a message had been sent back to Wareville, freeing him from worry.

Paul, although tempted to join the hunters, had his own idea. He decided to craft a large bag from buckskin using a homemade needle and deer tendon as thread. With the bag slung over his shoulder, Paul headed north to gather hickory nuts from the grove near the water. He cracked the nuts open, enjoying their flavor, and collected several bushels. Returning home, Paul proudly displayed his harvest and set out to gather more. Throughout the morning, he worked diligently, accumulating a substantial quantity of nuts by the wall.

As the day progressed, they also strengthened their house with bark slabs, thatching the roof with grass and leaves. While working, they heard a turkey in the distance, signaling the approaching day.

""Now,"" Jim whispered, and they fired simultaneously, aiming for the necks. The gobbler dropped instantly, while the hen fluttered. Paul finished off the hen, and Jim marveled at the gobbler's beauty and weight. Later, back at the cabin, they enjoyed the warmth of the fire and the bounty of their hunt.

After three days of heavy snowfall, the sun finally broke through the clouds, creating a dazzling white landscape that hurt Paul's eyes. To shield their eyes from the intense glare, Paul and his companions crafted makeshift sunglasses using small pieces of wood and deerskin string, inspired by the protective eyewear of the Esquimaux. As they adapted to the bright surroundings, they found comfort in their cozy shelter, surrounded by deep snow that insulated their home.

When both stood up, a large black bear also rose, growling fiercely and extending its powerful paws with sharp claws. The bear had fallen through the roof, enraged. Paul quickly moved away to avoid the claws but found himself cornered against the wall with the bear blocking the door. Shif'less Sol tried to evade the bear, unable to reach their rifles. The bear, in a frenzy, clawed at the air. Unable to escape, Paul and Shif'less Sol hopped around while cold air rushed in through the damaged roof. The bear ran into the furnace, causing it pain.

"""I'm glad you think the same way as I do,"" said Sol, with a sense of relief. ""I wanted to know your thoughts, Paul, before I shared them with the others. We have much to be grateful for. We're all safe and well, despite facing many dangers."" They returned to the cabin, and Sol informed the group that they would celebrate Christmas on their island in the wilderness.

The path led straight to the cabin, and the panther trod it on noiseless pads, his eyes glowing, and hunger attacking him all the more fiercely because, mingled with the strange, new odor now came many odors that he knew, and all pleasant--odor of buffalo and deer and others--and he was very, very hungry. He went down the path to the door of the cabin, and halted a moment there. A red gleam, a glow from the bed of coals, came through a chink beside the door, and it filled his heart with terror. He shivered, and fear drew a low growl from him. One of the five sleepers inside stirred and sat up. He listened and heard a heavy breathing at the door. Then he arose, took a brand from the fire, stepped noiselessly to the door, and, opening it, rushed out, waving the burning brand in front of him. The panther, stricken with frightful panic, fled down the path, and then over the lake into the woods on the mainland. Henry Ware, laughing silently, returned to the cabin and lay down to sleep again beside his comrades, who had slept on, undisturbed. The singular existence of the five in the little hollow in the haunted island endured much longer. The great cold had come early, and it held the earth fast in its grasp.

Tom Ross expressed his skepticism about the ancient Greeks and Trojans, finding their ways of fighting strange. He mocked the boasting and grandiose claims made by warriors like A-Killus, highlighting how their tactics would not hold up in modern times against a Shawnee warrior. Ross also criticized the interference of goddesses in battles, believing in fair fights without magical interventions. In contrast, Paul preferred the stories where gods like Jupiter allowed fair combat. Henry respected Paul's deep thinking and understanding of the world. Later, Henry and Ross crossed back to the mainland, hunting and scouting. They killed a deer and showed caution by staying hidden in the forest. The two strong men carried the deer in silence, communicating more through actions than words.|"[""1.

"They said no more, but each understood. Their own trail would be left in the snow, and the sight of it would confirm all the suspicions of Wyatt and the savages. Some such chance as this they had always expected, and now they prepared to deal with it. They turned back into the forest, carrying with them the body of the deer, as they were resolved not to abandon it. Both had noticed that the slight abatement of the cold was not lasting. In an hour or two it would be as chill as ever, and once more the surface of the snow would be icy. They stayed several hours in a dense clump of trees and bushes, and then, half walking, half sliding, they resumed their journey, but now they left no trail. Each also had every sense alert, and nothing could come within sound or sight and not be perceived first by these two wonderful trackers, masters of their craft. They reached the edge of the lake in the twilight, and then they sped swiftly over the ice to their island home.

""I'm thinking,"" said Henry Ware, at a council a little later, ""that Braxton Wyatt suspects we're here. He, of course, does not believe in the Indian superstitions, and maybe he'll persuade them to search the island.""

The cold was severe, and the frozen snow surface was very smooth. The warriors, wearing thick moccasins of buffalo hide, with hair underneath, walked confidently toward the lake. They moved through the thick forest, passing from tree to tree, as the Indian warriors seek surprise attacks for the greatest victory. The night was dark as they reached the lake's shore, the darkness adding to the mystery. Despite their leaders' encouragement, they hesitated at the sight of the island's shadowy outline. Braxton Wyatt and Yellow Panther urged them forward, leading the way onto the frozen lake. The warriors followed silently. The island's ancient burial ground was on the north end, but they approached from the south. As they neared the island, they saw no sign of life. Braxton Wyatt took a bold step onto the soil, but the warriors were startled by ghostly figures in the moonlight and fled in terror. The island remained haunted, untouched by their intrusion.|['1.

""You both did a splendid job,"" Henry praised as he emerged. ""The finest ghosts I've seen. No Indian will dare come near this island for a long time.""

Paul beamed with joy, knowing his quick thinking had saved them. As they relaxed in their warm shelter, they laughed and enjoyed a hearty breakfast the next morning, reflecting on the night's events.

Henry replied that they should not leave before the cold weather passed. He mentioned that the emigrant train wouldn't arrive until spring, and they could do better work by staying to watch out for any potential dangers from the savages. They spent a long time in the hut on the haunted island, having plenty of food and warmth.

The warriors hurriedly prepared for the next stage of the war trail, focusing on gathering supplies like clothing, food, and ammunition. Departing under the cover of night in their canoe, they cast a final glance at the dark silhouette of the haunted island they left behind. War belts circulated among tribes like the Shawnee, Miami, Ottawa, and Wyandot, signaling a united effort against the encroaching white settlers. The tribes feared the settlers would destroy their hunting grounds and way of life. The warriors, fueled by revenge and necessity, readied themselves for an ambush on a large wagon train heading to strengthen the settlements in Wareville and Marlowe.

"Tom Ross and Dick Salter, longtime pals, were already exchanging greetings. Henry Ware glanced at the settlers pushing forward in a large group, his eyes revealing sympathy and warmth as he observed the eager, youthful faces among them. ""We're here to warn you,"" Henry stated in hushed, serious tones, ""that a formidable force of warriors, provided by the league of the northwestern tribes, plans to attack you. Their aim is to prevent you from reaching Wareville or Marlowe to strengthen those towns. They intended to set up an ambush, but we've been in their midst and are aware of their schemes."" Daniel Poe felt a surge of confidence and bravery from Henry's words.
