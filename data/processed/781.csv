During the tragic sinking of the Titanic, brave individuals displayed remarkable acts of heroism and selflessness. Despite the chaos and fear, some passengers, like Washington A. Roebling, 2d, and Howard Case, chose to help others rather than save themselves. Roebling and Case assisted women and children into lifeboats, refusing to board themselves. As the situation grew more dire, some passengers, like Mrs. Isidor Straus, chose to remain with their loved ones and face death together. Their courage and sacrifice in the face of impending disaster showcased the true meaning of bravery and love.

Whiteley had a tough experience during the Titanic disaster. After getting entangled in a rope and thrown into the sea, he suffered a leg injury that he only felt once he was safe aboard the Carpathia. He recounted floating on a life-preserver for hours until he found a dresser with two men clinging to it. As day broke, the men fell off, leaving Whiteley alone. He then swam towards a collapsible raft where men were standing but were hesitant to let him on board. The ship's barber, K. Whiteman, witnessed the chaos on deck after the collision, with men fighting and injuring each other. Despite efforts to lower lifeboats and close water-tight compartments, the Titanic eventually succumbed to the disaster. Some passengers, like Mr. Guggenheim, showed bravery and selflessness by prioritizing women and children's safety before their own.|"[""1.

Why were men saved? Some question the rescue of male survivors, yet the testimony reveals a different side. In the midst of the tragedy, the men in frail boats seemed to face a more dreadful fate in the vast sea. Some had to be ordered into the boats by officers. Despite the deep indignation towards the rescue of 210 sailors, many were saved from icy waters after the ship sank. Men of power and influence, accustomed to having their wishes granted, willingly stepped aside during the Titanic disaster. They made way not just for the delicate and refined but also for women from steerage, seeking refuge in America. The heroism displayed that night was not just of the women who boarded the lifeboats but also of the men who chose to stay behind. Confidence in the unsinkable ship led many to their demise, as darkness enveloped the vessel before its tragic end.|"[""1.

"The captain of the Titanic, with a revolver in hand, directed the lifeboats to launch and then, facing the inevitable, ordered each man to save himself. As the ship sank rapidly, the captain, displaying courage and loyalty to duty, prepared to go down with his vessel. Amidst the chaos, the band played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" as a final tribute. Murdock, one of the officers, tragically took his own life as the ship descended into the depths. The scene was one of desperation and tragedy, with the sounds of despair echoing through the night.

Mrs. Widener rowed tirelessly in a lifeboat, even when exhausted seamen needed help. In the same boat, Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Thayer worked heroically to keep it safe. Mrs. Thayer's husband stayed on the Titanic, but she rowed all night, not knowing if her son was safe until they reunited on the Carpathia. Despite the freezing cold, they rowed away from the sinking ship. They saw the Titanic's lights dim and heard it sink. Mrs. Lucien Smith, another hero, helped row and was ready to plug a hole in the boat if needed. These women's courage and strength saved lives during that fateful night.|"['1. What did Mrs. George D.

Mrs. J. J. Brown, a survivor from Denver, Colorado, was in a boat with only three men during a harrowing ordeal. One man rowed, a seaman who was half-frozen and saved at the last minute.

"Late into the night, stories were shared in places like hotels, hospitals, and trains heading to grieving homes. It was a mix of frightening and brave tales, unlike any seen since humans conquered the seas. Over two hundred passengers from the lower decks didn't disembark until 11 o'clock, looking forlorn. Among them was Mrs. Habush, a Syrian bound for Youngstown, Ohio, who had lost her husband and three brothers. Two French boys, dropped into a lifeboat nearly naked from the Titanic, stirred sympathy. Miss Margaret Hays, caring for them, tried in vain to find their family. The boys, named Louis and ""Lump,"" were oblivious to the tragedy, playing happily. Tragically, eleven-month-old Travers Allison was the sole survivor of his family. His parents and sibling perished in the disaster."|"['1.

Major Arthur Peuchen, a survivor from Montreal, witnessed the tragic events on the Titanic. Mrs. Allison, searching for her husband, was directed to the other side of the ship and ended up in a lifeboat. Unfortunately, she was last seen falling from the half-swamped boat. J. W. Allison, a relative, took care of Baby Travers and the nurse upon arrival in New York. The Carpathia, commanded by Captain A. H. Rostron, rescued survivors and was commended for the efficient rescue operation. Arthur Ryerson faced a double tragedy with the loss of his son in an accident. The Ryerson family narrowly escaped being wiped out due to misinformation about their son's plans. The Carpathia swiftly resumed its Mediterranean cruise after the rescue mission, while the injured second Marconi wireless operator was taken to the hospital.

At 2.40 A. M., we spotted a flare on the port bow, assuming it was a ship, and soon after, we saw our first iceberg. I had increased the lookouts as a precaution, aware that the Titanic had hit an iceberg. We navigated through a field of icebergs, altering our course multiple times to avoid them. The weather was clear and calm, providing a beautiful, albeit dark, night. We stopped at 4 A. M., covering the distance in three and a half hours. By then, we had picked up all the lifeboats and accounted for all survivors. The Leyland S. S. California arrived at 8 A. M., and after conferring with Mr. Ismay, we decided to head to New York for provisions and medical attention for the survivors. The passengers, especially the women and children, were understandably distressed, and we aimed to provide them with comfort and care.

The Titanic disaster showcased immense courage and sacrifice. The crew's heroism equaled that of notable passengers like John Jacob Astor and Henry B. Harris. The iceberg collision led to swift actions, with Captain Smith ordering life preservers and lifeboats. Despite the 'women first' rule, many men also boarded the initial lifeboats. Rumors circulated about revolver shots and crew members taking their own lives, but these were debunked. Sadly, some with life preservers still perished, highlighting the inadequate number of lifeboats. The crew believed that if the bulkhead system had held, the tragedy might have been averted.

During the tragic sinking of the Titanic, as the ship descended into the icy waters, chaos ensued. Passengers and crew scrambled into lifeboats, some overcrowded and ill-prepared for the frigid conditions. Amidst the darkness, a steward emerged with three oranges and a green lantern, a beacon of hope for the survivors. As the ship vanished beneath the waves, the green light guided the boats towards the distant Carpathia, a symbol of rescue and salvation. The survivors, shivering in the cold, clung to the hope provided by the green light as they awaited rescue. Eventually, the Carpathia appeared on the horizon, bringing relief and tears of joy to those who had narrowly escaped the tragedy. The survivors, including women from the Titanic's lifeboats, were brought aboard the Carpathia, while some of the Titanic's boats were left adrift due to lack of space.

I went up to the top deck in my dressing gown and found only a few people there, all curious about why the boat had stopped. We saw a card game through the smoking room window and learned about a close encounter with a massive iceberg. As we went back on deck, we noticed a slight tilt and were told to put on life belts. Passengers slowly gathered on deck, assuming it was a precaution. Soon, the order came to get in the lifeboats. Women boarded first, some refusing to leave their husbands. The boats were lowered as officers gave instructions. There was no panic, only a calm realization of the danger. As we descended in the lifeboat, a moment of anxiety arose as we neared the ship's churning exhaust. With no crew member to guide us, a stoker had to figure out how to release the boat from the ropes.|"['1.

"We descended and drifted alongside the ship, the waves pushing us back towards its side. Boat 14, filled with men, descended towards us. ""Stop lowering 14!"" our crew yelled, echoed by the men in Boat 14. Despite the warnings, the boat continued to drop. Just as it was about to crash down on us, a stoker cut the ropes, saving us.

We hurried down to our rooms on C deck, quickly dressing and donning life-preservers and overcoats. Rushing back up on deck, we strolled around, gazing at the sights until the women were directed to assemble on the port side. I bid farewell to my mother on A deck, then joined my father on the starboard side. Unaware of the impending disaster, we roamed A deck, then descended to B deck. Concerned for my mother's safety, we returned to the port side of A deck. While searching, a crowd separated us, and I lost sight of my parents. I joined a new acquaintance, Milton C. Long, observing the boats departing on the starboard side. As the ship listed, people began jumping overboard. Despite considering it, Long urged caution.

Long and I bid farewell and climbed onto the ship's rail. Long asked if I was joining him, to which I replied I would in a moment. Long slid down the ship instead of jumping clear. As I leaped feet first, I was propelled away from the ship by a force. I surfaced facing the ship, witnessing a funnel collapsing nearby. The ship appeared to split in two near the third funnel. After being pulled down and pushed out by a wave, I found myself amidst wreckage. A stoker on an overturned lifeboat helped me up, and soon many men were on board. The ship's stern rose at an angle, then plunged down with people jumping off. We sang hymns, prayed, and awaited rescue as the dawn approached. The wind picked up, making it challenging to balance the boat. The wireless man spotted the Carpathia's lights, offering hope of rescue in a few hours. A whistle signaled for distant boats to approach and rescue us.|"[""1.

It took approximately an hour and a half for the boats to approach. Two boats arrived, with the first taking half of the passengers, while the other took the rest, including myself. Balancing the boat became challenging as some leaned too far. Eventually, we all boarded the crowded boat, and after about half to three-quarters of an hour, we were rescued by the Carpathia. Second Officer Lightoller mistakenly identified J. B. Thayer as being on their overturned boat, when in reality, it was me. James McGough, a buyer for Gimbel Brothers from Philadelphia, shared a vivid account of the tragedy, noting the speed of the boat during the accident and the calmness of survivors until the Carpathia arrived. The ship's crew reassured passengers of safety, prompting them to wear life jackets. Women hesitated to board lifeboats without men, showing bravery in the face of danger.|"['1.

"""You're big enough to pull an oar. Jump into this boat or we'll never be able to get the women off."" I was forced to do so, though I admit that the ship looked a great deal safer to me than any small boat. Our boat was the second off. Forty or more persons were crowded into it, and with myself and members of the crew at the oars, were pulled slowly away. Huge icebergs, larger than the Pennsylvania depot at New York, surrounded us. As we pulled away we could see boat after boat filled and lowered to the waves. Despite the fact that they were new and supposedly in excellent working order, the blocks jammed in many instances, tilting the boats, loaded with people, at varying angles before they reached the water. As the life-boats pulled away the officers ordered the bands to play, and their music did much to quell panic. It was a heart-breaking sight to us tossing in an eggshell three-fourths of a mile away, to see the great ship go down. First she listed to the starboard, on which side the collision had occurred, then she settled slowly but steadily, without hope of remaining afloat.

Since the moment Bruce Ismay's name appeared among the survivors of the Titanic, he faced harsh criticism. Many believed that as the managing director of the White Star Line, he should have stayed on the sinking ship to ensure the safety of others, similar to Major Butt and Captain Smith. Ismay's decision to board a lifeboat with women and children was seen as a lack of heroism. His survival was considered a stain on an otherwise courageous display. It was even suggested that Ismay influenced the Carpathia's captain to delay sharing details of the disaster until reaching New York. Ismay's quick arrangements for the survivors' deportation further fueled suspicions. The crew members' families, who were left in distress, felt neglected by Ismay's failure to provide their names promptly. Southampton was filled with sorrow as families awaited news of their loved ones, with some even succumbing to shock and grief.|"[""1.

The tragic sinking of the Titanic led to immense grief and a focus on the loss of life rather than the financial repercussions initially. The marine insurance brokers suffered their largest financial loss ever, with a policy valued at $5,000,000 but only $3,700,000 insured due to market limitations. The cargo, estimated at $420,000, was insured separately by the shippers. The ship primarily carried high-end passenger goods like laces and wines. The Titanic's sinking also resulted in the loss of around 200,000 registered mail packages. The disaster raised concerns about shipbuilding prioritizing luxury over safety, as highlighted in a prophetic article by Captain Roden. The Carpathia, which rescued survivors, incurred significant costs but sought no reimbursement, emphasizing the importance of aiding those in distress at sea.|['1.

The history of water travel dates back to ancient times when humans used log, skin, and dug-out canoes for inland water travel. The Egyptians depicted boats made of planks moved by oars and sails. The Phoenicians were known for their daring sea voyages, even circumnavigating Africa in 604 B.C. The Romans and Carthaginians used oars for propulsion in the Mediterranean. Portugal and Spain engaged in voyages of discovery, with Columbus sailing to America on small ships. By the nineteenth century, steam-powered ships like the Titanic emerged, revolutionizing naval architecture. The steamship era began in the early 1800s, with Robert Fulton's Clermont being one of the first successful steamboats in 1807, paving the way for modern steamships.|['1.

In 1831, after a twelve-year gap, the Royal William made a steam voyage from Quebec to England, using coal as fuel. The problem of fuel was crucial, as steam engines were not very efficient then. In 1838, the Sirius and the Great Western made history by crossing the Atlantic solely powered by steam. The Sirius had to burn spare spars and rosin due to fuel shortage, while the Great Western had coal to spare. Innovations in shipbuilding followed, such as iron ships and screw propellers. John Ericsson introduced the screw propeller in 1835, later adopted by Isambard Brunel in the Great Britain in 1845. Samuel Cunard's British and Royal Mail Steam Packet Company began regular trips in 1840, revolutionizing transatlantic travel. Early steamships lacked modern comforts, with cramped cabins and limited amenities compared to today's luxury liners.|"['1.

In the mid-19th century, advancements in ocean steamship technology began to emerge. One notable company, the Oceanic Company, later known as the White Star Line, made significant strides in ship-building around 1870. They constructed the Britannic and Germanic, the largest ships of their time, measuring 468 feet long and 35 feet wide. These ships introduced a new design with a focus on length over width, enhancing passenger comfort by centralizing saloons and staterooms. Innovations like the tubular boiler and compound engine improved speed and fuel efficiency. The transition from iron to steel hulls marked a shift towards lighter and more durable vessels. The introduction of steam turbine engines and multiple propellers further revolutionized ship propulsion, setting the stage for future advancements in maritime technology.|"['1.

Submarine signals on ships help detect nearby vessels or shores. These signals involve small tanks with microphones on each side of the vessel, just below the waterline, connected to the bridge. When the vessel nears another ship or shore, sounds from the distant object are picked up by the microphones underwater. Referred to as the ship's ears, these signals help officers determine the location of nearby ships or shores. Lifeboats are designed for rough conditions, focusing on easy launching, strength in rough waters, and buoyancy. Equipped with airtight tanks for safety, they can self-right and empty if overturned. These boats range from 24 to 30 feet, carrying 30 to 60 people, while rafts carry 20 to 40. Metal lifeboats are favored for their durability over wooden ones, being considered superior by the United States Navy. Rafts are also used on large ships where space is limited, with collapsible rafts being a popular choice for their space-saving design.|"['1.

Lewis Nixon, a renowned ship designer, proposes a plan to enhance life-saving measures on ships by suggesting the creation of a pontoon attached to the vessel's rear. This pontoon would consist of separate airtight compartments, with one housing a wireless system, another for water storage, and a third for food supplies. The pontoon would seamlessly blend with the ship's design and could be released easily before the vessel sinks. Mr. Nixon's idea includes installing a gas engine in one of the compartments to keep the wireless system operational even after the ship submerges. Additionally, life-preservers are crucial for safety, with cork-filled jackets being preferred over rubber air-bags due to their durability. Life-buoys, especially the ring type, equipped with lamps for visibility, are essential for rescue operations. The importance of efficient life-saving devices on modern ships cannot be overstated, especially considering potential collisions or disasters at sea.|"[""1.

Steward Crawford shared emotional stories of women refusing to leave without their husbands. Etches denied claims that Mr. Andrews hid the danger and urged women to dress warmly. The committee learned about the lack of safety drills for the crew and the delayed distress signals sent after the collision.
