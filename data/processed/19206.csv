"Chapter 1: The Stormy Morning
It was a stormy morning in May 1572. The fishermen of Westport village near Plymouth gathered in the local pub. They were not discussing the storm, a common topic, but the news that Captain Francis Drake, whose ships were docked in Plymouth, had visited the Squire of Treadwood. The villagers hoped to catch a glimpse of him passing through again. The tales of Drake's exploits on the Spanish Main had stirred their hearts. Many wished to join his crew for the promise of great riches. However, only a few could go, and most were soldiers by trade, not sailors. Captain Drake, accompanied by men of Devon, a county known for its seamanship, had already filled his crew. The villagers longed for the adventure and the chance to best the haughty Spaniards."|"[""1.

"""They can fight, boy, and have fought as well as we could; but, somehow, they cannot stand against us, in those seas. Whether it is that the curse of the poor natives, whom they kill, enslave, and ill-treat in every way, rises against them, and takes away their courage and their nerve; but certain is it that, when our little craft lay alongside their big galleons, fight as they will, the battle is as good as over. Nothing less than four to one, at the very least, has any chance against our buccaneers.""

""Yes, indeed!"" replied the old sailor. ""They tear off their flesh with hot pincers, wrench out their nails, and play all sorts of devil's games; and then, at last, they burn what is left of them in the marketplaces. I have heard fearsome tales, lad; but the Spaniards outwit themselves. Were our men to have fair treatment as prisoners of war, it may be that the Spaniards would often be able to hold their own against us; but the knowledge that, if we are taken, this horrible fate is certain to be ours, makes our men fight with a desperate fury; and never to give in, as long as one is left. This it is that accounts for the wonderful victories which we have gained there. He would be a coward, indeed, who would not fight with thumbscrews and a bonfire behind him.""

The old sailor addressed the court, mentioning the remarkable swimming abilities of a local boy known as The Otter. The boy, son of the village's schoolmaster, was eager to go to sea but was held back by his father. Despite that, The Otter was seen approaching the rough sea, determined to help a ship in distress. With great courage, he swam through the crashing waves towards the wrecked vessel. The crew aboard the ship and the spectators on shore watched in awe as The Otter bravely attempted to secure a line to the ship. Sadly, before the rope could reach the shore, the ship succumbed to the violent sea, breaking apart.

After many attempts, he finally caught the rope. He tied it to the mast and signaled the people on land to pull it. Side by side with the dog, he swam towards the shore. Keeping an eye on the large wave behind him, he dove as it passed overhead, riding the swell towards the shore. There was a tough fight. Sometimes he touched the ground, other times he was dragged back into the sea. Despite almost losing consciousness, he remained calm and pushed forward. By keeping sideways to the waves, he avoided being rolled over. Just as he felt he couldn't go on, a hand grabbed him. The fishermen had bravely entered the surf and rescued him. He asked about the child and the dog, relieved to hear they were safe. Captain Francis Drake praised him, promising a place on his crew for the next voyage. His father, the village teacher, was proud but reminded him to be cautious.|"['1.

"""I would not have you count too much upon that,"" the teacher said, dryly. ""It is likely he may never return from this adventure. And if he does, he will have had enough of fighting the Spaniards."" The boy asked the next morning, ""Father, why do English and Spanish sailors fight in the West Indies when our countries are at peace?"" The teacher replied, ""The law does not explain such conflicts. It seems like piracy. But as the country supports it, I won't question it."" The teacher continued, ""You are not inclined towards learning. Your mother wanted you to be a clerk, but that's not your path. Don't rely too much on this promise; it may take years.""

In the past, the Spaniards ruled South America and the West Indies. They had large towns and fleets to transport treasure to Spain. Despite this, Captain Drake and his crew, inspired by past successes, set sail to challenge the Spaniards. England feared Spanish influence due to their support of Popery. The English viewed the Spaniards as enemies of their country, religion, and humanity. The sailors sought revenge for the cruelty inflicted on the Indians and their fallen comrades. Driven by a desire for plunder and a sense of duty, they embarked on a perilous journey. Amid cheers, the boats set off, carrying brave men like Ned Hearne, eager to fight for their beliefs and dreams of riches in the mysterious western lands.|"['1.

John Holyoake, the ship's sailing master, agreed to let Ned join the crew. In those days, the sailing master was the navigator, while the captain was often a soldier who lacked seamanship skills. The sailors were a fine group, experienced and robust, ready for any challenge. Ned, though new to long voyages, felt at ease due to his fishing boat experience. Assigned duties, he quickly adapted to ship life. As the ship set sail under Admiral Francis Drake, Ned worked alongside three other boys. Despite initial apprehensions, they found their tasks manageable and even chuckled at the orders and kicks they received. Ned eagerly learned the ship's ropes and sails, impressing the master with his dedication. The boys shared a camaraderie, dreaming of glory on their voyage to the West Indies. Despite a few brutal crew members like Giles Taunton, the boys stood united, using their strength to protect one another.|"[""1.

They quickly formed a defensive alliance against their common oppressors. All four were spirited lads, sons of affluent men in Devon who had supported Captain Drake's ventures. They disliked the abuse they endured occasionally. One day, they huddled by the bowsprit, contemplating their options. Gerald Summers, the oldest, suggested confronting Captain Drake about the mistreatment. However, they decided it would tarnish their reputation and opted to endure the abuse rather than be labeled as informants. They agreed that unity was key. The next day, when Reuben Gale struck Giles with a broom, the boys swiftly retaliated, overpowering him. Despite Giles' threats of revenge, the crew refrained from intervening, supporting the boys' actions. This incident marked a turning point in their journey, as they stood up against mistreatment and earned the respect of the crew.|"['1.

As time passed, the heat on the ship increased, making it difficult for many crew members to sleep below deck due to poor ventilation. The boys, feeling the discomfort of the heat and confinement, decided to sleep in a small boat towed behind the ship. However, when they woke up, they found themselves adrift in the ocean, separated from the ship. They anxiously watched as the ship sailed away, missing them. Despite their fears, they held onto hope that the ship would return for them. After enduring extreme heat and thirst, the boys were eventually rescued by the ship Pacha. Although Captain Francis was upset about the delay, he understood the boys had learned their lesson. They were given food and drink, then called to the captain's cabin to explain how they ended up adrift.

When the ship spotted land at the end of July, the crew and the four boys were overjoyed. They had been at sea for so long and were eager to see the green forests they had heard about. Although they were still far from their intended destination, they cruised along the coast cautiously, fearing that news of their arrival might reach the Spaniards. They finally anchored in a bay near some uninhabited islands. Natives, initially wary due to the cruel reputation of the Spaniards, cautiously approached the ship after the crew signaled their peaceful intentions. These indigenous people, with their copper skin and colorful feather headdresses, brought baskets of exotic fruits in exchange for trinkets from the ship. The boys, along with the rest of the crew, relished the opportunity to taste these unfamiliar fruits, savoring pineapples, bananas, and other delicious treats after their long journey.|"[""1.

Sailing on, the crew anchored at Port Pheasant, named by Captain Drake. They planned to rest and assemble the pinnaces. A boat checked for Spaniards, finding a lead plate warning of betrayal. Captain Drake wished he had arrived earlier to meet John Garrett, a friend. To be safe, they built a fort to unload supplies. The crew cleared land for three days, forming a wall of trees. The boys explored the woods, amazed by the butterflies, flowers, and snakes. They admired the colorful birds, mistaking them for butterflies.

Captain Francis, a valiant leader, distanced himself from the inhumane slave trade after facing resistance from natives while acquiring slaves. Despite the promise of plentiful slaves, Captain Hawkins faced a fierce battle to assist a king at war. The risky endeavor resulted in grumbling among the crew as they viewed gains from such ventures as morally questionable. The expedition, laden with captured slaves, steered towards the West Indies. Forced trade at Rio de Hacha showcased the admiral's assertiveness. A storm led to capturing ships, and a standoff with the Viceroy of Mexico tested Hawkins' mettle. Despite treacherous Spanish schemes, the English crew stood their ground, defending their ships with unwavering courage.|"['1.

Our ship faced a dire situation. The Jesus, a Spanish vessel, launched a fierce attack, sinking one of our ships. Amidst the chaos, we fought back fiercely. The battle was intense, with Spanish forts bombarding us from the shore. Despite the odds, we held our ground. However, when the Jesus signaled distress, our captain made a bold move to rescue them. As the Jesus sank, we managed to save some of their crew. But the Spaniards, fearing our bravery, set fire to their own ships and sent them towards us. In the chaos, we fled, feeling guilty for leaving some behind. The mistreatment of the captives fueled anger, and though not declaring war, Queen Elizabeth supported those seeking vengeance against Spain.

A cheer erupted from the crew of the Swanne and the Pacha, drawn to the commotion. Ned swiftly scaled a rope onto the ship, greeted with cheers and approval. Captain John Drake praised him, acknowledging his bravery in saving a comrade. Ned humbly downplayed his act, admitting he learned from the fearless natives. The bond between the boys strengthened, earning Ned respect from the sailors. The next day, the Isle of Wight, led by Captain James Rause, arrived, bringing a captured Spanish caravel and shallop. The crews united under Captain Drake’s leadership, with plans to sail to Nombre de Dios. At the Isle of Pines, Ned and Reuben were ambushed by natives, mistaken for Spaniards. The misunderstanding was cleared, and the friendly natives guided them back to the shore, where Captain Drake reunited with old acquaintances among the Cameroons.|"['1.

After much discussion, Captain Drake decided to land the natives on the Isthmus of Darien to prepare for his arrival. Thirty natives were quickly loaded onto boats to cross to the mainland. Upon approaching the port of Nombre de Dios in the early morning, they encountered a small unprepared Spanish ship loaded with Canary wine. The English boarded the ship without resistance from the sleeping crew. Hearing oars in the distance, Captain Drake ordered a pursuit to prevent the town from being alerted. The English managed to catch the boat and towed the crew back to their ship. They rowed to the town's battery and climbed over the wall undetected. Captain Drake divided his men into three groups to make a grand entrance at the marketplace, where they faced initial resistance from the Spaniards. The English retaliated with arrows, taking control of the town and advancing towards the Treasury to seize the treasure. Captain Drake warned his men to stay disciplined and threatened to burn the town if met with further resistance.|"['1.

The alarm spread through the town as the English attacked to plunder the public treasuries. The firing ceased, and the townsmen, realizing the threat to their city, held back. The English seized a group of Spaniards who led them to the governor's house full of riches. Amidst the silk hangings and gold and silver vessels, the English marveled at the wealth. A pile of silver bars amazed them, but Captain Drake urged them to the Treasury House, promising even more gold and precious stones. As the Spaniards regrouped to defend their city, Captain Francis, wounded and weak, fell, causing a momentary panic among the men. Ignoring the treasure, they carried their fallen captain to safety, leaving behind the vast riches. The crew regrouped on an island, relieved that Captain Drake's wound was not life-threatening, and they found solace in their survival, despite missing out on immense wealth.|"['1.

Upon the second day after their arrival at the Isle of Victuals, they saw a boat rowing out from the direction of Nombre de Dios. As they knew that there was no fleet in that harbor which would venture to attack them, the English had no fear of the approaching boat; although, indeed, they wondered much what message could have been sent them. On board the boat was an hidalgo, or Spanish noble, who was rowed by four negroes. He said that he had come from the mainland to make inquiries as to the gallant men who had performed so great a feat, and that he cherished no malice, whatever, against them. He wished to know whether the Captain Drake who commanded them was the same who had been there before, and especially did he inquire whether the arrows used by the English were poisoned; for, he said, great fear and alarm reigned in the town, many believing that all who had been struck by the English shafts would certainly die. Then the hidalgo inquired why the English had so suddenly retreated from the town, when it was in their hands, and why they had abstained from carrying off the three hundred and sixty tons of silver which lay at the governor's house, and the still greater value of gold in the treasure house--the gold, indeed, being far more valuable than the silver, insomuch as it was more portable.

The crew aboard the Swanne noticed the ship was sitting lower in the water than usual. Despite their initial disbelief, they discovered a severe leak. Efforts to pump out the water failed, and the ship was deemed unsalvageable. The crew and goods were transferred to another vessel before the Swanne sank. The loss was a blow to the crew, who had a deep attachment to their ship. The admiral's decision to keep the sinking a secret prevented a loss of morale among the crew. The crew then filled the Pacha with supplies and set out on pinnaces to capture another ship. The crew rested in the Gulf of Darien before resuming their pursuit of passing ships. A daring attack on a Spanish galleon ensued, showcasing the English buccaneers' fearless and fierce fighting spirit.|"['1.

"The intense fighting spirit of the English was the key to their victory over the outnumbered Spaniards. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the English crew, led by Captain Drake, charged at the Spaniards with a ferocity that caused the larger force to retreat. The Spaniards, though initially brave, were overwhelmed by the relentless attack of the English, armed with heavy axes and driven by their fury. The Spanish officers' attempts to rally their men failed, and soon they were forced to flee or surrender.

After securing the ship, Captain Drake ordered the prisoners, including a young Spanish lady, to be disarmed and sent away in boats to prevent any looting. When the young lady fell overboard in panic, Ned, one of the crew members, bravely rescued her from the sea. Captain Drake ensured her safety and comfort, providing her with supplies for the journey back to land.

The Spanish prisoners were later returned to shore, and the English crew, under Captain Drake's command, continued their voyage, leaving behind a defeated but grateful Spanish crew."|"[""1.

The ship was thoroughly searched and found to hold a great deal of goods, but lacking the gold and silver they sought, having come from Europe. They consoled themselves knowing the ship chased earlier was likely filled with riches. Indeed, they found a second ship brimming with gold and silver at their rendezvous, transferring the cargo and setting the first ship ablaze. Though they captured several more ships, they ceased attacking European vessels to avoid drawing unwanted attention. The crew enjoyed plenty of luxuries and fine wines, with Captain Drake allowing moderate revelry. Concerned about retaliation, Drake avoided capturing ships leaving Darien, as tales of their exploits could unite Spanish forces. Despite their successes, illness struck the crew, claiming lives including Captain John Drake in a battle with a Spanish ship. Determined to press on, Captain Drake set out for Panama with a diminished crew, facing challenges but remaining resolute in their pursuit of treasure.|"['1.

As they journeyed, a Simeroon guide led the admiral to a tall tree with steps carved into it. The admiral climbed to the top and was amazed to see both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Drake became the first Englishman to witness this sight, a view already familiar to the Spaniards since 1513. Despite being disappointed by the Spaniards capturing their gold, they prepared to sail back. Unexpectedly, seven Spanish ships approached the coast, causing concern. Captain Drake encouraged his men, pointing out the resilient lads. He proposed building a raft to find their missing pinnace. After a perilous journey, they spotted the pinnace and reunited with their comrades. Grateful for their escape, they sailed home, avoiding the Spanish ships.|['1.

It was time for the adventurers to head back to England. Their group of eighty men had decreased to fifty, many of whom were unwell. Despite not capturing the treasures of Nombre de Dios and Carthagena, they had amassed wealth. The Spaniards were preparing to crush them, and fifty men couldn't face a fleet. Eager to return home, they prepared for the voyage with joy. Captain Drake decided to keep the best ships close to mislead the Spaniards. As a storm approached, they braced for impact. The hurricane hit with a deafening roar, causing the ship to lurch. The crew fought to keep the vessel afloat as giant waves crashed around them. The storm raged for twenty-four hours, testing their resolve. As the wind calmed, hope rose until a sailor's warning shattered it.|"['1.

Upon reaching a higher spot, they spotted a big town by a bay. Surprised, they sat down out of sight, pondering their next move. Ned suggested hiding in the mountains and woods near the town to find food and wait till dark. They rested in a grove until nightfall, awakening to a calm moonlit night. Using the town's lights as a guide, they foraged for food in plantations. They settled near a noble house, observing a man and a lady who visited daily.

Their triumph, however, exceeded their hopes. Only an hour or two after they stationed themselves, shortly after sunrise, they spotted the young lady they longed to see strolling down the path. Accompanied by a black girl carrying books and other items, the young lady reached the arbor. Once there, the black girl placed the items down and left the young lady to enjoy the garden. The black girl hurried back with a tray of refreshments, setting it on the table before leaving at the lady's request. Alone, Ned cautiously approached the arbor, feeling self-conscious about his appearance. He explained in broken Spanish about their shipwreck and the loss of their comrades, seeking help. The young lady, despite the language barrier, showed kindness and willingness to assist. She revealed to the boys that hiding them would be challenging due to gossipy servants and the risk of exposure to the Inquisition.

The man explained that hiding the two English boys was crucial due to the danger they faced from the Inquisition and the enraged population. He suggested using a gardener's hut, ensuring secrecy and the boys' safety. The plan involved the boys staying hidden during the day and receiving food and supplies. With the help of a loyal servant named David, the boys were provided with necessary items and a comfortable setup in the hut.

The boys enjoyed a hearty supper and settled into hammocks for a restful sleep. The next day, Donna Anna visited, bringing books, a Spanish dictionary, and grammar to help them learn the language. Senor Sagasta assured them of an escape plan once an English ship arrived. However, rumors spread about two white men in the area, prompting a reward for their capture. To avoid detection, the boys were advised to seek refuge in the mountains. An old woman known for assisting runaways was identified as a potential guide.

David expressed concern over a woman who remained silent under pressure, willing to die rather than betray a secret. Donna Anna bid farewell to the boys, considering Ned her savior. Don Sagasta equipped them with pistols, swords, provisions, and money. He promised to aid them in case of danger. The boys, led by David, headed to an Indian woman's hut. The old woman, amazed by the Englishmen's reputation, shared her past suffering at the hands of the Spaniards. She guided them to the refuge of her people, hoping the boys could help them resist the Spanish. The boys set off with the guide into the night, walking tirelessly through darkness until they reached a mountain, where the guide paused, unable to continue.|"['1.

The boys were surprised when their guide suddenly stopped, leaving them breathless from the quick pace he had set. Despite their inability to communicate with him due to the language barrier, Gerald speculated that the guide might be tired or unsure of the exact location to meet the band. As night fell, the boys fell asleep, only to be woken by the Indian boy at daybreak. He led them up a steep path to a hill's summit. There, he kindled a fire using dry sticks and leaves, signaling to others with smoke. The view from the hilltop was breathtaking, with hills, plantations, villages, and the vast sea in sight. The boys were welcomed by natives and negroes, with the chief expressing joy at their arrival. The boys, able to converse in Spanish, recounted their journey, and were warmly received by the group.|"['1.

The boys promised to help the tribe if the Spaniards attacked, as the English were allies to the oppressed. They explored deeper into the forest, finding huts of runaway slaves. They learned the natives' language and lived off roots, fruit, and yams. The boys admired the natives' skill in hunting birds with darts and shooting accurately with bows and arrows. They advised the natives to build strong defenses against the Spaniards. The boys joined the natives to visit other groups of runaways, finding hundreds with about fifty escaped slaves. The runaways vowed to fight the Spaniards rather than be captured. The boys heard distant barking dogs, signaling the Spaniards' approach. A panting and alarmed runaway arrived, warning of the danger.|"[""1.

Ned spoke to the group of men, suggesting they take a stand against the Spaniards to protect their territory. The men were hesitant due to their fear of the Spaniards but were encouraged by the English boys' determination. They quickly gathered their weapons and prepared to defend their position in a narrow valley. As the Spaniards approached, the men unleashed a barrage of stones, causing chaos among the enemy. Despite the Spaniards' attempt to advance, the men stood their ground, with Ned and Gerald leading the defense. The unexpected resistance from the natives, along with accurate shots from the English boys, caused the Spaniards to hesitate. In a bold move, Ned shouted in English, further intimidating the invaders.|"['1.

The words were likely not understood by any of the Spaniards, but they knew it wasn't Spanish or Indian. The presence of English completely stunned them. They hesitated, then slowly started retreating. This emboldened the negroes who shouted, advanced, and attacked with arrows and stones, turning the retreat into a flight. The negroes were ready for anything, discarding their weapons and charging at the Spaniards. Despite the Spaniards' better weapons and brave defense, many were beaten and killed by the negroes' clubs and spears. Just when things seemed dire, reinforcements arrived. The men brought horses and bloodhounds, aiding their friends. The fierce battle continued, with the boys leading the charge. The conflict ended with the Spaniards defeated, some killed, and others escaping. The boys instructed the negroes to collect the fallen enemies' weapons and bury their bodies. They knew the brutal nature of the conflict between the black and white sides. The boys warned of potential future attacks and the need for unity, discipline, and courage to succeed.

The plan was to live freely and without disturbance. They decided that the vulnerable should hide in the mountains while the rest would stay to face the enemy. The boys, seen as heroes, urged the group to organize and train. They knew the Spaniards would return in greater numbers. The weapons left by the Spaniards were distributed among the group. They formed companies for training and defense. After weeks of preparation, a large group of Spaniards was spotted. The group planned to avoid direct confrontation, using guerrilla tactics instead.

Three hounds led the way with their noses to the ground, baying deeply. They reached a trap, and despite warnings, hurried into a gallery. The leaders hesitated, then shouted to stop, but the hounds, driven by scent, continued. As the last hound entered, the structure collapsed, trapping them. The Spaniards were shocked by this new cunning. The pursuit halted, guides vanished, and leaders strategized. They headed to the valley of the prior conflict but found only a cairn with a cross and Spanish inscription, sparking discussions. The soldiers, wary of the English leaders, prepared for potential ambushes. They planned to tire out the natives by playing a waiting game, using tactics to wear them down while avoiding direct confrontation.|"['1.

Confused, troubled, and somewhat amazed by the new and mysterious strategies, the two groups met at dusk in a clear space. They set up camp, cut branches for shelter, and shared their provisions. A stream flowed nearby as the exhausted soldiers lay down, guarded by sentries. The appearance of the troops had changed since entering the forest. Initially eager for battle, they now faced a well-prepared enemy. Throughout the night, the air echoed with strange sounds and unseen foes launched arrows at them. Despite firing back, the Spaniards couldn't locate their attackers. At dawn, disheartened but hopeful, they ventured into the woods, finding traces of the enemy but no visible threat. After a challenging retreat, they decided to abandon the pursuit, realizing the formidable tactics of their hidden adversaries.|"['1.

Plans were discussed among the group for launching attacks on the Spanish plantations at night from the forest. While this strategy offered better chances of success, the boys were concerned about potential violence and the lack of mercy towards the Spaniards. They argued against this proposal, suggesting that staying hidden in the forest might keep the Spaniards at bay. They warned that offensive actions could lead to a full-scale retaliation from the Spaniards, potentially endangering their lives. The boys believed that attacking the Spaniards would only be justified if the Spaniards organized fresh expeditions. They decided to take action after a brutal incident where a fugitive and an old woman were burned alive by the Spaniards. Led by Ned, a group of a hundred and fifty individuals, including natives and slaves, launched a retaliatory attack on the military governor's mansion. The group followed strict rules of engagement, sparing defenseless individuals and those who surrendered. The attack resulted in a fierce battle between the Spanish guards and the group, with the governor himself facing off against the boys. Despite the governor's refusal to surrender, the boys managed to overpower him and spare his life.|"['1.

"In a flash, the two boys sprang into action, seizing the man's sword from him. The crowd of men, with shouts of victory, charged forward with drawn swords, but the boys gestured firmly, holding their ground in front of their captive. ""Sir, witness the power of these men you've hunted. Take heed and spread the word. Leave us be, and we'll do the same. We vow no harm if left alone.

The blow struck by the negroes on Hispaniola caused great fear. Some wanted to attack them, but wiser heads prevailed. The island was at their mercy, and revenge wouldn't make up for the damage. Plans to lure the runaways failed. In the mountains, the rebels grew stronger, farming and building shelters. Ned warned against more runaways joining, fearing Spanish retaliation. A truce held between the Spaniards and the rebels. Troops amassed to crush the rebellion. The rebels had secret messengers and prepared for the Spanish assault.

At one point in particular, a steep cliff overlooked the forest where a secure enclosure for the animals was constructed using tree trunks. The roof was strong enough to shield from bullets and rocks. The Spaniards were unlikely to attack from above due to the challenging ascent. The boys, prepared for retaliation, ignited fires across the plain, causing chaos among the Spanish forces. The boys strategically infiltrated the town, setting fires and seizing key locations. Despite minimal casualties, they inflicted significant damage. The destruction of property and surprise attacks left the Spaniards stunned.

The majority of the force now had European weapons. The black soldiers had muskets, while the natives kept their bows, all armed with pikes and spears. The Spaniards had a defensive advantage due to armor, but the natives could move more freely. The scouts reported that 1500 Spaniards split into six groups, each with bloodhounds and wolfhounds. The natives feared these dogs. Ned and Gerald tried to reassure them, but the fear was deep-rooted. The plan was to defend strategic points and retreat when necessary. The first stand was at a gorge mouth, where rocks and a stream provided cover. The Spaniards approached cautiously, but an ambush of musket fire and falling stones forced them back. The Spanish commander then ordered a direct attack on the barricade.|"['1.

With determination, the Spanish troops advanced towards the gorge's mouth. Arrows rained down on them from above, countered by their musketeers and bowmen. The defenders, all natives, had chosen courageous negroes to guard the ravine. The firearms lacked precision, but the Spaniards pushed forward. Stones from above caused fear but little harm. The attackers, using rocks and bushes for cover, approached the barricade. Climbing the barricade was tough, especially with bullets raining down. The defenders, well-protected, fired from the top. The Spaniards, facing heavy losses, retreated. The Spanish troops returned with bundles of grass, igniting a fire to clear the barricade. With the rocks exposed, the Spaniards made another attempt.

The defenders, a mix of negroes and natives, expertly repelled the Spanish assault on their forest stronghold. The Spaniards, heavily armed but disoriented, were no match for the agile and coordinated defense. The defenders swiftly pushed back the attackers, inflicting heavy casualties. Despite their success, the defenders knew they couldn't hold the position indefinitely. They strategically retreated, leaving behind a few to mislead the enemy. As the Spaniards regrouped and scouted the area, the defenders consolidated their forces at a central fortress. The Spaniards, determined to root out their elusive foes, meticulously combed through the forest. Eventually, they discovered the hidden path leading to the defenders' stronghold.

A council was held to discuss the challenging task of attacking a well-defended position. The reports from scouts revealed the natural strength of the location, making a direct assault seem risky. Defenders strategically barricaded key points on the path, ready to repel any intruders. The attackers cautiously advanced along the narrow path, turning a corner where they were met with a barrage of gunfire from the defenders. Despite losing some of their men, the attackers managed to gain a foothold around the corner but were met with a well-prepared barricade covered in thorny branches. The defenders, led by the boys, held their ground and repelled the attack, causing the Spaniards to retreat after suffering heavy casualties. Rocks tumbled down the mountain, causing chaos but missing the defenders due to their strategic positioning.|"['1.

From the valley below, a steady fire was kept up, but it did not harm the defenders above. When the Spaniards retreated, only three of the defenders were injured, hit by pistol balls. The defenders, including the natives and the negroes, were pleased with their successful defense. They were confident they could hold out as long as their provisions lasted. Water was plentiful from a small stream on the hill. They had collected yams, bananas, and sheep to last five weeks. The Spaniards, unable to breach the defense, decided to starve them out. After five weeks, the defenders escaped using a hidden path up the cliff. They descended on the other side and disappeared into the forest. They feasted on supplies and crops, ten miles away, before executing their plan to surprise the town.|"['1.

The plan was executed successfully. The guards at the governor's house were quickly overpowered, and all inside were captured. While some men defended themselves, Gerald and Ned ensured minimal casualties. The attack on the barracks resulted in significant harm to the soldiers, who were taken by surprise and offered feeble resistance. As the town lit up with fires from the government magazines, chaos ensued with frightened inhabitants and the sound of gunfire. The group of rebels then retreated into the forest, holding the governor and his sons captive. Negotiations ensued, and terms were proposed to avoid further conflict. After much deliberation, the pacifist approach prevailed, leading to a peaceful resolution between the rebels and the Spanish forces.|"[""1.

A group, including a military officer, a religious leader, and a prominent merchant, went to the forest to negotiate with the native inhabitants. They agreed that the forest dwellers could live freely and farm near the forest edge. Spaniards were not allowed to enter without permission. Runaways were a contentious issue, but it was decided that each case would be investigated. A treaty was signed by both parties. Ned and Gerald warned the forest people to uphold the treaty and be prepared for potential conflict. Months passed peacefully, with the natives avoiding trouble if left alone. Kind treatment kept slaves from fleeing to the mountains. The boys learned about an English ship, but missed the chance to join it. Sadly, news arrived that Captain Oxenford's expedition had met a tragic end.|"['1.

Captain Oxenford, equipped with a 140-ton sloop, sailed to Darien and then trekked inland guided by natives. They built a boat, navigated a river to Panama Bay, and seized a barque with gold from Quito. Encouraged, they captured another barque with silver. Seeking pearls, they returned to the river mouth, but the delay proved fatal. Spanish forces led by Captain Ortuga pursued them. A surprise attack ensued, resulting in casualties. The Spaniards found their loot and captured most of the crew. Oxenford and a few survivors fled but were later captured and executed, except for five boys spared in Panama. The missteps and delays led to their downfall, emphasizing the risks of piracy and the consequences of underestimating opponents.|"['1.

The natives were amazed. They dropped the hot meat in surprise, but soon tasted it cautiously. After enjoying the food, they helped build a massive bonfire, which left them in awe. The boys signaled to leave their inferior bows and arrows behind. The tall, well-built natives led the way to their village, nestled at the base of high hills. The villagers greeted them with astonishment and reverence. The huts were made of sticks and animal skins. The chief invited the boys into his hut, offering them skins to rest on. The boys then started a fire, impressing the villagers. Everyone gathered around the fire, enjoying the warmth and sharing food cooked over the flames.

The boys calmed the crowd and began roasting meat. Eager to taste the new dish, the villagers received bits of meat with excitement. An incident occurred when embers scattered, causing burns. Ned quickly helped, soothing the injured man. Using leaves and deer hide, Ned bandaged the burn. The boys showed the chief how to maintain the fire, impressing the villagers. The next day, Ned cooked yams in hot water using stones, amazing the locals. They then taught the villagers to cook, resulting in a feast. The boys agreed to join a hunting trip for more meat.|"['1.

During the feast, the boys wandered off with Indian bows and arrows. These bows were shorter and easier to pull. The boys, skilled in bow making, cut and spliced the bows to create stronger ones. They also made longer arrows. The boys surprised the natives with their new weapons, which could shoot far and accurately. The next day, during a hunt, the boys amazed the Indians with their superior archery skills. The chief and others tried but failed to string the English bows, while the boys effortlessly did so. The boys then shot arrows accurately at a tree from a great distance. The Indians were astonished by the boys' shooting abilities.

A group of young boys and native Indians set out to hunt deer. The Indians strategically positioned themselves upwind from the deer, while the boys hid nearby. As the herd approached, the boys and the Indians readied their bows. The boys, following the English archers' tradition, shot their arrows precisely, taking down several deer. The Indians were amazed by the boys' shooting skills and shared their admiration. Later, the boys and the Indians bonded over crafting clothes from deer skins. The boys learned the Indian language and customs, fostering a growing friendship.

The boys quickly joined the native hunter and admired his skill. Carrying the carcasses, they followed him back to camp. The next day, Ned and Tom spotted ostriches in the distance and called the hunter to join them. He put on an ostrich skin and mimicked the bird's movements, amusing the boys. Together, they hid and watched the hunter approach the ostriches. With a swift shot, the hunter brought down one ostrich, impressing the boys. They collected feathers and parts of the bird before returning to camp. As they prepared to leave the village, the chief and tribe expressed sadness at their departure, fearing for their safety. The chief pleaded for them to stay, highlighting the importance of their presence in keeping the fires lit.

Now, he demonstrated how to transport fire. By carrying two large flaming pieces of wood crossed so the burning parts touched, he revealed how fire could be sustained for long periods. If two branches were taken from each fire, fire could be maintained indefinitely. In case of losing fire, he taught how to recover it through friction. Using a pointed stick spun rapidly by a bowstring, smoke arose, followed by sparks that ignited dry fungus. The natives, amazed, learned to create fire. Grateful, they decided to accompany the visitors for safety. The visitors improved their bows, ensuring they could defend themselves. The next day, the chief and warriors joined them, equipped for the journey with sleds and supplies. The village bid them farewell with cheers and well-wishes.|['1.

For the initial days, the group journeyed without any notable events. They easily hunted for food and rested by streams at night. But at their last stop, the chief, sensing a change in territory, sent scouts out at night. The following day, they stayed close together, cautious of their surroundings. The chief, noticing signs of other people, lit a large fire to signal peace. Soon, a group of curious individuals approached, amazed by the fire. The chief shared the fire's benefits, and the newcomers were fascinated. They spent two days together, sharing stories and food. Eventually, the group decided to guide the boys to the next tribe.

After months of travel, Ned and Tom had learned to communicate with the natives, understanding their simple language and gestures. As they journeyed westward, the terrain grew more rugged, transitioning from hills to mountains. The locals warned them of fierce tribes beyond the mountains, possibly influenced by the Spaniards. Despite the challenges ahead, Ned and Tom pressed on, eager to reach the other side. They bid farewell to their companions and ventured into the valley, surrounded by breathtaking scenery and diverse wildlife. The heat was intense, but they found relief in a stream at the valley's end. Feeling like true natives after months of immersion, they faced the daunting task of convincing the people on the other side of the mountains that they were not enemies but English travelers.|"['1.

Ned and Tom found themselves in a perilous situation as they were ambushed by a group of natives beyond the mountains. Ned, alert and watchful, knew they were in grave danger. The natives, mistaken them for Spaniards, attacked with arrows and clubs. Despite a valiant effort, Ned and Tom were overpowered and captured. The natives, smaller and fairer than those they knew, tied them up and began roasting their food. Ned feared they would meet a gruesome fate, reflecting on the cruelty inflicted by the Spaniards on the natives.

Three days passed, and on the fourth day, a smaller group of natives joined them. That evening, the boys realized their fate was at a turning point. A large fire was lit with bundles of wood, and the natives sat around it solemnly. The boys were brought forward by four armed natives with spears, beginning a trial. Even though the boys couldn't understand the language, they could sense the emotion in the speeches. Each native spoke of the brutal treatment they endured - showing scars, missing limbs, and recounting tales of violence and slavery. As the anger and tension rose, Ned reflected on their own lives and the hope for forgiveness. Tom was tied to a tree, while Ned was left by the fire. The natives prepared a fire that would slowly roast Tom to death, marking a grim and uncertain fate for the boys.|"[""1.

Ned watched as his friend faced a grim fate, desperate to help. Unable to free himself, he had a daring idea. In a bold move, he grabbed his hidden powder flask and hurled it into the fire, causing a massive explosion. Chaos erupted, giving them a chance to escape. The boys quickly gathered weapons, set them ablaze, and fled up the mountain. Battling cold winds, they reached a plateau at dawn, where the sun warmed them.

Three hours later, they suddenly emerged from a part where the hills approached nearer on either side than they had done during the day's walk. A mighty landscape opened before and below them. The boys shouted with joy, dropping to their knees in thanks to God. Far away in the distance was a dark, level blue line, signaling the ocean. Ned warned about the vast forest ahead, home to hostile natives. As they hunted, a gigantic snake attacked Ned, coiling around him. Tom swiftly cut off the snake's tail, saving Ned's life. After the intense encounter, Ned regained consciousness, relieved that no serious harm had been done. The boys continued their journey, knowing they had narrowly escaped a dangerous situation.|"['1.

It was a tough decision for both boys to consider telling a lie. This is a topic that can lead to differing opinions. Some believe that lying is never acceptable, while others argue that deceit can be justified in certain situations, like during war or to save lives without causing harm. After much hesitation, the boys agreed to hide their true identity under false pretenses. Ned was initially hesitant, but Tom provided historical examples to support their decision. The boys decided that if needed, they would pretend to be true Catholics to maintain their cover. When the Spanish escort captain saw the boys, he was astonished by their appearance and initially mistook them for savages. After clarifying the situation, the captain welcomed the boys and offered them protection on their journey to the coast, where they hoped to learn more about their countrymen.

The boys, who had lived among the Indians for six months, were shocked by what they saw. They struggled to hide their anger and horror, knowing it would only cause trouble. They pretended to be uncivilized to avoid suspicion from the Spaniards. As they journeyed to the coast with an escort and mules carrying silver, they felt relieved from the fear of attacks. At Arica, they worried about a thorough examination. The Spaniards were surprised by their fair skin and light hair. The boys were eager to ask about English ships but knew it would raise suspicion. They were assigned to the barracks, where they pretended to be clumsy in military exercises. Despite their fears, they found camaraderie with the soldiers and practiced archery skillfully.|['1.

The Spaniards were amazed by the boys' shooting skills, attributing it to Ned's practice with the Indians. The Spanish officers compared their accuracy to English archers and noted their resemblance to the heretic English. The captain explained that the boys were not a tribe but a white people like themselves. The conversation shifted to the sea robbers who troubled the coast, and Ned questioned why the King of Spain did not eliminate them. The Spaniards praised their bravery on land but acknowledged their inferiority at sea. The boys, Ned and Tom, saved a ship in distress during a storm, revealing their true identity to the onlookers.

Finally, they approached the ship and pulled it close to shore after the captain, crew, and a passenger jumped into the sea. The boys rescued them and headed back to land.

The English boys found themselves in a precarious situation in a foreign land. Initially hailed as heroes for their brave rescue of Spaniards, they soon faced pressure to abandon their nationality and embrace Spanish citizenship. The governor, while offering them good treatment, also hinted that their refusal could lead to imprisonment and worse treatment. The boys, staunch in their English roots, rejected attempts to convert them to Catholicism, despite threats from the priests. The specter of the Inquisition loomed large, with tales of brutal punishments for defiance haunting their thoughts. In a time of religious intolerance and severe laws, the boys grappled with the choice of staying and risking persecution or fleeing to the mountains for safety among the natives.

They stayed, hoping for Drake's fleet, but it seemed to have failed in reaching them. Nearly six months had passed since they were left on the coast. The fleet had faced storms and delays, causing the young men to linger. A Spanish gentleman befriended them, offering help against the Inquisition. The governor informed them they were free to leave for a ship to their home country. The young men, guarded by officials, realized the seriousness of the situation.

Late in the evening, the soldiers noticed two men being escorted by the black-clad Inquisition guard. The soldiers, recognizing their comrades, raised their voices in protest against the seizure. Despite the darkness, they spoke out loudly, unafraid of being recognized. Onlookers were divided in their reactions. Some joined the soldiers, while others retreated into their homes to avoid involvement. The soldiers, though threatening, did not resort to violence. The young men, showing no resistance, were taken aboard a vessel bound for Lima. Two days into their journey, they noticed a faster sailing craft passing by. Upon reaching Lima, a crowd greeted them with hostility. The prisoners were taken to a monastery-like building where they were provided with basic necessities. Ned and his companion refrained from speaking freely, knowing they were being monitored. They spent the night in prayer and youthful resilience, ready to face the trials ahead.

At the end of the room, three men sat at a table, all dressed in black. They were engrossed in writing and paid no attention to the attendants standing by the boys. The inquisitor accused Edward Hearne and Thomas Tressilis, English sailors, of heresy and refusing the teachings of the church. The boys admitted to being Protestants and asked to remain true to their beliefs. The inquisitor warned them of dire consequences if they did not convert. The boys were taken back to their cell, which was secure and barred. A whispered message from an attendant gave them hope for escape.

The following day, they faced the tribunal again, and the grand inquisitor informed them they had three more days. If they remained obstinate, he threatened to use torture. The boys were taken to a dark, damp dungeon far below ground, with no light. They found a pile of straw in one corner and decided to talk about personal matters to avoid being overheard. Each day, they received bread and water. On the second day, a bundle was left for them with a message of help. They tried to escape by digging at the wall but found it too hard.

Bewildered and confused by the sudden light, the boys followed the speaker. Surrounded by Indians, they made their way through the passages into the courtyard. The familiars had fled, and no one blocked their exit. The gates stood undamaged, but the postern door was broken. Nearby, more armed natives stood by. Onlookers watched with curiosity but did not interfere. The Inquisition was unpopular among the Spaniards due to its secret and cruel ways. The Indians had a plan; they escorted the boys through the town, concealing them. As they left, an Indian named Don Estevan revealed himself as their savior.

Ned and the Spaniard were in deep conversation about the impending arrival of an English pirate ship. Ned was anxious about the need to be prepared to join the ship before it reached the harbor to avoid missing the opportunity. The Spaniard, however, believed that resistance might not be offered, as the citizens were against it to prevent the English from destroying the town.

Upon the English ship's arrival, Ned and his companion rowed to join their friends on the ship.

The next day, a group landed and looted churches, demanding valuables from the town's leaders. Ned and Tom, not wanting to argue with their fellow sailors, chose not to join the group. They felt they had seen enough of the South American coast. The 15th of February, when the Golden Hind reached Lima, was a day the rescued sailors would never forget. They had faced a grim future, but now they were back among friends, sharing in the ship's treasures. Setting sail north, they aimed to intercept a ship carrying valuable cargo. After a successful encounter, they transferred the riches to the Golden Hind. Captain Drake then decided to venture out to sea, hoping to find a new trade route. Along the way, they experienced a frightening earthquake off the coast of Nicaragua, causing a brief panic onboard.|"[""1.

In their final conquest on the American shore, the crew seized a vessel arriving from China, laden with valuable cargo such as linen, China silk, and dishes. Among the treasures was a golden falcon with a large emerald in its chest. After a brief stop at Guatulco, where they collected more riches including a pot filled with silver coins, a gold chain, and jewels, the fleet sailed down the coast. A significant event occurred when Captain Drake accused Captain Doughty of treachery, leading to a trial where Doughty admitted guilt and chose to be executed. The fleet then rested, reorganized, and renamed a ship in honor of Queen Elizabeth I and Sir Christopher Hatton. Passing through the narrow Straits of Magellan, they encountered a burning mountain and discovered penguins, which they hunted for food.|['1.

Sailing for several days, the explorers reached a bay where they encountered natives in a beautiful canoe, which amazed them as it was more superior in design than anything they had seen before. Despite the natives being considered of low status, they seemed to have been more advanced in the past. On September 6th, they entered the South Sea, becoming the fourth expedition to pass through the Straits. Unlike previous voyages, they experienced better weather conditions. However, their luck changed as a powerful hurricane hit them the next day, separating one of their ships, the Marigold. After days without land in sight, they finally anchored at an island but faced challenges due to bad weather. The fleet faced further setbacks, including a treacherous attack by natives, prompting the admiral to seek refuge and supplies at Philip's Bay.|"[""1.

The locals offered to guide the explorers to a better harbor with more resources. The explorers accepted and arrived at Valparaiso on December 4th, where they found everything they needed without payment. The Spaniards welcomed them until they realized they were English and fled, leaving the town to the explorers. They found riches in a ship named the Grand Captain. Moving south, they landed near Coquimbo, where they encountered bold Spaniards on horseback. The English retreated, except for one defiant man who was killed. They later found silver bars near Iquique and helped a Spaniard with llamas carrying silver. The explorers traded with locals for fish using knives, beads, and glasses. They continued their journey, encountering new lands and animals like llamas, which historians found extraordinary.|"['1.

The residents, arriving in boats, kept their distance from the ship initially. However, due to a leak, the vessel moved closer to shore. The admiral, wary of the locals' betrayal, decided to construct a fort for protection. Surprisingly, the people were more astonished than hostile towards the newcomers. They even brought women along, indicating peaceful intentions. The natives viewed the white men as divine and worshipped them fervently. Despite efforts to show their humanity by eating and drinking, the locals persisted in their reverence. The admiral was alarmed by their self-inflicted harm during ceremonies. Eventually, the king offered the admiral the monarchy of the land, which was accepted. The Englishmen found the locals to be kind, strong, and agile. The country was named Albion, and a monument was erected to mark the English claim. The departure of the ship saddened the natives, who mourned and made sacrifices as the ship sailed away.|"[""1.

The admiral decided to stop searching for a passage around the north of America due to extreme cold and unexpected westward trends of the shores.

Five days after leaving Ternate, they found a small harbor. The crew landed, set up tents, and fortified their position. They repaired the casks and water vessels, fixed the ship, and prepared for the rest of the journey. The crew marveled at fireflies and discovered large crayfish on the island. These crayfish lived on land, digging holes under trees. The crew faced dangerous waters near Celebes but eventually found a safe passage. However, they later ran aground on a reef, causing panic.

The sudden appearance of the four deities at the front of the boat frightened the attacking natives. The boys quickly grabbed clubs from the natives and leaped into their canoes, striking with all their might. The islanders, terrified by the unexpected sight, abandoned their boats and swam to shore.

Upon reaching the deserted village, the boys plundered valuables, took the enemy's gods, and set fire to the huts. The village welcomed them triumphantly, offering heaps of fruits and fish. A council was held, and the villagers prepared a ceremony with dancing and music. The chief selected four girls to be wives of the gods.

"During this period, the girls patiently sat in front of the shrine while the boys escorted them with a serious ceremony to the hut. Palm leaves acted as a door for the hut, and the boys danced in an orderly manner around it fourteen times. They instructed the locals to bring provisions, fruit, and water daily for their future wives. After expressing gratitude to the natives, they retired to the shed, and the village returned to its usual peaceful state. ""There are two obstacles to our escape,"" Ned explained. ""Firstly, we need enough provisions and water to last until we reach Ternate. Secondly, we must leave without being noticed by the guards. We plan to seize and silence them. We have been subtly collecting provisions and water, and tonight we will make our move to escape in a canoe found by the shore."""|['1.

"Late at night, the boys quietly subdued the guards, gagged and tied them up against the posts. They disguised effigies as sleeping boys and loaded provisions onto their boat. Sneaking away, they paddled towards their ship. At daybreak, they saw the island where they were captured and headed north. By noon, they reached where their ship had grounded but found no sign of her. They hoped she had sailed off safely. Thirst quenched by fruits, they paddled towards Ternate. Passing islands, they disguised themselves with face paint and sang a song as they approached a war canoe. The sight of the ""gods"" paddling calmly filled the others with fear, causing them to paddle away in panic."|"['1.

For a while, the boys kept rowing leisurely after their visitors disappeared from sight. As night fell, a heavy mist covered the water, making it hard to see the stars. Sensing a weather change, they spotted an island to the north and decided to head there for safety. Rowing with all their might, the boys struggled as the wind picked up. Eventually, they heard the sound of waves breaking on the shore. With a crash, they landed on the beach just in time before a storm hit. They dragged their canoe inland among coconut trees to seek shelter. The hurricane raged for a day, and when it passed, they found their canoe damaged. Determined to fix it, they searched for a tree to extract glue-like substance to patch the hole.|['1.

Ned suggested making glue from animal sinews to mend bows, while Reuben proposed using coconuts to keep the boat afloat. They collected nuts, emptied them, and crafted pegs and a net. Testing their makeshift boat at night, they found it floated well. The next day, they loaded provisions and set off. Despite the slower pace, they reached Ternate safely after ten days.

The group was surprised to find themselves heading towards Tidore instead of Ternate. Ned explained that going to Ternate might jeopardize their chances of returning to England as they could get in trouble with the Portuguese. They decided to head to Tidore instead, where they hoped for a safer reception. As they approached the island, they decided to wait until morning to avoid any misunderstandings with the locals. Eventually, they landed and were met by a Portuguese governor. Ned explained their situation, emphasizing that they were seeking hospitality and protection after being separated from Captain Drake's ship during a voyage. The boys dried off and awaited the governor's response, hoping for a safe passage back home.|"['1.

Ned spoke truthfully, and the governor, unwavering, offered his help. He inquired about how they got separated from their friends. The young men, thinking it wise for the governor to search nearby islands for their crew, shared the story of leaving the Golden Hind. The Portuguese expressed admiration for the English and offered his house for their use. The island surprised them with its cultivated fields and spice groves tended by the natives. The Portuguese enforced Christianity and used the locals as laborers in exchange for goods. The castle, though not strong against European attacks, was well-suited for defense against the natives. The garrison of thirty soldiers lacked discipline and relied on reinforcements expected soon. The governor sought advice from the boys for defense against an impending attack from Ternate.|['1.

Ned and his friends offered to help the governor and were given a room and servants. The boys, skilled in Spanish and Portuguese, trained soldiers. Tom suggested fortifying the road leading from the shore with trees. They prepared for a possible attack by blocking windows and storing provisions. Ned raised concerns about the natives' loyalty. They armed themselves with culverins and wall pieces. A sentinel spotted a fleet of war canoes approaching. Tom and Reuben fired the guns, causing chaos among the invaders. The enemy retreated, their plan thwarted. The boys' quick thinking and military strategy saved the day.|"['1.

The canoes dispersed until they thought they were out of range. The lads shot round shots, but missed due to the small canoes and old guns. Ned suggested preparing to meet the enemy on land since they lacked beasts of burden to move the guns quickly. The islanders had left, showing they sided with the enemy. The group fell back to the castle to defend with mounted guns. The governor planned to make the islanders pay for betraying them. The enemy approached with the islanders, appearing formidable. Ned advised resting and preparing for battle. The enemy built fires and cut spice trees. Ned recommended waiting within the walls and resting for the upcoming fight. The enemy set up a battery with culverins, and a battle ensued in the morning.|"[""1.

"""I suggest waiting until nightfall,"" he said. ""Crossing the open ground during the day would expose us to cannon fire, risking many casualties. With our small force, we may not withstand their numbers. Let's reinforce the gates and silence their guns tonight."" At night, despite heavy damage, the gates held with added support. Twenty men were lowered by ropes for a stealthy flank. Led by the brave governor and English allies, they swiftly spiked enemy guns. A fierce battle ensued, but they succeeded. The next morning, natives attacked, but were repelled by cannon fire. The enemy planned to starve them out, awaiting reinforcements. The group feared the ship's crew might fall into a trap.

The governor mentioned that the ship carrying their friends should arrive sometime during the week, but the exact day was uncertain due to stops at other islands. Ned suggested a plan where he would swim or use a canoe to reach the ship once it was in sight. Gerald proposed to go with Ned to signal the others back at the castle when the ship was spotted. The plan was to wait until the ship was visible, then Ned would go to the vessel while Gerald returned to inform the group. Ned and Gerald disguised themselves in native attire and sneaked out of the castle to the shore. They avoided encounters with the natives and found a concealed spot near the coast. Ned planned to swim to the ship as using a canoe would draw attention. They waited for days, sustaining themselves with coconuts, until the ship finally appeared on the horizon.|"[""1.

Late in the afternoon on the fifth day, the boys spotted a distant sail. Although it was hard to confirm in the fading light, they were convinced they had seen a ship. Ned suggested a plan: he would stick to the shore until near the landing, while his friend would head to the castle to announce the ship's arrival and plan to attack the next day at noon. As Ned approached the landing, he saw two white men greeted by the natives, and he feared for their safety. With a long swim ahead to reach the ship, Ned worried about sharks lurking in the sea. Upon reaching the ship, he delivered a message from the governor and warned the captain of the imminent danger from the natives. The captain was relieved they had avoided an ambush and praised Ned's bravery and prudence.|"[""1.

Ned proposed a new plan to the captain, suggesting a delay in the attack until noon instead of daybreak. They found the canoes hidden in a quiet creek. Ned recommended sending men to destroy the canoes and create fear among the natives. The crew was divided into groups with specific tasks. When they approached the canoes, they were met with alarm from the natives. The soldiers defended the workers, who launched the canoes into the water. Despite the natives' attacks, the crew managed to tow the canoes out to sea and return safely. The soldiers fired at the natives to protect the crew during their retreat. The operation was successful, and the crew left the area unharmed.|"[""1.

The locals hurried to the shore in large groups. Many fell under the soldiers' fire but still waded into the water to seize the boats, showering them with arrows. When the Portuguese boats reached the open sea, few sailors escaped arrow wounds, while some were killed. The soldiers, better protected, mainly suffered limb injuries. The canoes were retrieved, and the team returned to the ship. A priest treated their wounds with soothing oils. Despite fears of poisoned arrows, Ned assured them none had died from wounds. The captain was relieved they postponed landing, giving time to rest. The ship's return with captured canoes caused a stir ashore. The soldiers, armed with arquebuses, and sailors advanced towards the natives. The ship's artillery cleared the beach. The advancing party faced heavy fire but the ship's guns scattered the enemy. A surprise musket volley from the castle turned the tide, aiding the Portuguese victory.|"['1.

Early in the morning, a large group of natives approached, signaling their willingness to negotiate by waving branches. The governor fired warning shots to keep them at bay, while preparations were made to consult with the priest on board. The priest, respected by the council in Goa, was enthusiastic about reaching a favorable agreement. The governor, seeking to impress the authorities, proposed allowing the natives to return to their island if they converted to Christianity and paid tribute. The next day, a meeting was held where the priest explained Christianity to the natives, who were puzzled by the unfamiliar concepts. The governor simplified the message, emphasizing the rejection of idols and acceptance of a single God. The natives, led by their king, agreed to the terms and sought forgiveness, promising not to harm the Portuguese settlement again.|['1.

"After a brief discussion, the King of Ternate and his people decided to embrace Christianity. The process was simple; they only needed to declare themselves Christians, receive the sign of the cross, and be sprinkled with water by the priest. The ceremony took place the next day with great pomp outside the castle walls. The King and his subjects knelt, made the sign of the cross, and were sprinkled with holy water. They were warmly welcomed into the Church.

Following this, the King and his people were escorted to the seashore, accompanied by the two white men who were spared at Ned's request. The invaders left in canoes, significantly fewer than when they had arrived a week earlier. The governor and the priest were pleased with the peaceful resolution and hoped for progress and approval from the viceroy in Goa.

As long as we peacefully engage in trade and refrain from forcing our beliefs, we are welcomed in India. However, if we were to impose Christianity on the locals, our welcome would quickly vanish. These people have strong armies, though not as well-trained as ours. In the South Seas, we aim to convert the natives, but not through force like the Spaniards. We have freedom of opinion in Portugal, unlike the Inquisition. The boys witnessed a grand Indian durbar, showcasing the chief's opulent procession.
