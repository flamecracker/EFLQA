The tale of the Nile Expedition is recent, needing no introduction to its historical part. The moral of the story of two lads raised as brothers is clear: never rush into action, as regret often follows. Great anxiety arose from a lad's hasty decision without consulting those involved. Although the outcome was positive, the rule stands firm. Acting on impulse, whether good or bad, can lead to serious consequences. Seeking advice from trusted friends and family is crucial when facing trouble. Concealment often stems from cowardice, a vice that can be detrimental. It's better to face temporary displeasure from loved ones than to risk permanent harm by acting alone. When in trouble, always confide in your best friend or parent for guidance and support.|['1.

"""I agree, Lucy, and here's why. First, the woman left India shortly after the incident.

When she saw them in Cheltenham, where Rupert says she stayed over a week, she stared at them but remained uncertain. If we, who have been with the boys for years, couldn't detect a resemblance, it's doubtful she could from brief encounters. The tiny mole on Rupert's shoulder doesn't prove he's our son. Even Edgar's letter confirms she didn't know which boy had the mark. Her motive was likely money, not identifying her son.

The next day, the 1st Hussars detachment, along with men from the 10th Hussars, embarked on a train journey to Suez, where they joined additional troops before boarding a steamer bound for Suakim.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the ship departed from the dock, filled with troops who cheered enthusiastically. The vessel was packed with soldiers and mules heading to Suakim for a short journey. Everyone was excited to avenge past events and escape the monotony of barracks in Egypt. The voyage was pleasant, with stunning views of rugged mountains and hills. They approached Suakim cautiously, avoiding reefs in the region. Upon arrival, they were met by an officer who shared news of a shipwreck and mutiny among black regiments. Despite setbacks, there was relief that the garrison at Sinkat was spared. The troops disembarked swiftly, ready to join forces already stationed in the area.|"['1.

Edgar was thrilled by the lively atmosphere as the troops were in high spirits. The first arrivals were eagerly questioned. They reported that the 19th and Mounted Infantry had scouted across a lagoon between the beach and the area behind it, spotting the enemy forces. The next morning, the Gordon Highlanders and Irish Fusiliers, along with other troops, crossed the lagoon and took over the fortification. Despite the desire to advance, they needed to ensure a secure supply line. The Naval Brigade, made up of elite sailors, also landed to reinforce the troops. General Baker's arrival added confidence to the troops, eager to avenge their previous defeat. The soldiers worked diligently despite the scorching sun, preparing for the upcoming advance.|"['1.

The campfires burned all night, wary of a possible enemy attack. Rain soaked the sleeping troops, but relief came with morning reveille. Soldiers dried off, ate breakfast, and cavalry crossed the lagoon to water their horses. Infantry formed a square, with cavalry scouts ahead. The enemy retreated as the column advanced, taking up positions with guns ready. The square, led by General Graham, moved parallel to the enemy's ridge, planning a flank attack. The enemy, surprised by the maneuver, opened fire but missed most shots. The square redirected slightly to avoid heavy fire, while the artillery engaged the enemy guns. Despite casualties, the square pressed on, cheered by the men. By noon, the enemy's guns fell silent, and the square advanced, ready for the final assault.|"['1.

The battle was fierce as the British square faced waves of Arab attackers. The Arabs, armed with spears and swords, charged relentlessly, but the British fire was unyielding. Every Arab who dared to attack fell in the face of the British rifles and machine guns. The British square advanced, facing continuous assaults from the Arabs who emerged from bushes and rifle-pits. Despite the challenging terrain, the British maintained their discipline and pushed forward. The battle intensified as the Arabs defended their stronghold in a brick building, but the British prevailed, capturing enemy positions and driving them to retreat. The cavalry, held back initially, later joined the battle, pursuing fleeing Arabs and engaging in fierce combat.

The surgeon approached the major, discussing plans for the wounded soldiers. The major decided to seek the general's advice and ensure proper care for the injured. After receiving instructions, the major swiftly returned, confirming they wouldn't charge again due to the increasing enemy numbers. The wounded were bandaged, and arrangements were made to transport them safely. Edgar, with multiple wounds, was assured by the surgeon that he would recover in about ten days. The cavalry moved cautiously to El-Teb wells, carrying the wounded. At the field hospital, the injuries were re-examined and treated. Edgar, after a drink and medical attention, fell asleep. The next day, the officers checked on their men's conditions. Corporal North faced a challenging recovery, while Trumpeter Smith had narrowly escaped severe injuries.

The major commended Smith for his conduct, recommending him for the Victoria Cross. The force moved towards Tokar, leaving some soldiers behind to protect the hospital. Many Egyptians from Tokar sought refuge in the camp. The troops encountered no resistance and found the town's inhabitants in poor condition. The cavalry set up camp at Debbah. Edgar, recovering from his wounds, awaited the return of the force armed with spears. The expedition yielded captured rifles and ammunition, burying over a thousand fallen Arabs. The force, along with Tokar's residents, returned to Suakim. The victory at El-Teb was initially met with disbelief in Suakim, but the arrival of the Tokar refugees confirmed the defeat of the Arabs.

Upon arrival at Suakim, Admiral Hewett and General Graham issued a proclamation urging tribesmen to abandon Osman Digma and seek protection and pardon. The respected Sheik Morghani supported this, claiming God sent the English due to forsaking their old religion. Edgar, recovering on the hospital-ship, was eager to rejoin his squadron expecting a move against Osman at Tamai. Despite Osman's defiance, Edgar's return was celebrated for his bravery and expected promotion.

Edgar thanked the sergeant for his advice and promised to heed it. He humbly acknowledged that his previous acts of bravery were more instinctual than intentional. The soldiers, though eager for battle, now respected the Arab foes after witnessing their fierce fighting at El-Teb. The men were aware that the upcoming battle against Osman Digma's forces would be challenging. The cavalry, usually confident in their skills, felt uneasy facing the Arabs' unconventional tactics. As they prepared for the next day's battle, the troops discussed the dangers posed by the Arab warriors and the need for new strategies. The Royal Highlanders set up a defensive camp near Tamai, known as a zareba, to protect themselves from potential attacks. Despite the slow progress through the bush-covered terrain, the troops maintained their readiness for the impending confrontation.|"['1.

Inside the fortified camp, a strong watch was kept. Despite the proximity of ten thousand enemies, the moonlight provided visibility across the open area, justifying the risky camp location. After a grueling march, the troops rested briefly before preparing for a potential attack. Commander Rolfe ventured out to scout the enemy, confirming their peaceful state for the time being. As night fell, gunfire erupted from the bushes surrounding the camp, but most shots missed their mark. The troops remained vigilant, ready to defend against any assault. Eventually, the enemy retreated after a brief exchange of fire. The next morning, the troops regrouped and moved out, encountering heavy enemy fire near a concealed ravine.

The British forces faced a fierce attack from the enemy. Lieutenant Graham bravely defended with his men, but the chaos made it hard to hear orders. The enemy closed in, overwhelming the 65th and sailors. The sergeants and rear ranks fought fiercely. The brigade had to retreat, but cavalry and General Buller's square provided support. The British forces fought back, driving the Arabs away. The battle was brutal, with many casualties on both sides. The British troops regrouped and advanced, reclaiming abandoned guns and pushing the enemy back. They reached Osman Digma's camp, where they found valuable items left behind by the fleeing Arabs.

The cavalry, after finding ammunition and loot in a village, returned, burning Osman's camp. Despite not pursuing Osman, the tribes still supported him. Two years later, another expedition was needed. The cavalry, aiding in the fighting, were content. Troops were then sent to Suez, leaving a small group in Suakim. The short-sighted policy led to Osman regaining power. Edgar's wounds were inflamed, requiring hospitalization. The regiment reunited in Cairo. Edgar missed out on the Victoria Cross. Cricket matches were played in Cairo, and the safety of Khartoum, especially General Gordon, was a concern. Gordon's efforts to stop the disorder in the Soudan were met with resistance. The city was besieged, and despite pleas for aid, help was delayed. Eventually, an expedition was prepared to aid Khartoum.|"[""1.

The decision to delay the expedition up the Nile was met with disapproval from those familiar with the river. Concerns arose that waiting too long would make it nearly impossible to navigate the cataracts, risking the fall of Khartoum to the Mahdi. Troops were disappointed to learn that only a small cavalry force would be taken, with the rest remaining in Lower Egypt. However, some soldiers took a philosophical view, acknowledging the challenges ahead. Despite mixed feelings, there was a sense of unfairness among the troops towards the favored English regiments selected for the risky expedition. Trumpeter Smith received a surprising opportunity to join the Heavy Camel Corps, thanks to Major Horsley's intervention, despite his initial wish to give up his trumpet. This unexpected turn of events left Smith both grateful and apprehensive about the adventure that awaited him.|"['1.

"""This is cleaner dust,"" Edgar mentioned. ""The Long Valley dust blackened one; this does not seem to have any dirt in it. As far as the uniforms go there is not much difference, but one doesn't feel so grimy after a charge over this Egyptian sand as one did in the Long Valley.""

""It was Trumpeter Smith, sure enough. Well, you can bowl and no mistake, young un. It is rum meeting out here like this. And how have you been getting on since? You fellows were in the thick of it at El-Teb, I saw; and got cut up a bit by those niggers, didn't you?""

""That we did,"" Edgar replied. ""I am not sorry that we are going to fight as infantry this time, for I can tell you it is not pleasant charging among fellows who throw themselves down and hamstring your horse or drive a spear into him as he passes over them; and once down it is likely to go pretty hard with you.""

Willcox remarked that the river's twist was fortunate, preventing them from being stuck in garrison towns. He mentioned that camels can be fast, especially riding camels and dromedaries, but they are rare and pricey. Despite their ill-tempered appearance, camels rarely bite but act fiercely. Edgar, with experience in Egypt, joined a troop of cheerful men for an upcoming expedition. They bantered about cavalry tactics against spearmen. Edgar noted that savages, like the Zulus, display remarkable bravery. The troopers hoped to witness such bravery but not while riding camels, which they found unenthusiastic. They discussed the discipline of soldiers versus the fearless charges of savages. The troopers were eager for the expedition, hoping to witness the bravery of their foes.|"[""1.

"Edgar chuckled, ""No, I don't think so. We'll be fighting on foot, like the old dragoons who only used horses to reach the battle."" The men prepared their arms for the march, eager to move. Edgar assured, ""We'll travel faster than the infantry, maybe twenty-five miles a day. We'll be well ahead when it's time to fight."" As they embarked on the steamer and flats, cheers erupted.

The unit arrived at Assouan and, the following day, a portion of the group traveled by boat to Wady Halfa, located 180 miles up the river. Edgar's troop was among those who made the journey. They anticipated a larger settlement but found only a few mud huts and unfinished railway sheds. The soldiers engaged in infantry drills and received their gear and saddles before heading to the camel station nearby. The soldiers were entertained by the sight of their camels, gathered from various regions. Adjusting the saddles to fit the camels proved challenging due to the animals' different hump sizes. Mounting and dismounting the camels, which knelt for these actions, was a significant challenge. The soldiers spent days learning to ride the camels, enduring falls that provided amusement to all except the riders. The camels' behaviors, including unexpected leg movements, added to the soldiers' challenges and frustrations.|"['1.

On the march, the soldiers obediently followed the halter's guidance, keeping a steady pace without interruption. After a week of training, they grew accustomed to their camels, eagerly awaiting the order to begin. The infantry's boats, crafted in England, were being loaded with provisions and supplies. Despite the challenging journey up the river, the boats were hauled against the strong current by troops and locals. The troopers initially thought the camels had it easier, but their opinions changed as they saw the boats sail swiftly with the wind or rowed laboriously in the sun. The journey from Wady Halfa to Dongola covered 235 miles, with daily marches of about twenty miles. The men bathed in the river and searched for scarce game in the evenings. The rocky, dry terrain made the marches monotonous, but the lush campsite at Korti provided a brief respite before the arrival of more troops.|"[""1.

I informed them that they wouldn't hear from me until I established myself independently, and I will adhere to that. It was unexpected to encounter Rupert here. His fortune in becoming General Stewart's aide-de-camp is remarkable, likely due to the general's connection to my father. Perhaps Sergeant Bowen is my father.

If I can assist you, I will. Let's agree to put this matter aside until the campaign ends. Then we can decide what steps to take. It will benefit you to spend a bit more time in this environment.

Troops continuously arrived daily, and by December 27th, a significant portion of various regiments had gathered at Korti, including the Sussex, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, Essex, Gordon Highlanders, Black Watch, and Staffordshire. The scene at Korti had transformed drastically in just a few days since Edgar's arrival. The palm grove remained, but the green fields and crops were now flattened or trampled, resembling the sandy landscape of Aldershot. Plans were in motion for a desert march to Gakdul, about a hundred miles away, under the command of Sir Herbert Stewart. The force, consisting of officers, men, and camels, paraded and departed in formation, with Hussars scouting ahead. The column stopped for a break two hours later, as the moon rose to light their journey.|"['1.

In the vast desert, a group of men embarked on a journey. The silence of the desert was occasionally broken by laughter and chatter. As night fell, sleepiness enveloped them, leading to frequent halts for the lagging baggage animals. A trumpet signaled stops and starts along the column. The march continued through the night on hard sand and gravel ground, with smooth hills and mimosa bushes. At dawn, they rested near trees, then resumed their journey. Cheers erupted at midnight, marking the new year. They reached wells with scarce water, where the Hussars managed with limited supply. After capturing a caravan, they finally arrived at the Gakdul wells, unloading camels with some difficulty. Climbing a rock, they discovered deep pools of water, ensuring their water supply.|['1.

In the desert, a group of travelers faced a challenge in accessing water. Despite their efforts, they couldn't reach the water source. However, with ingenuity, they used a string to retrieve water from a deep pool. The water was refreshing, hidden from the sun's heat by towering rocks. After quenching their thirst, they marveled at the water's value. Engineers swiftly set up pumps to provide water for all. While some rested, others worked tirelessly to ensure the camels were watered. The group built forts and organized supplies, preparing for an extended stay.

Easton shared his recent experience of a challenging adventure, where he had no skin left on his knees, elbows, hips, and back after a deep descent among rocks. He expressed his frustration about the army's portrayal of such tasks. Skinner dismissed Easton's injuries as comparable to a football game. The arrival of reinforcements lifted the spirits of the troops. The group was joined by men from the Sussex Regiment, sailors with a Gardner gun, and Royal Artillery with artillery pieces. The force now comprised about 1500 men, 90 horses, and 2200 camels. The troops were mounted on camels except for the Hussars, who rode Egyptian horses. The camels, exhausted from overwork, needed rest. Despite the challenges, the troops prepared to advance, understanding the urgency of their mission.|"['1.

The journey from Gakdul was set to begin on the 13th after preparations on the previous day. Water-skins were leaking except for the sailors' india-rubber bags. Despite efforts to mend them, the repairs were not successful. Each man carried a skin and a water-bottle on his camel. The Heavy Camel Corps led the march, followed by the Guards. Many camels were left behind, forcing the animals to rely on shrubs and grass for food. The troops carried limited ammunition. The column made a brief stop for dinner and rest, facing delays due to camel breakdowns. The journey continued through a valley, with a halt for the night. The next day, the troops marched towards Abu Klea, but news of the enemy's presence changed the atmosphere to readiness for battle. Men prepared with confidence for the impending confrontation.|"['1.

The cavalry scouts quickly reported a large enemy presence in the pass below. The troops, with the battle-ready soldiers in the lead and the supplies following, cautiously advanced up the hill. They strategically positioned themselves on a flat ground with a clear view down the pass, where the Arabs were waiting for an attack. The Arabs had built stone walls on the hillside to shoot from. At the hilltops, many Arabs could be seen moving around, gesturing animatedly. As dusk approached, the general decided to halt for the night due to the unknown strength of the enemy. A group of Mounted Infantry and sailors built a fort on a nearby hill, while camel regiments protected the front. The troops worked to construct defensive barriers as enemy fire continued throughout the night. Despite the tense situation, the soldiers stayed vigilant and prepared for any potential attacks.|['1.

A short while later, an officer informed them that Major Gough from the Mounted Infantry got knocked out by a bullet grazing his forehead, and an artillery officer was hit in the back. Edgar expressed concern for his brother Rupert, wishing he were with them. Orders were given for action as the general decided to leave a small group to guard the baggage and camels and advance to seize the wells. The troops formed a square formation with the Guards' Camel Corps and Mounted Infantry at the front and the Heavy Camel Corps and Naval Brigade at the rear. The enemy intensified their fire as the square moved out. Natives appeared on the hills, firing at the advancing square. Despite the difficult terrain, the square pressed forward, facing heavy casualties. Suddenly, a large group of Arabs emerged and charged at the square, prompting a fierce battle.|"[""1.

The battle was fierce as the soldiers fought against the Arab attackers. The chaos was overwhelming as the square was penetrated, and a hand-to-hand combat ensued among camels, soldiers, and Arabs. The men fought desperately, but the Arabs' long spears gave them the upper hand. The Mounted Infantry and Marines fired into the enemy ranks, while the Heavies engaged in close combat. Despite being pushed back, the Heavies held their ground, allowing others to concentrate fire on the Arabs. As the enemy retreated, the square cheered, ready for another attack that never came. The aftermath revealed a scene of devastation with casualties on both sides. The survivors, like Sergeant Bowen and Edgar, fought bravely, defending each other until the enemy withdrew.

The sergeant indicated Edgar's injured left arm. Edgar was surprised when he realized he had been wounded by an Arab while defending himself. The cut on his arm was deep, almost severing a strip of flesh down to his elbow. Edgar bandaged his wound as the sergeant commended him. Thirst was a common affliction among the troops, with many suffering and some even fainting. The 19th regiment searched desperately for water, and when the Hussars finally found wells, the wounded were tended to and the troops quenched their thirst. Despite the water being murky and stirred up by the Arabs, it was a relief. Volunteers were needed to retrieve baggage, and the night was bitterly cold for those left behind without blankets. The surgeons worked tirelessly through the night, and by morning, the troops were allowed to rest. Fresh meat was secured, and preparations were made for the onward march towards the river, a challenging journey ahead.|"[""1.

The guides disagreed on the path to take, causing the group to march in circles. Dense mimosa groves confused the pack animals, leading many to collapse.

Edgar bid farewell to the sergeant, his heart filled with concern for his safety. As he ventured through the grove, he encountered a cultivated land leading to a river.

As they neared the village, the Arabs cheered in victory. A crowd gathered, screaming and gesturing fiercely as they entered. Edgar feared he would be harmed, but his captors pushed through to a larger house in a courtyard. There, his legs were tied again, and he was left in an outhouse for hours. Voices inside argued angrily, but Edgar was surprised to be alive, considering the Arabs' losses in battle. He hoped for rescue by British forces. However, he knew an attack on the village might not happen soon due to the risks involved. Thirsty and bound tightly, he was eventually dragged out into the courtyard to face the chief and his men.

The leader signaled, and two followers untied Edgar. They gave him water and some food, but his fever and arm wound caused him great pain. Left alone, he tended to his injury with wet cloth. Later, he was locked in an outhouse with no escape. The next day, amidst commotion, he was bound again as the town prepared for an attack. The British forces approached, leading to gunfire. Edgar knew the town's defenses were strong. After the British retreated, he was freed. The Arabs celebrated news of the fall of Khartoum and Gordon's demise. Edgar, fearing a counterattack, braced for battle, but the sheik confirmed the victory. The Mahdi's forces were victorious, leaving Edgar in a precarious situation.|"['1.

The strike deeply affected Edgar. His thoughts were filled with the failed rescue mission for Gordon due to delays back home, leaving Gordon alone to perish. Edgar pondered the disappointment of the troops, the sorrow in England upon hearing the news, and the uncertainty of the next steps. He realized his fate was now uncertain. The possibility of the expedition not coming at all loomed large. Edgar saw the strategic importance of rescuing Khartoum and the potential consequences of not doing so. While the soldiers were eager to push forward, the exhausted state of the animals necessitated a halt. The soldiers were disappointed by the order but understood the need for rest. Despite the challenges, Edgar remained hopeful, determined to escape slavery and find his way back to safety.|"['1.

The soldiers began constructing a protective barrier using saddles and boxes while some groups tried to suppress the enemy's gunfire. The natives remained hidden, making it challenging to target them directly. The Arabs, however, had a clear view of the camp and fired musketballs towards them. Sadly, Sir Herbert Stewart was gravely wounded, causing deep sadness among the troops. Colonel Burnaby, the designated backup leader, had also fallen earlier. The command now fell to Sir Charles Wilson. Despite heavy enemy fire, the soldiers were ordered to occupy a ridge to prevent a surprise attack. Skinner and Easton, among others, worked to fortify the position despite the danger. Eventually, the order to move forward was given, and the troops formed a defensive square to advance, facing a sudden charge from a large Arab force.|['1.

A British square, about five hundred yards away, faced the Arabs in battle. The British troops fired volleys, but the Arabs kept advancing. Sir Charles Wilson ordered a cease-fire to prevent discouragement among his men. Then, as the enemy drew closer, the bugle sounded, and the British resumed firing. The officers shouted to aim low and fire steadily, and the Arabs fell like grass. Despite a few reaching close, the Arabs hesitated and fled. The British troops halted briefly to replenish supplies before continuing towards the Nile. The wounded were tended to, and the exhausted troops rested. The troops reached the river safely, securing water. The next day, they would connect with Gordon's steamers and rest until further reinforcements arrived.|"['1.

When the column arrived, the camels were quickly loaded with supplies after the walls of boxes and saddles were dismantled. Due to many camels being lost, the smaller redoubt remained untouched with a stronger garrison. Sir Herbert Stewart and the wounded were transported down in cacolets. Rupert Clinton, exhausted and recovering from a sunstroke, remained at the zareba. The troops had a meal before moving. The plan to attack Metemmeh was uncertain due to its size and the number of defenders. A reconnaissance might be attempted first. Returning to the river, the troops noticed many Arabs around Metemmeh. The next morning, the troops paraded and marched towards Metemmeh, encountering deserted villages and observing Arabs outside the town. Grenadiers fired volleys from a distance, causing some Arabs to fall back into the town. Artillery shots had little effect on the mud walls, prompting a closer inspection for potential assault points.|"['1.

A cannon fired accurately from the walls, causing the troops to retreat. Soon after, four steamers with the Egyptian flag approached, unloading 200 soldiers and small brass guns. The soldiers quickly set up their artillery and opened fire. They reported that Gordon was holding out and that 3,000 enemies were two days away. Sir Chas. Wilson decided not to risk an assault on the town and retreated to Abu Kru. While searching the groves, they found two camels with missing saddles, suspecting Arabs. The missing man was not found. A fort was built by the river, except for the Guards' Camel Regiment, who stayed at Gubat. The wounded were moved to the new fort. Rupert received a letter from a wounded sergeant, causing a stir among the troops.|"[""1.

Easton believed that Edgar might have been captured by the Arabs rather than killed. He reasoned that Edgar would have known the Arabs were numerous and would have waited for the group to reach the water source. He speculated that the Arabs might have taken Edgar prisoner between the grove and their camp. Easton thought that Edgar might be alive and held captive by the Arabs. Another officer agreed, suggesting that there was a slim chance Edgar could escape or be handed over if the British forces defeated the Mahdi's troops. However, the officer cautioned that it was more likely Edgar would be taken to the Mahdi and possibly killed. Easton shared this information with Rupert, Edgar's brother, who was deeply upset by the news. The following day, Rupert and the troops worked on fortifications and prepared for Sir Charles Wilson's journey to Khartoum. Troops were on guard against potential attacks while working. Despite the challenges, the troops remained hopeful and prepared for any situation.|"[""**1.

"Above the noise, Edgar heard threatening words like ""Death to the Kaffir!"" and ""Send him to the Mahdi!"" Realizing his fate was being debated, he picked up an Arab sword, ready to defend himself. The commotion lasted for an hour, with moments of intense arguments followed by brief calm. Edgar knew Arab disputes rarely turned violent. Eventually, the uproar settled, and his captors returned inside. Another heated argument ensued among the sheik and his followers. The sheik insisted on keeping Edgar as his slave, while others favored handing him to the Mahdi. The sheik, stubborn and proud, refused to yield. He was willing to fight for his independence against the Mahdi's threats. The followers, not wanting to join the Mahdi's army, agreed to follow the sheik's plan to escape by boat the next day."|"['1.

The unfortunate trader and his wife, who had been hiding in a small room while the sheik and his group took over the rest of the house, were summoned and told that their guests were preparing to depart. They were instructed to close the gate behind the departing guests and not open it until morning. The group then started cooking cakes for the journey before silently leaving a little before midnight. They navigated through the streets and reached the river where they found boats. Choosing one, they rowed across the river and landed near Shendy. They circled around the town swiftly, making Edgar struggle with the pace due to the heat. Despite his fatigue, he kept up, knowing that showing weakness would not be wise. After walking many miles, they slowed down, and Edgar muttered to himself about the challenging run. The sheik was pleased with Edgar's performance and ordered him to gather fuel to make a fire. Edgar found dried maize stalks and returned to the group, where a fire was lit using matches obtained from European goods. The sheik was content with their progress and believed Edgar would be a valuable slave. They rested for a few hours and resumed their journey, avoiding villages to evade potential pursuers. Edgar's feet were in pain from the hot sand, but the sheik helped him by providing makeshift footwear. They continued until nightfall, quenching their thirst at the river.

Edgar found that applying the remedy greatly eased his pain. The bandages protected his feet from the sand, allowing him to continue. Drinking water from the river also helped him keep up with the group until they reached a village where the natives had sent camels. Edgar was tasked to stay with two Arabs near the village while the others went ahead, with a plan to reunite the next morning. The men with Edgar seemed unhappy and even threatening, but Edgar, confident in his strength and experience, remained calm. As night fell, they tied his legs as instructed by the sheik, and Edgar slept peacefully. The next day, they continued their journey, passing through sand-hills and camping overnight. The sheik reunited with them the following day, and they reached a village near the river. The sheik was welcomed warmly, and they rested before continuing their journey. Edgar noticed the devastation caused by the Mahdi's forces in the villages they passed.

Agreement was finally reached, and the camels were guided onto the boat. The sheik signaled Edgar to lie down and cover his head, claiming he was ill. The boat crossed the shallow river with ease. Once ashore, Edgar watched the camels as the sheik settled matters with the boatman. They were now between the two Niles, near Khartoum, a once prosperous land now desolate from the Mahdi's presence. After a short journey, they stopped at a deserted village to gather food. The next day, they reached the White Nile and followed it. Edgar was ordered to pick corn for the journey. They halted for the night, and the next morning, the camels were watered. The journey continued through the desert for eight days, with Edgar collecting grass and bushes for fire and food.

The leader rode his camel to the camp, where he dismounted and entered a large tent. Meanwhile, the other Arabs and Edgar were surrounded by curious natives. The locals were intrigued by Edgar, a dark-skinned man with charcoal on his skin. They handed him water to wash, which he gladly accepted after his dusty journey. As he cleaned his skin, the charcoal came off, revealing his true color. The sheik then emerged with a woman whom he introduced as Edgar's mistress. Edgar knelt and placed her hand on his head, earning her approval. The camels were unloaded, revealing loot taken from the desert.

The arrow-root was not accepted, but the Liebig was well-liked. Edgar explained its benefits for sickness and travel. The Arabs saw its value for making broth and the sheik ordered to keep them for journeys. The medicine-chest intrigued them, and Edgar helped a sick girl with quinine. The tea was a disappointment.

Edgar was happy to have his blanket to keep warm during the cold nights. After finishing his supper, he wrapped himself in it and fell asleep. At dawn, he was awakened by voices in the tent. The sheik and his wife came out, and the sheik told Edgar to help the other slaves. But Amina wanted him as a gift and not to work in the fields all day. She assigned him tasks like drawing water, fetching fuel, and grinding meal. When Edgar returned with the fuel, he was sent to help water a maize plantation. The other slaves were disrespectful, calling him names in Arabic. Edgar stood up for himself and got into a scuffle, impressing the sheik with his strength.

There was a chance that some of Hicks' officers might still be alive. Rupert then shared a letter that revealed a shocking truth about their family.

Rupert and Easton discussed the mysterious circumstances surrounding a dying man's declaration at the hospital. Rupert was troubled by the revelation that neither he nor his brother, Edgar, knew which one was truly the son of Captain Clinton.

Rupert and his friends were shocked by the news they heard. The steamers had reached the town, but the Mahdi's flags were flying high, and the vessels were under heavy fire. Wilson's steamers were stuck, and Beresford was to rescue the crew. The firing in Metemmeh was due to news of Khartoum's fall. The officers learned the grim truth, causing grief and anger.

During the battle, Sir Charles Wilson's group was on an island close to where the second steamer sank up the river. They were fighting fiercely with an enemy force on the riverbank. They noticed the rescue steamer was damaged. At night, they crossed to the riverbank to signal the steamer and diverted the enemy's attention by firing at them. The next day, the steamer picked them up. Unfortunately, no news came from Korti, but a small reinforcement arrived. They destroyed extra supplies and left the forts. The group walked back to Korti as camels had perished. Rupert Clinton, weakened by fever, traveled with wounded soldiers.

Rupert was warmly welcomed by Lord Wolseley, who inquired about his plans. Rupert then mentioned that Major Kitchener had agreed to help him acquire two fast camels.

Major Kitchener and the sheik discussed the best route and the possible path Edgar's captors had taken. The sheik decided his camels needed two more days of rest before they could start. Rupert suggested giving the Arabs some goods to load onto the spare camels. This would help them blend in and avoid suspicion. The sheik and his followers were pleased with the offer. Major Kitchener complimented Rupert on winning over the group. The sheik's followers admired Edgar's strength when he swiftly dealt with a situation, and they worked enthusiastically alongside him. The day ended with the group milking goats and camels, and Edgar preparing tea for himself. He also tended to a sick child before settling down for a meal.|['1.

Edgar, a young man, found himself in an Arab tent where a sick child needed proper care. Realizing the water didn't boil, he decided to help. He instructed the woman on preparing a nourishing paste for the child. Edgar fetched some Liebig, a nutritious supplement, to aid the child's recovery. The community was impressed by Edgar's kindness. They sought his help, even for imagined illnesses. One boy had a severe leg wound that Edgar treated with hot water, carbolic acid, and caustic. The wound healed surprisingly fast in the desert climate. The community began to respect Edgar's medical skills. Despite facing challenges, Edgar's dedication and knowledge helped improve the health of those in need.|"[""1.

The other man, still angry, suffered from a swollen face after Edgar's encounter. Edgar, showing kindness, convinced the sheik's wife to allow the man to rest and apply hot water bandages. Edgar shared his food with the others, as their rations were meager. The sheik, noticing Edgar's generosity, praised his actions despite his initial doubts. Edgar quickly learned the language, impressing the sheik. However, an unexpected event occurred when Hamish, the man with the swollen face, and the best camel disappeared. The sheik, furious, accused the other man of aiding Hamish's escape. Determined to find Hamish, the sheik prepared to pursue him, ordering the village to pack up and move to a new location.

In just three hours, a significant transformation occurred in the valley. Only the sheik's tent and three others remained standing, as the rest were quickly dismantled by their occupants to avoid capture by the Mahdists. At mid-day, the journey began. The camels were heavily laden with baggage, pots, and people, making them almost unrecognizable. The group would travel without stopping until morning, rest during the day, and then journey through the night to reach the wells at daybreak. Amina took charge, ensuring everything was organized. She explained the plan, assuring Muley's safety. They would leave a lookout and might seek help from another tribe.

The chief expressed concern over the news, as their small group of fighters faced a larger, better-equipped enemy. Muley suggested a plan to defend their territory by equalizing their forces at the wady. However, he doubted their success in the open desert against the well-armed enemy. To counter this, the sheik proposed a strategic retreat to a zareba, loading camels with forage and forming a fortified camp. The plan involved sending a message for reinforcements and preparing for a defensive stand. The group quickly mobilized, setting up the zareba under the moonlight. Edgar was confident in the thorny defense they had built, believing it would be a formidable barrier for the approaching enemy.

The scout was sent to the wady with news, and the garrison spent the day fortifying their position. They built a hedge of bushes further out, piled heavy stones on the rampart for protection, leaving gaps to fire through. The Arabs taunted them, but at nightfall, sentries spotted horsemen in the distance. As the horsemen approached, the sheik fired a warning shot. The horsemen split up to flank the fort as the camels arrived. After a brief standoff, the dervishes launched an attack, running towards the fort. Edgar advised waiting to fire until the enemy was close. The defenders fired in rotation, keeping a continuous barrage. The dervishes quickly breached the outer hedge and attacked the main fortifications. The defenders maintained steady fire, aiming carefully at the oncoming enemy.|"['1.

The Arabs were too excited to obey and wasted most of their shots. Despite some dervishes falling, the hedge was being cleared rapidly. Edgar's accurate shooting caused the work to be abandoned on his side. The sheik and Edgar took command on opposite sides, defending fiercely. The dervishes attempted to climb the thorns but were repelled by the defenders. When the dervish leader saw his men falling, he called off the attack. As they retreated, they fired shots, injuring the sheik. The defenders triumphed as Hamish, the traitor, was shot dead. The dervishes regrouped, visibly agitated.

Edgar, a brave defender of the zareba, was confident that the enemy would not trouble them much in the future. Shots were fired sporadically to intimidate the defenders, but Edgar and his comrades held their ground. When one of their own was injured, they quickly tended to his broken leg. Despite the enemy's persistent firing, the defenders repaired the hedge at night. The sheik sent a messenger to seek reinforcements. The besieged garrison remained vigilant, even during the night, ready to defend against any potential attack. After four days of blockade, the sheik devised a plan to lure the enemy into a trap.

The sheik and Edgar discussed their strategy to defeat the dervishes. The sheik suggested letting the enemies gather together to prevent any from returning. The next morning, the defenders of the fort went out to face the assailants. Shots were fired from different points, and the Arabs advanced cautiously under the sheik's guidance. The dervishes, thinking they had the upper hand, gathered their forces. As they prepared to attack, a shout of welcome surprised them.

The wounded rode camels while the others walked. Upon reaching the wady, a messenger was sent to inform the women and children. Rejoicing and storytelling continued through the night.

The following day, a grand feast was held where several kids were slaughtered. The next morning, a caravan approached, and the entire encampment welcomed them with gunshots and shouts of triumph. The sheik took one of the horses, and the leader of the other party took the second one. They divided the captured camels between the two groups. More kids were sacrificed, and another feast was arranged. The sheik commended Edgar for his bravery and counsel, offering to adopt him as his son if he accepted the tribe's faith. However, Edgar respectfully declined, explaining that changing his religion would be insincere. The sheik understood and respected Edgar's decision, acknowledging his loyalty. The tribe prepared to leave the wady for El-Obeid, where they hoped to find work for their camels. Edgar saw this as a potential opportunity for escape.|"[""1.

Rupert embarked on a journey through the desert with a group of Arab tribesmen. Disguised as a trader, he rode a camel laden with supplies for the long trip. The sheik led the procession, followed by camels carrying their belongings. Rupert, wearing traditional Arab attire, protected himself from the sun with a cloth and a wig. Armed with a gun, sword, and spear, he carried provisions like Liebig, cocoa, and medicine to sustain him. As they reached wells for the night, Rupert and Ibrahim conversed about the journey. Ibrahim shared his discontent with being called derogatory names by soldiers, prompting Rupert to request being called Hamza in Arabic.

Ibrahim chuckled at the amusing nicknames the Arabs used for each other. He always carried a dictionary to decipher unfamiliar words. When they halted for the night, the sheik explained their plan to Rupert via Ibrahim. They would follow the river, keeping to the desert's edge to avoid encountering hostile tribes. The sheik aimed to search for a captive beyond the British expedition's reach. They traversed desolate lands, avoiding well-traveled routes to safeguard the caravan. Upon reaching a populated area, they engaged in trade with the locals. Rupert and Ibrahim played their roles as slaves, tending to camels and staying inconspicuous. Rupert focused on the mission to find Edgar while navigating the risks of discovery. The villagers longed for peace and normalcy, yearning for the days under Egyptian rule.|"['1.

The tribesmen in the interior were very unhappy. Only those who had actively participated in capturing cities like Berber and Khartoum had gained anything from the war, obtaining a lot of loot. However, everyone else was worse off than before. The promises made by the Mahdi had not been kept, leaving many disappointed. The sheik learned that there were white prisoners in Khartoum, but none in the hands of the tribesmen nearby. The villagers mentioned that the Mahdi demanded all captives be sent to him, and those who didn't accept him as the Prophet were killed. The sheik realized that if there were captives, they would be kept secret until the white troops left the river. After stopping at a village near Berber, they found out that a white captive had been taken by the Jahrin tribe, but had crossed the river with the sheik. The sheik decided to move on, avoiding Berber due to the need for a large gift to trade there, and crossed the river further downstream, knowing Edgar would not be near Metemmeh.|"[""1.

For weeks, the journey continued as they traveled far from the river bank to visit tribes and villages inland. Sometimes the group split, with a portion staying behind while others ventured to distant villages. Rupert had learned Arabic well, reducing the risk of being discovered. He used dye and belladonna to disguise his appearance. As they neared Khartoum, the sheik ensured Rupert's Arabic was convincing. In the city, they encountered the aftermath of conflict, with the Mahdi's soldiers and a struggling population. The sheik faced challenges selling his goods due to the turmoil. Despite the hardships, they pressed on, hoping for news of captives and the fate of loved ones lost to the upheaval in the region.|"['1.

The traders passionately argued, eager to reevaluate the goods they had purchased. The sheik, content with the profits, discreetly conducted his business. Under the cover of darkness, transactions were completed with cash from hidden stashes. The sheik, after a successful day, enjoyed a stew made from a kid. Meanwhile, a mysterious tale unfolded about a captured Kaffir and a sheik evading the Mahdi's wrath. The sheik's fate remained unknown, with a party sent in pursuit vanishing without a trace. The sheik's kinsman shared tales of intrigue and danger, leaving many questions unanswered.

Edgar agreed to the sheik's plan, allowing him to disguise himself in traditional Arab clothing to blend in. With a turban wrapped around his head and a burnoose covering his body, Edgar was unrecognizable. The group embarked on a six-day journey with camels carrying supplies.

The sheik and Edgar discussed the bravery of different tribes. Edgar shared his experiences of fighting against fearless tribesmen in Suakim and Abu Klea. He explained that the Egyptians, although followers of Allah, had lost their fighting spirit due to centuries of slavery.
