"Dick & Co., the familiar faces from ""THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS OF GRIDLEY,"" were a group of six young, adventurous boys - Dick, Dave, Greg, Dan, Tom, and Harry. These almost-fourteen-year-olds were known for their leadership and love for outdoor sports. Baseball was a favorite, and they were budding runners. Dick had even kickstarted a football squad at Central Grammar School. However, plans for a Grammar School football league were scrapped due to disunity among the North and South Grammar School delegates. With winter in full swing, the boys were thrilled for winter sports. They were fearless coasters and loved ice activities. Greg suggested camping in a cave during the holiday break.

Last summer, my cousin shared a cool camp idea with me. He and his friends built a cave-like structure by digging an oblong hole, making it 8 feet wide and 12 feet long. They covered the hole with boards and dirt, then replaced the sod on top. They created an entrance by leaving a square hole in the roof and made a door from a square board. Inside, they built a stove by digging into the wall and connecting it to a hole for a chimney. They added a floor with old boards and boarded the walls. Finally, they furnished it with an old table and chairs, making it a cozy camp. The boys discussed the idea of making a similar camp in the woods in spring. However, they realized they needed a weather-tight, warm place with daylight if they were to camp in winter. While contemplating this, they were interrupted by Fred Ripley, a high school freshman, who delivered a message and swiftly left, showing his disdain for the younger boys.|['1.

"""No, you won't,"" Dick said firmly to Hen, warning him that the man would have to leave soon. The group of boys quickly armed themselves with various makeshift weapons. Dick instructed everyone to be ready to defend themselves against the man if needed. Mr. Fits, the man causing trouble, was warned by Dick after being hit by a pellet from an air rifle.

Dave expressed concern about the worsening blizzard and doubted they could travel far before succumbing to the cold. Despite the tense situation, Dick refused to use violence against Mr. Fits. Tom Reade cleverly intervened by using a crowbar to stop Mr. Fits from advancing. The boys stood their ground, showing bravery.

Dick informed Tom that they needed to leave some of the fellows to guard the doorway against Mr. Fits. He, Tom, and Greg would go attend to the task while the others stayed by the door to ensure Mr. Fits stayed away. As they got ready, Dick grabbed the crowbar, Greg took the lantern, and they all bundled up in coats, caps, overshoes, and mittens. Despite the snow being knee-high, they finally reached the pile of logs. Dick started clearing the logs with the crowbar, while Greg and Hen carried some too. The snow made the task challenging, but they worked efficiently. Each boy was instructed to carry only one log at a time to conserve energy. Despite some objections from Hen, the Grammar School boys managed to gather enough wood after an hour and a half of hard work.|['1.

After completing the task of moving and stacking wood inside the cabin, the Grammar School boys were in high spirits, despite the biting storm outside. Concern arose about sharing blankets due to the risk of catching a cold as the fire died down. Hen proposed drying the wet coats near the fire and taking turns using them. Reluctantly, Hen agreed to this plan. The boys secured the cabin windows against intruders, ensuring their safety. As they settled in for the night, the warmth of the fire and the howling wind outside created a cozy yet eerie atmosphere.

Dan woke up feeling the cold, dark cabin. The fire had almost burned out, and the lantern had flickered off. Feeling uneasy, he noticed a narrow ray of daylight seeping through a crack. As he checked the time, he realized it was freezing inside. Dan and Dick hurriedly dressed, shivering in the bitter cold.

Dick was shivering in the cold, trying to light a fire in the cabin. Despite the freezing temperature, he persevered and managed to get the flames going. His friends encouraged him to go back to bed, but Dick remained by the fire, adding more logs to keep it going. As the cabin warmed up, the boys prepared breakfast and marveled at being snowbound.

When the boys woke up the next morning, the fire was still burning, but there wasn't enough wood left to keep the water in the barrel from freezing. Tom got up, put on his shoes and pants, and added more logs to the fire. Soon, the room warmed up, and everyone got dressed quickly, except for Hen. They all gathered at the windows to look outside. Two of the windows were blocked by snow, but they used boxes to stand on for a better view. Dick was worried about letting their families know they were safe. He started preparing a meal with codfish, eggs, potatoes, bread, butter, and coffee. Everyone enjoyed the meal except for Hen, who still ate more than anyone else. Greg asked for some hot water to melt the ice on the window without scalding a pigeon's feet.

After breakfast, Dick, Dave, and Tom decided to clear the snow-covered path to the cook shack before gathering wood. They shoveled through drifts to reach the shack. Inside, they found hidden jewelry and valuable items that belonged to stolen goods. Excitedly, Dick revealed that Mr. Fits was the thief who stole Dr. Bentley's watch and his. The boys realized that Mr. Fits had hidden the stolen items in the shack. They continued their task of gathering wood, knowing that their hard work would pay off when the snow hardened enough for them to explore and hunt with the air rifle.

Dave muttered about Fits returning to the cabin and his anxiousness to get them out. He began to understand Fits' desire for a hiding place for his loot more than for himself. Fits wanted to stash the items in the cabin until he could sell them. Their arrival disrupted Fits' plans, bothering him. Dave decided against wearing a watch in case Fits returned with accomplices. Dutcher and Greg fetched water from the spring, breaking the ice. Later, Greg was discreetly informed about the hidden loot. The boys kept Hen in the dark to prevent Fits from reclaiming the plunder. They planned to take turns keeping watch at night. The eerie wailings resumed, prompting them to stay alert. Dick urged Tom to wake them if needed, as they settled in for the night.

At once, the shack's door burst open, revealing Mr. Fits in snowshoes. Officers and Dick & Co. caught a glimpse of him. The lawmen dashed over the snow, while Mr. Fits, feigning confusion, awaited them. Suddenly, a smirk crossed his face. The deputy, in a frenzy, flung his gun at Mr. Fits instead of firing. The bullet narrowly missed Constable Dock, who knelt to avoid a shot. Mr. Fits dodged the officer's aim and taunted them as he fled. Though out of range, the officers pursued him. Dave Darrin noted that the blizzard had hindered Mr. Fits earlier, but now he could escape freely. The chase continued, with Mr. Fits proving swift on snowshoes.|"[""1.

The constable informed them that Mr. Fits wouldn't return and that he would call the police. Dick suggested the constable would enjoy time with his aunt, better food, and a comfortable bed. With the snow crust solid, the boys could explore the woods. Dick realized they hadn't checked the old shack since Mr. Fits left and suspected a hidden spot.

Tom, up in the air, advised the group to be thorough when investigating mysteries, suggesting they check all sides of any large object.

Fred Ripley and Bert Dodge were visibly scared. They hurried to assist Dick and Dave onto the roof of the log cabin without needing to be prompted. Dick or Dave promptly threw water off the roof's exposed side to prevent sparks from the nearby shack.

Hen showed bravery when he confronted Fits, who was causing trouble in the camp. Fits tried to intimidate everyone, but Hen stood up to him calmly.

The attorney assured the boys that the camp's worth was minimal, and the shack was the least valuable part. He offered them the cabin's use without needing permission.
