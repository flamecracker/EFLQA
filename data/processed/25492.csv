For over a year, I have been reading articles in the _Century_ magazine penned by generals from both the Union and Confederate sides. I noticed a trend where each Union general who wrote an article claimed their battle was the decisive one, while Confederate generals boasted about defeating their opponents. Reading these accounts, it's surprising that the Union, with so many supposed victories, didn't end the war sooner. Conversely, the demoralization of Confederate opponents after battles makes it astonishing that the Union emerged victorious. The generals' accounts paint a confusing picture of the war, each claiming victory and importance. Feeling compelled to share my own experience, I, a private soldier, fought a decisive battle against a Confederate soldier. Joining a cavalry regiment in 1864, I enlisted for the bounty, only to realize the war wasn't over, leading to regret over lost opportunities.|"[""1.

I was in a difficult situation that night. Staying awake meant risking my life, but falling asleep on duty was just as dangerous. Hunger gnawed at my stomach as I gnawed on a hard tack. Every noise made me jumpy, fearing an attack. Then, a massive figure on horseback appeared. My heart raced as I debated whether to shoot or ask him to halt. I didn't want trouble; I just wanted him to pass peacefully. As he neared, I struggled with my instructions. My trembling voice would give away my fear.

After two weeks of fighting for my country, I longed for rest and felt homesick. Thoughts of home consumed me, wondering if my loved ones thought of me. I yearned for the familiar joy of hunting back home instead of the relentless battle against Confederates. The news of a comrade's furlough sparked a desperate desire to go home. Seeking advice from a horse doctor, I learned that boldness was key to securing a furlough. With determination, I approached the general, disregarding formalities.

It was wrong to use bad language, especially in front of the chaplain, but I couldn't stop myself. The chaplain was hurt and expressed his disappointment, as he had just appointed me as his clerk for an easy job without any fighting. He wanted a good-hearted, honest man, and he thought I was the right fit until I used foul language. He was surprised that a soldier could swear so much. I assured him that I wouldn't swear again, explaining that the tough situations in the army made me do it. Eventually, I became the chaplain's clerk, which made me happy as I had no more guard duty or drilling. My only boss was the chaplain, and we spent our time together eating, drinking, and smoking in the tent. The chaplain explained my duties, which included taking care of the tent, writing letters, and assisting in funerals, even for colored soldiers. I was hesitant about conducting a funeral for a colored cook, but the chaplain assured me that all I needed to do was say a few good words about the deceased and offer comfort to the mourners. It was a challenging task, but the chaplain believed in my abilities.|"[""1.

The deceased had a troubled past, known as a liar, thief, and drunkard. Despite his flaws, he excelled in baking beans and preparing meals soldiers enjoyed. As I prepared for his funeral, I discovered more about his checkered history, including debts, deserted wives, and suspicions of murder. His demise was due to delirium tremens from drinking stolen whisky. The funeral arrangements were minimal, with few mourners and little respect shown to the deceased. I sought to organize a more dignified service, requesting bearers, mourners, singers, and a congregation from the colonel. The lack of solemnity at the funeral prompted me to seek a more respectful farewell for the late cook.|"[""1.

Colonel, in that box lies the remains of a colored cook. The chaplain assigned me to lead the funeral service. However, with only two colored men accompanying the deceased to their final resting place, it is not a dignified farewell. I requested additional mourners to give the departed a proper send-off. Eventually, the colonel arranged for company cooks and officer's servants to join the procession. Despite some light-hearted behavior from the mourners, we proceeded to the cemetery. Along the way, distractions like watermelons and jokes from the horse-doctor tested my efforts to maintain decorum. Despite the challenges, I aimed to honor the deceased with respect and dignity, speaking kindly of them. As we laid the body to rest, a brief moment of solemnity prevailed before my attempt at delivering a respectful speech.|"[""1.

Dear reader, I have faced many challenges in my life, but none as difficult as the one I encountered recently. I found myself in a situation where telling a lie seemed easier than speaking the truth. I had to deceive a family about the fate of their loved one, a brave soldier who had been captured. Despite my discomfort, I fabricated a story to spare them the pain of the harsh reality. The weight of my lie troubled me as I rode back to camp, haunted by the faces of the family I had misled. Upon my return, I faced a confrontation with the chaplain over foraging for provisions. Disgusted by the idea of stealing from civilians, I stood my ground and refused to comply with his demands. As a result, I was relieved of my duties and returned to my company, grappling with the moral implications of my actions.|"['1.

Three days without food left me pondering the cruelty of war. After rejoining my regiment, a sense of safety replaced the fear instilled by encounters with hostile individuals. Reflecting on the destruction and pillaging we had been ordered to commit, I questioned the morality of our actions. Expressing my discontent to the colonel, I was swiftly relegated to the rear of the company. Facing the prospect of foraging for sustenance, I vowed not to steal or harm anyone. The captain's response was grim – starve or eat the leather off my horse's halter. Refusing to compromise my principles, I reluctantly shared a hard-tack with my horse, a meager meal in the face of hunger.|"['1.

A few Sundays later, I heard a sermon on the sin of greed. The preacher could have shown his audience where a mule nibbled his coat if he had turned around. We rode all day without food, and I was so hungry that I imagined a table with a feast. During the ride, I saw delicious meals I had eaten before. When we stopped, the sergeant gave us meat, and I ate it without knowing what it was. Later, I volunteered for a dangerous mission with another soldier. Perhaps the strange meat gave me courage. Another soldier, McCarty, volunteered too, saying he would go wherever I went.|['1.

McCarty and I were chosen for a mission by the captain. We were to go to a house a couple of miles away to get a sheep. The captain warned us of possible danger, but we had to bring back the sheep. As we approached the house, we found a lamb with a bell tied around its neck. Just as we were about to take it, a little boy appeared, claiming the lamb as his pet. Overcome with emotion, I couldn't bear to hurt the boy's feelings, so I insisted we let the lamb go. The boy then led us to a big ram in the backyard, which we decided to take. I roped the ram, and as we tried to lead it back, McCarty's actions caused chaos, making me ponder if it was intentional. The ram charged, causing my horse to bolt back to camp with the ram in tow, creating a hilarious yet chaotic scene.|"['1.

Around this time, a significant event occurred that had a great impact on the country and myself. Historians have not mentioned it in their records, possibly out of jealousy or other reasons.

At that moment during my speech, the barrel I was standing on gave way with a thud, and I found myself immersed in corned-beef brine up to my neck. The boys cheered, someone tipped the barrel over, and they began rolling it around the camp with me inside. It was quite the predicament for a newly promoted Corporal. As they rolled me around and made a ruckus, I realized that holding an official position in that regiment was no easy task. All official roles come with responsibilities, but this one felt overwhelming. Eventually, they spilled me out of the barrel, leaving me in a sorry state. Instead of taking drastic action, I decided to laugh it off. They explained it was a customary initiation for new corporals. I invited them for a drink, which led to a pleasant evening until the chaplain arrived. He was furious, and our encounter left me pondering the challenges of official positions. Later that night, I dreamt of leading soldiers to victory, only to wake up to a mundane task of unloading supplies from a steamboat.

During a critical moment in battle, I had to quickly adjust my strategy. Despite encountering some unexpected situations, I remained calm and in control. I ordered my reserve to change tactics and secure the mule-shed until relieved by another brigade. After ensuring the First Division was holding its position well, I discovered some amusing incidents, like a soldier trying to cut off a chicken's head. The Iron Brigade was busy with unexpected tasks, like drying a shirt and frying chicken. I even enjoyed some butter-milk that seemed to clear my head.

I have done a lot in a country village. From clerking in a grocery to driving a team on a threshing machine, my experiences have been diverse. But the biggest challenge came when I was tasked to lead a pioneer corps to rebuild a bridge destroyed by rebels. The general instructed me to build a new bridge strong enough for artillery to cross and then set up a pontoon bridge across a river. The pressure was on, but I was determined to succeed. With a team of twenty men and tools in hand, we got to work. Despite facing rebel fire and a close encounter with a powder magazine explosion, we managed to complete the bridge just in time for the army to cross. The success of this mission was a proud moment, and I rode back to headquarters feeling like I had accomplished something great.|"[""1.

Jim and I were working on a bridge when shells started falling around us. I was scared, but Jim, a wise old veteran, reassured me. He said as long as the shells were falling past us, we were safe.

I was taken aback by the general's reaction to the bridge I had built. Despite feeling hurt, I mustered up all my courage and confronted him sarcastically. I questioned the necessity of the bridge in the swamp and its location, away from where it was needed. The general inspected the bridge and acknowledged its quality but expressed the need for it to be moved. Determined to prove myself, I offered to relocate the bridge overnight to the desired location. Despite the exhausting task, I successfully moved the bridge, impressing the general.

With some reluctance, she removed a half-stovepipe hat and shielded her face with a handkerchief as I inspected it. Inside, I discovered Confederate bonds and court plaster.

The colonel almost seemed to have feelings for me, but it didn't compare to the lady friend's antics. As a smoker, I readied my pipe and tobacco, and we ventured outdoors.

When I reflect on those trousers today, over two decades later, I am amazed that I didn't completely disappear within them. I would have vanished if not for the excess fabric at the top. Yet, inspecting the bottom, I discovered a surplus of at least a foot. Even if I had fastened the rope under my arms or buttoned them to my collar, they would have still been too long. Eventually, I rolled them up, extending far above my knees, but they sagged around my body. The jacket was equally ill-fitting, resembling attire for a monkey. The sleeves were tight, barely accommodating my arms. The body was constricting, necessitating a struggle to fasten it.

I should have ended it all there, but instead, I marched to the right, trying to appear innocent, and we headed to the field for dress parade.

Jim and his Company D comrades embarked on a mission to gather special treats for the sick corporal. They rode off to a nearby plantation to secure eggs, bread, milk, and jelly. Meanwhile, a compassionate woman arrived at the camp to provide comfort. She prepared a delightful meal including milk toast, poached eggs, and tea.

Jim, a soldier, shared a tale about his friend's recovery. He mentioned how he wanted a stylish funeral for his friend but was relieved that his friend survived. The angel, a kind soul, stayed with the friend all day. The friend longed for roast beef and turkey but had to settle for soups and gruels. However, the angel arranged for a special treat - gumbo soup and milk punch. The friend was amazed by the flavors and felt revitalized. Gumbo soup became a favorite, reminding him of the thoughtful rebel girl who prepared it. The milk punch was so delightful that the friend felt stronger after just a sip.

After my time in the hospital, where I received better care than most, I realized the importance of keeping up morale. I helped the sick by chatting and spreading cheer. Many soldiers were quietly sent to the hospital, often only known when they returned or were buried. I visited the sick, sharing stories and writing letters. I even penned a hopeful letter for a soldier who lost his leg. When he received a positive reply, he was overjoyed. I also wrote letters for deceased soldiers' families, a tough task. Upon returning to my regiment, I was greeted as a Lieutenant, a surprise that left me feeling humbled. My friend Jim joked about my new title, but I reassured him that our friendship remained unchanged.|"['1.

"The final chapter of my history concluded with an interview with the colonel. He confirmed the truth in the boys' words, acknowledging my right to be called ""Lieutenant."" A vacancy in the commissioned officers of my company arose due to a horse ownership discrepancy. The colonel, after thorough evaluation, recommended me for commission to the governor of our state. He emphasized that my promotion wasn't solely for gallantry but for being available and following orders cheerfully without displaying cowardice. He believed true courage is revealed in challenging situations. Despite my initial disbelief at the sudden promotion, I was congratulated by the officers.

The journey to the plantation was a welcome relief after weeks of being confined. I savored every moment riding my horse, who seemed to share in my joy. Jim, my companion, struggled to keep pace, occasionally falling behind only to catch up later. During a Thanksgiving dinner at the plantation, a girl shared valuable advice with me. She warned against letting my new officer status change me, emphasizing the importance of humility and treating everyone with kindness.

As Jim and I rode back to camp on Thanksgiving evening, the chaplain's words lingered in my mind. I realized how easy it would be for someone to act superior with a commission. Back at camp, the chaplain visited us with a new saber, hoping I would buy it for when I became an officer. I politely declined, preferring a common saber to a fancy one. The next morning, despite being promised a commission, I was detailed to work on fortifications as a private. I questioned the colonel about it, but he explained that until my commission arrived, I had to fulfill my duties as a private. Despite the setbacks, I remained focused on helping put an end to the rebellion, even if it meant digging trenches alongside privates for the time being.|"['1.

The chaplain, while chewing tobacco, discussed a method to euthanize sick horses with the narrator. The plan involved shooting the animals in the head and pushing them off a cliff into the river to ensure a quick death. However, the narrator felt uneasy about the idea of shooting the horses. When the execution began, the narrator tried to stall by pretending his gun needed repairs. He then engaged in a conversation with a group of southern men who were watching, expressing his concern about the wasteful killing of the horses that could have been useful for farming.

The other men agreed with the colonel's sentiments. I shared the same feelings but had a concern. Giving away the horses for plantation use could lead to them being used in the Confederate army, risking dismissal from the army. The colonel, though, assured me that the horses would not be used for war if lent to them. He pledged as a Southern gentleman that the horses would be returned in a year. Despite being poor, they wouldn't accept them as a gift but would return them or exchange them for previously stolen horses.

Jim and I were on a journey when we decided to camp for the night in a deserted cotton gin. Jim spotted a chicken roosting in a peach tree near a cabin. He went to get it for dinner. We boiled the chicken for three hours, but it turned out tough. Jim tried to pry off a piece of the breast to eat. We ended up pulling the hen apart to eat. The meat was tough like India rubber. In the morning, we had some cold chicken for breakfast, which was still tough. As we continued our journey, it was Sunday, and we saw people heading to a church in the pine woods. I suggested to some soldiers from our group that we should surround the church and steal the horses while the worshippers were inside. Jim objected, saying he didn't want to interfere with people practicing their religion. Other soldiers wanted to go for the horses. Eventually, more soldiers joined us, and we were armed, ready to capture the horses.|"['1.

As a temporary officer, I was given control of the group, and we devised a strategy. Our plan was to disperse and encircle the church, politely ask those outside to enter, secure the door, and post guards on three sides with windows. We agreed not to use force unless provoked and to maintain respect. If any disputes arose, I would handle them. We decided to bring about fifteen horses in case any of our comrades were on foot. Although I was uneasy about the task, we were far from base, hungry, and needed transportation. We approached the church quietly from different directions. Upon nearing the building, we encountered a group of men discussing a horse deal. The preacher was speaking loudly, and all was calm. We invited the bystanders inside, locked the door, and halted the sermon. Despite some objections, we proceeded with our plan to secure horses. When the minister tried to intervene, tensions rose briefly but were defused. We discovered baskets of food in carriages outside, likely brought by churchgoers. Recognizing the generosity, we divided the provisions among the hungry men. Afterward, I addressed the congregation, explaining our actions and expressing regret for the situation. A young Confederate soldier, understanding our plight, acknowledged the necessity of our actions. We departed, leaving the churchgoers to assess their losses. In the end, many were able to reclaim their horses or receive compensation. This experience led to a newfound friendship with the one-armed Confederate soldier, whom|"['1.

I was deeply embarrassed and humiliated when my horse caused chaos during a funeral procession. The horse, with its circus-like antics, turned a solemn event into a comedy show. Despite my efforts to control the horse, it dashed into a circus ring, knocking over a drummer and creating a spectacle. The horse's behavior continued as it barged into a quartermaster's tent, causing further mayhem. In a desperate attempt to rid myself of this troublesome horse, I traded it to the regiment's chaplain. The regiment's amusement at the chaplain's new acquisition was evident, but no one revealed the horse's mischievous nature to him.

In the previous chapter, I shared how I traded my circus horse to the chaplain, who rode away with the regiment for a review. I stayed back in camp pretending to be sick, but things took a turn for the worse. As the regiment returned from the review, the chaplain's horse, now riderless, was innocently led by a colored man. The atmosphere was tense as the colonel and his staff appeared angry. I was arrested on the spot, accused of misconduct. The chaplain, covered in red clay, was furious and wanted to harm me. The court-martial convened, and I defended myself, denying the accusations. The chaplain's version of events was dramatic, blaming me for his embarrassing ordeal during the review. Ultimately, I found myself in a challenging situation, facing serious consequences for a simple horse trade gone wrong.|"['1.

The horse misbehaved during a review, causing chaos and embarrassment for the chaplain. It even tried to jump through a sheet, mistaking it for a circus hoop. The chaplain was humiliated as the horse sat down like a dog and shook hands with the commanding officer. Later, the horse rolled over the chaplain, leaving him covered in dirt. The chaplain was put in a difficult position for trading a mule to a recruit. In response, the recruit traded a troublesome horse to the chaplain, seeking revenge. Ultimately, the recruit justified his actions, highlighting the lesson learned about treating others as you would like to be treated. The story serves as a humorous example of consequences and revenge in a horse trade gone wrong.|"[""1.

"The day after the rat battle, orders came for new soldiers to go on the steamer ""City of Memphis"" to join regiments near New Orleans. We quickly got rations and boarded the ship down the river. As a recruit, I felt like I owned the boat, but the officials disagreed. While admiring the Mississippi River, I was abruptly told to go below by the mate. I tried to order a drink but was directed to a different spot. At supper, I was asked to leave the table meant for officers and passengers. Feeling crushed, we recruits decided to take state-rooms on the upper deck. This led to chaos when we were forced out by the officers. I overheard a lady complaining about a soldier in her state-room, so I left to avoid trouble.

The soldiers, upset by mistreatment on the boat, drafted resolutions demanding fair treatment. They wanted equal privileges like dining in the cabin, sleeping in state-rooms, and access to all areas. A committee, including the narrator, presented the demands to the captain. The captain, initially appearing friendly, suddenly turned aggressive, physically removing the committee. They were unceremoniously thrown down the stairs. Despite this, the soldiers continued to voice their discontent from the lower deck.

During the week, we were invited to various homes, and we, a group of young boys, found ourselves intrigued by the charming girls of Louisiana. We had settled in a beer garden for about ten days, keeping our true identities as new recruits a secret. Despite our lack of experience, the locals in Carrollton believed we were government favorites. We spent our days studying an old map of the United States, planning imaginary military strategies. Everything was going smoothly until we decided to throw a party. However, our plans were abruptly interrupted when we received orders to report to New Orleans immediately. We attempted to explain our prior engagement to the commanding officer, but he sent troops to arrest us during our party. Despite our efforts to reason with the sergeant, we found ourselves in a challenging predicament.|"['1.

The sergeant warned us to avoid trouble, but chaos ensued when an Irish recruit got jabbed by a bayonet. The situation escalated as the sergeant's guard surrounded us. Amidst the commotion, I rallied the boys to resist the insult. However, our attempt failed, and we were overpowered. To ease tensions, I assured our guests that our actions were part of a secret mission. Eventually, we were escorted to New Orleans, where the truth behind the misunderstanding was revealed. Despite setbacks, I remained hopeful for my commission as we marched towards Vicksburg. Feeling like a jinx, I faced rejection from various officers.

"A cold chill came over me, and I wondered which of the ""by's"" would draw the ticket of death. The Irishman noticed my unease and offered advice. He suggested that in case of a dismounted fight, being number four was ideal. Number four would hold the horses while the others fought on foot. When the time came, I found myself holding the horses, bullets whizzing past us. The situation was far from safe as the horses panicked. The sergeant, unsure of bugle calls, mistook a retreat call for the wrong order, causing chaos. I found myself dragged by the horses, falling and getting injured.

I explained to him that when the bugle sounded and I saw the boys returning with a skip and a jump, it felt natural that it was a retreat call. I thought leaving was the right thing to do to protect the horses under my care. The colonel, known for my debating skills, decided not to punish me severely for the misunderstanding. Instead, I was under arrest until bedtime near headquarters. I cooked a meal for us, and the Confederate captain, initially distant, was surprised and grateful.

When I joined the cavalry, I purchased a fancy pair of tall boots, styled in the Wellington design. These boots, made of shiny morocco leather, extended above my knees and gave me the impression of fitting in with the elite cavalrymen. However, as a new recruit, I was unaware that these boots were actually the subject of ridicule among the seasoned soldiers. Despite being the target of jokes, I cherished my boots dearly. Unfortunately, their upkeep proved challenging, and I had to guard them closely to prevent theft. On one memorable occasion during a dusty march, my prized boots were lost, causing me great distress.

I went to the back of the plantation near the cotton gin to get some buttermilk when a group from New Jersey approached. The boss threatened me with a saber, took my boots, and poked me with it. Enraged, I decided to confront them. They were clean and well-prepared, unlike us. I marched to their camp, walked into the colonel's tent, and demanded my boots back.
