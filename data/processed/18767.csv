"The phrase ""going to the dogs"" is often used to describe a terrible situation. However, I have a different perspective. I believe that some selfish individuals should be the ones to ""go to the dogs"" to learn valuable lessons in gratitude, affection, and self-sacrifice. Dogs can teach us important things, including common sense. A touching story from 1716 in Scotland tells of a loyal dog who mourned his master's death by visiting his grave every evening and refusing to eat. In another story, a heroic Newfoundland dog saved a little girl who fell into a river by alerting her parents and guiding them to her. These stories show the loyalty, bravery, and selflessness of dogs, demonstrating the valuable lessons we can learn from them."|"['1.

In Switzerland, there is a range of tall mountains known as the Alps. Some peaks remain snowy year-round, making winter travel hazardous due to avalanches. St. Bernard's convent sits at a perilous pass, 10,000 feet high, tended by caring monks. They use Alpine Spaniels, also called St. Bernard dogs, to find and aid travelers caught in storms.

"Last summer at Niagara Falls, I met a dog who loved nature's beauty. The ""Maid of the Mist"" boat took us close to the Canada Fall, giving us a spectacular view. Among us was the dog, who seemed captivated by the scenery. He stood in the bow, drenched in spray as we passed the American Fall. Surprisingly, the dog did this every morning, joining the boat without an owner. Similarly, a dog on Staten Island acts as a philanthropist, caring for sick dogs in the area. He nurses them back to health in his kennel, showing kindness like the Good Samaritan. Dogs among the Esquimaux Indians and in Russia are trained to pull sledges, sometimes causing chaos on the road.

In the city of New York, there is a clever dog that brings his mistress the morning paper every day and even selects the one that belongs to her from the others. In another story from England, a dog had a pan tied to his tail as a cruel prank, but a kind Scotch colly helped him by gnawing off the string, freeing his friend from the torment. In Albany, a dog is fascinated by a moving shadow near a gas light in the post-office, much like people who chase after shadows. A farmer in Norfolk, England, was saved from freezing by his faithful dog who kept him warm until help arrived.

Horses are known for forming strong bonds with each other. In a British war known as the peninsular war, two horses that worked together dragging artillery became inseparable companions. When one of them was killed in battle, the surviving horse refused to eat and constantly searched for its lost friend, neighing as if calling out. Despite receiving care and food, the horse passed away shortly after, having mourned the loss of its companion. Another heartwarming story involves an old Shetland pony deeply attached to a little boy, his master. The pony would play with the boy and a dog, waiting for hours to bring the boy home from school. Animals like leopards and panthers share similar habits and appearances.

In the wild, panthers can be very destructive. A lady shared a story about a tamed panther and another about a wild one. In one incident, a panther entered a house through a window and tragically killed a little girl. Tamed leopards in India are used for hunting antelopes. They are blindfolded and carried in wagons to the hunting area to prevent them from rushing and choosing low-value prey. When released, they stealthily approach their target and with incredible speed and force, catch their prey. Another story tells of a brave lady who faced a wild panther in her home.

One night, an American panther killed a horse but didn't disturb the body until the next day. Nearby gentlemen watched as the panther returned, seized the horse with its teeth, and dragged it to a river. The panther swam across with its prey and took it into a nearby forest.

Once, a male and female elephant were cornered by hunters near a swamp. The male managed to escape the hunters' bullets, but the female was wounded and about to be captured. Suddenly, the male elephant charged at the hunters, attacking them to protect his companion. In another story, an elephant broke through a partition to defend a dog being teased by visitors. Additionally, an elephant returned a lost card-case to its owner in a crowd. In a different tale, a man in Ceylon tried to trick an elephant with a stone disguised as food, but the elephant refused to eat it. Finally, in the Cape of Good Hope, three brothers hunting elephants faced a tragic end when one fell from his horse, leading to a deadly retaliation from the elephant.|['1.

Elephants are incredibly intelligent creatures with remarkable abilities. In one instance, an elephant in Macassar learned to crack a coconut by observing a handler. The following day, the elephant used this skill to retaliate against the handler by hitting him with a coconut. Similarly, another elephant in Madras displayed complex emotions. While performing a salutation, the elephant accidentally killed its keeper, who had mistreated it in the past. Elephants have been known to use tools to ensure their safety, like testing the ground with a branch before stepping on it. These gentle giants can also display a sense of humor, as seen when an elephant playfully sprayed water at a sentinel who tried to stop spectators from feeding it. Additionally, elephants can be trained for agricultural work, like plowing fields. Their intelligence and emotional depth make them truly fascinating animals.|['1.

In the East Indies, a gentle elephant roamed freely in the city, visiting kind people. Despite being pricked by cobblers, the elephant only retaliated by spraying dirty water on them, much to the amusement of onlookers. Similarly, a Hottentot faced a lion while herding cattle. Climbing a tree to escape, he hid among bird nests to evade the lion's sight until it left. In another tale from the Cape of Good Hope, a hunter encountered two lions. Fleeing on horseback, one took down a lion with a well-aimed shot, but the other lion leaped onto his horse, causing chaos before being shaken off.

A brave man found himself face to face with a ferocious lion. Determined to survive, he fired his rifle, but the shot only grazed the beast. In a desperate struggle, the man used his gun as a weapon, striking the lion with all his might. Despite injuries, he fought on, inflicting blows on the lion until he managed to thrust the gun barrel into the lion's throat, ultimately defeating the powerful creature. The man, exhausted and wounded, survived the encounter. In another incident, a lion's strength and agility were described, illustrating the immense power of these wild animals.

It was once common for wild beast keepers to mistreat lions, playing with them and even punishing them for no reason. Lions usually endure this treatment calmly, rarely seeking revenge. However, when provoked, their wrath is fearsome. For instance, Labat recounts a lion separating a man's head after enduring mistreatment. Lions are typically the rulers of the forest. An unusual friendship blossomed between a lion and a dog in the Tower of London. The lion, instead of harming the dog, showed affection and shared a meal. When the dog passed away, the lion mourned, refusing food and roaring in grief. Ultimately, the lion died beside his departed companion, showcasing deep sorrow and loyalty.|"['1.

A lion, raised in Senegal and later brought to France, formed a deep bond with a terrier dog. The lion's attachment to the dog was so strong that when the dog passed away, the lion became despondent. Another dog was introduced to keep the lion company, but the lion was not pleased and accidentally killed the new dog. Similarly, two lions at a menagerie in Paris showed affection only to their keeper, M. Felix. When he fell ill, the male lion refused food and became agitated until M. Felix returned, at which point the lions displayed joy and affection. In a different instance, English consul Sir George Davis had a lion that he had raised from a cub. Despite warnings, Sir George entered the lion's den, and the lion greeted him with affection, demonstrating the strong bond between them.|"[""Question 1: What was the reason for the lion becoming despondent?\nA) The lion was hungry\nB) The lion missed its home in Senegal\nC) The lion accidentally killed a new dog\nD) The lion was not feeling well\nE) The lion's keeper, M.

"Oliver Goldsmith, a renowned writer, shared fascinating insights on bears in his book ""Animated Nature."" Bears, contrary to common belief, possess admirable qualities. For example, a bear named Marco displayed immense love and warmth towards a young Savoyard boy. The bear allowed the boy to share his den, showing kindness by keeping him warm and sharing food. Despite the bear's affection, a comical incident occurred when a bear in New York met its demise while hugging a saw in a sawmill.

Once, a bear and a bull had a rather laughable encounter in the forest. The bull was attacked by a small bear, and in defense, he pinned the bear against a tree with his horns. Unfortunately, they were both found dead later - the bull from starvation and the bear from its wounds. In another tale, a New Hampshire boy raised a young bear cub, which became his daily companion. The bear even followed the boy to school, initially making others shy, but soon becoming their playmate. Years later, the bear returned to the school, causing a commotion before being shot. Additionally, a clever white bear was seen tricking walruses to capture them for food in the Polar seas. Lastly, Greenlanders have had unexpected encounters with bears in their canoes, rowing the bears to shore as uninvited passengers.|"['1.

A British frigate was trapped in the icy Polar seas when three bears, a mother and her two large cubs, approached. They were lured by the scent of a sea-horse carcass burning on the ice. The crew tossed pieces of the flesh to them. The mother bear, despite being wounded, lovingly fed her cubs, who were shot by the crew. The heartbreaking scene of the mother bear trying to save her dying cubs moved the witnesses. In a different tale by Hans Christian Andersen, a bear wandered into a house with three children. Instead of harming them, the bear played along as the children mistook him for a big dog. The bear even danced and played soldier with the children until their mother returned, shocked but relieved to find them safe.|"[""1.

Bears have often been taught amusing tricks. I recall seeing one as a child that could stand on its head, dance, and do various other skilled acts. The trainer was an elderly man who pretended to be a magician to children. He dressed in a funny way, played a drum and a wind instrument simultaneously. Apart from the bear, the juggler had dogs that danced to his music and a cock that walked and danced on stilts. However, nowadays, I wouldn't want to watch such shows. I would be unable to ignore the fact that the animals in these performances likely suffered pain and mistreatment before showcasing their skills. This thought would ruin the entertainment for me. Many people have a negative view of rats, considering them sly and cunning. In Paris, rats gathered near slaughterhouses to feed on horse carcasses. When a slaughterhouse was proposed to be moved due to being a nuisance, objections were raised because rats would then infest the area without the carcasses to feed on. The rats were so numerous that they devoured the flesh of multiple horses in a single night, leaving only bones by morning. In one incident, over 2,600 rats were killed in a slaughterhouse after blocking their entry points. This tale, shared by Mr. Jesse in his Natural History book, recounts a fierce battle between men and rats in the slaughterhouse, where thousands of rats were eradicated in several hunts. The rats in the vicinity created burrows akin to rabbits, constructing extensive|"['1.

Rats are clever creatures, as shown by a story of a cellar infestation. To deal with the rats, a trap was set with corn as bait, but the rats avoided it. After several nights, the rats vanished altogether, deciding the cellar was no longer safe. In another tale, a German trained rats to perform tricks like climbing a wand and playing dead. The rats were rewarded with biscuits and affection from their master. A separate account tells of rats stealing oil from bottles by dipping their tails into the necks and licking off the oil.

The field mouse, shown in the picture, stores food in its underground nest for winter. These mice are meticulous in organizing their winter supplies. Each type of food, like corn, acorns, chestnuts, and hickory nuts, has its own storage area. If they run out of food before spring, they resort to cannibalism. Sometimes, hogs find the mouse's nest and devour its contents. The author humorously describes the mouse's plight as it watches the hog eat its hard-earned provisions.

Goats have been trained to do remarkable things. Dr. Clarke, a famous traveler, encountered a goat in Arabia that could perform incredible feats. The Arab who owned the goat taught it to balance on small cylindrical blocks of wood while he sang. The goat could stand on top of these blocks, stacked one above the other, without knocking them down. The Arab even tested the goat's balance by interrupting his song, causing the goat to wobble. In another story, a goat protected her kid from a fox on a hill. Despite the boys' efforts to scare the fox away, the cunning predator tried to snatch the kid, leading to a tragic fall for all three animals.

The jackal is a clever hunter, known for its cunning ways. It chases prey tirelessly, using its loud yells to startle the lion, who then joins in the hunt. The jackal covers a lot of ground, tiring out the prey until it can catch it. Once the prey is caught, the lion usually lets the jackal enjoy the spoils. Captain Beechey describes the eerie chorus of jackals, which can be quite unsettling.

"Great masses of flesh, torn out by their terrible jaws, mark the spot where one of these encounters has occurred. It not unfrequently happens that one or even both perish on the spot. On the banks of the Nile, whole fields of grain and sugar cane are sometimes destroyed by these animals. Clapperton, the enterprising traveler, informs us that, when on a warlike expedition, he had convincing evidence that the hippopotamus is fond of music. ""As the expedition passed along the banks of the lake at sunrise,"" says he, ""these uncouth and stupendous animals followed the sound of the drums the whole length of the water, sometimes approaching so close to the shore, that the spray they spouted from their mouths reached the people, who were passing along the banks. I counted fifteen, at one time, sporting on the surface of the water."" The following account of hunting the hippopotamus is given by Dr. Edward Russell: ""One of the animals we killed was of an enormous size. We fought with him for four good hours by night, and came very near losing our large boat, and probably our lives too, owing to the fury of the animal. As soon as he spied the hunters in the small canoe, he dashed at them with all his might, dragged the canoe with him under the water, and smashed it to pieces.

In his book, Mr. Miller describes the weasel as a destructive creature with a taste for blood. Weasels have been known to attack children and raid hen-roosts, not just for food but seemingly for the pleasure of killing. They are skilled hunters, capable of swiftly dispatching mice with a single bite to the head. Despite their small size, weasels are fierce and agile, making them formidable predators. Mr. Miller even shares a humorous tale of a weasel outsmarting a hungry hawk, teaching a lesson about greed. Weasels can be both cunning and brave, as shown by their ability to defend themselves against larger predators like hawks. Despite their ferocity, some people have kept weasels as pets, appreciating their playful and intelligent nature.|['1.

We spoiled Billy a lot. We had a box of hickory nuts in the attic, and he could help himself whenever he wanted. He visited quite often and didn't just eat from the box but hoarded them under the floor. Despite his greed, we adored him. Billy would climb on shoulders, dive into pockets for treats, and even leap from one person to another in the room. The more we pampered him, the more mischievous he became. His antics led to a court case where my father judged him guilty of grand larceny for stealing and wasting meal. Billy met his end that day. Similarly, I once met Master William's pet squirrel, Dick, who, though not performing tricks then, showed intelligence in his eyes. When Dick passed away, it saddened us all.

"When Dick joined the family, he was shy and capricious. Over time, he transformed into a playful squirrel, bringing joy with his antics. His cage was spacious with a big wheel, a luxury for squirrels. Dick loved exploring and often escaped, leading to thrilling adventures. Despite his mischievous nature, he had a knack for fooling those who tried to catch him. The chipping squirrel, a common species, would sing its monotonous ""chip, chip, chip"" tune from a tree stump, tricking unsuspecting children who tried to catch it.

The striped squirrel is a clever creature that builds intricate nests underground. If you were to dig into the earth where the squirrel resides, you would discover a network of tunnels and chambers filled with various nuts and provisions. The squirrel's storage system is remarkably organized, with each chamber connected by doors to the main passage. The Lapland squirrels are known for their remarkable emigration habits, traveling in groups and using pieces of bark as boats to cross lakes. However, this method can sometimes lead to shipwrecks if the winds are too strong. Snakes also have fascinating interactions with other animals, as seen in a tale where a squirrel was charmed by a rattlesnake. Additionally, squirrels have been observed weighing nuts to distinguish between good and bad ones, showcasing their intelligence.|"['1.

Years ago, a giraffe journeyed from Egypt to Constantinople, where his keeper showcased him in a square, drawing crowds of curious Turks daily. The gentle giraffe soon roamed the city, seeking treats from friendly hands at windows. He even tapped on lattice windows to announce his visits to well-treated homes. Docile and affectionate, he frequented streets with the most friends, charming all with his antics. In a separate tale, a foreign gentleman in France prepared for a ball at Versailles with the help of a dancing master. His monkey, observing closely, mimicked the lessons when alone, showing promise as a dancer. Lastly, a cunning monkey in the West Indies outwitted crows stealing his food by pretending to be dead. Upon catching a thief, he plucked its feathers, teaching it a lesson in a clever and amusing way.|['1.

An organ-grinder and his monkey faced the mayor of New Orleans for performing without a license. Surprisingly, the monkey charmed the mayor with his politeness, bowing and taking off his cap, leading to their peaceful release. In Bath, England, a monkey imitated his master by reading the newspaper with upside-down spectacles, mimicking his gestures. In the West Indies, monkeys observed a farmer's corn planting and cleverly harvested the crop in the night, passing ears of corn in a silent, organized manner back to the forest. In Sierra Leone, orangutans were trained to work like servants, carrying water in pitchers on their heads and weeping when the pitchers broke. Buffon witnessed an orangutan performing human-like behaviors such as walking upright, using utensils, and drinking from a glass.|"[""1.

In Africa, the orangutan is a powerful animal that can be aggressive towards humans. They build huts to protect themselves from the sun and rain, and even warm themselves by fires made by people. Despite their strength, they also show mercy, as a story tells of a baboon protecting a traveler from harm. Monkeys, however, can be mischievous, as one monkey tricked another into falling into the sea during a storm. In another amusing tale, a monkey got its head stuck in a jar and scared a soldier on duty, causing a false alarm in the garrison.

In England, a clergyman had a pet baboon that adored him. The baboon often followed the clergyman in the streets but was usually left at home during church services. One Sunday, the baboon sneaked into the church and perched above the clergyman. As the sermon began, the baboon mimicked the clergyman's gestures comically, causing the congregation to burst into laughter. Despite the clergyman's confusion and attempts to quiet the audience, the laughter persisted. In Africa, ape-catchers use a clever trick to catch apes by gluing their eyes shut with a solution disguised as water. Zebras, though beautiful, are stubborn creatures and not easily tamed. They are known for their resistance to being trained for labor, unlike horses. Cows, on the other hand, are depicted as peaceful and content creatures in the evening, chewing cud in front of a pottery in an engraving.|"[""1.
