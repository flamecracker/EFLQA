The ships engaged in a fierce battle at sea. The captain of the Madras planned a strategic attack, urging the passengers to target the brig's helmsmen. As the Madras approached, shots were fired, causing chaos on the brig. The Madras swiftly maneuvered, delivering a devastating blow to the brig's mainmast. The privateer's men, overwhelmed by the Madras' firepower, abandoned their efforts to assist the brig. The captain of the Madras decided against capturing the sinking brig, focusing on the safety and efficiency of his crew instead. The brig quickly succumbed to the damage, with its crew desperately trying to salvage what they could. The Madras sailed away victorious, leaving the sinking brig behind.|"[""1.

"When the ship Madras was a mile away, the smaller schooner lay about fifty yards from the larger brig, with its boats rescuing the swimmers. Suddenly, the brig lurched heavily. ""The schooner will save them all,"" assured the captain. Despite the fire they endured, he believed none had perished. The boat that reached the schooner first likely rescued many, and the masts and spars could support the rest. No more danger arose on the voyage, even through bad weather near the Cape.

"""Mother, let's discuss our plans,"" Dick proposed after dinner, as they sat on the veranda away from the other hotel guests. ""How should we start?""

""I'll inquire tomorrow, but I suggest driving to Conjeveram, about forty miles away. We can then take a native boat up the river Palar, passing Arcot and Vellore, until we reach Vaniambaddy. From there, it's only fifteen miles to Tripataly.""

Beyond Mysore lies the Mahratta country, where thirty thousand horsemen can be mustered. Unlike the people of Bengal, who easily succumbed to tyrants, the Mahrattis are fierce warriors. Although considered plunderers, they are courageous soldiers who could have conquered all of India if united before the English arrived. Despite missing that opportunity, a desperate struggle is anticipated when encountering them. The conversation shifts to the English-French comparison in dealing with natives. The English's amicable approach fostered strong bonds with the locals, unlike the French's haughty demeanor that alienated potential allies. Dick then encounters the Rajah's escort, learning about the reduced need for soldiers due to British protection, leading to contentment and prosperity.

The Rajah explained to Margaret the delicate situation he faced during Hyder Ali's invasion eight years ago. Despite his father's loyalty to the English, most local chiefs secretly supported Hyder due to Madras' weak leadership. The Rajah's father, fearing for his life, fled to Madras with his son and a small force. The palace was destroyed, and many lives were lost. After peace was restored, they rebuilt their home, but the threat of Tippoo, Hyder's son, loomed. Tippoo's ambitions to conquer southern India posed a constant danger. The Rajah warned Margaret of the impending turmoil and the likelihood of seeking refuge again.

The plan was for the Mahrattis from Poonah to attack Bombay, while those in Central India and the north would raid Bengal. The Nizam was set to invade the Northern Circars, and Hyder aimed his forces at Madras. Hyder quickly gathered military supplies, getting significant aid from the French in Mahe on the Malabar coast. The Madras government readied to strike Mahe when Hyder claimed the settlements of the Dutch, French, and English on the Malabar coast were under his protection. Despite threats, Mahe fell. The Madras government further irked Hyder by sending troops to aid Basult Jung, prompting Hyder to warn of retaliation. The Bengal government intervened, removing Rumbold's council and calming the Nizam. Hyder, however, marched towards war with the English. The British forces were unprepared, lacking supplies and garrisons. Hyder's army moved to conquer the Carnatic, causing panic and devastation. Sir Hector Munro made a critical mistake by not uniting his forces with Colonel Baillie's, leading to a missed opportunity to face Hyder's army.|"['1.

The battle campaign lasted just twenty-one days and was filled with remarkable events. The English commanders displayed incredible stupidity and incapacity, causing chaos. My father decided to withhold his participation until a skilled English general, like Sir Eyre Coote, took charge. Hyder surrounded and seized Arcot, then laid siege to Amboor, Chingleput, and Wandiwash. Sir Eyre Coote's arrival in November brought confidence back. He was a seasoned soldier, having fought in various Indian battles. Despite the challenges of obtaining supplies, he led the troops. The capture of Carangooly boosted morale and forced the retreat of the besiegers at Wandiwash. Sir Eyre Coote's strategic moves led to a crucial battle with Hyder's army. The troops, low on provisions, marched to confront the enemy, supported by a British fleet at Porto Novo. Lord Macartney's arrival as governor of Madras brought hope to the army. The battle was fierce, with the infantry moving in formation towards Hyder's strong defensive position.|"[""1.

The English troops were faced with a challenging situation as they approached Hyder's position. The enemy had set up multiple batteries and maintained a continuous cannonade, posing a formidable threat. Despite the overwhelming odds against them in terms of artillery and numbers, the English commander remained confident in their ability to succeed. As the English forces advanced, they cleverly maneuvered along the sand hills, outwitting Hyder's expectations. When the English infantry finally engaged the enemy, a fierce battle ensued. The English squares stood firm against Hyder's cavalry onslaught, repelling the attackers with disciplined volleys and bayonets. The chaos among the enemy ranks grew as they faced the relentless fire from the English forces, eventually forcing them to retreat.

The battle between the British and Hyder's forces was intense. Hyder's infantry initially retreated, but his cavalry and artillery tried to flank the British. The British second line, previously in reserve, engaged and repelled the attack. As Hyder's cavalry regrouped, a British schooner provided crucial support, halting the enemy's advance. Despite being outnumbered, the British continued to push forward, eventually forcing Hyder's retreat. The victory, although significant, did not lead to further advances due to logistical challenges. In a subsequent encounter, Hyder and Tippoo faced the British again. The battle was fierce and lasted for hours, with the British ultimately gaining ground. Hyder's forces claimed a draw, but the British camped on the battlefield, signifying their victory. Despite ongoing mismanagement, Sir Eyre Coote's strategic relief efforts and successful engagements ensured the safety of Vellore.|"[""1.

During the winter, Sir Eyre Coote advanced and resupplied Vellore. In March, a French fleet landed troops to aid Hyder, but a larger division was intercepted by the English. Throughout the year, minor skirmishes occurred until Hyder's death in December, succeeded by Tippoo. In April, Bussy led French reinforcements. In June, a fierce battle took place between Bussy and General Stuart, resulting in an English victory despite heavy losses. Tippoo besieged and captured Bednore, breaking the terms of surrender. Negotiations led to a treaty in March, securing the release of some prisoners. However, cowardly British commissioners abandoned many prisoners. Tippoo's looming threat persists, with the English ill-prepared to face his forces. Peace is fragile, and the future remains uncertain.|"[""1.

"Tippoo, known as the ""Tiger,"" is a fierce leader who takes pleasure in tormenting his captives. His army is well-prepared, with soldiers trained in European tactics. Tippoo's military skills have led to many victories, and he can mobilize his troops swiftly due to abundant resources. In contrast, the English struggle to assemble supplies for their army, hindering their ability to launch an offensive quickly. Tippoo's ability to sustain his troops with local resources gives him a strategic advantage. The English residents in the region are preparing for potential conflict, moving valuable items to safety. Tippoo's stronghold, built without flammable materials, is well-prepared for any attacks.

The soldiers in the passage are paid very little, yet they manage to support their families by cultivating land. Only twenty soldiers are on duty each month, while the rest can work on their farms. The soldiers are content with their pay of three rupees a month, as they are only on duty for two months each year. Additionally, they receive privileges such as no rent or taxes for their lands and a pension after retirement. The troop only costs about four hundred rupees a month, making it affordable. The soldiers prefer this life over being peasants, despite the low pay.

"The watchtower is in poor condition. The Madras government is weak and short-sighted like during Hyder's war. The only solace is that Lord Cornwallis in Calcutta holds more power than his predecessors. He is a skilled soldier and is known for his energy. He can quickly send reinforcements from Calcutta and mobilize the troops from Bombay. It is anticipated that there may be initial setbacks, but the hope is to teach Mysore a lesson so severe that they won't cause trouble in the future.

Tippoo remains in Travancore, and the Nabob suspects that General Meadows aims to intercept Tippoo's return to his capital by advancing towards Coimbatoor with a large force. However, Tippoo's swift Mysore troops may have already passed Coimbatoor. Despite Tippoo's military prowess, the English army's movements are being closely monitored.

By evening, the apartments were completely taken apart. The furniture was stored in a special vault that the Rajah had built when reconstructing the palace. The entrance to the vault was hidden in one of the private rooms, under a section of marble floor that lifted up to reveal steps leading down. Once closed, the trapdoor was seamless. Valuables were packed for transport, with silver cups guarded overnight by the boats. The next morning, preparations for departure were made, and the Rajah advised townspeople before leaving. The troop of two hundred men, including young farmers eager for adventure, set off with their own horses and weapons.

Surajah explained a clever plan to use orders on the sultan's treasury as a form of payment that could be hidden to safely trade for goods. Meanwhile, Dick suggested they shift the conversation to a safer topic like tigers to avoid suspicion from passing soldiers. Seeking assistance, they asked the villagers about the tiger's whereabouts to plan its capture. Surajah and his companions were shikarees, tiger hunters, seeking guidance to eliminate the threat to the village's livestock. Later, the soldiers questioned them at the guard house, but they managed to devise an escape plan to avoid being detained until the sultan's departure. The group prepared to leave that night, ensuring they had enough resources for the journey.|"[""1.

There should be no trouble in surprising the sentry, silencing him before he can alert others, and then restraining him. Let's search for some rope or use torn sashes for tying him up. We can use a rope to lower ourselves over the wall. It would be good to have our weapons, especially the pistols. If there's an alarm, we might need to fight or encounter a tiger. Once over the wall, we should be safe. If we run, they may shoot but won't hit us. If they pursue, we should be cautious on steep areas. It's vital to return quickly with news. Hiding is risky; we must move swiftly. Going down at night is perilous. We should aim to be back by nightfall. It's crucial to avoid getting caught or delayed.

The soldiers sat around the fire, chatting and eating for hours. Eventually, most went to sleep. Surajah and Dick planned to escape. They waited for the soldiers to settle down. Surajah advised waiting for the soldiers to fall asleep again before making a move. They decided not to harm the sentry, as it would be wrong. They waited for the right moment. When the coast was clear, they quietly made their way towards the door. They had to be cautious not to wake any of the soldiers. Their plan was to slip out unnoticed and head towards the steps.

Quietly, they rose and headed to the door, opening it without a sound. The sentry, leaning on his long gun nearby, was caught off guard. A voice startled them, but Dick swiftly subdued the sentry before a cry could escape. As a soldier rushed out, Dick disarmed him too, swiftly and silently. They dashed up the steps, the sentry's shot missing its mark. Escaping over the wall, they landed safely due to its design. Running along the wall's base, they heard shots behind them. Dick planned to mislead their pursuers, circling back through the village. Sprinting through fields, they left the commotion behind.

Surajah and Dick were on the run, trying to outsmart their pursuers. Surajah was puzzled by Dick's detour towards the village and his sudden possession of a gun. Dick explained that he aimed to prevent the man from using the gun against them. They strategized to evade their pursuers, suspecting that the officer might have caught on to their plan. As they sprinted through the broken country, they realized the need to double back and hide from their pursuers.

Dick and Surajah were in a hurry to reach Uncle with important news about Tippoo. Despite the rush, they debated which pass to take. Surajah suggested a longer route to the left, while Dick favored a shorter, familiar path. Surajah warned of steep rocks blocking the shorter way. However, Dick was determined to try it, hoping to find a way down. After walking for a while, they reached a rock wall with no clear descent. Exhausted, they rested by a stream, making cakes over a fire. Although not perfectly cooked, the cakes satisfied their hunger. As they continued, they spotted a road winding below, leading to a cluster of houses. Realizing the steep rocks offered no way down, they decided to follow the road towards the village.|"[""1.

Dick suggested changing direction and crossing to the edge of the pass above the fort. He planned to rest until dusk before attempting to enter the fort. Surajah and Dick observed a water course near the road that they could follow to get close to the fort without being seen. They decided to rest near a stream, make a slow match, and wait until dark to proceed. The two men planned to overpower the sentry and break open the gate. They made a slow match using a wet strip of cotton and gunpowder from a cartridge. As night fell, they cautiously approached the fort, staying hidden in the shadows and the stream bed to avoid detection.

Carefully navigating through the rocks, Dick and Surajah reached a wall with a culvert blocked by iron bars. Unable to pass through, they considered climbing the wall unnoticed. Spotting the gate, they noticed guards on the wall above. Quietly, they planned to open the gate, stay close to the wall, and crawl among the rocks to avoid detection. After removing the wooden bars, the gate remained stuck. Dick used his tinderbox to create a spark for distraction. Running down the road, they escaped unharmed as shots were fired from the gate. Their stealth and quick thinking helped them evade danger and proceed with their mission successfully.|['1.

As the men from the guard house approached the gate, they heard more gunshots. Looking back, they saw figures on the road. Their pursuers gained ground but started to lag due to exhaustion. When they reached a ruined village, four men were close behind. They planned to make a stand at the next village. With their pursuers closing in, they entered a hut. Dick fired a shot, causing chaos. Surajah joined him, and together they prepared for a fight. Surajah fetched weapons from a fallen man while Dick gathered arms from two others.

After securing the house, Dick and Surajah watched as the enemy horsemen approached. They strategically avoided firing to mislead the attackers. When the horsemen arrived, they searched nearby houses. Surajah fired at the closest enemy, causing the rest to retreat. The attackers regrouped across the valley. Meanwhile, Dick defended the house, shooting at the intruders. The attackers attempted to breach the door but were met with gunfire from the loopholes. Eventually, the assailants fled the scene. Dick warned Surajah to stay clear of the windows to avoid incoming shots. The two remained cautious, knowing they were safe from distant gunfire but vulnerable to shots from the neighboring house.

Two more puffs of smoke shot out from the small holes, and two men dropped. The rest pushed the beam against the door, breaking it open. Dick and Surajah fired their muskets, hitting their targets. The door crashed down, and the Mysoreans cheered. As the enemy charged, the defenders shot through the bars, then used their swords on the front line. The attackers retreated, thinking the defenders had endless guns. The defenders reloaded as shots came from the jungle. Dick suggested lying low to avoid danger.

At a crucial moment, when danger loomed, Dick and his uncle made a daring escape. They rode swiftly down the valley, sharing horses with their comrades.

Despite uncertainties, they prepared for potential attacks. Dick's uncle stressed the importance of caution in future missions. They hoped for the safe return of prisoners held by Tippoo. However, conflicting reports clouded their understanding of the enemy's movements. The troop's next steps were vital in defending against Tippoo's advancing army.

On the 4th of March, the army faced a sudden attack near Bangalore. While approaching the town, three horsemen charged towards Lord Cornwallis and his group. The Rajah and his officers swiftly intervened, resulting in a scuffle where one horseman was killed, another by the staff, and the third captured. The incident stemmed from a quarrel among the men, fueled by alcohol. Bangalore, a town with fertile soil, abundant vegetation, and strong fortifications, was the setting for the clash. The army, led by General Meadows, planned to storm the town's north gate the next day to avoid Tippoo's army nearby. The assault led to a fierce battle, with casualties including Colonel Moorhouse, who tragically lost his life in the fight.|"['1.

During the siege, the British troops relentlessly fired at the enemy from the 36th Regiment while artillerymen bombarded the gate. Eventually, the gate collapsed, allowing the British forces to pour in, causing the enemy to retreat. Some enemies hid in houses, continuing their attacks until British troops stormed their positions. By nightfall, the British had full control of the town. Tippoo, enraged by the swift capture, attempted to reclaim the town with infantry and artillery but was repelled by the 76th Regiment. Despite facing a larger enemy force, the British continued to press on, setting up closer batteries to the fort walls. The siege progressed, with both sides exchanging heavy fire. Lord Cornwallis planned a secret assault on the fort, which was executed successfully under the moonlight, resulting in the British forces overtaking the fort.|"['1.

The fort was captured just in time, with provisions nearly depleted and ammunition running low. The British loss was fifty, while six hundred of the garrison perished. The governor, a brave soldier, died fighting. Lord Cornwallis offered to bury him, but Tippoo insisted he be laid to rest where he fell. The news of the fort's fall shook Tippoo's followers but boosted British morale. The British army marched north to Deonhully, where they joined forces with the Nizam's cavalry. Tippoo, cowed by the capture of the fort, retreated. The Nizam's horse proved undisciplined. The combined forces guarded a convoy through the pass of Amboor and returned to Bangalore. Lord Cornwallis planned to march on Seringapatam to end the campaign swiftly. Tippoo, consumed by rage and fear, took brutal measures to hide his mistreatment of white captives.|"[""1.

When the British army began its campaign, the weather was terrible. Heavy rain had flooded the land, making the roads almost impossible to traverse, causing the troops to move slowly. Facing Tippoo Sultan's strong position on the direct route, Lord Cornwallis opted for a longer path to avoid confrontation. The countryside the British passed through was desolate, with empty villages and no inhabitants in sight. Battling the rain and logistical challenges, the army reached the Cauvery River on May 13th, only to find it too swollen to cross. They decided to march ten miles upstream in hopes of a better crossing and to meet up with General Abercrombie's forces. Despite facing Tippoo's resistance, the British managed to outmaneuver him during a storm, but encountered difficulties due to the Nizam's cavalry. Eventually, the British army forced Tippoo to retreat, but their victory was marred by the loss of animals and supplies. Facing a dire situation with food scarcity and hostile forces, Lord Cornwallis decided to retreat to Bangalore to avoid further losses.|"['1.

During a march, Lord Cornwallis and his army were surprised by the arrival of two Mahratta armies, close at hand. This unexpected encounter brought relief to the suffering British troops. The Mahrattis provided abundant supplies and goods for the army. The delay in the Mahratta's arrival had been due to their engagements in sieges elsewhere. Lord Cornwallis quickly strategized the future operations, sending orders for necessary funds and dividing the forces for various missions. Dick, eager to be of service, joined one of the Mahratta forces as an aide-de-camp, ready to assist in reconnaissance missions.

In the year since Dick arrived in India, he had grown and become a strong young man of over seventeen. He had changed into an officer's uniform after joining Lord Cornwallis' army. Many hill fortresses were taken by the Mahrattis without much resistance. Some English captives were found, some treated well and others poorly. Dick learned from a released captive that his father was alive four years ago. The captive mentioned his father was taken by the governor of the fort. The fort was abandoned after the capture of Bangalore, and the captives were moved. The captives heard rumors of white prisoners being killed by Tippoo's orders. The captives were uncertain about the fate of prisoners in other hill forts.|"[""1.

No specific commands were given to the forts in the vicinity, as evidenced by the discovery of a few prisoners in some of them. It is possible that different instructions were issued to the forts closer to the capital, which Tippoo anticipated might fall into British hands. The more remote forts, like the one discussed, may not have received the same directives due to the absence of British forces in the area. Despite the uncertainty, the narrator finds solace in the fact that their father was alive four years ago and in good care.

After seeing the city and Tippoo's army from a high vantage point, the British forces positioned themselves six miles northwest of the city. Lord Cornwallis quickly surveyed the area with his staff. They encountered a dense hedge made of thorny shrubs and cords that shielded Tippoo's army. The British devised a plan to attack immediately. The forces were divided into three columns: Lord Cornwallis led the center column, while General Meadows and Colonel Maxwell commanded the others. Despite some confusion, the British managed to capture key positions and engage in fierce battles throughout the night. By daybreak, both sides suffered heavy casualties, with Tippoo's army losing significantly more troops. The British forces gained strategic positions but faced challenges during the night's operations.|"['1.

Tippoo made multiple determined attempts to drive off Colonel Stuart's force from the island and recapture the redoubts. However, he faced heavy losses and eventually abandoned the effort. He evacuated the other redoubts and brought his entire army to the island. Tippoo tried to negotiate, but Lord Cornwallis had previously rejected his advances due to Tippoo's disregard for treaties. The gallant garrison under Lieutenants Chalmers and Nash had bravely defended the town but was mistreated after surrendering. Preparations for a siege began, and negotiations were initiated with Tippoo. Despite doubts about Tippoo's sincerity, the siege continued. The army was surprised when hostilities ceased abruptly, leading to unrest among the troops.

Dick's family found it amusing when he realized he needed to adjust his behavior to blend in better. The Rajah advised him to practice moving in different disguises and to observe and mimic the locals' way of walking and carrying themselves. Dick would also need to wear native attire and learn to act accordingly. After some practice, he would have to stain his face and limbs and go out with Rajbullub to observe and learn from others. The Rajah emphasized the importance of paying attention to various groups like traders, soldiers, and fakirs to master different behaviors. Dick was instructed to avoid spending time in the garden or with women, instead focusing on learning his new role in town. The Rajah arranged for Dick's first peasant disguise, and he appeared in the outfit the next evening, ready to begin his undercover journey.|"['1.

"When he walked in, they all burst into laughter. The two women couldn't help but smile, and soon Dick was laughing at himself too. He had felt uneasy at first, wearing a similar outfit to Surajah, but now in front of his mother and aunt, he felt even more uncomfortable. ""Don't worry, Dick,"" his uncle reassured him. ""Boys would feel just as awkward in European clothes. Now, try sitting on your heels while we talk,"" his uncle instructed. Dick found it harder than expected.

His training continued daily without interruption. He explored the town, sometimes with Rajbullub, other times with Surajah, in various disguises like a peasant, soldier, or trader, adapting his walk and demeanor to match each role. Before donning these disguises, he applied a washable solution to remove any traces upon returning to the palace, where he now exclusively wore European attire. The Rajah emphasized caution, warning of potential spies working for Tippoo Sultan among the populace. As the departure date approached, his mother expressed growing anxiety about his risky quest to find his father. Despite doubts from others, he remained resolute, driven by duty and faith in his mother's conviction. He assured her of the minimal danger involved unless he locates his father, outlining a plan to search discreetly for British captives in hill forts. His mother, though worried, found solace in his determination and the support of his trusted companion, Surajah.|"['1.

The preparations for their journey started earnestly. They discussed the weapons to carry and settled on a matchlock, a pistol, and a sword each. They carefully selected the matchlocks, choosing the most accurate ones after testing them. The weapons, once stripped of their silver mountings, blended in with those used by the locals. They concealed gold and silver coins in various places on their persons for safekeeping. With bags of provisions, water, and spare clothing, they set off into the hills at daybreak. Dick bid a cheerful farewell to his family and embarked on the adventure with Surajah. As they climbed, silence enveloped them until they paused for a meal under a shaded rock, taking a break from the midday heat.

"Surajah spoke with a smile, ""I had almost forgotten that I once hoped to join the Company's regiments for war and adventure instead of just drilling men. The English rule has brought peace, but this journey with you offers excitement and danger, requiring caution and courage."" His companion replied, ""More caution than courage will be needed, especially if we encounter suspicion or find my father. Once in Seringapatam, we'll be safe. We plan to avoid unnecessary inquiries and head straight to the city to gather information on prisoners."" Traveling under the moonlight for the first week, they aimed to reach Seringapatam discreetly.

After walking for two days across the plain, Dick and Surajah decided it was no longer necessary to hide, but they still wanted to avoid running into any troops. They stuck to well-worn paths and bought food in villages, where they noticed the absence of caste marks on the residents' foreheads. The locals had been forced to give up their religion, with those who resisted being killed. As they made their way towards Seringapatam, they realized their plan to pass as villagers wouldn't work due to their different dialect. They devised a new story about coming from a village near the ghauts under English control and seeking to serve in Mysore as anti-English soldiers. They felt safe from betrayal by the locals who despised Tippoo. Upon reaching Seringapatam, they strategized to avoid being recruited into the army and aimed to find service in the Palace.|"['1.

"""I trust that we are honest,"" Dick said. ""We have assuredly not ventured here without a reason, and that reason is a good one; but this is not a city where one talks of such matters to a stranger in the street, even though his face tells one that he can be trusted with a secret.""

They followed him into the house, and he led them into a small room at the back. It was poorly furnished, but was scrupulously clean. A pan of lighted charcoal stood in one corner, and over this a pot of rice was boiling.

The old man motioned to them to take their seats on the divan.

""I do not ask for your confidence,"" he said, ""but if you choose to give it to me, it will be sacred, and it may be that, poor as I am, I am able to aid you.

During a dark period of history, both native people and English prisoners suffered under the rule of Tippoo in southern India. Many young boys were taken from their homes and trained to become soldiers, while English prisoners were forced to teach them, enduring harsh punishments if they failed. Some boys were kept in the palace to entertain Tippoo. The captives were separated to prevent uprisings against the tyrant. Those who survived were scattered in different towns, facing hunger and disease. Tippoo feared the English but still aimed to conquer southern India. If you find yourselves in this situation, you may be forced to join the army. It was a dangerous time where loyalty and survival were key.|"[""1.

In a distant land, a group of people faced persecution under a tyrant's rule. While many were executed upon arrival, some lingered in confinement, forgotten by the oppressor. A kind-hearted man named Pertaub offered shelter in his humble abode, a loft with straw for bedding. These persecuted individuals had secret ways to recognize each other, through subtle gestures like turning their thumbs while saluting. This discreet communication was crucial for building trust and ensuring safety. As darkness fell, the visitors left Pertaub's home, venturing into bustling streets filled with soldiers seeking entertainment and provisions.

In the bustling market, two skilled sword players entertained the crowd with their expertise, outmatching any challengers. Nearby, musicians played music that, though discordant to some, delighted the soldiers who showered them with coins. Amongst the lively booths filled with various goods, a plan was hatched. Disguised as followers of a petty rajah, they aimed to blend in and gather information. With the help of a local, they acquired fitting attire for their act.

Dick and Surajah were disguised in colorful attire as they observed the troops in the town. Surajah wore a red turban, a leather jerkin with iron scales, a scarlet kilt, and putties on his legs. Dick sported a steel cap with a red plume, a red tunic with a blue sash, and a skirt of linked mail. They decided it was a better disguise than the previous day's outfit. As they explored, they witnessed the cruelty of Tippoo's men flogging white officers. Dick was filled with rage but felt helpless.

We prepared to face danger and manage risks. If caught, we could escape under the cover of darkness and return to our starting point. Disguised as traders, we could blend in and move unnoticed. It seemed more promising than entering as traders directly, where we'd have limited mobility and interaction. We'd try this first and switch if needed. Gathering useful information on the first visit, we planned our next move. With goods and attire obtained, we were ready to embark on our journey. A delay occurred due to a proclamation about wild beast sports, with Tippoo in attendance. The event took place in a square with a network separating the spectators from the spectacle. Tigers were set loose to devour criminals. We observed from a strategic spot, near the harem's balcony. The sports began with fighting rams clashing head-on until one emerged victorious.|"[""1.

At the arena, a thrilling spectacle unfolded before Dick's eyes. First, rams clashed in a monotonous but intense battle, captivating the crowd. Next, elephants engaged in a tamer struggle, pushing with their mighty heads. Then, two groups of men armed with steel claws faced off, aiming to disable their opponents. The combat was fierce, with each blow drawing blood like a tiger's claws. Following this, a buffalo bravely faced a reluctant tiger, defeating it with a powerful toss. The tiger's subsequent battles with buffaloes showcased its strength until it faced a larger, fiercer opponent. The tiger's escape attempt, jumping at the palace balcony, created a moment of panic.

This evening, for sure. If he suddenly decides to check if you're at the Palace and discovers you're not, it could completely change his mood towards you. He can be quite unpredictable in his emotions. Someone who is his favorite one day might end up in trouble and facing punishment the next. It might feel like you're in a real tiger's den, and at any moment, he could turn on you. Take your current clothes and the ones you arrived in with you, so if you sense trouble brewing, you can quickly disguise yourself and slip out of the Palace unnoticed. If that happens, hurry back here, and you can change into merchant outfits.

In the sultan's army, there are five regular troops and three Chelah battalions. The Chelahs, though trained by Englishmen, have not been effective in war. They were forced into service and made to accept a religion they didn't choose. The sultan believed that with English training, they would fight well. However, the loyalty and leadership of English soldiers are what truly make them effective. The Chelahs, if placed in hill fortresses, might serve well. But due to concerns of treachery, they are not trusted in such positions. The troops' families live in huts on the upper plateau of the rock. Executions are carried out in the hill forts, causing discomfort to some loyal soldiers. Despite the challenges, life on the rock is not dull, with families mixing freely and treating each other as comrades.|"['1.

In the morning, Dick and Surajah bid farewell to the governor and rode down to the gate. A soldier awaited them, and their escort was ready. Before heading to the next fort, they decided to ride around the hill of Savandroog. They went at a slow pace, scanning the cliffs and slopes. They identified only two spots where climbing seemed barely possible, and they doubted the challenges could be overcome. Dick expressed concerns about potential attacks and the perilous ascent. As they turned south, leaving Savandroog behind, they pondered the governor's hesitation regarding prisoners. Dick suspected his father might still be held there, hidden to avoid execution. They contemplated the governor's reluctance to disclose the truth, speculating on his kind-heartedness and fear of Tippoo's orders.|"['1.

"He resumed control of the horse and it moved ahead. They rode silently for a while, with Dick pondering the situation repeatedly, growing more convinced he was correct, except for the possibility that the prisoner the governor aimed to protect might not be his father. ""Not now,"" Dick responded. ""We cannot turn back. We must visit the other forts on our list and gather information there. Once we confirm my father is not in any of them, we can revisit this matter. However, I won't stop until I uncover the truth."" Over the next ten days, they examined several forts but found no English captives.

There were many hill forts scattered across the land, but the prisoners had all been put to death in the ones they visited. Despite this, Dick felt compelled to continue his search, driven by his mother's unwavering hope and his own conviction that his father was in Savandroog. Surajah agreed, believing they were destined to find Dick's father. Dick was then appointed to care for the wild beasts, a change that pleased him despite reducing his chances of returning to Savandroog. When Surajah was ordered to execute four English prisoners, Dick was relieved to be spared from the gruesome task.

That evening, as Dick walked through a corridor near the zenana, a young Indian girl knelt before him, expressing her gratitude for saving her from a tiger attack. She revealed her fears of being given away to a sultan's officer and hoped to be given to Dick instead. The girl shared her story of being in the palace for eight years and her dread of being forced into marriage. Dick felt compelled to save her from this fate, seeing it as a chance to make a difference amidst his search for his father.

"""I believe it's worth the effort, Surajah. Imagine the sorrow her parents feel at her absence and the joy of reuniting with her.

Suddenly they all began screaming, and ran, some to one side, some to the other, of the window; and I, who could not think what was the matter, remained where I was, when there was a great cry, and before I had time to move, or even to wonder, some great thing knocked me down.

At the set time, Dick informed Annie that they would depart the next morning. He and Surajah bid farewell to Pertaub, giving him a letter for Dick's aunt in Tripataly. They discussed the route to take, deciding on Caveripatam through Anicull and Ryacotta. Ibrahim was instructed to prepare the horses for an early start. They planned to leave unnoticed and reach the frontier before being missed. The next morning, they made final preparations, had breakfast, and saved some for Annie. Dick was confident they could cross the frontier without suspicion. Dick cut Annie's hair for a disguise, and she was to signal when ready. Surajah mounted his horse to keep watch, while Dick would see Annie through the gate before following.|"[""1.

Surajah agreed that it would be safest for the girl to be with Ibrahim to avoid suspicion. They planned a story in case they were questioned by Palace officers. Dick followed behind them discreetly as they passed through the Palace without drawing attention. He spoke to some officials on the way out, delaying to ensure Surajah's safe departure. Surajah was waiting on his horse across the river as Dick caught up. They decided to proceed rather than stop, preparing for the girl's lack of horse-riding experience. The group cantered towards a farmhouse, where they were met with surprise by the farmer. Dick assured Surajah they might be delayed and instructed him to return home if they weren't back by nine.

"Dick reassured the farmer with a smile, ""We're not here to take anything. We've just come for the two horses we purchased for our journey."" He then gave instructions to the farmer's daughter, Annie, on how to ride the pony comfortably. After saddling the horses, Dick explained to Annie how to balance herself with the roll of blankets in front. He also attached cords to the bridle so they could ride alongside her for support. With Surajah and Dick by her side, Annie felt more confident and comfortable on the horse. They then set off at an easy canter, with Dick explaining that they were going treasure hunting to retrieve caskets hidden earlier. Surajah and Ibrahim helped dig up the caskets, which were then securely strapped behind the saddles. After bidding farewell to the farmer, they rode out of the woods."|['1.

"He stepped off the horse, handed it to Ibrahim, and gently lifted Annie from her seat. As he placed her on the ground, she slipped down but was quickly caught by Dick and Surajah. They propped her against a tree to rest. ""You did great,"" Dick praised. ""Not many could ride as far as you did on their first time. Let's give you a sip of wine to relax."" After a short break, they prepared a comfortable seat on the horse for Annie. They decided to wait until dusk to continue their journey, ensuring Annie had some rest.

The blankets were secured onto the horses once more, the rest mounted, and they set off, initially walking out of the forest. Once on the road, the horses picked up into a canter. Annie groaned softly, keeping her eyes closed. Dick pulled her closer to him. Thirty minutes later, they passed through Sultanpetta. It was dark, but Dick knew they were moving swiftly, and the fact that he carried a boy in front of him would likely go unnoticed. If questioned, they could say the boy was unwell and they were in a hurry. After four more hours, they reached Conkanelly and crossed a bridge. Dick felt his horse tiring, so he stopped, helped Annie down, and changed horses. They planned to ride for four more hours before resting in a wood. Annie expressed her struggle to speak English, but found comfort in conversing with Dick. He encouraged her to rest, promising breakfast when they stopped.|['1.

"Before long, the gentle movement of the carriage lulled her back to sleep. She awoke around four in the morning as they entered a wood, about three or four miles away from Anicull. ""You've been sleeping like a log,"" Dick chuckled. ""I had to hold you at first, but you've been fine since we changed horses."" They gathered sticks while Surajah and Ibrahim tended to the horses. A fire was soon crackling, and they unpacked provisions. ""I've forgotten what coffee tastes like,"" Annie remarked. ""It's funny to drink something hot. I've only ever had water until yesterday when you gave me wine."" Dick explained, ""There's another drink called tea, but I prefer coffee.

Uncle, I didn't plan to rescue the white girl from the Palace, but when she thanked me for saving her from the tiger, I couldn't abandon her to Tippoo's officers. She was disguised as a boy, and we sneaked her out unnoticed. The journey was tough on her, not used to travel. I even had to carry her on my saddle when she couldn't walk. She was exhausted, but we made it. The English should have taken Tippoo down when they had the chance. It's clear he's not the rightful ruler. The girl is resting now, grateful for the rescue. She ate a bit and fell asleep. We'll hear her story in the morning.|"[""1.

Dick, not skilled in writing letters, kept his message to his mother brief, ensuring she knew he was safe. When Surajah and his father arrived, Dick recounted his adventures, pausing at the tiger incident for Surajah to add details. The discussion turned to the valuable jewels rescued from the harem, with estimates exceeding thousands of rupees. The Rajah praised Dick for his bravery and acknowledged the significant worth of the jewels, especially highlighting the diamonds, pearls, and rubies. The Rajah suggested the total value of the treasures could amount to a substantial sum, emphasizing the exceptional quality of the gems.|['1.

The Sultan's harem was filled with treasures from across southern India. Tippoo had amassed jewels from various regions, including Mysore, Coorg, Travancore, and the Carnatic. His collection was worth millions, yet he dressed modestly. The gifts bestowed upon Dick were likely from the harem, given his recent favor with the Sultan. Dick's training had honed his quickness and coolness, enabling him to navigate through challenges and earn rewards. His courage, combined with his skills, had led him to success. The story serves as a lesson on the importance of training and decisiveness. The Rajah emphasized the value of vigor and energy, traits inherited from Dick's English heritage. Annie Mansfield, rescued by Dick, recovered under Mrs. Holland's care and became part of the family. Dick informed Madras authorities about Annie's rescue, seeking information on her captor and her family's fate.|"[""1.

Annie felt anxious about receiving the answer. Her life as a former slave contrasted with her current happy life, making her hesitant about any changes. She had no memory of her parents but felt a strong bond with Mrs. Holland. Annie enjoyed the simplicity in the Rajah's household and got along well with the boys, especially Dick. He encouraged Annie to learn to read and write, preparing her for meeting her own people in the future. Dick shared his plans to search for his father, emphasizing the importance of Annie's education. Two days before Dick and Surajah left, they received a reply confirming that Annie was the daughter of Colonel Mansfield. Plans were made to reunite her with her father in England.

Annie, a former slave, is now adjusting to her newfound freedom. Her kind nature and quick intelligence are shining through as she settles in with her new family. Despite her past struggles, she is beginning to show her true spirit. Her fair complexion, expressive eyes, and graceful figure suggest that she will grow into a lovely young woman. Her caretaker, expressing a motherly affection, is committed to educating her and preparing her for a bright future.

They bought supplies for the journey and loaded them onto the pack horse along with goods from Amboor. New pack horses were brought to the trader's, and the goods from Seringapatam were packed on them. Then they rode off slowly, with the pack animals following Ibrahim's horse in a line. They had discussed revisiting Savandroog to search for a white captive. Despite the lack of a clear reason, Dick felt strongly about returning. They planned to disguise themselves as traders to move around unnoticed and gather information. To avoid being recognized, they got false beards and experimented with face paint. Surajah wore a padded vest to appear elderly and fat. After riding for a few miles, they stopped in a grove to rest before reaching Savandroog the next day.|['1.

Thirty minutes later, a group of twelve men, heading in the same direction as Surajah and Dick, paused and joined them under the trees. The apparent leader of the group approached them. Surajah welcomed them, stating that the woods were open to all. The trader mentioned recognizing Surajah from Bangalore and expressed curiosity about their shared route. Surajah explained their journey to Outradroog and Seringapatam, warning about the dangers of travelling alone due to disbanded soldiers turned bandits. The trader, seemingly friendly, engaged in conversation about trade goods. Despite the trader's respectable appearance, Dick remained cautious, recalling warnings of Thugs disguising as traders. Ready for any situation, Dick instructed Ibrahim to stay vigilant while cooking, keeping weapons at hand. The other group shared provisions without lighting a fire.

As Dick spoke, he noticed a few others gathering around, listening and occasionally chiming in. Feeling uneasy, he discreetly gripped one of his hidden pistols. Suddenly, Ibrahim cried out, and something flashed in front of Dick's face. Reacting swiftly, he fired at two assailants, saving Surajah. Amid the chaos, Surajah fired shots too, and Ibrahim joined the fray, protecting his comrades. The situation escalated as more enemies closed in. Dick and Surajah fought back, each taking down attackers. In the heat of battle, Dick's quick thinking and sharp aim saved them from a group of Thugs.

The following morning, Dick and Surajah worked diligently to perfect their disguises. They had previously appeared as well-to-do young traders, but now they added ample beards securely attached with adhesive wax, along with patches of hair to conceal any edges. Grey hair tufts were added to their eyebrows and lines drawn on their faces. After darkening their skin and donning additional disguises, they felt confident no one would recognize them. Ibrahim helped with the transformation and stayed behind in the woods to avoid suspicion. Dick had a strong silken cord wound under his garments. They approached the fort gate as merchants offering a variety of goods. The officer sent word to the governor for permission. They were blindfolded and led up the steep road to the commander's quarters where their goods were inspected. The old officer welcomed them, anticipating a successful trade due to the uniqueness of their offerings.|"['1.

The packages were brought inside, and the soldiers left. Shortly after, the commander's wife, accompanied by a few other ladies, entered the room. Dick and Surajah, showing respect by bowing, began to unpack their goods. The selection was well-chosen, and after months without shopping, the ladies were eager to explore. They lifted their veils, settled on cushions, and chatted while examining the silks. Surajah initially quoted prices from labels but eventually lowered them. It took hours for the ladies to decide on purchases. The delicate muslins were also displayed, but the trinkets remained unopened. The governor's wife declined, saying they had spent enough. Permission was granted to sell to soldiers later. Food was provided, and sales commenced until sunset. Soldiers and locals crowded the room. While Surajah sold, Dick handled the money. When a man asked for tobacco, Dick looked up and was shocked to see a European man, possibly resembling his father but weathered by hardship.|"[""1.

In the bustling market, Dick and Surajah were busy selling their goods to eager customers. As the day drew to a close, Surajah politely informed the crowd that they would resume selling the next day. Excited chatter filled the air as the customers dispersed, looking forward to returning. Alone with Dick, Surajah revealed his surprise at recognizing a white man among the customers. Dick suspected the man might be his long-lost father, and they made plans for the man's return the next day. Surajah's hope reignited as he contemplated the possibility of finding Dick's father.

""It is not quite eight o'clock yet, but as I found that you were both out, I began to be afraid that you might be detained until after I had to go; and you don't know how I long for a pipe of that tobacco. The very thought of it seems to bring old days back again.""

By this time they had entered the house, and Dick shut the door behind him. He had left a light burning when they went out. Dick was so agitated that he felt unable to speak but gazed earnestly in the man's face.

""My name is Jack Holland,"" he said, ""sure enough; though how you come to know it beats me altogether, for I am always called Jack, and except the governor, I don't think there is a man here knows my other name.""

""Neither of us, Father. I am disguised as an old man, but really I am little more than eighteen.

When a peace treaty was signed, Kistnagherry was surrendered, and the governor was instructed to leave the area and relocate here. To avoid drawing attention, I had to disguise myself as a native by dyeing my face during the journey.

The Nizam, hesitant due to French influence, eventually accepted English aid.

The ruler, known as the Nizam, had to make a tough decision. He had to either openly support the French or send them away. He chose the latter. The French leader, Peron, realized the dire situation of his troops and agreed to be dismissed. However, the soldiers were in revolt, forcing the officers to escape under the cover of darkness. The next day, the English and Nizam's forces surrounded the French camp, leading to their surrender without a fight. While negotiations with the Mahrattis were fruitless due to internal conflicts, it was clear that dealing with Mysore alone was necessary. Despite preparing for conflict, Lord Mornington aimed to avoid war and sought peaceful resolutions. Tippoo, the Sultan of Mysore, received letters from Buonaparte, but the Governor General saw through the deceit and prepared for action with a large army assembled at Vellore. Captain Dick, well-versed in local affairs, was appointed to General Harris's staff, ready for the impending conflict.|"['1. What tough decision did the Nizam have to make in the text?\nA.

The Rajah had been to Madras a month earlier, introducing himself and his sons to General Harris, expressing his loyalty to the English. The general welcomed his cavalry's support. On February 11, 1799, the army moved towards Tippoo's territory, avoiding the expected Amboor pass. By March 9, they were 80 miles east of his capital. The Mysorean army remained unseen. Tippoo's troops attacked a Bombay force, but the English repelled them. Tippoo then faced the main British army at Malavilly. The British cavalry and infantry defeated Tippoo's troops, forcing them to retreat. General Harris outmaneuvered Tippoo, reaching Seringapatam by April 5.

The advisors shared the Sultan's pessimistic outlook. They had opposed the war, cautioned against trusting the French, and disagreed with measures that would provoke the English. Despite this, the Sultan proceeded independently. The British forces attacked the enemy's positions, driving them back. General Floyd led the cavalry to meet the Bombay force. General Stuart commanded the Bombay force, crossing to the north bank to flank Tippoo's defenses. Tippoo attempted negotiations, but General Harris demanded territories, payment, and hostages. Tippoo's despondency grew as the siege intensified. The British breached the fort's wall, preparing for an assault. General Baird led the assault, swiftly capturing the fort.

During the battle, the Mysoreans faced a tough situation when they were attacked from both sides. Caught between the British troops and the reinforcements arriving from the right column, they lost their courage and became disorganized. Many were shot down as they tried to escape through the river gate. General Baird, after capturing the rampart, sent an officer with a flag of truce to the Palace to offer protection to Tippoo and his family if they surrendered. Tippoo's sons claimed he wasn't in the Palace, but he was eventually found wounded and dead in a gateway. The British soldiers, angered by the massacre of their fellow soldiers, showed restraint. The siege resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, with a significant capture of treasure and weapons. Later, Dick, grateful for the kindness shown to his father, helped secure the release of an old officer who had saved his father's life.|"['1.

After leaving, the soldier expressed gratitude that his days of fighting against the English were over. He acknowledged that Tippoo, his former master, had brought ruin to Mysore through cruelty and ambition. The capture of Seringapatam led to the submission of the entire region.
