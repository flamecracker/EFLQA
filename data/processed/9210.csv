Gather around, children, and let's add another log to the fire on this Thanksgiving night. The flames should dance high, sending sparks into the darkness. Toss on some dry oak chips, remnants of the Mermaid's knee-timbers, and let the blaze illuminate our cottage. The light should rival the glow of the neighboring houses. Listen to the distant surf; its murmur should reach us, though the tide is high. As I gaze at you all by the fire, the past seems to merge with the present. Memories flood back, and I see a younger version of myself reflected in the flames. Speak to me, Susan, my beloved ones. The scene flickers before my eyes, and I fear losing these precious memories. I am grateful for my old age, away from the vanities of the past. Come closer, Susan, stand in the full glow of the fire. I see you illuminated, a vision of warmth and comfort. Do you remember the twilight on the bridge by King's Beach? The wind, the waves, the crimson clouds; you were like a sea-bird, dancing in the breeze. You were a creature of the ocean, a mermaid of the north, and I longed to roam with you on secluded beaches. But in the end, I am glad you are just a pretty young girl, battling the wind around your petticoats.|"['1.

When I first met Susan, I painted her image in my mind with vivid colors, imagining her in a thousand different ways before truly seeing her. Now, let's take a closer look at our village. It was a small cluster of homes that appeared as if they had been washed ashore by the sea, surrounded by seaweed and marine plants. The village sat snugly between the beach and a rocky hill, with a narrow sandy street winding through it. The buildings, though varied, were all simple and rustic. Boat-houses, cottages, and a shoemaker's shop lined the streets, while fishermen in their distinctive attire of red shirts and oilcloth trousers frequented the two grocery stores at the village center. The air was always fishy, filled with the scent of the sea and the catch of the day. As I reminisce about the village, I recall my days as a fisherman, venturing out to sea in my skiff to haul in cod, haddock, and halibut. The ocean was my playground, and the thrill of the hunt was shared with the sea-gulls and loons. Even on stormy days, when the waves crashed against the shore and the wind howled, I found solace in the tales of Uncle Parker, a seasoned sailor with stories of battles, shipwrecks, and adventures on the high seas.

In the village center, a window displayed gingerbread, picture-books, and trinkets for young fishermen. Susan, a slender maiden with brown hair and freckles, exuded charm. Her carefree yet right actions and bright spirit captivated all. Nature made her simple, kind-hearted, and mirthful. I cherished how her warmth mingled with mine, kindling a domestic fire.
