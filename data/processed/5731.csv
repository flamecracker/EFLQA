"Mrs. Farrington chuckled. ""Sure, it's clean, dear,"" she said. ""Only on land do we deal with dust. The sea can get rough, not just calm like tonight."" The group moved to the bright saloon where passengers gathered after dinner. The room was lavish with comfy chairs, sofas, and gilt-framed tables for card games. Patty noticed writing desks and bookcases filled with favorites. The captain suggested supper before bed, and Patty happily nibbled on a caviar sandwich. The French captain, with a black mustache, welcomed Patty warmly. After a tiring day, the girls were ready for bed. They slept soundly and woke to a sunny day.

"Patty had expected a quiet morning of reading by the ocean on the steamer. Instead, she found herself caught up in a whirlwind of activity as two lively girls, Alicia and Doris, introduced themselves and expressed a desire to be friends. Despite their unconventional manner of speaking, Patty and her chum Elise decided to give the Van Ness sisters a chance. The group of girls chatted and laughed, getting to know each other better.

Patty was taken aback by the peculiar behavior of the unfamiliar girls and clearly showed her disapproval. She ignored the young men and gave the Van Ness sisters a disapproving look while Elise appeared uneasy. Alicia clarified that the two boys were their cousins, Bob and Guy Van Ness, traveling under their parents' supervision. They were introduced to Miss Farrington and Miss Fairfield. Patty and Elise shared a love for outdoor activities, which they discovered the Van Ness girls also enjoyed. They met Florrie Nash, an English girl, who was more approachable than they anticipated. Patty met Bert Chester, a friendly Englishman, and Pierre Pauvret, a French violinist. Patty tried to engage Pauvret in conversation and found his enthusiasm when discussing music. Later, everyone rushed to the side of the boat to see a passing porpoise, following tradition. Patty's perception of Chester changed as she found him witty and engaging. They then observed a distant steamer on the horizon, a sight that intrigued the passengers.|"[""1.

"Patty playfully remarked, ""That's not a real steamer; it's just a colorful print. I've seen these in steamship offices before. Even though it's not framed like usual, it's unmistakably a chromo. The bright colors and poorly painted smoke give it away."" Young Chester chuckled, praising Patty's keen eye. Later, at a musical gathering, Patty showcased her sweet soprano alongside Elise's clear contralto, earning compliments. The night was filled with songs, laughter, and music. Patty missed her tablemate, Ma'amselle, who was seasick. The captain assured she'd recover soon and enjoy the music. Patty found joy in the company of the Chicago youth, especially the warm-hearted Van Ness girls and their lively cousins. However, the reserved English girl, Florrie, puzzled Patty. Florrie invited Patty and Elise to visit her in England, praising its beauty in spring. Patty defended Florrie, suggesting she should be more open-minded."|"[""1.

Florrie spoke humbly about her lovely home, sharing stories of the animals and pets on the estate, captivating Patty with her enthusiasm. Patty, kind to the old ma'amselle, spent time entertaining her but also valued her own time. The old lady, alone except for her maid, enjoyed Patty's company. One day, she surprised Patty with a beautiful old necklace, insisting she accept it as a gift. Patty hesitated but eventually kept it. When seeking Mrs. Farrington's advice, she was encouraged to accept the gift. The old lady invited Patty to visit her chateau in St. Germain. During a storm on their journey, Patty, Elise, and the Van Ness brothers braved the deck in bright yellow rain gear, facing the fierce wind and rain with laughter and excitement.|"['1.

Patty stood between the two boys, feeling brave as they faced the storm on the ship's bow. The sea and sky merged into a gray blur as rain poured down. The ocean roared and waves crashed against the ship. Patty, in her white and blue dress with a necklace and a white rose in her hair, sat with the boys, watching the turbulent sea. They battled the wind on deck until Patty sat exhausted on a rope coil. The group sang and performed on the ship, with Patty shining in tableaux and musical numbers.

The journey continued as the captain was delighted with a comical gift from passengers. The steamer made stops at Plymouth and Havre, where excitement filled the air.

The Ritz hotel, once a palace, awaited them. Patty admired the dignified Farringtons and noticed contrasts with the Van Ness family. Arriving in Paris, the station was chaotic. Patty observed the struggles of fellow travelers, especially a lady in need of help.

Mr. Farrington finally succeeded after a delay, and the official ceremonies ended swiftly. The travelers, claiming they carried no food, were permitted to depart in open cabs, a new sight for Patty. The first cab held Mr. and Mrs. Farrington, with Patty and Elise in the following one alongside Lisette. As they drove through the dim but not dark evening in Paris, the grand square with its colonnaded buildings and central column left Patty in awe. She marveled at the solemnity, contrasting her expectation of Paris being bright and festive. Elise explained the historical significance of the surroundings, such as Napoleon atop the column. The group arrived at the Hotel Ritz, where they were warmly welcomed by a courteous French proprietor. The hotel's exquisite décor fascinated Patty, who felt like she was in a fairy tale.

The room where the two girls stayed was a spacious double-bedded apartment with dressing rooms and a bath nearby. It was comfortable, luxurious, and beautiful. When Lisette came in to help the girls get ready for dinner, she found them gazing out of the front windows at the Vendome Column. It was still warm enough to dine outside due to the late season. Patty was captivated by the enchanting scene in the garden. The stone-paved court was adorned with large old trees, flower-beds, and colorful lights hanging from the branches. An immense fountain surrounded by statues added to the magical atmosphere. The garden was filled with people, including French men and women in elegant attire and visitors from other countries. Patty was initially so engrossed in the view that she didn't feel hungry, but upon tasting the delicious French cuisine, she changed her mind and enjoyed the meal. Later, Mr. Farrington guided them through the beautiful streets of Paris, starting from the Place Vendome and passing by landmarks like the Rue de Rivoli, the Tuileries garden, and the Place de la Concorde.|['1.

Patty expressed her fondness for the quaint French villages with their narrow streets and lively dogs. She remarked that dogs in French villages are always ready to bark at passing cars, attributing it to their duty. Despite the dogs, the villages were charming, and Patty enjoyed driving slowly through them to catch glimpses of local life. The streets were narrow and steep, making it necessary to drive cautiously. Patty joked about the perpetual uphill roads in France, observing that it always seemed like an uphill journey. As they approached Versailles, Patty was in awe of the historical significance of the Chateau. She marveled at the grandeur of the royal courtyard and the Equestrian Statue of Louis XIV.

Quickly, they moved through the museum's rooms, stopping occasionally for closer looks.

As they strolled down Rue de Rivoli, Patty and her friends admired the trinkets in the shop windows. Lisette, their companion, didn't mind their lingering. Patty advised Elise against buying too many items at once, suggesting that the joy lies in collecting slowly. Patty decided to purchase unique desk items for her family. In a shop, they found a tiny Napoleon statue that amused them. Patty planned to have a seal made with Marian's monogram.

The crowd followed Doris and Alicia's lead at the Louvre, where Patty learned a lot from their discussions. She discovered historical relics were more fascinating than she thought. As they left, Lisette insisted they go home due to Parisian customs, which the girls found odd. Patty agreed to follow the rules. The next day, they shopped and visited other places. Patty wrote letters home and shared her adventures. The Farringtons searched for a winter rental without the girls. Mr. Farrington suggested a trip to Chantilly with Lisette. They quickly got ready and joined a guided tour. Elise found the tour fun and enjoyed the high seats. Patty planned to study French and history once they settled in a new home.|"[""1.

In Chantilly, Patty and Elise marveled at the historic Hotel du Grand-Conde, where they lunched. Patty, intrigued by French history, shared her fascination with La Grande Mademoiselle. As they mingled with fellow tourists, they learned much from their conversations. The day took a playful turn when they fed French rolls to the lively carp in the garden. The girls were amused by the fish's antics, especially a sulky one and a mischievous troublemaker. Despite the guided tour's regimented feel, the beauty of Chantilly's Chateau shone through. Patty's interest was piqued by a gallery of battle paintings depicting the Grand Conde's victories. The tour continued through various galleries and salons, including the Chapel with its solemn Cippus holding the hearts of Conde princes.|"['1.

Soon, the megaphone signaled the start of the journey back home. Patty and Elise were quick to board the large motor car. Patty realized she didn't have a postcard of her friend, the Grand Prince. The postcard seller didn't have it but tried to find it from another vendor nearby. The search was unsuccessful, leading to a frenzy among tourists demanding the same card. The price skyrocketed, turning the situation into an auction. Patty and Elise found the chaos amusing. Mr. Farrington mentioned their success in securing a place to stay. Mrs. Farrington discussed furnishing the house, planning to take the prettiest items back to America. Patty and Elise were excited about decorating their rooms. Patty's touch made the rooms cozy and welcoming. They enjoyed their first family dinner in their new home, feeling comfortable and at ease.

Twice a week, a professor came to teach singing to Elise, while she had drawing lessons at the same time. Although Elise didn't show great promise in art, her parents encouraged her talent for her enjoyment and that of her friends. Elise and her friend Patty developed a keen interest in French history, studying diligently and reading history books outside of school. They often spent time with the Barstows, enjoying drives in the Bois and visiting galleries. Attending the Opera was a highlight for Patty, who also learned to drive a motor-car with Mr. Farrington's guidance. Patty, Elise, and Rosamond celebrated Christmas together and later visited Ma'amselle Labesse's chateau, marveling at its grandeur and historical significance. The girls were awestruck by the chateau's opulent hall filled with art, statues, and ancient armor.|"['1.

A grand staircase spiraled upwards, leading the girls to their room at Ma'amselle's suggestion. French maids arrived to help with their belongings, and Patty was relieved to communicate in French. Rosamond, determined as ever, dismissed the maids in her imperfect French, wanting time alone with the girls. Excited by the castle's splendor, they planned to dress their best. Patty felt like a princess in the room, adorned with chintz tapestry. Rosamond joked about the elaborate bed, preferring a cozy corner. Elise urged them to get ready, appreciating the view of the terraced lawn. Ma'amselle, content in her ancestral home, shared her joy in solitude with the girls.|"['1.

"""But I am not always alone,"" she continued; ""no, it is that my Henri, my nephew, comes to me occasionally. And he arrives soon. New Year's Day always brings him. He spends the day with me. He brings me joy. And you will meet him, you young ladies. Ah, how handsome he is!"" The old lady clasped her hands and looked up, and the girls were almost convinced that her nephew was truly remarkable. While not exactly embarrassed, the girls were somewhat awed by the unusual splendor around them. Rosamond found it amusing that three young American girls were esteemed guests in such a grand household; Elise found it fascinating, and the novelty of it all left a strong impression on her. Patty, as usual, adapted quickly to the situation, feeling at ease. The elaborately dressed footmen standing behind their chairs like statues, only moving when needed, almost made Rosamond giggle; but to Patty, they were simply part of the spectacle, and once accepted as such, they fit right into the scene. Rosamond was impressed by what she saw as Patty's boldness and decided to match her energy, aiming to be lively and engaging. With Elise being quite talkative, the three girls provided much amusement, and their hostess was thrilled with her delightful guests.

"""Long live the flag!"" exclaimed Rosamond, and then the girls, inspired by Patty, sang the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" with genuine American enthusiasm and patriotism. They followed this with the ""Marseillaise,"" but their song was cut short by the arrival of a maid in a state of great excitement. ""Ah, my children,"" she cried, ""I bring dreadful news! My dear nephew, Henri, has broken his arm! Such sadness for the poor boy. I must fly to him immediately in Paris. Please forgive my sudden departure, but I must go to him!""

Patty was in a rush, her mind racing with thoughts. She felt it was a terrible idea to let Ma'amselle go to Paris on a futile trip. She decided to act swiftly. With a commanding look, she instructed Elise to stay and play hostess while she took Rosamond to stop Ma'amselle. Despite the lack of knowledge about cars, Patty found a touring car in the garage. Determined, she took the wheel and sped off to catch Ma'amselle before her train. With Rosamond by her side, Patty navigated the roads with a mix of excitement and nervousness.

Henri's disabled arm, instead of hindering his movements, added a unique grace to his dance. He appeared like a victorious knight, leading his partner Patty with elegance. The audience cheered as they finished their dance, and Henri escorted Patty to his aunt, Ma'amselle. Ma'amselle, touched by the moment, kissed Patty and was moved to tears. Patty, in a gesture of kindness, crowned Ma'amselle and declared her queen, while Patty took the role of the first lady in waiting. The scene was so picturesque that many wished it could be painted. The festival ended early at Ma'amselle's request, and the children were sent to bed with a reminder not to rise before noon the next day.
