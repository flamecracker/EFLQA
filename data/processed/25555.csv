A brave fisherman, armed with magical tools, saved a princess from a terrible curse. As they flew to the palace on a magic carpet, they found everyone in an enchanted slumber. The king paused mid-toast, servants with unfinished tales, and laborers frozen in their work. The fisherman, with the princess, sought to break the spell. Using a golden guzla, they played enchanting music that restored health, happiness, and broke curses. The fisherman's invisible cap helped him sneak past guards to claim the guzla. Together, they flew across the sky, arriving at the palace, but the enchantment still held the people. The land lay silent and still, trapped in a deep sleep, awaiting the magic of the guzla to awaken them.|['1.

The melody of the guzla filled the air, awakening everything around. The king's toast was completed, the chamberlain's story ended, and the guests continued their merriment. Meanwhile, the servants remained diligent at their posts. Simultaneously, the entire country stirred to life: laborers tended to their fields, haymakers stacked hay, reapers harvested grain, and hunters pursued their prey. The scene was one of bustling activity, with trees rustling, gardeners singing, and the wealthy indulging in opulence. Amidst this commotion, the king was astonished to see his daughter with the fisherman. However, upon learning of the fisherman's heroic deeds, the king's heart softened. The princess, bound by a vow, challenged the fisherman with a riddle, which he successfully solved. Overjoyed, the princess and the fisherman knelt before the king, who blessed their union.

Once upon a time, in a distant land, a king had a daughter who was not only stunning but also incredibly smart. Many kings and princes sought her hand in marriage, but she refused them all. The king declared that whoever could keep watch over her for three nights without her escaping would win her hand. Many tried and failed, losing their heads in the process. Then, a young and brave prince named Matthias decided to take on the challenge. Despite his father's objections, Matthias set out with three unique companions: Broad, who could swell to fit a whole regiment inside him, Tall, who could stretch to the clouds with each step, and a man named _Quick_.

Matthias was amazed by the beauty of the princess, and she welcomed him warmly. While they conversed, Broad lay at the threshold, Tall and the Man with Eyes of Flame stood by the window. As Matthias observed the princess closely, she transformed into a dove and tried to escape. However, Tall's hair was brushed by her wing, awakening him. The Man with Eyes of Flame sent a fiery glance after her, burning her wings. Tall caught her, and she transformed back into a princess. The next morning, the king found his daughter with Matthias and entertained them. On the third night, the king asked his daughter to use her magic to rid them of the intruders.

Once upon a time, a young man named Matthias won the heart of a princess with his courtesy, strength, and beauty. The king, however, was not pleased with their love and sent soldiers to bring them back.

Once upon a time, there was an elderly king and a young queen who dearly loved each other but were unhappy because they had no children. The queen fell ill from sorrow, so the doctors advised her to travel. Accompanied by twelve beautiful maids of honor, she set off on a journey. After days of travel, they found themselves on a vast plain that seemed to touch the sky. Despite their efforts, the carriage kept returning to a large stone column. The queen, in frustration, allowed a warrior on horseback to kiss her, along with her maids. Suddenly, the stone column and the warrior vanished, and they continued their journey. When the queen and her maids returned, they were gifted with thirteen baby girls by the Spirit of the Steppes. The king was astonished, and the palace was filled with light as the babies opened their eyes brightly.

Once upon a time, a king, filled with anger, ordered that all the babies in the kingdom be thrown into the sea. The courtiers were on their way to carry out this cruel command when the queen, pale and weeping, intervened. She begged the king to spare the innocent children and instead have them placed on a desert island under God's care. The king granted her plea. The baby princess and her companions were taken to the island and left alone. Despite fears that they would perish, the children thrived under God's protection. The princess grew in beauty and grace, surrounded by her devoted companions. Sudolisu's loveliness attracted suitors from near and far, but none could win her heart. When an ogre named Kostey tried to take her by force, the princess's powerful gaze turned him into ice. The ogre, determined to possess her, enchanted the town and her maids, setting a dragon to guard her palace.

Days passed, and Princess Sudolisu's kingdom remained in a deep slumber. The streets were empty, the army lay asleep in the fields, covered by grass and shadow. Inside the palace, the maids of honor and the princess herself were motionless. The princess, feeling lonely and miserable, longed for the prince of her dreams to rescue her. One day, the sun spoke to her, assuring her that the prince was on his way to save her. The sun instructed the prince, Junak, to seek the advice of the witch, old Yaga, to defeat the sorcerer Kostey and rescue Princess Sudolisu. The sun guided Prince Junak to find a horse and an invisible club hidden behind an iron door in the east.

The prince received surprising advice that left him unsure of what to do. After much thought, he made a bold decision. He removed a magical ring from his finger and threw it into the sea. Instantly, the army disappeared, and he set off on a journey to the east. After eight days of walking, he arrived at a vast green plain with three oak trees. In the middle, he found an iron door with a copper handle. Beyond the door, a winding staircase led to another iron door secured by a heavy padlock. As he approached, he heard a horse neigh and saw eleven more iron doors open. Before him stood a magnificent war-horse that had been enchanted centuries ago. The prince mounted the horse, grasped an invisible club attached to the saddle, and they embarked on a remarkable journey. The horse, agile and powerful, obeyed the prince's commands without needing to be directed. Together, they soared through the air, crossed mountains and rivers effortlessly, and arrived near a vast forest where Yaga's house awaited. The prince called out, and Yaga emerged to offer assistance and guidance. She shared crucial information with the prince, revealing the key to defeating Kostey, a formidable foe. The prince learned that on the Island of Eternal Life lay an oak tree, housing an egg within a duck, which held Kostey's life.

Junak rode his horse swiftly towards the Island of Eternal Life after saving the fish in distress. Upon reaching the island, he uprooted a tree to find a hidden coffer. Inside, he found a hare and an egg. Startled by the grey duck that flew off, he shot it, causing it to drop the egg into the sea. Distraught, Junak was surprised when the fish he saved earlier brought back the lost egg. Grateful for his kindness, the fish vanished into the water. Junak, filled with hope, journeyed towards the Enchanted Palace where Princess Sudolisu was guarded by the Dragon with Twelve Heads.

Once upon a time, a princess of unparalleled beauty lived in seclusion within her palace. Her radiance was like the moon, her lips as rosy as a rose, and her voice and gaze held an enchanting allure. For seventeen years, she remained hidden from the world, bringing joy to her parents and all who served her. No prince or noble was allowed near her chambers until one day, the sound of a cuckoo's cry stirred something within her.

The princess was thrilled when she finally stepped outside her palace, but her joy turned to fear when a fierce hurricane whisked her away.
