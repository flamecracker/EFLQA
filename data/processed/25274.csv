Rollo was a young boy, around five or six years old, working in his garden. His father had given him a small plot to plant corn, but when it didn't sprout, Rollo decided to plant beans instead. While digging holes for the beans, he heard a noise and saw a strange head peering over the garden wall. Startled, he ran towards the house. His father, leading a horse named Elkin, calmed him down. Rollo watched as Elkin ate oats from a basket, realizing the horse was gentle. Rollo's fear turned into admiration for the beautiful animal. His father then led the horse towards the house as Rollo ran to meet them.|"[""1.

The father explained to Rollo that the horse needed to be taught to work correctly, just like a boy needs to learn various commands. Rollo, riding the horse, spotted a bird's nest and asked his father to stop. His father allowed him to investigate the nest gently. Afterward, Rollo was supposed to pick up chips in the yard, but he got distracted building a house with them. His mother intervened, providing him with a basket to collect the chips. Rollo eventually started picking up the chips but got sidetracked by the large, square ones, attempting to build a house. By the time he returned to work with Jonas, a considerable amount of time had passed. Jonas explained that if Rollo worked steadily, he could finish the task in an hour.|"[""1.

Jonas went to the field, leaving Rollo with his thirty baskets. Rollo wanted to finish before his father returned, so he hurriedly filled his basket with large chips, leaving empty spaces. The basket felt light when he carried it. He then decided to use a wheelbarrow, thinking it would be easier. He wasted time looking at the wheelbarrow, struggled to move it, and took a long time to fill it. When he tried to lift the full wheelbarrow, it tipped over, leaving Rollo frustrated. He considered giving up but felt ashamed at his lack of progress. Eventually, he got stuck with the wheelbarrow and realized he should have stuck to using the basket. It was a lesson in the importance of sticking to what you know and not giving up when faced with challenges.|"['1.

Rollo, a boy who preferred seeking help over working alone, abandoned his wheelbarrow when it got stuck. He first asked Mary for help, but she couldn't assist immediately. Rollo then sought his mother's aid, who agreed to help him but advised him to work independently next time. Despite this, Rollo continued struggling with his load until he reached a platform and couldn't proceed due to a high step. Left to his own devices, he decided to switch to piling wood instead of picking up chips. As he began arranging the wood, he got distracted by a herd of cattle passing by. While watching, Rollo noticed Jonas, a man from the herd, trying to retrieve their cow. After successfully separating the cow, Jonas instructed Rollo to open a gate and run away.|"['1.

Rollo was busy piling wood in the shed when Jonas hurried after a cow that had wandered off. Jonas quickly checked Rollo's work and advised him to place the larger ends of the sticks outward to prevent the pile from falling. Rollo pondered over this instruction as he continued stacking the wood. Confused by the advice, Rollo experimented with different orientations of the sticks but couldn't figure out why the pile was becoming unsteady. As he added one more stick, the entire pile started to wobble dangerously. Just in time, Rollo jumped back as the pile collapsed. Reflecting on his behavior, Rollo realized that he often acted like a nuisance during family rides, unlike his cousin Lucy, who behaved calmly and considerately. Rollo decided to emulate Lucy's behavior to enjoy more pleasant outings with his family.|"['1.

Rollo listened quietly. He remembered the trouble he caused his parents during rides, unaware of his behavior. Without mentioning it to Jonas, he decided to follow Jonas's advice on their next ride. Soon, his parents noticed a positive change in his manners. Rollo became a delightful companion, as Jonas had predicted. His parents enjoyed having him by their side during rides. They even planned to have a special seat made for him in the chaise. The corporal, an ex-soldier known for his craftsmanship, was the one to make the seat. Rollo and his father set off to visit the corporal that evening. The corporal's shop was nestled among trees near a mill by the stream. Rollo watched with fascination as the corporal worked on mending a chair-bottom. Rollo even had fun wheeling a wheelbarrow along the road, imagining having one of his own.|"[""1.

Rollo's father called him, and he obediently returned the wheelbarrow. He expressed his liking for it to the corporal but refrained from asking his father for one, hoping his father would decide on his own. His father then challenged Rollo to work steadily without distractions for an hour. The next morning, Rollo's father assigned him the task of sorting nails of different sizes. Initially, Rollo found it easy but soon grew bored and felt lonely in the barn. His father emphasized the importance of patient industry and perseverance.

Rollo was distracted by a handful of screws, laying them out to compare sizes instead of working diligently. He wandered off to ask his father what to do with them, taking his time to observe grasshoppers and butterflies along the way. Upon returning, Rollo's father noticed his lack of progress and scolded him for idling. Realizing Rollo needed guidance, his father decided to assign him straightforward tasks to instill a sense of industry. He emphasized the importance of focusing on work diligently, even if it's not entertaining, to achieve a sense of accomplishment. Rollo was encouraged to find satisfaction in completing tasks, rather than seeking constant amusement. His father aimed to teach Rollo the value of dedicated work over fleeting enjoyment.|"['1.

"One day, Rollo's father suggested they talk to the corporal about a wheelbarrow. Rollo decided to go for it himself. His mother allowed him to bring his cousin James along. They walked towards the bridge, then to James' house, and back to the bridge. On their way to the mill, they discussed the wheelbarrow. In the corporal's shop, they saw various tools and a green wheelbarrow. James tried it and liked it. Later, they played with sand by the brook, building cities and roads. They decided to haul sand to ""market"" using their wheelbarrows. The boys gathered flowers on the way and decorated their loads."|"[""1.

The boys had a spot on their path called the quagmire, always muddy except for one wet and miry section. They managed to cross it with their wheelbarrows filled with sand. Rollo's mother, hearing them, inquired about the sand's quality. She suggested using it for a sand-garden, as flowers wouldn't grow well in it. The boys agreed to get more sand to cover a larger area, envisioning building cities there one day. They worked diligently, James less so than Rollo, who advised him to keep going. After collecting a heap of sand, they smoothed it out with a rake and hoe. Upon returning home, they explained their muddy shoes to Rollo's father, who explained the difference between work and play. He suggested filling the quagmire with stones and gravel to create a causeway.|"[""Question 1: What did Rollo's mother suggest using the sand for?\na) Building a sandcastle\nb) Filling the quagmire with sand\nc) Creating a sand-garden\nd) Using it as a play area\ne) Selling it to neighbors"", 'Question 2: What did the boys envision building in the area they covered with sand?\na) A swimming pool\nb) A playground\nc) A sandcastle\nd) A garden\ne) Cities', ""Question 3: Who worked more diligently between James and Rollo?\na) James\nb) Rollo\nc) They worked equally\nd) Rollo's mother\ne) Rollo's father"", ""Question 4: How did Rollo's father suggest improving the quagmire?\na) Filling it with water\nb) Planting trees around it\nc) Covering it with sand\nd) Filling it with stones and gravel\ne) Leaving it as it is"", ""Question 5: What did Rollo's father explain to the boys upon their return home?\na) The importance of playing outside\nb) The difference between work and play\nc) How to build a sandcastle\nd) Why flowers don't grow well in muddy soil\ne) How to use a rake and hoe"", 'Question 6: What did the boys use to smooth out the heap of sand they collected?\na) Shovel and bucket\nb) Rake and hoe\nc) Wheelbarrows\nd) Stones and gravel\ne) Water and mud']"|['c) Creating a sand-garden', 'e) Cities', 'b) Rollo', 'd) Filling it with stones and gravel', 'b) The difference between work and play', 'b) Rake and hoe']
At tea, Rollo's father shared a plan with them. He offered to pay them a cent for every two loads of stones or gravel they brought in to build a causeway. After tea, they searched for Jonas, finding him outside. Jonas explained that they should use old boards to avoid getting muddy while stepping on the quagmire. They were instructed to wheel stones in wheelbarrows, not tipping them down at the start of the muddy area. They were to walk carefully on the boards, empty the loads at the end, turn around, and draw the wheelbarrows out without interfering with each other. Jonas suggested using boards to create a stable path for the stones, gradually filling up the quagmire.|"[""Question 1: What did Rollo's father offer to pay them for bringing in loads of stones or gravel?\nA) Two cents for every load\nB) One cent for every load\nC) One cent for every three loads\nD) Two cents for every three loads\nE) Three cents for every load"", 'Question 2: Where did they find Jonas after tea?\nA) Inside the house\nB) In the kitchen\nC) Outside the house\nD) In the garden\nE) Near the fireplace', 'Question 3: What did Jonas suggest they use to avoid getting muddy while stepping on the quagmire?\nA) Stones\nB) Gravel\nC) Old boards\nD) Wheelbarrows\nE) Shovels', 'Question 4: How were they instructed to wheel the stones in?\nA) By carrying them in buckets\nB) By tipping them down at the start\nC) By pouring them from a truck\nD) By using wheelbarrows\nE) By using wagons', 'Question 5: What did Jonas recommend they do with the loads at the end of the path?\nA) Leave them there\nB) Turn around and draw the wheelbarrows out\nC) Tip them over\nD) Carry them back to the start\nE) Use them to build a tower', ""Question 6: What was Jonas's suggestion for creating a stable path for the stones?\nA) Using shovels\nB) Using wagons\nC) Walking carefully on the mud\nD) Gradually filling up the quagmire with stones\nE) Using boards""]"|['B) One cent for every load', 'C) Outside the house', 'C) Old boards', 'D) By using wheelbarrows', 'B) Turn around and draw the wheelbarrows out', 'E) Using boards']
The boys reached the bars to the pasture, looking for the cows. Jonas went ahead to find them near the boiling spring, a lovely spot where water bubbled up from the sand, creating a lush meadow. While Jonas went ahead, James and Rollo picked blackberries. Later, they saw the cows and Jonas approaching with a plan to remove a hornet's nest. The boys worked diligently on a path project, following Jonas's instructions. They wheeled stones and placed boards as directed. The boys were called home by a bell, receiving payment for their work. Rollo's father rewarded them with seven cents each. The boys were to save the money for a future purchase. They wiped the tally clean, ready to continue their work the next day.|"['1.

After their meal, Rollo and James fetched a watering-pot to tend to their sand-garden. As they watered, they chatted about how to spend their money. Rollo decided on a bow and arrow. They paused by Rollo's father, who explained that even though the money was theirs, they needed parental approval on its use. The next day, they worked on their causeway, laying stones and wheeling gravel. Jonas made them shovels from shingles to ease the task. By the third day, they had a smooth, sturdy path to the brook. Rollo's father noted their hard work and owed Rollo twenty-three cents and James twenty-one. They decided to buy shovels for easier work. One spring morning, Rollo and his father strolled to a farm. They explored the barn, marveling at the stalls and animals.|"['1.

Rollo's father usually bought garden seeds from the farm each spring. After a brief wait, they entered the house, and Rollo joined them to gather the seeds from the seed-room. The seed-room was a spacious closet with shelves, where Rollo waited as the seeds were chosen, packed, and handed to his father. His father decided to give Rollo some seeds to plant. He handed Rollo four packets of seeds, instructing him to plant them in his garden. Rollo could work on the garden as a form of play, but his father suggested considering the produce and planning the garden layout for maximum productivity. Rollo contemplated between treating the garden as play or a serious project. His father proposed different locations based on Rollo's approach, and eventually, Rollo decided to have two gardens - one for work and one for play. His father set conditions for maintaining the working garden, and Rollo accepted. Jonas advised Rollo on how to start preparing the ground by digging. Rollo began digging with Jonas's guidance, starting along one side of the garden. After the first day of work, Rollo questioned whether to plant what he had dug or continue digging.|"[""1.

Rollo learned a valuable lesson about perseverance and planning from his gardening experience. Initially, he was tired of the tedious digging but realized that he needed to push through the monotony to achieve his goal. With the help of Jonas, Rollo carefully planned his garden layout, planting peas, beans, corn, beets, muskmelons, and flowers. He took great interest in nurturing his garden and enjoyed watching the seeds sprout. However, as time passed, Rollo got distracted by other activities and neglected his garden, allowing weeds to take over. When reminded by Jonas, he rushed to fix his garden before sunset. Rollo understood the importance of systematic and patient work to achieve better results, realizing that consistent effort is key to success.|"['1.

It was nearly sunset. Rollo worked diligently, hoeing and pulling up weeds until it grew too dark to see. Feeling overwhelmed by the remaining tasks, he sat on his wheelbarrow, tears streaming down his cheeks. Determined, he wiped his eyes and headed inside. Anxious about his father counting Sunday, Rollo waited for his return to ask. When his father arrived late, Rollo inquired about the day's work. His father explained the importance of honoring agreements and the consequences of not meeting them. Rollo, relieved, bid his father good night, hopeful for Monday. However, his hopes dwindled as the rain poured down, threatening his garden. Despite the storm, Rollo remained determined to finish his work before nightfall.|"['1.

Rollo and his friend went up to the attic and found a bunch of old clothes hanging up. Some clothes belonged to Jonas, some to Rollo. They picked out the worst ones and carried them down to the shed. Rollo then asked his mother if it was okay for the clothes to get wet. She said it was fine and got his father's permission for Rollo to go outside in the rain. Rollo put on the old clothes, went out with a hoe, and started working in the rain to clear the ground. At first, he found it fun, but soon he got tired and uncomfortable. However, he persevered and finished the job before dark. His father praised him for learning the importance of not neglecting one's duty. Rollo remembered this lesson and did his work diligently for the rest of the summer.|"['1.

From this follows the third fault—_changeableness_, or lack of perseverance. Rather than persistently moving forward in their pursuits, boys often abandon one thing for another, hindering their progress. “Yes,” said his father, “that is the kind of work that requires patience, steadiness, and perseverance, skills crucial for your future. You have much to learn before adulthood, but you have time to learn it.” Now it's time for bed, so good night.” In Farmer Cropwell’s yard, there was a building called the _garden-house_. Inside, garden tools like hoes, rakes, and shovels were neatly stored. George, a boy playing with his dog Nappy, shut the door to keep Nappy out. George then rode his horse Jolly, teasing Nappy, who chased after them. Mr. Cropwell planned an exchange where Rollo would help George gather meadow-russets, and in return, George would assist Rollo in making a strawberry bed.|['1.

The following morning, James and Rollo headed to the farmer's place together. There, they met George at the gate, accompanied by his dog Nappy. As they strolled into the yard, George shared that besides his lamb, Nappy was his dearest friend. He recounted how he nursed the lamb back to health when it was a weak little creature. Ann, intrigued by the story, fetched a pan of milk and led the boys to a field behind the house. She called out for the lamb, named Conan, who emerged from the bushes and drank the milk. Excited by the encounter, the boys prepared to gather apples from the meadow-russet tree. Equipped with a wagon and poles, they set off down the path. Along the way, they encountered a cart and oxen, prompting a lively commotion as they made way for the passing cart. Despite a slight squabble over the poles, the boys continued their apple-gathering mission.|"[""1.

Rollo, James, and George were working together in the garden. They all wanted to use the pole to knock down apples, but each had a different idea of how to do it. Rollo got tired of waiting and grabbed the pole when James put it down. They started arguing about how to load the apples onto the wagon. George wanted to head home, but Rollo and James disagreed. They ended up pulling the wagon in different directions and didn't make much progress. Eventually, they went to watch some men building a stone bridge. The farmer explained how having one person in charge helps things run smoothly. He suggested that the boys take turns being in charge to learn to both lead and follow instructions without arguing.|"['1.

The boys agreed to follow the plan and loaded the apples into the barrel under George's guidance. Rollo and James pulled the wagon while George directed. They collected apples efficiently, and soon the wagon was full. They took the apples to the barn as instructed by George. The farmer then organized the apples, designating some for Rollo and some for James. George later helped Rollo set up a strawberry bed. After finishing the work, George and Rollo returned the wagon home. George admired Rollo's wheelbarrow and playfully chased Tom with it. The farmer shared a story about a bear and a wolf with the boys as they rode in his cart.|"[""1.

A bear once frightened some young tomtits by almost stifling them in their nest. The old birds were angry when they returned. The bear often slept in a glen surrounded by rocks. One day, he saw huntsmen approaching and fled to the glen. The tomtits guided the hunters to the bear. The bear tried to escape but was shot. A nearby wolf wisely left the scene. Nearby, Rollo lived in a pleasant house with apple trees and a garden leading to the water. One evening, while crossing the stone bridge, Rollo heard a sweet voice calling from the bank where Georgie's path met the water. It was a familiar spot for sailing boats.|['1.

Rollo heard Georgie's voice calling him, and soon found him seated in his special chair with his crutches nearby. Georgie, a sick boy who couldn't walk, spent his days at home in his comfortable chair by the fire in winter and by the window overlooking the garden in summer. Although Georgie had few toys, Jonas taught him to make windmills and boxes from wood, which he sold to other children. Georgie's gentle nature and beautiful appearance made him well-liked by all. With the money he earned, Georgie's father bought him tools and materials to improve his craft, making his creations even more appealing.

Georgie had a variety of tools and materials like wire, pliers, a hammer, nails, paint-box, brushes, and colored paper. He stored them in drawers and shelves, creating many clever items. Rollo and Jonas were good friends with Georgie, often playing with him. One day, Rollo heard Georgie's voice and found him sitting in the garden. Georgie offered Rollo apples, but he couldn't choose between the rosy boys and pippins. So Georgie kindly gave him one of each. The next day, Rollo and his mother went for a ride with Jonas. Rollo offered the front seat to his cousin, showing kindness. Rollo's mother then explained the value of playthings, detailing how some items bring pleasure through novelty, while others, like a doll, provide joy through use.|"['1.

When choosing playthings, it's essential to consider if the pleasure they bring is from their novelty or their usefulness. Playthings like a ball or a top can be used in many ways, providing lasting enjoyment. On the other hand, toys that only offer novelty, like jumping men or witches, quickly lose their appeal. It's also crucial to think about how your playthings might affect others. Toys that create noise, like drums or whistles, can be bothersome to those around you. Additionally, items that could cause harm, such as masks or bows and arrows, should be avoided unless used in a safe place. Wise choices in playthings ensure both personal enjoyment and consideration for others.|['1.
