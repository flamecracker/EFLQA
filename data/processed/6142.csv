"""It doesn't scare me, Bet,"" Mrs. Granger assured. ""I'm leaving, and He's coming to take me; I'm not afraid. I feel like a poor soul tonight, but somehow I'm not scared. When He arrives, He'll be kind--I know He'll be kind to me.""

""I was a regular churchgoer, and I did my duty,"" replied Mrs. Granger. ""But tonight, I feel humble and low. Maybe I didn't show you the right way to think about religion, Bet. Maybe I didn't do anything right--but I tried, I tried.""

Bet was devoted to her mother, willing to do anything to ease her passing, except embrace religion. Despite her mother's faith, Bet couldn't fathom becoming a hypocrite. But as her mother lay still, a peaceful smile on her face, Bet was horrified. Her mother, who valued religion above all, seemed content after their conversation.

On the evening after Hester had escorted Bet home, she found herself at the entrance of The Cleopatra Theatre around seven o'clock. A new play was scheduled for that night, and the small pit entrance was already crowded with rough men and unkempt girls. They greeted Hester warmly, making way for her to the front.

Bet was in a difficult situation. Her father was against her marrying the thief, and she was too overwhelmed to respond. Granger, despite being puzzled by Bet's knowledge of his actions, was relieved to have her and the boys under his control again. The police were searching for a sailor named Dent, but they couldn't find him in Liverpool. Dent, who hadn't left the city, was skilled at disguising himself and evading the police. Bet returned to Sparrow Street with the boys, where she seemed distant and preoccupied, unlike her usual self. She spent her days on edge, watching and listening intently, avoiding eating, and crying a lot.

Bet, unaware of this, was overcome with fear. Restless, she paced the small room where her mother had passed away, resembling a trapped animal. Grateful, she knelt before her father, her heart pounding with relief. Granger revealed that he had located Dent and convinced him to testify for Will the next day. However, Dent's condition was that Bet must agree to marry him. Despite her initial shock, Bet found strength in a Bible verse she vaguely remembered.

"The fiddle stopped playing, footsteps paused, voices hushed, and a group of around twenty people encircled Dent. Mother Bunch, at the center, stepped forward, her strong arm bare. She raised it with a significant gesture. ""Child,"" she addressed Dent, now a prisoner, ""Will you confess to plotting against innocent Will Scarlett, or face the consequences?"" Dent retorted, ""You're all cowards! Let me go!"" Mother Bunch accused Dent of stealing and framing Will. She declared Dent must confess before he could leave. Hester added, ""You deceived Bet and put Will in prison. You'll stay until you confess."" The group made their own law, determined to see justice. Dent protested, ""I can't stay here!""

Hester had a plan for Isaac. She insisted he release Will from prison to marry his true love. To ensure Isaac's compliance, Hester arranged for Miss Mary Vallence to take down Isaac's confession about his misdeeds, including his plot against Will and the stolen money. Isaac reluctantly agreed, fearing the consequences. Once the confession was signed and witnessed, Isaac was set free with an hour to escape before the police were informed. Despite Isaac's resentment, he disappeared from Liverpool. The Irish community celebrated Will's release, but Hester worried about Bet, the girl Will loved. The story concludes with the captain's recovery, the general finding a home, and Will regaining his freedom.|"[""1.
