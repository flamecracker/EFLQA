The boys were thrilled to have a goat named Billy Whiskers, but their mother was not pleased, fearing he would cause trouble. However, the boys promised to take good care of Billy. That night, tied near a shed, Billy chewed through his rope and explored the garden, eating lettuce and trampling flowers. When he saw a man, he hid on the veranda. Curious, he licked the doorbell, causing a commotion. Mr. Wagner, the owner, searched for the culprit but found no one. Billy pretended to be asleep by the shed.

Billy Whiskers, a goat, was peacefully resting in his shed when he was awoken by a barking dog and the sound of a bleating goat in the neighboring shed.

Billy planned a mischievous prank to give Mr. Tim a surprise. He instructed Nanny to dash into the water without stopping, ensuring a wet adventure for the boys. Despite the cold water, the goats swam on, leaving the boys soaked. Billy then strategized to break free from the cart by toppling it near a tree. As the boys attempted to punish the goats, Billy led Nanny into hiding. Mike, one of the boys, tried to find Billy but failed. Meanwhile, Billy savored the freedom, nibbling on leaves and enjoying the creek.

After Billy left the policeman hanging on the fence, he strolled through the streets, trying to find his way out of town to return to Nanny. However, the houses in the suburbs seemed closer together as he walked. Eventually, he found himself on a street lined with stores and flats, feeling hungry and tired. Billy decided to sneak into a flat's backyard to rest. He saw the cooks preparing supper and smelled the delicious aroma of boiled cabbage. He decided to explore the flats, starting from the bottom, looking for food. In one flat, he accidentally spilled a basket of eggs, causing a commotion.

Billy had been with the firefighters for about a month when he overheard them discussing an upcoming parade. The fire engines, hose-carts, and hook-and-ladder companies were all going to be part of the procession. The horses were to be adorned with gilded hoofs and rose collars. Billy was also to be decorated with gilded horns and hoofs, a rose collar, and led by a chain of roses. The fireman accompanying him would wear a red shirt, black trousers, and high patent leather boots. However, Billy had other plans. He didn't want to be scrubbed and dressed up for the parade. Feeling homesick and longing for the countryside and Nanny, he decided to run away. During the scrubbing process, Billy got agitated, leading to chaos in the yard. Despite the commotion, Billy managed to escape and reunite with Nanny, a goat being mistreated by a man named Mike Rooney.|"['1.

When Mike got up, he approached Billy with his whip, ready to strike. However, as he was about to hit him, he recognized Billy as his missing goat. Mike intended to reconcile with Billy and use him to help Nanny pull the cart. But Billy suddenly lunged at Mike, knocking him down and causing chaos. The milk spilled, and Nanny was freed from the cart. An angry Mike chased after them, but they managed to escape. Billy and Nanny found a peaceful meadow to rest in. The next day, they encountered some boys near a lake. Billy, tempted by the smell of popcorn, tried to grab a bag from one of the boys but found it empty.

Two goats, Billy and Nanny, found themselves in a funny predicament. While the other goats seemed content grazing in the meadow, Billy faced a wardrobe malfunction - missing trousers! In a clever move, the group devised a plan to disguise Billy's lack of pants using a coat. Hilariously, Billy had to take tiny steps due to the coat's sleeves acting as makeshift pants. The goats soon stumbled upon a beautiful valley with a herd of goats led by an old goat named Satan. The goats welcomed Billy and Nanny, who shared tales of their adventures. The group even planned a mischievous turnip patch raid. However, their escapade was cut short by the farmer's dogs, leading to a comical chase back over the fence.|"['1.

A few days later, when the goats were grazing in the meadow and Nanny was resting under a tree, Billy, tired of the routine, decided to explore. He ventured towards the house, jumping over a white fence and sneaking through an open gate. Inside, he overheard voices and hoped for a treat. Billy tiptoed towards the kitchen, eyeing plates of salad and cakes. Curious about an ice-cream freezer, he accidentally spilled it, causing a commotion. Fleeing to the cellar, he encountered a mirror and mistook his reflection for another goat. In his attempt to butt the 'intruder,' he shattered the mirror, injuring himself.

The crash caused a commotion, bringing the ladies from the dining room led by Mrs. Windlass. As they reached the stairs, they were startled by a white goat at the top, blood on its whiskers. One lady fainted at the sight, while the others scattered. Billy, the goat, dashed out of the house towards the pasture. On his way, he encountered a turkey cock, which he deftly outsmarted.

After washing up in a stream, Billy escaped punishment for his mischief. Later, a circus-man arrived, lassoed Billy, and took him to the circus.

Billy, a curious goat, found himself in a circus surrounded by chatty animals. Miss Nancy, a camel, shared tales of circus life and boasted about her easy job compared to her desert origins. The lion's roar silenced all, reminding them of his regal presence. As preparations for the procession began, Billy was fitted with a saddle for a dancing monkey named Jocko.

Billy, the clever goat, had just calmed down from his encounter with the mischievous monkey, when the sound of a bugle call signaled the start of the circus procession. The elephants were adorned in vibrant scarlet blankets with golden embroidery, while the camels and horses were beautifully decorated.

Billy, the circus goat, had been well-behaved lately and was even allowed to roam freely around the circus at night. One night, feeling restless, he snuck into various tents. First, he tried to break into a glass case of popcorn, but ended up breaking it and enjoying the treat. Thirsty, he found lemonade but didn't like it. Upset, he spilled it everywhere. He then wandered into the leading lady's tent, tasting her makeup and wig. Next, he entered a tent with snake charmers and unknowingly disturbed a large snake, getting coiled around by it. The snake charmer saved him with music, and Billy ran off. The next day, chaos erupted as everyone blamed each other for the incidents. The snake charmer, with a secret twinkle in his eye, narrated how he saved Billy from the boa constrictor.|"[""1.

On the last day of the circus in Smithville, Billy, the mischievous goat, caused chaos during the performances. In the morning, he behaved decently, but by the afternoon, he was so eager to leave that he started misbehaving. Billy ran around the ring so fast that a monkey trying to jump through paper hoops landed on the ground instead of on Billy's back. The ring-master, frustrated, hit Billy with a whip, which only made Billy behave worse. He shook himself vigorously, making the monkey struggle to hold on. When the ring-master tried to discipline Billy, he turned his anger towards him, chasing him around the ring. Eventually, Billy found himself standing on top of the lion's cage, surprising everyone. Later, Billy made friends with a little Mexican Burroetta and was eventually found lying down by the Burroetta just before his performance. Despite his antics, Billy managed to entertain the audience with his unique behavior during the show.|"['1.

The commotion caused by the discovery that the astrologer was just a goat and the ventriloquist hid under the platform led to the circus breaking up for the night. Billy, realizing he had misbehaved, tore off his gown and disappeared into the darkness outside. He stayed hidden in the shadows near a shed and watched as the circus packed up. The draft-horses were hitched to wagons, the big tent was rolled up, and the procession began. When a bridge collapsed, causing a halt, Billy and his friend, Senorita Burro, found the cause. The wagons had to cross through water, and Billy and Burro jumped ahead. The loud noise from the circus woke nearby villagers, who mistook it for the Day of Judgment. The Swedish family was terrified, thinking wild animals were loose. The animals' noises scared the villagers, and the circus was shunned on Sunday morning.|"[""1.

The church aisle was separated from the vestibule by two green doors. Billy and Betty pushed them open, walking down the aisle as if in a wedding procession.

Ushers tried to remove them, but Billy ended up in the pulpit, and Betty ran into a room, causing laughter among the choir boys.
