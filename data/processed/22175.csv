Long ago, wandering singers known as minstrels roamed the country, singing tales of fairies and brave deeds. They carried harps and sang of the little folk's visits to mortal homes and of war and bloodshed. The minstrels added verses to old songs and wandered from town to village, sharing their stories. One tale tells of Tamlane, a young man carried off to Fairyland by the Queen of the Fairies. The fairy folk often visited the plain of Carterhaugh, leaving circles in the grass where they danced. Janet, a brave lady, defied the elf knight's spell and claimed the moor as her own. The old books hold many more stories of love, hate, joy, and sorrow for those who seek them.|"['1.

As Thomas wept, the darkness lightened, and they rode towards the brightness. The sun shone as they approached a unique garden, filled with various fruits like apples, pears, and figs, all ripe for picking. The garden was also home to beautiful birds like nightingales and thrushes. The lady warned Thomas not to pluck the fruit, as it would lead his soul to a dark place until doomsday.

Thomas saw three paths ahead: a narrow, thorny path of Goodness, a broad, easy path of Evil with roses and lilies, and a beautiful road to Elfland through green woods.
