Salemina and I were in Geneva, exploring Europe. Salemina, a philanthropist and educator, was collecting valuable material for her country. Francesca, a pretty person of wealth, joined us to experience Europe under our guidance. I, having a background in teaching and art, cherish my time with children. Sitting by Lake Geneva, the beauty of nature overwhelmed us, making modern problems seem distant. Mont Blanc's majesty captivated us, reminding Salemina of the wisdom in reserve. Visiting Chillon Castle and Coppet, we immersed ourselves in history. Reflecting on America's newness, I whimsically proposed creating picturesque ruins to add character. Our journey through Switzerland was a blend of history, nature, and contemplation, enriching our perspectives.|"[""1.

Last night, I had a change of heart, and this morning, a vision between sleep and wakefulness inspired me. It's September 1st, schools are starting, and I must lead the Froebel Society tomorrow. We must skip our plans and embark on an educational journey to Yverdon, where Pestalozzi taught, the father of popular education. Pestalozzi influenced Froebel, our patron saint. Salemina hesitated, but we must prioritize knowledge over frivolous activities. Yverdon is 61 miles from Geneva, a three-hour forty-minute journey. We quickly arranged a simple lunch at a local shop before catching the train. Despite a minor language barrier, we resolved the lemonade price misunderstanding and boarded the train promptly.|['1.

It was a clear day on our journey to Yverdon, where we arrived around noon. We had our lunch on the train, leaving us with a long afternoon ahead. Salemina carried a lemonade glass, her guide-book, red parasol, and cape, determined to return the glass to the Geneva pirate. The town was quiet, once a place of pilgrimage for followers of Pestalozzi's teaching methods. We explored the town, searching for the new Pestalozzi Monument, which we found in the city center. The bronze sculpture was impressive, honoring Pestalozzi's legacy. We sat by the monument, reflecting on his life. Salemina realized she left the glass in a shop, leading to a humorous exchange as we searched for it. We also visited the old castle, now a public school, with a museum and library showcasing Pestalozzi's work. The caretaker was touched by our interest and knowledge of Pestalozzi, though she was unaware of Friedrich Froebel.|"['1.

The younger kids had left, and we wandered through the empty school, which wasn't inviting. In a room, we found a sad little boy locked in. I talked to him, feeling homesick seeing him like other boys in trouble. The concierge said they still followed Pestalozzi's methods in Yverdon schools. We then entered a room where ten-year-old girls studied. It had three windows, a platform, a teacher, and desks but no decorations. The only adornment was a colourful chart illustrating the dangers of fire and disobedience. It showed a boy named Charles starting a fire, with a girl warning against matches. Charles and other boys lit a fire, and a child fell in. The scene ended with villagers arriving too late.|"['1.

"The sorrow of everyone present would move even the most stoic person to tears. Among the mourners, only the G. L. M. remains calm, possibly thinking, ""Maybe they will heed my advice next time."" The procession carries the charred body of young Paul to the cemetery, led by the G. L. M. in a white veil. Notably, ""poor little Charles"" stands among the mourners, overwhelmed with sorrow and regret. The scene reflects a poignant sermon that left a lasting impact.

"I was proud to have captured the attention of children in a foreign land, speaking a language they did not understand. As I heard footsteps approaching, I quickly commanded, ""_Asseyez-vous_, _mes enfants_, _tout-de-suite_!"" They obeyed instantly. We wandered through the village, dined at a quaint inn, and left for Geneva at seven in the September twilight. Arriving a bit tired, we visited a cake shop. The man thanked us for returning a tumbler, and I reminded him of the one franc fifty centimes. He laughed, and I tried to explain. We left, having contributed to French revenues. This was the end of our day in Pestalozzi-town, but not the end of the lemonade glass incident, a favorite tale in Salemina's stories. Venice has always been a city I wished to discover on my own, away from the constant acquisition of knowledge. If I had a daughter, I would want her to experience Venice without prior knowledge. Salemina is well-informed but forgets details at times, making her charming. Our accidental companion, Miss Celia Van Tyck, is too knowledgeable and lacks enthusiasm, unlike Salemina. She joined us in Florence, awaiting her niece Kitty Copley."|"['1.

Miss Van Tyck was not the ideal companion for Venice, a city known for its charm and beauty. Despite our intentions to enter Venice by moonlight in a romantic manner, Miss Van insisted on accompanying us. Her presence was less than desirable, as she was preoccupied with reading about other cities like Verona and Padua, neglecting the beauty of Florence. As we arrived in Venice, the enchanting atmosphere was somewhat marred by her company. I cleverly arranged for her to be in a separate gondola, freeing myself from her dissonant remarks. Despite her attempts to engage me in the city's allure, I preferred to preserve my own impressions of Venice, refraining from sharing them with others. The historic significance of Venice, especially during Ascension Day, evoked images of past ceremonies and grandeur that I could vividly imagine as we approached the Piazza of San Marco. The memories of Venice's rich history and beauty were enough to captivate me, despite the lack of modern-day vibrancy and colour in our surroundings.|"[""1.

After the festivities ended and the Bucentaur sailed away, the island of Giudecca lay still under the moon and stars. Leaving the bustling Venice for a house on Giudecca was a choice we never regretted. The picturesque sight of Miss Celia Van Tyck on a balcony with friends brought joy to Salemina and me. The house, Casa Rosa, was once a Doge's summer retreat, now a charming abode with gardens stretching to the lagoon. Guided by the Little Genius, Miss Ecks, a talented artist and persuasive speaker, we found this hidden gem. The house, adorned with ancient beauty and overlooking a garden of flowers and grapevines, captivated us. Our unique household staff, including the cook Rosalia and the flirtatious maid Peppina, added to the charm of our new home.|"['1.

"Beppo sent a sharp criticism in verse to Peppina through the new gardener, and the Little Genius recited it to us, showcasing the poetic talent of the rejected lover. Beppo cleverly chose his rebuke from popular verses known to gondoliers and fishermen of Venice. Beppo, Salemina, and I were chatting one morning when Peppina passed by, carrying market baskets and looking radiant, with a crimson rose in her teeth. She playfully hummed a line from Beppo's poem, ""Trust not the mast that bends,"" as she glanced at Beppo. Despite Salemina's approval of Peppina's unconventional attire, I struggle with the lack of discipline. Our warm climate seems to erode the strict virtues instilled by harsh Boston winds. Francesco, our general kitchen assistant and skilled gondolier, feels out of place when serving in the dining room but earnestly tries to adapt to the role. Salemina believes we are living a light opera where we can relax and enjoy the show without responsibilities. We prefer the charm of Cecco's comedic performance over a formal butler, as he adds a touch of drama to our meals. In this picturesque setting, we choose to ignore the realities that may disrupt our idealized view of Venice.

The painting on my bedroom ceiling is a captivating mix of mythological creatures and cherubic figures set against a backdrop of clouds. The mystery lies in the mismatch between the number of cherubic heads and their extremities, creating a whimsical scene. Padrona Angela provides no official explanation for the ceiling art at Casa Rosa. Recently, four American girls visited and pondered over the symbolic meanings of the frescoes. The morning view from our window overlooks the Doge’s Palace and the Campanile, with a bustling canal below. Our breakfast consists of freshly churned butter, honey, eggs, and a variety of fruits.

In the mornings, we observe the bustling activity of loading and unloading grain from small boats with colorful sails adorned with emblems. Recently, a large ship docked near us, much to Salemina's displeasure. Men, with handkerchiefs on their heads and twine strings at their waists, carry heavy bags of grain. The bags are weighed, tied, and lifted onto their shoulders. Salemina, disturbed by the commotion, missed out on strawberries for breakfast. Later, she took a gondola ride with Miss Palett, a local artist. Upon their return, Salemina felt victorious after persuading the ship's captain to relocate the vessel.

Salemina's calling card was filled with intriguing details, particularly for those in the know. Her last name alone granted her access to high society. To be an X— was prestigious, and her first name belonged to the most influential branch of the X— family. The mention of her mother's maiden name in the center confirmed Salemina's impeccable lineage on both sides. Her address was fitting for someone with three such distinguished names, and the street and number hinted at her family's wealth. Salemina's card was a testament to her privileged background, setting her apart in society. The city of Venice, with its grand canal and vibrant displays, left a lasting impression on the writer, who found beauty in the arrival of foreign royalty. The gondolas, adorned with colorful liveries, glided gracefully through the water, creating a stunning spectacle. The writer spent hours observing life in Venice from a gondola, taking in the sights and sounds of the city.

Being unable to articulate in a foreign land due to a lack of vocabulary can be quite distressing. It is advisable not to set overly high standards in terms of grammar or pronunciation right from the start. During a gondola ride this afternoon, we overheard a brave lady conversing with an Italian musician carrying a mandolin, likely there to give her husband a music lesson. She appeared to be from the American Midwest. She translated everything she said into English, assuming the listener might understand something between French and English. Her efforts, though not flawless, were commendable. This contrasts with a humorous incident involving a man in Rome who, knowing only a few Latin phrases, attempted to leave luggage at a railway station using Latin phrases. Despite the challenges of language barriers, the quest to communicate in a foreign tongue continues to be a fascinating journey.|"['1.

"Apologies or Excuse me, Come in or You may pass, Goodbye or Farewell, What do you say? or How do you say it? How much do you ask? or How much does he/she ask? Where are you going? or Where is he/she going? What is your name? or What is his/her name? and so on until your mind seems to be organized in columns, with special notes to use the infinitive when speaking to the gondolier. The hours of time seemed confusing as detailed in the ""Study of Italian Made Easy,"" so I spent twenty-four hours learning how to tell time from one o'clock to midnight, or thirteen to twenty-three o'clock. It was a challenging task, as a foreign language is filled with these tricky speech refinements to deter strangers from easily mastering it. However, I later discovered that my efforts were in vain, as Italians themselves no longer use these linguistic complexities. If the Latin races agreed to assign the neutral gender to inanimate objects, they could be more popular with English-speaking nations. But since they began enriching their language with these intricacies centuries ago, they will likely continue them indefinitely.

The group chatted and gestured excitedly, tangled in a web of misunderstandings. A clash between the sweetmeat vendor and the sausage seller set off a chain reaction, leading to chaos. The spry girl, keen on justice, found herself in the midst of the turmoil. The fritter lady, sweetmeat man, and sausage vendor engaged in a heated exchange of blame. The contralto, caught between family ties and love, intervened with a soup ladle. Insults flew, tempers flared, and chaos reigned until the Little Genius, with her blue pitcher broken, took charge. Her calm yet assertive demeanor restored order, calming the storm. As the evening approached, goodbyes were said, and the anticipation of a festive night filled the air.

During a delightful journey along the Thames, I explored villages with friends Kitty and Jack. They challenged me to rhyme Henley and Streatley before lunch, rewarding my efforts with laurel crowns and medals. At Datchett, water-rats watched us eat by the reeds. Medmenham Abbey posed a pronunciation puzzle. Jack's strict guidance led to poetic entries in inn Visitors’ Books. At Penygwryd, I faced challenging Welsh names. A quaint inn, Ty Ucha, served a feast with ham, ale, and cheese. Served by the innkeeper’s granddaughter, Nelw Evans, we felt the warmth of British hospitality. We left poetic marks in the inn’s “Locked Book” before continuing our journey to Bettws-y-Coed, where a humorous rhyme was carved for posterity.|['1.

During our journey, we stopped at the Royal Goat in Beddgelert. I decided to write a letter to Salemina, who stayed back in London due to a sprained ankle. I wanted to fill the letter with local color, so I created an exciting story using Welsh town names. We left Bettws-y-Coed and traveled thirty-three miles to our current location. As we passed through Portmadoc, we saw posters about a Festiniog event. The road became lively with people returning from the festival. Women wore colorful plaid Rhuddlans and straw Beddgelerts on their heads. The guard tooted his horn as we entered the village, where crowds gathered. Suddenly, a large black Llanrwst horse caused chaos, but the guard, Absalom, saved the day with a Capel Curig.

We strolled down the winding path and caught sight of charming cottages with open doors and blooming flowers. Descending further, we were met with a breathtaking view of the bluest sea. Donkeys laden with goods, a fisherman mending his nets, and villagers preparing for fishing added to the scene's charm. Finding lodging was easy; Egeria found a cozy spot with a vine-covered window. The New Inn, once small, now offers comfortable rooms and a respectable tap-room. The walls adorned with old china create a unique and picturesque atmosphere. Clovelly's mornings are delightful, with sunshine, sea air, and the limestone cliffs of Gallantry Bower. Our day started early, meeting for breakfast in the coffee room. Egeria, dressed in sea-green linen, embodied the essence of a Clovelly morning. She explored North Hill with Phoebe, encountering a bold fisher-lad named Jem along the way.|['1.

We were having lunch on the veranda, surrounded by nature, on a sunny Buttercup Sunday in June. The day had been preceded by various flower-themed Sundays like Pussy Willow, Dandelion, Apple Blossom, Wild Iris, and Lilac. Francie walked over the grass with a bowl, reminiscent of how Scottish men carry oatmeal at breakfast. Sally-baby played with bubbles in her milk while we discussed a book from London. Suddenly, Billy was found holding a tiny bird's egg he had innocently taken. We chatted about birds in our orchard, attracting them with birdhouses, crumbs, and water.
