"""Excuse me, ma'am, but my feelings have gotten the better of my breeding,"" said a voice. ""I certainly agree with you, Mis' Lucy. There's going to be trouble if things continue as they've begun since the Madam and that dog arrived at Severndale. But look, here comes our young mistress,"" the voice continued as a clear, sweet voice singing was heard outside. Peggy Stewart, the heiress of Severndale, entered the room with her Russian wolfhound, Tzaritza. Peggy, a lovely dark-haired girl of fifteen, had changed significantly over the past year, growing into a charming young lady. She was joined by her aunt, Mrs. Peyton Stewart, who carried her French poodle. Toinette, the poodle, made a wild dash for a Persian cat, only to be stopped by Sultana, the cat. Tzaritza calmly picked up the yelping poodle and presented her to Peggy, who was scolded by Toinette's mistress for having such a savage creature near her precious pet."""|"['1.

Tzaritza's disapproving look was almost human. She growled softly, placing the intimidated poodle at Peggy's feet before leaving the room, radiating disdainful grace. Mrs. Stewart quickly picked up the poodle, unharmed except for a scratch from Sultana, the elegant cat. Peggy assured her aunt that Tzaritza meant no harm and had brought the poodle for protection. Mrs. Stewart demanded the pets be kept separate to avoid endangering Toinette. Peggy was surprised by her aunt's sudden change and agreed to keep Tzaritza outside and Sultana away from the dining room.

In the past two days, things had not looked promising for Mrs. Stewart's plans. However, being a clever woman, she knew how to handle the situation. She expressed her attachment to her dog Toinette and explained how lonely she had been since her husband's passing. Mrs. Stewart looked forward to spending time with her niece Peggy, believing they could support each other. During breakfast, Peggy impressed Mrs. Stewart with her hostess skills and self-assurance. Later, when Mrs. Stewart was ready to go into town, she found Peggy confidently riding her horse with her loyal companions by her side. Despite Mrs. Stewart's disapproval of Peggy's love for riding, the scene was picturesque. Peggy's grace and confidence, set against the backdrop of the beautiful estate, made for a stunning sight.

Peggy was puzzled as to why her aunt seemed displeased lately, unaware of the gossip circulating among the servants. Her aunt criticized Peggy for riding with a bodyguard into town, considering it unnecessary and attention-seeking. Peggy defended her actions, explaining that it was a normal practice in their small town. Despite her explanations, her aunt insisted she leave the bodyguard behind, deeming Peggy too old for such behavior. The conversation was overheard by a young servant named Shelby, who rushed to assist Peggy upon hearing her distress.

Upon returning to the paddock with the horses, the man offered to send a young boy to help boost the dog up to the lady, but he emphasized that he was there to tend to the horses. His cheeks flushed with embarrassment as he exchanged a stern look with Mrs. Stewart. Shelby, noticing the tension, approached the horses and gently slipped halters over their heads. He scolded the horses for their playful behavior and led them back to the paddock for some discipline. Despite the challenges Peggy Stewart faced that morning, she remained composed and stood her ground when her aunt questioned her decision to ride with her loyal dog, Tzaritza. Peggy explained the importance of having Tzaritza by her side for protection and gracefully insisted on riding ahead to Annapolis.|"[""1.

As Peggy rode towards Annapolis, her mind filled with questions about her Aunt Katherine's unusual behavior. Lost in thought, she failed to notice when Shashai and Tzaritza led her onto a wood road. Nelly Bolivar's cheerful voice brought her back to the present, where she found herself in a place she hadn't intended to go. Nelly's concern for Peggy's serious expression made her realize she was lost in her thoughts. Peggy confessed feeling out of sorts and admitted to losing track of her destination. Nelly's face clouded, knowing the rumors surrounding Aunt Katherine's visit. The old colored servants had painted a vivid picture of Aunt Katherine's character, which could potentially impact Peggy's life.

Many of the workers on the Severndale estate had been there for three generations, considering Peggy as their own. Her experiences were shared among them, creating a strong bond. The news that Peggy would manage the estate had spread, met with both support and opposition. The tenants, like Jim Bolivar, discussed it, especially with his daughter Nelly, who admired Peggy for her kindness. As Madam Stewart arrived in Annapolis, she sensed a hidden hostility from Peggy's servants. The drive through the town showcased its history and significance to Peggy's family. Despite Mrs. Stewart's negative comments, Jess, the driver, took pride in the town's heritage. Peggy's positive attitude upon meeting her aunt contrasted with Mrs. Stewart's critical views, showing Peggy's determination to remain composed during her aunt's visit.|"[""1.

During Mrs. Stewart's three-week visit, she tried to become the mistress of her brother-in-law's household. She wanted to take control but faced opposition, not from Peggy, who had been accommodating, except for one request. Peggy had gracefully stood her ground, despite Mrs. Stewart's criticisms. Mrs. Stewart gradually took over Peggy's role as mistress, although Peggy had earned it through inheritance and hard work. Mrs. Stewart, coming from humble beginnings, couldn't understand the traditions and dynamics of the household. Her own past was simple, unlike the Southern traditions she encountered. Her interactions with her husband's family were filled with misunderstandings. Neil Stewart, upon reading a letter from Peggy, realized the turmoil caused by his sister-in-law's actions. Harrison's monthly report provided insight into the situation, prompting Neil to reflect on the family dynamics.|"[""1.

Mrs. Stewart tried to show genuine interest in her voice, but love was not her strong suit. Peggy sensed this intuitively. If anyone could have melted Mrs. Stewart's heart, it should have been Peggy, with her soft, trusting eyes. Peggy obediently sat on a cushion, looking up at Mrs. Stewart with a mix of confusion and trust that would have won over any ordinary person. But Mrs. Stewart was not moved by Peggy's affection. When Peggy asked about being a burden, Mrs. Stewart dismissed it, suggesting that Peggy had actually benefited Mrs. Harold and Polly. Peggy, feeling grateful for their kindness, couldn't fathom how she could have repaid them. Mrs. Stewart, lacking deep emotions, saw Peggy's relationship with Mrs. Harold and Polly as a mere exchange of benefits. She hinted at Peggy needing a chaperone for her debut and proper training, implying a major change in Peggy's life was imminent.|"[""1.

Peggy sat calmly, hands clasped around her knees, as her aunt expressed her decision to devote her time to Peggy and relieve her of household responsibilities. Her aunt proposed sending Peggy to a prestigious school in New York to experience a different social environment. Despite her aunt's intentions, Peggy felt overwhelmed and suffocated.

Peggy's life had been a mix of contradictions, longing for a mother's unconditional love. She missed that deep love and felt lonely without it. Polly's friendship made her happy, and Mrs. Harold became a trusted friend. Mrs. Howland, Polly's mother, revealed a world of love and devotion unique to each of her children. Peggy admired this and longed for a similar bond. She worried about her aunt disrupting her cherished home and felt misunderstood by the household staff.

Peggy straightened up. This situation couldn't continue. If she behaved like a spoiled child just because she had taken a dislike to someone who had entered her home, she would soon have the entire household in chaos. Mammy nodded knowingly.

Neil Stewart paused to grab some nuts from the dish that Jerome, now recovered and beaming, held for him. Mrs. Stewart could have yelled with frustrated anger as she realized she had miscalculated, giving her brother-in-law an advantage. She had misjudged him as a simpleton in matters concerning women. Neil, a Naval Officer, was different from what she thought. He had decided to distance himself from Peyton's widow, whom he now detested. The outcome might have been different if he hadn't met Mrs. Harold on the train. Mrs. Harold had foreseen this crisis and spoke her mind about Mrs. Stewart. She advised Neil to guide Peggy away from Mrs. Stewart's influence. Mrs. Glenn Harold and her niece Polly Howland arrived, eager to reunite with Peggy at the Academy.
