"Ruth Fielding was back at Briarwood and ready to continue working on her play. Mr. Hammond, who had been a great help, had given her some fantastic ideas for the drama that was closely tied to the school's history. One of the scenes involved a ""Masque of the Marble Harp"" set around the fountain in the sunken garden. The marble figure was to come to life and play the lyre. This trick picture sparked an idea in Ruth's mind for Mercy Curtis and the graduation ceremony. Ruth's creativity was flourishing, and she was also tasked with teaching primary grade classes due to a teacher's illness. Despite some challenges, most of the girls were happy to see Ruth, except for flaxen-haired Amy Gregg, who seemed upset. Ruth noticed a candle burning in Amy's room, contradicting her claim of not having one."|"['1.

Ruth felt quite embarrassed that the news had spread while she was on duty as a monitor, but she couldn't have prevented it. The dispute between Amy Gregg and Mary Pease had already started before Ruth entered the classroom. Some girls her age ignored her, and older girls made it clear she was unwelcome. Rumors circulated that Amy might be sent home if she didn't compensate for the accident caused by her carelessness. Ruth tried to support Amy and even convinced her friends to be kind. Despite the fire's accidental nature, Amy faced expulsion for lying about leaving a candle burning. Helen scolded the girls for their harsh treatment of Amy. Amy's lack of remorse over the fire and refusal to seek help for rebuilding fueled the girls' animosity. Ruth felt compelled to protect Amy from the constant bullying, especially as her wealthy background made her a target for jealousy.|"[""1.

Amy occasionally left Ruth before she was ready to return to Mrs. Smith's house. She walked alone along the Cedar Walk, which had many hiding spots. On two occasions, Mary Pease and her friends ambushed Amy and chased her to Mrs. Smith's house, aiming to torment her. Ruth hesitated to report them but warned them, which had no effect. On a third occasion, Amy left early, and Ruth and Helen followed to ensure Amy's safety. As they walked, a group of girls emerged from the cedars, taunting Amy. Unexpectedly, a mysterious figure intervened, causing chaos among the tormentors and sending them fleeing.

One evening, Ruth returned to Mrs. Sadoc Smith's with a load of books to study. She spotted Curly Smith preparing fishing gear by the shed. Excited, she hadn't fished in months. Curly suggested Ruth escape school's heavy workload. The next day, with the teacher absent, they planned an early fishing trip. Ruth woke before dawn to find Curly ready with coffee and doughnuts. As they left, the promise of spring lingered in the air. On their way, a crow's call echoed, a rabbit darted away, and the sun peeked over the ridge. They reached the fishing spot, and Ruth surprised Curly by expertly baiting her hook.

Ruth placed the lantern on the cracked floor and lowered herself into the dark hole. She dangled by her hands, unable to reach the bottom. Suddenly, fear gripped her. Maybe the cellar was much deeper than she had thought! Meanwhile, Amy had hidden in a corner, her movements causing the rustling noise Ruth had heard. Sobbing uncontrollably, Amy showed signs of distress. Her torn clothes and muddy shoes indicated she had been through a rough time.
