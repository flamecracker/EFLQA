Joyce sat perched up in the tallest pear-tree of old Monsieur Gréville. She had retreated to the farthest corner of the garden, away from prying eyes, to shed tears. Feeling like a captive within the garden's high stone walls, weary of French lessons and unfamiliar faces, she longed for her family back home. The ache of homesickness overwhelmed the twelve-year-old, yearning for Holland, her baby sibling, and the comforting routine of her Western village. Sorrowfully, she imagined her mother, Jack, and the familiar sights of home. Despite the ocean separating them, closing her eyes conjured vivid images of her family, the warmth of home, and the tales shared with her sister Mary. Amidst the pangs of longing, memories of her arrival abroad with Cousin Kate brought a mix of emotions, highlighting the contrast between her rural upbringing and the new, stylish world she found herself in.|['1.

Looking through the lilac bushes, Joyce saw her mother wiping her eyes. She overheard her mother saying how Joyce, being the eldest of five, had been her right hand since her father passed away. Joyce stood on the platform at the station, with her new trunk beside her, feeling both excited and sad. As the train whistle blew, she bravely boarded the train for the first time, waving goodbye to her family. Sitting on a high limb of the old pear-tree, Joyce felt a mix of homesickness and excitement. The familiar sights and sounds of the countryside comforted her. She reflected on her experiences in the last three months, feeling a sense of calm. The sun setting behind the tall poplars brought her peace as she admired the view of the village and the river Loire.|['1.

"In the three months Joyce stayed at Monsieur Gréville's home, she kept an eye on the mysterious gate, but no one seemed to use it. Beyond the gate's symbol of the name ""Ciseaux,"" its secrets remained unknown. The property belonged to a descendant of the eccentric builder, now in Algiers. When a peddler failed to get attention, Joyce walked up to the house, where Cousin Kate awaited, fresh from Tours. Admiring her cousin's style, Joyce hoped to grow up just like her. Inside, Cousin Kate noticed Joyce's tearful eyes and suggested making molasses candy and sharing a fairy tale by the fire. As the candy cooked, Joyce requested a story about the gate with scissors, leading to a tale of a King and his seven sons on a distant island."|"[""1.

Once upon a time, there was a King who favored his other sons over Ethelried, the middle son. Ethelried was neither handsome nor strong, and the King frowned upon him for not excelling in tournaments or hunting. While his brothers received gifts and portions of the kingdom, Ethelried was left with nothing. Desperate to prove himself, Ethelried asked for a sword and a steed to follow his brothers, but the King mocked him. Determined to find his own path, Ethelried left the palace. One night, in a forest, he freed a trapped Fairy using only a pair of rusty scissors. The Fairy revealed that she had been cursed by an Ogre, and Ethelried's bravery had saved her. The scissors transformed into a powerful weapon, proving that valor comes in all sizes.|"['1.

In the forest, Ethelried encountered a Fairy who gave him magical scissors. These scissors could grow to an enormous size and cut through obstacles.

When faced with the Ogre's threat, Ethelried fled, hungry and tired. Using the scissors, he cut an apple from a tree, only to be accused of stealing by an old Witch.

At dusk, Frog-eye Fearsome warned the captive Prince of impending doom. However, the next morning, no executioner arrived, leaving the Prince in darkness all day. The following evening, Frog-eye threatened drowning, but the Witch's plans changed each day. Ethelried, a kind soul, freed a grateful Fly who revealed the Witch's pattern of releasing prisoners on the third night. The Fly advised Ethelried to escape through a wooden shutter at midnight, but only with a rhyme. After crafting a suitable verse, the scissors cut through the shutter, allowing the Prince to flee. Lost outside in the dark, a Firefly guided him to safety, following the Fly's instructions.|"['1.

Once upon a time, a young Prince embarked on a journey with a Firefly guiding his way. In the Witch's orchard, he filled his pockets with precious fruit - golden apples, ruby cherries, and amethyst grapes. The Prince lived like royalty for weeks on the wealth from these magical fruits. However, he neglected the Fairy's advice to use the giant scissors for unselfish deeds. One day, he encountered a sick man unable to harvest his grain, risking starvation. Remembering the Fairy's words, the Prince worked tirelessly all night, cutting the grain with rusty scissors. As dawn broke, the scissors gleamed, and the field was saved. Grateful, the peasant's family and others became his loyal friends.

"The lovely Princess remained trapped in her tower, facing the threat of imminent doom each night. She would bid farewell to the setting sun, her home lying in the distant west. Brave knights would challenge the terrifying Ogre, but even they hesitated before his menacing presence. Among them were Ethelried's brothers, divided by their fear. As Ethelried himself arrived on foot, the crowd held its breath. The Ogre emerged, wielding a massive club, ready to strike. Ethelried valiantly fought back, defended by a pair of magical scissors. The townspeople, grateful for his past kindness, rushed to his aid. Their collective gratitude infused strength into the scissors, which finally severed the Ogre's head.

Once upon a time, a brave Prince defeated an Ogre and married a Princess. They celebrated for days on end. After the festivities, the Prince tore down the Ogre's house and built a new one, adorning it with scissors to remind him of the joy of serving others. One day, the old King and Ethelried's brothers came seeking fame, but the scissors scared them away. Behind the house, a weary boy named Jules struggled to control two mischievous goats. Brossard, the caretaker, scolded him harshly. Brossard and Henri, the cook, lived in the house, saving every penny. Brossard's stinginess was legendary, even quarreling over the price of fish. Memories of the master's last visit lingered, especially the surprise of a baby in his arms.|"['1.

Monsieur explained that the boy in his arms was his brother Jules's grandson, the last of their family. Despite the boy's arrival, Brossard and Henri treated him like any other addition to their daily routine. They provided him with food and a cot but remained indifferent to his longing for his mother. Brossard's attempts to engage with the child failed, and he grew to dislike him. Henri, however, showed the boy kindness, teaching him French and offering a rare moment of affection. One evening, hungry and cold, Jules was sent to buy bread. As he waited in line, he watched the lamplighter pass by, casting a lonely shadow on the village's cobblestone streets.|"[""1.

The customs officer by the gate of the old town nodded as the boy rushed past. Outside, Jules walked slower uphill, the moon rising over frosty fields. Lamps glowed in windows, a dog barked, and two women in a cart passed by. At the hilltop, hungry Jules longed for fresh bread. He resisted tearing it apart, knowing Brossard awaited. He ran home, where Brossard, stern, gestured for bed. Jules, conflicted, resisted the tempting table. Alone, he recalled a dream of a white house with fireflies. A woman called him in a sweet, unfamiliar song. Jules cherished this dream, unlike his life with Brossard.|['1.

Jules was held in a woman's lap, feeling her soft touch and hearing her sweet song. He longed for her comforting embrace more than food. Watching Henri feed the dog, Jules felt a deep hunger. He wept, feeling the unfairness of his situation. The smell of tobacco from downstairs and the distant sound of an accordion playing a lullaby filled the room. Overwhelmed by hunger, Jules, in the middle of the night, quietly crept to the kitchen, his bare feet making no sound. Despite a moment of fear, he ventured on, driven by his intense need.|"[""1.

The moon's dim light barely illuminated the room, but the young boy's keen sense of smell guided him. He discovered a half-eaten cheese and bread, devouring them eagerly. Then, he stumbled upon a jar of goat's milk, gulping it down quickly until he had to pause for air. Suddenly, a sense of danger made him look up to find Brossard, a menacing figure, standing in the doorway. The child gasped in fear, dropping the crock of milk. Brossard unleashed his wrath, striking the boy repeatedly with a strap. Overwhelmed with terror, the boy wished for a fairy tale rescue.

Yesterday, Marie and I took a stroll by the river. There are benches under a row of trees where people wait for the tram-cars. We met Marie's friend, Clotilde Robard, who loves to gossip. We chatted about the old gate with the large scissors that is never opened. Clotilde used to work there before marrying the spice-monger. She shared a spooky story about a family curse on the gate. The eldest son, Mr. Martin Ciseaux, left suddenly to Algiers, leaving behind his grand-nephew, Jules, in the care of a mean caretaker. Clotilde thinks an orphanage would be better for Jules. It's like a fairy tale, with Jules resembling Prince Ethelried. Now I must hurry to post this letter before the evening train. Warm regards to everyone back home!|['1.

With no one around, she sang an old rhyme softly at first, then louder. Past the bend, a field with grazing goats came into view. On one side, a stone wall, and on two others, tall hedges. The boy she met, Jules, seemed lost in a dream. He mistook her song for his mother's call. They conversed in French. Jules shared his longing for his mother, his only memory. Joyce, cautious, spoke fast, eager to know more. She felt a bond with Jules through the song. Their friendship blossomed, a connection beyond strangers."|"['1.

In a charming garden, a rabbit was cooked slowly, giving Jules time to learn a new game. Finally, the meal was ready, accompanied by a lavish lunch. Despite Jules not recognizing all the dishes, the table was filled. The enchanting setting and Joyce's captivating storytelling made the dinner magical. Jules heard about Santa Claus and fairy tales for the first time, forgetting to eat in his fascination. As the meal ended, Jules, once a prince, returned to his duties as a goatherd. Unfortunately, the goats had destroyed the pony cart's cushions. Joyce, quick to ease Jules' distress, turned the mishap into part of their game. Jules left, reassured by Joyce's comforting words, while she faced the challenge of explaining the ruined cushions to madame.|"['1.

Above the fireplace hung a picture that had brought joy to Joyce since she moved into the charming blue room. It depicted an angel delivering gifts to fill a pair of little wooden shoes left out on a window-sill for Saint Noël. The French tradition of placing shoes out for gifts had enchanted Joyce. However, as Christmas approached, her excitement faded due to financial constraints. Tearfully, she realized there would be no presents for her family back home. A consoling thought about Jules, a boy she had helped, lifted her spirits. Later, she confessed her actions to madame, revealing her sacrifice of Christmas money to repair damages caused by goats. Madame, moved by Joyce's gesture, accompanied her to assess the damage. This act of kindness brought a glimmer of hope to Joyce's gloomy Thanksgiving Day.|"['1.

Joyce was thrilled to have a mischievous plan to scare old Brossard, who had been mean to Jules. She envisioned dressing up as a ghost with a pumpkin jack-o'-lantern on her head to stop him from being whipped again. Excitedly, she thought of a rhyme for Jules to call her when needed. Jules admired Joyce's bravery and wished he could be as fearless. Joyce spent the afternoon crafting a jack-o'-lantern out of a muff-box, adding hair from her mattress for a realistic touch.

The girl was thrilled with her creation, a monster's head made from pasteboard, complete with a long beard and fierce mustache. She lit a candle in a dark closet, where the monster's head glared at her. Excitedly, she imagined how her friend Jack would react to the scary creation. Meanwhile, as the short winter day neared its end, Jules tended to the goats in the field, trying to keep warm. Brossard, negotiating grain down the Paris road, relaxed in a tobacco shop. Henri, at home, diligently cleaned and prepared for the evening. As dusk approached, an old man arrived home, greeted by the cold, forbidding house.

Joyce, perched at her window, spotted Brossard heading home in his market-cart. She seized the opportunity to startle him while he tended to the horse. As dusk settled, she swiftly made her way along the hedges, aiming to reach the barn before Brossard. Hurriedly running bareheaded, she kept close to the wind-whipped hedge, concealing her movements. Ducking through a gap in the hedge just as Brossard arrived, she hid in the barn behind the door. Wrapping herself in a sheet, she lit a lantern, but the wind snuffed out the first matches. Panicked, she managed to light it just as Brossard prepared to punish Jules. With a banshee-like wail, she emerged, causing Brossard to cower in fear. Jules recognized her, but even he was taken aback by her terrifying guise. The commotion even startled Henri, who quickly retreated indoors at the sight of the ghostly figure.|"['1.

"The whole show might have lasted only a minute, but each of the sixty seconds felt like an eternity to Brossard. With a final fading moan, Joyce moved towards the gate, thrilled with her triumph, but her joy was short-lived. Just as she turned the house corner, someone lurking in the shadows grabbed her. A strong arm enveloped her, snatching the lantern and ripping the sheet from her face. Joyce was now terrified. ""Let me go!"" she screamed in English. With a fierce pull, she broke free, seeing Monsieur Ciseaux holding her. Face to face with him, Joyce boldly demanded answers for the mistreatment of Jules. She spoke out against the abuse, hoping for justice. Despite her fear, she stood her ground, showing courage.

Sister Denisa guided Joyce through a solemn courtyard to a spacious room where elderly individuals sat alone or strolled in the sun. The nun shared tales of these once affluent souls now residing at the shelter. Moved by the plight of those abandoned by ungrateful kin, Sister Denisa led Joyce upstairs to the dormitory. Here, rows of empty cots lined the walls, save for one occupied by an elderly lady, longing for her American past. Joyce felt the woman's yearning for privacy in the communal setting. Sister Denisa hoped Joyce could offer solace with her English background. As Joyce sat by the lady's side, the piercing gaze of the elderly woman met hers, initiating a conversation to bring comfort in their shared solitude.|['1.

"The simple question had a surprising impact on the elderly lady. She propped herself up on one elbow and reached out for Joyce's hand, pulling her closer. ""Ah,"" she exclaimed, ""you speak the language my husband taught me, the language my children spoke, but they're all gone now. I've returned to my homeland only to find solace in charity's embrace."" Tears streamed down her weathered face, and her lips quivered. Joyce felt helpless, unable to offer comfort. She gently patted the woman's hand, listening to her woes. The lady, aged seventy-three, longed for more than basic necessities. Despite the care from Sister Denisa, she craved warmth, companionship, and joy.

The child was afraid of his uncle's stern demeanor, not understanding why the old man made him tremble and grow pale. Clotilde suggested that Monsieur Jules should play with the boy to make him more like other children. However, Joyce was preoccupied with preparations for Christmas. Cousin Kate planned a grand Christmas tree event, involving thirty peasant children who had never seen one before. Jules arrived to find Joyce busy making candy bags for the tree. They discovered popping corn together, a novelty in France. Joyce encouraged Jules to be more confident around his uncle, Martin.

"Joyce observed Jules closely, tilting her head to the side. ""You lack daring for an American boy,"" she remarked. ""Unlike Judge Ward, who commands respect, even adults watch their words around him. His nephew Charley, however, fearlessly calls him 'Bill' and demands laughter. Charley's audacity has endeared him to the judge. You, on the other hand, are like a closed kernel, keeping your thoughts hidden. Be open and engaging with your uncle,"" Joyce advised.

Every day after school, Jules rushed to help Madame Gréville with Christmas preparations. He strung corn, measured nuts and candy for gift bags, and even went shopping with Cousin Kate and Joyce for presents. Jostled by holiday shoppers, he marveled at show windows and chose toys. Meanwhile, Joyce picked gifts for the girls. The tree was set up in a room near the library, with each item laid out nearby. Jules, fascinated by the decorations, saved broken ornaments and scraps. He even patched together tiny bags from fabric scraps. Jules borrowed Henri's spade to plant a small cedar tree. The housekeeper admired Jules' efforts, prompting him to plan to add mistletoe to the tree. Her kind words made Jules feel proud and joyful.|"['1.

Mr. Scissors, sitting by the fire with the door open between the two rooms, listened to Joyce's cheerful talk with almost as much interest as Jules. He eagerly awaited her daily footsteps on the stairs and felt a longing in his lonely old heart when the children's voices were no longer heard. The old Ciseaux house had seen happier times when two little brothers and a sister played in that very room. But misunderstandings had crept in, overshadowing their joy. Joyce shared about a lonely old woman they cared for, whom she wished to adopt as her grandmother. She dreamed of a beautiful home for her, filled with sunlight, adorned in rose-color, with mignonette on the window-sill, and gifts to bring her joy. Joyce was touched by the woman's story, especially about her cherished vinaigrette with a big D, a precious gift from her brother on her twelfth birthday. Joyce admired the woman's name, Désiré, finding it beautiful.|"[""1.

"Joyce hesitated as she gazed at the portrait above the mantel, exclaiming, ""There she is! That's Number Thirty-one, her very own self."" The old man, visibly shaken, corrected her, ""That is a picture of my mother, and Désiré is long dead."" Monsieur, agitated, shared, ""I had a sister once, named Désiré."" Joyce, puzzled, awaited his next words. Suddenly, he erupted, ""No, I never can forgive! She has been dead to me nearly a lifetime."" Jules, feeling empathy, reflected on Monsieur's loneliness. Jules had been crafting a Christmas tree for him but couldn't finish due to an injury.

Henri came to inform Joyce that Marie was ready to take her home. Joyce, relieved by the interruption, couldn't bring herself to praise the little tree as expected by Jules. She left with a somber expression, prompting Cousin Kate and Madame to inquire about her visit. Joyce felt a sense of dismissal from Cousin Kate, unaware of Madame's significant glances. She wandered the paths with her hands in her pockets, pondering Monsieur's odd behavior and the mystery surrounding him. Climbing a pear tree, she shared her thoughts with Solomon, wishing for fairy tale magic to resolve the family's troubles.

As the stars twinkled in the evening sky, Joyce gazed up, recalling a verse she and Jack had learned at her grandmother's house. The verse spoke of the power to create the heavens and the earth, reminding her that nothing was too difficult.

Surrounded by mystery, Joyce's family behaved strangely. Later, she learned that her long-lost relative, Aunt Désiré, was being brought home.

She marveled at the transformation and imagined the happiness it would bring to Number Thirty-one. Joyce credited the change to her acts of kindness and compassion towards others, which had led to the blossoming of the once barren environment. She was grateful for the gifts left in her slippers for Christmas, especially touched by a tiny buttonhole watch given by Cousin Kate.

Joyce was comforted by the rapid ticking of her little watch, realizing how quickly time flew. Thirty seconds passed, then sixty. She decided to enjoy her Christmas abroad without longing for home. The watch seemed to make the morning rush by as she checked it at least twenty times an hour. When Monsieur Ciseaux arrived to take her to bring his sister home, he treated her like a duchess. On the carriage ride, he was lost in memories, and Joyce sympathetically watched him. They arrived at the Little Sisters of the Poor, where Sister Denisa greeted them joyfully. Madame, who had been transformed by good news, walked proudly with Monsieur. They left the home, passing through the gates towards her old home, where the giant scissors no longer blocked their way.

At five o'clock in the evening, the sound of Gabriel's accordion filled the garden as thirty children marched along to its music. They weaved through the blooming laurel, led by the joyful tunes. Joyce finally understood why the room with the Christmas tree had been locked. For two days, the tree had been hidden in Monsieur Ciseaux's parlor as Cousin Kate, madame, Berthé, Marie, and Gabriel worked secretly. Now, Joyce joined the procession, crossing the road to the giant scissors gate. Each person in the line, either a child or a mother carrying a little one, shared loving hearts and gentle hands. As the tree lit up with tapers, children marveled at the glittering and sparkling sight, a display of stars, rainbows, and toys. The room filled with warmth as gifts were shared, making hearts glow with joy. The children sang a song about the pine tree, symbolizing the joy of Christmas. After the gifts were given out, the children circled the tree, expressing gratitude to madame, Cousin Kate, and Joyce.
