One of them purchased tickets, causing the other's annoyance. They vanished into the challenging regions along Harrowing Highway, settling noisily into seats near the aisle, close enough to the bandit, as one joked.

The detective turned train robber almost killed the millionaire in the desert, who then fatally wounded him. Scout Harris dozed off, missing the educational films. Mrs. Bartlett suggested he nap in the car. Pee-wee dreamt of ice cream and pistols. He woke in the car, realizing he was speeding away with armed strangers.

The car rolled slowly through a dark, narrow road that felt like a leafy tunnel. The silence and darkness made the outlaws' actions seem even more sinister. Pee-wee, the scout, felt his heart race as the car stopped. Should he run or confront them? The thieves' voices changed as they moved indoors, and Pee-wee sensed the walls closing in. The atmosphere grew tense under the heavy robe, suffocating him. Doors were bolted and footsteps faded away, leaving Pee-wee in darkness. The clanking of locks confirmed his fears - he was a prisoner. Panic set in as he realized he was miles from home, but relief washed over him as he was no longer with the scoundrels.

When his captors left, he felt a glimmer of hope. He didn't dare wish for freedom, but a moment of safety was all he sought. Time, the doomed's desperate plea. He held his breath, fearing the thieves might return. Their talk of harm lingered in his ears, urging him to stay silent. Sitting in the dark car, he longed for a friendly noise to break the eerie quiet. Every creak felt like a ghostly presence. Stepping out, he found himself in an old, rough-walled place. The smell and splinter confirmed its age. Alone, he heard faint breaths nearby, sending shivers down his spine. Was he in a prison of suffering souls? Pee-wee stood frozen, consumed by fear and curiosity in the mysterious darkness.|"['1. What did the captors leave him with when they departed?\nA. A glimmer of hope\nB. A sense of freedom\nC.

In a sudden burst of recklessness, Pee-wee abandoned his fears and fumbled his way towards a faint noise. His hand found a small round object with a tube attached. As he explored further, he encountered a smooth, continuous surface. With relief, he realized he had stumbled upon the spare tire, emitting a faint sound from a leaky valve. The darkness had played tricks on him, but he was now relieved. Discovering the red tail light, Pee-wee felt foolish for not realizing it sooner. He then found the switch for the car lights and bathed the dark space in brightness. Curious about the car's controls, he accidentally started the engine.

Pee-wee Harris, a dedicated scout, found himself in a perilous situation. Trapped in a car filling with poisonous fumes, he acted swiftly. Despite his initial blunders, his scout training kicked in. With a cut finger, he improvised, using his handkerchief to cover his mouth and ears. This quick thinking bought him a brief respite. With determination and knowledge of scout law, he sought a way out. Feeling his way to the back of the car, he remembered the doors the thieves had closed.

Groping behind the car, Pee-wee found an iron band with a wooden plug. He opened a wide door to a refreshing autumn breeze, welcoming him to the woods he loved. The stars sparkled overhead, and the air was filled with the scent of fall. Pee-wee felt at home in this natural paradise, despite being brought there by auto thieves. The old shack near the lake, likely an ice-house, stood weather-beaten. Pee-wee saw a village in the distance, bustling with activity. Lights from West Ketchem and a smaller village across the lake illuminated the peaceful scene. A red light in the center of the lake caught Pee-wee's attention, perhaps a lone boat out in the water.|"['1.

In the serene surroundings, Pee-wee couldn't find any signs of the rumored capture of a maiden. His sharp vision spotted a boat on the shore, possibly mistreated by the scoundrels. Worried that the captors might be harming their victim on the lake, Pee-wee's priority was to find his way home, two hours away. As he wandered towards a nearby village, the dimly lit houses made him feel lost and lonely. Eventually, he stumbled upon a burnt building, the West Ketchem Public School. Despite the desolation, Pee-wee found a strange fascination in the ruined school, where books and school items lay scattered. The sight of the school in ruins intrigued him, and he couldn't resist exploring the remnants of the once vibrant educational institution.|"['1.

"One influence made him pause. What to do? The town was dimly lit. As a scout, he hesitated to ask for shelter. His training taught him self-reliance. He wanted to find his way home alone.

We settled matters with your parents, and most of them are relieved to see you go. Guess what, Safety First? Corby's sister is throwing a party and hopes he won't show up. Oh, and we bought some fishing gear. Then we filled up with gas and headed to Bridgeboro for the cup. We were really determined, just like Sir Thomas Lipton. The jeweler hadn't finished engraving, so we popped into a movie and saw a guy with a bunch of guns. How many guns were there, First Aid? Counted them on the way back in the car, there were seventy. Crazy, right? That's the kind of thing you guys get into. After the gun show, we snagged the cup and drove back. Any questions? We left it in the car. We'll grab it in the morning. Listen up, scouts. I want each of you to go for that cup. Some of you need to step up. Stop the talk about hunting animals and focus on winning the cup with the best scout deed of the season. Got it? I was telling Safety First on the ride home that sneaking up on an animal with a camera is more fun than messing around with an old BB gun from a magazine ad. That's the deal!

"Nick, in a humorous yet serious tone, declared, ""It can't be done; a scout needs sleep, it's a crucial rule. But I must peek at that cup before resting. Let's row over, Fido."" Scoutmaster Ned interjected, ""I doubt anyone can take anything from you."" Urging them to leave, he jokingly wished for them to attend a school opening the next day.

When Peter saw the bright light shining on the ladder, revealing spiders and broken rungs, he felt a mix of curiosity and fear. The light exposed the chaos and decay around him, making even old law books look new.

As a lonely pioneer scout, Peter sat in his room absorbed in his handbook, dreaming of the scout brothers he had never met.

In his solitude, Peter imagined scouts gathered around a campfire, sharing stories. He knew these lucky scouts went tracking in pairs and had close friendships in their patrols. Peter dreamt of convincing Abner, who lived far away and had health issues, to join the scouts with him. His uncle in New York, who managed a building, made a good living. Peter planned to ask him about real scouts with khaki suits and tools. Trying out an axe in the woodshed, Peter pretended a political button was a scout badge. He read his scout handbook diligently while scout leaders arrived at the lake. As he read about scout standards, a strange figure passed his window, sparking his curiosity.

Peter fumbled for his old broomstick piece to prop the window open, leaning out to gaze at the quiet graveyard where his ancestors rested. Despite the silence, he strained to spot Deacon Small's tombstone. Trembling, he couldn't look away, fearing the unknown. Had something from the graveyard visited his window?

Far away, a mysterious voice called to Peter Piper, a pioneer scout from Piper's Crossroads. Unsure of its reality, Peter hesitated to believe he was being beckoned into the world of scouting. Feeling out of place among seasoned scouts, he clung to his humble life. Despite the message, Peter remained skeptical, wondering if he was merely seeing things.

Peter, armed with just a jack-knife, freed a calf tied to a rope. Curiously, the calf watched as Peter moved a peg, limiting its freedom.

"Nick Vernon, appearing calm and indifferent, approached Scoutmaster Ned as he descended from a stump. In a nonchalant tone, Nick requested, ""May I have that stump a minute?"" He then revealed that the signal he sent was decoded by a scout who stopped a car and rescued a cup. The scout, Peter Piper, tried to keep his scouting a secret but was caught. Nick proudly declared he had evidence of Peter's scouting and emphasized his honesty. As Peter hesitantly picked up the cup, Scout Harris, known for his antics, suddenly burst into a silly song, causing a commotion. The scene unfolded with Peter becoming a hero in his town, just as his mother had hoped. Scout Harris, a character from the Tom Slade and Roy Blakeley books, added his unique flair to the moment."|"['1.
