In 1876, I returned to Crooked Creek Church in Middle Georgia, near Rockville, by chance and sentiment. I was astounded by the changes in just a few years. The old oak trees remained, but time had left its mark everywhere else. The church seemed smaller, the pulpit less grand. The preacher had aged, losing his vigor. New faces filled the pews, replacing familiar ones. The once youthful congregation now bore the weight of hardships. Amidst this change, I noticed Mingo, an old carriage-driver from my childhood. While he appeared unchanged physically, the joy and humor that once defined him were replaced by a somber gravity. The church service paused for a midday break, where practical matters were discussed over shared meals, showcasing the community's simple and warm hospitality.|"[""1.

Teague Poteet and Woodward were not ones to waste time. They decided to cut through the country to shorten the long distance from Atlanta to Hog Mountain.

Sis, Teague's daughter, seemed somewhat prepared for their arrival but blushed deeply when Woodward took her hand. She ran to her father, feeling a mix of emotions.

The elderly lady began to weep softly as she recalled a memory, moving those who heard her to tears as well. Despite their limited lives, the tale of the girl seemed to uplift and motivate all gathered around the fireplace that evening at Teague Poteet's. The history of Pinetucky District in Putnam County is only passed down through stories, but it holds a positive reputation. The settlement has vanished, replaced by a busy man breeding Jersey cattle and experimenting with ensilage. Pinetucky had its quirks but also its charms. The people were content with their surroundings and were not puzzled by the origin of the name. It was a close-knit community with a shared church and schoolhouse. Squire Ichabod Inchly, the wheelwright, held justice-court when needed, embodying the Pinetucky spirit. The wealthiest man, Bradley Gaither, was not well-liked despite his success. His obsession with acquiring more land led him to mistreat his workers and prioritize his selfish desires over community relations.|"[""1.

In Pinetucky, Bradley Gaither's confession surprised the townspeople, yet they believed he had a good heart deep down. When Jack Carew returned, Miss Jane welled up with tears at the sight of him, but quickly composed herself and led him to a room. The Kendrick Place in Putnam County exudes an air of mystery with its neglected appearance. The old house, adorned with signs of decay, stands isolated, adding to the atmosphere of desolation. The roof, covered in moss, and the crumbling columns of the veranda contribute to the eerie charm. A fig tree, symbolizing antiquity, thrives near the house, adding to the sense of mystery. Built in 1836 by Felix Kendrick, the house was a statement of ambition in the region. Grandsir Kendrick, a hatter turned overseer, amassed wealth and property, setting the foundation for the family's prosperity. His son, Felix, married a woman of superior qualities, shaping the family's legacy.|['1.

In 1850, Mrs. Felix Kendrick became the widow Kendrick, with her daughter Kitty blossoming into a beautiful young woman and her son Felix showing remarkable promise. Losing her husband was a heavy blow for Mrs. Kendrick, who deeply cherished her family and home. Felix was laid to rest under a tree he planted as a boy, visible from his mother's window. The funeral was simple, with a prayer and a song. Mrs. Kendrick's missionary brother, freshly returned from China, was set to deliver the funeral sermon. On the day of the sermon, two neighbors met on the way to Rockville, discussing the impact of big speeches and hoping for a truthful tribute to the late Felix Kendrick.|"['Question 1: What was the relationship between Mrs. Felix Kendrick and her daughter Kitty in 1850?\nA) They were neighbors\nB) They were business partners\nC) They were family members\nD) They were classmates\nE) They were strangers', 'Question 2: How did Mrs. Kendrick feel about her family and home?\nA) She was indifferent\nB) She was angry\nC) She cherished them deeply\nD) She was jealous\nE) She was resentful', 'Question 3: Where was Felix Kendrick laid to rest?\nA) Under a bridge\nB) Under a tree he planted\nC) In a church\nD) In the backyard\nE) In a cemetery', ""Question 4: Who was set to deliver the funeral sermon for Felix Kendrick?\nA) A stranger\nB) A neighbor\nC) A coworker\nD) Mrs. Kendrick\nE) Mrs. Kendrick's missionary brother"", 'Question 5: What were the neighbors discussing on the way to Rockville?\nA) The weather\nB) The latest fashion trends\nC) The impact of big speeches\nD) Their favorite books\nE) Their vacation plans', 'Question 6: What were the neighbors hoping for in the tribute to Felix Kendrick?\nA) A fictional story\nB) A truthful tribute\nC) A comedy act\nD) A dance performance\nE) A magic show']"|"['C) They were family members', 'C) She cherished them deeply', 'B) Under a tree he planted', ""E) Mrs. Kendrick's missionary brother"", 'C) The impact of big speeches', 'B) A truthful tribute']"
Brother Brannum and Brother Roach were on their way to Felix Kendrick's funeral. They arrived to find a large crowd, but managed to secure seats under a fig tree. Brother Roach was in good spirits, suggesting they could hear the singing and then each preach their own sermon. Brother Brannum, a pillar of Bethesda church, seemed disappointed not to be closer to the preacher. They discussed the service and made light-hearted comments about the proceedings. As the preacher began his eulogy, Brother Roach noticed a powerful-looking negro listening attentively from the roof. Startled by a falling acorn, the man quickly disappeared from view.|"[""1.

"""Wow!"" exclaimed Brother Roach, looking amazed. ""Who would have thought it? From the nigger in the woodpile to the nigger in the steeple, and soon they'll be flying in the air. I call it the boldness of the devil. Do you know that nigger, Brother Brannum?""

""Well, when that nigger passes by Uncle Johnny, you'd swear his daguerreotype was taken. That slick nigger perched up there so cool is Bledser's Blue Dave,"" replied Brother Brannum.

""My eyes see it differently. They say he's as strong as a horse, venomous as a snake, swift as the wind, and slick as a fox. For nearly seven years, that nigger's been roaming the woods, defying the law,"" said Brother Roach.

Brother Brannum agreed but with reluctance. Blue Dave was a legendary figure, a terror to all. His elusive nature made him a mystery, and many attributed supernatural powers to him. He was a giant in folklore, an evil spirit. People feared him, and any mischief was blamed on Blue Dave. He was a creature of mystery and fear, leaving a lasting impression on the community."|"['1.

Blue Dave's history was shrouded in mystery. He arrived in Rockville village in chains, brought by a speculator on a train with forlorn-looking individuals. Despite warnings that he was unmanageable and not worth buying, Blue Dave was a striking man, strong and pleasant-faced. Sold to General Alfred Bledser, he worked briefly but fled to the woods after a dispute. Despite efforts to capture him, Blue Dave eluded everyone, causing fear among the settlement. When he was found near the Kendrick house, the household was shaken.

Blue Dave sadly expressed his feelings to Miss Kitty, stating that the place wasn't a home for him. He bid her farewell and left quietly, causing Kitty to feel both frightened and puzzled.

Felix, unapologetic, threatened to stop helping her if she revealed the secret. Kitty shook him in shock and scolded him for his actions, fearing their mother's heartbreak.

"""Has anyone ever seen the beat of that?"" he exclaimed. ""If Mars. George gets in that creek, there's got to be a miracle if he gets out."" He stood in the road a moment longer, scratching his head, puzzled. Then he addressed himself indignantly. ""Look here, why are you standing here? Where are your manners, where is your politeness?"" Half-humorously, half-seriously, talking to himself, Blue Dave trotted along in the direction taken by George Denham. He moved with amazing swiftness, but he couldn't hope to overtake him before he reached the creek. George Denham was impatient to get home, thinking of pretty Kitty Kendrick. As he neared the creek, his horse grew hesitant, splashing water with its feet. Unaware of the danger, he was picturing his future, but the horse stopped, uneasy. A low snort signaled its uneasiness, and when George tried to urge it forward, it struck the water impatiently. George looked around, but there was no warning. The horse plunged into the flood, with George clinging to the buggy. Blue Dave leaped into the water, rescued George, and carried him safely back to land."|"[""1.

Blue Dave gently lifted George Denham onto his broad shoulders, assuring him not to fear falling.
