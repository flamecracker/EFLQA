"""Oh, for Hodge!"" he thought. ""I see now that our handicap means disaster unless the wind changes."" Ready was crouching under the bat, nervous, but determined. Badger took his time, but put terrible speed into the next ball, which he sent over the inner corner of the plate. The batter struck at it, but missed clean. The ball struck in Ready's hand. It dropped to the ground. The bases were filled, and the batter was out, for all that Jack had not held the ball. He recovered it so that there was no possibility for the man on third to get home. Now two men were out, but the bags were filled, and a long, safe hit meant more scores for the visitors. Fleetwood, the Hartford third-baseman, took his turn at the stick. He was a good waiter, and he found just what he wanted, sending it safe over the short-stop, so that two more scores came in."|"['1.

During the baseball game, there was an attempt at a double steal by the men on bases. The runner on second successfully reached third, but the runner behind him was tagged out at second by Ready's throw. Jack's throw should have gone to third base, but it went low to second instead. This led to a passed ball, allowing a run in for the opposing team. Despite the setback, Frank hoped that Badger would prevent further scoring. However, miscommunication between Buck and Jack resulted in another run for the visitors. Even though the game continued, the players felt a shift in momentum when Merriwell took over as the pitcher, boosting their confidence. Frank's strategic pitching and guidance helped the team regain control, with Ready improving his performance significantly.|"['1.

Lee assured that he would contemplate the situation carefully. He expressed his reluctance to be unjust or overly severe. Once having held Badger in high regard, Lee now found his recent behavior despicable. Meanwhile, Merriwell, unaware of Badger's anxious wait, extended his visit with Inza and Elsie. As the hour grew late, events elsewhere were escalating. Fairfax Lee, fearing for his life, rushed home. Bill Gaston, driven mad by political disappointment, had escaped and posed a threat. Burglars, mistaking Lee's absence for an opportunity, targeted his home for a heist.

Fairfax Lee was in a fierce fight for his life against two burglars on the stairs, while the sounds of the struggle continued above. Despite the imminent danger, Lee was determined to subdue his opponent, whom he believed to be Bill Gaston. Oblivious to the approaching burglars, Lee struggled to overpower his adversary, fearing the consequences of being caught due to his past.

The large tug, _Gladiator_, was pulling a line of heavy barges when disaster struck. Despite all efforts to avoid it, the _Merry Seas_ collided with one of the barges with immense force. The impact was so strong that it felt like a horse crashing into a solid wall. The shock was overwhelming, causing Merriwell to be thrown off his feet as the _Merry Seas_ plunged downward from the collision. He found himself hurtling through the air before hitting the water and sinking below. Despite the danger, he managed to stay conscious and began to swim towards a distant sound. As he struggled in the cold water, he heard a familiar voice nearby. Following the sound, he found himself on a makeshift raft, being held afloat by someone else.

There was a moment of quiet. Both listened intently. Faint whistles echoed in the distance. A voice was heard, possibly from a ship or a person in the water. Steamers and tugs blared their whistles near and far. They shouted loudly, hoping to be heard. They struggled to determine the boat's direction. Holding hands, they managed to stay afloat on buoyant boards. As they drifted, they talked, listened, and called out. The foghorn and distant whistles continued.

Merriwell and Hodge spotted a fishing-sloop not far away, but the men aboard seemed indifferent to their cries for help. Inza, a young lady, appeared on deck, fleeing from a man who tried to stop her from jumping overboard. Ignoring Merriwell's calls, the man carried Inza back into the cabin. Determined to rescue her, Merriwell swiftly shed his heavy clothes and swam towards the sloop. Despite the men on the sloop not noticing the raft, Merriwell's plan was to surprise them and save Inza. Bart, on the raft, watched anxiously as Merriwell swam towards the sloop with remarkable strength. Merriwell returned to the raft, explaining that the men on the sloop were oblivious to their calls due to their deafness.

After Merriwell's tremendous efforts, he felt drained once the excitement subsided. Bart, numb and cold from the water, supported Merriwell as he rested on the boards. As the fog lifted, the sun set, signaling a challenging night ahead. The sight of a fishing sloop in the distance revived their hope. Slowly drifting towards it, they approached cautiously. Armed with a makeshift club, Merriwell and Bart encountered a man and his fierce dog on the sloop. A scuffle ensued, with Bart bravely fending off the dog while Merriwell engaged in a fierce struggle with the man. Despite the man's strength, Merriwell's fighting skills prevailed.

Merriwell let go of the man he had knocked down, and the guy got up dazed and grumpy. Inza rushed over, yelling and gesturing. The man didn't understand her, and it looked like they both wanted to attack Bart and Merriwell. The whole scene was odd, like something out of a funny play. The fishing boat rocked on the waves, the dog unsure, one man flashing a lantern at Bart, and the other looking like he might charge at Merriwell. Inza came back with a note explaining things. When she showed it to the men, they suddenly changed their attitude. They rescued Inza after she fell overboard, mistaking her actions as odd.

"The small cabin, known as the ""cuddy,"" provided by the fishermen, smelled of fish and grease. Inside, there were bunks on two sides, a rusty stove in the center emitting steam from their wet clothes, and a makeshift writing desk. The place was cluttered with sea-boots, oilskin coats, nets, and fishing gear. The three friends were worried about others who went overboard, especially the father. They hoped for the best, considering themselves fortunate. Merry suggested seeking help from the fishermen or taking the sloop to the city themselves.

They were very hungry and eagerly devoured the supper that Inza had managed to prepare with the limited ingredients available. The wet fog had descended once more, chilling Frank and Bart to the core in their damp clothes. While the fishermen on deck seemed unfazed, chatting and smoking in their oilskins, Merry, Hodge, and Inza stayed up late discussing the day's events and the mystery surrounding Barney Mulloy's murder near Sea Cove. Frank hoped for a breeze to persuade the Slocums to drop them off at the nearest point, using money as leverage. However, the fog persisted, and they all settled in for the night. The next morning, the sun dispersed the fog, revealing other boats and a steamer on the horizon.

The Slocums were relieved not to set sail immediately and decided to fish off the sloop. Their dog, still nursing injuries from Bart, remained hostile.

Merriwell and Hodge were startled by the ghostly figure they saw near the building. Hodge, initially speechless, was convinced someone was playing a prank. They searched the grounds but found no one. Merriwell, curious, decided to keep watch in the corridor. The silence was unnerving, and he pondered over possible explanations for the mysterious footsteps. He considered that the sounds might have come from a servant or a sleepwalker. As he stood in the dark, his thoughts raced, and the minutes felt like ages. Despite the eerie atmosphere, Merriwell remained rational, realizing there could be a logical explanation for the strange events.|"[""1.

"""But that doesn't explain what I saw and what Bart saw!"" he whispered. ""I might have thought my eyes deceived me, but Bart saw it, too. That was either Barney Mulloy, or someone who looks remarkably like him. If it was really Barney, then the poor fellow is not dead! I sincerely hope we shall find out that he was not killed. Perhaps the entire newspaper report was based on a mistake. The papers are full of errors.""

As he spoke, he saw the ghostly figure again, but much farther away. Its face was turned toward the window, and the moonlight revealed it plainly. Beyond all question, it was the face of Barney Mulloy! The mysterious figure drew quickly back into the shrubbery and disappeared. 

The time was well on toward morning before Merriwell and Hodge turned in to try to get some sleep. No more mysterious sounds or ghostly appearances had been heard or seen. The sun was scarcely up when they were aroused by a trampling of feet and the sounds of well-known voices in the corridor. A knock came on Merry's door.

Merriwell's friends were invited to join a group of students to quickly reach their destination. They were brought to Sandy Hook by the government steamer _General Meigs_ and then rushed to Glen Springs on the steamer's large steam-launch. Merriwell was skeptical about rumors of his haunted house affecting business. He planned to return that night with Mr. Hodge and investigate further. The investigation in the village revealed no trace of Barney Mulloy. Despite the mystery, the trip to Sandy Hook was enjoyable. The group received a warm welcome from Captain Isaac Heath at the proving-grounds. They witnessed the firing of a ten-inch breech-loading rifle and a twelve-inch rifle, learning about the powerful weapons.
