The Customs Chief reiterated the mission to the three Ranger Boys before they set out to tackle fur smugglers near the Canadian border. Garry, the leader, was the son of a wealthy lumberman. Phil, of French descent, had a modest background and could speak French fluently. Dick, a chubby boy, was raised by Garry's father after his own parents passed away. The boys, aided by an old hermit and a kind Maine guide, had already faced various challenges, including rescuing a kidnapped child. Equipped with a wireless telephone from a grateful father, the trio was tasked with uncovering the smugglers' operations using discreet signals and clever tactics. With their resourcefulness and bravery, the boys were entrusted with this important mission to protect their country's borders.|"[""1.

"""Yelled Phil as Dick swiftly entered the door to make a call. Following suit, Phil also made his call while Garry waited. After their task, they headed to a restaurant for dinner, drawing attention in their khaki clothes resembling uniforms, forest shoepacks, and campaign hats. Despite the looks, they were mistaken for boys going camping rather than seasoned adventurers. They decided to catch the early train to Bangor for a productive evening. Passing through Waterville and seeing Colby College, they arrived in Bangor at five o'clock, known for its paper mills and salmon pools. After supper at the Penobscot Exchange, they visited a gunsmith and attended a movie.

Phil, thwarted in his pursuit, shifted focus to an elderly man. He handed him the troublesome paper and assured him all was well. Quickly stashing the paper, he signaled with two soft whistles. A loud crash followed, and three men rushed past them. Seeking refuge, they hid in a doorway. Moving through narrow streets, they reached a well-lit area. Phil approached a policeman, explaining the situation. The officer, convinced of their honesty, called for backup. As they awaited help, the police lieutenant and a doctor arrived. The doctor deduced the man had died from neglect and shock, not the earlier wound. The lieutenant, aggressive, tried to interrogate them but was stopped by the doctor.

"""I think you exaggerate your duty, lieutenant. Boys, this is informal questioning; you don't have to answer. It seems like a misunderstanding. Tell me your side. If you're innocent, speak up,"" the Chief said. The Forest Rangers explained they were seeking a gunsmith for a lost rifle when they heard screams from an old house.

The boys were anxious as time dragged on. They were worried about losing precious time to buy supplies for their journey back to Canal Street. If they were delayed, they would miss their early train and lose almost a day. To pass the time, they played checkers until the Chief of Police called Mr. Ardmore. The Chief had picked them up after they found a dead man, but Mr. Ardmore vouched for them as Forest Rangers. The Chief was surprised and wished them luck. The boys then rushed back to Canal Street to buy a rifle for Phil and supplies for their mission. The old gunsmith reopened his shop for them, and they quickly got what they needed. Garry even bought a revolver for their upcoming adventure.|['1.

Dick and his friends were planning their camping trip. They needed new pocket knives after Dick broke his and Phil's was taken by LeBlanc and Anderson. The old gunsmith suggested a heavy blade knife with a can opener for their trip. They also planned to buy concentrated foods like chocolate bars and soup. Lieutenant Murphy warned them to be careful in the woods. Later, when they returned to their hotel, they found Nate waiting for them.

Dick was confident that the three burglars had escaped, possibly with assistance. Nate suggested calling 'Moose Boone' to inquire. Dick proposed contacting Sam Preston, a newspaperman, for information. The call was made, and while waiting for a response, Nate explained he was summoned by the Chief Ranger to guide the boys. Garry received a call from Sam Preston, who revealed the burglars were released on bail and now wanted by the authorities. Dick recalled seeing one burglar and avoided confrontation. Phil then shared his adventure on the second floor, including a torn map with clues to a lost mine. Nate discouraged pursuing the map, citing his knowledge of the area.

The boys, full of dreams about discovering a lost gold mine in the Maine wilderness, remained undeterred by Nate's doubts. They planned to explore the spot marked on the map to uncover the mystery. Nate, wanting to share important information about Hobart, described the town as a former lumbering hub near the Canadian border. He explained the government's forest preservation efforts and warned about the town's rough reputation. Despite not recalling anyone from Hobart, Nate promised to gather more details. The boys, eager for their new adventure, woke early the next day, bid farewell to Nate, and boarded the train. The journey was lively, with various passengers engaging in card games. Phil overheard two men speaking in French behind him, while Garry and Dick chatted animatedly throughout the trip.|"[""1.

Garry had a feeling that Phil overheard something important. To avoid suspicion, they played chess. Phil then signaled them to follow him to another train car. Phil shared that two men were likely involved in smuggling furs. They decided Phil would tail them if they left the train. Back in the smoker car, the men joined a card game, pausing their talk. Garry noticed a man watching them. As the man approached, Garry introduced himself and his friends. The man's knowledge about hunting seasons raised suspicion. When Dick asked about Hobart, it attracted the man's attention. Despite Garry's warning, the slip-up was made.|"['1.

Dick, who was cautious after Garry's warning, shared with the man named Fernald that they heard their guide, Webster, mention the location not far above the National Forest Reserve. This seemed to ease suspicion momentarily, but Garry knew better than to reveal too much. They engaged in conversation about the woods, being careful not to disclose their mission. Fernald persistently tried to pry into their reason for heading to a specific part of Maine. As they neared a town with a restaurant, Fernald hinted at smuggling activities across the International line. Garry sensed Fernald's probing and suspicions grew. At the restaurant, Fernald subtly signaled to Garry, revealing himself as a customs officer. The boys kept quiet, realizing the danger of being overheard. They finished their meal, still surprised by the revelation. Garry hinted at a crucial clue they had stumbled upon, but they were unsure of their next steps upon reaching their destination.|"[""1.

"""We have a plan in place. If they disembark, Phil will tail them to keep track of their movements. Our hope is that they will lead us to the source of what we are seeking,"" he explained. ""However, my presence alters things. It would be wise for me to shadow them for two reasons.

"""Quick, head for the train, boys,"" commanded Garry urgently. ""Let's avoid being seen. I bet they're heading to the Canadian border since they've skipped bail and are likely aiming for the national boundary. It'll be tougher to bring them back if they cross into Canada."" ""I just hope they keep moving and don't linger,"" Phil added. ""Our hunt for the smugglers might lead us to unfriendly faces and old foes at our new base."" The boys secured berths on the train for the night ride, exhausted from the previous night's adventures. The next morning, they scanned the train and depot area for the tramps but found nothing. They discussed setting up camp near Hobart and decided to venture into the woods to build a shelter. The town of Hobart, with its general store and old buildings, lay across the tracks. The boys planned to explore the surrounding timber lands controlled by a paper company.

The boys sat on tall stools, enjoying their meal. They stayed alert, hoping to gather information about the band they sought. After eating, Phil wanted to linger, but Garry insisted they find a camping spot before dark. They retrieved their gear and headed to the woods, filling their canteens on the way. As dusk approached, they halted at the forest edge. They quickly built a fire, gathered firewood, and made a bed of spruce boughs. At dawn, Garry woke the others for breakfast over a campfire.

In the woods, the boys built crude shelters using brush and saplings. Leaving the front open, they planned to build another lean-to opposite. Between them, a campfire could be made. The shacks offered protection in fair weather but would be useless in heavy rain. They stored firewood and made beds from balsam branches. After lunch, they found a boundary marker between the United States and Canada. On their return, they found a man using their campfire. He explained he got hungry and would make it right next time.

The experienced gum hunter explained his unique job to the city boys. He gathers spruce gum from the woods to sell to drug stores. He also collects herbs like sassafras root and checkerberry to sell to the same druggists. In addition, he guides parties, traps in winter, and works on log drives in the spring. He shared that living in the woods offers independence and varied work, unlike working in a store. The boys were intrigued by his stories and shared their camping plans. The hunter advised them on fishing spots and demonstrated how to clean dishes efficiently using water, earth, and heat.

The old gum hunter sat by the fire, puffing on his pipe, and quizzed the boys about their camping trip. He was curious why they had traveled so far when there were forests closer to home. Suspiciously, he asked if they were involved in smuggling. Garry, a sharp boy, revealed they were Forest Rangers setting up a phone service. The old man praised their work and lamented the destruction of trees. He also expressed concern about smuggling near the Canadian border. Garry subtly hinted at investigating smugglers, and the old man, a law-abiding citizen with a family history of upholding laws, supported their duty.

Smuggling occurs in this region, particularly in Hobart. If one observes certain individuals entering through the back door of a restaurant at night, they might identify the smugglers. The townspeople here don't see the point in paying duty on goods from neighboring Canada. As night fell, the boys cooked a stew using canned beef, potatoes, and carrots. Making a meat stew in the woods is simple: cut the meat and vegetables into small pieces, simmer in water over coals, and ensure it doesn't dry out. While Dick cooked the stew, Phil and Garry gathered wood. Dick used a sapling as a rolling pin to make biscuits. For a dozen biscuits, mix flour, baking powder, salt, shortening, and water, then bake over hot coals.|"['1.

After baking biscuits over the campfire, the friends settled down for the night. Suddenly, a gleaming pair of eyes in the distance startled them. Garry, alert and armed, took aim at the mysterious creature advancing towards them. With a precise shot, the animal fell silent. Upon closer inspection, they found it to be a large bobcat. Satisfied that the threat was neutralized, they returned to their camp. Despite the late-night adventure, Dick remembered to soak beans for the next day's meal. As the forest quieted down once more, the boys drifted back to sleep, planning to skin and tan the bobcat the next day.|"['1.

When morning arrived, Garry was the first to wake up. He sneakily moved the bobcat's body to the lean-to behind the firewood pile while his friends were still asleep. Phil, waking up shortly after, looked around for the bobcat and was surprised to find it missing. Dick, grumbling as he woke up, splashed his face in the brook and then noticed the absence of the animal's body. When questioned by his friends, Garry pretended innocence until Dick stumbled upon the hidden bobcat. Realizing his forgetfulness in soaking the beans, Dick pieced together the events of the night before. The boys kept straight faces as Dick narrated his dream-like experience. Dud offered to stuff the bobcat and shared stories of similar encounters in the region, hinting at suspicious activities nearby without revealing too much. Phil speculated on Dud's cautiousness, suspecting his reluctance to disclose information stemmed from personal connections to the secretive group.|"[""1.

Searching for matches, he remembered his trick of keeping them under his hat band. Lighting a match, he discovered an iron shuttered window and a thick door, making escape seem impossible.

Phil, unable to sleep on the broken cot, propped it up as best as he could. Failing to find comfort, he lay on the floor. As he dozed, faint voices caught his attention. Convinced it was his imagination, he tried to rest but was kept awake by excitement. Hearing the voices again, he sat up. To occupy himself, he drilled a hole in the floor, suspecting it was made of boards. Listening through the hole, he overheard a conversation about a fur smuggling trip. Phil realized the deserted logging camp was likely the smuggling band's base. He also learned that Anderson was already across the border buying furs. LeBlanc hinted at a bigger scheme that would bring them fortune. As the conversation unfolded, a commotion arose downstairs, with LeBlanc deciding to discuss the new plan the next night without P'tit Vareau present.|"['1.

Phil's heart raced with excitement as he had all the details of the plot at his fingertips. Garry and Dick, unaware of Phil's capture, discussed his potential discovery of crucial information. Phil, trapped in an old French restaurant, remained vigilant throughout the night. In the morning, he readied himself with a makeshift weapon, prepared for any opportunity to escape. LeBlanc, anticipating Phil's resistance, thwarted his attempt to strike back. Phil's only hope was to set fire to the door as a last resort. As the day passed with no sign of rescue, Phil's hunger and thirst grew. With LeBlanc planning to dispose of him in the river, Phil clung to the slim hope of his friends coming to his aid at sundown.

Walking quickly, the boys headed towards Green's farm. With no moon in the sky, the darkness promised rain, which was good for them. They arrived at the farm after fifteen minutes, making their way cautiously to the barn. The barn loomed like a dark giant. Excitement surged through the boys as they felt they were close to finding the smugglers they were after. They devised a plan - one would enter the house, two would explore the barn, and one would stand guard. They drew lots to decide who would enter the house.

After walking about twenty feet through a tunnel-like passage, Garry entered a room. On one side were empty casks, and on the other side, a table with a bundle of fine sealskin. Garry realized the skins were illegally obtained. He then uncovered a trapdoor leading to a cellar, where he had to be cautious to avoid being caught by men guarding the exit.

Walking cautiously, as if the floor were covered with fragile eggs, he made his way to the other door of the room. After taking a few moments to gather his courage, he gently opened the door and discovered that he was in a bedroom. The room was empty, with no sound of breathing coming from the bed. To orient himself, he scanned the dimly lit room without using his lamp, noticing a faint light seeping through the window. Approaching the window, he confirmed it was open due to the warm night. Searching for a light source to locate the register, he felt disappointed at first. However, upon crawling towards the bed, he encountered a heavy rag rug. Peering down into the room below, he recognized Jean LeBlanc, Lafe Green, and three other unfamiliar figures.

For years, I served as the private secretary to the wealthy Grand Duke Sidis in Russia. He owned magnificent jewels, second only to those of his cousin, Grand Duke Boris. During the war, the Bolsheviks took power. To protect the jewels, we hid them. Fearing for our lives, my brother and I pretended to be Bolsheviks and fled with the jewels.

Garry suggested a plan where they would estimate the point on the back of Green's farm where the men might cross the border. They would then position themselves about a sixteenth of a mile apart in tall trees with binoculars to spot the crossing. The plan included repeating the operation on Saturday for confirmation. Mr. Everett, despite his injuries, insisted on managing the stairs himself. The banter between Mr. Everett and Ruth revealed a playful dynamic. The morning breakfast was delightful, with perfectly cooked eggs, crispy bacon, and delicious coffee and biscuits.

Garry had gathered valuable information about fur smuggling thanks to a tip on two buyers. Concerned for his friends in a foreign country, he traveled by train but got delayed. Luckily, he convinced a fast freight crew to give him a ride, arriving much quicker. Using his glasses, Garry calculated the distance to the border and the Green farm, guiding his friends accurately. They tracked their steps carefully and reached a spot in line with the farm. Garry instructed them to wait after the suspects passed, describing them to Dick. After a long wait in a tree, Garry heard a familiar signal. Dick confirmed the suspects' passage and marked the trail. Stiff from the tree, they decided to head back to town, having done all they could in the thrilling case.|"['1.

"Not more than twenty feet above where I was located. Evidently they do not cut a straight line from the farm, but slant a little, unless our reckoning was a bit off. It is likely that they swerve a bit, because there may be a pathway across the farm that they use to get here. Believe me, I held my breath as they went by, although there was little danger of their seeing me. I strained my ears to see what they might be talking about, but could get nothing, as they talked in a low tone,"" answered Dick.""That's a good idea.

After dark, the sheriff and his deputies joined the party led by three friends on a mission to find smugglers. They walked silently in a line until they reached the border. The boys were thrilled by the adventure. Following trail marks, they arrived at the spot where the smugglers crossed. The group lay down, waiting for the smugglers to approach. Garry suggested a plan to quickly react when the signal was given. As the men approached, a signal was given, and a bright light illuminated the area. The smugglers were caught, except for one who fled back across the border. The captured men were searched, and incriminating evidence was found.

"""I believe that in this instance, since the jewels were recovered post-theft, efforts will be made to contact the rightful owner. In the scenario of typical smuggled jewels, they would be confiscated by the United States. However, this is a slightly different circumstance. It falls upon the department in Washington, where I will promptly go to hand over this fortune to the appropriate individuals. I must admit, the sooner they are out of my possession, the better. They are exceedingly valuable, making me anxious that someone may try to take them. I am heading to Washington at daybreak, as soon as I can catch a train,"" concluded Fernald.

""Why, to be honest, I would appreciate a chance to stay here for a few days for some hunting and fishing. We didn't have much opportunity for that during our mission. Perhaps we could wire the Chief Ranger for a short break. Also, we need to inform the Customs Chief that our task is complete. I think the boys share my sentiments,"" said Garry.

"""I prefer solving mysteries over fishing any day,"" declared Dick. ""Fishing can wait, but a mystery is a rare treat."" The trio discussed a plan to watch over a location. They decided to take shifts at a nearby bunkhouse and set up a peephole for surveillance. They debated using a wireless system for communication but dismissed the idea due to its limitations. Instead, they opted to explore a trout brook for fishing. After a successful fishing trip, they returned to the bunkhouse, where they improvised a shutter system for covert monitoring. Garry's ingenuity impressed the group, and they prepared for their first watch shift the next morning.

Garry explained a clever escape plan using a string to hold the shutter in place. A peephole in a shutter gave them a view of the door. They planned to watch the shack and rescue a missing map piece. Phil suggested prying off the window shutter to cover all exits. They prepared a smoky distraction using wet and dry brush tied with wire.

Garry and his friend confronted a suspicious man who had a crucial piece of a map they needed. With rifles pointed at him, they found the missing map portion in the man's shirt pocket. They warned him to stay away or face consequences. The man, realizing the seriousness of the situation, left with a warning shot fired by Garry. The boys pieced the map together and discovered clues to a hidden mine near the Shohela river. They packed up, left a note for a friend, and set off on their journey.
