The father had a strong sense of duty towards his daughter, Evelyn. He believed that shaping her character and nurturing her mind and heart were more important than social obligations or business pursuits. His efforts were not just out of duty but also brought him immense joy. At thirteen, Evelyn was more of a companion to him than her mother had ever been. She took a keen interest in his work as an architect, sharing his aspirations for excellence.

"Yes, my dear boy, I understand you; you fear you may fall before temptation and so bring dishonor upon your profession. And doubtless so you will if you trust only in your own strength. But if, feeling that to be but weakness, you cling closely to Christ, seeking strength and wisdom from Him, He will enable you to stand. The apostle says, 'When I am weak, then am I strong,' and the promise is, 'God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.'

Elsie smiled kindly, approvingly upon the boy. It pleased her well to see how proud and fond he was of his father; how thoroughly he believed in him as the personification of all that was good and great and noble.

""I'm not nearly so brave,"" Max went on; ""but, as papa says, the promises are mine just as much as his, and neither of us can stand except in the strength that God gives to those that look to Him for help in every hour of temptation.""
