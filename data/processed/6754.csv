In a unique village beyond Blue Mountain, where all the houses were built in a pond with doors underwater, lived Brownie Beaver and his neighbors. Their ancestors settled there attracted by the abundance of trees with bark they liked to eat. The villagers believed that having their houses surrounded by water and the doors beneath the surface made them safer. Brownie Beaver, a skilled swimmer, built his own house with a winding hall to protect against enemies. The dam across the stream, built by Brownie's forefathers, required constant maintenance to prevent the pond from drying up.

Brownie Beaver had a unique way of storing his food. Some he carried into his house through a straight hall, while others he fastened underwater near the dam, like a refrigerator. Brownie preferred building his house near water, using his teeth to cut down trees. He would strip the bark, creating a white band around the trunk, then gnaw away wood until the tree leaned and fell. Brownie was careful to jump out of the way before the tree dropped, staying hidden to avoid attracting attention. Despite the wait, he eagerly devoured the tender bark from the treetop. Just like a hungry child waiting for dinner, Brownie relished his hard-earned meal.|"[""1.

Brownie Beaver chose a spot in the center of the pond to build his house, much like an island. He collected sticks from trees near the bank and swam them to the spot. While building, he peeled the bark off the sticks for food. Brownie carefully selected specific trees like poplar and willow for their bark. Some neighbors thought he was foolish for building a new house instead of digging a tunnel like Tired Tim. Tired Tim boasted about his tunnel but Brownie continued his work. Brownie valued his new home and the effort put into it, while Tired Tim preferred an easier option.

Brownie Beaver paused to observe a lazy fellow in the village who never worked. While most villagers were unconcerned, Grandaddy Beaver, an old and wise resident, quickly began fortifying his home, preparing for a possible flood. Despite initial ridicule, Grandaddy persisted, reinforcing his house as rain poured down. As the rain intensified, causing the water levels to rise rapidly, some villagers started to realize the seriousness of the situation. Eventually, a flood hit the village, threatening to wash away homes and the dam that protected them. Thanks to Grandaddy Beaver's foresight, his and Brownie Beaver's homes were safe, showcasing the importance of being prepared and taking heed of wise advice during unexpected events like a flood.|"[""1.

Brownie Beaver realized he couldn't do more to protect his house, so he swam to the dam, hoping to see his neighbors. To his surprise, only Grandaddy Beaver was there, looking concerned. Grandaddy Beaver explained that the dam's spillways needed to be larger to handle the water, but he couldn't do it alone. Brownie Beaver worked tirelessly that day and saved the dam from being destroyed. When the village learned of his bravery, they thanked him. Brownie didn't think much of the praise, as he preferred swimming to walking on land. Mr. Crow offered to bring him news each week, but Brownie joked he wanted a newspaper that predicted the future. Mr. Crow promised to visit every Saturday with updates, except in bad weather or emergencies.|['Question 1: Why did Brownie Beaver swim to the dam?\nA) To meet his neighbors\nB) To protect his house\nC) To play in the water\nD) To find food\nE) To explore the surroundings', 'Question 2: Who was at the dam when Brownie Beaver arrived?\nA) Mrs. Rabbit\nB) Grandaddy Beaver\nC) Mr. Crow\nD) Mr. Fox\nE) Mr. Squirrel', 'Question 3: What did Grandaddy Beaver explain to Brownie Beaver at the dam?\nA) The importance of swimming\nB) The need for a larger dam\nC) The best food sources in the area\nD) The latest gossip in the village\nE) The upcoming events in the community', 'Question 4: How did Brownie Beaver save the dam from being destroyed?\nA) By swimming faster\nB) By building a new dam\nC) By working tirelessly\nD) By asking for help\nE) By ignoring the problem', 'Question 5: How did Brownie Beaver feel about the praise he received from the village?\nA) Overjoyed\nB) Indifferent\nC) Angry\nD) Sad\nE) Annoyed', 'Question 6: What did Brownie Beaver joke about wanting from Mr. Crow?\nA) A new house\nB) A map of the village\nC) A newspaper that predicted the future\nD) A fishing rod\nE) A pair of binoculars']|['A) To meet his neighbors', 'B) Grandaddy Beaver', 'B) The need for a larger dam', 'C) By working tirelessly', 'B) Indifferent', 'C) A newspaper that predicted the future']
Brownie Beaver anxiously awaited each Saturday for Mr. Crow to bring him the week's news. He counted the days until Saturday, hoping to hear all the latest happenings.

Every bird flying overhead made him wish it was Mr. Crow, and every distant caw had him dropping everything, expecting his avian friend. Mr. Crow would share news from Pleasant Valley, like Mr. Rabbit's family visit, but he scolded Brownie for interrupting and withheld some details. Brownie felt a bit let down, thinking there was more to being a newspaper than Mr. Crow knew.

Brownie Beaver managed to convince Jasper Jay to be his newspaper, but he soon realized that Jasper's news was unreliable as Jasper often made up stories himself. During one of Brownie's outings, he found a sign nailed to a tree but couldn't read it. He asked Frisky Squirrel to fetch Uncle Jerry Chuck, known for reading signs aloud. Brownie suspected Uncle Jerry might ask for payment, so he left swiftly to spread the news about the sign. Uncle Jerry stopped him, but Brownie clarified he wanted Uncle Jerry to read it for himself. After Tommy Fox interpreted the sign, Brownie suggested paying Tommy. The village celebrated the news of no more hunting or fishing, planning swimming races and tree-felling contests.

Grandaddy Beaver had a wise look in his eyes as he munched on willow bark. He spoke about the upcoming cyclone, mentioning how his rheumatic pains had shifted sides just like before the last cyclone. Brownie Beaver, concerned about the safety of his new house, sought advice from his neighbors. Despite Grandaddy's warnings, the neighbors dismissed the cyclone threat. Brownie, however, remembered the past freshet and decided to take action. Grandaddy suggested building a house in the bank to withstand the cyclone, but Brownie preferred his stick and mud house. Grandaddy, confident in his old house's strength, advised Brownie to think carefully about securing his home. As they pondered a plan, Grandaddy's deep thoughts were interrupted by what sounded like a snore, but it was just his mind at work.|"['1.

Brownie expressed gratitude to Tired Tim for his advice before setting off to secure his house from an impending cyclone. However, upon reaching home, Brownie realized he lacked the necessary materials to tie down his house. Regretting the time spent waiting for advice, he pondered the loss of his home. Brownie decided to seek shelter in a dugout in the bank to ride out the storm. While wandering through the woods to distract himself from his worries, he stumbled upon a chain left behind by loggers. Excited by his find, Brownie returned home to secure his house, disregarding the stolen trees he had noticed earlier.

"""Hurrah!"" he exclaimed. ""The chain rescued my home!"" Then he realized all the other houses were unharmed too. ""How did this happen?"" he inquired of Tired Tim, his neighbor.

After Jasper Jay left Brownie Beaver, Brownie eagerly awaited the nightfall to return to the tree where he hoped to have his picture taken again. He believed he couldn't have too many pictures taken. Brownie also planned to rush into the thicket if the light flashed again to secure his image before anyone else could take it. Unfortunately, as Brownie gnawed at the tree, hoping for the camera flash, the tree began to lean dangerously. Mistaking the tree's snap for a camera click, Brownie stood still, expecting his picture to be taken. However, the tree fell on him, knocking him out briefly.

Grandaddy Beaver explained how they had searched everywhere except near the tree where Brownie had his recent adventure. Brownie knew it would be embarrassing for the family if others found out about the incident. Mr. Frog, watching from the lily-pads, suggested that Brownie's clothes could be improved. He offered to make him a new suit, claiming it would be the finest he had ever seen. Brownie, feeling dissatisfied with his current clothes, eagerly accepted the offer.
