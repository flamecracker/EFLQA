The group chuckled, except for Mr. Sneed and Wellington Bunn. Mr. Sneed approached a train worker about the chance of being snowed in, while Mr. Bunn, dressed in a fur coat and tall hat, gazed out the window, lost in thoughts of his Shakespearean acting days. The train chugged along slowly due to uphill terrain and recent storms, with more snow on the horizon in the rugged New England landscape. As the cold seeped in, Mr. Bunn mentioned the crisp air compared to New York. In a compartment with few passengers, Ruth noticed two young ladies, one under the weather. The group moved to a lounge where Ruth tended to the ailing girl, allowing her to rest. Upon nearing their stop, Ruth and Alice bid farewell to the girls, preparing to disembark at Hampton Junction, where horse-drawn sleighs awaited them.

Mr. Macksey suggested everyone get out to inspect the damage. As they tried to fix the broken runner, it became clear it was beyond repair. Alice suggested jumping the rear sleds over the broken one like a puzzle, but the idea was dismissed due to the worsening weather. Mr. Macksey proposed going ahead to get a spare sleigh from the Lodge. However, as the snowfall intensified and visibility decreased, they were unsure of the plan. The group found themselves stranded in the snow, unsure of what to do next.|"['1.

"As the man spoke, a sudden strong gust of wind and a flurry of snow swept in, taking everyone's breath away. The snow stung their faces, causing discomfort to both the people and the horses. ""Find shelter!"" shouted Mr. Macksey over the storm's roar. ""This blizzard is dangerous. Get into the sleds, cover up with blankets. I need to go for help!"" His warning and the fierce storm terrified the moving picture girls and the other players. They were not used to such extreme weather. In New York, tall buildings shielded them from strong winds, but here in the open fields, they had only the sleds for protection. The group struggled through the snow towards the sleds for shelter, while the restless horses also sought refuge. Mr. Macksey instructed his men to unhitch the horses and find shelter to prevent them from bolting.

Paul, a kind young man, offered his warm coat to Mr. DeVere, who was shivering from the cold. Gratefully, Alice thanked Paul with a look that showed her appreciation for his gesture. The group was stranded in a snowstorm with a damaged sled, but a clever idea emerged to use a bob from another sled to fix the broken one. With the sleds now ready and the baggage transferred, the horses were hitched, and the group prepared to continue their journey to Elk Lodge.

The former actress mentioned that the weather was harsh on her face and left to get some cold cream and rice powder. Despite the late hour, everyone enjoyed a hearty supper. Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon initially complained about the lack of courses and lobster but ended up eating heartily. Alice teased them about their multiple helpings of fried chicken. Later, Mr. Pertell discussed the upcoming ice filming plans. The storm made everyone tired, and they all agreed that bed was the best place to be. The next morning, the sun shone on the snow-covered landscape. Men were clearing the snow off the frozen lake for the filming.

"""Quick, get some rails from that fence!"" Mr. Pertell exclaimed urgently, pointing to a nearby fence. ""And then, get in the picture!"" As Russ continued filming the unexpected scene, the others sprang into action to rescue the actor who had fallen into the icy water. Ropes and trace chains were brought by some men who had been clearing snow. With the rails laid out on the ice near the air hole, they were able to pull Mr. Sneed out safely. After the rescue, Mr. Pertell suggested changing the film's plot to incorporate the real-life drama. The actor was swiftly brought back to Elk Lodge for warmth and a hot drink.

At Elk Lodge, Mr. DeVere found peace despite Dan Merley's demand for money. The snowy weather remained calm, and even Miss Pennington and Miss Dixon enjoyed the lodge. During a play scene, Paul heard Ruth scream as a deer appeared. Paul, hidden from the camera, refrained from interrupting the scene. Ruth improvised by mentioning sugar without moving her lips. The deer, after taking the sugar, left slowly through the snow. Russ captured the deer's graceful movements on camera. The scene ended with Ruth posing as if watching the deer leave.

"""Yes, and I don't like it, Jake,"" Mrs. Macksey replied. ""You know what it means if they kill any of the club deer. It may cost you your place here. The members of the club may say you were not careful enough.""

The company of players, with a number of men from Elk Lodge, added to fill the bobs, now divided themselves into two parties. Ruth was to go on the sled with Mr. Sneed, and sit directly behind him so as to show well in the camera. Alice was to ride next to Paul on the other sled. The bobs were long ones, with bells and large steering wheels in front.

With shouts and laughter, the merry coasters thus enlivened the race down the hill.

"The incident at the coast was resolved, the race filmed successfully, and the coasters were heading back up the hill. Russ was dismantling his camera, knowing there would be no more scenes for now. ""One of those hunters,"" he sighed, frustrated by their presence despite warnings. Mr. Pertell gathered the group in the lodge's living room, pointing to a pile in the corner. ""Time for something new,"" he announced. The Indian, Billy Jack, offered to teach them how to use snowshoes. Snowshoes are like tennis racquets, used to travel over deep snow without sinking. Billy Jack demonstrated how to fasten and walk in them, showing their usefulness. Despite initial struggles, the group eventually got the hang of it, with Mr. Sneed comically falling headfirst into a snowdrift.

Mr. Pertell noticed that the two girls were not up for hard work that day, so he declared an unexpected break. Russ, however, was busy capturing snow and ice scenes. As the day turned to dusk, Alice spotted Mr. Macksey approaching with a worried expression. He mentioned a possible storm, recalling a severe one from his youth. Taking precautions, he arranged for ample food for the animals. The atmosphere felt eerie, with an unusual hum in the air and a chill that hinted at ice particles. The sky darkened, forewarning a storm. Alice and Ruth visited the barn to witness the preparations. Even the animals seemed anxious.

The wind sighed loudly, scattering ashes and embers as it howled down the chimney. Alice hurried to the window, shielding her eyes from the blizzard. The snow fell so thickly that lamplights barely pierced the white wall outside. Throughout the night, Alice awoke to a world blanketed in snow, with drifts blocking doors and windows. The storm raged on, trapping everyone indoors. Despite the freezing temperatures, fires blazed to keep them warm. Mr. Macksey's foresight saved the animals from starvation. To clear a path, the men had to tunnel through the snow from a balcony, using snowshoes for support.

Mr. Macksey supervised the creation of paths and tunnels to reach the barns and care for the animals. To prevent the camera legs from sinking into the snow, they used boards as a base. The team adapted to the snow-covered surroundings by using snowshoes and creating paths. Despite the limited provisions due to the storm, Mr. Macksey managed to bring back enough supplies after a trip to town. As the snow began to settle, they prepared to film scenes for the play 'Snowbound' with caution. The resilience and teamwork of the group ensured they overcame the challenges brought by the severe weather.|"['1.

Mr. Pertell expressed his desire to capture scenes with unique snow formations for his film around the Lodge. He complimented Mr. Bunn's natural acting skills and suggested filming him and Miss Alice in a heroic snow battle. Unfortunately, the warm weather melted the snow quickly, hindering filming. Despite facing challenges due to the weather, Mr. Pertell couldn't send the film reels for development promptly. Meanwhile, the moving picture girls received letters, and Alice discovered her father's legal trouble. Mr. DeVere faced a lawsuit for unpaid money, lacking proof of payment to Merley.

Mr. DeVere decided to take matters into his own hands after receiving a response from Dan Merley's lawyers. Despite the confusion over a payment, Mr. Merley preferred to communicate through his legal team. Meanwhile, on the frozen lake, a race between Mr. Bunn and Mr. Sneed was being filmed. However, the scene took an unexpected turn when Mr. Sneed's cutter overturned, causing a pause in the filming. Despite the mishap, no one was injured, and the director decided to reshoot the scene for the movie without the accident.|"[""1.

"""Nonsense!"" the manager exclaimed. ""You're not hurt. You only think so. Here, Mrs. Maguire, give him that bottle of witch hazel I saw you use for little Tommy the other day. That will fix you up, Mr. Sneed."" The filming of the big drama was to take several days. Some scenes were set in distant parts of Elk Lodge's game preserve, and there wasn't time to shuttle the crew back and forth due to early sunsets in the dying year. Fair weather and storms alternated during filming. Russ captured fine shots, including weather effects and ice at the falls where two girls and their group had been trapped in an ice cave. Alice and Ruth, the two actresses, underestimated the storm's intensity. They sought refuge behind a rock to shield themselves from the swirling snow and biting winds, realizing the lodge was only a short distance away but seemed unreachable in the blizzard."|"['1.

"""I'm not sure, dear,"" hesitated the reply. ""But we need to return. Perhaps the snow will stop soon, and we can find our way back. All we need is to see the path. I'm certain I've been in worse storms than this."" Alice adjusted her scarf tightly around her neck to keep warm as the snowflakes fell on them. The girls were dressed warmly, which was a good thing. They huddled under a rock, unsure of what to do. They knew they couldn't stay there for long; night would come, and they needed shelter. But where could they go? 

""I understand, my dear, we're lost. We're off the path. If someone from the Lodge follows the right path, they won't find us. We're far from it, and they won't know where to look,"" explained one of the girls. 

Alice suggested, ""I don't think it will get that bad. Maybe the hunting dogs at Elk Lodge can track us. It might be strange to be followed by dogs, like fugitives!"" 

The snow stopped suddenly, giving them a clear view. They had veered off course and spotted two log cabins in a glade. They reached the cabins, breathless, and knocked on the door, but no one answered. 

""This is good,"" Alice remarked. ""These cabins are a specific location. If a search party comes out, they'll check here. I think we'll be okay"|['1.

The girls removed their snowshoes and used the boxes as kindling to start a fire in the cabin. Feeling the warmth, they discussed seeking help but decided against calling out to the men. They observed the men leaving and planned to approach the other cabin for assistance. Ruth recognized a man named Fripp from a previous encounter. Alice suggested seeking help from whoever might be at the other cabin discreetly. They agreed not to mention Mr. Merley's intentions. Ruth emphasized the importance of not being caught in the cabin by the returning men.

Alice confidently stated that she knew the direction of Elk Lodge and suggested they head back now that the storm had passed. The group retraced their steps towards the small cabin, making sure the fire they had lit was out to prevent any accidents. Russ and Paul found the girls and mentioned the Lodge was worried about them. They shared their adventure and mentioned trying to get a guide, but it wasn't necessary. As snow began to fall again, they joked about the possibility of filming the situation for a movie. The conversation shifted to a man named Dan Merley who was suing for damages from a streetcar accident, despite being able to walk fine. The group planned to gather evidence to expose him as a fraud.|['1.

Russ explained that there are dishonest people who plan fake accidents to get money. They choose who will pretend to be injured and where the accidents will happen. Witnesses are paid to lie, and they even hire deceitful lawyers. Sometimes they stage fake accidents involving their vehicles instead of themselves. Russ shared a plan to catch one of these swindlers, Dan Merley, by filming him secretly. Despite the challenges, Russ was determined to gather evidence. The company supported his idea and planned to give him time after finishing the current drama. Russ spent the next day preparing to film Merley, assessing the location and setting up his camera discreetly. Despite the cold weather, the crew continued filming important scenes, including some outdoors, which caused minor frostbite for Russ and Mr. Sneed.|"['1. **Question:** Why did Russ explain the existence of dishonest people staging fake accidents?\n- A) To teach the crew how to act in a drama\n- B) To warn the company about potential accidents\n- C) To plan a strategy to catch a swindler\n- D) To entertain the crew with a story\n- E) To practice filming fake accidents', '2. **Question:** What did Russ do to catch Dan Merley?\n- A) He hired deceitful lawyers\n- B) He paid witnesses to lie\n- C) He staged fake accidents with vehicles\n- D) He filmed Merley secretly\n- E) He pretended to be injured', ""3. **Question:** Why did Russ's plan involve filming Dan Merley secretly?\n- A) To capture important scenes for the drama\n- B) To practice his filming skills\n- C) To gather evidence against a swindler\n- D) To create a documentary about fake accidents\n- E) To entertain the crew during breaks"", ""4. **Question:** How did Russ's determination affect his plan to catch the swindler?\n- A) It made him abandon the idea\n- B) It caused him to hire more deceitful lawyers\n- C) It led him to assess the location discreetly\n- D) It made him pay witnesses to lie\n- E) It motivated him to film Merley secretly"", '5. **Question:** What happened to Russ and Mr. Sneed due to filming outdoors in cold weather?\n- A) They got minor frostbite\n- B) They captured important scenes\n- C) They hired deceitful lawyers\n- D) They planned fake accidents\n- E) They pretended to be injured']"|['** C) To plan a strategy to catch a swindler', '** D) He filmed Merley secretly', '** C) To gather evidence against a swindler', '** E) It motivated him to film Merley secretly', '** A) They got minor frostbite']
When the actor needed to rescue a person buried in snow for a film scene, a clever trick was used. A dummy was placed under the snow initially, and the real person, Mr. Bunn, acted until the burial. Then, a substitution was made, and the filming continued. This technique is common in creating special effects in movies. Mr. Sneed was shoveling snow when his ears suddenly felt numb. Later, Russ and Paul, with Ruth and Alice, used a special camera to film suspicious activities near cabins. They captured footage of Merley and Fripp behaving strangely, which revealed their hidden intentions. The group later showed the incriminating footage to others, exposing the deceitful actions of the individuals in question.|"['1.
