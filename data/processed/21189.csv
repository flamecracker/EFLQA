Long ago, a poet in his humble garret pondered amid cobwebs, finding inspiration in the mundane. As he weaved tales of murder-spinners and lawyers' lore, a bee trapped in the room caught his attention. Setting aside his pen, he freed the bee, forgetting the moral of his story. Reflecting on a tale from two centuries back, a squire, once wealthy, lost his appetite until a chance encounter with a peasant's simple meal of eggs and bacon reignited his taste buds. However, when he tried to replicate the dish, it fell flat. Seeking a solution, he followed a doctor's advice, embracing a simpler diet that brought him newfound joy.
