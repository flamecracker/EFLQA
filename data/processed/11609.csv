Dick and Tom discussed their current situation on the ship. Tom mentioned the positive aspects, such as having good officers and crew, as well as good food provided by the company. However, he also mentioned the lack of excitement on land, describing the dullness of the Mexican town they were in, filled with the stench of hides.

Boston Joe and Dick were studying a map to find a hidden mine. Joe pointed out that they could either go up the Gila valley or follow a valley to the west.

Dave and his companions faced a challenging decision on their journey. They debated whether to head north, east towards Albuquerque or Socorro, or cross the river. After days of traversing a barren landscape with limited water and food, they finally reached a stream. The sight of clear water brought immense relief to both men and animals.

With great joy, they finally spotted the mountain with three sharp peaks. However, it took them four days to reach a spot directly south of it. They found themselves in a broad valley running east to west. A rock wall stood to the south, while hills sloped northward with the Sisters' peaks visible. Leaving their animals behind with Boston Joe, they proceeded cautiously on foot. They noticed wigwams and horses in the distance, hinting at an Indian village. Following the map, they found a split in the rock wall, aligning perfectly with the middle peak and the village. Discovering gold in the sand, they decided to retreat quietly, returning later under the cover of darkness to avoid detection by the Indians.

Boston Joe and Dave ventured cautiously through the valley, wary of the dangers lurking around them. The remnants of Mexican skeletons strewn across the clearing served as a grim reminder of the perils that awaited them. The boys, undeterred, pressed on, determined to find a way out of the treacherous trap they found themselves in. As they ascended higher, their keen eyes spotted a narrow ledge hidden behind a bush. Recognizing it as a possible path, they decided to explore further. Scaling the ridge, they discovered a wider plateau that offered a view of the surrounding peaks. The worn path indicated it had been used for generations by animals, hinting at a possible escape route.

"""Wow, this path looks like it was made by hand,"" Dick exclaimed. ""Who would have known there was a way out of the valley like this? And it's great that even the horses can climb it. Finding this back door is a relief. Imagine being stuck there with the threat of being shot or starved.""

""We made it to the top with the ponies easily. It's narrow in spots, but we've seen worse. The cliffs never close in, so the horses can manage. And there's a way down into the valley, which is comforting. While you were away, we explored and found gold. The richest we've ever seen.""

""We'll need to fetch water from outside, but digging in the channel might help. The gold comes from a quartz vein in the cliff. We'll be rich from what's under our feet.

"""Yes, we have agreed I shall keep watch here tonight, Boston the next night, and then I continue. Zeke will take the watch below regularly; he sleeps soundly, and the slightest noise will awaken him, so he will do fine. Can you see the Indian village over there from here? Because if the sun were to reflect on the glass or brasswork, it would catch someone's eye in the village, and they would investigate. Still, if you can spot the village, we won't need to keep watch in the daytime below. That's where we expect an attack the most, and if you see them moving out, you can alert us. At night, of course, we must watch both places, for there may be a big village nearby, and the attack could come from any direction. Tom took the first watch in the morning. Dick helped the men cut down trees, chop them into boards, and collect gold from the trough they constructed. They found nuggets and gold dust, averaging eight to nine pounds of gold per clear-up. Dick wandered to where the Mexicans were massacred and found a charred stump. Dave suggested the gold might be buried there, so they fetched their picks to investigate. They uncovered bags of gold, totaling around four hundred pounds. Dick, less excited than the others, watched as they celebrated their discovery.

Boston Joe agreed to take charge of the horses, reducing their group to three. He anticipated that their enemies would retreat once they realized they were prepared.

He believed that the attackers wouldn't strike until daybreak, thinking they had the group cornered.

"No more talking was needed. The blankets were cut up, dry grass was placed under the horses' feet for padding, and the strips of blankets were tightly wound around. ""Let's move on, lads,"" Dave led, riding down the ravine. Two hours later, the blankets were discarded as they no longer hid their tracks and hindered the horses. After giving the horses water, they continued at a brisk pace. The valley narrowed, the trees disappeared, and the rock rose steeply. ""This is perfect,"" Dave remarked. Zeke was instructed to scout ahead with Dick to find a way out of the valley. They planned to mislead their pursuers by splitting up. Shots rang out, and the gorge extended further before widening.

Two shots rang out as the miners and Indians faced off. The lads fired confidently, taking down more of the Indians. The Colt at forty yards proved as deadly as a rifle. The miners reloaded quickly, accounting for more of their foes. Joe suggested they had dealt a sharp blow, with seven out of twenty-five Indians down. They decided to wait until dark to slip away unnoticed. Joe warned that if they left too soon, the Indians might follow.
