Nearby, a May-pole stood tall, adorned with colorful ribbons. Each person present took a ribbon and, guided by Miss Hart, they danced around the May-pole, weaving the ribbons in and out.

"""Yes,"" replied the man in a gruff tone. He appeared peculiar with his dark complexion, long coarse black hair, and shrewd black eyes lacking warmth.

Marjorie felt uneasy watching the trained wild animals perform at the circus. She decided to step out for some fresh air, sitting on a bench outside the tent. A friendly attendant checked on her. Shortly after, a young girl, likely a performer, joined her. They bonded over their shared discomfort with the wild animals. The girl introduced herself as Vivian and invited Marjorie to meet her sister inside the tent. Marjorie hesitated, not wanting to disobey the rules.

Marjorie, in excitement, asked Bill to inform her family in Box number five that she was going into the tent with a lady. Meanwhile, Pompton, their chauffeur, and the children waited outside. Worried, Pompton sought help from the doorman when Marjorie didn't return. King reassured Pompton and suggested they search the tents. Inside the circus tent, Mademoiselle Cora welcomed King and Kitty to sit as they searched for Marjorie.

"""Yes, I like it,"" replied Vivian, but a wistful look came into her blue eyes. Gently, almost timidly, she touched Marjorie's pretty coat and straw hat with her slender little fingers. ""I like it,--but I think I'd rather be a little home-girl like you.""

Marjorie felt drawn to Vivian, who longed for the privacy of a home life. She spoke gently, ""Yes, Vivian, we all go to school,--though I don't go to a regular school, do you?""

I know we can create a pleasant experience for you adults, but I'm mostly concerned about the kids. I told Ethel to focus on entertaining them while they're here.

The dinner was not only filling but also catered to the children's preferences. When the ice cream arrived, Kitty's delighted expression assured Cousin Ethel of the wise menu choice. Cousin Jack kept his promise and entertained the kids enthusiastically until nine o'clock. He set up a magic lantern display with amusing pictures, and his lively commentary kept the Maynards laughing heartily. Marjorie was startled by a sudden appearance of various flowers in the room. After a quick change into matching pink outfits, the girls dashed outside to join the playful game of Indians led by Cousin Jack. The Chief, named Opodeldoc, and his group played out a dramatic capture and rescue scenario with Marjorie and Kitty as characters.

Cousin Ethel suggested a plan for the upcoming festival. Marjorie was to handle the doll cart while Kitty would assist May Perry in selling flowers. They decided to create unique dolls to sell at the event. King, eager to help, crafted a charming doll from a clothespin and paper napkins.

On the day of the festival, the children, dressed as dolls, set out with their carts filled with dolls of all kinds. Marjorie and Bertha represented dolls as they walked around stiffly. Despite encountering a grumpy companion, Marjorie remained polite and composed.

Kitty and her friend May were dressed in charming flower girl outfits, complete with delicate Dolly Varden costumes. Their attire included flowered muslin overdresses and light blue satin skirts. They wore broad-brimmed hats adorned with roses and blue ribbons. Accompanied by a boy dressed like a page, they set out to sell their goods at a fair. Kitty, confident about the charity aspect, encouraged them to let buyers set the prices. The trio easily sold their dolls, with the town's residents eager to purchase. Despite some reluctance from Bertha, they received warm invitations to enter homes, but politely declined due to lack of familiarity. Elsie, who had sold out her post-cards, joined them and helped with the sales.
