If any Christian parent reads this, I want to ask if you have a son or daughter to dedicate to missionary work. It is crucial to instill in our children the duty of serving Christ through missionary work, prayer, and support. A generation raised with this mindset, supported by divine help, can bring about a moral transformation worldwide. Parents and teachers who guide children in this path are truly blessed. Even at my age, I still say a special prayer before bed. Have you learned it, dear children? I hope you do now and include it in your nightly prayers. In the Tamul language, I preach the Gospel, hoping some of you will share the message with non-believers. Unfortunately, many heathen children are not taught this prayer.

Dear children, speaking bad words is a serious matter. In the Bible, it tells the story of children who mocked a prophet and faced dire consequences. Little ones who use bad language may not go to heaven. God is displeased with such behavior. Remember, seeking forgiveness is crucial. Now, let's talk about the people of Ceylon. They have a variety of skin tones, ranging from bronze to dark shades. Some are beautifully adorned with gold, silver, and precious stones. Both men and women wear elaborate ear and nose ornaments. Women wear intricate necklaces, while men sport jeweled earpieces. Despite their beauty, these people enhance their appearance with ornate accessories.

The people who follow the god Siva wear an ornament called the _lingum_ on their arms, necks, or in their hair. It is considered abominable. Married women wear a unique ornament called the tahly, a piece of gold with an engraving of a god. It is fastened around the neck with a yellow string containing 108 threads. Ceremonies are performed before it is worn, seeking blessings from the gods. The tahly is tied by the bridegroom to the bride's neck and is only removed if the husband dies. Then, the widow is deprived of it in a ceremony by her female relative. The followers of Vrishnoo wear a different ornamentâ€”a vertical line on the forehead with white lines forming a trident. Some wear a circle called pottu on the forehead. The Brahmins draw a horizontal line on their foreheads after bathing.|"['1.

In India, the people wear simple clothing, like a single piece of cloth wrapped around the waist and a shawl over the shoulders. The native women often wrap themselves in long cloths, sometimes up to twenty yards long. The men now wear turbans borrowed from the Muslims. Hindu homes are typically made of earth and straw in rural areas, while in cities, they have tiled roofs. Kitchens are secluded, with the hearth placed in the southwest, the side of the god of fire. Family customs differ, with men eating before women. The wife serves the husband rice and curry, made with yellow roots, onions, mustard, pepper, and coconut milk squeezed from the pulp. Hindu husbands mix their food with their hands and do not use utensils like knives and forks. Their homes have barred kitchen doors to keep strangers from seeing their vessels, believed to be sacred.|['1.

In Ceylon, a husband and wife have unique customs after a meal. The wife brings water for the husband to wash his hands, followed by vettalay, paakku, shell-lime, and tobacco as his dessert. Vettalay is a spicy leaf, while paakku, a nut, is cut into small pieces. The husband sometimes enjoys a segar, but the writer hopes children won't pick up smoking habits. Interestingly, in Ceylon, females also smoke. After smoking, the husband may pass the segar to his wife. Once, a schoolmaster's wife refused the segar after he became a Christian. The people sit on mats with legs doubled under, resembling tailors sewing. They use plantain leaves as plates and work sitting on the ground, showing unique skills like a carpenter using his feet to hold a board while working.|"[""1.

"In some cultures, salutations vary. Some raise their right hand to their heart, while others simply stretch it out towards a passing person. The word ""salam"" is borrowed from the Mohammedans, used to greet both Mohammedans and Europeans. When addressing high-ranking individuals, they give their ""salam"" thrice, touching the ground with both hands and then lifting them to their foreheads. Brahmins are saluted by joining hands and elevating them to the forehead or over the head, accompanied by ""andamayya,"" meaning Hail, respected lord. The Brahmins respond with ""aaseervaathum,"" a benediction. The most respectful form of salutation is ""shaashtaangkum,"" or prostration, where the feet, knees, stomach, head, and arms touch the ground, practiced before priests and in assemblies to ask for forgiveness."|"['1.

When Hindoos, who have been separated for a long time, reunite, they express joy by gently touching each other's chins and shedding tears of happiness. Grown individuals rarely kiss each other. Sometimes, mothers or others will touch their noses to a child's cheek and inhale, similar to smelling something pleasant. Women show respect by turning their backs or faces away when in the presence of esteemed individuals. They must not sit in front of men, not even their husbands. When encountering someone of high rank, one must step aside or dismount and stand until they pass, removing their slippers as a sign of respect. Addressing a person of note requires maintaining a certain distance, covering the mouth while speaking, and presenting gifts when visiting for the first time, often including sugar, plantains, and milk. Marriage is a significant event for Hindoos, with ceremonies lasting five days and involving rituals to ward off evil looks.|"[""1.

Before any action begins, an image of Pullian is reverently placed under the puntel. This deity is highly esteemed due to the deep fear he evokes. Despite his unattractive appearance deterring potential partners, he is revered with utmost respect to prevent any harm. Following various rituals and the tying of saffron bands on the young couple's wrists, a significant ceremony unfolds. The future father-in-law perceives the young man as the great Vrishnoo, offering a sacrifice and washing his feet in a series of rituals with water, milk, and prayers. Subsequent ceremonies involve the father-in-law symbolically handing over his daughter with gifts of cows, land, and a sacred _salagrama_. The tahly, adorned with flowers, is then fastened around the bride's neck, signifying her acceptance. The groom performs a fire sacrifice, and they circumambulate the fire together. Another ritual involves the couple stepping into bamboo baskets and showering each other with rice. On the third evening, an astrologer directs them to worship a star, symbolizing the wife of Vasestha. The newlyweds dine together, sharing a plate as a symbol of unity, a unique occurrence during the ceremonies. Following the completion of all rites, a grand torchlight procession through the village is held, showcasing the richly adorned couple in a palanquin, a dazzling sight for all.|"['1.

The wedding procession moves slowly through the streets. Friends and family come out of their homes to greet the newlyweds. Women perform the _arati_ ceremony, while men offer gifts of silver, fruits, sugar, and betel. I once saw a similar procession in Madras at night, and it was truly magnificent. Countless lamps illuminated the way, casting a beautiful glow on the shrubbery carried on carts. Little girls in elegant attire, adorned with flowers, added to the spectacle. Elephants decked in gold and silver trappings joined the procession, along with fireworks to enhance the brilliance of the scene.

The leader of the funeral procession leads, carrying a vessel of fire. The body is followed by family and friends, bareheaded in mourning. Women stay home, wailing as the body leaves. Three stops are made to feed the deceased unboiled rice, believed to be vital to prevent mistakes. At the burning site, a trench is dug, blessed, and sprinkled with water and gold coins. The body is placed on a wood pile, sprinkled with punchakaryam, circled with water, and the torch is handed to the leader after a display of grief. The pile is set ablaze, and only Brahmins stay until it burns. Sudra funerals include loud music and cannon-like sounds. These ceremonies aim to absolve sins, a belief unknown to Christians. The hope is that Christians will spread the Gospel to save them from eternal punishment.|"['1.

"Dear Students,

The term ""heathen"" refers to those who worship idols or are unaware of the true God. This is the case with a specific group of people who believe in a supreme being called Brahm but do not worship him. Instead, they worship various gods of different colors, shapes, and sizes. These gods ride on different animals and possess weapons like thunderbolts, javelins, and shields. They engage in immoral activities like lying, stealing, and committing crimes. Among them, there are three main gods known as the Hindoo triad: Brumha, Vrishnoo, and Siva. Brumha, the creator, is not worshipped in temples due to a falsehood he told. Vrishnoo was known for stealing butter and was tied to a rice mortar as punishment. Siva, the destroyer, once cheated in a card game and was cursed to become a snake.

These stories highlight the complexities and flaws attributed to these gods in Hindu mythology."|"['1.

Dear students, I share these stories of gods with you to help you appreciate being born in a Christian society with the Bible. Without it, we might worship gods like the Hindoos. Our ancestors worshipped idols too, like Thor and Woden, even offering human sacrifices. The Hindu gods were created from Brahm's essence, along with the atoms forming our world. Brahm organized these atoms in a great egg for four billion years before creating the universe. Our earth is the first of seven circular islands, each surrounded by different seas. Above us are heavenly mansions where gods dwell. Criminals face a hundred thousand hells in the lower worlds, while souls transmigrate based on past actions. Remember, the Bible guides us to love and follow our Saviour, Jesus Christ.|"[""1.

The people of India are divided into castes, as they believe that after Brumha created the heavens and the earth, he made the human race with four classes or castes. The Brahmins, the highest caste, were created from his mouth and are priests who teach from the sacred _Vedas_. The military caste, meant to protect the country, came from his arm. The third caste, farmers and merchants, came from his chest, and the Sudras, the lowest caste, were created from his feet. The Sudras include carpenters, weavers, and farmers. The Hindoos believe in hells where sinners are punished before being reborn. They think suffering can atone for sins, but Christians believe only Jesus' sacrifice can forgive sins. It is crucial to seek forgiveness through Christ to avoid eternal punishment.|['1.

Caste in India is a system that divides people into different groups based on their birth. It is considered a sacred institution and is not something that can be changed. Each caste has its own set of rules, and breaking these rules can lead to disgrace and even being outcast from society. The highest caste, the Brahmins, are taught to look down on all other castes. They go to great lengths to maintain their purity and avoid contact with lower castes. The idea of purity is so strict that even a glance from someone of a lower caste can be considered defiling. The Brahmins have specific rules about what they can touch, eat from, and how they eat. They believe that saliva is unclean and have strict practices to avoid contamination. This system of castes creates divisions and prejudices among people, hindering the spread of Christianity in India.|"['1.

The Brahmins have strict dietary and cleanliness beliefs. They avoid all animal products, including eggs, as they believe it defiles them. They consider killing cows or oxen a grave sin and eating their flesh an irreversible defilement. Dogs are seen as defiling, yet they are also worshipped. Brahmins must cleanse themselves in water if touched by a dog. They feel unclean after funerals and news of a relative's death, requiring immediate purification. They must avoid touching bones or certain objects and sit on purified surfaces. Cow dung is used for purification. Intoxicating drinks are also considered defiling. To rejoin their caste, one must seek forgiveness, undergo punishment, and promise to uphold their caste's standards.|"['1.

In some cultures, when someone is expelled from their social group for a serious wrongdoing, they must undergo a purification ritual to be reinstated. This process can involve burning the person's tongue with a hot piece of gold and marking their body with red-hot iron stamps. They may also be forced to walk on burning embers and drink a mixture of cow-derived substances as part of the ceremony. After completing these tasks and hosting a feast, the individual is welcomed back into the community. However, there are certain actions, like consuming cow flesh, that are considered unforgivable and prevent reintegration. It's important to remember that pride and social hierarchy exist in many societies, but humility and kindness are valued virtues that transcend such divisions. In Christian teachings, humility and respect for others are emphasized as essential qualities for spiritual growth and forgiveness.|"['1.

In the book of Genesis, chapter 28, verse 18, it is mentioned that Jacob, upon waking from a dream, anointed a stone with oil and set it up as a pillar. This act of anointing with oil is also observed in the worship of idols by the heathen. Before idols can be worshipped, Brahmins recite prayers to invite the god to reside in the image, anointing it with oil and butter. Idols in grand temples are adorned with rich garments and jewels, receiving offerings of rice, flowers, fruits, and lamps. Priests conduct daily ceremonies, washing the idol and offering flowers and sandalwood. The temple priests are followed by a procession with holy water every morning. Dancing girls and musicians also play a crucial role in temple rituals, with musicians using wind instruments and drums while singing hymns.|"[""1.

The temples' expenses are covered by the voluntary offerings of the people, including money, jewels, and provisions. The Brahmins employ various tactics to encourage these contributions. They may chain their idols, claiming they owe a debt to creditors who demand payment before releasing them. Another ploy involves pretending the gods are ill due to lack of worship, with the Brahmins offering ineffective treatments. Additionally, they stage possessed individuals who receive gifts to appease the gods' anger. Each year, a grand procession features the idol on a massive chariot adorned with jewels and flowers, dragged by hundreds of people amid loud cheers and music.|"['1.

In some instances, during the ritual procession, individuals hurl themselves under the wheels of cars and meet a tragic end. This grim occurrence is linked to the procession of Juggernaut's car, as detailed in my Sermon to Children about the Heathen. The image of Juggernaut and his car, with two men crushed beneath the wheels, is depicted. Recently, five people suffered the same fate. Numerous dreadful mishaps also transpire during these processions. A while back, multiple individuals in this city had to undergo amputations due to injuries sustained. During my time in America, I exhibited an idol named Pulliar to many children. It was once worshipped by Raamu, a native helper when he followed the heathen faith. The idol's worship practices were explained in detail. A picture of Pulliar is included to offer insight. This idol is part human-like and part beastly. While you, dear children, wouldn't place trust in such idols, these people do, as illustrated by the following account. A woman afflicted with breast cancer was brought to me, her condition severe. The day after her arrival, I performed the necessary procedure. Before she was brought to me, her brother sought guidance from the goddess Meenaache at the temple regarding whether to bring her to me or a native doctor. He devised a method to determine the goddess's will. Bundles of red and white flowers were prepared, with red symbolizing the Tamil man and white the white man|"[""1.

During various festivals in India, people show reverence to their tools and instruments. Masons, carpenters, barbers, and women all honor their tools by offering sacrifices and adoration. Tools are seen as divine entities that help individuals earn a livelihood. In some celebrations, an idol representing Parvathe is crafted and paraded through the streets. Another festival involves offering food to deceased relatives and lighting lamps to honor them. In December, the feast of Pongul marks a time of joy as an unlucky month ends. Women clean and draw white lines before their homes, symbolizing purification. The festival includes worshipping the sun and boiling rice with milk, symbolizing prosperity and sharing with others. This festive period is a time of community and celebration.|['1.

"The third day of the festival is known as the ""Pongul of cows."" A large vessel filled with water and saffron is prepared. The mixture is then sprinkled over the cows and oxen that belong to the household. Afterwards, the men bow down before the animals four times. The cows are adorned by painting their horns with various colors, placing garlands of flowers around their necks and backs, and adding strings of coconuts and fruits. Children and others eagerly collect the fallen fruits as they are considered sacred. The cows are then paraded through the streets and left to graze freely without supervision during the day. This practice may seem strange, but it is essential to understand the diverse beliefs and worship practices of different cultures, such as those of the Hindoos."|['1.

"Many of the locals refer to the Cobra Capella nulla paampu as the ""good snake"" and fear calling it a ""bad snake"" to avoid harm.

Have you supported sending it to them? Have you considered going to share the Gospel with them? In Hindostan, the river Ganges is worshipped as the goddess Gunga. People believe dying near or in the river makes them holy. The river is considered purifying. People are taken to die by the river, even if unwilling. Some are beaten if they revive on the funeral pyre. This practice is inhumane and cruel. Worshippers believe they can purchase heaven by these acts.

Sometimes, in sudden and severe illnesses, people cannot reach the river before passing away. In these cases, a bone is kept and later thrown into the river to aid the departed. Occasionally, strangers are abandoned on the riverbanks to perish without the ritual of drinking Ganges water. These individuals have been witnessed suffering from injuries inflicted by animals or insects. If someone taken to the river for healing recovers, it is viewed as a calamity by their loved ones. They are shunned and considered outcasts. Near Calcutta, there are villages where such outcasts reside. Sauger Island, at the mouth of the Hoogly River, was notorious for mothers sacrificing their children to crocodiles. Thankfully, the British ended this practice, but similar sacrifices persist elsewhere. The spread of the Gospel can prevent such tragedies, as seen in the story of a missionary who convinced a mother to stop sacrificing her children after sharing the message of Jesus Christ with her.|"[""1.

After the image is blessed, the worship begins. The devotee approaches the image, prostrates before it, and performs various rituals. Sometimes sitting, standing, or looking in different directions. The devotee sprinkles holy water, cleanses the idol, adorns it with flowers and jewels, offers perfumes, and concludes with a final act of respect. The worship is followed by celebrations with grand offerings. Rich devotees have been known to offer vast quantities of sweets, sugar, clothing, and fruits. Sacrifices of animals are also made, with a king once offering thousands of animals. The festival lasts three days, ending with a farewell ceremony where the images are immersed in the river. This differs greatly from the worship of the Bible, emphasizing that true worship is spiritual. Worshipping idols is seen as offensive to God, and those who prioritize material things over spiritual matters are considered idolaters.|['1.

The Phansiagars have a gruesome tradition of gashing and burying the bodies of those they murder. They believe the goddess used to eat the corpses, protecting them from being discovered. However, after a Phansiagar saw the goddess feasting on a victim's body, she was angered and vowed never to devour their victims again. Instead, she gave them tools: a fang for a pickaxe, a rib for an unbluntable knife, and a piece of her garment for a noose. The Phansiagars teach their children this trade, gradually exposing them to the horrors until they are skilled murderers. Women are also involved, using their beauty to lure victims. In one instance, a Coorg horseman narrowly escaped being strangled by a girl who pretended to be in distress.

Can people who perform such extreme acts go to heaven? Would they even enjoy the pure happiness there? My dear students, it's unrealistic to think that those who follow such practices can enter heaven. Despite my efforts to share the Gospel with many, I have never seen a heathen with qualities fit for such a sacred place. Their actions align with the sins described by the apostle Paul in Romans, making it impossible for them to enter heaven. Some heathens perform rituals like rolling on the ground after a god's chariot or swinging on hooks through their flesh to please their deities. These acts are so extreme that they cause harm and are seen as sinful by their own communities. It's crucial to understand the differences between such practices and the values upheld in a place like heaven.|"['1.

Hooks for swinging and iron rods for piercing sides were paraded through the streets. The man reappeared with hooks in his back and was lifted onto the beam. Ropes fastened him to the beam, which was raised high. The people drew him up, and he was swung around. The journey through the streets lasted over an hour.

While observing the extreme rituals in a distant land, the image of the young men of America refusing to help those in need crossed my mind. Witnessing the horrors inflicted on a poor soul, suspended by hooks through his flesh, I imagined the impact it would have on the children I recently spoke to. These acts of cruelty, such as devotees throwing themselves onto spikes or making vows to endure pain until seeds sprout from their lips, highlight the extreme measures taken by some to demonstrate devotion. From Yogis rolling across vast distances to devotees enduring physical torment, the lengths to which some go to display their faith are astonishing.

"Dear students, 

In some parts of the world, there are people who follow a religion that leads them to do extreme and harmful things in the name of faith. Some throw themselves off cliffs, some bury themselves alive, and others harm themselves in various ways. These actions have no value or merit. In contrast, Christianity teaches us simple but important principles: repentance, turning away from sin, having faith in Christ, and dedicating ourselves to serving Him. It's crucial to follow these teachings rather than engaging in harmful practices. The passage also touches on the cruel customs of some societies, like the burning of widows in India, which the British have worked to abolish. It's important to understand the value of kindness, compassion, and following a path of righteousness. Let us strive to do good and be kind to others, following the teachings of love and compassion."|['1.

During a solemn procession, a widow followed her deceased husband in a palanquin, receiving admiration from the crowd. She blessed and comforted those who approached her, distributing betel leaves as tokens of goodwill. Despite her serene demeanor, upon reaching the funeral pyre, fear overcame her. Her relatives tried to console her, but she appeared distant and unresponsive. After a ceremonial washing, she was led to the pyre surrounded by Brahmins and armed relatives. Stripped of her jewels, she circled the pyre thrice, then fainted as she was placed on her husband's body. The crowd cheered as the flames engulfed them both. The Brahmins selected two more widows for the same fate, who accepted their destiny with apparent joy to avoid dishonor.|['1.

"Once, preparations for the funeral took just a day. The ceremony unfolded as follows: A square pit was dug in a field near the palace, not too deep but about twelve to fifteen feet wide. In it, a pyramid of sandalwood was built. At the pyramid's center, a scaffold was erected to collapse easily when its supports were removed. Around the scaffold, large jars of melted butter were placed to anoint the pyramid for easier ignition.

The procession began with soldiers, followed by trumpeters filling the air with mournful melodies. The king's body, richly adorned on a palanquin, was escorted by close relatives and the king's priest, all on foot and without turbans in mourning. The two queens, also on palanquins, appeared calm and cheerful, surrounded by Brahmins and a vast crowd. The queens were laid beside the king's body, hands joined over him. After prayers and holy water, the pillars were removed, causing the scaffold to fall over the queens, who were then consumed by the flames.

In ancient India, a Brahmin's wife faced a dreadful fate after her husband's death. Tied to his funeral pyre, she managed to escape the flames only to be forced back by her own son. He believed sparing her would risk losing their caste. Despite her pleas, she was tied up and placed back on the fire, meeting a tragic end. This cruel practice, known as suttee, was deeply ingrained in the culture. Some native rulers tried to abolish it, showing the tradition's strong hold. The British outlawed suttee, but its roots run deep. Only through spreading the Gospel can such harmful customs be eradicated. The Vedas, sacred Hindu texts, even contain rituals for seeking harm on enemies through priests and sacrificial fires.|"[""1.

The teachings of Jesus emphasize love and kindness towards enemies, as opposed to harming them. A story from Dr. Duff's school in Calcutta illustrates this contrast. A young Hindu, moved by the compassionate teachings of Jesus, abandoned his sacred books and idols to follow the Savior. The man, a former temple priest, used deceit to recover stolen jewels by tricking villagers into believing a coconut would identify the thief. After his conversion, he revealed the trick, showing the deception of his past ways.

"Dear Students,

In a sermon for children, I discussed the superstitious beliefs prevalent in India. For instance, some believe that any good deed done on a Sunday will fail. People avoid eating until they see a specific bird associated with the god Vrishnoo. Rubbing oil on the head on a Monday after bathing is considered a grave sin. Cutting hair on a Tuesday is believed to bring poverty. Worshipping gods on a Wednesday is frowned upon. Taking medicine on a Thursday is thought to worsen sickness. Lending anything on a Friday might result in loss of property. Buying new clothes on a Saturday and keeping them at home is believed to bring death. These superstitions also extend to events like house foundations laid in June, marriages in September, and new house entries in March, believed to bring misfortune. Such beliefs also associate occurrences like a thunderbolt hitting a house or a crow striking a person with impending doom. Superstitions also extend to physical traits like head size, birth under specific planets, and even dreams predicting one's death. These beliefs are not based on facts and should not be taken seriously.

Remember, superstitions have no scientific basis and should not influence our actions or decisions. It's essential to rely on logic and evidence-based knowledge rather than superstitions.

Stay curious, question beliefs, and seek the truth!

The people of Burmah, a country east of Hindostan, are deep in idol worship, particularly devoted to Gaudama, also known as Boodh. Born six hundred years before Christ, according to their history, Boodh is revered as a god who attained his status through acts of religious merit. The Burmese are idolaters, offering flowers, incense, and more to his image in numerous temples. Unfortunately, like other idolatrous societies, the Burmese exhibit wicked behavior, especially towards women, whom they mistreat and sometimes sell. Despite their religious practices, they lack divine knowledge and deny the existence of a creator or preserver of the world, making them essentially atheists. The Baptist General Convention for Foreign Missions runs a successful mission in Burmah, aiming to bring spiritual enlightenment to these distant lands. It is vital for Christians to share the Bible with such communities to alleviate their spiritual miseries and prevent their eternal loss.|['1.

In Burmah, a unique tradition involves honoring a white elephant, treating it like royalty with lavish attire, food, and officers. This elephant holds a prestigious status, ranking just below the king and above the queen. During past conflicts with England, missionaries like Drs. Judson and Price, and Messrs. Hough and Wade, faced severe hardships. Messrs. Hough and Wade were imprisoned and faced imminent danger as guards prepared to execute them during a naval attack on Rangoon. However, divine protection intervened, and they were eventually freed to continue spreading the Gospel. Despite the missionaries' challenging experiences, their dedication bore fruit, with over six thousand people embracing Christianity, especially among the Karens. Adjacent to Burmah lies China, a land with over three hundred million inhabitants, where idol-making sustains many livelihoods.|"['1.

In a country far away, women face many challenges. They are considered inferior to men and endure great suffering. For instance, in China, girls have their feet bound tightly with cloth from a young age, causing immense pain and preventing their feet from growing. This practice makes it difficult for them to walk, and they often limp and hobble. Shockingly, some parents even sell their daughters into marriage without their consent. In some cases, baby girls are abandoned or killed. However, there are kind-hearted individuals who seek to help these girls, like Mr. Doty, a missionary who rescued two young girls from being sold. Education is crucial in empowering these girls and giving them a brighter future.|['1.

Dear students, have you ever wondered why your parents love and educate you? They want to make you happy and not mistreat you because they have the Bible. It is crucial to save money to buy Bibles for those in need. Infanticide, the killing of infants, used to be common in heathen lands like Tahiti. Missionaries found that many children were murdered at birth. The missionaries helped change this cruel practice. Even Christian women had committed this crime, but with guidance and forgiveness, they found peace. Remember, the Bible teaches us to show love and compassion to all, and through faith in Jesus Christ, we can find forgiveness and peace. Let us be grateful for the love and guidance we receive and strive to spread kindness and understanding to all.|['1.

At a special meeting, children unanimously decided to attend monthly prayer concerts and bring friends. They also planned to make their school a life member of the Bible Society. Some kids brought Bibles to give to the less fortunate, but realizing the need for funds, they decided to raise money to buy Bibles for others. One child shared how they earned money by skipping treats to support missions. Another made matches to raise funds and offered to work in the garden for donations. A child decided to give up buying candy to support missionaries. By saving money spent on sweets, they could purchase Bibles and tracts for those in need. The story of a boy in Ceylon illustrated the impact of a cheap tract that led him to faith. He bravely chose Christ over idols, showing remarkable faith even in his final moments.|['1.

"When I was in America, I used to ask children if they would become missionaries. One girl in Avon Springs not only wrote it down but gave it to me. She wrote, ""Dr. Scudder asks me if I will become a missionary."" Boys, if you come to India, Burmah, or China to spread the word, you can do as much good as Swartz and Carey. Girls, you can do the same. Let me tell you about a girl in Ceylon. She joined the church at thirteen and wanted to talk to her heathen mother about Jesus. The mother got angry but the girl kept talking. The mother eventually listened, became a Christian, and others followed.

In 1833, while I was in Ceylon, two religious revivals occurred. Before these revivals, there was little seriousness at our stations. In October of that year, we felt the need to pray and work more for the conversion of souls. A meeting was planned at the seminary in Batticotta. Mr. Spaulding and I assisted Mr. Poor for five days. The students at the seminary began praying earnestly, seeking mercy for their peers. Similar meetings were then held at the female seminary in Oodooville. The Holy Spirit worked powerfully, leading to deep introspection and confession among the students. One girl admitted her pride and false dedication to the Savior, seeking genuine salvation. Another girl, overwhelmed with guilt, sought guidance and found peace by dedicating herself wholeheartedly to the Savior.|['1.
