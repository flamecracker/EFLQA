Four years ago, my uncle, Rev. Dr. Smith, asked me to give a speech in my hometown, the capital of the Upper Ward. I had never spoken publicly before, but my uncle insisted. I decided to share Ailie's story, a tale close to my heart. Despite my nerves, I told the story with passion. Rab, a character in the story, became a favorite among the audience. The townspeople were amazed at the impact of the story when it was shared in print. Some felt the story was too painful, but my father believed it was essential for the audience to experience such emotions. Art, he said, should evoke both pleasure and empathy. As we watched a crowd gathering for a dog-fight, my friend Bob and I rushed to witness the intense energy and skill on display, a natural fascination shared by all.|"[""Question 1: What was the main reason the narrator decided to give a speech in their hometown?\nA) Their father insisted\nB) To share a story close to their heart\nC) To showcase their public speaking skills\nD) To impress their uncle\nE) To criticize the town's traditions"", ""Question 2: Who was the character that became a favorite among the audience during the narrator's speech?\nA) Ailie\nB) The narrator\nC) Rev.

Bob's ability to quickly assess a dog-fight was impressive. Although he couldn't see the fight, his brain deduced it from the crowd's behavior. The scene was chaotic, with mostly men and a few active women surrounding the dogs. A white terrier was overpowering a larger shepherd dog. Despite the shepherd's courage, the terrier's breeding and skill prevailed. The shepherd's attempts to end the fight were futile until a bystander suggested snuff. The terrier sneezed, releasing the shepherd. However, the terrier, unsatisfied, attacked another dog. The mastiff, muzzled due to a city ordinance, stood stoically as the terrier attacked.

We quickly gathered a crowd as the Chicken fought back. Bob urgently called for a knife, and a shoemaker handed him a sharp one. I pressed the blade against the taut leather, and with one swift motion, the fierce little creature lay lifeless. A somber silence fell upon us; it was more than we had expected. Examining the fallen fellow, I realized the mastiff had swiftly ended his life. The dog, now remorseful, sniffed around before trotting away. Bob decided we would bury the Chicken later. I followed the mastiff as he briskly made his way through the streets, eventually stopping at the Harrow Inn. An impatient man there, the carrier, seemed upset until he recognized the dog and comforted him. The man, Jess, and Rab set off together, leaving me to reflect on the bond between man and dog.|"['1.

"I never saw a more unforgettable face, -- pale, serious, lonely, delicate, sweet, without being at all what we call fine. She looked sixty and had on a mutch, white as snow, with its black ribbon; her silvery, smooth hair setting off her dark-gray eyes -- eyes such as one sees only twice or thrice in a lifetime, full of suffering, full also of the overcoming of it; her eyebrows black and delicate, and her mouth firm, patient, and contented, which few mouths ever are. As I have said, I never saw a more beautiful countenance, or one more subdued to settled quiet. ""Ailie,"" said James, ""this is Maister John, the young doctor; Rab's friend, you know. We often speak about you, doctor."" She smiled and made a movement but said nothing and prepared to come down, putting her plaid aside and rising. Had Solomon, in all his glory, been handing down the Queen of Sheba at his palace gate, he could not have done it more daintily, more tenderly, more like a gentleman, than did James the Howgate carrier when he lifted down Ailie, his wife. The contrast of his small, swarthy, weather-beaten, keen, worldly face to hers -- pale, subdued, and beautiful -- was something wonderful. Rab looked on concerned and puzzled, but ready for anything that might turn up -- were it to strangle"|"[""1.

Rab was a mighty dog, akin to great leaders like Caesar and Wellington. His solemn demeanor reminded his observer of the Baptist preacher Fuller. Similarly, Ailie, facing a life-threatening condition, displayed remarkable courage. Despite the impending operation, she and James shared a silent understanding. The next day, the students were informed of the surgery. Ailie's entrance silenced the room, her presence commanding respect. As the operation commenced without anesthesia, Ailie bore the pain stoically. Rab, sensing his mistress's distress, grew restless, but James kept him in check.

After Ailie underwent surgery, she behaved with grace, apologizing for any perceived misbehavior. The students, deeply moved, wept openly. Ailie, supported by James and the narrator, retired to her room. James, determined to care for Ailie himself, removed his shoes and vowed to be her dedicated nurse. Despite his rough exterior, James proved to be tender and attentive to Ailie's needs. Rab, the loyal dog, remained stoic and well-behaved, even in his sleep showing signs of protecting his beloved Ailie.

The end was near. The body and soul, together for sixty years, were parting. Walking alone through the valley of shadows, she was comforted. As she lay still, her eyes shut, she held a bundle close to her chest, like a mother with her child. It wasn't a child but a memory of her wee Mysie, gone for forty years. She whispered names, looked into the eyes of loved ones, then peacefully passed away, leaving behind a clear darkness. Her faithful dog, Rab, watched over her, licking away tears. Her husband, James, overcome with grief, clumsily put on his shoes, breaking a latchet, a rare sight. Rab, loyal till the end, stayed by her side. James, in a rush of emotion, left abruptly, leaving a trail of echoes behind.|"['1.

"I was scared for him, yet not really scared. So, I sat next to Rab and, being tired, fell asleep. I woke to a sudden noise outside. It was November, and there was a heavy snowfall. Rab stayed still; he heard the noise but didn't move. I peeked out and saw Jess and the cart at the gate in the dim morning light. James, who had left just three hours ago, was already there, carrying blankets and sweating. He nodded at me and laid out two pairs of old blankets with ""A. G., 1794"" in red letters. These were Alison Graeme's initials. James wrapped his wife carefully in the blankets, leaving her face uncovered, and carried her away. Rab followed. I watched them disappear into the distance. James later buried his wife, and then fell ill and passed away. Rab met a sad end too, being put down by the new carrier."|"['1.
