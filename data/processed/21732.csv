The new fort, yet unnamed, awaited its first master. Murray instructed Jack to fetch the sloop from a creek twenty miles away. Jack, with three men, faced the challenge. The sloop, stranded during a high tide, seemed impossible to move. Undeterred, Jack and his team cleared debris and rigged a block tackle. Despite straining efforts, the sloop remained unmoved. Jack's determination led to a new plan with pine trees as leverage. At last, the sloop budged slightly, a glimmer of progress.

"The final high tide had arrived, and the crew worked frantically. Using wedges, they tilted the vessel towards the water. With the tide full, they pulled and hammered, inching the sloop into the deep water. The success sparked enthusiastic cheers, reminiscent of grand ship launches.

Jack Robinson returned to the fort with a blank expression and sat in the hall. He noticed the chairs were unstable, made of fir-wood. Jack found charcoal in the fireplace and absentmindedly sketched on the wall. Teddy O'Donel shared details about Fort Desolation, mentioning the Indians' good relationship with traders and issues at the salmon fishery. Teddy also spoke of feeling lonely. Suddenly, a commotion in the kitchen interrupted their conversation. Jack calmly instructed Rollo to go to the beach. Rollo obeyed promptly.

Jack was determined to handle the bullies at the camp with wisdom, not violence. The next day, he woke early, checked the fort's books, and organized the stores. Working hard, Jack set an example for his men. He then went for a brisk walk with Rollo, gradually increasing their pace. Walking at five miles an hour was no easy feat. The men kept up the speed, hiding any signs of fatigue. When the tide forced them onto soft sand, the challenge intensified. Despite the tough conditions, Jack remained composed, even lighting his pipe without slowing down. Rollo, surprised by Jack's calm demeanor, realized he might have underestimated his new leader.|"[""1.

Jack was confident of victory from the start. As they trudged through the heavy sand, sinking at each step, Jack adjusted his strategy. Falling back a bit and extinguishing his pipe, he motivated himself for the win. Jack cleverly stayed just behind Rollo, pushing him to maintain his pace without discouraging him. Five miles from their destination, Jack picked up speed, leaving Rollo panting. Despite a brief rest, Rollo arrived exhausted. Jack, unfazed, joined the fishermen for dinner, where he subtly asserted his dominance. Later, Jack settled into a makeshift bed, unfazed by the discomfort. Observing the fishery's mismanagement, Jack readied himself to make improvements. He understood that bullies like Ladoc were unreliable, fueling his determination to bring change.|['1.

Jack observed Ladoc's dissatisfaction with the leaking vat and scattered salt, but instead of speaking, he and Rollo exchanged silent glances filled with tension. Their eyes conveyed unspoken messages of challenge and defiance. Despite their mutual annoyance, Jack instructed Ladoc to lead the way. As they parted, Jack inspected the nets at the river mouth, yielding a bountiful catch of salmon. Rowing back, the boat overflowed with gleaming fish and unfortunate seals. Jack's peculiar behavior intrigued and overawed the men. He tested Ladoc's limits by setting a brisk pace, leaving Ladoc breathless upon arrival. During breakfast, Jack gathered information about the fishery from the men, discussing the challenges posed by bears and seals. A mistaken bear sighting led to a dramatic confrontation, revealing the true identity of the figure in the bushes.|"['1.

Assisting the wounded Indian, Jack and his companions rushed to his aid. The man, covered in blood and weak from exhaustion, had sustained severe injuries. Taken aback by the unusual wounds, they carried him to safety and tended to his wounds with Jack's medical expertise. Surprisingly, the Indian revealed that the injuries were self-inflicted due to a peculiar accident with his gun. Despite the initial disbelief, the man explained how a fall had led to the gun discharging and causing the injuries.

Jack suddenly spotted the vats in the forest clearing, where a black bear was struggling to fish. Despite wanting to shoot, Jack paused, observing the bear's difficulty with the salmon. The bear's comical attempts to eat the salty fish left Jack laughing too much to aim properly. The bear, disappointed by the taste, turned angry and charged at Jack. Jack fired, hitting the bear but not stopping it. With no time to reload, Jack climbed a tree to escape. The bear, a good climber, pursued Jack up the tree.

The scene was solemn as the Native Americans arrived in a canoe with a wrapped human body, one of their deceased wives. Jack learned they were Roman Catholic converts burying her near the fort. The Indians, lacking resources for a coffin, used old cloth and birchbark. As they lowered the body into the grave, it emitted a dreadful noise. Jack felt uneasy, and Teddy, already superstitious, was terrified. Jack tried to distract himself with writing, reading, and pacing, but the image haunted him. In the kitchen, Teddy, influenced by his grandmother's scary stories, was tormented by every sound.

Teddy was determined to fix the problem with the door latch. He tried various methods like placing bits of wood and nails, but the latch still rattled due to its complex construction. However, Teddy, being clever, found a unique solution. He stuffed dough into the latch to muffle the noise. To further secure the door, he placed a table against it and sat nearby smoking his pipe. When Jack tried to open the door, the obstruction puzzled him, and he burst in forcefully, causing a commotion. Startled by Jack's entrance, Teddy fell over in a panic. Jack, annoyed by the chaos, advised Teddy to be certain before reacting in fear. Later, Jack tried to calm his nerves by reading Shakespeare and retired to bed, only to be disturbed by the view of the graveyard from his window, leading to a sleepless night. Meanwhile, Teddy, scared and unable to bear the tension, sought solace near Jack's room and eventually fell asleep.|"[""1.

Jack's voice faded as he finished getting ready, lost in his thoughts evident from his furrowed brow and tight lips. Eventually, his actions revealed a decision made. Half an hour later, they walked silently towards the fishery, leaving Teddy O'Donel alone with his distress. Jack welcomed a seaman dropped from a ship, guiding him to Fort Desolation, promising shelter and food. The next morning, Jack inspected the place, finding his orders ignored. Quietly, he directed repairs and cleanup, delaying breakfast. Ladoc sneered, Rollo flushed, yet neither spoke. Jack called Ladoc, then Rollo, and finally Francois Xavier, sending each to an old Indian burial ground. The men awaited Jack's arrival, puzzled by the mysterious instructions.|"[""1.
