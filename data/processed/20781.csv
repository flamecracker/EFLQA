On a sunny morning in June, a tall girl from the mountain region led a little girl up a narrow path. The young one's cheeks glowed despite the heat, bundled up as if for frost. With heavy boots and layers of clothes, they climbed for an hour to reach a hamlet halfway up the Alm mountain. Greeted by the villagers, they continued until a woman joined them.

Deta mentioned that it would be easy for Peter to keep an eye on Heidi, as she was bright for her age of five. Heidi's uncle had lost everything except his cottage and two goats.

"The elderly man turned around and gave her a sharp look. The child's dark eyes were gleaming with excitement for what lay ahead. ""She's quite clever,"" he muttered to himself. Then he spoke aloud, ""Why don't you need them anymore?"" ""Okay, you can have them, but go get them, and we'll store them in the cupboard."" The child followed orders.

Heidi discreetly pushed her things to the back of the cupboard. She then asked, ""Where will I sleep, grandfather?"" ""Anywhere you like,"" he replied. Heidi explored the room and found a cozy spot in the hayloft beside the old man's bed, overlooking the valley. The old man then found a cloth resembling a sheet to make her bed more comfortable.

"Heidi opened the door and found herself in a small, dim kitchen. Passing through another door, she entered a narrow room. A woman sat by a table, mending Peter's coat.

In a quaint village, an old man named Heidi lived a solitary life, only venturing down occasionally to sell his cheese and buy supplies. Despite rumors that Heidi was lucky to have left him, the loyal old grandmother defended him, praising his care for Heidi and the repairs he made to her home. Meanwhile, in a grand house in Frankfurt, a sick girl named Clara Sesemann spent her days in a rolling chair in a room filled with books. Clara's strict housekeeper, Miss Rottenmeier, managed the household under Clara's father's instructions to always prioritize Clara's needs. When Heidi's aunt, Deta, brought Heidi to be Clara's companion, she faced skepticism due to Heidi's young age.

Clara, a curious child, welcomed Heidi to Frankfurt. They would have lessons together, and Clara found it amusing to think of Heidi learning to read. Mr. Candidate, their tutor, made the mornings seem endless with his long hours. While he and Miss Rottenmeier yawned behind their books, Heidi had to stifle her yawns or face cod-liver oil. Clara assured Heidi that learning to read would be exciting, and Mr. Candidate would patiently guide her through it. Miss Rottenmeier, feeling responsible for Heidi's arrival, was flustered. During a meal, Heidi, noticing the butler's resemblance to Peter, asked him for a roll and later questioned him about a dish of baked fishes. The butler, struggling not to laugh, left Heidi to her meal.|"[""1.

After Mr. Candidate left, Miss Rottenmeier showed Heidi how to behave at the table and instructed her not to talk to Sebastian unless necessary. She also explained how to interact with the servants and governess. Clara insisted that Heidi call her by her name. Many rules were given about behavior, like closing doors and bedtime. Exhausted from waking up early, Heidi fell asleep during the instructions. The next morning, she woke up in a new room with high windows. Heidi tried to see outside but couldn't. Feeling trapped, she sat down, missing the sights of home. Miss Rottenmeier called Heidi for breakfast, and she joined Clara in the dining room. The tutor arrived, and Miss Rottenmeier sought his help to deal with Heidi, but the tutor remained calm and willing to teach the new student.|"['1.

When the woman realized he wouldn't support her, she allowed him to enter the study alone, as the A,B,C held terrors for her. While she pondered various issues, a dreadful noise like something falling was heard in the next room, followed by a cry for Sebastian's aid. Rushing in, she saw a heap of books and papers on the floor, covered by a tablecloth. An inky stream flowed across the room. Heidi had vanished. The teacher stood, surveying the mess, while Clara found it amusing. Clara defended Heidi, claiming it was an accident. Heidi, in a rush, unintentionally caused the chaos. Heidi, confused, heard the wind in the street and was reminded of the Alp's roar. The lady scolded Heidi for her behavior and the mess she made. Heidi promised to behave better during lessons. In the afternoon, when Clara rested, Heidi found herself in the street asking a boy with a barrel-organ about the tower with the golden dome.|"[""1.

Heidi encountered a boy who asked for something in exchange for guiding her. Reluctant to part with her flower-picture, she eventually offered it. The boy declined but agreed to show her the way home for a double fee. Heidi curiously discovered what a barrel-organ was and rang a bell at an old church. The tower-keeper allowed her to climb up the tower after seeing her tearful eyes. On the way up, they passed an attic with a cat and her kittens. Back home, Miss Rottenmeier scolded Heidi for leaving without notice.

After a long day, Miss Rottenmeier cautiously opened the door to check if the coast was clear. The butler confirmed that it was safe and swiftly whisked the kittens away. The lecture meant for Heidi was postponed as Miss Rottenmeier was too shaken from the scare. That night, everyone retired to bed, comforted by the thought that the kittens were resting comfortably. The next morning, just as the tutor arrived, the doorbell rang vigorously. To everyone's surprise, a dirty street-boy with a barrel-organ on his back entered and started playing. Despite Miss Rottenmeier's attempts to stop the music, the boy continued. Suddenly, a black turtle appeared, causing chaos. Sebastian swiftly removed the boy and the animals, leaving Miss Rottenmeier to maintain order in the study.

Heidi followed them around, but the teacher dismissed her. The housekeeper, after recovering from the scare, called the servants to store the kittens safely. Reluctantly, the lady agreed to speak with Mr. Sesemann before leaving. Clara enjoyed Heidi's company and her funny antics. Heidi struggled with her lessons, finding the letters meaningless. Despite her longing for home, Clara's comforting words and the promise of rolls for her grandmother kept her from leaving. Heidi spent lonely afternoons in her room, yearning for the mountains. Eventually, she decided to return home, packing bread in her shawl and hurrying off. However, she was stopped by Miss Rottenmeier, who questioned her departure.

"About a week later, Mr. Candidate asked to see Mrs. Sesemann to share an unusual event. He told her, ""Mrs. Sesemann, something unexpected has happened."" With many words, he informed the grandmama that Heidi had learned to read correctly, a rare feat for beginners. Mrs. Sesemann noted, ""Many strange things happen in this world."" They went to the study to witness Heidi's new skill. Heidi, amazed, read a story to Clara. At supper, Heidi found a large book on her plate, a gift from grandmama.

Heidi listened intently to the wise old lady, feeling a strong connection to her words. Filled with regret, she decided to seek forgiveness from God. The grandmother reassured Heidi that God would guide her if she trusted in Him. Overwhelmed by guilt, Heidi prayed earnestly for forgiveness and guidance. As the day of departure arrived, Mrs. Sesemann made the necessary arrangements, leaving the children feeling lost without her.

For days, Miss Rottenmeier moved silently around the house, looking over her shoulder as if someone followed her. She always had Tinette accompany her to upper and lower floors. The servants were too scared to be alone and sought each other's company. The cook, shaken by the events, muttered about the strange occurrences. Each morning, the front door was found wide open, despite being locked. John and Sebastian decided to stay up and catch the ghost. Startled by a white form on the stairs, they locked themselves in, terrified. Miss Rottenmeier wrote to Mr. Sesemann, who suggested his mother could help. Clara wanted her father home and refused to be alone. Heidi, unaffected by the ghost stories, stayed calm. The household awaited a solution to the mysterious events.|"['1.

"""It is no joke, Mr. Sesemann,"" said the lady seriously. ""I am sure you will not laugh tomorrow. Those strange events indicate that something secret and horrible has happened in this house in days gone by.""

""Well, I'll show you and John what ghosts look like by day. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves, strong young men like you!

At nine o'clock, the doctor arrived. Despite his grey hair, his face was fresh, and his eyes were lively and kind. When he saw his friend, he laughed and said, ""Well, well, you look pretty healthy for one who needs to be watched all night.""

When the doctor laughed, Mr. Sesemann continued, ""I call that sympathy; I wish my friend Miss Rottenmeier could hear you. She is convinced that an old Sesemann is wandering about, expiating some dreadful deed.""

Mr. Sesemann then explained the circumstances, suggesting it could be a bad joke or a gang of thieves. They entered the room where the two servants had watched before.

Heidi was overwhelmed with emotions, recalling the beautiful night. Tears streamed down her face as she sobbed loudly. Meanwhile, Mr. Sesemann explained to his friend that Heidi was a sleepwalker and homesick, needing the mountain air to recover. However, Sesemann hesitated, not wanting to send her back in her current state. The doctor insisted that Heidi needed the mountain air to heal due to her delicate health. After discussing with his friend, Sesemann decided to follow the doctor's advice. Early in the morning, preparations for Heidi's journey back to the mountains began.

Clara was shocked but couldn't stop her father's plan. He promised a trip to Switzerland if she behaved. Resigned, Clara asked for Heidi's trunk in her room.

Heidi and her grandfather walked home to the peaceful evening bells. Meanwhile, a doctor, grieving his daughter's recent loss, discussed Clara's trip with Mr. Sesemann, seeking advice. Despite his sorrow, the doctor urged caution, wishing for Mr. Sesemann's mother's guidance. The decision weighed heavily on Mr. Sesemann, torn between Clara's longing for the Alps and her health.|"[""1.

"""Sesemann, you must do it,"" the doctor urged. He explained how unwell Clara was and how risky the journey would be. The days were getting shorter, and the cool weather on the Alp would make it hard for Clara to enjoy the trip. The doctor suggested a plan for next May, with Clara going to Ragatz for baths and then being carried up the mountain when it was warmer. Sesemann, feeling sorry for his friend's loneliness, proposed that the doctor visit Heidi instead. Clara, who cared for the doctor, was happy with the idea.

"Clara's eyes welled up with tears, but she knew her father disliked seeing her cry. She understood he only forbade her from certain pleasures out of necessity. ""Please, doctor, go to Heidi,"" she implored. ""Describe her, her grandfather, and Peter with his goats to me. Please take the things I planned to give her. I promise to be good and take my cod-liver oil."" The doctor, with a smile, agreed to go, encouraging Clara to get strong and healthy. Clara asked him to observe everything closely for her.

When Heidi woke up and found her grandfather's bed empty, she hurried outside. The old man was checking the sky to predict the day's weather. As the rosy clouds passed, the sky turned deep blue, and the sun rose gloriously. After tending to the goats, Heidi reunited with her friends, the goats, showing them affection. Heidi had a way with calming the energetic goat, Bärli, by likening its behavior to the Big Turk. Peter, the goat herder, arrived, urging the goats onward. Heidi, caught up in the excitement, couldn't resist the call of the sunny weather, taking breaks from her chores to bask in the mountain's beauty.

Heidi was amazed and confused by the unexpected turn of events. She had imagined a different outcome but found herself consoling her sad friend, the doctor.

Heidi, folding her hands, began to recite comforting verses. The doctor, lost in his thoughts, seemed unresponsive. Memories of his mother singing the same song to him in his childhood flooded back, bringing a sense of warmth. Meanwhile, Peter grew frustrated as Heidi engaged with the doctor, leaving him feeling left out. Overwhelmed with guilt for his anger, he made amends by showing his hands to the sky in a gesture of peace.

Hand in hand, they strolled until the doctor paused. Gently touching Heidi's curly hair, he expressed his wish to take her to Frankfurt. Overwhelmed, Heidi thought of Miss Rottenmeier and Tinette. Tearfully, she asked the doctor to visit them instead. As he left, Heidi ran after him, offering to accompany him to Frankfurt and stay as long as needed. The doctor, moved by her care, asked if she would come to him if he felt lonely. They parted ways, with Heidi watching him until he vanished. The snow-covered Alm-hut and Peter's house were buried deep. Heidi and her grandfather had moved to the village as promised by her uncle, who had once lived in an old ruin near the church.

Approaching the house from the back, you would enter a room with mostly ruined walls. Ivy covered what remained of a chapel on one side. Next was a large hall with a stone floor where grass grew in the cracks. Most walls and part of the ceiling were gone, saved only by a few sturdy pillars. The uncle had made a wooden enclosure for the goats and laid straw on the floor. Several decaying corridors led to a chamber with a heavy iron door, surrounded by dark wood paneling. Inside, a huge stove stood with blue-painted tiles depicting old towers and hunters. Heidi found her bedroom near the stove, and the grandfather showed her the kitchen, the largest she had ever seen. Heidi loved exploring every corner of her new home, eager to share it with Peter the next day.|"['1.

Heidi was busy with school and rarely saw Peter, who struggled to attend regularly due to snow. One day, the sun briefly appeared, revealing the Alp covered in sparkling snow. Peter, surprised by the frozen ground, decided to go to school. He swiftly sled down, reaching the village late. The uncle kindly invited Peter to dinner and offered him to eat with them regularly. Peter, excited by the change, finished his meal quickly. Heidi, sharing her food with Peter, prepared to return home with him. Despite Heidi's chatter, Peter remained silent, focused on avoiding a beating from the uncle. Inside, they found Peter's mother mending, explaining that the grandmother was unwell.

As the evening descended, Heidi made her way back home, marveling at the twinkling stars appearing in the sky one by one. Her grandfather, too, was gazing at the stars, murmuring about the wonderful month and the promising herbs. The blossom month had passed, and June had arrived with its long days and blooming flowers filling the air with fragrance. One morning, Heidi ran out of the hut after finishing her chores and let out a loud scream. A peculiar procession was making its way up the Alm. Two men carried a sedan chair with a young girl, followed by a stately lady on horseback and others. Heidi joyfully exclaimed that they were coming, and soon they all reunited at the top. The children were overjoyed to see each other again, and the grandmother admired the uncle's residence, comparing it to a king's palace. She praised Heidi's rosy appearance and cared for Clara like her own, reminiscing about the uncle's past care for a wounded captain.|"['**1.

Clara gazed longingly at the cloudless sky and rocky crags, yearning to explore beyond the hut to the fir-trees. With Heidi's help, the chair glided over the grass into a grove of ancient trees that had witnessed generations pass by. Clara marveled at their steadfastness. Passing the empty goat-shed, Clara expressed a desire to wait for Schwänli and Bärli, fearing she might miss seeing Peter and his goats if they left too soon. Heidi reassured her, describing the golden carpet of flowers in the pasture, inviting Clara to experience their beauty. As they headed back for dinner, the grandmother admired the breathtaking scenery and noticed Clara indulging in a second piece of cheese.

Peter was asked to assist in lifting the lame child, Clara, from the ground with Heidi's help. Despite the initial ease, Clara struggled to stand on her own. The boy had to be shown how to support Clara, but it was challenging. With Heidi's encouragement, Clara attempted to take steps and, to her joy, succeeded.

Peter was chosen to deliver the message. His uncle whistled loudly, startling Peter, who thought he was in trouble. Instead, he received a paper to take to the village post office. Relieved, Peter set out while the friends gathered around the table to share the miraculous news with grandmama. She was amazed that Clara had transformed so drastically.
