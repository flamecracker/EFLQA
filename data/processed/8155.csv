"John Thorndyke went out into the garden without another word. The hour was nearly up when Mr. Bastow came out; he looked ten years older than he had done on the previous day. He wrung his friend's hand.

""Say nothing about it, Bastow; I don't want to know whether you found anything. Now I am going to fetch two or three of the men from the village, to get them to aid the constable in keeping guard, and another to go up to the house at once and order a groom to saddle one of my horses and bring it here.""

As it was now past five o'clock, and the Squire found most of the men getting up, he sent one off to the house with the message, and returned with two others to the Rectory. He told them briefly that two highwaymen had been arrested during the night, and that as young Mr. Bastow was in their company at the time, it had been necessary as a matter of form to arrest him also. He went upstairs with them.

""I have brought up two men to sit with you, Knapp, until the Reigate constables come up. You can take those handcuffs off Mr. Bastow, but see that he does not leave the room, and do you yourself sit in a chair against the door, and place one of these men at the window. How about others?""

The plot was kept hush-hush, with severe consequences for any leaks. When the time came, a coordinated uprising occurred, overpowering the guards and officials.

The plan discussed by the group involved joining others to kill sheep and retreat into the bush for a few days to avoid pursuit. The group was armed, assuming the black trackers and soldiers wouldn't attack them. They planned to return after a week when things cooled down. They would need to move frequently to avoid detection. They also debated whether to seize a ship together or sneak on board quietly. They agreed that having only six men might not be enough to capture a ship. Lastly, they discussed the importance of keeping their plans secret to prevent betrayal. They gathered at a hut outside town, carrying sheep for a meal after a long journey.

It could have been a great day, but the soldiers passing by ruined it. However, Gentleman Dick and his crew saw it differently. They believed that it wasn't so bad after all. Escaping would have been tough with food shortages and betrayers among them. A smaller group of a dozen is better than a hundred, making it easier to survive. They planned to steal sheep and cattle, with help from some settlers. They decided to split into smaller groups to avoid detection. The next day, they drove off twenty sheep and traveled a hundred miles into the bush to wait until things calmed down. They knew the soldiers wouldn't chase them that far. They aimed to return, raid the settlement for supplies, and plan their escape. They understood the importance of not upsetting the settlers to avoid being hunted down.

After much difficulty, the locals finally understood that the white men needed a guide and water holes. A fifteen-year-old boy was given to them in exchange for two sheep. The next morning, they set off again, feeling lucky. They traveled for four more days, then camped for ten days, enjoying their freedom. When they returned to the settlements, they split into pairs. However, their actions caused an uproar among the settlers, who banded together to hunt them down. Captain Wild realized the situation was dire and decided they needed to leave. They planned to steal horses and supplies, then head to the coast, find a river, camp for a few months, return to rob farmhouses, and then board a ship. They would need new clothes and a convincing story to get on board. John Thorndyke kept tabs on the penal colony and learned about a nearby Crown colony open for settlement.

Mr. Thorndyke discussed with an official about a mutiny led by Arthur Bastow. The Governor reported that Arthur had escaped and might be hiding in the bush. The Squire, though confident Arthur wouldn't return, feared his audacity. To prevent any surprises, they decided to keep a lookout. The head constable assured he would recognize Arthur if he returned, but doubted he would come back to the same area due to his past. The Squire worried about the impact on Arthur's father if he caused more trouble. The Squire and Mark discussed the need to stay cautious and alert the authorities if they noticed any suspicious characters.

A month later, the Reigate coach was halted by two highwaymen just outside town, resulting in a significant theft. Shortly after, reports surfaced of carriages being stopped and burglaries occurring in neighborhoods like Clapham, Wandsworth, and Putney in South London. These incidents, though not uncommon, happening in quick succession, sparked fear among locals. John Thorndyke, elected chairman of the bench after Mr. Chetwynd's passing, visited Bow Street runners to discuss the coach incident. The chief expressed frustration over a lack of leads in the ongoing crimes, suspecting new, daring individuals were behind the burglaries. With patrols doubled and efforts intensified, the authorities were still struggling to apprehend the culprits. Despite investigations and increased security measures, the perpetrators remained elusive, leading to mounting pressure from the Home Secretary. The chief speculated that the coach robbers might be linked to the burglaries, but concrete evidence was lacking. Efforts to track down the criminals faced challenges due to their alliances, hidden horses, and the scattered nature of reported sightings.|"[""1.

A month later, John Thorndyke had to go to town again, and this time Mark went with him. They both carried pistols, along with the groom seated behind them. The Squire, although not a great shot himself, had advised Mark to practice shooting. He explained that dueling was abhorrent, but in the current climate, being able to defend oneself was crucial. The roads were dangerous with highwaymen, making shooting skills essential. Mark was told to practice shooting at night, relying on his arm's memory to aim correctly. The Squire received news that a stranger had inquired about Mark, claiming to have known him from years ago near Hastings. The stranger seemed suspicious, prompting the Squire to take precautions. While on their way to Reigate, two highwaymen ambushed them, demanding their valuables. In the tense moment that followed, Mark managed to fire first, causing one highwayman to retreat.|"['1.

Mark, listen carefully to your uncle's warning. While it may seem like a delusion, if there are Hindoo individuals still after that bracelet, you must take extreme precautions.

Mark was awake for hours before finally falling asleep. The news he heard that evening was strange and surprising. Despite not being the heir to the estate as he had always believed, he was not troubled. In four years, he would inherit a significant sum of money, allowing him the freedom to travel and live as he pleased. However, one thing did sadden him. His father had hinted at a potential match with his ward, Millicent, whom he admired. But now, with recent events, he feared she might think he was only interested in her for her newfound wealth. Additionally, the mystery of the lost treasure and his father's tragic death weighed heavily on his mind. He awoke to the devastating discovery of his father's violent passing.

The inquest was brief, with many questions focused on the firing through the window. Mark mentioned it was already dark, making it hard to describe the figure of the man who rode off.

Dr. Holloway had a dim view of the man the day before, fearing he wouldn't recover. The speaker believed it was for the best, considering the man's frailty and the completion of his work. Mrs. Cunningham shared this sentiment, indicating the deep bond between the man and the speaker's father. The conversation shifted to other topics, but Millicent, still grieving, excused herself.

Mark expressed his excitement about the unexpected news, sharing his desire to explore the world and make a name for himself rather than settling for a quiet life as a magistrate. Millicent, on the other hand, was troubled by the revelation and worried about the implications of their newfound wealth. Mark reassured her that the estate's funds could sustain them, and they discussed the need for secrecy regarding their inheritance.

The girl expressed her decision, stating it would be wrong to accept the estate against her father's wishes. She made it clear to Mr. Prendergast that she did not intend to inherit it. The funeral of Squire Thorndyke and Mr. Bastow was emotional, with villagers and gentry paying their respects. Mark was touched by the community's grief. Mr. Prendergast found the funeral deeply moving, remarking on the villagers' heartfelt tears. He planned to read the wills of the Colonel and John Thorndyke to Mark. The Colonel's will ensured his daughter, Millicent, would not marry for money, leaving the estate to John Thorndyke until Millicent turned 21 or married.

The lawyer, Mr. Prendergast, explained the will to Millicent, who inherited the estate but was too young to act on it. He advised her to wait until she turned twenty-one. He suggested that many things could happen before then, like marriage or her cousin Mark inheriting the estate if she passed away. Mark, her cousin, lamented the situation but hoped for their interests to align. Mrs. Cunningham, wanting a change of scenery due to the sad memories in the house, planned to take Millicent away.

In the late afternoon, Ramoo entered quietly as usual. He seemed burdened with grief, appearing much older than before. Ramoo expressed his desire to return to India, feeling the pull of his homeland and the need to live out his days there. Despite the sadness of leaving behind his young missie and the sahib, he knew it was time to go. Millicent, though fond of Ramoo, understood his decision. It was agreed that Ramoo would depart for India, as his presence might draw unwanted attention in London. Mark, acknowledging the change in circumstances, arranged for Ramoo's legacy and discussed his voyage.

Millicent expressed concerns about the dangerous task Mark was undertaking and suggested involving the authorities. She believed Mark shouldn't risk his life in such a perilous mission. Mrs. Cunningham, hopeful for a union between Millicent and Mark, smiled as she worked. Millicent had grown from seeing Mark as a big brother to asserting her own opinions.

"There is a reasonable guess. Yes, there is something in that.

“The top one is silver by the feel,” he said, “not yet broken up; these smaller sacks are solid. I suppose it is silver that has been melted down. This--” and he lifted a bag some eighteen inches deep, opened it, and looked in “--contains watches and jewels. Now I think we will leave things here for the present, and put everything straight. He may be back before long.”

Mark ascended, the bottom of the trap was shut down again, the corn poured in, and the bags thrown down on the spot from which they had been taken. They returned to the house, shut the door, and extinguished the light.

“That it will, Mr. Thorndyke. I have no doubt that this fellow is the man we have been in search of for the last eighteen months; that accounts for our difficulty in laying hold of him. He has been too crafty to try to sell any of his plunder, so that none of the fences have known anything about him. No doubt he has taken sufficient cash to enable him to live here quietly.

Plans were made to search the area for Mr. Thorndyke. The thieves claimed ignorance about his whereabouts, mentioning a mysterious order from a stranger. Despite efforts to extract information, the thieves professed no knowledge of the incident. The Lieutenant decided to post men in the area and search every house to uncover the truth.|"['1.

The command was clear: no knives. Each person was frisked before heading to the dock and handed a stick.

“You can do that, sir, but I don't think you will be there before the barge; they have something like eighteen hours' start for you, and the wind has been all the time in the east. I should say that they would be there by eight o'clock this morning.”

I was surprised to find the ropes looser, but still tight enough to take almost an hour to free my hands. Untying my legs took nearly as long due to their intricate knots.
