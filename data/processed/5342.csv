Across the brook field, a valley and a hill with firs and leafless beeches lay to the west. Behind our house, a grove of fir and spruce exuded a woodsy scent. Beyond, Uncle Roger's house stood. Ahead, the famous King orchard, rich in history, was enclosed by a spruce hedge. Planted nearly sixty years ago by Grandfather King, each tree held a story.

Once upon a time, every king fought to prove their supremacy, causing bloodshed and misery. Amidst this, a proud princess worked on a lace veil, rumored to cost lives for each stitch. Despite many kings vying for her hand, she remained unwed. One day, a lone knight arrived, offering to marry her in his kingdom to prove his worth. Reluctantly, she accepted, donning the veil. The wedding was eerie, with no laughter. As they rode, a storm led them to a dark valley of tombs. The knight vanished with the princess, leaving a legend of her veil in the clouds. The tale left us spellbound until Dan broke the silence. The next day, as we awaited the Story Girl, Felicity and Cecily donned new dresses, each with their own concerns. Felicity, in her usual beauty, and Cecily, with her unruly curls, set the stage for an eventful evening.|['1.

Peter and the Story Girl soon joined us. Peter, despite a patch on his trousers, looked presentable with his rosy face, neatly combed black curls, and a well-tied bow. We were relieved, although we couldn't help but notice the holes in his trousers. Peter explained that he wore two pairs to hide them. Felicity offered him a cent, but Dan lent him one, to be repaid the next week. As we passed through the old graveyard to the Carlisle church, we saw the King family plot, with Great-grandfather King's ivy-covered tombstone and Great-grandmother King's questionable poetry. The church had a traditional design, with ivy-hung towers and surrounded by tall elms. The Story Girl placed violets on her mother's grave and read the verse inscribed there, moving us all with its beauty and poignancy. The church's interior matched its old-fashioned exterior, with square pews and a wine-glass pulpit. Uncle Alec's pew was near the pulpit, at the top of the church.|"['1.

Peter's arrival at church went unnoticed, despite our anticipation. The atmosphere was serene, with dim lighting and a quiet hush. The sky outside displayed a blend of purple, gold, and silvery green hues, adorned with rosy clouds above the elms. During the service, Felicity frowned at Peter for talking, and the Story Girl nudged him to maintain decorum. Peter complied, sitting upright and attentive. However, a mishap occurred during the collection when Peter burst into laughter after recalling a humorous story. The congregation turned to look at our pew, causing embarrassment all around. Despite the tension, Felicity explained that the Story Girl's tales prompted her laughter, citing specific comical anecdotes involving church members. The incident ended in silence until we reached the moonlit road, where Felicity justified her unintentional outburst.|"['1.

We all burst into laughter right there, much to Mrs. Abraham Ward's dismay, who saw us as she passed by. She later scolded Aunt Janet, saying we had behaved improperly on the way home from church. We felt embarrassed because we knew that Sundays should be spent with decency and order. Despite feeling ashamed, even Felicity couldn't help but laugh. Surprisingly, Felicity wasn't as upset with Peter as expected. She walked alongside him and let him carry her Bible, engaging in a friendly conversation. Peter expressed his interest in continuing to attend church, finding sermons and singing enjoyable. He pondered whether to be a Presbyterian or a Methodist, considering asking the ministers for advice. Felicity, a Presbyterian, couldn't explain the differences between the two but was content with her choice. As we strolled up the hill, the scent of the orchard filled the air, evoking a unique feeling that we couldn't quite grasp at our young age.|"[""1.

"""The orchard looks different under the moonlight,"" the Story Girl mused. ""I used to believe fairies danced here at night. I wish I could still believe, but I know it's not true."" Reflecting on how hard it is to let go of childhood fantasies, she shared how her uncle shattered her belief in fairies. Despite understanding the truth, she couldn't help but feel a change towards him. The group then discussed helping a sick cat named Paddy. They decided to follow Aunt Jane's method of mixing medicine in lard for the cat to lick off. This ritual, led by the Story Girl, helped Paddy recover. The friends then embarked on a new adventure - raising funds for a school library. Each student had to collect money, with Peter facing challenges due to his circumstances.

"In the little town of Carlisle, a group of friends made various deals to earn money. Felicity, The Story Girl, and Cecily were paid ten cents a week for washing dishes, while Felix and Dan kept gardens weed-free. Sara Ray felt left out as she had no way to earn money like her friends. She was upset because her mother did not support her involvement in a school library project. Meanwhile, Felix, despite not liking weeding, worked diligently. The narrator, feeling insecure about their height, bought ""magic seed"" from Billy, believing it could make them grow taller.

I was thankful to Billy and regretful that I hadn't appreciated him more. It seemed no one truly liked Billy Robinson. But I promised myself I would change that. I handed him the ten cents happily and took the enchanted seed as instructed. I diligently measured my height daily against a mark on the hallway door. After three days, I couldn't see any growth progress yet. The Story Girl suggested asking the Awkward Man and Mr. Campbell for a donation to the library fund. They were seen as odd characters, especially Mr. Campbell, who was believed to dislike children. Despite this, we followed the Story Girl's lead and set out on Saturday afternoon on a shortcut to Golden Milestone through serene meadows. Initially, there were some disagreements, but the Story Girl's vibrant presence in her exquisite crimson silk dress and white hat adorned with red poppies brought a sense of joy and warmth to our journey.|"['1.

In Prince Edward Island, a mysterious room surprised Mrs. Griggs. It was elegantly furnished, unlike before, with green velvet carpet, lace curtains, and beautiful pictures. The room had a bed, a dressing table, a bookcase, and a rocking chair. A woman's picture adorned the wall above the bookcase. What puzzled Mrs. Griggs most was a woman's dress of pale blue silk and blue satin slippers that didn't belong to Jasper Dale's mother. The name 'Alice' was written in the books. The Story Girl was determined to solve the mystery of the west room, where Jasper Dale, a hermit, lived. Despite his awkwardness, the Story Girl believed he was a kind man who wrote poetry.

We were close to Golden Milestone, where we found a large, gray house covered in vines and roses. The Story Girl pointed out how the three windows on the second floor seemed to wink at us through the greenery. As we approached the house, we met the Awkward Man in his yard. He kindly gave us money for our library. The man appeared tall and slender, looking younger than his age with a smooth forehead, bright blue eyes, and dark hair. Although we were curious about the Awkward Man, our attention soon turned to Mr. Campbell, a wealthy retired farmer known for his travels and intellect. Despite being warned that Mr. Campbell could be moody, the Story Girl was determined to visit him, while the rest of us were apprehensive.

Mr. Campbell's housekeeper welcomed us into his living room and then left. Soon, Mr. Campbell himself appeared at the door, observing us closely. We felt encouraged. He seemed to be in a good mood, with a slight smile on his broad, clean-shaven face. Mr. Campbell was tall with thick, black hair streaked with gray, big black eyes, and a thin, firm mouth. He appeared handsome for his age. His attention shifted to the Story Girl, seated elegantly in an armchair, resembling a delicate red lily. A spark lit up Mr. Campbell's eyes. He mentioned he was reluctant to spend money unless he benefited from it. However, he proposed a deal - the Story Girl could tell him a story, and he would pay according to the entertainment value.

He revealed his plan to propose to Nancy that night.

The Story Girl visited Aunt Louisa in Charlottetown for a week in June, leaving her friends feeling dull and lonesome. However, excitement stirred when Felix shared a thrilling tale on their way home from school. Jerry Cowan claimed to have seen a picture of God in an old history book at home. Eager to see it, the group persuaded Jerry to bring the book to school. The next day, Jerry reneged, offering to tear out the picture for fifty cents each. Determined to have it, the friends pooled their money and arranged to meet Jerry in the granary loft. Amidst rain and mist, the sun broke through as Jerry arrived with the picture, wrapped in a newspaper. The friends paid him, eagerly anticipating the unveiling of the mysterious image.|"['1.

Felix and I stayed silent. Disappointment and something worse kept us from speaking. The picture of God Cecily had was of a stern, angry old man with a beard. Cecily insisted that God is wonderful and beautiful, not like the picture. We were hesitant to question the minister, but we needed to know the truth. Felix asked the minister if God truly looked like the picture. The minister explained that no one knows how God looks, and we shouldn't try to imagine it. He emphasized that God is far more loving and beautiful than we can comprehend. The minister called the picture a sacrilege and told us to burn it.

Canterbury Bells is a beautiful name for a flower, evoking thoughts of cathedrals and chimes. Let's head to Uncle Stephen's Walk and perch on the branches of the large tree. The ground is too damp, and I have a true story to share about an old lady I saw in town. She had lovely silvery curls. After the rain, the warm west wind carried scents of fir balsam, mint, and the earthy fragrance of ferns. In Uncle Stephen's Walk, delicate pale flowers, known as the White Ladies, bloomed mysteriously. They seemed like the souls of patient women. The Story Girl narrated a poignant tale about Mrs. Dunbar and the Captain of the FANNY, a story of tragedy and beauty from the Gold Rush era in 1849.|"[""1.

The hero of my tale is Captain Alan Dunbar from the ship _Fanny_. He was young, handsome, and deeply in love with Margaret Grant, a beautiful woman with soft blue eyes and golden hair. Despite their love, Margaret's parents opposed their union, forcing them apart when Alan had to sail to California. Desperate to be together, Margaret ran away, and they married in Charlottetown. Alan intended to take Margaret with him, but the crew and passengers refused. Tearfully, Alan had to leave Margaret behind. Despite forgiveness from her parents, Margaret waited in agony for news.

Felicity wiped her eyes, saying the past couldn't be changed by tears. She suggested they get something to eat, mentioning she made rhubarb tarts. When it was time to contribute to the library fund, Peter had the most with three dollars, thanks to well-laid eggs. Felicity followed with two and a half. Sara Ray arrived after tea, beaming with three dollars from her uncle. She donated it all, grateful for the unexpected gift. Despite earning their money through hard work or asking, they felt differently about Sara's sudden fortune. Dan pointed out that they could earn money, unlike Sara. They then headed to the orchard to hear a letter from the Story Girl's father, Uncle Blair Stanley, who was seen as a free-spirited artist by the grown-ups.|"['1.

Uncle Blair had a special talent for writing letters, unlike Felix and the narrator, who were embarrassed by their father's poorly written notes. The Story Girl shared a captivating letter from Uncle Blair about his adventures in Switzerland, describing majestic mountains and ancient tales. The Story Girl's storytelling transported them to distant lands, making Europe seem within reach. As they sat under the evening sky, enchanted by the surroundings, they realized their friend Billy had deceived them with magic seeds promising impossible transformations.

Our discovery that the magical seed was simply caraway from Billy Robinson's uncle's farm in Markdale was a humbling moment. Peg Bowen had no involvement in the hoax. Despite feeling deceived, we chose not to spread the word or confront Billy. We believed silence was the best remedy. Sitting in Uncle Roger's barn under the July sun, we lounged in the hayloft, enjoying the sweet scent of freshly stored hay. The hayloft's shadows and soft sounds added a touch of mystery. Swallows fluttered in and out, casting golden dust when sunlight streamed through the cracks. Paddy the cat roamed around, a perfect fit for the hayloft. The Story Girl, humble about her looks, cherished her hair, eyes, and feet, especially when she could go barefoot in the warm weather. She lamented that as she grew older, her feet would be covered most of the time, which she found unfair.|"[""1.

We were all thrilled about the magic lantern show that an itinerant lecturer was going to present in the schoolhouse that evening. Even Felix and I, who had seen many such shows, were intrigued, and the others were very enthusiastic. It was the first time such an event was happening in Carlisle, so the excitement was palpable. Everyone, including Peter, was looking forward to it. Peter had been accompanying us everywhere lately, even to church and Sunday School, where his behavior was impeccable. The Story Girl took credit for guiding Peter in the right direction. Despite Felicity's annoyance at the patch on Peter's trousers, the group sympathized with Sara Ray, who was upset because her mother forbade her from attending the show due to measles in Markdale. The Story Girl suggested that Cecily accompany Sara to persuade her mother, but Felicity disagreed, knowing it might worsen the situation.|"['1.

Sara was torn between her desire to attend the magic lantern show and her lack of appropriate clothing due to her good clothes being locked away. Despite her initial reluctance, she yielded to the Story Girl's persuasion and borrowed some attire for the event. As they made their way to the schoolhouse, the group enjoyed the beautiful evening, with a picturesque sunset casting a dreamy glow over the landscape. The air was filled with the sweet scent of hayfields and wild roses, enhancing their walk. While some in the group, like Felicity and Cecily, were carefree, Sara Ray's conscience weighed heavily on her, despite the entertaining show.

We returned to earth, feeling like we had been among heavenly hosts. Although we were too young to grasp the full meaning of the legend, we sensed its beauty and appeal.

The Story Girl shared the tale of King Cophetua and the beggar maid in the orchard at sunset. Sara was sick, possibly with measles, and the guilt weighed heavily on Felicity.

During the vacation, we had a relaxed day with not much to do. While we were eager to head to the orchard, the Story Girl opted to stay behind. She sat in a hot corner of the kitchen, determined to sew buttonholes on a piece of old cotton all day. She explained that she was not going to play or tell stories that day. The Story Girl believed that true penance should be uncomfortable, so she chose a task she disliked. She mentioned her plan to attend a missionary talk later, despite feeling uncomfortable about missing it. She decided to wear her school dress and hat as an additional penance.

Felicity did a bad thing. She made tempting raisin pies at work and ate them in front of the Story Girl, who loved them. The Story Girl saw her friends enjoying the pies while she worked on her sewing. Despite distractions like a new magazine and her cat trying to get her attention, the Story Girl focused on her work. Later, when guests arrived, the Story Girl dressed plainly and felt embarrassed. At a missionary meeting, she wore a simple outfit compared to her friends.

"""I'm not very interested in missionaries like you all are,"" he mentioned. ""But perhaps if I start giving something, I'll become interested. I'll want to know where my money goes. I can't give much. When your dad's gone, and your mom is out working, and you only earn fifty cents a week, you can't donate much to help others. But I'll try my best.

Oh, see the moonlight on the road between the spruce trees! I wish I had a gown made of moonlight with stars for buttons.""

Uncle Roger, jokingly blaming her for the mishap, teased her about the questionable quality of the pudding. The Story Girl, feeling ashamed, decided to give up cooking to avoid any further mishaps.

The warning had an impact. The Story Girl managed to keep us from mentioning the cursed pudding again. However, she couldn't silence the adults, especially Uncle Roger. He teased her relentlessly for the rest of the summer, always joking about sawdust in the porridge and needles causing his rheumatism. Aunt Olivia was even advised to label pincushions as not fit for puddings. One tranquil August evening, we gathered in the orchard under the warm sunset sky. Cecily shared wise words about marriage, diverting a potential argument between Dan and Felicity.

Long ago in Greece, where many beautiful things occurred, the discovery of kissing was recorded. In a quiet village named Thebes, a young shepherd named Glaucon lived. Feeling the village was too quiet, he set out to explore the world and ended up in Thessaly, near Mount Pelion. There, he worked for a wealthy man tending sheep. Glaucon spent his days playing the flute under the trees, thinking of Aglaia, his master's daughter. Unbeknownst to him, Aglaia would often listen to his music from afar, falling in love with him. Eventually, they confessed their feelings, and Aglaia found a beautiful stone by a brook to gift Glaucon. Their love story blossomed in the Golden Age, a time when social status did not hinder true love.|"['1.

Once upon a time, Aglaia encountered the fearsome god Pan while running up a mountain. Pan, with his goat-like appearance, chased her with thunderous hoofs. Luckily, Aglaia reached Glaucon, a brave shepherd, who protected her by invoking Pan's duty to good shepherds. Pan, grumbling, finally left. Aglaia, in her panic, had a precious stone in her mouth, which Glaucon wanted to retrieve without letting her fall. He cleverly decided to take the stone with his own lips. The story ends with the stone falling to the ground, turning out to be valuable. As the wagons approached, Uncle Alec and Aunt Janet arrived, bringing joy and laughter to the gathering. The evening was filled with tales, laughter, and the comforting purrs of Paddy the cat.|"['1.

"""I'm glad to be back home,"" Aunt Janet smiled. ""Edward's family was lovely, but there's no place like home. How have things been here? How were the kids, Roger?"" Peter sighed, ""I have to start clearing the elderberry pasture today. It's a tough job for sure."" In the orchard on a sunny August Saturday, Cecily and Sara Ray nibbled on timothy roots, a trend started by Bertha Lawrence from Charlottetown. Pat, the Story Girl's cat, roamed around seeking attention. The boys lounged on the grass, chores done.

One Monday, Felicity and the Story Girl argued, but the reason remains a mystery. Their silence lingered, not due to lasting anger but a battle of pride. Despite sweet Cecily's tears and prayers, the girls refused to reconcile. The Story Girl's caution hinted at a prolonged rift, worrying Cecily. Dan's skepticism about their reconciliation made Cecily anxious, fearing his beliefs might mirror Uncle Robert Ward's skepticism. They pondered heaven and THE OTHER PLACE, with Cecily feeling sorry for those destined for the latter. Andrew Marr's macabre comment about fires in THE OTHER PLACE startled them, questioning the nature of heaven and hell.|"[""1.

Andrew's words were just a facade to impress us, as the Marrs tend to be. Despite that, I hope something will excite the Story Girl. I doubt praying for Felicity to speak first will work. Could God make her? I felt it unfair for the Story Girl to always speak first. Felix tried to make peace, but the girls rebuffed him. The adults found their coldness amusing, not realizing its impact on us. The Story Girl, with her wreath, smiled mysteriously, hinting at a tale. Before she could speak, Felix arrived, pale and distressed. Felicity impatiently asked what was wrong. The cup fell, shattering, but no one noticed, consumed by the impending news.|"[""1.

Felicity, Sara Stanley, and the others were in a state of shock after reading a newspaper headline predicting the Judgment Day to be the next day. The Story Girl, usually convincing, seemed uncertain this time. Cecily pointed out that even angels don't know when the Judgment Day will come.

In September, the orchard buzzed with activity. Pat dashed over with a mouse in his mouth, devouring it with gusto. Cecily rushed back, trembling, announcing it was four o'clock. Tea awaited, despite the old clock halting. As we readied for Sunday School, Aunt Janet reminded us of the day. Peter affirmed his Presbyterian vow, recalling a tale of refined language mishaps. The transition from summer to autumn painted the landscape in purple asters and red apples. Crickets serenaded, squirrels chattered, and golden sunshine bathed us. School resumed, bringing days of work and play, followed by rest under autumn stars. Uncle Roger's curiosity piqued as he passed through, hinting at our mischievous activities.

"""No, it isn't,"" said the Story Girl sadly. ""It's expressive but not nice. Many words are like that - expressive but not nice, so a girl can't use them."" She sighed again. Expressive words were her treasure, like lustrous pearls on a vivid fancy cord. She cherished them, repeating new ones to herself, making them her own. Writing down dreams meticulously for future generations was our pastime for two weeks. The idea was born in a rain-wet spruce wood while gum picking.

"We all had dream books, bought by the Story Girl in Markdale. They were ten cents each, with green covers and ruled pages. My own, labeled ""The Dream Book of Beverley King,"" contains the visions that haunted my childhood nights. Inside, I find memories of our group sitting in the orchard, writing down our dreams. Peter, Dan, Felix, Cecily, Felicity, Sara Ray, and the Story Girl were all there, each with a dream book and pencil. Cecily, with her dictionary, Felicity, beautiful and aware of it, Peter sprawled among the grass, and Dan groaning and writhing as he wrote.

Sara Ray's dreams were often filled with mishaps, like struggling to braid her hair or wearing shoes on the wrong feet. One memorable dream she had involved falling out of a balloon, a scenario that Peter explained could be fatal if she hadn't woken up. Peter, on the other hand, dreamt of dangerous situations, like causing an explosion with a match in a store. Felix, known for his vivid dreams, often dreamt of flying, while Cecily's dreams were dramatic, and Felix's were amusing. One standout dream was when a rhinoceros chased Aunt Janet but turned into a harmless pig. Felix refused liver pills to avoid losing his ability to dream, recalling a story of someone who stopped dreaming after taking them.

Sara Ray shared her fear of being chased in dreams, unable to run, feeling paralyzed as the danger approached. The Story Girl dreamt of opening a mysterious blue chest with haunting consequences. Felix was upset by the dreams, and Felicity had a comical mishap trying to capture her dream by writing it down, accidentally setting her nightgown on fire. Despite the scolding she received, Felicity remained unfazed, valuing the importance of dreams over material possessions. Peter sought advice from Dan and the narrator about a dilemma he faced, leading them to a secret meeting in the spruce wood to discuss the matter away from the girls' prying eyes.|"['1.

Last night, Peter shared a peculiar dream with his friends. In the dream, he found himself in a crowded church, sitting down without a stitch of clothing on. Worried if it was appropriate to share this dream with the girls, Peter hesitated. Despite being mischievous and full of fun, the girls were always dignified and proper. Even when Dan once swore and faced consequences, the girls maintained their purity and grace. As the days passed, the Story Girl and Peter began sharing vivid and dramatic dreams, sparking curiosity among their friends. However, the two kept a secret for weeks, leaving everyone intrigued. The Story Girl's behavior changed, showing signs of illness, which concerned Aunt Olivia. If her condition didn't improve, a visit to the doctor might be necessary.|"['1.

The Story Girl tried Mexican Tea to cure her condition, but her dreams remained vivid. Felicity persuaded Peter to spill the secret by using her charm. It turned out that Peter and the Story Girl ate rich snacks before bed to induce dreams. They snuck treats from the pantry during the day, leading to wild visions at night. The group followed suit, eating indulgent snacks to provoke imaginative dreams. However, their stomachs rebelled, causing arguments and even a fight between the Story Girl and the narrator. Only Peter remained unaffected. Cecily ate a cucumber in hopes of having an exciting dream like Peter's encounter with cannibals. As Uncle Alec's return neared, they hurriedly put away their snacks, pretending to be asleep as Aunt Janet checked on them.|"['1.

In a short while, the whole house bustled with activity. Cecily was very unwell, even worse than Dan when he ate the bad berries. Despite Uncle Alec being tired, he rushed to fetch the doctor. Aunt Janet and Felicity tried all home remedies, but to no avail. The doctor discovered that the combination of milk and cucumbers had made Cecily sick. Though not life-threatening, she would feel unwell for a few days. The incident led to a family discussion about dream books and the consequences of eating rich foods. Despite initial worry and scolding, the children soon forgot their troubles and laughter filled the air, echoing through the barns and groves.|['1.

Presently, the adults' laughter mixed with ours. Aunt Olivia, Uncle Roger, Aunt Janet, and Uncle Alec joined our group in the orchard at the magical time between day and night. They shed their adult worries and became like children again. Uncle Roger and Uncle Alec lounged like boys, Aunt Olivia looked like a pansy in a lovely purple dress, and Aunt Janet's face relaxed from its usual care. Uncle Roger asked for a creepy story, and the Story Girl began, but a strange feeling overcame us. The Story Girl's demeanor changed, and we felt a sense of fear. This experience made me understand how unfulfilled dreams can affect people. The atmosphere turned somber as we learned that Pat, our beloved cat, was very ill. Tears flowed as we tried to comfort him, realizing the seriousness of the situation.|"['1.

The Story Girl stood up and calmly asked Peter to explain what was wrong with Paddy. Peter, feeling compelled by her tone, began to recount how Peg Bowen had visited and trampled on Pat's tail, causing him to claw her foot. The children debated whether Peg was a witch, with some believing she had put a spell on Pat. Despite their fears, they hesitated to confront Peg, knowing her reputation for spitefulness. The Story Girl, desperate for a solution, considered seeking out Peg but was cautioned against it by Felicity, who warned of the potential consequences.

Uncle Roger expressed that turning into an animal is a simple task for a witch like Peg Bowen. He suspected that Pat was under a spell. Peter suggested offering a gift to Peg and asking for her help without accusing her of bewitching Pat. The Story Girl proposed a plan where everyone would bring a gift for Peg and visit her that evening. They would quietly leave the gifts with a letter and show respect. They decided not to offer money but items like jewelry. They also discussed Peg's mysterious past and the importance of addressing her respectfully.

"We received our ""testimonials"" and set off on our hesitant journey to the witch's domain. Sara Ray opted to stay behind with Pat. We chose not to inform the adults of our mission, fearing their disapproval. Peg Bowen's house was almost a mile away, past the swamp and up a wooded hill. As we approached, the woods grew dark, and we felt a sense of unease. Walking silently, we knew it was best not to speak near the dwelling of witches. Despite Peg not being a witch, caution was wise. As we reached the lane leading to her house, our hearts raced. The small, dilapidated building had no ground floor entrance, only a door on the upper story accessed by rickety steps. A large black cat sat ominously on the top step. When Peg Bowen emerged, she appeared formidable and unfriendly, clad in ragged clothing and scowling with piercing black eyes."|"[""1.

We bravely held on despite our fears, until panic overtook us. Peter yelped in terror, and we ran into the woods, convinced Peg Bowen was chasing us. The Story Girl led, leaping over obstacles, while Cecily gasped for us to wait and hurry. Instinctively, we stuck together and made it out of the woods. In a field under a pink sky, we felt relieved. The Story Girl stayed up to watch over Pat, with Aunt Olivia's surprising approval. Aunt Janet sent us to bed, scolding us for being upset over a cat. We climbed the stairs, knowing prayer was our last hope for Pat's recovery. Cecily insisted on praying for Pat, defending that God could help him.

Even in my later years, I am not ashamed to admit that I prayed sincerely for our furry friend Pat's recovery. The next morning, we hurried to Uncle Roger's house, only to be met by Peter and the Story Girl with joyful news. Pat had miraculously improved, licking his paws and even enjoying a saucer of milk. The Story Girl was ecstatic, but Peter remained skeptical, suspecting Peg Bowen's involvement. On a warm Sunday evening, we gathered in the orchard, singing hymns under the golden-rod moon. The scene vividly comes to mind, with the sky's primrose hue, the bountiful orchard, and the joyful voices of my family. Uncle Roger shared tales of Uncle Edward, igniting the Story Girl's imagination. Uncle Edward, even at ten, had preached from the Pulpit Stone, his fervor leaving us both inspired and uncomfortable.|"[""1.

One Sunday afternoon, we played a game of fruit-basket using Bible characters' names. Felix suggested it to make it okay to play on Sundays. We had a merry time calling out names like Lazarus and Martha. Peter wanted to stick to his name but we insisted he choose another to be fair. Peter chose Nebuchadnezzar, which was hard to say quickly. Suddenly, Uncle Alec and Aunt Janet interrupted us. The Story Girl then proposed a sermon competition. Each boy would preach, and the best sermon would win a prize. I decided to preach about missions, adding dramatic verses to make an impact. I wrote my sermon with red “thump” marks for emphasis, feeling proud. I practiced it in the granary, even though I doubted Peter's ability to beat me.|['1.

Mr. Marwood had three eager listeners on Sunday morning: Felix, Peter, and I absorbed tips on sermon delivery. We observed every move, gesture, and tone. Although we forgot the text later, we memorized the dramatic gestures needed for a powerful delivery. In the afternoon, we gathered in the orchard with Bibles and hymn books, keeping our plans from the adults who might disapprove of Sunday games. With nervousness, I climbed the pulpit steps, and our session began with songs and readings, skipping prayers. We collected funds for missions, solemnly led by Dan. My sermon, despite my best efforts, fell flat, unnoticed by my bored audience. Despite a brief moment of self-encouragement, I knew Felix would win the prize.|"[""1.

Uncle Alec mentioned that heads were becoming less popular, but Peter disagreed, valuing the importance of having heads and sticking to them. Aunt Jane believed that without heads, one would wander aimlessly. On a warm October Sunday, Peter, dressed in his new suit, prepared to deliver his sermon. He divided his message into three heads: what not to do to avoid the bad place, describing the bad place, and how to escape it. Peter emphasized the importance of listening to good advice, avoiding lies, murder, and suicide, and remembering to pray.

Peter, a young preacher, shared some rules with the children. He advised them not to play games on Sundays, whisper, or laugh in church. He also warned against fighting, using bad words, getting drunk, and making faces. He explained that following these rules reduces the risk of facing consequences. Peter then described the consequences of misbehaving, drawing inspiration from a story about a man who was late for a sermon and was made to listen to it again. He vividly described the bad place, using his own words to convey the seriousness of the message.

Sara Ray suddenly stood up with a scream that turned into strange laughter, leaving everyone, including the preacher, shocked. Cecily and Felicity rushed to her side as Sara Ray seemed to be in a fit of hysterics. Her behavior was unfamiliar to them, and they feared she had gone mad. Peter, feeling bitter, mentioned that Sara needn't have been so scared and that he could have shown her a way to avoid going to a bad place. The adults scolded the children for playing such a serious game on a Sunday, threatening consequences if it happened again. Sara eventually calmed down, apologizing to Peter for disrupting his sermon. Despite feeling disappointed for missing his chance to preach, Felix blamed Sara for the interruption.

The Story Girl shared a new game idea with her friends involving eating apples without making a face. Peter excelled at the challenge, impressing everyone. Felix, however, became obsessed with beating Peter at this game. He prayed fervently to succeed but always faltered at the final bite. Eventually, Cecily revealed that Peter was praying against Felix's success. This news left Felix disheartened, realizing the reason behind his repeated failures. Despite his efforts, Felix could never conquer the challenge due to Peter's interference.

Cecily was shocked by Felix's comments about God's fairness. She believed that Peter's dedication to prayer, three times a day and whenever he felt like it, made him deserving of blessings. Peter, feeling entitled to pray for what he wanted, refused to yield to Felix's opinions. Cecily tried to prevent a fight, suggesting they all abandon the Ordeal. Eventually, they agreed to settle the matter in the secluded fir wood behind Uncle Roger's granary at sunset.

Peter and Felix engaged in a heated scuffle, resulting in Peter getting a black eye and Felix's nose bleeding. Cecily, alarmed, ran off. The commotion dampened by her distress.

In the orchard, we carefully picked apples, while some were shaken down from the trees by us boys, causing the girls to shriek. The days were crisp and sunny, with a hint of frost in the air.

"""Sara, come here,"" said Aunt Olivia, bending down to her. The Story Girl stood up and walked away with Aunt Olivia embracing her. Her sobs faded under the trees, taking away the fear and sorrow we had felt for hours. In relief, our spirits lifted. We cheered loudly. Surprisingly, Mrs. Ray appeared at the gate instead of Judy, asking why we were shouting. Upon hearing our news, she expressed happiness and promised to share the good news with Sara, who was already in bed, as Mrs. Ray sternly noted. Despite this, we had no plans to sleep for a couple of hours. Instead, we lit a lantern in the granary and enjoyed the apples we had missed eating during the day. We were a cheerful group under the lantern light. Life felt joyful again. Peter recovered quickly once out of danger, but his recovery felt long. Aunt Olivia suggested we write a joint letter to entertain him until he could talk to us from a distance. Excited, we went to the orchard on Saturday to write our letters, inviting Sara Ray to join. I copied these letters in my dream book, treasuring them as memories of that autumn day on the hill."|['1.

"Dear Peter,

We are all relieved to hear that you are recovering. It was quite frightening when we learned of your illness. We all think highly of you and have been saying kind things about you. I promised that if you improved, I would share these thoughts with you. It's easier for me to write them down rather than say them face to face. We believe you are intelligent, polite, helpful, hardworking, and a true gentleman.

Aunt Olivia suggested we send you this letter to lift your spirits. I plan to bake some treats for you now that the doctor says you can enjoy them. I'll even send over my special rosebud plate for you to use, but remember, it's on loan. I treasure it dearly. Take care not to catch a cold as you recover. We hope the measles won't spread to the rest of us. The Story Girl continues to entertain us with her witty remarks, while Felix claims he's losing weight despite indulging in plenty of apples. Beverley is thrilled to have grown half an inch since July, and Cecily has decided to stop curling her hair. Sara Ray is feeling lonely, and Judy mentioned she cries often. I feel sorry for her but also grateful not to be in her shoes. Sara will be writing to you too, and I hope you'll share her letter with me. Remember to take some Mexican Tea as it is known for its blood-purifying properties.

Get well soon!

Warm regards,

I am excited to share that I am going to buy a beautiful dark blue dress for the winter. It is much lovelier than Sara Ray's brown one. Sara Ray's mother doesn't have good taste. The Story Girl's father is sending her a new red dress and a red velvet cap from Paris. She adores red. Personally, I find it common. However, Mother said I could get a velvet hood too. Cecily thinks it's not right to wear velvet when it's expensive and the heathen need the gospel. The Story Girl suggested I sign it 'yours affectionately,' but I know better. I am happy you are recovering, Peter. I regret saying mean things about you. I am thinner from picking apples. The girls are well. We miss you and wish you were here. Looking forward to your return.

"Dear Peter,

I am overjoyed to hear that you are recovering! The days when we feared the worst were truly the hardest. The thought of losing you was unbearable, but the news of your improving health was like a dream come true. We miss you terribly and can't wait for you to join us in all the fun we're having. I convinced Uncle Alec to delay burning his potato stalks until you're well because I know how much you enjoy watching them burn. Pat is doing great, but Aunt Janet won't let him visit to avoid any risk of spreading measles. She's strict but caring. Despite her disapproval of me, I take pride in being like my father. He sent me a lovely letter with beautiful paintings. I can't wait to see his new masterpiece.

I will name the southernwood 'appleringie' from now on. Beverley mentioned that's what they call it in Scotland, and I find it more poetic than southernwood. Felicity suggests its proper name is 'Boy's Love,' but I find that silly. Shadows are such lovely things, Peter. The orchard is filled with them right now. Sometimes they are so still, you'd think they were asleep. Then they start laughing and skipping. In the oat field, they are always chasing each other, wild shadows. The orchard shadows are more tame. Everything seems a bit tired from growing, except for the spruces and chrysanthemums in Aunt Olivia's garden. The sunshine is thick, yellow, and lazy, with crickets singing all day. Most birds have gone, and maple leaves have fallen. Let me share a funny story Uncle Alec told last night about Elder Frewen's grandfather mistaking rope reins for livestock to lead a piano home. Everyone laughed except Aunt Janet, who found it disrespectful. And then there was the tale of old Mark Ward making a drunken speech at a church missionary social. Felicity might be wondering why this letter is so long, so I should probably stop. If your mother reads it to you, there may be parts she doesn't understand, but I believe Aunt Jane would. Peter was overjoyed to receive our letters and insisted on writing back. His letter, carefully disinfected, was delivered to us,|"[""1.

I'm thankful Peg Bowen didn't catch you, Dan. Maybe she bewitched me that night at her place, and that's why I got the measles. I'm grateful Mr. King will wait to harvest the potatoes until I recover, and I appreciate the Story Girl for convincing him. I think she'll uncover Alice's secret. Some parts of her letter were confusing, but the measles can make you slow. Nevertheless, her letter was lovely, and all my friends are wonderful. I'm grateful for their kindness, even though I'm just a hired boy. We celebrated Peter's return with a picnic in the orchard. Sara Ray rejoined us too, and her happiness was touching. The day was beautiful, like a dream of May in November. The air was gentle, the fields golden, and the sky a soft blue. We set up a table with a worn cloth and decorated it with scarlet geraniums and maple leaves. Felicity prepared delicious treats, including a plum cake with a welcoming message for Peter.

It was a joyful gathering. We skipped our dinners to savor Felicity's delicious treats. Paddy, perched on the Pulpit Stone, eyed us with anticipation for his share. Laughter filled the air as we exchanged witty remarks. The old King orchard had never witnessed such a cheerful celebration. Stalks littered the field, providing us the thrill of setting them ablaze. The sight of blazing bonfires and rising smoke was mesmerizing. We danced around the fires, poking them with sticks, sending sparks into the night sky. Exhausted from our play, we perched on the fence, gazing at the dark spruce wood. The starry sky above and the smoky field before us painted a magical scene. The Story Girl shared a chilling tale of William Cowan and the devil's handprints, adding a spooky twist to our enchanting night.|"[""1.

Aunt Olivia carefully revealed the delicate china set that had been a gift from Grandfather King. The Story Girl felt a pang of sadness, imagining the hopes and memories stored away with these cherished items.

Among the items was a soft silk dress, now yellowed with age, and a long white bridal veil with a sweet, old-time perfume. Aunt Olivia shared Rachel's point lace handkerchief and letters from Will Montague, which she insisted on burning unread.
