"""Dinah gave me some cookies,"" said the child excitedly. ""I'm taking them out West with me. Maybe I'll get hungry, lost, or even meet Indians, but then I'll have cookies to eat!"" 

""There will be plenty to eat out West. You might get lost as you always do, but we'll find you. I hope it won't happen too often. I doubt the Indians will carry you off, and if they do, they'll return you quickly.""

The days grew happier as the Bobbsey twins prepared to head West. The day before their journey, Bert and Nan delivered a message to their father's lumberyard office. Mr. Hickson, an old man loading a wagon, inquired about their plans. ""I hope you have a good time out West. Children are happy when they have fun,"" he remarked, reminiscing about his own missing sons, Charley and Bill.

The trunks and bags were stacked on the porch, waiting for Mr. Hickson to take them to the station. The Bobbseys would go in the car later, with a colleague of Mr. Bobbsey driving it back. Sam Johnson, who used to drive their horse, didn't like cars. Snap, the dog, sensed the commotion and stayed close to Bert and Nan.

"As the train arrived at the station, Bert hurried to grab his bag. The other Bobbsey twins gathered their belongings. Flossie fixed her basket where the cat had knocked off the cover.

When Bert, the first of the Bobbsey twins to wake up, peered out of the train window, he couldn't quite tell if he was still dreaming.
