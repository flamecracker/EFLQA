During the winter, Pee-wee would occasionally bring hesitant visitors to the troop-room, an old railroad car by the river, where the scouts would play checkers and read. As spring approached, patrol spirit awakened in the troop. Each patrol, like the Ravens, the Elks, and the Silver Foxes, focused on their camping preparations and unity within their groups.

"""Why are you throwing things at me?"" he asked, stepping down from the fence and walking towards Pee-wee with a threatening expression. Despite this, he made sure to pick up the candy and eat it.

Pee-wee went into Bennett's Fresh Confectionery for a chocolate soda to lift his spirits. He then strolled up Main Street, feeling disappointed as nothing exciting happened on this lonely Saturday morning. He glanced into shop windows and watched a man having car trouble. Eventually, he wandered into the public library, which felt empty and dull. Pee-wee found it strange that no one else was there reading books. The librarian seemed lost in thought, and the history teacher, Miss Bunting, was engrossed in her books. Pee-wee reluctantly picked up a copy of Treasure Island, a book he knew well. Feeling disgruntled, he sat down and started reading about a deserted island. This sparked his imagination, wishing he could be marooned on a desert island like in the seventeenth century, his favorite era known for buried treasure and adventure.|"[""1.

"""That's funny,"" Pee-wee exclaimed, pausing in amazement. ""That wasn't here yesterday because I was down here yesterday. Anyway, as long as no one's here, I'm going to be the one to go and discover it. Findings are keepings; it's just the same with islands as it is with everything else.""

To increase his astonishment and cause his brimming cup of joy to overflow, a tree stood upon the little speck of green land loaded with white blossoms. The fragrant promise wafted to Pee-wee from the enchanted scout upon the distant shore.

Townsend Ripley, known for his quiet demeanor, didn't question Roly Poly about his adventure on the desert island. Instead, he humorously suggested putting a license plate on the moving island to avoid trouble with inspectors. Pee-wee, excited about the island, proposed starting a patrol with Ripley as the leader. He even came up with a plan to use the island for exercise by making it rotate like a treadmill. As Pee-wee prepared to gather supplies for camping, Townsend hinted at a feeling that the island might surprise them. Meanwhile, one boy reassured Pee-wee about his parents, and Pee-wee boasted about scouts' survival skills. Ultimately, Pee-wee decided to take a boy to show his mother the island was inhabited, while others paddled back up the river. Townsend remained on the island, waiting with a whimsical air for any potential calls for help.|"[""1. Why didn't Townsend Ripley question Roly Poly about his adventure on the desert island?\nA.

""I'm all about the discoverer,"" said Townsend. ""I'll follow wherever he leads. Life without the discoverer wouldn't be worth it.

The discoverer's voice echoed over the sunlit water, excited about making hunter's stew and having an extended Easter break. Laden with treasures from the attic, including bananas and inventive ideas, he proudly displayed a discarded police traffic sign. Pee-wee, holding a half-eaten banana, resembled Columbus planting a flag. His acquisitions included a variety of items, from a phonograph horn to canned goods. He pondered forming a scout patrol, debating names like Alligators or Turtles, while discussing the erosion of land in water. Concerned about the island's stability, he questioned recruiting new members without a solid foundation. The group faced the possibility of being in the water without land.

Pee-wee argued passionately, questioning his friend's knowledge of geography using an ice cream soda analogy. He emphasized that just like the ice cream chunk in the soda, the island wouldn't corrode or erode. Despite the logical flaw in his argument, Pee-wee stood by his belief that the island was solid and resistant. He credited a sardine sandwich for his discovery of the island's mysterious secret and held a special affection for sardine sandwiches ever since. While eating a banana and holding a traffic sign, Pee-wee's decision to accept the sandwich marked a significant moment in scout history. His quick thinking to use the traffic sign as a makeshift flag added a humorous touch to the situation.|"[""1.

Billy swiftly lifted and lowered the traffic sign's bar, hearing a hollow sound. Inspired by Columbus, Townsend dug near the sign, revealing muddy wood. Roly Poly tapped it, confirming its size. Pee-wee probed elsewhere, finding more wood. They named it Apple-pie Island, realizing it was boxed in by heavy timbers. Ownership became complex. Old Trimmer's land was now an island. Townsend suggested starting a fire for hunter's stew. Suddenly, a mysterious voyager approached, known for his stinginess. Old Trimmer never shared anything, not even a match. He was so frugal that he avoided using his watch and spectacles excessively. His words were scarce and unpleasant.|"['1.

"""This land used to be yours before it became an island,"" Pee-wee diplomatically stated. ""It may seem funny that it was once your apple tree and all. But it broke away, fell down, and now it's an island that we discovered. It can never be a peninsula again, that's for sure. Islands are found, then you own them, that's how it goes.

""Hey, young feller, no talking back,"" old Trimmer said testily. ""Come on, move quickly. I'm taking this whole thing back to where it belongs. Do you want me to drop you off ashore or not?""

""I don't think we have a say in this, Mr. Trimmer,"" said Townsend. ""The land that was once part of your field seems to be on a barge or something, and we're on that land on the barge. We're here because we're here.""

Pee-wee interrupted, ""This is a river, right? It's an inland waterway, belonging to the government. The barge, or whatever it is, is on it, with something that used to be a peninsula but isn't anymore. We're on that former peninsula.""

""That's exactly what I was going to say,"" Pee-wee continued, ""and you can't kick us off this land. If that's trespassing, then the land is trespassing too. It's trespassing on the barge"|"['1.

"""It's like a legal situation,"" explained Townsend, leaning against the tree and speaking calmly. ""We have the same right on the scow as the land does. The scow belongs to the dredging company,"" Pee-wee chimed in. ""We're not trespassing; your land is in the way."" Townsend suggested removing the land to access the scow, cautioning against tampering with it. Pee-wee, holding a traffic sign, declared possession of the scow in the name of their patrol.

Townsend Ripley and Mr. Trimmer were discussing what to do with a property, specifically an old scow that Mr. Trimmer wanted. Townsend cleverly hinted that the boys might contact the steam dredge people about it. Despite Mr. Trimmer's initial reluctance, he eventually gave in, realizing that the boys were serious about the property. The boys, led by Pee-wee, decided to write a letter to the dredging company to ask permission to use the scow. Pee-wee even suggested using bark and homemade ink for the letter, adding a wild and uncivilized touch to their request.

Their minds now clear about their rights, the group relaxed under the tree as the afternoon sun faded, enjoying the odd meal Pee-wee cooked over the rough fireplace. While Pee-wee admitted he was better at eating than cooking, the makeshift island provided a safe and peaceful setting. Grasshoppers hopped around, robins chirped in the tree, and beetles roamed freely. Dandelions and violets added color to the grass, enhancing the island's rugged beauty. As they finished their meal, the island drifted upstream with the tide, finally settling on a reef. Meanwhile, back in town, the Silver Fox Patrol and other groups discussed plans for a lawn party. Roy's humorous remarks lightened the mood, and they decided to have a simple supper before heading to the party together in their scout uniforms.|"['1.

Roy mentioned that at the lawn party, they would likely have roast turkey. However, Warde Hollister, a thoughtful boy, expressed concern about the menu, fearing they might end up with salted almonds.

Under Minerva's guidance, the boys securely anchored the island about six feet from the shore. A gangplank added a touch of romance and prevented it from drifting closer, while clothes poles anchored it against the ebbing tide. Pee-wee's clothesline provided extra support, connecting an apple tree to the rhododendron bushes. The island, freed from the mundane shore, became a picturesque sight with a tent and Japanese lanterns casting a soft glow. Lanterns adorned the scaffold, transformed for the occasion with colorful decorations. As the party unfolded, Pee-wee, crowned with a chef's cap, kept watch over the food, waiting for his moment to indulge. Undisturbed on the island, he pondered a plan to lure elusive eels with a long stick.|"['1.

Understanding the strategic placement of objects is crucial. In this tale, a fishing rod's positioning near an island was key. The poles anchored the island, preventing it from drifting. A makeshift gang-plank and ropes secured the island. However, a mishap occurred when a brick was unknowingly removed, causing the island to drift away. Despite his innocence, Pee-wee unintentionally created chaos by tugging on a pole, leading to the island's displacement. The island, laden with food, floated down the river as a comet-like tail of bushes followed. Thunder added to the dramatic scene. Even the man in the moon seemed amused by the unfolding events. The story serves as a reminder of the importance of careful planning and understanding the consequences of our actions.|"[""1.

The group rushed to the shore in a hurry, some heading to the barn for a skiff and a canoe. Doc Carson suggested reaching the island before the person there started something, believing fair play would mean a ten o'clock start. The skiff was quickly launched with Roy, Warde, and Townsend as the crew. Warde, rowing vigorously, complained of hunger, joking about eating anything in sight. Roy teased about the consequences of eating hunter's stew. The passage describes the unique tide in the river, explaining why it flows faster as it recedes due to narrowing confines. The Isle of Desserts was stranded due to the rapid tide, making it impossible to reach without an airplane. The safe isolation would last a couple of hours until the water returned.|"[""1.

Pee-wee exclaimed that the ice cream was melting, and he debated whether to eat it before it was too late. Suddenly, Dashway Speeder's boat arrived with guests from a party. They saw Scout Harris enjoying a feast on a grocery box. As they watched, Scout Harris contemplated eating the chicken salad and sandwiches before they spoiled. Minerva, resigned, agreed that he should eat the melting ice cream. Meanwhile, Keekie Joe, sitting on old Ford radiators, untangled a fishing-line contraption to trip people in Barrel Alley.

Around nine o'clock, Keekie Joe felt hungry and realized he had only four cigarettes left before reaching home. He weighed the punishment for being late against the meal he might receive and opted to go fishing instead. Unsure how to cook fish, he gathered worms, prepared his makeshift fishing hook, and headed to the river. Near the water, a dilapidated shanty caught his eye, possibly holding some forgotten food. However, upon inspection, it was empty, except for dusty spider-webs and abandoned fishing nets. Despite his hunger, fatigue overtook Keekie Joe as his eyes struggled to stay open. As he rested on the net, he gazed at the moon, feeling as though it winked at him, hinting at something. Exhausted, he drifted into a peculiar dream involving oversized candy and a mysterious boy throwing sponge cake.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat did Keekie Joe opt to do instead of going home when he felt hungry?\nA) Go to a restaurant\nB) Go fishing\nC) Go to a friend's house\nD) Go to a grocery store\nE) Go to a park"", 'Question 2:\nWhat did Keekie Joe find near the river that caught his eye?\nA) A bakery\nB) A grocery store\nC) A dilapidated shanty\nD) A restaurant\nE) A park', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Keekie Joe find inside the dilapidated shanty?\nA) Forgotten food\nB) Dusty spider-webs and abandoned fishing nets\nC) Oversized candy\nD) Sponge cake\nE) A mysterious boy', 'Question 4:\nWhat did Keekie Joe see the moon doing as he rested near the river?\nA) Smiling at him\nB) Laughing at him\nC) Winking at him\nD) Dancing\nE) Singing', 'Question 5:\nWhat did Keekie Joe dream about after resting near the river?\nA) Going home\nB) Going fishing\nC) Oversized candy and a mysterious boy throwing sponge cake\nD) Dusty spider-webs\nE) Abandoned fishing nets', 'Question 6:\nWhat overtook Keekie Joe as he rested near the river?\nA) Hunger\nB) Thirst\nC) Fatigue\nD) Excitement\nE) Joy']"|['B) Go fishing', 'C) A dilapidated shanty', 'B) Dusty spider-webs and abandoned fishing nets', 'C) Winking at him', 'C) Oversized candy and a mysterious boy throwing sponge cake', 'C) Fatigue']
The peculiar boy, unafraid and impolite, flung a pumpkin pie at Keekie Joe, taunting him. Then, like a mischievous sprite, he sprayed powdered sugar at him, blinding Keekie Joe. Startled, Keekie Joe saw a light in the distance. As he approached, he saw a surprising sight - a grassy plot with a tree and a tent. The rich boy from earlier sat amidst hundreds of sandwiches on an overturned ice cream freezer. The scene was a chaotic mess of cakes, doughnuts, and other treats.

Keekie Joe was fortunate that Townsend Ripley became the leader of the new patrol. Pee-wee lost the election for camp cook, thanks to Townsend changing the traffic sign to STOP. Townsend's safety-first attitude won over the camp. On Sunday, Townsend and Keekie Joe visited Keekie Joe's family in Barrel Alley, where Townsend's persuasive talk convinced Keekie Joe's father to allow him to return to the island for a week.

At low tide, the shallow water rippled around the island. But at high tide, the reef hid beneath the deep sea, revealing the island's wild beauty for a few hours each day. From the mainland, dandelions dotted the coast, and sleepy turtles could be seen basking in the sun. The only remnants of Minerva Skybrow's party were an empty refreshment board and a makeshift table turned into benches. Our hero, with Brownie and Billy, paraded with placards on Main Street. Rain kept them in their tent on Friday night, and Saturday dawned with rain. They watched raindrops create holes in the mud, while killies sought shelter.

Pee-wee greeted him like an ambassador. Pee-wee was so focused on his venture that he forgot about the races, seeing the island only as a turning point.

The island race turned into a hilarious chaos, with the Alligator Patrol members in fits of laughter as they teetered on the edge. Amid the uproar, one hero stood tall, urging the racers on as they struggled to navigate the unexpected high tide. Despite the absurdity, the onlookers found it all thrilling, with one barely able to contain his amusement.

The departing island, led by the spirited Pee-wee, egged on the racers, claiming the race was like shooting a bird on the wing.

"Pee-wee excitedly announced, ""We won the race! Even though we weren't officially in it, we won anyway. That guy in the boat messed it up. It was a chase and a race combined - a chase race that I came up with, and he spoiled it all."" As the island drifted away, Pee-wee assured the group they wouldn't go hungry, promising a hunter's stew by supper time. Other boats approached the vanished turning point, confused by the disappearance. Pee-wee offered free transportation and a meal if they didn't reach shore by evening. Despite the disruption, Pee-wee felt they deserved the silver cup. He confidently claimed he could navigate them to safety, using nature's signs. Brownie hesitated, but Townsend supported Pee-wee's plan, knowing it was better to follow Pee-wee's lead to avoid getting lost."|"['1.

Townsend advised the group not to rush back and enjoy the woods while they waited for the Discoverer. They tied the island to a tree and planned to play a game. After securing the island, they decided to prepare supper before it got too late. Townsend always involved Keekie Joe in decision-making, treating him as an equal. Joe admired Townsend for his friendship and guidance. Through their camping adventures, Joe's perspective changed, and he no longer found joy in his old hoodlum games. Townsend's influence even made Joe lose interest in playing craps. As they sat around the fire eating spaghetti, Townsend joked about not missing hunter's stew. The group discussed the impact of their camping trip on Joe, showing the positive changes in him. Townsend humorously mentioned not wanting to drift in any form, reflecting on their memorable vacation.|"['1.

Keekie Joe surprised his friends with a remark that showed the effects of his week's outing.

Keekie Joe, who lacked the material possessions of his friends, revealed a newfound sense of pride by mentioning his mother. This simple act of acknowledging his mother, despite his past disregard for her wishes, displayed his desire to boast about having someone interested in his well-being. Townsend commended Joe for his gesture and encouraged him to follow his mother's instructions until they met again.

"""There you are,"" said Townsend. ""What more do you want? We're all going to school because the school won't come to us.

On Sunday night, they settled in for their final night on the island. Despite its quirks, they still held affection for the island. The only complaint they had was its constant motion. Although small and lacking romantic charm, it felt like the heart of a vast empire during the past week. Leaving it was bittersweet. The Alligator Patrol had been established, unstoppable like the island itself.

The night was cold, prompting them to sleep in the tent. Their slumber was so deep that they didn't hear a boat approaching after midnight. The boat carried Slats Corbett and his companions, who had heard of Joe's adventures. Slats, respecting Townsend's authority, quietly untied the island before leaving. The next morning, Keekie Joe, feeling nervous yet excited, woke early, eager to start the school week."|['1.

Keekie Joe was surprised to find the island drifting downstream on the ebbing tide, stuck on Waring's reef. As he gazed around, he noticed the tent where his friends slept peacefully. The island had moved about a mile downstream from its original spot. Looking further down the river, Keekie Joe saw the boat-house glinting in the morning light. The scene was serene, with birds chirping and a joyful fish splashing in the water. Keekie Joe realized that the _Alligator_ boat was upstream, under a willow tree. Concerned about getting to school without wet clothes, he pondered how they would manage. Not being able to tell time without a watch, he decided to sneak into the tent to check Townsend's watch.|"['1.
