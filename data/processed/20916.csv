Aladdin, now rich from his adventures, hurried back through the three halls to meet his uncle, the African magician.

Aladdin waited patiently for the three months to pass, as agreed with the sultan for his marriage to Princess Badroulboudour. When the time was up, he sent his mother to remind the sultan of his promise. The widow went to the palace and stood in the audience hall where the sultan recognized her from before. The sultan, realizing the situation, interrupted his vizier and asked to hear the widow out. She reminded the sultan of his promise on behalf of Aladdin. The sultan, hesitant about the marriage, consulted his vizier, who suggested setting an impossibly high price for the princess to deter Aladdin.

After a short while, the genie came back with forty black slaves, each carrying a heavy tray filled with precious stones like pearls, diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.

Once there was a powerful king of the sea with a beautiful daughter who worshipped a red carnelian idol. When Solomon, a prophet of God, asked for her hand in marriage and to abandon the idol, the king refused. He sought advice from his viziers who urged him to consult the idol for guidance. The idol advised him to fight Solomon. Confident in the idol's counsel, the king prepared for war. Solomon, undeterred, gathered a vast army of genies, men, and creatures. He surrounded the king's island, demanding surrender. The king, unwilling to comply, mustered his own forces, including genies and devils.

When they returned to their troops, Emeer Moosa and his officers pondered ways to enter the city to witness its marvels. Talib proposed building a ladder to scale the city walls.

They continued their journey and came upon a grand hall made of gleaming marble and adorned with precious jewels. The floor appeared as if it was flowing water, making it seem slippery to walk on. To ensure safe passage, Emeer Moosa instructed Sheikh Abd-Es-Samad to place something on the floor for them to walk on. Inside, they discovered a magnificent dome crafted from stones covered in red gold, unlike anything they had ever seen. At the center of the dome stood a structure made of alabaster, surrounded by ornate lattice windows studded with emeralds that even kings couldn't obtain. Within the structure was a pavilion of brocade supported by columns of red gold. Inside the pavilion were birds with emerald feet perched above a fountain covered with a net of radiant pearls. Nearby, a couch adorned with pearls, jewels, and jacinths held a damsel of unparalleled beauty. The damsel, dressed in a garment of brilliant pearls and a crown of red gold, appeared lifelike with eyes that seemed to sparkle, although she was not alive. Talib explained that she had been skillfully embalmed, her eyes replaced with quicksilver to give the illusion of movement. The couch also held two slaves, one white and one black, each holding a weapon. An inscription on a tablet of gold revealed the story of Tedmur, the daughter of the King of the Amalekites, who faced a severe drought leading to their demise|['1.

The Emeer Moosa, upon hearing this, wept again and was deeply moved by what he saw. Turning to his companions, he instructed them to bring sacks and fill them with some of the treasures, vessels, rarities, and jewels. Talib, son of Sahl, suggested leaving the damsel with her belongings, as they were unmatched in value and could serve as a valuable gift to the Prince of the Faithful. However, the Emeer Moosa, respecting the damsel's wishes inscribed on a tablet, refused, stating they were not treacherous. The Vizier Talib argued that leaving the riches with the deceased was pointless, but as he approached the steps, he was attacked by the slaves and killed. The Emeer Moosa lamented his greed and ordered the troops to load camels with some of the riches. They journeyed along the coast until they encountered a mountain with caves inhabited by black-skinned people. The Emeer Moosa and his party were welcomed by the king of the blacks, who spoke Arabic. The king assisted them in retrieving brass bottles from the sea containing trapped devils from Solomon's time. Delighted, Emeer Moosa gifted the king, who reciprocated with wonders from the sea.|['1.

When Ali Baba returned home, he secured the gates and brought the bags of money to his wife. She suspected theft, but he assured her he was no robber.

Ali Baba realized that Cassim had discovered the thieves' secret hideout due to his wife's mistake. Without showing concern, Ali Baba confessed, revealed the location, and offered to share his treasure. Cassim, feeling entitled, demanded to know the exact spot and threatened to expose Ali Baba if he didn't comply. Cassim, driven by greed, set out the next day to claim the treasure for himself. However, upon reaching the cave, he forgot the magical words to open the door. The robbers, returning to the cave, found Cassim's mules and attacked him. In a struggle, Cassim lost his life. The robbers, puzzled by how Cassim entered, decided to dismember his body to deter intruders. Cassim's wife, worried, sought Ali Baba's help when her husband didn't return.

Ali Baba's wife, concerned about her husband's secret business, was easily convinced by her brother-in-law. She returned home and waited until midnight, regretting her curiosity. In the morning, she tearfully explained to Ali Baba and his wife why she came. Ali Baba, without being asked, went to find his missing brother. He discovered Cassim's body and decided to bury it discreetly. Ali Baba loaded his asses with gold from the cave, covering Cassim's remains with wood. He returned home, leaving his wife to unload the gold. Ali Baba then visited his sister-in-law's house with one of the asses. Morgiana, a clever slave, helped Ali Baba with the burial plan. Ali Baba requested secrecy and explained the situation to his sister-in-law. She accepted his proposal of marriage and comfort.

Morgiana, a clever slave, convinced Baba Mustapha to help her without revealing the true reason. She blindfolded him and led him to sew the quarters of a corpse together, promising gold for his work. After he finished, she paid him and ensured his secrecy. Morgiana then prepared the body for burial with Ali Baba's help. They tricked everyone into thinking the death was natural. Meanwhile, the forty robbers discovered their stolen gold and Cassim's missing body. The captain sent a robber to investigate, risking his life if he failed.

Baba Mustapha, an old man with sharp eyes, was approached by a robber seeking information. The robber offered gold in exchange for directions to a certain house. Baba Mustapha, tempted by the gold, agreed to lead the robber blindfolded. As they walked, Baba Mustapha unknowingly guided the robber to Ali Baba's house. The robber marked the door with chalk and left. Morgiana, Ali Baba's servant, noticed the mark and realized it was a sign of danger. She marked other doors in the same way to protect her master. The robber, convinced of his success, returned to the forest. Morgiana's quick thinking helped prevent a potential threat to Ali Baba's household.|"['1.

In the meantime, the thief returned to his group in the woods and shared his successful story. The robbers were pleased with the news. The captain praised the thief's efforts and suggested a plan. They armed themselves and decided to meet at the town's main square without raising suspicion. The captain and the thief who brought the news would locate the target house. They split into pairs, entering the town discreetly. However, the plan failed as they couldn't identify the correct house. The captain decided to return to their hideout. The group blamed the guide for the mistake and he accepted his punishment. The captain then took charge of the mission, successfully identifying the house. They prepared for revenge by disguising themselves as oil merchants and hiding in jars. The captain approached Ali Baba's house seeking shelter for the night.

"The captain moved from the stable to issue orders to his crew. He instructed each man to cut open a jar once he threw stones from his chamber window. Morgiana, following Ali Baba's instructions, prepared his bath linens. When the lamp went out, she sought oil in the yard. A robber in a jar asked if it was time, but Morgiana kept her cool and replied, ""Not yet."" She discovered the robbers, and with quick thinking, filled a kettle with boiling oil and stifled them.

Ali Baba carefully inspected all the jars, and when he reached the one with the oil, he noticed a significant decrease. He stood there in astonishment, gazing at the jars and then at Morgiana, speechless. After composing himself, he inquired about the missing merchant. Morgiana revealed that the merchant was no different from her and proceeded to explain the merchant's fate. She suggested discussing the matter in Ali Baba's chamber while she prepared his broth after his bath. Later, as Ali Baba listened to the detailed account, he realized the danger posed by the chalk marks on the doors. Morgiana warned of a plot by the forest robbers and pledged to protect him. Impressed by her loyalty, Ali Baba granted her freedom and vowed to reward her. Together, they buried the robbers discreetly in Ali Baba's garden.

The captain, now pretending to be a merchant, moved various luxurious fabrics and linens from the cavern to his place, taking care to hide the source. He rented a warehouse opposite Cassim's, where Ali Baba's son resided. Introducing himself as Khaujeh Houssain, he befriended the merchants. When Ali Baba visited his son, Khaujeh Houssain learned his identity, showering him with gifts and invitations. Ali Baba's son, feeling indebted, sought his father's help to reciprocate. Ali Baba suggested a casual meeting on Friday. The next day, Ali Baba's son and Khaujeh Houssain passed by Ali Baba's home. Khaujeh Houssain hesitated but was ushered in.

Morgiana followed the orders, though she was hesitant and curious about the man who refused to eat salt. After finishing her kitchen duties, she assisted Abdoollah in carrying the dishes. Upon seeing Khaujeh Houssain, she recognized him as the robber captain and noticed a dagger concealed under his clothes. Understanding his wicked intentions, she decided to act. Morgiana cleverly disguised herself as a dancer, armed with a dagger, and performed a captivating dance. As she approached Khaujeh Houssain with the tambourine for a donation, she swiftly stabbed him, revealing his true identity as the enemy.

After the grand nuptials of Ali Baba's son and Morgiana, celebrated with a lavish feast and joyous festivities, Ali Baba refrained from visiting the robbers' cave again. He had kept away since disposing of the thirty-seven robbers and their leader, fearing the two missing members might still be alive. A year later, feeling secure, Ali Baba revisited the cave, finding it undisturbed. Convinced of his sole knowledge of the cave's secret, he filled his bags with gold. Passing the secret to his son, they lived in prosperity, using the fortune wisely. In another land, the sultan of Harran, longing for an heir, received a prophecy of a son after eating pomegranate seeds. His wife, Pirouzè, bore a son named Codadad, who, seeking glory and adventure, set off to offer his services to his father in Harran, eager to prove his valor in battle.|"[""1.

A young prince named Codadad arrived at Harran in a grand outfit, offering his service to the sultan. Impressed by his beauty and skills, the sultan appointed him in the army, making him a favorite at court. This sparked jealousy among the sultan's sons who plotted against Codadad. They tricked him into granting them permission to hunt, but instead, they disappeared. When the sultan inquired about his sons, Codadad, feeling responsible, set out to find them. Despite his efforts, he couldn't locate them, causing the sultan to grow angry and threaten Codadad's life if he didn't bring back his sons.

Approaching, he saw a beautiful lady at a window, distressed and warning him of a bloodthirsty black monster residing there. She revealed herself as a lady from Grand Cairo captured by the black. As the monster returned, Codadad bravely faced him, injuring him severely in combat. With a swift blow, Codadad defeated the black and rescued the lady.

Codadad and his brothers asked the princess to share her story. She began by telling them about her life in the city of Deryabar. The princess, an only child, was not initially welcomed by her father, the sultan, who had hoped for a son. Despite this, she was educated to rule in case she needed to take over from her father. At court, there was a young man whom the sultan favored, and many believed he would marry the princess. However, when he asked for her hand and was refused, he plotted against the sultan. The princess's father was killed, and the young man took over the kingdom. The princess was rescued by the grand vizier and fled on a ship, but a storm wrecked the vessel.

I thanked the young sultan for his kindness and accepted his offer. I shared my hardships with him, and he expressed deep concern for my misfortunes. The prince then took me to his palace to meet his mother, the queen, who also showed great sympathy. Although the sultan fell in love with me and proposed, my mind was preoccupied with my troubles. Despite this, out of gratitude, I accepted his proposal, and we had a grand wedding. However, during the celebrations, a rival prince attacked, causing chaos. We narrowly escaped and found ourselves on a fishing boat. After days adrift, we were captured by pirates. They fought over me until only one remained. He decided to take me to Grand Cairo but threw the sultan into the sea. I was bound and taken to a town, then to this castle.

Once the princess narrated her ordeals, Codadad expressed his sympathy for her troubles. He proposed a safe haven in the court of the Sultan of Harran, where his sons welcomed her. Codadad then offered to marry her in front of all the princes present. The princess agreed, and they wed on the same day in the castle. They feasted heartily before setting off towards Harran. On the journey, Codadad revealed his true identity as their brother. However, fueled by jealousy, the princes conspired to kill Codadad. They attacked him while he slept, leaving him for dead with the princess. Unaware of this treachery, the Sultan welcomed his sons back.

The doctor's advice deeply impacted the princess, who shared her story with him. He encouraged her to seek justice for her late husband by appealing to the Sultan of Harran. The surgeon offered to accompany her, and they set off on camels to Harran. Upon arrival, they learned of the disappearance of the Sultan's son, Codadad. The surgeon suggested the princess meet with Pirouzè, Codadad's mother, but with caution to avoid alerting the other princes. The surgeon went ahead to assess the situation and observed Pirouzè's arrival at a mosque. He gained access to her and shared the truth about Codadad.

After the surgeon left, Pirouzè stayed on the sofa, deeply upset about Codadad's fate. She wept, mourning her son's loss and lamenting that she would never see him again. Her attendants joined her in tears. The sultan entered, concerned about the news. Pirouzè sadly informed him that Codadad was dead, likely devoured by wild beasts. Enraged, the sultan vowed to punish Codadad's treacherous brothers. He immediately ordered his vizier to arrest his sons and imprison them. The court was shocked by the sultan's anger. Later, the sultan arranged for Codadad's widow, the princess of Deryabar, to be escorted to the palace with great honor. The city rejoiced, unaware of the tragic events.

After voyaging to various islands and encountering extraordinary creatures, I found myself shipwrecked on an island inhabited by cannibalistic negroes.

After being informed of the situation, I was taken to the ship and greeted warmly by the captain. We set sail and after a few days, we reached the harbor of a bustling city. A kind merchant who had befriended me invited me to join him and introduced me to a group of locals who gathered cocoa-nuts. He provided me with provisions for the journey and instructed me to follow the locals closely to ensure my safety. Together, we ventured into a dense forest of tall cocoa trees where we encountered a troop of agile apes. The merchants and I collected cocoa-nuts by provoking the apes with stones, prompting them to throw the nuts at us in retaliation. We filled our bags with the cocoa-nuts using this strategy and returned to the city.
