Foster thanked the captain and tried to chat about his hunger, but the captain was not interested. The captain abruptly pointed down the skylight, signaling Foster to go below. Foster found a simple meal of sea-biscuits and water, which he enjoyed due to his Spartan-like approach to food. While eating, he heard commotion on deck and saw Peter the Great grab weapons. Foster tried to follow but was locked in the cabin. Gunfire erupted as pirates boarded a Russian merchant ship nearby. The crew was wounded, and passengers, including a noble-looking girl, were taken captive. Foster wanted to console them but hesitated on the language to use.

When Foster reached the front of the ship, he saw some crew members trying to bandage each other's wounds, but they seemed inexperienced. Foster, although not a surgeon, had a brother who was one. He had learned a lot about treating injuries from his brother. Seeing the pirates struggling with a simple task, Foster confidently took over. Initially, the men were hesitant, but they soon realized Foster's skill and let him help. Later, a man named Peter the Great ordered Foster into a dark hold where wounded men lay. Foster spent the night and the next day there, with little food. Peter the Great pushed Foster into a dark hole, where he discovered a lifeless body. Foster tried to alert the crew outside, but they ignored him. Fearing they might think he was scared, Foster decided to stay silent.|"[""1.

Peter, a young man on a pirate ship, explains to Foster that he only belongs to the crew for this voyage and usually serves Hassan, a stubborn man from the countryside. The captain interrupts, demanding to know why the negro and the prisoners are delayed. The prisoners are lined up between the cabin and the mast, most with loosely tied hands. The ship approaches a pirate city with a crowded harbour and strong walls armed with cannons. The city, despite its Islamic influence, thrives on robbery and violence. As the vessel enters the harbour, it is boarded by officers in traditional attire. Foster, feeling rebellious, is given an order by a Moor, which he obeys reluctantly, aware of the armed Arabs backing the Moor.|"['1.

George Foster, a poor midshipman, anxiously looked for his friend, Peter the Great, but he was nowhere in sight. Reluctantly, he boarded the boat with tied hands, not caring if he risked his life. As the band marched through a grand gateway, Foster felt like he was entering a dark world. Yet, his hope flickered. The bustling streets with diverse Eastern characters fascinated him. The narrow streets teemed with people in colorful attire, donkeys carrying loads, and camels passing by. Eventually, the captives arrived at a prison called the Bagnio, a grim place where they spent their nights. Foster, seated on the cold floor, observed the captives eating meager bread. The next morning, waking up stiff and sore, he realized the harsh reality of his situation.

Foster was left in solitude, pondering the grim reality of his imprisonment. The Frenchman's words lingered in his mind, warning him to abandon hope of reuniting with his loved ones. Witnessing the fate of a fellow prisoner, Foster's heart swelled with compassion, rejecting the notion of brutal conquest. The clinking of keys signaled the resumption of slave labor, but Foster was spared, left to contemplate his fate. Hunger gnawed at him, prompting him to consume the meager rations of black bread.

By now, our young hero had learned the importance of obedience. He followed his guide to a bustling square with a mosque. The market there was simple yet bustling, with traders selling various items on small patches of pavement. Amidst the groups, he noticed an old man with a basket of goods. As they moved through narrow lanes lined with shops, they reached a guarded door leading to a court. Inside, a man was being punished, and Foster was brought before a judge. Despite his disheveled appearance, he truthfully shared his story. The judge and interpreter conferred before instructing two men to bind Foster. This sudden turn of events reminded him of the consequences of rebellion. Eventually, a Moor purchased one of the captives. As Foster observed the scene, a young man carrying live fowls caught his attention, shedding light on the local trade practices.|"['1. What did Foster learn the importance of?\nA. Bravery\nB.

Foster felt a sense of despair as he realized the cruelty around him. Suddenly, a familiar voice broke through the chaos, bringing him unexpected joy. It was his black friend, who, without hesitation, guided Foster towards safety. However, the friend's demeanor quickly changed, and he lashed out at Foster, accusing him of staring. Despite Foster's silence, he received a harsh slap from his friend, causing laughter among the onlookers. Foster managed to control his anger, knowing that retaliation would only lead to trouble. The interaction between Peter the Great and his owner was peculiar, with each speaking a different language. The sailor, showing disdain, made it clear he was not a gardener but a seafarer. The black friend urged his master to buy the sailor, praising his skills, but the owner remained unmoved. Peter, intentionally mistaking Foster for a lazy man, redirected attention to another captive, highlighting his qualities instead.|"['1. What caused Foster to feel a sense of despair initially?\nA.

Peter, a black slave, suggests to his friend Foster that a thin man they saw would be suitable for their master, Ben-Ahmed. Foster, feeling resigned to his fate, acknowledges Peter's cunning ability to deceive. As they approach the city gate, Peter explains the grim purpose of iron hooks on the walls. Once outside, they enjoy the view of the Mediterranean and Mustapha suburb. The Moor leads them to a house surrounded by lush gardens. Ben-Ahmed, their master, is strict but not cruel. He smokes a hookah in the courtyard, filled with orange trees and a fountain. The setting is serene, with flowers scenting the air, creating a luxurious atmosphere.|"['1.

Ben-Ahmed's next action, after lighting his pipe, was to call for Peter the Great and his new servant. The Moor had a peculiar way of not speaking English, even though he seemed to understand it. Through Peter, he asked about our hero's name, age, and occupation. He then instructed Peter to convey to Foster that escaping from the country was not an option. Any attempt would result in severe punishment, including flogging and torture. The Moor offered a deal: if Foster, as a gentleman, promised not to escape, he would be given certain freedoms like working in the garden without chains. Foster, feeling trapped, agreed to the terms. Peter then provided Foster with new clothes and observed him working hard. Despite his physical strength, Foster struggled with the mental burden of his situation.

After a few minutes, Ben-Ahmed fell asleep, and a change in the young people's expressions was noticeable. Hester looked intelligent, Foster seemed puzzled, and the little maid appeared anxious and uncertain. Foster tried to communicate with Hester using gestures, but she didn't understand. The maid's composure returned as the painter inspected his work. The middy seized the chance to throw a note to Hester, but it turned out to be blank. Hester caught on to Foster's signal to write on the paper. When the Moor interrupted and dismissed them, Hester hid the paper. Foster observed her actions closely and retrieved the paper discreetly. He left the room, pondering how to save her, and then went to find his friend Peter the Great.|"[""1.

A man named Foster urgently approached his friend, Peter, who was fixing a rake. He explained a troubling situation involving a woman named Hester. Initially, Peter listened with a smile, but upon reading a note, his expression changed. The note revealed that Hester was in danger and needed to be saved that night. Foster insisted they act, even if it meant risking their lives. Peter, devising a plan, instructed Foster to trust him completely. He emphasized the need for secrecy and warned Foster of potential consequences. Later, Peter met with a woman named Dinah in a dim coffee house, instructing her to act swiftly to save someone. Peter stressed the importance of discretion and urged Dinah to keep their conversation confidential.|[]|[]
"""Dinah, you're a kind woman,"" said her brother as he prepared to leave. ""This is the most important task we've had since we were taken by pirates from the same ship. The Lord has been good to us, giving us good masters now. Follow me quickly,"" he urged. Dinah, being warm-hearted and sympathetic, wasted no time. She arrived at Ben-Ahmed's villa half an hour after her brother with groceries and provisions. Peter arranged for a young girl in the house to receive the basket, and Dinah made sure she returned with a bouquet for an English girl in the harem. Inside was a note from Peter.

"Sally was a peculiar figure, almost like a shadow of a person, with few positive traits. Although not unkind or sulky, she was mostly silent, working tirelessly in a pit in the floor, pounding coffee beans with a heavy iron pestle.

Hester, accompanied by Sally, bravely navigated the town's twists and turns. Initially, fear gripped her, imagining that everyone could see through her disguise. But as time passed unnoticed, her courage resurfaced. She started observing the people and things around her. Meanwhile, Osman's son, Osman, enraged by Hester's escape, interrogated Peter the Great. Peter humbly denied any knowledge of her escape, insisting he was with other slaves in the kitchen. Osman, unconvinced, heated an iron poker in a brazier. As the iron turned red-hot, the room grew tense. Osman then pressed the scorching iron onto Peter's back, causing excruciating pain.

In a sudden commotion, the midshipman found himself in a scuffle with two sailors. The scuffle turned physical, resulting in one sailor sporting a black eye and the other a bloody nose due to the midshipman's unfamiliarity with fist fighting. Osman, in a fit of rage, used a cane to strike the midshipman's feet, introducing him to the painful punishment known as the bastinado. The intense pain surprised the midshipman, causing him to retaliate by biting one sailor's leg and grabbing the trousers of another. A chaotic tussle ensued, culminating in Peter the Great attempting to intervene before Ben-Ahmed, Osman's father, arrived to quell the disturbance. Despite the chaotic encounter, the midshipman, Foster, and Peter discussed the incident, with Foster expressing gratitude for the interruption. Peter, aware of the impending search for a missing girl named Hester, urged them to focus on finding her, as Ben-Ahmed was determined to locate her without alerting the Dey. Meanwhile, Hester, under the alias Georgiana, grew comfortable in her new environment, forming a bond with her newfound friends.

Peter was worried about Hester trying to find her father and possibly staying with him. He suggested finding her father too. Mrs. Lilly cleverly distracted Ali to help Peter. Ali was to guide Peter to Hester's father at the Kasba. Hester was found lying unconscious on coffee beans, holding a pestle. Peter carried her to safety. Hester was placed with Dinah, who lived on the top floor of the coffee-house. Youssef, the owner, allowed them to stay there as he was unable to climb up due to old age.

In a cozy rooftop hut, Hester found solace. The small, clean room, with a trestle bed and a sunlit window, was her new haven. From the window, she glimpsed a breathtaking view of domes, minarets, and the sea. Despite her gratitude, Hester couldn't forget her father and prayed for his safety. One day, Peter the Great arrived with news of her father. Meanwhile, the faithful creature, Ben-Ahmed, missed his mistress and bonded with Peter. When questioned about Hester's whereabouts, Peter remained resolute, refusing to betray her. Ben-Ahmed, sensing Peter's love for Hester, was surprised but respected his determination to help her escape.

George Foster was halfway to town before he could shake off his surprise at Ben-Ahmed's unexpected reaction to his honest words. Foster had braced himself for punishment, even death, for Hester's sake, but to his astonishment, Ben-Ahmed set him free with a mission to fulfill. Overwhelmed by the turn of events, Foster was elated at the prospect of aiding Hester's escape. As he strolled through town, his heart lightened, and he found himself engrossed in the bustling streets, momentarily forgetting his enslavement. Lost in his observations, Foster was nudged by a passerby, unaware that it was Hester and Peter the Great. Meanwhile, Foster's encounter with a cruel Moor mistreating a donkey ignited his compassion, leading to a swift act of defiance that landed him in the hands of justice. At the same time, Peter the Great guided Hester to the city walls, where her father toiled among other slaves, unbeknownst to her in his altered state.|"[""1.

The breakfast room at the seaside villa was filled with an interesting mix of people who had stuck together since arriving in England. Hugh Sommers, once a ragged slave, now looked like a fine gentleman in a grey shooting suit. Hester, with her sunny hair and cheerful demeanor, stood out from the veiled Moorish lady and the thin-nosed negress. Edouard Laronde, recovering from a severe illness, had also undergone a transformation. Brown the sailor was present too, as young Foster planned to get him into the Navy. Lastly, Peter the Great, though offered a seat at the breakfast table, preferred to be a waiter, loyal to his Angelica. The mood was serious as the middy shared news of his visit to London, hinting at hope despite initial setbacks.|"[""1.

"""No, sir, you're not in a hurry. There's plenty of time,"" assured the man as he checked the time on a pocket watch. ""The coach won't depart until one o'clock; it's only eleven now, so there's no rush. Just relax on the bed, and I'll pack the bag."" Two hours later, Laronde was speeding across the countryside with George Foster and Peter the Great by his side, and Brown driving the coach.
