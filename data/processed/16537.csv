In ancient times, people viewed the world through a lens of imagination, where everything that moved or made a sound was seen as a living being.

The young girls adorned the mighty Hercules with wreaths of roses, covering his lion's skin and club with bright blossoms. They danced around him, chanting poetry turned choral song in his honor. Hercules, pleased but unsatisfied, sought the Old Man of the Sea for advice on further adventures. The damsels directed him to the Old Man, warning him to hold on tight when he found him. Grateful for their kindness, Hercules set off on his journey. As he travelled through woods, he mistook trees for giants, eager to face new challenges.

Hurrying forward without looking back, Hercules heard the sea roaring in the distance. He quickened his pace and reached a beach where waves crashed onto the sand. Amidst green shrubs on a cliff, Hercules saw an old man asleep, or so he thought. Upon closer inspection, the old man resembled a sea creature with scales, webbed feet, and a beard like seaweed. Hercules realized it was the Old Man of the Sea who would guide him. Startled, Hercules grabbed the old man, who transformed into a stag, then a sea bird, a three-headed dog, and finally a huge snake. Despite the transformations, Hercules held on, showing courage in the face of danger.

Hercules found himself on a colossal cup that floated effortlessly on the sea, guided by unseen forces towards an island. As he dozed, the cup hit a rock, waking him to a thunderous noise.

My dear young friends, imagine the immense burden Hercules carried on his shoulders as he held up the sky, which seemed so light and gentle above us. The wind, clouds, and sun all added to his discomfort. Hercules feared the giant Atlas would not return to relieve him. He envied the shepherds below, leading a simpler life. Atlas finally appeared on the horizon, holding three golden apples. Hercules thanked him for the apples but asked for the sky to be lifted from his shoulders once more. Atlas hesitated, tossing the apples into the air. Hercules grew impatient, causing some stars to fall. Atlas laughed, assuring Hercules he had not let stars fall in centuries. The lesson learned was one of patience and the weight of responsibilities.|['1.

Proserpina held up her apron full of flowers and tugged at the deep-rooted shrub with all her might. The earth stirred and cracked, making way for a rumbling sound beneath her feet. As she pulled harder, a hole widened beneath the shrub's roots, growing deeper. Suddenly, a team of four sable horses emerged from the hole, pulling a golden chariot with a man adorned in diamonds.

King Pluto boasted about his golden palace with crystal windows and diamond lamps, offering Proserpina the throne to be his queen.

Pluto assured Proserpina that his fearsome dog, Cerberus, only acted if someone trespassed into his kingdom uninvited or tried to escape. As they rode on, Pluto pointed out the riches of his underground realm, with veins of gold and diamonds waiting to be unearthed. They reached a bridge over a dark, stagnant stream that made one forget their sorrows with a sip. Pluto promised Proserpina a drink to erase her sadness, but she refused, valuing her memories of her mother more. Upon their arrival at the palace, aglow with precious stones, Proserpina's presence dimmed the grandeur, revealing the emptiness within.

Mother Ceres, after losing her daughter Proserpina, embarked on a quest to find her. She heard Proserpina's cries, but they seemed distant. The sea nymphs informed her that Proserpina had left to gather flowers and never returned. Ceres searched everywhere but found no trace of her daughter. She lit a torch and set out on foot. Along the way, she found a flower that Proserpina had touched. Ceres suspected foul play and worried that her daughter might have been poisoned.

All through the night, Ceres went from door to door, asking everyone she met if they had seen her missing child, Proserpina. At each cottage and palace, she knocked loudly, hoping for any news. But the weary laborers and palace menials couldn't help her. They pitied her and offered rest, but no one had seen Proserpina. Ceres didn't stop her search, not even to eat or rest. She carried a torch, its flame burning brightly day and night. She even asked creatures of the woods and streams, like the hamadryads and naiads, but they too had no clue. Even the fauns and satyrs couldn't assist. It wasn't until the tenth day that Ceres spotted a cave, dimly lit by a flickering torch. Inside, she saw a strange woman with a wreath of snakes on her head, sitting among autumn leaves. This odd woman seemed to prefer misery, much to Ceres' disappointment.|"['1.

Hecate, with a cracked voice, told Ceres she hadn't seen her daughter but heard a girl's distress cries nine days ago. She sensed a dragon or monster took her. Hecate heard wheels rumbling eastward. She advised Ceres to stay in the cave, believing they'd be the most wretched. Ceres asked Hecate to help find her daughter. Reluctantly, Hecate agreed, carrying torches in daylight. They sought Phœbus, whom Hecate warned against approaching. They found Phœbus playing music. He assured them he saw Proserpina recently and she was safe. Hecate hissed, disliking the sunny Phœbus.

Once upon a time, Phœbus, a skilled lyre player, narrated a tale to Ceres about her daughter, Proserpina, who was snatched away by King Pluto to his splendid palace. Phœbus assured Ceres that Proserpina would be surrounded by opulence in the underworld. However, Ceres, distressed by her daughter's absence, sought Phœbus' help to retrieve Proserpina. Phœbus politely declined due to his strained relationship with Pluto. Undeterred, Ceres, accompanied by Hecate, embarked on a quest to reclaim her daughter.

During her journey to find the entrance to Pluto's realm, a woman arrived at King Celeus' palace in Eleusis. The queen, Metanira, sought a nurse for her sickly baby.

Mother Ceres, in despair over her daughter Proserpina's absence, made a solemn vow that no crops or flowers would grow until her daughter was returned. The earth suffered as a result, with fields barren and flowers withering. Even the animals seemed to beg for Ceres' mercy. People pleaded with her to let the grass grow, but she remained firm. In a last resort, Quicksilver was sent to King Pluto to beg for Proserpina's release. Meanwhile, Proserpina, determined not to eat in the underworld, managed to stay healthy despite tempting treats.

Proserpina felt pity for him and held his hand. Pluto asked if she was hungry, hoping she would eat and stay. Proserpina declined the feast, wanting only her mother's bread and fruit.

"""It is the only one in the world,"" said the servant. He placed the golden tray with the shrunken pomegranate on it and exited the room.

Pegasus had been trying hard to shake off Bellerophon as they flew a long distance and reached the mountain of Helicon. Recognizing the place as Pegasus' home, Bellerophon allowed him to land. After a gentle look, Pegasus flew off but returned at sunset, showing his desire for freedom. The next day, they bonded and embarked on aerial journeys, astonishing people below. Bellerophon enjoyed the sunny skies but remembered his promise to slay the Chimæra. Once confident in their partnership, they set out to face the perilous beast. At daybreak, Bellerophon excitedly woke Pegasus, who pranced and neighed joyfully, ready for the adventure ahead. The duo's friendship and trust grew as they prepared to confront the fearsome Chimæra.|['1.

After their morning meal, Bellerophon and Pegasus drank from the Hippocrene spring. Pegasus eagerly accepted his bridle, playfully leaping in impatience. Bellerophon readied himself for battle, mounting Pegasus and ascending perpendicularly for a better view. Heading east towards Lycia, they spotted an eagle. As they drew closer to Lycia, they hid in the clouds. Peering over the cloud's edge, Bellerophon saw the rocky valleys and ruins below. Not much caught his eye until he noticed three smoke spires rising from a cavern. The smoke's stench caused Pegasus to rise higher. Looking back, Bellerophon saw a dreadful sight - a three-headed creature in the cavern, with smoke rising from its heads. Realizing it was the Chimæra, they descended for a closer look. The Chimæra, a monstrous blend of snake, lion, and goat, was devouring a lamb.|"['1.

Bellerophon suddenly realized the approaching Chimæra, a fearsome monster with three heads spewing flames. Pegasus, his loyal winged horse, sensed the danger too and let out a battle cry. The monster charged towards them, claws ready and tail lashing venomously. Swiftly, Pegasus soared into the sky, narrowly avoiding the Chimæra's attack. Bellerophon, preparing for battle, armed himself as the monster roared and hissed. Determined to defeat the Chimæra, Bellerophon whispered to Pegasus, urging him to help or leave him behind. Pegasus, showing affection, nuzzled his rider's cheek, signifying their bond. With determination, Bellerophon and Pegasus swooped down towards the Chimæra. In a swift motion, Bellerophon struck the goat head of the monster, rendering it lifeless. Despite some injuries, they continued their attack, aiming to vanquish the remaining heads.

Bellerophon bravely rode Pegasus straight at the monstrous Chimæra after losing its second head. The beast, in a fiery rage, flailed about, spewing flames that singed them both. As Pegasus soared higher, the Chimæra clung to them until Bellerophon, facing the monster head-on, thrust his sword into its exposed chest. The creature fell, consumed by its own fire. Mistaken for a comet, it burned to ashes. Pegasus swiftly carried Bellerophon back to the fountain where the boy, who had waited faithfully, hid his tears. Bellerophon credited the boy's faith for their victory and set Pegasus free. The child, inspired by this adventure, grew to be a renowned poet, surpassing even Bellerophon's triumph over the Chimæra.|"['1.

Once upon a time, there lived a wealthy man named King Midas. He had a daughter named Marygold, whom he adored. However, King Midas was obsessed with gold. He valued his crown made of gold above all else. He believed that amassing wealth was the best gift he could give his daughter. As he became more consumed by his desire for riches, he spent all his time and thoughts on accumulating gold. Even when his daughter offered him flowers, he dismissed them, wishing they were made of gold. Despite once enjoying flowers and music, King Midas now only found joy in his vast collection of gold. His insatiable thirst for gold led him to a dark dungeon where he hoarded his treasures, constantly seeking more gold to add to his collection.|"['1.

King Midas woke up feeling desolate, regretting his lost hopes. As the sunbeam shone through, everything he touched turned to gold. Excited, he transformed his room into a golden wonderland. However, when he turned his daughter's handkerchief into gold, he felt a pang of regret. Despite this, he remained positive, realizing the sacrifices that came with his newfound power.

King Midas possessed a unique ability to turn ordinary objects into gold with just a touch. This power extended to flowers, transforming each delicate petal and even the worms within them into precious gold. After completing this task, Midas returned to the palace for breakfast, where a sumptuous meal awaited him. The king enjoyed a feast of hot cakes, trout, potatoes, eggs, and coffee, while his daughter Marygold was served a simple bowl of bread and milk. When Marygold joined them, she was in tears, lamenting the blighted roses in the garden that had turned to gold. Midas, trying to console her, transformed her plain china bowl into gold, but Marygold was more concerned about the ruined roses. Unbeknownst to her, the king's touch had also turned his coffee into gold, presenting a new challenge of dealing with his newfound ability.|"['1.

King Midas sat at the table with a plate of freshly cooked trout, eager to eat. Curiously, he touched the fish's tail and watched in horror as it transformed into a golden fish. Even the bones and fins turned to gold! Next, he picked up a cake that turned into gold before his eyes. Trying to eat an egg, it too changed into gold. Frustrated, he attempted to eat a potato, but it too became gold, burning his mouth. King Midas realized that his golden touch had turned all his food inedible. Despite having the richest breakfast, he was left hungry and miserable. Reflecting on the situation, he realized that his daughter's love was more valuable than all the gold in the world.|"['1.

Alas, what had he done? How fatal was the gift which the stranger bestowed! The moment the lips of Midas touched Marygold's forehead, a change had taken place. Her sweet, rosy face, so full of affection as it had been, assumed a glittering yellow colour, with yellow tear-drops congealing on her cheeks. Her beautiful brown ringlets took the same tint. Her soft and tender little form grew hard and inflexible within her father's encircling arms. Oh, terrible misfortune! The victim of his insatiable desire for wealth, little Marygold was a human child no longer, but a golden statue! Yes, there she was, with the questioning look of love, grief, and pity, hardened into her face. It was the prettiest and most woeful sight that ever mortal saw. All the features and tokens of Marygold were there; even the beloved little dimple remained in her golden chin. But, the more perfect was the resemblance, the greater was the father's agony at beholding this golden image, which was all that was left him of a daughter. It had been a favourite phrase of Midas, whenever he felt particularly fond of the child, to say that she was worth her weight in gold. And now the phrase had become literally true. And, now, at last, when it was too late, he felt how infinitely a warm and tender heart, that loved him, exceeded in value all|"[""1.

"""You are wiser than you were, King Midas!"" said the stranger, looking seriously at him. ""Your own heart, I perceive, has not been entirely changed from flesh to gold. Were it so, your case would indeed be desperate. But you appear to be still capable of understanding that the commonest things, such as lie within everybody's grasp, are more valuable than the riches which so many mortals sigh and struggle after. Tell me, now, do you sincerely desire to rid yourself of this Golden Touch?""

""Go, then,"" said the stranger, ""and plunge into the river that glides past the bottom of your garden. Take likewise a vase of the same water, and sprinkle it over any object that you may desire to change back again from gold into its former substance. If you do this in earnestness and sincerity, it may possibly repair the mischief which your avarice has occasioned.""

Midas lost no time in snatching up a great earthen pitcher and hastening to the river-side. As he dipped the pitcher into the water, it gladdened his very heart to see it change from gold into the same good, honest earthen vessel. He was conscious of a change within himself. A cold, hard, and heavy weight seemed to have gone out of his bosom. No doubt, his heart had been gradually losing its human substance, and transmuting itself into insensible metal, but had now softened back again into flesh.

King Midas, once granted the power to turn everything he touched into gold, learned a valuable lesson about greed and the true meaning of wealth. His daughter, Marygold, bore a golden tinge in her hair as a reminder of his past folly.

Perseus departed from the castle, but Polydectes couldn't contain his amusement, laughing at how easily the young man fell into the trap. The news quickly spread that Perseus had set out to behead Medusa, the dreadful creature with snakes for hair. The island's inhabitants, as wicked as the king, relished the idea of harm befalling Danaë and her son. The only good soul on Seriphus was a fisherman. As Perseus walked, people jeered and mocked him, pointing and making faces. At that time, three Gorgons existed, monstrous creatures with snaky hair, tusks, brass hands, and bodies covered in impenetrable scales. They could turn any living being to stone with just a glance. Perseus realized the immense danger of his quest, knowing he must defeat Medusa without looking at her.

Perseus, now filled with confidence in his clever companion Quicksilver, eagerly agreed to embark on their adventure. As they set off, Quicksilver's swift pace made it challenging for Perseus to keep up, sparking the suspicion that Quicksilver wore winged shoes, or perhaps even had wings on his head. Despite this, Quicksilver's twisted staff proved invaluable, infusing Perseus with energy. As they walked and conversed, Quicksilver shared his past exploits, impressing Perseus with his wisdom and wit. Quicksilver cautioned Perseus about the Three Gray Women they were about to encounter, advising him to be cautious.

Perseus encountered the Three Gray Women who shared a single eye among them. They passed the eye from one to another, like a pair of spectacles, or a quizzing glass. While one held the eye, the others were left in darkness. Perseus saw them with long gray hair, two with empty eye sockets, and one with a bright, piercing eye. The women led each other, the one with the eye guiding the group. Nightmare and Shakejoint argued over who should hold the eye next. In the confusion, Perseus seized the eye. The women, unaware of the change, continued quarreling. Perseus then revealed himself, causing the women to panic, demanding their eye back. They were left bewildered, realizing their eyesight was lost to a stranger.|['1.

"Quicksilver whispered to Perseus, ""Tell them they'll get back the eye when they reveal where to find the Nymphs with the flying slippers, magic wallet, and helmet of darkness."" Perseus assured the Gray Women, ""You'll have your eye back once you guide me to the Nymphs."" The Gray Women were confused, not knowing about the Nymphs. Perseus politely held onto the eye, waiting for the information. Quicksilver advised Perseus not to be fooled, as the Gray Women were the only ones who knew about the Nymphs. Perseus needed this knowledge to defeat Medusa. It was crucial to keep the eye until they disclosed the Nymphs' whereabouts."|"[""Question 1: What did Quicksilver advise Perseus to do regarding the eye?\na) Return it immediately\nb) Keep it until the Gray Women reveal the Nymphs' whereabouts\nc) Give it to Medusa\nd) Throw it away\ne) Hide it in the magic wallet"", 'Question 2: Why did Perseus need to find the Nymphs?\na) To get back the magic wallet\nb) To defeat Medusa\nc) To learn how to fly\nd) To get the helmet of darkness\ne) To help the Gray Women see', 'Question 3: How did Perseus assure the Gray Women that they would get their eye back?\na) By threatening them\nb) By giving them a gift\nc) By telling them they would get it back once they guide him to the Nymphs\nd) By ignoring them\ne) By running away', ""Question 4: Why were the Gray Women confused?\na) They didn't like Perseus\nb) They had forgotten where the Nymphs were\nc) They didn't want their eye back\nd) They were under a spell\ne) They were lost in the forest"", ""Question 5: What was the importance of the Nymphs' knowledge to Perseus?\na) To learn how to swim\nb) To find a treasure\nc) To defeat the Gray Women\nd) To defeat Medusa\ne) To learn how to fly"", ""Question 6: How did Perseus handle the situation with the Gray Women and the eye?\na) He gave the eye back immediately\nb) He kept the eye until they disclosed the Nymphs' whereabouts\nc) He threw the eye away\nd) He asked Quicksilver to take the eye\ne) He traded the eye for the helmet of darkness""]"|"[""b) Keep it until the Gray Women reveal the Nymphs' whereabouts"", 'b) To defeat Medusa', 'c) By telling them they would get it back once they guide him to the Nymphs', 'b) They had forgotten where the Nymphs were', 'd) To defeat Medusa', ""b) He kept the eye until they disclosed the Nymphs' whereabouts""]"
Quicksilver was proven right in the end. The Gray Women highly valued their single eye, equal to having half a dozen eyes. Perseus, seeking their help, learned that he needed to give the eye to Scarecrow. As they argued about this, Perseus swiftly placed the eye back, thanked them, and left. He then found the Nymphs, who were young and beautiful, unlike the Gray Women. They provided him with a magic wallet and winged slippers. Perseus, after putting on the slippers, unexpectedly soared into the air, struggling to come back down. Quicksilver chuckled and mentioned the invisible helmet, which the Nymphs then placed on Perseus. Upon wearing it, Perseus vanished from sight, hidden under its magic. Now invisible, he was ready to face the challenges ahead.|['1.

In the sky, Quicksilver's cap expanded its wings, and Perseus followed suit, floating effortlessly into the air. As they ascended, Perseus marveled at the beauty of leaving the earth below and soaring like a bird. The moon shone brightly, tempting him to fly there, but the sight of the earth's seas, rivers, mountains, and cities captivated him. They flew swiftly, passing through clouds and witnessing meteors lighting up the sky. Quicksilver revealed that Perseus' sister was invisibly accompanying them, possessing extraordinary wisdom and vision. Flying over the vast ocean, the waves roared below, while a melodious voice spoke nearby. Descending to a small island, Perseus discovered the slumbering Gorgons, monstrous beings with golden wings and brazen claws. The Gorgons, with faces hidden, appeared insect-like yet partly human, a terrifying sight that could turn anyone who gazed upon them into stone.|"['1.

It is essential to know that Medusa was the only one of the dragon monsters that Perseus could defeat by cutting off her head. The other two monsters were invulnerable to any sword, no matter how sharp. A calm voice warned Perseus that Medusa was stirring in her sleep and about to turn over. He was advised not to look at her directly, as her gaze could turn him to stone. Instead, he was instructed to use his shield as a mirror to see her reflection. Perseus obeyed, and in the shield's reflection, he saw Medusa's terrifying face with snakes writhing around it. He swiftly beheaded her as she awoke, and the small wallet he carried magically expanded to hold her severed head. The noise of the battle awoke the other monsters, but Perseus, using his invisibility helmet and winged slippers, managed to escape unharmed and flew to Seriphus with Medusa's head.|"['1.

Perseus had faced many challenges on his journey back home. He had slain a sea monster about to devour a maiden and turned a giant into stone with the Gorgon's head. Upon his return, he found his mother missing, seeking refuge in a temple due to the wicked king's mistreatment. The island's few kind souls were the old priests and a fisherman. When Perseus met the king, he was asked about the Gorgon's head. Perseus suggested a public viewing to fulfill the king's wish. The king agreed, summoning all subjects to the palace. The people, mostly troublemakers, gathered eagerly to see the Gorgon's head.

In a kingdom by the sea, three siblings, Cadmus, Phœnix, and Cilix, played with their sister Europa. As they adorned her with flowers, a butterfly caught their attention, leading them on a chase. Europa, tired, sat down and closed her eyes. Suddenly, a snow-white bull appeared, startling her. Though initially frightened, Europa realized the bull was gentle and kind. She began to stroke his forehead and feed him grass. The bull, delighted by her trust, pranced playfully around her. Europa felt at ease, seeing the bull as a friendly creature.

Once upon a time, there was a kind and friendly bull who showed immense gratitude and joy towards a little girl named Europa. The bull even knelt down before her, making gestures of friendship and understanding. Europa, at first hesitant, decided to take a ride on the bull's back, thinking it would be harmless and fun. As she galloped across the meadow, her brothers watched in surprise. The bull carried her swiftly towards her brothers, causing a mix of fear and excitement. However, to everyone's horror, the bull dashed into the sea with Europa on its back. Despite the siblings' efforts, the bull and Europa vanished into the deep waters.

King Agenor was furious and demanded his daughter Europa be brought back to him by the boys.

They set off on a long journey, asking everyone they met about Europa's whereabouts. Despite their efforts, no one had seen her riding a snow-white bull. As time passed, their royal attire wore out, and they began to look like wanderers. They helped farmers in exchange for shelter and continued their search, leaving behind their royal past.

In a pleasant and solitary area, Phœnix decided to stop wandering and build a cozy hut with the help of his companions. The bower had two rooms, one with a moss bed and the other furnished with rustic tree root seats. Phœnix bid his family farewell, shedding tears as they left. Over time, others without homes settled nearby, forming a city. Phœnix, with royal blood, was chosen as king. His first decree was to treat kindly any maiden arriving on a snow-white bull, claiming to be Europa. This decision reflected Phœnix's lingering guilt for abandoning the search for his sister. Telephassa, Cadmus, Cilix, and Thasus felt melancholy, knowing they would resume their journey the next day, uncertain if they were any closer to their goal.

Telephassa expressed her deep love for her daughter Europa, stating that in her heart, Europa remains the same rosy child who used to gather flowers. Despite the weariness of their journey, Telephassa and Thasus decided to continue the search for Europa. Cilix, however, chose to stay behind and eventually became a king in a newly formed city. King Cilix sent out expeditions to search for Europa, regretting giving up the quest.

Before starting their journey, Cadmus helped Thasus construct a shelter while Telephassa, being too weak to offer much help, guided them on how to set it up comfortably. Thasus, however, didn't spend all his time in the bower. Other homeless people also found the spot appealing and built homes nearby. In a few years, a thriving city emerged with Thasus as its king, chosen for his upright and courageous nature. But once he settled the kingdom's affairs, Thasus handed over his royal attire and duties to another and resumed his quest for the snow-white bull and the lost child. Despite Europa never returning, Thasus kept provisions ready in case she did. Telephassa and Cadmus continued their journey alone, with the queen growing weaker by the day but determined to find her lost child. Eventually, she told Cadmus that her rest would be eternal, urging him to bury her there.

I will not make you sad, my young listeners, by telling you how Telephassa passed away and was laid to rest. Instead, I will share that her final smile brightened even more upon her lifeless face, convincing Cadmus that she had embraced Europa in the afterlife. After tenderly tending to his mother's grave, he embarked alone towards the renowned oracle of Delphi, following Telephassa's guidance. Along the way, he asked everyone he met about Europa, a question that had become second nature to him. Responses varied, including a mariner's tale of a white bull carrying a child adorned in sea-blurred flowers. Despite doubts about the mariner's sincerity, Cadmus pressed on, his heart heavy with thoughts of his family left behind. As he neared Mount Parnassus, home to Delphi, memories of his loved ones filled his mind.

Cadmus grew weary of hearing the repeated words from the oracle, unable to grasp their meaning. As he pondered, a gentle breeze whispered a new message, barely audible. Despite his confusion, the wind offered no further clarity. Disheartened, Cadmus aimlessly wandered, his mind lingering on the oracle's enigmatic guidance. Suddenly, a brindled cow caught his eye, peacefully grazing by the wayside. Intrigued, Cadmus followed her, unsure if she was the prophesied guide. The cow ambled leisurely, indifferent to Cadmus' presence. Despite his efforts to catch up, the cow maintained her pace, pausing only to graze or drink from a stream.

The magical fountain was guarded by a fierce dragon, preventing anyone from quenching their thirst. The dragon, having not eaten in a long time, had grown ravenous.

Cadmus, a brave warrior, threw a stone into the midst of the earth army, hitting a fierce warrior's breastplate. The warrior, thinking he was struck by someone, attacked his comrade, setting off a chain reaction of violence. The battle raged on, resulting in fallen soldiers striking each other down. Only five warriors remained standing, the strongest and boldest of them all. They saluted Cadmus and awaited his command.

Their small house sat atop a hill, not far from a village nestled in a valley about half a mile wide. Long ago, this valley was likely a lake where fish swam and trees were mirrored. Now, it was a fertile land with only a small brook flowing through the village. The villagers, despite the abundance, were selfish and unkind. They mistreated strangers and taught their children to do the same. The rich were treated with respect, but the poor were met with hostility.

Ulysses, the wisest, faced the most challenges. His journey began as he sailed northwest to the Thracian coast, where his men faced a fierce battle. Later, they encountered the Lotus-eaters, who offered fruit causing forgetfulness. Ulysses bound those affected and continued.

In the evening, a giant Cyclops returned home, carrying a bundle of pine logs for his fire. He herded his flocks into the cave, sealing the entrance with a massive rock.

Once the giant Polyphemus was disturbed from his sleep, he bellowed, alerting the other Cyclopes nearby. They gathered around his cave, questioning him about the commotion.

In ancient times, Ulysses and his crew faced the wrath of the Cyclops, a one-eyed giant. The Cyclops hurled a massive rock towards their ship, causing a great wave that pushed them back to shore. Quick-thinking Ulysses used a long pole to push the ship back to sea, silently directing his crew to row without alerting the Cyclops. Despite the danger, Ulysses considered speaking again, but his crew wisely stopped him, fearing the Cyclops' immense strength. The Cyclops, reflecting on an old prophecy, lamented his loss of sight caused by Ulysses and sought Poseidon's favor for vengeance. As the Cyclops hurled another rock, narrowly missing the ship, Ulysses and his crew narrowly escaped. They later reached an island, reunited with their comrades, and shared a feast of sheep taken from the Cyclops. Ulysses, showing gratitude, sacrificed a ram to Zeus.

Heracles ventured into the woods with his bow to hunt wild deer. Hylas, a fair boy, followed him stealthily and got lost among the glens. He sat by a lake, where water nymphs emerged, enchanted by him, and took him under the lake to play forever. Heracles searched in vain, shouting for Hylas.

Polydeuces defeated him, and they continued to Phineus' city. Phineus, plagued by Harpies, begged for help. Zetes and Calais, sons of the North wind, offered to drive the Harpies away if Phineus righted his wrongs. They chased the Harpies, bringing relief.

Tiphys, the wise helmsman, led the heroes through treacherous ice crags, narrowly escaping death's grasp. Traveling wearily along the Asian coast, they mourned the loss of Idmon and Tiphys, honoring them with a mound and an oar. Idas avenged Tiphys by slaying a wild boar. Ancaios took the helm as they journeyed toward the east, passing Sinope and the lands of the Amazons. The clang of anvils marked their arrival at the forges of the Chalybes, skilled smiths devoted to war.

In ancient times, in a land far away, there was a quest for the golden fleece. The king of that land, Aietes, challenged the heroes to a deadly fight for the fleece. However, Chalciope, Phrixus's widow, felt pity for the brave men and sought a peaceful solution. She believed that the heroes were different from their own men and could achieve the impossible. Medeia, her sister, a wise enchantress, also saw potential in Jason, the hero leading the quest. She revealed the daunting tasks ahead to win the fleece, involving taming fiery bulls, plowing a field, sowing serpent's teeth, and defeating armed warriors. The final challenge was to face a colossal serpent guarding the fleece. Medeia, with her magical ointment, offered Jason the strength and protection needed for the perilous journey. Despite the daunting obstacles, Jason and his companions were determined to venture forth, guided by the wisdom and magic of Medeia.|['1.

Jason, after receiving the ointment from Medeia, displayed his newfound strength to his comrades. Despite Idas' envy, Jason's shield and weapons withstood any test. His comrades tried to bend his lance, but it remained unyielding. Even when attacked by Idas, the sword shattered on his shield. Jason's incredible strength amazed everyone. As dawn broke, Jason bathed in the river, anointed himself with the ointment, and prepared for the challenge against Aietes. The gates opened, releasing magic bulls that breathed fire. Medeia's spell subdued the bulls, and Jason wrestled with one, proving his might. The earth then birthed warriors clad in steel, but Jason's cunning helmet caused them to turn on each other until they lay defeated. Aietes, realizing Jason's power, delayed the confrontation until the next day, leaving the Minuai frustrated and plotting to claim the golden fleece.|"['1.

Jason and his brave companions, including the talented Orpheus, sought the golden fleece. Medeia, a priestess with magical powers, helped them. Facing challenges, they encountered the fearsome serpent guarding the fleece. With courage and determination, they pressed on. Medeia's heart was torn between her home and her new path with the heroes. Yet, she chose to guide them to their goal. The witch queen Brimo and her hounds appeared, but vanished as quickly as they came. The heroes, led by Medeia, ventured through the dark woods, drawn by the gleam of the golden fleece.

Medeia gently called to the serpent, who licked her hand and looked at her expectantly. She signaled Orpheus to begin his enchanting song. As the melody filled the air, the forest grew calm, and the serpent relaxed, closing its eyes peacefully. The group swiftly sailed down the stream, past various landscapes, towards the west. Aietes, in pursuit with his fleet, was spotted by Lynceus. To escape, Medeia devised a cunning plan, sacrificing her brother and delaying her father. Despite the escape, Zeus sent a storm, leading the heroes off course. The ship eventually struck a shoal, leaving them hopeless. Jason pleaded to Hera for help, and a magical bough revealed their fate. They spared Medeia, as she was essential to guide them to Circe.

And everything stayed nearby and listened; the seagulls perched in white lines on the rocks; on the shore, large seals lounged, keeping time with lazy nods; while silvery schools of fish emerged to listen, whispering as they disturbed the shining calm. The Wind above quieted his whistling as he guided his clouds westward; the clouds stood in the mid-blue, dreaming, like a flock of golden sheep. As the heroes listened, their oars slipped from their grasp, heads drooped, eyes closed, dreaming of peaceful gardens and slumber under murmuring pines, forgetting their toils. One hero raised his head suddenly, suggesting they rest a while. Another proposed rowing to shore to hear the singing words. Orpheus, lifting his harp, played a song of Perseus, captivating all with his music. Butes swam to shore, enchanted by the Sirens' song, falling into a deep sleep. Fair Aphrodite, seeing this, rescued Butes from the Sirens' clutches, carrying him to safety. As they neared Sicily, they encountered Charybdis and the rock of Scylla, a treacherous sea-hag.

Sitting on the pebbles, they wept, realizing how much had changed. Seeking news of their parents, Jason and Medeia went to Pelias' palace. Pelias, aged and blind, mistook Jason for the son he believed dead. Jason revealed his return with the Golden Fleece and demanded the kingdom.

Long ago, the gods created Asgard, a magnificent city above the heavens, where they lived in splendor. The city was built with great care, including a grand hall named Valhalla where brave warriors who died in battle were welcomed every day. These heroes, brought by the Valkyries, enjoyed eternal happiness in Valhalla, where they feasted, fought, and lived joyfully.

Heimdal, the watchman of Asgard, with his keen eyes and sharp ears, challenged the stranger who claimed to be a builder. The stranger, a massive man with iron muscles, offered to construct a fortress for the Æsir. Odin, intrigued by the stranger's confidence, agreed to his terms: build the fortress in one winter without help, and he could have Freia, the Sun, and Moon. Loki, the trickster, added the condition that the builder could only use his horse, Svadilföri.

The Æsir, the gods of Asgard, faced a dilemma when a mysterious stranger offered to build them a fortress in an impossibly short time. Despite some hesitation, Loki, known for his trickery, convinced the Æsir to accept the offer, assuring them there was no harm. The stranger's incredible strength and his horse's extraordinary abilities amazed everyone as the castle rose swiftly. With only three days left, the Æsir realized the steep price they might have to pay if the stranger completed the fortress.

In ancient times, the city of Asgard was fortified by a giant-built fortress, so strong that it was impervious to harm. However, three stones at the gate's top remained unplaced, a reminder of the giants' enmity. Despite Loki's cunning that saved Freia, the Sun, and Moon, trouble brewed in Asgard as long as Loki lived. Initially, giants inhabited Jotunheim, a realm of darkness. The gods, Æsir, then created the world and dwelt in Asgard. Dwarfs lived underground, while men resided in Midgard. Yggdrasil, a vast ash tree, connected the realms. Creatures like an eagle, deer, serpent, squirrel, and Norns resided in and around Yggdrasil. Odin sought wisdom from Mimer's well, guarded by the giant Mimer, to become the wisest being.|"['1.

Mimer, the wise giant, eyed Odin keenly as he requested a drink from his magical well. Odin, the god, sought the deep wisdom hidden in the fountain. Reluctantly, Mimer agreed but warned Odin of the consequences. Odin drank from the well, gaining immense wisdom but losing an eye in the process. This sacrifice marked the beginning of trouble between their races. Despite the loss, Odin later exchanged Mimer as a hostage to secure peace with the Vanir, receiving the sea lord Niörd and his children in return. This exchange ultimately favored Odin, as Niörd and his children were valuable assets to the Æsir.

The Vanir believed Hœnir, brother of Odin, to be wise, unaware that Mimer's wisdom surpassed his. Mimer, an old giant, whispered counsel to Hœnir, making him seem wise. Without Mimer, Hœnir was clueless. The Vanir, realizing the deception, beheaded Mimer and sent his head to Odin. Odin, learning from the head, kept it for its wisdom. Meanwhile, Thor, the protector of Asgard, discovered his hammer, Miölnir, missing. He searched with his family but couldn't find it.

When Thor confronted Loki about the missing hammer, Loki feigned innocence and suggested that the giant Thrym might be the thief. Loki proposed a plan to retrieve the hammer from Thrym using cunning rather than brute force, which Thor reluctantly agreed to, knowing he needed his hammer back to fight the giants.

Loki responded sharply to Thor's reluctance, emphasizing the danger Asgard faced.

Once upon a time, Odin, Loki, and Hœner embarked on a journey. They often journeyed together for various errands, but Loki's mischievous ways had caused them trouble. The gods were strong and active spirits who enjoyed hard work and challenges. As they traveled through mountains, valleys, and streams, they grew tired and hungry. Eventually, they stumbled upon a herd of cattle and tried to cook an ox, but the pot wouldn't boil. An eagle offered to make it boil if fed. The gods agreed, and the eagle cooked the meat but took a large share. Loki, angered, tried to attack the eagle but got stuck to it. The eagle revealed himself as the giant Thjasse and demanded Loki to bring him the Apples of Idun in exchange for his freedom. The Apples kept the gods immortal and youthful, and Loki reluctantly agreed to the task.|"[""1.

Loki, a mischievous god, made a promise to steal the Apples of Immortality to torment the other gods. He tricked Idun, the guardian of the apples, and led her to the giant Thjasse. As a result, the gods aged rapidly without the rejuvenating apples. In desperation, the gods captured Loki and demanded him to bring back Idun. Loki, in the form of a falcon, rescued Idun from Thjasse's clutches. Thjasse pursued them, but the gods intervened by creating a wall of fire.

Idun transformed back to her natural form as Brage hurried towards her. The gods gathered around her as she presented the feast, the golden Apples shining with indescribable brilliance.

Odin, the great god, rode sadly out of Asgard to Niflheim, the home of Hel, whose face was like death. Near the gates, a monstrous dog barked furiously. Odin rode east to a prophetess's grave. Chanting strange songs, he called out to the dead. Meanwhile, in Asgard, the gods played with Balder, hurling weapons at him that couldn't harm him. Loki, jealous, found a mistletoe twig that could harm Balder. Disguised as an old woman, Loki tricked Frigg into revealing this secret. Loki returned, gave Hoder the twig, and it pierced Balder's heart, killing him. The gods mourned Balder's death. They prepared for his funeral but couldn't launch the ship to carry him to sea. Odin knew of the dark future ahead.|"[""1. What was Odin's mood as he rode out of Asgard to Niflheim?\nA) Joyful\nB) Sad\nC) Angry\nD) Excited\nE) Confused"", '2.

Hyrroken swiftly arrived on a massive wolf that resembled Fenrer, causing a commotion among the gods. Odin commanded four strong Berserkers to restrain the wolf, but it took great effort to subdue him. Hyrroken then pushed the ship into the sea with a single powerful motion, causing the earth to tremble. Thor, angered by the chaos, was restrained by the other gods from harming Hyrroken. Balder's funeral was solemn and grand, with gods and giants gathered to bid him farewell. As the ship burned with Balder and Nanna on board, a deep silence fell over all worlds. Hermod embarked on a dark journey to Hel's realm to speak with Balder and Nanna, bringing a glimmer of hope in the midst of sorrow.|"[""1. What caused a commotion among the gods in the text?\nA.

In a kingdom filled with sorrow, Hel's decree was clear: Balder must return. Tears flowed like rain as messengers spread the word across all realms, urging all who loved Balder to weep for his homecoming. Asgard wept, the earth mourned. Men, women, and children sobbed, birds lamented, beasts moaned, trees sighed, and flowers wept for the light and warmth lost. The sound of weeping echoed like autumn storms mourning a departed summer. Amidst this sadness, an old chieftain, smoking his pipe, shared a tale with Indian children. Long ago, when the world was united and bountiful, nature flourished, and man lived in harmony. The Indians thrived in a paradise where animals were tame, fruit abundant, and flowers fragrant. The stars held special meaning, guiding them on a mysterious journey to discover a strange and wondrous sight near a distant mountain peak.|"[""1.
