In the past, New Mexico played a crucial role in sheep farming. The sheep were originally brought from Spain and traveled through Mexico to New Mexico and California. The cool hills of New Mexico provided the perfect climate for the sheep with their thick coats, and the lush grass served as their food source. During the day, the herds grazed, and at night they were kept in cedar corrals. Most of these sheep were Merinos, a breed from Spain. In 1853, William W. Hollister undertook a remarkable journey, bringing three hundred ewes to the West. The journey was challenging, with rivers to cross, mountains to climb, and the constant search for water sources. This marked the beginning of the western sheep-raising industry, which has now become a significant occupation in the country.|['1.

At Crescent Ranch, there is a debate between Tom Thornton and Jack Owen about the necessity of dipping the sheep after shearing. Thornton believes in maintaining the ranch's good reputation by following the tradition of washing the sheep to prevent diseases and ensure clean stock. On the other hand, Owen questions the need for the tiresome and dirty job of dipping, arguing that it may not be necessary if the sheep appear healthy. Despite Sandy's insistence on dipping the herd, Thornton asserts his authority as the current and future ranch manager.

Sheep are fascinating creatures, known for their unpredictable behavior. They can go from calm to chaotic in an instant, often stampeding off without reason. This erratic nature can lead to dangerous situations, like the tragic incident at 'Pile-Up Chasm' where a flock ran off a cliff in panic. Sheep, when frightened, don't make a sound but just run, risking their lives. To prevent such disasters, herds have wise leaders, usually older sheep or even goats, who guide the flock to safety. Unlike goats who can find their own food and water, sheep rely on these leaders to lead them to sustenance. It's a crucial role in keeping the flock safe and preventing unnecessary harm caused by their instinctive behavior.|"['1.

Sheep have a unique way of communicating and sticking together. They can sense a storm and won't graze when one is approaching. They make different sounds to alert the herd about water, especially if it's not safe to drink. Sheep are picky about their water! They have a strong instinct to follow each other, almost like playing games. One favorite game is 'Follow the Leader,' where they mimic the actions of a lead sheep. By following wiser sheep, they learn to stay safe. To keep track of the flock, markers like black-faced or unique-looking sheep are placed every hundred. If a marker goes missing, it signals that a group of sheep has strayed. Sheep are very particular about their place in the flock and will fight to keep their spot!|"['1.

Long ago, people roamed freely with their herds on the mountainsides, grazing their horses and sheep wherever grass was abundant. But conflicts arose between sheep and cattle herders. The cattlemen claimed that sheep ruined the land by eating grass too closely and spoiling water sources. In retaliation, cowboys scared and scattered the sheep, causing chaos. As more people joined the stock-raising business, the land suffered. Trees were destroyed, water sources polluted, and settlers were forced off their land. The government intervened by creating National Reserves and charging fees for grazing permits to protect the land and prevent environmental damage.

"Donald quickly responded as Sandy paused, ""I get it, father. It's fascinating, isn't it? But how can they stop unpermitted herders from grazing on the range?""

"An hour later, Donald bid farewell to his father and Thornton, setting off to the range with Sandy McCulloch. Two thousand sheep trailed behind them, guided by the dogs Robin, Prince Charlie, Colin, and Hector. Sandy led the way across open fields towards distant hills outlined in a blue haze, beyond which stood snow-capped mountains, the foot-hills of the Rockies. Donald marveled at the vast sky and the peaceful countryside, disrupted only by the sounds of the herd. Sandy, at home in this environment, guided the flock with ease, using his crook and the dogs to keep them in line. As they walked, Sandy explained the dangers of loco-weed to Donald, a plant that can make sheep dull and disoriented, comparing it to the effects of gas at the dentist.

When a person spends too much time alone and starts feeling dull and seeing things, like sheep, even when their eyes are closed, it's best to change the scenery. Some people can handle solitude, while others can't. In Wyoming, there's a law that herders must work in pairs and have traveling libraries to prevent them from staring at the sheep all day. However, some, like Sandy, enjoy the solitude. He keeps busy playing harmonica, carving, and looking after his dogs. At night, they must stay alert for nocturnal predators. After a satisfying meal of bacon and bread, they set up camp near a water-hole. Donald is amazed by the delicious meal and soon falls asleep in his sleeping bag, forgetting about the sheep and the range.|"['1.

At a high elevation, the sheep enjoyed the coolness of the July weather. They sought shelter in the forest shade or rested near the rocks. Donald and his father observed the sheep playing a game where one would stand on a boulder while others tried to replace it. This game helped the young lambs learn to follow and stay with the herd.

To safeguard the traders, rules are in place. Consider this: Eastern merchants travel far and are pressed for time. Imagine journeying to a distant ranch only to discover the owner won't sell or sets a high price. If someone truly doesn't wish to sell, they shouldn't invite buyers.

The journey of over twenty-five miles was a sheer delight for Thornton, who was not accustomed to the luxury of a modern automobile. The ranchman marveled at the smoothness of the ride, comparing it favorably to his past experiences with bumpy wagon rides. Arriving at the bustling Mortonstown mills, Thornton reluctantly left the car, looking forward to the return trip. Inside the mills, the sights and sounds of the machinery captivated him, overshadowing thoughts of the ride home. Mr. Clark then suggested a tour of the woolen mill for his son Donald and foreman Mr. Thornton, who were unfamiliar with such operations. The bookkeeper guided them through the sorting process, emphasizing the importance of cleanliness and care in preparing the wool for dyeing.|['Question 1:\nWhat prompted Mr. Clark to opt for a drive in his touring-car the following day?\nA) Rainy weather\nB) Clear weather\nC) Heavy traffic\nD) Train delay\nE) Snowfall', 'Question 2:\nHow did Thornton feel about the journey in the modern automobile?\nA) Disappointed\nB) Indifferent\nC) Anxious\nD) Delighted\nE) Frustrated', 'Question 3:\nWhat captivated Thornton inside the bustling Mortonstown mills?\nA) The smell of wool\nB) The sound of birds\nC) The machinery sights and sounds\nD) The taste of food\nE) The sight of flowers', 'Question 4:\nWhat did Mr. Clark suggest doing inside the mills?\nA) Going for a walk\nB) Taking a nap\nC) Touring the woolen mill\nD) Having lunch\nE) Leaving immediately', 'Question 5:\nWhat did the bookkeeper emphasize during the tour of the woolen mill?\nA) Importance of speed\nB) Importance of cleanliness and care\nC) Importance of noise\nD) Importance of darkness\nE) Importance of distractions', 'Question 6:\nWhat were Donald and Mr. Thornton unfamiliar with?\nA) Driving a car\nB) Sorting wool\nC) Dyeing wool\nD) Touring mills\nE) Riding a horse']|['B) Clear weather', 'D) Delighted', 'C) The machinery sights and sounds', 'C) Touring the woolen mill', 'B) Importance of cleanliness and care', 'B) Sorting wool']
The young man was feeling unwell, and Mr. Munger suggested a vacation out West to help. Moving on, they observed the dyeing process in the next room where centrifugal machines and revolving drums with spikes were used to keep the wool light and fluffy. The wool needed to be oiled to prevent it from becoming harsh and stiff, so they sprayed it evenly with olive oil. In another area, different qualities of wool were blended for specific effects, sometimes mixed with cotton or other fibers. The group then visited the carding room, where layers of wool were combed until the fibers aligned. The wool was then passed through drawing-frames to shape it for spinning. Mr. Munger explained how machines have replaced much of the manual labor in the process, making it more efficient.|['1.
