The large orchard was enclosed by a weathered fence, with tall fir trees at intervals. An evening wind sang through the trees, carrying a soulful melody. To the east, a dense fir wood rose like a green wall. Most of the orchard was lush with grass, but at one end was a treeless area that seemed like a former garden. Lilac trees blossomed in purple and white, surrounded by fragrant June lilies. Roses were yet to bloom. The charm of the orchard captivated Eric, drawing him in with its beauty. He walked through the avenue, adorned with delicate blooms, and settled by a lilac bush, enjoying the view of a distant house.

Eric found it challenging to forget the girl he saw in the orchard. Her face lingered in his thoughts, and the mystery surrounding her intrigued him. Although he could easily solve the puzzle by asking the Williamsons, he hesitated, fearing a flood of gossip. Eric decided to uncover the secret himself. He imagined the girl returning under the moonlight, but she didn't show up that evening. Disappointed, he scolded himself for getting so worked up over a brief encounter.

She didn't seem to share Eric's confidence. As they strolled through the orchard, her head drooped. At the start of the wild cherry lane, she halted, gazing at him with a hint of reproach, her eyes welling up once more. It felt like she was silently bidding him farewell.

"Neil, listen to me,” he said quietly. “You are talking very foolishly. It is not for you to say who shall or shall not be Kilmeny’s friend. Now, you may just as well control yourself and go home like a decent fellow. I am not at all frightened by your threats, and I shall know how to deal with you if you persist in interfering with me or persecuting Kilmeny.

Kilmeny lit the lamp and left the room. Shortly after, Eric met her eagerly, but she greeted him with a dignified handshake, avoiding eye contact.

Most of Eric's romantic moments were spent in the ancient orchard, now a garden of roses in various hues - red like a sunset, pink as dawn, white as mountain snow. Kilmeny's violin music filled the air as they dreamed among the petals. Eric was captivated by her musical talent, vowing to nurture it.

Eric wanted to help Kilmeny see her beauty, so he decided to bring a mirror to the house. Janet, who was hesitant at first, explained that mirrors had been removed years ago to prevent vanity. Despite Janet's reservations, Eric went ahead and bought a mirror, having it shipped to Radnor. Janet was concerned that the mirror might make Kilmeny vain. She shared that Kilmeny's mother, Margaret, had broken all the mirrors when she realized Kilmeny would be beautiful. Eric learned that Margaret's beauty had caused her pain and that Kilmeny did not resemble her. The mirror was a big one, and Janet hoped it wouldn't affect Kilmeny negatively.

When Eric brought back armfuls of white Madonna lilies to the house, Kilmeny was descending the narrow staircase with its striped carpet. The dark woodwork and shadows in the old hall highlighted her beauty. Kilmeny wore her mother's cream-colored dress, untouched by fashion trends. The dress suited her perfectly, with a slightly cut neck and long, flowing sleeves. Her braided hair was pinned like a crown, adorned with a white rose. Kilmeny was amazed by her reflection in the mirror, dropping the lilies in surprise. She questioned why her mother had never told her she was beautiful. Eric explained that sometimes beauty brings challenges. They decided to enjoy the sunset in the orchard, leaving the mirror behind to avoid vanity.

"That evening, Kilmeny sneaked into the parlor to catch another glimpse of herself in the magical mirror, lit by a flickering candle. Lost in her reflection, Aunt Janet's stern face suddenly appeared in the shadows. ""Are you admiring your looks, dear?

Kilmeny had been listening with her face turned away. She blushed at first, then grew very pale. When Eric finished speaking and awaited her response, she withdrew her hands, covered her face, and began to cry silently.“Kilmeny, my dearest, have I upset you? You knew I loved you, didn’t you? Do you not feel the same?” Eric asked, embracing her. She sadly shook her head and wrote, “No, it's not right. Marrying you without speaking would harm you. I love you too much to do that.

"""Do not come any more, Eric,"" the letter read. ""I must not see you, because it would only make it harder for us both. You must go away and forget me. You will be thankful for this some day. I shall always love and pray for you.""

Eric felt compelled to return home with no better comfort than these words. The next morning, being Sunday, he drove David Baker to the station. Eric, having not slept, appeared miserable and reckless, causing David to worry. Despite wanting to stay in Lindsay, a critical case in Queenslea required David's immediate attention. Before departing, David shook Eric's hand.

""Master, I like you, and I'm sorry Kilmeny feels as she does, though perhaps she is right. I would be glad to see you often for your own sake, and I'll miss you greatly. But as things stand, I tell you plainly, you'd better not come here anymore. It will do no good, and the sooner you both move on, the better. Go now, lad, and God bless you.""

Eric returned home with a pale, distressed face. He had never imagined such suffering was possible. The thought of life without Kilmeny seemed unbearable.

On a quiet Tuesday afternoon, a funeral in the district led to the closure of the school. Eric found himself drawn back to the old orchard, though he did not expect to find Kilmeny there. As he wandered through the familiar paths, memories of their time together haunted him. The orchard, once vibrant with flowers, now showed signs of the changing season. Eric's thoughts were interrupted by the sight of Neil Gordon working on a fence nearby. Despite their past differences, Eric felt a newfound sympathy for Neil, realizing they both shared a common pain. Lost in his thoughts, Eric did not notice Kilmeny's approach until she stood before him, her eyes reflecting the sorrow and resilience she had acquired in a short span of time. The orchard, like Kilmeny herself, held a timeless beauty that transcended its fading appearance.|['1.

Kilmeny walked slowly through the lane, lost in her thoughts like she was dreaming. As she reached the gap in the fence leading to the orchard, she saw Eric sitting with his head bowed in the shadow of the wood. Suddenly, she noticed Neil Gordon standing behind Eric, looking tense and holding something in his hand. Kilmeny knew she had to warn Eric, even though time was running out. With a surge of determination, she sprinted towards Eric through the gap. Startled, Eric turned to see Neil with an axe, frozen in shock. Neil, overcome with terror, fled into the shadows. Kilmeny, now able to speak, reassured everyone that she could communicate. She expressed her newfound ability with joy, her voice clear and musical, promising to master its modulation soon.|"[""1.

Eric had almost forgotten about Neil in his overwhelming amazement and joy. The realization of his escape from sudden and violent death had not yet had any opportunity to take possession of his thoughts. “We must forgive him, Mr. Gordon. I know how I should feel towards a man who took Kilmeny from me. It was an evil impulse to which he gave way in his suffering--and think of the good which has resulted from it.” “That is true, Master, but it does not alter the terrible fact that the boy had murder in his heart,--that he would have killed you. An over-ruling Providence has saved him from the actual commission of the crime and brought good out of evil; but he is guilty in thought and purpose. And we have cared for him and instructed him as our own--with all his faults we have loved him! It is a hard thing, and I do not see what we are to do. We cannot act as if nothing had happened. We can never trust him again.” But Neil Gordon solved the problem himself. When Eric returned that night he found old Robert Williamson in the pantry regaling himself with a lunch of bread and cheese after a trip to the station. Timothy sat on the dresser in black velvet state and gravely addressed himself to the disposal of various tid-bits that came his way. “Good night, Master.

"Eric quickly thought about the situation. He felt relieved that Neil had left for good. It was best for everyone. He knew he had to tell Old Robert part of the truth about Kilmeny's newfound ability to speak. Eric informed Mr. Williamson about the incident at the Gordon place and how Kilmeny was now able to speak perfectly due to the shock caused by Neil's behavior.

Mr. Williamson was astonished by the news and agreed that it was for the best that Neil had left. Eric decided to finish teaching until the fall vacation in October before returning home. Kilmeny had promised to marry Eric in the spring, as she wanted to become more comfortable around people. Although Eric wanted an earlier wedding, Kilmeny felt she needed more time to prepare and learn before getting married.

Mr. Marshall, Senior, replied to the letter in person. A few days later, Eric found his father at Mrs. Williamson’s neat parlor. The topic of Eric's letter wasn't broached until after tea. Alone, Mr. Marshall abruptly questioned Eric about a girl. He expressed concerns about her background and suitability to be Eric's wife, emphasizing the importance of finding someone like Eric's late mother. Mr. Marshall mentioned a mysterious visit by David Baker, hinting at a connection to the girl. He advised Eric to be cautious and not rush into anything.
