Despite his injured arm, Ben Haley managed to row the boat to the other side of the river. Blood was slowly seeping from his wound, staining his shirt red. At first, the pain didn't bother him due to the excitement, but it soon started to ache. Ben harbored animosity towards the boy who caused his injury, muttering curses. However, the gold in his pocket brought some comfort. On the other hand, the boy, a farmer's son, was thrilled with the unexpected money. He hurried to buy a junior ball, leaving Ben to ruin the boat in revenge. Ben maliciously damaged the boat, relishing his act of vengeance.

Ben boarded the train hastily, leaving behind the doctor he needed. As the train departed, he felt relieved, speeding away from the man he wronged. Meanwhile, Halbert, unhappy despite his wealth, sought a boat like Will's but was denied by his father due to financial worries. Frustrated, Halbert found Robert's boat damaged. Instead of asking for it, he plotted revenge by reporting Robert's neglect to Mr. Paine. Along the way, he met Hester Paine, hoping to impress her. Halbert's plan to harm Robert showed his envy and vindictiveness, setting the stage for a clash between the two boys.|"['1.

Hester Paine was displeased with the meeting. Her brother had told her about the quarrel between Halbert and Robert. Halbert sought revenge by getting Robert fired from the factory. Hester favored Robert, making her dislike Halbert more. Halbert, selfish and not in love, admired Hester and was determined to win her over despite her coldness. When questioned about the damage at the factory, Halbert denied involvement, causing suspicion. As Halbert left, Robert, troubled, passed by. Robert, nearly broke, depended on fishing to support his family. His boat, damaged, left him in a tough spot. He felt obligated to inform Mr. Paine about the boat's condition. Despite his reluctance, Robert knew he had to do his duty. He also wanted to find Ben Haley, who had caused him trouble. But Ben Haley had fled, evading justice for the time being.|"[""1.

Robert headed to Mr. Paine's office after finishing his task. As he approached, he unexpectedly encountered Halbert Davis at the entrance. Halbert commended Robert for his bravery in defending Mr. Nichols and offered to cover the expenses. Robert left feeling relieved. Walking on, he crossed paths with Halbert again, who seemed eager to gloat about the boat's ruin. Despite Mrs. Rushton's pessimism, Robert possessed his father's courage and determination. He suggested picking blueberries on Sligo Hill to earn money. Equipped with pails, he gathered eight quarts of berries. Robert sold some to Mr. Paine and encountered Hester. Unfazed by his appearance, he rang her doorbell. Robert earned forty cents and had berries left to sell.

Halbert watched the boy, Robert, with disdain as he walked with Hester Paine after the concert. Robert, a humble berry seller, was proud and unbothered by Halbert's sneers. The next day, as Robert walked home with pails of berries, he discovered a dangerous rock on the railroad track. With a train fast approaching, Robert tried to move the rock to avert disaster. Despite his efforts, the rock wouldn't budge. As the train neared, Robert desperately tried to push the rock away, knowing the risk to his own life. He waved his handkerchief and shouted, hoping to alert the engineer.

At first, the boy, Robert Rushton, went unnoticed. When the engineer finally saw him, he felt angry at what he saw as the boy's recklessness. The engineer slowed down, expecting the boy to move, but Robert stood firm, his nerves on edge not just for himself but for the danger he feared he couldn't prevent. Reluctantly, the engineer signaled to stop the train, just in time. With only thirty-five feet between the train and Robert, he stepped aside, pale but resolute. As passengers questioned the stop, they were shocked by a rock on the tracks. The passengers, grateful for Robert's bravery, quickly raised over six hundred dollars as a token of their appreciation.

The passengers rushed onto the train, leaving our hero on the platform holding a handful of money and a card from a New York merchant. In just fifteen minutes, Robert's luck had drastically changed. As he watched the train disappear, he marveled at the money in his hand. Sitting down, he carefully counted the bills and secured them in his pocket. This newfound wealth was a novelty for him. Later, he encountered Halbert, who accused him of theft out of envy. Despite Halbert's attempts to ruin him, Robert's fortunes had taken a turn for the better. He then shared the story of his heroic act with his mother, who was deeply moved. Robert decided to entrust the money to Mr. Paine for safekeeping and planned to repair a boat as a gesture of gratitude. Despite his modesty, Robert's actions were met with appreciation by Mr. Paine, who invited him for dinner, bringing Robert great joy, especially given Halbert's attempts to undermine him.|"['1.

Robert's actions were driven by a sense of honor and generosity. Despite Halbert's jealousy, Robert's conscience was clear, and he had the respect of those he valued.

The letter, received by his mother, contained vital information about the ship's fate. The _Argo_ found a bottle with messages from the _Norman's_ crew, offering a glimpse into the tragic event.

My dear wife and son, I write these lines on this sheet of paper with uncertainty if they will ever reach you. Three months ago, the ship Norman, which I sailed from Boston, was engulfed in flames, leaving me adrift at sea with five sailors, our food supply limited. The chances of survival seem slim, far from any known land, hoping for rescue by another passing ship. I have a pencil and paper to pen down my plight, though the odds of you reading this are slim. The ship's first mate, Haley, bore ill will towards me, eventually setting the ship ablaze out of spite. His act of revenge has left us stranded, his fate unknown in a small boat.|"['1.

When the ship was beyond saving, we quickly loaded the remaining boats with provisions. Now, after a day adrift at sea, a storm could spell disaster. In this solemn moment, my thoughts turn to my wife and son, whom I may never see again. Before my voyage, I entrusted $5,000 to Mr. Davis for you. If this letter reaches you, and he hasn't given you the money, have Robert claim it. I trust Mr. Davis, but regret not telling you earlier. Robert and his mother were moved by the letter.

Robert left the office, leaving Mr. Davis uneasy. The receipt was lost at sea, and without proof, his claim for the money was weak. If the letter surfaced, Robert's reputation would suffer.

Robert was on a mission to find a better life. He had a humble stock of clothing and a treasured Bible from his father. When a boy named Jim tried to steal his bag, Robert forgave him, hoping he wouldn't be dishonest again. Jim's mother mistook Robert for a customer, but Robert's honesty won her over. He then met a merchant who promised to help him with his plans. The merchant gave Robert his address and invited him to dinner to discuss his future.

Robert felt a sense of accomplishment as he left the office, pleased with the warm welcome he received. He believed Mr. Morgan, a wealthy man, could offer valuable assistance. Excited by the prospect, Robert thought about informing his mother of his progress. Later that evening, he arrived at a grand house on Fifth Avenue, feeling a bit nervous as he was ushered in by a servant. Despite the opulent surroundings, Robert preferred a simpler home like his mother's or the superintendent's house. Mr. Morgan welcomed him warmly, putting him at ease during dinner. The merchant offered Robert a free passage on his ship to Calcutta, allowing him to search for his father. Robert's preparations for the voyage were aided by Mrs. Morgan, who provided him with a trunk of supplies. As he boarded the ship, Robert was startled to recognize Ben Haley, the mate he had encountered before.|"['1.

If Robert was surprised, Ben Haley had even more reason for astonishment. He had assumed his young foe was quietly living in the village of Millville. Meeting him aboard a ship bound for India was unexpected. Robert was unpleasantly surprised, but the mate was secretly pleased to have him in his power. Robert was relieved not to be a cabin-boy, foreseeing mistreatment from the mate. As a passenger, he felt independent despite having the mate as an enemy. Ben Haley intended to question the captain about Robert's unexpected presence. Captain Evans decided to observe Robert closely due to the mate's opinion. Ben Haley aimed to befriend Robert to secure his silence and learn his motives. Robert doubted Ben's story due to his past. Ben admitted to his questionable actions but justified them due to his belief in justice over strict legality.|"[""1.

Two years prior, five men, including Captain Rushton and four sailors from the ship Norman, were stranded at sea, facing hunger and thirst. Bunsby, one of the sailors, shared his longing for his mother's warm tea. Captain Rushton confided in Bunsby about his worries for his wife and son, having entrusted his savings to a man in his village before the voyage. The captain feared that without the receipt, his family might suffer if he didn't return. Despite Bunsby's reassurance, Captain Rushton remained anxious about his family's welfare.

Twenty-four hours had gone by. The small boat continued to sway on the waves of the ocean. The five weary faces now appeared more worn out, with a desperate hope in their eyes as they searched the horizon for a passing ship. Their mouths and throats were dry and parched. Two sailors, ignoring the warnings of Bunsby and the captain, followed Jack's lead, seeking temporary relief but soon succumbing to unbearable torment. Captain Rushton and Bunsby, suffering themselves, looked upon their distressed companions with pity. A sudden downpour brought some respite, saturating their clothes and filling the boat with water. They managed to collect the precious water in two remaining bottles. Though the relief was short-lived, a glimmer of hope persisted in their hearts. The boat was soon approached by the crew of the ill-fated _Norman_. Captain Rushton and Bunsby appeared lifeless, with Bunsby confirmed to have passed away. The captain, although alive, was in critical condition and required urgent medical attention. Despite his physical recovery, Captain Rushton's mind regressed to a childlike state, devoid of memory of his identity, family, or past. The receipt in his possession, containing vital information, went unnoticed, leaving him nameless and lost upon reaching Calcutta. The dilemma of what to do with him was resolved by a generous American merchant in Calcutta, who offered to provide care and support for the captain, hoping for his full|['1.

The generous merchant's offer was gratefully accepted, and Captain Rushton found a new home in Mrs. Start's boarding-house. Mrs. Start, a widow who had opened the boarding-house with the help of the merchant, was commended for her care. Captain Rushton, now known as Mr. Smith, recovered physically but remained mentally unwell. Despite his condition, he was well looked after in Calcutta. Meanwhile, Robert, on the ship, faced challenges with Ben Haley, his enemy. Robert's refusal to reconcile with Haley was due to a past injury. Captain Evans and Robert had a good relationship, discussing various topics. Haley, though harboring ill feelings, did not act on them, leading Robert to lower his guard. Robert's friendly demeanor made him popular among the sailors, who respected him for his connection to the owner.|"[""1.

Among the crew, one young sailor stood out for his loyalty and dedication: Frank Price, a fourteen-year-old cabin-boy. At first, Frank struggled with seasickness, and Captain Evans kindly excused him from duty until he recovered. As the voyage progressed, tragedy struck when Captain Evans fell seriously ill with a fever. Despite the efforts of the ship's surgeon, the captain's condition worsened, eventually leading to his untimely death. While most mourned the loss of the beloved captain, Ben Haley, now in command, saw an opportunity to advance his own agenda. Observing the friendship between Frank and another passenger, Robert, Haley plotted to use it against Robert, whom he viewed as a threat. As tensions rose on board, Haley's true colors began to show, setting the stage for a brewing conflict.|"['1.

The ship sailed through a storm, forcing the captain to halt the punishment of the cabin-boy, Frank Price. Bates, a kind sailor, stood up against the captain's harsh ways, refusing to flog the boy. A sudden blast hit the ship, diverting everyone's attention to securing the vessel. The storm damaged the ship's rigging, but the crew managed to navigate through it. As the storm calmed, the ship reached a small island. The captain decided on an exploration expedition, allowing the crew to rest near the boat. Robert, excited to step on foreign land for the first time, marveled at the untouched nature of the island. The exotic birds and fruit-bearing trees added to the allure of the uncharted territory, making Robert contemplate living there briefly if rescued afterward.|"[""1.

Robert strolled until he reached a small valley. He went down the hill and sat under a shady tree. The grass was soft, and he wanted to rest there all day. But he had limited time. The captain instructed him to return in an hour. The captain tied Robert to a tree with a strong cord he had brought. Robert feared his fate, but he tried to reason with the captain. Despite being bound, Robert stood up bravely and warned the captain that he would regret his actions. When the crew realized Robert was left behind, only Bates dared to protest. Bates suspected the captain's plan and decided to search for Robert on the island. He needed a boat, so he waited for the captain to go below deck before taking action. The captain did not pursue Robert to avoid the truth coming out. Bates hurried to prepare the boat and set off from the island with two fewer passengers.|"[""1.

After the captain departed, Robert struggled to free himself from the tight cords that bound him. The fear of dying in such a situation was overwhelming as thoughts of his mother waiting for him in vain crept into his mind. Exhausted from his efforts, despair washed over him, and tears welled up. The idea of his mother suffering alone haunted him. With renewed determination, he attempted to untie the cord with his teeth, making slow progress. In a moment of rest, he heard his name called. Surprised, he thought he was alone on the island. To his relief, Bates, his companion, appeared. Together, they built a shelter and explored the island, enjoying the lush vegetation and sweet fruit. Despite the challenges of limited food, they persevered, seeking more variety in their diet.|"[""1.

Robert and Bates rigged fishing lines with hooks they found, then rowed out to sea in a boat. They caught four fish, cooked them over a fire they made by rubbing sticks together. Robert enjoyed the adventure, but as days passed without rescue, he worried about his mom. After six weeks, they saw an American ship and rowed to it. The captain praised Robert's courage and offered help. Bates, empathizing with Robert's past struggles, refused payment. The captain criticized Haley, promising Robert a better future.|"['1.

Finally arriving in Calcutta, Robert and Captain Smith found lodging at Mrs. Start's house. To their surprise, Captain Rushton, still going by the name Smith, was also a guest there. Despite physical improvement, Captain Rushton still struggled mentally from a past shock. During dinner, Robert was stunned to realize that Captain Smith was his long-lost father. The revelation caused a stir among the other boarders. To avoid public explanations, dinner was sent to Captain Rushton's room where father and son shared their stories. Captain Rushton's mental health had remarkably improved since reuniting with Robert. As they sailed back to New York on the _Superior_, Captain Haley, the man responsible for their past misfortunes, encountered Captain Rushton in Calcutta, mistaking him for someone else due to their striking resemblance.

The merchant expressed his condolences for the late Captain Evans, praising his worthiness. He inquired about Captain Haley, the new leader of the ship. The conversation shifted to Robert's experience under Captain Haley's command. Haley, feeling the merchant's coldness towards him, voiced concerns about Robert's behavior and alleged theft.

Life in Millville continued as usual. Mrs. Rushton managed the money Robert left with the lawyer wisely. She earned extra by braiding straw, adding to her income. She saved every penny, expecting Robert to return empty-handed. No letter came from him since he set sail for Calcutta, causing her worry. Mr. Paine reassured her about the irregularity of letters. Meanwhile, Mr. Davis, the factory superintendent, had a stroke of luck in the stock market, making a significant profit. His wife was surprised by his change of heart towards spending. Halbert collided with a sunburned boy at the door, who turned out to be Robert, back with their father from Calcutta.

When Captain Rushton visited the superintendent, the latter greeted him awkwardly, aware that the captain knew about his dishonesty. The superintendent tried to delay payment, but the captain insisted on immediate restitution. The superintendent had lost trust in Mr. Davis and wanted to reclaim his money. Luckily, the superintendent had recently made a successful investment, allowing him to repay the full amount of nearly six thousand dollars. Meanwhile, an investigative committee uncovered Mr. Davis's embezzlement scheme, leading to his disappearance and leaving his family in financial distress.
