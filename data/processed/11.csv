"Chapter I: Alice's Adventure Begins

Alice found herself growing weary of idly sitting by the riverbank next to her sister, who was engrossed in a book devoid of any pictures or engaging conversations. Pondering the value of a book without such elements, she contemplated whether making a daisy chain would be more rewarding. Suddenly, a peculiar White Rabbit with pink eyes dashed past her, murmuring about being late and pulling out a watch from its waistcoat pocket. Intrigued, Alice decided to follow the rabbit down a rabbit hole hidden under a hedge. The tunnel-like hole descended abruptly, and Alice fell slowly, observing cupboards, bookshelves, maps, and pictures lining the well's walls. Despite the fall, Alice maintained a curious and brave demeanor, speculating about the distance she had traveled and pondering latitude and longitude, showcasing her knowledge gained from school lessons."|['Question 1: What was Alice doing by the riverbank before encountering the White Rabbit?\nA) Reading a book\nB) Making a daisy chain\nC) Drawing pictures\nD) Playing with her sister\nE) None of the above', 'Question 2: How did Alice feel when she saw the White Rabbit with pink eyes?\nA) Scared\nB) Bored\nC) Curious\nD) Angry\nE) Sad', 'Question 3: What did the White Rabbit do as it rushed past Alice?\nA) Ate a carrot\nB) Pulled out a watch\nC) Sang a song\nD) Danced a jig\nE) None of the above', 'Question 4: What did Alice observe on the walls as she fell down the rabbit hole?\nA) Cupboards\nB) Bookshelves\nC) Maps\nD) Pictures\nE) All of the above', 'Question 5: How did Alice behave during her fall down the rabbit hole?\nA) Fearful\nB) Curious\nC) Annoyed\nD) Sad\nE) Bored', 'Question 6: What knowledge did Alice showcase while falling down the rabbit hole?\nA) Chemistry\nB) Geography\nC) History\nD) Mathematics\nE) None of the above']|['B) Making a daisy chain', 'C) Curious', 'B) Pulled out a watch', 'E) All of the above', 'B) Curious', 'B) Geography']

Alice held the fan and gloves, fanning herself in the hot hall, pondering, “How odd everything is today! Was I changed overnight? Who am I now?” She doubted being Ada or Mabel. Trying math and geography, she felt lost. Tears welled up, thinking she must be Mabel. She decided to stay put. Shrinking, she realized the fan caused it, dropping it just in time. Relieved, she found herself still there. Running to the garden, she found the door shut, feeling smaller than ever. Frustrated, she saw the golden key on the table, exclaiming, “This is just too much!”|"['1.

Alice found herself submerged in a pool of her own tears, feeling lost and disoriented. She noticed a mouse nearby and attempted to communicate with it, unsure if it would understand her. The mouse seemed startled by her attempts to speak and swam away hastily. Trying to make amends, Alice shared stories about her cat and a dog she knew, hoping to engage the mouse in conversation. However, her efforts only seemed to upset the mouse further, causing it to flee. Alice realized that her attempts at conversation were not going as planned and decided to change the subject, asking the mouse if it liked dogs.

Alice called out softly to the Mouse, asking it to come back and promising not to discuss cats or dogs. The Mouse, looking pale and agitated, agreed to share its history once they reached the shore. As the pool filled with various creatures, including a Duck, Dodo, Lory, and Eaglet, Alice led them all to dry land. They deliberated on how to dry off and soon Alice found herself conversing comfortably with the animals. The Mouse, taking charge, declared they would soon be dry. Sitting in a circle, the Mouse began reciting a dry historical account, causing confusion among the listeners. The Eaglet demanded simpler language, prompting the Mouse to continue its tale. Eventually, the Dodo declared everyone a winner, and Alice distributed prizes, ending with cheers from the group.|['1.

"Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so serious that she did not dare to laugh. She simply bowed and took the thimble, trying to look as serious as she could. The next task was to eat the treats, which caused some commotion. The large birds complained they couldn't taste theirs, while the small ones choked and needed help. After the chaos settled, they sat down in a circle and asked the Mouse for more stories. Alice was puzzled by the Mouse's sad tail. As she pondered, the Mouse shared a tale about Fury and a mouse going to court. The Lory sighed when the mouse disappeared, and the Crab advised its daughter not to lose her temper. Alice eagerly talked about her cat, Dinah, causing a stir among the birds, who quickly left. Alice felt lonely and missed Dinah. Just then, the White Rabbit returned, muttering about the Duchess and lost items. Alice, mistaken for Mary Ann, hurried to find the fan and gloves. She stumbled upon a house with the name ""W.

Alice found herself in a peculiar situation. She had drunk from a mysterious bottle and was now growing uncontrollably. As she expanded, she struggled to find space in the room and even attempted to escape through the window and chimney. Despite her efforts, she continued to grow until she was too large to move. Frustrated and unhappy, Alice longed for the simplicity of her home. She reflected on her adventures, feeling like she was living in a fairy tale. Suddenly, the Rabbit's voice interrupted her thoughts, causing her to panic. As the Rabbit approached, Alice, forgetting her enormous size, tried to fend it off.

"After a long silence, Alice overheard whispers like, ""I don't like it, yer honour!"" and ""Do as I tell you, you coward!"" Suddenly, there were two little shrieks and the sound of broken glass. Alice pondered the number of cucumber-frames there must be. She wished they would pull her out of the window. Eventually, she heard the rumbling of cartwheels and many voices discussing ladders and the roof. Bill was instructed to go down the chimney, which made Alice think they relied on Bill for everything. She decided to kick a little down the chimney. There was chaos as they tried to catch Bill. Alice ate a cake that made her shrink, allowing her to escape the house. Outside, she encountered a crowd of animals and birds. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was being tended to by guinea pigs.

Alice found herself lost in a mysterious wood, trying to figure out how to grow back to her right size and find a way into a beautiful garden. As she pondered her predicament, she encountered a playful but large puppy that made her quite nervous. Despite her fear, she engaged in a playful game with the puppy, using a stick to keep it entertained. Eventually, she managed to escape and continued her journey through the wood. In her exploration, she stumbled upon a large mushroom and discovered a caterpillar sitting atop it, smoking a hookah. Curiosity piqued, Alice attempted to converse with the caterpillar, who cryptically hinted at changes to come. As Alice pondered the caterpillar's words, she noticed that the mushroom had different sides that could make her grow taller or shorter.

Alice was delighted to find her head free at last, but her joy turned to alarm when she realized her shoulders were missing. Looking down, all she saw was a long neck rising from a sea of green leaves below. Puzzled, she wondered where her shoulders had gone and why she couldn't see her hands. Trying to bend her neck to see her hands, she discovered it was flexible like a serpent's. As she attempted to reach her hands, a pigeon flew into her face, causing her to recoil. The pigeon accused her of being a serpent, leading to a comical exchange. Eventually, Alice remembered the mushroom she held, nibbled on it, and returned to her normal size. She then encountered a small house and saw footmen delivering an invitation for the Duchess to play croquet. Amused, Alice laughed and retreated into the wood.|"[""1.

The Footman explained that knocking wouldn't work for two reasons: he was on the same side of the door, and there was a loud commotion inside. The noise was a mix of howling, sneezing, and crashing dishes. The Footman mentioned that knocking would make sense if they were on opposite sides. Inside, the kitchen was smoky with the Duchess nursing a baby and the cook stirring soup. The Duchess and the baby were sneezing and howling, while the cook started throwing objects around. Alice tried to divert the conversation, but chaos ensued as the cook threw things at the Duchess and the baby. Alice caught the baby, which she found challenging to handle.

The baby grunted once more, and Alice peered into its face with concern. The nose was turning up oddly, resembling more of a snout than a nose, and its eyes were shrinking rapidly. Alice found the appearance unsettling, thinking it resembled more of a pig than a baby. As she pondered whether it was sobbing, she noticed the absence of tears. Alice warned the baby that she would have nothing to do with it if it turned into a pig. The baby grunted again, and Alice, alarmed, realized it had indeed transformed into a pig.

The Mad Hatter sadly shook his head and mentioned a quarrel with the March Hare before he went mad. Alice, puzzled, turned to the Dormouse to ask why they lived at the bottom of a well. The Dormouse replied rudely, causing Alice to leave in disgust. She found a door in a tree leading to a beautiful garden where gardeners were painting white roses red to avoid the Queen's wrath. As Alice watched, the gardeners bowed to her, fearing the Queen's arrival. Soldiers, courtiers, royal children, and guests followed, including the White Rabbit and the King and Queen of Hearts.|"['1.

Alice hesitated about following the gardeners' example of lying down, unsure if it was proper. She reasoned that if everyone lay down during a procession, they wouldn't be able to see it. So, she stood still and waited. The Queen, unable to distinguish the gardeners from others, ordered their beheading. Alice intervened, saving them by hiding them in a flower-pot. The Rabbit warned Alice that the Queen had sentenced her to execution for boxing her ears. The chaotic croquet game with live hedgehogs and flamingo mallets ensued, with the Queen threatening beheadings left and right. Feeling uneasy, Alice sought an escape but noticed the Cheshire Cat's grin in the air, offering her company. The Cat's head appeared, and Alice shared her frustrations about the unfair game. As the Queen's anger escalated, Alice decided to return to the game, finding chaos and confusion.|"['1.

When Alice returned to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to see a large crowd gathered around. A dispute was unfolding between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, all speaking at once. They turned to Alice for help, each repeating their arguments simultaneously, making it difficult for her to understand. The executioner argued that you can't cut off a head without a body, refusing to do so at his age. The Queen threatened to execute everyone if the issue wasn't resolved quickly. As chaos ensued, the Cat's head vanished, sending the King and the executioner on a frantic search. Meanwhile, the Queen ordered more executions. Eventually, the Queen left Alice with the Gryphon to visit the Mock Turtle, while she attended to her orders. Alice felt uneasy but decided to stay with the Gryphon.|"['1.

After a long silence, the Mock Turtle began to share a story about going to school in the sea when he was little. The Gryphon interrupted Alice, scolding her for asking a simple question. The Mock Turtle continued, mentioning subjects like Mystery and Seaography. He described their Drawling-master, an old conger-eel, who taught them Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils. The Mock Turtle got emotional, reminiscing about living under the sea and the joy of a Lobster Quadrille dance. The creatures then danced solemnly around Alice, singing a slow and sad song. The Mock Turtle shared about lobsters and turtles waiting on the shingle for the dance. The whiting invited the snail to join, but the snail declined, saying there is another shore to reach. The Mock Turtle explained how lobsters have their tails in their mouths, but before he could finish, he yawned and closed his eyes.|"['1.

"Alice rushed to the court where the King and Queen of Hearts sat on their throne. A crowd gathered around them, including birds, beasts, and cards. The Knave stood chained with guards, while the White Rabbit held a trumpet and parchment. In the center, tarts sat on a table, making Alice hungry. As she observed the court, she recognized the judge, the King, and the jury. Alice noticed the jurors writing on slates, one even struggling to spell ""stupid."" Annoyed by a squeaking pencil, Alice took it from a juror. The Hatter, the first witness, nervously fumbled with a teacup and bread.
