Arabella and Araminta had their favorite balls, one red and one blue, attached to long strings. They played with their balls, rolling them for their white and black kitties to chase. Their loving parents tucked them in, kissed them goodnight, and sang lullabies. Penny, the dog, and the kittens Snowdrop and Thistledown also wanted to bid Baby Ray goodnight. The three little bunnies joined in, all making sure Baby Ray was safe and sound. As the geese sailed on the duck-pond, they too checked on Baby Ray before bedtime. Everyone in the house, from the children to the pets, made sure Baby Ray was asleep before they settled down for the night.|['1.

At bedtime, we find comfort with our loving mothers singing lullabies by our side, as the room darkens and we drift off to sleep. Playing by our father's knees in the evening is filled with joy, unlike the birds or lambs in the fields. The Sandman, with his bag of shining sand, visits children with eyes of blue, black, gray, and brown, gently coaxing them to sleep. His boat gathers sand from distant shores where no storm dares to disturb. When naughty children cry, he sprinkles gray sand to calm their restless eyes. So, when the Sandman's song whispers in the twilight, it's time to rest and let his magic sand bring dreams. And as we snuggle close to daddy by the warm fire, tales of fairy folk who dance under the moonlight fill our minds. The fairies, with their silver bells and crimson moth rides, visit children as they sleep, bestowing sweet dreams and tender kisses. So, little ones, snuggle close, for the fairy folk may visit you tonight.|"[""1.

Once upon a time, a Hare raced against Hedgehogs. Despite running back and forth 73 times, the Hedgehogs always beat him to the finish line. Exhausted, the Hare collapsed on the course. The Hedgehog couple claimed their prize and left. Meanwhile, a wee Robin sang for the King, earning a reward. The wee Robin then married a Wren, and they all danced at the wedding. The Fox and his wife enjoyed a meal together. A baby, a dog, and a person go on walks together, undeterred by weather. The Spider tried to lure a Fly into its parlor, but the Fly cleverly declined the offer.

Dorothea was thrilled to find her new large leather satchel with her monogram hanging on the rack. Excitedly, she waved goodbye to her family and ran off to school. Doris received a five-dollar bill from her papa, which she exchanged at the bank for two two-dollar bills and a silver dollar. She then made various purchases, including a paint-box, rubber balloons, and candy. Unfortunately, the paint-box was of poor quality, the candy was inedible, and the balloons deflated. Doris learned a valuable lesson about spending wisely. With her mama's guidance, they bought a discounted book of animal stories and saved up for a pair of roller skates. Doris realized the importance of making smart choices with her money.|"['1.
