Two boys left their aeronautical workshop in an upper-level garage, where they had been working on their big Golden Eagle aeroplane. They were now focused on building a motor-sledge for an upcoming expedition. Despite the cold weather in late November, they hurried to the Erie Basin, a bustling area filled with cargo being loaded onto a three-masted steamer. The place was chaotic, with cases labeled for the U.S. South Polar Expedition being loaded onto the vessel. The boys, having been recruited as aviators for this expedition to the South Pole, were excited to be part of the loading process. They were joined by Captain Hazzard, who had spearheaded their involvement in the expedition. After some initial confusion, the boys were given overalls and put to work tallying the cargo. Although they had hoped for a leisurely exploration of the ship, they quickly realized they had to get to work. The boys were intrigued by the ship's history as a former whaler, evident in the lingering smell of oil and blubber. They were led to the warm engine-room and then to Captain Hazzard's cabin to change into their work attire.|['1.

The previous ship, the Eben A. Thayer, was spacious and well-equipped for the officers on board. The living quarters included cabins for Captain Hazzard, the chief engineer Gavin MacKenzie, Professor Simeon Sandburr, and the ship's surgeon, Dr. Watson Gregg. The boys and other crew members had their cabins arranged on the opposite side. The ship was a three-masted vessel with a cro' nest on the mainmast. It had ample coal storage for an extended range and was rigged to use sails efficiently. The forecastle was redesigned to be comfortable, with bunks and a table. The deck was filled with various supplies like sledges, tents, rope, and tools. Inside the hold, labeled partitions stored supplies securely. The ship was also equipped with modern machinery for the upcoming polar expedition. Captain Hazzard and the boys inspected the ship, learning about its history and preparations for the journey.|"[""1.

Through their secret service, the Japanese government was likely informed about the expedition. While discussing this, a crash interrupted the conversation as the Japanese steward, unheard due to his soft slippers, dropped a metal tray behind them. The steward's vexation was evident. Frank questioned the trustworthiness of the steward. The boys promised to have their aeroplane ready for shipping the next day. As they were preparing the aeroplane, Billy Barnes, a young reporter, shared news about a Japanese man who was arrested the previous night near his country's consulate. The boys were heading to the South Pole, and there was a mysterious aspect that Harry mentioned. Billy was intrigued by this development and was eager to uncover the story behind the Japanese man's arrest.|"['1. What interrupted the conversation between the boys and the steward?\nA.

The courtroom was packed as the boys entered, using Billy's police card to pass through a rail separating the main area from where the magistrate sat. Frank shared his phone call with Captain Hazzard about the missing Oyama, who had stolen important expedition papers. Frank suspected Oyama was the man Billy was investigating. The Jap looked dazed, possibly due to drugs. Dr. McGuire, the prison surgeon, explained the situation. They found stolen papers, likely belonging to Captain Hazzard. Frank found a document mentioning a Viking ship, but he didn't read more out of respect. The Jap was sentenced to Blackwell's Island. The boys left, discussing their unexpected adventure and Billy's envy of their upcoming journey.|"['1.

Frank chuckled at Harry's sudden enthusiasm for the unexpected journey. Billy, overwhelmed by the invitation, hesitated. Frank suggested they bring Billy along to meet Captain Hazzard at Erie Basin. The plan was to inform the captain about the recovered papers and plead Billy's case. The captain agreed to take Billy on board as part of the crew. Excited but trying to maintain composure, Billy struggled with conflicting emotions, causing a burst of laughter among the crew. A week later, the Southern Cross was set to sail, meeting a coal-ship at Monte Video to conserve fuel. The crew prepared for a journey to the Antarctic, with a relief ship planned in case they were trapped by winter. As the Southern Cross left the harbor, the boys watched in awe, ready for the adventure ahead.|"[""1.

On a sunny morning, a large wave hit the ship, Southern Cross, as it sailed through smooth waters. Frank, a boy on board, skillfully avoided the wave by grabbing a stanchion. A week later, the ship was in warmer waters, and the boys were excitedly watching flying fish. Billy and Harry had recovered from sea-sickness under Dr. Gregg's care. Looking towards the southeast, Harry pointed out the treasure galleon and the Sargasso Sea in the distance. Billy was eager for more adventure, wanting to learn about a mysterious ship mentioned by Frank. The boys decided to head to the wireless room, where they had been practicing picking up signals. Frank intercepted a distress call from a dirigible balloon in trouble at sea, and they planned a rescue mission.|"['1.

Frank swiftly climbed the steps to the deck and burst into the captain's cabin where Captain Barrington and Captain Hazzard were engrossed in charts. Captain Barrington, after hearing Frank's report, directed a change in course. As they scanned the sea, Captain Barrington used binoculars to spot a drifting airship with two men in distress. One man climbed the gas bag while the other stayed on the deck. Suddenly, the airship collapsed into the ocean with one man aboard. The other man, now in the water, awaited rescue. The crew of the Southern Cross rushed to aid the survivors, but a shark attacked one man before they could reach him. Tragically, the shark took him under, leaving only a crimson circle on the water. Despite the crew's efforts, they were unable to save him from the sea predator.|"['1.

The second man, overwhelmed by his companion's tragedy, managed to grab a rope as he was being pulled back to the vessel. Just as the crew prepared to hoist him aboard, two sea creatures lunged at him. Quick to act, Frank fired his revolver, scaring off the monsters. Once safe on deck, the rescued man, in a sorry state, looked oddly familiar to the boys. As the old sailor lit his pipe, he revealed their story. James Melville and the sailor had been testing an air-craft when they were blown out to sea. The wireless call for help saved them. Melville, full of ideas but short on funds, invented the wireless dirigible. After a mishap, they drifted until a ship rescued them.|['1.

The plan to fix the gas bag of the dirigible seemed foolproof until a twist in the halliards made it impossible to open the valve. Despite the perilous situation, the old sailor managed to navigate the bag until disaster struck, causing him to plunge into the sea. Miraculously, he resurfaced along with another crew member, George Melville, as the dirigible disintegrated. The captain then offered the old sailor a position as a bos'n, which he bravely accepted, pledging to help plant the American flag at the South Pole. As the Southern Cross sailed toward its destination, a sudden shock rocked the ship, throwing everyone into chaos. The crew, including the courageous old sailor, faced another unknown challenge on their daring journey.|"['1.

Captain Hazzard heard shouts and cries, rushing out in his night clothes. The sky turned black, making it hard to see. A sulfur smell lingered. The helmsman was baffled by a sudden shock. Captain Barrington ruled out rocks or land nearby. A collision with another ship seemed likely, but no cries were heard. They needed to turn back to find the young adventurers. The weather darkened, hinting at a storm. Suddenly, a shock threw them into darkness. Instead of the sea, they landed on sticky ground. They stumbled onto dry land, surrounded by trees and strange fruits. They lit a bonfire, revealing a tropical scene with palm trees and unknown plants. Birds flew off as the fire blazed, and they realized they were on a muddy beach.|['1.

All agreed it was a good plan and soon fell asleep. Frank's rest was disturbed, feeling like something was lurking nearby. Once, he thought he saw fiery eyes in the dark but dismissed it as his nerves. A storm forced them under a fallen tree for shelter. After breakfast, Ben suggested they split up to explore. Frank and Harry walked along the beach, finding springs. Frank pondered the mysterious events, questioning why the ship's warning bell didn't sound. With his revolver, Frank and Harry hid as Ben shared tales of floating islands made from Amazon forest debris. Ben advised staying positive and making water holders from coconuts. They roasted oysters and planned to explore the island further. While venturing into the forest, they encountered a massive serpent with a menacing gaze.|"[""1.

The older boy aimed his gun at the huge snake, firing as it thrashed in pain. But as they cheered, horror struck them as the snake caught Frank. Petrified, armed only with knives, they hesitated until Ben, grabbing Frank's fallen gun, fired rapidly, saving him. Ben warned of more dangers on the island. Suddenly, a shell rolled towards them, followed by a chilling scream. With limited ammo and water, they feared savage inhabitants. Setting a night watch, they heard a terrifying cry. Startled, they saw dark figures charging at them. Frank shot two, causing the rest to flee. Alone, they scanned the horizon for rescue, finding none. Quietly eating breakfast, they decided to search for water, hoping to distract themselves from their plight.|"[""1.

The morning was spent searching for water on the island, but they found only small remnants of springs. At noon, they rested under a palm tree and ate nuts for a meal. The boys saw a fire approaching rapidly, started by their own campfire. Terrified animals fled past them towards the sea, ignoring the boys. In a desperate attempt to escape the flames, they lashed two tree trunks together to make a raft. With the fire closing in, they launched the raft into the water, using branches as paddles. Suddenly, a savage creature leaped onto their raft, but it miscalculated its jump and missed them.|"['1.

The panther's howl turned into a scream of terror as sharks closed in. The boys, escaping a fire, found themselves surrounded by hungry creatures in the water. Despite the panther's attempts, the sharks attacked, staining the water red. The boys, now safe on a raft, faced a new danger as the sharks lingered, hoping for a meal. Desperate, the boys tried to scare the sharks away with branches, but the predators remained close. As the boys drifted away, a sailor's quick thinking with a flare caught the attention of a passing vessel, the Southern Cross. Rescued and safe, they shared their harrowing tale with the crew. The ship's captain was intrigued by their encounter with a floating island, shedding light on a mysterious collision the ship had faced.|"['1.

During their time in Monte Video, the boys explored the city while Captain Hazzard sent updates and logs back home. Professor Sandburr studied the natives' habits. They witnessed a bullfight that left them disgusted. The boys also saw gauchos herding cattle. Startled by cries from a mud hut, they found the professor covered in red, mistaken for an attacker. It turned out to be chile con-carne stew. They cleaned him up as a crowd gathered. The professor recounted a mishap with a sand-toad.

The group's expressions turned serious as they faced a critical situation at sea. A leak on the Southern Cross posed a significant threat. Captain Hazzard swiftly took charge, directing canvas to be weighted and placed over the leak to contain the water. The carpenters worked diligently to temporarily seal the breach. After a consultation between Captain Hazzard and Captain Barrington of the Brutus, it was decided to seek refuge near the Santa Cruz river in Patagonia for repairs. Despite concerns about the Patagonian giants, the crew felt secure due to their numbers and weaponry. The vessels set course for the shore, reaching the mouth of the river the following day. Professor Sandburr's curiosity about capturing a Patagonian alive added a touch of humor to the situation. The carpenters commenced repairs, while the boys, eager for adventure, were disappointed by the barren landscape ashore. Despite their efforts, they were not allowed to go ashore, and instead, they found solace in fishing as they awaited the completion of the repairs.|"['1.

The enthusiastic professor, though disappointed about not going ashore, enthusiastically joined the boys in fishing. He caught strange fish with delight, calling them names like 'Piscatorius Animata Catfisio.' Suddenly, a bizarre flat fish stung him, causing a commotion. Later, the professor shared tales of Patagonians, claiming they were friendly, unlike what others believed. He planned to sneak ashore that night. The boys, skeptical but curious, agreed to watch over him. However, they overslept and woke past midnight, finding the professor missing. Alarmed, they raised the alarm, leading to a search. Shots and distant horse sounds hinted at a mysterious turn of events. Finally, the boys helped move parts of an aeroplane ashore under searchlights, preparing for an engine test.|"[""1.

Frank had ordered two powerful rifles and dynamite bombs for their journey. He explained that if they needed help, they could signal with visible rockets that produced black smoke in daylight and loud sounds. As they prepared to depart at 4 a.m., Billy Barnes, knowledgeable about airplanes, joined them. The Golden Eagle took off with a roar, leaving behind a cheer from Captain Hazzard. Flying at 1,500 feet and 60 miles per hour, they saw the ships below. Flying over varied landscapes, they encountered large South American condors attacking them. Harry and Billy used rifles to defend against the birds, but the condors persisted, attacking the aeroplane until it was nearly overpowered.|['1.

Quickly and carefully, Harry prepared one of the dangerous explosives. These bombs were set off by a cap upon impact with a solid surface or could be adjusted to explode midair. The aircraft plunged rapidly like a stone, causing a deafening roar that made the boys fear for their eardrums. Frank struggled to control the plane as a flock of condors attacked. The bomb took out many of the condors, leaving only a few survivors too frightened to pursue. The boys continued flying for an hour over the scorching plains, fearing they had lost the professor. However, Harry spotted a distant spot through his binoculars, leading them to a Patagonian encampment.

Frank asked the professor if he found what he was looking for, but the professor sadly admitted he did not. Despite his narrow escape from danger, he was more upset about not finding the rare specimen he sought. As they explored the camp, Frank suggested they should leave. The professor shared how he was captured by the Patagonians while searching for a Patagonian dog-flea. The boys successfully rescued him, and the professor was embarrassed but soon regained his spirits. The Southern Cross fired signals to indicate their success, scaring off any nearby Patagonians. The crew prepared to depart the inhospitable land as they sailed southward. They braced for potential encounters with icebergs in the Antarctic. Despite the professor's skepticism, a whale and a sword-fish engaged in a dramatic battle near their ship.|"['1.

The ship was in peril as a massive iceberg loomed ahead, causing the air to turn bitterly cold. Captain Barrington urgently signaled for help from the Brutus. The crew scrambled to clear the lifeboats as the ship drifted closer to the icy behemoth. The fog thickened, concealing the danger lurking nearby. The ship's rigging suffered damage, but miraculously, disaster was averted. As repairs were made, the voyage continued southward.

"""We were lucky,"" said the experienced sailor. ""Our ship was being towed, so when we hit the ice, our raised bow allowed us to glide on top of it. Another advantage was that the cargo wasn't shifted, keeping the ship balanced. About twenty feet of the bow rested on the polar reef.

Frank and Harry found themselves on a floe after a terrifying encounter with a monster that destroyed their boat. The scientist, who had been thrown into the icy water, joined them on the floe. As they drifted away from the safety of their ships, they faced a dire situation. The boys, worried about survival in the cold without food or drink, tried to keep their fears at bay. When the ships' lookouts spotted them, rescue boats were sent. Just as the boats approached, the killer whale made a final attempt to attack but was swiftly taken down by the ship's surgeon. The boys, feeling remorseful for their actions that led to the boat's destruction, were rescued and cheered up after a warm meal and dry clothes. Captain Barrington had a plan to free the ship from the ice-reef, which involved using dynamite to break free. The explosion was successful, and the ship was finally liberated.|"['1.

The professor had a rare deep-sea lobster in his net when the dynamite caused chaos on board. The explosion startled him, and the lobster bit his thumb before being flung overboard. While the Southern Cross anchored to reconnect with the Brutus, the boys played games and explored the ship. The sailors caught albatrosses for sport, but Captain Hazzard ensured their release afterward. The professor tried to lasso a giant albatross but almost got pulled overboard by the bird. Despite losing the albatross, he shot a snow petrel as a gift. As they sailed through icy waters near the Shetland Islands, the boys anticipated reaching the Great Barrier soon.

One evening, Ben Stubbs warned the boys about an impending storm as they admired a rare sunset. By midnight, the Southern Cross was tossed violently by the raging polar storm. Frank woke to the ship's intense rocking and alerted the others. They rushed on deck, where the icy winds and monstrous waves overwhelmed them. The boys saw the lights of the Brutus ahead, struggling in the storm too. Captain Barrington and his crew worked tirelessly to secure the ship amidst the chaos.

Curious about their peculiar friend's odd request for a chat at an unusual hour, the boys descended the narrow ladder into the professor's cluttered study. There, they found him struggling to secure his collection of odd creatures preserved in jars of alcohol. Despite a few mishaps that led to broken bottles and smelly spills, the boys helped the professor rearrange his specimens. The professor, Professor Simeon Sandburr, expressed his disdain for those who spread false information about the Patagonians but praised Professor Thomas Tapper for his accurate insights. In a dramatic moment, the professor declared his last will and testament, leaving his treasures to various recipients. Amidst the chaos, the crew of the ship faced a terrifying iceberg, but the captain's calm leadership saved the day.

The ships sailed on until one morning, Captain Barrington gathered the boys on deck. With a sweeping gesture, he pointed to a massive white cliff rising abruptly from the sea. The boys marveled at the towering wall of ice, known as the Great Barrier. This formidable structure had challenged explorers like Shackleton and Scott. As they sailed alongside the barrier, they spotted what appeared to be men on a drifting raft. To their surprise, they were peculiar-looking penguins, unbothered by the approaching ship. The professor's attempt to catch one led to a comical mishap, but he was rescued and revived with a stimulant.

Frank, pleased with organizing the night watches, headed towards the boys' hut when he heard commotion. The professor yelled about a sea-leopard biting him. Frank aimed his rifle, but the professor's frantic movements made it challenging. The shot startled the professor, causing him to trip. The sea-leopard, now dead, tumbled over. The professor explained he had star-moss in his gun, so he ran. As the polar night set in, the group stayed in the huts, organizing entertainment. On watch one night, Rastus and Frank noticed a mysterious presence. Despite heightened vigilance, nothing more was seen. As spring approached, the camp prepared for the upcoming adventures. The motor-sledge, a key part of their plans, was readied. It was a sturdy vehicle designed to navigate the snow efficiently, carrying a substantial load at high speeds.|"[""1.

Specially prepared oils and a mix of alcohol with gasoline prevented freezing. The engine was jacketed but air-cooled due to impractical water circulation in polar regions. The odd-looking contraption was tested in early spring on icy terrain. The group drove a motor-sledge across snowy expanses. They stopped near a penguin rookery where the professor explored. Meanwhile, the boys inspected the motor, finding the oil and gasoline in good condition. Laughter erupted as penguins attacked the professor and Rastus. The boys intervened, scaring off the penguins. The professor explained their intrusion was for scientific purposes. Captain Hazzard then tasked the boys with establishing food and blanket depots towards the pole, marked with black flags on bamboo poles for explorers' safety.|"['1.

The boys eagerly joined in the task, setting up three supply stations with the help of a motor-sledge, covering an area of about eighty miles from their base. These depots marked the edge of the snow-capped mountains, believed to be near the North Pole. The boys, guided by Lieutenant Hazzard's calculations, also aimed to locate a Viking ship that had drifted towards the area over time. After careful planning and preparations, the boys embarked on their first flight in the polar region aboard the Golden Eagle. Their mission was to explore the terrain and report back using specialized equipment. As they soared above the icy landscape, the desolate expanse stretched out below them. They approached a towering snow mountain, speculating about the warmth near its crater and the possibility of finding life there. Intrigued by the smoking volcano ahead, they observed its black stone sides and occasional bursts of flame.|"['1.

The boys were on an adventure when an accident caused them to stumble and be confronted by huge, shaggy creatures with tusks. The creatures, resembling seals with two legs in front and flippers behind, advanced towards the boys. Despite a volley of bullets, the monsters kept coming, more enraged than before. Just when things seemed dire, a change in the environment saved them. Bright yellow smoke and blue flames erupted from a nearby crater, causing the monsters to disappear. The boys quickly boarded an aeroplane, leaving the erupting volcano behind. The professor lamented losing a specimen but acknowledged the creatures' ability to anticipate the volcanic activity.

The two boys were startled by a sudden bright light that revealed their hidden aeroplane to their rivals. The mysterious craft quickly disappeared towards the west, leaving the boys concerned that an attack was imminent. They suspected their rivals had followed them using powerful lenses, possibly from the Japanese, and were now aware of their discovery. To prepare for a potential return of their enemies, the boys hastily ate their meal and gathered supplies, including rope, drills, and dynamite. They made their way to the Viking ship and set explosives to gain access to the hold. Inside, they discovered a treasure trove of walrus ivory and gold bars.

The cabin on the Viking ship had basic furniture like couches and bunks made of dark wood. It was sparsely furnished except for a table and chairs. Curious weapons and navigation tools were scattered around. After exploring the cabin, the boys marveled at the sailors' courage in sailing such ships across unknown seas. They decided to distract themselves by working. Using a block and tackle, they hauled out ivory and gold from the plateau. The professor supervised the work. They took a break, eating lunch and drinking hot chocolate. Suddenly, they noticed a dirigible landing nearby. The crew, surprised by the treasure, were stopped by their officer. The professor was angry and threatened to report the incident. The crew inside the dirigible were armed and ordered the boys inside.

An hour later, a concerning event unfolded. Frank, who had shared his plan with the others, grew anxious as the despoilers returned to the ship with stolen treasures. The captain's discussions hinted at a swift departure back to the enemies' camp. However, a sudden change occurred. The captain, previously indifferent to the prisoners, now seemed worried about an approaching storm. Frank's fears grew as he wondered about the fate of their aircraft, the Golden Eagle. Despite the tense atmosphere, they managed to have supper. The captor, in a polite tone, expressed regret about the weather delaying their return.
